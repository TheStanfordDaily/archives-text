## Cardinal routs Redbirds, 8-1 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
Having blistered through her match 6-1.6-0,
freshman Lauren Kalvaria was the first off the
court Sunday as the Cardinal overpowered Illi
nois State 8-1 on Sunday.
Although the Redbirds were tough oppo
nents, the Stantord women, eager to win their
first dual match, almost seemed to be compet
ing with each other to win their respective
matches as quickly as possible.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Sunday: Stanford 8, Illinois State I

Kalvaria showed lew signs of the foot injury
that has kept her on the sidelines the past few
months as she crushed powerful forehand win
ners past her desperate opponent.
"I thought 1 played pretty well." said
Kalvaria. who is playing at the No. 5 singles po
sition. "My feet still hurt a little bit, but they're
playable and it's definitely getting better."
Stanford assistant coach Lele Forood was
impressed by Kalvaria's performance.
Meanwhile, freshman Gabby Lastra. play
ing No. 2 singles, posted an identical score
against Zana Friganovic of Illinois State. While
her fluid groundstrokes often won her points.
Lastra's willingness to attack the net remained
most impressive. Several points ended with
Lastra's formidable overhead bouncing into
the stands.

Freshman Marissa Irvin. playing at the No. 1
position, also made quick work of her oppo
nent. senior Naoko Moore. Irvin pounded
backhand winners into the corners, leaping to a
6-1 first set triumph. Moore, a lefty, hung on at
the beginning of the second set, but Irvin quick
ly regained her momentum, firing an ace on
match point for a 6-1,6-2 victory.
Freshman Keiko Tokuda. on the other
hand, relied on her consistency to wear down
her opponent. Jennifer Liepa. After a relative
ly tight first set. Tokuda's relentless topspin
earned her 6-3,6-1 victory at the No. 3 position.
Sophomore Sarah Pestieau and senior
Marisa Maclennan both found themselves in
more competitive matches, yet both managed
to prevail. Pestieau overcame Illinois State's
Flora Karsai. 7-5, 6-0, while Maclennan out
grunted Brigette Zarazee, 7-5,6-2.
"I'm so glad to be back out here and playing
well." said Maclennan. whose collegiate career
has been jeopardized by injuries and who just
returned from a quarter in Florence.
"My knee's bothering me a little, but I'm
going to take a few days off and hopefully it'll
be fine," Maclennan said. "My game is there.
Mentally, I feel like I can go toe-to-toe with
anyone out there. Physically, I think 1 need to
spend a little more time in the weight room."
Initially, it appeared as if Stanford would
dominate the doubles as it did the singles. The
Cardinal's top team of Lastra / Kalvaria swept
past Liepa / Karsai of Illinois, 8-3. while the No.
2 team of Tokuda and junior Jennifer Heiser
out-played Moore / Friganovic, 8-5.
