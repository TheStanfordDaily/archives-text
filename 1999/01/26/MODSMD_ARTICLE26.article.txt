## Oettinger leads way for track 
### Barry Cooper Contributing writer 
This past weekend the Stanford
women's track and field team left off
where it ended last year, on the way
up.
After coming off a ninth-place
finish at last year's NCAA outdoor
championships, the Cardinal
women showed at the Silver State
Invite that they are determined to
improve upon that this year.
One of the best performances of
the non-scored meet was by long
jumper Tara Oettinger, who took
second with a jump of 19 feet, eight
inches. Oettinger, a senior who has
competed in both the long and triple
jumps at the Pacific 10 Conference
meet in the outdoor season, im
proved her previous personal best
by four full inches. With continued
success she will be in a very good po
sition to make the national meet for
her first time.
In another outstanding perfor
mance, pole-vaulter Melissa Fein
stein cleared 12-1 in the open di
vision of the Pole Vault Summit on
Friday night. Her mark was good
enough to qualify her for the USA
National meet.
Feinstein, the fourth-place finish
er at both the indoor and outdoor
NCAA Championship meets last
year, was happy to be back in a com
petitive atmosphere.
"It felt really good. It felt, after a
great fall season of training, just
good to get back into competition
and get into the swing of things,"
said Feinstein. "I was jumping on
bigger poles than I have been all
year and last vear. I am very excited
about how I performed."
Freshmen Robyn Wool folk
showed in the 55-meter hurdles how
important she will he to the ( ardinal
in team competition. Racing in her
first meet, she placed third in a time of
8.19 seconds, .21 seconds off the
leader. Woolfolk, a high school
standout from the Detroit area, is the
Cardinal's top sprint recruit.
Stanford's presence was perhaps
most felt in the throwing competi
tions. In the weight throw. Maggie

Isaac. Summer Pierson and Maureen
()nyeagbako finished fifth, sixth and
ninth respectively. They made it clear
how important their talents will he in
the Cardinal's run at winning the
Mountain Pacific Championships in
February for a third straight year.
Rounding out the top-10 finishers
for the Cardinal were LaShawndra
Pace and newcomer Fiona Greig who
took fourth and eighth respectively in
the KOO meters.
Head coach Vin Lananna was
pleased to see them competing de
spite their times being far from their
personal bests. He attributed that to
the new setting, the 2(X)-meter track.

"I think it is very difficult for any
thing on the track once you first get
started because most of the athletes
are not accustomed to indoor track to
begin with, and those that are haven't
seen an indoor track for almost a
year," said Lananna. "It's always
good to get one under your belt and
that's why we go."
In all Lananna was very pleased
with his team's performances.
"We were pleased based on that
objectives we had â€” to get the ath
letes to have a first experience," said
Lananna. "I think the athletes per
formed well. It was a great first meet
for us."
