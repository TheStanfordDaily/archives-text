## Oettinger leads way for track 
### Barry Cooper Contributing writer 
This past weekend the Stanford
women's track and field team left off
where it ended last year, on the way
up.
After coming off a ninth-place
finish at last year's NCAA outdoor
championships, the Cardinal
women showed at the Silver State
Invite that they are determined to
improve upon that this year.
One of the best performances of
the non-scored meet was by long
jumper Tara Oettinger, who took
second with a jump of 19 feet, eight
inches. Oettinger, a senior who has
competed in both the long and triple
jumps at the Pacific 10 Conference
meet in the outdoor season, im
proved her previous personal best
by four full inches. With continued
success she will be in a very good po
sition to make the national meet for
her first time.
In another outstanding perfor
mance, pole-vaulter Melissa Fein
stein cleared 12-1 in the open di
vision of the Pole Vault Summit on
Friday night. Her mark was good
enough to qualify her for the USA
National meet.
Feinstein, the fourth-place finish
er at both the indoor and outdoor
NCAA Championship meets last
year, was happy to be back in a com
petitive atmosphere.
"It felt really good. It felt, after a
great fall season of training, just
good to get back into competition
and get into the swing of things,"
said Feinstein. "I was jumping on
bigger poles than I have been all
year and last vear. I am very excited
