# Cardinal ready to take on Mustangs

### Jake Willens 
The No. I Stanford men's tennis
team takes on Southern Methodist in
its first dual match of the season
today at 1:3() p.m. at the Taube Fam
ily I'ennis Stadium, t his is the tough
est season opener the Cardinal has
faced in several years, as SMU comes
in ranked loth and has four players in
the top 1(H).

The match will provide a good test
for the top-ranked Cardinal and is
the start of a very important week of
tennis. Over the weekend the team
will travel to Washington and Ore
gon to open its Pacific 10 Conference
season.
Head coach Dick Gould acknowl
edges just how critical it is for the
Cardinal to establish itself early and
build its confidence.

"Our job is to prove we deserve
the No. 1 ranking. This is the tough
est opener we've had in a while and
one of the four or five toughest home
matehes we will face all year. It is a
very important week of tennis for us,
leading into the team indoors which
are only a few weeks away," said
Gould.
SMII handily beat California this
past Saturday by a score of 6-1, and
some of the Stanford players believe
SMU is even stronger than its rank
ing indicates.
"This match will give us an oppor
tunity to see where we stand against a
top program," junior Geoff Abrams
said. "SMU has four really solid play
ers and may be underrated. I think
this match may have an important
impact on our entire season."
Senior leader Ryan Wolters
agrees.
"You always like to start off the
season with a win and build on that.
We know we have a difficult week
end ahead of us as well, and it would
be nice going up north with a win
under our belt. We have done all we
can to prepare, now it is time to put it
to use," said Wolters.
There is debate about whether the
Cardinal is happy to have such a dif
ficult opener, or if it would rather
ease into the season. While it is excit
ing to play the likes of an SMU first, a
few of the players have only played in

one tournament all season.
"For some players it would be eas
ier to have a few lighter matches first,
but the thick of our season is about to
get underway, and we need to be
ready," sophomore Scotty Scott said.
"We have a different team this year,
with a different feel. Last year we
could just rely on our talent to blow
everyone away. This year we are
more of a team and we understand
every one of our matches count. We
will have to work together and show
some camaraderie."

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday: No. I Stanford vs. No. 10
Southern Methodist, 1:30 p.m. Taube
Family Tennis Stadium.

Sophomore Ali Anzari believes
the Cardinal is very capable of work
ing together as a unit.
"Right now our attitude is good,
we are all healthy and ready to go.
There has been good teamwork in
our practices and we are all itching to
start our season. You can only prac
tice for so long before you crave
match play," said Anzari.
The team has kept itself sharp by
having dual matches in practice, but
it can only do so much to simulate the
real thing. Today's match will show
just how ready the top-ranked ( ardi
nal is to defend its title.
