# Beyerlein takes 1st, track performs well
## 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Sophomore Todd Beyerlein
took first place in the high jump
and Toby Stevenson began his ju
nior campaign with a vault of 17
feet, 2'/S inches as the small contin
gent representing Stanford at the
Silver State Invitational made an
impressive indoor track debut last
weekend.
Leaping over the bar at 6-9,
Beyerlein bested the 6-7 mark of
returning Pacific 10 Conference
champion Kyley Johnson of Ore
gon en route to victory in the Reno,
Nev. hosted meet.
"I didn't have as good of a sea
son as I could have last year, so I've
been pretty pumped to compete
this year," said Beyerlein. "It feels
good to start the season off like this,
and I'm really looking forward to
jumping with the rest of our guys
throughout the season."
Though Beyerlein took the only
individual win of the day for the
Cardinal, impressive marks were
posted by others on the squad.
Stevenson, Stanford's defend
ing national outdoor champion,
rode his 17-2 V-> mark to a fifth

place finish at the Pole Vault Sum
mit, a nationally competitive event
held in conjunction with the Silver
State Invite.
Perhaps most impressive, how
ever, were the efforts turned in by
Stanford's highly touted freshman
class. As a group, the freshmen
showed tremendous promise for
the upcoming season in what was
their first-ever collegiate track and
field competition.
Freshmen Chris Sprague and
George Curts placed second and
third, respectively, in the shot put
with throws of 52-IV4 and 47-V2,
while Ryan Fernandez captured
second in the triple jump at a dis
tance of 48- 3 /4.
The middle distance ranks also
held their own as freshman
Jonathan Stevens cruised through
a 1 minute, 55.13-second 800-meter
run for fourth place. Junior Ryan
Carroll was fifth in 1:56.46, and
freshmen Logan Taylor and Ryan
Meuse were close behind with
times of 1:56.97 and 1:58.65 for
sixth and 12th places, respectively.
Senior Mark Ganek represent
ed the Cardinal big men well by
taking third in the weight throw
with a toss of 52-8.
