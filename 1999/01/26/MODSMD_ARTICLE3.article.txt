# Cancer claims Arroyo RF
## 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
The paper cranes, symbols from
Japanese legend, still hang in the Ar
royo resident fellow cottage. Dorm
residents took three days in Novem
ber to fold them, gifts for RF Alex
Stewart upon his return from the
hospital.
According to the legend, a wish
will come true for anyone who folds
a thousand cranes. A Japanese story
honors a young girl named Sadako, a
victim of atomic bomb-induced
leukemia who died trying to fold
1 ,(XK); her friends are said to have fin
ished the job after her death. With
their RF diagnosed with an inopera
ble brain tumor, freshman Arroyo
resident Lilv Horng suggested the
dorm do the same.
"The thought." Horng said, "was
just to show Alex that we cared. We

really wanted him to know we were
with him."
And so the popular Stanford pro
fessor lived out his final two months
in the company of his family, his
friends and more than a thousand
multicolored origami birds.
Stewart, a senior lecturer in
drama, died Sunday night of brain
cancer. He was 48.
His death was not unexpected. In
late October doctors found an inop
erable tumor in Stewart's brain and
gave him little chance to live. He
spent time hospitalized in November
before being released to hospice care
in his home. Last week he fell into a
coma.
"It's hard because he was so
young." said Assoc. Drama Prof.
Harry Elam. "Everyone knew that
this was coming, but it was really dif

ficult."
Flam praised Stewart for his orga
nization, friendliness and easy-going
manner, "112 le worked in some way or
another on every show I did at Stan
ford," Elam said. "Although he
worked on every show at Stanford,
he always made your show feel spe
cial, unique and important."
Other colleagues agreed. "Alex
had a wonderful sort of optimistic
approach to the work," said Michael
Kamsaur, acting chair of the drama
department. "It let people under
stand that the work and the shows
were important hut that the people

were more important."
Stewart arrived at Stanford in
1984 after stints as a technical direc
tor in professonal theater and lectur
ing at four other universities. 1 le de
signed sets, lighting and sound for
many Stanford productions, as well
as for San Francisco's Victoria The
ater. Julian Theatre, Eureka Theatre
and Magic Theatre and for Ameri
can Theatre Arts.
He taught stage management,
scenic design, technical production
and drafting at the University and
advised undergraduates in technical
areas. He earned the Dean's Distin
guished Teaching Award for 1988-
89.
A mentor to many, Stewart often
worked with drama students in one

on-one tutorials. Alison Duxbury,
( lass of'9s, met weekly with Stewart
to talk through the problems she
faced running the technical side of
several student productions. That
time with Stewart, she said, was the
largest single influence in her deci
sion to pursue a drama career.
"He was one of the most giving,
caring people that I encountered at
Stanford," she said. "I baby-sat for
him."
Senior Avery Willis had a similar
experience, following Stewart's ad
vice through four years of technical
work in Stanford productions. More
than a teacher, she said, "I saw him as
a mentor. He was always there with
suggestions on how things could be
improved."

Stewart's influence on students
extended beyond the Drama De
partment and into Arroyo, where he
and his wife Barbara became RFs in
1994.
"He was a model RF," said Andy
Hernandez, resident dean for Wilbur
and Stern Halls.
"He had a great sense of humor.
He was really engaging, really en
gaged students."
Stewart is survived by his parents,
John and Ruth Stewart; his brother.
John Stewart Jr.: his sister, Charlotte
Stewart; his wife and two sons, 10-
year-old Eric and 12-year-old Dylan.
"He was a really good dad for his
two sons," Hernandez said. His
death was a loss for them and "a real
loss for Stanford."
