# Study advocates faculty policy review
## Nationally, post-tenure reviews, part-time faculty issues need attention 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
Higher education policies toward
faculty need more frequent and de
tailed attention, according to a report
published by the American Associa
tion of State Colleges and Universi
ties.

However, Stanford administra
tors say they have already addressed
many of the issues in the report,
which include thorough assessment
or "post-tenure reviews" for profes
sors and extensive oversight and re
view of part-time adjuncts.
Based on a study of campus
tenure codes and other employment

policies, the report gives a total of 49
recommendations on faculty hiring,
promotion and evaluation.
Accountability is the issue, said
Stanford senior associate provost
Kathy Gillam. Gillam commented
that procedures in place for tenure
review and promotion are serious
and extensive.

"Every year, certain faculty come
up for review in a very articulated
process," Gillam said. "The ongoing
process is always under scrutiny, even
as individuals are going through it.
There is a high degree of consisten
cy."
Besides the tenure process, faculty
members are reviewed every year.
They are required to fill out a survey
of what their curricula accomplished
during the year, according to Gillam.
Three years ago, a Stanford com
mittee on tenure reform looked at the
procedures and made some minor
modifications and clarifications. This
process is ongoing, according to
Gillam.
In addition. Gillam noted that
Stanford does not have the large con
tingent of part-time adjunct faculty
that other schools, such as those in the
UC system, deal with.
The AASCU's study involved a
year-long analysis, working with
three other national intercollegiate
associations. The study also covered
seven major systems of public higher
education, including California and-
New York.
The report bears the mission state
ment that "Higher education must
learn to manage human resources
better and indeed define, direct and
deploy our intellectual resources with
originality and attention to evolving
institutional missions."
John M. Hammang. director of
special projects at A AS( TI and coor
dinator of the report, said that Cali
fornia State University system and
other public university systems are
not paying their part-time faculty on a
par with full-time faculty, according
to the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion.
"Recommendations were drawn
from institutions where change is oc
curring," said AASCTJ director of
communications Gay Clyburn.
"(ienerally, institutions are not doing
enough for part-time faculty, so we're
suggesting looking to find a balance
between a mix of part-time and full

ti- j faculty."
For example, the UC system
maintains a faculty that is about 20
percent part-time. Also, no full-scale
review of tenure procedures in the
UC system has been conducted re
cently, though partial reviews were
done in 1991 and 1994.
"We don't see a pressing need to
do so because of the high quality of
our faculty," said Brad Hayward.
from the UC public information ol
fice. "If there are complaints, we will
conduct reviews on an individual
basis, but we have no plans for the
system as a whole."
Throughout the UC' system, there
is some uniformity in system-wide
tenure policies, according to a source
who declined to be named in UC
President Richard Atkinson's office.
"There's not much reform going
on right now," she said, "but there is ;i
fairly extensive existing tenure sys
tern and post-tenure review system"
throughout the system.
Unlike the UC system but in line
with Stanford, Columbia University
has few part-time faculty, and most
are not solely lecturers.
"Our part-time faculty are made
up for the most part of individuals in
another field, like a practicing attor
ney or the editor of the New York
limes," said Virgil Renzulli. in Co
lumbia's Provost's Office. "We have
people like George Stephanopolous.
as an example, who lectures on the
side of being an ABC commentator."
For another example, the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania has a post-tenure
review process. But according to
Carol Jones in Penn's Associate
Provost's Office, there are currently
no changes occurring in their review
process.
"We have a standard procedure
for [post-tenure review] and sabbati
cals to confirm that scholarship lines
are up with our expectations," Jones
said.
