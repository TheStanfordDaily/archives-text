# Study advocates faculty policy review
## Nationally, post-tenure reviews, part-time faculty issues need attention 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
Higher education policies toward
faculty need more frequent and de
tailed attention, according to a report
published by the American Associa
tion of State Colleges and Universi
ties.

However, Stanford administra
tors say they have already addressed
many of the issues in the report,
which include thorough assessment
or "post-tenure reviews" for profes
sors and extensive oversight and re
view of part-time adjuncts.
Based on a study of campus
tenure codes and other employment

policies, the report gives a total of 49
recommendations on faculty hiring,
promotion and evaluation.
Accountability is the issue, said
Stanford senior associate provost
Kathy Gillam. Gillam commented
that procedures in place for tenure
review and promotion are serious
and extensive.

"Every year, certain faculty come
up for review in a very articulated
process," Gillam said. "The ongoing
process is always under scrutiny, even
as individuals are going through it.
There is a high degree of consisten
cy."
