terday, marking the first recognition
by that country of the artifacts that
the institution has gathered and pre
served.
The collections provide scholars
with official government documents,
personal letters, photographs and di
aries as a way to glimpse into the
lives of the Romanian royal family
and other prominent Romanians.
Herbert Hoover hoped that
through these artifacts, students
would to learn how to prevent disas
ters like World War I from occurring
again, according to Elena Danielson,

the director of the archives.
"Once things get published, they
get sanitized," Danielson said. "Per
sonal letters and diaries are more
candid and show true opinions. I "hey
bring out personalities and people
seem much more real."
U.S. Ambassador to Romania
Jim Rosapepe said that the Hoover
Institution collection is a great thing
to have in America, since Romania is
not as well known in the United
States as other countries are.
Nicolae Constantinescu. Consul
General of Romania in the United
States, was the other visiting diplo

sions made by the people featured in
the collection "changed my life,
changed my country and changed the
fate ol half of Europe." he said.
"It is very necessary not to repeat
this. The I loover Institution is the in
stitution lor peace and the preven
tion of war," he said. "I know the
price of war."
A pre-1989 visit to the institute
by Romanian authorities, when the
country was still under Communist
control, would not have been possi
ble according to Laura Cosovanu,
the library specialist at the
archives.
"It Communist authorities had
come, I would never have dared to
show pictures of the royal family nor
the records of the governments that
fought against Communism," she
said. "A communist visit would not
have lit with the general profile of
this institution because Hoover is
anti-totalitarian regime, both com
munist and fascist."
When communists seized lull
power in Romania in 1947, many of

the government ministers emigrated
to the United States, where they set
up their own government recognized
by the U.S. State Department. At
this time, unofficial Eastern Euro
pean governments in exile, called
"committees," such as the Romanian
one. were sprouting up in Washing
ton D.C.
These movements fought against
communism and tried to make public
the disregard ol human rights and the
poor economic conditions in com
munist nations, according to Coso
vanu.
Hoover houses many records of
this committee, including correspon
dence between committee members
and U.S. Presidents Nixon, Ford,
Eisenhower and Kennedy.
One of the collection's main at
tractions is the collection of pho
tographs and letters of the Roman
ian royal family from around the
time of World War I.
Stanford students planned to take
the diplomats on a tour ol the cam
pus Monday afternoon. The Roman
ian diplomats are in town mainly to
visit the Hoover collection, but yes
terday, they met with members of the
Romanian business community in
the Ray Area.
