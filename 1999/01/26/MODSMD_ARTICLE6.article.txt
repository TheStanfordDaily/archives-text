# Midnight Runners find safety, cameraderie in numbers
## Jogging in the late hours

Karen Morris used to run alone at night. She's a

'night person' and besides, she felt safe on campus.
Until she was followed.
Morris, a graduate student in anthropology, was
running in the Ouad around 1 :(H) a.m. when she spot
ted someone lurking behind a column in the pla/a.
"It took me a while to react." Morris said. "I kept
thinking I was misreading the situation."
As she continued running, she noticed that the
man went from one column to the next, trailing her.
She was terrified, and when she got to the end of the
columns, she broke into a sprint — and the stranger
came after her.
Morris ran all the way to her car. which was parked
in the Oval. When she turned around, the follower
was nowhere in sight. She was so frightened she could
barely start her car. but she managed to get home un
harmed.
Fortunately, Morris got away safely. Hut this inci
dent prompted her to change her behavior. She no
longer studies in the Quad at night, nor does she run
by herself after dark.
In order to maintain her running regimen of four
to six miles, four times a week. Morris got connected
to a network of Stanford women w ho run after hours.
Midnight Runners, a group sponsored by the
Women's Center, was started so women could meet
people to run with at night. They met for the first time

on I uesday.
"We organized the group so that
women can run or walk at night and
feel safe and empowered," said Jill
l)i Giovanni, health intern at the
Women's Center.
Di Giovanni, a sophomore,
spearheaded the group because it
bothered her to see so many
women alone on campus after
dark.
Senior Noelle iluscn attended
Tuesday's meeting to get in touch
with other runners who enjoy jog
ging at night. Husen used to run
with a group at night, but stopped
when the group was no longer able
to coordinate individual schedules.
"I like to run at night and. I think
[Midnight Runners) is a great idea
because it's hard to find people
with your skill level," said 1 luscn.
Many Stanford women, howev
er. continue to run long after the
sun has set alone.
"I feel that these people are
making a conscious decision to take
their safety in their own hands,"
said I t. Del Dandy, who has been

with the Stanford Police Depart
ment for 21 years. "We're a fairly
safe campus, but we're in a metro
politan area and crime does happen
here."
Last fall, a female student walk
ing alone on campus late at night
was attacked near Roble Field. The
student got away with minor in
juries, but the incident startled the
normally peaceful campus.
I he incidence of women run
ning or walking alone at night may
stem from the fact that many be
lieve they are safe on campus.
" I hey may feel like they're in a
park setting, but they can become
victims very easily." said Bandy.
"We recommend that everyone —
not just women — run with a part
ner."
Bandy also advised that runners
and walkers stay on "suggested
travel routes," a set of routes that
the Stanford Police Department
has surveyed at night for safety.
These routes have been deter
mined according to their lighting,
access to campus emergency
phones, shrubbery level and re
moteness. Maps of suggested travel
routes are available at the Stanford
police station.
