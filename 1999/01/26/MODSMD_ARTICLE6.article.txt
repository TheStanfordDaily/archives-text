Karen Morris used to run alone at night. She's a

'night person' and besides, she felt safe on campus.
Until she was followed.
Morris, a graduate student in anthropology, was
running in the Ouad around 1 :(H) a.m. when she spot
ted someone lurking behind a column in the pla/a.
"It took me a while to react." Morris said. "I kept
thinking I was misreading the situation."
As she continued running, she noticed that the
man went from one column to the next, trailing her.
She was terrified, and when she got to the end of the
columns, she broke into a sprint â€” and the stranger
came after her.
Morris ran all the way to her car. which was parked
in the Oval. When she turned around, the follower
was nowhere in sight. She was so frightened she could
barely start her car. but she managed to get home un
harmed.
Fortunately, Morris got away safely. Hut this inci
dent prompted her to change her behavior. She no
longer studies in the Quad at night, nor does she run
by herself after dark.
In order to maintain her running regimen of four
to six miles, four times a week. Morris got connected
to a network of Stanford women w ho run after hours.
Midnight Runners, a group sponsored by the
Women's Center, was started so women could meet
people to run with at night. They met for the first time
