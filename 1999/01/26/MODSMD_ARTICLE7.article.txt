The belief in aesthetic autonomy requires the "am
putation" of dimensions of the past and future, Duke
University Comparative Literature Prof. Frederic
Jameson told an overflowing audience at the Law
School last night.
In a speech he titled "Myths of the Modern." Jame
son. a well-known literary historian, contended that
the autonomy of art is itself somewhat of a construc
tion.
I Jnderlying the idea of "aesthetic autonomy" is the
notion of art as a purely subjective enterprise.
Jameson, who is the first Presidential Lecturer of
the quarter, said that the idea that pure subjectivity
can be isolated from time is misguided because the
subjective is unrepresentable.
As a result, "[t|he narrative of modernity cannot be
told with reference to [subjectivity]."
That is. modernity lies not in the object or the sub
ject, but in the situation, he added.
"Our difficulty in ... resituating the modern ... in
volves difficulties in [ imagining J ourselves. The post
modern is modern, too," he said.
Postmodernism is characterized by commodifica
tion and an emphasis on the present.
"Only the moment counts. |As in ] action movies,
the plot is a pretext for a series of intensities," he said.
"An older political economy (hobbles) over ... [as)
the reinvention of the market," he said.
Jameson further argued that current attempts in

academic circles to avoid periodization are futile.
"We cannot not periodi/e.. . . (T|his is the context
in which I want us to understand the return of the idea
of modernity itself." Jameson said.
Jameson proposed that "modernity is not a con
cept. but a narrative category."
"The concept of modernity seems respectable and
academic enough." Jameson said. "Modernity [has) al
ways had something to do with technology."
The lirst World War. however, brought a blow to
these notions of progress.
"No theory of |modernism] makes sense unless it
comes to terms with the postmodern break with the
modern," Jameson said.
"]l]n full post modernity... [there is] general agree
ment on those features of the modern that [are] no
longer desirable." he said.
The undesirable vestiges of the modern include as
ceticism, authoritarianism and teleology, he added.
Despite this rupture, however, postmodernism is
preparing for the return of modernism. Jameson ar
gued.
()ne sign of this return is the revival of the belief in
aesthetic autonomy and the associated notion that cul
tural studies cause pure art to be "irreparably tainted."
Jameson said. "Culture ... is a space of mediation . ..
between life and art."
English and Comparative Literature Prof. John
Bender, who introduced Jameson, articulated Jame
son's belief that "literature and every cultural object is
a materialization of the ... tension between the con
crete world and the [world of dreams]."
