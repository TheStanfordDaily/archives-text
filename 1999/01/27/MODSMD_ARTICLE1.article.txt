## Announces 'Midnight Breakfast' for Dead Week 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Students searching for that per
fect late-night snack before studying
for finals will have the option of at
tending a new midnight meal, served
up — literally — by faculty and staff.
In her State of the Association
address before the ASSU Senate
yesterday, President Maren Norton
announced plans for the inaugural
"Midnight Breakfast," a free meal
designed to provide a unique study
break on the eve of winter quarter
Dead Week.
"Special guests in the dining hall
that evening will include several
noteworthy faculty and staff who
have agreed to help serve food and
beverages," Norton said, adding that
the event is designed for both under
graduate and graduate students.
"We are excited to inaugurate
what we hope will become a great

Stanford tradi
tion," Norton con
tinued.
She also an
nounced that the
University will
permanently fund
extended hours
for the Marguerite
bus system.

Friday night and weekend trans
portation service for students was a
top priority for Norton and Vice
President Santos Marroquin when
they took office. In the fall, hours for
the Marguerite were extended on an
interim basis.
"While the Midnight Express is
definitely a step in the right direc
tion, Santos and 1 will continue our
talks with University officials to ex
plore the likely possibility of further
expanding the Marguerite service,"
said Norton.
Completing proposed projects

was a theme throughout her speech,
as Norton reflected on the previous
accomplishments of the Senate and
announced new measures.
"Our job is far from over. Our job
is never over ... Let us realize our
mission — to serve and actively ad
vocate on behalf of all Stanford stu
dents," said Norton.
Senators gave Norton a standing
ovation following her speech, but a
heated debate soon broke out over
the appropriation of funds garnered
from ASSU special fees.
Graduate Senator William Intner
criticized the process in which funds
are appropriated.
Currently, funding for large orga
nizations is decided each spring in
the ASSU General Election, when
all students can vote on special fee
allocation. Smaller organizations
apply to a Program Board for fund-
