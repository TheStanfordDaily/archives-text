# Haas fellows pursue service
## 
### Julie Chai Contributing writer 
Although the state of Kerala in
southern India is one of the healthi
est areas in the country, malnutri
tion remains a serious concern.
tJnia Sanghvi. a senior in biolo
gy. spent last summer living in a vil
lage in Kerala, working with ;i local
doctor to help combat this problem.
With the support of a Summer Fel
lowship from the Haas Center for
Public Service, Sanghvi studied the
health care patterns of mothers and
their newborns and ultimately de
signed a nutritional outreach pro
gram to help improve the villagers'
health.
I lie Summer Fellowship is one
of the Haas Center's oldest pro
grams. founded in IW4 to honor
former University President Don
ald Kennedy's commitment to pub
lic service. Its goal is to encourage
students to explore public service as
a potential career option and offers
fellows up to $2,5(X) to develop and
carry out a project which serves a
particular community.
An anonymous donation of
$S(M).(KH) in |wk,S has helped keep
the program going, along with en

dowments from the H. Michael
Stevens family, William and Reva
looley and contributions to the
James Cash Penney Fund.
The parameters for project ideas
are quite open and flexible and in
vite innovative approaches to social
dilemmas. Students can create a
unique project or work on a project
that has already been designed but
was not mobilized for reasons such
as a lack of funds. The program does
not. however, fund established in
ternships, and fellows are required
to work full-time with a community
partner on the project for a mini
mum of nine weeks.
The Haas Center offers work
shops to help undergraduates and
graduate students develop their
project ideas and proposals. A pro
posal writing workshop will be held
today, and final applications for the
Summer Fellowship program are
due Feb. 22.
"It's probably one of the best op
portunities on campus," Sanghvi
said. "The staff gives you so much
help and really makes themselves
available to help you get the re
sources you need."
Students such as Sanghvi have
taken on tremendous endeavors

over the years.
"We get some of the most com
mitted and passionate students on
campus," said Sue Gray, fellowship
programs coordinator at the Haas
Center. "It's exciting to he part of
that."
Gray said some students' experi
ences as summer fellows have led
them to pursue public service as a
profession after they have left Stan
ford.
"This is the foundation that
launches people into those careers,"
Gray continued. "A lot of students
come back and say 'this is the best
thing I ever did at Stanford.' "
The program not only aids com
munities, but can also transform the
students who participate.
Sanghvi described arriving in
India to find that the interpreter she
was promised was nowhere in sight.
But she discovered that she was able
to get around the area on her own
and emerged from the whole expe
rience feeling more self-assured
about her abilities and resourceful
ness.
"I came back from there with a
lot more confidence in international
travel and planning my own pro
ject," Sanghvi said. "I really look at

it as the most valuable summer I've
had."
Antonia Welch, also a fellow last
summer, had been serving as a med
ical interpreter at the Rota Care Ur
gent Care Free Clinic, which offers
free medical services to patients
without insurance in East Palo Alto.
She found that many Spanish
speaking patients could benefit
from information in Spanish about
health topics such as nutrition, hy
pertension and pre-natal care.
Welch, a junior in Latin American
Studies and Spanish with an empha
sis on health, designed and deliv
ered lectures in Spanish to the Ro
ta Care patients.
Welch's experience had a signifi
cant impact on her.
"I would like to work in public
health and the fellowship confirmed
this for me," Welch said.
" The program gives a tremen
dous amount of hope to people who
are willing to give up part of their
lives or dedicate themselves to pub
lic service," said Welch, who is cur
rently the student fellowship coordi
nator for the program. "Knowing
that there are benefactors and en
dowments assures that the chain of
giving continues."
