## Prosecution calls for Clinton appearance Testimony sought from Lewinsky, White House aide Blumenthal and friend Jordan 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”In a surprise
move. House prosecutors asked the Senate
yesterday to "request the appearance" of
President Clinton at a deposition for his
impeachment trial. They also sought sub
poenas to question Monica Lewinsky, pres
idential friend Vernon Jordan and White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
The president's chief lawyer immediate
ly dismissed the request as unnecessary,
calling it the product of the House prosecu
tors' "desire, their hope, their prayer that
something will come to rescue their case."
Attorney David Kendall also warned that
the White House will demand extensive
time to prepare if witnesses are authorized.
After four hours of arguments between
the two legal teams, senators closed the
doors of their chamber for a second day to
begin a debate on the thorny issue. Senators
voted SK-41 to reject opening up the debate
to the public.
The prosecutors made the motion seek
ing witnesses at the start of the trial yester
day, substantially paring down their
demand for live testimonv before a Senate

deeply divided on the issue. The motion
requested only that the witnesses be ques
tioned at depositions, though the prosecu
tors argued in today's debate that they still
wanted live testimony.
"The two people who know the most
about this are Monica Lewinsky and Presi
dent William Jefferson Clinton," Rep. Bill
McCollum said, opening the prosecutors'
arguments.
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-111., the lead prose
cutor, insisted, "We have an excellent case
without the witnesses but the witnesses help
you. We have narrowed it down to three, a
pitiful three." He also scoffed at the threat
that any witnesses would substantially delay
the trial. "The threat of prolonged hearings,
I suppose, is supposed to make you tremble.
It doesn't me," Hyde said.
Clinton was in St. Louis to greet Pope
John Paul 11, the upbeat welcome sharing a
split screen with the trial on national televi
sion.
On the president's behalf, Kendall
assailed the prosecutors' demand for wit
nesses, noting they had called none of them

during the House impeachment inquiry. He
also suggested the House manager had
worked closely with Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr and had the benefit of Starr's
extensive evidence.
The Senate was to vote at 1 p.m. EST
Wednesday on the witness question and a
Democratic request to dismiss the case. The
Senate's Democrats are mostly united in
their support to dismiss the case and oppose
witnesses, but their leader suggested today
that the chance that wavering Republicans
would join Democrats had evaporated and
he expected party-line votes on both issues.
"1 think on the vote on dismissal and the
vote on witnesses, it sounds like the line is
going to be drawn." said Minority Leader
Tom Daschle. He dismissed the request for
Clinton to testify: 'That's a red herring. It is
not going anywhere."
Republicans signaled they expected to
have the votes to approve witness deposi
tions that would be wrapped up by early
next week. Senate Majority Trent Lott's
spokesman, John Czwartacki, praised the
prosecutors' witness list as "narrow, focused

and reasonable" and said passage was "a
very good possibility."
White House lawyers would be entitled
to attend and ask questions, he said..
The motion submitted by House prose
cutors demanded subpoenas for Ms. Lewin
sky and the two presidential advisers, but
not Clinton. Instead, the motion said the
prosecutors "request the appearance of
William Jefferson Clinton... at a deposi
tion "

Jordan, a longtime Clinton confidant
and golfing partner, helped find Ms. Lewin
sky a job around the time she had emerged
as a subpoenaed figure in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case against Clinton. Jor
dan denies the job search and the lawsuit
were connected.
Blumenthal was one of the aides to
whom Clinton first denied having a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky after the
controversy erupted.
