ABU FALOUS, Iraq (AP)-
Three U.S. aircraft fired on radar
defenses in northern Iraq yesterday
even as Iraqis mourned relatives
killed by what appeared to errant
American missiles in the country's
south.
In this village at the country's
southernmost tip. the sounds of
prayer from a mosque filled the
morning air as women gathered to
beat their chests and wail in a tradi
tional expression of grief.
Two stone houses had collapsed
nearby, and two others were badly
damaged. Iraqi officials say six peo
ple were killed in Abu Falous and
five others died in the nearby city of
Basra's al-Jumhuriya neighbor
hood when missiles struck Monday
morning.
U.S. officials said Air Force and
Navy jets attacked air defense posts
Monday in response to threats from
anti-aircraft fire and Iraqi war
planes violating the no-fly zone
imposed by the United States and
its allies over southern Iraq. They
said at least one misfired missile
may have killed civilians.
U.S. military officials said today
in Turkey said that Air Force and
Navy jets patrolling the separate
no-flv zone in northern Iraq today
fired missiles and precision-guided
munitions after being targeted by
Iraqi radar or anti-aircraft defenses.
Today's airstrikes occurred near
the northern Iraqi city of Mosul,
said a statement from the U.S.
Operation Northern Watch, which

is in charge of the northern no-fly
zone. Damage from the missiles
was being assessed, it said.
Despite the U.S. statement that
at least one of Monday's missiles
could have gone astray, other
reports suggested that more mis
siles may have gone off course near
Basra. 230 miles south of the capi
tal. Baghdad.
Ahmed Ibrahim Hamash, the
governor of Basra, said two aircraft
fired live missiles, with three hitting
civilian areas and two others strik
ing near the city's airport and in an
oil field.
Iran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported today that a
missile landed outside the Iranian
city of Abadan, 30 miles east of
Basra.
In a speech carried today by the
official Iraqi New Agency, Presi
dent Saddam Hussein vowed to
retaliate for the deaths and damage.
"Your blood will not be shed in
vain," he said, addressing the near
ly I million people of Basra. He did
not specify what action he might
take.
Iraqi officials say the 11 people
killed Monday were all women,
children and elderly because most
of the city's men were at work when
the missiles hit residential areas.
They said 59 others were wounded.
U.S. aircraft have been firing
almost daily at Iraqi air defenses in
southern and northern no-fly zones
in Iraq since American and British
airstrikes in mid-December.
