ARMENIA. Colombia (AP) â€”
The death toll surpassed I,(XK) yes
terday from a powerful earthquake
that destroyed nearly two-thirds of
all the buildings in this western
Colombian city.
But as Colombians reeled from
the worst earthquake to strike this
seismically active country in more
than a century, citizens cheered in
the streets of downtown early
today when the Red Cross rescued
three men trapped overnight in the
rubble of a wrecked four-story
building.
Stunned residents in Colombia's
coffee belt chose to wait out the
night around bonfires rather than
venture back into their crumpled
homes following the magnitude 6
quake, which injured hundreds.
The earthquake flattened cities
and towns across western Colom
bia on Monday afternoon, rattling
buildings as far away as Bogota,
140 miles from the epicenter.
Hundreds of the dead lived in
Armenia, a city of 22().(XK) residents
where entire neighborhoods were
reduced to rubble and left without
water or electricity, and where resi
dents say relief has been slow to
arrive.
Capt. Ciro Antonio Guiza, the
city's deputy fire chief, said rescue
workers were so strapped that
many bodies remained on the
streets uncollected.
"There are more than 1,000

dead, perhaps more than 2.000 in
Armenia alone," he said.
Hundreds of bodies were
trapped in 25 buildings that col
lapsed, he said. In one 10-story
apartment building alone, an esti
mated 60 people were crushed to
death, Guiza said.
Some 700 buildings were
destroyed and IKO.(XX) people left
homeless in Armenia alone.

Colombian Red Cross official Car
los Ciilberto Giraldo told The
Associated Press.
The injured were being evacuat
ed by air to Bogota. Medellin and
Cali, and by road to nearby Man
izales, he said. Without refigerator
trucks to store the hundreds of rot
ting corpses, epidemics could break
out, worried Giraldo.
I liana Patricia Vega, 26. paced

the working-class Brasilia Nueva
district in tears, her bright red dress
torn, her right shoulder naked to
the cool night.
"Oh. my baby, he was so beauti
ful." she said of her 10-year-old
son. Jon Alexander.
She was on the second floor with
her son and 6-year-old daughter
when everything collapsed, killing
the boy almost immediately.
