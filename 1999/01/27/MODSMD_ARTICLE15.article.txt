# Pope, Clinton meet in St. Louis
## 
### 
St. LOUIS (AP) — A president
living through a modern morality
play met today with the spiritual
leader of the world's Roman
Catholics. But Pope John Paul II
was more concerned with what he
termed a "time of trial" for Ameri
can culture than the impeachment
trial against President Clinton.
The pontiff also made oblique
reference in prepared remarks to
the errant U.S. missile attack in
Iraq, which he had condemned
through a spokesman a day earlier,
hut he dropped them from his
speech before delivery.
Looking frail, the 78-year-old
pope walked slowly into an Air
National Guard hangar draped
with blue curtains where he met the
president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
Clinton praised John Paul for his
efforts to promote peace and com
passion for the less fortunate
around the globe with "a boundless
physical energy which can only find
its source in limitless faith."
At the close of a century Clinton
said had seen "much suffering, but
which ends with much hope for
freedom and reconciliation," the

president honored John Paul for his
past stands against communism and
his defense of human rights from
Africa to the Balkans.
"People still need to hear your
message that all are God's children,
all have fallen short of his glory."
Clinton said.
"All of the injustices of yester
day cannot excuse a single injustice
today."
The pope, likening the current
debates over abortion and euthana
sia to the fight against slavery and
racism over the past century, said,
"America faces a similar time of
trial."
"Today, the conflict is between a
culture that affirms, cherishes and
celebrates the gift of life, and a cul
ture that seeks to declare entire
groups of human beings ... consid
ered 'unuseful" to be outside the
boundaries of legal protection," he
said.
Clinton was meeting with the
pope for 45 minutes after a wel
coming ceremony at a St. Louis air
port hangar.
White House officials said Iraq,
Cuba and human rights were on the
agenda.
