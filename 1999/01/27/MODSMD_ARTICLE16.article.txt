# Whitewater figure Hubbell to face tax evasion charges

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Handing prose
cutor Kenneth Starr a major victory, a divid
ed federal appeals court yesterday reinstated
tax evasion charges against presidential friend
and Whitewater figure Webster Hubbell, his
wife and two friends.
The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a
federal judge overstepped his authority when
he threw out the tax charges against the four
last year.
"The Supreme Court upheld the constitu
tionality of Congress's independent counsel
arrangements It is not for lower court
judges to undercut that decision by construc
tions of the Act that prevent this Independent
Counsel from performing his duty in a man
ner reasonably approximating that of an ordi
nary prosecutor," the court held in two 2-1
ruling.
The decision means that Hubbell, who
already has served one prison sentence, now
faces two additional criminal trials involving
Starr's office, which alleges he cheated his on
taxes and obstructed investigators in the
Whitewater investigation. The obstruction
case was brought by Starr late last year while
the appeal was pending in the tax case.
In throwing out the tax case against
Hubbell, U.S. District Judge James Robert

son said Starr had exceeded his authority in
bringing the charges and that Starr had
unfairly used Hubbell's own financial records
against him in assembling evidence against
the former associate attorney general.
Hubbell had turned over the records to Starr
under a limited grant of immunity known as
production immunity.
The appeals court validated Starr's theory
of the case — that he was entitled to bring the
charges based on evidence that hundreds of
thousands of dollars he was paid by friends of
President Clinton may have been "hush
money" to ensure his silence in Starr's White
water probe.
"The timing, sources, and extent of the
payments make the belief that they were hush
money reasonable," said the appeals court.
That suffices to bring the charges, the court
added.
The appeals court, however, raised ques
tions about the extent to which Starr can rely
on the documents he collected from Hubbell
in prosecuting the friend of the President.
The tax case against Hubbell, his wife, his
tax preparer and his tax lawyer stemmed from
hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments
to the former law partner of Hillary Rodham
Clinton by friends of the Clintons in 1994.
