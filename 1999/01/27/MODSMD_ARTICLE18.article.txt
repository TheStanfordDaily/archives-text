Honor Code violations
necessitate student intro
spection and due process

Every student knows that
the pressures of college life can
occasionally become unbearable.
The responsibility of living independently
for the first time, making new friends, sus
taining meaningful relationships and suc
ceeding academically burden all students.
At Stanford the pressure to get good
grades is particularly strong. Many parents
are making great sacrifices to send their
children to this reputable and expensive
institution, and most students at Stanford
also feel the weight of their own internal
motivation. Competition for coveted con
sulting jobs and medical school slots fre
quently propels students into all-nighters
and Friday nights in the 24-hour study
room.
In an atmosphere of such drive, burden
and expense, the temptation to find an easy
way out is understandably attractive. At
Stanford it is up to students and professors
to ensure academic integrity by abiding by a
judicial system set up by students and facul
ty more than a century ago. Professors and
teaching assistants are required to report
any violations of the Stanford Honor Code
lo a judicial affairs officer, who then deter
mines whether there is enough evidence
against the student to justify a trial before
peers on the judicial panel.

In light of recent research indicating that
professors at most universities personally
discipline students they suspect of cheating,
we feel the responsibility to validate and
support Stanford's objective judicial sys
tem. While instances of cheating at Stan
ford are reportedly low compared to most
schools, cheating does occur and students
often feel the pressure to make up lab data
or copy a paragraph from an obscure book
to save another night of missed sleep.
The problem with professors individual
ly disciplining cheaters is inconsistency and
unfairness. Say, for example, that two stu
dents turn in plagiarized papers to different
professors. One professor may lower the
student's final grade but still pass him or
her, while the other professor may fail that
student or even move to have him or her
expelled from the University.
In addition to unfair and inconsistent
punishments, the lack of a standard judicial
process can deprive students of the right of
due process and an objective investigation
of a professor or TA's allegation. This right
is crucial for students who agree to abide
by an Honor Code before taking every
exam.
The judicial process exists to ensure aca
demic integrity among all Stanford students
and faculty, and concerned students and
faculty should voice any concerns they have
over the fairness of the process and the con
duct of its administrators. Ultimately, the
judicial system works for the benefit of all
students by assuring that Stanford main
tains its academic reputation through the
honest and original work of its students.
