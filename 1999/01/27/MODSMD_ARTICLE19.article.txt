## Dear Eugene, signed Soul Surfing 
### 
AS A FAN of both
technology and
trashy magazines,
I have decided to bring
together two great cultural
institutions: Web surfing
and advice columns.

Over the past few

months, numerous readers have sent in let
ters, asking for advice and searching for
guidance. I will address some of the more
common questions here by giving them
each a short response and a useful Web site
to visit for more information.

How can I increase my sex appeal?
I am sure many of you remember
Michael Flatley, the creator of and former
lead dancer in "Riverdance." Now let me
ask you a question: Do you consider him to
be a sweaty, ugly man? No, of course you
don't. You think of him as a sweaty, ugly
man who can dance.
You see, not only can dancing increase
your sex appeal, but it can also give you a
god-like aura. Shedding his former stage
persona as the Lord of the Dance, Flatley is
now planning his new dance production /
Am Dance Christ. The self-proclaimed
Holy Trinity of Dance is a self-proclaimed
sensation.
In spite of his divine nature, Flatley is not
without emotion. When he was fired from
the "Riverdance" show, Flatley momentar
ily doubted his own awesome powers as an
immutable dance force. How did he regain
his faith in himself? With an affected Irish
accent, the native Chicagoan describes his
resilience to adversity:
"Sure, I was upset at first, but then my
father called me and said, 'Look inside
yourself, Michael. You created "River
dance," you created beauty, you created the

world in seven days. People will always love
you for that.' And you know, he was right. I
am Dance Christ."
While the American-bred, Irish
obsessed dancer is already an acclaimed
performer, the rumor is that the National
Geographic Society is planning to declare
Michael Flatley's chest a living treasure.
You can learn more about this modest fel
low at his unassuming site: www.lord
ofthedance.com. The site is worth exploring
and is pretty funny. I mean, it's not "ha ha"
funny, but it is "ha ha ha" funny.
Should I get a job right after college?
No. A friend of mine quit his job and
retired a few months ago. One day during
his lunch break, he had gone for a drive and
found himself at the estuary near the Oracle
Corporation's towers. He sat there looking
out at the birds picking around in the mud.
Trained by the Stanford Department of
Economics, his mind suddenly reverted to a
basic mode of thought: "Are these birds
better than me? They are not forced to sit in
a cubicle all day taking orders from some
under-educated manager. They find food.
They find a place to sleep. They are free.
Why don't 1 get to do that?" It was as
though the Oracle of Redwood Shores was
giving him spiritual guidance. Go to
www.SilveradoAuto.com/Tony/poetry/ for
further direction in life.
How do I lead a good life, and is today a
good day to grow a mustache?
This question is the easiest to answer. A
friend of mine has a Web site that
describes how to lead a noble and virtuous
life and indicates which days are good days
to grow a mustache. Go to www.stan
ford.edu/~aphrimer/ and all will be
revealed.

What should I do if I find myself watching
too much TV?
With the plethora of quality programs
available to us, it is easy to spend too much
time in front of the tube. Sometimes I will
sit down at 6 p.m. with the intention of
watching a little Comedy Central, and next
thing I know it's 4:30 a.m., all my house
mates have gone to bed and I'm catching
tears in an empty wine bottle while Wesley
Snipes gives a bat to a kid with leukemia. I
don't really have a URL to go with this bit,
so here's one I found in a magazine:
www.marlboro.com.
Is voice dictation software practical?
Funny use wood ask. I write my column
ing you sing the eye be hem Via Voice soft
ware. I usually spend quiet habit of time
going back to edited mistakes it makes, but
here is some unchanged text. Find out more
about this great tack knowledge eat at
www.ibm.com.
Where are you going with this?
This one's from my editor. He is an inter
esting fellow. You can learn about his
Lithuanian roots and his interest in social
ism by going to his home page at www.stan
ford.edu/~kemezis/.
Whew! That wraps it up. I wager that
most of you will not visit any of the Web
sites I have mentioned, but you really
should if you want to get the most out of this
column.

Eugene Park, a master's student in philoso
phy, admits that he does not actually like
microwaveable burritos. "They sound
funny," he admits, "but I don't eat them."
