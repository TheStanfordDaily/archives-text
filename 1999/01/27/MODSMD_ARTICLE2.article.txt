# Ombudsperson's office releases annual report
## 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
Stanford ombudsperson Ellen
Waxman never tires of listening to
people complain. This year, she lis

tened to almost 250.
An ombudsperson advocates for
accepted norms of decency, fairness
and adherence to the letter and spir
it of Stanford policies. Any staff, stu
dent or faculty member can bring
problems to the office and receive
confidential advice and assistance.
Yesterday, Waxman released the
office's report for this year. The of
fice didn't release a report last year,
so this one contains information
about the past two years.
"It's really a description of the of
fice, but contains information of
what we saw over the past two years:
who came into the office and what
concerns and problems they
brought," said Waxman.
There were 310 visitors to the om
budsperson's office in 1996-97, 128
of whom were staff. The next largest
group was students, with 90 visitors.
According to Waxman, an equal
number of graduate and undergrad
uate students seek help.
Fewer people visited the office in
1997-98, with 115 staff and 75 stu
dents making up most of the 242 vis
itors.
Any concern can be brought to
the ombudsperson, and in both 1996-

97 and 1997-98 the most common
type of concern was "general."
"A general concern is one that re
lates to anyone in the University,
such as civility or discrimination,"
said Waxman.
In 1996-97 there were more per
sonnel concerns than academic,
while in 1997-98 there were more
academic than personnel. Both
years, student life made up the
smallest number.
Some examples of problems
brought to the ombudsperson in
clude situations where a "graduate
student wonders whether and how
to discuss a disagreement with an ad
visor," or when a student feels a hold
placed on their registration is unfair.
The concerns brought to the of
fice over the past two years range
from academic performance to fac
ulty conduct to benefits to housing.

Both in 1996-97 and in 1997-98 the
No. 1 concern has been
supervisor / management conduct.
People most often complained
about their supervisor or adminis
trative officer, followed by profes
sors. The majority of problems were
resolved, either by visitors them
selves or by the ombudsperson.
Most people approach the office
by meeting with the ombudsperson,
but telephone calls are popular as
well. The ombudsperson can be
reached by e-mail or letter or by vis
iting the office's Web site.
The office provides a wide range
of services, usually involving discus
sion and advice. The second most
common service is helping people
obtain information, followed by re
ferrals and intervention.
"Many people come in here and
feel overwhelmed and unsure what
to do. We can sit down and discuss
options Our power is far-reach
ing," said Carmen Jevons, the assis
tant to the ombudsperson.
