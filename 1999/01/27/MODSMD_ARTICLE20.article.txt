Alumnus warns SLE revisions
will corrupt its effectiveness
I am a Stanford graduate from the Class of
1980 and am writing this open letter to
Professors (Harry] Elam and [Ramon]
Siildivar to respond to reports of proposed
changes in SLE.
From the moment 1 was accepted into
Stanford until this very moment, my edu
cational and related experiences have
always been a great source of pride for me.
In return, I have tried to stay close to the
University throughout the past two
decades in whatever ways possible.
For example, when Stanford sent out
stall to Chicago area phone fundraisers in
past years. I would almost invariably
attend (and am proud that for two years in
a row I raised more pledges than any other
participant). I've also written personal
checks over the past several years (though,
if the truth be told, there won't be a
Garmisa chair endowed in the near
future). I've been active in the Chicago
alumni recruiting organization, have
helped arrange a speech at Stanford by a
former U.S. Senator and have returned to
the Farm on a few occasions.
For my regular "fix," I try to visit The
Stanford Daily's Web site a few times
weekly just to find out what's happening
on campus. So, it was with a great deal of
alarm that I read the Jan. 25 letters from

current SLE students protesting proposed
changes to SLE's program as well as the
follow-up news article in the Jan. 26 edi
tion. As a member of one of SLE's first
voyages (76-77), I feel compelled to add
a few personal observations about my
experiences in the program and my reac
tions to the proposed changes.
Put simply, SLE was, without any
doubt whatsoever, the intellectual high
light of my entire academic career and
remains the foundation of some of my
most enduring friendships in life. When
Forrest Fleischman wrote of a glowering
professor who introduces 17- and 18-year
olds to Palo Alto with the welcoming
words that SLE intends to systematically
challenge all their preconceived notions
and beliefs, I couldn't help but smile. I,
too, heard that admonition along with my
classmates. Some snickered. Some quiv
ered. Some yawned. All, however, were
subjected to a rigorous, year-long intellec
tual exercise that, indeed, lived up to its
billing. The long-term result has been an
unyielding bent toward intellectual open
ness to new ideas and a shared fondness
among most all SLE grads for one anoth
er and the program itself.
The SLE de- and reconstruction pro
cess results from a variety of factors: the
breadth and depth of the reading list; the
residential 24 / 7 aspects of the program
and the community environment fostered

by the scheduling flexibility that allows all
sections to meet at the same time; and the
quality and diversity of the teaching staff
(which has remained remarkably stable
throughout SLE's existence), bolstered by
their insistence on the integrity and clarity
of one's thoughts and writing skills.
At its core, SLE's success derives in
large part from its extensive reading list,
which, I understand is one of the central
criticisms leveled against the program by
the Area One Governance Committee.
For the life of me, I fail to understand why
the committee would favor drastic reduc
tions for a nine-unit survey course. To
paraphrase Leo Feler's letter on Jan. 25,
SLE students sample literature, culture,
philosophy and religion from different
eras and regions. They then can bookmark
those precise topics that interest them for
subsequent, further study. The commit
tee's proposal to slash SLE's reading list
would destroy one of the most important
components of the program.
I am also deeply troubled by the pro
posal to eliminate part-time lecturers. The
net effect of this change would be to
destroy the long-standing program flexi
bility which allows all sections to meet at
the same time. Fracturing SLE's schedule,
I fear, would weaken the camaraderie and
community environment fostered by the
program. Some of my fondest SLE memo
ries involve group discussions and argu

ments around the dinner table at Flo Mo
with faculty. To threaten the program's
outside-the-classroom learning compo
nent, in which SLE and non-SLE students
participate, is to undermine its essence.
Furthermore, I am confused by Profes
sor Saldfvar's comments that SLE instruc
tors should be limited to full-time Stan
ford faculty. Such a requirement would
seriously impede SLE's broad objectives
and would remove one of the most stabi
lizing elements of the entire curriculum.
Professors, I simply would add, if it
ain't broke, don't fix it.
You've heard from current, and now
former, SLE students. I am quite certain
that if other SLE grads were aware of the
proposed changes, there would be a
firestorm of protest â€” which leads me to
inquire, if current students stand behind
the existing program, and if those who
went through it almost 25 years ago are
perhaps even more protective, just what is
motivating the committee's wrecking ball
approach?
As I said at the outset, my strongest
connections to Stanford arise from that
program. I would be deeply saddened, and
offended, if those ties were weakened by
some ill-conceived committee recommen
dations.
