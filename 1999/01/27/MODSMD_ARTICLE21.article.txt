# Deep Thoughts
## Brittney Jensen Everything I need to know, I learned at Stanford 
### 
THAI S NOI REALLY true but it
sounds good. Get out your hankies —
this is my last column. Although it is
only January, please indulge me as I present
a sappy, cliche-ridden graduating senior col
umn.
I've learned that even though I feel like
I m monumentally old, I'm not. I've proba
bly lived less than a quarter of my life.
1 here s a long road before I'm over the hill.
Besides, I can always lie about my age and
pretend I'm 15,
I ve learned that the future is scary but
manageable. When I graduated from high
school I was sure I'd peaked in terms of the
lun and happiness I could find. I viewed life
beyond high school parties, sports and proms
as an indefinable void. But 1 managed to
reconfigure my life in an exotic location
(Stanford) and find new events to anticipate
and work towards. As I contemplate the
unstructured chaos I'll enter after gradua
tion, I know it will someday make sense.
I've learned that I'm not as heinous-look
ing as my brothers and certain guy friends
used to tell me 1 was. Or I'm competing with
an uglier pool here at Stanford. I choose to

believe the former.
I've learned that people change. Some
students, like cheese, improve with age,
growing more confident, outgoing and gen
erous each year. Others regress to junior high
mentality. The popularity games and superfi
ciality you expected everyone to outgrow as
you left seventh grade continued through
high school, through college and will proba
bly be played by at least some of your peers
for the rest of your life.
I've learned that most girls are skinnier
than they think they are. Eating is a lot more
fun than obsessing about food.
I've learned fraternities can be the set
tings of either sketch-fests or good (almost)
wholesome fun, depending on your attitude.
But the bathrooms always smell really bad.
I've learned we're a lot better than UCLA
in basketball (see "Maples Massacre," Jan. 9,
1997, and also Feb. 11, 1999). Plus we don't
throw beverages on the court.
I've learned that people who act like
they're smarter than you usually aren't. Peo
ple who come off as drunken fools are often
geniuses.
I've learned I have more things to be

grateful for than I can ever count. Cookie
dough, pickles and nacho cheese are yummy.
I've learned that guys are sexiest when
they're sincere and nice. But having wash
board abs also helps.
I've learned that what I truly believe tran
scends family, location and social context.
I've learned that even apparently boring
people can be really funny if you're both in
the right mood.
I've learned that it's good to make plans,
but almost nothing turns out like you expect.
My junior year I planned to go on a Midwest
dance tour fall quarter, return to schtw>l win
ter quarter and study in Jerusalem spring
quarter. Instead I interned at a clothing com
pany fall quarter, went on a Rocky Mountain
dance tour winter quarter, and lived in Rin
conada spring quarter. And that's exactly the
way things should have been.
I've learned when the Stanford Band says,
"You're not my friend if you don't drink,"
they don't mean it. Extreme silliness, alco
hol-induced or otherwise, is all you need to
enjoy a napless, song-filled road trip.
I've learned that when I used to get in vio
lent fights with my brothers and sisters and

my parents told me that someday I'd realize
my siblings were my best and truest friends,
they were right.
I've learned that first impressions are usu
ally wrong. The annoying dork who puked
all over the second floor during Orientation
and the snotty girl who seemed ridiculously
shallow might end up being your best friends.
I've learned that people can be really
mean. Strangers will hate you for no appar
ent reason. People you know and deeply
trust can disappoint you by being MIA or
even cruel when you need them the most.
I've learned that people can be really nice.
If you're observant you'll notice random acts
of kindness everywhere, such as strangers
taking the time to send you encouraging e
mails or acquaintances secretly washing your
car at three in the morning.
I've learned that falling in love rocks
beyond belief. Finding someone you think is
the most amazing person ever and realizing
he feels the same way about you is an inde
scribably awesome experience. Listen to
REO Speedwagon or Chicago for more
details.
I've learned that losing love is extremely

painful. The accompanying emptiness and
loneliness feel almost unbearable, but you
can finally understand the blues.
I've learned that I'm strong enough to sur
vive heart-breaking losses. Without a hurt
the heart is hollow.
I've learned that it's easy to fall into self
pity. You can convince yourself you're
unlucky and untalented compared to your
overachieving classmates. Some people seem
to get everything they want. But look closely
and you'll realize those you envy have their
own poopy problems to deal with.
I've learned that it's easy to get bitter and
cynical as you get older and experience cru
elty and disappointment. But there's nothing
too horrible to laugh at.
I've learned that just because something
sounds really cheesy, it doesn't mean it can't
be true.

the right mood.
I've learned that it's good to make plans,
but almost nothing turns out like you expect.
My junior year I planned to go on a Midwest
dance tour fall quarter, return to schtw>l win
ter quarter and study in Jerusalem spring
quarter. Instead I interned at a clothing com
pany fall quarter, went on a Rocky Mountain
dance tour winter quarter, and lived in Rin
conada spring quarter. And that's exactly the
way things should have been.
I've learned when the Stanford Band says,
"You're not my friend if you don't drink,"
they don't mean it. Extreme silliness, alco
hol-induced or otherwise, is all you need to
enjoy a napless, song-filled road trip.
I've learned that when I used to get in vio
lent fights with my brothers and sisters and

my parents told me that someday I'd realize
my siblings were my best and truest friends,
they were right.
I've learned that first impressions are usu
ally wrong. The annoying dork who puked
all over the second floor during Orientation
and the snotty girl who seemed ridiculously
shallow might end up being your best friends.
I've learned that people can be really
mean. Strangers will hate you for no appar
ent reason. People you know and deeply
trust can disappoint you by being MIA or
even cruel when you need them the most.
I've learned that people can be really nice.
If you're observant you'll notice random acts
of kindness everywhere, such as strangers
taking the time to send you encouraging e
mails or acquaintances secretly washing your
car at three in the morning.
I've learned that falling in love rocks
beyond belief. Finding someone you think is
the most amazing person ever and realizing
he feels the same way about you is an inde
scribably awesome experience. Listen to
REO Speedwagon or Chicago for more
details.
I've learned that losing love is extremely

painful. The accompanying emptiness and
loneliness feel almost unbearable, but you
can finally understand the blues.
I've learned that I'm strong enough to sur
vive heart-breaking losses. Without a hurt
the heart is hollow.
I've learned that it's easy to fall into self
pity. You can convince yourself you're
unlucky and untalented compared to your
overachieving classmates. Some people seem
to get everything they want. But look closely
and you'll realize those you envy have their
own poopy problems to deal with.
I've learned that it's easy to get bitter and
cynical as you get older and experience cru
elty and disappointment. But there's nothing
too horrible to laugh at.
I've learned that just because something
sounds really cheesy, it doesn't mean it can't
be true.
