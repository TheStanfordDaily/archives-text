## TRACK & FIELD INDOOR SEASON PREVIEW Women's team looks to move up Indoor season will help prep team for outdoor competition 
### Barry Cooper Contributing writer 
After the start of the indoor
track season last weekend in Reno,
the Stanford women's track and
field team has just five more week
ends of competition. In less than a
month the Cardinal will be defend
ing its back-to-back titles at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Championships in Reno, a
team-scored competition in which
seven Pacific 10 Conference
schools, among others, are en
tered. After that those women that
have qualified will head to Indi
anapolis for the NCAA Indoor
Championships on March 5 and 6.
Compared to the outdoor sea
son, which lasts more than twice as
long, the indoor season seems little
more than a warm-up. Yet, head
coach Vin Lananna doesn't intend
to just gloss over the opportunities
to fine-tune his athletes.
"We view the indoor season as
an extension of the outdoor sea
son," said Lananna.
"Our approach to the indoor
season is different from the out
door. Outdoors, we pull out all the
stops. In the indoor season, if a
runner isn't completely ready to
go, she just won't compete.
"Of course we have a goal of

winning the Mountain Pacific
Championships, which we have
won the last two years; we want to
win every meet. We would also like
to bring as many competitors as
possible to the national meet."
If all goes as planned, the Cardi
nal should have no problems
achieving Lananna's goals. With
the addition of new talent, as well
as the strong base of athletes al
ready here, the team looks poised
to bring home the MPSF title as
well as improve its placing at the
national meet from last year's 21st
place finish.
Key to its successes not only at
the MPSF meet, but also at Indi
anapolis, will be the jumpers and
vaulter on the squad. Tops among
the group is senior heptathlete
Tracye Lawyer. While the hep
tathlon is not held in indoor com
petition, Lawyer excels in the long
jump, high jump and may even see
some sprinting action. Her
achievements include a third-place
finish in the high jump at the in
door NCAAs in 1997, a ninth
place finish in that event last year,
as well as the silver medal at last
year's outdoor NCAAs in the hep
tathlon.
Lawyer's training partner for
the heptathlon is junior Julie Tin
ker. Competing in similar events to

Lawyer, Julie's contributions will
be vital at the MPSF meet. Along
with Tara Oettinger, who had a
personal best in the long jump with
a jump of 19 feet, eight inches last
weekend. Tinker is on the verge of
crashing the national meet.
Hoping to become a fixture on
the national scene is pole-vaulter
Melissa Feinstein. After coming
off an outstanding freshman sea
son where she placed fourth at
both the indoor and outdoor
NCAAs, Feinstein is ready to
move up into the top three spots at
nationals to provide big points for
the Cardinal.
While the throwers on the team
may not have the national-level
credentials of the jumpers, winning
the MPSF without them would be
a struggle. Leading the group will
be Cassie Romuld, the team's best
shot-putter, along with Maggie
Issac, Summer Pierson and Mau
reen Onyeagbako. All four of the
athletes are potential scorers in
both the shot put and the 20-pound
weight throw at the MPSF meet.
Romuld won the shot put at the
event in 1997.
In the sprints and hurdles, the
Cardinal will look to its youth for
support. Redshirt sophomore
Wilsa Charles, sophomore
Danielle Spurlock and junior

Jayna Smith, along with heptath
letes Lawyer and Tinker, will pro
vide the main firepower in the 55-
400 meter range. All potential
MPSF scorers, they welcome
freshman Robyn Woolfolk to the
mix this season. Woolfolk showed
last weekend with her third-place
finish that she intends to make an
immediate impact in the 55-meter
hurdles.
The area where Stanford is
known to have an abundance of
talent, middle and long distance, is
perhaps Stanford's strongest
group again. Cynthia Morman, last
year's fifth-place Pac-10 finisher,
leads a strong 800-meter core in
cluding senior LaShawndra Pace
and a host of freshmen including
Malindi Elmore, Maurica Carlucci
and Colleen Flaherty. The three
freshmen are also likely to race in
the mile.
The heart of the distance crew is
made up of Julia Stamps, Sally
Glynn, Mary Cobb and Sarna Ren
fro. All four athletes are scoring
possibilities at the national meet
with Stamps, Glynn and Renfro
likely to compete in the 3,0(X) and
Cobb to take the 5,000. Their ac
complishments are endless, but
each athlete has received at least

Sophomore Julia Stamps, a three-time Ail-American (twice for
cross-country, once for track), leads a strong Cardinal contingent
as the team looks to move up in indoor competition.
