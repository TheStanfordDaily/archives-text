# Men's squad strong once again
## Veteran distance corps paces Cardinal this season 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Indoor track is about to start turning
heads on the Stanford campus.
A sport that has gone largely unher
alded in the past is hack in a big way, and
this year's team is poised to equal, if not
better, the standard set by last year's
squad which nabbed a second-place tro
phy at the NCAA indoor meet.
And though head coach Vin Lananna
insists that the indoor season is as much
a preparation tool for the outdoor cam
paign as anything else, the very tangible
opportunity to capture Stanford's first
national championship of the year is
enough to quicken the pulse of any Stan
ford sports fan.
"Indoor is a means for preparation
for a good outdoor season, and that's
what we use it for," said Lananna. "But
it is also a great opportunity for many of
our athletes to compete on the national
level."
Last year's squad made a run for the
indoor title, relying on the strength of its
distance running corps. This year,
Lananna takes a more evenly balanced
squad into battle.
Of course, veteran leadership will be
vital to the success of the Cardinal. For
that, Stanford looks to last year's NCAA
indoor 5,000-meter champion Brad
Hauser, among others. Joining him in
the distance ranks are brother Brent
Hauser, who also scored in the 5,000 at
the national meet last year, and Jo
nathon Riley, who captured fourth place
in last year's indoor mile championship.

Senior Nathan Nutter and junior
Michael Stember will help solidify this
group, while sophomore Gabe Jennings'
injury status has left his indoor season in
question.
"For the distance guys, indoor is a
good time to make sure everyone is race
ready when the outdoor season comes
along," said Riley.
"But indoors, everything is on a
smaller scale and everything seems to
happen just a little quicker. The venues
might be small, but the intensity is
through the roof."
Other key players with national meet
experience include perennial threat
Adam Connolly in the weight throw and
last year's outdoor pole vault champion
Toby Stevenson.
New blood on the Stanford squad will
also infuse some vitality into this battle
machine. Prize recruit Michael
Ponikvar. who has a personal best high
jump of seven feet, four inches, has the
rare opportunity to bolster Stanford's
national hopes immediately.
Add last year's California state 800-
meter champion Jonathan Stevens, a
one minute, 48.65 second half-miler, and
George Curts, a national-caliber shot
putter as a freshman, and the results are
inevitable.
"We'll have a lot of help where we
might not have had it in the past." said
Lananna. "A guy like [freshman] Evan
Kelty, who was the Oregon state champ
in the 200 and 400 meters, can help us be
really very strong."
Stanford's football connection could
also play a key role in the Cardinal's sea

son success.
With such gridiron greats as Troy
Walters and Willie Howard lending
their talents on the oval and in the
throwing rings, Stanford only bolsters its
potential for indoor dominance.
"We've had a very positive relation
ship with the football people." Lananna
said. "The training helps them, and of
course good throwers, good sprinters,
good speed — that's going to help us."
Although chances for team competi
tion are few and far between during the
indoor season, the late February Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation meet will
serve as a conference finale as the ma
jority of the Pacific 10 Conference
schools will combine with the Big West
Conference in a championship-style
competition.
On March 5, under the lights of the
RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Ind., those
individuals who have met the national
qualifying standards will converge on
the 2(X)-meter track to represent their
schools and contend for the NCAA in
door national title.
Capturing that title might not be
Lananna's top priority. Nevertheless,
the fact remains that Stanford's indoor
squad, recently ranked No. 2 in the
Trackwire polls behind '98 champ
Arkansas, is a contender.
"Our men's track team will be very,
very good this year," Lananna said. "I
don't know if that will equate to us doing
better at the NCAA meet, but we will
have a better all-around team than even
last year."
