# Men's horse polo hits muddy wall against UC-Davis

Polo: The weather once again wreaked
havoc upon the Stanford horse polo teams
when both the men and women traveled to
UC-Santa Barbara to duel the Gauchos
last weekend.
The men fought gallantly Saturday, bat
tling not only the weekend storms, but also
a Gaucho squad sitting atop the West Re
gional Conference.
In what was described as a "really fast
game," by women's polo member Brandy
Moses, the Gauchos showcased too much
offense for the Cardinal to keep pace. De
spite being on the short end of a 25-4 score,
the men "rode well, and never gave up on

the match," Moses said. Three of the Car
dinal's four goals were awarded on penal
ties, while the fourth came on a penalty
shot by Jon Russell.
After the loss to Santa Barbara, the men
fall to 2-3 overall, and 2-3 in the West Re
gional. They find themselves in the thick of
a battle for seeding positions leading into
the upcoming West Regional tournament,
just over a month away.
While the men battle it out in the middle
of the pack, the women control their own
destiny with a 5-0 record in conference,
good enough for sole possession of first
place and a first-round bye in the West Re
gional Tournament. However, they lost a
chance to add to their lead when their Sun

day match against the Gauchos was can
celed due to excessive rain on Saturday
night.

CLUB SPORTS

Both teams resume play this weekend at
home, as the men take on USC, while the
women play an exhibition match against
Stanford Polo Alumni. Both matches will
be held at Cteta Horse Park, which is locat
ed at the top of Sand Hill Road.
Ice Hockey: The Stanford men's ice hock
ey team, coming off a successful weekend
trip to Los Angeles, hopes to continue its
push toward the playoffs when it goes

against UCLA Friday and Saturday at the
Ice Oasis in Redwood City.
The Cardinal, led by senior Tom Ter
bell's two goals, defeated USC 5-3 last Fri
day. On Saturday, Stanford emerged with a
2-1 victory thanks to the stellar goaltending
of Sami Jo Small, who made over 30 saves
in holding the Trojans to just one goal.
"We played really strong last weekend.
Hopefully it will carry over into this week
end against UCLA," said sophomore D P.
Buck.
After the weekend's sweep, the Cardi
nal, now 6-10 on the season, finds itself in
the hunt for one of the four playoff berths
given to the Pacific Eight Conference. This
weekend's contests with UCLA will go a

long way towards determining the Cardi
nal's fate in the tight playoff chase.
After the two matches with UCLA, the
Cardinal faces a California squad that has
what Stanford wants, a spot in the Pac-8
playoffs, due to a provision granting an au
tomatic bid to the host. The Thursday and
Friday home-and-home series represents a
chance for Stanford to join the Bears in the
playoffs, while also putting a hurting on
their cross-bay rivals.
Lacrosse: The Stanford men's lacrosse
team gets one last warm-up this weekend
with a home scrimmage against Sonoma
State before season play gets un
derway on Feb. 6. The men, after
winning the only tournament they
entered in the fall, at Chieo State,
arc looking forward to a successful
season.
Led by senior captains Benton
Williams, Brian Auld and Brian
Puskas, the Cardinal is hoping to
start its season off on the right
note. Optimism is high for the up
coming season though, due to the
emergence of a strong freshman
recruiting class.
"We've got some excellent
rookies, especially on defense,"
said sophomore Paul Koh.
One week from Saturday the
Cardinal's official season begins
with a trip to Chico State, as Stan
ford returns to the site of its fall tri
umph.
