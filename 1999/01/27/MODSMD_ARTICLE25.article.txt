## U.S. drug may relieve HIV burden in Africa and India 
### Joanne Wu Contributing writer 
Stanford researchers have intro
duced the possibility of using pro
tease inhibitors, the primary drugs
used in HIV therapy in the United
States, as treatment for HIV strain
C, the most common form of the
virus in the world.
Subtype C of HIV affects mil
lions of people in India and Africa,
causing 90 percent of all new infec
tions worldwide, while subtype B is
more common in the United States
and Europe. Until now, most HIV
research, including the design of
protease inhibitors, has focused
upon subtype B, leaving it unclear
whether the HIV drugs could be
applied to other viral subtypes.
According to Robert Shafer,
clinical assistant professor of
medicine, the protease inhibitor was
selected as a candidate drug against
strain C because it affects a highly
conserved protein in the virus —
despite mutation, the protein
remains part of the virus.
Along with the reverse transcrip
tase gene, the protease gene is one
of the most constant regions in the
virus. Thus, the reverse transcrip
tase and protease proteins are most
frequently targeted in drug thera

pies. ITiese proteins differ by only
10 to 12 percent among the different
subtypes, whereas other regions are
far more variable, such as the enve
lope proteins, which can differ by
about 30 percent.
Shafer and his colleagues tested
blood samples from African
patients infected with HIV C to
determine whether that version of
HIV would respond to protease
inhibitors. David Katzenstein, asso
ciate professor of medicine and the
senior author of this study, also per
formed laboratory investigations
confirming that subtype C was high
ly sensitive to treatment by the HIV
drugs.
The study found that although
the virus has evolved during its
spread, it has not mutated enough
to escape current drug treatments.
But even with the knowledge that
protease inhibitors can aid people
suffering from HIV C, the problem
remains that most of people in
underdeveloped countries cannot
afford the treatment, which costs
between $2,000 and $4,(KX) a year.
"Current drugs are too expensive
to be practical in underdeveloped
countries right now," said Shafer.
"For other problems in those coun
tries . . . like tuberculosis and
water-borne diseases, there have

not been funds available, even
though there are effeetive treat
ments for those diseases [that arej
less expensive than for HIV," he
said.
Katzenstein is planning to study
how to intervene in a cost-effective
way in Africa. Countries south of
the Saharan desert account for the
world's highest rates of HIV in
adults aged 15 to 49 years. Of the 30
million people worldwide infected
with HIV, 21 million live in Africa.
Katzenstein has established a
research base in Zimbabwe, where
one-quarter of all adults are infect
ed with HIV. In his new treatment
program, he will use two reverse
transcriptase inhibitors, AZT and
nevirapine, on HIV-infected
women and their infants.
In a previous statement, Katzen
stein said that 5 to 10 percent of
mother-to-child HIV transmissions
occur during breast feeding. In the
study, 100 mothers will receive AZ T
before and during delivery, and the
infants will receive nevirapine at
regular intervals while they are
being breast fed.
The protease inhibitors can also
be tested for effectiveness against
the other eight subtypes of HIV.
This knowledge would be beneficial
for countries that can afford the

expensive drugs, since different
strains do arise occasionally.
As another possible alternative
to the expensive drugs against HIV.
Shafer proposed the idea of devel

oping a vaccine, which might he
more practical.
For-now. their research in pro
tease inhibitors is making headway
towards treating HIV globally.

"I think that we'll find that drugs
work against worldwide strains.
There is the bigger issue of getting
those drugs to the people who need
it," Shafer said.
