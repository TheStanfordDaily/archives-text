# Stanford's biggest fan
## John Bravman loves the Farm 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
Stanford Materials Science Prof. John
Bravman wears many hats. Undergraduates
may know him as the professor who teaches
Engineering 50, the introductory course of
materials science. Others consider him an
advisor, in his role as the senior associate dean
for student affairs in the School of Engineer
ing. Those passionate for determining the
stresses and strains of materials may know
him as chair of the Materials Science Depart
ment. or perhaps as the former president of
the Materials Research Society. And some
long-time faculty still think of Bravman as a
student they taught here over 20 years ago.
Bravman may be Stanford's biggest — and
most diligent — fan. He received his bache
lor's in 1979, his master's in 1981, and his doc
torate in 1984 — all Stanford degrees in mate
rials science.
"I've been here 23 and a half years," Brav
man said in an interview yesterday."I expect
to be here for my whole career."
In September of 1975, Bravman took his
first-ever plane ride to fly from New York to
Stanford, although the Farm had not original
ly been his first choice.
"One of the best things that ever happened
to me was that I wasn't accepted by MIT." he
said. "Stanford's been so gixnJ to me."
Bravman admits that it was not always
smooth sailing for him at Stanford — his first
years as an undergraduate were a struggle. "1
wasn't prepared for the rigor of academics."
he said. "I didn't work in high school at all."
Discovering a new major may have helped
hone his academic focus. Ironically, it was
Engineering 50, the same course he has been
teaching to undergraduates for years, that first
attracted him to the field of materials science.
He switched over from electrical engineering

without knowing what he was getting into.
The risky decision ended up being a fortu
itous one. When a job opening in materials
science was posted during Bravman's fifth
year as a graduate student, James Plummet,
now the chairman of the electrical engineering
department, suggested that he apply. Brav
man was happily surprised when he was grant
ed the post. "I couldn't believe it."he said.
Despite uncountable hours spent develop
ing research in his field, working with the
Materials Research Society and serving on
numerous university committees, Bravman
still manages to make teaching a priority.
"I worked very hard on my teaching," he
said. "I love working with students."
T his hard work has been acknowledged
many times through numerous teaching
awards. In 1997, Bravman was named the
Bing Centennial Professor, an honor awarded
to one professor every few years. In 1989,
prior to receiving tenure, he received Stan
ford's highest award for teaching, the Walter
J. Gores award.
Bravman's peers warned him that this
recognition as a great teacher might preclude
him from getting tenure — he had devoted
too much time to teaching and not enough to
research. Two years later, he learned he had
nothing to worry about.
"My most memorable moment was when I
was able to tell my E5O class I was granted
tenure." Bravman said. After the announce
ment, he received a long standing ovation
from his students. "It was one of the finest,
warmest feelings I've ever had," he said.
John Bravman seems to be made of one of
those strongest materials that he brags about
in E5O. He devotes unbelievable amounts of
time and energy to Stanford and its students.
" This is not a job," Bravman said. "This is
in many ways my life. It is an immense privi
lege."
