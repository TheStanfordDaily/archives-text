# Making the best of a difficult situation
## Diabetic students learn to cope with disease 
### Tracy Jan Senior staff writer 
Kate Burch entered Stanford knowing
she would develop a lifelong disease,
although she had not yet developed any of
its symptoms. During a routine physical
before her freshman year. Burch tested
positive for the diabetes antibody. The
onset of diabetic symptoms arrived sooner
than she and her doctors expected —just
three weeks after she moved into Branner
Hall.
"I was in denial," said Burch, who
began experiencing extreme thirst and fre
quent urination. "No one in my family has
it. I thought it was stress-related."
Burch sought out dormmate Mike
Karnes, also a diabetic, for help. I le tested
her blood sugar for the first time by prick
ing her linger and inserting a blood-stained
strip into a glucose meter, a machine that
calculates blood sugar content. Burch's
first test read IW milligrams of glucose per
deciliter, but two days later, it had soared
to 370. Normal blood sugar levels fluctuate
between 70 and 110 milligrams of glucose
per deciliter of blood, and a diagnosis of
diabetes is made when it hits 240.
"It was really weird," she said. "In one
day, I just started being diabetic. But of all
the chronic life-altering illnesses you can
get. this is the one to get because it's man
ageable, and you can live with it. Mike was
such a pillar of strength for me."
"It was a pleasure to welcome her to the
family," said Karnes, who was diagnosed
with Type 1 diabetes his freshman year of
high school. Karnes, a junior, even
attributes "fringe benefits" to the disease.
"It forces me to eat healthy, exercise and
be in good shape, take care of myself and
not drink too much alcohol."
Now a junior, Burch has lived with
Type 1 diabetes for almost three years.
Each day. she injects insulin into her stom
ach or leg four times — once before each
meal and again before going to bed at
night. In addition to regular exercise, she
also eats three square meals and monitors
her blood sugar level.
"I never want to feel pitied because of
my disease," Burch said.
Over winter break, Burch ran her first
marathon in Honolulu, Hawaii for the
Leukemia Society after training for more
than three months.
"That's what really gave me perspec
tive," said Burch, who was sponsoring a 5-
year-old girl with leukemia. Throughout
the race, Burch tested her bUxxl sugar and
wore a waist pack brimming with food.
"I said I was going to do this in spite of
this disease," she said. "I wanted to prove
to myself that I wasn't any less healthy."
Approximately 5(X),000 to 1 million
Americans have Type 1 diabetes, accord
ing to the American Diabetes Association.
Also called immune-mediated diabetes.
Type I is typically diagnosed in children or

young adults. The body destroys the pan
creas cells that produce insulin, a hormone
that enables cells to take glucose out of the
bloodstream and use it for energy. Without
insulin, the body cannot control blood lev
els of sugar, leading to death. Today, shots
are the only way to effectively administer
insulin to the body.
Type 2, a far more common form of dia
betes. usually starts after age 30. The onset
of Type 2 is more gradual, and it tends to
occur in obese people. Because blood
sugar levels are more stable, insulin injec
tions are usually not necessary for Type 2.
Type I diabetes often appears suddenly.
Signs and symptoms include high levels of
sugar in the blood and urine, frequent uri
nation. extreme hunger and thirst, weight
loss, weakness and tiredness, mood swings
and vomiting. Common problems are
hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, and
hyperglycemia, high blood sugar.
Hypoglycemia can be corrected by eat
ing sugar, such as hard candies, or drinking
fruit juices or soda. Low blood sugar levels
result in lightheadedness, sweating, inco
herence, confusion, dizziness, headache
and blurry vision. Conversely, chronic high
blood sugar can result in blindness, ampu
tation and kidney problems.
Though diabetes can be inherited, this
is not always the case. Controlled by
insulin and a healthy lifestyle. Type I dia
betes is no longer life-threatening. Insulin
is derived from pig or human DNA and
comes in bottles. Rather than injecting
themselves with needles, some diabetics
choose to wear an insulin pump, a beeper
sized machine that hooks into the body
through a small needle inserted into the
abdomen. The pump slowly drips insulin
into the body throughout the day.
Some diabetics aren't as lucky as Burch,
whose condition is relatively stable. Since
every diabetic reacts differently to the dis
ease. no single formula exists to control it.
Senior Rahwa Cihebremichael experi
ences the bumpy ride of hypoglycemia and
hyperglycemia daily — her blood sugar
soars and dips, making it difficult for her to
predict how much insulin to take.
Though she noticed a marked differ
ence in her energy level between high
school and freshman year at Stanford.
Cihebremichael was not diagnosed with
Type 1 diabetes until the summer before
her junior year. Sick for weeks at a time,
she felt unable to get out of bed and even
passed out in the library freshman year.
After losing 20 pounds in a year, she
entered the emergency room with a blood
sugar level higher than 600.
"The nurse said it was amazing I wasn't
in a coma." she said, 'it was a blessing to
finally attach a name to my symptoms. For
two years. I watched myself slowly break
down physically without explanation. I was
definitely the only person in my house who
was happy (at the time of diagnosis)."
A double major in biology and Corn

parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity,
Ghebremichael plans to attend medical
school.
"Diabetes has done a lot for me," she
said. "It's given me a greater appreciation
for health. It's taught me that I have limits,
which is the hardest lesson for anyone to
learn. And it's taught me that it's okay to
ask for help."
Like Burch, Ghebremichael worries
about friends and acquaintances making
assumptions and judgments once they
know about her disease. "It's been a con
stant struggle," she said. "People need to
have some sort of sensitivity for people
going through rough periods of their lives,
no matter what it is."

The key to controlling diabetes, accord
ing to Terman snack bar manager Renee
Hofer. is balancing exercise, food intake
and insulin. Hofer, 45. was diagnosed with
diabetes at IX. Before the glucose meter
was invented, Hofer tested her blood sugar
by running pH paper beneath a stream of
urine. The test was inconvenient and
extremely inaccurate, she said.
"Now. with the invention of new types
of insulin and other technology, we have
more flexibility with our lives." Hofer said.
Current research is investigating oral or
inhaled insulin, implanted pumps, nonin
vasive glucose monitoring and pancreas
transplants. Future inventions may
include using lasers to test blood sugar lev
els, monitoring blood sugar through sweat
with a wristwateh-type contraption and
taking insulin in pill form.
Regardless, most diabetics say they feel
lucky for what they have. "It's such a bless
ing because there are other diseases out
there that are so much worse." Ghe
bremichael said. "It's one of those illnesses
where you could look at it.and it's like the
glass is half empty or half full."

also eats three square meals and monitors
her blood sugar level.
"I never want to feel pitied because of
my disease," Burch said.
Over winter break, Burch ran her first
marathon in Honolulu, Hawaii for the
Leukemia Society after training for more
than three months.
"That's what really gave me perspec
tive," said Burch, who was sponsoring a 5-
year-old girl with leukemia. Throughout
the race, Burch tested her bUxxl sugar and
wore a waist pack brimming with food.
"I said I was going to do this in spite of
this disease," she said. "I wanted to prove
to myself that I wasn't any less healthy."
Approximately 5(X),000 to 1 million
Americans have Type 1 diabetes, accord
ing to the American Diabetes Association.
Also called immune-mediated diabetes.
Type I is typically diagnosed in children or

young adults. The body destroys the pan
creas cells that produce insulin, a hormone
that enables cells to take glucose out of the
bloodstream and use it for energy. Without
insulin, the body cannot control blood lev
els of sugar, leading to death. Today, shots
are the only way to effectively administer
insulin to the body.
Type 2, a far more common form of dia
betes. usually starts after age 30. The onset
of Type 2 is more gradual, and it tends to
occur in obese people. Because blood
sugar levels are more stable, insulin injec
tions are usually not necessary for Type 2.
Type I diabetes often appears suddenly.
Signs and symptoms include high levels of
sugar in the blood and urine, frequent uri
nation. extreme hunger and thirst, weight
loss, weakness and tiredness, mood swings
and vomiting. Common problems are
hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, and
hyperglycemia, high blood sugar.
Hypoglycemia can be corrected by eat
ing sugar, such as hard candies, or drinking
fruit juices or soda. Low blood sugar levels
result in lightheadedness, sweating, inco
herence, confusion, dizziness, headache
and blurry vision. Conversely, chronic high
blood sugar can result in blindness, ampu
tation and kidney problems.
Though diabetes can be inherited, this
is not always the case. Controlled by
insulin and a healthy lifestyle. Type I dia
betes is no longer life-threatening. Insulin
is derived from pig or human DNA and
comes in bottles. Rather than injecting
themselves with needles, some diabetics
choose to wear an insulin pump, a beeper
sized machine that hooks into the body
through a small needle inserted into the
abdomen. The pump slowly drips insulin
into the body throughout the day.
Some diabetics aren't as lucky as Burch,
whose condition is relatively stable. Since
every diabetic reacts differently to the dis
ease. no single formula exists to control it.
Senior Rahwa Cihebremichael experi
ences the bumpy ride of hypoglycemia and
hyperglycemia daily — her blood sugar
soars and dips, making it difficult for her to
predict how much insulin to take.
Though she noticed a marked differ
ence in her energy level between high
school and freshman year at Stanford.
Cihebremichael was not diagnosed with
Type 1 diabetes until the summer before
her junior year. Sick for weeks at a time,
she felt unable to get out of bed and even
passed out in the library freshman year.
After losing 20 pounds in a year, she
entered the emergency room with a blood
sugar level higher than 600.
"The nurse said it was amazing I wasn't
in a coma." she said, 'it was a blessing to
finally attach a name to my symptoms. For
two years. I watched myself slowly break
down physically without explanation. I was
definitely the only person in my house who
was happy (at the time of diagnosis)."
A double major in biology and Corn

parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity,
Ghebremichael plans to attend medical
school.
"Diabetes has done a lot for me," she
said. "It's given me a greater appreciation
for health. It's taught me that I have limits,
which is the hardest lesson for anyone to
learn. And it's taught me that it's okay to
ask for help."
Like Burch, Ghebremichael worries
about friends and acquaintances making
assumptions and judgments once they
know about her disease. "It's been a con
stant struggle," she said. "People need to
have some sort of sensitivity for people
going through rough periods of their lives,
no matter what it is."

The key to controlling diabetes, accord
ing to Terman snack bar manager Renee
Hofer. is balancing exercise, food intake
and insulin. Hofer, 45. was diagnosed with
diabetes at IX. Before the glucose meter
was invented, Hofer tested her blood sugar
by running pH paper beneath a stream of
urine. The test was inconvenient and
extremely inaccurate, she said.
"Now. with the invention of new types
of insulin and other technology, we have
more flexibility with our lives." Hofer said.
Current research is investigating oral or
inhaled insulin, implanted pumps, nonin
vasive glucose monitoring and pancreas
transplants. Future inventions may
include using lasers to test blood sugar lev
els, monitoring blood sugar through sweat
with a wristwateh-type contraption and
taking insulin in pill form.
Regardless, most diabetics say they feel
lucky for what they have. "It's such a bless
ing because there are other diseases out
there that are so much worse." Ghe
bremichael said. "It's one of those illnesses
where you could look at it.and it's like the
glass is half empty or half full."

Kate Burch entered Stanford knowing
she would develop a lifelong disease,
although she had not yet developed any of
its symptoms. During a routine physical
before her freshman year. Burch tested
positive for the diabetes antibody. The
onset of diabetic symptoms arrived sooner
than she and her doctors expected —just
three weeks after she moved into Branner
Hall.
"I was in denial," said Burch, who
began experiencing extreme thirst and fre
quent urination. "No one in my family has
it. I thought it was stress-related."
Burch sought out dormmate Mike
Karnes, also a diabetic, for help. I le tested
her blood sugar for the first time by prick
ing her linger and inserting a blood-stained
strip into a glucose meter, a machine that
calculates blood sugar content. Burch's
first test read IW milligrams of glucose per
deciliter, but two days later, it had soared
to 370. Normal blood sugar levels fluctuate
between 70 and 110 milligrams of glucose
per deciliter of blood, and a diagnosis of
diabetes is made when it hits 240.
"It was really weird," she said. "In one
day, I just started being diabetic. But of all
the chronic life-altering illnesses you can
get. this is the one to get because it's man
ageable, and you can live with it. Mike was
such a pillar of strength for me."
"It was a pleasure to welcome her to the
family," said Karnes, who was diagnosed
with Type 1 diabetes his freshman year of
high school. Karnes, a junior, even
attributes "fringe benefits" to the disease.
"It forces me to eat healthy, exercise and
be in good shape, take care of myself and
not drink too much alcohol."
Now a junior, Burch has lived with
Type 1 diabetes for almost three years.
Each day. she injects insulin into her stom
ach or leg four times — once before each
meal and again before going to bed at
night. In addition to regular exercise, she
also eats three square meals and monitors
her blood sugar level.
