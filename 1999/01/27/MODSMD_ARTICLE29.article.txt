Francois Ortalo-Magne suggests
that housing market fluctuations are
largely determined by the income of
young buyers, such as recent Stan
ford graduates entering the work
force.
Rady and Ortalo-Magne ana
lyzed census and housing data col
lected in the United States and the
United Kingdom between 1965 and
1996.
"The literature on real estate is
full of good data sets," Rady said.
"What our paper tries to do is pro
vide a simple theory that can help us
make sense of some of the findings
of the existing literature."
Rady and Ortalo-Magne's model
rests on observations of the chang
ing behavior of housing consumers
as they grow older. Young people
tend to first rent and then purchase
their first home. The researchers'
data revealed that first-time buyers,
usually in their late 20s to early 3()s,

tend to spend about 75 percent as
much as repeat buyers, usually in
their forties.
The U.S. data also indicated that
after trading for better homes one or
more times, some consumers then
begin to move into smaller houses,
apartments or condominiums as re
tirement and empty nests obviate
the need for larger homes.
The size of the down payment
necessary also affects the ability of fi
nancially strapped young buyers to
purchase their first or second home.
Since the majority of home buyers
do not receive monetary help from
relatives, the size of capital gains
from previous property investments
can be an important factor in deter
mining whether young buyers can
afford down payments on more ex
pensive properties.
The researchers also used the
data to speculate about how devel
opments in the business cycle affect
young consumers' actions in the
housing market. "We were pleased
that we now had a nice hypothesis
why current income should matter at
all — namely through the borrowing

capacity of younger households
climbing up the property ladder."
As real estate prices fall in re
sponse to a slow-down in an eco
nomic boom, young homeowners
experience smaller capital gains.
This results in fewer consumers with
the ability to trade up and transac
tion volume falls off. Prices continue
to fall as the economy dips into a re
cession. Eventually, the majority of
homeowners will have purchased
properties at low prices and can con
sequently afford to look for more ex
pensive housing. Thus, the housing
market is revitalized by greater sales
just as the recovering economy dri
ves real estate prices back up.
"Transaction volume appears to
lead the business cycle by four to five
quarters," Rady said. "By looking at
volume we may be able to make
some educated guesses about how
the housing market will evolve in the
near future."
Dan Lorimer. a Palo Alto real es
tate broker and Stanford MBA,
agreed that young people do influ
ence the Palo Alto housing market
indirectly. "Much of the market here

is clearly driven by high technology,
and that high technology is a young
people's business."
However, Lorimer was quick to
add that Palo Alto contains a "very
unrepresentative group of young
people, because they have more
money than most."
Eric Ruxton, president of Ter
race Associates Inc., a mid-peninsu
la real estate firm, also observed that
young people in Palo Alto had un
usually high incomes for their age.
"There aren't many properties
that are affordable for young buyers
[with moderate incomes]," Ruxton
said. He attributed this shortage to
lack of growth in the Palo Alto hous
ing market. "There's no new build
ing to speak of; that's what keeps the
prices so high," he explained.
Ruxton also noted that the aver
age Palo Alto down payment, as a
percentage of purchase price, is
higher than those in most areas. Ac
cording to Rady and Ortalo-
Magne's theory, this may be another
reason the Palo Alto housing market
is not kind to young buyers with av
erage incomes.
