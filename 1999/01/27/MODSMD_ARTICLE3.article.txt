# Committee to start search for provost
## 
### Anuj Gupta Contribution writer 
A committee composed of Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and 11 faculty, staff and student
members will begin meeting next
week with the mission of finding a
provost to replace Condoleezza
Rice, who is leaving her post in June
and taking a leave of absence from
Stanford.
The committee is aiming to
make its final recommendation of a
candidate to Casper by the begin
ning of next quarter.
" The President is on record with
the Faculty Senate as saying that he
would hope that the process could
be complete by the beginning of
spring quarter, but there's no guar
antee that that will happen," said
Business Prof. George Parker, a
committee member.
According to committee mem
ber and Chemistry Prof. Bob Way
mouth, the committee will be look
ing for someone who is well ac
quainted with the University to
serve as its new chief academic and
financial officer.
"We want someone with a good

sense of the strengths of the institu
tion ... that is, what Stanford does
well, and a sense also of what Stan
ford doesn't do so well," Waymouth
said.
The exact process for the com
mittee's search will be laid out in
next week's meeting. At that time,
the committee will also establish a
list of qualities that it is looking for
in provost candidates.
However, Business Prof. George
Parker outlined the committee's
basic planned procedure. "We will
probably accept nominations, ex
amine a nominee's credentials and
then compare them with the con
sensus we arrive at about require
ments [for a provost]," he said.
Although Parker declined to list
specific criteria at the moment, he
did say, "We want to find the most
capable person that there is to take
on what is clearly one of the critical
jobs in the academic enterprise that
is Stanford."
ASSU President Maren Norton,
who is also on the committee, de
scribed what she is looking for in a
candidate.
"I hope to find a person who has
a strong academic background, but

is available, responsible, accessible
to students, faculty and members of
the community," she said. And,
"someone who's perceptive of
what's going on around campus,
and has the ability to analyze the
wide array of programs that take
place in this community," she con
tinued.
Norton pointed to graduate stu
dent issues as a key area that she
would like the new provost to focus
on. "[The new provost] must make a
permanent commitment on the part
of the University to increase, im
prove and enhance the quality of
life for grad students There's a
lot further to go," she said.
Casper said earlier that he be
lieves the committee will make its
selection from within the Stanford
community, although "an incredi
bly attractive candidate from the
outside" would be considered.
Waymouth said that he feels no
extra pressure to select a female or
minority provost to replace Rice, a
black woman.
"I think Condi was a great
provost, which is not correlated to
either of those characteristics. I'd be
delighted if we could find [a woman
or a minority], but I think the most
important thing is to find the right
person for the job," Waymouth said.
Norton echoed this sentiment.
"I'll be looking for the best and most
qualified candidate. I think Con
doleezza Rice served as a role
model in many ways, and I would
look to find someone who would
serve as a role model similarly as she
has," she said.

The committee is chaired by
Casper along with Developmental
Biology Prof. Lucy Shapiro.
Other faculty members on the
committee are Parker, Waymouth,
Education Prof. Linda Darling-
Hammond, Assoc. Drama Prof.
Harry Elam, Law Prof. Deborah
Hensler, Geophysics Prof. Amos
Nur, and Industrial Engineering
Prof. Elisabeth Pate-Cornell.
The committee also includes
staff member Peggy Hiraoka of
Human Resources.
Students are represented by Nor
ton, as well as linguistics doctoral
student Emily Bender.
