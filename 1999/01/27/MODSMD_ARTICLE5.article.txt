# In the Senate chamber: Mills defends Clinton

Cheryl Mills is still too young to run
for president, but is old enough to
defend one.
The 33-year-old member of the
Class of 1990 last week was one of
the first White House lawyers, and
the first woman, to defend President
Clinton in his Senate impeachment
trial.
Mills, a deputy White House
counsel and Clinton administration
veteran, emerged from behind the
scenes to speak before the Senate
last Wednesday. Since then, her
image has appeared on the front
pages of The New York Times, the
San Jose Mercury News, on C
SPAN, CNBC and elsewhere.
The Boston Globe reported that
Mills' appearance disrupted the trial
status quo of white male attorneys,
causing Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott to initially introduce her

as "Mr. Counsel" before correcting
himself.
Former professors and class
mates glowingly remember Mills as
an extraordinary student, "one of
our best debaters," a quiet person
who was meticulous in her work and
passionate about civil rights.
What set her apart from her
peers was her concern for the less
fortunate," said Law Prof. Miguel
Mendez, who taught Mills first-year
criminal law.
At Stanford, where she was elect
ed to the Law Review, she was one
of nine African-American students
in a class of 175. She was instrumen
tal in bringing the third national con
ference on Women of Color in the
Law to Stanford for the first time.
After two years as an associate
with Hogan and Hartson, a Wash
ington, D.C. law firm. Mills joined
the Clinton transition team. This
was in 1992, when Mills was only 27.
