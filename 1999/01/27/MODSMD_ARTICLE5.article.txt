# In the Senate chamber: Mills defends Clinton
##

Cheryl Mills is still too young to run
for president, but is old enough to
defend one.
The 33-year-old member of the
Class of 1990 last week was one of
the first White House lawyers, and
the first woman, to defend President
Clinton in his Senate impeachment
trial.
Mills, a deputy White House
counsel and Clinton administration
veteran, emerged from behind the
scenes to speak before the Senate
last Wednesday. Since then, her
image has appeared on the front
pages of The New York Times, the
San Jose Mercury News, on C
SPAN, CNBC and elsewhere.
The Boston Globe reported that
Mills' appearance disrupted the trial
status quo of white male attorneys,
causing Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott to initially introduce her

as "Mr. Counsel" before correcting
himself.
Former professors and class
mates glowingly remember Mills as
an extraordinary student, "one of
our best debaters," a quiet person
who was meticulous in her work and
passionate about civil rights.
What set her apart from her
peers was her concern for the less
fortunate," said Law Prof. Miguel
Mendez, who taught Mills first-year
criminal law.
At Stanford, where she was elect
ed to the Law Review, she was one
of nine African-American students
in a class of 175. She was instrumen
tal in bringing the third national con
ference on Women of Color in the
Law to Stanford for the first time.
After two years as an associate
with Hogan and Hartson, a Wash
ington, D.C. law firm. Mills joined
the Clinton transition team. This
was in 1992, when Mills was only 27.

Law School alumna Cheryl Mills argues in President Clinton's de
fense before the U.S. Senate last week.
Today, Mills, lauded for present
ing the defense for Clinton, ranks
high in the White House counsel's of
fice, in no small part due to her loyal
ty to Clinton, former professors said.
"I had been telling her for years
that she should leave that office if she
wanted to go into criminal defense
work," said Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock. who mentored Mills as one of
the few law students who had an in
terest in defense law.
The picture of poise and confi
dence, Mills closed Wednesday's ar
guments by calling upon the Senate
to remember Clinton's civil rights
record in the face of accusations that
he perjured himself before a grand
jury in the Paula Jones case.
"I stand here before you today be
cause President Bill Clinton believed
I could stand here for him,"' Mills
said in her low, clear voice. "I'm not
worried about civil rights, because
this president's record on civil rights,
on women's rights, on all of our
rights, is unimpeachable," she said.
Both her arguments and her eth
nicity drew flak from conservative
critics, who accused the defense of
"playing the race card."
" They don't understand Cheryl
â€” she's about social justice," said
Renee Glover, a 1991 Stanford Law
alumna who now works with the East
Palo Alto Community Law Project.
Glover also helped Mills organize

the conference on Women of Color
in the Law. "[lt goes to show that]
race is still an issue today," Glover
said. "She is one of the fairest people
1 have ever worked with."
Rhonda Reaves, a professor at
Loyola Law School of Los Angeles
who graduated from Stanford Law in
1991, agreed with Glover.
"Comparisons to Johnnie
Cochran are inevitable, [but] I was
surprised that people brought [race]
up," she said. "People like to throw
that charge around."
According to Mills, Clinton did
not willfully obstruct justice by al
legedly ordering his secretary, Betty
Currie, to hide gifts he had given to
former intern Monica Lewinsky.
Rather, he sought to "manage a
looming media firestorm which he
correctly foresaw" and "put right
what he had done wrong."
Mills, "a self-described army
brat," according to Babcock, spent
her childhood in many different
countries. She earned her bachelor's
degree in economics and philosophy
from the University of Virginia.
Understandably, Mills could not
be reached to comment on the trial,
her Stanford experience or what her
future holds. Mendez guessed that
she is working 12 to 16 hours a day,
seven days a week. Her colleagues
from her Stanford days hold great ex
pectations for her.
"There are great things ahead for
her," Glover said. "She's one of
those people who will have the luxu
rv to name her ticket."
