## Econ prof to assist in Microsoft case 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
Within a shroud of secrecy, the
Department of Justice has asked
Economics Prof. Timothy Biesna
han to develop plans for limiting
Microsoft's monopolistic practices,
called "remedies," should the gov
ernment prevail in its antitrust case
against the software company.
The Justice Department is ac
cusing Microsoft of pushing out
competitors using bribery and
force, particularly by building its
Internet browser into Windows 98,
Bresnahan refused to comment
since the Microsoft trial is still in
process. However, his colleagues
understand that he will leave in
June and spend a year in Washing

ton, D.C. As the chief economist
for the antitrust division, he and his
team of 40 to 50 experts will advise
Justice Department antitrust chief
Joel Klein.
"Klein has asked a number of
individuals to obtain information
to assist the department with ana
lyzing various options in response
to violations in the Microsoft case,"
a justice official in Washington
said.
"Tim Bresnahan is a good
choice to be on this team because
of his depth of experience in ana
lyzing the economy of the comput
er industry," the official said.
"Tim is unusual among econo
mists in the way he combines in-
depth empirical work with knowl
edge and interest in the practical
side.
"When Tim looks at a situation,
not only does he look at the latest
economic theories, he also has
knowledge of the industry," said
Erik Brynjolsson, an MIT econom
ics professor who is spending this
year at Stanford and who has
worked on research with Bresna
han for several years.
Economics Prof. Gregory

Rosston said the work will he chal
lenging. "It's incredibly difficult to
craft remedies. It will take a lot of
time and thought to create compe
tition without eviscerating incen
tives. It's a difficult balancing act to
do," he added.
However, Rosston, who teaches
an antitrust class, believes that
Bresnahan will meet the challenge.
"He has the ability to relate, to
motivate, to make his point to the
lawyers he needs to convince,"
Rosston said.
"You can't just be smart, you
have to be politically savvy and
make people want to listen to you.

He combines those two skills."
According to Brynjolsson, com
ing up with remedies involves "bal
ancing competing interests and in
centives for innovation and creat
ing technology and making sure
consumers are getting a fair share
of benefits."
Brynjolsson complimented
Bresnahan's understanding of the
unique computer industry, where
"there is a rapid pace of innovation
with strong economies of scale. In
cumbent firms have an advantage,"
he said.
For example, Brynjolsson ex
plained that because Microsoft's

Windows operating system is so
widespread, new companies write
their software to make it compati
ble with it.
"Even if the technology isn't su
perior, people use it because it's
what everyone else has," Brynjols
son said.
"Tim understands a lot of spe
cial characteristics of the industry
and combines that with cutting
edge theories," Brynjolsson added.
Bresnahan's position as chief
economist is "a really great oppor
tunity to apply research in econom
ics to real world problems,"
Rosston said.
