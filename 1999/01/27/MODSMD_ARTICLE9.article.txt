Any student who has ever
worked out at Roble Ciym, taken
advantage of resources offered by

admired the well-kept beauty of
the Dunn-Bacon house on May
field Avenue should remember the
generosity of Rosamond Clarke
Bacon. Last Wednesday. Bacon

"Rosamond, by virtue of length
of time on campus and commit
ment to Stanford, means a great
deal to this institution's history,"
explains University Archivist Mag
gie Kimball. "She cared a lot about
the Stanford community which in
cludes the students, faculty and
staff alike."

Until last spring. Bacon resided
on campus in the Dunn-Bacon
house at 565 Mayfield Avenue and
occasionally served lemonade to
students jogging up the Row. Last
spring, when she moved out, the
house was bought by the Universi
ty-
Her son, Charles Bacon, who
lived in the house on Mayfield in
his youth, remembers his mother
working around the house.
"She would often be tending
roses outside and strike up conver
sations so she got to know many
people, including many University
presidents."
Born in Ventura, Calif., Bacon
enrolled at Stanford in 1926 and
quickly became involved in
women's athletics and other
women's activities.
During her senior year she was

elected to Cap and Gown, the
women's honor society, and served
as president of the Women's Ath
letic Association. Bacon persuaded
the men's athletic hoard to build
Roble Gym for women by leading
protests on campus.
In 1930, Bacon graduated with a
bachelor's degree in history; she re
turned to Stanford to earn her mas
ter's degree in 1932.
After a few years teaching in
Ventura and serving as the director
of a women's dormitory at Scripps
College in Claremont, Calif., Mrs.
Bacon again returned to Stanford
and went on to serve as director of
several women's dormitories in
cluding Roble Hall and Lagunita
Court.
In her capacity as a dormitory
director. Bacon often chaperoned
student dances, where she became

acquainted with Mathematics Prof.
Harold Bacon, her future husband.
The two were married in 1946.
Throughout her life. Bacon re
mained constantly active in the
Stanford community. She was an
active figure in Cap and Gown and
is one of only three women hon
ored with a named Cap and Gown
scholarship â€” U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is
another.
Her commitment to the preser
vation of campus history led her to
suggest the creation of the Stanford
Historical Society, which was
formed in 1976.
"She was a familiar character
around campus and a very gregari
ous, friendly and unselfish
woman," concludes her son.
"She was wacky about Stan
ford."
