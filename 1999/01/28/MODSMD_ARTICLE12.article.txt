Hundreds of Jordanians crowded
into a hilltop palace to pay respect
to their new crown prince
Wednesday as anxiety grew ewer
the health of King Hussein, who
has suffered a relapse of cancer.
The demonstration of support
for Prince Abdullah — which
included the king's brother, who
was removed as crown prince
Tuesday — underlined Jordani
ans' hopes that any transition of
power will be smooth in the king
dom. a nation poor in resources
and at the crossroads of a turbu
lent region.
The United States quickly sig
naled its support for the king's
decision to appoirt the 36-year

old heir to the throne.
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright decided to stop in Jordan
on Thursday to meet the new
crown prince.
"We will stand by Jordan and
hope this transition is one that
does not create problems," she
said in Cairo, Egypt.
Hussein had abruptly returned
to the United States on Tuesday
for medical treatment.
The Mayo Clinic in Rochester.
Minn., announced Wednesday the
king was in 'stable condition" but
had suffered a relapse of lymphat
ic cancer after undergoing six
months of chemotherapy.
"He is receiving treatment for a
relapse of non-Hodgkins lym

phoma," said a statement issued
on behalf of the king's doctors.
Sources in Jordan, speaking on
customary condition of anonymi
ty. said Hussein might undergo a
second stem cell transplant to try
to fight the disease.
The heavy turnout underlined
the support for Hussein's decision
to remove Hassan, who lacks Hus
sein's charisma.
Prince Abdullah has so far tried
to avoid any possible rift with his
uncle. In a letter to his father,
Abdullah hinted that he will main
tain warm relations with Hassan.
" The Hashemites are my family
and the source of my pride and I
intend to keep love, mercy, self
lessness ... amongst us," he said.
