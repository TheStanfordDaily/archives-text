TOKYO (AP) — After a long clay at the office,
Noriuchi Ito is ready to boogie — with a relentless,
demanding partner who always takes the lead.
Like countless other young Japanese, Ito has suc
cumbed to the latest dance craze sweeping the nation
— an electronic arcade game called "Dance Dance
Revolution" that could change the look of arcades
worldwide.
For $1.75. players climb onto a lighted platform
and dance with a computer-generated partner, trying
to match their footwork to arrows on a 29-inch
screen. The partner does his own. completely differ
ent, thing.
Music, mostly '70s disco stuff, pumps at the play
ers' feet, while a sensor underneath the platform
monitors whether they are stepping up, down, left or
right, and keeping time with the rhythm.
"Perfect! Great!" the screen flashes in sold letters

when a player is doing well. "Boo!" it proclaims for
missteps.
"Dance Dance Revolution" can also be played in
pairs, with dancers standing side-by-side on the plat
form and dancing in sync. Advanced players create
"DDR teams," choreographing complex routines in
which dancers switch off on a single machine.
"It's pretty hard." said 18-year-old Mio Tazoe, a
first-time dancer.
Part of the reason for the machine's success is the
growing popularity of dance in Japan. Kids practice
hip-hop routines on the streets and their parents
head off to the studio for ballroom dance or salsa
lessons.
But Chika Nomura, a spokeswoman for game
maker Konami Co.. said "Dance Dance Revolution"
is part of a broader trend in arcade entertainment:
games that allow players to show off and draw
crowds.
Sitting alone in front of a video screen is passe.
