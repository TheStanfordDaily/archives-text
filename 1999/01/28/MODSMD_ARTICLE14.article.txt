# Senate approves witnesses
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Republican-controlled Senate
blocked dismissal of the impeach
ment case against President Clinton
yesterday and then voted for new
testimony from Monica Lewinsky
and two other witnesses — but by
margins well short of the two-thirds
that would be needed to oust the
president.
In a pair of roll calls in a hushed
Senate chamber, all 55 Republicans
voted against dismissal and for the
witnesses opposed by the White
House. They were joined by a sin
gle Democrat. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin.
"The president will not be
removed from office," Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle
declared moments later in com
ments swiftly seconded by the
White House. "For the good of the
country and in keeping with the
Constitution it is now time to end
this trial."
Even before the votes, Daschle
and Majority Leader Trent Lott
were at work trying to fashion a
bipartisan agreement for the bal
ance of the trial, including video
taped depositions of Ms. Lewinsky,
presidential friend Vernon Jordan
and White House aide Sidney Blu
menthal.
At one point, Lott floated a

timetable that envisioned six-hour
depositions, a Senate vote next
week on whether to proceed with
live testimony and a final vote on
the articles of impeachment — all
within nine days. The only difficul
ty, he suggested, would be if the
White House wanted witnesses of
its own.
Democrats scoffed, noting that
Republicans had forced the trial on
a party line vote in the House, then
had voted to keep it alive in the
Senate when it was clear Clinton
would be acquitted in the end. By
their votes on the floor of the Sen
ate, said Sen. Carl Levin of Michi
gan, the GOP is "pushing us deeper
and longer" into a trial now in its
third week.
White House lawyers have
warned repeatedly that calling any
witnesses would mean protracted
delays to allow for time for a review
of documents thus far withheld
from the president's team. But in a
prepared statement he read to
reporters in a Senate corridor. Spe
cial Counsel Gregory Craig omitted
any mention of a drawn out process
consuming many months.
"Today's events made clear that
the votes are not there to convict
and remove the president from
office," he said. Sixty-seven votes
would be needed. Any further pro

ceedings "run counter to the best
interests of the Congress, the presi
dency and the American people,"
Craig said.
Democratic sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said
that under one course of action
under discussion the White House
would not seek to delay the deposi
tions with a demand for extensive
preparation time. Only if one of the
witnesses made a new disclosure
that was potentially harmful to the
president's case would they insist
on a review of evidence thus far
kept from them.
Feingold was the only lawmaker
of either side to cross party lines.
He issued a statement saying his
vote against dismissal "should not
be interpreted as a signal that I
intend to vote to convict the presi
dent."
The votes on Wednesday
capped days of maneuvering over
the volatile witness issue. House
prosecutors, who originally had
hoped to depose a dozen or more
key figures in the sex and cover-up
scandal reduced their list to a "piti
ful three," in the words of their
leader. Rep. Henry Hyde. That was
to allow Lott to hold Republicans in
line at a time when many are eager
to end a trial that remains unpopu
lar with the public.
