# Olympic fraud investigated

WASHINGTON (AP) —Fed-
eral investigators scrutinizing the
Salt Lake City Olympic scandal are
searching for evidence to bring a
bribery prosecution in which both
bribers and recipients could be
charged, federal officials say.
Federal prosecutors and agents
are looking at mail and wire fraud
and conspiracy statutes and a rack
eteering law to prosecute what they
initially see as a case of commercial
bribery, rather than the more famil
iar government variety, the officials
said Wednesday.
The Justice Department normal
ly lets private parties resolve com
mercial bribery cases through civil
lawsuits rather than bringing a fed
eral criminal charge. The exception
is when a federal interest is
involved, like the integrity of the
Olympic Games.
The racketeering law prohibits
interstate and foreign travel to fur
ther federal or state crimes like
bribery and extortion or to dis
tribute their illicit proceeds.
Also under study are tax, curren
cy transfer and foreign bribery
statutes that might provide addi
tional charges, according to these
Justice Department officials, who

spoke on condition of anonymity.
But the federal probe is in a very
early stage — months from key
decisions about what charges to
bring or whether to file charges.
Federal agents are still trying to
understand the records they sub
poenaed from Salt Lake City's
Olympic bid committee. Stephanie
Pate, one-time secretary of former
bid committee head Tom Welch,
has been meeting with agents this
month.
Meantime, four members of the
International Olympic Committee
have resigned over the scandal.
Kenya's Charles Mukora, who
resigned Wednesday, was among
six members expelled Sunday fol
lowing revelations of corruption in
the bidding. Others remain under
investigation.
The lOC said Salt Lake City's
2(X)2 bid committee spent $8(X),(XX)
on 14 lOC members, including trav
el expenses, scholarships for their
children and cash payments.
The basic case under investiga
tion is whether Salt Lake's commit
tee paid bribes to lOC members to
win the 2(X)2 Winter Olympics. Fed
eral mail and wire fraud charges
could be brought if someone used

the mails or phones to "defraud the
International Olympic Committee
of the honest services of its mem
bers," one Justice official said.
Any Olympic decision-maker
who took a bribe also could be vul
nerable to being charged with
defrauding the international panel
of his or her honest service — hon
est service meaning a vote for a site
based on its merits rather than on
under-the-table payments, this offi
cial said.
If more than one person were
involved, then prosecutors could
charge a conspiracy to defraud the
Olympic Committee.
A federal statute known as
ITAR. for interstate travel in aid of
racketeering, is also a potential
charge because it criminalizes inter
state and foreign travel to promote
bribery and extortion schemes that
violate federal or state laws, one
official said. This statute could
apply to bribe givers or takers.
If evidence showed illicit pay
ments began with and were the
product of pressure on Salt Lake
representatives from the Olympic
decision-makers, then the recipi
ents could be charged with extor
tion.
