Having extended Marguerite hours on
i weekends and evenings is definitely a step
v in the right direction. At a university
I where student government plays a rela
tively less active role, Norton and Marro-
have been able to deliver on key elec
tion promises that make noticeable differ
ences in student life.
During the address, Norton also talked
about the inauguration of "Midnight
Breakfast," a meal on the eve of winter
quarter Dead Week. This event will bring
together distinguished faculty and staff
with students right before the intense end
quarter period begins.
Even more surprisingly, Norton com
mented that this meal will be served to stu
dents by the faculty and administrators.
T his somewhat perplexing move appears
as an strained, albeit creative, attempt at
fostering interaction between faculty and
students.
Although this new event may help
some students relieve Dead Week stress,
we feel the ASSU should be concentrating
on issues that more directly effect day-to
day student life. For example, during the
elections last year, Norton and Marroquin

wrote in the Election Handbook that "all
elected ASSU officials will have mandato
ry office hours," but such improvements
have yet to be implemented and publicized
to students.
Still, Norton did mention that students
would soon be able to find out who their
representative is in the ASSU (either by
housing area or affiliated student group)
by searching on the ASSU Web site.
Hopefully, when this feature is implement
ed, students will take the opportunity to
find their ASSU senator, discuss impor
tant student issues and suggest improve
ments to campus life.
The ASSU should also be commended
for finding the resources to pay for fixing a
SURE Escort vehicle.
New ideas from noninvolved students
are crucial. No matter how diverse the
backgrounds of ASSU senators are, ideas
get stale, leaving the ASSU static and inac
tive. Norton and Marroquin's original pro
posals on direct representation will pro
vide an infusion of new ideas straight from
the student body.
In general, Norton and Marroquin have
effectively promoted student needs; they
moved from an Election Handbook cam
paign promise to "make the Marguerite
more beneficial to students" to bringing
about real change. Since mid-November,
many students without cars have been able
to enjoy dining out or exploring Palo Alto
on Friday and Saturday nights.
Now that Stanford has decided to per
manently fund "Midnight Express" hours
for the Marguerite, Norton has committed
to further expanding both the hours and
stops of the Marguerite.
Phis decision is again a step in the right
direction for Norton and Marroquin, the
ASSU and the Stanford community.
