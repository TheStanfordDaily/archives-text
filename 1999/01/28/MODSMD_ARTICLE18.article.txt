## You will always find me dreaming 
### 
People always
told me to set big
goals in life. "John
ny," they said, "set big
goals in life." So I did. I
had big dreams as a boy
(well, as a younger boy),
and decided I'd be a whole

bunch of things when I grew up. I would be
a pro baseball player. A writer. An actor.
President. The guy they pay to test video
games.
Pessimism, however, soon got the best of
me. I calculated the odds of actually achiev
ing my goals and found them pretty
infinitesimal. "Wake up," I told myself.
"You'll never realize these silly dreams.
You'll never be what you really want to be.
You'll never, ever, ever be a video game
tester."
Sigh. I couldn't even beat Super Mario
Brothers. Who was I kidding?
Oh, well. Even if my huge dreams never
come true, I suppose I can endure. I can live
without the 10 hours of Nintendo a day;
without huge baseball crowds cheering my
name as I strike out the side; without book
signings across the nation and my name
atop the bestseller list; without my image
splashed across the big screen (the camera
adds 10 pounds, anyway); without my face
splashed across the tabloids.
The White House adds 10 pounds, any
way.
Lately, however, I've been thinking. Yes,
there is a first for everything. Anyway, I
realized that here at this country club of a

school we call Stanford, I've probably met
people who will have (or have had) all the
above experiences and more. I've met base
ball players who will sign a major league
contract for a bazillion dollars in a couple of
years. I've written papers in the same class
as future authors (and had my grades, no
doubt, yanked down by comparison). I've
driven past the frat where that "Wonder
Years" kid lived. I'm sure Stanford will pro
duce another president or two (if not, I
know we'll have plenty of White House
interns, which is nearly good enough).
And, of course, we've got hordes of CS
programmers who'll sign on to some big-ass
computer firm, load up on stock options,
make a billion by the age of 24, then sit
around playing Nintendo all day.
Geeks.
Yes, of course I'm jealous. Shut up. Just
because I can't throw a ball 90 miles an
hour, can't write worth a damn (you should
see this column before the editors redo it),
won't ever pass a Hollywood screen test,
don't have much hand-eye coordination
(Nintendo), or don't have much hand-eye
coordination (president), it doesn't mean
I'm not special. It doesn't mean I'm not
deserving of love, affection, attention or
multi-million dollar endorsement contracts.
It doesn't mean I have to stop dreaming.
No way, Jose. Just like those people in
the "Rainbow Connection" song from that
crappy Muppet movie, this kid's a dreamer
(you know,"the lovers, the dreamers and
me, la, da da dee, da da da"). I'll keep my
faith alive. I'll keep my dreams from fading.

I'll keep calling the Yankees for a tryout. So
what if I don't achieve my childhood
dreams? I've plenty others to try to fulfill,
even if I end up with a desk job and a station
wagon. Life will go on, and I promise to
enjoy it.
And if it really gets late in the game,
maybe I can count on my family. I've heard
it's bad to live vicariously through your kids,
but I don't think I'd mind it too much. I
mean, it's one thing to force them into doing
things you never did, but it's OK for me to
enjoy the experiences they have on their
own, right? And, hey, if I'm lucky enough to
have kids, maybe I can have three or four.
Then I'll have a few more chances to relive
my dreams through them!
Ha, ha. Just kidding. I know that chil
dren are meant to be loved and nurtured,
not exploited for their youth. I promise not
to take advantage of my children or make
them figure skate.
Yes, I promise. Just as my life is my own
place to dream, I'll leave them to theirs.
They might not want to play baseball or
write books — and I know they won't want
to be President — but whatever they decide
is fine with me. I hope. Heck, I'll probably
have my own dreams to work on, anyway.
And once I retire, it's nothing but Nin
tendo, baby.
