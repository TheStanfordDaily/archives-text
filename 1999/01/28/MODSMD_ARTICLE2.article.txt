# Medical center refuses to deal with labor union
## 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
l JCSF-Stanford Health Care has
not recognized — and will not bar
gain with - University Professional
and Technical Employees, the union
to which some UCSF hospital work
ers belong. As a result, the National
labor Relations Hoard has issued a
complaint against UCSF-Stanford
Health Care.
Karen MacLeod. UCSF presi
dent of University Professional and
l echnical Workers, argues that
UCSF-Stanford Health Care won't
recognize the union because it vocal
ly opposed the merger of I J( SF and
Stanford I lospitals. which happened
oVer a year ago. MacLeod pointed
out that since the merger, all other
IJCSF unions have been recognized.

The company has also recognized
the newly formed union of hospital
support staff at Stanford I lospital.
"As of right now, the members of
UPTE have no union or bargaining
rights." MacLeod said.
"It was bad enough that patients
and taxpayers were betrayed by the
privatization of the UCSF hospital,
but then to add to it this protracted,
aggressively anti-employee strategy
really undermines the supposed in
tent of the merger." she said.
I ( SI-Stanford Health Care
spokesman Daniel Berman said.
"The situation is different now. At
the beginning, folks had the opportu
nity to join [recogni/ed unions|."
I JCSF-Stanford I lealth Care con
tends that they don't have to recoi>-
nize the union because it was orga
nized under the California Public
Employee Relations Board, instead
of the National Labor Relations
Board.
"All the other [UCSF] unions are
consistent with the National Labor
Relations Board guidelines,"
Berman said.
Since UCSF is a public, state
funded university, and Stanford is
private, different regulations apply to
employee unions, depending upon
the origin of funding.
"The situation is that there are dif
ferent rules for employees within
public institutions," said Berman.
"The National Labor Relations
Board has special regulations for hos
pitals, too — against containing too
many bargaining groups within one
hospital."
Law Prof. Bill Gould, who chaired
the National Labor Relations Board
from IW4 until recently, said that in
one instance, the board had ruled that

a public institution that privatizes
must recognize unions that were pre
viously organized. In cases where
bargaining units may overlap, howev
er, such as this one, nothing is clear.
"This is a very fact-specific situa
tion," Gould said.
The National Labor Relations
Board's complaint against UCSF-
Stanford Health Care follows the suc
cessful unionization of janitors, main
tenance workers, dietary food service
employees and nursing assistants at
Stanford Hospital and Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital last No
vember.
At the time, Stanford nurses were
already unionized, and 1, 1(K) other
Stanford employees belonged to the
same service employees' union that
the workers joined.
The move to unionize at Stanford
Hospital was inspired by the merger
and reflects a nationwide trend.
Tuesday's Wall Street Journal re
ported that union membership in
creased by 101,(XX) workers in 19y<S.
and a large chunk of these workers
are in health care and service indus
tries.
