## 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
l JCSF-Stanford Health Care has
not recognized â€” and will not bar
gain with - University Professional
and Technical Employees, the union
to which some UCSF hospital work
ers belong. As a result, the National
labor Relations Hoard has issued a
complaint against UCSF-Stanford
Health Care.
Karen MacLeod. UCSF presi
dent of University Professional and
l echnical Workers, argues that
UCSF-Stanford Health Care won't
recognize the union because it vocal
ly opposed the merger of I J( SF and
Stanford I lospitals. which happened
oVer a year ago. MacLeod pointed
out that since the merger, all other
IJCSF unions have been recognized.

The company has also recognized
the newly formed union of hospital
support staff at Stanford I lospital.
"As of right now, the members of
UPTE have no union or bargaining
rights." MacLeod said.
"It was bad enough that patients
and taxpayers were betrayed by the
privatization of the UCSF hospital,
but then to add to it this protracted,
aggressively anti-employee strategy
really undermines the supposed in
tent of the merger." she said.
I ( SI-Stanford Health Care
spokesman Daniel Berman said.
"The situation is different now. At
the beginning, folks had the opportu
nity to join [recogni/ed unions|."
