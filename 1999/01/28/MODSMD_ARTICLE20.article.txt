Bunnell release deserves
faculty investigation
Brian Eule's article in the Jan. 26 Daily
showed the need for a Faculty Senate inquiry
into the disconcerting release of John Bun
nell as associate dean and director of under
graduate admissions after 35 years of faithful
service.
Bunnell's release has been a hot forum of
discussion around campus and should be
considered an administrative faux pas. If a
professor of 35 years were to be released sud
denly from his or her position after a so
called "summer reorganization," a tenure
debate of massive proportions would result.
Yet. when a highly respected administra
tor is unprofessionally excused after no
wrongdoing, it is consider common restruc
turing.
Jessica lucker-Mohl reported (Jan. 12)
that Vice Provost James Montoya said,
"Given our limited resources, it is vital that
an organization be structured to take full
advantage of the available staffing."
1 find it difficult to believe that the experi
ence and knowledge of a 35-year veteran are
no longer considered a "vital" part of the
"available staffing" in such an important

department.
ITie need for an inquiry into this matter is
further strengthened by Bunnell's strong
relationship with his former coworkers and
the students on campus. I commend Bunnell
for his maturity in this debacle, but the stu
dents and faculty must stand strong when
one of its own is not given his due justice.

Wrong attitude persists
Mitchell Kimbrough's letter in Friday's
(1/22) issue of the Daily was one of the most
candid I have read on the paper. More
important, it is a personal testimony that any
Stanford official monitoring student life
should take seriously, for it exposes patterns
of behavior accounting for the rigid emotion
al interaction between students at this uni
versity.
To me in particular, it generated a few dis
turbing thoughts. First, that frankness and
impulsiveness are penalized virtues in
"Hochkultur" environments, where posture
and predictable behavior minimize career
dangers for hard-driven and often viciously
ambitious students.
Second, that the experience of feminism

seems not to have changed even intelligent
women in demanding the glamorous, old
fashioned, slow-developing and male-initiat
ed flirtation, a greasy bag full of gross lies,
exaggerations and flattery: the princess syn
drome still persists.
Third, that the powerful and sinuous sec
ular fundamentalism (one example of which
we have been witnessing for a year now in
what Gerhard Casper called "that mess in
Washington") has spread a blanket of sup
posedly lofty principles to which we have to
adhere even at the expense of everyday real
ity, eventually reducing ourselves into one
dimensional beings. The Enlightenment
absolute of egalitarianism applies to us only
as persons. As men and women though, we
are anything but equal. 'l"hat's why we regu
late our sexual relations through negotiation
with our partners, rather than applying
ready-made formulas.
Unfortunately, Mitchell's "victims" pre
fer the easy security of handbook-defined
flirtation. Fortunately, Life will prove them
wrong, for nothing can confine its explosive
variety. Let them find the predictable plastic
guys they deserve, Mitchell. Life is on your
side.
