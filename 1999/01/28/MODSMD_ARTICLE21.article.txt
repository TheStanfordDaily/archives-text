## The
						dangers of reading a newspaper

Vanessa Bartsch

AWHILE AGO I was home in Mas
sachusetts visiting my family, and I
happened to need new shoes. Any
where in California, this is simply not a
problem. About 20 years ago, someone
from L.A. traveled down to Arizona and
made the amazing strip mall discovery.
Since then, those ugly bastards have
become omnipresent as drive-through
espresso huts. Right here in El Palo Alto,
one need not do more than go in search of a
Hobee's and viola!, one will find no fewer
than three coffee-cake-and-strip-mall heav
ens.
Where I come from, no such thing exists.
My old farm town is nothing more than a
tiny exit sign on the Interstate. If you drive
down our one main road, cleverly named
Main Street, you spot The Gas Station, The
Country Cupboard, The Police Station, The
School, The Restaurant and The Stop
Light, in that order.
To find shoes I had to hop in the car and
head 20 minutes down the Interstate to The
Mall. And The Mall is a recent acquisition
attributed to the '80s mutant creation: the
Yuppie. And this steady immigration of

successful DINKs, on a mission to procre
ate, has brought its share of crap.
In the 10 years since our last census
count, our population has doubled. We are
now a whopping metropolis of 4,(XM) resi
dents strong. And this has lead to a lot of
changes. Farms are slowly and systematical
ly crumbling under the weight of the phe
nomenal prices paid for such beautiful open
land only 40 minutes from Boston.
Instead of the farmers with their dusk-to
dark work day, we have corporate families
mini-vanning off to work at 8 a.m. and
returning by the 7 p.m. reruns of Seinfeld.
And this shift has brought some major
changes.
First they brought cable TV. And then,
all these people who didn't have enough to
do decided our town needed a newspaper.
Frankly, I didn't really think this was
necessary, considering my findings on my
above trip to The Mall. Two days after pur
chasing my new shoes, I ran into Mrs. M. at
the neighboring town's grocery store. Not
only had Mrs. M heard that 1 was at the
Mall, she know who I was with, how attrac
tive he was, what we were wearing and how

long I was now keeping my hair.
Given our diligent living news transfer
ers, 1 couldn't really figure out what they
could print that everyone didn't already
know, as nothing a small town does is really
newsworthy. Basically people want dirt, but
papers must seem so impartial and moral
that they must cleverly find ways of disguis
ing dirt.
And my town has found the disguise
through which our communities dirtiest gos
sip is safe to travel: the Police Blotter. Oh,
yes, the fine writers of this 12-page paper
have full access to the records of activity of
our esteemed, 12-man militant force.
What this basically means is that we all
religiously follow the activity of the town's
remaining force of livestock. Mr. B's yaks
(actually Scottish Highland Cattle, but they
are so huge and furry that no one seems to
know the difference) prove to be particular
ly entertaining as they manage to free their
three-ton massive, horned selves on a regu
lar basis and go on "walkabouts," which led
them to my family's field on three separate
occasions, along with some particularly
devious missions to the Interstate.

We also have a billion pigs and horses to
provide some wonderful print. They man
age to liberate themselves often and can
travel a lot further and faster than yaks.
There is also the running rabid raccoon
count and a listing of exactly which officers
are brave and skilled enough to blow the
deluded creatures away with a 12-gauge
from 20 feet.
But unfortunately, in the mix of barn
yard escapades, the paper has discovered
that it's wonderfully titillating to list traffic
violations, citations and arrests. Meaning
that when my friend Darrel was stupid
enough to drive home after a New Year's
party and get stopped for a broken tail light
in the town center, his name, age, approxi
mate address and DUI charge were all in
bold print that Friday in the paper.
This also means is that over the last
month, the entire town has been following
the arrest, charges and movements of one
Mr. K. He apparently was charged with
assault to a minor â€” it's unknown whether
the assault was sexual or otherwise. No
mention of what the case is about, what the
circumstances were or whether he is even

guilty.
So we have Mr. K., trying to go about his
business, attend to his job or go to The Gai
Station, but he is watched like Bill Clintorv
People stare and speculate, become
ed and pass judgments. Yet they kno\i
nothing more than what the three lines iij
the Blotter have told them.
This paper has assumed the right
make Mr. K. their business and ruined a
man's life by making him wear a scarlet let*
ter. Whether he is guilty or not, he cannot
outlive the talk. .
And 1 wonder why it is that newspapers,
who hold themselves in such high esteenj
for being so pure and unbiased, are gives
the license to write anything they see fit. }
am sure that Mr. K, who has spent 30 yearp
in this town, fathered two childhood
mates of mine, and religiously attende<jl
town meetings and Little League games, is
asking why. i
