## No. 3 Card to meet No. 13 Arizona 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
In tonight's game at the McKale Center
against the No. 13 Arizona Wildcats (13-3 over
all, 5-2 Pacific 10 Conference), the third-ranked
Stanford men's basketball team (17-2, 7-0) can
make a big statement.
Already holding a two-game lead in the Pac
-10 over Arizona and UCLA — the two pro
grams that have owned the conference title this
decade — a Stanford win would be a huge step
toward its first-ever Pac-10 crown.

■ Tonight: No. 3 Stanford (17-2 overall, 7-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) at No. 13 Arizona (13-3, 5-
2), 7:30 p.m. RADIO: KTCT (1050 AM). KZSU
(90.1 FM) TV: Fox Sports Network.

The Wildcats are also the team that handed
the Cardinal a pair of embarrassing losses a year
ago. Most people around the conference consid
er McKale and Pauley Pavilion the two most dif
ficult places to play. Having already won at
Pauley earlier this month, a Stanford win in Tuc
son, where Arizona has won 24 in a row, would
seem to give the Cardinal a huge leg up on the
rest of the Pac-10.
So this is about as big as they come for a con
ference matchup in January. Just don't try to tell
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery that.
"Nothing's going to be critical yet in the con
ference, I don't think," Montgomery said. "You
have just got to keep plugging along."
And don't be fooled into thinking that the
Cardinal will treat this as just another game. This
senior-laden team knows its goals, and is smart
enough to know that it must win tonight to stay
on top in the conference and the nation.
If Stanford is to come away with a win
tonight, it will have to contain the new-look
Wildcats and the Pac-10's highest-scoring of
fense.
Arizona lost the backcourt trio of Mike
Bibby, Miles Simon and Michael Dickerson to
the NBA, but has quickly reloaded with a new
crop of talent. The Wildcats are led by point
guard Jason Terry, a quick and athletic player
who combines a pure shooting touch with the

ability to put the ball on the floor and slash to the
basket. Terry, the sixth man on last year's Elite
Eight squad, leads the team and the Pac-1() in
scoring, averaging just under 21 points per game.
"He has quite a bit of freedom," Mont
gomery said. "And they run motion a lot, so that
does get him some shots."
Yet despite the great ability of Terry, Ari
zona has actually changed the focus of its offense
this season, recognizing its frontcourt strength.
Senior center A.J. Bramlett and freshman
forward Michael Wright have made the Wild
cats the Pac-10's best rebounding team, and
each averages close to 14 points a game.
"They've actually changed their style,"
Montgomery said. "They are actually quite a bit
more inside-oriented."
Wright has posted double-figure rebound to
tals in the Wildcats' last five games.
Yet the two veterans — Bramlett and Terry
— have been the real key for Arizona. When
both have productive offensive nights, the Wild
cats win. But when they don't get the job done,
neither does the final score.
Terry scored a career-high 37 points in Ari
zona's victory over Oregon last Thursday.
Against Oregon State, Terry scored just five
points and Bramlett mustered just four. The
Wildcats lost to the Beavers, 60-59. The loss to
Oregon State was Arizona's lowest offensive
output in its last 78 Pac-10 games.
That is not a great sign coming into a game
against the Pac-10's best defensive team. Stan
ford. holding its opponents to 55 points a game.
At tipoff time tonight at 7:30 p.m., Arizona
will be in unfamiliar territory. Not only is Stan
ford the favorite to win. but it will be the first
time since 19% that the Wildcats have hosted a
higher-ranked opponent.
All five Stanford starters are averaging in
double figures in Pac-10 play, led by forward
Mark Madsen (14.9 ppg) and point guard
Arthur Lee (12. 1 ) ppg).
"We're just trying to win as many games as
we can," Montgomery added. "Hopefully we
will take them one at a time and understand that
that game is the most important."
Great advice. Even though we all know that
tonight's game is way more important than
most.
