# Rain forces squad inside
## Match called 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
Forced to play on its indoor court due to rain, the
top-ranked Stanford men's tennis team played what
turned out to be an eight-hour draw on Tuesday
against the No. 10 Southern Methodist Tigers. The
match was ended in the middle of the No. 3 singles
match at 11 p.m. so that the Tigers could make their
midnight flight home.
All six matches — three doubles and three single
s — were played consecutively on the Cardinal's sole
indoor court. The Cardinal was losing by a score of
2-1 when the match was called off in the second set
of Geoff Abram's singles duel.
It was a match that turned out to be every bit as
difficult as Stanford head coach Dick Gould knew it
would be.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Tuesday: No. 1 Stanford met No. 10 SMU, called a
draw.

"SMU played very well tonight, but we expected
that." Gould said. They have good depth from one to
six, and three solid doubles teams, two of which are
ranked highly. We got off to a slowfctart, but worked
hard to battle back.".
The Tigers* fast start allowed them to take the
doubles point from the Cardinal, something that is
not likely to happen very often this season. In the
No. 1 doubles match, Stanford senior Ryan Wolters
and freshman K.J. Hippensteel got off to a slow start
and were never able to recover against a tough SMU
team of Dustan Maulk and Keith Pollack. Both
SMU players had big serves and forced the Cardinal
to play back for returns.
Down 3-5. Wolters played a perfect game in the
add court. It was a game that included five deuces
before Stanford was defeated. Wolters was then bro
ken at 4-7 to end the match. It was a rare loss for
Wolters and Hippensteel.
"I'm glad we played this kind of a match early be
cause it will help us throughout the season." Wolters
said. "It is surely not the last tough match K.J. and I
will be forced to play."
The No. 2 doubles match fea
tured junior Geoff Abrams and
sophomore Alex Kim of the Cardi
nal against a Swedish duo of John
Wallmark and Toby Hansson of
SMIJ.
Kim was broken at 1-1, but was
very instrumental in the 2-3 game
in which the Cardinal broke back.
The key game of the match was
at 6-6, a game that had six deuces
before Kim and Abrams broke to
go ahead 7 6. Abrams used the mo
mentum to hold and win the match
8-6.
" This is a match that could have
gone either way, but we were fortu
nate enough to win (he big points
and close it out," Abrams said.
It was a similar situation in the
final doubles match, but unfortu
nately for the Cardinal, this time it
went the I igers" way.
Stanford sophomores Ali
Ansari and Scotty Scott were
edged out by SMIJ's Ignacio
Hirigowen and Sijimen DeLange
by a score of <S-6 in the crucial, and
point-deciding, third doubles
match.
Gould thought Ansari and Scott
returned very well, but had trouble
holding serve.
He believes that will be the
major challenge for the two sopho
mores down the road.
Holding serve was not a prob
lem Wolters had. however, in his
No. I singles match against
I lirigowen.
Wolters lost the first set 6-3 and
was down a break in the second be
fore turning the momentum and
rallying to win the final two sets 6-
4, 6-4.
"Ryan's serve was at the top of
its game. I hat has been a big im
provement for him this year.
"He just needs to learn not to try
to hit too hiy and to stav within

himself and he'll he as tough to
beat as anyone," Gould said.
The key game was in the final set
with Hirigowen serving at 3-4.
Hirigowen hit six strong first serves
in row. but Wolters remained un
fazed and won four out of the six
points to break and go ahead 5-3.
In the 5-3 game, Wolters was
down two break points but used a
huge serve on one and a winning
forehand on the other to survive.
He was broken, though, but
then broke back, coming back to
win the match.
The Wolters match was the only
point the Cardinal got all day, and
was a sign of leadership on the part
of the senior.
I hat momentum did not last
long, however, as Kim was defeat
ed 7-5.6-3 in the No. 2 singles. Fol
lowing this. Abrams was down a set
and in the middle of the second
when the match was called off.
Perhaps the SMIJ match was a
good indication of where the Car
dinal stands right now.
" I he SMIJ match was indicative
of what our season will be like."
(iould said.
"We will have a lot of close
matches that will come down to a
few points here and there. We
shouldn't blow too many teams
out, but if we play like we are capa
ble of we also should not get domi
nated by anyone. It should make
for an exciting year of tennis," he
added.
The excitement of the Pacific 10
Conference wastes no time in get
ting underway on Saturday.
Stanford will plav a tough
Washington team on Saturday and
C )regon on Sunday.
Washington is a difficult team,
especially indoors and at home. It
is ranked very close to the top 25
and always strong in its arena in
Seattle.
Oregon is also much improved
and could provide a pesky match
for the ('ardinal.

Stanford sophomore Alex Kim probably missed these outdoor
courts on Tuesday, as rained forced the top-ranked Cardinal to bring
its match with Southern Methodist indoors. Kim won his doubles
match, but lost in No. 2 singles before the match was called.
