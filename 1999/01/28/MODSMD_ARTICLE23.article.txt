# Rain forces squad inside
## Match called 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
Forced to play on its indoor court due to rain, the
top-ranked Stanford men's tennis team played what
turned out to be an eight-hour draw on Tuesday
against the No. 10 Southern Methodist Tigers. The
match was ended in the middle of the No. 3 singles
match at 11 p.m. so that the Tigers could make their
midnight flight home.
All six matches — three doubles and three single
s — were played consecutively on the Cardinal's sole
indoor court. The Cardinal was losing by a score of
2-1 when the match was called off in the second set
of Geoff Abram's singles duel.
It was a match that turned out to be every bit as
difficult as Stanford head coach Dick Gould knew it
would be.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Tuesday: No. 1 Stanford met No. 10 SMU, called a
draw.

"SMU played very well tonight, but we expected
that." Gould said. They have good depth from one to
six, and three solid doubles teams, two of which are
ranked highly. We got off to a slowfctart, but worked
hard to battle back.".
The Tigers* fast start allowed them to take the
doubles point from the Cardinal, something that is
not likely to happen very often this season. In the
No. 1 doubles match, Stanford senior Ryan Wolters
and freshman K.J. Hippensteel got off to a slow start
and were never able to recover against a tough SMU
team of Dustan Maulk and Keith Pollack. Both
SMU players had big serves and forced the Cardinal
to play back for returns.
Down 3-5. Wolters played a perfect game in the
add court. It was a game that included five deuces
before Stanford was defeated. Wolters was then bro
ken at 4-7 to end the match. It was a rare loss for
Wolters and Hippensteel.
"I'm glad we played this kind of a match early be
cause it will help us throughout the season." Wolters
said. "It is surely not the last tough match K.J. and I
will be forced to play."
