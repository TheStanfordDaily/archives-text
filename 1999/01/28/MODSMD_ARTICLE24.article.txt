# Fourth and Inches
## More than just doing my job 
###

So I guess this is it. The last edition of "Fourth and
Inches" for the year. I like having a column, but 1
think it's time I move back to more straight reporting.
Who knows, maybe I'll even write some news. Hut if
you've had even half as much fun as I have, then it was
more than worth it.

I'm lucky. I get paid to watch and follow people.
It's an honor to be courtside or in a press or locker
room, seeing the story behind the story. It can be very
intimate, watching dreams come true or fall short.
Watching athletic triumph can often be a lot like
watching the look of wonder in a child's eyes: so full
of pure innocence and joy. you can't help but get en
veloped in it yourself. There are exceptions â€” the
whiners, the prima donnas, but they really are just a
small minority.
We often put athletes on pedestals, but the reason
I went from spectator to reporter was because I real
ized that behind the celebrity and the hype, hidden by
television commentators and corporate sponsors,
there lies on the playing field the ultimate humanity.
We remember the big plays, the game-winners: but
no person to ever don a uniform was ever as ennobled
by these as he or she was by the tears of joy that fol
lowed. ,
In that instance, we realize the only thing that sep
arates us from the athlete is that uniform. We want to
be in awe. we want to see the logic-defying plays. Hut
the times we are most touched come when we realize
that these are everyday people. They have goals.
When those goals are achieved, they rejoice.
And when they fall just short of that ultimate
achievement, we can empathize with the personal
tragedy behind it.
I've had to hold back. I don't allow myself to cheer
in the press box because I don't want to seem unpro
fessional.
Hut the truly hard part is not high-fiving a player
after a victory, or stopping myself from putting my
arm around his or her shoulder after a gut-wrenching
loss.
The words sit in me: "I understand, but you did all
you could ask of yourself."
I know at least some of my reporters have gotten

to feel this side of the job. I hope in my heart they all
have. I want to thank them for the incredible writing
and reporting they've done for us, and by the same
token I hope that the experience was worth all the
hard work they put in.
And I hope that you. the readers, have been able
to see more than just words. 1 hope that the real story
has shone through the mere text and touched your
heart.
Sports may seem trivial: hit a ball with a stick,
throw it in the hoop, hit it over the net. But athletics
really is a window into the human psyche.
Maybe you grew up dreaming of being the Presi
dent or an astronaut. 1 dreamt of being Magic John
son. It wasn't about money or fame, it was about
doing something I loved and being great at it.
Maybe I'm just a romantic, but I still see the world
of sports through those eyes. I like to believe that con
tracts and popularity aren't the motivating factors of
today's youth, but are only outside influences that
corrupt just a few people.
I could have edited again. Hut I want some time to
get back in close touch with that something which is
more human. Not just in the athletic world, but in my
own life.
Sitting in this claustrophobia-inducing office has
been fun. I'll be the first to admit it, but I can't stay
away from the personal interactions that inspire and
move me. I want to get back to that emotion. To see
that look in another person's eyes, that silly grin of in
credulity painted on his face, and let it take me back
to a sunset at my high school, practicing my free
throws.
On a blacktop somewhere, a kid is dribbling
crossovers and practicing jump shots, hoping to fill
the shoes Michael Jordan has left behind.
In some city park with parents and friends scream
ing from the stands, a little-leaguer is sitting in the
batter's box. pretending that he's in a jam-packed
Busch Stadium, knocking out that dramatic 62nd
home run that broke Roger Maris' hallowed record.
There's a girl somewhere on this globe who aspires to
one day stand on top of the Olympic podium, gold
medal draped from her neck and tears streaming
down her face as her nation's anthem rings in her
ears.
And I pray that someday, in locker rooms
drenched in champagne and tears, exuberance and
relief and triumph all hanging together in the air. I'll
get to talk to them.

(til Lopez would like to thank his co-editor, writers
and all the other editorial and advertising staffers at the
Daily. Its been great working with you. Its been even
better knowing you.
