Putting together back-to-back
wins has been anything but easy for
this year's Cardinal team, with that
feat happening only twice before.
Last weekend's victories were es
pecially meaningful for Stanford
because it kept it in the running for
a Pac-10 title.
Furthermore, the Washington

game was the first time all season
that the Cardinal triumphed after
being down at halftime.
"We've struggled a lot this year
in the second half. We seem to have
lost our intensity and lost our con
centration in the second half [of
most games] but against Washing
ton we were able to stay with it and
actually elevate our game, which
was something we hadn't seen yet."
said junior guard Christina Batasti
ni.
"Our last win against Washing
ton indicates the team's growing
maturity in the fact that we were
able to stay together and come
back from a 15-point deficit,"
Batastini said. "I think that's a
great indication that we've grown a
lot and have matured throughout
the season."
That maturity and intensity will
help the Cardinal against a power
ful Arizona Wildcats team that
comes in on a three-game winning
streak and confidence after upset

ting then No. 25 Oregon
The Wildcats are led by junior
guard Felicity Willis, an honorable

year, who is averaging over 12
points and three rebounds per
game.
