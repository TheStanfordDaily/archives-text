laduatcs from different educa
b
«nal backgrounds an experience

Ceir future career choices" said
jegan Matheny, the western re-

I Michelle Cornman, Class of '9K,
>ined Teach For America as a pre

cursor to medical school. Leading a
kindergarten class has taught her
"energy, willingness, and planning"
that she can take with her to med
ical school.
Other alumni use Teach For
America as a way to explore educa
tion as a career.
Herrera joined the program be
cause it was a way to try out teach
ing. After two years of teaching in
East Palo Alto, he has decided to
become a teacher at a junior col
lege. "I learned that teaching is a
powerful role," he said.
For teachers such as Cornman
and Herrera, Teach For America is
about working for the community.
"It's amazing how kids respond
to your love and attention; they
need it so much" Cornman said.
Senior Francisco Najera, the di
rector of Teach For America re
cruitment at Stanford, intends to
apply for the program because he
feels it is a heartfelt attempt to
reach out to disadvantaged stu
dents. Many of the children impact
ed by Teach For America's pro
grams are minorities, and Najera
believes it is important for minority
leaders to give back to their com
munities by becoming role models.
"When kids see that someone
just like them has succeeded, they
think they can succeed too," he
said.
Since Wendy Copp, a Princeton
graduate, started Teach For Amer
ica in 1990, the program has be
come active in 13 sites throughout
the U.S. including troubled areas in
New York, Los Angeles, Washing
ton, D.C., and the Bay Area, in
cluding East Palo Alto. The pro

gram is a non-profit organization
funded by individual gifts, corpo
rate grants, and federal funds
through Americorps.
Teach For America now annual
ly chooses 600 college graduates
from a national pool of 3,000 to be
come teachers in under-resourced
areas. Participants train in an inten
sive five-week summer institute,
where they attend workshops and
lectures to get a crash course in
teaching. They are then given annu
al $S,(XX) awards by Americorps,
full-time teaching salaries and
emergency teaching credentials —
temporary teaching licenses to be
used while they earn their perma
nent credentials.
While critics of Teach For
America claim that the program
places teachers of limited training
and experience in classrooms, pro
ponents maintain that its selection
process chooses a talented breed of
leaders who energize the education
system.
Matheny boasts that corps mem
bers earn high respect and adopt in
fluential roles in their respective
schools. "Corps members are nor
mally very good teachers," she said.
However, teaching in under-re
sourced, low-income areas adds
extra hardships to the job.
While many students have sup
portive parents, others suffer from
neglect. Some come from families
troubled with drug addiction, alco
holism or illiteracy. Attendance is a
problem, as well as a high rate of
student turnover.
"These students lack parental
help, resources, libraries, comput
ers," said Herrera. Therefore, the

teacher does not only teach the cur
riculum, he or she must understand
each child's environment and emo
tional issues as well.
As a result, Teach For America
corps members adopt many strate
gies to help their students.
Members work hard, staying
overtime after school with children,
starting clubs and programs that
provide extra help, and going to
sleep late every night in order to
come up with creative lesson plans
that keep up student interest.
"Teaching is more work than
I've ever done in my whole life,"
Cornman said.
Herrera agreed. "I did more in
one year of teaching than in my
whole Stanford career." But he
noted that the "key is to adopt close
relationships with students and the
community." He has succeeded
most by developing trusting friend
ships with his students.
Though the job is hard, corps
members show dynamic enthusi
asm when they talk about their ex
periences.
Cornman recalled with tender
ness the look on her students' faces
at a school Christmas program
when Santa brought a stocking with
presents for each of them.
"It's a wonder how something so
small can mean so much to them."
she said.
Herrera put it plainly when he
said, "Once I'm Mr. Herrera to
them, once I'm their teacher, I'll be
their friend for life."
