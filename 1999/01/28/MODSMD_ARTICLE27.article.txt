# No fun in sun for rugby as men fall to UA, women tie ASU
## 
### Chuck Gates 
This weekend, Stanford Rugby
had a growing experience in the
Arizona desert. The men's rugby
team (0-2) gave away the game, 32-
10, against Arizona, while the
women (1-2-1) were surprised by a
17-17 tie against Arizona State.
The Cardinal women's rugby
squad faced a maturing experience
against the Sun Devils.
Last fall, Stanford strongly de
feated ASU despite missing four
key Stanford players. Now, with
those players back, the women ex
pected to have an easy time.
They didn't.
"It was a fun trip," said team
president Lara Strauss. But, "the

game itself was actually pretty
ugly."
Many possessions were stopped
by illegal forward hits, resulting in
turnovers. Such opportunities al
lowed ASU to score early and con
trol the match.
"We didn't play very well at all,"
Strauss said. "We realize that we
are not unbeatable."
The Stanford women grew from
this timely loss and this weekend
the women will play host UC-
Davis. The 11 a.m. game will start
off a rugby doubleheader at Mal
oney Field.
"Davis has decided that we're
their big rival," Strauss said.
Stanford is feeling that rivalry as
well, as it is preparing for a physical

battle.
"They came out last year and
were out for blood," Strauss said.
Last weekend, Stanford's men's
team might have been out for blood
as well, but the Arizona Wildcats
seemed the more bloodthirsty of
the two.

MEN'S & WOMEN'S RUGBY

■ Saturday: The men fell to Arizona,
32-10.The women tied Arizona State
17-17.

The men started strong against
the Wildcats, the No. 1 team in the
Southern California Region.
Ahead 1-5 at the half, it seemed the
Cardinal had overcome the ball

control problems that had plagued
it of late. However, a few key mis
handles forced Stanford to rely on
its defensive play.
"We were controlling the game,
and then we did not control the
ball," said coach Franck Boivert.
"And every time we had the ball. ..
we would turn it over."
Every time that the Cardinal
threatened, a misplaced pass would
halt the movement. It seemed that
the opportunities to score were
quickly becoming lessons of growth
for the younger Stanford ruggers.
"They missed a lot of opportuni
ties when they were still in the
game and after that it was too late,"
Boivert said. "That's what happens
when you have a verv young team.

especially at key positions. They
make silly mistakes."
Arizona was led by Chris Krohn,
a standout player who plays with
the U.S. National Team. Krohn
forced Stanford to learn from its
mistakes, as his outstanding play
was augmented by bad breaks for
the Cardinal.
At one point, Krohn blocked a
Stanford kick and when the ball
bounced into his arms he ran 60
yards to score the try. He later
added another try.
"He is a game-breaker and we
gave him two opportunities too
many," Boivert said.
Despite the difficult growing ex
perience, the bright spot on the
Arizona road trip was the cama

raderie and solidarity that devel-\
oped among the Cardinal players. £
"The team has very, very
morale, so to me, that is very im-J
portant," Boivert said.
Such strengths will be important
as Stanford is set to face UC-Davisi'
this Saturday at 1 p.m. at Maloney,*
Field. The Aggies have formed a ri->
valry with the Cardinal in recqpt>
years. This year Davis fields a voYyC
physical team. Despite this fact,*
though, Boivert feels if his team£
commits fewer turnovers, Stanford' 1 !
will be in decent shape.
"We should be able to
them," Boivert said. "Our mainJj
problem is ball control. Our de-1
fense is doing all right. We just can'ty
play defense for 80 minutes."
