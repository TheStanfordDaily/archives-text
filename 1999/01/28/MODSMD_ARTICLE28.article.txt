# Rents increase in Berkeley
## 
### Ty Tosdal The Daily Californian (UC-Berkeley 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY â€” The
change in rent control laws that oc
curred on Jan. 1 has only recently
begun to generate effects on Berke
ley landlords and tenants.
Up until this year, when rental
units were vacated, landlords could
only increase the rent according to an
adjusted rate determined by the rent
board. But as of Jan. 1, if a tenant va
cates a unit, landlords can charge any
price prospective tenants are willing
to pay.
The Costa-Hawkins Act. a law
passed in 1995 and implemented this
year, voided the Berkeley vacancy
control policy.

Initially, local tenants had predict
ed that the prices in the Berkeley rent
market would balloon, but some
landlords and rental agents say that
"supply and demand" has restrained
any potential inflation.
"Prices are so high, I'm really con
cerned students cannot afford it,"
said Dana Goodell, president ol
Homefinders, a rental search agency.
Goodell noted that the average
price of a one-bedroom apartment in
Berkeley is precisely $961 a month.
She said that overall rent prices have
increased by approximately 40 per
cent since January 1998.
But not everyone agreed yester
day with Goodell's assessment.
"We noticed that when landlords
initially listed, thev were often fish

ing," said Becky White, the assistant
director of faculty and community
housing at the UC-Berkeley Housing
and Dining Services department. "A
lot of times they set the rent higher
than the unit could bear."
Doris Maslach. a prominent critic
of Berkeley's rent control laws, de
fended the new system.
"The market follows 'supply and
demand,' " she said. "People are not
getting exorbitant rents."
Members of the rent board dis
agreed.
"We should remind ourselves that
we are paying too much," said board
member Stefanie Bemay. "The rents
in Berkeley are not consumer-friend
ly. I would like to see the city and the
university do something about it."
