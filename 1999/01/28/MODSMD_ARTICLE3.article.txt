# Student tax breaks cause administrative headache
## 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
Two controversial federal in
come-tax breaks, the Hope Credit
and the Lifetime Learning Credit,
will be available to students and
their parents for the first time this
year. Although the tax breaks will
allow students to reduce their in
come tax payments, it has caused
considerable stress among financial
aid officers.
Specifically, the Hope Credit,
for full-time freshmen and sopho
mores. is worth as much as $1,500
per year. The Lifetime Learning
Credit provides up to $1,000 per
year for part-time students, full
time juniors and seniors, and grad

uate students.
I he Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion compared the introduction ol
the tax breaks to "throwing a live
grenade" into campus offices. At
Stanford, the reaction has not been
quite as severe, hut tension still ex
ists.
The concern is not over the tax
credits themselves, but the heavy
administrative workload that goes
along with them. In order to inform
students about the tax breaks, the
Internal Revenue Service requires
that all postsecondary institutions
send a new tax form. IO9BT. to stu
dents who paid tuition in IWB.
Stanford has hired an outside
company to mail the required tax
forms along with supplemental ma

terials that attempt to answer ques
tions students might have about the
tax credits.
"But there are still going to be a
lot of questions," said Bursar Jon
Eriekson. "Students are going to
get this tax form in the mail all of a
sudden and say, 'Huh?' We are
going to have to stress to the stu
dents that we are not tax advisors."
Eriekson estimated that time
spent answering student inquiries,
the cost of mailing out tax forms
and other miscellaneous costs, such
as the programming necessary to
extract data required by the IRS,
will amount to between $50,000
and $100,(MX) per year.
"When you look at how many
institutions are required to partic

ipate in these programs, you see
that they are costing an incredible
amount of money," he said.
According to a survey by the Na
tional Association of College and
University Business Officers, the
average cost per tax form will be
about $3.50, amounting to a total of
$119 million nationwide.
"Like most federal programs,
these weren't well thought out by
Congress and are extremely convo
luted," Erickson said.
The programs are also not avail
able to everyone. In order to quali
fy for the tax breaks, the tuition
payer's income must be under
$1 ()().()()() if married or under
$.S(),(KM) if single.
"And with the level of Stan
lord's tuition, SI,S(K) is only a small
percentage," Erickson said. As to
whether such a small tax break is
worth all the effort his office is
putting into the programs, he said,
"I'll leave that question to Con
gress."
Another problem, according to
Director of Financial Aid Cynthia
Hartley, is that "In some cases, the
IRS is forcing us to report more in
formation than we've kept, such as
whether it's the student or the par
ent who is paying the student's
taxes."
She emphasized that her office
would rather have students report
such information to the IRS theni

selves. Otherwise, it may take more
than two years for the programs to
become fully implemented.
However, Hartley admitted
that she supports the idea of tax
breaks for students.
As for students, most are obliv
ious to the tax credits, "1 haven't
heard anything about it," ASSU
senator Clara Chan said.
Once informed, student reac
tions have been mostly positive. "I
think it's great," freshman Ken
neth Yasmer said. "Every little bit
helps. If we're paying $30,(XX) a
year to go here, administrators
have no right to complain about
keeping us informed."
Freshman Jacob Greene said,
"I'm sure my parents can't wait to
take advantage of it.... It's about
time the government realized how
hard it can be for middle-income
families to pay huge tuition bills."
