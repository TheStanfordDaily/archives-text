# No. 8 Cardinal happy to be home to host Hawaii after loss at BYU
## 
### Colleen Shaw Contributing Writer 
It's a brutal way for the Stanford
men's volleyball team to kick off
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation

competition â€” two consecutive
weeks with matches against top-five
teams.

Coming off a loss to the No. 4
Brigham Young Cougars at Frovo,
Utah, the No. 8 Cardinal (2-1 over
all. 0-1 MPSF) must now face No. 3
Hawaii (4-1, 2-0) at Burnham Pavil
ion tonight in the first of two games
against the Rainbows.
"We are going to have to play
much better against I lawaii than we
did against BYU if we want to be
suceessful." said Stanford head
eoaeh Ruben Nieves after Satur
day's three-game loss to the
( ougars.
Although Stanford had to battle
against a rowdy audience of more
than 4.000 fans last weekend in
I )tah, in addition to the BYU squad,
the Cardinal will be relieved to be
playing against Hawaii with the se
cured home-court advantage.
The I'll volleyball program,
however, has also thrived in an envi
ronment with unparalleled student
support.
Hawaii has set NCAA atten
dance records in each of the past
three seasons.
Although Stanford leads the all
lime scries against I lawaii 22-IS. this

record docs not reveal the recent
strength of the Rainbows' volleyball
program. Hawaii has challenged for
a berth at the NCAA National
Championships five of the past six
years. Last year, the Rainbows
wrapped up their season as the Pa
cific Division Champions with a 16-3
conference record.
Despite the prestige of Hawaii's
program, the Cardinal, also a consis
tent NCAA championship con
lender, is not intimidated by this up
coming challenge.
"True, they are a powerhouse,"
said sophomore middle blocker Dan
Zhang. ' Mut, so are we. We've just
got to play harder."
Hawaii has established its domi
nance in collegiate volleyball by in
corporating many international
players into its lineup.
"In collegiate athletics, you have
to do whatever is within the rules to
be competitive," Nieves said.
"Hawaii has found its niche, lis
niche is with foreign athletes."
The likely starting middle block
ers for the Rainbows both have in
ternational playing experience.

Hawaii sophomore Dejan Miladi
novic is from Serbia and junior
Andre Breuer's hometown is Berlin.
Germany.
The Rainbows' array of interna
tional talent, however, has not al
tered the Cardinal's preparation for
tonight's game. Hawaii is anything
but foreign to the Cardinal.
"They have played in some televised
matches and we have plenty of
videotape of them. Familiarity with
Hawaii won't be a problem," Nieves
said.
In addition to analyzing footage
of the Rainbows' previous games,
the Cardinal has prepared for
tonight's game by emphasizing team
dynamics.
Despite strong individual perfor
mances, Stanford failed to work pro
ductively as a team during last
week's loss.
"We have to stick together,"
Nieves said.
"We can't give up 011 team chem
istry. I hat will do us in."he added.
"If we are not able to make im
provements there, it will be a very
long season."
