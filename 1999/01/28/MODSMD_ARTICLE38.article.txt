## Simply Sublime (it's a pun, you see?) The
						Long Beach Dub All-Stars at the House of Blues 
### Jung Lah Contributing writer 
The Long Beach Dub All-Stars will claim to hook
you up with a unique musical experience, and
they deliver with far more than just that. Their
official bio says,"The band is often joined on stage by
one or many special guests for spontaneous freestyle
jams." And indeed, live is truly the way to see this super
group of sorts, which gained initial recognition as the
project of the remaining members of Sublime, percus
sionist Bud Gaugh and bassist Eric Wilson. The truth of
the matter, however, is that a project originating as a
tribute to the late Bradley Nowell has become a collabo
rative effort that includes Miguel Happoldt (guitar),
RASI (guitar), Marshall Goodman (turntables), Opie
Ortiz (vocals), and a multitude of keyboardists and
horn players who make up just the formal line-up of the
group. Last Dec. 17 at a special all-ages show in the
House of Blues in Los Angeles, these musicians and
their special guests demonstrated the power of their
musical talents to a hometown SoCal audience. It was a
presentation that vividly displayed that LBDA is an
accomplished band in its own right, albeit one that has
not stepped away from its Sublime influences.
The show was filled with energy from the get-go. No
opening bands, no prolonged waiting, just more than 90
minutes of straightforward music. Since LBDA does not
have a studio album out yet, all of its original material is
feels new and is ready to be recorded for a Skunk
Records release scheduled for the first quarter of 1999.
These were the songs that made up the majority of the
show, the reggae-style dub reminiscent of dancehall
music that allowed for a crowd who never stopped mov
ing to the bass-heavy beats and DJed samples.

Thrown into the mix was a medley of
Sublime songs such as "Garden Grove,"
"Doin' Time," and "Ball and Chain, " a
song which has become a staple at all
LBDA shows, and that has Opie doing his
best Bradley Nowell impression (and a
fairly good one at that). Not to be neglect
ed were the improvisational jams that
seemed to be continually going on, as well
as the consistent flow of guest musicians
coming out on stage — Half Pint, the
Mexikanz, Barrington Levy, and Mad
Lion to name a few.
At one point, HR from the seminal
hardcore punk band Bad Brains came out
to rile up the crowd into a moshing fren
zy with a cover of the Descendents'
"Myage," and LBDA paid tribute to the
legendary ska band Operation Ivy by cov
ering "Take Warning." Half Pint and Mad
Lion got in their share of "toasting," a
Jamaican style of rap. During their set the
influence of hip-hop on the band, which

was evidenced by their previous work with artists rang
ing from KRS-One to Wyclef Jean, became apparent .
The energy of the crowd refused to die down, and the
band matched the atmosphere of the venue by belting
out song after song, one guest singer after another. Fans
might have recognized some of the numbers as being
tracks off of various LBDA samplers, such as "Have a
Little Faith" and "Computerized Dub," but for the most
part, much of the playlist was comprised of songs that
are yet to be found anywhere except at live shows such
as this one. This fact did not stop the crowd from getting
into the music, though, and in the end, the music spoke
for itself.

The band came out for one encore, busting out
Sublime's "Badfish," which was momentarily interrupt
ed by a fight amongst some drunken fans. The bouncers
took care of the squabble, and the Long Beach Dub All-
Stars took care of the finale — by having the audience
sing out all the words to "Santeria" as they provided the
musical backdrop, demonstrating how the connection
with their fans is still very important to them. This was
a worthy conclusion to a strong showing, and Stanford
students would do well to catch the Long Beach Dub
All-Stars at the Maritime Hall in San Francisco on Feb.
13. As self proclaimed musical all stars, LBDA truly live
up to its name.
