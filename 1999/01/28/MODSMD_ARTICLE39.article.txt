# Creatures of the Night
## Lords of the dead and slaves of thirst 
### 
Tom Holland's two novels, "Lord of the Dead" (Pocket Books) and "Slave of
My Thirst" (Pocket Books) have enjoyed great popularity, appealed to a wide
audience and established Holland as the next great author on vampire lore.
Hollands works have been referred to as a combination of Anne Rice's vampire
novels and Caleb Carr's "The Alienist." Holland's two new novels defy comparison,
for although they build upon an already existent abundance of vampire lore, they
are elegant, deftly written, terrifying part fantasy, part truth uniquely his own.
Are there truly vampires, creatures of the night, eternally damned to immortali
ty, who feed upon the very life and blood of the living to sustain themselves, and are
they among us? Or are the tales of vampires pure fantasy and myth? Tom Holland's
debut novel, "Lord of the Dead," not only makes the case for the existence of vam
pires (or "vardoulacha" in an ancient tongue), but asserts that George Gordon, Lord
Byron was not only a vampire, but the greatest of vampires, the "lord of the dead."
This is no mean assertion and Holland calls not only upon his imagination but
his knowledge as a Byron scholar to help him weave fact and fiction together to cre
ate one of the most chillingly suspenseful and lyrical tales ever.
Byron is vividly portrayed as a dashing, beautiful, reckless man, a poet of the
Romantic period and author of "Manfred" and "Don Juan" who died while helping
the Greeks wage war for their independence against the Tbrks. But Holland goes
beyond this sketch. By combining excerpts from the diaries of the poet's lifelong
friend, John Cam Hobhouse, with quotes from Byron's poems that hint as the occult
and supernatural, Holland pays upon the rumors surrounding the poet's death and
introduces the possibility of Byron's candidacy as the next Count Dracula.
Holland's technique is masterful. Hie use of premonition and foreshadowing
exhibit his firm control of the story and plot, even when the reader feels lost in a
world of Greek slaves, tUrkish potentates and Pashas, blas£ Londoners and blood
thirsty, intriguingly beautiful, immoral vampires. Holland gives painstaking atten

tion to detail whether the setting he describes is real or imagined, whether the place
is an abandoned church or the River Styx or Acheren that Greek mythology places
as the meeting point between death and life, the mysterious Underworld. Holland
makes use of all the predominant stereotypes of vampires and creates a character
with a twist. Lord Byron is at turns romantic and ruthless, damned and daunting,
sensual, arrogant and ironic, more compelling than Anne Rice's famous vampire,
Lestat.
Byron is cast in a tale of revenge, lust and curses that transcends time, following
him from 19th-century London, Greece and Italy right up to the present-day
London, where he lays in wait, hiding from himself and his identity as the curse
upon him and his family relives itself over and over again. Byron's tale is both
delightful and horrible. The reader meets many literary characters of the 19th cen
tury, gets an inside view of the Romantic period, and witnesses scenes of shocking
violence.
This theme of sex and death is taken up again in the more recent "Slave of My
Thirst," a retrospective book that features Lord Byron in the London and India of
1887 with a whole new group of friends, among whom Bram Stoker is included. A
powerful female vampire is introduced, Lilah. She is Lilith, the first woman and the
first wife of Adam. She is as beautiful as she is terrible. In her own words, she is
more than nature, more than time... control and the uncontrollable; union and
dissolution ... truth and also iniquity." She challenges the hero in her identity as the
greatest and oldest creature of all time.
Whether or not you believe in the existence of vampires, Tom Holland's novels
Lord of the Dead" and "Slave of My Thirst" will certainly make you wonder, per
haps even fear.
