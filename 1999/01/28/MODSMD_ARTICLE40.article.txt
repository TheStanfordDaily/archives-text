## Meryl Tankard Australian Dance Theatre Coming to Lively Arts 
### 
After a stunning U.S. debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Meryl Tankard
Australian Dance Theatre is coming to Stanford for the West Coast premiere of
"Furioso."
In "Furioso," dancers soar through the air to music by Arvo Part, Elliot Sharp and
Henryk Gorecki, arcing and twisting ir. a mysterious, exquisite performance of athlet
ic drama and complex sensuality.
Meryl Tankard, formerly a principal dancer with Pina Bausch's famed Tanztheater
Wuppertal, was appointed as Artistic Director of Australia's longest running modern
dance company, The Australian Dance Theatre, in 1993. Since then, she has trans
formed dance in Australia, gaining fame for her stunning choreographic inventiveness
and for the exceptional physicality, passion and rough-edged virtuosity of her work.
In an interview with Tankard, Intermission asked the choreographer how she came
up with the idea for an aerial dance piece.
"I wanted to defy gravity The company had just moved to a big studio with
wonderful high ceilings, and I wanted to use every inch of the space."
Tankard asked her dancers, "What do you do when you are losing something you
love?" She asked them to answer in movements, and their responses provided the
foundation for the choreography of "Furioso."
The women hang from ropes, while the men are stage-bound. One question
Tankard raises is if the women are trapped, or free. While bound in ropes, the dancers
themselves described a feeling of freedom and ecstasy when freed from the confines of
gravity.
Tankard encourages students to come with open hearts and no expectations. "The
audience needs no knowledge of dance to engage with this piece," she said. "Some
think the piece is playful, others erotic."
Either way, "Furioso" promises to be a daring and lovely piece of dance theater.
Meryl Tankard Australian Dance Theatre will perform "Furioso" on Friday and
Saturday at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. Tickets are $17-$30, with half-priced tick
ets available for Stanford students. Call 725-ARTS for tickets.
