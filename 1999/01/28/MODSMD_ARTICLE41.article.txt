## Playing Chicken Coupe de Ville rockabilly, right around the block 
### Selena Kyle Staff writer 
ime was, I avoided California Avenue's Edge nightclub like the plague. After
[j all, what self-respecting coed would pass up the blinking chili lights and wink
ing waiters of a local college bar, let alone the superior ambience of almost any
city club, for the chance to mingle with the best and brightest of Palo Alto's preteen
scene? Then my house cook's band, Chicken Coupe de Ville, booked some gigs there.
Spurred by a perverse curiosity and the desire to "represent," I rounded up a couple of
friends and braved a trip.
That's when we stumbled into a time warp and discovered the world of rockabilly.
On the night of the Chicken Coupe de Ville show, the Edge parking lot was chock
ablock with gleaming hot rods and classic cars. A handful of James Dean lookalikes
slouched near the entrance with their Lucky Strikes; inside, vintage-clad scenesters
swarmed the dance floor. Period-perfect bartenders dispensed whiskeys, Cherry
Cokes, and plenty of attitude. Contrary to expectations, there wasn't a gum-smacking
15-year-old in sight. Stranger still, everyone who wasn't seated seemed to be actually
dancing no nodders and shufflers in this crowd. Things were looking up.
Then Chicken Coupe de Ville took the stage from openers Rusty Zinn and launched
into their lightning-paced 15-song set. The band has only been around for three years,
so most of its show numbers "Double Cool," "No Use Sleepin," "Sweet Adeline' are
straight off their self-produced album "IWang Bang Deluxe." Frontmen Steve Hewitt
and John Truitt share guitar solos and vocals, Matt Anderson backs everyone up on
drums, and Robb Mellburg (that'd be my cook by day) does some enthusiastic work
on stand-up bass. Live, Chicken Coupe de Ville comes across somewhat like your typ

ical house-party band: overloud guitars, heavy-handed percussion, driving bass lines,
vocals seen but not quite heard. But whatever the band lacks in balance, it makes up
in pure showsmanship. Mellburg's acrobatics are reason enough to catch a shows. He
spins the bass by its neck, plays it like a guitar, even balances on top of it in way you 11
just have to see to believe.
You wouldn't know it from BASS ticket sales or campus bookings, but acts like
Chicken Coupe de Ville have been a lively part of the Bay Area live music scene for
decades. Rockabilly emerged as a distinct genre way back in the late 40s, around the
same time as swing. Think of it as it swing's badass country cousin: less orchestrated,
less slick, and a whole lot louder. Lyrics, when you can make them out, are the cheeky
down-home sort that might have sounded dirty two generations back. Sings Hewitt in
"Love Potion #151": "She's dancin' up on tables / She's crawling on the floor / She lift
ed up her skirt /1 almost fell down, Lord!"
Rockabilly groups come in many guises these days, thanks in part to the recent ren
naissance of '40s-era dance music. Chicken Coupe de Ville, though, is emphatically
retro. Even Hewitt's jokes are vintage: during one break in the Edge set, he begged the
crowd to "buy shots, CDs, hell, pocket protectors to help support the band." There's a
lot of humor in this act, but not much in the way of irony. All of which works in the
band's favor; Chicken Coupe de VUle's music wouldn't be nearly as infectious if you
suspected they were just poking fun at themselves.
They may sound like your momma's kind of rock band. But that doesn't mean you
won't like 'em too. Plus, they're cheap, they're loud, and they're very close. So the next
time Chicken Coupe de Ville hits California Avenue, drop by and catch a few numbers.
Maybe even snag a tight black chicken-print T and score some kitsch points at the
inevitable upcoming '50s party. You'll be glad you got out of the dorm. Promise.
