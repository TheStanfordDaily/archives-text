# Preachin' the Blues, Stanford style
## Ware Wendell and the Hep Blues Quartet 
### Ryan Blitstein Staff writer 
It's a rowdy Tuesday night at the Co Ho, and the
band's just beginning to play. A snappy blues beat
from the drummer starts it up, the bass player is
laying down a nice groove, and the guitarist's calculated
yet soulful chordplay gives the music the confident tone
of a solid Texas bar band. Then, a well-dressed, goateed
white guy steps up to the mic, eyes closed, opening his
mouth to sing. His voice, however, is not like that of your
average wannabe bluesman. Its more like that of BJ}.
King or Howling Wolf, the voice of a down-home delta
bluesman. With a solid band behind him, he stops
harmonica solo, melodic lines rippling through theW. .
The crowd cheers, appreciating the combined talents dnei
of the best musical outfits on the Stanford campus: Ware
Wendell and the Hep Blues Quartet.
The group consists of Jon Weil on, drum* Jacob
Eisenstein on bass, David Merrill on chythm and lead
guitar, and band leader Wendell on vocal*, harp, key
board, and slide guitar. The band mixes traditional, «icc
tric Chicago blues with jazz, classic soul, and funk to cre
ate a sound that is truly one of the few bright spots with
in a music scene far removed from the days when
Hendrix, The Doors, The Greatful Dead and Janis Joplin
visited during a single quarter. Although the band mem
bers prefer original material, the playlist includes many
covers and standards that they have tweaked in order to
put their own stamp on them.
The band's story began when Wendell's jazz-buff
father gave 15-year-old Ware a Junior Wells album.
"Something about it just struck me," he says. "Its raw
emotion, its honesty." He had discovered the blues, and
in a matter of months, he would be playing harmonica at
clubs in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas. Now a
senior, Wendell started the Hep Blues Quartet during his
freshman year, playing with an assortment of graduate
students. By the end of his first year at Stanford, Wendell

had found Weil, and Eisenstein and guitarist R.J. Bunnell
(who has since gone on to medical school) joined during
the next school year. When Merrill came on board in the
spring of 1998, the band was established on the Stanford
music scene. With a busy schedule that included gigs last
week at the Coffee House, Roth and Lambda Nu, you'll
be sure to have the opportunity to see them before they
play at Battle of the Bands at Toyon March 6.
Their musical backgrounds are remarkably diverse.
Besides the obvious blues artists — Wendell cites Junior
Wells as his primary influence, both vocally and on the
harp — each band member has hi# own eclectic musical
' tastes. In addition to his father's vast jazz collection,
Wendell wa* jlso privy, via his mother, to a lot of of soul
mu*ic. Merrill frequently listen* to mtL guitar.
Hisetrtfein, whose primary instrument is trumpet, has a
solid background in jazz, and is also largely influenced
by the classic rock of Paul McCartney and Led Zeppelin's
John Paul fones. Weil prefers the dark, psychedelic sound
of Pink Floyd and the rhythmically complex rock of
Ms fjHi -mmmMP
So they have the technique, but do four white boys
really have the soul to play the blues? One need look" no
further than their lyrics to answer that question. In
Wendell's original tune "My Blues," he writes,
"A Mississippi Delta black man
That's something I'll never be
It's a fact that I know
Yet I still play faithfully
I can only play my blues as they relate to me."
According to Wendell, the claim that whites don't
have the culture of the blues is ludicrous. The blues did
begin as an African-American art form, at times political
in nature. However, it is distinctly American, and the
themes of the vast majority of blues lyrics are "all about
women and money." This isn't exactly a departure from
the world of the average white man. Wendell does try to

incorporate the musical ideas of old-school blues artists
while only using those that he can relate to or make into
his own. "Guys like Johnny Winter are singing about
being on a plantation," Ware says. "If you were never on
a plantation, don't sing about it." Wendell does, however,
want to make sure that fans know the roots of the music.
"I recognize the people who originated the blues. If our
fans like what we're doing with blues, that's great; but I'd
also recommend that they eventually pick up a Muddy
Waters album to see where the music is coming from, to
/ understand its legacy."
) Although the band does have a tight, deliberate sound
at times, a large part of the group's appeal is its ability to
improvise in the live setting. In fact, the sense of cama
raderie that results from the risks of improvisation is one
the main reasons the band plays. "You're up there, four
guys on stage trying to create something," says Wendell.
"You're all constantly giving birth to something that will
die in a few minutes, trying to be original. You want it to
be during its few moments of life. If you can't
improvise well, the 12-bar form can bore the hell out of
Itai audience in a hurry. It's a challenge, but it's ultimate
ly rewarding wHen you get it right." And the band does
get it right — almost all of the time. Just ask longtime
fan, senior Eddie Zagha. "Hey, they are no Labrosse King.
But, boy, can they groove."
This combination of inventive arrangements and a
risky improvisational spirit is, in part, a reaction to what
Wendell calls "the distinctive tendency in music to not
have proficiency." He believes that, both lyrically and
musically, a lot of contemporary music, from rock to
rap, is "vacuous." Ware Wendell and the Hep Blues
Quartet want to bring the kind of music they respect to
the Stanford community. The first thing most people
think of when they're having a party is booking a DJ that
will play Puff Daddy songs. No one thinks, "Hey, let's
book a live band." The Blues Quartet hope to change
their attitude. Based on the reaction they've seen so far,
the change might be on its way.

The band's story began when Wendell's jazz-buff
father gave 15-year-old Ware a Junior Wells album.
"Something about it just struck me," he says. "Its raw
emotion, its honesty." He had discovered the blues, and
in a matter of months, he would be playing harmonica at
clubs in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas. Now a
senior, Wendell started the Hep Blues Quartet during his
freshman year, playing with an assortment of graduate
students. By the end of his first year at Stanford, Wendell

had found Weil, and Eisenstein and guitarist R.J. Bunnell
(who has since gone on to medical school) joined during
the next school year. When Merrill came on board in the
spring of 1998, the band was established on the Stanford
music scene. With a busy schedule that included gigs last
week at the Coffee House, Roth and Lambda Nu, you'll
be sure to have the opportunity to see them before they
play at Battle of the Bands at Toyon March 6.
Their musical backgrounds are remarkably diverse.
Besides the obvious blues artists — Wendell cites Junior
Wells as his primary influence, both vocally and on the
harp — each band member has hi# own eclectic musical
' tastes. In addition to his father's vast jazz collection,
Wendell wa* jlso privy, via his mother, to a lot of of soul
mu*ic. Merrill frequently listen* to mtL guitar.
Hisetrtfein, whose primary instrument is trumpet, has a
solid background in jazz, and is also largely influenced
by the classic rock of Paul McCartney and Led Zeppelin's
John Paul fones. Weil prefers the dark, psychedelic sound
of Pink Floyd and the rhythmically complex rock of
Ms fjHi -mmmMP
So they have the technique, but do four white boys
really have the soul to play the blues? One need look" no
further than their lyrics to answer that question. In
Wendell's original tune "My Blues," he writes,
"A Mississippi Delta black man
That's something I'll never be
It's a fact that I know
Yet I still play faithfully
I can only play my blues as they relate to me."
According to Wendell, the claim that whites don't
have the culture of the blues is ludicrous. The blues did
begin as an African-American art form, at times political
in nature. However, it is distinctly American, and the
themes of the vast majority of blues lyrics are "all about
women and money." This isn't exactly a departure from
the world of the average white man. Wendell does try to

incorporate the musical ideas of old-school blues artists
while only using those that he can relate to or make into
his own. "Guys like Johnny Winter are singing about
being on a plantation," Ware says. "If you were never on
a plantation, don't sing about it." Wendell does, however,
want to make sure that fans know the roots of the music.
"I recognize the people who originated the blues. If our
fans like what we're doing with blues, that's great; but I'd
also recommend that they eventually pick up a Muddy
Waters album to see where the music is coming from, to
/ understand its legacy."
) Although the band does have a tight, deliberate sound
at times, a large part of the group's appeal is its ability to
improvise in the live setting. In fact, the sense of cama
raderie that results from the risks of improvisation is one
the main reasons the band plays. "You're up there, four
guys on stage trying to create something," says Wendell.
"You're all constantly giving birth to something that will
die in a few minutes, trying to be original. You want it to
be during its few moments of life. If you can't
improvise well, the 12-bar form can bore the hell out of
Itai audience in a hurry. It's a challenge, but it's ultimate
ly rewarding wHen you get it right." And the band does
get it right — almost all of the time. Just ask longtime
fan, senior Eddie Zagha. "Hey, they are no Labrosse King.
But, boy, can they groove."
This combination of inventive arrangements and a
risky improvisational spirit is, in part, a reaction to what
Wendell calls "the distinctive tendency in music to not
have proficiency." He believes that, both lyrically and
musically, a lot of contemporary music, from rock to
rap, is "vacuous." Ware Wendell and the Hep Blues
Quartet want to bring the kind of music they respect to
the Stanford community. The first thing most people
think of when they're having a party is booking a DJ that
will play Puff Daddy songs. No one thinks, "Hey, let's
book a live band." The Blues Quartet hope to change
their attitude. Based on the reaction they've seen so far,
the change might be on its way.
