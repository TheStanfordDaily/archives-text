# Our own little avant-garde
## Jekyll and Hyde push music a bit further 
### Robin Moroney Contributing writer 
: What does your music sound like?
KALOMAS: [contemplates, then] WAAAAH!
Actually, it doesn't sound like that. But it feels that
way. "Jekyll and Hyde" is a frantic combination of all
that's good in electronic music. "We get a good col
lage going. Moments of darkness. Candy rave stuff. A
platter of beats and a variety of musical hors d'oeu
vres that the listener can pick and choose from," is
how one half of the group describes it. "We're not
house or drum-and-bass."
Anthony Kalomas and Gregg Wilson, or Jekyll
and Hyde, both sophomores, make up an attractive
pair of opposites. Wilson wears pressed shirts,
smokes a pipe, and calmly clashe* a small cOfdtifoy
jacket with blue sneaker* on a daily basis. He, appar
ently, is Dr. Jekyll. based on
Schroedinger's uncertainty principle. This is the sort
of thing he says: r
"The thing that's interesting about our generation
is that we're exposed to the parody before we
encounter the real thing. We watch "Hie MMppet
Show" do " Romeo and Julkt" 10 years before wÂ« ever
pick up Shakespeare. I think of my music as parodies
of songs that have yet to be written."
Kalomas, on the other hand, permanently looks as
if he only recently wiped the blood from his mouth.
He is Mr. Hyde. When he's not with Wilson he writes
trance and drum-and-bass music under the name
Dionysus. His tracks want you to dance. His music
floats but it's also tough like a Visigoth wielding a
sack full of break-beats.
This is the sort of thing Kalomas says:"I see
myself as this weird being that has access to elec
tronic noises and thinks they're fun."
The two have had one previous live show. They
will be at The Battle of the Bands, and will probably
be the only band without a drummer, guitarist,
bassist, or singer.
So what do they do on stage? "We have musical
puzzle pieces which we put together on the fly," says
Kalomas. "We like to leave room to improvise as well
as leave room for us to make mistakes."
They know that people fiddling with knobs on
beat boxes is not the most exciting thing to watch.

Electronic music has been most succesful in club
culture, where DJ's dissolve into the music they play
and become invisible. Kalomas and Wilson want to
give their audience more.
In their last show at Lambda Nu the pair flooded
the sound of people doing whippets over some
drum loops. "It was intense. It was as if something
was dying. These huge gulps of air. It could have
been a giant dragon," remembers Wilson.
Other Jekyll and Hyde samples: kids booing, a boy
explaining his sheep dog, a female voice repeating,
"Scratch Me. Slow Down." Like the Orb, Jekyll and
Hyde sample in order to give their tracks an extra
heartbeat, a sense of action. It can be disorientating.
They're not taking you on a musical journey. Leave
that to Pink Floyd. They're just adding gloves of steel
to their musical fists. v
l j On top of all this they want to add go-go dancers,
a projection screen, lighting effects. And if all this is
boring you, yfw can always dance. Impact is the
name of the game, whatever the costs.
INT: And what do you expect to get out of the
Battle of the Bands 112
WILSON: Ale w new fans and a lot more enemies.
They're bored with futile attempts to force new
sounds out of instruments that were exhausted long
ago. (Both Kalomas and Wilson can play the guitar,
by the way.) For them, rock music has said every
thing that it was ever going to say and now just
repeats itself in different voices. They've got a mis
sion and they've got their manifesto:
WILSON: When you listen to the radio you can
tell how a song is going to end ten seconds after it
begins. There's nowhere surprising for rock music to
go-
KALOMAS: We create our own instruments from
the voices of cute little girls to the big evil square
bass. We re-write ourselves with every performance
and we put on a different mask for every vibe.
WILSON: There's something pure about sounds
that mimic nothing and are beautiful in and of
themselves. Electronic music has moved beyond
imitation. It's its own thing.
And finally:
KALOMAS: If it ain't broke, then break it.
