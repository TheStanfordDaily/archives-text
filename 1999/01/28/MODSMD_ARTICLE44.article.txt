## 28 IF rocks the frat house

Xf Paul McCartney had indeed died at 28 as the controversy
surrounding the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper" album implies, he
wouldn't have survived to hear the sounds of 28 IF. This
new Stanford band not only takes its name from the license plate
on the Beatles'"Abbey Road" record cover but also plays a Beatles
style rock and roll.
The Beades' playful satire on the Abbey Road rumors that Paul
had died and would be replaced is mirrored in the spirit of 28 IF.
Aside from the fact that he is a diehard Beatles' fan, guitarist and
lead vocalist Ryan Blitstein says that the band's name has no spe
cial meaning: "We just think it's funny because it sounds like a
punk band's name."
The five-member band, formed in early fall quarter, made an
impressive debut at the Co Ho in November. In addition to
Blitstein, 28 IF consists of fellow sophomores Owen Hammond
(bass), Alex Parsons (guitar), and Charlie Shufeldt (keyboard and
vocals), as well as senior Jon Weil (drums).
The band describes its music as "rock 'n' roll with jazz, funk,
bluegrass, and reggae creeping into the mix." So far 28 IF has cov
ered songs by Phish, the Grateful Dead, and the Beades, among
others. According to Shufeldt, the band is also "in the process of
writing several original pieces."
The individual members bring significant musical talent and
experience to the new band. All have played their respective
instruments formally and informally for some time. Blitstein,
Hammond, and Shufeldt are former members of the Limits, a
band they started in their freshman dorm last year. Weil current
ly plays drums for both the Stanford Band and Ware Wendell's
Hep Blues Quartet, another campus group. Self-taught guitarist
Parsons transcribes complex Phish songs.
This quarter, 28 IF hopes to play at Lambda Nu, Chi Theta Chi,
EBF and the Co Ho. In addition, look for them at the upcoming
Batde of the Bands at Toyon. Also, the band says that a demo tape
"is in the works," as is a 28 IF web site. Comments Blitstein with
his characteristic sarcasm, "In the future we hope to be the most
famous band in the world. Or, we'll just break up when we grad
uate, enter the real world and play music for fun in our spare
time."
If you want to experience their sound right away, cruise by
Theta Delt or KA on Sunday afternoons. As residents, the band
members fill their respective houses with a positive vibration.
They love an audience. In Blitstein's words, "There's nothing like
being on stage, looking at your friends, having them wink at you.
Every time someone smiles, you put in an extra lick, kick it up a
notch, just for them. That's the fan part about being in a band."
Hey, if you're lucky, maybe you'll even get a lick from Blitstein.
