# Jammin' at Co Ho
## Free jazz hits Stanford. Hard.

Sometimes reading doesn't just jazz up your winter break but explodes in
chords on college campus. By picking up a Miles Davis book about the leg
endary jazz trumpeter, Jon Wagner got an inspiration now known as the
weekly Monday Jam Session at the Co Ho.
"In the '40s and '50s, described the book, jazz players would stop by after regu
lar gigs and there'd be sessions going on in Greenwich Village, New York," said
fifth-year coterm Wagner.
If it could happen on the East Coast some 50 years ago it could certainly hap
pen here. Monday, Jan. 11 witnessed the first jazzy explosion of the new year.
"We have a bass, drum and piano which form what is known as the rhythm sec
tion, plus any other musician is free to come, go up on stage and play," said fresh
man Adam Magid, die bassist. "There is a lot of emphasis on improvisation."

Improvisation is the tonal key of the group. One can expect anything to happen
at a gig. "We don't really rehearse at all," said Wagner, the drummer, "and have a
different play each week. I really wanted to get across to people that it's really inter
esting when things happen spontaneously."
Besides the rhythm section and open space for whatever musician wants to stop
by, Wagner also invites one or two new horn players a week. "I've met three so far,"
said sophomore Marisa Taylor, the pianist. "It's great to meet other players and I
really like playing different kinds of music that they like to play that I might not
have played on my own."
Or even considered playing, for that matter. After three jazzy Mondays the fer
vor of spontaneity is definitely taking root. "One guy who showed up the very first
Monday and ever since was really amazing. The solos he takes are so shocking that
I don't want to take them after him," said Taylor. The group purposefully leaves
room for the exciting and the unexpected.
"It's an experience, not a band," said Magid.
