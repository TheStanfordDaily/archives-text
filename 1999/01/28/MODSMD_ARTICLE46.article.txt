## Schmuck & Putz 'Crazy' wankers! 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko Contributing writers 
Xast week, Schmuck and Putz formally announced
that they would be reviewing applications for the
esteemed position of their bodyguard. Their offices
were flooded with resumes from such folk as Pulitzer Prize
winning professors, United States Marshals, Cowell health
workers, postal employees, SLE victims, lepers and a very
intriguing monkey named Kiquette (Kiki for short). Amidst
hundreds of applications, though, it was not hard to find the
most qualified candidate: DuVin—yes, his name means
"some wine" in French. DuVin is one of three nuile French
majors at Stanford, a scholar of Proust and a connoisseur of
fine gin. He enjoys playing Russian roulette on the weekends
and commenting on the latest New Yorker cartoons. He
speaks with a subtle French accent, though he was born and
raised in City of Industry, Calif
Since their next review assignment was the British film
"Still Crazy," a Golden Globe nominee for Best Picture
about a rock group's reunion performance, Schmuck and
Putz found it only natural to hire an intellectual for the job.
It was only after they all signed the contract that the boys
discovered that DuVin has no experience in the area of
defense. Tant pis!
San Francisco was the site of the "Still Crazy" premeire.
On the way to the city, DuVin heard "I'm Just a Girl Who
Can't Say No" from the musical "Oklahoma" on the radio,
sending him immediately into a speechless state. Unable to
control the automobile, he crashed into a Starbucks on the
side of the road — ironically, the same establishment that he
has always blamed for the downfall of American society.
This inconvenience obviously cost DuVin his job, so
please continue to send your fine applications to our ruthless
slavemaster Kong at <intermission@daily.stanfordedu>. In
the meantime, the boys luckily hitchiked their way to the
screening. Here are some of their reflections on the cinemat
ic endeavor, "StiU Crazy;"
Putz: "Still Crazy" is the type pf movie that gets away
with a lot just because it's British. Even though much of it
isn't really funny, faux intellectuals will claim that folks
like us missed the U.K. subtlety of director Brian Gibson's
craft. It centers around the band Strange Fruit, purport
edly one of the best bands of the '70s. When Tony
(Stephen Rea), now a condom salesman in Ibiza — that
reminds me: 10 free condoms at Cowell — gels the
inspired idea to reunite the group for a '90s tour, they
begin to discover just how hard making music can be.
It's a comme-ci-comme-fa cinematic conquest (say that
10 times fast!). In fact, I was particularly struck by much
of the film's smart visuals. Never before have I been so
drawn to tooth imagery. There are several shots that
include corroded dentals, most likely symbolic of both
the economic state of affairs in rural England and on a
lesser level, the lack of talent in the newly reunited group.
Close-ups of bad food also serve to reinforce this fasci
nating commentary.
There is of course — as in all British films — a charac
ter who can't be understood because his accent is too
thick. Only the words "shyte" and "wanker" are compre
hensible, but I'm sure that he had some pretty profound
things to say.

I couldn't help associate all the singing in the movie
with many of the a cappella groups on campus. It was
interesting to note the metamorphosis of the band's
sound throughout the film. While the band's early shows
gave off an air similar to that of Testimony, their later
efforts sounded more along the lines of the Harmonics.
Schmuck: Please — will someone give me a British
dictionary? Because I had no idea what the hell they said.
1 was so upset that DuVin got left behind because I des
perately needed a translator. While everyone else busted
into uproarious laughter with the mention of "wanker," I
sat cowering in my seat dreaming of a Big Mac with
American letters sprawled out across the order menu.
The only cool thing about the film was the psychedelic
bus that the group traveled in. I identified with the trav
eling life, and almost wanted to be one of the many
groupies that the alternative band attracted. It made me
nostalgic of the days when I followed Yanni across the
country. It was his classical voice that used to make my
blood curl whenever he entered the room. He used to
leave the windows on the bus open so his hair could fly in
the wind.
Putz: I got confused when all the members of the band
began working on the strip routine to make some money.
They didn't seem like the conventional type of individu
als that one might find in a erotic venue. But then, I sup
pose everything all worked out for the best when they
won the lottery and shared the winnings.
Schmuck: What the hell are you saying? You're mixing
up "Still Crazy" with "The Full Monty" and "Waking Ned
Devine."

Putz: It's all British to me.
Schmuck: Don't tell anyone, but something wonderful
has happened to me. After leaving the movie, I grabbed a
poster for my room, and as soon as I put it up, my female
visitors have tripled. Apparently, they love the British. As
soon as they come in the room, I put on some English
rock music, speak in an English accent and tell them to
stare at my English poster. They melt in my presence. All
you guys out there, take a hint; become British. One of
their favorite lines is, u I reckon it's a tad bit nippy outside."
It makes them shiver — honest! \
Putz: What about Mr. Bean? He never gets laid!
Schmuclc Elementary, my dear friend. One must not
seek out the exceptions. Take your cues from Hugh Grant,
Pierce Brosnan, Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery and
Ewan MacGregor.
Putz: But the last two are Scottish!
Schmuck: They're still part of the U.K.!
Putz: What does that mean?
Schmuck: I don't know — probably something like
"Under Kong."
Putz: Well, we're under the tyranny of the ruthless
slavemaster Kong too! That means we're practically
British!
Schmuck: Jolly good!
The Bottom line: Be British.
