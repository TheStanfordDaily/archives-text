# Movie/Video Review
## A 						story with 'Heart' Ensemble comedy is rarely finer. 
### 
Just looking at the list of actors heading the
ranks of "Playing by Heart," I could only
imagine how engaging each of the charac
ters might turn out to be. Well, guess what? The
all-star cast, led by Sean Connery as an embit
tered husband and Gillian Anderson as a
romantic with loads of painful memories,
more than covers for any coincidences and
manipulations which may spring up in any
given romantic comedy. To top it off, the plot
structure of the film, which is loosely in the
vein of "The Usual Suspects" and "The Spanish
Prisoner," perfectly unravels with magnificent
charm.
Connery stars as Paul, husband to a TV
cooking expert named Hannah (Gena
Rowlands). They are having problems after
nearly four decades of marriage. They wittily
spar at each other with jabs and poiniards. In a
way, their relationship is the most enchanting
in the film, given that they revel in the fact that
nobody really knows what their marriage is like
behind closed doors.

Anderson, meanwhile, is genuinely fascinating as the
oft-hurt Meredith, who begins to fall in love with her co
worker Trent (Jon Stewart, the new "Daily Show" host).
I am a big fan of her on "The X-Files," and after her role
in "Playing by Heart," I am convinced that she is the true
acting force behind the TV series. Her reluctant and hes
itant relationship with Trent rings truest among all the

pairings in the film.
Mark (Jay Mohr,"Jerry Maguire") and Mildred (Ellen
Burstyn) play a mother-and-son team, except this story
takes place solely in a hospital room. Mark is slowly
dying, and they mutually decide to unload a lot of bag
gage in an effort to correct all the misunderstandings
and hurt feelings between them. It tugs on the heart a bit
too much, but the vignette remains vivid in my mind.

I cared less for the rest of the characters. One
part involves Joan (Angelina Jolie, "Hackers")
and party-boy loner Keenan (Ryan Phillippe,
"54"), two star-crossed and very annoying lovers
who take an awfully long time to get to know
each other. Dennis Quaid plays Hugh, a man
who finds more imagination and pleasure from
telling fictional accounts of his life than living in
reality. Nastassja Kinski makes a brief appear
ance as one of the people who listens to Hugh's
ad-lib routines. Gracie (Madeleine Stowe, "12
Monkeys,") and Roger (Anthony Edwards, in
another decent turn from a TV actor) are mar
ried to other people and yet both meet on a fair
ly regular basis for the cheap thrill of no-strings
attached sex.
By this point, it must seem like there are too
many different stories going on at once. In a way,
the story is overloaded. It's very difficult to pull
off a movie like "Playing by Heart," but the sheer
number of characters — all given roughly equal
amounts of screen time — forces us to look at
only bits and pieces of each person's life and
personality. Sometimes, it works perfectly.

Other times, the players, especially Hugh, Grade and
Roger, appear thin and flimsy.
I still had fan with this movie. "Playing by Heart" is
playing somewhere near you, so go and seek it out You
won't regret it.
