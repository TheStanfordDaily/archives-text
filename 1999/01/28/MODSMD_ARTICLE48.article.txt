I have had a favorite actor ever since the eighth grade when I first saw "The Silence of
the Lambs." There is something about his refined charisma that makes me want to
see any movie that has his name in the credits. It wasn't until I saw Gong Li in
"Farewell My Concubine" that I started seeing movies purely for the appeal of one
actress.
Usually when I mention Gong Li, I get a confused look. Most people say, "Who, wait,
that's a woman?" I reply by saying she is probably one of the most famous film actress
es in the world. Then I mention some of the movies she's in, and an avid film buff will
probably have heard of "Farewell My Concubine." So how can she be one of the most
famous actresses in the world while being relatively unheard-of in America? My only
answer is that we Americans, in general, are scared to death of the foreign film section
of our local video store.
Gong Li's movies are in Mandarin with English subtitles. Her movies are generally
about women with hard, often depressing lives. Prostitutes, mistresses, and concubines
are her usual roles. These roles create permanent impressions for two reasons. First, her
movies are always meant to depict a period of history, and second, she has a way of
bringing hope to bleak situations.
The stories in Gong Li movies are not meant to simply jerk at your emotions; they
force you to think about what her characters represent in a historical context. That con
text is usually Chinese history. Her movies are said to be difficult, if not impossible, to
fully understand without a background knowledge of Chinese history. That being said,
I have a confession to make: I have no background knowledge of Chinese history. I hate
admitting my shortcomings, but it's the truth. However, I've never felt that I left one of
her movies without getting something out of them. This is because she makes the audi
ence empathize with her characters. I don't know why women are historically in these
situations but watching the movie makes me wonder more about it.
While I'm wondering about what each scene is "supposed" to mean, I still get a sense
of the optimism Gong Li's characters have in depressing situations. In "To Live," she
plays the wife of a rich man who gambles away the family fortune and home. She stays
with him, out of love for him and their two young children. By the end of the film, we
see the tragic deaths of both of her children. But somehow, she still has hope in her life.
Most of her characters seem to somehow survive and come to a certain peace in their
lives. The ability to show how characters can not only survive, but be content, is not only

due to good screenplays, but because of the intelligence and passion Gong Li brings to
her roles.
While making movies rich in political and historic symbolism has given her critical
acclaim, it has also caused her serious problems in her homeland. After she made "To
Live", Gong Li was banned from making another film with director Zhang Yimou for
two years, and was further banned from talking about the movie. Even though I love the
way her movies have been made in the past, I hope she will make more movies with
American ties, such as "Chinese Box", in the future. This is because the American distri
bution would probably help her break free of creative restrictions and create a wider
audience for her talents.
If you're interested in Gong Li, her movies are in the foreign film section of any self
respecting video store. These are some of the titles I recommend: "Farewell My
Concubine," "To Live," "Raise the Red Lantern," "The Chinese Box," "Ju Dou," "The
Story of Qiu Ju" and "Shanghai Triad."
