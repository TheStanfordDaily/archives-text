# Far from cinematic 'Paradise'
## James Woods is good, but little else is 
### 
TT ames Woods. He has managed to run in Hollywood for more than two decades, and
still he has not yet won an Oscar. His nominated turn in "Ghosts of Mississippi" was
j) pretty good, and so was his role as the government agent in the underrated
"Contact." Here, he again aims high, shooting off words with full gusto, but "Another
Day in Paradise" lets him down. Badly.
Director Larry Clark, who stunned us all with the excellent NC-17 feature "Kids," has
turned up a dud. The film starts promisingly enough, as we watch petty thief Bobbie
(Vincent Kartheiser) try to get his hands on vending machine change only to get inter
rupted by a hefty security guard bent on teaching Bobbie an agonizing lesson. But the
energy of the first 10 minutes quickly fades into a series of robberies, drug deals and
lessons about life.
The main problem with "Another Day in Paradise" is that it tries too hard to get us to
believe that the main four characters are acting as a pseudo-family. Mel (Woods) has a
tortured relationship with Sid (a dreadful Melanie Griffith), and he soon "adopts" his
nephew Bobbie and his girlfriend Rosie (Natasha Wagner). We see them go shopping or
eating at a diner, and these scenes drag like no others. They essentially work as down
time between crimes for the foursome.
A funny moment comes when a preacher, overplayed brilliantly by James Otis,

promises them some guns and medical help if they are ever in need. He brings some
humor to an otherwise dreadful buddies-on-the-road storyline.
But 1 did not become interested in the "final" crime to end all crimes, one that would
get all of them out of poverty (at least for the near future). Do you think that this will
turn out happily ever after for the new family? Or do you believe that it will end up in
tragedy?
It's bizarre how much Kartheiser looks like a poor man's Leonardo DiCaprio
(remember all those gritty roles before "Titanic?") or Edward Furlong. He shows glim
mers of talent, but he must remain in search for a role that allows him to broadcast those
abilities. Wagner does her job as the doting-but-protective girlfriend whose suffering is
best revealed.
"Another Day in Paradise" thankfully does not feature a remake of Genesis' song from
the '80s. But setting the film in the '70s seemed rather arbitrary (and difficult to pick up
in the first place), and I couldn't quite understand why that decade had to be chosen at
all. Perhaps if Clark had reanalyzed his plot and characters, the entire feature would be
easier to swallow — or inject, as the case may be.
