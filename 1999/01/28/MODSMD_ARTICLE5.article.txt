# Race talks draw students
## Small group discussions on race relations to be held through spring 
### Christina McCarroll 
Praised by participants and facilators in its first
year, Stanford's race dialogue groups are being re
implementcd for the 1999 winter and spring quarters.
These weekly dialogue sessions, which meet at
least six times, are designed to promote personal dis
cussion about diversity in groups of 8 t<.» 16 students.
Staff and student facilitators help establish and en
sure adherence to dialogue ground rules.
Last year's groups attracted nearly 140 students
who met in 11 small groups. They were created in re
sponse to President Clinton's Initiative on Race, a
call for national dialogue on the grassroots level as a
way to understand and reconcile racial divides.
Tommy Lee Woon, assistant dean of students and
multicultural educator, helped organize the race dia
logue groups and believes "sustained dialogue is an
important, key part of the process for promoting un
derstanding and building relationships."
"Race is a very personal issue, and race dialogues
help to facilitate open, candid, honest conversation
about such a potentially explosive issue." said Jan
Barker Alexander, assistant dean of students and di
rector of the Black Community Services Center.
Alexander co-facilitated a discussion in Columbae
last year.
Sophomore Alicia McCann said she found her La
gunita Court race dialogue a rewarding but painful
experience. "1 think we have an unfortunate tenden
cy to look at our current social situation and feel as if
the race problem has been solved, when in actuality 1
feel that the fact that it's not discussed as much [as it
was in the '60s and '70s] makes it stir around under
the surface."
Alexander recalled the impact of personal disclo-
sure in her group: "Probably one of
the most powerful discussions we
had was, "When did you realize that
race mattered?' It was very notice
able that the people of color had
gut-wrenching, heart-wrenching,
tear-jerker stories, very hurtful ex
perienes of how they realized their
race mattered .... I think that for
all of the students in the room, it
brought race to that very personal
level."
Issues of race have received spe
cial attention over the past two
weeks, following Dan Geyser's Jan.
12 column in the Daily, "Con
fronting differences honestly."
Geyser contended that an insis
tence on political correctness "sti
fles the very thoughts and discus
sions that empower those groups
most in need." In a Letter to the Ed
itor, Woon invited Geyser to join a
campus race dialogue
Though open to the idea of race
dialogues. Geyser cautioned in an
interview, "It will only help if there
are people in the group willing to
speak their minds, unchecked by

t' worry of aPC reaction similar to
the letters responding to my col
umn. That is a truly stifling force."
Alexander said she hoped that
Geyser and others would take ad
vantage of the race dialogues.
"What I do hope is that more white
men, who claim to want to under
stand. will participate, because once
they participate they won't come
away with the same Euro-centric
viewpoints."
In future dialogue groups, Woon
hopes to address issues of gender,
sexual orientation, class and reli
gion, race and religion, disability,
and their intersections.
Woon also hopes "to see more
collaboration with the academic
side in promoting dialogue. Dia
logue has been a very useful com
munity-building program in various
places around the country. It's an
opportunity for collaboration."
Woon recalled last year's assem
bly of race dialogue groups as a tes
timony to cooperation and commit
ment. "Lots of people made it hap
pen," said Woon. "It was very, very
joyful work."
