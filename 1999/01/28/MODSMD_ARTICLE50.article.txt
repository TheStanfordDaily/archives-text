# 'Another Day' in Natasha's life
## An Intermission interview 
### 
Matasha Gregson Wagner talked one-on-one with
Intermission on the phone. Wagner currently
plays the loyal girlfriend in the gritty '70s
drama, "Another Day in Paradise." She shares her views
on the Oscars, Ally Mcßeal and shooting up.
Intermission: How did you get involved in the film
industry?
Natasha Gregson Wagner: I just thought about it
while 1 was in college at Boston. I was bored. I was think
ing, "What am 1 doing here?" So I went to New York, and
1 met an acting teacher named Hal Guskin. We started
talking about acting, and then 1 made a clumsy attempt at
trying to act.
I: Were there any actors or directors whom you par
ticularly looked up to at the time? As in, this is the type
of acting genre that I'd like to hit, or this is the type of
style that I admiref
NGW: It's more something that I've become aware of
later on in life. In the beginning of my career, I think I was
finding my way and trying to figure out if acting was
something that I definitely wanted to do. I wondered if I
was any good at acting and if anyone wanted me to act for
them.
I: 1 see that you worked in "Urban Legend." That
movie was considerably different from "Another Day in
Paradise." Do you prefer working with a lot of contem
poraries or do you prefer working with older, more
established actors^
NGW: I really don't have a preference. Doing "Another
Day in Paradise" was one of my more favorite working
experiences. I wanted to play the role in "Urban Legend"
as the girl in the back scat of a car, an urban myth which
we've heard all of our lives. It sounded like something fun
to do, as opposed to the heavy, complicated movies I had
been doing.
I: And then you moved on and did an "Ally Mcßeal"
episode. I personally don't watch that program very
much, and I have heard many good things about it —
like it's the hot show of the year and Calista Flockhart Is
terrific. So what did you think of the set in generalf

NGW: I would agree with all of the stuff you men
tioned. Calista was really professional and wonderful to
work with. The writing is so top-notch on that show, and
the overall set is run like a very tight ship. I'd never done
television prime-time, and it was a wonderful first expe
rience for me.
I: Would you say that TV — where you have to pump
out an episode every week — has a different feel than
working on a movie?
NGW: Not really. In an independent film, you don't
have tons of time. You've got to get the job done, so you
work these incredibly long hours, like 17-hour days. I'd
say both are fairly similar.
I: For "Another Day in Paradise,"you got to work with
director Larry Clark. I placed his name with the movie
"Kids," which some of my friends found disturbing, oth
ers fascinating, and a few somewhere in between. Did
you get the sense that he's not the typical director in that
he implemented different techniquesf Or, was the set
more laid back than most?
NGW: It was a fairly intense feeling on the set. I don't
think it was laid-back, but rather it was electric. This film
in particular had a subject matter that was very intense,
and everyone in the film really got into their roles. Larry
is a real-life junkie, so when you work with him, you
develop an understanding for your role.
I: One of my friends had a problem with the number
of needles in the movie. I'm wondering, how were all of
those scenes filmed?
NGW: We actually shot up in the film, you see.
Actually, they were only retractable needles which defi
nitely never went under the skin. I don't think any of us
would have wanted that.
I: Did you have an aversion to needles before the film
beganf
NGWi Yes, I do have a large aversion to them. I had it
while we were shooting too. I figured out a way to get over
this. But obviously, the needles were the more uncom
fortable part of the filming.

I: In the movie, there are the two older characters,
played by James Woods and Melanie Griffith, plus the
two younger characters. Did you get a sense that there is
a parent-child relationship in the movief And did you
get any mentoring for the role as an adopted child into
the familyt
NGW: There is, indeed, such a relationship. Jimmy and
Melanie "adopted" Vincent and I in a way, and they were
obviously the more experienced actors. In my own life, I
do have two fathers, so I guess one of them adopted me in
their own way. But Jimmy is definitely a father figure in
the movie.
I: Because of the nature of the film and the implied
drug use, did you have to undergo any learning or inter
action with children or teens with drug problems?
NGW: Yeah, we did. Larry, you know, is the real thing,
so we had him stay with us the whole time. But we met
with a lot of kids who were junkies and lived the sort of
lives portrayed in the movie.
I: For all of the struggling actors and actresses out
there, do you have any advice, any words of thought,
while they are trying to get their first roles?
NGW: I guess they need to believe in what they are
doing. Maya Angelou says, in"I Know Why the Caged
Bird Sings," that you need to put your whole heart into it
and pray. I think that in this business, her words ring true.
You have to hope that you have a little luck on your side.
I don't think we have control over what the public swarms
to watch.
I: Are there any directors whom you really want to
work withf
NGW: I'd like to work with Todd Solondz ("Welcome
to the Dollhouse" and "Happiness"), the Coen brothers,
Woody Allen, Todd Haynes ("Velvet Goldmine"), and
Lisa Cholodenko ("High Art").
I: Do you have any picks for best picture this year?
NGW: To be honest, I'm going to get more involved
with the Oscars next month. I think the Oscars are great,
but there are a lot of films that get ignored. I don't think
the number of awards defines a movie.

while 1 was in college at Boston. I was bored. I was think
ing, "What am 1 doing here?" So I went to New York, and
1 met an acting teacher named Hal Guskin. We started
talking about acting, and then 1 made a clumsy attempt at
trying to act.
I: Were there any actors or directors whom you par
ticularly looked up to at the time? As in, this is the type
of acting genre that I'd like to hit, or this is the type of
style that I admiref
NGW: It's more something that I've become aware of
later on in life. In the beginning of my career, I think I was
finding my way and trying to figure out if acting was
something that I definitely wanted to do. I wondered if I
was any good at acting and if anyone wanted me to act for
them.
I: 1 see that you worked in "Urban Legend." That
movie was considerably different from "Another Day in
Paradise." Do you prefer working with a lot of contem
poraries or do you prefer working with older, more
established actors^
NGW: I really don't have a preference. Doing "Another
Day in Paradise" was one of my more favorite working
experiences. I wanted to play the role in "Urban Legend"
as the girl in the back scat of a car, an urban myth which
we've heard all of our lives. It sounded like something fun
to do, as opposed to the heavy, complicated movies I had
been doing.
I: And then you moved on and did an "Ally Mcßeal"
episode. I personally don't watch that program very
much, and I have heard many good things about it —
like it's the hot show of the year and Calista Flockhart Is
terrific. So what did you think of the set in generalf

NGW: I would agree with all of the stuff you men
tioned. Calista was really professional and wonderful to
work with. The writing is so top-notch on that show, and
the overall set is run like a very tight ship. I'd never done
television prime-time, and it was a wonderful first expe
rience for me.
I: Would you say that TV — where you have to pump
out an episode every week — has a different feel than
working on a movie?
NGW: Not really. In an independent film, you don't
have tons of time. You've got to get the job done, so you
work these incredibly long hours, like 17-hour days. I'd
say both are fairly similar.
I: For "Another Day in Paradise,"you got to work with
director Larry Clark. I placed his name with the movie
"Kids," which some of my friends found disturbing, oth
ers fascinating, and a few somewhere in between. Did
you get the sense that he's not the typical director in that
he implemented different techniquesf Or, was the set
more laid back than most?
NGW: It was a fairly intense feeling on the set. I don't
think it was laid-back, but rather it was electric. This film
in particular had a subject matter that was very intense,
and everyone in the film really got into their roles. Larry
is a real-life junkie, so when you work with him, you
develop an understanding for your role.
I: One of my friends had a problem with the number
of needles in the movie. I'm wondering, how were all of
those scenes filmed?
NGW: We actually shot up in the film, you see.
Actually, they were only retractable needles which defi
nitely never went under the skin. I don't think any of us
would have wanted that.
I: Did you have an aversion to needles before the film
beganf
NGWi Yes, I do have a large aversion to them. I had it
while we were shooting too. I figured out a way to get over
this. But obviously, the needles were the more uncom
fortable part of the filming.

I: In the movie, there are the two older characters,
played by James Woods and Melanie Griffith, plus the
two younger characters. Did you get a sense that there is
a parent-child relationship in the movief And did you
get any mentoring for the role as an adopted child into
the familyt
NGW: There is, indeed, such a relationship. Jimmy and
Melanie "adopted" Vincent and I in a way, and they were
obviously the more experienced actors. In my own life, I
do have two fathers, so I guess one of them adopted me in
their own way. But Jimmy is definitely a father figure in
the movie.
I: Because of the nature of the film and the implied
drug use, did you have to undergo any learning or inter
action with children or teens with drug problems?
NGW: Yeah, we did. Larry, you know, is the real thing,
so we had him stay with us the whole time. But we met
with a lot of kids who were junkies and lived the sort of
lives portrayed in the movie.
I: For all of the struggling actors and actresses out
there, do you have any advice, any words of thought,
while they are trying to get their first roles?
NGW: I guess they need to believe in what they are
doing. Maya Angelou says, in"I Know Why the Caged
Bird Sings," that you need to put your whole heart into it
and pray. I think that in this business, her words ring true.
You have to hope that you have a little luck on your side.
I don't think we have control over what the public swarms
to watch.
I: Are there any directors whom you really want to
work withf
NGW: I'd like to work with Todd Solondz ("Welcome
to the Dollhouse" and "Happiness"), the Coen brothers,
Woody Allen, Todd Haynes ("Velvet Goldmine"), and
Lisa Cholodenko ("High Art").
I: Do you have any picks for best picture this year?
NGW: To be honest, I'm going to get more involved
with the Oscars next month. I think the Oscars are great,
but there are a lot of films that get ignored. I don't think
the number of awards defines a movie.
