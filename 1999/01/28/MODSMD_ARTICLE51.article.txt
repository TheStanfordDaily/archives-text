In a loud bar over winter break, Miss Sass
was minding her own business, sipping a
Nijinski Blini and talking witH a friend*
Then, by a particularly alarming turn offfote, I
portly and somewhat drunk wan stood before
"Hello," said Portly. "Km reoes&ljr divorced and
have two children from a rathttt Wife. 1 sell
vacuum cleaners I nuke six fig
ures a year (wink). I'm not in the best of health,
but I thought you ladies needed a refill. Can I buy
you a drink?"
Pick-up attempts like tfets illustrate that not all
of us have mastered the science of schmooting.
This, naturally, is understandable. In the '80s,
when you wanted some companionship, you
wrapped your boa constrictor around your shoul
ders, did a little cocaine and went to the park. But
what is a '90s guy or gal to do?
Well, it's not so difficult as it sounds, my
friend, to pick up the person of your choice. You
must simply be the right person, in the right place
at the right time. Daunting as that sounds, Miss
Sass will break it down for you.
Let's start with place. Place poses a perennial
problem to the Stanford student on the make.
After all, our suburban campus was built with
education rather than socializing in the architects'
idealistic minds, a fact which is painfully clear to
most of us. The Co Ho provides the only atmos
phere on campus, but it is likely to be so crowded
that once you step inside, the mob will slowly
move you around the cash registers, near a few
tables and finally out the other door. The booth
style seating in Polio's makes a casual introduc
tion impossible, and the Corner Pocket is so lack
ing in that certain something that Miss Sass does
n't know where to begin.
For our purposes, we must look past the easy
and obvious place choices. On campus, we have
many a little cafe (Poll Sci, Education, Thai under
the Psychology Building) to make up for Tres
idder's faults. So too is Moon Bean's coffee bar
between Green and Meyer Library a hot spot for
pick-ups. And currently, the new exhibitions in
the Cantor Center and Stanford Art Gallery allow
a person's eye to roam while picking up a little
culture along the way.
It a person is brave enough to venture off cam
pus, he or she should select a destination by the
type of person he or she wishes to meet. Places
like the University Coffee Cafe, Cafe Borrone and
Printer's, Inc. will give you a dark, artsy, caffeinat
ed type. Bars, on the other hand, lend a different
sort, with Blue Chalk and Left at Albuquerque
catering to preppy intellectuals and Antonio's Nut
House serving peanut-eating pool players. And
then there is Senior Pub Night, that roving pile of
merriment that caters to, namely, seniors.
Of course, one should never be confined to rote
answers such as these. There exist as many places
to pick up people as there are cheesy lines to do it
with. Miss Sass has one friend who ha* had
tremendous luck with his lab partners, and anoth
er who swears by drunkenly wandering around
White Plaza in the wee hours (though Mias Sass
would not recommend it). Laundromats, grocery
stores, bike shops and all numbers of other loca-;
tions can be conducive to pick-tips at the right !

time.
Nog?, what is that right time, you wonder? It
starts with your target being single and relatively

brother. An acquaintance of Miss Sass and his
flmily once went to a restaurant, where a single
man of dubious intelligence proceeded to send
the mother drinks. Needless to say, the poor fellow
ignored the lady's repeated rebuffs and the fiasco
only ended when she introduced him to her chil
dren and spouse.
Dense as he was, the man did start out right.
The gesture of buying a person a drink remains a
timeless pick-up. Some people choose to ask their
potential partner if and what they would like, and
others buy the drink first and ask questions later.
As an aside.it doesn't have to be a drink at all â€”
a plate of nSKJIos or a slice of cake will warm a
man's or woman's heart just as quickly as an Irish
coffee.
At this point, you may actually get to talk to
someone. Either you've taken the initiative and
sidled suavely up to his or her table, or your mark
has beckoned you over. Now is the "Right Person"
part, so listen up. No matter how tempting it is,
how dashingly clever you are or how many times
its worked before, don't use a line. People can spot
a line a mile away and it does nothing but make
them feel like pieces of anonymous meat. Unless,
of course, you can pull it off with some panache,
in which case, carry%i.
Having gotten you started, Miss Sass will let
you take it from here. One final thing, though.
Nothing kills a pick-up like subetanceless small
talk. Though necessary, flavorless bantering about
classes and majors must quickly be stepped over.
Surely he or she will say something which you
could actually talk about, so jump at it. The per
son will be most impressed.
Oh, one more thing, sweetie. Keep your head
about you. One friend of Miss Sass was followed
five blocks by a concert pianist, only to hear when
she finally stopped to listen, that he wished they
could make beautiful music together. Another
friend once walked through a London park with a
co-worker who, out of the blue, brought out his
member, wiggled it around and exclaimed, "This
is how we do it in Nigeria." Granted, passion
makes people do funny things, but for goodness'
sake, mind your p's and q's when you're the one
doing the picking up.
