As one of a handful of employees from SLAC's first
years. Feundeling played an instrumental role in the insti
tution's development over the past three decades.
"I le was extremely knowledgeable about SLAC, since
he was here almost from the inception, said Karen
Kruger. Fucndeling's assistant for eight years. "I lis institu-

master's in business administration in
1958, Fuendeling began his career at

of his death, he worked as assistant di
rector of business services.
"We'll miss his depth of knowl
edge," said Jobe, who began working
with Fuendeling in 1975. "He was

ance. He let you do the job," said
