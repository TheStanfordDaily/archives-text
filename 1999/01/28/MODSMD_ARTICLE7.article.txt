# Sexy radio show ruled campus airwaves
## 'Stanford Sadie' made men go crazy in early KZSU days 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
Long before Roxv Sass was
burning up the back page of The
Daily's Intermission section with
Free Sexx. a frank sexual advice
column, another mysterious
femme fatale ruled the airwaves at
Stanford's then-fledgling radio sta
tion KSIJ (now KZSH).
After the opening strains of
"Love for Sale," the sexv voice of
Stanford Sadie lured men away
from their studies every Monday
night for 15 years beginning in

1947.
"The Sadie show \v;is hot." said
alumnus CStewart (iillmor. ( lass
of '60. now a visiting professor of
electrical engineering.
Sadie was so hot that popular
student hang-outs closed early on
Monday nights due to a lack of cus
tomers. But not everyone was
amused by what they heard crack
ling over the radio waves. As a re
sult. Sadie was a frequent visitor to
the dean's office, where she had to
answer for the racv content of her

on-air banter that often began in a
breathy whisper.
"Oh my lovers, especially my
babies at Wilbur, of course it's
me — Stanford Sadie," a typical
show would start. "I've been wait
ing all week to tell you about all the

love I have for you, and my latest
adventures."
Not surprisingly, every red
blooded male whose heart raced at
Sadie's sultry confessions would
have given his eye-teeth to have a
date with her. But who was she?
And how to guess which twin-set
and-saddle-shoe-wearing coed
transformed herself into a sultry
siren each week?

It wasn't easy to find Sadie be
cause Sadie wasn't just one woman.
There were several — a new voice
each quarter. Gillmor estimates
that there were two dozen Sadies in
all. Her identity would he unveiled
on her final show, followed by a
pin-up style photo and profile —
including measurements, hair and
eye color — in The Daily.
Mary Hill Skougaard. Class of
'50, was Sadie during her junior
and senior years. Her identity was
safe since everyone assumed that
as the radio station's manager, she
had her hands full.
For Skougaard, adopting
Sadie's personality wasn't as easy
as she thought it would be. She had
plenty of experience performing on
stage but sitting down in front of a
microphone was a different experi
ence.
"I froze!" Skougaard laughed.
In order to cure her stage fright,
Skougaard's producer gave her a
little apple juice laced with liquor,
and Sadie emerged.
As for her scripts, Skougaard re
called how they were filled with
sexual innuendo and double enten
dres, especially around the time of
Big Game. One script had Sadie
telling listeners how she visited the
team to ensure a Stanford victory
— and came away with chalk marks
all over her back.
Some Sadies claimed not to un
derstand half of what they read out
on the air. Others co-wrote their
scripts.
Skougaard didn't, but she was
wise to the game.
"I never showed my Mommy,"
she said of her scripts.
The Sadie show started the
same year that the first post-World
War II class entered Stanford.
Male freshmen were largely veter
ans. They were older, and they had
seen something of the world. They
were also accustomed to hearing

steamy wartime radio shows, de
signed to comfort troops far from
home, on which the Sadie show was
modeled.
"They were serious about their
education," Skougaard said. "They
wanted to get out there and get
started with life. They'd gone
through tough times. But they also
needed a release, and their release
wasn't as simple —it was much
more sophisticated. My mission
was to woo the men away from
their studies, and into a more laid
back position." (Pun intended.)
Both Skougaard and Gillmor
doubt that a Sadie-style show could
still run today in our climate of po
litical correctness.
According to Skougaard, such a
show could only survive in the time
during and immediately after
World War 11.
" The World War II vets listened
to these types of programs," she
said. "It meant something to
them."
Perhaps she's right. The Sadie
show was canceled in 1958 when
the Federal Communications
Commission suspended KZSU's li
cense for interfering with a neigh
boring radio frequency as well as a
history of other pranks. KZSU re
turned to the air in 1960, and pro
ducers tried to revive the Sadie
show, but to no avail.
"The end of an era," writes Gill
mor in his history of KZSU's early
years. "Times had changed."
Gillmor served as a KZSU pro
ducer in 1960 and will give a talk
about the Stanford Sadie show and
the early years of KZSU radio
broadcasting today at 4:15 p.m. in
the Tresidder Oak Room.
Gillmor's presentation today is
part of a public meeting of the
Stanford Historical Society. Sk
ougaard is expected to attend, as
well as other members of the early
KZSU team.
