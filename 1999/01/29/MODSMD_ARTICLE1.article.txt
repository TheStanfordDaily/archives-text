## Federal aid to go on line 
### Jad Fakhry 
Vice President Al Gore an
nounced a program last Friday that
will allow students to monitor and
control their federal financial aid ac
counts on the World Wide Web.
Gore unveiled this program as part of
his larger initiative to enhance gov
ernment services through technolo
gy. The pilot program. Access Amer
ica for Students, will be tested at eight
colleges across the country.
While Stanford is not participat
ing in the pilot program, Cynthia
Hartley, director of student awards,
noted that "a tool to monitor the pro

cessing of federal aid applications
would be very helpful."
She also said that the ability for
students to see their debt history is
extremely valuable.
Students in the program will be
given a Web account. They will also
be able to apply for aid on this Web
site. After submitting applications,
students can monitor their status and
eligibility.
Students will also receive a debit
card for receiving aid funds and mak
ing payments for academic, living
and academic-related expenses. The
accounts will also allow students to
file their tax returns, get information

about job opportunities and intern
ships. make reservations at national
parks and apply for passports.
The pilot program tests will be
held this fall. By the fall of 2(XX), the
project will be extended to 50 more
colleges. By 2(X)1 all students with In
ternet access will be allowed to par
ticipate.
"With this new initiative, any stu
dent in the United States will be able
to use a special Web site on the Inter
net to gain access to the services they
need the most," Gore said.
Hartley explained that most Stan-
ford students' financial aid is com
prised of only a small portion of fed
eral financial aid.
"Most financial aid at Stanford is
only student loans and all other
money is University money or out
side money," Hartley said.
"FAFSA application monitoring
is less valuable to Stanford than other
schools whose students only have

FAFSA aid."
She explained that the program
will be helpful for students with fed
eral student loans, including Perkins
and Stafford.
Hartley noted that "this program
will only offer limited cost savings to
Stanford students or administration."
The savings will derive from the
fact that students currently use Stan
ford's automated telephone system
to receive a copy of their loan history.
This program would make this loan
history Web-accessible.
