## Missouri governor grants Pope's plea, spares death row inmate 
### 
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Gov. Mel Carnahan honored a per
sonal request for merey from Pope John Paul II and spared a triple murder
er from the death chamber yesterday, a day after the pontiff strongly con
demned capital punishment in a visit to St. Louis.
Carnahan, a Baptist, commuted Darrell Mease's death sentence to life
without parole. Mease, 52, was convicted of killing a drug-dealing partner and
the man's wife and grandson in southwest Missouri in I^BB.
Mease was supposed to be executed on Feb. 10, although it originally had
been scheduled for the week of the pope's visit, then was postponed with no
explanation.
Carnahan, a popular Democrat planning a run for Senate next year, said
the pope did not address specifics of Mease's case. The governor also said he
does not plan to look differently at other death penalty cases.
"I continue to support capital punishment, but after careful consideration
of his direct and personal appeal and because of a deep and abiding respect
tor the pontiff and all he represents, 1 decided last night to grant his request,"
Carnahan said Thursday.
The commutation was a rare victory for the pope, who has failed in other

attempts to block U.S. executions, most recently that of Karla Faye Tucker,
who was put to death in Texas last year for two pickax killings.
The pope praised the "generous decision" of the governor when he
learned the news, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Thursday.
Laura Higgins Tyler, an attorney for Mease, said the inmate was
"awestruck."
"Darrell has remained very steadfast to his faith in that he would receive
relief from God," she said. "I'd say this sure looks like a miracle to me."
During a morning Mass on Wednesday at the Trans World Dome in St.
Louis, the pope made his most explicit anti-death penalty comments ever in
the United States.
"I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a consensus to
end the death penalty, which is both cruel and unnecessary," the pope said in
his 30-minute homily.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Vatican's secretary of state. Cardinal
Angelo Sodano, met with Carnahan and relayed the pope's plea for Mease.
Later, the pope, after a prayer service at a St. Louis church, came down off
the altar and personally asked the governor to "extend mercy" to Mease,

Carnahan said.
In July 1997. the pope appealed on behalf of Joseph O'Dell, an inmate in
Virginia eondemned to die for the rape, torture and murder of a woman.
O'Dell was executed.
One of his earliest death-penalty pleas was for Paula Cooper, in 1987. The
18-year-old Indiana woman was sentenced to death for the stabbing of an
elderly Bible teacher. Her sentence was commuted to 6() years.
Carnahan s decision could hurt him in his challenge of Republican Sen.
John Ashcroft, because most Missouri voters favor capital punishment, polit
ical analysts said.
"God help him if there are any grieving relatives, because he will need the
pope to come back to campaign for him," said University of Virginia politi
cal scientist Larry Sabato.
Mease murdered Lloyd J. Lawrence, 69; his wife, Frankie M. Lawrence,
56; and their grandson, William Lawrence, 19, on May 15, 1988.
Mease confessed that he had hidden along a path near the Lawrences'
farmhouse and shot them with a 12-gauge shotgun while they rode by on all
terrain vehicles.
