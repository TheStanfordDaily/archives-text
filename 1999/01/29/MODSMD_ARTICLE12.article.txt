## Editor's Farewell Bidding a boozy bye-bye 
### 
The suit guy bids adieu
to the staff and readers
of the Daily, Vol. 214

Generally, i feel that when
someone behaves in an odd or
eccentric fashion, he owes the
world an explanation of why he's doing it. It
has often occured to me that editing a cam
pus newspaper is a pretty strange way to
behave, so before I step down, I should
explain my motives somehow.
Unfortunately, there isn't a particularly
simple explanation. Editing the Daily
doesn't really serve my present career
ambitions, and while the money's adequate,
I could be making the same for less work
elsewhere. After four months in which l put
out 70 papers, edited several hundred arti
cles and flirted perilously with malnutrition,
I have no better explanation than to say
that I loved it.
I loved it for lots of reasons. Some
amount of it comes from within myself.
Although I've had some fine lessons in
humility along the way, I have never taken
as much personal pride in anything as in my
work here. I've run an efficient operation,
and I think I've given people something
that was worth reading. I knew I could do
both of those things when I started, but I
didn't know I'd love doing it. Therefore,
more explanation is required.
The real reasons I've loved this job come
from outside, from you all out there who
are reading. As editor, I've seen and
learned about bits of this university that
never would have entered the world of the
slightly reclusive classics major I am in civil
ian life. I can't express how stimulating
and exciting that is. I can't recall a paper
that didn't have some article in it that left
me fascinated and eager for more. That's
the kind of place Stanford is, and you're the
people who make it that way. You've been
a joy to cover. I hope that I gave some of
that joy back to you, along with simply

informing you of what went on. I have
loved this university since day one, and this
job has given me more reasons to love it
than I could have found any other way.
I feel like I should particularly thank
Stanford's athletes. I am myself completely
unathletic, and much as I enjoy watching
my favorite sports, I always seem to be edit
ing a newspaper or doing something else
foolish and seldom have a chance to see a
game. Reading and hearing about you has
been my evening's excitement and adven
ture all fall. It's a fine pleasure to read
about people at such a peak of achieve
ment.
Peaks of achievement are in plentiful
supply at Stanford. In between the gazillion
little details that mostly make up my job,
I've had a chance to learn about a lot of
those peaks, and that's why I've loved this
job. Thank you all.
I hope everyone at the Daily knows that
it goes without saying I've loved working
with you all. I don't know where I'll end up,
but I'll never again see the combination of
talent, energy, comradeship and fun that
I've found in this staff. I wouldn't have
missed you guys for anything.
I do have one last thank you, to the two
journalists who are responsible for my
being in this position â€”my parents. If
either of you ever reads this, all the love for
my job I've talked about here would have
been impossible without your examples.
With that, I'm going to leave you and go
read something obscure. I have a lot of
other plans, things to do that have been on
hold for tot) long. I'm a little burned out and
extremely tired: I'm relieved that someone
else is going to take the reins, but, for the
chance I had to hold them for a while, I'm
gladder than I know how to say.
