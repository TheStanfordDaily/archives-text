Lauren vs. her tutorial
advisor: Round
Two
Lauren (concluding a
reading):
you, at my left, shuffle in
dust
a stranger at right drips

mucus
on the rails and
i trace my fingers in dirty lines.
Advisor Another vignette. You don't have
opinions about anything, do you?
Lauren: No, right here I'm saying that —
Advisor Your poetic voice is drawing in
snot.
Lauren: Listen, I'm absolutely political. /
even write a column about —
Advisor World affairs? Gender issues?
Lauren: (as advisor's dog gnaws on her
ankle): More like vignettes.
(Advisor 2, Lauren 0)
The British lady is right as usual. I spend
a lot of time telling stories, and not nearly
enough making sweeping pronouncements
about the Stanford community.
I don't vote. 1 don't watch the news. I
don't mock the post office, the Greeks or lit
tle men who mock those things; I begin sen
tences with personal pronouns and contem
plate my navel on a disturbingly regular
basis.
The University deserves blatant endorse

ments now and again, and there's no time
like the present. This journalist, then, is
pleased to announce that she is heartily in
favor of such things as:
1. Dead People
Dead people don't whine about their
Honors theses. They don't carry placards in
White Plaza that condemn everyone to Hell,
and they certainly don't stare at women's
legs from corner tables at the Coffee House.
Cemeteries, moreover, are elegant places to
commune with the past; rousing elegies are
invariably composed therein.
2. The Gypsy Den cafe and reading room
(2930 Bristol St., Costa Mesa, Calif., 92626)
A trip to the Den requires advanced
planning, as it is a seven-hour drive from
Palo Alto when Highway 5 isn't glutted with
tomato trucks; it is nestled, however, in the
heart of mighty Orange County, and its
open mike nights are worth the gasoline.

4. Flaming Samhuca
Imbibing fire and pricey Spanish liqueur
is more socially acceptable than. say. activat
ing alarms and evacuating one's dorm
because a) Stanford Directories can't
smother burning trash cans and b) painting
light bulbs with nail polish is, in the final
analysis, right out.

5. from David Foster Wallace's "Infinite
Jest":
"Her silhouette leans and says, 'And Lo,
for the Earth was empty of Form, and void.
And Darkness was all over the Face of the
Deep. And We said: 'Look at that fucker
Dance.'"
6. Paul Kerschen
He is the last trumpet player in the world.
There is very little distance between the
instructional first-person narrative and snot
drawing. Take the stories and the judge
ments, Stanford, and apply them where it
suits you; it wasn't and isn't my job to order
you about.
My roommate, who has impeccable taste
in an infinite number of things, told me four
months ago that a well-intentioned colum
nist offers bits of herself that are worth read
ing, and those opinions are the ones that are
worth her time. Ironically, she liked the
"mucus poem" that my tutor brutalized; the
drawing I mentioned was a tracing of my
palm across a stranger's hand in subway
graffiti.
7. Connection
I like that.

Lauren Oster is a junior majoring in
English.
