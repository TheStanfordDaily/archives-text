Sixth Man is doing its job
After reading Paul Hoffman's Jan. 26 let
ter about the arrogance and rudeness of the
Sixth Man Club, I was confused. It made me
reconsider why we have a Sixth Man Club
and what advantages there are to playing a
basketball game at Maples.
At every basketball game I have attended
this year. I have mocked, booed and heckled
almost every player on the opposing team.
Am I an arrogant and evil fan? No, 1 am sim
ply doing what every other loyal Sixth Man
should do — helping my team to win. By
taunting the opposite team, we hope to dis
rupt its concentration and consequently give
our team a mental advantage.
1 wasn't around when Randy Duck was
taunted, but I'm certain that the Sixth Man
Club did not doubt his love for his university,
nor did it matter whether or not he tried to
be a gtxxl student. Iliey simply did their job.
As for giving the visiting team dignity and

respect, why would any basketball fans
applaud the other team? There would be no
such thing as home-court advantage. This is
not an example of our dislike for California
schools, since we heckle every team that
comes to Maples as do other schools to visit
ing teams. We are not snobs. We are true
fans.
BEAT CAL!

Failing to fight against hate
crimes is to condone them
On Sunday. Jan. 24, two members of the
Stanford community came upon my Web
page after a night of "intense studying" and
then used my name and information given
about me on my Web site to send hateful e
mails. These e-mails, which appeared to be

written by myself, maliciously attacked oth
ers, using bigoted epitaphs, homophobic
slurs and violent language. These individuals
have admitted to these crimes, and asserted
that they are apologetic but that they sent
these e-mails out of "late night craziness."
I do not know why fate led them to land
on my Web site, or why they chose to use my
name to purvey their malice. But 1 have
found myself in a situation not of my choos
ing and am being told by these individuals to
brush it aside. Their implication is that 1
should not pursue judicial action against
them because they sent these e-mails out in
jest, and this supposedly had no connection
to me. Their arguments, however, have
failed to persuade me, and reveal a psychol
ogy of bigotry that has been pervasive on our
campus, and has allowed us to justify hate
crimes if they are considered misguided but
not necessarily intolerable late-night antics.
Like the Bollards hate crime, which occurred
while a student was intoxicated, this crime
could be dismissed as another act of night

time craziness. I am outraged.
Mate crimes should never be acceptable
on our campus, in our community. Some
years ago I might have laughed at remarks
that people consider to be harmless — about
how "something is gay," or how so and so is
"such a fag," because I did not. indeed could
not. understand what it must be like to grow
up in fear of yourself, in a world where many
detest you and you are encouraged to hide or
to vainly attempt to change an integral part
of yourself. I realize now, those seemingly
harmless comments are devastating.
Indeed it is this mild, yet constant form of
sanctioned bigotry, those "harmless" jokes,
those late-night, drunken comments, that
steadfastly separate an "us" from a "them."
They are the foundations of hatred, the
mother of prejudice. It is not bigotry that
births these comments, but these comments
that give birth to bigotry.
Hatred is learned and we are its teachers
every time we use its language, or remain
silent when it is heard. If we as a community

remain silent as these individuals defraud me
and propagate hatred, we become the bigots.
We pass on a legacy of inhumanity. I cannot
let this be.
Fraud, slander, character assassination
and bigotry must not be allowed in a com
munity of scholars. These crimes, however,
are even more heinous when they are com
bined with cowardice. Had these e-mails
been sent in their own names, perhaps we
would hear nothing of it. But they were sent
in mine, and now I present this to you so that
we can address these wrongs as a communi
ty-
Do we, as a community, through our judi
cial system collaborate to propagate hateful
threats and homophobia, or do we take a dif
ficult stand against hatred and teach these
individuals, and ourselves, the consequences
of hatred and the lessons of equality, free
dom and love?
