THESE ARE SAD, sad times.
America has suffered a horrible
tragedy we must all face together so
that we all might heal. Michael Jordan has
retired.
Melodrama aside, I'm adding an article
to the national swarm because Michael
Jordan has been an important person to
America. Left standing with his arm raised
in grand form and the world watching, the
greatest winner in the history of American
sports nailed the shot and ended his career
in perfection. I'm also from Chicago. His
aura is worth staring at once more before
it disappears.
Jordan retires to his wife, kids and fab
ulous home having made $80 million last
year ($35 million for basketball, $45 mil
lion for endorsements). He leaves with his
fifth league MVP and sixth NBA champi
onship in eight years.
He is America's most beloved citizen,
both here and abroad. People wear Jordan
gear in L.A. and New York, in Mexico and
Morocco. Whole college basketball teams
have his likeness embroidered on their

uniforms.
But Jordan's universal appeal is a.i idea
not without problems, and the darker
points of his career demand attention
along with the records and awards. In the
end, though, the unfortunate moments
can't cast a shadow on genuine radiance.
It may be a problem that this man was
only a basketball player. He has dictated
what American kids eat, drink, wear and
dream about for 14 years. Yet. unlike a
Muhammad Ali or even a Doug Flutie, he
has never used the public attention to
voice political opinions, moral pedagogy
or broad messages of any sort.
Jordan has become fabulously wealthy
and universally known for his basketball
skills, his public demeanor and little else.
Concern over the status of professional
athletes is by no means restricted to Jor
dan or to basketball. They make ludicrous
amounts of money and draw admiration
that would be better focused on people
who compete against hardship or pain.
But some athletes deserve our adula
tion, and Jordan is one of them. Where

else in humanity could we watch grace,
excellence and a pure will to win, 80 odd
times a year? His work ethic matches his
physical prowess to create the most per
fectly conditioned athlete imaginable.
Jordan refused with all of his being to
fail, and I believed he was infallible. If he
had the shot, he took it, and if he missed I
pretended it didn't happen. It usually went
in.
Off the court but on camera, he main
tained game-like poise unrivaled in mod
ern celebrities. He was articulate, friendly
and charismatic in interviews, and this
charm carried over into marketing and
even the movies.
Sporadic accounts, however, made
some gasp and consider that we may have
been tricked, and that Jordan might just be
a perfectly crafted media facade.
In 1994. Sam Smith's book, "The Jor
dan Rules," gave appalled readers their
first reason to question Jordan's outward
ly flawless character. The controversial
book tells stories of disgruntled team
mates and a domineering, egomaniacal

MJ. Tales of temper tantrums and front
office rows forced Jordan fans to look a lit
tle harder at their outwardly angelic hero.
His character sustained another jab in
1995 when a man with suspected Mafia
connections was found dead with three
checks from Jordan totaling $108,000. It
sounded terrible, but public attention
faded.
It seems Michael has a penchant for
gambling big money. But who cares? It's
only illegal in some states. What else are
you going to do with $80 million a year?
More powerful than either of these
periods of public scrutiny was Jordan's
fling with mediocrity. When he retired
from basketball in his prime and started a
dubious baseball career, his memory
seemed doomed to a degree of failure.
When he returned to the Bulls mid-season
wearing a foreign number and dragging a
bit. his game seemed fated to decline.
The Bulls lost to the Orlando Magic in
the playoffs that year. Jordan played poor
ly. The feeling of disillusionment from see
ing Jordan come up short for the first time

was enough to make me cry.
One year later, the Bulls won the cham
pionship and Jordan was back to the status
of a demigod. Then they won two more
championships in a row. both of which fea
tured Jordan as MVP.
And now we're back to where we start
ed. An American kid laments the loss of
his hero.
Michael Jordan was a perfect physical
specimen and a perfect gentleman. He was
a victim of the paparazzi and a friend of
the press. He showed American kids what
it means to win with class and lose with
concealed revulsion. He was a perfect ath
lete and as good a person as any forced to
endure the blinding spotlight for so long.
If I could be like Mike, I would leave
exactly as he did. If 1 could be like Mike!

who were personally offended. He would
also like to have Phi Delt back. Please?
