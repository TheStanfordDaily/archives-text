## Terry's shot is nail in Cardinal's coffin 29 points for Arizona guard 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
TUCSON, Ariz â€” Last night's matchup between No. 3
Stanford and No. 13 Arizona was supposed to feature a
head-to-head duel between what could be the best two
players in the conference:
Wildcat point guard Jason Terry, an explosive ball
handler and scorer who controls the reins of a young
team and Cardinal floor leader Arthur Lee. who runs
Stanford's methodical offense then takes over the game
in the crunch.
But last night Terry stole the show as he piled on a
game-high 29 points en route to Arizona's 78-76 upset of
the Cardinal.
And as if his prolific offense and stifling defense
weren't enough, Terry saved the best for last. After
Stanford reserve Jarron Collins sank two free throws to
knot the score at 76, Terry took the matter into his own
hands.
With 11.5 seconds remaining in the game, Terry drib
bled the length of the court with Cardinal senior off
guard Kris Weems covering him. Terry made it to the
left side of the key, spun to his right and sank an eight
foot, fall-away jumper with Weems' hand in his face and
only 3.4 seconds remaining.
It was the type of play that opponents might have
come to expect of the Cardinal, and more precisely, Lee.
The senior has had enough dramatics in his career, es
pecially his game-winning plays at the end of last week
end's victory against Washington in Maples Pavilion.
In effect, the Cardinal was given a taste of its own
medicine.
"He came out really aggressive on offense. He took it
a lot in transition," Lee said. "We talked about [me cov
ering him for the final shot], but I had four fouls and Kris
was doing a good job defending him. We still had an op
portunity at the end, but it just didn't go in."
While Terry was in the spotlight all night, Lee was
held to only 10 points on the evening, hit only two shots
from the field, and was a miserable 0-for-6 from the floor
during the first half.
Terry's performance probably made him the hands
down favorite for Pacific 10 Conference Player of the
