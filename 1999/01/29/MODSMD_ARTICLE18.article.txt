TUCSON. Ariz. — The No. 3
Stanford men's basketball team
has made a name for itself by mak
ing the impossible come true, win
ning a number of close games with
dramatic comebacks.
So last night, after Arizona
guard Jason Terry's eight-foot
jumper with 3.4 seconds remaining
gave the Wildcats a 78-76 lead,
there was still hope for the Cardi
nal.

But as Kris Weems' last effort
from beyond the three-point arc
sailed way short and into the hands
of A.J. Bramlett,the Cardinal's 13-
game winning streak had been
snapped and the Wildcats had
sliced Stanford's Pacific 10 Confer
ence lead in half.
A raucous crowd at the McKale
Center was a huge factor in the
outcome of the game, but Terry
was the real Cardinal-killer, scor
ing 29 points and baffling the Stan
ford defense all night long.
"It was a tough ballgame," said
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Arizona played ex
tremely well. We were fortunate to
be down only four at the half con
sidering they shot 59 (percent] in
the first half and we shot 37. They
got great individual performance,
especially from Jason Terry."
Terry's game-winning heroics

were actually set up by a pair of
huge free-throws by Stanford
sophomore forward Jarron Collins
with 11.5 seconds left.
Ironically, Collins had missed
the front end of a one-and-one a
minute and a half earlier with Stan
ford trailing 74-72.
But he was perfect when it mat
tered most, even though a laser
beam was being shined in his eyes
from the student section, which
prompted Arizona Coach Lute
Olson to get on the PA system and
address the fans.
The Collins free-throws and
Terry's spinning jumper were the
culmination of an exciting half of
basketball that featured 10 lead
changes.
After Stanford came out of
halftime trailing 40-36, the Cardi
nal orchestrated four minutes of
fury and capped off the comeback
with a Peter Sauer lay-in with 15
minutes, 57 seconds remaining to
take its first lead of the half.
Yet time and again the Wildcats
were able to create high percent
age shots for Terry, Bramlett and
the other Arizona front court play
ers.
And more often than not, those
shooters made Stanford pay for
defensive breakdowns.
"We didn't do a very good job
defensively," Montgomery said.
"They shot the ball extremely well.
We had trouble defending at the
post and they didn't make many
mistakes."
The Cardinal, as usual, was able
to counter with several clutch shots
in the second half. Without a few
crucial three-pointers that silenced
the rowdy red-clad fans, Stanford
would not have been in the game
late.
The surprising thing is that once
the Cardinal did find itself leading
by four after a Weems three-point
er from the corner, it folded with
the lead and was unable to hold on.
Repeated fouls on the post
center Tim Young picked up his
fifth on a questionable call with
2:50 remaining — sent Bramlett
and Terry to the line for free points.
Then, with just under a minute
left in the game, Arizona forward
Richard Jefferson went flying into
Stanford's Mark Seaton, who ap
peared to draw the charge.
No call was made, Jefferson
backed up and nailed a 12-foot
fade-away to give the Wildcats a

four-point cushion.
Just 10 seconds later, Weems
was fouled off an inbounds play
and converted both freethrows to
cut the Arizona lead in half.
On the ensuing Wildcat posses
sion. Collins grabbed the rebound
of off a Jefferson miss, was fouled
and walked 90 feet for the afore
mentioned biggest free throws of
his career.
And then it was time for Terry to
single-handedly end the game with
a circus shot over Weems that
looked good from the second it left
the dazzling Wildcat's hand.
"I was just trying to keep him
from shooting where he wanted
to," Weems said.
"I didn't want to foul him. It just
went in somehow. It was a great
shot." he added.

After it was all over, the Cardi
nal saw a stat sheet that would have
produced a win on many other
nights in many other arenas.
All live starters finished in dou
ble figures, led by Weems with 18.
The Cardinal outrebounded Ari
zona, the Pac-10's leading team on
the glass, 36-29.
And Stanford was 17-22 from
the free-throw line, way better than
its team average so far this season.
In the end. however, the Cardi
nal did not get enough production
from two of its stars. Arthur Lee
(10 points) and Mark Madsen
(I lpts.) Lee made only 2of 11 shots
from the field.
"It was a real tough game," Lee
said. "But we had an opportunity to
win at the end. We just didn't capi
talize."
