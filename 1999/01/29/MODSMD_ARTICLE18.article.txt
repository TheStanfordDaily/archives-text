TUCSON. Ariz. — The No. 3
Stanford men's basketball team
has made a name for itself by mak
ing the impossible come true, win
ning a number of close games with
dramatic comebacks.
So last night, after Arizona
guard Jason Terry's eight-foot
jumper with 3.4 seconds remaining
gave the Wildcats a 78-76 lead,
there was still hope for the Cardi
nal.

But as Kris Weems' last effort
from beyond the three-point arc
sailed way short and into the hands
of A.J. Bramlett,the Cardinal's 13-
game winning streak had been
snapped and the Wildcats had
sliced Stanford's Pacific 10 Confer
ence lead in half.
A raucous crowd at the McKale
Center was a huge factor in the
outcome of the game, but Terry
was the real Cardinal-killer, scor
ing 29 points and baffling the Stan
ford defense all night long.
"It was a tough ballgame," said
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Arizona played ex
tremely well. We were fortunate to
be down only four at the half con
sidering they shot 59 (percent] in
the first half and we shot 37. They
got great individual performance,
especially from Jason Terry."
Terry's game-winning heroics

were actually set up by a pair of
huge free-throws by Stanford
sophomore forward Jarron Collins
with 11.5 seconds left.
Ironically, Collins had missed
the front end of a one-and-one a
minute and a half earlier with Stan
ford trailing 74-72.
But he was perfect when it mat
tered most, even though a laser
beam was being shined in his eyes
from the student section, which
prompted Arizona Coach Lute
Olson to get on the PA system and
address the fans.
The Collins free-throws and
Terry's spinning jumper were the
culmination of an exciting half of
basketball that featured 10 lead
changes.
After Stanford came out of
halftime trailing 40-36, the Cardi
nal orchestrated four minutes of
fury and capped off the comeback
with a Peter Sauer lay-in with 15
minutes, 57 seconds remaining to
take its first lead of the half.
Yet time and again the Wildcats
were able to create high percent
age shots for Terry, Bramlett and
the other Arizona front court play
ers.
And more often than not, those
shooters made Stanford pay for
defensive breakdowns.
"We didn't do a very good job
defensively," Montgomery said.
"They shot the ball extremely well.
We had trouble defending at the
post and they didn't make many
mistakes."
The Cardinal, as usual, was able
to counter with several clutch shots
in the second half. Without a few
crucial three-pointers that silenced
the rowdy red-clad fans, Stanford
would not have been in the game
late.
