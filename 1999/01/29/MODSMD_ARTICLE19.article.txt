# Baseball in January — Card hosts Bulldogs
## 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Most baseball teams like to start their
season with a bang.
Tonight at Sunken Diamond, Stan
ford is leaving nothing to chance.
Whether or not the No. 7 Cardinal
plays well in its season-opening series
against Fresno State, Stanford fans will be
treated to a show. Following tonight's 5
p.m. game, the same company that works
with the Oakland As and San Francisco
Giants will put on the first-ever fireworks
show at Sunken Diamond.
However. Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said he does not need to see
any explosive play during the game.
"I would like to see steady, solid de
fense and see the ball thrown over the
plate," he said. "That's the key — throw a
lot of strikes and play good defense."
Marquess didn't mention hitting, but
he didn't have to. L.ike everyone else, he
knows the offense w ill probably take care

of itself this season. The reason Stanford
comes into this weekend series against
the Bulldogs so highly ranked is largely
because of its experienced hitters.

While the Cardinal's starting rotation
is completely new and its middle defense
is inexperienced, the Stanford lineup still
features a number of powerful bats.
Sophomore right fielder Joe Bor
ehard, junior first baseman John Gall,
who led the team with a .381 average last
season, senior third baseman Josh

Hochgesang and junior center fielder Ed
mund Muth, who batted .388 two years
ago, all have the potential to put runs on
the board.
While the offense can be counted on to
produce, the pitching and defense will be
the question marks for Marquess this
weekend and throughout the early sea
son
Sophomore pitcher Jason Young gets
the honor of starting tonight's game by
virtue of his play in fall workouts and
early season practices.
"Young has been phenomenal," Mar
quess said. "He was our most effective
pitcher in fall practice and has kept it up
so far."
Despite his effectiveness in practice,
questions still loom about Young, simply
in light of his inexperience in games.
Young pitched just under 23 innings last
season, all in relief, while notching a
weighty 6.35 ERA.
Sophomore pitcher Justin Wayne,
who manv thought would be the Cardi

rial's No. 1 starter, will pitch Saturday af
ternoon.
While Marquess said that Wayne and
Young have already asserted themselves
as the top two starters, their placement
this weekend is no indication as to who
will be No. 1 or No. 2.
"In a month, our Friday and Saturday
starters will be set, but not yet," he said.
The Cardinal staff is still not sure who
will start on the mound Sunday after
noon. Two lefthanders, sophomore Brad
Drew and freshman Mike Gosling, are
still battling for the spot.
Who starts Sunday will probably de
pend on who does not pitch in relief on ei
ther Friday or Saturday. Early in the sea
son, Marquess hopes to limit his starting
pitchers to approximately 75-80 pitches.
Then, he will bring in other starters, such
as Drew, Gosling and junior righthander
Geoff Linville, in short relief.
