■ Yesterday: Stanford 79. Arizona
64 (9-K. 4-4).

The Cardinal senior forward lit
up the court with her trevs, leading
Stanford (10-9. 6-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) to a 79-64 victory over the
Arizona Wildcats (9-8.4-4).

Stanford came into the game
lacking one of its biggest recent
contributors, sophomore forward
Sarah Dimson who is out with a
stress fracture in her right foot. The
loss was never an issue, however, as
Freuen stepped up her game, hit
ting five of six from behind the arc,
driving with an intensity often lack
ing in the Cardinal and ending the
game with a career-high 23 points.
"All of us had to contribute a bit
more and I was just able to get
open shots," explained Freuen. "I
hit them and after I hit a couple the
basket just got bigger. Tara's al
ways telling me to be more aggres
sive and that's what I'm trying to
do."
Freuen's intensity was unstop
pable in the second half. In one
two-minute sequence, she fol
lowed the cashing-in of her fourth

three-pointer in a row by driving
hard along the baseline, taking
three Wildcats with her to the bas
ket.
Even Freuen's one miss from
the arc seemed well planned, as it
was rebounded by Stanford sopho
more center Carolyn Moos, and
after allowing more time to expire,
Freuen took a pass and hit her last
three of the game.
"I thought Regan had a super
effort off the bench for us and what
I told her in the locker room was,
'that was a senior game,' " said
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer.
"She played like a senior. She was
rebounding, shot really well for us
and I thought that was really key."
Besides Freuen, three other
Cardinal women were in double
