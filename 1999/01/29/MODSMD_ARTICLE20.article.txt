WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Tomorrow : Stan ford (10-9 overall,
6-2 Pacific 10 Conference) vs. Ari
zona State (K-9, 2-6), 7 p.m., Maples
Pavilion. RADIO: KZStJ (90.1
I M). KBPA (1220 AM).
■ Yesterday: Stanford 79. Arizona
64 (9-K. 4-4).

The Cardinal senior forward lit
up the court with her trevs, leading
Stanford (10-9. 6-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) to a 79-64 victory over the
Arizona Wildcats (9-8.4-4).

Stanford came into the game
lacking one of its biggest recent
contributors, sophomore forward
Sarah Dimson who is out with a
stress fracture in her right foot. The
loss was never an issue, however, as
Freuen stepped up her game, hit
ting five of six from behind the arc,
driving with an intensity often lack
ing in the Cardinal and ending the
game with a career-high 23 points.
"All of us had to contribute a bit
more and I was just able to get
open shots," explained Freuen. "I
hit them and after I hit a couple the
basket just got bigger. Tara's al
ways telling me to be more aggres
sive and that's what I'm trying to
do."
Freuen's intensity was unstop
pable in the second half. In one
two-minute sequence, she fol
lowed the cashing-in of her fourth

three-pointer in a row by driving
hard along the baseline, taking
three Wildcats with her to the bas
ket.
Even Freuen's one miss from
the arc seemed well planned, as it
was rebounded by Stanford sopho
more center Carolyn Moos, and
after allowing more time to expire,
Freuen took a pass and hit her last
three of the game.
"I thought Regan had a super
effort off the bench for us and what
I told her in the locker room was,
'that was a senior game,' " said
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer.
"She played like a senior. She was
rebounding, shot really well for us
and I thought that was really key."
Besides Freuen, three other
Cardinal women were in double
figures in scoring. Led by freshman
guard Lindsey Yamasaki (18 pts.),
junior point guard Milena Flores
also had a phenomenal game, earn
ing her second double-double in
three games, with 17 points and 11
assists.
In the second half, Flores had a
coast-to-coast drive to build the
Cardinal lead to 13, and as she did
in Washington Flores opened the
floor with her down-the-court
passing, giving a number of Cardi
nal players easy access to the bas
ket. Flores finished the game by
making her last two free throws.
She was again perfect from the
charity strip, going five for live on
the night.
"I think the key to our success
was Milena, who did a great job of
penetrating off the dribble," Van-
Derveer said.
Moos had 10 rebounds to lead
Stanford in that category, and was
the fourth and final Cardinal to
score in double figures with 14.
Furthermore, Moos' defensive
rebounding was one of the key rea
sons Flores was able to get the ball
up the floor.
As a team, the Cardinal com
mitted 21 turnovers, with Ari

zona's full-court press often insti
gating the mistakes. In the first
three minutes of the second half
alone, the Cardinal had four
turnovers, two off bad passes and
two off of picks.
After this initial setback, the
Cardinal was able to keep the ball
enough to build a 16-point lead,
but poor ball-handling slowed
Stanford's runs throughout the
game.
While the Wildcats were able to
disrupt Stanford's scoring ma
chine, they were never as effective
as the Cardinal at taking away of
fensive opportunities
Only two Wildcats broke into
double figures, with junior forward
Angela Lackey leading Arizona
with 19 points. The only other
Wildcat to put out a solid offensive
effort was freshman forward Eliza
beth Pickney, who ended the game
with 11 points.
One of Arizona's troubles was it
hit just 38 percent from the field, a
far cry from the Cardinal's 50 per
cent from the field and 58.3 percent
from three-point range.
The hot-shooting Cardinal will
face Arizona State tomorrow at
7:30 p.m. The Cardinal owns a 26-7
advantage in the history of the ri
valry, with Stanford winning the
last 12 meetings by an average of 25
points.
