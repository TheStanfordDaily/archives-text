■ Tonight: No. 8 Stanford (2-1 over
all, 1-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration ) vs. No. 4 1 iawaii (4-2,2-1), 7
p.m.. Maples Pavilion.
■ Yesterday: Stanford defeated
Hawaii, 4-15,10-15,15-9,15-5,22-20.

Last night's game is going down in
the history hooks. The No. 8 Stanford
men's volleyball team (2-1 overall, 1-
1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) pulled off a five-game victory
over fourth-ranked volleyball power
house I iawaii in the final moments of
the fifth and final game.
" This game is one of the classics,"
said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. "A lot of great games have
been played in this gym (Burnham
Pavilion] and this is one of them."
Hawaii's men's volleyball team
must have been puzzled.

How could the team that the Rain
bows defeated so handily in games
one and two end up with a victory?
That's exactly what happened last
night when the Cardinal defeated the
Rainbows 4-15, 10-15, 15-9, 15-5, 22-
20.
The Cardinal had seven match
points in game five before capturing
the victory.
This game marks the second
MPSF match for the Cardinal, which
opened up conference play last week
against Brigham Young.
However, clearly a more refined
Stanford squad entered the court last
night. The one-week lapse between
games enabled the (Cardinal to devel
op several aspects of its game, above
all team dynamics, which contributed
to last night's win.
"What a difference a week
makes," Nieves said. "We started the
same way a week ago against BYU.
Only tonight, we were poised and or
ganized and siuck together."
Alter a slow start, all aspects of the
Cardinal's game came together in

game three against Hawaii. Stanford
junior outside hitter Andy Witt
recorded his I,oooth. career kill in the
game. Witt not only helped establish
the Cardinal momentum in the third
game, but played a crucial leadership
role throughout the match.

'A lot of great games have
been played in this gym,
and this is one of them.'

"Andy was awesome from start to
finish," Nieves said. "When things
weren't going well, Andy was playing
well. When things were going well,
Andy was playing even better."
The All-Ameriean proved espe
eially effective during some of the
most critical points in the match.
"Andy said all the right things to
his teammates," Nieves said. "You
won't find a more fiery competitor on
this campus or in college volleyball
than Andy."
Witt lead all players on the court in

attacking and recorded 38 kills. Ju
nior outside hitter Gabe Gardner
also contributed 31 kills to the Cardi
nal campaign.
Another key aspect of the Stan
ford victory was the play of Cardinal
sophomore setter Brad Griffith. Just
as Griffith's entry into the game
against BYU last week sparked a
Cardinal scoring run, last night Grif
fith was again a catalyst in Stanford's
improved performance.
Griffith entered the match with
the Cardinal trailing 5-10 in the sec
ond game. Although Stanford did not
win the second game, this was a criti
cal time to establish the Cardinafs
momentum
"We started out slow," said sopho
more middle blocker Dan Zhang. "In
the second game. Brad came into the
match. He helped turn the game
around. The crowd got on our side
and the game got really loud."
The Cardinal will look to emulate
tonight's refined play when Stanford
competes in a second game against
Hawaii at Maples Pavilion tonight.
