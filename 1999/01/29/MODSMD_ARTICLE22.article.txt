# Three duals in three days for Card
## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
The Cardinal came through
easily in its first dual-match of the
season against Illinois State last
weekend, dominating the Red
birds 8-1, hut this weekend the
Stanford women's tennis team
faces a much tougher challenge —
three dual matches in three days.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Today: No. 5 Stanford vs. Wash
ington State. 1:30 p.m., Taube Fam
ily Tennis Center.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Wahs
ington, noon, Taube Family Tennis
Center.

■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Oregon
State, noon, Taube Family Tennis
Center.

The Cardinal opens against
Washington State today, takes on
Washington on Saturday and com
petes with Oregon on Sunday.
All matches will take place at
the Taube Family Tennis Center.
Today's match will begin at 1:30
p.m., while the others will start at
noon.
"These are tough teams," said
head coach Frank Brennan. "All
of them will pose a big challenge. I
expect Washington to be especial
ly tough."
Stanford assistant coach Lele
Forood agreed.
"This weekend should be a lit
tle grislier than [last weekend
against Illinois State]," she said.
The Stanford women, however,
possess enough confidence to

meet the challenge.
"I'm glad we got [the first dual
match] out of the way," said fresh
man Gabby Lastra, whom Bren
nan considers the season's most
improved player.
Freshman Marissa Irvin, who
plays No. 1 for the Cardinal,
shared Lastra's sentiments.
"It's good to have gotten the
first-match jitters over with."
In fact, Irvin is planning to have
a strong debut season, and, consid
ering her already impressive re
sults, including a tournament vic
tory, her plans seem legitimate.
"I'm so excited to be playing for
this prestigious team," Irvin said.
"I'm really looking forward to the
NCAA's. Why settle for anything
less than the best?"
Irvin may not have to settle for
anything less. Her flat, deep
groundstrokes and powerful serve
have already made her a formida
ble force in women's collegiate
tennis. Irvin intends to make her
game even more aggressive before
the season is over.
"I want to always be moving
forward," Irvin said. "My serve is a
real important part of my game. I
want to either serve-and-volley or
come in after a few shots from the
baseline."
Irvin, of course, is only one of
four freshmen who should make
an impact this weekend and be
yond.
Lastra, Lauren Kalvaria and
Keiko Tokuda complete the tal
ented frosh quartet. While the
freshmen have only endured one
dual match, most onlookers feel
that they are adjusting quickly to

the atmosphere of collegiate ten
nis.
"All four freshmen are sweet,"
said senior Marisa Maclennnan.
"They're stepping right up right
away and are going for it all. It's
going to be a sweet year."
Maclennan, along with juniors
Teryn Ashley and Jennifer Heiser,
and sophomores Julia Sherbakov
and Sarah Pestieau, will help lead
the freshmen in their quest for
glory.
Because she has already played
several tournaments this season,
veteran star and All-American
Ashley had to sit out last week
end's dual-match, because there is
a restriction on how much players
can play during a season. She is
looking forward to showing off her
game in her return during this
weekend's competitions.
Brennan and Forood have two
primary goals for the team for this
weekend.
"We still only have a tentative
lineup," Forood said. "We want to
get a solid lineup."
In addition to determining
where all the talented freshmen fit
in among the veterans on the lad
der, the coaches hope to work on
the Cardinal's doubles prowess.
"Junior doubles is much differ
ent from collegiate doubles,"
Forood said.
Right now, Ashley / lrvin,
Kalvaria I Lastra and Tokuda /
Heiser constitute the Cardinal's
top three doubles teams. If these
teams have trouble in the dual
matches this weekend, Brennan
and Forood might consider a dif
ferent doubles dynamic.
