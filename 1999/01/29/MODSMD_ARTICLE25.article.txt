# UCLA, USC come up for big weekend at deGuerre
## 
### Chad Morse Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's swimming and
diving teams compete in their final two
home meets of the season this weekend. The
next time you get to see this talented group
of swimmers so up close and personal might
be ... in Sydney, at the Olympics.
With matchups against UCLA today and
USC tomorrow, the No. 2 Cardinal returns
to the friendlier waters of deGuerre pool
after two difficult road trips.
Now, on its home turf and with a squad
that is regaining its health and depth, Stan
ford hopes to knock off potential Pacific 10
Conference threat USC.
Stanford Head coach Richard Quick

knows that a victory against the No. 5 Tro
jans is not a foregone conclusion. Quick has
even pegged USC as possible NCAA con
tenders.
"No [one] team dominates this year,"
Quick said. "Georgia, Arizona, USC, SMU
and Stanford could all take it."
Not counted towards Pac-1() or NCAA
results. Quick likened the dual-meet season
as a "dress rehearsal" for these larger
venues. He remains unconcerned about the
fact that his team has lost two dual meets al
ready this season, more than all the Stanford
squads of the past decade combined.
Obviously, the health of the team has
played a major factor in the Cardinal's un
characteristically blemished dual-meet
record. Quick conceded that it was only a

matter of time before the demanding winter
practice and competition schedule got the
best of one of his squads.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING

■ Today: No. 2 Stanford (4-2 overall, 1-1 Pa
cific 10 Conference) vs. No. 17 UCLA (6-1-1
1-1-1), 1 p.m., deGuerre Pool.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. No. 5 USC (5-0. 2
0), 1 p.m., deGuerre Pool.

"For 11 years, we've been very lucky," he
said, hoping that the worst is over. "As a
team, we're getting healthier."
But will the team be healthy enough to
take on the Trojans? Earlier this season.
USC narrowlv defeated the same Arizona

squad that routed Stanford last weekend.
Quick pointed to USC standout Lindsay
Benko, who is a top candidate for the 2000
Olympic squad, as a major threat. Benko, a
freestyler who excels at all distances of the
event, recently displayed her freestyle ver
satility by taking both the 100- and 1000-
yard events at a dual meet against UC-Santa
Barbara.
Another swimmer to look for is Trojan
senior butterflyer Karen Campbell, whose
times have rivaled those of Stanford butter
fly champ Misty Hyman this season. Also.
Kristen MacGregor should present Stan
ford stars Elin Austevoll and Whitney
Leatherwood with quite a challenge in the
breastroke events. Austevoll and Leather
wood both did not travel with the squad last

weekend due to illness.
USC also brings a strong diving contin
gent to deGuerre.
"Diving is going to play a huge role [in
this meet]," Quick stated. But the Stanford
diving squad, which has dominated compe
tition up to this point, may be thrown its first
hurdle on tomorrow.
Not to be entirely overlooked, the No. 17
Bruins will bring a talented squad into
today's meet. UCLA, winless in 17 meetings
with the Cardinal, is led by junior phenome
non Keiko Price. Price has recorded some of
the nation's fastest times in the sprint
freestyle events and the 2(K)-yard individual
medley. Competition between Price and
Stanford sprinters Catherine Fox and Siob
han Cropper could be a meet highlight.
