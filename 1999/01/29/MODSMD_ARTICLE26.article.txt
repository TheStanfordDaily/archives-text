WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Tonight: No. 10 Stanford (2-1) vs
No. 15 Oregon State (1-2). 7:30 p.m.
Burnham Pavilion.

And while that advantage may
not be as pronounced in gymnastics
as it is in other sports, the Cardinal
knows all too well what a difference
it can make.
Two weeks ago against then No.
4 Utah, Stanford charged into
enemy territory confident that it
could upset the highly touted Utes
and left town frustrated and disap
pointed at both the outcome of the
meet (Utah won 196.050-192.570)
and what it perceived to be biased
scoring from the Utah judges.
And the 10,174 rowdy Utah fans
didn't help matters much either.
So now it is Stanford's turn to
enjoy the perks that go along with
being the home team. No more
hotel rooms, plane rides, or bus
trips for the Cardinal for it is but a
short walk to Burnham Pavilion
from most locations on campus.
And best of all. head coach
Mark Cook expects the Cardinal
faithful to turn out en masse for
tonight's home opener.
"We feel like there is a lot of stu
dent support this year." Cook said.
"It should be a fun show."
And the Cardinal should not dis
appoint.
This year's squad is among the

most talented in school history and
is riding the momentum from its
huge victory over California last
Friday night.
"Cal was a really big win for us in
that we competed really close to
our top level," said junior Larissa
Fontaine. "Last week was a really
solid performance."
But the Cardinal will have to do
without Fontaine's services
tonight. Fontaine broke her finger
during warm-ups before last week's
meet, and while she still competed,
it was decided that she should sit
out tonight. Although losing its
only Ail-American will definitely
hurt Stanford's chances against a
solid Oregon State team, the Cardi
nal should have the depth to stay
with and defeat the Beavers.
In last week's win over Cal, six
different Cardinal gymnasts posted
top-three finishes as Stanford led
the meet from wire to wire and
took home the event titles on all
four apparatus.
The Cardinal will look to sopho
more Jenny Wilson to step up and
fill part of the void left by Fontaine.
Besides Fontaine, Wilson has been
the Cardinal's top vaulter this year
and Stanford will need her to turn
in an effort rivaling last week's elec
trifying vault that earned second
place honors behind Fontaine.
Also shining for the Cardinal
this year has been Exaltacion who
will look to improve on her best
performance of the year against the
Golden Bears, one in which she
captured event championships on
both the balance beam (9.875) and
the uneven parallel bars (9.800).
She also finished second in the all
around competition (38.425) be
hind freshman teammate Katy
Herbert.
Senior co-captain Amy Muraka
mi returns to full strength tonight,
for Stanford, after battling the flu
and only competing in one event
last week against Cal.
Start time for tonight's match is
set for 7:30 p.m.
