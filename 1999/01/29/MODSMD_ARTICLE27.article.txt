MEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Tomorrow: Stanford hosts ( ali
fornia and UC-Santa Barbara in the
Cardinal Open, 7 p.m.. Burnham
Pavilion.

On Jan. 8, the last time these two
schools met, California defeated
Stanford 214.8-211.9. Stanford ju
nior Jason Katsampes finished sec
ond in the all-around at the meet,
with a point total of 53.8, in addi
tion to capturing the rings title.
In addition. Cardinal senior
Scott Finkelstein took the vault
title and freshman Adam Berken
bile finished third in the all-around.
But all in all, it was Cal's night.
Tomorrow night's Cardinal
Open gives Stanford an opportuni
ty to get revenge.
Stanford has not defeated No.
10 Cal in the two schools' last 15
meetings, so the Cardinal seeks to
avenge not only its earlier loss to
the Bears, but also to snap this
streak.
After the Golden Bear defeat of
the Cardinal. Stanford fell from its
preseason ranking of No. 8 to its
current ranking of No. 13.
The Bears extended their regu
lar-season winning streak to 48
meets with their previous defeat of
the Cardinal, and have not lost a
meet in nearly three years.
California, however, has been
hurt by multiple injuries, a factor
that should play a part in tomor
row's meet.

UC-Santa Barbara will also
compete in the meet, a team that
has also not competed since Jan. 8,
when the Gauchos scored 206.05
and placed fifth at the West Point
Open.
In addition to the three colle
giate teams attending tomorrow
night, local and national clubs have
been invited to participate.
"Since it is such a big meet, with
people not from the NCAA, it
gives us a good estimate not just of
where we stand collegiately, but
also for where we stand in USA
gymnastics," said sophomore
Jason Blitz.
Because it is an open, the Cardi
nal can allow extra competitors to
perform on each event, even nine
or 10 as opposed to the standard
six. However, only the top six
scores will count towards Stan
ford's total.
"It is a good opportunity for us
to see where everyone is," said
Stanford head coach Sadao Hama
da.

We ve put together a lot of
new stuff, so it should be
very interesting.'
— Sadao Hamada

This season. Stanford has
worked to improve difficulty in its
routines. In tomorrow's meet,
Hamada expects to see better per
formances.
"We have increased our difficul
ty. so now we're just trying to clean
up our routines and add consisten
cy," Hamada said.
Stanford's level of difficulty is an
impressive part of the team as a
whole and adds a level of excite
ment to Cardinal meets.
"It's tough." Blitz said. "We do
more difficult routines than many
of the other colleges and in time,
our routines will become more con
sistent. We've put together a lot of
new stuff, so it should be very inter
esting."
