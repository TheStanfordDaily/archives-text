Despite a growing number of ju
nior-level tenure track positions na
tionwide for those with doctorates in
the humanities and sciences, the Uni
versity's junior faculty hiring rates
have not increased.
A recent article in The Chronicle
for Higher Education attributed in
creases in tenure-track positions in
English, history and economics to an
increasing number of retirements
and a "healthy U.S. economy."
Stanford, however, has not expe
rienced marked changes, according
to Kathy Ciillam, senior associate
provost for faculty affairs.

"Various schools differ quite a lot.
The School of Medicine cut [several]
tenure-track positions, but has added
... positions in the clinical line,"
Ciillam said.
Over the past ten years, the over
all number of non-tenured faculty
has decreased from 311 to 261.
The ongoing economic boom and
associated tighter labor markets have
not affected the University signifi
cantly. said Vice Provost for Faculty
Relations Robert Weisberg, a law
professor.
"There is always intense competi
tion for the occasional superstar, but
I can't say I've observed any great
change in the general competition. I
would note that with our housing

costs and with the increasing issue of
dual-career couples, recruitment of
the people we want has become more
and more 'challenging,'" Weisberg
said.
"My observation is that in the
fields, there have been plenty of good
applicants," Gillam said.
Ever since the budget crisis of the
early 19905, the University has not
seen a dip in hiring.
"The budget crisis led some
schools to make fewer appointments,
but that has not been the case for
[many] years," Gillam said.
"As research universities go, Stan
ford is small, and it has little turnover.
