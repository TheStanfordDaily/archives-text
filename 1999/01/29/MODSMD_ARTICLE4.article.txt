# Greeks try for houses
## No guarantees in second year of new system 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Today marks the deadline for fra
ternities and sororities to apply for
University housing in the second year
of a new, formalized system designed
to reward strong Greek organiza
tions with housing.
But there are no guarantees that
the University will grant any requests
from the housing hopefuls.
"Every group has the ability to
apply but it's not a certainty that we
will award a house every year,"
warned Director of Student Activi
ties Nanci Howe.
"We want groups that get a house
to be successful," she said.
Fraternities and sororities cur
rently housed do not have to reapply
to keep their houses, although they
can be removed due to misconduct or
low membership.
"None of the groups [currently
with housing] is in serious jeopardy of
losing their house," said Howe, but
she added that "nothing is ever cer
tain."
Earlier this year Phi Delta Theta
was removed from its house follow
ing an alcohol-related accident that
left a member near death, violating
terms of the chapter's probation
stemming from an alcohol-related in
cident on their rush weekend trip last
spring. The Theta Xi fraternity lost its
house last spring due to an inability to

fill it with chapter members.
Currently seven fraternities and
two sororities are housed. Last year
six sororities and five fraternities ap
plied to receive housing.
That committee, consisting of ad
ministrators and students involved in
the Greek system, recommended
overturning the University's 1977
grandfather clause that left fraterni
ties unhoused at the time with little
hope of receiving housing.
This paved the way for sororities
to be eligible to apply for housing.
Last year Delta Delta Delta and
Kappa Alpha Theta were awarded
houses in Cowell Cluster. They were

the first sororities to be housed at
Stanford since sororities were
banned in the 1940'5. Sororities were
reinstated on an unhoused basis in
1977.
"Our application was a labor of
10ve.... We put tons of effort into it,"
said outgoing Tri-Delt President Sara
Petersen. She called the imbalance
between the number of housed fra
ternities and sororities "an outgrowth
of history." rather than any conscious
effort on the part of the University.
Greek leaders spoke highly of the
new application process.
