"The history of the family is an amazing phenomenon
in the history of the modern world," said Sergei Miro

it to say, is widely regarded among peasants as holy."
The exhibit is a collection of rare diaries, letters, pho
tographs and artifacts of Imperial Russia. It draws on the
holdings of the Hoover Archives, the State Archives of
the Russian Federation, the Museum of Russian Culture
and the private collections of Prince Andrew Romanov,
Prince Nikita Romanov, Andre Ruzhnikov and John
Traina.
Hoover Director John Raisian made the opening re
marks, first introducing special guest Prince Andrew Ro
manov, the grandson of Tsar Nicholas IPs sister.
"Prince Andrew was instrumental in working out the
plans for the internment ceremonies for the last Tsar and
his family in St. Petersburg last July," Raisian said.
Raisian then introduced Mironenko, the primary
speaker. Mironenko is an expert on the Soviet Gulag, the
forced labor system of the Soviet Union. Hoover is cur
rently working on a joint project with the State Archives
of the Russian Federation to microfilm and publish the

Sergei Mironenko, Russian Federation state
archivist, speaks yesterday at the opening of "A
Romanoff Album," an exhibit at Hoover.
Mironenko "is also well known
for his work on the Romanov family
and has taken special interest in pub
lishing the records of their lives,"
Raisian said.
In addition. Mironenko edited a
book based on excerpts from the
collection he oversees, titled
"Nicholas and Alexandra, Their
Own Story."
He talked about how the Ro
manov family is unusually well doc
umented, in part because every
member of the family kept a diary
and wrote numerous letters. He then

went on to describe the reluctant na
ture of Tsar Nicholas 11 and his influ
ential wife Alexandra. From there
he summarized their family and lives
until their eventual murder.
"1 would like to return you to the
documents," said Mironenko. who
spoke in Russian with translation by
History Prof. Terence Emmons.
"We made these selections with the
Hoover Institution, and if we can
convey to you through these docu
ments our understanding of the
events, then we will have been suc
cessful."
A Romanoff Album is in the Her
bert Hoover Memorial Exhibit
Pavilion and is open from Jan. 29 to
July 23.
