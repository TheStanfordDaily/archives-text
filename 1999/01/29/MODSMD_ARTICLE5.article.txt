The Hoover Institution held a reception yesterday af
ternoon to celebrate the opening of its new exhibit on
Russia's last imperial family, titled A Romanoff Album.
"The history of the family is an amazing phenomenon
in the history of the modern world," said Sergei Miro
nenko, director of the State Archives of the Russian Fed
eration, as he introduced the exhibit. "The family, suffice
it to say, is widely regarded among peasants as holy."
The exhibit is a collection of rare diaries, letters, pho
tographs and artifacts of Imperial Russia. It draws on the
holdings of the Hoover Archives, the State Archives of
the Russian Federation, the Museum of Russian Culture
and the private collections of Prince Andrew Romanov,
Prince Nikita Romanov, Andre Ruzhnikov and John
Traina.
Hoover Director John Raisian made the opening re
marks, first introducing special guest Prince Andrew Ro
manov, the grandson of Tsar Nicholas IPs sister.
"Prince Andrew was instrumental in working out the
plans for the internment ceremonies for the last Tsar and
his family in St. Petersburg last July," Raisian said.
Raisian then introduced Mironenko, the primary
speaker. Mironenko is an expert on the Soviet Gulag, the
forced labor system of the Soviet Union. Hoover is cur
rently working on a joint project with the State Archives
of the Russian Federation to microfilm and publish the
records of the Soviet Gulag.
