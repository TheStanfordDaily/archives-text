As a new Stanford organization, Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition already has plans to unify students from
around the country to organize support for various labor
issues.
The group, which was granted official status by the
University about two weeks ago, was created by members
of Stanford's Coalition for Labor, Dignity and Justice in
October.
"There was a real vacuum of student activism dealing
with the labor movement," said junior Eli Naduris-Weiss
man. the group's president. "It's a very important move
ment of social justice that needs to reach a broader audi
ence."

The group acts to "serve as an intermediary between
the students on the Stanford campus and the staff" in re
gards to labor issues, according to its mission statement. It
also works to "gather and disseminate information for
workers facing labor problems on campus" and hopes to
"participate in labor movements in the Bay Area, the
United States and across the world."
The new coalition, composed of both undergraduate
and graduate students, is currently working on planning
the " 1999 Labor C onference" that will be held at Stanford
from April lhto IK.
The group's leaders hope to host participants from
UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz, UCLA, UC-San Francis
co and other area schtx)ls at the conference. It will be de
voted to "bringing together labor leaders, workers, ac
tivists and students with the common purpose of strength

ening ties within the labor movement as well as forging ties
with outside groups," according to its vision statement.
One of the conference's goals is for schools to share in
formation about their labor groups with one another
through discussion groups. The coalition has invited vari
ous speakers to discuss labor issues such as worker safety,
environmental justice, farm worker solidarity, sweatshop
activism and labor activist recruitment.
The group is also working with similar labor groups at
schools such as Harvard. Yale and Brown, to form a na
tionwide on-campus labor organization to coordinate
labor campaigns. The group is tentatively called the Stu
dent Labor Solidarity Network.
"There was an effort to create a nationwide network in
the Northeast, but it was mostly over e-mail," said trea
surer Ethan Kaplan, a doctoral student in statistics. "We

are hoping to extend this network to the country and make
it much more active."
Aside from the conference, the group is working on
other projects such as supporting three upcoming Stan
ford Hospital union movements, working on a Bon Ap
petit labor contract negotiation, and investigating viola
tions of labor rights of non-unionized groups on campus.
The organization has only held three meetings so far,
but its membership is steadily rising.
"We made a valiant outreach effort and e-mailed a lot
and now it's paying off and doing it by itself," Kaplan said.
"It's amazing the amount of people who are getting in
volved now. People from campuses like Wesleyan,
Amherst and U-Mass all picked up on it in the last week."
The group hopes to get funding from the ASSU and
various departments at Stanford and outside organiza-
tions such as the AFL-CIO for the
labor conference and other general
projects. It does not, however, charge
group fees.
Because it is an official student

group, members must be Stanford
students, but "we encourage anyone
from the Stanford community includ
ing faculty and staff and even people
not directly related to campus to
come to meetings and give advice,"
Kaplan said.
"We're a group committed to de
mocratic participation."
