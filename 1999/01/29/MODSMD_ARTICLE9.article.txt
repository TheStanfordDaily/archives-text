# Prof examines Japanese business

### Nisha Prabhu 
Since the 1980s, the world has
looked to Japan as a model of eco
nomic success. The United States
and other countries have intensely
scrutinized and studied it in the
hopes of discovering its business se
crets. In this context, the results of a
recent study by a Stanford professor
of the profitability of Japanese for
eign operations are all the more sur
prising.
"Although most businessmen
and journalists believe that Japanese
overseas subsidiaries are managed
well, there is little empirical evidence
to support this," wrote Graduate
School of Business Marketing Prof.

David Montgomery and Assoc. Prof.
Takehiko Isobe of the University of
Marketing and Distribution Sciences
in Kobe, Japan.
In fact, Montgomery and Isobe's
study comes to the startling conclu
sion that the number of Japanese na
tionals employed by a subsidiary and
that subsidiary's profits are inversely
related. In short, the greater the
number of Japanese employees, the
less the profits.
Japanese business culture dic
tates that parent companies should
have tight links with their overseas
offspring. Yet, according to study,
overpopulating a subsidiary with na
tionals from the parent company's
home base can seriously limit the

ability for autonomous decision
making and innovation that is crucial
for a flexible — and thus successful
— business operation.
Many of Japan's overseas sub
sidiaries also employ Japanese top
managers unfamiliar with the local
environment. In these instances,
"host-country nationals are likely to
have a more comprehensive under
standing of the local sociocultural,
political, and economic environ
ments," notes the study.
Montgomery and Isobe analyzed
data collected from 1,148 sub
sidiaries across Asia, Western Eu
rope and North America in three in
dustries — mechanical engineering,
electronics and electrical equipment.

and transportation.
Among the factors identified as
having an effect on subsidiary per
formance are characteristics of the
parent company, subsidiary objec
tives and subsidiary location.
"Location has a statistically sig
nificant impact on profitability; in
dustry does not," Montgomery said
of the conclusions of his study. "The
major impact of profitability is where
[the subsidiaries] are operating."
Montgomery has long been inter
ested in Japanese business culture. In
the 1980's he founded the first course
on Japanese marketing in the United
States, and he and Isobe plan to pub
lish a study on Japanese joint ven
tures in China.
