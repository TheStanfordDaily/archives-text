The Dilemma
In spite of traditional values, our
culture romanticizes spontaneous
sex, and the media plays it up big
time. Women are supposed to be
emotionally "swept away"; men
are presumably "overwhelmed"
by powerful hormones. And
premeditated sex is considered
neither natural nor exciting.
We all want sex to be physically
satisfying and emotionally
fulfilling, to protect our vulner
abilities, and to keep ourselves
healthy. This requires some fore
thought, which lands us smack in
a conflict: How can we simul
taneously be "swept away" and
make important sexual decisions
ahead of time? It is, for example,
tough to:
■ Both "lose control" and know
what you do and don't want
■ Have protected sex if you
don't plan ahead
■ Let the "mood" (or the bottled
version - alcohol) run the
show, and have no regrets
Ready or Not
Do you want to have sex? With
whom? 1 low far do you want to
go? To decide freely, take an
honest look at your feelings and
social conditioning. Typical
socialization has many men and
women thinking:
■ "1 should have had sex by
"Sex will get me love" (in
fact, sex and love are not the
same)
Sex role stereotypes haven't
changed a whole lot since this
picture of Stanford students was
taken over a century ago.
■ "Sex is the ultimate way to
express my love" (not
necessarily)
Men Often Think:
■ "Sex proves my masculinity;
it makes me feel like a man"
■ "My pleasure is my only
concern" (true only when
you're alone; otherwise your
partner's pleasure, needs, and
safety - STDs, unplanned
pregnancy - concern you both)
■ "I want sex but I don't want to
get involved" (that's sex with
a body, not with a person; is
there fear of intimacy?)
Women Often Think:
■ "1 laving sex proves my love"
(especially when taught to
"save yourself")
■ "Sex will help me keep my
partner"
■ "I just want to please my
partner" (sex is just as much
for a woman's pleasure)
■ "What I want is affection, and
to be held" (some learn after
ward that intercourse wasn't
what they really wanted)
All or Nothing?
No. Sexual pleasure is available
on a broad spectrum, from simple
physical touch to deep erotic
intensity. Some options:
■ If you don't want to be
sexually active, but you want
to enjoy pleasurable erotic
experience, try hugging,
kissing, massage
■ If you want more intense
sexual pleasure but not
penetrative sex, try manual
or oral stimulation, erotic
massage, or fondling
Being "sexually active" usually
means penetrative intercourse
(vaginal, anal, sometimes oral).
Men often have deep pleasure
with orgasm. So do some women,
but others need direct clitoral
stimulation for orgasm (inter
course alone doesn't do it for
them).
Communication
Sex should always be with
mutual consent. Think through
and respect your own sexual
boundaries, and clearly commu
nicate them. Also let your partner
know your feelings, desires, and
fears. Honest intimate conver
sation may feel uncomfortable at
first, because it's rarely modeled.
But the more you communicate,
the more natural it will become.
Talking about sex decreases the
risk of regretted or unprotected
sex, builds emotional strength,
and leads to greater intimacy and
pleasure. It is possible to think
about it, plan for it, talk about it,
and enjoy it thoroughly. Q
