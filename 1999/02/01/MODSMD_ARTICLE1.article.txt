## Hospital may benefit 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
Christopher Dawes, chief operating offi
cer of the Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital, had 36 hours' notice to get to
Washington last Thursday. The trip was well
worth the rush.
Dawes arrived for a meeting run by the
first lady, where the Clinton administration
announced a proposed increase in federal
funding for children's teachings hospitals in
the year 2000 fiscal budget.
Sen. Ted Kennedy. D-Mass., Secretary of
Health and Human Services Donna Shalala
and representatives from 30children's hospi
tals nationwide attended the meeting. It ad
dressed currently inadequate federal fund
ing for the training of pediatricians at chil
dren's hospitals, proposing a budget increase
of $40 million that will affect 50 children's
hospitals nationwide.
Dawes thanked the Clinton administra
tion in a press release. "It's gratifying to
know that the administration agrees that
teaching programs at children's hospitals are
critical to future pediatricians and the future
health of all children," he said.
The government helps pay for the educa
tion of doctors by providing funding to hos
pitals based on the number of their admitted
Medicare patients. This creates a problem
for children's hospitals, which treat few
Medicare patients.
According to the National Association of

Children's Hospitals, whereas adult hospi
tals receive on average $76,000 per doctor
for training from the government, children's
hospitals receive approximately $400. Al
though children's hospitals comprise only
one percent of all national hospitals, they
train almost 30 percent of all pediatricians.
For more than two years, the National As
sociation of Children's Hospitals has been
lobbying the administration to address this
inequity of federal support.
Shirley Seager, director of government
relations at the Lucile Salter Packard Hospi
tal, said the hospital currently loses money
on the training of its pediatricians. The hos
pital finances training through contributions,
charity and other means, and believes train
ing in a children's hospital gives pediatricians
the widest range of experience and exposure.
"We are committed to it. It's the right thing
to do," Seager said.
Peters Willson, vice president for public
policy at the National Association of Chil
dren's Hospitals, commended the first lady
for her involvement.
"The first lady had been a trustee of the
Arkansas Children's Hospital. It takes some
one with her experience to understand the
problem." Seager said.
Funding for children's hospitals is only
one aspect of a much larger congressional
debate over graduate medical education.
The Clinton administration stressed in the
Thursday meeting that the proposal is only a
small, first step in a complicated issue.
