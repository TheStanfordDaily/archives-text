## Broncos win another Super Bowl 
### 
MIAMI (AF) - What a perfect
way for John Elway to say goodbye.
The man who spent his first 14
NFL seasons without a Super Bowl
ring got his second straight yester
day, weaving his magic for what
could be the final time and gaining
revenge on former coach and adver
sary Dan Reeves and his upstart
Atlanta Falcons.
The final score was 34-19 over an
Atlanta team that was its own worst
enemy as the 38-year-old Elway,
who was the unanimous choice for
MVF, completed 18 of 29 passes for
336 yards and one touchdown and
ran 3 yards for another score. The
total yardage was third best in Super

Bowl history.
Elway refused to say whether he
would retire or come back for a
chance to win a third straight Super
Bowl.
"I'm going to take some time,
relish this year," he said. "You got
to love those challenges. We got the
team; we got the nucleus here to do
it. It definitely throws a kink into my
thinking."
In addition to the Falcons, who
did everything they could to self
destruct on offense. Elway's accom
plices were:
• Darrien Gordon, who inter
cepted two passes that set up two
scores and set a Super Bowl record

with 108 yards in interception
returns.
• Fullback Howard Griffith, who
had two 1-yard I'D runs.
• Terrell Davis, the league MVF,
who carried 25 times for 102 yards
for his seventh consecutive postsea
son 1 (K)-yard game, breaking an
NFL record set by John Riggins.
• Wide receiver Rod Smith, who
caught five passes for 152 yards and
an 80-yard touchdown.
Despite the absence of tight end
Shannon Sharpe, who injured a
knee in the first quarter, Smith and
the other Denver receivers consis
tently burned Eugene Robinson,
the Atlanta safety.
