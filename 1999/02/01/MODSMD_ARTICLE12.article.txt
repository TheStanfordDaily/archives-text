# Few votes for Clinton removal
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) - Repub
lican senators said yesterday that
some of their colleagues may vote
against removing Fresident Clinton
from office. House prosecutors,
meanwhile, prepared to question
Monica Lewinsky in an effort to
strengthen their case.
As Lewinsky waited at the
Mayflower Hotel for her deposition
today, cracks appeared in the unified
Republican front on the perjury and
obstruction charges against Clinton.
Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.
declined to estimate how many
might vote to acquit, but he indicat
ed that getting even 50 votes for
conviction in a chamber controlled

by 55 Republican senators is in
doubt.
"You would get much closer to
getting a majority in the obstruction
(charge) than on the perjury
charge" as the case now stands, he
said.
House prosecutors have shifted
their focus to the obstruction charge
on the assumption that even among
Republicans who believe that Clin
ton lied under oath, there is ques
tionable support for the notion that
the untruths were serious enough to
warrant the president's removal,
according to a knowledgeable offi
cial who demanded anonymity.
Asked on NBC's "Meet the

Press" how many Republicans
would vote to convict ( linton on the
perjury charge. Sen. Richard Shel
by. R-Ala. replied: "Not as many as
a lot of people believe."
"I haven't polled anybody, but I
hear a lot of people say that is the
weakest" of the two charges. He
added that the charge would draw
"perhaps" fewer than 50 votes for
conviction.
"A number of senators who
believe that the president lied under
oath but that his wrongdoing in that
area does not constitute perjury
because of the legal definition of
perjury," said Sen. Susan Collins, R-
Maine.
