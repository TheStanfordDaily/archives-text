## Editorial Flood of change 
### 
New editor in chief
has high expectations
for Daily's future

THE PHONE RAN(i at 9 a.m.
on my first day us a news editor.
The voice on the line told me to
put on my coat and get down to the
office. The campus had flooded, it said,
buildings were damaged and classes
were canceled. We had a great story on
our hands.
I spent 14 hours in the office that
day, helping to coordinate a massive
reporting campaign that yielded live
stories and dominated the front page.
And I loved it.
As I walked home around midnight,
the rain had stopped and I had official
ly signed my life away to Ilie Daily.
The paper has worked that way for
as long as anyone here can remember.
Come work for The Daily, start out
slowly at first, then one morning wake
up to a managing editors call and find
out that you're hooked for life. Forget
about academics or a social life for a
while. Live The Daily.
It would be a good system at a uni
versity full of journalism majors who
come to college to prepare themselves
for media careers. Stanford isn't like
that. Look around the office of our
newspaper and you can count the
future "real world" reporters on two
hands. Prospective Times writers are
surrounded by history majors, would
be lawyers and students headed to
medical school.
Too many of those students, faced
with The Daily's demands, burn out
and leave the paper before their time
at Stanford is through. When they go,
they take with them years of knowl
edge that could have been passed on to
other, less-experienced staffers.
Typically, the editor in chief is one of
the lifers, a person willing to sacrifice
everything for the paper. I'm noexcep

(ion. But I know that most of the Daily
staff doesn't have the time or the ener
gy to do the same, and I think it's time
for the paper to recognize that.
Volume 215 begins today, and with
it a new Daily staff structure that
spreads out the work of producing a
paper among more people. Instead of
two news editors, we now have five.
The same is true for sports. The goal is
simple: no one, outside of the editor in
chief and the managing editor, will
have had to sign their life away.
For readers, this will mean a better
paper, though you probably won't
notice it at first. Reducing burnout will
slowly, but surely, build a solid base of
experienced staffers who will in turn
help to train new staffers. Ihe cycle will
repeat and the educational process will
improve. Over time. The Daily will
become a better reported, better writ
ten newspaper.
Not all change this volume will be
gradual. Our front page will soon look
different, thanks to the work of a new
head productionist who was hired to
improve the paper's layout. I"he opin
ions section is expanding its editorial
focus to include national issues of
prominence. News will have more
investigative reports, more analysis
pieces and better features.
Even the role of the editor in chief
will change. I plan to improve commu
nication between student groups, the
University and The Daily. We want to
cover you better and that means more
dialogue. As editor of your campus
publication, I am at your service, and I
encourage you to call (725-21(H)) or e
mail me (eic@daiIy.stanford.edu) any
time.
The most important part of The
Daily, though, will stay the same. We
will still put out a paper because we
love it and strive to serve you in the
best way possible.
Welcome to Volume 215.
