Abolish SLE
Now that the Structured Liberal Educa
tion program is on the table, I would like to
propose a third alternative to keeping SLE
as is or implementing the contemplated
modifications: end the program. Dismantle
it entirely. Parcel the SLE students among
the other first-year programs, where their
admirable yearning for hard work and intel
lectual growth might rub off on their peers,
who are all too often only interested in
doing the bare minimum to get by academ
ically. An infusion of bright-eyed, curious
and intellectually passionate students into
other first-year courses might just be
enough to electrify the entire atmosphere of
those courses, with additional positive con

sequences for the later years of education at
Stanford. So, don't mend it - end it!

Supportj not laser pointers
I am writing after reading a letter last Fri
day from a Cal fan, Avin Bansal, defended
Stanford's "Sixth Man Club"and its behav
ior at Maples Pavilion during our men's bas
ketball games. The message was clear â€” the
fans should do everything in their power to
help their team win. This is apparently the
definition of a "true fan." As a Stanford ath
letics fan, I completely disagree. This attitude
is one that was apparently shared by an Ari
zona fan who shone a laser pointer into Jar

ron Collins' eye so that he would miss a free
throw. ... Was this fan "simply doing his
job?"
Obviously, I am not suggesting that
Bansal would condone the above behavior,
but the taunting and verbal attacks on
opposing players (and coaches) by the Sixth
Man Club are not that dissimilar. The goal
is apparently not to support or promote
one's own team, but to denigrate and deval
ue the other. I have been supporting Stan
ford's athletic teams since I first came here,
and I can assure you that it is possible to
provide support, encouragement and an
effective home court advantage without
taunting or disrespecting the opposing
team. Fans of Stanford's women's basket
ball team have treated opposing teams with

dignity and respect which would, by
Bansal's argument, mean that there could
be no home court advantage at Maples. Far
from the truth since Maples is considered
one of the most difficult venues for visiting
teams.
I do not suggest that fans should sit qui
etly in the stands and watch passively during
a game. On the contrary, get out and sup
port all of our athletic squads with as much
fervor as you can muster. If you don't lose
your voice, you're not screaming loudly
enough! However, the important thing is
that one should support our team and not
demean the opposition.
