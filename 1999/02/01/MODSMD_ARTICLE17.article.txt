# Campus Viewpoint: Chris Henderson
## A 						day in the life of the Tree 
### 
JUST A FEW days
ago. I was approached
bv one of The Daily's
editors and was asked to
write a guest column for
the Opinions page. Being
extraordinarily jealous of
the tremendous fame, for-

tune and hatred others seem to reap from
the student body by participating in such an
endeavor. I could not possibly resist.
But clearly. I do not possess the great tal
ent for writing, creating humor and repeat
ing myself that so many other columnists 1
have read over the years do. What was poor
little old me to do?
Where do I begin? 1 suppose a good
place to start would be selecting a topic
about which to write. Obviously, The
Daily's editors did not select me because
they had spoken to my CIV instructor, who
was at one time under the impression that I
was at least a competent writer.
Nor had they spoken to my freshman
writing instructor, who was under the far
more likely impression that I was a blubber
ing idiot. No, I was fooling myself if I
thought that.
1 was picked because 10.14159 months
ago, I covered myself in Crisco and wrestled
a pig; I had myself ceremonially covered in
svrup and baking soda and submerged
myself in vinegar; and hundreds (if not
thousands) of students have seen me naked
(not to mention the really weird stuff 1 have
done).
Because of all this. 1 now get free drinks

at bars, countless television appearances
and thousands upon thousands of truly gen
uine and sincere friends and worshippers.
Oh, and I get to dance around in a giant tree
costume at various sporting events.
Oh yeah, and I am blessed with the dis
tinct opportunity to write this column.
So I guess that I am obligated to write
some self-indulging article that shows you
what a zany and wacky guy I am.
But 1 am above all that; I am tired of
being objectified. I am tired of being noth
ing more on this campus than a sex symbol.
1 want people to appreciate me for my
mind, although I do intend to continue sell
ing my calendar, "Spandex and Me: Pic
tures of a Tree." in the Stanford Book
store.
But. alas, I feel a certain obligation to
you. my audience. As interested as I am
sure you would be in hearing my thoughts
on why the decline in the moral integrity of
our society can be directly related to the
bastardization and prostitution of the news
media that is inherent in any capitalist soci
ety, I think you'd rather just hear about a
typical day in my life.
Good then, now let's not waste any time
in getting started. 1 only have a very limited
space, you know.
To understand the life which is my own
and derive from it any moral utility, you
must consider what state all humans are
naturally in. That is, a state of perfect free
dom to order their actions and dispose of
their possessions and persons as they see fit,
within the bounds of the law of nature, with

out asking leave or depending upon the will
of any other person.
As I am wakened in this state, I begin my
liquid diet with a three martini breakfast.
After consuming each olive in rapid succes
sion. 1 go and work out. After a long and
arduous session of thighmastering I go to
my first class, "Nudity in Film in the 19905."
Sometimes 1 skip that class though, as I find
it too mundane for my hedonistic tastes.
Following that. I go back home and par
ticipate in the ritual bacon flogging of a
housemate of mine. Then I have lunch: 13
eggs, one gallon of milk and four table
spoons of wheat germ.
My afternoon activities tend to vary.
You know, typical Stanford stuff. One day
1 might find myself testifying in front of
Congress, the next, buried knee-deep in
iceberg lettuce. Nothing too interesting,
really.
Now it's time for dinner. Usually I roust
up some Muenster cheese, two or three
black squirrels, about a quarter pound of
Olestra and 400 milliliters of ground nut
meg. I leave those by the front door to ward
off any unwanted tourists, then go upstairs
to eat whatever our chef is cooking.
Then, you know, there are parties and
stuff, the occasional butter fight and there
you are â€” a dav in the life of, well, me.

Chris Henderson 111 is gradeless, majorless,
and has no name. He is also a pathological
liar and dreams of being a simple sex symbol
the rest of his life.
