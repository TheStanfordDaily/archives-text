### Will Flemming Staff writer 
For the first hull' of Saturday's
game against Arizona St;ite, the
Stanford men's basketball team was
in real danger of dropping its second
straight Pacific 10 Conference
game. Mike Batiste, the Sun Devils'
center, was nailing threes. Eddie
House, the team's star shooting
guard, was lighting it up from all
over the floor.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
â–  Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (18-3, 8-
I Pacific 10Conference) 73. Arizona
State (12-9,4-5) 63.

And there was nothing the C ordi
nal could ilo to stop either one. I he
duo combined for 31 of ASU's 37
first-half points and propelled the
Sun Devils to a six-point halftime
lead.
I ike the veteran team that it is,
however, Stanford responded with
poise and clutch plav in the second
half and salvaged a split on the Ari
zona road trip with an encouraging
73-63 victory in front of 9,030 at
Wells I'argo Arena in l empe.
After being down by as many as
11 in the liist half, the ( ardinal put
together a l(>-0 run ovei the span of
eight anil a hall minutes to end the
Sun I)evils" upset bid.
And while the Cardinal simply
wore Arizona State down in the
Imal minutes, it wasn't exactly like
all the Stanfoid players were fresh
and sprinting oil the com t at game's
end.
"I was tired as hell the whole
game." said senior point guard
Art Inn Lee. "We have old legs. We
do need some rest. I ; vcry practice is
long every single practice. I don't
think anyone in the country prac

tiees as long and hard as we do."
That exhaustion showed early as
Stanford appeared slow on defense
and was unable to contain House or
Batiste.
And that concerned Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery.
"It seems like the other team is
the aggressor," Montgomery said.
"It seems like we're a little tentative.
I don't know if we're just waiting to
feel out our opponent. To me, after
a loss, you come and say you have to
go get it. We have to go get people.
We ran the risk again of a guy like
[Arizona guard Jason] Terry go off
on us again."
That said. Stanford did find the
grit to outhustle the Sun Devils
down the stretch, highlighted by a
series of massive offensive rebounds
by none other than the Mad Dog,
Mark Madsen.
Those rebounds set up several
key plays, including a three-point
play by sophomore forward Jarron
Collins that was the main turning
point in the second half.
"Madsen came out like a man
possessed in the second half," Mont
gomery added.
In fact, the whole Stanford team
looked completely different right off
the bat in the second period, knock
ing down a pair of three-pointers
and erasing the Sun Devils' six-point
lead within the first 63 seconds.
From that point, the Cardinal
was simply solid on both ends of the
floor, at one point causing four
straight turnovers as part of the 16-0
run on the Arizona State team that
appeared to run out of gas in crunch
time.
"The structure of their motion
offense can really run a player
down." said Stanford forward Peter
Sauer, who had another huge night,
posting 13 points and 10 rebounds.
" That happened to Western Michi
gan in the NCAA tournament. It's
easy to be running through those
screens in the first few minutes. In
the end, [ ASI I) didn't have the ener
