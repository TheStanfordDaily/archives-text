# Synners take time to build consensus
## 
### Michael R. Fainelli 
When a resident of Synergy proposeCTTr
visit to the Exploratorium at a recent house
meeting, other residents snapped their fingers
in approval. The atmosphere in the lounge
was cheerful and harmonious. But when more
contentious proposals were discussed last fall,
some residents grew frustrated with Synergy's
unusual system of house government.
In place of the majority rule employed hy
most dorms at Stanford, residents of Synergy
and Columbae legislate house policy hy con
sensus. Often associated with the Quakers,
government by consensus requires every resi
dent to agree to a decision before it can be

adopted.
"Facilitators" moderate debate on an issue
"find try to maintain an open, constructive at
mosphere. Ideally, the system guarantees
every participant at least nominal satisfaction
by furnishing individuals and minorities with
a power they don't have under majority rule.
In the end. all must consent because a single
individual has the power to block a proposal
and force a compromise.
For example, several weeks ago a majority
of the self-named Synners wished to hike up
their board bill in order to augment the stock
of food.

House meetings
at Synergy are
often contentious,
but everyone
agrees in the end.
"If it had gone to a vote most
people would have said sure, tack
on another $50 so we can have more
cheese," said resident Peter Kinne,
a junior. But under the consensus
system, a minority of residents was
able to thwart the increase.
In government by consensus de
bates can drag on for hours, and
some residents have grown weary of
the process after a series of
marathon house meetings at the be
ginning of the year.
One such meeting involved the
meat policy. Each fall the residents
of Synergy, which serves only vege
tarian food, must agree upon a set of
rules for the consumption of meat in
the house. Synergy attracts many

students who deplore the consump
tion of animal products like milk,
eggs or even honey, hut about half
the residents are omnivorous.
The Synners consented to re
strict meat to private rooms and to
a cubicle for storage in the base
ment. Another clause in the policy
states that "there will be sets of din
ing ware set aside specifically for
meat use," and only designated
sinks and sponges can be used to
clean them.
But the meeting lasted about five
hours and senior Barbie Wong, the
resident assistant, said that among
some Synners "there was definitely
frustration."
She said that with big issues like
meat policy, the consensus process
is bound to take a long time. But she
attributes some of the dismay en
countered this year to "poor facili

tating.'
Another lengthy debate that
tested the patience of some resi
dents centered around whether
Synergy stall members should have
to do the same share of housework
as non-staff residents, in addition to
the duties of their positions.
Lasting several hours, discussion
took place over three meetings, and
numerous proposals were put forth
for consideration. One individual
threatened to block six of the seven
proposals, drawing out the time it
took to reach consensus.
Consensus is used to decide all is
sues affecting Synergy including
room assignments, a quarterly en
deavor in which residents work out
who lives in which room. In some
years the process has taken up to
eleven hours.
Despite the considerable length

of house meetings and frustration
encountered this year, many Syn
ners remain in favor of consensus.
According to residents, a sense of
community and belonging not
found in other houses at Stanford
makes consensus possible. Resident
Robert Baesman, a senior, said even
though the process can be difficult
at times, consensus does render
benefits.
"Sometimes the tension you get
from a deeply ideological debate is a
positive thing," he said. Consensus
at Synergy "gives people an oppor
tunity to express themselves in an
environment of respect."
House manager Tiare Cross, a
senior, said every system of govern
ment has disadvantages, but she be
lieves consensus is right for Synergy.
"I support the consensus process as
the best of all possible evils."
