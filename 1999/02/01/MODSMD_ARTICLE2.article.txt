# Synners take time to build consensus
## 
### Michael R. Fainelli 
When a resident of Synergy proposeCTTr
visit to the Exploratorium at a recent house
meeting, other residents snapped their fingers
in approval. The atmosphere in the lounge
was cheerful and harmonious. But when more
contentious proposals were discussed last fall,
some residents grew frustrated with Synergy's
unusual system of house government.
In place of the majority rule employed hy
most dorms at Stanford, residents of Synergy
and Columbae legislate house policy hy con
sensus. Often associated with the Quakers,
government by consensus requires every resi
dent to agree to a decision before it can be

adopted.
"Facilitators" moderate debate on an issue
"find try to maintain an open, constructive at
mosphere. Ideally, the system guarantees
every participant at least nominal satisfaction
by furnishing individuals and minorities with
a power they don't have under majority rule.
In the end. all must consent because a single
individual has the power to block a proposal
and force a compromise.
For example, several weeks ago a majority
of the self-named Synners wished to hike up
their board bill in order to augment the stock
of food.
