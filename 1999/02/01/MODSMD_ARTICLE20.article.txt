## 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
On Saturday night, the Stan
ford women almost got caught
overlooking the Arizona State
Sun Devils, hut solid play by ju
nior point guard Milena Flores
and freshman forward Enjoli
I/.idor helped spur the Cardinal to
a 73-58 victory.
The win was Stanford's fourth
in a row and fifth in its last six
games
In that stretch, Flores has
begun to take control of the team,
leading with a confidence that
hadn't always been evident.
Against the Sun Devils, Flores
not only put up solid numbers
with 16 points, five assists and
seven steals, but she was able to
put together plays that either got
her outside shooters open or
found her inside talent behind the
defense for an easy layup.

"I think, again, thank good
ness for Milena, she came out and
did a great job of running our
team, running our transition, hit
ting big shots and playing great
defense," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer.
The Cardinal (11-9,7-2 Pacific
10 Conference) came out with al
most no intensity, going 0 for 6
from the field in the first four and
a half minutes. Flores turned the
ball over twice, and the Cardinal
seemed unable to find the crisp
ness on offense it had shown in its
win over Arizona last Thursday.
With six minutes gone and her
team down by four, Flores finally
came alive, stripping sophomore
guard Natalie Tucker and going
coast to coast for a layup. Flores
ended the game with seven steals,
including two more full court
runs.

came in lor struggling freshman for
ward Bethany Donaphin, and she
immediately made her presence
known. At the 12-minute mark,
l/.idor drove to the hoop, making the
basket while being hammered by
Sun Devil sophomore guard Ebony
Edwards, l/.idor gave the Cardinal
its first lead. 10-9. when she dropped
the shot in from the free throw line,
and although Stanford continued to
make mistakes, it never relin
quished the lead.
" "1 think it was just one of those
typical 'playing to the level' of the
team we were playing against," Flo

res said of the first half. "I think it's
just a matter of being totally mental
ly prepared and mentally tough."
This mental toughness began to
show in the second half, which start
ed a bit rocky. Donaphin continued
to struggle, turning the ball over
once on a bad pass and then travel
ing on the next trip down the court.
After coming in for Donaphin,
Izidor continued her strong play,
making a four-foot jumper and
crashing both the offensive and de
fensive boards.
l/.idor wasn't the only freshman
hurting the Sun Devils (8-10. 2-7
Pac-10). Center Cori Enghusen
took over the baseline on the defen
sive end, blocking six shots. At one
point in the second half, Enghusen

blocked two shots in a row, and with
Flores either taking it in herself or
dishing it to others, the Cardinal
was able to bring the lead to 14
points.
While lzidor continued to re
bound and play with an intensity
that seemed to spur many of her
teammates, sophomore center Car
olyn Moos finally showed off her in
side talent. Off a pass by lzidor.
Moos faked right and then hooked
the ball over her defender, making
one of the best shots of the game.
Unfortunately she was unable to
showcase more of her talent as she
quickly picked up her fourth foul.
The Cardinal continued to play
well in spurts throughout the game,
never quite hammering the Sun

Devils as in the past.
With the injury to sophomore
forward Sarah Dimson, Van-
Derveer asked lzidor to increase her
level of intensity. And she clearly
did. lzidor gave the Cardinal a dou
ble-double with 12 points and 13 re
bounds.
"More than anything she under
stands the game of basketball. She
gives people match up problems be
cause she can pull them outside and
take them off the dribble, and at the
same time she can post a smaller
player up if they try and match up
with her," VanDerveer said.
"I can't say as we've had a for
ward with the versatility of [lzidor],
well, for the exception of Kristin
Folkl."
