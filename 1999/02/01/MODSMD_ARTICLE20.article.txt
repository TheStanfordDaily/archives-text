### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
On Saturday night, the Stan
ford women almost got caught
overlooking the Arizona State
Sun Devils, hut solid play by ju
nior point guard Milena Flores
and freshman forward Enjoli
I/.idor helped spur the Cardinal to
a 73-58 victory.
The win was Stanford's fourth
in a row and fifth in its last six
games
In that stretch, Flores has
begun to take control of the team,
leading with a confidence that
hadn't always been evident.
Against the Sun Devils, Flores
not only put up solid numbers
with 16 points, five assists and
seven steals, but she was able to
put together plays that either got
her outside shooters open or
found her inside talent behind the
defense for an easy layup.

"I think, again, thank good
ness for Milena, she came out and
did a great job of running our
team, running our transition, hit
ting big shots and playing great
defense," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer.
The Cardinal (11-9,7-2 Pacific
10 Conference) came out with al
most no intensity, going 0 for 6
from the field in the first four and
a half minutes. Flores turned the
ball over twice, and the Cardinal
seemed unable to find the crisp
ness on offense it had shown in its
win over Arizona last Thursday.
With six minutes gone and her
team down by four, Flores finally
came alive, stripping sophomore
guard Natalie Tucker and going
coast to coast for a layup. Flores
ended the game with seven steals,
including two more full court
runs.
