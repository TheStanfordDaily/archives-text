### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
Jusi three weeks into regular season play, you can
already see llie similarities in the Stanford men's vol
leyball team's matches.
Only lour games into the IWB-W regular season,
the come-froin behind victory has already become one
of the staples ol the eighth-ranked Cardinal (2-2 over
all, 1-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation).

Stanford did it against Loyola. It did it again against
Hawaii. To the nearly 1 ,()00 fans gathered in Maples
Pavilion Friday night, it looked like the Card was going
to do it one more time.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Friday: No. 4 Hawaii (5-2, 3-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
def. No. 8 Stanford (2-2,1-2) 15-8.15-11.14-16,11-15,16-
14.

However, in the final point of the fifth game, a mis
communication between Stanford players ended any
chance of Stanford pulling off its third victory of the
season after dropping the first two games.
The fourth-ranked Hawaii Rainbows (5-2,3-1) pre
vailed over Stanford 15-8, 15-11, 14-16,11-15, 16-14 in
an endurance test which lasted a little less than three
hours. The two teams had played the previous night in
another five-game marathon in which the Cardinal
emerged victorious.
"It's always difficult to play the second match in a
row," said Stanford junior outside hitter Gabe Gard
ner. "Mentally, it was not difficult. We were prepared
to face them again. But, physically it can be rough."
Although Stanford held several leads throughout
the fifth and deciding game, a Cardinal service error
enabled Hawaii to take a 15-14 lead. The Rainbows
clinched the win after two hours and 54 minutes of play
when a miscommunication between Stanford junior
outside hitter Josh Palacios and Gardner prevented ei
ther player from keeping the ball in play.
Throughout MPSF competition this season, anoth
er staple of the Stanford season has been a sluggish
start. Friday night's game was no exception. Early in
the first game, the Cardinal found itself down 10-0.
The depth of talent on the Stanford line-up has en
abled the Cardinal to make some key substitutions to
escape its early troubles. Although player replace
ments enabled the Cardinal to remain competitive
against Hawaii, it was not enough.
"A lot of different substitutions helped us out,"
Gardner said. "Everyone was just looking for a lift
early in the match."
One player who provided such a lift was senior cap
tion Jeremy Bart. The middle blocker repeatedly en
tered the match at some of the most intense moments
of the night.
