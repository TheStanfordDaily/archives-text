# Stanford drops two of three
## 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Stanford's lineup is littered with
talented, experienced hitters. But
when the Cardinal most needed a hit
in its season-opening series versus
Fresno State (2-1). few could
muster up any offense as Stanford
lost the series two games to one.
In the three games combined,
Stanford (1-2) left 21 men on base.
Right fielder Joe Borchard alone
left five men in scoring position dur
ing Saturday afternoon's 8-6 loss.
"We had it in our hands and we
just didn't come through with the
big hit." said senior third baseman
Josh Hochgesang.

BASEBALL
■ Yesterday: Fresno State (2-1) 5,
Stanford (1-2) 3.
■ Saturday: Fresno State 8, Stanford
6.
■ Friday: Stanford 1, Fresno State 0.

Hochgesang was one of a few
Cardinal batters to put runs on the
board. He hit the game-winning solo
home run in Stanford's 1-0 victory
Friday night and drove in the Cardi
nal's only runs in Sunday's 5-3 loss
with a three run homer.
Other than Hochgesang, who
drove in five of Stanford's 10 runs,
there was little offensive production
from the Cardinal.
First baseman John Gall, Stan
ford's leading career hitter, was only
2 for 11 and got thrown out at home
in the seventh inning yesterday. Ju
nior Craig Thompson, the Cardi
nal's leadoff man. hit the ball hard,
but was still only 2 for 11 with two
runs scored.
Driving batters in "should be one

of the strengths of our team," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We have a lot of veteran
players. We need to perform bet
ter."
The Cardinal's early offensive
deficiency is obviously not due to a
lack of talent, as Stanford features
three Ail-Americans: Gall, Hochge
sang and junior Edmund Muth.
However, the team seemed to lack
some focus and intensity.
"Every team has its own charac
ter and, right now, we need to pick it
up in the intensity category,"
Hochgesang said. "On offense, if we
get a tough break, the next guy up
has to get that two-out base-hit with
a guy on second or with the bases
loaded."
While the Stanford offense was

unproductive, sloppy defense and
occasionally wild pitching were also
concerns for the Cardinal.
Yesterday, starter Brad Drew
went only 2 2/3 innings, giving up
three hits. However, Drew also
walked three batters, hit one, threw
a run-scoring wild pitch and fell vic
tim to a misplayed ball in center
field. The play led to a two-run triple
for Bulldog second baseman Jeff
Prieto.
"Brad didn't have real good com
mand of his stuff," Marquess said.
"In fairness, [the four runs he gave
up| were earned, but we should've
caught that ball in center field and
the ball in the dirt probably was a
wild pitch, but we should've blocked

that ball. too.
"But. give them credit. They
took advantage of [the mistakes]
and they shut us down."
The defensive problems were
not limited to yesterday's game,
though.
Saturday, freshman right-hander
Brian Sager walked in the eventual
tying run and threw a wild pitch that
allowed the eventual winning run to
cross the plate. Then, after fresh
man left-hander Dan Rich came on,
catcher Damien Alvarado let a third
strike roll to the backstop, allowing
another run to score.
The best thing to come out of the
series for the Cardinal was the
strong work of a few young pitchers:
right-hander Jason Young and
freshman left-hander Mike Gosling.
Young looked especially good.
In six commanding innings, he al
lowed only one infield single while
striking out seven.
"Tonight I had the ability to
throw strikes," Young said. "I
walked the leadoff man three times,
but I came back and threw strikes. I
felt a lot less pressure than 1 thought
I would (pitching in the opener.]"
Ciosling came on in relief in the
seventh and promptly struck out
four batters in his first two innings.
Gosling got himself in trouble in the
ninth, giving up a single, a walk and
a hit batter in succession to load the
bases.
However. Marquess put his trust
in the young pitcher and left him in
to finish the game. With the crowd
behind him. Gosling quickly got two
strikes on pinch-hitter Dan Duke
and then struck him out on a break
ing ball outside.
Sophomore right-hander Justin
Wavnc was originally thought to be
Stanford's opening-day starter.
However, Marquess said he pushed
Wayne back to Saturday night be
cause he had been sick for the first
few weeks in January and missed a
few workouts.
Wayne, though, did not seem to
profit from the extra day of rest.
Throughout his 6 2/3 innings, he was
inconsistent and, at times, Fresno
State seemed to be sitting on his
fastball.
During the first inning, Wayne
gave up three hits and a run. He then
seemed to find a rhythm, retiring the
next 12 batters in a row. However,
the Bulldogs eventually caught on
to him.
In the top of the fifth, with two
outs and two strikes on Fresno
State's ninth batter, Jason Fanconi,
Wayne gave up a double. Seemingly
thrown off. Wayne got behind in the
count to the next two batters and
gave up two straight run-scoring sin
gles to let the Bulldogs back into the
game.
In the seventh, Wayne again
struggled. After the first out. he al
lowed five of the next six batters sin
i>les, giving the Bulldogs a 5-4 lead.
