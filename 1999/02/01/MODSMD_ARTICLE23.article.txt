# Cardinal gets two weekend wins
## 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
The No. 1 ranked Stanford (2-0)
tennis team came away with two
impressive wins this weekend
against Washington (1-1) and Ore
gon (0-2).
The Cardinal used the momen
tum it had built from a hard fought
4-3 win against Washington on Sat
urday to crush Oregon 7-0 on Sun
day.
The Saturday Washington
match proved to be every bit as dif
ficult as the team expected it to be.
The Huskies are a tough indoor
team, especially at home, and they
were able to give the Cardinal quite
a scare.
The Cardinal lost the doubles
point for the second consecutive
match and lost at both its first- and
second-singles spots before its
younger players stepped up and
came through in the pressure.
The Cardinal got wins out of its
three through six singles spots to
get the four points it needed for the
victory.
"I think the key on Saturday was

the younger guys' play," said senior
Ryan Wolters. "That was great, be
cause they were the ones who were
unable to play against SMIJ [which
was canceled last Tuesday], On
Saturday, they didn't get down
after we lost a few matches, they
just used it to pump up."

Assistant coach Tom Whitlinger
agreed. "Saturday was a tough
match that could have gone either
way," he said. "To get the help we
did out of our younger players was
encouraging. We have the kind of
team where every match a different
player may need to step up."
Against Washington it was
sophomore Ali Ansari. Playing in
the No. 5 singles spot against Wash
ington's Jeremy Burman, Ansari
lost the first set 6-4 before rallying
to win the next two 7-5, 6-3. At this
time in the match the team score

was 2-2 and Ansari gave the Cardi
nal its first lead.
Ansari also had to deal with the
Husky-supporting crowd.
"I just tried to stay focused and
keep my head in it." Ansari said. "It
was a big mental win for me that
may give me confidence down the
road."
The Cardinal also used victories
from sophomore Alex Kim, fresh
man K.J. Hippensteel, and sopho
more Scotty Scott to close Wash
ington out. Scott and Ansari were a
perfect four for four over the week
end with two doubles and two sin
gles wins. Kim and Hippensteel
were successful in both their singles
matches.
Against Oregon on Sunday the
Cardinal showed why it is the top
ranked team in the nation. It
played with extreme confidence,
got out to a quick start and never let
the Ducks have an opportunity to
get back in the match.
"Oregon may have been a little
down from a close loss to [Califor
nia] on Saturday," Whitlinger said.
"But that is not lo take anything
away from our guys. On Sunday we

played Stanford tennis and never
gave them any opportunity."
The team quickly won the dou
bles point and then wasted no time
in winning six straight singles'
matches.
This may have been the kind of
match the team needed after two
brutally tough ones. Both the SMU
and the Washington matches were
draining, and it must have been
nice to get an easy victory.
"Our Sunday match went
smoothly. We used what we
learned from our first two and put
everything together," said Hippen
steel. "Against Oregon, we were all
at the top of our games."
Both Wolters and Hippensteel
will hope to stay sharp as they leave
on Tuesday for the National Indi
vidual Indoors Tournament in Dal
las.
The tournament starts Thursday
and both players will be in the sin
gles draw and play together in the
doubles. Hippensteel will go be
cause of his win over Wolters at the
St. Mary's qualifying in December.
Wolters qualifies with a wild card
bid.
