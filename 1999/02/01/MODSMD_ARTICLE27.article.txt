With victories over No. 17 UCLA
(6-2-1, 1-2-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
and No. 5 USC (5-2,2-2 Pac-10) this
weekend, the second-ranked Stan
ford (5-2, 2-1 Pac-10) women swim
ming and diving class of '99 put the
finishing touches on a perfect home
record over the past four years.

WOMEN'S SWIM
■ Saturday: No. 2 Stanford (6-2,3-1
Pacific 10 Conference) 166.5, USC
(5-2.2-2) 133.5.
■ Friday: Stanford 166.5, No. 17
UCLA (6-2-1. 1-2-1) 112.

In their years on the Stanford
squad, senior swimmers Suzanne
Toledo, Lmily Smith, (hantal Rawn,
Alison Fealey and Elin Austevoll
have amassed 24 All-America hon
ors. Divers Carissa Zenorini, Kari
Kokka and Tricia Tempo have gath
ered three such honors, and both
swimmers and divers have been part
of two NCAA champion teams.
The Cardinal cruised past UCLA
180-112 on Friday then duked it out
with USC on Saturday, eventually
coining out on top 166.5-133.5. The
two victories extended Stanford's at
home win streak to 39 ewer a 12 year
period.
The weekend sweep came on the
heels of two difficult road trips in the
month of January. Beating the tal
ented Trojan squ;id was an impor
tant confidence boost, according to
freshman Sylvia Bereknyei.
"We're definitely pleased with
the results," Bereknyei commented)
"This gives us a base. It proved we
can do what we're here to do. which

is swim fast."
The victory against USC also
proved that the Cardinal can com
pete with one of the top teams in the
country, even though the health of
the team remains a bit shaky. Just
one week ago, many Stanford swim
mers were so ill they could not travel
with the team to face Pac-10 rival
Arizona.
"We knew USC would be in
tense," said Stanford sophomore
Misty Hyman. "but we met the chal
lenge, and the whole team was
there."
Zenorini relished the competition
of competing against one of the na
tion's top diving contingents.
The Trojans are led by standout
Dorte Under. Linder, the top diver
in Germany, narrowly edged out
Zenorini in the one-meter compe
tition. But Zenorini put on a show
to snatch the three-meter competi
tion away from Linder later in the
meet.
Both Zenorini and Linder record
ed point totals that qualified them for
the NCA A championships in March.
The USC meet started off pre
cariously for the Cardinal. After
being upset in the first event of the
day.the 400-yard medley relay,
Stanford surrendered the 1650-yard
freestyle to USC's Amy Migawa.
The Cardinal turned the tide in the
200 freestyle when both Gabrielle
Rose and Bereknyei came from be
hind to touch out USC's Paige Fran
cis in one of the weekend's most ex
citing races.
One event later. Stanford ap
peared to take control of the meet
with a blazing victory in the 100-yard
backstroke by junior Catherine Fox.
Fox. however, was disqualified for
remaining underwater too long after

pushing off the wall. The disqualifi
cation gave USC a commanding lead
four events into the meet.
The 100 backstroke proved to be
a wakeup call for the Cardinal, and
from that point on Stanford domi
nated both in the water and on the
boards. Hyman. Rose. Shelly Ripple,
Austevoll and Jessica Foschi all won
individual events in what amounted
to a total team victory.
"This was our best meet in terms
of consistency," Smith said. "This
definitely gives us momentum for the

rest of the season."
Several Cardinal swimmers
turned in stellar individual perfor
mances over the weekend as well.
Austevoll won her final event at
deGuerre in fine fashion. Behind
for nearly the entire race,
Austevoll willed herself ahead of
USC's Kristin MacGregor with
only yards to go in the 200-yard
breaststroke. Austevoll, who is re
covering from the flu, recorded one
of her fastest times of the season in
the race.

During Friday's meet against
UCLA. Misty Hyman came up with
two remarkable performances. In a
high-powered matchup in the 100-
yard freestyle, Hyman touched out
UCLA sprinting star Keiko Price.
Then, in the 200-yard butterfly,
Hyman improved her time by nearly
two seconds with an incredible time
of 1:56.84.
The Cardinal travel to Austin
next weekend to match up against
two swimming superpowers, Texas
and Southern Methodist University.
