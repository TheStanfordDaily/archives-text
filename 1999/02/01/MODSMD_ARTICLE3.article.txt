## 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
Today kicks off Black Libera
tion Month and many perfor
mances. lectures and exhibits have
been arranged on campus to draw
Stanford students into this celebra
tion of black culture and history.
Kwame Yao Anku. Class of '94,
will give a multimedia presentation
titled "Malcolm. Martin & the
Twenty-first Century Black Con
sciousness."
"It seems now that this is the

first time in the history of black
people in this country where you
don't have any political or social
movement that the black people
are part of," Anku said. "Maybe if
we looked to some of the leaders in
the past who were visionaries,
maybe they can give us some in
sights as to where we should go.
Historically Malcolm X and Mar
tin Luther King Jr. have been pre
sented as polar opposites. In actu
ality thev had a lot in common and
were both intertwined in the strug
gle."
The performance event will take
place in Kresge Auditorium at 7
p.m. tomorrow.
In honor of Black Liberation
Month, the African and Afro-
American Studies Department is
also sponsoring several lectures
with a common theme: the history
and landscape of South Carolina
and Georgia. The first lecture.
"Forging New Identities: Africans,
Europeans, and American Indians
in Early South Carolina," will be
given by Patricia Nichols, an Eng
lish professor at San Jose State
University. It will take place Friday
at noon in Room 1638.
Although academic depart

ments and the Black Community
Services Center are sponsoring
several events, "Black Liberation
Month is largely student-run,"
noted Assoc. Dean of Students
Morris Graves, former director of
the Black Community Services
Center. "BCSC staff work with stu
dents to coordinate activities, make
sure they don't conflict with one
another [and] get funding," he said.
Willie Duncan, a sophomore in
tern at Harmony House, helped to
organize an exhibit of senior studio
art major Deidre Blake's paintings
and sculpture. "My main role was
finding the student talent and com
municating with her," Duncan said.
The reception for the African-
American artist will be held at Har
mony House through Feb. 12.
Voices of Color, a student per
formance group, will be perform
ing plays authored by writers of

color on Feb. 15 at Harmony
House. The Committee on Black
Performing Arts is sponsoring both
events.
In addition, the African-Ameri
can Greek community has orga
nized several social gatherings.
Although there are many activi
ties planned for February, Marini
Lee, co-student chair of the Black
Liberation Month planning com
mittee. expressed frustration about
its reception by the Stanford com
munity.
"In light of the whole Dan
Geyser / Kwanzaa debate, I think
this campus has issues with multi
culturalism in general. Honestly. I
don't think that many people be
sides minority students would have
that much to say if there were no
BLM, and frankly that frightens
me," she said.
Dailv columnist Dan Geyser

drew mixed responses with his col
umn questioning the necessity of
the African-American spiritual
holiday.
Lee also felt that the administra
tion was not as financially support
ive as it should be.
"I am thankful to the depart
ments that give money every year,
but it really bothers me that we
have to hustle for money. Black
History Month is nationally recog
nized. and I think it should be offi
cially recognized and budgeted for
by the University." she said.
Anku observed that this apathy
was a national phenomenon.
"What I found is that Stanford is
not unique, in that this is a dynamic
presence in other universities and
high schools. It's not so much an
issue of narrow-mindedness or
racism per sc. Perhaps we need a
different vehicle. Multiculturalism

is a nice word, but it doesn't mean
very much," he said.
"1 don't feel it's my job to make
sure that non-Black students feel
comfortable at BLM events. It's my
job to make people think about
how this country has systematically
gone about destroying the African-
American community and yet how
we have made significant triumphs
despite that fact." Lee explained.
Anku advocated a different
method. "I found that my goal is to
actually make people comfortable.
All of us are engaged, inspired,
moved when we are comfortable.
You are much more inclined to
share things about yourself, to take
someone's advice, to laugh when
you are relaxed," he said.
"This whole event is designed as
a catalyst for dialogue, a spark for
conversation," Anku said of his
performance.
