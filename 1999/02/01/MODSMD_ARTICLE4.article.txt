# Apathy grows among frosh
## Survey also finds increasing nat'l trend toward social conservatism 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
Freshmen entering college this
fall are increasingly apathetic on a
number of social issues, according to
a new survey.
Stanford freshmen were among
the 275,811 students from 469 of the
nation's two- and four-year colleges
and universities that participated in
the American Freshman survey. The

report, released this week by the
Higher Education Research Institute
at UCLA's Graduate School of Edu
cation, has been conducted since
1965.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said,
"What's important to note is that this
is a national profile, and the Stanford
profile is significantly different from
the national, historically."

Freshmen nationwide are feeling
disengaged from academies, accord
ing to the survey. Students are more
inclined to feel hored in class, to ar
rive late and to oversleep and miss
class. Nationally, a record high 37.3
percent of students feel frequently
"bored in class," while 36.6 percent of
Stanford freshmen do.
In addition, nationally, more stu
dents think going to college is impor
tant in order "to make more money"
(74.6 percent) and "to get a better
job" (76.9 percent) than to "gain a
general education and appreciation
of ideas" (62.0 percent).
However, at Stanford, 87.2 per

cent of freshman chose gaining a gen
eral education as a very important
reason in deciding to attend college,
and 65.7 percent of students cite get
ting a job to be a very important fac
tor.
Freshman Misty Espinoza agreed
that getting a better job was an im
portant consideration. "It's pro
grammed into our heads that you
can't get a good job or make a lot of
money unless you go to college," she
said.
Freshmen nationwide are becom
ing more likely to report little interest
in politics, label themselves "middle
of the road" and adopt conservative
stances on some social issues. Nation
ally, 50.9 percent of freshmen are in
favor of abortion rights and 39.6 per
cent believe casual sex is OK.

Ileana Carpen, co-chair of Stan
ford Republicans, said she believes
this may be "a backlash on what they
see as the liberal willingess to let
[politicians] get away with things."
For Stanford freshmen, 43.6 per
cent are still inclined to say they are
liberal and 75.1 percent support abor
tion rights.
, However, 41.1 percent of Stanford
students agree "if two people really
like each other, it's all right for them
to have sex even if they've known
each other a very short time."
The survey reports record lows in
political interest and legal careers.
Only 25.9 percent of freshman be
lieve that "keeping up to date with
political affairs" is a important goal in
life, and a record low of only 3 percent
of students plan to become lawyers.

More Stanford freshmen are in
terested in politics than the national
average. Fifty-four percent think it is
important to keep up to date, and 6
percent aspire to be lawyers.
Krista Glaser, board member of
the Stanford Democrats, attributes
political apathy to a "lack of true
leaders," she said. "In the '60s, my
parents had truly inspiring people
like Martin Luther King and Robert
Kennedy, and today, I look around
and there are some, but none that can
mobolize a huge massive population.
Another national trend is a de
crease in volunteer interest from high
school to college. Stanford freshmen
show a decline in volunteerism; 93.3
percent volunteered in high school
and 54.4 plan to keep participating at
the University.
