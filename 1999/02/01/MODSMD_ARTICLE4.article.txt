# Apathy grows among frosh
## Survey also finds increasing nat'l trend toward social conservatism 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
Freshmen entering college this
fall are increasingly apathetic on a
number of social issues, according to
a new survey.
Stanford freshmen were among
the 275,811 students from 469 of the
nation's two- and four-year colleges
and universities that participated in
the American Freshman survey. The

report, released this week by the
Higher Education Research Institute
at UCLA's Graduate School of Edu
cation, has been conducted since
1965.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said,
"What's important to note is that this
is a national profile, and the Stanford
profile is significantly different from
the national, historically."
