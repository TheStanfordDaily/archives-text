Writer-filmmaker Julie Dash spoke about
her award-winning lilm "Daughters of the
Dust" and her history in filmmaking as part
of the African and Afro-American Studies
lecture series Friday.
In "Daughters of the Dust," the Pea/ants,
a family of African-American women, is
preparing in 1902 to leave their island home
in the South Carolina Sea. traveling away
from what Linguistics Prof. John R. Rickford
called the "richest depository of living
African culture anywhere in the U.S." This
move north to the mainland threatens the
loss of their African identity and cultural her
itage.

Centered around a family picnic — what
Dash calls a ritual "last supper" — the film
draws heavily on African mythology, pagan
and Christian religious imagery and the oral
tradition of the griots. West-African story
tellers.
Emeritus Anthropology Prof. James
Lowell Gibbs Jr. praised the film for its "au
thenticity" iind the "way in which it straddles
several different [African] cultures and
shows how they blend and become one."
Dash criticized the ways that Hollywood
portrays Voodoo as "Something that's going
to kill your mama and come after you in the
dark." In "Daughter's of the Dust," a
Voodoo religious ceremony protects the
women from forces conspiring to defeat

them.
Dash said she has made it her mission to
make meaningful films that explore
"African-American women at pivotal mo
ments in their lives," particularly the
"women of the African Diaspora." Dash ex
pressed her confidence in the explosive fu
ture of independent films, while noting her
dissatisfaction with Hollywood producers
who, she said, are more concerned with a
film's marketability than its message.
"Hollywood is not interested in this kind
of work," said Dash. "They want you to . ..
follow their idea of who African-American
women are ... sassy and bitchy."
