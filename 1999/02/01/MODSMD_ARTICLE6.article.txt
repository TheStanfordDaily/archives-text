# Filmmaker delivers lecture

Writer-filmmaker Julie Dash spoke about
her award-winning lilm "Daughters of the
Dust" and her history in filmmaking as part
of the African and Afro-American Studies
lecture series Friday.
In "Daughters of the Dust," the Pea/ants,
a family of African-American women, is
preparing in 1902 to leave their island home
in the South Carolina Sea. traveling away
from what Linguistics Prof. John R. Rickford
called the "richest depository of living
African culture anywhere in the U.S." This
move north to the mainland threatens the
loss of their African identity and cultural her
itage.

Centered around a family picnic — what
Dash calls a ritual "last supper" — the film
draws heavily on African mythology, pagan
and Christian religious imagery and the oral
tradition of the griots. West-African story
tellers.
Emeritus Anthropology Prof. James
Lowell Gibbs Jr. praised the film for its "au
thenticity" iind the "way in which it straddles
several different [African] cultures and
shows how they blend and become one."
Dash criticized the ways that Hollywood
portrays Voodoo as "Something that's going
to kill your mama and come after you in the
dark." In "Daughter's of the Dust," a
Voodoo religious ceremony protects the
women from forces conspiring to defeat

them.
Dash said she has made it her mission to
make meaningful films that explore
"African-American women at pivotal mo
ments in their lives," particularly the
"women of the African Diaspora." Dash ex
pressed her confidence in the explosive fu
ture of independent films, while noting her
dissatisfaction with Hollywood producers
who, she said, are more concerned with a
film's marketability than its message.
"Hollywood is not interested in this kind
of work," said Dash. "They want you to . ..
follow their idea of who African-American
women are ... sassy and bitchy."
Stanford student and aspiring
filmmaker Mona Ibrahim echoed
Dash's frustration with the "cultural
ly specific" way that African-Ameri
can films are often presented, as
though "our stories are not univer
sal." She appreciates the fact that
Dash's films are "not about the
money, but about the images of our
people."
Dash began writing "Daughters of
the Dust" in the late 19705. After tak
ing 15 years to find funding, the film
became the first nationally distrib
uted, full-length feature by an
African-American woman and won
numerous awards, including first
prize in cinematography for dramatic
film at the 1991 Sundance Film Festi
val.
Born and raised in New York City.
Dash said she can't remember a time
when she didn't love foreign films.
She related a memory of her mother
waking her up one night to see "Black
Orpheus," when she was in junior
high school. She called the film a
"turning point," one that she finally

recogni/.ed when she "stumbled"
onto filmmaking in 1969 at a Studio
Museum of Harlem film workshop.
A psychology major at City Col
lege of New York, Dash earned a
B.A. in film production at the
Leonard Davis Center for the Per
forming Arts in the David Picker Film
Institute. Before graduating, she
wrote and produced her first film in
1974, a New York Urban Coalition
promotional documentary, "Working
Model s of Success." She later adapted
and directed "Diary of an African
Nun," a short film, which won a Di
rector's Guild Award for a Student
Film in 1978.
Dash has lectured at more than 30
colleges and universities across the
United States and has won more than
25 awards and honors since she began
a career in filmmaking in 1973. Her
other films include the short films "Il
lusions" and "Four Women."
Dash ended the lecture by treating
the audience to a sneak preview of
her new film. "Funny Valentines,"
starring Alfre Woodard ("Miss Evers
Boys"), Loretta Divine ("Waiting to
Exhale") and CCH Pounder ("ER"),
which premieres on television Feb.
14.
