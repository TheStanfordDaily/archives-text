## Chain's founding family has logging industry connection 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
On a recent after
noon at the Gap in the
Stanford Shopping Cen
ter. shoppers browsing for
zip-front hooded
sweatshirts and low rise
khakis got a bit more than
they had bargained for.
Seven members of
Stanford's Redwood Ac
tion Team, a recently
formed environmental

group on campus, distributed leaflets to shop
pers outside the Gap on Saturday. The leaflets
advocated a boycott of the popular clothing
store chain, citing the unsafe logging practices of
an allegedly Gap-affiliated forest products firm
in Mendocino County.
"We're hoping, first of all, to raise awareness
that there is irresponsible logging in many parts
of California," said freshman Nina Robertson, a
member of Redwood Action Team.
In 1% 1 > the Fisher family founded Gap Inc.,
which now owns the Gap, Banana Republic and
Old Navy. The Fishers also manage an invest
ment firm that recently established the Mendo
cino Redwood Company. Although managers at

the Gap in Palo Alto had no comment on this
issue, their company literature emphasized that
the Gap has no direct affiliation with this logging
enterprise.
Mendocino Redwood Company is run by
John Fisher, who is a son of the Gap founders but
not an employee of Gap Inc.
"Ihe ultimate outcome of this whole cam
paign is that there will be pressure put on the
Gap," continued Robertson, "so that the Fisher
family will influence Mendocino Redwood
Company to stop some of their harmful land
management practices."
