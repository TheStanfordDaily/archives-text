you can be posting
misleading photos in no time. But of
course posting photos is only one of the
reasons to start a MyFamily Web site.
Your site lets you and those you choose,
e'mail family members, chat in a secure
room on any topic, customize family event
calendars and photo albums, shop for gifts,
post news and announcements and find
links to other family-friendly Web sites. And
setting up a site is a breeze, anyone with a
computer, even a Web novice, can do it in
a couple of minutes. Which means you're
just moments away from showing your
parents your "new friends!' So get your family
on MyFamily.com, and stay connected.
