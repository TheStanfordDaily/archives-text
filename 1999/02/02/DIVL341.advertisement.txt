TRUTH ABOUT
ACTION
The Center for Individual Rights, a right wing litigation group in
Washington, funded by several racially repressive foundations 1 Gu
in our country, has recently spent many thousands of dollars 1 |
publicizing two major falsehoods about the legality of affirma- j I*l
tive action in college and university admissions. Under a two- 1
inch banner headline "Guilty by Admission," untrue statements IHIK
have been published by the Center for Individual Rights in full- 1
page advertisements appearing in at least 15 elite university cam- 1
pus newspapers including yours. 1 ZS-
In the first part of its advertisement, the Center for Individual 1
Rights has misrepresented the state of the law governing the use of 1
race-sensitive admissions policies at state universities. While there I
are a number of lower court decisions rejecting varying forms of 1 ZZZZ
racial preferences, the law governing admissions to our state univer
sities is clear. In the 1978 landmark Bakke decision, the United States
Supreme Court authorized the consideration of race in admissions at state
operated colleges and universities.
The Bakke decision has been the law of the land for the past 21 years. This
ruling has never been changed by the Supreme Court. Contrary to the decep
tive scare tactics employed by the Center for Individual Rights, university
°'-ministrators and trustees may properly act in accordance with the decision
in the Bakke case.

J 1 in their admissions policies.

j I decisions banning certain extreme policies involving racial
// 1 quotas and other aggressive forms of affirmative action in col
-1 lege admissions apply only to state universities.
I It is regrettable that racial conservatives in our country, who
wish to drive black people out of our major universities, have
chosen to attain their goals by spreading deceptions rather than telling the
truth about the state of the law in our country. These advertisements in stu
dent newspapers should be dismissed as a reprehensible and craven effort to
frighten university students, admissions officers, and trustees.
