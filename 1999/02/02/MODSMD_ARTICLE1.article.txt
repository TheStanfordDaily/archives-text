Stanford a cappella groups had a
great showing at the Contemporary
A Cappella Recording Awards this
year with a record 14 nominations
in various categories.
That is an amazingly high num
ber of nominations for one school,
according to Deke Sharon, presi
dent of the society. "Stanford a cap
pella groups have once again
proven to be some of the strongest
and most accomplished in the na
tion." he said. "It's rare for so many
excellent groups to come out of one
school."
The awards were started in 1992
by the Contemporary A Cappella
Society, a non-profit organization
founded in 1990 to foster and pro
mote a cappella music of all styles.
They are designed to recognize ex
cellence in recorded a cappella of
all styles around the globe.
I he awards have three divisions:
male groups, female groups and
mixed groups. Within each group
there are four categories: best
album, best song, best soloist and
best arranger. Stanford a cappella
groups had a total of 14 nomina
tions in the twelve different cate
gories.
Talisman was nominated for
best mixed group album. The Men
dicants, Fleet Street and Everyday
people received three nominations
each and Counterpoint. Stanford's
all-woman group, received four
nominations, one for each category.
Members of the groups are
thrilled about the nominations. Ju
nior Jeff Sehwegman of Fleet Street
commented. "I'm glad that a pro
ject which we dedicated the majori
ty of our time to last year has been
recognized."
Their CD, "All the Rage." is up
for best album. The group's rendi
tion of "Real Genius" is nominated
for best song, while group member
John Niekrasz is a candidate for
best arranger.
Freshman Carolyn Starr of

Counterpoint said, "we are ex
tremely thrilled to receive all these
nominations. It was a very pleasant
surprise."
Almost all the songs were pro
duced by Bill Hare of Bill Hare Pro
ductions in San Jose. He has had a
long history of working with Stan
ford a cappella groups and started
producing for the Mendicants back
in 1988.
Hare said he was very proud of
the groups for their accomplish
ments. "Every year, these groups
need to hit a new benchmark, and
Stanford has always been one of the
best for a cappella groups."
As for his contribution to the
nominations, he said he feels that
he guided them along, but it was
mostly the result of the groups' hard
work with the arrangements and
songs. "I show them their options to
represent them as best as they can
sound," I hire said.
Along with the high number of
nominations, Stanford a cappella
got another boost when the society
published its Best of College A
Cappella 1999 song list. Stanford
and the University of Pennsylvania
were the only two schools with four
featured groups.
The society will produce a CD,
featuring the listed songs. Stan
ford's Fleet Street, Everyday Peo
ple, Mixed Company and Counter
point will be featured on the CI),
which is due to come out in a few
weeks.
This is the fifth year the annual
CD has been produced. Adam Farb
of Smokin' Fish Records, which
produces the CD. said that "it is
very rare to have so many groups
from one school, but both Stanford
and Penn had very solid tracks
worth putting on."
Each year, Farb receives about
1(H) college CDs from which he
chooses 19 tracks. Only one track
per group is allowed. Stanford's
were selected because "the albums
were very well done and recorded
well," Farb said.
