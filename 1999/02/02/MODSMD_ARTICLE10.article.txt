Polls show disapproval of Republicans
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans are taking a hit in the polls
by pursuing the impeachment of a popular president, but a lot could
happen to change the numbers before the 2000 elections.
Democratic strategists are crowing about current polls that show
almost six out of 10 people disapprove of how Senate Republicans
are handling the impeachment trial. Two-thirds of the public
approves of the way Clinton is doing his job. according to several
polls.
Perhaps more troubling for Republicans is that some polls show
Democrats are getting better marks on handling top issues. A Pew
poll of 1,200 taken in mid-January gave Democrats a marked advan
tage on who has the best ideas on everything from education to HMO
reform to Social Security.
Democrats had a strong edge in the traditionally strong Republi
can area of tax cuts for the middle class and a narrow edge on the
global economy. Republicans had the edge on handling the issue of
morality, the poll showed.
AIDS prevention gets cheaper
CHICAGO (AP) — Researchers trying to reduce the cost of pre
venting AIDS among the world's poor have found that giving mothers
standard medicines for just a week cuts the risk they will pass on the
virus during childbirth by more than one-third.
Doctors have known for about five years that the drug AZT during
pregnancy blocks HIV-infected mothers from giving the virus to their
babies. However, such information is of little use in places such as
Africa and India, where most mother-to-child transmission of AIDS
occurs.
In wealthy countries, infected mothers typically receive five months
of AZT, a treatment that can cost more than $1,000. Such therapy is
impossible in places where even aspirin is unaffordable and prenatal
care is unheard of.
Doctors reported yesterday that a far less intensive kind of treat
ment works reasonably well, even though not as effectively as the stan
dard U.S. approach.
If this or some similar approach is tried, it could have a major
impact on the spread of AIDS during childbirth, which now accounts
for nearly 6(X),(XX) HIV infections around the world each year.
To Mars and beyond
WASHINGTON (AP) —To mark the 100 th anniversary of the
Wright Brothers' first airplane flight. NASA wants to duplicate the
event — sort of — on Mars.
The NASA budget for 2(XX) contains $50 million to begin develop
ment of a Mars airplane.
An animated video played at the budget briefing showed a small,
pilotless plane parachuting toward the sandy surface, unfolding its
wings and propeller, and puttering off.
The goal, if all goes well, is to make the flight in 2003, the 100 th
anniversary of the Wright Brothers' flight.
