# Clinton unveils $1.77 trillon budget

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Ush-
ering in the new millennium with
the promise of huge federal surplus
es, President Clinton yesterday pro
posed a $1.77 trillion budget for the
year 2(XX) that would buttress Social
Security and bestow billions on
everything from troops to teachers.
Republicans who control
Congress immediately vowed to
rework much of it. Staking out this
year's political battlefield, they
insisted that hundreds of billions of
the $2.41 trillion in surpluses Clin
ton envisions over the next decade
should be returned to Americans in
tax-rate cuts, not used for new
spending.

"Basic fairness dictates that
some of this overpayment should go
back to the taxpayers," said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
Economists caution that a deep,
protracted recession could erase the
projected black ink, which began
abruptly last year with a surplus of
$69 billion.
But Clinton exulted that after
three decades of unremitting
deficits, the mountains of money
give Washington "a special obliga
tion" to address problems gnawing
at the country. He would not only
brace the government for the loom
ing retirement of 76 million baby
boomers, but reduce the $5.6 trillion

national debt built over decades of
federal borrowing — and spend
money for scores of other purposes.
"We have a rare opportunity
that comes along once in a blue
moon to any group of Americans,"
Clinton said as he outlined his plan
at the White House.
The partisan positioning under
lined how even in a time of budget
plenty, the two parties are largely
continuing familiar appeals to their
political bases. Democrats are rally
ing behind Social Security and
expanded domestic spending, while
Republicans are raising their twin
banners of tax cuts and smaller gov
ernment.

Clinton would spend $39 billion
more, or 2 percent more, than is
planned for fiscal year 1999, which
runs through Sept. 30. But thanks to
the humming economy, he antici
pates $77 billion more in federal
revenue, allowing this year's expect
ed $79 billion surplus to swell to
$117 billion in 2000.
Republicans agreed with Clinton
that most of the surpluses should be
set aside to trim the national debt
and strengthen Social Security. But
the two sides are already fighting
over how to do that.
Overall, Clinton proposed at
least $129 billion in new initiatives,
both in new spending and tax cuts.
