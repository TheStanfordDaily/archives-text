# House prosecutors question Lewinsky
## First witness testifies 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —In their first
face-to-face meeting. White House lawyers
offered Monica Lewinsky an apology yester
day "on behalf of the president" for the dif
ficulties the impeachment investigation has
caused her. They turned down the chance to
ask any questions during sworn testimony
forced by House prosecutors.
The deposition of the former White
House intern took place behind closed doors
in the Mayflower Hotel's presidential suite
but was videotaped for senators weighing
the impeachment charges.
Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., spent about
four hours posing questions on behalf of the
House prosecution team that fought to per
suade the Senate to summon Lewinsky. Her
testimony closely tracked her earlier account
to a federal grand jury, according to sources
familiar with the testimony who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
The sources were not associated with the
House prosecution team and worked outside
the White House. Lewinsky's lawyers
declined comment.
By not questioning Lewinsky, the Clinton

lawyers passed up an opportunity to chal
lenge her statements.
One source said Lewinsky reaffirmed
that:
•When she asked Clinton what to do
about subpoenaed gifts from him on Dec. 28,
1997, his response was something like "let
me think about it."
White House lawyers had argued to the
Senate that on other occasions, Lewinsky
said Clinton had no reaction.
•In a middle-of-the-night conversation on
Dec. 17, 1997, Clinton told her she was on
the witness list in Paula Jones' sexual harass
ment lawsuit, suggested she could file an
affidavit and mentioned their previously
arranged cover stories to explain why she
was coming to see the president. Lewinsky
filed a false affidavit denying an affair.
Bryant would not discuss the substance of
the questioning, which lasted far less than
the eight hours set aside by the Senate, but
said he "felt it was a productive session."
Six senators, three Republicans and three
Democrats, sat in on the session, with two at
a time acting as referees.
