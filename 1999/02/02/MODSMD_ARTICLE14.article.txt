## Editorial Ignoring students 
### 
Casper's decision
not to use Nom
Comm was incorrect

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
Gerhard Casper's decision
to unilaterally select stu
dents to serve on the search commit
tee for a new provost, as opposed to
using the ASSU Nominations Com
mission at his disposal for this pur
pose, was a mistake.
No one should dispute the fact
that the students whom Casper
selected, ASSU President Maren
Norton and Emily Bender, a gradu
ate student in linguistics, are not fully
qualified for the job. Casper didn't
appoint anyone whom a student
commission would have rejected.
These types of decisions are,
according to University policy,
entirely appropriate for Casper to
make.
What we find to be inappropriate
is the removal of student input from
the task of selecting peer representa
tives to sueh an important committee.
The nominations commission
exists for a reason. It provides the
University administration with an
important vehicle for involving stu
dents' in important decisions. It
allows student voice to be heard.
Regardless of what conclusion
might have been reached had the
ASSU commission been involved in
the nomination process, Casper's
decision served to symbolically

remove students from contributing a
very significant viewpoint that will
affect how their next provost is cho
sen.
Every decision that is made in this
crucial process is a cumulative one.
ITie nominations commission should
have at least been given the opportu
nity to participate during this stage of
the search process.
Casper, who co-chairs the selec
tion committee with Developmental
Biology Prof. Lucy Shapiro, said ear
lier in one of his only official com
ments on the matter that he believes
the committee will make its selection
from the Stanford community,
although "an incredibly attractive
candidate from outside the Universi
ty will be considered."
At any university, it is vital that its
administration — its president in
particular — remains in touch with
the student body. In the end, it is the
university that serves its students, not
the other way around. A university
president who loses touch with his
students risks making decisions that
could alienate them.
ITiis is not to say that Casper has
by any means lost touch with Stan
ford students. But the decision could
serve as an isolating mechanism of
sorts between Casper and the will of
Stanford students.
In the future, we hope Casper will
realize that including students in the
nominations process and other deci
sions will reiterate the strong bond
between president and student body
and not serve to weaken it.
