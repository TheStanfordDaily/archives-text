Abolishing SLE is not the best option

I APPRECIATE LARRY Beyer's stab
at sarcasm in his proposal for a solution to
the persistent question of what to do with
Structured Liberal Education as a mildly
entertaining effort to contribute to the
recently renewed campus-wide discussion.
However, Beyer's presentation of non-
SLE students as unmotivated, perhaps the
very antithesis of the "bright-eyed, curious
and intellectually passionate students"
which he has encountered, suggests an iso
lation from a large percentage of our
undergraduate population. I do not intend
to demean the enthusiasm or belittle the
extra workload that SLE participants
assume, but rather to suggest (perhaps
idealistically) that such intellectual pas
sion is more widespread than Beyer has
recognized.
In my two years at Stanford, between
my resident assistant in Donner, my com
panions in a religious studies class and dis
cussions on my last earth systems field
trip, SLE freshmen and ex-SLE students
have made undeniable contributions to
my personal education and the intellectual
"atmosphere" of my Stanford experience.
It is the desire to exchange ideas, get into
the real substance of courses and expose
oneself to diverse experiences which made
this possible.
Such intellectual intercourse is not, and
cannot by its very nature, be considered an
exercise in the diffusion of knowledge

from the greater concentration of Beyer's
SLE freshmen to the lesser concentration
of the rest of campus. SLE participants are
by virtue of the program self-motivated,
but Beyer paints them as the lone beacons
of intellectual enthusiasm and intelligence
protecting our campus from crashing upon
the rocky shoreline of ignorant apathy.
We are here to learn from each other,
not to automatically relegate ourselves to
intellectual categories based on areas of
interest we designated upon our initial
enrollment. I speak for myself and for
many others in saying that I am not inter
ested in the "bare minimum" required
merely to "get by academically."
I enrolled in history CIV not because I
wanted an easy freshman year but because
1 had the desire to acquire a decent foun
dation in this particular area above any of
the other CIV choices.
Perhaps our old CIV program, with its
coherent, three-quarter sequence, was
limiting for students; it was difficult to
switch from one track to another if neces
sary, and it's a given that students who
were genuinely uninterested in history,
philosophy, anthropology and so on would
experience an almost inescapable feeling
of boredom being stuck in Annenberg on
a beautiful spring afternoon.
As I see it, the purpose of the CIV and
Introduction to the Humanities programs
is to provide students with an interdisci

plinary command of a particular subject
that they can take into our academic com
munity and run with.
Let's not presume so much about those
peers who opt for a particular concentra
tion initially or condescend those who do
not choose the most comprehensive track
historically offered under the auspices of
CIV or I-Hum.
The humor of.Beyer's cute solution to
dissolve SLE in order to introduce mental
energy into the intellectual quagmire that
is our university is lost on me because I
don't see Stanford as a place for the bored,
boring, unmotivated, unstimulated mass
of American youth.
We all have so much potential, and it
seems apparent that it is now required of
our generation to prove not only our intel
lectual capability but our desire to learn.
Let us begin.

1 WAS SOMEWHAT surprised to see
a recent letter to The Daily suggesting an
end to SLE on the grounds that "an infu
sion of bright-eyed, curious and intellectu
ally passionate students" would "electrify"
other first-year courses.
Larry Beyer is not personally acquaint-

Ed with Stanford undergraduates. If we
non-SLE students are just doing the bare
minimum to get by, why not, instead of
dismantling the SLE program, expand it to
engulf the entire freshman class? Or per
haps the whole undergraduate student
body? Then we'd all be electrocuted.
Maybe the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions should just trim away the fat
of non-SLE students and form a "perfect"
society of bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
undergraduates hopping about, happily
discussing the latest theories about Plato's
sleeping patterns.
Had I known that everyone else
(except SLE alumni, of course) in all of
my classes were intent on just getting by, I
would have tried a lot less these past
three-odd years and strived instead for a
perfect 2.0 CPA. Surely all of Beyer's
undergraduate non-SLE friends must
have a 2.0, plus or minus the occasional
non-SLE genius who has a 2.1 as a result
of one class' particularly generous curve.
I am not writing this letter to insult
SLE. I couldn't do that; a few of my
friends were in SLE. I'm simply suggesting
to Beyer that a couple of hard-working
freshmen over the years, I'd say, roughly,
THOUSANDS, chose not to engage in the
SLE experience and are doing just fine.
