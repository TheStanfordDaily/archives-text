# Freshman already
## has one Nobel prize

At age 16. Sohini Ramachandran still hasn't
gotten her driver's license. But this Stanford
freshman has already traveled to where only a
privileged few will ever go: the Nohel awards
ceremony in Stockholm.
In November Ramachandran received the
Glenn T. Seaborg Nobel Travel Award, mak
ing her one of only four young Americans cho
sen to go to the Swedish International Youth

Science Seminar. The weeklong gathering of 30
top science students from around the world cul
minated in attendance of the Nobel awards cer

because they considered her the best science
student in California. It's not hard to see why.
After skipping kindergarten and the 10th grade
in her hometown of Sacramento, she was an in
coming high school senior in 1997 when she

joined forces with Stanford Biology
Prof. Marcus Feldman to pursue the
prize at the Westinghouse National
Science Talent Search.
"She was much more advanced
than any other high school student I'd
seen before," said Feldman. who met
Ramachandran through her older sis
ter Rageshree, a Stanford alumna.
"Most students don't have enough in
formation in both math and biology
for this kind of project."
Ramachandran's project, involv
ing mathematical calculations of ge
netic relationships based on repeti
tive strains of DNA. was good for
fourth place. Her achievements got
the attention of the Seaborg Founda
tion, which funds the all-expense
paid trips for the Travel Award win
ners.
After entering Stanford last fall.
Ramachandran was summoned to
Ames Research Center in Mountain
View for the first round of interviews
for the Travel Award. Surviving to
become one of the five finalists, she
was interviewed again in Berkeley by
Glenn T. Seaborg himself, 1951
Nobel chemistry prize winner and
professor emeritus at UC-Berkeley,
who founded the award. Then she
was on her way to Stockholm.
"It was magnificent," said Ra

machandran in an interview in her cu
bicle in Gilbert, where she still works
with Feldman as a research assistant.
"It was amazing to see scientists being
recognized by humanity for their con
tribution to our culture." A high
point was seeing Stanford's own
Robert Laughlin receive the physics
award, she said.
Watching the ceremony also gave
Ramachandran a different perspec
tive on the award.
"I used to think that winning the
Nobel would be the most that you
could achieve," she said. "But after
the ceremony I realized that you can't
work toward the Nobel as an end."
The real reward, she said, is doing the
research that has that much impact
â€” after that, the prize is "anticlimac
tic."
Ramachandran now aims to get
her doctorate in biology and hopes to
go into academia. She said that her
parents, who are both math profes
sors at Sacramento State, seem to
have jobs that give them the time to
have family lives outside of their ca
reers.
Ramachandran admits that she
doesn't have much time these days
for activities outside of schoolwork.
Perhaps it was the incongruity of a
girl still in her middle teens being so
deeply involved in the hardest of hard
sciences that led her friends to dub
her "Science Spice."
Talk about girl power.
