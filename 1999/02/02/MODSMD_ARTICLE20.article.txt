The indoor debut for the meat
and potatoes of Stanford's track
squad produced championship
caliber competition this weekend
as the Cardinal grabbed five
NCA A automatic- and two provi
sional-qualifying marks in the Pa
triot-Hoya Coalition meet at
George Mason University.
Paced by the strength of its dis
tance corps, Stanford showed such
track and field powerhouses as
Arkansas and George Mason that
the Cardinal will continue to be a
force to be reckoned with on and
around the oval.
Brothers Brad and Brent
Hauser helped lead the way for
the Stanford contingent, placing
second and fourth in the 5.000-
meter run with times of 13 min
utes, 42 seconds and 13:44.64, re
spectively. Jason Balkman was a
close fifth at 13:50.84, a 10-second
personal best, and all three times
were automatic NCAA qualifiers.
In the3,ooometers,sophomore
Jonathon Riley was the top colle
giate finisher with a third-place
outing, touring the track to the
tune of a 7:59.70 provisional qual
ifier, just .20 seconds away from
the automatic standard.
"Our primary goal was to
achieve NCAA qualifying
marks," head coach Vin Lananna
said. "[The distance runners']
marks were electrifying and indi
cate that they will be contenders
for top spots at the NCAAs."
Also securing places in the na
tional meet were senior Adam
Connolly, w ho destroyed the com
petition by nearly eight feet with
his 69-foot, 3 1/4-inch toss of the
35-pound weight, and junior Toby
Stevenson, who soared to an easy
victory in the pole vault at 17-2
3/4.
"The strength of our men's
team this year will be our ability to
have great performances in all
events," said Lananna. "Toby and
Adam were essential to our
NCAA runner-up finish last year
and will be major factor; again this
year."
Stevenson met the NCAA pro
visional qualifying mark, while
Connolly surpassed the automatic
qualifying standard by more than
nine inches.
Stanford's other automatic
mark came in the distance medley
relay, where the Cardinal won a
hotly contested race with the pro
fessionally sponsored Reebok En
clave among others in a time of
9:38.17 to the Enclave's 9:40.54.
Junior Michael Stember opened
the race with a blistering 2:54 in the
1,200 meters and handed the baton
to senior captain Jeff Allen, who
cruised through the 400-meter leg.
Scphomore Mark Hassell then
maintained for another 800 meters
before handing the race over to

Riley, who ended any speculation
as to the race's outcome with a
4:(K).8 final 1,600 meters.
"The track wasn't all that great
and the meet was pretty small, but
when you have good competition,
the races are going to be really
fast," said Riley. "We were all pret
ty pumped up to compete."
Stember was second in the open
mile with a time of 4:05.53, just .03
seconds off the provisional mark,
and freshman Michael Ponikvar
debuted with a second-place high
jump of 6-11. Sophomore Todd
Beyerlein continued to shine,
matching Ponikvar's mark but tak
ing third on attempts.
"Our results in the high jump
demonstrate that Todd and
Michael can be counted on for big
points," Lananna said.
"I was thrilled with how well
everyone competed and with the
number of NCAA qualifiers. This
meet demonstrated that we have a
verv good track and field team."
