On paper, the outcome of last Friday night's
women's gymnastics match between the No. 10 Stan
ford Cardinal and the No. 13 Oregon State Beavers
seemed obvious. The Cardinal had lost its only All-
American, Larissa Fontaine, to injury and another Car
dinal star, Jen Exaltacion, was limited to two events be
cause of a foot injury.
On paper, it seemed a forgone conclusion that Ore
gon State would defeat the hobbling Cardinal.
But they don't play the games on paper.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

â–  Friday: No. 10 Stanford 195.350. No. 13 Oregon State
193.375.

The Cardinal reminded everyone of that fact Friday
night en route to an impressive 195.350-193.3575 victo
ry over the Beavers before a crowd of more than 1 .(XX)
at Burnham Pavilion.
"I'm extremely happy [with the performance]," said
Stanford head coach Mark Cook. "A couple of girls had
to step it up for Larissa and they really did a good job of
that."

fort as it was the result of outstanding individual perfor
mances, two Cardinal gymnasts in particular filled the
void left by Fontaine and Exaltacion.
