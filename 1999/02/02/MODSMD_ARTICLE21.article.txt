# Records fall for women's gymnastics
## 
### Ramona Shelburne Contributing writer 
On paper, the outcome of last Friday night's
women's gymnastics match between the No. 10 Stan
ford Cardinal and the No. 13 Oregon State Beavers
seemed obvious. The Cardinal had lost its only All-
American, Larissa Fontaine, to injury and another Car
dinal star, Jen Exaltacion, was limited to two events be
cause of a foot injury.
On paper, it seemed a forgone conclusion that Ore
gon State would defeat the hobbling Cardinal.
But they don't play the games on paper.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Friday: No. 10 Stanford 195.350. No. 13 Oregon State
193.375.

The Cardinal reminded everyone of that fact Friday
night en route to an impressive 195.350-193.3575 victo
ry over the Beavers before a crowd of more than 1 .(XX)
at Burnham Pavilion.
"I'm extremely happy [with the performance]," said
Stanford head coach Mark Cook. "A couple of girls had
to step it up for Larissa and they really did a good job of
that."
And while Friday night's win was as much a team ef
fort as it was the result of outstanding individual perfor
mances, two Cardinal gymnasts in particular filled the
void left by Fontaine and Exaltacion.
Senior co-captain Amy Murakami won event cham-

pionships on two apparatus and
sophomore Jenny Wilson captured
the all-around title (38.875) and the
event championship in the vaulting
competition (9.8(H)).
Murakami returned to full
strength with a vengeance on Friday
after recovering from a bout with
the flu that limited her to one event
last week against California. She
showed no signs of rust while setting
a new school record on the uneven
bars with a near-perfect 9.975 and
finishing in a tie for first place on the
balance beam with Exaltacion
(9.850).
Murakami wasn't the only Cardi
nal gymnast to excel on the uneven
bars as Stanford swept the top three
spots in the event and posted the
highest total in school history in the
event (49.475) in what may have
been the turning point of the meet.

After the first rotation, the Car
dinal held a slim 48.425-48.175 lead
hut then picked up a full point on
the Beavers with its score on the un
even bars and for all intents and pur
poses put the match away.
"I'm really proud of how we all
pulled together," said Murakami.
"One of the biggest things we've got
going for us this year is depth; we
just keep pushing each other to be
better."
And while few could have
pushed Murakami to be any better
— only a perfect ten is higher than
the 9.975 she posted on the bars
freshman teammate Kristin Jensen
came close with a sensational bar
routine of 9.925 that earned second
place honors.
Stanford will look to carry the
momentum from last week's win
into one of its most important
matches of the year when the Cardi
nal squares off against No. 7 Penn
State and No. 9 UCLA Friday night
at 7:30 p.m at Maples Pavilion.
