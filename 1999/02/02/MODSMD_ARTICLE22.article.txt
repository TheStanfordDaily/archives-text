## Women post qualifiers 
### Barry Cooper Contributing writer 
The Stanford
women's track
and field team ar
rived at Washing
ton Dulles Air
port last weekend

with a national
agenda. Rather than heading to the
nation's capital, they headed to
George Mason University in Fair
fax, Va., where the Cardinal ath
letes tried to qualify for the indoor
national championships to he held
in Indianapolis on the first weekend
in March.
Despite strong opposition from
other programs, including co-host
Georgetown, Arkansas, Wisconsin
and North Carolina, a total of five
runners met automatic or provi
sional qualifying times for NCAAs.
The highlight race of the two

day meet for Stanford was by far
Julia Stamps' victory in the 3.(K)0
meters on Saturday.
Stamps, coming off her second
straight top-six finish at cross-coun
try nationals, debuted the track sea
son with a personal best and auto
matic qualifying time of nine min
utes, 16.47 seconds. Not only did it
improve her previous best by over
five seconds, but the time would
have been good enough to win last
year's national meet by more than
eight seconds. Stamps finished fifth
in that race.
"It felt great being back on the
track and especially feeling really,
really strong," said Stamps. "It felt
easy and I felt really confident and
strong."
Head coach Vin Lananna was
very pleased with Stamps's even
paced race.
"Julia has been training really
well, and she is quite fit right now,"

said Lananna. "The goal was to
qualify for the nationals and to post
a fast time. Julia is no stranger to
top-level competition, and we an
ticipate that she will continue to be
a major player at the NCAAs."
Stamps was not the only one to
qualify for nationals in the 3,000.
Teammate Courtney Adams fin
ished fifth with a provisional quali
fying time of 9:29.10. Adams, who is
from Indianapolis, is likely to have
a homecoming party in March, with
her time well below the 9:42 stan
dard.
Right behind Adams in sixth
place was All-American Sally
Glynn, missing the standard by a lit
tle more than three seconds.
Although Glynn missed the
mark in that race, on Friday she had
led off the distance medley relay for
Stanford which finished fourth in


Stamps
9:30.15, a provisional qualifying
mark. Joining her in that event were
Stamps, Jayna Smith and Cynthia
Morman.
Like Stamps, Smith nearly qual
ified in two events, finishing second
to Cydonie Mothersill of George
Mason. Smith's time of 55.95 was
.95 off the provisional standard.
Considering it was her first individ
ual performance in more than a
year, it was very impressive.
"I was a little scared because I
redshirtcd last year," said Smith.
"This has been my first quarter of
indoor since my freshmen year, so I
was a little nervous about getting
back into the swing of things."
For the second straight week
end, the Cardinal throwers showed
strength in numbers. In the shot
put, Cassie Romuld, Erin Fletcher
and Maggie Isaac combined to fin

ish second, third and eighth respec
tively.
Isaac also finished second in the
20-pound weight throw, with team
mate Summer Peirson behind her
in third.
"The throwing corps is a solid
cornerstone of the women's pro
gram," said Lananna. "Coach
Robert Weir has done a great job of
preparing these athletes. We will
rely on the throwers for big points
at the Mountain Pacific [Sports
Federation] Championships. If they
throw well, we can win the confer
ence meet."
Other top-five finishers at the
meet were Wilsa Charles, who fin
ished fourth in the 60 meters, and
freshmen Robyn Woolfolk, who
took fourth in the 60-meter hurdles.
The Cardinal will travel to Reno
this weekend for the second time
this season for the Bill Cosby Invite.
Pole-vaulter Melissa Feinstein will
head to New York for the Millrose
Games.
