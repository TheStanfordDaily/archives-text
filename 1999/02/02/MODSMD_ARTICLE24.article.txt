### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
The Cardinal
made a strong
statement to its
Pacific 10 Confer
ence rivals last
weekend, blitzing
three of its com-

petitors 9-0 and suggesting to the rest
that it is one of the top contenders for
the conference crown.
The Stanford women's tennis
team improved its record to 5-0 in
dual-match play and 3-0 in the Pac
-10.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Sunday: No. 5 Stanford 9, Oregon
0.

■ Saturday: Stanford 9, Washington
0.

■ Friday: Stanford 9, Washington
State 0. *

Neither Washington State, Wash
ington nor Oregon eould make an
impression upon the Stanford
women, although Washington man
aged to provide a few scares.
Friday's encounter with Wash
ington State (0-1,0-1 Pac-10) wasn't
a memorable one, as the Cardinal
posted easy wins at every position.
Freshman Gabby Lastra, playing
at the No. 3 singles spot, was, howev
er, extended to three sets in her
match against the Cougars' Andrea
Reisz. Lastra was outplayed in the
first set. but picked up her game and
became more aggressive in order to
coast to victory in the last two sets for
a 4-6,6-1,6-0 triumph.
Veteran star and junior captain
Teryn Ashley displayed fine form in
her match against the Cougars' Pa
tryeja Gajdzik at the No. 2 singles po
sition. Ashley, flaunting the tremen
dous serve and overpowering
ground strokes that made her an All-
American last season, denied her op
ponent a single game, scoring a dou
ble-bagel against Gajdzik, 6-0,6-0.
Ashley, along with her team
mates, produced the same inspired
play in Saturday's match with Wash
ington. Unlike Washington State,
though, Washington (4-1, 0-1)
seemed prepared to meet the Cardi
nal's challenge.
The Huskies were not to be un
derestimated. Led by the strong
coaching of Patty Fendick. who fol
lowed her successful collegiate cam
paign at Stanford with a solid profes
sional career, the Huskies have
made remarkable strides in recent
years. Two I luskies defeated No. 4

California's top two singles players.

tus, in a recent meeting between the
two teams.
Against the Cardinal, every sin
gles match was tight, yet somehow
the Stanford women pulled out vic
tories at every position.
Once again. No. 3 Lastra dealt
with an especially tough opponent.
She persevered, saving two set
points in the second set to topple
Washington's Ilona Kordonskaya 7-
5, 7-6 in a match that lasted more
than two hours.
"I wasn't really match-tough be
fore [these two matches]," Lastra
said. "The girl I played on Friday put
no pace on the ball, and today, my
opponent hit it really hard, so it was
an adjustment. But I was down two
set-points, and I pulled it out. so my
focus is there."
The Cardinal brought that same
competitive edge into its Sunday en
counter with Oregon (0-2, 0-2).
None of the top-five singles players
dropped a set and sophomore Sarah
Pestieau. competing at the No. 6 po
sition, easily swept past Oregon's
Shanelle Kaneshiro after dropping a
tight first set, 4-6,6-2,6-0.
Freshman Lauren Kalvaria sat
out the singles on Sunday in order to
rest a lingering foot injury, but she
looked impressive at the No. 2 dou
bles spot, teaming with Lastra to
overwhelm Oregon's duo of
Kaneshiro and Andrea Petrovic, 8-
0.
The team of Lastra / Kalvaria has
been courting a lot of attention in re
cent weeks. The women played to
gether in the juniors and strung to
gether a remarkable junior doubles
campaign. The team's chemistry en
dured as the two both headed off to
Stanford.
"1 played with Lauren for two
years in the juniors," Lastra said.
"The doubles is going really well."
Kalvaria provides the power for
the team while Lastra demonstrates
uncanny finesse, yet both display
prowess at the net and an ability to
scamper after their opponents' lobs.
"They're a very cagey team," said
senior Marisa Maclennan, who sat
out the weekend with a mild knee in
jury. "I'm really impressed by those
two."
Not only are they mentally tough,
they're relentlessly determined — in
an effort to retrieve a clever shot by
their opponents. Lastra took a dra
matic spill on the cement on match
point against Washington's Svan
feldt I Wagner.
The team will take on Santa Clara
today at 1:30 at the laube Family
Tennis Center.
