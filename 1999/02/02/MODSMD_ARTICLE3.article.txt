Overseas Studies plans to re-open its Moscow campus this fall, after temporarily suspending the
program last year due to the political and financial crisis in Russia, according to Director of Overseas
Studies Russell Berman.
"The program had been suspended in the midst of a political crisis," Berman said. "We did not
want to take any risk with the well-being of undergraduates.
"It is likely that we could have run the program anyway, but we erred on the side of caution. Our
intention had always been to reopen the program in the autumn, pending stabilization, and that is
what we are doing."

Berman added that he thinks the Moscow program provides Stanford students with a
unique experience.
"For most of this century Russia has been closed for Americans," Berman said. "In the life

A big part of the decision to suspend the Moscow program centered ori the shut down
of Russian banks last fall, according to Carol Price, associate director of Over-

"It was a temporary problem last year," Price said. "The banks are now

is such an exciting place, and there is so much going on there. I think it's
really important for students to be able to go."
Stanford was the only university in the nation to close its Russia pro
gram last fall, according to an article in the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion.

Student musicians who play strings or woodwinds will have the op
portunity to audition to work with the Moscow Chamber Orchestra,
Price said. Stanford set up a partnership with the chamber orchestra
last year, but was unable to go forward with the program.
The political and economic changes in Moscow. Price said, will
i make studying there an even more interesting opportunity for Stan
ford students.

"It's a major country, going through a major transi
tion," Price said. "It's really quite an exciting time to be
in Moscow."

Senior Hugh Handeyside, an advising associate
for the program, studied at the Moscow campus in
the fall of 1997.
