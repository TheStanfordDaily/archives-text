## 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
Although Dee Dee Myers said
the media has exaggerated the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, the for
mer White House press secretary
argued last night President Clinton
deserves censure but should re
main in office.
Myers, who worked in the
White House from 1993 until 1994.
personally deplored "the damage
[Clinton has] done to his ability to
get things done and to his support
ers who elected him and believed
in him."
Myers told the Kresge Auditori
um audience that she predicts cen
sure. "Even though probably all
100 senators know that he won't be
removed, they — most feel this
way — want a formal censure of
fact," she said.
Many people ask her if she was
surprised by the Lewinsky scandal.
Myers said. She said she was accus
tomed to hearing such allegations

but thai she believed the President
"knew if he got caught, it would be
incredibly destructive to his presi
dency, and I thought it was a risk he
wouldn't take."
However he is "the most talent
ed person I've ever known. He has
raw intelligence, he's a voracious
reader, he has a nearly photo
graphic memory, he can synthesize
amounts of information — it's a de
finition of genius... .I 've seen him
blow away people who thought
they were experts."
According to Myers. Clinton's
personality allows him to charm in
dividual Americans. "He flirts with
men. he flirts with women, he flirts
with animals." she said. "He's the
unparalleled master of the modern
media world."
Hut the changes in modern
media may make it more difficult
for leaders to govern, added
Myers, who is a political editor for
Vanity Fair magazine.

dience in
Krege Audito
rium last night
that Clinton
should be cen
sured but not
removed from
office.
The speed at which information
travels "has changed the political
culture as well as the media cul
ture," Myers said, and today lead
ers have less time to make deci
sions.
While Kennedy had three days
to consult with advisers about the
Cuban Missile Crisis, Clinton
would have only three minutes be
fore he was expected to have a
plan, according to Myers.
She said the release of the Starr
Report, which implicated Presi
dent Clinton in a scandal involving
White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, was another example of
the changing way the public re
ceives information.
"In other years there would
have been at least a one day delay
for the report to be Xeroxed for the
press," she said. "Congress put it on
the Internet, and the entire world
can read it in one second."
Myers said that the media has
alienated people from the govern

ment.
"The attention has shut people
out who don't want to follow every
sentence David Kendall said today
on the floor" of the Senate, she
said.
As a result individuals must "go
out, find out the news and make a
decision."
She added that while the Wash
ington media reacted with "near
hysteria" to the news of the Lewin
sky scandal, the American people
"acted responsibly" and did not
allow the media attitudes to affect
their opinion.
The media's focus, though, may
affect President Clinton's legacy,
according to Myers.
In the White House Myers and
her colleagues would play the
"obituary game" on bad days. They
envisioned Clinton's obituary and
guessed which accomplishments or
failures would be most important.
Now, Myers said, Lewinsky would
be mentioned in the first para
graph.
"He has to do something in the
next two years to knock her down
to paragraph five," she said.
