### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
Although Dee Dee Myers said
the media has exaggerated the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, the for
mer White House press secretary
argued last night President Clinton
deserves censure but should re
main in office.
Myers, who worked in the
White House from 1993 until 1994.
personally deplored "the damage
[Clinton has] done to his ability to
get things done and to his support
ers who elected him and believed
in him."
Myers told the Kresge Auditori
um audience that she predicts cen
sure. "Even though probably all
100 senators know that he won't be
removed, they — most feel this
way — want a formal censure of
fact," she said.
Many people ask her if she was
surprised by the Lewinsky scandal.
Myers said. She said she was accus
tomed to hearing such allegations

but thai she believed the President
"knew if he got caught, it would be
incredibly destructive to his presi
dency, and I thought it was a risk he
wouldn't take."
However he is "the most talent
ed person I've ever known. He has
raw intelligence, he's a voracious
reader, he has a nearly photo
graphic memory, he can synthesize
amounts of information — it's a de
finition of genius... .I 've seen him
blow away people who thought
they were experts."
According to Myers. Clinton's
personality allows him to charm in
dividual Americans. "He flirts with
men. he flirts with women, he flirts
with animals." she said. "He's the
unparalleled master of the modern
media world."
Hut the changes in modern
media may make it more difficult
for leaders to govern, added
Myers, who is a political editor for
Vanity Fair magazine.
