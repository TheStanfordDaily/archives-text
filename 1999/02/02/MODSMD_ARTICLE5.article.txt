# Activist returns to Farm
## 
### Khai Nguyen 
Would you risk your Stanford education in
order to speak up for something that you truly
believed in? Paul Loeb did, and he never re
gretted his decision.
Loeb. then a sophomore, was suspended
from Stanford in 1972 for a protest related to
the Vietnam War. He never came back to the
University but returned to campus from Jan.
24 to 27 as part of the Haas Center's Visiting
Mentor Program.
Loeb lectured and talked with Stanford
students, inspiring them with stories about his
activism at Stanford in the early '70s and his
continuing commitment to social change.
Loeb spoke most about the causes of student

activism and non-activism and what students
should do to conquer the fear of speaking and
acting out on their beliefs.
The peaceful Stanford of today is very dif
ferent from the Stanford 30 years ago. amidst
heightening controversy over the Vietnam
War. Loeb. active in the movement on cam
pus against the war. remembered the "feeling
of a war zone" in Stanford at that time.
Student groups had emerged on campus
for the peace movement, some under the di
rection of faculty. Among them were Colum
bae, The Association of Old Crows headed by
a professor. Venceremos and The Associa
tion of Young Crows, the group to which
Loeb belonged. The groups' tactics
varied from peaceful community
bonding functions to more violent
activism. Each group claimed mem
bership of about 30 students.
"It is hard to get an exact number
of just how many students were in
volved," Loeb said. For instance,
800 students were arrested for
marching on El Camino, but not all
of those arrested were actively in
volved, while not all those involved
were arrested, according to Loeb.
However Loeb estimates that "per
haps a few hundred student lives
were oriented towards the peace
movement" and that "at peak times,
15 percent of the campus can be said
to be active."
As tension mounted after sever
al students were killed by the Ohio
National Guard at Kent State, Stan
ford and other university students
went on strike against the war.
Stanford felt the divisions be
tween administration, faculty and
students. Some student groups op
posed Stanford's role in the war.
According to Loeb, "Stanford
was among the 50 top government
contractors" for the war. Part of
Stanford's research and work in
physics, engineering and other labs
fed directly into the war effort. "A
place devoted to learning was heav
ily involved in the war," he said.
While groups like Columbae
called for nonviolent activism, Loeb
remembers other activists who be
lieved that "Stanford must feel the
cost of the war." These students
caused damage to University prop
erty and disrupted peace on cam
pus.
Loeb said, "the thought was a
broken window was a small price to
pay for the point the students were
making." Hut Loeb admits in retro
spect that the administration and
some students were rightly con
cerned that those actions could in

jure people.
Loeb was suspended at the
height of the tension between stu
dent activists and the Stanford ad
ministration. He and fellow activists
vehemently opposed the Honey
well Project, which was tied to the
University. According to Loeb,
aside from making thermostats,
Honeywell "produced cluster
bombs designed to maim peo
ple. ... The point [of the bombs]
was not to kill but to lower the
morale of the people by leaving
those injured to the care of others."
Loeb spoke out against this de
vice of "terrorism." When he and
others interrupted an interview be
tween a military recruiter and a
Stanford student at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center to de
mand an "open dialogue," the
group was asked to leave. Loeb and
several students were then suspend
ed from the University for three
quarters for "disrupting a legitimate
University function."
Prosecutor John Schwartz said
that "each defendant intruded upon
and refused to leave a private con
ference and prevented the effective
carrying out of the conference." The
Stanford judicial panel in charge the
case said the defendants "decided
that they had the right to prevent
other students from doing what
those students felt right."
"Looking back I still believe that
it was a worthwhile thing to do,"
Loeb said.
When asked whether he thinks
his life would be different if he had
stayed at Stanford, he responded
"Stanford wasn't the critical differ
ence. If 1 hadn't gotten involved,
that would have made a difference.
I would not have found the satisfac
tion that I have in my work n0w....
I have no regrets."
After leaving Stanford Loeb
completed his bachelor's degree at
the New School for Social Research
in New York. From 1974 to 1976 he
edited Liberation magazine and has
since written for a wide variety of

publications. He became an author
and lecturer, writing "Nuclear Cul
ture," "Hope in Hard Times" and
"Generation at the Crossroads: Ap
athy and Action in the American
Campus," a product of seven years
of interviewing college students. His
most recent work, "Soul of a Citi
zen: Living with Conviction in a
Cynical lime," which examines
why people get involved in public is
sues, will be published in May.
Loeb said his experiences have
taught him about how students
should pursue changes as well as
how he believes universities should
deal with activism.
His research on activism contra
dicts the claim that today's students
are "apathetic."
"Students today aren't apathet
ic," Loeb said. "To say that students
are uncaring is wrong. [Today's ex
pectations] don't take into consider
ation the changes that have oc
curred in society since the '60s. Stu
dents are often overwhelmed, feel
ing that there is nothing they can
do."
First, Loeb said he believes that
today's students have to answer to
higher financial pressures. The cost
of education has grown so high that
a student's priority is more often the
financing of his education rather
than social change, he said.
Also holding students back from
activism is the expectation of per
fection. Loeb said. "Students have
the model of the perfect activist in
their heads - a saint that they can not
live up to." Loeb calls this an "un
realistic model."
"If we're told that the people
who take a stand aren't human be
ings, where does that leave us?"
asked Loeb.
Instead. Loeb calls for students
to learn about history, to know the
movements that have changed the
world — the anti-apartheid, civil
rights and women's movements.
"Learning history can show you that
people have persisted through very
difficult situations."

"Look at how change occurs.
Learn about small people who have
made big efforts. If you don't know
about them, you'll feel isolated
when you take a stand.
To current student activists,
Loeb suggested, "Be patient; things
take a while to change. Listen; don't
just talk. Find out what people care
about. Organize your constituency,
but reach out to others. And you
don't have to be a saint."
Junior Sarah McMullen, an in
tern at Grow, a campus network for
student community organizing, said
that "organizing students can be
very lonely work if you aren't care
ful to build a strong support net
work. That's what I think I learned
from Paul Loeb — you have to be
strong enough to set limits for how
much you can do, and humble
enough to reach out to others when
it gets too tough. No one can do
everything alone."
According to Loeb, universities
also should play a large role in en
couraging students to be socially ac
tive. He said that they must teach
students the responsibilities of an
active citizen and do more to en
courage discussion, take risks and
be supportive.
Loeb called upon faculty to teach
social involvement and be active cit
izens, speaking up about social is
sues. There should be more support
for places like the Haas Center that
are aimed towards social involve
ment, Loeb said.
"If students don't learn how to
act like citizens in high school [or at J
Stanford, then where?" Loeb asked.
"The dominant model of the univer
sity is now focused on careerism and
individualism instead of society.
Universities should model students
to care about society first."
This may be a lot to ask from
both students and universities, but
Loeb urged would-be activists not
to shrink from the task. "People
might not answer if you ask, but if
you don't ask, people won't an
swer."
