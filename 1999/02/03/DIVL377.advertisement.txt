MONTH
Stanford
w
hen Brian Puskas made the decision
to attend Stanford, he knew it was
time to choose a new sport. Even
though he was an all-state swimmer in high school in
New Jersey, Brian says"I was too slow to swim, too
short for crew, and ultimate frisbee didn't have
enough contact. Still, I knew I wanted to play a com
petitive sport at Stanford." The solution? Lacrosse.
Today, the Cardinal lax team is glad Brian got out
of the pool and onto the field. The senior History
major is team captain and starting longstick defense
man. Now a fixture on the team, he scored his first
goal in the final game of the Chico National Lacrosse
Tournament in
November

ZOOLOGY 101
Of all animals in the wild, the unchallenged champion of balance
and traction is the mountain goat. Using that amazing animal as
inspiration, Nike took the wilderness into the lab to create the all
new Air Terra Goatek, the ultimate trail-running shoe
Goatek's state-of-the-art design mimics nature's
ty. Meanwhile, its cushioned interior design keeps your feet
secure and supported over ever-changing surfaces.
Look for Air Terra Goatek, a member of the Nike ALPHA project, in stores
everywhere later this spring.
Calling All Women Runners:
