# 180 students in program; Bravman to be dean
## Sterling Quad set for new college 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
Next year's incoming freshmen
will be presented with a new residen
tial housing program, a freshman /
sophomore college, to complement
the existing choices of all-freshman
housing, four-class housing and the
Program in Structured Liberal Edu
cation.
Two Sterling Quad houses, likely
Potter and Schiff, will house the 180-
person program, which will "provide
residential activities and programs
to complement (Stanford Introduc
tory Studies]," according to the press
release put out by the Residential
Programs Implementation Group,
the committee of faculty, staff and
students that proposed the changes.
Freshmen admitted to the pro
gram will have the option of remain

ing in it for sophomore year, giving
up a preferred year in the Draw to do
so. To compensate for the freshmen
moving into Sterling Quad. Faisan
and Soto will be converted from all
freshman to four-class dorms.
One of the primary goals of the
college will be to increase student
staff interaction, a model based on
Sophomore College.
"We want to make freshmen
aware that it's okay to be with and go
talk to faculty." said Material Sci
ences Prof. John Bravman. dean of
the new college.
Specific plans to encourage facul
ty-student dialogue are still in the
making, but they include residence
based seminars and faculty-aided
student presentations at the end of
the two-year program.
"We haven't figured this all out
yet, but we're considering a range of

options." Assoc. Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Ellen
Woods said. For example, "It would
be nice if faculty members gave
some priority to students living in the
college" for classes in SIS.
According to Vice Provost for
Student Affairs James Montova,
many of the proposed programs are
still in the development stage, be
cause the committee is still soliciting
input from students and faculty.
"We want to meet with currently
enrolled freshmen to see what types
of programming would work best
for them," Montova said.
A number of students expressed
worry that the University was focus
ing so many resources on helping
such a small number of students.
"My concern is that it will help

100 freshmen, not all of them," said
senior Paul Bodnar, a member of the
task force that recommended a fresh
man/sophomore college last fall.
"They're pumping a lot of resources
into one small segment of the popula
tion." He said he hoped that the Uni
versity would attempt to provide sim
ilar services for all students.
W(X)ds emphasized that the new
program is only one component of
the University's plan to improve fac
ulty-student interaction in the first
two years of college.
"This is a residential component
to a auricular solution, but there are
lots of other complementary pro
grams, like SIS and Sophomore Col
lege," Woods said.
Bravman, chair of the department
of materials science and senior asso
ciate dean for student affairs in the
School of Engineering, will move
into a house near Sterling Quad
owned by the University.
"Having a home for the dean
that's nearby will make it a more at
tractive gathering location," Brav

man said.
The resident fellows currently liv
ing in Potter and Schiff were planning
on moving out anyway, so those two
dorms are the most likely candidates
to house the new program. Montoya
emphasized, however, that the final
location has not yet been selected.
The resident fellow apartments in
the two houses will be filled with
graduate students or postdoctoral
fellows who will serve as resident tu
tors.
The program will move 90 fresh
men into Governor's Corner, an area
of campus that was previously re
served for upperclassmen.
"It's part of an effort to get more
students onto the west side of cam
pus," Bravman said.
Some students worry that the
freshmen will feel isolated in an area
of campus otherwise dominated by
upperclassmen.
"[Governor's Corner] tends to be
an isolating experience," said Potter
resident assistant Erik Benson. "[The
freshmen) might lose out on a part of
the freshmen experience."
Another concern is that the pro
gram will move upperclassmen out of
the two-room doubles in Sterling

Quad and into one-room doubles in
Florence Moore and Wilbur Halls,
putting freshmen in the two-room
doubles.
"A one-room double is a great
way to get to know people as a fresh
man," said Schitt RA Camilla Rich
mond.
Elise Maar. special assistant to
Vice Provost Montoya, acknowl
edged that the dorm situation was not
ideal. However, due to the proximity
to the house that the University wish
es to use for Bravman, Sterling Quad
seemed to be the most viable option.
According to University Finance
Director Adam Talley, the program
will cost approximately $18(),(XX) a
year, to be raised from a variety of
private sources.
The program will be initially au
thorized for five years, after which
the University will re-evaluate it.
"We have no vision to make this
the standard model for Stanford, but
if it's successful, it might expand,"
Bravman said.
The changes come from recom
mendations made in the fall of 1997
by a task force chaired by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Ramon Saldivar.
