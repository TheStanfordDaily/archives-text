### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
Next year's incoming freshmen
will be presented with a new residen
tial housing program, a freshman /
sophomore college, to complement
the existing choices of all-freshman
housing, four-class housing and the
Program in Structured Liberal Edu

Two Sterling Quad houses, likely
Potter and Schiff, will house the 180-
person program, which will "provide
residential activities and programs
to complement (Stanford Introduc

release put out by the Residential
Programs Implementation Group,

Undergraduate Education Ellen

college" for classes in SIS.

Student Affairs James Montova,
