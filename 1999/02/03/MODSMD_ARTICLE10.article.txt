# Alumni fight acne in infomercial
## 
### Jeanette Perez 
Blackheads, whiteheads, pimples,
zits, blemishes, breakouts no matter
what you call it, acne can pop up any
where and on anyone. Dermatolo
gists and Stanford alumni Katy
Rodan and Kathy Fields are prevent
ing acne, and they are doing it with in
fomercials.
Rodan and Fields are the proud
inventors of an acne treatment
known as Proactiv, which can only be
purchased through television in
fomercials. Their product is currently
the third-best-selling acne medicine
after Oxy and Clearasil.
The two first met at Stanford
Medical School and became very
close friends as they bonded and
studied for the medical board exams
together. After entering private prac
tice, they found that acne was the
problem their patients complained
about most frequently.
In Fields suggested that the
two should try and invent a make-up
product that would cover up blemish
es and give patients more self-confi
dence. As they began to investigate
this, they came up with the idea of
creating a medicine that not only
made acne go away, but could also
prevent it without being too harsh on
the skin.
"We wanted to make a product
that would not only cleanse the skin
and help prevent acne, but also one
that pampered the skin. Proactiv is
like taking Estee Lauder with Oxy or
a prescription acne medication and
putting them in a blender and mixing

them up," Fields said.
Rodan and Fields felt the acne
medications they prescribed were too
harsh, causing patients to use them as
spot treatments instead of all-over
the-face products.
"The patients didn't want to put
something all over their skin that was
too harsh, punishing, and smelled
bad. We recognized this so we tried to
make an acne medicine that would
actually pamper the skin," Kodan
said.
After inventing their product, the
two doctors needed a place to sell it.
Their original intent was to sell
Proactiv as a Neutrogena product,
hut when Johnson and Johnson
bought this company, Rodan and
Fields were lost in the shuffle. A Neu
trogena executive gave them the idea
to sell Proactiv themselves over in
fomercials, believing they were their
best advocates.
"1 couldn't believe he said in
fomereials. We were good girls with a
respectable product," Fields said. It
seemed odd to have Proactiv in an in
fomercial alongside other products
such as abdominal machines, knife
sets and the Psychic Friends Net
work.
But the two doctors took the risk
and had their infomercial produced
by(iuthy-Reinker,a marketing com
pany. The idea has been a huge suc
cess. and they now have many loyal
users of the product.
Today, Fields believes the in
fomercials have been the best thing
for their particular type of product.
"Proactiv needs the explanation

that goes along with it in order for it to
work the best. It is too complicated
for shelves," Fields said. They didn't
want people buying their product and
not getting the best results because
they didn't use it correctly.
The explanation that Fields is
speaking of is the three-step process
of Proactiv. First comes the oil-free
cleanser that contains benzoyl perox
ide to unclog pores as well as slough
off dead skin cells. Then the alcohol
free revitalizing toner rehydrates skin
and an exfoliant. Finally, the
repairing lotion, which also contains
benzoyl peroxide, is spread all over
the face. Fields and Rodan stress the
fact that all of these steps need to be
carried out in order for the product to
be successful.
And the product has been success
ful for many people, as seen in testi
monials on the infomercials and in
letters that are sent to Rodan and
Fields. Although the two understand
there is no cure for acne, they believe
their product can help clear up mild
to moderate acne problems, which
the majority of acne sufferers face.
Being able to reach so many people is
part of the reason why Rodan and
Fields decided to invent a product in
stead of just helping people in their
practices.
"You know, you go into medicine
to help people, but the big wow
comes when you hear thank you from
the people you've helped," Rodan
said. "With a practice you can help a
small lew, but with Proactiv we were
able to help thousands."
They have heard from all types of

customers, ranging from teenagers to
adults and have seen real results with
the product. Rodan and Fields be
lieve the best thing about the prod
uct's success is the increase in self
confidence in users.
"We have gotten letters from a
woman who had never even had a
boyfriend before, but then her acne
cleared up. Now she is engaged. We
also heard from a minister who was
afraid to stand in front of his congre
gation, but since his acne has cleared
he is no longer scared to stand in front
of people. We realize that acne is a
self-esteem issue," Rodan said.
Rodan and Fields hope to contin
ue getting this satisfaction from help
ing people, and they have grown
quite a friendship in all their years of
working together.
"I remember walking into med
school with my pink pumps and white
mini-skirt, straight from Florida, and
meeting Katy. For the two of us it has
been a blast working and traveling to
gether," Fields said. "It would be
lonely doing this on your own. We are
much more creative together."
The two continue to be creative as
they look to the future. They believe
that one day Proactiv may be ready
for retail, and they continue to invent
more facial products and medical de
vices. They are looking for the same
type of success they have found in
Proactiv.
"Staying focused and believing in
yourself is the mark of an entrepre
neur," Rodan said. "We were lucky
enough to change people's lives and
create a product we believe in."
