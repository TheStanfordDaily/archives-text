# New mock trial team successful at competition

Although the team may not aspire
to the short skirts of Ally Me√üeal, the
newly formed Mock Trial team en
dures almost as much courtroom
drama as the television lawyer does
on her show.
The Stanford team competes in
trials in a simulated courtroom set
ting with three attorneys and three
witnesses on each side.
"Its three hours of the most in
tense mental workout you're ever
going to get," explains team member
Marin McDonald, a freshman.
"You've never thought you could lis
ten so intently."
The team took Southern Califor
nia by storm this past weekend at the
Mock Trial Regional Competition

held in San Bcrnadino County.
The team placed third, defeating
teams from 16 different schools from
all over the West Coast and Arizona,
qualifying them to attend the Nation
al Tournament in April.
Defeated teams included IJCTA,
IJSC. Claremont-McKenna College
and UC'SD. The only schools that
placed higher than Stanford were
Arizona State University and Mount
San Antonio ('ollege.
"I was surprised by our perfor
mance, and at the same time I wasn't
surprised," said co-founder Ruby
Marquez, a sophomore. "We really
didn't go in with huge expectations,
we just wanted to do our best. It was
really a team effort, very grassroots."
Marquez and sophomore Katie
Young, who also act as the team

coaches, started the mock trial team
earlier this year. Nearly 40 students
competed for 1 6 spots at the team try
outs, which were held in early No
vember. It was one of four new teams
this year in the region, which covers
Arizona, California, Washington and
Oregon. Currently, the Stanford
Mock Trial Team is the only team in
Northern California.
"1 wanted to start a mock trial
team because I love the legal system
and wanted to share it with other peo
ple," explained Young.
In addition to their third place in
the competition, Stanford brought
home five of the 20 individual awards
given out in the competition. Sopho
more Emily Forrest, freshman Barry
Simon, freshman Bethel Otuteyeand
freshman Ciina Guarienti all won

outstanding attorney awards, and ju
nior Seema Shah took home an out
standing witness award.
"I was incredibly pleased," said
Otuteye. "It was my first time in the
courtroom so I was very happy."
Because of its status as a new stu
dent organization, the team has very
little money and few resources com
pared to its competitors. Many
schools have huge budgets for their
mock trial teams and hire profession
al attorneys to help coach their teams.
"I was very proud that we were
able to go to regionals and do so well,
considering our limited budget," said
Young.
Most of all, the trip to San
Bernadino for the regional competi
tion served to put the new team on
the map, said Forrest.
