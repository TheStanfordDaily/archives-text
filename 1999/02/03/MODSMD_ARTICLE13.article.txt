# Housing problems continue locally

In an attempt to address the
growing housing problems at Stan
ford and in surrounding Bay Area
communities, the Haas Center,
Stanford in Government and the
Civil Engineering Department
teamed up and hosted a panel to dis
cuss the issue.
The panel, titled "Bay Area
Housing Futures: Making Informed
Choices," was part of a series called
the South Bay Project, which exam
ines different issues in the local com
munity.
Targeted at the Stanford commu
nity, the panel was "aimed at bring
ing out greater awareness of issues
especially in the South Bay," said
Antoinette Laudencia, the South
Bay Project Coordinator for the
Haas Center.
Right now, nearly 50,000 workers
in the Bay Area commute from cities
as far away as Tracy and Stockton
to lack of affordable housing.
That number will rise to nearly
200,000 by the year 2020.
Stanford has its own set of hous
ing issues, most prominently its cur
rent inability to fill the housing de
mands of graduate students.
Last May, graduate students built
a tent-city in the Quad to demon
strate the need for more housing. In
November, Santa Clara County

Board of Supervisors member Joe
Simitian held a meeting to discuss
the planned three-phase graduate
housing proposal to add 480 more
units in Escondido Village. Simitian
was present at yesterday's panel.
Gary Binger, deputy executive
director and planning director of the
Association of Bay Area Govern
ments informed the audience that
the Bay Area has not been meeting
housing needs since 1990, due to the
large discrepancy between labor and
housing.
Dianne Spaulding, executive di
rector of the Non-Profit Housing
Association said that California has
the nation's second lowest home
ownership rate at only 55 percent,
due to the fact that the median home
sale price has risen to $318,000.
Renting is also a problem. With
the burden of such high rents, and
the one percent vacancy rates in the
Bay Area, "to rent a two-bedroom
apartment in California working on
minimum wage, you would have to
work 112 hours a week," said
Spaulding.
There are few solutions. Many
local communities oppose low-in
come housing. Much of the opposi
tion comes from the fear of lowered
land values, troubled schools and
heightened crime. The panel called
these issues "myths," and is working
to dispel them.
