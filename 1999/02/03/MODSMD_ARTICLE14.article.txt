Chavez inaugurated
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Seven years after trying to over
throw the government in a bloody coup attempt, former Lt. Col. Hugo
Chavez was sworn in as president yesterday and even managed to take
a swipe at the country's constitution while taking his oath.
The crowd in Caracas's congressional hall erupted into cheers
when Chavez, his right hand in the air and his left on the constitution,
broke with the traditional pledge repeated by every president during
40 years of democracy.
"I swear in front of my people that over this dying constitution I
will push forward the democratic transformations that are necessary
so that the new republic will have an adequate Magna Carta for the
times," he said.
Chavez contends Venezuela's current constitution is a product of
old-style patronage politics and says a new one is needed to overhaul
what he calls a corrupt political culture.
Heads of state and other dignitaries from 60 countries attended the
inauguration, among them Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who met with
Chavez into the wee hours of the morning.
Also attending the ceremony was Argentine President Carlos
Menem, Peruvian leader Alberto Fujimori and the U.S. representa
tive, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
Chavez's critics fear his call for a new constitution — and his
threats to dissolve Congress — will only concentrate power in his
hands. But the former army paratrooper insists he will bring "true
democracy" to Venezuela.
The Chavez presidency signals a wholesale break with traditional
politics in Venezuela, where until now two parties —the center-left
Democratic Action and center-right Copei - have alternated in power.
Chavez won a landslide victory on Dec. 6 by capitalizing on
Venezuelans' anger over corruption and declining living standards.
Most of the country's 23 million people live in poverty, even though
Venezuela — a founding member of OPEC — has the largest oil
reserves outside the Middle East.
Netanyahu supporters cause shouting match
JERUSALEM (AP) — A televised interview with two of Israel's
top candidates for prime minister descended into a catcalling shouting
match after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's loyalists turned on
the opposition candidate.
Was it political hooliganism, as Labor leader Ehud Barak main
tained yesterday — or, as Netanyahu claimed, a nod to his leadership
abilities?
The shenanigans Monday evening on the "Politika" talk show
dominated headlines and morning-after talk yesterday on Israeli radio
stations.
It also raised fears the political atmosphere in Israel is still rife with
violence 3 1/2 years after the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin by an opponent of his land-for-peace policies.
Uri Porath, director of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and a
Netanyahu appointee, said he would consider banning studio audi
ences from political talk shows until after the May 17 elections.
Yaakov Ahimeir, the veteran television reporter who moderated
the show, said he could barely conduct his interview with Barak
between the shouts and hisses of Netanyahu supporters in the crowd.
According to "Politika" producers, the bulk of the boos came from
an organized group of Netanyahu backers who heckled simultaneous
ly, sometimes even spitting. Their noise drowned out Barak's attempts
to respond.
In contrast, Netanyahu's reception had been warm. He left the stu
dio amid boos prompted by Ahimeir's announcement that Barak was
up next.
Netanyahu said he condemned political violence — but insisted
Monday's outbursts were simply a demonstration of the people's sup
port for him.
Carmi Gillon, who headed Israel's Shin Bet internal security agen
cy at the time of Rabin's assassination, said yesterday he believed
more political violence was possible.
Report finds live-ins more likely to divorce
NEW YORK (AP) — A growing body of research has found that
contrary to popular belief, peonle who live together before marriage
are more likely than other couples to divorce.
According to a report released this week from the National Mar
riage Project at Rutgers University, studies done over the past decade
found the same connection between living together before marriage
and splitting up after.
The hot question for marriage and family sociologists these days is
why.
Many researchers believe the reason is partly that people who live
together are more unconventional to begin with and are less commit
ted to the institution of marriage and more open to the possibility of
divorce.
The authors of the latest report suspect something more insidious
- that living together slowly erodes people's ability to commit and
their faith in the institution of marriage.
The project is nonpartisan but is funded by mainly conservative,
traditional family foundations.
Among the recent studies on cohabitation and marriage was one
released in 1997 by the National Center for Health Statistics. It
showed that 27 percent of women who lived with someone before get
ting married ended up divorced within five years. Ten percent of
women who never lived with a boyfriend saw their marriages dissolve
in the same period.
