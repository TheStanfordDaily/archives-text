# Kosovo rebels agree to peace talks

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) — Ethnic
Albanian rebels reluctantly agreed yesterday to
take part in weekend peace talks aimed at end
ing the bloody 11-month conflict in Kosovo — a
decision that focused international pressure on
the hard-line Yugoslav government.
Rebel participation had been thrown into
doubt after spokesman Adem Demaci recom
mended against sending delegates. However,
the main Kosovo Liberation Army spokesman,
Jakup Krasniqi, told reporters in central Kosovo
that the KLA would name its delegates today.
"We have some objections to the proposed
document, but we are certainly ready to go,"
Krasniqi said in comments welcomed by Clinton
administration officials.
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has
sent the matter over to the Serb Parliament,
which meets tomorrow, and resisted giving any
signal on whether the Serbs will send delegates
to the talks organized by the United States and
five European countries. The government has
been against any terms that would erode its con
trol over Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
Both sides face the threat of NATO strikes if
they haven't started talks by Saturday in Ram
bouillet, France, and reached a deal by Feb. 19
to end the conflict over Kosovo Albanians'
demand for independence.
More moderate Kosovo Albanian political
leaders already hive said they would attend, but
the key negotiating parties to any settlement are
Milosevic's government and the KLA, the war
ring parties in the conflict over ethnic Albani
ans' demand for independence.
Krasniqi said the KLA wants to send four
delegates as part of the ethnic Albanian negoti
ating team, expected to number about 15.
The proposed U.S. peace plan at the talks in
France would give Kosovo greater autonomy
for the first three years. Political parties would
decide what happens after that.
Krasniqi said KLA representatives will
demand that Kosovo become an international
protectorate for three years while negotiators
work out a final status for Kosovo. They also
want any decision on Kosovo's future to be put
to a referendum by the "people of Kosovo."
Ethnic Albanians are by far the majority
among the 2 million people of Kosovo, and most
want independence.
While deferring the question of participation
in the talks, the Yugoslav government appealed

to the U.N. Security Council to convene an
urgent meeting on Kosovo to prevent what it
called the "open and clear threat of aggression"
posed by NATO's threatened military strikes.
The NATO threat "directly undermines the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FRY
(Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) and flagrantly
violates the principles enshrined in the U.N.
Charter," Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic said in a letter to the council.
The council briefly discussed the request yes
terday but postponed any further action until
later in the week.
Despite the anti-NATO maneuvers, Dusko
Matkovic, a vice president of Milosevic's Social
ist Party, suggested in remarks published yester
day that the Serbs are likely to send their dele
gation to France.
He said NATO pressure "further strengthens
Serbian and Yugoslav resolve to find a peaceful
solution for Kosovo through negotiations."
The conflict between Kosovo separatists and
Serb and Yugoslav forces has killed at least
2,()(K) people, most of them civilians, and made
refugees out of hundreds of thousands.
Hundreds of people have been killed in con
tinuing violence since an October truce halted

most combat, including 45 ethnic Albanians
whose brutal slayings in Racak on Jan. 15
prompted renewed international calls lor peace
in Kosovo.
Survivors from Racak gathered yesterday
outside the morgue in Pristina yesterday to
demand Serbs release the Racak bodies for buri
al. The Serbs refused, and the villagers said they
wouldn't leave until they had all the corpses.
Meanwhile, the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center reported yesterday that two
villages in Kosovo's Drenica region and another
in the Podujevo region were shelled by heavy
Serb artillery overnight. There were no reports
of casualties.
Also yesterday, in what Serb officials called
the biggest weapons find ever inside Kosovo,
police seized nearly $6(X),(XM) worth of weapons,
ammunition and uniforms destined for ethnic
Albanian rebels.
The supplies were found under a false floor
in a 25-ton tractor-trailer near Kosovska Mitro
vica, a town 20 miles northwest of Pristina.
Police said they found papers inside the cab indi
cating the vehicle had entered Serbia from
Croatia on Monday. The uniforms included
labels of a factory in Bosnia.
