PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -
Abortion foes who created "want
ed" posters and a Web site listing
the names and addresses of "baby
butchers" were ordered to pay $107
million in damages yesterday by a
federal jury that said the tactics
amounted to illegal threats.
Planned Parenthood, several
abortion doctors and a clinic had
sued the activists under the U.S.
racketeering statute and a 1994 fed
eral law that makes it illegal to
incite violence against abortion doc
tors or their patients.
Unlike previous cases brought

under the 1994 law, this one did not
involve any physical confrontati ns
or explicit threats. Because of nit,
the anti-abortion activists contend
ed the Internet site and the posters
were protected by the First Amend
ment.
"The jury saw the posters for
what they are — a hit list for terror
ists," said Gloria Feldt, president of
Planned Parenthood.
The jury took 4 1/2 days to reach
its verdict, which consisted of $ 106.5
million in punitive damages and
$500,(KX) in compensatory damages.
As part of the tight security sur

rounding the case, the judge said
the names of the eight jurors will
never be made public.
The defendants, who included
more than a dozen individuals and
two anti-abortion organizations,
said they will appeal.
At issue was a Web site called
"The Nuremberg Files" that lists
hundreds of abortion doctors
accused of committing "crimes
against humanity" and invites read
ers to send in doctors' addresses,
license plate numbers and the
names of their children. When three
doctors were killed, their names

were crossed off like items on a gro
cery list.
During the three-week trial,
abortion doctors on the list testified
that they lived in constant fear, used
disguises, bodyguards and bullet
proof vests, and instructed their
children to crouch in the bathroom
if they heard gunfire.
The defendants maintained they
were simply political protesters col
lecting data on doctors in hopes of
one day putting them on trial as
Nazi war criminals were at Nurem
berg. They stressed that the materi
al contained no direct threats.
