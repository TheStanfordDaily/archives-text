# Antibiotics reduce risk of heart attacks
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) —People
who have taken two kinds of com
mon antibiotics are less likely to suf
fer heart attacks, according to a
study that bolsters the tantalizing
theory that infections may be an
important cause of heart disease.
Researchers were quick to
emphasize that people shouldn't
start taking antibiotics to prevent
heart attacks.
" This study is just another piece
of evidence in the puzzle," said Dr.
Hershel Jick, a Boston University
professor and author of the study,
published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
The known contributors to heart

attacks — such as high blood pres
sure, high blood cholesterol and
smoking — fail to account for many
cases, so doctors believe other caus
es are probably lurking.
One theory is that unseen infec
tions cause inflammation of the
heart arteries, allowing fatty
deposits to find a better foothold.
That may explain why aspirin is
so good at preventing heart attacks.
Besides interfering with blood clot
ting, aspirin relieves inflammation.
In this study, two types of antibi
otics — tetracyclines and quino
lones — were associated with a
lower risk of heart attack. Other
antibiotics — penicillins, macro

lides, sulfonamids and cephalos
porins— were not.
The findings make sense because
the germ suspected of causing heart
disease. Chlamydia pneumoniae, is
most vulnerable to tetracyclines and
quinolones, Jick said.
The bug — which is in the same
family as the bacteria that cause the
sexually transmitted disease chla
mydia — usually attacks the lungs,
causing illnesses ranging from mild
bronchitis to pneumonia. But many
people have the germ and aren't
sick.
To tease out the possible role of
infection, the researchers analyzed
the medical records of 3,315 British

patients who suffered heart attacks
but had no known risk factors for
heart disease. The researchers stud
ied Britons because their national
health system tracks all prescrip
tions and diagnoses.
Compared with 13,139 patients
who had never suffered heart
attacks, the heart-attack subjects
were only 70 percent as likely to
have taken tetracyclines and 45 per
cent as likely to have taken
quinolones in the past three years.
Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of
the American Heart Association,
said it is much to early to consider
prescribing antibiotics to people at
risk of a heart attack.
