Group's recommendations
for Draw and advising
lack necessary details

THE RESIDENTIAL Pro
grams Implementation
Group's report released yester
day was a mixed bag of positive and
vague suggestions that ineluded a
minor but important ehange to the
Draw, a call for student consideration
of a three-tiered Draw system and an
attempt to strengthen upperclass resi
dential advising. ITiough the group's
efforts to improve undergraduate life
are well-intentioned and welcome,
some of its proposals still need details.
We applaud the implementation
group for responding to student feed
back and adding a new option for
Draw groups starting this spring. This
will allow Draw groups to indicate a
preference for accepting a housing
choice lower on their list in order to
keep their group united.
Under the current system, split
Draw groups must file a petition for
reunification with Housing Assign
ment Services after Draw assignments
have been made, and there is no guar
antee that all groups can be brought
together. ITie new option will increase
the likelihood that Draw groups can
stay together and will allow students
to avoid the arduous petition process.
I"he implementation group's sur
veys and focus groups showed that
students are in favor of a more equi
table housing assignment system than
the current Draw, and the idea of a
three-tiered Draw was proposed.
Under this system, students would be
issued Draw numbers from one of
each tier (top, middle, low) and would
be able to choose which year to use
each tier. Students deciding to draw in
the "top" tier would receive lottery
numbers in the top third of the Draw
(meaning they would get low num
bers).
The implementation group's report
stated that while this system would
provide more equitable results than
the current Draw, it would be a chal
lenge to devise a transition plan and
the improvements to the Draw would

be "only marginal."
The report called for student input
on the three-tiered Draw proposal.
We agree with the implementation
group that more student feedback is
needed before a decision can be made
regarding this proposal for drastically
altering the current Draw. Student
input should not only address
whether a three-tiered system is desir
able, but also suggest ways that such a
change could be brought about
smoothly.
For example, how would the transi
tion handle juniors and seniors who
have already received Draw numbers
under the old system? What would
happen if a majority of students all
chose to use their top tier during the
same year?
The ASSU has agreed to take the
reins and oversee the gathering of stu
dent input. When this process is com
pleted, we will be able to determine
whether the costs associated with
shifting to a three-tiered Draw system
are worth its perceived benefits. We
appreciate the implementation
group's willingness to reserve judg
ment until students' opinions have
been properly solicited.
'ITie implementation group also
announced several new initiatives to
improve residence-based advising
that are geared toward the needs of
upperclass students. The needs identi
fied by the group include support for
honors work, assistance with declar
ing a major, career and graduate
school guidance and support for
returning overseas students.
Beginning next fall, a residential
Honors Program will be implemented
to support groups of honors students
living in the same area, along with
programs to build peer mentor rela
tionships and resource bases for
upperclass students.
The details for these programs
have not been completely hammered
out yet, and we need more specifics
before we can fully assess the value of
the changes. A stronger system of
upperclass academic advising and
mentoring would undoubtedly be
helpful and useful for students, how
ever. We wait, with anticipation for
further developments.
