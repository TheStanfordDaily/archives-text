} rrpis THE SEASON to get hired.
We have all seen the suits, unbe-
JL coming of college students,
adorning seniors in search of opportunity.
They walk around with strands of hair in
perfect formation and facial expressions
reflecting both excitement and nervous
ness.
Though 1 am still a little less than a year
away from having to go through this
ordeal, I am finding that no matter how
many classes I take or extracurricular
activities I do, nothing has really prepared
me for the daunting task of presenting
myself as an attractive job applicant.
Having tried to draft a resume on sever
al occasions without much success, I came
to the ego-crushing realization that I don't
look good on paper.
Is there something wrong with me? I
feel as though I've done a lot over the last
few years. So why does my life look as
exciting as the 24-hour study room on a
Friday night?
As one might imagine, my self-esteem
began to evaporate, and I eventually had
to remove it from my resume, making my
paper appearance even more unattractive.
Then, it hit me. I was doing a crossword
puzzle in class and 48-across read, "To
enhance." Nine letters, ending in "H." E-
M-B-E-L-L-l-S-H. As I filled in the boxes,
1 realized that I had found the key to
resume success. So simple, yet so true.
That night, 1 sat down and wrote my
whole resume with little difficulty, even
catching myself enjoying the process. I
think it my duty, as member of the Stan
ford community, to share my discovery
with my fellow students.
Here you will find examples of activities
and jobs which carry more responsibility

and importance than meet the eye.
Remember, personal results may vary....
Stanford Fund caller
Played a significant role in the national
media by working to raise my employer's
U.S. News and World Report ranking.
Helped facilitate the creation of a unique
environment combining sub-standard
working conditions with a high minimum
wage.
Dorm president
Chief executive of a corporation of 90
members. Supervised and directed the
allocation of funds for a host of recreation
al and charitable activities and events. Pur
chaser of goods essential to the corpora
tion's well-being. Presided over meetings
of the government and formulated appro
priate policy objectives.
Dining services consumer
Sampled international cuisine in a setting
fostering lively discussion and cama
raderie. Learned to pronounce "brioche"
and "disgusting." Participated in eco
nomics monopoly research.
Grapes voter
Participated in the democratic process
through a vote on whether to serve grapes
in my dining facility. Was able to engage in
a fruitful, educational debate outside of
the classroom on a subject about which 1
know very little. One of the most impor
tant and life-changing decisions of my col
lege career, maybe even my life.
Internet user
An expert in electronic communication.
Able to conduct all social interactions from
the privacy of my own room. Constant

exposure to the beauty and culture of the
World Wide Web. Lobbied Congress to
prevent regulation of explicit sites.
Republican
Embraced the challenges of college life as
a conservative minority on a progressive
campus. Kept my mouth shut as the more
absurd elements of my party voiced their
outrageous opinions in a ridiculous publi
cation, a constant reminder of why I was in
the minority.
Biker
Overcame congestive obstacles, daily navi
gating my way through uncontrolled traffic
without a helmet in pursuit of my academ
ic dreams. Built mental and physical
strength. Learned to look both ways for
police officers before running a stop sign.
Student
Studied under some of the best professors
in the country. Displayed a noble sense of
gratitude by buying their books. One of
only 800 students in my economics course.
Handled the pressures of midterms and
finals. Faced the fear of my first "B." Took
advantage of modern technology by video
taping several of my courses. Planned to
watch them.
We have all had unique experiences in
college, running the gamut from nothing to
everything. I have come to realize, as I
hope you have, that doing nothing can be
as exciting as doing everything if you just
put your mind to it. Good luck.

Adam Weiss is a junior majoring in eco
nomics and ASSU Senate Chair.
