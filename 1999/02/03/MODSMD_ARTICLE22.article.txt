## Students work hard but don't have passion 
### 
1 was annoyed, but not very surprised, to
read Tiy Martin's letter claiming that Larry
Beyer is unacquainted with Stanford
undergraduates. From Martin's letter, I'd
have to say that Beyer understands them all
too well.
In his recent letter. Beyer proposed to
eliminate Structured Liberal Education
and allow SLE students to mingle with the
rest of the student population in order to
bring some liveliness and passion to the
freshman Introduction to the Humanities/
Cultures, Ideas and Values requirement
that's often lacking in both.
Beyer claimed that many I-Hum/CIV

students care little about their course mate
rial and merely do the required work to get
by in the class, which is not far from the
truth.
Martin, in his attack, claims that Beyer
meant that Stanford students don't work
very hard in their I-Hum/CIV classes or
otherwise. And, that if he and his class
mates just wanted to "get by," they would
have low CPA's and go out and party all
the time.
Anyone who has walked around campus
on a Saturday night and claimed that Stan
ford students don't work hard, ignoring the
bright lights of computer screens in dorm

rooms and the prevalent silence of dedicat
ed scholars, would be hard-pressed to deny
our student body's work ethic.
Students here obviously don't strive for
"a perfect 2.0 GPA," or if they do, they
hide it very well.
We all do all that we can to get an "A,"
I-Hum / CIV classes included. But do we
really care about what we're learning?
This, I think, is what Beyer was getting
at. Sure, we work hard, but the monosyl
labic responses and tired grunts I remem
ber from some of my sections hardly illus
trate liveliness and intellectual passion.
Having never been in SLE, I don't know

if it is any different there. But Beyer's point
was that if SLE students really are excited
by what they're learning, maybe their dis
persal into non-SLE I-Hum / ClVclasses
will liven up some of those sections.
So, Tiy Martin, go ahead and keep your
priorities straight and get your good grades,
and I'll try and do the same.
But sometimes I wonder if intellectual
passion and real excitement about learning
might be worth a 2.0 GPA.
