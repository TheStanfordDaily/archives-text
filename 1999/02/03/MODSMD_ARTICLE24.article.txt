## Defeating the common cold 
### Joanne Wu Editorial staff 
These winter months may be the
time for fun activities such as ski
ing, snowboarding or splashing
puddles, but as temperatures plum
met, recreation can be ruined by
the dreaded disease — colds.
Beginning late August or early
September, the incidence of colds
increases slowly and remains high
until March or April. Seasonal
changes in humidity affect the
prevalence of colds, since the rhi
novirus, the most common cold
virus, survives best in low humidity.
In cold weather humidity is lower,
which makes nasal passages drier
and more vulnerable to infection.
Individuals in the United States
suffer one billion colds every year,
according to the National Institutes
of Health. More than 2(M) viruses
can cause the cold, eliciting
immune responses that create
symptoms of headaches, runny
noses and scratchy throats.
Many of these symptoms arise
from the effects of the immune sys
tem as it battles with the cold virus.
Specialized white blood cells
release chemicals such as kinins as
they attack the virus, which cause
swelling and inflammation of the
nasal lining, leakage of proteins
and fluid from capillaries and
lymph vessels, and the increased
production of mucus.
Colds can be spread by inhaling
infected respiratory secretions
from the air or by touching infec
tious secretions and then touching
the eyes or nose. The rhinovirus
can survive for three hours outside
the nasal passage, on objects and
skin.
Studies suggest that a person is
most likely to spread the rhinovirus
in the second to fourth day of infec
tion, when the amount of virus in
nasal secretions is highest. Using
aspirin to treat colds actually
increases the amount of virus in
nasal secretions, facilitating trans
mission of the cold more easily.
A cold usually persists from two
to 14 days, depending on the
strength of a person's immune sys
tem. Since viruses cause the cold,
antibiotics do not alleviate the situ
ation. A vaccine for the cold
remains unattainable since so many
forms of the cold occur.
Natural remedies that may ame
liorate discomforts and support the
immune system against the cold do
exist. For example, diet can be
adjusted by eating light foods at
frequent intervals and drinking at
least a half-cup of liquid every wak

ing hour. Vegetable and fruit juices
such as apple, apricot, beet, carrot,
citrus, grape and tomato are espe
cially beneficial. Mot soups and
beverages can also help relieve
sinus and chest congestion.
Garlic, containing allicin, is
effective against any bacterial com
plications that may accompany the
cold virus. Ingesting minced raw
garlic is a popular folk remedy for
colds. Spicv and hot foods can act
as decongestants by loosening
mucus secretions. Also, plenty of
calcium, iron and protein should be
consumed to bolster the produc
tion of antibodies.
Vitamin C has been proposed as
a treatment for colds as well.
Although more research is needed
to clearly establish its properties,
some studies show that vitamin C
increases the activity of white
blood cells, stimulating their move
ment as well as their ability to
destroy bacteria. A recent study
revealed the positive effect of vita

min C on natural killer cells, a pow
erful defender of the immune sys
tem. Though vitamin C might
reduce the severity or duration of
colds, it is important not to con
sume large quantities over a long
period of time because it can cause
severe diarrhea.
Steam inhalation has also been
used as a popular remedy for colds.
Breathing in steam moisturizes and
clears air passages and might also
make the nose unsuitably hot for
most cold viruses, which flourish in
normal nasal temperatures of 33
degrees Celsius. Although steam
therapy is not a proven cure, it does
temporarily relieve congestion.
Massage and nerve pressure
techniques which presumably work
against the cold also exist. To
relieve headaches, the head can be
massaged from the top to the hol
low at the base of the skull, and
across both eyebrows. Pressing the
jawbone just beneath the earlobes
and beneath the outer corners of

the mouth can likewise alleviate
symptoms.
For a runny nose, massages
should start from the point where
the eyebrows would meet above
the nose, to the bridge of the nose
and down to (he base of the nos
trils.
To calm sneezes, the same point
between the eyebrows should be
pressed, along with the area direct
ly under the center of the nose.
Massage pressure upon the back of
each wrist and the top of each foot
where it meets the ankle can stimu
late the immune system.
During cold season, stress
should be kept to a minimum, since
high levels of psychological stress
lower resistance to viral infections
by suppressing the immune system.
Although the common cold is
both persistent and prevalent in
these chilly months, proper care of
the body can go great lengths
toward warding off the virus or
speeding up its cure.
