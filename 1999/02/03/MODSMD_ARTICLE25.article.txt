# Novel healing ability found
## 
### Ryan Chuang Contributing writer 
In laboratories around the world,
scientists have long studied human
fibroblasts, cells that contribute to
the formation of connective tissue.
Researchers study these cells to elu
cidate many basic questions in biol
ogy such as the control of cell
growth and the cell cycle progres
sion.
Recently, Stanford researchers
utilizing DNA microchip technolo
gy came up with a new approach to
study such cells and discovered a
previously uncharacterized wound
healing response from the fibrob
lasts.
Dr. Vishwanath Iyer, a postdoc
toral fellow in the Department of
Biochemistry and lead author of the
published study, believes that scien
tists studying cell growth and cell
cycle progression will have to reex
amine their own results in response
to this discovery. "If someone sees a
response, it doesn't only tell them
how a cell responds to nutrients, but
also how it responds to an emergen
cy situation like a wound."
Scientists in the study used
serum, the liquid fraction of blood
that remains after blood clots, from
fetal cows to "feed" and to "starve"
the cultured fibroblasts in the labo
ratory.
Normal human fibroblasts
require growth factors found in
serum in order to grow and multiply
in the laboratory. In the absence of
this serum and its growth factors,
the human fibroblast cells enter into
a non-dividing, low metabolic activ
ity state called "G-zero." Addition
of serum or purified growth factors
to these "starved" cells allows the
fibroblasts to resume proliferation.
Researchers have used this process
of feeding and starving cells to study
dozens of genes.
Using revolutionary bio-chips in
a DNA microarray assay, Stanford
researchers were able to examine
the expression of approximately
8.6(H) human genes in the starved
fibroblast cells after "feeding" them
with serum.
They then tracked the gene
expression in these cells at 12 differ
ent time points, ranging from 15
minutes to 24 hours. Through the
simultaneous observation of such a
large number of genes, the scientists
could see different patterns of
expression.
Researchers then divided 517
genes whose expression changed

significantly in response to serum
stimulation into different clusters
based on similar expression pat
terns. As expected, scientists saw
changes in the expression of several
cell cycle genes but also found some
interesting, novel responses of some
known genes.
Another exciting result was the
discovery of over 200 previously
unknown genes expressed during
the fibroblast response to serum.
Some of these genes encode pro
teins that play a role in cell cycle
progression while others may func
tion in intercellular signaling.
The appearance of genes with
known roles in processes important
to a wound-healing response sur
prised the Stanford researchers.
In the starved fibroblasts, serum
stimulation activated many immune
system genes involved in forming
blood clots or scabs, recruiting other
immune system cells to a wound site
and forming new blood vessels and
tissue. This finding fits with the
physiological role of fibroblasts. In
the body, these cells would
encounter serum only when they
leak into a tissue surrounding a
wound.
"It shows that fibroblasts carry
out this genetic program in a very
faithful way even though separated
from other cells present in a real
wound," Iyer said. "We've always
thought of serum as food, but in
reality it's a very specific signal that
there's something drastic going on."
This study not only shows fibrob
lasts' role in wound healing, but it
also dramatically demonstrates the
power of a genome-wide analysis
possible through the new DNA
microarray technology.
According to Patrick Brown, a
Howard Hughes Medical Institute
investigator in the Biochemistry
Department and senior author of
the fibroblast study, "One of the
defining characteristics of genome
scale expression profiling experi
ments is that the examination of so
many diverse genes opens a window
on all the processes that actually
occur, and not merely the single
process initially under observation."
Such analyses will surely result in
many important and exciting dis
coveries in the future essential to
understanding current mysteries in
biology.
