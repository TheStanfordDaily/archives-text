# New findings may guide search for epilepsy drugs
## Electrical rhythms in the brain elucidate causes behind epilepsy 
### Greg Miller Contributing writer 
A reccnt study by Stanford researchers may
provide valuable insights into the mechanisms
underlying certain types of epilepsy.
The current thinking on epilepsy, said Assoc.
Neurology Prof. John Uuguenard. senior author
of the study, holds that seizures occur when the
normal rhythmic electrical activity of the brain
goes out of control and large regions of the brain
become synchronously active. I bis abnormal
synchronization is called "hypersynchrony."
"There are a variety of rhythmic electrical
activities in the [cerebral] cortex that are associ
ated with different functions, such as attention,
sleep and memory consolidation." Uuguenard
said. "These activities have the potential to
become hypersynch ron ized."
Rhythmic patterns of activity are normally
most prevalent during sleep. During slow-wave
sleep, for example, electroencephalogram
(EEG) electrodes placed on the scalp record syn
chronized bursts of electrical activity that are not
seen during wakefulness.
Rhythmic activity is also a hallmark of epilep
tic seizures. In individuals with absence or petit
mal epilepsy, EEG recordings made during a
seizure show a pattern quite similar to that seen
in slow-wave sleep. During an absence seizure,
individuals go into a trance-like state and
become unresponsive and unaware of their sur
roundings.
Synchronized activity is not generated by the
cortex itself. Huguenard said, but by the thala
mus, a structure buried deep inside the brain. A

subdivision of the thalamus called the reticular
nucleus is believed to play a particularly impor
tant role in the synchronization of brain activity
by providing inhibitory input to the rest of the
thalamus.
In the current study. Huguenard and his col
leagues used a genetically engineered "knockout
mouse" to show that disrupting the inhibitory
influence of the reticular nucleus can alter the
synchronization of brain activity.
"A knockout mouse," explained Molly
Huntsman, a postdoctoral fellow and the prima
ry author of the study, "is missing one gene out
of its genome. They're bred to be missing that
gene in particular."
The mice Huntsman used were missing a gene
that encodes one specific subunit of a receptor
for an important inhibitory neurotransmitter
called GABA.
GABA receptors are complex proteins that
are incorporated into the membrane of brain
cells. The receptors are composed of several dif
ferent subunits (typically, two alpha subunits,
two beta subunits and one gamma subunit), and
each subunit exists in several different forms.
The knockout mice were missing a form of the
beta subunit called beta-3 that is "localized to a
number of different brain regions â€” localized to
the reticular nucleus, but absent in the rest of the
thalamus," Huntsman said.
Moreover, while GABA receptors in most
parts of the brain contain beta subunits of sever
al different forms, most GABA receptors in the
reticular nucleus contain only the beta-3 subunit.
Thus, the beta-3 knockout mice provided a
perfect opportunity to examine the effects of

removing the inhibitory influence of the reticular
nucleus.
Huntsman and Darrell Porcello. a neuro
science doctoral student, used microelectrodes to
examine the electrical activity of ultra-thin slices
of brain tissue from normal and knockout mice.
In the beta-3 knockout mice, they found that
inhibition in the reticular nucleus was dramati
cally reduced.
In addition. Huntsman and Porcello found
that when they stimulated the inputs to the retic
ular nucleus, the brain slices from the knockout
mice had much more synchronized activity than
did the slices from normal mice.
In brain slices from normal mice, Huguenard
explained, oscillations "are not well orchestrat
ed." However, without the inhibition provided
by the reticular nucleus, the oscillations became
much more synchronous.
"I like to think of this finding as demonstrat
ing a built-in desynchronizing mechanism [that]
brains have," Huguenard said. The idea that our
brains "may need systems in place to prevent
hypersvnehrony" is the contribution made by
this study, Huguenard added.
The inhibition provided by the reticular
nucleus may be one such system.
In addition to abnormally synchronized elec
trical activity, the beta-3 knockout mice also
exhibited behavioral symptoms similar to those
of absence epilepsy.
Epilepsy is the most common neurological
disorder, affecting one out of every hundred peo
ple, Huguenard said. He hopes that the current
findings will help guide the search for drugs that
can be used for treatment.
