## Ruggers blow out Davis 
### Chuck Gates 
Saturday, Stanford Rugby re
turned to old form as both the men
and women strongly defeated the
Aggies from UC-Davis.
In the afternoon game the Cardi
nal men (1-2) came out strong to
avoid becoming the first team to go
0-3 in head coach Franck Boivert's
history at Stanford, winning 34-5.
After an uncommon two-game
losing streak, Boivert turned to his
good friend, men's soccer coach
Bobby Clark, for some advice.
"Bobby said to make practice
fun," Boivert said. So Boivert decid
ed to loosen up and enjoy the week.
And it paid off.
According to Stanford players,
ball control was an area of emphasis
in practice last week. The Cardinal
has struggled this year with numer
ous turnovers by the inexperienced
team.
"Ball-handling was definitely the
key with our concentration in prac
tice," said junior kicker and team
president Jackson Wagener.
"We set the tone that week in
practice," added team captain Steve
Preonas. "We were not going to
drop the ball."
Concentration and enjoyment in
practice led to success. The Cardinal
seemed like a team of experts as its
passes were near perfect against the
bigger and higher-ranked Aggies.
" The big difference between this
weekend and last weekend was our
execution and we played our hard
est," Wagener said. "We also
changed our lineup around, which
helped us do more things."
Boivert made some lineup
changes for Saturday's game, which
resulted in surprise performances by
almost every player.
"I don't like to single out individ
uals," Boivert said. "This was a team
effort."
Specifically, Boivert said that the
team worked well on the lineouts.
"As opposed to the other games.
