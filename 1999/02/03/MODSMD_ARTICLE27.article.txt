## Ruggers blow out Davis 
### Chuck Gates 
Saturday, Stanford Rugby re
turned to old form as both the men
and women strongly defeated the
Aggies from UC-Davis.
In the afternoon game the Cardi
nal men (1-2) came out strong to
avoid becoming the first team to go
0-3 in head coach Franck Boivert's
history at Stanford, winning 34-5.
After an uncommon two-game
losing streak, Boivert turned to his
good friend, men's soccer coach
Bobby Clark, for some advice.
"Bobby said to make practice
fun," Boivert said. So Boivert decid
ed to loosen up and enjoy the week.
And it paid off.
According to Stanford players,
ball control was an area of emphasis
in practice last week. The Cardinal
has struggled this year with numer
ous turnovers by the inexperienced
team.
"Ball-handling was definitely the
key with our concentration in prac
tice," said junior kicker and team
president Jackson Wagener.
"We set the tone that week in
practice," added team captain Steve
Preonas. "We were not going to
drop the ball."
Concentration and enjoyment in
practice led to success. The Cardinal
seemed like a team of experts as its
passes were near perfect against the
bigger and higher-ranked Aggies.
" The big difference between this
weekend and last weekend was our
execution and we played our hard
est," Wagener said. "We also
changed our lineup around, which
helped us do more things."
Boivert made some lineup
changes for Saturday's game, which
resulted in surprise performances by
almost every player.
"I don't like to single out individ
uals," Boivert said. "This was a team
effort."
Specifically, Boivert said that the
team worked well on the lineouts.
"As opposed to the other games.
we really dominated the line outs,"
Boivert said. "We may have won the
game on the line outs."
The game started out as a defen
sive battle. But when Stanford was
first to score late in the first half, it
seemed the team's confidence multi
plied into a handful of points.
Ahead 10-0 after the first half, the
team came out firing in the second.
After two more scores, the Cardinal
was up 24-5 late in the second half.
"They got a bit demoralized," said
Freonas as he pointed out a letdown
in the Aggies' performance late in the
game.
The Stanford women dominated
their match, defeating Davis 67-0. Fu
eled by a mediocre showing at Ari
zona State last weekend, the women
looked to gain strength this week.
"1 think a lot of it had to do with
mentality," said team president Lara
Strauss. "We knew we messed up a
bit [against ASUJ. We were looking
to play together as a team."
Flaying as a team was a key to the
success this weekend as the Cardinal
scored 13 tries against a supposedly
difficult Aggie team.
The scoring was lead by Melody
Peterson, a recent addition to the

team. Added to the roster only two
weeks ago, Peterson did not know
many of the rules to the game. That
did not impede her as she scored six
tries in her debut.
The women ruggers seemed to
prove that, in rugby, the best defense
is an incredible offense. For most of
the game the ball remained deep in
Davis territory as the relentless Car
dinal turned nearly every Aggie
turnover into another score.
Perhaps the only part of the

women's play that was not superb
was the kicking. Stanford made only
one of its conversion kicks.
"It felt really good to have a game
like that," Landsittel said. "It was a
big boost to our team heading into
league play."
This weekend both squads will
make the long bus trip to Humboldt
University in Northern California.
The eight-hour bus ride combined
with a poor playing field and notori
ous home town referees make Hum

boldt a very difficult team to heat.
"It presents a tremendous amount
of adversity to a team." said Preonas.
"They are a relentless, physical team.
Humboldt fields strong teams for
both the women's and the men's
sides.
"We expect [them] to be one of
our main competitors." said Landsit
tel. "We really don't want to make
any assumptions about Humboldt
and assume that it's going to be an
easy game."
