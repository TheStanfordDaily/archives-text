# No. 4 men's hoops to face Bears
## Cal falls to seventh in conference 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
There are more reasons than ever for the
No. 4 Stanford men's basketball team to look
past tonight's game at California.
The Golden Bears (12-7,3-6 Pacific 10 Con
ference) have struggled recently and dropped
to seventh in the Pac-10 after being swept by
the Arizona schools last weekend.
And perhaps more importantly, Stanford
(18-3,8-1) is preparing to host No. 1 Connecti
cut on Saturday at Maples Pavilion.
But don't kid yourself.
The chances this year's veteran squad will
look past the Golden Bears tonight are little to
none.
For one thing, it is Cal — the Cardinal's
arch-rival from across the Bay. For another,
Stanford is clinging to a one-game lead in the
conference through the first half of the Pac-10
schedule and recognizes the importance of
every conference game.
" The fact is that it is Cal and Stanford,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We know we're going to have to go over there
and execute and do a good job defensively. We
have to get in a mindset that we are going to
have to play our best basketball."
Just a month ago, the Golden Bears came
into Maples Pavilion fresh off a win against
then-No. 9 North Carolina, and gave Stanford
a real scare. Cal led at halftime and had sever
al opportunities in the second half to put the
Cardinal in a serious hole. The Bears were un
able to convert on those chances, however, and
Stanford rode its composure, experience and
home-court advantage to a 71-62 victory.
At that point in the season, Cal appeared to
be a serious contender for the Pac-10 title, or at
the very least, one of the top three or four
teams in conference.
Since then, the Bears have gone 2-4 in Pac
-10 play are in a precarious position, needing a
strong second half to secure a postseason
berth.
Stanford seems to understand all that the
game means to the Bears. Meanwhile, the Car
dinal has plenty to play for itself.
"If being on top of the league isn't motiva
tion enough, you're in the wrong business,"
Montgomery said. "We should be fighting for
our lives every night.
In an attempt to solve his team's recent
woes, Cal head coach Ben Braun has tinkered
with his starting lineup over the past couple
weeks. The most recent starting five included
freshman Solomon Hughes at center and

sophomore Sean Lampley getting the nod at
forward.
Despite the shakeup in the frontcourt for
the Bears, one thing remains constant — the
offense feeds off the play of a dynamic back
court duo, seniors Geno Carlisle and Thomas
Kilgore.
And while some critics point to the Bears'
lack of a true point guard, Montgomery does
not think that is a real factor.

Conference) at California (12-7, 3-6), 7:30 pm.

"Certainly Carlisle and Kilgore are good
enough ball-handlers, and they both are scor
ers," Montgomery said. "So they've got real
good guards. Carlisle started the year running
the point and now Kilgore is back to playing
the point and Carlisle is at the off-guard. But
really, it's not that important because once
they run their offense it turns into a motion."
Montgomery, meanwhile, gave his team
Monday off to give some much-needed rest to
a squad whose depth eroded early in the sea
son.
The team's depth "is not very good, consid
ering what we started with," Montgomery
said. "With Mendy [junior forward Ryan
Mendez] out, [senior forward Peter] Sauer's
gotten some more minutes and hasn't been as
sharp as maybe he would have been going in
and out. Our depth is sufficient, but it isn't the
same."
The player who has been most affected by
the lack of depth on the bench is senior point
guard Arthur Lee. With sophomore Mike Mc-
Donald just returning from an injury and
freshman backup Tony Giovacchini not fully
prepared for extended minutes in big-time
games, Lee has gotten negligible time on the
bench.
"Art didn't shoot the ball very well on ei
ther occasion [in Arizona]," Montgomery said.
"That is a temporary thing as much as any
thing. In all fairness, we need to get him some
more time on the bench."
McDonald played 10 minutes against Ari
zona and seems ready to provide Lee with
some much-needed relief off the bench.
"Mike is not very experienced, since he
missed his senior year of high school and most
of this year," Montgomery said. "He needs to
show he can fight through tough screens and
play tough defense. And he can do all those

things."
Nonetheless, Stanford's senior-heavy starl
ing five has responded with grit and determi
nation, coming up with consistently clutch
play. Sauer and senior guard Kris Weems have
hit big shots, while senior center Tim Young
has been quietly solid in the post.

Most importantly, Stanford must come out
focused and prepared to battle on the road
with the Golden Bears.
"It is the second half ol the league schedule
and we have a one-game lead." Montgomery
said. "This Cal game is extremely important
for us with the way the league is shaping up."
