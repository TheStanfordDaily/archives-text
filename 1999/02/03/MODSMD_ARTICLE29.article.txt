# Freshman Yamasaki leads on, off the court
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
The gir! in the shirt emblazoned with "Yamasaki"
was cautious in her approach to the storied Stanford
women's basketball team. She went to all the games but
stood quietly on the sidelines, wearing her number 25.
Around the players she smiled shyly, holding back her
words and emotions in awe of those around her.

In other words, the young fan was the antithesis of her
heroine, freshman basketball phenom Lindsey Yamasa
ki.
Though Yamasaki is new to the team, she is anything
but shy. She has taken the Cardinal by storm this year,
leading the team with an average of 14.2 points per game.
She took over a starting role in the first month of the sea
son, and has risen to tie sophomore Carolyn Moos for the
team lead in rebounds and to trail only point guard Mile
na Flores in assists and minutes.
"Being a starter there's that extra pressure on you,
and I had to become a natural leader, at least on the
floor," Yamasaki said.
She has been a leader off the court as well as on, un
deterred by her freshman status from being a strong
voice in the locker room.
"If I'm going to say something to someone, I'll say it,
no matter what year they are," she said.
As one of a small number of Asian-American top-tier
basketball players, Yamasaki has additional incentive to
take a leading role both on the court and off.
"When I was growing up, I slowly started seeing that
there weren't many other Asian Americans playing,"
she said. "I'm unique in that sense."
Yamasaki's go-getter attitude is not surprising, con
sidering her athletic family background.
"My whole family is very sports-oriented," she said.
"My brother and sister are in athletics: My sister played
volleyball and softball and my brother plays baseball—
My mom was a surfer girl at Long Beach State and my
dad played volleyball at Fresno State."
Her brother, in fact, might be one of the few people
who can give her a tough game in basketball. "He's real
ly good I'm not sure who'd win."
However, Yamasaki calls volleyball, not basketball,
the "family game." She has fulfilled that part of the fam
ily destiny as well, winning the Oregon State Gatorade
Player of the Year Award in volleyball as well as basket
ball as a senior.
She was recruited to Stanford to play both sports, but
redshirted volleyball this year to concentrate on basket-

Freshman Lindsay Yamasaki has taken an active
role in Cardinal basketball. Yamasaki is second
only to point guard Milena Flores in assists and
minutes and is tied for the team lead in rebounds.
ball.
She hasn't yet decided whether
she'll play volleyball next year, say
ing, "it's all up in the air — we'll see in
the spring."
Yamasaki has appreciated the op
portunity to concentrate fully on bas
ketball this year.
"I got to learn all the plays and
start the season on time," something
that would have been hampered by
play on the volleyball team, which
finishes its season in December, after
the basketball team has begun play.
Those first two months of the bas
ketball season were a breakout peri
od for Yamasaki, who surprised even
herself with double-figure points in
her first two games against ranked
opponents Arkansas and Duke.
"When 1 came to the team I didn't
know what to expect;" she said.
Those first two games, both losses,
were a taste of what was to come for
the team, which stumbled early and
only recently climbed above the .S(K)
mark despite Yamasaki's strong play.
"It's been hard," Yamasaki said.
"I only lost about five games in high
school, so it's been tough to get used
to."
The team did have several early

season highlights, including an upset
of then-No. 1 Purdue, a game in
which Yamasaki scored 18 points and
pulled down nine rebounds.
"That was such a fun game," Ya
masaki said. "We were on our game,
and it proved to us what we can do."
After the game,' Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer praised Ya
masaki's contribution, saying, "1
think Lindsey had a great game. I
think she really showed people her
abilities, her skills and her poise."
One of Yamasaki's personal high
points was playing in front of family
and friends when the team played at
Oregon State and Oregon.
"It was exciting seeing my family,
but I might have played a little better
without the pressure," said Yamasa
ki. who notched only one point in the
first half but picked up the pace in the
second half to finish with 11 in the win
over Oregon State.
The team has shown recent signs
of improvement, with a 7-2 record in
the Pacific 10 Conference and a four
game win streak. Yamasaki has high
hopes for the young team that sports
five freshman and four sophomores.
"We have spurts of marvelous
play where we can beat anyone, but
we're very inexperienced," she said.
"If we play like we can play, our team
can do a lot. I can't say we'll win it all,
but we'll see."
