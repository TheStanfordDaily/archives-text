# Freshman Yamasaki leads on, off the court
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
The gir! in the shirt emblazoned with "Yamasaki"
was cautious in her approach to the storied Stanford
women's basketball team. She went to all the games but
stood quietly on the sidelines, wearing her number 25.
Around the players she smiled shyly, holding back her
words and emotions in awe of those around her.

In other words, the young fan was the antithesis of her
heroine, freshman basketball phenom Lindsey Yamasa
ki.
Though Yamasaki is new to the team, she is anything
but shy. She has taken the Cardinal by storm this year,
leading the team with an average of 14.2 points per game.
She took over a starting role in the first month of the sea
son, and has risen to tie sophomore Carolyn Moos for the
team lead in rebounds and to trail only point guard Mile
na Flores in assists and minutes.
"Being a starter there's that extra pressure on you,
and I had to become a natural leader, at least on the
floor," Yamasaki said.
She has been a leader off the court as well as on, un
deterred by her freshman status from being a strong
voice in the locker room.
"If I'm going to say something to someone, I'll say it,
no matter what year they are," she said.
As one of a small number of Asian-American top-tier
basketball players, Yamasaki has additional incentive to
take a leading role both on the court and off.
"When I was growing up, I slowly started seeing that
there weren't many other Asian Americans playing,"
she said. "I'm unique in that sense."
Yamasaki's go-getter attitude is not surprising, con
sidering her athletic family background.
"My whole family is very sports-oriented," she said.
"My brother and sister are in athletics: My sister played
volleyball and softball and my brother plays baseball—
My mom was a surfer girl at Long Beach State and my
dad played volleyball at Fresno State."
Her brother, in fact, might be one of the few people
who can give her a tough game in basketball. "He's real
ly good I'm not sure who'd win."
However, Yamasaki calls volleyball, not basketball,
the "family game." She has fulfilled that part of the fam
ily destiny as well, winning the Oregon State Gatorade
Player of the Year Award in volleyball as well as basket
ball as a senior.
She was recruited to Stanford to play both sports, but
redshirted volleyball this year to concentrate on basket-
