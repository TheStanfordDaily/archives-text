# Minor changes to occur in Draw, advising
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
The Residential Program Im
plementation Group announced a
minor change to the draw as well as
new upperclass advising initiatives
yesterday.
Under the new system, if a Draw
group does not all fit in a higher
housing choice, it can choose to stay
together and be placed in a lower
housing choice. Currently, if only

part of a Draw group fits into one of
its top housing choices, the group
will be split between two or more
residences.
"Over the years we have heard
from Draw groups that they'd
rather drop to a lower number on
their list than be split up," said
Kathleen Bransfield, manager of
housing assignment services.
She notes, however, that "be
cause the assignments for men and
women are done separately, Draw

groups may still get split between
men and women."
The implementation group held
off on approving a proposal to run a
three-tiered Draw. The proposal
would give students a chance to be
among the approximate top third of
all Draw groups during one of three
years, while being delegated to the
approximate middle third in anoth
er year and forced to draw in the
bottom third during the remaining
year of guaranteed housing.

"It does not make sense to move
forward if the new system is not em
braced by students and the transi
tion plan is not embraced by stu
dents," said James Montoya, vice
provost for student affairs. "I be
lieve there is a comfort level with
the three-tiered system, but a dis
comfort with the transition plan."
"I've asked [ASSU President!
Maren [Norton] to use the ASSU
Web site to got student impact," he
siiid. "It needs to he decided upon
before this year's Draw because
once we have the decision made, we
can get the transition plan articulat
ed."
The upperclass advising changes
are designed to bring several advis
ing programs, including honors pro
grams and graduate student mentor

ing, into the residences.
"We're making a commitment to
strengthening the academic support
we offer upperclass men and women
in the residences," Montoya said.
"We want them to know it's not just
about freshmen and sophomores."
The programming will also in
clude workshops on applying for re
search grants and writing personal
statements and an increased infor
mation and resource base in each
residence.
According to Montoya, the loca

lion of the residential programming
will depend on the living situations
of students needing those services.
I le will wait until after this spring's
Draw to decide on the exact nature
and location of the programs.
"In certain areas, like the Suites,
the Row, fraternities and sororities,
it might make more sense than oth
ers." Montoya said. " The programs
will probably be in areas that have
less faculty interaction under our
current Residential Education
structure."
