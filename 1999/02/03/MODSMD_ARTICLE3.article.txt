# Minor changes to occur in Draw, advising
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
The Residential Program Im
plementation Group announced a
minor change to the draw as well as
new upperclass advising initiatives
yesterday.
Under the new system, if a Draw
group does not all fit in a higher
housing choice, it can choose to stay
together and be placed in a lower
housing choice. Currently, if only

part of a Draw group fits into one of
its top housing choices, the group
will be split between two or more
residences.
"Over the years we have heard
from Draw groups that they'd
rather drop to a lower number on
their list than be split up," said
Kathleen Bransfield, manager of
housing assignment services.
She notes, however, that "be
cause the assignments for men and
women are done separately, Draw

groups may still get split between
men and women."
The implementation group held
off on approving a proposal to run a
three-tiered Draw. The proposal
would give students a chance to be
among the approximate top third of
all Draw groups during one of three
years, while being delegated to the
approximate middle third in anoth
er year and forced to draw in the
bottom third during the remaining
year of guaranteed housing.

"It does not make sense to move
forward if the new system is not em
braced by students and the transi
tion plan is not embraced by stu
dents," said James Montoya, vice
provost for student affairs. "I be
lieve there is a comfort level with
the three-tiered system, but a dis
comfort with the transition plan."
