## 
### Michaela Crouch Editorial staff 
Prior to Saturday night's Cardi
nal Open, the Stanford men's gym
nastics team had not defeated Cali
fornia in the two school's last 15
meetings and the Bears had not lost
a regular-season competition in al
most three years, a streak of 48
meets.
At the end of the evening, the
Cardinal had bested Cal. the 1998
NCAA champions, who had defeat
ed Stanford just three weeks ago by
a score of 214.8-211.9

■ Saturday: Cardinal Open — Stan
ford 215.15, California 213.40, UC
Santa Barbara 208.(X).

Stanford's winning score was
215.15, nearly two points over Cal's
final team total. UC-Santa Barbara
finished a distant third, posting only
208.
"I'm very pleased with the team,
especially because a lot of athletes
were sick the week before and still
competed," said Stanford assistant
coach Kyle Asano.
The Cardinal's performance at
the meet was significantly better
than at its last meet, also with the
Bears, on Jan. 8.
"Everyone caught at least one re
lease on the high bar," said Stanford
sophomore Ricardo Andrade,
"which was very different than our
last meet."
While Stanford took top honors
in the team competition, Cal senior
co-captain Alex Nissen took the all
around title. Stanford junior Jason
Katsampes, who had been sick all
week and unable to practice, took

second in the all-around competi
tion. Freshman Adam Berkenbile
rounded out the top three.
"I'm very proud of our team
unity and the way that everybody
supported each other," Asano said.
Because Stanford head coach
Sadao Hamada wants the Cardinal
to be at its best at the end of the sea
son, a strategy that many other
NCAA coaches do not share, Stan
ford gymnasts are currently per
forming more difficult skills than
most of their NCAA competitors.

The meet, however, did not begin
well for the Cardinal. During the
first event, the floor exercise, senior
captain Scott Finkelstein sprained
his ankle forcing him to scratch him
from the rest of the meet. Finkel
stein will likely be out for at least two
weeks.
On a positive note for the Cardi
nal, freshman David Durante is ex
pected to return to the squad this
week, following knee surgery, and is
should contribute quite a few points
to Stanford's totals.
