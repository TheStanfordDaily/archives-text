The creation of a new Freshman-
Sophomore Residential ( ollege con
tinues a Stanford trend toward
strengthening ties between faculty
and students early in their academic
careers.
Within the past few years, expan
sion of Stanford Introductory Studies
has provided numerous options for
students exploring their academic in
terests to develop a relationship with
faculty.
"This isn't simply a blind experi
ment," said Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ramon Saldf
var. "We're taking the best prac
tices. . .learned from Sophomore
•College.. .Freshman Seminars...
■Sophomore Seminars," he said.
Despite the growth of such pro
grams, many students still go through
their four years without really getting
to know faculty members.
Materials Science Prof. John
Bravman, the new dean of the col
lege, knows the situation first hand.
He admitted that when he was a
student at Stanford, he did not devel
op a bond with faculty and spoke of
liovv he is now often forced to write
recommendations "based on a piece
of paper."
Bravman is senior associate dean
of engineering and earned three de
grees from Stanford during thel97os
and 1980s.

"We have to start earlier on and
bring students and faculty together
more regularly," said Bravman, who
will live in a house near Sterling
Quad.
Residential colleges are standard
at other schools such as Harvard,
Princeton, Cambridge and Oxford
Universities.
At Princeton, for example, all
freshman and sophomores live in one
of five residential colleges. A senior
faculty member, known as Master,
lives in a nearby home and supervises
the college.
Princeton Prof. John Ciager has
been Master of Forbes College for
the past seven years, a position simi
lar to what Bravman will hold. Gager
said that he thought he had seen an
increase in faculty/ student interac
tion since the implementation of the
colleges in the early 1980s.
"It's still not an easy thing to pull
off," he warned. "I hope the people at
Stanford won't say.. .that merely by
creation of the institution that contact
will increase... I hope they give
thought on how to do it."
This task falls largely on the shoul
ders of Bravman, who downplayed
the relevance of the Princeton system
to Stanford.
"We're not trying to ape anyone,"
Bravman said. "I find a lot of issues
are so specific to the institution.
"We're making this up in real
time," he said, explaining that many
specifics regarding the house had not

yet been decided.
Early plans call for the college to
work with the Introduction to the
Humanities program. Freshman
Seminars and Sophomore Seminars
and Dialogues to create seminars
held in the college. The seminars will
be open to non-residents of the col
lege.
The new college at Stanford will
place a high priority on advising stu
dents and be "first and foremost for
students not certain.. .about their ca
reer path," according to Bravman.
Focus on improving the educa
tional experience for first and second
year students has increased dramati
cally since the announcement of the
Stanford Introductory Studies initia
tive in 19%.
Sophomore College began in the
summer of 1995 and provided much
of the impetus for SIS. About 50 stu
dents were selected from a pool of
2(X) applicants for the inaugural pro
gram. Those students arrived on
campus three weeks before fall quar
ter to attend classes in a diverse range
of subjects. Sophomore Seminars
and Dialogues also began in 1995.
Student interest in the programs
has kept University officials scram
bling to keep up with the demand.
Last month the University an
nounced Sophomore College would
be expanded yet again, with slots
opened for 420 students in 35 semi
nars. Last year more than 7(X) appli
cations were received for 324 spots.
