Stressing the importance of re
structuring education, Kwame Yao
Anku, Class of '94, questioned last
night why the educational system
has created a sense of inferiority in
blacks.
Auku presented a speech titled
•"Malcolm, Martin, and the 21st (en
tury Black Consciousness" to about
• 1(H) people in Kresge Auditorium
yesterday evening.
The program is the first in a series
;put on hy the Black Liberation
;( ommittee in celebration of Black
Liberation Month. It began with
Ihree individuals dressed in black
entering the stage from each direc
tion holding candles while positive
messages were broadcast over the
•sound system, such as "Be courte
ous" and "Obey the law."
Anku utilized multi-sensory
techniques through the program, in
cludinu a candle-lit seance and

movie excerpts, to convey his mes
sage.
I Jrging his listeners to never give
up and to realize their potential,
Anku saitl that his purpose was to
"make you [the student | realize your
position in the intellectual and ac
tivist world."
In an interview, Anku said, "I
think students should rccogni/e
their role in history - just because
it's not Vietnam or a civil rights
movement doesn't mean you should
he politically and socially inactive."
He considers Malcolm X and
Martin Luther King, Jr. to he vision
aries and "two very powerful ener
gies" with futuristic views. If these
futuristic views were out of place 30
years ago, "maybe what they were
saying was for us," said Anku.
The program included a film and
video vignette session featuring clips
of speeches by both Malcolm X and
King, a question and answer session
and two musical performances.

After the presentation, there was a
reception at Casa Zapata for more
questions.
Anku has been speaking to stu
dents since he graduated. An
African-American Studies major,
Anku directed his senior honors the
sis film titled, "Black Mind. White
Lines: Miseducation of the Human."
The film, which was a fictional docu
mentary of student reaction to the
riots in Los Angeles in 1992, cata
pulted his speaking career and lias
led him to spread his message to
schools and universities across the
country.
James Jordan, the assistant direc
tor of the Black Community Ser
vices Center and adviser of the
Black Liberation Committee asked
Anku to speak because "Kwame
doesn't claim to have all the an
swers."
He said that he hopes Anku can
"start some discussion and kick us
off for the rest of the month."
