# Interest group argues against affirmative action on campus
## 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Affirmative action, one of the
most contentions issues on college
campuses nationwide, has again been
brought to the forefront by a group
aiming to eliminate it in college ad
missions.
Last week, the Center for Individ
ual Rights, a Washington, D.C.-
based group which its senior counsel
Terry Pell described as a "public in
terest law firm," took out full-page
advertisements in 14 college newspa
pers nationwide encouraging stu
dents to reject racial preferences in
the admissions process.
The ads accused "nearly every
elite college in America" of breaking
federal laws against discrimination.
They also invited students to order a
free handbook from the center,
which tells how to investigate a
school's admissions policies and how

to potentially take action against a
school that is breaking the law.
According to Pell, since the ads
ran last week, the center has received
about 1 (X) phone calls, as well as more
than SKX) downloads of the handbook
from its website.
Pell explained the group's inten
tions: "We wanted to let students
know that they have a federally pro
tected right to be free of illegal racial
preferences and convey the idea that
the law here is clear," he said.
"Students should not be satisfied
with vague assurances that school of
ficials usually give. We want them to
read the information, investigate
their school to find the facts and
make the decisions for themselves,"
he said.
The group is citing a 1978
Supreme Court decision written by
Justice Lewis Powell, known as the
Bakke decision, to support its cause.
' I*he CIR is against the unconsti

tutional use of race and ethnicity.
Powell's decision that school officials
may not take race into account in
order to achieve a particular desired
racial mix is all we're seeking to up
hold here." Pell said.
University Director of Communi
cations Terry Shepard said Stan
ford's policies do not break the law.
"We regularly review our admis
sions process and practices, and we
think they are consistent with the law
of the land," he said. "We do our very
best to follow the Bakke decision."
Shepard said that University poli
cy is in compliance.
"Justice Powell stated that race
may be one of a number of factors
considered, and that the attainment
of a diverse student body is clearly a
constitutionally permissible goal."
Shepard said.
"So long as race is not the only de
tiding factor, it can he considered a
plus," Shepard said. He added that
this is the policy Stanford follows.
The center chose to advertise in
the newspapers of 14 of the nation's
top universities, including Columbia
University, Dartmouth College,
Duke University and the University
of Pennsylvania. They opted not to
place an ad in The Stanford Daily.
The New York Times and San
Francisco Chronicle reported that

The I )aily did run the advertisement,
however. In addition, the Journal of
Blacks in Higher Education ran a re
buttal advertisement in yesterday's
Daily, which also said that The Daily
ran the first advertisement.
"We think that many competitive
or elite schools are violating clearly
stated interpretations of what the
('onstitution permits," l'ell said.
Currently, the OR has lawsuits
pending in several states for what it
feels are violations of the legal prece
dent established by the Supreme
Court. The firm is suing Alabama
State University, the University of

Michigan and the University of
Washington for their policies.
Pell added, "School officials who
support such policies, which break
the law. may end up being held liable
in individual capacities for damages."
Shepard declined to comment on
Pell's threat. However, he said the
school has no plans to change its ad
missions policy.
"We review all the time, and if the
law changes or court cases change,
we'd want to stay in compliance with
the law," he said. "But right now, we
think we're fine, and we won't be
changing anything."
