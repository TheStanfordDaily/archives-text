# Interest group argues against affirmative action on campus
## 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Affirmative action, one of the
most contentions issues on college
campuses nationwide, has again been
brought to the forefront by a group
aiming to eliminate it in college ad
missions.
Last week, the Center for Individ
ual Rights, a Washington, D.C.-
based group which its senior counsel
Terry Pell described as a "public in
terest law firm," took out full-page
advertisements in 14 college newspa
pers nationwide encouraging stu
dents to reject racial preferences in
the admissions process.
The ads accused "nearly every
elite college in America" of breaking
federal laws against discrimination.
They also invited students to order a
free handbook from the center,
which tells how to investigate a
school's admissions policies and how

to potentially take action against a
school that is breaking the law.
According to Pell, since the ads
ran last week, the center has received
about 1 (X) phone calls, as well as more

preferences and convey the idea that
the law here is clear," he said.
"Students should not be satisfied
with vague assurances that school of

read the information, investigate
their school to find the facts and
make the decisions for themselves,"
he said.
The group is citing a 1978
Supreme Court decision written by
Justice Lewis Powell, known as the
Bakke decision, to support its cause.
' I*he CIR is against the unconsti

tutional use of race and ethnicity.
Powell's decision that school officials
may not take race into account in
order to achieve a particular desired
racial mix is all we're seeking to up
hold here." Pell said.
University Director of Communi
cations Terry Shepard said Stan
ford's policies do not break the law.
"We regularly review our admis
sions process and practices, and we
think they are consistent with the law
of the land," he said. "We do our very
best to follow the Bakke decision."
Shepard said that University poli
cy is in compliance.
"Justice Powell stated that race
may be one of a number of factors
considered, and that the attainment
of a diverse student body is clearly a
constitutionally permissible goal."
Shepard said.
"So long as race is not the only de
