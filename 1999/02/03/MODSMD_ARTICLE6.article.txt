# Labor Dept. may probe University
## Gender discrimination alleged 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
The U.S. Department of Labor is
reviewing a complaint filed last No
vember by eight Stanford faculty and
staff members alleging gender dis
crimination in University hiring and
promotion practices including
tenure, a Labor Department
spokesman confirmed today.

"No one in this
complaint is ask
ing for a prefer
ence," said former
Asst. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak,
one of the com
plainants. "We're
asking to he evalu
ated based on our
qualifications."

"We're asking the government to
see if Stanford is in compliance" with
federal affirmative action laws de
signed to combat "unconscious
bias," she said.
Sawislak, an expert on labor his-

Tory who is currently a research fel
low at Harvard, contributed to a 400-
page report written by female faculty
and staff last year on instances of al
leged gender discrimination within
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences. the Medical School, the Law
School and the School of Education.
The report addressed issues rang
ing from "promotion to appointment
to hostile climate to wrongful termi
nation." Sawislak said.
The group turned the report over
to the Labor Department as part of
its formal complaint in November.
Since then, seven other women from
Stanford have joined the complaint.
"The numbers will probably in
crease." said a complainant, who de
clined to be named.
University Provost Condoleezza
Rice defended Stanford's policies.
"We do everything we can to di
versify the faculty," Rice said. But,
she said, "I think you cannot do any
thing which establishes a separate


Rice
standard" for hiring or promotion.
No formal investigation has
begun, said Labor Department
spokesman lino Serrano.
'"We're still fleshing out the com
plaint," he said. Labor Department
attorneys will decide soon whether to
pursue an investigation that eould
last "a few months, up to a couple of
years," he explained.
One complainant's story
"You are treated with a bias
against you from the very begin
ning." said one of the women who
filed the initial complaint last No
vember. an assistant professor in the
Medical Center. "Our salaries are
lower, and our conditions are worse."
The professor, who declined to be
named, described her situation in her
Medical Center department. In her
field nationwide, 40 percent of
tenured faculty are female, she said.
At Stanford, the figure is only 21 per
cent.
She described how male faculty
with less seniority were routinely
given better offices and secretarial
support in her department.
"It sounds minor, but it adds up...
. It makes it difficult to write scholar
ly papers... or communicate with pa
tients."
She said her department chair told
her specifically she needed "one-and
a-half papers per year" to be promot
ed within the department. Despite
having the requisite number, she was
denied promotion.
"It's not an easy place for male as
sistant profs," she said, "but men do
far better.... It's a revolving door"
for women.
Only three women have bee.,
granted tenure in her department
since she arrived seven-and-a-half
years ago, she said.
"Most of the women who started
with me are gone," she said. "Some
people have been very supportive,"
but powerless to help, she said.
"It's not just my department, it's
every department, with rare excep
tion," she added.
Hiring and promotion
The recent complaint follows

three reports, one in 1993 and two in
1998, on the hiring and promotion of
women at Stanford.
A report given to the Faculty Sen
ate in May 1998 said that women rep
resent 18.1 percent of overall faculty
at Stanford in academic year 1997-98,
a small increase over the 14.7 percent
figure in 1992-93.
Women comprise 28 percent of
humanities faculty at Stanford. How
ever, the percentage of women in
these fields nationwide is double that
number, according to the report.
Stanford's low marks are possibly
related to a change in tenure policy
within the School of Humanities and
Sciences since Rice's appointment in
1993.
According to the report, in 1983,
then-Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Norman Wessells set a policy
regarding women and minority facul
ty tenure, that "in those cases that are
truly borderline, where the decision
could go either way, [it] is resolved in
favor of the candidate."
No separate standards
Under Rice, however, the tenure
policy has changed.
"A automatic default is a separate
standard" for women and minorities.
Rice said. " This is not something we
would do for a male candidate, which
raises a question of fairness and equal
protection."
"You have Labor Department re
quirements for affirmative action,"
Rice noted, "and you also have Jus
tice Department requirements for
equal protection" under federal Title
VII law.
In addition, former University
President Donald Kennedy down
played the "fine distinction" in
tenure policies between the 1980s
and now.
Female and minority junior facul
ty may have extra demands on them
from their campus groups, he said.
"It's an example of things that one
needs to consider in close decisions,"
he said, but not a major factor.
Rice gave several examples of
Stanford's affirmative action pro
grams in hiring, as opposed to tenure,
including recording and reporting of
the gender and race of applicant
pools and new hires for University
positions and broad searches for po
sitions to attract diverse pools of can

didates.
She also described a "Faculty In
centive Fund" set up to hire available
faculty to diversify a department,
even if they do not specifically fit the
position being filled, in addition to
hiring someone for the position.
"One has to pursue policies that
both diversify and pass the test of
equal protection and equal opportu
nity. That's what we're trying to do."
Questioning policies
Sawislak is skeptical of Rice's po
sitions.
"The provost has not set goals and
timetables [for affirmative action],
which are required by federal law,"
she said. "She's framed it as a ques
tion of lowered standards."
"No one wants to be promoted
because of their race or gender,"
Sawislak said. However, social sci
ence research has shown, she said,
that "a lot of unconscious bias goes
into these highly subjective decisions.
.. even with the best of intentions."
Goals and timetables are "in place to
guard against discrimination."
According to federal regulations,
affirmative action must be applied
"at every level of employment. I
don't think it's clear they're doing
that," she said.
Sawislak filed a grievance against
the University in her tenure case,
having been denied tenure under
questionable circumstances. Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper re
cently offered her the opportunity to
return to Stanford and reapply for
tenure, although a faculty advisory
board recommended in a 4 to 2 vote
that he grant her tenure outright.
Casper also said that the invitation
was not related to affirmative action,
though the advisory board was
"unanimous in [its] concern about
the lack of a clearly articulated, wide
ly disseminated, University-wide pol
icy on some aspects of faculty affir
mative action policy."
If the University were to be found
guilty of discrimination, it could be
forced to give back pay, promotions
and job offers, among other penal
ties, Labor Department spokesman
Serrano said.
" The University could be barred
from future federal contract work,"
though that would be extreme, he
said.
