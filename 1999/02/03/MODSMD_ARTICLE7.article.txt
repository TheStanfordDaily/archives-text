# Students support angry employees
## 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
As part of a reorganization of
Housing and Dining Services,
many employees have been reas
signed to new schedules and dining
rooms, causing unhappiness among
the relocated employees.
In response, residents of Man
zanita Park are signing a petition to
support the employees.
As part of its Value Enhance
ment Program, Stanford Dining
Services surveyed students and
completed evaluations of each din
ing facility. They concluded that
they needed to increase staff cover
age on the weekends and imple
mented this by rearranging em

ployment schedules.
The seniority of employees dic
tated the rearrangements. The re
sult is that employees with less se
niority are being moved to accom
modate the preferences of those
with more seniority.
Wanda Alderman, the steward
for Manzanita, Branner Hall and
Toyon Hall, told the students who
use these dining facilities about the
situation. She explained. "There
are a handful of people who are
happy, but the majority of the em
ployees are very angry and unhap
py with the way this whole situation
has been handled."
She went on to ask. "If there are
problems in certain halls, why not
fix the problems directly and leave
the others alone? Why should peo
ple care about their work perfor
mance when the people who have
made this horrible mess don't seem
to care about them?"
Jorge Cervantes, a six-year em
ployee of Dining Services currently
working in Manzanita, expressed
the Manzanita staff's frustration
and confusion. "Nobody wants to

move... everybody is here happy
with their hours and schedule." Un
fortunately. under the reorganiza
tion system, about 12 people must
move.
Cervantes explained that the
Manzanita staff has worked togeth
er for years, forming a relationship
that results in a high quality of ser
vice and quality.
Junior Samantha Collins, a resi
dent of Castano, helped organize
the petition, to be presented to
Shirley Everett, the associate direc
tor of Dining Services. In addition,
a protest march of students and

Dining Services employees is
scheduled for today.
Dining Services disagrees that
the reassignments have caused gen
eral disapproval. "This system was
chosen by the workers," said Lida
Horna, assistant director of Dining
Services. "Many employees have
come forward to tell me how happy
they are."
Rafi Taherian, Stanford's execu
tive chef, noted that "change always
brings a level of dissatisfaction."
Both he and Horna insisted that
widespread unhappiness of the em
ployees comes as a surprise to them.
