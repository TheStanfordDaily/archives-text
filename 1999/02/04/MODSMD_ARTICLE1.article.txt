# Faculty housing awaits approval
## 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
The Office of Institutional Planning has submitted its
proposal to alleviate the current housing shortage for in
coming junior faculty to University President Gerhard
Casper, who will consider it over the next few weeks.
The plans, which include building 36 apartments and
single-family houses in campus residential areas, suggest
three different options to add faculty housing. However,
nothing is final.
The options all focus on developing parts of Dolores
Street, Gerona Road, Mayfield Avenue and French
man's Triangle.
All options propose the construction of 20 apart
ments on Dolores Street, but vary in their distribution of
homes on Mayfield Avenue, Gerona Road and French
man's Triangle. One option allows for no development
on Mayfield Playfield.
If the proposal goes ahead, construction is set to
begin in two to three years.
"We're at a very important stage," said Jeff Wachtel,
a special adviser for faculty and staff housing. "We are
looking forward to open discussion with faculty who live
in the neighborhoods to get their comments on the pro
posal."
The proposals, which are described in the recently re
leased report, "Faculty Housing Development Propos
als," address the University's increasing challenge to re
cruit faculty due to both the housing shortage as well as
the expense of available housing.
Although salaries and benefits offered by Stanford
are nationally competitive, the lack of affordable hous
ing near or on campus has made it difficult to attract can
didates, according to the report.
Vice Provost for Institutional Planning Geoff Cox,
who compiled the report, said, "We feel that the housing
shortage in areas around the University has gotten so se
vere that we are having a terrible time recruiting facul
ty."
Statistics show that, indeed, there is a marked imbal
ance between the number of faculty working and living
on campus. Only 6 percent of assistant professors and 10
percent of associate professors have campus housing.
Law Prof. Pam Karlan, who recently relocated from
Charlottesville, Va., noted thai the housing near Stan
ford is "very expensive" compared to what she had paid
previously.
"The problem is pretty severe," she said. "The Uni
versity can't have a situation in which junior faculty are
having to pay two to three times more than the salary
they are earning. The only way of doing that with the
market the way it is is for the University to provide more
housing."
In 1998, the median campus sale price of a single-fam
ily home was more than $800,000, a figure which would
put an immense strain on the current median salary of all
Stanford associate professors, which is slightly more
than $79,5(X).
In addition to the problem of cost, some say that the
housing shortage impedes the feeling of community

Stanford encourages.
"On-campus housing is really desirable," Karlan said.
"It builds a sense of community. There is a big difference
in the quality of life if people have to live far away."
This sentiment was part of the original plan for the
University.
"It was Jane and Leland Stanford's wish that the
lands they donated as part of the University's endow
ment be used to provide support for its academic pro
gram." the report states. "From the beginning, this sup
port has included housing students and a significant
number of faculty members on campus."
To help preserve the "rural character" of the campus
and quality of life, the development options include the
creation of designated parks in the surrounding neigh-
