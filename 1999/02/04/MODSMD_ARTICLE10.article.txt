Yeltsin recovering in sanitarium
MOSCOW (AP) — President Boris Yeltsin was
back at a government sanitarium recuperating from an
ulcer yesterday, a day after his first visit to the Krem
lin this year.
Yeltsin showed up at his office just long enough to
dismiss several top officials on Tuesday.
Yeltsin accepted the resignation of Prosecutor
General Yuri Skuratov and fired four advisers who
had worked for him for years.
Skuratov said he was resigning for health reasons.
But the president has criticized him harshly for failing
to solve several high-profile murders and to control a
tide of neo-Nazi sentiments.
Yeltsin gave no reason for the dismissal of his aides.
Next week. Yeltsin is scheduled to meet with Ital
ian Premier Massimo D'Alema.

Getty Museum returns stolen art
LOS ANGELES (AP) —The J. Paul Getty Muse
um is returning three ancient works of art to Italy after
determining they were stolen.
The objects will be flown to Italy this week, along
with pieces that were loaned to the museum for an
antiquities exhibit, a museum statement said.
The stolen items are a terra cotta drinking cup from
480 8.C., found to have been illegally excavated from
an archaeological site; a torso of the god Mithras from
the 2nd century, found to have been stolen from a pri
vate Italian collection; and the sculpted head of a vic
torious athlete, a 2nd century Roman copy of an earli
er Greek work, which was apparently taken from the
storeroom of a scientific excavation.
The museum did not say how much the pieces are
worth.
