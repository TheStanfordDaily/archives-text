# Smoking, cocaine increase miscarriage risk
## 
### 
Pregnant women who smoke
cigarettes or use cocaine have a
higher risk of miscarriage, the most
common problem of pregnancy, a
study lias found.
While other studies have suggest
ed a link, this was the first to use hair
and urine testing to determine
women's drug use and smoking,
instead of relying on their own
reports.
"One of the things we have
learned from this study is that self
reporting is far from perfect," said
Dr. Roberta Ness of the I'niversity
of Pittsburgh School of Public
Health and lead author of the study
reported in today's New England
Journal of Medicine.

Smokers are almost twice as 'like
ly to miscarry as nonsmokers,, and
cocaine users are nearly one-and-a
half times as likely to miscarry as
nonusers, according to the study.
About 15 percent of pregnancies
end in spontaneous abortions treat
ed by doctors, but many women do
not seek medical care for early mis
carriage.
The researchers looked at 970
women who sought emergency
room treatment for miscarriage or
other problems at the Hospital of
the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia.
A majority of the women were
black, poor, single and had not
received prenatal care.

Four hundred suffered a miscar
riage, while 570 carried their preg
nancies beyond 22 weeks.
Hair sample tests showed nearly
29 percent of the women who mis
carried had used cocaine, compared
to 20 percent of women with contin
uing pregnancies. Urine tests
showed about 35 percent of the
women who miscarried were smok
ers, compared to 22 percent of the
nonsmokers.
Only 14 percent of the women
who miscarried admitted using
cocaine, and only 30 percent admit
ted smoking.
No link was found between
drinking or marijuana use and spon
taneous abortion.
