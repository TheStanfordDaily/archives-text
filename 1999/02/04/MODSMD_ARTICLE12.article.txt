Frosh-Soph college in
Sterling Quad will
create inequity

LIKE ANY MAJOR change in resi
dential education, the Fresh
man / Sophomore Residential Col
lege cannot avoid affecting Stanford's
campus dynamic. Touching everything
from upperclass housing to the lives of its
1 HO inhabitants, the approval of the col
lege, with a notable lack of concrete
details, has the potential to tremendously
alter certain academic and residential com
ponents of Stanford.
The college, based on the unquestion
ably successful Stanford Introductory
Studies program, will place 9() freshmen
and 9() sophomores in two houses of Ster
ling Quad with the intention of fostering
communal intellectual excitement and cre
ating intimate contact with University fac
ulty.
In addition, the residents of the college
are expected to take Stanford Introducto
ry Seminars together, as well as attend
Introduction to the Humanities and Writ
ing and Critical Thinking sections taught in
their houses.
These students will be isolated geo
graphically, socially and academically for
the two years that they are expected to
spend in the college.
The lack of details in the plan for the
college becomes a serious issue in light of
the college's recent approval for the 1999-
2(KK) school year. The holes in this plan —
extending to everything from the role of
faculty, how residential staff will be select
ed and the exact houses in which the col
lege will reside — alarm us.
We question whether this college can
emulate the models of Stanford Introduc
tory Studies and Sophomore College.
Sophomore College succeeds as an
intense academic experience that occurs,
not accidentally, when the rest of the cam
pus is virtually empty. Stanford Introduc
tory Seminars derive much of their success
from the diverse students that they attract.

These benefits are ostensibly lessened by
the affiliation of the college and the semi
nars, which according to Residential Pro
grams Implementation Group committee
member Ellen Woods will involve several
of the college's students in the same semi
nars.
Furthermore, the college is supposed to
serve those students who have trouble
making contact with faculty. It is our con
cern that the freshmen who apply to this
program with the obvious desire to live in
an intellectually charged environment will
not be those students who would have
problems forming relationships with facul
ty.
Upperclass students cannot help but be
concerned about the loss of singles and
two-room doubles in Sterling Quad, which
is generally regarded as very desirable
housing for an unpreferred year in the
Draw.
The compensation afforded by the con
version of Soto and Faisan back to four
class dorms will do nothing to alleviate this
inequity.
The primary reason offered by the
implementation group for housing the col
lege in Sterling Quad is the close proximi
ty of the house that will be occupied by
Materials Science Prof. John Bravman,
who will be the dean of the college. Lagu
nita Court is just as close.
While Bravman is a commendable
choice for heading the college, his appoint
ment brings up another possible conse
quence of this college's existence. If the
time and energy of esteemed faculty mem
bers such as Bravman are lavished upon
the college, the rest of campus will suffer.
The University is essentially trying to
alleviate a widespread problem with a
pointed solution that will only affect 180
students per class. As a result, the program
could end up doing more harm than good
toward its intended goal.
While the idea of expanding Stanford
Introductory Studies in this manner has
the potential to develop in a very positive
way, the details of the current plan, and
lack thereof, prevent us from endorsing
the college.
