Don't stereotype SLE
With all the controversy surrounding the
changes in Structured Liberal Education
this year, there have been a series of letters
to the editor about the work ethic of SLE
students versus the rest of the Stanford pop
ulation.
I don't know when this idea of anal,
over-achieving SLE students got started
(probably the first day of the program), but
this stereotype has gotten a little out of con
trol with three letters written by people who
have never even been in SLE published in
The Daily.
These students declared that they know
how each of the 110 SLE students personal
ly approaches his or her education.
Unfortunately, it is not just these three
people who think they know my own as well
as my classmates' work ethics. For some
reason, the rest of the campus seems to
believe they know, too.
As a SLE student. 1 have come across
this overachiever stereotype one too many
times.
In discussion session one day for a histo
ry class, some students saw a random book
on the table littered with Post-It notes
marking the pages of important quotations.
When the students saw this, comments like
"must be a SLE student's" and "go back to
Flo Mo" were heard.

While I admit this is mildly amusing, this
stereotype of SLE students is so widespread
that it is not just contained on this campus.
()\er vacation in Boston, 1 met a random
Stanford student who, when he found out I
was SLE, proceeded to groan emphatically
and roll his eyes around in his head until
they looked as if they would pop out of their
sockets.
Was this really necessary?
We are not all masochistic workaholics
who study on Friday nights for fun!
Although I agree that the majority of
people in SLE are truly interested and
engaged in the subjects they are learning, 1
am sure there are people who could not give
a crap whether Montaigne or Cervantes
embarked upon the enterprise of reaffirm
ing the primacy of European discourse.
As a SLE student, 1 have taken other
classes outside of the Flo Mo lounge, and I
would say that the majority of the people in
my classes have been just as engaged and
interested in the subjects we were studying
as SLE students supposedly are.
Therefore, I would ask the Stanford pop
ulation not to judge us SLE students so
harshly.
We are just as fun-loving and home
work-dreading as the rest of you. And, in all
honesty, I would love to be able to travel
freely around the country without this
ridiculous stereotype defining me every

where I go.

Freshman, undeclared
Cartoon showed insensitivity
I was quite disturbed by the cartoon in
yesterday's Daily portraying an empty can
of Colombian coffee as the effect of "earth
quake damage."
Unfortunately, many Stanford students
may not know much about the country
beyond its commercial (and perhaps illegal)
exports, but a cartoon that represents
Colombia with a coffee can does little to
educate and challenge such stereotypes.
What is much more offensive, however,
is making light of a tragedy that has claimed
the lives of thousands of people and caused
mass destruction in a country that has
enough difficulties without the addition of a
horrible natural disaster.
An article on the Colombian Students
Association's efforts to organize relief for
the victims of the earthquake would have
been appropriate coverage.
A cartoon about personal tragedy any
where in the world is not.

Soto mourns four-class switch
Yesterday the Stanford community
learned of a fairly radical idea to create a
Freshman / Sophomore live-in college in
Sterling Quad. To make room for the
upperclass students who will be displaced,
however, Faisan and Soto will return to
being four-class dormitories. This detail
wasn't given much attention, but it's one
that should not be so quickly dismissed.
As Soto's head academic advisor this
year. I have a unique view of Soto's all-frosh
community and just how amazing it's been.
Eighty-eight freshmen and six staff mem
bers have worked together to create an
atmosphere of fun, support and most
importantly, family.
We still have several months left togeth
er, but we've already forged a bond that will
last for years to come.
Soto understands the need for more
upperclass housing here at Stanford, espe
cially with the new housing initiatives.
It's unfortunate, however, that our dor
mitory's overwhelming success in its first
year as all-frosh won't be repeated here.
If this indeed is Soto's only all-frosh year,
everyone involved will consider themselves
extremely lucky to have been a part of it.
