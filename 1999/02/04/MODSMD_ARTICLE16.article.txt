## Teaching responsible citizens 
### 
ON ANY GIVEN night, 150 or more
people in the communities sur
rounding Stanford are homeless,
seeking shelter wherever they can.
Most are middle-aged men; many have
long term mental health or substance abuse
problems. These homeless individuals and
families are typically long-time residents of
the mid-Peninsula area.
The main services provided to this home
less population are through the Urban Min
istry of Palo Alto. The Urban Ministry offers
a hot meal most days for those who want it,
relying principally on surplus food collected
by students from Stanford dining halls. They
also provide services each weekday morning
from a small, outdoor drop-in center located
close to the downtown train station.
Unfortunately, relying on this rather rus
tic outdoor center means that when it rains,
those seeking help get wet. It also means that
other needs of the homeless are not attended
to — needs such as health care, mental
health counseling and job skills training.
For years, the Urban Ministry and others
in our community have been working to try
and provide a permanent, indoor center for
improved services to the homeless.
For the past 12 months, I, along with
other faculty and staff at Stanford, have been
meeting with representatives from a wide
range of civic and religious organizations to
develop a community-wide response to the
current inadequacy in services for the home
less.
Our group, the Community Working
Group on Homeless Services, is in the final
stages of presenting a plan for a permanent
multi-service center for the homeless and
those at risk for homelessness in the mid-
Peninsula area.

As a faculty member working to improve
services to the most vulnerable members of
our neighboring communities, I often won
der about the mixed message students
receive from the University regarding Stan
ford's role and responsibility in this area.
While the Haas Center provides valuable
support to students wishing to volunteer
their time to community service organiza
tions, the University has not yet made an
institutional commitment to serve our com
munity neighbors.
What should Stanford's role be in sup
porting the establishment of such a center for
the homeless? Historically, the University
administration has shied away from support
ing community service efforts because such
efforts are not within the "core mission" of
the University.
This "core mission," as 1 understand it, is
one of education: in the humanities, in the
sciences, in the arts and in the professions. I
agree, but I believe this is only part of the
core.
I believe that this university and others
like it have a duty to educate students to be
responsible citizens, to help them develop
the intellect, imagination and courage to
engage in collective efforts aimed at making
our society more just.
Universities have a special and unique
role in preparing students for lives of person
al integrity and reflective citizenship. To do
this we need to build bridges enabling uni
versity and non-university people to work
together to identify and respond to moral
challenges in our shared public life.
How should this be done? I believe that
Stanford should actively encourage projects
such as the Community Working Group on
Homeless Services, which seek to integrate

the responsibilities of citizenship with knowl
edge and expertise.
In order to link such projects to the Uni-!
versity's educational mission, Stanford,
should strengthen and support those courses
and departments that have established ser
vice-learning programs for their students.,
Service learning provides students the*
opportunity to perform community service'
in a structured, educational format.
Combining knowledge about the commu
nities in which they are working, experiences
from being in the service environment and
opportunities for written and verbal reflec
tion on the service experience, service learn
ing can provide the academic structure
required to ensure a valuable educational
experience.
The University can move considerably
closer to a position of active modeling of
community citizenship.
Assisting the Community Working 1
Group to establish a permanent multi-ser- i
vice center for the homeless on a site that is i
readily accessible to Stanford students, sup- i
porting the faculty and staff who are '
involved in the effort and supporting the !
expansion of service learning to include an 1
ongoing role for Stanford students in provid- (
ing services for the homeless will move the J
University closer to this goal.
Stanford students could then see firsthand! 1

that the experience of completing a universi-'
ty education involves not only acquiring
knowledge but also learning what it means to i
be a responsible citizen. .
