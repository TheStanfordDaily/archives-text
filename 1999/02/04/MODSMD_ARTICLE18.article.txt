## Cardinal plays catch-up; first-half woes a constant 
### Brian Eule Senior staff writer 
OAKLAND — Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery has a sea
soned squad of veterans who have
seen a lot when it comes to college
basketball and who rarely get ner
vous when trailing in a game.
And he's lucky at that.
"We're in a way living on bor
rowed time," said Montgomery,
whose No. 4 Cardinal squad has
had two weeks' worth of games
without a halftime lead. "We're let
ting people get up."
Last night was no exception.
Playing a California team that
scored on its eight straight posses
sions early in the first half, Stanford
fell behind quickly and found itself
playing catchup for the entire peri
od.
"We just seemed to be a little
tentative," Montgomery said. "We
need to play for 40 minutes like we
play the last."
While the Cardinal has been
able to pull off multiple last-minute
wins, there is still a certain amount
of concern in the fact that come
tournament time, or perhaps even
come Saturday afternoon when
No. 1 Connecticut visits Maples
Pavilion, Stanford will not be able
to climb back.
"I think we need to get more ag
gressive and get some of that
hunger back," Montgomery said. "I
just think we can play better. We've
got to get more offense off the
bench."
Not all of Stanford's starters
performed to their capabilities ei
ther (see point guard Arthur Lee's
l-for-4 shooting from the field),
and the Cardinal's bench didn't
provide much attack to help. Cal's
21 points from the bench oversfracl
owed Stanford's nine.
"I have some concerns," Mont

gomery added. We know what to
do. but it isn't easy to do it.
"We had a stretch where we
didn't execute very well. Fortu
nately, we were playing good de
fense."
Forcing Cal to shoot just 15.4
percent from the field in the second
half, the Cardinal was able to climb
back into the game with just four
field goals in the entire second half.
But it may not always be that
easy.
"Everybody in this league is ca
pable of playing well," Mont
gomery said.
With UCONN on Saturday and
UCLA coming to town in but one
week, followed by a roadtrip to
Washington, the Cardinal will have
fewer and fewer games in which it
will be able to rely solely on a strong
defensive performance.
"There are going to be nights
when your offensive skills depart
from you," said forward Mark
Madsen, who scored 13 points in
the first half and just two in the sec
ond. "Every team has situations
where they're down. In my opin
ion, that's part of the game. We're
not going to get down on our
selves. We know we can get a lot
better, but we don't want to dwell"
on this.
Stanford, however, has players
on its current roster who have been
there before. It has a team of play
ers who have witnessed a miracle
comeback against Rhode Island in
the NCAA Tournament. And it
has players who plan to do it all
again, without getting worried if
they are trailing heading into the
final stretch of a game.
"We just stay poised and we stay
confident," Lee said. "We just fig
ure we're going to win the game if
we stay poised. We don't get ner
vous anymore.
"We're too old for that."
