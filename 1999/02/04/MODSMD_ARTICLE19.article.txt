# Stanford beats Bears at the buzzer

### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
OAKLAND — The men's basket
ball team may have escaped with a
57-55 victory against California at
the New Arena in Oakland last
night, but with No. 1 Connecticut
coming into town Saturday, the No.
4 Cardinal (19-3,9-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) knows it has a lot to work

The Cardinal had to overcome a
4-for-19 shooting performance in
the second half, as well as a last-sec
ond offensive attack by the Bears
(12-8, 3-7) before it could finally
breathe a sigh of relief.
The Cardinal's second dance
with the Bears was much like the
game between the two teams at
Maples Pavilion Jan. 9. Cal jumped
out early and caught the Cardinal
by surprise, but as it always does.

Stanford found a way to fight back.
"When you look and compare it
to the first game, they were ahead at
the half, they were the aggressor,
they were very physical," Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We just seem to be a little tenta
tive."
Stanford managed to take the
lead on its first shot of the second
period — a three-pointer by senior
forward Peter Sauer — and man
aged to not fall behind throughout
most of the half.
But there really wasn't much of
which the team could be proud, at
least not on the offensive side of the
ball.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford (19-3
overall, 9-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
55, California (12-8,3-7), 55.

When senior point guard Arthur
Lee drew his fourth foul and was
forced to sit with 13 minutes, 17 sec
onds remaining in the game, the
Cardinal's set offense, with help
from the Bears' stilling defense, all
but disappeared.
Lee's backup, sophomore Mike
McDonald, grabbed a steal on the
ensuing possession and converted it
into a layup to give the Cardinal a
44-42 lead.
But that was about all the of
fense left for Stanford.
Cal managed to hold its cross
bay rival without a field goal for the
next 11:22, and Stanford was forced
to hold on for dear life from the
free-throw line, a spot where the
team has been inconsistent all year
long.
But as the Cardinal's normally
strong poise seemed to fall apart,
the players went to the line during
that stretch and sank 10 of 11 from
the charity stripe, setting up yet an
other in a string of dramatic finishes
for Stanford basketball.

With 1:04 remaining, senior
guard Kris Weems ended the
team's drought from the floor
which gave the Cardinal its 57-55
lead.
But things were far from over.
In an attempt to get the ball back
one last time. Bears coach lien
Braun instructed his team to go for
the quick basket. Forward Michael
Gill overdid it. as he drove across
the lane with Cardinal big men Tim
Young and Mark Madsen covering
him. His layup sailed clear over the
hoop and off the glass.
Lee then took matters into his
hands by trying to hit a spinning
layup. but Cal recovered his miss
and called time with 7.2 seconds re
maining.
Gill missed his three-point at
tempt on the next inbound, but Cal
recovered and Bear guard Thomas
Kilgore was given one last look
from 23 feet out.
It went long, and Stanford had
another tight victory under its belt.
There were, however, many
bright spots for Montgomery's
squad. Besides the clutch perfor
mances from the free-throw line,
Stanford's defense mirrored that of
the Bears in tenacity, as Cal shot
only 4 for 26 - a miserable 15.4 per
cent - from the field during the sec
ond half.
"From that standpoint. 1 was
pleased," Montgomery said. "It's
just that we can play a lot better. We
need to get more offense off the
bench and we've got to do a better
job of running the offense."
But Cal also held some blame for
the anemic shooting. While the
Cardinal had trouble executing its
halfcourt set. the Bears didn't seem
to want to bother to set up an of
fense. instead opting for quick shots
and bad looks at the basket.
"We had to come away with a
foul [on our offensive posses-

sionsj," Braun said. "It was more
like we were hoping for a foul,
rather than drawing a foul."
Junior power forward Mark
Madsen came out in the first hall
and dominated the inside for 13
points and seven rebounds, but
halUimc adjustments by the Bears
kept Itim all but ineffective during
the second period.
"In the first hall we were getting a
lot of clean looks," Madsen said. "In

the second half we got stagnant in
our offense ... but we came hack."
The Cardinal also looked like it

hut he couldn't get his shots to fall.
Gordon and Francisco Elson
combined to keep Young away
from the basket, as well as the ball,
for most of the game.
"My objective was to push him
away from his comfort zone, push
him away from the block," said

Gordon, who was making his first
career start. "I also wanted to shut
down his left hand."
The victory puts another half
game cushion between the Pac-10-
leading Cardinal and second-place
Arizona, but more importantly
gives the team a bit of momentum
for its showdown with the Huskies
on Saturday.
It also leaves the Cardinal with
some major problems to fix before
it can hope to keep up with
IJCONN's explosive offense.
Cal has a dimmer future, as its
postseason hopes are all but gone.
