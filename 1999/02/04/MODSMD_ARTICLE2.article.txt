# RPIG prompts concern
## 
### Evan Moffic Contributing writer 
A new plan to house a freshman
/ sophomore college in Sterling
Ouad and convert Faisan and Soto
into four-class dormitories next
year is facing strong reaction from
students on both sides of the issue.
While several freshman are excited
about the new option, some juniors
and seniors expressed anger at the
loss of potential two-room dou
bles.

According to ASSU President
and senior Maren Norton, closer
student-faculty interaction is need
ed. but it should not come at the ex
pense of displaced seniors. "Ster
ling Ouad is a decent place for two
room doubles for juniors and se
niors who want to live with other
upperclassmen." she said.
"The concept is good, but 1
think more student input was need
ed in deciding the location before
the final decision was made," Nor
ton added.

Norton also expressed concern
about placing freshmen in two
room doubles on the far west side
of campus. "Two-room doubles
are the least social option for fresh
men. They may share a telephone
line, but seniors are working on
theses, looking for jobs and figur
ing out what they want to do with
their lives. This is difficult in a one
room double," Norton said.

Schiff House in Sterling Quad, in addition to Pot
ter House, will be one of the residences affected
by the RPIG plan. Schiff will be converted from a
four-class house to a frosh-soph house, a devel
opment that is upsetting a number of upper-class
students who currently reside in Schiff and Potter.
ter resident Santos Marroquin, a
senior, echoed Norton's concerns.
"Putting the college in Sterling
(Juad is a bad idea. Two-room dou
bles mean much more to seniors
than to freshmen, and it's irrespon
sible for the University to isolate
freshmen in Sterling Quad, where
it's impossible to meet freshmen
from across campus."
"Almost every student I've
talked to or gotten e-mails from
thinks a freshmen / sophomore col
lege in Sterling Quad is an absurd
idea," Marroquin said.
While Sterling Quad may fea
ture two-room doubles, Sellilf
House resident Megan Bohensky, a
senior, noted that most of Sterling
Quad draws unpreferred. "Schili is
not in all that high demand, and we
don't have that many seniors any
way."
"While living ill Schili may be
isolating for freshmen and the
rooms are conducive to being aso
cial. in-house classes and seminars
could help freshmen meet each
other and meet other students in
Sterling Quad," Bohenskv said.

Several freshmen praised the
new program and wished the op
tion had been open to them. "When
I was looking at other colleges, I
wondered why Stanford did not
have a residential college," noted
freshman Elizabeth Dzeng. "It's
nice to have that option open."
According to Dzeng, freshmen
will still meet other freshmen if
they live in Sterling Quad. "Fresh
men go out and look for people.
The room arrangement won't
change that."
Other freshmen expressed con
cern over the fact that all-frosh
dorms Faisan and Soto will be con
verted to four-class dorms. Soto
residents held a candle-light vigil
last night in protest of the change.
"I lived in Soto when it was four
class," said junior Jason Tester, a
Soto head advising associate. "I've
seen the transition from four-class
to all-frosh, and there has been a
big change in spirit. I hate to see us
lose that."
The Residential Program Imple
mentation Group the committee of
faculty, staff and students in charge
of implementing the recommenda
tions of the Task Force on Residen
tial Education and Housing, decid
ed where to house the new college.

RPIG members maintain that
student input was a crucial factor in
deciding the location. Senior and
RPIG member Boris Bershteyn
noted, "Three students were on the
implementation committee, and I
can say that we were very involved
with process.
"We devoted substantial time
and resources to answering every
question and concern throughout
the process of deciding the loca
tion. This is not to say that every
thing always goes our way, but we
have input. We consulted focus
groups made up of students on this
matter," Bershteyn said.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education and RPIG member
Ramon Saldivar concurred. "Stu
dents were part of the initial task
force committee. Different sites
were considered, and we looked for
student input at every stage of the
process. We did surveys, polls,
focus groups and even went to
house meetings."
Saldivar was also quick to point
out that the college is only a pilot
program, and its future rests on stu
dent opinion. "This is an experi
mental, pilot program. We will see
if students like it or not. We are
only committed to trying it out. If

students think it is worth continu
ing, we can look at other sites and
ways of doing the program."
Potter and Schiff houses were
chosen to house the college be
cause of size and proximity to a
home where the college's dean
could live. Material Sciences Prof.
John Bravman will be the dean of
the new college and live in a house
across the street from Sterling
Quad.
"We felt that the leadership of a
key faculty member is crucial to the
academic success of the program.
Since we could not just build a
house for a pilot program, we found
that there was no effective substi
tute for Sterling Quad," Bershteyn
noted.
Potter and Schiff also each hold
about 90 students, and the college
hopes to recruit about 180 students.
The freshman / sophomore col
lege is Stanford's first attempt at a
residential-based college and part
of a trend over the past few years of
strengthening ties between faculty
and students and providing more
options for underclassmen to de
velop their academic interests
under Stanford's Introductory
Studies initiative.
According to Director of Resi

dential Education Jane Camarillo.
the college is intended to lit within
Stanford's existing residential and
academic structures. "Much
thought was put into making it lit
Stanford, our curriculum and our
students. If this project works and
students want more of it. we could
see other kinds of college houses
(like an Honors House) or we
could see the expansion of the
freshman / sophomore residential
college."
"I also believe Stanford students
want to see the continuation of dif
ferent options in the housing sys
tem and believe it unlikely that
Stanford would completely convert
to freshman / sophomore colleges
for all students." Camarillo added.
Senior and Residential Task
Force Committee member Paul
Bodnar also sees the college as an
other option for underclassmen but
cautioned against making too much
of its success.
" The college has the potential to
be a very successful program. Bui
the University should never consid
er expanding it across campus and
sequestering freshmen and sopho
mores. The college should be one
other choice among the palette of
choices," Bodnar said.

residents held a candle-light vigil
last night in protest of the change.
"I lived in Soto when it was four
class," said junior Jason Tester, a
Soto head advising associate. "I've
seen the transition from four-class
to all-frosh, and there has been a
big change in spirit. I hate to see us
lose that."
The Residential Program Imple
mentation Group the committee of
faculty, staff and students in charge
of implementing the recommenda
tions of the Task Force on Residen
tial Education and Housing, decid
ed where to house the new college.

RPIG members maintain that
student input was a crucial factor in
deciding the location. Senior and
RPIG member Boris Bershteyn
noted, "Three students were on the
implementation committee, and I
can say that we were very involved
with process.
"We devoted substantial time
and resources to answering every
question and concern throughout
the process of deciding the loca
tion. This is not to say that every
thing always goes our way, but we
have input. We consulted focus
groups made up of students on this
matter," Bershteyn said.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education and RPIG member
Ramon Saldivar concurred. "Stu
dents were part of the initial task
force committee. Different sites
were considered, and we looked for
student input at every stage of the
process. We did surveys, polls,
focus groups and even went to
house meetings."
Saldivar was also quick to point
out that the college is only a pilot
program, and its future rests on stu
dent opinion. "This is an experi
mental, pilot program. We will see
if students like it or not. We are
only committed to trying it out. If

students think it is worth continu
ing, we can look at other sites and
ways of doing the program."
Potter and Schiff houses were
chosen to house the college be
cause of size and proximity to a
home where the college's dean
could live. Material Sciences Prof.
John Bravman will be the dean of
the new college and live in a house
across the street from Sterling
Quad.
"We felt that the leadership of a
key faculty member is crucial to the
academic success of the program.
Since we could not just build a
house for a pilot program, we found
that there was no effective substi
tute for Sterling Quad," Bershteyn
noted.
Potter and Schiff also each hold
about 90 students, and the college
hopes to recruit about 180 students.
The freshman / sophomore col
lege is Stanford's first attempt at a
residential-based college and part
of a trend over the past few years of
strengthening ties between faculty
and students and providing more
options for underclassmen to de
velop their academic interests
under Stanford's Introductory
Studies initiative.
According to Director of Resi

dential Education Jane Camarillo.
the college is intended to lit within
Stanford's existing residential and
academic structures. "Much
thought was put into making it lit
Stanford, our curriculum and our
students. If this project works and
students want more of it. we could
see other kinds of college houses
(like an Honors House) or we
could see the expansion of the
freshman / sophomore residential
college."
"I also believe Stanford students
want to see the continuation of dif
ferent options in the housing sys
tem and believe it unlikely that
Stanford would completely convert
to freshman / sophomore colleges
for all students." Camarillo added.
Senior and Residential Task
Force Committee member Paul
Bodnar also sees the college as an
other option for underclassmen but
cautioned against making too much
of its success.
" The college has the potential to
be a very successful program. Bui
the University should never consid
er expanding it across campus and
sequestering freshmen and sopho
mores. The college should be one
other choice among the palette of
choices," Bodnar said.
