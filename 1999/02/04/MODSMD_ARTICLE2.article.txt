# RPIG prompts concern
## 
### Evan Moffic Contributing writer 
A new plan to house a freshman
/ sophomore college in Sterling
Ouad and convert Faisan and Soto
into four-class dormitories next
year is facing strong reaction from
students on both sides of the issue.
While several freshman are excited
about the new option, some juniors
and seniors expressed anger at the
loss of potential two-room dou
bles.

According to ASSU President
and senior Maren Norton, closer
student-faculty interaction is need
ed. but it should not come at the ex
pense of displaced seniors. "Ster
ling Ouad is a decent place for two
room doubles for juniors and se
niors who want to live with other
upperclassmen." she said.
"The concept is good, but 1
think more student input was need
ed in deciding the location before
the final decision was made," Nor
ton added.

Norton also expressed concern
about placing freshmen in two
room doubles on the far west side
of campus. "Two-room doubles
are the least social option for fresh
men. They may share a telephone
line, but seniors are working on
theses, looking for jobs and figur
ing out what they want to do with
their lives. This is difficult in a one
room double," Norton said.

Schiff House in Sterling Quad, in addition to Pot
ter House, will be one of the residences affected
by the RPIG plan. Schiff will be converted from a
four-class house to a frosh-soph house, a devel
opment that is upsetting a number of upper-class
students who currently reside in Schiff and Potter.
