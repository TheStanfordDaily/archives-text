# Women's water polo looks toward a winning season
## The
						polo powerhouse faces challenges having lost three key players to the National team 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
According to the coach, the team is going to pick up
right where it left off last year.
And for the No. 3 Stanford women's water polo
team, that means being a front-runner for the national
title right from the beginning of the season.
With three seniors, two juniors, seven sophomores
and two freshmen, the squad is smaller than last year —
but just as powerful and talented as ever.
"We're going to have a good team." said head coach
John Tanner. "And the reason is our three seniors.
They're such good leaders in different ways."
The seniors include two-meter defender Nicole
Glazer, co-captain Lindsay Tam and goalie and co
captain Heather Crary.
"Nicole is one of the toughest, smartest players in
the water," Tanner said. "And Lindsay and Heather
accept nothing but the best from themselves. I hey re
better leaders because they set such good examples.
Not only does Stanford have good leadership, it also
has incredible depth and talent.

"We have good people in every position," Tanner
said.
Filling the integral two-meter position — after the
departure of junior Ellen Estes, who left to train with
the U.S. National team — are sophomores Kelly
Shouey and Dani Bell, who have both "done really
well there," according to Tanner.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: Season opener: Stanford vs. UCLA.

Also sharing duties in the hole is freshman Kate Pet
tit.
"Kate has really improved a lot." Tanner said.
Joining Glazer in defending the hole are sopho
mores Hilary Gollogly and Anne-Marie Keenan.
Sophomore Ally Henry will defend the cage along with
starting goalie Crary.
On offense, the Cardinal will benefit from the
strong left-handed shots of Keenan and fellow sopho
more Kris Koblik.
Junior Elissa Keszler, a driver, will also be an im
portant part of Stanford's counter attack. Keszler will
be the lone junior in the water while hole-set Aloha
Jamias recovers from shoulder surgery. Rounding out
the Cardinal offense are sophomore driver Ali Riddell
and freshman Margie Dingeldein.

'We have good people in every position.'
—John Tanner

Two-time All-American Suze Gardner, a leading
scorer and key part of Stanford's offense for the past
two years, is taking this year off from both school and
polo.
In spite of the loss, Stanford's offense looks to be
just as strong as ever. The addition of some new blood
will be especially important to the Cardinal's success.
This year's freshman class is an extremely talented
group of four players. But since freshmen Brenda Villa
and Jackie Frank left with Estes to train with the Na
tional team, Dingeldein and Pettit will be the only two
members of their class to see Cardinal playing time this
season.
And according to Tanner, they're going to be quite
an asset to the squad.
"They're extremely bright and they both have real
ly good water polo intelligence," Tanner said. "Things
happen pretty fast when we're putting plays and de
fenses together. All our tactics are pretty complex, but
the freshmen are picking it up fast and the seniors are

good teachers in their own right. Margie has a lot of
speed, which will be really good on our counter at
tack."
This season, Dingeldein and Pettit will become a
part of the program's winning tradition of excellence.
Last season, Stanford finished third at the NCAA
championships. The Cardinal fell to Cal 8-5 in the
semifinal match, losing the chance to compete for the
national title. Stanford went on to defeat Hawaii 10-4
for third place.
Stanford kicks off league play Saturday with a
home game against the top-ranked, three-time defend
ing national champion UCLA squad.
Saturday's game, which begins at 10:30 a.m. at
dcGuerre pool, will give the Cardinal a good idea of
where they are and what they need to do before Na
tionals roll around in May.
Right now, it looks as though the Stanford team will
be a strong competitor once again.
"We have a good balance of size and speed," Tan
ner said.
"We have a group of quality players and terrific
people [leading the squad) and that makes it easier for
evervone else."
