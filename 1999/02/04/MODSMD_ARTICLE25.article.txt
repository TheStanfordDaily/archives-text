### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
The Stanford wrestlers (4-4) are
set to do battle with the Bulldogs of
Fresno State (4-5-1) Friday at Burn
ham Pavilion. I he Bulldogs are the
l l W,x Western Athletic C onference
champions and look to upend the
Cardinal in this important dual
meet.
I he Cardinal is coming off a
much-needed break in which the
team was able to get healthy for the
most important part of the season.
I he last dual meet ended in a close
26 12 losstoCal Poly-San ! uis Obis
po on Jan. 23. in which the team was
a little sluggish and battling illness.
Fresno State tied Cal Polv 17-17
in a dual meet last weekend, so a
healthy Stanford squad matches up
well with the Bulldogs.
"I resno State and Cal Poly are
vei \ similar teams." Stanford coach
( hi is I lorpel said. "The dual will he
a lot like the one we had with Cal
Poly. II we are able to pull out the
close ones, we will win the dual."
Stanford is led by junior captain
Zach Ximmerer (133 lbs.), who has
posted an IS-3 record, including five
pins, this season. I le is riding a win
niiiH streak which dates back to Dec.

29-30 at the Midlands tournament
and is currently ranked 13th in the
nation. He will take on Bulldog ju
nior Paris Ruiz, who was ranked sec
ond in the nation before being side
lined by injury early in the season.
"This year should a good dual, "
Zimmerersaid. "We lost last year on
the final match, so I think we have a
little score to settle with them."
There will be a war at 125 pounds
as junior Rudy Ruiz takes on Bull
dog sophomore Stephen Abas.
Abas is currently ranked first in the
nation after defeating league
Moore of Oklahoma State, the pre
vious No. 1. Ruiz will rely on the
tough training he and the team have
done in the past two weeks in this
fierce match.
"We trained twice a day to make
sure we have some improvement in
our conditioning," I lorpel said. "We
have done a lot of live wrestling late
ly and should be hungry for a little
competition."
Senior captain Beau Weiner
(157) goes to the mat with Fresno
State junior Tim Cornish holding a
national rank of 20th and a personal
edge. In their last meeting, Weiner
overcame Cornish, 7-6. in the finals
of the Aggie Open on Jan. 16.
Weiner has taken a tip from for-

mer pro basketball player Michael
Jordan in preparation for this
match.
"I heard Michael Jordan eats a
steak before a big game," Weiner
said. "I am going to start to make
this part of my regimen for every
match."
Also on the plate this weekend
for the Cardinal is the All-California
Invitational held at San Francisco
State on Saturday. This is an impor
tant tournament for Stanford be
cause it features all the teams from
California which the Cardinal might
see in the Pacific 10 Championships.
"This competition will give us an
idea of how we stack up in a Pac-1()
style tournament, " Horpel said.
"This will give each athlete an idea
of what he needs to work on before
the Pac-10 tournament."
Horpel looks for junior Warren
McPherson (165) and senior Shane
Cross (174) to come on strong this
weekend. McPherson is coming off
a bout of sickness and Cross has
been coming up short in some of his
closer matches as of late.
"Warren should make a big
change in his performance, since he
won't be coming off being sick; and
Shane is ready to pull out those close
matches," Horpel said.
