# Tennis gains experience

Senior Ryan Wolters and freshman K.J. Hippensteel
open play today in the Rolex National Intercollegiate
Tennis Tournament in Dallas, Texas. Both Wolters and
Hippensteel earned spots in the 32-player singles draw,
and they will team up to form one of the 16 teams in the
doubles draw.
Wolters, ranked No. 5 in the nation in singles, will
most likely be seeded in the singles half of the tourna
ment. Hippensteel enters the tournament currently
ranked 19th and will not be seeded. The two players are
also ranked No. 4 in doubles nationally and thus stand in

good shape for a doubles seeding.
But both know that rankings and seedings can be a bit
misleading this early in the season.
"Right now we don't really look at our ranking too
carefully," said Wolters. "There is stili a ton of tennis to
be played and what counts is where you are come May. "
Hippensteel agrees. "The rankings right now are
based only on a few individual tournaments," he said. "A
lot can change, and it can change fast. We just think about
trying to play good tennis and let the rankings follow."
Rolex tournament directors took the 16 winners and
finalists from the eight national regions. Each region
hosted a qualifier to send its two representatives. Since
California is so big. however, it had a Southern California
and Northern California qualifier. The remaining 16
players were given at-large bids based on their national
rankings.
Thus, the competition will be fierce.
"This weekend will be a good opportunity to see
where I stand," said Wolters. "Many of the players in
Dallas will be the ones I will hopefully be up against in the
NCAAsin May. It never hurts to get extra match experi
ence."
Perhaps Hippensteel, the sole freshman starter on the
Stanford team, can use the experience even more than
the veteran Wolters. He looks at the tournament purely
in a positive sense.
"1 am excited to gain tough match experience," he
said. "The guys I play this weekend will be every bit as
tough as the ones I will go up against throughout the year.
As a first-year college player, the more experience I gain
the better."
The two players got off to a great start in doubles early
in the year before struggling a bit of late. Interestingly,
the only two doubles matches they have lost all year have
been indoors — against SMU and Washington. They
were both hard-fought matches that were determined by
one or two big points.
This weekend they will once again be forced to try
their luck under a roof. But, both Wolters and Hippen
steel said they were not too concerned. They believe that
whether indoor or outside they just have to focus on play
ing their style of tennis.
"We're as ready as we can be and looking forward to
it." said Wolters. "The indoor factor won't be a big one,
because it all comes down to who plays the best tennis.
Hopefully K.J. and I will play up to our capability."
Assistant coach John Whitlinger believes the two are
ready and this weekend will be positive for them. "It will
be kind of like a mini-NCAAs," said Whitlinger. "The
best players from all around will be there and K.J. and
Ryan will get a good look at the talent out there. They are
excited and ready, and no matter how the results turn
out. we look at it as a positive experience."
