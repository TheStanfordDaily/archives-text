I lie St an lord's women's tennis team
crushed the S;mt;i Clara Hroneos 7-0 I ues
dav to bring the Cardinal's overall dual
nialeh record to fi-0. I he ('ardinal is now 3-0
against Pacific 10 ( 'onference opponents.
While the team appeared a little sluggish
on a la/.y I tiesday afternoon, the players
niimaged to easily out-wit their competitors.
"It lelt like we were all just one step away
from the ball in every rally," said freshman
Keiko lokuda, who whipped Santa Clara's
Jodie ( urran 6 1. 6-0 in the No. 4 singles
match.
Junior Jennifer llciser, who posted an
identical score against Nicole Williams at the
No. position, agreed.
I was hitting the ball okav," I leiser said.
"I felt good and I have a lot of confidence,
but I'm definitely not peaking. I'm saving my
best."
llciser has consistently improved during
her three years at Stanford and is now a

starter for every match. Her fluid ground
strokes and calm demeanor make her a
strong competitor, although some onlookers
worry that she is too relaxed in match situa
tions.
"My coach sometimes says that I need to
get more pumped up and show more emo
tion," I leisersaid. "I'll try. I just want to keep
on improving and win every match for my
team."
1 ike llciser, freshman Lauren Kalvaria
and sophomore Sarah Pestieau also marched
through their respective matches, each only
conceding a single game.
Freshman Gabby Lastra, playing in the
No. I singles spot for the Cardinal for the
first time, had a bit more trouble than her
teammates. Lastra found herself in a tight
first set as her opponent. Santa Clara's Lind
say ('olker. ran down several of her shots and
displayed a gritty will to win.
"I felt like I was in control the whole time,
but it was close," Lastra said. "1 let her stay in
the points and then made stupid mistakes."
Soon, however, Lastra snapped out of her

lunk and swept the last several games, stop
ping Colker 6-4,6-0.
"I became more aggressive," said Lastia,
whose crisp volleys serve her well in both sin
gles and doubles. "1 love coming to the net."
Overall, Head Coach Frank Brennan was
pleased with the players' performances. He
was especially enthusiastic about the Cardi
nal's surprisingly easy victories over Wash
ington State, Washington and Oregon last
weekend.
"I'm really very pleased," Brennan said.
"We outplayed three pretty good teams. Our
game is not peaking, but the freshmen really
responded well to the dual-match situation."
Brennan was impressed not only with the
players' games, but also with the attitudes
they brought to the court.
"Our team chemistry is excellent," he
said. "The girls didn't just play well â€” they
competed well, too."
The Cardinal's top two singles players,
freshman Marissa Irvin and junior captain
Teryn Ashley, sat out the match against
Santa Clara in order to rest before their busv

schedule at the Rolex Indoors Individual
Championships in Dallas this weekend.
Irvin will be seeded at the prestigious na
tional tournament, which is considered the
third leg of the ITA's Grand Slam of colle
giate events.
The tournament will feature 32 of the
country's top players.
"Irvin has as good of a chance as anyone
to take the tournament," Brennan said. "Her
power game is suited to the indoor surface
and she has been playing well lately."
Ashley also has the game to upset the
tournament's top seeds. The primary ques
tion surrounding the junior All-American,
however, is whether or not she has the confi
dence and mental stamina to string together
several victories against tough competitors.
Together, Ashley and Irvin should prove
a formidable force in the doubles. The duo
boasts an overall record of 11-1 for the sea
son.
It is quite possible that one or both of
these Stanford athletic stars will walk iway
with a tournament crown this weekend.
