## Dance/Music Viennese Ball returns Feb. 17 
### 
Thanks to the students from the Stanford-in-Vienna
program who organized the first ball on campus,
Stanford has hosted its prestigious annu-

al Viennese Ball since 1977. And 1999 will be
no exception. The 1999 Viennese Ball to be

held Feb. 27 continues the tradition while
presenting a few changes to make the Ball
more attractive, or at least attractive to
more.
The Ball will be held off-campus as it

was last year, but this time it will take place
at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport

in Burlingame. There are various reasons for
this change, space being the most important.

More spacious ballrooms mean more tick
ets available and more dancing space.

With ballrooms twice as big as the
Roble dance studios, dancers won't
A

need to camp out for tickets. But
it still might be a bad idea to

wait until the last minute.
The number of tickets
A

available for sale is
less than 400, and

students show
increasing

interest in this
annual tradi-

tion of a "formal
evening of waltzing

and swinging," as fresh
man An-swol Hu put it.

Not all students are excited

about the Ball, however. Holding the ball
in a more elegant location increases ticket
prices and discourages people from attend

ing. For the swingers, there will be a live
} band in addition to the Strauss
' Orchestra. And for the beginners, or
those with little experience in ballroom
dancing, there will be lessons in swing,
polka and waltz during Austria Week prior
to the Viennese Ball. "People don't have
to waltz," said sophomore Alice Ganier.
Another highlight of Austria Week will be
the Austrian dinner the night before the
Ball, during which Dr. Sid Hetzler from
Austria will give a speech titled "In search
of the lost art of waltzing."

"We are trying to infuse Austrian cul
ture into the week," explained senior
Karen Gee. Besides the dance lessons

and the dinner, other features of
Austria Week include a masquerade
ball and a night of movies.

Gee and 35 others will open the
Ball with a waltz and quadrille
they have practiced under chore
ographers Theo Alkousakis and

Laura Hill. The two choreog
raphers look forward to an
evening much "fancier" than
a high school prom.

And so at last the Viennese Ball is
here, and it promises to be more
enchanting than ever.

Tickers are $75 / pair and will be
on sale from noon to Ip.m. in
White Plaza until Feb. 5.
