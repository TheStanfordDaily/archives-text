# MXPX: Let It Happen
## 
### 
They've been called a Christian band, and
they've been labeled sell-outs for allegedly
straying away from their roots. They've been
accused of changing their sound and have had their
motives questioned for moving from independent
label Tooth&Nail Records to major label A&M. But

there is no doubt about the fact that
MXPX has made their impact in the
punk rock scene. As three high school
boys from Bremerton, Wash., who
broke into the mainstream by build
ing up a firm fan base and putting
out several solid albums, MXPX,

with their latest "Let It Happen," has proven that
they're not just kids anymore.
Originally known as Magnified Plaid, the band's
name was shortened to M.P., with the abbreviation
periods written as X's, and the nickname stuck. The
original band members met at a church youth
group and began playing songs together, eventually
garnering the attention of Tooth&NaU, which put
out several 7-inch records and then their first hill
length in 1994 called "Pokinatcha." It became the

label's biggest seller, leading to two more albums
and an all-cover-song album. By 1996, they were a
huge draw at their live shows and the release "Life in
General" solidified their position as one of the pre
mier melodic punk bands at the time. They toured
with Blink, and their rise in popularity followed a
pattern similar to Blink's, getting noticeable radio
and MTV airplay of their single "Chick Magnet"
with a sound that put a lot of pop in their punk. By
the time they came out with their major label album
"Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo" last year, '90s
punk rock was at the peak of its popularity.
"Let It Happen" is a retrospective of sorts, a col
lection of vinyl 7-inch and 10-inch B-sides and
unreleased tracks that didn't make the album cuts.
In 32 songs, it comprehensively traces MXPX's
sound from pop-punk to hardcore with everything
in between. Songs like "Begin To Start" and "Elvis Is
Dead" contain a decidedly swing-sounding ele
ment, courtesy of Yuri Ruley, while "Easier Said
Than Done" and "Lifetime Enlightenment" have
lead vocalist-bassist Mike Herrera screaming hard
core-style vox ("This is a yelling song," he says at the

start of the latter) and guitarist Tom Wisniewski
hammering out metal riffs. Meanwhile, the catchy
hoolcs and sing-along choruses typical of melodic
punk can be found in songs such as "Never Learn,"
"GSF" and the title track "Let It Happen." The cover
songs "Oh Donna" by Ritchie Valens and "Sick Boy"
by perennial Orange County punk rock legends
Social Distortion point towards two quite different
yet important influences on the band's sound. The
last seven songs on the record are alternate demo
versions of songs off of the "Life in General" album.
The compact disc liner notes have many pictures
from earlier live shows and a complete listing of
where the album's songs originally came from.
Indeed, as you listen to "Let It Happen," you get a
sense of the album's scope as far as the band is con
cerned. Put out by Tooth&Nail and not A&M, it is
truly representative of the three-boys-from-
Washington flavor that MXPX puts forth, and it is
certainly recommended listening for fans of the
band or the genre. All others are encouraged to lis
ten up as well.
