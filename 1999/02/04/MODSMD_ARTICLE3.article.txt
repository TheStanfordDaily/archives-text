# El Nino's legacy
## One year ago, a flood rolled across campus 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
One year ago today on a rainy morn
ing. the Stanford campus awoke to Hood
ed libraries, rivers where there had been
roads, and the first day of canceled class
es since the Loma Prieta Earthquake.
El Nino had paid a devastating visit.
The largest storm in 30 years wreaked
havoc on an already waterlogged cam
pus, causing Hooding and damage to sev
eral buildings including Green Library.
Braun Music Center and the School ol
Education.
The storm was "just a huge event."

said Chris Christofferson, associate vice
provost for facilities operations. He
added that this type of storm only occurs
once every hundred years.
In order to prevent similar problems
with storms in the future, Facilities Oper
ations commissioned a study to outline a
set of specific interim steps. Christoffer
son cited the development of "burms,"
which are raised ridges modifying the
landscape to "encourage water to g0...
where it doesn't hurt our buildings"
()ne of the steps is the creation of two
new catch basins for excess water How
near the center of campus, as well as the
construction of a cored-out drain under

the arcade between Cubberley and the
west entrance of Green Library.
Although both Cubberley and Green
sustained electrical damage, the overrid
ing concern was for Green's voluminous
library holdings shelved in the basement.
More than 75,(KX) wet books needed sal
vaging.
"Things. . .were literally floating
around," said Catherine Tierney, assis
tant University librarian for Technical
Services. Water level was between 7 and
K inches high in the basement of Green.
"I just saw water." said Matt Blythe. a
coterminal student who was one of the
first of many people to volunteer their

help in the wee hours of the morning.
When the volunteers first entered the
basement, there was about a foot of
water. "It was like a river moving through
Green," said Blythe. More than 150 vol
unteers labored through the night, carry
ing the wet, heavy books out of the base
ment.
Speed in removing the water-logged
books was essential, according to Tier
ney. In order to have a good chance of
preserving them, "the key point is to get
wet books frozen before mold sets in."
The books were taken to a document

recovery company, w here 75.(KM) wet
books were fro/en, dried, cleaned
and returned. Of those books, 3 per
cent required commercial rebinding
and 2 percent, in house repair. Less
than one percent were beyond sal
vage and required replacement.
According to Tierney, "we ex
peeled twice as many total losses as
we ended up having." She cited the
document recovery process, which
involves compressing the wet frozen
books with bungee cords to keep
them tight.
"There's no question that it was a
very rewarding experience," said
Christolierson. " I he response, the
mobilization of students from the
dormitories was one of the most im
pressive things I've seen in all my
years in higher education."
Many students took advantage of
the water park atmosphere caused
by the Hooding. "I jumped on a mat
tress in from of 553 [Mavfield] and
floated down to the post office." said
