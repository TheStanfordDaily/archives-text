# independents in the sun
## Film Festival 
### Alex Sepiol Contributing writer 
7i lefrer from Sundance

Los Angeles can seem like a very strange place. A
city ruled by the media industries of film and
television, the citizens buzzing around freeways
in black sport-utility vehicles, talking to the person in
the black sport-utility vehicle beside them about their
new project.
Strange as it seems, though, it's even weirder when
Los Angeles is transplanted into Park City, Utah for the
Sundance Film Festival. At least the SUV's fit here.
The Sundance Film Festival is supposed to be about
independent film. Robert Redford started the Sundance
Institute in 1981 to enhance the vitality of American
film. And many of the films presented at Sundance do
indeed belong here, being more daring than what
shows at the local multiplex. Still, one can't help but feel
the cellular technology emitting waves of speculation
and the smell of cash wafting over the lattes and
promises of distribution.
The "buzz" phenomenon and deal-making are not
unique to Sundance, of course. They're part of the
increasing corporatization of independent film. Most

"independent" films are distributed by

subsidiaries of major studios.

October Films, for example,

is owned by Universal,
and Fox Searchlight

and Sony Pictures
Classics you could

presumably figure
out on your
own.

But enough
about distribu
tion and eco
nomics. Let's

munch on
some popcorn
and talk
movies. The one

1 liked most was

one I didn't even
plan on going to:

It's even weirder
when LA. is

transplanted into Park
City, Utah for the
Sundance Film Festival.

"Life Is to Whistle (La
Vida es Silbar)." This

wonderful slice of magic

realism was directed by

At least the
SUV's fit here.

Fernando Perez of Cuba. Even if you

can't stand subtitles, you can enjoy the lovely

shots of end-of-the-millennium Havana populated by a
beautiful cast.
At the screening, the director said he made this
film because of the three things he loves most dear
ly: his children, the cinema and Cuba. One senses
those concerns in the three intertwining stories of
"Life Is to Whistle." The film remains buoyant even
as each character faces a difficult moral choice.
Mariana, a ballerina, vows to God to abstain from
sex, which she dearly loves, if she lands the role of
Giselle. She lands the role, but her gorgeous co-star,
Ismael, falls in love with her. Elpidio, a musician whose

conscience is guided by the music of his youth, falls in
love with a tourist and must choose between leaving
with her and his beloved mother, who is — no coinci
dence — named Cuba.
Meanwhile, Julia attempts to figure out why she has
fainting spells whenever she hears the word "sex" and is
frightened by the answer. Although I did not under
stand what was so great about whistling, that lesson is
fortunately bookended to the very beginning and end
of the film. This film will force you to abandon cyni
cism and laugh real laughs and cry real tears.
Perhaps more artfully done, though less exhilarating,
was"The Loss of Sexual Innocence," written and direct
ed by Mike Figgis of "Leaving Las Vegas" fame. Fear not,
this is no depressing alcoholic-fest, though it is a diffi
cult film. Figgis seems to be working out an idea here
about the connection between sex, death and maturity.
The narrative follows various episodes in the life of a
boy named Nic as he becomes a man. At least four dif
ferent actors play Nic, which can get a little confusing.
Julian Sands ("A Room with a View") and Jonathan
Rhys Meyers ("Velvet Goldmine") handled the

adult and teenage Nics very well. Figgis
alternates fragments of the Nic narra-

tive with the tale of Adam and Eve
(wonderfully acted in dumb-

show) and a vignette about a
pair of twins separated at
birth.

The soundtrack features
the work of Chopin,
which contributed to the
meditative nature of this
quiet film. I thought

"Loss" seemed a little too
slow while I watched it,

but the pace has a terrific

effect on you. I have been

thinking about the images
from this film all week.

Fortunately, the film already
has distribution, so look for it.
In the"I think that was good,

but wow, was it fucking weird" cat
egory, the winner was clearly "Treasure

Island," written and directed by Scott King.
This much I know: it's set in San Francisco

towards the end of World War 11, when the United
States' only remaining opponent was Japan. It follows
two intelligence officers who have to create letters
divulging false strategies, which they will plant on a
dead airman, who will then be dropped behind enemy
lines to fool the Japanese.
Beyond that, it seems that the film is about the con
fusion of sexual identity. 1 think. And the dead guy
gradually becomes a character. The two officers each
have bizarre ways of dealing with their respective sexu
al issues. One repeatedly claims that he is not a "queer,"
but he and his wife pick up men in gay bars for three
somes. The other is a compulsive polygamist but is

entire film in rapid
French, so the sub-

titles go a-flying.

Tank up on
Gauloises and
Sartrean nausea
before this one.

"When Love
Comes," a cute New
Zealand comic drama

unable to have sex with unmarried women.
The sexual quirks, particularly due to the World War
II setting and the reappearance of the dead airman
whose life they are writing, provide the most interest
ing, funny and confusing parts of the film.
"1 Stand Alone (Seul Contre Tous)" is a fascinat
ing character study of a bigoted Frenchman at the
end of his rope. It is a very tense and jarring film:
before one particularly disturbing sequence, a warn
ing tells you that you have thirty seconds to leave

the screening. The basic story follows

an over-the-hill butcher who,

through various wrong or

forced choices, is watch-

ing his life fall apart. He

narrates almost the

relates the story of
three intertwining cou
ples and love and love and

love. There is something

about films from down there

(Australia as well) that cannot avoid

melodrama (some might say — cheese).
Fortunately, "Love" was saved by the majestic perfor
mance of Rena Owen, who plays an aging pop star who
has returned from America in shame. She delivers a
speech in front of a bonfire revealing the truth behind
her return to New Zealand — a climactic moment of
high melodrama. The other two stories aren't as
absorbing, but they fit in well enough.
"Edge of Seventeen." Yet another gay-coming-out,
coming-of-age, slice-of-life tale, the most repeated for
mula since Tarantino put clever dialogue in the mouths
of criminals. It features the signal trademarks of the
genre: cute boy lead, slightly butch female friend who is
in love with the lead, jaded older queens and chicken
hawks, confrontation between cute boy and mother and
a happy ending of love for the cute boy (I don't think
that gives anything away).
There are so many coming-out tales, the only
shocker would be a gay character closeting himself.
What sets this one apart? A stroke of brilliance: set
ting this formula tale in Ohio, circa 1984. The music
(think Eurythmics — Annie Lennox in a suit, think
Boy George and Bronski Beat) and fashion (see pre
vious parentheses) of that sexually confused era add
a whole 'nother dimension to coming out. It is an
important question for a teenage boy who is coming
out: am I gay, or do I just have a daring fashion
sense?
