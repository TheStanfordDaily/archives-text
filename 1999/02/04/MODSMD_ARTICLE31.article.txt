### Dick Dale goes over the edge with Intermission 
ick Dale was born in South
.*■" Boston, Mass. on May 4, 1937.
% At the age of 17, he moved out
' Calif, to become a full-time
surfer. Originally a drummer,
Dale soon picked up a guitar
■"V-r- and created a new type of music
/ ■ that would become the sound-
H*. 'i\ ■ track to the surfing generation.
; , \ Within a year, he was playing to
huge crowds locally and grew to
yrX\be known as "King of the Surf
Guitar." Dale has sold millions
°112 albums but his most well
' known tune is 1954's instru
mental "Miser-lou," which
became the title track for the Quentin Tarantino film "Pulp Fiction." He was
also named the "Forefather of Rock and Roll" by "Thirty Years of Rock and
Roll," the "Father of Fleavy Metal" by Guitar Player magazine and has since
appeared in numerous films and television and radio shows. Still touring at
the age of 61, Dale and his entourage roll into town this week to play at Palo
Alto's "The Edge" with Lookout records' pop-punk sensation, The Mr. T.
Experience.
Intermission: Why did you pick up guitar in the first place?
Dick Dale: The first reason was because I loved country music, and
Hank Williams was my big hero. I was kind of a sentimentalist, a roman
tic, and I loved singing songs like "Why'd Ya Leave Me Today." That's
always been my secret dream, to be a country singer. I was raised listen
ing to big band with my dad's records, and Gene Cooper was the man
who gave me the feelings of my rhythm. That's why my rhythm is so pri
mal. Stuff like "Dikka-de-GA!" That heavy, pulsating, tribal sound. I
applied the rhythm later to the guitar and everything else I play.
I: Is guitar your favorite instrumenti
DD: If I had to pick my favorite instrument, it would be the piano. I
like to play everything from classical to Jerry Lee Lewis to Liberacci.
I: What's your favorite style to play in?
DD: I've been involved with every style of music, and there's beauty in
everything if you want to look for it, which I try to do. In fact, my music
is nothing but a convention of my frustration, my sadness, my happiness,
all these things that come from people, from people's ways of life, people
who've been totally screwed over on this planet. It's an attitude, instead of
trying to play to the musical world of musicians, who say, "Oh, boy, could
you play this augmented 9th?" I could give a shit about that. All I do is get
sounds from ... going through the last flood, sounds from people being
massacred or from people being screwed over by the system. And then
when you find somebody beautiful or you're looking at a flower, then you
write a song like "Esperanza." My music is nothing but a reflection of
people's emotions, people's ways of life and their hardships, everywhere
I've been.
I: Do you use music theory or do you play by ear?
DD: Oh, I can't even play the scale.

I: Everything from listening?
DD: Every instrument I've ever learned to play has been strictly by ear.
The grassroots people don't know what an augmented 9th or a 13th is
and neither do I, and who cares? As long as I give them a feeling.
I: How did you go from playing a little bit of surf guitar in 1954 to
being called the "Father of Heavy Metal" by Guitar Player magazinef
DD: Guitar Player magazine calls me the "Father of Heavy Metal" now,
but back in 1954 nobody played loud because it was considered "impo
lite." But electronically, they couldn't do it anyway. They were governed by
the levels of transformers and speakers, little 10-watt, 6-inch speakers.
Nobody was really a power player. There was no such thing as being a
power player because you didn't have the equipment to play that way, and
everyone who played, played through acoustic guitars and stand-up bass
es. In the days when Chuck Berry was playing, and guys like Les Paul, they
were playing eloquently, musically. Berry was going "dundun-dundun
dundun-dundun" through teeny little amplifiers because he was mainly
playing with his voice. They didn't have the electronics in that era. But
because I was raised listening to Gene Cooper and drums were my first
instrument, I wanted to get very tribal and get that sound coming out of
an amplifier. Of course, I was singing Hank Williams tunes at that time
and putting a little bit of rock into it. And I was calling it "rockabilly" at
that time, but that term wasn't even used. So I met Leo Fender when I
came to California and told him that I had no money and what I wanted
to do, and he said, "Why do you have to play so loud?" Because all of the
people were soaking up the sound when I played, so we created the first
large-scale amplifier that had a 100-watt peak. So that's how Dick Dale
became the "Father of Heavy Metal."
I: Do you still like heavy metal? Do you enjoy playing or listening to
that kind of music?
DD: The music I play isn't heavy metal, but it is loud. I was in Holland,
and the promoter was being hauled off to jail about twenty minutes into
the show. And they sent a note up to me, a letter that says, "Dick Dale,
they're taking me away to jail because your music is too loud into the
buildings over across the side of the mountainside." And he says, "But
keep playing! Keep playing! I love it! I will go to jail!" And, of course, I
told the people that I had to get quiet, and I turned down a little bit.
I: How would you classify Dick Dale music?
DD: When I play to 500,000 people [not a misprint] in Europe at the
Woodstock-type festivals, I'm still playing the same music that I've been
playing since 1954. But when "Nitro" came out at KOSF in San Francisco,
the alternative grunge rock station made Dick Dale number 1, and all of
a sudden Dick Dale becomes alternative grunge. They had me number 1,
and I'd never heard of one band beneath me on the chart. In Texas they
call it Dick Rock, in Europe they call it garage rock. They call it everything
but surf music because in Europe surf music has a different connotation.
Then one time they fly me out to do a concert with Buddy Guy, and they
call it the blues. I'm playing the same music through the same original
stuff that Leo Fender created for me.
I: So you helped invent the famous Fender Stratocasters and Fender
Amps?
DD: Everything that came out of Fender's head was because of Dick
Dale. Leo Fender created what they call the Telecaster guitar for country
