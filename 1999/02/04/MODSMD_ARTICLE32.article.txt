players, for chicken plucking, real pretty sound. Then, the Stratorcaster
was created for a punch, the same way with the precision bass, a real
punch. And anything else that was made was made for different reasons,
but the Statocaster was the true rock guitar because the theory was the
thicker the wood the more powerful the sound. And that's what makes me
use these big, thick strings. That gives you the bigger, fatter sound.
I: Besides the huge strings, there's sort of a legend that you don't use
plastic picks because they melt in your hands.
DD: I do use plastic picks, but they are very thick. But I have a pick
holder that has about a dozen picks in it. And especially when I'm playing
a real heavy song, I'll grind three or four picks down in a song, halfway
down. The strings used to break, too; I'd break two or three in a song. And
what would happen there, from playing so fast — it's like taking a
coathanger and bending it back and forth. And when it comes up over the
steel saddle of the guitar, it starts heating up. And I had a special graphite
saddle made by Graphtek that didn't allow the strings to get as hot. What
happens is, they start heating up, and it rubs on the saddle, and they start

turning black and purple. It looks like, you know, you put a torch to

steel and it starts turning purple. And they start softening, and

they'll break like butter. And so I sent the string into the

company, and they said, "You aren't supposed to play

that way." And I said, "Well, screw you, I play the way
I play."

I: What's your approach to songwritingf
DD: Everything I do is spontaneous. In

fact, when we record, nobody knows what
they're gonna do. The guys go, "What are
we gonna do next?" And I'll say,
"Remember when we were in Mississippi,
when we were in that flood? Rememeber
when we were over here? Remember
when these people got screwed here?
Remember when we were in that little
town in South America? Remember when
we were at the mountaintop, and we played

'Esperanza'?" Everything that I do is really
spasmodic, it just comes out of my head as
I'm playing.

I: What about in the live settingf How do you
_ , . ■ . . • "• V: ... . ,

plan that?
DD: We don't rehearse, I don't do any of those things

I do it all on stage. The band knows when to watch, they can

sense when I'm coming out of a turnaround that I might go into

another song, which I love to do. To me, music is nothing but emotion and
an extension of the emotion of the people you're performing for... I don't
play a [set) list. I've always felt that you'd be cheating people. Because these
people, they call themselves "Dick Heads," they'll drive from state to state,
and if they saw me on Tuesday, I don't wanna play the same thing on a
Wednesday because it'd be ho-hum. I play for the fans. That's why when
you go to a Green Day concert you see Green Day people, but when you go
to a Dick Dale concert, you get skinheads, tattoos, body piercers, motorcy
cle jackets, indigenous people and college professors bringing their 7-year-

old kids, saying "Man, I used to go to your dances when I was 14". I appeal
to everyone, because 1 play to everyone.
I: Do you think you're getting better each year, or do you think your
best days are behind you f
DD: Oh, not at all. I've been involved in the martial arts for forty-... I
don't even know how long. And you learn how to focus and what your pri
orities are. Yes, many people deteriorate with age. How many people do
you know that are 50-years-old and are sitting in a goddamn rocking chair
just rotting away? I'll be 62 May 4, and I'm kickin' ass all over the country.
I get up and run every morning. I'm training with my son in the martial
arts three nights a week.
I: Do you think that you can teach music, or is it something that some
people have and others don'tf
DD: I teach music very well. In fact, I teach it better than people who try
to teach people scales. There are people who've been practicing scales for
three years who can't play a song yet. When these people come to me, I

don't charge to do what I do, I just do it to help people. I have them

playing in one day a whole song. It's the route that you take.

My wife tried to play bass, and the teacher gave up on her

because she was tone deaf. So I started teaching her

timing instead. What people don't realize is that
. when they start to play an instrument, if they

were to only learn the rudiments of timing and
rhythm ... it all comes back from the

rhythm.

I: What do you think about popular
bands todayf Somebody like Third Eye
Blind, for example?
DD: Anybody I hear, if I think they're
playing from their heart and their soul
and I see them sweatin', that's all I care
about.

I: What do you listen to nowadays?
DD: I listen to everything. I used to not

pay attention to the lyrics, but now Vince
Gill singing "The Two of Us" makes me cry.

But the compact disc in my player right now is
"Don Juan DeMarco" [Soundtrack]; I love the

' blend of the Spanish music. Tm influenced by all
these different races from all over the world that I visit.

It's like when you go to a foreign country, and you pick up

a little bit of the language. That's what I do with my music. I love

No Doubt, I love the way [Gwen Stefan!) comes across with her voice, I
love Madonna. I love what Madonna stands for. She made everybody look
stupid. I love Aerosmith. But 1 also love the genius of [Eric] Clapton.When
you lose a child, something that's so fucking unreal, but nobody can
understand what that's like, nobody. And yet still maintain himself to be
the gentleman that he Is, and he writes a beautiful song about it. I love the
twang in Randy Travis' voice. Everything from classical to [classical gui
tarist Andres) Segovia, there's almost nothing that I don't like, that I don't
get goosebumps from.

get goosebumps from.
