# Blink-182
## Music/Theater Buddha 
### 
In 1995, three guys from San Diego, fresh from
forming their band Blink six months earlier,
rented some studio time and recorded fifteen
24-track songs to be distributed on a limited cas
sette tape release. The album had no title, just a pic-

ture of a Buddha on the
cover, and sales were less
than impressive. The songs
were mostly about girls, or
more specifically, about how
they couldn't get girls, and
the names of Mark Hoppus

(bass), Tom Delonge (guitar) and Scott Raynor
(drums) meant nothing to the fledgling SoCal
melodic punk rock scene.
Jump ahead to 1999. Blink has added "182" to
their name in response to a Swedish band of the
same name threatening to sue and has received
heavy radio and MTV rotation for their singles
"Dammit" and "Josie." They are sponsored by
Billabong and other surf / skate companies, sell out
arena shows where pubescent teenage girls scream
out their names and have a major label record deal,
acting as an almost textbook example of a music
industry success story. The recent trend of punk and
ska popularity amongst the mainstream, of course,
is also a large part of their triumph.
All of this popularity has afforded them the lux
ury of going back to their old "Buddha" material,
digitally remixing and remastering it and putting it
on compact disc through the indie label Kung Fu
Records. Eight of the songs can be found in better
produced versions on their album "Cheshire Cat,"
an album that appeared soon after the original
"Buddha."
These songs are very representative of Blink's
straightforward melodic style of punk, with nasally
vocals and ever-hyper drum beats. Admittedly, this
is not the '80s style punk sound that defined the
genre, but rather the new school '90s style that's
more listener-friendly with its bass-heavy and har
mony-oriented sound.
And that's not to say that this is not good stuff in
its own right.
If you're looking for more of the over-produced
Blink songs that appear on their MCA major label
debut, "Dude Ranch," the "Buddha" album is not for
you. Songs like "Time" and "21 Days" stray from the
typical Blink sound, which is why they might have
been left off the "Cheshire Cat" album. These songs
are slower, with scattered hints of ska riffs and emo
rock. On the other hand, "Point of View" is short,
punky, fast and furious — a wonderful example of
their older stylings. Their rendition of the
Screeching Weasel song, "The Girl Next Door," also
demonstrates the high level of energy present
throughout most of the album.
The absence of the song "Degenerate," which was
on the original Buddha tape, can be attributed to
MCA now owning the rights to the song, as it
appeared on "Dude Ranch". The songs "The Family
Next Door" and "Transvestite," also on the original
Buddha album, have been dropped for purportedly
being "joke" songs; however, "The Girl Next Door"
and "Don't" have been added to the album and can
not be found elsewhere.
Overall, this is an album that can be recognized as
a band just beginning to come together; it also
shines because of this. Give it a listen and hear Blink
grow up before your ears.
