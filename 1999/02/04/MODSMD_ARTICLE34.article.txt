# 'Juno' and the unlucky clovers
## Tenement Farce 
### 
If you've ever seen a movie about Ireland, especially one starring Daniel Day-
Lewis, chances are you're familiar with what goes on in Sean O'Casey's "Juno
and the Paycock." A poor Irish family. A flamboyant, alcoholic father. A
strong-hearted mother. The IRA. Regret.
It sounds like great material for a knee-slapping farce, right? "A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to Me Poor Son's Funeral." Well, in so far as comedies have
happy endings, "Juno" is not a comedy. And in so far as comedies are supposed
to be humorous, this production of "Juno" is not very comedic. Yet the American
Conservatory Theater advertises "Juno" as "An Irish Comedy of Epic
Proportions." The majority of the play is spent trying to squeeze laughter out of
the audience by any means available — prat-falls, silly gestures, silly expressions,
spitting food. OK, the spitting food part was funny.
The A.C.T. reminds us several times before intermission that "Juno" is not pure
farce. The play begins with police brutality; later, a funeral marches past the

Boyles' tenement. In the play's most sincere, if shortest
performance, Mrs. Tancred (Sharon Lockwood)
describes the feelings of a mother who has lost her son
to the Irish conflict. But these reminders are few and
seem to have no organic relation to the madcap high
jinks they interrupt. In order for the immensely tragic
ending of the play to work, the audience must feel some

real, human connection with the characters during the play's first half. Without
this connection, the ending seems sudden, arbitrary and melodramatic.
Having said this, "Juno" is also supposed to be funny, and occasionally it was
thanks to the expressive performances of Robin Pearson Rose as Juno Boyle and
Charles Dean as her husband, "Captain" Jack Boyle, the strutting peacock of the
play's title. The problem came from performers like Geoff Hoyle, who played
"Joxer" Daly, the Captain's sidekick. I don't want to blame him personally for
ruining every scene he was in; maybe the director, Giles Havergal, told him to
perform the way he did. I wrote down a note during intermission: "Joxer mug
ging as though in a mime show." After reading Hoyle's bio, it turns out that,
indeed, he is a mime. This would explain why he wore white gloves and stood in
a crouch through the entire play. I expected him at any moment to start tugging
on an imaginary rope or doing the "I'm trapped in a glass box" routine. Sorry,
Geoff: I wouldn't be so rude if there were any chance of your reading this, but
sadly, your performance set the somewhat hollow tone of the show.
I just hope that A.C.T. doesn't punch up the comedic subtext of "Long Day's
Journey Into Night" later this season.
