# ROLLING STONES
## Live at the San Jose Arena Concert 
### 
Ever since the early '70s, people have accused the Rolling
Stones of that most cardinal sin within the rock 'n' roll
universe — professionalism. Instead of retiring graceful
ly, these seasoned veterans choose to carry on with tradition,
using their talent and experience to cover for their loss of inspi
ration. This decision to continue playing keeps the money
flowing into the band's pockets, but old-age jokes and critical
cynicism toward the band are also the inevitable by-product.
Indeed, the regularity with which the band churned out
their work has had an assembly-line feel to it; every three years
they put out a mediocre — or occasionally good — studio
album, followed by another record-setting tour, accompanied
by an inconsistent live album. Only the clash of egos between
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in the '80s broke up this pat
tern to any significant degree.
Times, however, seem to be changing. In 1995, they released
"Stripped," a semi-unplugged live album from the Voodoo
Lounge tour, which reflected a revelation — when they con
centrate on their best music and perform in smaller venues, the
Stones can still cut any other band. This time around, the
Bridges to Babylon tour and its corresponding live album, "No
Security," has received some of the band's best accolades in
decades. Finally they are playing again as if they have some
thing to prove.
Now, the Rolling Stones are fully breaking from their usual
business patterns by repeating their recent tour in smaller
venues, which promises a more intimate setting and a more
adventurous set list. This No Security tour kicked off Monday,
Jan. 25, in Oakland Arena — which was surreal in contrast to
the Oakland Coliseum, where they had played four sold-out
concerts with Pearl Jam less than 400 yards away just 14
months ago. Many concert-goers, including myself, felt an
acute sense of "deja vu" as they approached the complex.
However, while the best seats at the previous concerts went for
about $75, the price of this show started at $300. In other
words, the Rolling Stones are testing the dedication of their fan
base; not too many bands can repeat a tour and charge four
times as much. Indeed, maybe not even the Stones, as the
demand for this tour has not been exactly overwhelming. A
friend of mine could get no higher than $240 from the scalpers
for $480 worth of tickets on the night of the concert, and their
remaining appearances at the San Jose Arena were not sold out
as of a week ago.
Thus, the Stones appear to be at a crossroads. This new tour
is either the most embarrassing episode of the band's "quest for
the almighty dollar," or a spontaneous, priceless departure
from their usual professional routine. Their stadium-size
opener "Jumpin' Jack Flash" suggested the former, but the lat
ter possibility quickly emerged as the Stones delivered power
ful performances of album track classics "Live With Me,"
"Shine A Light" and "Respectable." The group continued on to
perform a wonderfully unpredictable assortment of songs,
mixing ripe singles such as "Paint It Black" with real surprises
like "Undercover."
Even their failures were interesting. "Moonlight Mile" had
potential, but it lacked structure and suffered as the guitar
drowned out Jagger's desolate vocals and Charlie Watts' gentle,
insistent drumming. Supposedly, Jan. 25 was the first time the
band had performed the song live, which could certainly
explain some of the awkwardness as Richards did not actually
play on the original track from 1971. In contrast, the band also
performed "Some Girls" for the first time ever, nailing the
song's arrogant sass perfectly.
Richards' mini-set consisted of his outlaw standard, "Before
They Make Me Run"and the vastly underrated "You Got the
Silver." The latter was gorgeous, with his hollowed-out voice

adding rare poignancy to perhaps the Stones' most delicate
ballad. The sight of Richards playing slide guitar with Ronnie
Wood backing him up on pedal steel was heart-warming —
the image was worth all the pyrotechnics of the last tour.
Fortunately, the group's typical production excesses were
held in check for most of the night, the sole exception being a
rubber-barred cage which unfortunately failed to keep the
hyperactive Jagger contained during a rendition of "Out Of
Control." To their credit, the only aspect from the previous
tour which they repeated was at its best, as they performed a
straight-ahead rock set on a mini-stage in the middle of the
audience. This time around, the group played ferocious ver
sions of two rock / blues standards from their 1964 debut,
"Route 66" and"I Just Want To Make Love To You." They fin
ished with a perfect version of "Honky Tonk Women" — with

no room to prance,
Jagger was forced to
watch Watts' irre
pressible swing and
Richards' sinister riff
ing, producing the
concert's most unfor
gettable moment.
After this triumph,
the band returned to
the main stage and
promptly devolved
into stadium mode,
finishing the concert
with the typical hits —
"Start Me Up," "It's
Only Rock 'n' Roll" and
the still-worthy "Brown

Sugar." As they had spent
most of the concert exploring the depth of the prolific Jagger /
Richards repertoire, this conservative strategy came off like a
shallow attempt to please the casual fan. On the other hand,
they should receive some credit for having the courage not to
play "Satisfaction."
In contrast, the encore was an artistic triumph — a menac
ing version of "Midnight Rambler" followed by the perenially
caustic "Sympathy For The Devil." This pair of songs stands as
the Stones' most penetrating exploration of humanity's dark
side, but in past tours the brutal honesty of their message has
been ruined by inflatable devils and other such embarrass
ments. Fortunately, the Stones utilized the power of minimal
ism this time, with real terror emanating from Jagger's har
monica and Richards' guitar.
Overall, the concert was a conspicuous attempt by the group
to reclaim their legacy. As the Beatles began to implode in the
late '60s, the Stones produced an improbable string of albums
which are now essential to any understanding of rock 'n' roll.
Their first 10 albums were mostly respectable RBcß filler pep
pered with classic rock singles, but with "Beggar's Banquet"
through "Exile On Main Street," they produced a solid collec
tion of work without a single ounce of fat. At this concert, the
Stones performed half their songs from these four albums and
their latter-day classic "Some Girls." If the Stones are to be
remembered in a hundred years for being more than a great
singles act, it will be because of those five albums. If the group
was at a crossroads when planning this tour, they have chosen
the right path. This round of concerts is a gift for fans who
want one last glimpse at the group's greatest legacy. May it not
be forgotten.
