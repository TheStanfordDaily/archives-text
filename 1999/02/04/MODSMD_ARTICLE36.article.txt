# 'All that' and a bag of sucks
## Film 'She's All That’ isn't much 
### 
If "Clueless" was an update of Jane Austen's "Emma," then "She's All
That" is the '90s version of "Pygmalion" (a.k.a. "My Fair Lady"). But
you don't have to be an Audrey Hepburn fan to figure out the plot of
this movie; it's much too predictable for all that. The only shocker is that
this corny teenage-romance flick is being distributed by Miramax.
Here's the familiar setup: Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.), senior class
president and all-around stud at Harrison High, has lost his babe-a-licious

girlfriend Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) only a few
weeks before graduation. Being the natural pick
for prom king, Zack boasts to his best friend
Dean (Paul Walker) that he can turn any girl in
the school into his queen. The bet is on, and
Dean picks loser-art-geek Laney Boggs (Rachel
Leigh Cook) as Zack's target of conquest I bet

you can't guess what happens from here.
Laney sheds her glasses and baggy clothes and turns into a social butter
fly, and she helps Zack discover his artistic side and self-confidence. Laney
is on her way to becoming a prom queen, but first she has to deal with
mega-bitch Taylor. Meanwhile, Dean is willing to do some pretty under
handed deeds to win his bet.
Miramax is trying to sell "She's All That" as a John Hughes-type film for

the '90s. But perhaps director Robert Iscove and writer Lee Fleming forgot
that we can connect with movies like "The Breakfast Club" because they
take place in the suburban Midwest, not glitzy Southern California.
Harrison High is a haven for rich, spoiled teens, where Usher Raymond
announces updates on the popular kids over the RA. system.
This movie fails partly because of bad casting. Cook, who gives Laney
some decent depth, is still too good-looking — even with glasses — to play
the part of a geek. Prinze is stand-offish and sometimes too goofy to be the
prom king type. LiT Kim, who is billed highly in the previews and one
sheets, has few lines and seems to exist only to represent the "young black
female."
The only solid performance comes from Matthew Lillard, playing an ex
"Real World" star who has taken his newfound celebritydom to wacky
heights. When the audience knows how a movie will end even before they
get to the theater, the filmmakers can still make the movie a success by
cooking up some clever in-between sequences.
Unfortunately, "She's All That" leaves us with little to remember but a
Sixpence None the Richer song and a disgusting scene involving pubic hair
and pizza. This movie will draw its target audience — teenagers — and no
one else, and perhaps that's the way it was meant to be.
