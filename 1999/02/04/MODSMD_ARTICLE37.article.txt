# Life is horrible
## Like father, like 'Affliction’ 
### 
Roughly halfway through
"Affliction," Nick Nolte takes
a drink of whiskey and pulls
a sore tooth out of the back of his
mouth with a pair of pliers. This
scene captures the film's essence:
self-hatred and frustration explod
ing into violence. Whenever writer
and director Paul Schrader (who
wrote "Taxi Driver" and "Raging
Bull") deals with men beating them
selves up, you can expect something
tragic.
Nolte received a Golden Globe
nomination for his work in
"Affliction" as Wade Whitehouse, a
small-town New Hampshire sheriff

whose life is

going
nowhere.
Wade's

ex-wife
thinks he's

an alcoholic
failure and

tries

throughout the film to remove him
from their daughter Jill's life.
Wade's only comfort in the world
comes from Margie (Sissy Spacek),
the angelically tolerant girlfriend
whom he considers marrying sim
ply to improve his chances of seizing
custody of Jill.
Wade is such a Type-A male that
he eats salt straight out of the shak
er — you expect him to collapse
from a heart-attack at any moment.
Nolte brings him to bearish life as
few other actors could, alternating

between frantic
anger and .

hopeless
depression in

th e

course of seconds.
But the best acting in the film
comes from James Coburn as Glen,
Wade's abusive and alcoholic father.
In flashbacks to Wade's childhood,
Coburn captures Glen's animal
rages without ever losing the occa
sional, almost invisible, touches of
regret that make Glen human,
rather than simply a caricature.
"Affliction" was adapted from
Russell Banks' PEN / Faulkner
nominated novel. It has many of the
drawbacks that often occur when a
lengthy book is edited to two hours
of sound and pictures. For example,
the essential story of

the film — the
one you think
about when you
leave the the
ater — is Wade's

slow, violent descent into the abu
sive behavior for which he has
always hated his father.
But Schrader has also kept an
unrelated subplot from the book, a
story narrated by Wade's brother
(Willem Defoe) about a deer-hunt
ing accident that Wade thinks is evi
dence of a conspiracy. It's so irrele
vant to the heart of the film that it
almost operates like a mediocre par
allel narrative to the film's powerful
main story.
While "Affliction" is not as artful
or moving as last year's "The Sweet
Hereafter" (also based on a Banks
novel), because of its masterful act
ing it will grab you in ways that few
films can. Look for Nolte and
Coburn at the Oscars.
