# Enemymine
## Self – Titled CD/EP 
### 
Bass players usually get the raw end of the rock deal. They
have to carry around the heaviest instrument and actual
ly communicate with the drummer, while the prima
donna guitar player gets to "emote" and play with effects ped
als. No wonder rock is gasping for air.
In the early '90s, the bass / drum duo godhead Silo blud
geoned this idea to death, proving that four strings could be
louder, scarier and more interesting than six. Mike Kunka's
ever-expanding bass rig and arsenal of effects pedals confused

many a sound engineer and won
the hearts of indie kids everywhere
with its distinctive sludgy rumble.
Recently, Mike has brought his toys
to a new project, this time with fel
low bass player / vocalist Zak Sally

1 of the seminal slowcore band Low
and drummer Danny Sasaki. The result is Enemymine, whose
self-titled EP unfolds like a narrative, drawing its power as
much from the dynamism between songs as from within them.
The album opens with a liquid tinkling of extraordinarily
guitar-like sounds, a lovely little piece that could almost go in
the "Serene Instrumental Intro" pile if it weren't for the disqui
eting hiss of feedback that slowly rises from the song's center
and washes the notes away. It is a hint of what is to come, the
restless rustling of a machine that is about to crunch. And, one
second later, crunch it does. "Trcr" is as good as godhead Silo's
best, an unapologetic metal riff that tumbles forward into the
sort of distorted melodic blast perfected by their fellow
Olympians, KARP.
Then, as if just to prove that this album is not going to be
what you expected, "The We're All Friends Club" floats in on a
dark sonic duststorm, the vocals thick with slowcore languor.
The storm builds with a melancholy that sounds dangerous,
swelling to an excruciatingly emotive climax. With a wry smile,
all seriousness is then dissolved into a strange, sludgy instru
mental. One of two undeveloped song ideas on the album,
these more experimental moments serve as cushions between
the controlled chaos of "Dent Everything" and the jagged edges
of "No Comply."
Although the album's thrills are in its violent shifts,
Enemymine manage to steer clear of the whisper / ROAR
polarity too dominant in indie rock today. Rather, it darts all
over the musical landscape with an orchestra's worth of nuance
in its two basses and one drum set. It's too bad the musicians
don't spend more time in the album's weirder places, especial
ly the laser land of "I've Got the Ice in Me," but such is the frus
tration of an EP. To see if the stage gives them more room to
roam, check them out at the Bottom of the Hill with Alamont
and Lowercase on Feb. 10.
