# All nerds go to heaven
## Rush for 'Rushmore’ Film/Music 
### 
CC ■yv ushmore" is an entertaining movie — in a weird sort of way.
It's the kind of film that critics will rave about while the mass-
JLV.es scratch their heads. This isn't a movie for everyone because
"Rushmore" centers on those social outcasts we call "nerds." They come in
all shapes and sizes, from Dirk Calloway (Mason Gamble), a fourth-grad
er who runs around in a wizard costume, to Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka),

a high-school student whose science project nearly gets bought by the Navy.
Leading the pack with great flair is Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a lOth-grader who is really
into his private school, Rushmore Academy. He's an officer or member of every extracurricular activ
ity under the sun, and his grades are failing as a result (this should sound familiar to many Stanford
students).
As if he didn't have enough distractions, Max meets Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a young first
grade teacher at Rushmore. In spite of her protests that he's too young for her, Max gives her a lot of
attention, going as far as to build a large aquarium in her honor — on Rushmore's baseball diamond.
This is the last straw for the administrators, who promptly expel Max. Ousted from his beloved
Rushmore, he now has to deal with life in a public high school. To make things worse, Miss Cross is
developing a relationship with Max's good friend and mentor, Mr. Blume (Bill Murray).
With a character as dweeby as Max in the role of protagonist, it's tough to keep the audience

charmed. But "Rushmore" successfully rides the edge of comedy;

moments that could easily be labeled stupid somehow turn out to be

laugh-out-loud funny. For filmmakers Wes Anderson and Owen
> Wilson, this will be a tough act to follow.

"Rushmore" also has some great acting in the woodworks.
Schwartzman makes a great debut, and Williams is adorable as Miss

Cross. Gamble, who made his

start as the lead in "Dennis

the Menace," proves

his mettle as an up
and-coming talent.

" Murray carries away
the laughter and sympa-

thy of the audience

as Mr. Blume;

his perfor-

mance has

.already

garnered
t him a few

awards
among
critics.
The last

thing to

mention is
L Max's stage

productions.
You see, Max is

a budding
playwright on

top of every
thing else, and

although his
plays are gen
erally awful,
they are a joy

to watch.
"Rushmore"
makes us
appreciate
those little
attempts at
creativity; this
may be the

last original
thing we see
this year.
