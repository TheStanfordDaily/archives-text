Stress is higher because of midterms.
Relationships seem to take the back
burner to academics. Counseling and
Psychological Services is offering a group
designed to target relationship problems
such as making close friends, dealing with
roommates, family and significant others,
or simply approaching professors.
Beginning tonight, a group called

Enhancing Interpersonal Relationships
will begin meeting Thursday evenings
on the second floor of C'owell, from 6:15
to 7:45 p.m. Facilitated by Eric Bassman
and Lynn Planchon, fellows at CAPS,
the group is free and open to both un
dergraduate and graduate students with
a whole range of interpersonal con
cerns,
This group, which lias been run in pre
vious years, was initiallv offered last

quarter, but was postponed because not
enough students attended to continue it
through the quarter. According to Bass
man. CAPS has seen a decline in student
involvement in CAPS over recent years.
Currently, most groups at CAPS focus
on more specific problems, such as eating
disorders or procrastination. This group
is an attempt to include a wider range of
students and "reach a broad base of the
Stanford community.. .everyone's inter

ested in relationships."
There is a broad range of possible is
sues covered. "The big tiling tends to be
people who have difficulty meeting other
people.. .and forming interpersonal rela
tionships that will be lasting and mean
ingful," said Planchon.
Largely driven by the concerns and in
terests of participants, the group will look
at themes across different relationships
as well as more specific examples.
