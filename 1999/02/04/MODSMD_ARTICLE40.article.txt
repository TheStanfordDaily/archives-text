# Love and valour on the 'Line'
## Malick's awesome film unfortunately drags Film 
### 
Film classes must be going
wild. Weeks can be devoted to
alternate dream worlds
("Pleasantville" and"The Truman
Show"), insects ("A Bug's Life" and
"Antz") and now World War 11.
With Spielberg's "Saving Private
Ryan" cleaning up the summer box
office, Terence Malick's "The Thin
Red Line" had high hopes of pro
viding another brilliant view of war
during the winter season. While the

The Thin Red Line

nearly three
hour run-time
makes the
entire process a
tiresome one,
the ride does
provide some

spectacular footage of tropical
forests and a barrage of perfor
mances which mostly meld togeth
er into a coherent cinematic dis
play.
Out of all the characters, it's
clear that Nick Nolte is the star
here. His turn as the frustrated Lt.
Col. Gordon Tall made me feel his
anguish and disappointment at
never being able to fight in a war
(until World War II). He delivers a
scene perfectly in which he orders a
front-side attack on a Guadalcanal
hill — only to have the command
ing officer, Capt. Staros (Elias
Koteas), seriously question his
authority. A sequence certainly
done with a sure hand.
Less assured are the constant
voice-overs from Privates Bell (Ben
Chaplin) and Witt (Jim Caviezel).
They often posit philosophical
questions about the meaning of
life, war, love and nature as they
stroll through misty jungles or
attempt to go to sleep in rain
soaked tents. It wears thin for the

viewer, and it makes the movie feel
even longer than it is.
Sean Penn is fairly compelling as
First Sgt. Edward Welsh, a pes
simistic, soulless man who has
become the antithesis of civility. He
is the military paradigm — a per
son without any regard for destruc
tion, death or love.
John Cusack's character, Capt.
Gaff, has a brief moment of glory
when he leads a bold charge up an
embankment held by the Japanese.
Gary Oldman, Woody Harrelson,
Jared Leto, John Travolta, Adrien
Brody and an out-of-place George
Clooney appear briefly with bit
roles.
Malick has emerged from
decades of hibernation with an
apparent epic. The number of sol
diers in the movie rivals Spielberg's
war film, but part of the problem
here is that the characters are rela
tively indistinguishable from each
other. That may be one of the
points he's trying to make, but it
still confuses the viewer as to who is
leading what company.
Equally tasking is the pacing of
the movie. I really wanted to like it,
and I did like the realistic portrayal
of ground battle. Camera shots
often pointed upward at the vast
overhang of trees and its diverse
range of inhabitants.
"The Thin Red Line" is based on
James Jones' 1962 autobiographical
novel. Malick has performed a ter
rific duty in presenting a comple
mentary war picture to "Saving
Private Ryan." While flawed, "The
Thin Red Line" is a fascinating,
introspective look at the people
behind the guns in World War 11.
