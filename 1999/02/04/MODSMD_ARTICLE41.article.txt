# A 						lost child in Rio
## Intriguing characters fill ‘Central Station’ 
### 
Presh from its Golden Globe for best foreign language
film, "Central Station" now looks for a wider audi-

JL ence. It should get one. The film feels so
real that the actors jump off the screen in full
emotional detail. Fernanda Montenegro delivers
a particularly feisty performance as the worn
Seriora Dora. She provides a very stable base
around which the rest of the film grows.
Formerly an elementary school teacher, Dora

now lives in a run-down apartment without any friends
aside from Irene (Marilia P£ra), who also lives in the same
complex. Dora tries to make ends meet as a scribe for
Brazil's corrupt postal system. Instead of mailing those let
ters, she reads them with Irene and either stuffs them in her
top drawer or throws them away in the garbage. (I hope
our local post office refrains from reading our mail.)
One day, she runs into Josue (a genuinely entertaining
Vinicius de Oliveira), a young orphaned boy. It takes some
time for Josue and Dora, who informally adopts him, to get
along since both of them are so stubborn.
The crux of "Central Station" is the search for Josue's
father. They start in Rio de Janeiro, but they slowly enter
the rural back-country via bus, truck and whatever other
mode of transportation they can afford. Scenes of religious
masses and open marketplaces make the trip seem almost
educational. But the key is that it's presented in a way that
forces us to delve further into the Brazilian world of
Catholicism and petty thievery. Director Walter Salles Jr.
has wisely juxtaposed these two contradicting elements —
perhaps as a jab at Brazil itself.
"Central Station" has much the same feel as "Kolya," the
winner of the 1996 Oscar for best foreign language film. In
"Kolya," an older man is forced to undergo many changes
in order to adjust to the sudden appearance of a young boy.
A similar plot unfolds here. Dora is very hesitant to take in
Josue — she even sells him to a child agency for $ 1,000 —
but every time she begins to lose her nerve, she realizes how
much she truly cares for him.
Dora is a very complex and intriguing character, and
Montenegro fleshes her out in full glory, wrinkles and all.
We sense that Dora has had a tough life of forlorn love and
hard work. Yet she is slowly transformed, if only temporar
ily, by Josue and his probing questions. "Central Station"
questions our memory of people in our lives, both in the
past and in the present, and it makes you want to hold on
to those who truly do mean something.
