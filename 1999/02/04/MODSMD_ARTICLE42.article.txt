## 'Furioso' Lively Arts 
### 
It should have been astonishing.
The notion of an aerial dance piece
is immediately alluring, opening
up the vertical plane to an art form
whose upper bound is typically the
highest height a dancer can leap. In
"Furioso," the piece performed by the
Meryl Tankard Australian Dance
Theater for Stanford Lively Arts, ropes
were suspended from the ceiling,
allowing the dancers a vertiginous
range of swoops and twirls rarely seen
outside a big-ring circus.
Yet the choreography, overall, was
disappointingly commonplace. An
overarching problem was the absence
of a unifying vision to synthesize the
elements of the program. During the
Q & A session which followed the per
formance, choreographer Tankard
detailed the inspirations for "Furioso."
As part of her choreography process,
she asked the dancers questions such
as "What do you do when you are los
ing something you love?" She went on
to describe a set of exercises which she
termed the "Plague questions," in
which her dancers faked reactions to
attacks by mice, crocodiles and bees.
However, the connection between
lost love and a swarm of yellow jackets
was not immediately obvious, and
unfortunately, the organization of
"Furioso" did little to draw together
these disparate choreographic ele
ments. Instead, the piece vacillated
between the "Plague" fragments
(replete with flailing limbs and frenet
ic charges across the stage) and the
aerial sequences. In the latter, the
inventive conceit of aerial dance was
confined by Tankard's use of a heavily
gendered dance vocabulary, reliant on
stereotypes of male and female desire.
Furthermore, the post-apocalyptic fla
vor of the mise-en-scene, suggesting a
gutted factory left to rust in rain, was
let down by a drearily pre-lapsarian
vision of sexuality, spotlighting female
passivity and masculine aggression.
Women hung doll-like from ropes,
their bodies manipulated by the earth
bound men. The choreography occa
sionally flared into a heady burst of
swirling movements, but more often
the ropes were treated as glorified
swing sets with the dancers crudely
miming intercourse and release.
The overall effect was that of wast
ed opportunity. The sparkling profi
ciency of the dancers was dulled by the
unimaginative choreography; the aeri
al realm, too, was badly underutilized
in a discordant set of works by Port,
Sharp and Gorecki. Rambling and dis
jointed, "Furioso" failed to match the
brilliance of its original inspiration.
