The much-beloved Emerson String
Quartet played to a full house in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Jan. 27,
delighting the audience with masterful rendi
tions of works by Mozart, Sibelius and Dvorik.
Founded in 1976, the quartet took its name
from the Tiranscendcntalist poet and philoso
pher Ralph Waldo Emerson. The ensemble is
perhaps best-known for its recent recording of
16 Beethoven quartets, which has been lauded
as the definitive recording of the composer's
"Everest" of string quartets. Though
Beethoven's works were absent from the Lively
Arts program, the craftsmanship for which
those recordings are renowned was evident
throughout the performance.
The program began with W. A. Mozart's
String Quartet in F Major, K. 590. Written in
the final years of Mozart's life, this piece is
notable for its strikingly prominent cello parts.
Cellist David Finckel ably managed his central
role, and his playing was especially notable in
the "Menuetto: Allegretto."
Next, the quartet performed "Intimate
Voices" by the Finnish composer Jean
Sibelius. The piece represents a shift in
Sibelius' work: Keith Chapin explains in the
program notes that "rather than setting up
an architecture of clearly articulated phras
es, the music spins forth in waves" The
organic nature in this piece was beautifully
matched by the interplay between the musi

cians. Musical themes were effortlessly
passed from player to player, yielding a love
ly, finely woven rendition of the work.
Antonin Dvorak's Quartet in C Major, Op.
61 finished the program. Grounded in the pat
terns of European classical music, Dvorik
experimented with Czech folk themes and
motifs, creating a sound that is at once univer
sal and national in character. The quartet
played the piece with authority in a perfor
mance that was crisply articulated — though
not at the expense of an evocative coloration.
The audience responded with extended
applause, and the quartet rewarded their
enthusiasm with an encore from Schubert, pro
viding the capstone to an evening of exception
al music.
