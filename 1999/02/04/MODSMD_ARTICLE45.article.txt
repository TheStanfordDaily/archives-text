Dear Hoxy,
I've alwayt been attracted to older men,
now I'm seeing someone who is 11 yetm
older than me, and everyone thinks I'm crazy.
Why are Americans so afraid of inter-genera
tional sext Do you think there's anything
wrong with dating alder menf
— «I>oloret*
l h\ir Dolores,
Miss las* once knew a gym teacher, let's call
him Mr. Agee, who had a penchant for dating
younger women. In fact, he enjoyed using Jus
gym classes at the junior high as his personal
dating pool, and he eventually went On to marry
one of his student* after sft£ graduated from
high school.
Now this was quite the scandal, as you can ■
imagine, and it is exactly this type of thing that
taints the idea of dating inter-genera tionally, It
seems a lot of us know a Mr. Agee, a man who
fits well into our ready-made categories of
"attempting to recapture his youth," "tabling a
trophy bride" or "trying to prove something."
But Miss Sass would argue that in most normal
circumstances (read: between legal adults), we
too readily assign the label of "cradle robber"
and stamp both members of such a union as
deviant and maladjusted.
The truth is, the drive that pairs young
women and older men can lead to some hearti
ly fruitful relationships. The man benefits, nat
urally, from the company of a young (and there
fore attractive) woman and is also re-energized
by her vitality. The woman, on the other hand,
enjoys how suave and worldly the man is. In the
best of worlds, the relationship is mutually
advantageous, with a sprinkling of ego boost for
both.
As for the vex, Miss Sass has it on good
authority that it ages quite well. A source who
dated a man only five years younger than her
father said that her partner was heads above the
rest in bed, so to Speak. His years of past experi
ence had let him refine his sexual tastes, while
keeping his sense of curiosity and adventure
intact. She said he was her most attentive lover,
more generous and much more interested in
her pleasure than past lovers had been. In short,
he "treated he* like gold" a quality she thinks
applies to many relationships between an older
man and a younger woman. The man is so glad
to have the v&man, she says, that he savors her
like a fine wine rather than chugging her like a
cheap beer.
She also found that her partner's advanced
age made the whole sexual process last longer.
The mechanics of being an older man demand
a little more prep time before actual intercourse,
and the consequently increased foreplay often
suits the woman fine. And because it takes him
longer to achieve that erection, he won't be so
quick to it away.
Sex becomes, for him, more of a journey than
a destination to apply the time-worn phrase.

Younger men, on the other hand, have erections
aplenty and so have no qualms about going off
like bottle rockets at the slightest whisper.
Of course, a downside to these April
-1 December pairings does exist and deserves
llpention. First off, one must stop to consider
PWhat kind of older man dates someone consid
erably younger. When Miss Sass was a mere 17,
she dated a 29-year-old. Admittedly, she found
the whole affair to be rather cosmopolitan but
looking back she wonders about the mental
development of her time-seasoned fellow — a
man who had a dozen years' distance from high
school but a similar maturity level. A youthful
mindset IS one thing but stunted development is
entirely another.
Second, dating between decades will make
both people's age come into sharp, uncomfort
able focus. While the man nostalgically eyes the
woman's wrinkleless skin and perky
appendages, the woman sees her own future in
his doughy paunch and liver spots. One woman,
who married a man 32 years her senior, says
that now that he's 79, his skin feels creepy when
they have sex and she has to check for a pulse
every morning. Confronting the ravages of time
is a necessary and unpleasant side effect of this
type of dating.
And finally, a young lady always runs the risk
of being the Little Red Riding Hood to the older
man's wolf and lumberjack fantasies.
Remember our earlier source with the fatherly
boyfriend? Apparently his lusty imagination /
gave birth to some fairly sordid and kinky role*
playing games in which the young woman felt [
obliged to star. So don't be surprised when your
dapper gent shows up with a diaper for you and 5
a "World's Best Dad" apron for himself.
On the whole, however, Miss Sass thinks you
should let the relationship, not your friends*
dictate how things progress. Granted, with thif
older man you are choosing a relationship that
has complications separate and additional t<j>
the normal ones that go along with dating. And
you may find that his mid-life crisis, his bald
head or his questionable bed antics may eventu
ally lead you into the muscular arms of a
younger man. But then again, maybe not. For
now, uncork the Viagra and get going. Time's a
wasting.
