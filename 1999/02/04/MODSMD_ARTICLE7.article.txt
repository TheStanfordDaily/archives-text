# Quilt memorializes Stanford faculty
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
This week, former Stanford fac
ulty and alumni who died of AIDS
are being honored and commemo
rated through an AIDS Memorial
Quilt at the Sacred Heart Preparato
ry school in Atherton. Among those
honored are former Classics Prof.
Jack Winkler and Arturo Islas, a
Stanford alumnus, a former Stan
ford English professor and a fre
quent guest lecturer at Sacred Heart.
Sacred Heart is displaying four
quilts in total, aiming to heighten
awareness of and discussion about
the disease that is the leading cause
of death among Americans between
the ages 25 to 44.
"We're hoping to create a more
tactile relationship for the students
and bring the issue closer," said
Cheryl Sharpley, director of com
munications at Sacred Heart. "The
powerful point of it is asking the
kids, What do you see? What can
you tell about the person being
memorialized?' in order to draw at
tention to the fact that [the disease]
has not gone away."
The AIDS Memorial Quilt pro
ject, orchestrated by the Names Pro
ject Foundation, is a public aware
ness effort on an international level.
It has been termed the largest public
art project in the world, and was last
displayed in full in 19% in front of
the Capitol in Washington D.C. In
total, the quilts would cover 33 foot
ball fields.

Quilts honor and memorialize
anyone who dies of AIDS. Among
those on quilts are tennis player
Arthur Ashe, attorney Roy Cohn,
performer Liberace, Olympic ath
lete Tom Waddell and A IDS activist
Ryan White.
Islas and Winkler, two of the
many individuals commemorated
on the Stanford quilt on display,
have special meaning to the Sacred
Heart Preparatory because of their
involvement at a personal level with
students and faculty many years ago.
Winkler was a classicist who be
came world-known for his radical
new theory on Greek tragedy and
the shape of the choral dance while
at Stanford.
He also coordinated with Classics
Prof. Marsh McCall for a seminar on
Greek tragedy for the Sacred Heart
faculty years ago.
"He was so brilliant in so many
areas of Greek tragedy," said Mc-
Call, who was chair of the Classics
Department when Winkler was
hired. "He did seminal work on the
ancient novel, seminal work on gen
der and sexuality studies and semi
nal work in a general sense."
According to McCall, people in
the classics world would hear the
name Stanford and say "Oh, that's
where Jack Winkler is."
"He came into a really demand
ing audience here [at Sacred Heart]
and put forward a theory that is so
provocative and gaining more credi
bilty in the classics world," said Sa
cred Heart Dean of Faculty Connie

Solar i.
Winkler came from a unique aca
demic background, having spent a
number of years as a Jesuit priest.
According to McCall, he left the
church ultimately after coming to
terms with his homosexuality, mak
ing the decision to live his version of
an honest life.
Winkler's memorial on the Stan
ford quilt is shared by many other
former colleagues and Stanford
alumni, Islas among them.
Islas, a 1960 Stanford graduate in
English, became a tenured Stanford
professor in 1976. Before his death
in 1991, Islas gave lectures at Sacred
Heart on his book, "The Rain (iod,"
which is still part of the honors cur
riculum there.
His books deal with serious nar
ratives of the life of migrant workers.
"It's amazing how his writing in
corporates comic moments out of
things so tragic," said Solari. "He re
ally balances such tension with the
joy of life," she said.
Islas began lecturing through
program inspired by former Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's ideas of
Stanford professors having more
contact with the community, accord
ing to Solari.
"He was an unconscious artist
who very much enjoyed and respect
ed the kids he worked with," Solari
said, referring to an instance when a
student raised to Islas the power of a
repetitive mention of people's hands
in his writing. His response was to
say, "that's interesting — you know.

I hadn't thought of that myself."
"He was enchanting," Solari said.
"Really one of the most charismatic
people I have known."
Stanford faculty who knew Islas
feel similarly.
"He was the kindest, gentlest per
son I just about ever knew," said
Emeritus English Prof. Nancy Pack
er. "It was perfectly clear that many
students adored Arturo and really
became close friends of his."
English Prof. Diane Middle
brook worked with Islas as well, and
helped to bring his posthumously
published book, "La Mollie and the
King of Tears" to fruition.
"Arturo Islas was a colleague
with the eye and the wit of a novel
ist," Middlebrook said. "He could
make a story out of the way some
body glanced through an open door
or changed a hairstyle."
Islas originally wanted to be a
doctor, but gave up pre-med when
he found his real passion in litera
ture, according to his mother Jovita
Islas.
"He wanted to become a doctor
because he was very curious about
what happened to him," said Ms.
Islas, who reports that her son had
polio as a child.
"[His illness as a child] never de
terred him from swimming, dancing,
bicycling or anything," Ms. Islas
said.
Arturo's death, Feb. 15, 1991, co
incided with his mother's birthday.
"I think about him around this
time every year," Ms. Islas said.
