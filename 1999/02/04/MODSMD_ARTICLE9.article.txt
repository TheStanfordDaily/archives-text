# Fac Sen to discuss End Quarter period
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
The Faculty Senate will convene
tomorrow to discuss primarily revi
sion to the University's current end
quarter policy.
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (C
-AAA) formulated a proposal for
the policy's revision in response to
petitions issued by the Department
of Athletics during winter quarter of
last year.
Present senate policy dictates
that no athletic events except
NCAA Championships may be
scheduled during the end quarter
period. However, members of the
Athletics Department expressed
concern over the policy's violation,
since a number of athletic events
were scheduled during end quarter
and final exam periods.
"Basically, this proposal arose
out of the Athletics Department try
ing to create greater compliance
with the policy," said Hester Gelber,
chair of the C-AAA. "We tried to
make it easier for them to do by
looking into possible changes."
To facilitate the Athletics De

partment's efforts, the C-AAA in
vestigated the impact of altering the
policy so that athletic events could
be scheduled on the Sunday of the
beginning of the end quarter period.
"We're hoping that by having
games scheduled at a convenient
time, the Athletics Department
won't have to petition as much,"
said Gelber. "With less of a need to
petition and the students in a better
position, it will be easier on the
whole for the Athletics Depart
ment."
To determine if this change in
end quarter policy was feasible, C
AA A consulted with the Music and
Drama Departments, as well as stu
dents through the ASSU.
The revision to the policy should
amend the current status of spring
quarter having a shorter end quarter
period than the other two quarters.
Gelber would not speculate on
whether she felt the proposal would
be successful among senate mem
bers at today's meeting.
Other issues that the senate will
discuss include a renewal of the in
terdisciplinary program in Health
Services Research and the High-
Wire Press.
