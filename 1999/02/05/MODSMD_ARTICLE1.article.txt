### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
A Stanford visiting professor
has sparked controversy by form
ing a group to unseat Republican
U.S. Representative Tom Camp
bell, a Stanford law professor, fol
lowing his vote to impeach the pres
ident.
The informal group, dubbed
"Republicans Against Campbell"
by the media, was initiated by Prof.
Gerald Fisher, former chair of the
physics department at San Francis
co State University. He is a visiting
professor of physics at Stanford.
The New York Times reported
on January 29 that the group "in
cludes 12 professors at Stanford

University." However, Fisher clari
fied yesterday that while the first
meeting consisted of three or four
members of the Stanford faculty,
the second meeting was attended
by eight or more "Stanford peo

pie."
"I was just so upset at [Camp
hell's] vote that I vented my spleen
|by forming this group]." said Fish
er. "It was not just an impeachment
vote; it was a statement.".

Stating that the atmosphere was
"very informal," he declined to
name any other members for priva
cy reasons. Fisher added that the
group was unlikely to meet again,
saying, "academic people do a lot
of talking."
Individuals on campus were
largely unaware that there was a
movement against Campbell un
derfoot.
" There are only 12 Republicans
at Stanford, and I know all of
them," said Political Science Prof.
David Brady, a senior Hoover fel
low. "I know of no such group."
Law School Dean Paul Brest
commented that the Law School
"doesn't have politics either way."
and was not aware of any campus
sentiment against Campbell. Brest
added, "he happens to teach here,
that's all."
