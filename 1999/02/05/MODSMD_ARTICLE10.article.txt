King Hussein goes home in critical condition
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — A hone marrow transplant performed
on King Hussein failed, and the Jordanian leader was being flown
home yesterday from the United States in critical condition.
A statement issued by Hussein's private physician said the 63-year
old monarch's condition "has become critical due to the failure of the
function of internal organs."
The statement by Lt. Gen. Samir Farraj was issued at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester. Minn., where Hussein ha* been since Jan. 25
receiving treatment for a recurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can
cer.
One official said Hussein will be taken upon arrival at the airport to
an Amman military hospital, known as the King Hussein Medical City,
for close medical supervision while his health is deteriorating.
"His body has apparently refused the bone cells taken from his fam
ily members and transplanted into his body," the official said, speak
ing on condition of anonymity.
Hussein underwent his second bone marrow transplant last Tues
day. The cells were taken last December from his younger brother,
Mohammed, and sister, Basma.
Hussein appointed his eldest son. Abdullah, 37, as heir to the
throne. He replaced the king's 51-vear-old brother, Hassan, who had
held the post for 34 years.
Pluto remains a planet — for now
PARIS (AP) — It's official: Pluto is still a planet, and mere mortals
won't change that anytime soon.
The ruling by the world's leading astronomical organization came
amid a brewing cosmic storm among scientists and stargazers, afraid
that the smallest planet in the solar system was being demoted.
News reports had said Pluto was to be demoted to a Minor Planet,
or — worse — a Trans-Neptunian Object.
That simply isn't so, the International Astronomical Union said yes
terday.
"No proposal to change the status of Pluto as the ninth planet in the
solar system has been made by any division, commission or working
group of the lAU responsible for solar system science," said the 80-
year-old organization, the final authority on astronomical matters.
In fact, discussions have been under way on creating a potential
numbering system for Trans-Neptunian Objects and giving Pluto a
number, too.
These objects, which are beyond Neptune in the outer solar system,
have some similarities to Pluto. Including Pluto in a cataloging system
would facilitate the study of such objects.
Scientists and stargazers were aghast at the notion of toying with
Pluto's celestial prestige.
lAU Secretary-General Johannes Andersen said yesterday. "Peo
ple saw it as a sort of attack on Pluto as a planet."
Pluto, with a diameter of 1,491 miles, is by far the smallest of the
nine planets.
Still, debate among astronomers over Pluto's fate is not over.
Andersen said.
