# Lewinsky to appear on tape, not live
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate voted yesterday for video
taped testimony by Monica Lewin
sky in President Clinton's impeach
ment case after dealing a bipartisan
brush-off to a personal appearance.
Parts of her recorded deposition are
to be played at the nationally tele
vised trial session tomorrow.
As lawmakers settled that issue.
Republicans retreated from their
plan to find Clinton guilty of wrong
doing without removing him from
office.
With those decisions, trial-weary
senators moved to wrap up the
impeachment proceeding by the
end of next week.
"I do think it's time we get to a
vote and we move on" to other
issues, said Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
Clinton's acquittal is assured on
the charges of perjury and obstruc
tion of justice, which stem from his
efforts to conceal a sexual relation
ship with Lewinsky.
While Republicans backed away
from their plan to find Clinton
guilty of wrongdoing before the trial
ends. Senate Democratic leader
Tom Daschle said lawmakers in his
party were putting the finishing
touches on a censure proposal. He
said he wants it voted on either dur
ing an interruption in the proceed
ings or after the conclusion.
Under the Senate's decisions
yesterday, prosecutors and White
House lawyers will have up to three
hours each to make presentations
including portions of videotaped
depositions tomorrow.
An effort by the House prosecu
tors to call Lewinsky for live ques
tioning was rejected. 70-30, with 25
of the Senate's 55 Republicans join
ing the 45 Democrats in opposition.
Rep. Hill McCollum, R-Fla,
pleaded with the senators: "1 think
that it is eminently fair that we be
allowed to present at least one wit
ness live to you, the central witness
in the cast of this entire proceeding,

and that is Monica Lewinsky."
But White House special counsel
Gregory Craig argued the other
side, cautioning that her testimony
could "produce an avalanche of
unwelcome" testimony "into the
living rooms of the nation."
The vote against calling Lewin
sky was a rebuff to Rep. Henry
Hyde and other House prosecutors,
who had pushed the two articles of
impeachment through the House
on a near party-line vote. They won
grudging Senate permission a week
ago to depose the three witnesses,
but only after paring their list down
from a dozen or more.
A subsequent bid by Democratic
Sen. Patty Murray to keep the
videotapes out of presentations at
the trial failed, 73-27.

That left Republican prosecutors
and White House defenders free to
use segments of the taped deposi
tions tomorrow.
Taken together, the day's votes
underscored that senators in both
parties are eager for a swift conclu
sion to the trial, near the end of its
fourth week. Republicans, in partic
ular. have been laboring to find an
exit from a proceeding that is
unpopular with the public and that
GOP strategists say is inflicting
political damage on the party.
Republicans edged away from a
confrontation over their proposal to
delineate wrongdoing by Clinton
before the final vote on his fate.
Democrats had attacked the pro
posal as unconstitutional, and
Republicans said they had no inter

est in provoking a partisan con
frontation. At the same time,
Republicans were divided among
themselves over the constitutionali
ty — and the political wisdom —of
such a vote.
In its most recent form, the pro
posal said that Clinton "willfully
provided false and misleading testi
mony to the grand jury" empaneled
by Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr. In addition, it said Clinton
had "wrongfully engaged in conduct
to delay the discovery and to cover
up the existence of evidence and
alter testimony related to a federal
civil rights lawsuit and a United
States grand jury investigation."
The lawsuit refers to the claim that
Paula Jones filed against the presi
dent, since dismissed.
