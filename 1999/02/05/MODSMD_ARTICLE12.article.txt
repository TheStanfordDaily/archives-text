Frosh-Soph College fails
to address key aspects of
faculty/student relations

THERE WERE NO fireworks
or flashing lights at Tuesday's
press conference to unveil a
new freshman / sophomore residen
tial college, just a host of happy com
mittee members, a long wooden
table and a program with enough
bells and whistles to da/./le an entire
campus.
In announcing the college, the
Residential Programs Implementa
tion Group tried its best to wow the
crowd. There was Materials Science
Prof. John Bravman, one of the Uni
versity's most popular and respected
professors, taking charge of the col
lege as its first dean. There was the
promise of a 180-person residential
community of underclassmen in
Sterling Quad, living and working
together.
Most impressively, there was the
talk of encouraging student-faculty
dialogue through residence-based
seminars and faculty-aided student
presentations. The program, which
will cost about $180,000 per
should draw in some of Stanford's
biggest faculty names.
It's all very impressive. Just don't
look behind the glitz.
Peeling away the big names and
the big promises from the group's
plan reveals a program that address
es a fundamental problem — the
need to improve student-faculty
contact — with a gimmick solution.
The creation of a learning / living
environment lavished with faculty
resources will undoubtably help 180
students to better foster relation
ships with professors. But it won't
solve the problem itself, because it
ignores its greatest causes: the
inability of students to approach

professors and a faculty that is by
and large more concerned with
research than teaching.
Stanford student have opportuni
ties every day to bond with faculty.
The University is right to tout its
Stanford Introductory Studies pro
gram, which puts freshmen and
sophomores into small seminars, as a
highly successful launching pad for
student-faculty relationships. Class
es need not be small, however, for
students to interact with their teach
ers. A long-lasting relationship with
a professor can begin on a simple
visit to office hours.
Unfortunately, this is frequently
not the case. Students, whether shy,
intimidated or lazy, don't take full
advantage of their available options.
Even when they do, they often
become frustrated by faculty mem
bers who often seem to have better
things to do with their time than talk
to undergraduates. For every Brav
man, Economics Prof. John Taylor
or Assoc. Art Histroy Prof. Jody
Maxmin — professors renowned for
their approachability — there are
just as many who seem to prefer con
fining student contact to questions
raised in lecture.
The University needs to address
both sides of the equation. It needs
to do more to convince all students
(not just 180 of them) that they can
break the ice and interact with their
professors. It also needs to take larg
er steps to encourage faculty to care
about undergraduates, both by
emphasizing teaching more in the
tenure process and working to keep
senior faculty involved on campus.
It's not an easy task to accom
plish. Instead of a slick plan, it needs
years of hard work to gradually
change attitudes. There are no quick
answers and no fast solutions.
The University appears too
caught up in its own bells and whis
tles to notice.
