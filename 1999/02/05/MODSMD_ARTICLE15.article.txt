How to make friends with professors: just relax

It has been nearly eight years since I
graduated from the Farm, hut I have kept a
pretty close eye on events that have shaped
my beloved alma mater. Most things that
have occurred have seemed natural and
typical ol any institution of higher learning
and its progression through time. Thus, I
have held my tongue when 1 have had crit
ical feelings about this thing or that.
Recently, however, I have been reading
with some interest about the proposed
housing and education rearrangement in
Sterling Quad and some of the reactions to
it. I feel like I should add my two cents'
worth at this point: everyone just relax!
Universities are the very places where
daring-do in lifestyle and education should
take place. A couple of years of a few peo
ple seeing if something has benefits AND
drawbacks isn't going to make that much
difference in the long run.

Prof. Ken Fields of the English Depart
ment once pointed out to a class that 1 was
in that we as students were often too "abso
lutist" for our own good. Hv that he meant
that whether this thing fails or succeeds and
whether only a few people get to try it, the
process and outcome aren't going to kill the
rest of you.
1 can remember my first official visit
with my undergraduate advisor in the
English Department. I went to talk to him
about a course of study, what periods to
focus on, what theorists and critics to read,
etc. I knocked on his door, he waved me in
and said, "Come in, come in! Have a seat.
Say, isn't Jose Canseco a magnificent
ballplayer? When you're a rich alum, 1
want you to establish the Jose Canseco
Chair in 19th-century Literature."
I don't think Professor Bravman would
take it as an insult to say that those 180 stu

dents in seven or eight years will most like
ly remember a food fight they had in the
cafeteria that first year before they remem
ber anything he taught them while they
were there.
College students should be passionate
and fight for things they believe in and get
angry and overreact. You're young and it's
part of the process.
But it's also very much a part of the pro
cess for people who control things to throw
you curveballs and create scenarios and
environments that seem, and sometimes
actually are, unfair to you.
Sadly, it's also very, very much a part of
the process that stupid people are some
times in control, and they make stupid deci
sions and a lot of people suffer because of
them.
But please believe me, whether you get
to live on campus and have Residential

Education give you the yummy Jell-O pud
ding cup version of the world has nothing to
do with real life.
Additionally, strong student-faculty
relationships definitely have nothing to do
with living arrangements and forced acces
sibility.
If you never have the gumption to knock
on their doors and ask them, you'll never
know that Prof. Haefle worked the salmon
runs, Prof. Polhemus loves the [Oakland]
A's, Prof. DiPiero likes to play poker, Prof.
Taliaferro was a sergeant in the Army and
Prof. Steidle dropped out of medical
school.
Stanford is merely preparation for life, it
is not life itself.
