## Women head east to battle Berkeley 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
When Stanford (11-9,7-2 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) met California
(8-10, 2-7) last month at Maples
Pavilion, the Cardinal had lost
three of its past four games, includ
ing a humiliating 30-point defeat at
Tennessee.
Tonight's game has a complete
ly different look.
Stanford is going to Kaiser
Arena with a four-game winning
streak, including victories over
conference rivals Washington and
Arizona. Stabilizing after a shaky
beginning to the season, the Cardi
nal has come together on the
court, and last weekend against
the Arizona teams was a showcase
of emerging talent, career games
and the discovery of consistency.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
â–  Tonight: Stanford (11-9,7-2 Pa
cific 10 Conference) at California
(8-10, 2-7), 7:30 p.m. RADIO:
KBPA.

The injury to starting forward
Sarah Dimson became a blessing
in disguise, as it allowed senior for
ward Regan Freuen and freshman
forward Enjoli Izidor to exhibit
their talent and the depth of the
Cardinal bench. While Freuen
came in on Thursday's game
against Arizona and scored a ca
reer-high 23 points, Izidor was on
fire Saturday, having career highs
in points (12), rebounds (13) and
assists (3). This uncovered output
in both players will be sure to help

the Cardinal down the stretch as
the season begins to wear down all
the starters.
Two of these starters, freshman
forward Bethany Donaphin and
freshman guard Lindsey Yamasa
ki, have given the Cardinal consis
tent play throughout the first half
of the Pac-10 season, and
Donaphin had a career-high 14 re
bounds the last time Stanford
faced Cal. Along with Cori En
ghusen, who had six blocks in the
Arizona State game, and Izidor,
the freshman class has begun to
show the maturity and output that
can only come with playing time.
"I think, basically, we're still
freshman, but we've got nine
games left and at this point, like
Tara told me today, 'No more
freshman, Bethany, no more
freshman,'" Donaphin said. "We
can't really play like freshman be
cause it doesn't matter when the
game is over."
The freshmen haven't been the
only ones to impress. Junior point
guard Milena Flores has become
the go-to player, putting up solid
numbers, including two double
doubles in the past four games.
After the Arizona game, coach
Tara VanDerveer called Flores
the one given on the team, ex
plaining that she was the player
VanDerveer could depend on
night in and night out to make the
plays and lead the team to victory.
"I've become more consistent,
and I feel more confident out there
as a leader and being able to pene
trate and create," Flores said. ' I've
been really trying to pressure the
hall and trying to create fast break
opportunities."
All of this improvement will be
needed to beat a Cal team that is
much better than its numbers indi
cate. Sherrise Smith, a senior guard
usually known for her playmaking
ability, is averaging 13.S points per
game over the last four contests.
She had an impressive 20 points
against Arizona State, and with se

nior center Jennie Leander in the
post, the Cardinal will have its
hands full containing Cal. Leander
has been playing aggressively since
she became the 14th player in Cal
history to score over I,(MK) points,
and it will require a solid game by
sophomore center Carloyn Moos to
stop her.
"I think last time we played their
post [Leander] had some high num
bers and so [weJ definitely look to
contain them, and just pressure the
guards into shooting bad-percent
age shots," Flores said.
The key to a Cardinal victory
may lie in free-throw shooting, an

area where the Cardinal has im
proved throughout the year, while
the Bears have been struggling
from the line recently. In games
where the Cardinal make more free
throws than its opponent its are 8-0.
and with Cal only shooting .632 to
Stanford's .715 in Pac-lOplay, a win
could come with a prolific output
from the charity stripe.
Regardless of the numbers, the
Cardinal has been practicing well,
playing well and the sentiment of
the team may best be summed up by
Flores.
"We would love to blow them
out on their floor," Flores said.
