# Cardinal sets sights on No. 1
## Connecticut makes way to Maples

The marquee game of the season.
The toughest ticket in the history of Stan
ford basketball.
The reason for Dick Vitale's first-ever ap
pearance on the Farm.
Tomorrow's game between the Stanford
men's basketball team and No. 1 Connecticut
(19-1) is all of that and more.

MEW'S BASKETBALL
■ Tomorrow: No. 4 Stanford (19-3) vs. No. 1
Connecticut (19-1), 12 p.m. Maples Pavilion.
TV: ABC. RADIO: KTCT(IOSO AM), KZSU
(9(). 1 FM).

When the 1999 schedule came out. this
matchup of two top-five teams jumped out as
the game to watch.
To some outside observers, the allure of this
showdown at Maples was lessened when in
jury-depleted UConn lost its first game of the
season on Monday to Syracuse, just a week
after the No. 4 Cardinal lost its first Pacific 10
Conference game of the year at Arizona.
But to those who know best — the rabid
members of the Sixth Man Club — this game is
big as they come.
Exhibit A: the tent village that began to
form outside Maples Pavilion Wednesday
morning.
Exhibit B: the demand for brokered tickets
— the only kind still available.
As of early Thursday, the going rate for a
seat on the floor was as high as $650.
Perhaps all the brokers knew that UConn's
leading scorer. Richard Hamilton, is likely to
return from the injury that kept him sidelined
for Monday's loss.
Or that center Jake Voskuhl, who was also
out for the Syracuse debacle, is making the trip
westward — a sure sign that he might not have

a stress fracture and may be in the lineup to
morrow afternoon.
Bottom line: this is still an absolutely huge
game, and everyone knows it.
Including the 100 members of the press that
will pack Maples. A few of the high-profile
media organizations that will be in attendance
are Sports Illustrated, The New York Times,
the New York Daily News, The Dallas Morn
ing News and the Los Angeles Times.
For Stanford (19-3), tomorrow has all kinds
of long-term implications.
For one thing, the Cardinal has yet to fully
prove itself this season in the national spotlight.
Stanford lost two games on national television
to ACC powerhouses North Carolina and
Maryland, placing doubts in the minds of East
Coast media.
For another, the Cardinal was embarrassed
exactly one year ago by this same UConn team,
losing 76-56 in Storrs in front of yet another na
tional audience.
Granted, that game was played at 9 a.m.
Stanford time, three days after a late-night
game at California, so the odds were stacked
against the tired Cardinal in that contest.
Either way, a win tomorrow would erase the
memory of that loss and would prove —once
and for all — that Stanford is able to step up in
a big-time regular — season game against an
East Coast opponent.
When asked if he was disappointed that the
Huskies had first lost just six days before com
ing to Maples, Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery responded with his typical mix of
wit and candor.
"They'll still be No. 1," Montgomery said
with a serious smile. "We'll see an appreciably
different performance [than in Monday night's
loss]. Connecticut is a premier team in the
country, and they'll bring plenty."
Plenty indeed, as Hamilton — a strong can-

didate for Player of the Year — will
return with his team-leading 22
points per game average to join
point guard Khalid El-Amin and
form a potent backcourt that triggers
an up-tempo style of transition bas
ketball.
"You look at Connecticut, with
Hamilton and El-Amin, these guys
are tremendous players," Mont
gomery said. " They can score some
big numbers. We are always interest
ed in taking [that] away."
Senior guard Ricky Moore joins
the pair of explosive scorers and pro
vides a suffocating defensive force
on the floor. C iuard Rashamel Jones,
another senior, often comes off the
bench to give a scoring punch with
his shooting touch, while Kevin
Freeman gives the Huskies another
threat on the fast break and on the
glass.
Speaking of rebounding, sopho
more forward Edmund Saunders

has recently emerged as a legitimate
force on the boards. Saunders was
also the only player to show up on of
fense for the Huskies on Monday,
scoring 14.
Saunders is one of many players
who perfectly lit the mold of UConn
basketball: strong, athletic and look
ing to get out on the fast break. The
Huskies ran the tired Cardinal to
death a season ago, converting IS
full-court-press-generated
turnovers into easy buckets.
The up-tempo. Big East brand of
basketball is something Stanford will
have to overcome or, even better,
take away in order to come away
with a win.
The Cardinal is coming off a slop
py performance of its own. a
thrilling 57-55 victory at Cal on
Wednesday night. In that heated
battle, Stanford went more than 11
minutes in the second half without a
field goal, and had difficulty break
ing the Cal press.
Senior point guard Arthur Lee,
who picked up four fouls and was
forced to the bench earlv in the sec

ond half, will have to stay in the
game to neutralize El-Amin and to
handle the ball through the UConn
pressure.
The Cardinal has a decided ad
vantage in the frontcourt — espe
cially considering the questionable
status of Voskuhl —and will need to
pound the ball into the post out of its
half-court offense and outmuscle the
Huskies.
In a nutshell, that will be the
game plan for Stanford: guard the
ball against the press and get it to the
big men as much as possible.
In a game where the tempo and
style of plav will be so critical in de
termining the outcome, Stanford has
a huge edge — the homecourt.
Tomorrow is a glorious opportu
nity for the student section to be a lit
eral sixth man.
And judging from the tents out
side Maples, they will be fired up and
ready to help prove — to the
Huskies, to Dick Vitale and to any
one else who is watching — that
Stanford is an undeniable national
power.

battle, Stanford went more than 11
minutes in the second half without a
field goal, and had difficulty break
ing the Cal press.
Senior point guard Arthur Lee,
who picked up four fouls and was
forced to the bench earlv in the sec

ond half, will have to stay in the
game to neutralize El-Amin and to
handle the ball through the UConn
pressure.
The Cardinal has a decided ad
vantage in the frontcourt — espe
cially considering the questionable
status of Voskuhl —and will need to
pound the ball into the post out of its
half-court offense and outmuscle the
Huskies.
In a nutshell, that will be the
game plan for Stanford: guard the
ball against the press and get it to the
big men as much as possible.
In a game where the tempo and
style of plav will be so critical in de
termining the outcome, Stanford has
a huge edge — the homecourt.
Tomorrow is a glorious opportu
nity for the student section to be a lit
eral sixth man.
And judging from the tents out
side Maples, they will be fired up and
ready to help prove — to the
Huskies, to Dick Vitale and to any
one else who is watching — that
Stanford is an undeniable national
power.
