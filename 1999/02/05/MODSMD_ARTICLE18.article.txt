## Connecticut makes way to Maples

The marquee game of the season.
The toughest ticket in the history of Stan
ford basketball.
The reason for Dick Vitale's first-ever ap
pearance on the Farm.
Tomorrow's game between the Stanford
men's basketball team and No. 1 Connecticut
(19-1) is all of that and more.

MEW'S BASKETBALL
■ Tomorrow: No. 4 Stanford (19-3) vs. No. 1
Connecticut (19-1), 12 p.m. Maples Pavilion.
TV: ABC. RADIO: KTCT(IOSO AM), KZSU
(9(). 1 FM).

When the 1999 schedule came out. this
matchup of two top-five teams jumped out as
the game to watch.
To some outside observers, the allure of this
showdown at Maples was lessened when in
jury-depleted UConn lost its first game of the
season on Monday to Syracuse, just a week
after the No. 4 Cardinal lost its first Pacific 10
Conference game of the year at Arizona.
But to those who know best — the rabid
members of the Sixth Man Club — this game is
big as they come.
Exhibit A: the tent village that began to
form outside Maples Pavilion Wednesday
morning.
Exhibit B: the demand for brokered tickets
— the only kind still available.
As of early Thursday, the going rate for a
seat on the floor was as high as $650.
Perhaps all the brokers knew that UConn's
leading scorer. Richard Hamilton, is likely to
return from the injury that kept him sidelined
for Monday's loss.
Or that center Jake Voskuhl, who was also
out for the Syracuse debacle, is making the trip
westward — a sure sign that he might not have

a stress fracture and may be in the lineup to
morrow afternoon.
Bottom line: this is still an absolutely huge
game, and everyone knows it.
Including the 100 members of the press that
will pack Maples. A few of the high-profile
media organizations that will be in attendance
are Sports Illustrated, The New York Times,
the New York Daily News, The Dallas Morn
ing News and the Los Angeles Times.
For Stanford (19-3), tomorrow has all kinds
of long-term implications.
For one thing, the Cardinal has yet to fully
prove itself this season in the national spotlight.
Stanford lost two games on national television
to ACC powerhouses North Carolina and
Maryland, placing doubts in the minds of East
Coast media.
For another, the Cardinal was embarrassed
exactly one year ago by this same UConn team,
losing 76-56 in Storrs in front of yet another na
tional audience.
Granted, that game was played at 9 a.m.
Stanford time, three days after a late-night
game at California, so the odds were stacked
against the tired Cardinal in that contest.
Either way, a win tomorrow would erase the
memory of that loss and would prove —once
and for all — that Stanford is able to step up in
a big-time regular — season game against an
East Coast opponent.
When asked if he was disappointed that the
Huskies had first lost just six days before com
ing to Maples, Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery responded with his typical mix of
wit and candor.
"They'll still be No. 1," Montgomery said
with a serious smile. "We'll see an appreciably
different performance [than in Monday night's
loss]. Connecticut is a premier team in the
country, and they'll bring plenty."
Plenty indeed, as Hamilton — a strong can-
