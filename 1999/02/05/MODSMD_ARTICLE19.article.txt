# Bruins, Lions come to face Cardinal
## Women gymnasts host UCLA, Penn State in crucial meet 
### Ramona Shelburne Contributing writer 
Every team needs leaders, indi
viduals who perform best in the
toughest matches and handle pres
sure with grace and aplomb.
The No. <S Stanford women's
gymnastics team (3-1) thought that
it had found that leader in junior
All-American Larissa Fontaine.
This week, however, Fontaine
was diagnosed with a broken finger
that will keep her out of action for
the next 8-10 weeks. The Cardinal is
now left to find a new leader while
Fontaine is left with a cast.
Losing a gymnast of Fontaine's
caliber would discourage most
teams, but judging from last week's
record-breaking win over Pacific 10
Conference rival Oregon State, the
Cardinal is anything but discour
aged.
"Our attitude has been remark
ably positive," said junior Kim
Young. "Obviously we all feel re
ally bad for Larissa because she's
our friend but we're such a deep

team and can afford not to have
her."
And so, as the Cardinal prepares
for one of its biggest meets of the
season tonight against No. 5 Penn
State and No. 10 UCLA. Stanford is
optimistic about its chances for a
victory over the two national pow
erhouses despite being without the
services of its best gymnast.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Tonight: No. 8 Stanford (3-1) vs.
N0.5 Penn State (6-0) and No.lo
IJCI.A (6-2),7:30p.m. Maples Pavil
ion.

Leading the Cardinal tonight
will be senior co-captain Amy Mu
rakami, who is coming off one of
the best performances of her distin
guished Cardinal career. In last Fri
day night's win against the Beavers,
Murakami, won event champi
onships on the balance beam
(9.850) and the uneven parallel bars
with school record 9.975. Muraka
mi was rewarded for her efforts by
being named the Pac-10 Confer

ence gymnast of the week.
Murakami was not the only
record-breaking Cardinal last Fri
day.
Sophomore Jenny Wilson looks
to duplicate last week's career-best
performance in which she estab
lished four personal highs en route
to a first-place finish in the all
around competition (38.875) and
the vaulting title (9.800).
Tonight's meet will be a major
test for the Cardinal as it looks to
establish itself as a national champi
onship contender.
"The meet is important for see
ing where we all stand." said Stan
ford head coach Mark Cook. "Penn
State is from back East so their
scoring might be a little different
and we always love competing
against UCLA because they're one
of the strongest teams in the Pac
10."
The Cardinal enters the meet
riding the momentum from its best
performance of the year (195.350),
but finds its opponents in relatively
the same situation.

Last week against No. 15 Flori
da, the Lady Lions (6-0) set a school
record team total with an astound
ing 196.750 and recorded the
school's first ever perfect 10 when
senior Missy Leopoldus performed
a flawless beam routine.

The Bruins (6-2) are led by ju
nior All-American Heidi Money
maker who is coming off her best
performance of the season.
Moneymaker, the defending na
tional champion on the uneven
bars, won the all-around competi
tion with a score of 39.250 and three
out of four event titles in the Bruins
victory over Washington last Fri
day.
"It's going to be a jam-packed
meet with a lot of good gymnas
tics," Cook said.
Start time for tonight's meet is
set for 7:30 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
