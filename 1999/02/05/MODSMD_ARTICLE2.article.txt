## Bike accidents prompt police patrols on campus 
### Jad Fakhry Contributing writer 
Police officers have begun closely monitoring the
intersection of Santa Teresa Street and Lomita Drive
in response to the problems of bike traffic that have
plagued Stanford for years.
Police Lt. Del Bandy called the area near Terman
"historically a tough situation." The hill that intersects
Santa Teresa can be dangerous for bicyclists who
aren't careful, he noted.
"There have been two recent bike accidents that
were really bad," said Bandy.
In one incident, he explained, a biker came speed
ing down the hill near Terman. while a police car was
crossing Santa Teresa with its lights and sirens on.
"You'd think the guy would at least see or hear the
car with its lights and sirens on," Bandy said. The biker
apparently did not hear or see anything and crashed
into the side of the patrol car.
But, Bandy explained, "It was not just that one ac
cident; we are just enforcing the existing laws." En
forcement, he explained, is not the permanent solution
and will never be. Rather, this recent enforcement
"will have at least some moderate impact in reducing
the danger and frequency of bike accidents at that dan
gerous intersection. This enforcement can improve be
havior in the short term."
Enforcement has come in the form of citations
handed out to bikers who do not obey stop signs or
other applicable traffic laws, especially in the presence
of automobiles.
One officer, according to Bandy, has been out on
bike patrol occasionally monitoring bikers near Ter
man.
Police Chief Marvin Herrington said of bike traffic
problems on campus, "I don't like to see this becoming
a police problem. It's really an educational problem."
Even though there are many dangers involved with

hiking, many Stanford students still
prefer cycling to walking.
"Biking is really effective as trans
portation, hut it can be dangerous
too, especially when you're in the
Quad zipping to a class in the morn
ing." freshman Mo Khan said.
"Overall, though, I'd rather bike
than walk because the campus is so
huge."
Another freshman echoed
Kahn's worry about biking's dan
gers.
"I like biking, but right before and
after class it gets kind of scary and re
ally hectic," freshman Sophia Liu
said. "Everyone is going extremely
fast because they have to get to class,
but I think people should be more
careful."
The increase in ticketing at that
intersection has been implemented
in order to decrease the possibility of
injury, said Handy.
