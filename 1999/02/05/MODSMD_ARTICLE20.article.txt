# Men's gym battles in Utah
## 
### Nina Cassidy 
Alter last weekend's upset of
archrival C alifornia, the men's gym
nastics team looks to keep its mo
mentum going tomorrow night when
they head to Provo, Utah, and the
BYIJ Invitational. The meet, hosted
by Brigham Young, will also include
Air Force.
The extremely competitive match
will feature three teams currently
ranked in the top 15 nationally: BYIJ
at No. 11, Stanford at No. 13 and Air
Force at No. 15. It is anyone's match
to win.
This meet is crucial because it will
offer a preview for this year's Re
gional competition that will be host
ed by BYIJ. It will be a chance for the
gymnasts to try out the gym at BYIJ,
so when Regionals come around, it
won't be their first time on the equip
ment.
It will also give coaches an oppor

tunity to observe how travel will af
fect the younger members of the Car
dinal squad. Although officially this
is not the team's first away meet —
they traveled to Cal two weeks ago —
it will be the first time the freshmen
on the team will experience traveling
to another city to compete.

"This meet is a big test for our
younger guys." said Stanford assis
tant coach Kyle Asano. "It will give
us a chance to see how they handle
being away from their home. For the
older guys, it will be a test of how well
they can hit their routines."
Crucial to the Cardinal success
will be the performance of Brigham
Young gymnast Guard Young and
Air Force's Nathan Drewery. But the
team is concentrating more on its

own performance.
"Guard Young is a good gym
nast," Asano said. "But I am more
concerned with my guys and how
they do."
Prior to last Saturdays upset vic
tory over California. Cal had beaten
the Cardinal in each of the previous
fifteen meetings. The win snapped
California's 48-meet winning streak
of almost three years.
This weekend though they will
face a slightly tougher opponent in
BYU, who is coming off a particular
ly strong year and is bolstered by the
acquisition of various new recruits.
Both BYU and Air Force are
coming off losses in the Rocky
Mountain High Open. The loss how
ever, came against the U.S. Olympic
Training Team, among others. BYU
came in fourth, falling behind both
the Olympic training team and a Ne
