# Card looks to bounce back
## 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Last weekend, No. 7 Stanford (1-2)
played poorly and lost two out of three
games to Fresno State, which Baseball
America said was the nation's 52nd-best
college baseball team entering the season.
So much for preseason projections.
For the Cardinal to avoid dropping
from its lofty ranking, it must play better
this weekend and must do it on the road
against a better opponent than Fresno
State, No. 15 Cal State-Fullerton.
"We're anxious to get back at it and
play again and evaluate where we are to
see if we've improved a little," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess.
The biggest sign of improvement for
Marquess would be if his roster of talented
hitters can come through with runners in
scoring position.
Last weekend, senior third baseman
Josh Hochgesang, who hit .500 with two
home runs and five RBls, was one of the
few Cardinal batters to come through. In
the three-game set, Stanford left a slew of
runners on base and scored only 10 runs, a
paltry effort in this era of high-scoring col
lege baseball games.
"We left a lot of people on base and that
happens sometimes," Marquess said.
"Hopefully, we'll get some hits in the
clutch this time and score some runs.
"I would be surprised if we don't hit the
ball better [than last week). We're a better

hitting team than that. That should be our
strength."
This could be a good time for the Car
dinal to get some more production from its
experienced bats because Fullerton fea
tures a young pitching staff throwing in its
first games of the year.
Sophomore Adam Johnson, who post
ed eight saves with a 3.05 ERA as a closer
for the Titans last year, will open the sea
son for Fullerton Friday night against
Stanford righthander Jason Young.

Young, also a sophomore, came into
the season without much experience.
However, he answered any questions
about his talent last Friday night with a
commanding six-inning, one-hit, seven
strikeout effort. Young was only pulled
from the game because coach Marquess
was concerned his pitch count was getting
high. The only hit he gave up was an infield
single.
Sophomore righthander Justin Wayne
will go again for the Cardinal Saturday
night. Wayne struggled last Saturday, giv
ing up seven runs on 11 hits in just under

seven innings of work.
"Justin pitched all right," Marquess
said. "But, it you ask him, it's probably not
up to his ability. He can pitch better than
that and I think he will."
Fullerton righthander Jordan DeJong
will go against Young on Saturday. De-
Jong pitched in just over 17 innings last
season, but Titan coaches have been call
ing him the team's most improved pitcher.
Sunday, Fullerton will go with left
hander Mike Garner. Garner is the only
Titan pitcher penciled in to start this week
end who has previous experience starting
at the college level. Last April, Garner
started three times, finishing the season
with a 1-0 record and a 6.91 ERA.
With Fullerton starting a lefthander
Sunday afternoon, Marquess may be able
to give catcher John Salter the start. Salter,
a senior, got only one at-bat last weekend
as junior Damien Alvarado started all
three games. However, Alvarado strug
gled both at and behind the plate against
the Bulldogs. He was only 2 for 10 batting
and had one passed ball and two wild
pitches get behind him on defense.
"Those cost us a couple of runs, in fact,"
Marquess said. "I don't know whether
they were passed balls or wild pitches, hut
they were a problem."
Alvarado is still thought of as the better
defensive catcher, but the righthanded
Salter matches up better at the plate

Sunday, Marquess will probably
counter the Titans lefthanded
starter with a lefthander of his own.

Again, either freshman Mike
Gosling or sophomore Brad Drew
will slip into the third starter role
depending upon who is used in re
lief Friday or Saturday.
Last Friday, Gosling worked
three innings of scoreless relief, giv
ing up only two hits while picking
up the win for the Cardinal,

Freshmen Brian Sager and Dan
Rich also made fairly successful and
encouraging appearances on the
mound for Stanford last weekend.
Marquess said he plans to debut
two more freshman pitchers for the
Cardinal this weekend, righthander
J.D. Willcox and righthander Mike
Wodnicki.
