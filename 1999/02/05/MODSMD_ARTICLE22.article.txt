# 49ers, Trojans across net for Stanford
## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
It's going to be another tough
weekend for the Stanford men's vol
leyball team.
The seventh-ranked Cardinal (2-
2,1 -2 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) is coming off a marathon
weekend in which the team played
two grueling five-game matches
against the No. 5 Hawaii Rainbows.
But Stanford can't let up its level
of intensity just yet.
This weekend, Stanford continues
iu MPSF competition against the
sixth-ranked Long Beach State 49crs
(4-U2iO) and the No. 11
jans (3-1, 2-0), two teams with unde
feated MPSF records.
The Cardinal takes on Long
Beach State at the Pyramid tonight at
7:30 and will compete against the
Trojans tomorrow at 7 p.m.
With a schedule that includes five
of the top 10 teams in the nation,
Stanford does not have a break from
the elite caliber of the competitive
MPSF. This weekend is no excep
tion.
Currently ranked third behind
Long Beach State, DSC and Hawaii
in the Pacific Division of the MPSF,

both of these matchups will affect the
Cardinal's position
"Each and every game is impor
tant for our standing," said sopho
more middle blocker Dan Zhang.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (2-2, 1-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
at No. 6 Long Beach State (4-0,2-0),
7:30 p.m.
■ Tomorrow : Stanford at No. 4
IJSC (3-1,2-0), 7 p.m.

Last year's results on the same
road trip indicate that if history re
peabibeJjLyUie C 'ardinal could be fac
ing some more thrilling five-game
matches. Although Stanford pulled
off a five-game victory against the
49ers last season, the Cardinal
dropped a five-game contest to the
Trojans.
Stanford, however, has reason to
be confident this year after capturing
a win against the Rainbows last Fri
day before taking Hawaii to five
games the following night.
"If we play well, there is no reason
we cannot come back with two wins,"

said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves.
Cardinal sophomore setter Brad
Griffith agrees.'
"I think we would be disappointed
with anything less than two wins,"
Griffith said.
The Cardinal's weekend chal
lenges got even tougher when the re
sults of a bone scan of Cardinal out
side hitter Gabe Gardner arrived on
Wednesday. Unable to start in the
second match against the Rainbows
last Friday, Gardner eventually en
tered the match in game three and
recorded 1 X kills despite playing with
acute pain.
Results from the bone scan re

vealed that a stress fracture in his tibia
will limit the practice and training
time of Gardner, one of the Cardi
nal's leading attackers.
"If we weren't at this point in the
season, the doctor would have pre
scribed eight weeks of rest," Nieves
said. "That doesn't work very well at
this point. It's bad news, but we must
do the best we can with the card that
we have been dealt."
Just like Gardner contributed de
spite acute pain last Friday, the Car
dinal hopes that Gardner will be able
to contribute to the team effort in
some way this weekend.
"Gabe had a good performance
on Friday," Nieves said. "If he can
perform like he did on Friday, he can
still do a lot for the team."
Although Gardner's stress frac
ture will affect his preparation time.

at least one Cardinal outside hitter,
freshman Marcus Skacel, returns to
full strength. Although Skacel was
bothered by a stress fracture earlier in
the season, he is now fully healthy.
"Marcus has been feeling really
well," Nieves said. "He is as healthy
as he has been since mid-November."
Skacel, along with Stanford out
side hitters Andy Witt, Patrick Klein,
and Josh Palacios will fill any poten
tial void at this position.
The depth of Cardinal talent, as
well as successful team coordination,
will enable the Cardinal to have suc
cess this weekend despite Gardner's
ambiguous playing status.
"We have to play as a team."
Zhang said of the match. "Even
though we might not have all of our
starters, if we play hard, we'll do
well."
