### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
It's going to be another tough
weekend for the Stanford men's vol
leyball team.
The seventh-ranked Cardinal (2-
2,1 -2 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) is coming off a marathon
weekend in which the team played
two grueling five-game matches
against the No. 5 Hawaii Rainbows.
But Stanford can't let up its level
of intensity just yet.
This weekend, Stanford continues
iu MPSF competition against the
sixth-ranked Long Beach State 49crs
(4-U2iO) and the No. 11
jans (3-1, 2-0), two teams with unde
feated MPSF records.
The Cardinal takes on Long
Beach State at the Pyramid tonight at
7:30 and will compete against the
Trojans tomorrow at 7 p.m.
With a schedule that includes five
of the top 10 teams in the nation,
Stanford does not have a break from
the elite caliber of the competitive
MPSF. This weekend is no excep
tion.
Currently ranked third behind
Long Beach State, DSC and Hawaii
in the Pacific Division of the MPSF,

both of these matchups will affect the
Cardinal's position
"Each and every game is impor
tant for our standing," said sopho
more middle blocker Dan Zhang.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (2-2, 1-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
at No. 6 Long Beach State (4-0,2-0),
7:30 p.m.
■ Tomorrow : Stanford at No. 4
IJSC (3-1,2-0), 7 p.m.

Last year's results on the same
road trip indicate that if history re
peabibeJjLyUie C 'ardinal could be fac
ing some more thrilling five-game
matches. Although Stanford pulled
off a five-game victory against the
49ers last season, the Cardinal
dropped a five-game contest to the
Trojans.
Stanford, however, has reason to
be confident this year after capturing
a win against the Rainbows last Fri
day before taking Hawaii to five
games the following night.
"If we play well, there is no reason
we cannot come back with two wins,"
