# Men's swim ready for splash times three
## 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
The top-ranked Stanford men's
swimming team (7-0, 2-0 Pacific 10
Conference) has its hands full this
weekend.
Not only are they swimming two
home meets back to back, one today
and one on Saturday, but the swim
mers are also trying to serve up losses
to three different teams — No. 14 Ne
braska. unranked UC-Santa Barbara

and fourth-ranked USC.
And they have to do all this in
front of their parents.
During the swim team's own Par
ents' Weekend, the Cardinal begins
by taking on both Nebraska and
Santa Barbara and ends the weekend
on a more competitive note with
USC, one of its biggest Pac-10 rivals
and the only other Pac-10 team to
ranked within the top five.
Stanford goes into the weekend
coming off consecutive victories in

two vigorous meets against No. 5 Ari
zona and No. 10 Arizona State. The
victories gave Stanford a boost of
confidence and reassure it that it is
the team to heat, hut also adds pres
sure to uphold its undefeated record.
"Our main goal against Nebraska
and UCSB is to race the clock and
each other," said senior co-captain
Justin Ewers. "We want to go in there
the next dav [Saturday] and beat
use."
Although today's meet against

Nebraska and the Gauchos will most
likely be far less dynamic than the one
against the Trojans will be. it gives
Stanford an edge for the end of the
year; the consecutive meets are im
portant to increase the swimmers' en
durance.
Both the Pac-10 and NCAA
championships are three-day meets,
and at NCAAs swimmers compete
for six sessions in a row. Therefore,
back-to-back meets allow the swim
mers to practice keeping their com
petitive juices flowing over a long pe
riod of time.

MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Today: No. 1 Stanford (7-0.2-0 Fa
cific 10 Conference) vs. No. 14 Ne
braska (8-2) and UC-Santa Barbara
(5-3), 1 p.m. deGuerre Pool.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. No. 4 USC
(5-0,2-0), 1 p.m. deGuerre Pool.

Besides giving Stanford good
preparation for long-term meets that
last multiple days, the meet against
the two less competitive teams will
provide another racing experience.
Stanford did not compete against ei
ther team last year. A meet against
Nebraska was never planned and the
meet against Santa Barbara was
rained out.
Stanford did defeat DSC last sea
son 145-98, but still has to compete
with a team close to its own level. The
Trojans are coached by Mark Schu
bert who was just named as the coach
for the United States National Team
that will compete in next'year's

Olympics in Sydney. USC offers
faster times, better swimmers and
closer races for Stanford. For exam
ple, USC senior All-American Bela
Szabados in IJSCs last meet won
three major events (200 butterfly, 100
and 500 freestyles) and is a driving
force behind the Trojan's aquatic
powerhouse.
"USC always comes ready to com
pete," Ewers said. "It is an exciting
meet because the teams really get
fired up for each other."
"To win the meet [against USC],
we know we are going to have to
swim aggressively," added sopho
more butterfly and individual medley
standout Steven Brown.
The meets this weekend will give
Stanford a chance to put into practice
some key aspects to competing that
the team has been working on since
the weekend contests against the Ari
zona schools. In addition to working
on training hard, stroke and racing
technique and speed work, the swim
mers have been concentrating on in
creasingly team intensity.
"In Arizona we had some great in
dividual swims," Ewers said. "We are
trying to build up team intensity so
that we can collectively swim at a
higher level."
While the back-to-back meet for
mat has the potential to tire swim
mers out and force worse swims and
slower times on the second day, the
Cardinal swimmers are convinced
that the intensity and the level of
competition will be as good, if not

"Swimming back-to-back meets
won't affect our performance,"
Brown said. "We are used to swim

ming big. long meets. We are looking
to swim well and toward NCAAs.
Some of us are looking for [NCAA]
qualifying times, but in general we
just really want to beat USC."
The meets this weekend will let
Stanford see how it is progressing to
ward the end of the season and also

secure its status as a threat to every
collegiate swim team.
"In swimming USC, we are going
to get a feel for what's out there,"
Gustin said. "If we finish them off
early, they will have us in mind and
that will give us another advantage at
the end of the vear."
