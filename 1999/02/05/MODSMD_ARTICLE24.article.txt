3-1 Pacific 10 Conference) have
postseason thoughts.

■ Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford (6-
2) at No. 4 Southern Methodist
(7-0) and No. 10 Texas (3-3). 1
p.m.

The Cardinal made its way
south to Austin yesterday to pre
pare for a Saturday matchup
against No. 4 Southern Methodist
(7-0) and former swimming power
house No. 10Texas (3-3). With stiff
competition and a top-notch facili
ty, Stanford head coach Richard
Quick hopes the meet will provide
his swimmers with an opportunity
to qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships.
"Texas has one of the fastest
pools in the nation," Quick said of
the Jamail Texas Swimming Cen
ter. "Our No. 1 objective is to win
the meet, hut out second goal is to
qualify as many people for NCA As
as possible."
The unique meet will feature all
three teams competing against one
another simultaneously. Each
school will enter up to four swim
mers in each event. The fastest two
seeds from each team will race in
the first heat of competition, while
the next tier will compete in a sec
ond heat. Most dual meets have
only one heat per event.
The fast pool and the double
dual-meet format have set the
stage for some very quick perfor
mances. Cardinal swimmers will
have more time to rest between
events, and therefore could im
prove their seasonal times signifi
cantly.
Also pushing the Stanford
swimming squad to the limit of its
abilities will be the fierce competi
tion of SMU. Unbeaten this sea
son. SMU is a perennial contender
for the NCAA Championship tro
phy. In the 19905, the Dallas-based
university has placed lower than
fourth at NCA As only once.
Perhaps more importantly,
SMU defeated the No. 1 Georgia
Lady Bulldogs earlier this year —
the same Georgia team that hand
ed the Cardinal its first loss of the
season.
Leading the Mustangs bid at a
collegiate title is senior Martina
Moravcova. One of the finest
swimmers in the country, Morav
cova has dominated her events in the
past three years. She ranks among the
most decorated college swimmers of
all-time, with seven individual
NCAA first-place finishes to her
name.
Practically unchallenged in the
100- and 2(X)-yard freestyles, she is
also a bla/ing individual medley
swimmer. Moravcova has the poten

tial to win virtually any event she
swims at a dual meet.
Moravcova will likely face Cardi
nal sprint and middle-distance swim
mers Catherine Fox, Sylvia
Berkenyei, and Emily Smith among
others in the freestyle events. Stan
ford has a host of IM swimmers that
could compete against Moravcova in
the 2(X)- and 400-yard events.
Another threat is SMU senior Lia
Oberstar. A former national champi
on in the 200-yard butterfly, Oberstar
is also a quality backstroker. Oberstar

placed fourth in the 100-backstroke
at last years NCAAs. Oberstar will
square up against the Cardinal's two
reigning national champions: junior
backstroker Fox and sophomore but
terflyer Misty Hyman.
Stanford divers will have a chal
lenge cut out for them as well. SMU's
Jenny Lingamfelter placed second at
the NCAAs last year in the one
meter competition and fourth in the
three-meter competition. Kristen
Link also placed well for the Mus
tangs, taking fifth in platform.

meet competition left, the second

ming and diving teams (6-2 overall,
3-1 Pacific 10 Conference) have
