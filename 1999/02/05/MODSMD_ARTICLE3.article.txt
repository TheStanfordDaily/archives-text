# Faculty discusses hiring complaints
## Senate faces tough issues 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
President Gerhard Casper ex
pressed concern yesterday over re
cent press reports about a possible
Department of Labor investigation
into Stanford's tenure practices.
Speaking to the Faculty Senate,
Casper insisted that he had no
knowledge of the potential investi
gation prior to reading about it in
various news reports.
"I say 'we learned' because I
learned of the.. .matter in the same
way as you did, by reading it in the
paper," he said. "It says something
about the state of our nation that
even government agencies increas
ingly speak to the press first and to
those with whom they are dealing
later."
Casper was critical of news re
ports that he said exaggerated the
matter to an unnecessary degree.
"We got a voice mail back yester
day saying that the office had re
ceived 'some allegations,' but that it
had not notified us because it must
clarify the items, including whether
they are covered by federal require
ments," Casper said. "The official
said ... 'It's in a very preliminary

stage.
Casper emphasized that the Uni
versity's tenure policies do not em
ploy affirmative action practices for
reasons that Provost Condoleezza
Rice has discussed in the past.
In a senate meeting last May,

Rice said, "I am
completely op
posed to affirma
tive action at the
time of tenure as a
matter of princi
ple. It would be a
slippery slope that
we would be very
sorry to go down."

Casper concurred with Rice's
stance.
"It is a long-standing Stanford
policy that at the point of hiring as
sistant professors we practice affir
mative action," he said. "But at the
point of tenure decision, the candi
date faces evaluation entirely as an
individual. ... Separate standards
for men and women faculty mem
bers ... would be discrimination."
He also cited tenure statistics to
counter the news reports. "In the
cohort of assistant professors ...


Casper
who have come up for promotion to
tenure in the last five years, 50 per
cent of the men and 51 percent of
the women were awarded tenure."
Discussion also arose concerning
student reaction to a proposed
freshman / sophomore college,
which would place 9() freshman and
90 sophomores in two traditionally
upperclass Sterling Quad houses for
the purposes of academic residen
tial programming.
The Residential Programs Im
plementation Group announced
Tuesday that the formation of the
college for the 1999-2000 school
year.
While Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ramon Saldi
var said there was a great deal of
positive reaction to the announce
ment. he did sympathize with stu
dent concerns. He emphasized,
however that the Sterling Quad

plan was the best option.
"This stemmed from earlier
work that faculty and students have
worked on for the past two years,
during which recommendations
were taken from task force groups,"
said Saldivar. "This was what
worked best .... We're excited
about implementing a special forum
for camaraderie and intellectual
growth within the residential at
mosphere."
ASSIJ President Maren Norton
agreed that the program's premise
was acceptable, but that its place
ment was displeasing to a number of
students.
"We don't have an objection to
the program itself, but we do have
an issue with the housing situation
and with the displaced juniors and
seniors," Norton said. "Students are
interested in seeing what types of
actions will be taken in response to
that."
Other issues discussed included
a presentation given by Linguistics
Prof. Elizabeth Traugott concern

ing the amount of responsibility for
classes accorded to graduate stu
dents and lecturers by tenure-line
and tenured faculty.
Traugott stressed the impor
tance of increasing senior faculty
student interaction.
"Are we doing right by our stu
dents?" she said. "Limiting access
to tenure-line faculty can be nega
tive for both sides."
University librarian Mike Keller
discussed the ongoing development
of High Wire Press, an online data
base of academic journals.
Also, proposals to renew the
Graduate Interdisciplinary Pro
gram in Health Services Research
and a revision to the End Quarter
Period policy were unanimously ap
proved.
The revision, which begins the
end quarter week on Monday in
stead of Sunday, arose out of the
Athletics Department's concerns
that scheduled events conflicted
with the designated end quarter pe
riod.
