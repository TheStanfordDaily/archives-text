# Faculty discusses hiring complaints
## Senate faces tough issues 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
President Gerhard Casper ex
pressed concern yesterday over re
cent press reports about a possible
Department of Labor investigation
into Stanford's tenure practices.
Speaking to the Faculty Senate,
Casper insisted that he had no
knowledge of the potential investi

various news reports.
"I say 'we learned' because I
learned of the.. .matter in the same
way as you did, by reading it in the

In a senate meeting last May,

Rice said, "I am
completely op

slippery slope that
we would be very

Casper concurred with Rice's
stance.
"It is a long-standing Stanford
policy that at the point of hiring as
sistant professors we practice affir
mative action," he said. "But at the
point of tenure decision, the candi
date faces evaluation entirely as an
individual. ... Separate standards
for men and women faculty mem
bers ... would be discrimination."
He also cited tenure statistics to
counter the news reports. "In the
cohort of assistant professors ...
