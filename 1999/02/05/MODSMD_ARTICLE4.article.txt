# Scholes returns
## Nobel laureate back from D.C. 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
Myron Scholes, a professor emer
itus of finance and recipient of the
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic
Sciences, will be returning to Stan
ford after retiring as an active partner
from the Greenwich, Conn, hedge
fund Long-Term Capital Manage
ment L.P. He Co-founded the firm in
1994.
Schole will return as a writer and
occasional lecturer at the Graduate
School of Business.
LTCM nearly collapsed last sum
mer, losing more than $4 billion after
the financial panic caused by the
Russian economic crisis.
Though markets have rebounded
and the firm is back on stable ground,
Scholes had been planning for some
time to move back to California with
his new wife, according to a report
from the Associated Press.
" The crisis that LTCM faced in
August and September initially de
layed the implementation of that
plan, but has ultimately allowed me
to relocate to California on a perma
nent basis," Scholes told the AP.
"This move is possible now that
LTCM's fund has stabilized."
"We are delighted to have him
back," said Margaret Neale, associ
ate dean of the Business School.

Scholes will retain his investments
in the firm and become a limited
partner, no longer having a day-to
day role but serving as a paid consul
tant, according to an LTCM
spokesperson.
Scholes earned a doctorate at the
University of Chicago. He was a pro
fessor at the Business School from
1983 to 19%, and was also a professor
at the Law School and a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion. He retired in 1996 to focus on
his partnership at LTCM.
It was in 1968, while working at
MIT and consulting at Wells Fargo
Bank, that he devised the formula
that won him the Nobel Prize. The
award was given by the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences for "a
new method to determine the value
of derivatives." He developed the
formula with fellow Nobel laureate
Robert C. Merton of the Harvard
School of Business and the late Fis
cher Black.
The formula, known as the Black -
Scholes options pricing model, is a
benchmark formula for the valida
tion of stock options.
The unexpected losses at LTCM
led many to regret putting so much
faith in Scholes' and Merton's mod
els, as the formula did not predict the
markets behavior after the Russian
economy fell apart.
