### Juliana Liu 
Luis Castillo, the economic and commercial officer at
the Embassy of Argentina in Washington, D.C., gave a
lunchtime lecture yesterday on the continuing challenges
of strengthening international trade agreements in Latin
America.
The talk, sponsored by the Hoover Institute, was titled
"MERCOSUR and U.S. Trade in Latin America."
The economic union MERCOSUR, a Spanish
acronym for Common Market of the Southern Cone, has
created intra-regional trade between IWO and 19% by
eliminating trade tariffs between member nations. Non
member nations, by trading with any one of the MER
COSUR countries, gain economic access to other coun

tries in the bloc. The MERCOSUR can set a common tar
iff rate for trading with the rest of the world. It is Latin
America's counterpart of the European Union.
"Many people believe it is best to expand MERCO
SUR to other Southern countries and wait for the next
World Trade Organization Rounds to play balance of
power politics," Castillo said. "We can balance the EU."
He began the sparsely attended talk with an overview
of the history of MERCOSUR trade agreement.
There are currently four member nations in the cus
toms union: Argentina. Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay,
plus two nations without full member status.
Despite the success of MERCOSUR, its challenges
are many, according to Castillo.
"We have to improve the consolidation of the common

union," he said referring to efforts to eliminate non-tariff
harriers between members, creating a common external
tariff and general trade policy coordination.
Another goal of the union is to "deepen the agree
ment," which Castillo predicts will be difficult. Problems
include making services transferable and forming coher
ent policies with labor unions.
The four member nations are making efforts to include
other South American nations such as Venezuela, Colom
bia, Ecuador and Peru and to make Chile a fully partic
ipating member.
An economist by training, Castillo served as an Argen
tine foreign service specialist from 199() to 1993. He holds
a graduate degree in foreign affairs from the Johns Hop
kins School of Advanced International Studies.
