# Lag dining hall draws complaints
## 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
The success of the new Lakeside
Dining Hall, which serves Lagunita
Court and Roble residences, has
been hampered by student com
plaints and other logistical problems.
The biggest complaint has come
from Ujamaa residents who have
seen Roble residents using their first
floor hallway as a thoroughfare to get
to the dining hall. "It's really annoy
ing," first-floor Resident Assistant
Kathleen McDaniel said.
"We have people from Roble
knocking on our door, asking people
from Ujamaa to let them in, so they
can walk through my hallway to get to
the dining hall. Some of them even
look like they're uncomfortable
being in Ujamaa. Now we have a sign
that says 'Roble residents, don't
knock, go around.'"
"It's bad now, but when the
weather is bad, it's even more of a

problem," she added.
Before completion of the new fa
cility, Roble residents had a dining
hall located downstairs from their
rooms. Now they walk in sometimes
cold and rainy weather to get to their
dining hall.
"Several students thought that the
project plans originally called for a
covered walkway, but they didn't,"
said Manager of Undergraduate Res
idence Facilities Diana Conklin, in a
letter addressed to all Roble resi
dents. "It was always intended that
students would walk from Roble to
the dining room along an improved
Lane L."
That improvement, however, has
not taken place.
"One Roble resident expressed
concern about mud from the levee
between Lake Lagunita... washing
down onto the lane, and students hav
ing to walk through it to get to and
from the dining room," Conklin
said.

She reminded students that "resi
dents from many other undergradu
ate neighborhotxjs also travel outside
to go to their dining rooms and of
those houses, several also have no
covered walkways." For example,
students in Suites. Sterling Quad,
Stern, Wilbur, Toyon and Manzanita
Park all walk outside to reach their
dining halls.
Conklin mentioned that construc
tion debris, which could pose a haz
ard for students traveling to and from
the dining hall, still remains in the
area. Several students have men
tioned this to her, and she admitted
"the contractor still needs to clean the
whole area up and add landscaping."
The lighting along Lane L could
potentially develop into a problem,
and Conklin said they are taking
steps to replace burned out lamps.
She anticipates that all repairs,
clean-up and landscaping will be
done by mid-February.
Despite the complaints, the new

dining hall offers its patrons more va
riety and a better atmosphere than
before with a wood rotisserie, a large
wok, marble floors, a conveyor belt
for used trays, high ceilings and chan
deliers.
Some students, however, say this
is not enough.
Roble resident Johanna Dyer, a
freshman said, "Before we had our
own dining hall right downstairs.
Now we have to walk all the way over
here. It's better, but I don't know if
it's worth coming all the way over
here."
Agreeing with most Lakeside din
ers, freshman Eric Hendrix said,
" The main thing is that there's more
variety."
Further complaints included rants
about the bad lighting in the Laguni
ta dining room and what McDaniel
called the "crazy" layout, which caus
es "traffic jams" at lunch when resi
dents from Lagunita and Roble con
verge on the dining hall.
