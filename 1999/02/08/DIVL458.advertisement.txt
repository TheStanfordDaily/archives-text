One of the
greatest chal- ;«H
lenges in young
hood is learning about love
- how to love, whom to love,
and, most important, developing
self-love.
Capacity to Love
The ability to love requires a
sequence of experiences:
1. You learn about love by first
being loved by your primary
caregivers and others.
2. You learn to internalize being
loved in the absence of primary
caregivers.
3. You are able to transform
loving and soothing yourself into
loving others.
These are prerequisites to being
able to love another person.
When these "stages" only partial
ly occur, occur out of sequence,
or don't occur at all, difficulties
can arise. High self-esteem is
essential for giving and receiving
love. If you have doubts about
your worth, it may be a good
time to get some counseling and
examine where and how these
beliefs emerged so you can work
on them.
In Love?
It feels like magic: your heart
soars; there's great excitement
and anticipation. But being "in
love" may or may not overlap
with really loving someone. Is
there a difference between "love"
and "being in love"? It's debated.
Some claim both can exist
throughout a relationship; others
say the"in love" feeling is an

idealization of the partner during
courtship, and that it can evolve
into love.
Romantic love often requires
courage, because this kind of
love challenges your potential
for intimacy.
Projection
You are "projecting" if you
impose your own perceptions
and expectations onto another
person. If your love is based on
projection, it won't last, because
you're in love with a fantasized
image, not a real person. It can
be highly deceptive, and the
disappointment is enormous
when you realize it.
The "Wrong" Person
Some people love those who
cannot love them back, treat them
well, or provide a compatible
partnership. Often there's some
thing familiar about the way
you're not loved back. This
occurs on an unconscious level,
until you begin to see a pattern of
choosing wrong partners. The
familiar, even though not fully
|§112 satisfying, is more
|1 comfortable than the
1 unknown. To break
BP this pattern, become
aware of it, and consciously
make different choices.
Attachment
Attachment is a by-product of
love. It comes from loving
feelings toward the person,
spending time together, and
sharing experiences and activities.
It's hard to relinquish the sense of
security that develops from such
closeness. This is why it often
takes many messy attempts over
time to fully let go of someone to
whom you're attached.
Good Relationships
Here are characteristics of truly
fulfilling relationships:
■ Your expectations are based
on reality, not fantasy
■ You can overcome your fears
of rejection, vulnerabilities,
and past disappointments
■ Your emotions and intellect
are not in conflict
■ Both partners' needs are met
■ There's enough space for you
to love yourself as well as your
partner
Love is an expansive energy - it
enables you to grow into who
you are.
