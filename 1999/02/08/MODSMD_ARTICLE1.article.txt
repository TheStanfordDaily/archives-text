The World Wide Web has be
come as common a tool as scalpels,
stethoscopes and tongue depressors
for Stanford medical students.
Medical students can now log on
to the Internet and watch all of their
first-year lectures in the privacy of
their own homes.

The digitized lectures are an ex
tension of the Curriculum Web Pro
ject, which offers course handouts
and visuals. Stanford University
Medical Media and Information
Technologies sponsors the project.
"This is a fantastic resource for
students," said Scott Rush, a second
year law student and third-year med
ical student, who designed and coor
dinated the dieital curriculum for the

Web site.
Kush said that an increasing num
ber of students are using the Website
and are returning to the site to review
and study for exams. Over 200 videos
and 300 hours of lecture material are
available.
Kush worked with seven other
medical students to develop the digi
tized lectures.
"It's amazing that something like
this can be done by students," he
said.
Kush presented his digital project
to Assoc. Molecular Pharmacology
Prof. Phyllis Gardner, the Senior As
sociate Dean for Student Education
and Affairs, whose office co-funded
the project with SUMMIT.
"We need to maintain state of the
art learning," said Gardner, who em

phasized that faculty can use the lec
tures to review and avoid duplicating
the lectures of their peers.
Assoc. Neurobiology Prof. Ben
Barres agreed."lt's a fantastic tool,
especially if a student misses lec
ture," said Barres.
"And from my point of view as a
course director ... I can see what's
going on in other lectures and learn
other subjects."
Some faculty members, however,
have reservations about students
watching interactive, hands-on lec
tures at home.
"If you have a choice between two

equally-trained doctors, and one at
tended lectures in class with his or
her colleagues, and one watched lec
tures at home, whom would you
choose?" asked Assoc. Pathology
Prof. Donald Regula.
Medicine is "not a lawyer's busi
ness; this is not over the phone. This
is a hands-on business," said Regula.
Digitized lectures "may not be con
cordant with the attitudes we're try
ing to instill in professionals."
Supporters of the project disagreed.
"The lectures serve as a supplemen
tary learning tool," said Gardner.
She believed students would still at

tend the in-class lectures.
Regardless, the digitized lectures
pose intriguing questions about tech
nology and its role in the Medical
School.
"We need to be really careful
about this. I don't want technology to
be abused. We need to be using it in
the right way," said Kush.
"Certainly, it brings up some con
troversy," said Gardner. "But re
fraining from technology because of
these fears is not the way to go."
