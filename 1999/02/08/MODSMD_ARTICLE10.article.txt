## Censure appears likely 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With a perjury charge in
deep trouble and acquittal virtually assured, senators
yesterday looked beyond President Clinton's impeach
ment trial to a censure resolution that could unify
Republicans and Democrats in a strong condemnation
of his conduct. But even censure had opposition.
The entire impeachment drama appears certain to
be over by the end of the week.
Several senators said the article alleging grand jury
perjury — one of two impeachment articles approved
by the House on Dec. 19 — could fail to muster even a
majority, despite the Republicans' 55-45 edge in the
Senate.
And almost everyone involved agreed that the
remaining article — charging Clinton with obstructing
justice — will fall short of the two-thirds majority need
ed to convict Clinton and eject him from the presiden
cy.
Clinton himself will be away when closing argu
ments start — attending the funeral of Jordan's King
Hussein along with national leaders from around the
world.
When the roll is called on acquittal or conviction,

likely Thursday or Friday, almost all Democrats are
expected to oppose both impeachment articles.
While some Democrats predicted that neither the
perjury nor the obstruction of justice articles would
receive a majority of 51, let alone the 67 votes needed
for conviction, the perjury count appeared to be in the
most trouble.
Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said on "Fox News Sun
day" that "at least one" of the counts — obstruction —
would receive a majority because House managers
showed "a clear pattern here that the president was try
ing to obstruct justice."
Draft censure language floated by Sen. Robert Ben
nett, R-Utah, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., calls
the president's conduct "shameless, reckless, and inde
fensible," and says"he deliberately misled and
deceived the American people and officials in all
branches of the United States government. He gave
false and misleading testimony and impeded discovery
of evidence in judicial proceedings."
Feinstein explained on NBC's "Meet the Press" that
she's looking for an expression "outside of conviction
and removal that will go down in history...
