# Kosovo remains a province

RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) — Serb officials
and Kosovo Albanians agreed on principles that would
keep the embattled province inside Yugoslavia for at
least three more years as they met separately yesterday
with international mediators at a French chateau.
Getting down to serious work after Saturday's cere
monial opening, international mediators presented the
warring factions with a framework agreement worked
out by the Contact Group, made up of six outside
nations trying to arrange a settlement.
The mediators also presented a set of 10 non-nego
tiable principles for the talks, including a guarantee of
Yugoslavia's territorial integrity.
That means Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have to give
up their demand for independence for their province —
at least during a three-year interim period. Both a Serb
negotiator and a Western mediator said all sides had
accepted those principles.
The peace negotiations are being held in seclusion at
the 14th-century Chateau de Rambouillet, and it was

not possible to confirm the Albanian acceptance direct
ly-
Flard-line Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas have
previously said they would never accept anything short
of independence for Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the
main republic in Yugoslavia. The province is 90 percent
ethnic Albanian.
The two sides were driven to the negotiating table
by threat of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslav Presi
dent Slobodan Milosevic and tough measures against
the KLA to halt its arms supplies and financing.
The Contact Group — made up of the United
States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy —
devised the framework agreement based on the work
of U.S. mediator Christopher Hill.
The negotiating teams were not meeting face-to
face.
Instead, international mediators were shuttling
between two floors of the magnificent chateau, 30 miles
south of Paris.
