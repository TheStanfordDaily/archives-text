# King Hussein, 62, dies
## Son takes over as new king of Jordan 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) —Jordan crowned an
untested new monarch yesterday and plunged into
mourning for its beloved King Hussein. Distraught cit
izens sobbed in the streets and world leaders con
verged on the desert kingdom, united in grief for the
statesman who built bridges for peace in the turbulent
Middle East.
The deep political divides between those planning
to attend today's elaborate state funeral served as a
powerful reminder of Hussein's far-reaching abilities
as a mediator and leader — skills that lifted Jordan
into a place of international prominence.
"Even the sky is crying," an announcer on Jordani
an television declared after the king, 62, died at 11:43
a.m. (1:43 a.m. PST) from cancer in a hospital.
Black flags fluttered from the few taxicabs plying
the streets. The wail of Koranic verses of mourning
filled the country's mosques and residents wept on the
sidewalks of Amman, Jordan's hilly capital.
Hussein, who survived repeated assassination
attempts as he walked the tightrope of Mideast poli
tics, succumbed after a seven-month battle with lym
phatic cancer.
He had lingered unconscious on a respirator for
two days after returning home to Jordan last week to
die.
In keeping with Islamic tradition, the funeral will
be held quickly — an enormous procession through
Amman just 24 hours after Hussein's heart gave out.
The elaborately plotted protocols reflect real-life
regional tensions. The Israeli delegation, for example,
will be kept closer to Western leaders than to leaders
from harder-line Arab states, palace sources said.
President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton were among those planning to attend.
Underscoring Jordan's determination that the tran
sition be swift and smooth, Hussein's eldest son
Abdullah, 37, was sworn in just four hours later in par
liament.
"This is God's judgment and God's will," Abdul
lah, a veteran military man but a political novice, told
the nation in a televised address. "God have mercy on
Hussein the father, the brother, the commander and
the man.... We will preserve Hussein's legacy."
Abdullah's first official decree, issued vesterdav.

was to name Queen Noor's eldest son, 19-year-old
Prince Hamzeh, as crown prince.
Though Abdullah's inexperience may be prompt
ing some quiet worries among Jordanians, it also
brought recollections that Hussein himself ascended
the Hashemite throne as a boy of 17.
The late king had an extraordinarily close personal
relationship with his people, and word of his death
brought an outpouring of grief.
In a show of royal solidarity, former Crown Prince
Hassan showed up at the swearing-in at Abdullah's
side. The new king has said Hassan will continue to
serve as a key adviser.
Praise for Hussein poured in from around the
region and the world. Israeli President Ezer Weizman
called him "one of the greatest leaders of the 20th cen
tury, a brave soldier who fought for peace." Clinton's
homage was simpler: "I loved him."
