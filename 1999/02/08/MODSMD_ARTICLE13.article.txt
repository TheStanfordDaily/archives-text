Dining Services needs
to show greater concern
in reorganizing workers

THE EVENTS THAT unfold
ed this past week in the Man
zanita Dining Commons, and
to a lesser extent at other Universi
ty-operated dining halls, suggest a
serious discrepancy in how Housing
and Dining Services administrators
and dining hall employees perceive
the recent process of reassigning
employees to new schedules and
dining halls.
While we do not take issue with
the essential goals of Dining Ser
vices' Value Enhancement
Program — providing better quality
food at lower costs — we are con
cerned about the resulting tensions
between workers and management
created by the reorganization of din
ing hall staff. If left unaddressed,
these tensions could negatively
impact worker morale and dining
hall atmosphere.
Granted, Dining Services is a
business and has a right to allocate
its resources, including its personnel,
as it chooses.
But if it wants to be perceived as
an attractive employer, Dining Ser
vices ought to address the union's
perception that it was forced under
duress to choose a system of reorga
nization based on seniority — a sys
tem some union members appear to
be uncomfortable with.
Additionally, Dining Services
administrators ought to be troubled
by having employees commence
new positions feeling that the man
agement is at best indifferent to
them and at worst disregards them
entirely.
Lingering discontent will affect
job performances and appears to be
counter to the interests of all the

involved parties and to the spirit of
the Value Enhancement Program.
We are particularly concerned
that this reorganization is going into
effect during the middle of the aca
demic year.
Many employees have second
jobs and have made child care acco
modations that may now be disrupt
ed.
Dining Services was well aware
this summer that the new Lakeside
Dining Hall would be opening this
year and that Dining Services would
be offering extended hours. From
the outset, Dining Services should
have better anticipated its staffing
needs, so as to avoid reorganizing its
staff mid-year.
The Manzanita residents, howev
er, should be commended for help
ing to publicize the issue and orga
nize a forum for both the manage
ment and workers to discuss con
cerns.
The fact that students felt com
pelled to bring this issue to the fore
front is a testament to the type of
bonds that students share with din
ing hall employees.
These relationships should not be
sacrificed in the reorganization pro
cess.
The Manzanita residents have
demonstrated that student interven
tion can make a difference, and we
urge students to continue to consid
er the issue from both perspectives.
Finally, we urge both sides to keep
in mind the various perceptions that
exist as they meet later this week.
We trust that each side will work
toward developing a more amenable
plan for reassigning Dining Services
employees.
This plan will meet the goals of
the Value Enhancement Program
while providing minimum disruption
to the lives of Dining Services
employees and the atmospheres of
campus dining halls.
