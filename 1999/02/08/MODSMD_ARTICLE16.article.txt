## Calling for more class interaction 
### 
WE RAN INTO a friend the other
day who was extremely upset
about the creation of the Fresh
man/Sophomore College. Unlike others
who have expressed their disapproval
about the location, his discontent was of a
somewhat different nature.
He began his Stanford career in a four
class dormitory. He explained that the
upperclassmen in his dorm were instru
mental in his academic as well as social
experiences here. He watched them and
learned from them.
They gave him advice and lent an all
knowing ear. In return, he shared with
them his excitement and willingness to
dive in and experience all that Stanford has
to offer. Now, as a senior, he is interview
ing for jobs, and those older friends once
again are playing an integral role in his life.
They are recruiters who, although they
may not be recruiting for the company he
wishes to work for, are a valuable resource
as he goes through this always-stressful
experience.
We, too, feel privileged to have experi
enced the combination of freshman ener
gy, sophomore slump, junior uncertainty
and senior wisdom found in a four-class
dormitory. While freshman energy was
indeed present in our residence (of course,
not to the extent of an all-freshman house),
the interaction with the upperclassmen in
our dorms was instrumental in making our
"freshman experience."
Not only did the upperclassmen in our
dormitories give advice on the easiest, as
well as the hardest, courses at Stanford,
they were instrumental in teaching us
about the variety of experiences that exist
outside of the Quad. They encouraged us
to attend the meetings of the student

groups they were part of (such as the
Chappie and the Axe Committee), to
avoid the ones they considered a waste of
time (ironically, the ASSU) and even gave
great advice about the student jobs they
liked and disliked.
While all of the suggestions and advice
given to us by these individuals could not,
and indeed should not, have been taken as
absolute truths, they gave us more infor
mation about our school than could ever
be provided by glossy handbooks and resi
dential programming. With the increasing
number of all-freshman and single-class
dormitories, as well as the creation of the
college, members of incoming freshman
classes are being denied the experience of
spending their first year living and learning
from those who have already lived it.
As two Stanford seniors, we have seen
and disagreed with many of the changes
that hava altered asjpaets of our university.
While not many nights of sleep were lost
agonizing over minor changes (although
the blue Stanford Web site was pretty
awful), we feel that the increasing separa
tion between classes neither reflects the
desire of, nor is good for the overall health
of, the Stanford undergraduate community.
The opportunities for close interaction
between the classes are disappearing. The
focus has shifted in two directions: increas
ing class unity and improving freshman and
sophomore education. Of course, neither
of these ideals is misguided. Hut how much
consideration has been given to the costs?
We recognize that requests for all-fresh
man houses continue to increase. Incoming
freshmen are asking to live with their peers,
and the University responded wholeheart
edly last year with a great increase in the
number of all-freshman dormitories.

We are not making the argument that
the all-freshman experience is not as
enjoyable, or that random upperclassmen
can give the freshmen with whom they live
better advice than academic advisers.
After all, a couple of them were apparent
ly wrong about the ASSU. We are merely
questioning the decision to base the num
ber of all-freshman houses on how many
high school seniors, who know very little
about Stanford and college life in general,
request to live in them.
The hosts of visiting prospective fresh
men are typically freshmen, and the week
end is normally a blast for the visiting high
school seniors. With the number of fresh
men living in four-class dormitories greatly
decreased, how many incoming freshmen
are going to risk checking "four-class dor
mitory" on their initial housing preference
form when they spent Prospective Fresh
man Week in a fun, all-freshipan house?
Should they justice eliminated now, as
the self-perpetuation of this system will
eventually doom this housing option?
As freshmen in four-class dormitories,
the part of us that wanted to be academic
had outlets at all levels, the part of us that
wanted to be social found guidance as well,
and the part of us that just needed to grow
up was given several examples of how and
how not to go about it.
Are experiences like ours becoming a
thing of the past?
Our friend said that the only time he
ever sees freshmen now is through a class,
Economics 1. Quite frankly, that's a
shame.
