Casper's rule is top-down
While its practical consequences are
minor, President Casper's decision to
bypass the ASSIJ Nominations Commis
sion in appointing student members to the
provost search committee is entirely in
keeping with the top-down decision making
process fostered by his administration.
Despite prior agreements with the Facul
ty Senate Steering Committee, for example,
there was no faculty consultation on the
basic decision to merge the Stanford and
UCSF hospitals. Like factory workers, pro
fessors were simply told that it is their
responsibility to make the merger prof
itable.
The recent, unprecedented protest by
more than 2(K) campus homeowners against
plans to "fill in" open spaces in a company
town was stoked by similar administrative
arrogance.
Several faculty friends have casually
mentioned that professors serving as co
chairs with the provost on decanal search

committees regard themselves pretty much
as window dressing. That was not true in the
past.
Faculty affected by the closure of the
Food Research Institute were afraid to pub
lish their detailed, calm and devastating
response to the administration's recommen
dations, with good reason it turned out.
Prior closings of programs in geography,
nursing and architecture followed very open
debate. Now, fear of retribution is growing.
To the best of my recollection, President
Casper's decision to set aside the findings of
the Advisory Board in the Karen Sawislak
case is the first overruling of this University
wide elected faculty body on a tenure case
in modern times. Casper's predecessors had
profound respect for the judgment of their
professorial colleagues.
No reference was made to the actual
four-to-two vote of the Advisory Board in
the Stanford Report's coverage of Sawislak,
a glaring omission in reporting. There also
were no bylines on this story, a quiet jour
nalistic form of protest which began on
campus a decade ago when Stanford attor

neys took control of copy on sensitive sto
ries from News Service reporters.
In his annual State of the University
report, Casper blamed the increased trend
toward litigiousness for the recent rapid rise
in faculty grievances and lawsuits. There is
at least one other explanation: resentment,
fear and unfair treatment of faculty by a
top-down administration.

Music review was cocky
I was disappointed in reading your
review of "Goodness: Anthem" in Inter
mission on Jan. 13. Upon further reflection
however, I started to wonder about any
critic who could describe a band as a meld
ing of the Pretenders and Tom Petty and
could imply that that was a bad thing.
It is a bit like saying an up-and-coming
Cardinal forward is an "okay player, if only
he was not so reminiscent of Larry Bird and
Magic Johnson." Please, if you are so jaded

that you've written off the validity of such
giants, you need to find another line of
work. Goodness is a rock band eschew
ing the pseudo-sensitivity and whining so
prevalent today in both male- and female
led groups. It is in favor of playing rock 'n'
roll the way it's supposed to be played.
There are a lot of throwback aspects in the
music, of course, but it has got an absolute
ly fresh sound and represents a growth and
progression from the "Seattle grunge"
sound we're all so tired of. And it is all
punctuated by the incredible vocals of Car
rie Akre, as powerful and emotive a vocal
ist as any on the scene today. And finally,
I'm amazed by the author's arrogance in
mocking the lyrics of the songs. Does
everything have to have a deep inner mes
sage? Of course this initial arrogance is far
surpassed by that shown in concluding that
just because the author sees nothing
beneath the surface, there is really nothing
there.
