What is the cause of the gender
gap in science and engineering?
According to one Stanford re
searcher, gender differences in self
assessment may be more significant
than traditional scholarship sug
gests.
A study of high school students
conducted by sociology doctoral
candidate Shelley Correll indicates
that girls are more likely than boys
to be discouraged from pursuing
high-level coursework in science
and math.
Furthermore, girls who tend to
perceive themselves as overall
good students are less likely to
think of themselves as skilled in
quantitative fields, such as math
and science.
"It's above and beyond ability.
It's the perceptions that determine
the careers we choose," she said.
Her findings may help explain
whv men and women still confine

themselves to gender stereotypes
when choosing high-paying profes
sions. This trend, in turn, may lead
to disparities in income.
Other studies generally find that
women make slightly better grades
than men, but men outperform
women on standardized tests.
Much of the research literature also
explains that math and science are
generally perceived by students as
more masculine subjects and hence
influence the types of courses stu
dents choose to take.
Correll said that these results
are inconsistent and insufficient to
explain the discrepancy between
genders in quantitative fields. She
hopes that her research will lead to
a better explanation
The survey research included na
tional samples collected over sever
al years, as well as a one-time sur
vey of high school students from
the Bay Area.
Correll initiated her study under
the direction of Sociology Prof. Ce

cilia Ridgeway, who has extensive
ly studied the influence of culture
on social status. Correll received
funding for her study from the In
stitute for Research on Women and
Gender at Stanford.
Her research was influenced by
her professional experiences, both
as a chemist and as a high school
chemistry teacher.
After majoring in chemistry at
Texas A&M, Correll pursued a ca
reer in this field. During her first
day of work, she was shocked to
hear her boss say, "This isn't a place
for a woman."
"I became very aware that there
were virtually no female chemists. I
hated it there," Correll said of her
first job. She chose to pursue a ca
reer in teaching after realizing that
she could never be happy in such an
environment.
Correll spent six years teaching
Advanced Placement courses in an
academically competitive high
school in Houston, where she ob

served boys and girls having very
different reactions to the grades
they received.
During her time as a chemistry
teacher, Correll was surprised to
sec many bright and skilled girls be
come easily discouraged in science
and math after receiving one C.
"What do you mean you've
never been good, you make A's all
of the time," Correll would tell her
students.
"That experience sort of in
spired me to think about gender is
sues," Correll said. Drawing from
her experience and research, Cor
rell believes that it is important for
female students to have some evi
dence of their skills by gaining
work experience outside the educa
tional arena.
Stanford students see some gen
der differences in "techy" subjects.
When asked about his own ex
periences in computer science
coursework, sophomore Tim Gar
ton explained "When I get bad

grades, it's only because I didn't
work hard enough, hut it doesn't
lower my self esteem." He also de
scribed courses in which only one
out of 15 members of the class was
a woman.
Theresa Torres, a senior in sym
bolic systems said "I think that men
are more encouraged to consider
computer-related and engineering
fields. Women at Stanford often as
sume that they are less capable in
computer classes than men."
She noted that male students
may receive indirect encourage
ment from the fact that men domi
nate research and teaching in these
fields.
While unable to pinpoint the
cause of these trends, Torres said,
"The women in computer science
classes are very aware that they're a
minority and it's a topic of discus
sion. I definitely feel different look
ing for those jobs and applying for
those types of jobs but 1 haven't re
ally figured out why."
