Despite All-American candidate Hamilton
sitting out with injury, Connecticut still
jumps to early lead, holds off No. 4 Card
for key victory at sold-out Maples Pavilion

Saturday's showdown at Maples Pavilion against
Connecticut was supposed to be a statement game for
the Stanford men's basketball team.
The Cardinal's heartbreaking 70-59 loss made a
statement, alright.
It just happened to be the wrong one.
In fact, the only message that Stanford sent across
the nation is almost too painful to put in writing: Con
necticut is clearly the better team.
Even with its star player— Player of the Year can
didate Richard Hamilton — sidelined with a bruised
thigh injury, the Huskies (20-1) absolutely dominated
the style of plav, attacking the slower, less-athletic
Cardinal (19-4) with suffocating defensive pressure
and an up-tempo offense.

MEN S BASKETBALL
■ Saturday: No. 2 Connecticut (20-1) 70, No. 6 Stan
ford (19-4) 59.

"It was a tremendous win lor us," said Connecticut
head coach Jim Calhoun. "Stanford is the most phys
ical team we have played in a long, long time, maybe
since [Alonzo] Mourning and [Dikembe] Mutombo
[at Georgetown]. They're a great college basketball
team, and it's a great college basketball atmosphere."
Yet it could have been so much better.
Many of the 850 members of the Sixth Man Club
slept out for more than 72 hours and were ready to
rock.
But when UConn sprinted out to a 26-8 lead less
than 13 minutes into the first half. Maples was nearly
silent. And while the Stanford student section was
electrifying during the Cardinal comeback, it wasn't
constant chaos.
As one student concluded, "It was like somebody
sprayed tear gas in there. I was literally sick to my
stomach and felt like I was going to vomit."
In the first half, UConn sophomore point guard
Khalid El-Amin torched the Cardinal backcourt for
16 of his game-high 23 points. Stanford turned the
ball over 13 times and shot just 30 percent from the
field in that first period.

Junior for

Madsen had
13 points and
nine rebounds
Saturday, but
No. 1 Con
necticut de
flated any
hopes of the
No. 4 Cardinal
pulling off the
upset.
In fact, if it weren't for several
Connecticut turnovers and some for
tunate officiating, the game could
have been over at halftime.
Instead, Stanford clawed back to
within four and went into the locker
room down only 30-26.
Stanford used a three-guard set
featuring Mike McDonald, Kris
Weems and Lee to successfully alle
viate the UConn press for a stretch in
the second half, often finding big men
wide open in the post. Those front
court players consistently drew fouls
under the post.
The problem — Stanford made
only 50 percent of its free throws in
the game (12 of 24).
"The free-throw line is our
Achilles' heel," Montgomery said.
"We work so hard to get the ball to
the offensive area and get the ball up,
and to not get anything out of it is re
ally discouraging."
Tim Young, the team's best free
throw shooter and the third best in
the Pacific 10 Conference, was on the
sideline with foul trouble for most of
the game.
His frontcourt partner, junior for
ward Mark Madsen, led the Cardinal
with 13 points and nine boards but
missed five of his eight free-throw at
tempts.
UConn forward Kevin Freeman

battled Madsen all day, gathering 11
rebounds and scoring 14 points.
Freeman's last shot — a 17-footer
that gave the Huskies a four-point
lead with just over a minute to play —
was by far his most important, ending
any hope of a Cardinal comeback.
That jumper inside the free-throw
line was the best example of the real
difference in the game: UConn's role
players stepped up while even Stan
ford's stars were way off.
"This was special," Calhoun said.
"Let's not talk about who we don't
have. Let's talk about who we have,
and what they can do."
Lee acknowledged that his team
had blown a major opportunity.
"You want to win this game,
you've been thinking about it all
year," Lee said. "It just didn't hap
pen. We just have to realize that Con
necticut is a really, really good bas
ketball team, even without Hamil
ton. It's just another loss."
The main point of concern for the
Cardinal is that there seems to be a
trend developing in its losses.
Stanford has been be unable to
beat a top-10, athletic team in the reg
ular season. Three of the team's four
losses have come to East Coast pow
erhouses (UConn, Maryland and
North Carolina).
And all four losses are eerily simi
lar in style, with an up-tempo pace
and an opponent that uses full-court
pressure to take the Cardinal out of
its comfort zone.
