Despite All-American candidate Hamilton
sitting out with injury, Connecticut still
jumps to early lead, holds off No. 4 Card
for key victory at sold-out Maples Pavilion

Saturday's showdown at Maples Pavilion against
Connecticut was supposed to be a statement game for
the Stanford men's basketball team.
The Cardinal's heartbreaking 70-59 loss made a
statement, alright.
It just happened to be the wrong one.
In fact, the only message that Stanford sent across
the nation is almost too painful to put in writing: Con
necticut is clearly the better team.
Even with its star player— Player of the Year can
didate Richard Hamilton — sidelined with a bruised
thigh injury, the Huskies (20-1) absolutely dominated
the style of plav, attacking the slower, less-athletic
Cardinal (19-4) with suffocating defensive pressure
and an up-tempo offense.

■ Saturday: No. 2 Connecticut (20-1) 70, No. 6 Stan
ford (19-4) 59.

"It was a tremendous win lor us," said Connecticut
head coach Jim Calhoun. "Stanford is the most phys
ical team we have played in a long, long time, maybe
since [Alonzo] Mourning and [Dikembe] Mutombo
[at Georgetown]. They're a great college basketball
team, and it's a great college basketball atmosphere."
Yet it could have been so much better.
Many of the 850 members of the Sixth Man Club
slept out for more than 72 hours and were ready to
rock.
But when UConn sprinted out to a 26-8 lead less
than 13 minutes into the first half. Maples was nearly
silent. And while the Stanford student section was
electrifying during the Cardinal comeback, it wasn't
constant chaos.
As one student concluded, "It was like somebody
sprayed tear gas in there. I was literally sick to my
stomach and felt like I was going to vomit."
In the first half, UConn sophomore point guard
Khalid El-Amin torched the Cardinal backcourt for
16 of his game-high 23 points. Stanford turned the
ball over 13 times and shot just 30 percent from the
field in that first period.
