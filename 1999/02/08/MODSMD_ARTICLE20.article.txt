# PA community concerned with development plans
## 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
On the agenda for the Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion's meeting Thursday morning
were Stanford's long-term devel
opment plans.
Some citizens, environmental
organizations and county board
members expressed concern re
garding the ambiguity of Stanford'*
future construction projects.
Since 1989, Stanford has been
developing under a general use
permit which allows 2.1 million
square feet of new growth.
After the construction of Kim
ball Hall, Lyman Graduate Resi
dences, Gates Science Building,
and the Science and Engineering
Quad, only 447,000 feet of possible
development remain.

Since the permit must be re
newed within the next two years,
many are asking for a specific out
line of future Stanford develop
ment.
"We need flexibility down the
road for changing academic needs.
The community, rightly so, wants
to know whi.t will be the long-term
effects," said Andy Ko. director of
community relations.
Ko added that the University is
currently working to formulate
long-term goals and is keeping an
open mind as to the best approach.
For local advocates, one issue of
contention is the format of the gen
eral use permit itself.
This permit classifies the Med
ical Center. Shopping Center and
the Foothills under different zon
ing laws than central campus, and a
special permit must be obtained for

construction within any of these
other areas.
Some worry that this piece-meal
style of development inhibits com
prehensive evaluation of issues
such as open-space preservation
and traffic congestion.
Denice Daid, activist for The
Committee For Green Foothills,
believes that the general use permit
is inadequate.
Daid pointed to traffic problems
on Page Mill and Sand Hill Court
Roads as evidence of poor develop
ment planning.
"Stanford should be responsible
for dealing with traffic on land that
they lease out. They need to deal
with its mitigation," said Daid.
In response to such attacks. Di
rector of Government and Com
munity Relations Larry Horton
notes that population growth with

in surrounding communities is re
sponsible for many traffic prob
lems.
Whereas 79,000 new jobs have
been created within eight peninsu
lar communities from 1900 to 1998,
less than 9.000 new homes have
been built.
Horton said that there has been
virtually no population increase on
the Stanford campus itself.
Palo Alto Mayor Garry Fazzino
agreed that "the traffic situation is
terrible," and the community is try
ing to address the problem.
"Palo Alto is looking very seri
ously into a Marguerite-type shut
tic system, an expansion of the Cal
train .... We also need to find a
way of reducing job growth," said
Fazzino.
The construction of a new Can
cer Center, to be located next to the

Children's Hospital, is also current
ly under review by the Palo Alto
community.
Mayor Fazzino says he would
like to see a serious discussion of
mitigation efforts before approving
the project.
Future University plans also in
clude new homes for faculty mem
bers in the West Campus area,
medical resident housing, and a
bio-centric interdisciplinary re
search facility.
University administrators are
preparing for a thorough discussion
of zoning issues at a more formal
planning meeting on March 4.
Local activists will be pushing to
change Stanford's entire general
use permit, and University admin
istrators foresee the development
of West Campus taking as long as
seven or eight years.
