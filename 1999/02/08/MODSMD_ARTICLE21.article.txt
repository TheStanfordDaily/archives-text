## SOFTBALL SEASON PREVIEW Cardinal softball ready to dig in for '99 campaign 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Breakout seasons are everyone's
dreams. It represents a foot in the
door of the national spotlight, a
chance to finally sit in the limelight
and know that other teams are
watching you extra carefully now.
But like any honeymoon, it ends
all too quickly and is directly fol
lowed by the really hard part.
The Stanford softball team made

history — as well as a name for itself
last season. The squad made its
first-ever appearance at an NCAA
Regional after finishing third in the
Pacific 10 Conference, another Car
dinal best.
But as milestones fall, more lie
on the road ahead. Now the team
has been bolstered by expectations
and a certain amount of hype, espe
cially with all 10 starters returning
and one of the nation's more im
pressive recruiting classes joining

the squad.
"I think the expectations are as
high as they've ever been as long as
I've been here as head coach," said
third-year skipper John Rittman.
"We're very high about this season,
especially because last year really
built up the team's confidence."
And with good reason.
The team that set the school
record with 41 wins last year and
three Third Team All-Americans
last year is ready to make more revi
sions to its history books. This year
has a weapon which has never been
in the Cardinal's arsenal — depth.

■ Today: No. 14 Stanford vs. Simon
Frasier, 2 p.m.

Stanford is two-deep at every po
sition, creating a versatility that any
coach would love to have. And with
that depth, an air of competition
within the team has been fostered.
"We have a lot of depth, which is
something we've never had in this
program," Rittman said. "1 think
that depth has provided us with a
spark. It's created this competitive
ness from within that's been very
positive.
"Definitely, the competition
from within has given us an edge
that we've never had before."
That competition should provide
a solid training ground for a Cardi
nal team that is slated to play what
could be its toughest schedule ever,
with three major preconference
tournaments scheduled in the next
month.
The Cardinal also has to face a
tough Pac-10 lineup which includes
No. 2 Arizona, No. 3 UCLA, No. 4
Washington. No. IN Arizona State
and No. 25 Oregon.
And while the team has been
preparing for a tougher roster of op
ponents through practice, the play
ing field is the only place it will truly
be able to gauge itself.
"The conference is as tough as

ever," Rittman said. "We know
we're going to have to play even
better (than last year]. The team
knows that and they've worked
extra hard.
"I just think we're at that point in
time where we need to play some
games. We kind of need the team to
get an identity. The biggest thing is
knowing how we're going to adapt
in certain situations."
Fortunately, the loaded roster
means that the Cardinal has a lot of
different options it can go with.
"The lineup is going to change
quite a bit," Rittman said. "I'his
year the lineup could change every
day, from game to game. We have to
try to get the players used to certain
roles."
The Cardinal is led from the
mound by returning pitchers Becky
Blevins and Marcie Crouch, both
seniors. Blevins had a breakout

year, setting school records from
wins (24), strikeouts (162) and ERA
(1.24). Crouch also chipped in 14
wins while compiling only a 1.35
ERA. The two combined for 36
complete games.
Crouch may he even more im
posing from the plate than from the
mound. Last year, she knocked in 34
runs and scored 28 times, and was
second in the team with a .307 bat
ting average.
But the big bat belongs to out
fielder Michelle Acosta. who is No.
1 on the all-time Stanford list for
RBIs (81) and doubles (29). She set
single-season records last year with
37 RBIs and 60 runs scored, and led
the team by batting .331.
Acosta is once again joined in the
outfield by senior Kelly Yablonski
and sophomore Ramona Shel
burne, and newcomer Jessica Men
doza adds more depth beyond the

diamond. Mendoza comes out of a
stellar career at Camarillo High
School in Southern California,
where she was named Los Angeles
Times Female Athlete of the Year
in 1998.
In the infield, sophomore Jenni
Shideler and seniors Jennie Foyle,
Michelle Schneider and Shane An
derson provide the veteran leader
ship while freshmen Sarah Beeson,
Robin Walker and Christina Chao
join the club
Shideler led the team with a stun
ning .995 fielding percentage at first
base last year, and Schneider set the
school record with 32 runs.
Junior Kellie Wiginton should
start behind the plate, and both
sophomore Brianna Ford and fresh
man Sarah Barnum can back up
Wiginton.

last season.

The Stanford softball team hopes to gain momentum for the coming season which kicks off today at 2pm
against Simon Fraser.
The team will need each player
to contribute if it hopes to make it
through the strong schedule. An
other top-three finish in conference
is the obvious goal, but with UCLA
returning many players who red
shirted during the Bruins' NCAA
probation last season, things are
going to be a lot tougher.
"We definitely expect to finish in
the top three [of the Pac-10]," said

Schneider. "UCLA is definitely
going to be better with some of the
redshirt coming back from last year.
It gives them an added dimension
that they were missing.
"Things are a lot more even this
year. It's going to be more of a bat
tle in the Pac-10 than it usually is, if
you can imagine that. But we also
want to focus on our out-of-region
games because those are important
for Regional play."
The Cardinal opens the 1999 sea
son today when it hosts Simon
Frasier today at 2 p.m.
