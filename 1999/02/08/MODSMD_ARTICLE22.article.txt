# Cardinal outlasts Fullerton to take two of three
## Stanford turns double play 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Stanford rode its newly found of
fensive firepower and the command
ing relief pitching of senior Tony
Cogan to win two of three games
from ( al State-Fullerton and move
back to .S(H) on the new season.
I he No. 7 Cardinal (3-3) strug-

gled for runs last
weekend and in
Friday night's
abysmal two-hit, 8-
0 loss to the 15th
ranked Titans (1-
2). However, after
scrapping together
a 6-5 win Saturday
night, Stanford

broke out for 13 runs Sunday after
noon and beat Fullerton, 13-7.
"It's huge to come back after an 8-
0 loss," Cogan said. "1 don't remem
ber being beaten like that for a long
time. To come back and win the next
few games shows a lot about our
team."
Junior catcher Damien Alvarado
led the charge for the Cardinal Sun
day, going 4 for 5 with a three-run
home run and five RMIs. Junior first
baseman John Gall, who only had
two hits in the first five games com
bined. had a single, a double and a
triple in Sunday's contest.
"I just came up there and relaxed
a little hit more than I have been,"
Gall said. "I was a little tense up
there the last few days."
The Titans took an early 3-0 first
inning lead Sunday off of freshman
left-hander Mike Gosling, reminis
cent of their 4-0 and 3-1 first inning
leads Friday and Saturday, respec
tively. However, the Cardinal an
swered back with its biggest inning of
the season, exploding for seven runs
in the second.

Sophomore right fielder Joe Bor
chard, Alvarado and junior desig
nated hitter Nick Day started the in
ning with three straight singles.
Alter junior second baseman Jeff
Rizzo walked to score Borchard,
freshman shortstop Scott Dragice
vich drove in Alvarado with his first
hit of the year.
Freshman left fielder Jason Van
Meetren, making his first collegiate
start in place of junior Craig Thomp
son. doubled down the left-field line
to score Day and Rizzo and give the
Cardinal a 4-3 lead. Junior center
fielder Edmund Muth followed with
an RBI sacrifice fly and Gall fol
lowed that with an RBI double.

Alvarado capped the scoring out
burst for the Cardinal by driving in
Gall with his second hit of the inning.
After the teams traded runs to
bring the score to H-4, Gosling again
got into trouble. In the bottom of the
fourth he allowed another run off of
two hits and a throwing error of his
own to bring the Titans within three
runs.
Sophomore left-hander Brad
Drew, who came in for Gosling in
the fourth, did not fare much better,
allowing Fullerton to score another
run in the fifth to creep within two of
the Cardinal.
However, just when Fullerton
seemed to be getting back in the
game in the sixth inning, Alvarado
jacked a home run deep to center

field, giving the Cardinal a comfort
able 1 1-6 lead.
After Drew allowed the Titans
another run in the bottom of the sev
enth. Cogan, the leader of the pitch
ing staff, came in to close the game.
In just under three innings, Cogan
allowed no hits and no runs and
struck out six while the Cardinal of
fense tacked on two more runs for
the win.
Cogan also pitched extremely
well Saturday night, picking up the
save in two innings of work. Coming
into a tight, back-and-forth 6-5
game, the senior shut Fullerton
down with an easy 1-2-3 eighth in
ning and a smooth ninth.
"Two years ago he was unstop
pable in those situations and it looks
like maybe he's got that stuff back."
Gall said.
"That's really important for us.
We've got a lot of young guys on the
staff who are going to be great at
times and who are going to stink at
times. It's important that he can be a
steady guy out of the pen."
Cogan was very happy with his
recent performances, especially in
light of the somewhat poor season he
had in 1998.
"I just have a real good feel for all
my pitches out there now," he said.
"Last year was a tough year for me,
so it's nice to know I'm back to the
way I know I can throw."
While Cogan was solid for the
Cardinal, few others pitched with
much distinction. Since sophomore
Jason Young's impressive outing
opening night, the starting pitching
has been especially suspect.
Friday, Young gave up five runs on
eight hits and five walks.
Saturday, sophomore Justin
Wayne struck out six in six innings,
