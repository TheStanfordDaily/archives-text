The Stanford women's swim
ming and diving teams fought tooth
and nail with Texas and Southern
Methodist on Saturday. When the
dust finally cleared, it was the Car

■ Friday: No. 4 Stanford (6-2) 215,
No. 11 Texas (3-4) 79.

In the seasons only three-team
dual-meet, No. 4 Stanford cruised

squeaked by the third-ranked SMU
Mustangs 153-147-
Probably facing the toughest

dual-meet schedule in the nation, a
physically unhealthy Cardinal was
dealt two decisive defeats in Janu

show in Austin, taking the 2(X)-yard
freestyle and individual medley

full of impressive times and impor

Hyman decisively won the fastest
race of the meet. With a time of
1:55.92, Hyman finished more than
a full second ahead of Moracova
and nearly three seconds ahead of
