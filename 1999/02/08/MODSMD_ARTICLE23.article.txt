The Stanford women's swim
ming and diving teams fought tooth
and nail with Texas and Southern
Methodist on Saturday. When the
dust finally cleared, it was the Car
dinal who emerged triumphant.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Friday: No. 4 Stanford (6-2) 215,
No. 11 Texas (3-4) 79.
■ Friday: Stanford 153, No. 3 SMU
(3-4) 147.

In the seasons only three-team
dual-meet, No. 4 Stanford cruised
passed No. 11 Texas 215-79 and
squeaked by the third-ranked SMU
Mustangs 153-147-
Probably facing the toughest

dual-meet schedule in the nation, a
physically unhealthy Cardinal was
dealt two decisive defeats in Janu
ary by No. 1 Georgia and then-No. 3
Arizona. Now. with just a few weeks
of recovery time, Stanford has re
asserted its position as a top con
tender for the NCAA Champi
onship title.
"We knew that they [the Mus
tangs] would be prepared for this
meet," said Stanford freshman Jes
sica Foschi.
Relatively unchallenged in its
own division, SMU looked to the
showdown with the Cardinal in
Texas' Jamail Swimming Center as
a chance to post NCAA qualifying
times and test its mettle against one
of the fastest squads in the country.
"They don't have as much depth
as some of the teams we've faced
this season," Foschi conceded. But,

what the Mustangs lack in depth,
they make up for in unbelievable
star power. As expected, SMU se
nior Martina Moracova put on a
show in Austin, taking the 2(X)-yard
freestyle and individual medley
events. Her time of 1:57.62 in the
2(X) IM is the fastest time recorded
in the nation this season.
But Stanford countered Moraco
va with its own star power in the per
son of Misty Hyman. Teammates
recognized Hyman's performance
as the most extraordinary in a meet
full of impressive times and impor
tant races. In the 2(X)-yard butterfly,
Hyman decisively won the fastest
race of the meet. With a time of
1:55.92, Hyman finished more than
a full second ahead of Moracova
and nearly three seconds ahead of
Stanford's Shelly Ripple.
The race was so fast that all three
swimmers were well under the auto
matic NCAA qualifying time of
2:00.09, a cut that no more than a
handful of swimmers achieve in
dual-meet season each year.
Hyman also dominated the 200-
yard backstroke and the 500-yard
freestyle in automatic qualifying
times. Though not typically regard
ed as a distance freestyle specialist.

Hyman's 500 time was among the
top 10 times in the nation posted
this season. Both her 2(X)-yard but
terfly and backstroke times put her
atop the list of this year's fastest
times.
While Hyman's heroics played
an integral part in the victory over
SMU, each swimmer's performance
proved crucial to the outcome.
"I've never been part of such a
great team effort," said senior Alli
son Fealey. Fealey contributed to
the win in the 200IM and the breast
stroke events, taking third in the 2(X)
breast with an impressive time of

2:19.79.
"Everyone did something excep
tional," added junior Siobhan Crop
per. "Everyone had a best time or a
great finish." Cropper pointed to
Elin Austevoll's come-from-behind
victory in the 2(X)-yard breaststroke
and Catherine Fox's fantastic 1(X)-
yard backstroke as two of the key
events in the meet.
Austevoll and Fox both posted
automatic NCAA qualifying times,
and their respective times of 2:12.37
and 54.30 put them both in the No. 2
slot of the nation's best times of the
season.

The Stanford diving squad faced
tougher competition than it has all
season. Normally dominant in the
one- and three-meter competitions,
the Cardinal divers were out-per
formed by SMU's Jenny Lingamfel
ter, one of the top talents in the
country. Stanford's Kim Powers
gave Lingamfelter a run for her
money in the three-meter competi
tion, taking a strong second for the
Cardinal. Carissa Zenorini was
Stanford's top contender in the one
meter competition, placing third be
hind Lingamfelter and Texas' Na
talia Diea.
