### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
In Tara VanDerveer's first 599 games as a head bas
ketball coach, she directed countless matches that were
seamless, elegant and fluid.
The same could not be said for her 6(X)th, a solid if
unspectacular 77-67 win over California Friday night.
The Cardinal (12-9, 8-2 Pacific 10 Conference), led
by Regan Freuen's 21 points, went to the free-throw
line 39 times in what VanDerveer called a "no-flow
game."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Friday: Stanford (12-4, 8-2 Pacific 10 Conference) 77,
California (8-11,2-8) 67.

By winning Friday, Stanford earned a chance to even
itself in the conference win column with Pac-10 leader
UCLA. The Bruins, who host Stanford this Friday, had
their lead cut to one and a half games after a 106-79 loss
to Oregon Thursday.
In Friday's game, play was aggressive on both sides,
with Freuen's l()-rebound attack from off the bench

pacing Stanford to its fifth consecutive victory.
VanDerveer praised the strong play of Freuen, the
squad's lone senior, who has scored in double figures
her last three games.
"She's knows she only has eight games left, and she's
playing with a sense of urgency and pride," VanDerveer

said.
Despite Cal's tight defensive play,
Stanford maintained a comfortable
lead for most of the game, thanks pri
marily to the Golden Bears' inability
to finish their shots. Cal (8-11, 2-8)
outshot Stanford 67-52 but only suc
cessfully completed 24 of those at
tempts.
The Cardinal's one scare came two

minutes into the second half, when Cal center Jennie
Leander made a layup to pull the Bears to within two
points, 43-41. Alter being fouled by Moos, Leander
made her first free throw to pull Cal within a point.
I hat was the closest Cal would come, however. Le
ander missed her second free throw and Stanford went


Freuen
on an 8-0 run, after which the Cardi
nal's lead never dropped below six
points.
Sophomore center Carolyn
Moos had a strong inside game, with
18 points and seven rebounds. Point
guard Milena Flores led the attack
from the floor, with seven assists and
four steals.
"Flores did a nice job of keeping
pressure on the guards," Cal head
coach Marianne Stanley said.
Perennial Cardinal whipping
post Cal put up a good fight in the
first half, trailing by only five and
outrebounding Stanford 24-17 at
halftime. The disparity was especial
ly acute on the offensive boards.

with Cal holding a 10-1 edge.
"I thought Cal was more aggres
sive, and it was reflected in their de
fense, their rebounding and their
posting up," VanDerveer said.
Thanks to the combined 9 of 11
first-half shooting from Moos and
Freuen, though, the Cardinal went
into the second half up 39-34.
The Cardinal picked up the pace
with 26 rebounds in the second half.
13 offensive. A large portion of the
credit again went to Moos and
Freuen, who shifted their emphasis
to the boards to compensate for the
Cardinal's lackluster second-half
shooting (9 of 26).
Stanford's frontcourt plav was
hurt by the loss of starter Sarah
Dimson, who missed her third
straight game due to a stress fracture
in her foot.

"We really miss her intensity, her
passion." VanDerveer said.
Dimson's status is still uncertain
for Friday's game against UCLA, al
though VanDerveer said, "she's get
ting my hopes up for [playing] next
game."
Cal was led by sharpshooting for
ward Paige Bowie, who scored a
game-high 25 points. Leander had a
double-double with 16 points and 10
rebounds.
The Cardinal's vaunted fresh
man class had a quiet night on Fri
day. The teams leading scorer. Lind
sey Yamasaki, had 11 points on 3-of
-11 shooting, and last Saturday's
breakout star. Enjoli Izidor, had a
quiet game. Forward Bethany
Donaphin paced the class of 2(X)2
with seven rebounds.
Freuen. who had a career-high 23

points against Arizona last Thurs
day, credited her rfecent stellar play
to her status as a senior.
"1 don't have many games left, so
I'm trying to have fun and be ag
gressive," she said.
Although Freuen started the sec
ond half, VanDerveer says that she
plans to keep her coming off the
bench for the near future.
"If things don't start out the way
I like them, I know I'll have her to
bring in," VanDerveer said.
The team's victory, the 12th con
secutive over Cal, gives Van-
Derveer a 470-130 record over 19
years of coaching at three schools. In
her 601st game VanDerveer's team
will have the chance to go back on
top in the Pac-10 Friday, a position
she has enjoyed for most of her 13-
