In Tara VanDerveer's first 599 games as a head bas
ketball coach, she directed countless matches that were
seamless, elegant and fluid.
The same could not be said for her 6(X)th, a solid if
unspectacular 77-67 win over California Friday night.
The Cardinal (12-9, 8-2 Pacific 10 Conference), led
by Regan Freuen's 21 points, went to the free-throw
line 39 times in what VanDerveer called a "no-flow
game."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
â–  Friday: Stanford (12-4, 8-2 Pacific 10 Conference) 77,
California (8-11,2-8) 67.

By winning Friday, Stanford earned a chance to even
itself in the conference win column with Pac-10 leader
UCLA. The Bruins, who host Stanford this Friday, had
their lead cut to one and a half games after a 106-79 loss
to Oregon Thursday.
In Friday's game, play was aggressive on both sides,
with Freuen's l()-rebound attack from off the bench

pacing Stanford to its fifth consecutive victory.
VanDerveer praised the strong play of Freuen, the
squad's lone senior, who has scored in double figures
her last three games.
"She's knows she only has eight games left, and she's
playing with a sense of urgency and pride," VanDerveer

said.
Despite Cal's tight defensive play,
Stanford maintained a comfortable
lead for most of the game, thanks pri
marily to the Golden Bears' inability
to finish their shots. Cal (8-11, 2-8)
outshot Stanford 67-52 but only suc
cessfully completed 24 of those at
tempts.
The Cardinal's one scare came two

minutes into the second half, when Cal center Jennie
Leander made a layup to pull the Bears to within two
points, 43-41. Alter being fouled by Moos, Leander
made her first free throw to pull Cal within a point.
I hat was the closest Cal would come, however. Le
ander missed her second free throw and Stanford went
