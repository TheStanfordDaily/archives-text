Not even the "Luckiest Man
Alive" could get the seventh
ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team (2-4, 1-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) out of its week
end struggles against the No. 11
USC Trojans (6-1, 5-0) and the
sixth-ranked Long Beach State
49ers (5-0, 3-0).

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Friday: No. 7 Stanford (2-4, 1-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) lost to No. 6 Long Beach State
(5-0,3-0)15-11,15-13,15-7.
■ Saturday: Stanford lost to No. 11
USC (6-1, 5-0), 15-11, 12-15, 15-3,
15-11.

In both Saturday's loss at USC
and Friday's defeat in Long Beach,
the Cardinal turned to senior out
side hitter Patrick Klein to get
Stanford out of its attacking slump.
Klein has been coined by his team
mates as "Luckiest Man Alive" for
his uncanny ability to make even
some of the most unbelievable
plays work in his favor.
Although Klein was the most ef
fective Cardinal outside hitter on
the court Saturday night, his efforts
were not enough as Stanford lost a
four-game match to the Trojans
after dropping a three-game con
test to the 49ers the night before.
"Patrick helped out much more
against USC," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "We got him
in early and he had more of a
chance to be effective.
"This weekend, we got another
strong indication that we have to
look at getting Patrick into the
starting lineup."
Klein entered the USC match in

the second game with the Cardinal
leading 9-5 and helped Stanford
close out the game.
"Patrick brought a lot of emo
tion to the match," said senior
team captain Jeremy Bart. "It
takes a lot to overcome the USC
crowd. He always seems to bring a
spark to the team."
Saturday night was no excep
tion.
The Stanford senior recorded
the second-highest number of kills
and the second-highest hitting per
centage among the Cardinal in the
USC match.
Klein received support from
Cardinal outside hitter Gabe
Gardner. The Stanford junior's
playing status was ambiguous due
to a stress fracture in his leg, yet
Gardner rose to the occasion of
playing against his former school.
Gardner competed as a Trojan
during his first two years of colle
giate eligibility before transferring
to Stanford.
After redshirting the 1997-98
season. Saturday's matchup
marked the first time Gardner
played at USC not in a Trojan uni
form.
Playing in this familiar environ
ment, Gardner recorded a match
high 28 kills and served five aces.
Although Saturday night Stan
ford remained competitive
throughout the match, Friday night
the Cardinal lost momentum early
on in game one despite starting out
to a 9-7 lead.
There was no luck in Stanford's
favor against the 49ers, as Long
Beach State cruised to the 15-11,
15-13,15-7 win.
Starting sophomore middle
blocker Dan Zhang injured his
knee in the first game while at
tempting to retrieve a hall. The
match was stopped for 15 minutes
while Zhang received medical at
tention, yet the sophomore was un
able to play for the remainder of
this critical weekend for the Cardi
nal.
He later received stitches on the
knee.
"Dan's injury hurt us because it
happened at a critical point in the

match," Bart said. "We had a lot of
momentum going and it took, the
wind out of our sails."
The starting middle blocker has
been a position of ambiguity and
inexperience for Stanford this sea
son, which makes Zhang's loss
even more critical for the Cardinal.
Bart stepped in for Zhang and
will be ready to play until Zhang
returns to full strength, which
could be as early as next week
when Stanford takes on Cal State-
Northridge and UC-Santa Barbara
at home.
