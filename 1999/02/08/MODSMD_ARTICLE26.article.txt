## Performance & Pricks My Postmodern Movement Experience 
### Chiara Smutina 
When I was 10, my dance teacher told me I had no
rhythm. "You are fat and clumsy!" she told me. I left the
hierarchical dance studio and lost contact with the
breathing, heaving orgasmic organism that is construed
as "my body." But through the Stanford Dance Depart
ment, I have rediscovered the sparkling splendor of my
inner self expressed through "my body." I sail like the
ocean on a putrid summer day. I feel my breath and lift
my arms and aaaah yes, this is art.
I first encountered Stanford's Dance Division
through the class "Obscure Forms of the Indonesian Fox
Trot." Through social dance I achieved interpersonal
connection and got laid, but I felt constrained by western
traditional constructs of rhythm and aestethics. I longed
to escape the metaphorical prison of dancing with music

and beats. I was ready to let go, to let the fettered butterfly persistently puls
ing inside my limbs express tne meaning of life through groping movement.
1 felt the fire burning bright within my pelvic arena and let it ourn for the
world to see.
For Spring Migration freshman year I preformed a piece entitled "wind."
I soared across the stage to the recordings of my own flatulence. The combi
nation of organic sound and aerodynamic movement expressed postmodern
ecological concerns from a multi-layered perspective. A special encore per
formance at the Stanford Coffee House encountered mixed reviews. The
uncultured engineering students dared to laugh, to scoff at my deep expres
sions. Art is not to be laughed at by little minds. My next piece, entitled
"death in a postmodern post-feminist society," will feature moments of calm
punctuated by spastic explosions of nervous twitches.
Other issues I wish to explore through movement include the Clinton
impeachment trial, hangnails in the postmodern evolutionary context and
my emerging sexuality. When I dance I am a still-life, a portrait and a land
scape â€”a wild, dense, marshy landscape crying out to the world. lam move
ment. I am feeling. I am the essence of monKeys at a Canadian zoo. I am
dance.
