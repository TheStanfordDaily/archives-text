# All the Farm's a Stage

### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
Those of you who have ever had the
honor of sitting through one of the many
plays produced by the Drama Depart
ment know that you have been blessed. It
is a privilege to witness obscurity in the
high concentrations that dominate these
prestigious shows. But we aren't quite sat
isfied. We know — and we are sure that
the department knows this as well — that
you can never get too strange or incom
prehensible on the stage.
While the shows slated for the rest of
the year seem a tad bizarre (rumors have
circulated that "Antigone" will be set in a
crackhouse), we feel that the department
could go the extra mile.
The following is a list of suggestions
for productions we'd like to see soon in
the Little Theatre, the Prosser Studio or
even Mem Aud. Some are risky, some are
bizarre, some are abstract, some don't

even make sense. All
belong at Stanford.

"THEILLIAD"
One actor
stands on a bare
stage and recites all
of the books of
Homer's epic over a
non-stop 22-hour
period. Delivery is
key: no vocal intona
tions or hand ges
tures allowed.
Previous produc
tions of this piece
have resulted in a
general fatigue of the
audience that
required hospitaliza
tion. To avoid this,
we suggest serving a
light breakfast half
way through the
show. But mind you
— the performance
will still continue.
Buy your tickets
early!

"OEDIPUS IN
A TURKISH
BATHHOUSE"

Warning: this is a steamy production.
People who can't stand the heat are
advised not to participate.
This will give the Drama Department
the opportunity to spend an exorbitant
amount of money excavating Mem Aud
and turning it into a giant, authentic
bathhouse (with artifacts flown in from
Turkey, mind you). Seating is in the actu
al baths. This gives the audience the
chance to really soak up the text.
Sophocles' rendering remains intact,
but all the water imagery simply enhances
the dramatic tension in the work. Bathing
suits are optional.
Audience members who urinate will
be escorted out of the theatre by men in
loincloths.

"LECTURE!"
In the tradition of Luigi Pirandello,
the master mixer of reality and appear
ance, the Drama Department will begin
selling tickets to various lectures around
campus and passing them off as high art.
Is it a lecture or a play? You decide.
Lecture notes will replace programs
at each performance.
"CHA UCER y S PHALLIC
ECSTACY: A FRIVOLOUS
ROMP WITH GEOFFREY IN
HIS FAVORITE CATHE
DRAL"
An all-nude production of "The Can
terbury Tales," featuring lurid accounts
from the monk, the friar, the pardoner
and the lusty Wife of Bath.
Trouble faces the pilgrims on the
road to Canterbury when they are arrest
ed for indecent exposure and thrown into
prison. Will they make it to the tomb of
Thomas Becket? Be there to find out.

"K... MY NAME IS KEANU!"
A celebration of song and dance ded

icated to mod
ern film's most
provocative
actor. Dances in
the style of
Martha Gra
ham and Wag
nerian tunes fill
the theatre with
joy and delight.
You'll leave the
show singing
"Dude of
Shakespeare"
and "There's
Something

About Keanu." Rentals of "Bill and Ted's

"THE CHAIR, THE PLANT,
THE TYPEWRITER AND
THE CONDOM"
A play with no actors, just props.
Come see what these inaminate objects
do —or don't. Peyote is given to the
audience upon request. What will hap
pen? It's all up to you.
"SEWER DREAMS"
Three strangers awake to find them
selves in a murky sewer, unable to escape.
Haunted by their existential angst, they
face inner demons and come to some
sort of realization. Profound and sensi
tive to the human condition.
"APRIL 5, 1990"
This is just a random date with no
historical significance. But imagine what
Anna Deavere Smith could do with it:
hard-hitting doucudrama! Various inter
views are conducted campus-wide, ask
ing people if they remember anything
about what happened on this day.
Someone might have sprained his
ankle. Some girl might have entered
womanhood. Someone on the Stanford
campus might have even read Intermis
sion before it fell on the ground. We can't
be sure. All that is certain is this: with
Anna playing all the roles in her riveting
style, nothing can go wrong.


One more orgy before we pray?


Excellent Adventure" and "A Walk in the
Cloud" are sure to reach record-breaking
numbers at the local Blockbuster.


It was this big!
