Whether shimmying in a Middle
Eastern restaurant or shammying
during U2's rendition of "Mysteri
ous Ways" in their ZooTV tour,
belly dancers today carry the art to
events and stages of all sorts. Stan
ford's own Di Yin Lu, a freshman,
brings the dance to campus every
Friday when she teaches a class in
Roble Gym at 6:30 p.m.
With shirts rolled up and tied to
show abdomens of all shades and

shines, a roomful of females tried
out Lu's belly dancing class for the
first time on Jan. 22. Lu started
teaching the class in the middle of
autumn quarter but began fresh with
a new group this quarter. She has
been belly dancing for about a year
and a half after her friend intro
duced her to it.and still takes
lessons.
"I wanted to practice belly danc
ing outside my own lessons, but I
couldn't find anyone else to do it
with." Lu said, "so 1 started the
class." Her goals are to help people

learn the basic motions and eventu
ally move on to choreographed
movements and even performances.
Eventually, Lu wants to start a
belly dancing club and bring in an in
structor to teach beyond what Lu
can do on her own. She encourages
women of all races, ethnicities and
shapes to try out belly dancing â€”
adding that she has seen, for in
stance, white and Japanese belly
dancers as well as small-figured
dancers.

Freshman Di Yin Lu demonstrates "a marketable
skill," in the words of one of her bellydancing stu
dents.
