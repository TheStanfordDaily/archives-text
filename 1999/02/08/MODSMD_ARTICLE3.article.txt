### Essan Ni Contributing writer 
Whether shimmying in a Middle
Eastern restaurant or shammying
during U2's rendition of "Mysteri
ous Ways" in their ZooTV tour,
belly dancers today carry the art to
events and stages of all sorts. Stan
ford's own Di Yin Lu, a freshman,
brings the dance to campus every
Friday when she teaches a class in
Roble Gym at 6:30 p.m.
With shirts rolled up and tied to
show abdomens of all shades and

shines, a roomful of females tried
out Lu's belly dancing class for the
first time on Jan. 22. Lu started
teaching the class in the middle of
autumn quarter but began fresh with
a new group this quarter. She has
been belly dancing for about a year
and a half after her friend intro
duced her to it.and still takes
lessons.
"I wanted to practice belly danc
ing outside my own lessons, but I
couldn't find anyone else to do it
with." Lu said, "so 1 started the
class." Her goals are to help people

learn the basic motions and eventu
ally move on to choreographed
movements and even performances.
Eventually, Lu wants to start a
belly dancing club and bring in an in
structor to teach beyond what Lu
can do on her own. She encourages
women of all races, ethnicities and
shapes to try out belly dancing â€”
adding that she has seen, for in
stance, white and Japanese belly
dancers as well as small-figured
dancers.

Freshman Di Yin Lu demonstrates "a marketable
skill," in the words of one of her bellydancing stu
dents.
"It's good to be full-figured with
large hips so people can see the
movements more clearly, but small
people can definitely belly dance
too," Lu said. "You can also add
things to the costume to emphasize
the movements."
According to Lu, such moves in
clude chest undulations and snake
arms. The latter involves shoulder
muscles and triceps to make the
arms flow in a non-angular manner.
The hip also plays a large role in the
dance.
"You use muscles you wouldn't
normally use," concurred Karin
Oen, a junior who attended the first
class. "It was really complicated,
with lots of oscillating body parts, a
lot of hands and belly and hips."
Fellow first-time belly dancer
Sheila Chanani. a junior, reports that
her stomach was sore after moving
in ways it had not before.
"I expected [the class] to be more
of a go-in-and-shake-your-butt
thing, but it's a lot more disciplined,
a lot of technique," Chanani said.
Oen, who has training in classical

dance, has always wanted to try belly
dancing.
"I want to be able to shake my
belly," Oen said, adding with a smile,
"I think it's a pretty marketable
skill."
Chanini said that when people
hear about her taking the class, they
react by asking her to demonstrate.
"They all want a piece of the ac
tion," Chanini said.
On the other hand, Oen stated
that a lot of the guys she knows per
ceive belly dancing as demeaning
and wonder why she does it.
"They say things like 'why don't
you just take a pole-dancing class?' "
Oen said.
While it may appear that belly
dancing is a sexual art, Lu asserted
that while the dance is indeed sensu
ous, it is not erotic.
"There's a stereotype that we're
strip-teasers," Lu said, "but it's just a
folk dance."
Whether for recreational or pro
fessional purposes, belly dancing is
more than stereotypical female exhi
bition. It is a cultural art form, a
source of enjoyment for those whose
muscles are not aching too badly,
and, as Chanani put it, "a girl bond
ing experience."
