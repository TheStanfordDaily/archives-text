# El-Amin too much in UConn win
## 
### Brian Eule Senior staff writer 
The top-ranked Connecticut
Huskies came to Maples Pavilion on
Saturday having just lost their first
game of the season a few days prior
and without their biggest star.
Richard Hamilton, the forward

who averages 22.1
points per game for
the Huskies and
who, just a month
ago, grabbed nine
rebounds and
scored 39 points
against Boston
College, was out a
second straight

game with a bruised right thigh.
As the nation waited to see if the
No. 4 Stanford Cardinal could hand
thv highly touted Huskies their sec
ond loss of the season, liamilton was
forced to watch the game in street
clothes from the sidelines.
Hut the true sign of a top-tier team
is that when one leader goes down,
there is somebody else immediately
ready to step up and take his place.

Enter sophomore guard Khalid
El-Amin.
Not exactly a newcomer to the
UConn team, El-Amin has started in
57 of his 58 collegiate games over the
past two years and has been a natural
leader for this team.
Furthermore, El-Amin has tradi
tionally been a crowd favorite — to
be picked on.
Standing at 5-foot-10,203 pounds,
he has been called "doughboy,"
"pudge" and "fatboy." But this week
end, one more cruel name was added
to the list.
"Deadbeat dad."
"That really hurt me," said El-
Amin, who was married, divorced
and a father all by the age of 17.
"That's not true at all. I take care of
my kids."
El-Amin, however, felt he got the
last laugh.
With Hamilton out, and playing in
a hostile road environment, the
UConn point guard knew that the
Huskies would need to jump out to a
quick lead. Playing Stanford, an ex
perienced squad packed with veter
ans, El-Amin also realized that just

about any late Cardinal comeback
was possible.
"We knew we had to get out to a
good start and I wanted to be the one
to lead," El-Amin said. "Coach [Jim
Calhoun] emphasized that we were
going to have to have one of our bet
ter games. I just wanted to lead by ex
ample."
So he did.
While the crowd was poking fun at
him, El-Amin scored seven of the
Huskies' first 11 points and helped
UConn jump to a quick 22-6 lead.
"Early in the game, we just
jumped on his shoulders," said
UConn head coach Jim Calhoun,
whose team defeated Stanford 70-59.
"He responds very well and he's
emotional during the game. Other
people feed off him."
Stanford's opening minutes were
more of a struggle, as the team turned
the ball over 13 times in tlu: first half,
leading to several El-Amin breaks.
"It's very difficult to simulate how
quick they are," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "They re
ally got after us."
And while the Cardinal was even

tually able to climb back into the
game, those first minutes didn't help.
"We don't want to be down," said
Stanford guard Arthur Lee. "We
want to be in control of the game.
Fighting back, that takes a toll."
Forward Mark Madsen agreed.
"UConn did all the right things in
the first few minutes of the game and,
in my opinion, that made the differ
ence," he said. "They have a lot of
competitors on their team. They out
hustled us."
Although he averages 13.4 points
per game. El-Amin made good on his
promise to lead the way for the
Huskies, as he dished out a game
high five assists in addition to his
game-high 23 points.
Not bad for a "fatboy."
"I just try to come out and be as
aggressive as possible," El-Amin
said. "The hard work is paying off. It
was just a great feeling for me and the
whole team."
It wasn't the same feeling for the
Cardinal, however.
And though Stanford was in the
game up until the last minute, the end
result was probably not fun either.
