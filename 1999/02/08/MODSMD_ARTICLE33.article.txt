### Rebecca Rettig Editorial staff 
If the No. 1 Stanford men's swim
ming and diving team wasn't so dy
namic, its meets this season could get
boring. The ( Cardinal (10-0,3-0 Pacif
ic 10 ( onference) consistently crush
es one opponent after another, never
wasting time to break pool records
both at home and away. It could get
boring if Stanford didn't always have
some team member with a great
swim, surpassing anyone's expecta
tions.

Barbara (5-4) 48.
■ Saturday: Stanford 124, No. 4 USC
(6-1,3-1 Pac-10) 117.

Hut it is never boring and this past
weekend's meets were no different.
During its own swim team Parent's

Weekend, the team breezed past No.
15 Nebraska (8-3), the unranked UC-
Santa Barbara Gauchos (5-4) and
No. 4 USC (6-1, 3-1), breaking
records along the way and also hav
ing great individual swims.
"The meets this weekend puts us
in a very gix>d position going into
Pac-lOs," sophomore Anthony
Robinson said. "The meet against
I ISC" was a lot closer than we wanted
it to be. Their team obviously had had
some rest for this meet, but they real
ly pushed our guys to the max."
On Friday, Stanford beat the Ne
braska Cornhuskers 169-106 and the
Gauchos 211 -48. But Friday's meet
held more than victory for the Cardi
nal; the swimmers broke two pool
records.
The momentum of the meet was
set at the beginning when Stanford
captured the top three places in the
first two events. Senior co-captain
Justin Ewers won the 1 (X) yard back
stroke (48.75) and sprinting standout
Robinson grabbed a win in the 1(X)
breaststroke with a time of 55.50.
Ewers was an individual dual winner
of the meet on Friday, placing first

again later in the meet in the 50
freestlye (20.42).
After the two big Stanford wins,
the other senior co-captain, Dod
Wales, broke the pwl record in the
1(H) butterfly with a time of 47.11,
qualifying him for the NCAAs. Be
sides breaking the record, Wales also
clocked the second-fastest time in the
nation behind Comhusker Adam
Pine, who came in second to Wales at
Friday's meet.
"I never thought about breaking
records before because of the great
swimmers that came before us,"
Wales said. "To be in the same league
with the swimmers of the '80s and
'90s, to go faster in that pool than any
one had before is really satisfying."
The other Cardinal record-setting
swim came at the end of the meet.
The 4(X) freestyle relay record was set
in 1993, but was broken Friday by the
team of Ewers, junior co-captain
Glenn Counts, sophomore Adam
Messner and Wales in 2:56.67, almost
over one second faster than the old
record of 2:57.37.
Stanford kept up its anything-but
boring strategy in the next day's meet

against USC by winning 124-117, this
time setting four pool records. The
Trojans are the only other Pac-1()
team ranked within the top five na
tionally, so the Cardinal had a gcx)d
chance to scope out some of its heavy
competition at the upcoming Pac-10
Championship meet in early March.
"This is the first weekend that we
really stepped up and became the real
team to beat," Wales said. "We have
been ranked No. 1 all season, but the
rankings mean nothing until this
point in the season" when Pac-l()s
and NCAAs are coming up.
The Cardinal kept up Friday's
momentum on Saturday by starting
off the meet not only with a win, but
also with a pool record in the 4(X)
medley relay (3:12.32) over two sec
onds faster than the record set last
year and the fastest time in the coun
try by more than two seconds as well.
Tate Blahnik, the country's fastest
backstroker, started the event by set
ting a record of his own and meeting
the NCAA qualifying time in the 100
backstroke (47.76). Robinson, Ewers
and Wales swam the other legs of the
record-setting relay.
"Setting records shows that we are
where we were last year in prepara
tion for NCAAs, but a little faster,"
Robinson said.
Wales kept up his explosive swim
ming streak by adding to the medley
relay's record with his leg of the 1(X)
butterfly. Five events later in the 100
freestyle, Wales captured yet another
ptxil record with a time of 43.90.
Blahnik sustained the previous
day's breathtaking backstroking by
placing first again. Blahnik also cap
tured the other pool backstroke
record in the 200 with a time of
1:42.78.
