# Polo shows power in win over Bruins
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
It's always nice to start the season
off with a win.
And the No. 3 Stanford women's
water polo team couldn't have
asked for a bigger win than Satur
day's 4-3 victory over the top
ranked, three-time defending na
tional champion UCLA Bruins.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (1-0, 10
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
4, No. 1 UCLA (0-1,0-1), 3.

"The whole team is so excited,"
sophomore Kris Koblek said. "It's a
great way to start things off right."
Stanford's home opener was also
its Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion season opener. And with the
competition being the highly touted
UCLA powerhouse, the Cardinal
women were in high spirits going
into the match.
"The girls were really looking
forward to this game," Stanford
head coach John Tanner said. "They
had plenty of motivation to win."
Stanford started the game off
with a goal from sophomore Dani
Bell in the first quarter. The Cardi
nal held the Bruins scoreless until
UCLA tied things up just 1:17 into
the second quarter, with a goal from
freshman Elaine Zivich. But Stan
ford freshman Kate Pettit answered
back two minutes later with a sec
ond Cardinal goal, off an assist from
Koblik.
The Bruins battled back in the
third quarter. UCLA senior Aman
da Gall scored on a man-up oppor
tunity with just 1:55 left in the peri
od. Once again, Stanford replied
with a goal from Koblek in a 6-on-5
Cardinal advantage, which gave
Stanford a 3-2 lead going into the
final period of play.
At 2:46, Koblik scored her sec
ond gqal lor the Cardinal. Once
again, the left-handed Koblik scored
from the six position in a Stanford
man-up situation.
Although Zivich managed to
score a third goal for the Bruins with
1:38 left in the match, the Cardinal
played strong defense and came
away with the 4-3 upset.
"Converting our 6-on-5 [oppor
tunities] was key because there were
so many kick outs," said senior
goalie Heather Crary, who notched
10 saves for the Cardinal during the
match. "We ran our rotations and
executed [our plays]."
"It comes down to 6-on-5 a lot,"
Tanner said. "And that was all set up

by good passing and composure.
We've got two lefties playing a lot
and we've got a number of good
shooters. And we can play people at
a number of posisitons."
While Stanford made the most of
its man-up advantages, the team's
front-court offense was less success
ful.
"We didn't convert a lot of our
opportunities to put the game
away," Tanner said. "We still have
to get a lot better. We've got to be
more energetic in front of the goal
and not take our opportunities for
granted. We have to create opportu
nities on offense."
On defense, the Cardinal was fo
cused on breaking down the Bruins
attack and tiring out their quick
players right from the outset of the
game. Stanford got strong defensive
play in the hole from senior Nicole
Glazer and sophomore Anne-Marie
Keenan, which helped shut down
UCLA's attack.
"We mixed it up on defense,"
Crary said. "Our first few plays were
scripted and we could see they were
confused. Our defense was good for
the most part and we only had a cou
ple of lapses."
"[UCLA is] a fast, great team,"
Tanner said. "We wanted to move
to get them tired. We wanted to be
active and make them play a lot of
defense."
And that's just what the Cardinal
did. UCLA goalie Erin Golaboski
played a strong defensive game, tal
lying six saves for her squad, but
Stanford's offense proved to be
more than the Bruins could handle.
In the last possession of the
game, UCLA came close to scoring,
but Stanford held fast and denied
the Bruins the tie.
"It was neat to come down to that
last possession and have to stop
them," Tanner said. "The girls real
ly were determined."
Not only were the girls deter
mined — they were prepared.
"We've been working on our
game and on fundamental things,"
Koblik said. "We did a good funda
mental job and that's what showed.
And it's going to get better through
out the season."
While Stanford still has a long
way to go with over 20 games this
year, Saturday's win has definitely
set the tone for the season. In spite
of the loss of some key players this
year, the victory over UCLA proved
that the Cardinal squad is stronger
than ever.
"It's so awesome," Crary said.
"It's the best feeling, especially since
there were people who doubted us."
