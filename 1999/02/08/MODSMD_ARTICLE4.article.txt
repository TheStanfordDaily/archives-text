# March Protests Dining
## 
### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
Protesting against the planned
reorganization of Dining Services, a
group of students and food service
employees marched to the office of
Shirley Everett, associate director
of Dining Services, on Friday after
noon.
Unfortunately, for the marchers
Shirley Everett wasn't in her office.
She was home with the flu.

According to a petition marchers
planned to present to Everett, the
union representing the employees -
Service Workers International
Union â€” accepted the reorganiza
tion without the consent of union
members.
The petition also claims that the
plan will weaken service by placing
employees in kitchens where they
do not wish to work. Moreover,
teams of service workers may be
separated by the plan.

However, a letter from Dining
Services management states the
plan is "not a matter of removing
employees from the dining halls, it is
a matter of ensuring that the right
person is in the right place with the
right skills at the right time."
Rachel Brunette, a senior major
ing in East Asian Studies, helped
organize the protest. Volunteering
as an English tutor for many of the
dining service employees, she no
ticed that "people were really
upset."
"I'm not usually a student ac
tivist," Brunette said, but "there
have to be other ways to cut costs
and make the food a little better."
According to Brunette, reorga
nization will affect 114 workers.
However, Rafi Taherian, execu
tive chef for Dining Services, dis
agreed. "Realistically," he stated,
"I would not estimate a large num
ber would move from one dining
hall to the other."
The union newsletter claims
that administrators "told the work
ers that either management would
make the decision on the schedules
and corresponding changes, or that
[union officials] could decide to bid
the schedules by seniority."
The union further alleges that
this decision had to be made on
the spot. It suggests a special con
ference to remedy what it terms "a
hasty and ill-informed decision."
According to Taherian, the
union had "plenty of time" to de
cide whether to accept the deal. He
said the allegations that the union
was forced to respond to the reor
ganization plan on the same day are
"false."
"We sat down and provided op
tions for the union," he said, and
"they knew exactly what was hap
pening."
Wanda Alderman, a Manzanita
worker, who also helped organize
the protest, said she is worried
about losing the "family-like rela
tionship with the students" if work
ers are forced to move.
Yet Taherian said management
has "heard from most employees
that they are happy with this." He
said only people who have worked
at Stanford for a short period of
time are unhappy with the deal.
Teherian said that "ultimately
we feel that this will benefit all din
ing halls tremendously."
