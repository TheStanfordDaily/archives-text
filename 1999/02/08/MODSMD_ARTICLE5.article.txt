# Students help nation struck by earthquake

The Stanford Colombian Students' Association so
licited donations and distributed flyers last week to aid
victims of the recent earthquake in Colombia.
A 6.0 earthquake struck Colombia's heavily popu
lated coffee belt on the afternoon of January 25. killing
nearly 1.000 people, injuring more than 4,000 others
and leaving 250,000 homeless, hungry and fearful.
" The main need for these people now is food and
shelter," said doctoral student Mauricio Mora, the as
sociation's president. "But here in the U.S. it's more ef
fective to send cash donations." Mora and other mem
bers of the association raised $80 in cash donations and
distributed more than 250 flyers.
Nearly 300 people approached the association's
table in White Plaza, 15 of whom gave money on the
spot. Others may have donated larger sums through al
ternative recommended channels. Mora said.

and shelter. But here in the U.S. it's more
effective to send cash donations.'

The association's members were "pleasantly sur
prised," when several students offered to hang flyers
and hold meetings in their dorms, he added. Still, Mora
worried that the peak of interest has passed and that
people are already beginning to forget a disaster that
has only just begun.
Some Stanford students, buried in books and
preparing for midterms, may not even know the earth
quake took place. Freshman Silvana Rodriguez, whose
parents are Colombian, only learned of the disaster
when her roommate's mother called to inquire about
her family's well-being.
Armenia, a city with a population of 280,000, sus
tained the most damage. Survivors mourned their dead
as the body count continued to rise.
In response to riots and looting, the Colombian gov
ernment sent 6,000 troops into Armenia and called for
international aid. Within four days of the disaster, 290
tons of aid were sent to the region that needed 150 tons
of food daily, Colombia's President Andres Pastrana
told CNN.
Rodriguez's relatives live nearly 100 miles from the
regions effected, but they have family friends in Arme
nia. She said that it is likely that her friends "have lost
everything."
Stanford doctoral student Luis Fernando, an associ
ation member, described pre-earthquake Armenia as
"the showcase of Columbia ... one of the areas that
was most thriving."
Not any more. About 70 percent of the buildings, in
cluding 15,000 houses, were demolished by the quake,
Reuters said.
The survivors had to endure more than 37 after
shocks in the four days following the quake, some
reaching as high as 4.1 on the Richter scale, according
to CNN. Fernando said that four or five families that he
knows are now living in one house.
Mora said that it was especially important to raise
awareness of the Colombian earthquake in the Bay
Area, because "we face a similar situation [here]... but
probably people forget that it is possible for us."
The 1989 Bay Area earthquake ranked 7.1 on the
Richter scale, caused massive fire damage, bisected the
Bay Bridge and short-circuited San Francisco, leaving
the city in darkness for the first time since the Great
Quake of 1906.
Aid to the Colombian earthquake relief movement
may be sent by cash or check to the Colombian Earth
quake Relief Fund at any Bank of America Branch
(Account # 04080-08269) or call the American Red
Cross' International Response Fund at 1-800-435-7669.
