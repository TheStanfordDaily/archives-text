# Computers to evaluate GMAT essays
## 
### Corinne Yates 
Can a computer enjoy a great
essay?
Beginning Wednesday, the
essay portion of the Graduate
Management Admission Test
(GMAT), a standardized test re
quired by the Graduate School of
Business and most every other
business school, will be scored in
part by computer.
In the past, essays were evaluat
ed by two human readers. A com
puter robot known as "E-Rater"
will now take the place of the sec
ond human reader.
This marks the GM AT's second
move toward computer technology
within a short period.
In June 1997, Educational Test
ing Service along with the Gradu
ate Management Admissions
Council administered their final
"paper and pencil" GMAT exam.
It has since been replaced by the
Computer Adaptive Test.
Instead of giving a pre-selected
number of questions with mixed
difficulty levels, the CAT begins
with a question of medium difficul

ty and then generates harder or
easier questions based upon a cor
rect or an incorrect response.
These technologies allow the
multiple choice test score to be
processed while the student is still
at the test center.
Lan Harrington, a graduate stu
dent in the Business School, did not
mind the new changes.
"I vastly prefer the computer
ized GMAT," Harrington said.
"When you know before you
leave the testing room how well
you did, you can modify your ad
missions strategy accordingly,"
concluded Harrinton.
The trend among standardized
tests appears to be moving away
from the generic paper-based
exam.
Like the GMAT, the Graduate
Record Examination will also be
come solely computer-based be
ginning this April.
Kaplan Educational Services re
ported "astronomical" growth dur
ing the final months of the paper
based GMAT, so it is expected that
the new GRE format could also
mean a mad rush to the testing cen-

"I took one of the last paper and
pencil GMATs two years ago," re
marked MBA student Guillermo
Reyes.
"I knew if I waited six more
months then it would only be of
fered on the computer," he said.
"I like to have the opportunity
to go back to the more difficult
questions after I have skimmed
over the test," concluded Reyes.
Reyes admitted that using the
computer-based version would
cause him some anxiety because
"most people prepare for the test
with a paper and pencil."
MBA student Adi Mannor, who
also took the paper-based GMAT,
stated, "I definitely would prefer
having the test on paper. I think it
would be harder to read using the
computer."
Even more controversial than
the new testing technology is the
new scoring procedure for the
essay.
Many students, having never
heard of this new method, thought
the idea was absurd.
"I don't see how a computer

reader can possibly respond to how
people write," said Nomaan Mirza,
another MBA student.
Harrington, also surprised by
the new procedure, did not show
much concern since graduate
schools generally require personal
statements of their own.
"It's not the essay portion of the
GMAT that matters anyway," she
explained.
"I doubt anyone in the Gradu
ate School of Business can even tell
you what score they got on the
essay; it's a formality."
Kevin McMullin, a spokesper
son for educational service compa
ny The Princeton Review, said that
the computer is programmed to
look for the same factors as human
essay graders, namely structure
and vocabulary.
In the event that the scoring of
the human reader and the E-rater
differ by more than a point, a third
human reader will make the final
call.
McMullin advises that students
do not attempt to be "too creative"
but rather "just give the graders
what they are looking for."
