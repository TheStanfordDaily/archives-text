Discounts on lift tickets for anyone who uses a Wells Fargo ATM.
!■■■■■■ Now anyone can get great savings on great slopes, whether you strap one
I board to your feet or two. Just stop by a Wells Fargo ATM with the Snow
Sport Express symbol and you can buy discount vouchers
good for lift tickets and lesson packages at Heavenly, Northstar, Sierra or
Sugar Bowl. You don't even have to be a Wells Fargo customer. But if you sign
up for our Student Banking Combo, you'll get Student ATM Checking, a
Student MasterCard® and free online banking. Not to mention bankers who
move so fast to serve you, you'd swear they were going to catch air.
