# Stanford debates labor complaint

The thorny issue of affirmative
action for women in relation to hir
ing, tenure and promotion in a uni
versity setting has sparked a recent
debate among administrators,
legal scholars and the federal gov
ernment.
The discussion centers around
what sorts of goals and timetables
for adequate gender representa
tion in university faculty and re
search staff, if any, are required by
federal guidelines in fields where
the Labor Department finds there
to be "underutilization" of women
by a university. In addition there is
disagreement over the types of
policies universities are allowed to
enact to strive for those goals.
Goals and timetables
In a statement to the Faculty
Senate Thursday, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper reiterated
the University's opposition to
"firm numerical goals on a specific
timetable" for hiring or tenure of
female faculty or staff members.
"I share the provost's reserva
tions about such an idea, which
could easily be seen as a quota," he
continued.
However, according to the Of
fice of Federal Contract Compli
ance Programs Web site, the types
of goals required by federal regula
tions "do not create set-asides for
specific groups."
Rather, "the goal-setting
process in affirmative action plan
ning is used to target and measure
the effectiveness of affirmative ac
tion efforts to eradicate and pre
vent discrimination."
According to Vice Provost for
Faculty Relations Robert Weis
berg. Stanford has general goals to
reach the Labor Department's tar
get of "full utilization."
But on the issue of establishing
timetables to reach those goals,
Weisberg said, "if you start getting
extremely specific about numbers
and timetables, the distinction be
tween timetables and quotas be
comes very, very difficult."
"It's a matter of interpreting the
legal notion of timetables," he said.
Angel Luevano, district direc

tor of the OFCCP, expanded upon
the guidelines for employment
goals for women.
"If an employer is underutiliz
ing, they must set a goal based on
availability" within the field in
question, he said.
Luevano defined "underutiliza
tion" as "fewer women or minori
ties in a job group than would be
reasonably expected by their avail
ability."
Goals are specific and annual,
and reviewed at the end of each
year to measure progress toward
the goal, he said.
"We look to the good-faith ef
forts that were made, not whether
goals were met," he said.
Federal regulations do not
allow the OFCCP to punish em
ployers for failing to reach goals,
according to the office's Web site.
Law Prof. Tom Donohue char
acterized the University's position
in terms of this attitude by the
OFCCP.
"Stanford would say, 'We have
in place this procedure, and as long
as we're making good-faith efforts,
we're in compliance,"' he said.
But the OFCCP's emphasis on
good-faith efforts does not mean
employers can avoid setting goals.
"If you identify that there is an
underutilization, there is an obliga
tion to come up with a plan that in
cludes goals and timetables,"
Donohue said.
Said Luevano, "we would have
to cite a contractor if they did not
set [annual] goals" regardless of
other good-faith efforts. "They
would be in violation."
Stanford's policies
Though lacking specific annual
goals, Stanford has in place a de
tailed program of affirmative ac
tion in hiring.
Faculty openings at Stanford
are posted at the widest possible
range of sources for candidates, in
cluding graduate schools and pri
vate industry, and especially in
places where female and minority
candidates are more likely, Weis
berg said.
