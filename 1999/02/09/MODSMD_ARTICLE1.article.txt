# Stanford debates labor complaint

### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
The thorny issue of affirmative
action for women in relation to hir
ing, tenure and promotion in a uni
versity setting has sparked a recent
debate among administrators,
legal scholars and the federal gov
ernment.
The discussion centers around
what sorts of goals and timetables
for adequate gender representa
tion in university faculty and re
search staff, if any, are required by
federal guidelines in fields where
the Labor Department finds there
to be "underutilization" of women
by a university. In addition there is
disagreement over the types of
policies universities are allowed to
enact to strive for those goals.
Goals and timetables
In a statement to the Faculty
Senate Thursday, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper reiterated
the University's opposition to
"firm numerical goals on a specific
timetable" for hiring or tenure of
female faculty or staff members.
"I share the provost's reserva
tions about such an idea, which
could easily be seen as a quota," he
continued.
However, according to the Of
fice of Federal Contract Compli
ance Programs Web site, the types
of goals required by federal regula
tions "do not create set-asides for
specific groups."
Rather, "the goal-setting
process in affirmative action plan
ning is used to target and measure
the effectiveness of affirmative ac
tion efforts to eradicate and pre
vent discrimination."
According to Vice Provost for
Faculty Relations Robert Weis
berg. Stanford has general goals to
reach the Labor Department's tar
get of "full utilization."
But on the issue of establishing
timetables to reach those goals,
Weisberg said, "if you start getting
extremely specific about numbers
and timetables, the distinction be
tween timetables and quotas be
comes very, very difficult."
"It's a matter of interpreting the
legal notion of timetables," he said.
Angel Luevano, district direc

tor of the OFCCP, expanded upon
the guidelines for employment
goals for women.
"If an employer is underutiliz
ing, they must set a goal based on
availability" within the field in
question, he said.
Luevano defined "underutiliza
tion" as "fewer women or minori
ties in a job group than would be
reasonably expected by their avail
ability."
Goals are specific and annual,
and reviewed at the end of each
year to measure progress toward
the goal, he said.
"We look to the good-faith ef
forts that were made, not whether
goals were met," he said.
Federal regulations do not
allow the OFCCP to punish em
ployers for failing to reach goals,
according to the office's Web site.
Law Prof. Tom Donohue char
acterized the University's position
in terms of this attitude by the
OFCCP.
"Stanford would say, 'We have
in place this procedure, and as long
as we're making good-faith efforts,
we're in compliance,"' he said.
But the OFCCP's emphasis on
good-faith efforts does not mean
employers can avoid setting goals.
"If you identify that there is an
underutilization, there is an obliga
tion to come up with a plan that in
cludes goals and timetables,"
Donohue said.
Said Luevano, "we would have
to cite a contractor if they did not
set [annual] goals" regardless of
other good-faith efforts. "They
would be in violation."
Stanford's policies
Though lacking specific annual
goals, Stanford has in place a de
tailed program of affirmative ac
tion in hiring.
Faculty openings at Stanford
are posted at the widest possible
range of sources for candidates, in
cluding graduate schools and pri
vate industry, and especially in
places where female and minority
candidates are more likely, Weis
berg said.
Departments must keep
records of the diversitv of candi

dates in an initial applicant pool
and along through the process, he
said.
As the search proceeds, "|de
partments and schools] are obligat
ed (hy administration mandates) to
try to maintain diversity in the
pool. .. and must justify a narrow
ing of the pool" that would reduce
diversity, Weisberg said.
The final selection decision is
made purely on the basis of qualifi
cations, he said.
Weisberg also described the
Faculty Incentive Fund, a pool of
money controlled by the Provost's
Office to fund "opportunity hires"
of faculty who would diversify a de
partment.
The fund has been used "typi
cally three to 10 times per year over
the hist decade" across the Univer
sity, he said.
Additionally the I Iniversity reg
ularly compares the percentage of
women within any field at Stanford
with the national percentage of
women in that field, according to
Weisberg.
Schools and departments that
fall particularly under the national
percentage for women "are under
a stronger set of instructions to
narrow the gaps that need to be
narrowed."
Weisberg noted that low
turnover of Stanford faculty
"less than 2 percent per year"
slows the rate at which Stanford
can pursue gender equity.
One past Stanford policy that
might have sped up that process is
no longer in effect, though recent
developments in labor law may
have made that policy illegal re
gardless.
The policy in question was artic
ulated in 1983 by then-Dean of 1 lu
manities and Sciences Norman
Wessells, according to a report on
the status of female faculty at Stan
lord given to the faculty last May.
According to the report, Wes

sells set a policy in a letter to then-
Provost Albert Hastorf regarding
women and minority faculty
tenure, that "in those cases that are
truly borderline, where the deci
sion could go either way, [it) is re
solved in favor of the candidate."
The report indicates that the
policy was changed in 1993, under
then-Dean of H&S John Shoven
and Provost Condoleezza Rice, to
a policy of "no separate standards"
for tenure.
The current administration dis
putes that the change occurred
under Rice. It bases its claim on a
1985 report on tenure by Wessells
that states that "affirmative action
does not include separate stan
dards of evaluation at the time of
review for tenure."
However it is possible that the
two policies co-existed, depending
on the changing definition of "sepa
rate standard" as well as the decen
tralized nature of I Jniversity hiring.
"It's possible that you can have
an articulated policy.. . and a prac
tice that differs at lower levels,"
said Donohue.
But, he added, "generally, the
courts have been moving in the di
rection that explicit favoritism.. . is
a violation" of federal law requir
ing equal protection under the law.
he said. Thus the policy if enacted
today, could well be ruled illegal.
Wessells was unavailable for
comment.
Undcrutilization?
Another turning point of any al
legation of gender discrimination
in hiring or promotion is whether
undcrutilization is occurring.
The OFC( "P places great weight
on the availability of women in the
pool of candidates for a job in a
particular field, according to Lue
vano, in determining whether an
employer should be hiring or pro
moting more women.
Given that tenure is a lifetime
appointment and that candidates
are largely competing against a
university's established standards.

"we'd have to consider it different
ly." Luevano said.
"The bottom line is, what's the
criteria that's being applied" to de
cide tenure cases.
Luevano said that in a case in
volving tenure, the OFCCP might
look historically, or at individual
cases, to try to find instances of dis
crimination.
"We look for a pattern and
practice of disparate treatment or a
pattern and practice of disparate
impact" in regards to women. Lue
vano said.
While the standard of "treat
ment" requires proof of intent to
discriminate, he said, the "impact"
standard is often broken by a "fa
cially neutral policy which is uni
formly applied but has a dispropor
tionate impact on a group."
Stanford currently employs 18.1
percent female faculty across the
University and 2K.2 percent female
tenured and tenure-track faculty in
the humanities, the highest per
centage of any major subset of the
faculty.
Duke University, for compari
son, employs 35 percent female
faculty in tenured and tenure-track
positions in the humanities.
Duke's policies, which establish
affirmative action at hiring but no
separate standards at the time of
tenure, are largely the same as
Stanford's.
"We encourage aggressive re
cruitment of women and minorities
into pools" for hiring, said John
Burness, senior vice president for
public affairs at Duke. Also, like
Stanford, "the standards for pro
motion and tenure are the same...
it's the quality of the person's
scholarship."
However Duke does have spe
cific numerical goals for the hiring
of women and minorities that are
addressed regularly, according to
Burness.
The enumerated goals include
women hired into tenure-track po
sitions and women granted tenure,
he said, as well as separate goals for
other university staff groups.

dates in an initial applicant pool
and along through the process, he
said.
As the search proceeds, "|de
partments and schools] are obligat
ed (hy administration mandates) to
try to maintain diversity in the
pool. .. and must justify a narrow
ing of the pool" that would reduce
diversity, Weisberg said.
The final selection decision is
made purely on the basis of qualifi
cations, he said.
Weisberg also described the
Faculty Incentive Fund, a pool of
money controlled by the Provost's
Office to fund "opportunity hires"
of faculty who would diversify a de
partment.
The fund has been used "typi
cally three to 10 times per year over
the hist decade" across the Univer
sity, he said.
Additionally the I Iniversity reg
ularly compares the percentage of
women within any field at Stanford
with the national percentage of
women in that field, according to
Weisberg.
Schools and departments that
fall particularly under the national
percentage for women "are under
a stronger set of instructions to
narrow the gaps that need to be
narrowed."
Weisberg noted that low
turnover of Stanford faculty
"less than 2 percent per year"
slows the rate at which Stanford
can pursue gender equity.
One past Stanford policy that
might have sped up that process is
no longer in effect, though recent
developments in labor law may
have made that policy illegal re
gardless.
The policy in question was artic
ulated in 1983 by then-Dean of 1 lu
manities and Sciences Norman
Wessells, according to a report on
the status of female faculty at Stan
lord given to the faculty last May.
According to the report, Wes

sells set a policy in a letter to then-
Provost Albert Hastorf regarding
women and minority faculty
tenure, that "in those cases that are
truly borderline, where the deci
sion could go either way, [it) is re
solved in favor of the candidate."
The report indicates that the
policy was changed in 1993, under
then-Dean of H&S John Shoven
and Provost Condoleezza Rice, to
a policy of "no separate standards"
for tenure.
The current administration dis
putes that the change occurred
under Rice. It bases its claim on a
1985 report on tenure by Wessells
that states that "affirmative action
does not include separate stan
dards of evaluation at the time of
review for tenure."
However it is possible that the
two policies co-existed, depending
on the changing definition of "sepa
rate standard" as well as the decen
tralized nature of I Jniversity hiring.
"It's possible that you can have
an articulated policy.. . and a prac
tice that differs at lower levels,"
said Donohue.
But, he added, "generally, the
courts have been moving in the di
rection that explicit favoritism.. . is
a violation" of federal law requir
ing equal protection under the law.
he said. Thus the policy if enacted
today, could well be ruled illegal.
Wessells was unavailable for
comment.
Undcrutilization?
Another turning point of any al
legation of gender discrimination
in hiring or promotion is whether
undcrutilization is occurring.
The OFC( "P places great weight
on the availability of women in the
pool of candidates for a job in a
particular field, according to Lue
vano, in determining whether an
employer should be hiring or pro
moting more women.
Given that tenure is a lifetime
appointment and that candidates
are largely competing against a
university's established standards.

"we'd have to consider it different
ly." Luevano said.
"The bottom line is, what's the
criteria that's being applied" to de
cide tenure cases.
Luevano said that in a case in
volving tenure, the OFCCP might
look historically, or at individual
cases, to try to find instances of dis
crimination.
"We look for a pattern and
practice of disparate treatment or a
pattern and practice of disparate
impact" in regards to women. Lue
vano said.
While the standard of "treat
ment" requires proof of intent to
discriminate, he said, the "impact"
standard is often broken by a "fa
cially neutral policy which is uni
formly applied but has a dispropor
tionate impact on a group."
Stanford currently employs 18.1
percent female faculty across the
University and 2K.2 percent female
tenured and tenure-track faculty in
the humanities, the highest per
centage of any major subset of the
faculty.
Duke University, for compari
son, employs 35 percent female
faculty in tenured and tenure-track
positions in the humanities.
Duke's policies, which establish
affirmative action at hiring but no
separate standards at the time of
tenure, are largely the same as
Stanford's.
"We encourage aggressive re
cruitment of women and minorities
into pools" for hiring, said John
Burness, senior vice president for
public affairs at Duke. Also, like
Stanford, "the standards for pro
motion and tenure are the same...
it's the quality of the person's
scholarship."
However Duke does have spe
cific numerical goals for the hiring
of women and minorities that are
addressed regularly, according to
Burness.
The enumerated goals include
women hired into tenure-track po
sitions and women granted tenure,
he said, as well as separate goals for
other university staff groups.
The thorny issue of affirmative
action for women in relation to hir
ing, tenure and promotion in a uni
versity setting has sparked a recent
debate among administrators,
legal scholars and the federal gov
ernment.
The discussion centers around
what sorts of goals and timetables
for adequate gender representa
tion in university faculty and re
search staff, if any, are required by
federal guidelines in fields where
the Labor Department finds there
to be "underutilization" of women
by a university. In addition there is
disagreement over the types of
policies universities are allowed to
enact to strive for those goals.
Goals and timetables
In a statement to the Faculty
Senate Thursday, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper reiterated
the University's opposition to
"firm numerical goals on a specific
timetable" for hiring or tenure of
female faculty or staff members.
"I share the provost's reserva
tions about such an idea, which
could easily be seen as a quota," he
continued.
However, according to the Of
fice of Federal Contract Compli
ance Programs Web site, the types
of goals required by federal regula
tions "do not create set-asides for
specific groups."
Rather, "the goal-setting
process in affirmative action plan
ning is used to target and measure
the effectiveness of affirmative ac
tion efforts to eradicate and pre
vent discrimination."
According to Vice Provost for
Faculty Relations Robert Weis
berg. Stanford has general goals to
reach the Labor Department's tar
get of "full utilization."
But on the issue of establishing
timetables to reach those goals,
Weisberg said, "if you start getting
extremely specific about numbers
and timetables, the distinction be
tween timetables and quotas be
comes very, very difficult."
"It's a matter of interpreting the
legal notion of timetables," he said.
Angel Luevano, district direc

tor of the OFCCP, expanded upon
the guidelines for employment
goals for women.
"If an employer is underutiliz
ing, they must set a goal based on
availability" within the field in
question, he said.
Luevano defined "underutiliza
tion" as "fewer women or minori
ties in a job group than would be
reasonably expected by their avail
ability."
Goals are specific and annual,
and reviewed at the end of each
year to measure progress toward
the goal, he said.
"We look to the good-faith ef
forts that were made, not whether
goals were met," he said.
Federal regulations do not
allow the OFCCP to punish em
ployers for failing to reach goals,
according to the office's Web site.
Law Prof. Tom Donohue char
acterized the University's position
in terms of this attitude by the
OFCCP.
"Stanford would say, 'We have
in place this procedure, and as long
as we're making good-faith efforts,
we're in compliance,"' he said.
But the OFCCP's emphasis on
good-faith efforts does not mean
employers can avoid setting goals.
"If you identify that there is an
underutilization, there is an obliga
tion to come up with a plan that in
cludes goals and timetables,"
Donohue said.
Said Luevano, "we would have
to cite a contractor if they did not
set [annual] goals" regardless of
other good-faith efforts. "They
would be in violation."
Stanford's policies
Though lacking specific annual
goals, Stanford has in place a de
tailed program of affirmative ac
tion in hiring.
Faculty openings at Stanford
are posted at the widest possible
range of sources for candidates, in
cluding graduate schools and pri
vate industry, and especially in
places where female and minority
candidates are more likely, Weis
berg said.
Departments must keep
records of the diversitv of candi

dates in an initial applicant pool
and along through the process, he
said.
As the search proceeds, "|de
partments and schools] are obligat
ed (hy administration mandates) to
try to maintain diversity in the
pool. .. and must justify a narrow
ing of the pool" that would reduce
diversity, Weisberg said.

cations, he said.
