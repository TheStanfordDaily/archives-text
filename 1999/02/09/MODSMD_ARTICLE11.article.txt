# Senate trial moves toward close
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - It was
a long shot from the beginning,
trying to remove President Clin
ton from office, and the odds have
only gotten worse. House prosecu
tors now appear to be appealing to
history, rather the Senate, in
search of a favorable verdict.
Senators should act "not just
for today, but for the ages to
come," implored Rep. Bob Barr.
R-Ga. t in final arguments on Mon
day.
But for today, at least, the case
to make Clinton the first Ameri
can president removed for high
crimes and misdemeanors
appeared to be moving inexorably
toward a dead end.
Clinton's acquittal later this
week is being predicted by sena
tors in both parties, as it has been
for weeks.
Still, ignoring the winds of pub
lic opinion and the realities of Sen
ate arithmetic, the House man
agers forged ahead in their final
arguments.
If the Senate fails to convict the
president, "we still are satisfied.
We can live with our conscience.
We did the right thing," Rep.

Henry Hyde, R-111., chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee,
told reporters.
The Senate appears far short of
the 67 votes needed to convict the
president on the two articles of
impeachment.
Talk has turned to how many
GOP senators would vote for
acquittal — and on the logistics of
the next step, an expected resolu
tion of censure.
"This is a movie and we know
what the ending is," said Stuart
Rothenberg, an independent ana
lyst who publishes a political
newsletter.
He said House managers were
going through the motions "to
play out the constitutional process.
And they are trying to establish a
record to show that their case is as
strong as possible."
The focused, single-minded
determination of House managers
— in fact, of all Republicans on
the House Judiciary Committee —
to resolutely pursue the impeach
ment process to its conclusion
appeared to rule out the possibili
ty of any bipartisan compromise
along the way.
