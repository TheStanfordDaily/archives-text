Proposed faculty housing
construction is a good faith
effort in the right direction

FOR A HOUSING crunch (hat
affects all of Stanford's facul
ty, 36 new apartments and sin
gle-family homes don't seem like
much of a solution. They aren't.
What they are is a good start.
If University President Gerhard
Casper accepts one of three propos
als submitted to him last week by the
Office of Institutional Planning —
all of which call for the construction
of 36 new housing units on southeast
campus — then in a few years the
University will have three dozen
more answers to one of the biggest
questions facing any faculty recruit:
Where can a professor's salary land
you in a market where the median
price of single-family home is
around $8()(),()()()?
It's a problem that has been
plaguing Stanford since Bay Area
housing prices took off several years
ago. Now, it's having a measurable
effect on the University's ability to
attract top names.
Vice Provost for Institutional
Planning (re off ('ox said last week
that "the housing shortage in areas
around the University has gotten so
severe that we are having a terrible
time recruiting faculty."
I'he plans released last week are
the most concrete proposals to date
toward addressing that problem. All
along. University officials have
vowed to fight the shortage by build
ing on existing land. However this
proposal has drawn fire from local
homeowners concerned about cam
pus urbanization.
Unfortunately, the University
doesn't have the money to substan
tially raise professor salaries or buy
large amounts of off-campus hous

ing for its junior faculty. The Univer
sity does have the right to build on
its own land, however, and if Casper
approves one of the three plans (as
expected), it will.
To its credit, the Office of Institu
tional Planning has drafted three
options that address the housing
crunch while still making an effort to
preserve Stanford's "rural charac
ter."
All of the proposals call for 20
apartments on Dolores Street in a
space now occupied by a makeshift
parking lot and a little-used basket
ball court. They all would also create
parks in neighborhoods surrounding
the new single-family homes.
One plan would even spare May
field Playfield, an open lot across the
street from Durand and Slavlianskii
Dom that is a popular recreation
area for students and other neigh
borhood residents.
The 36 total units, though hardly a
comprehensive solution to the hous
ing problem, provide a solid first
step while minimizing environmen
tal impact.
The Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders, a campus homeowner
advocacy group, is holding a town
hall meeting at 7 p.m. Feb. 23 in
Kresge Auditorium to discuss the
planning office's recommendations.
Though the group has been criti
cal of campus building plans in the
past, its fight appears to be lost. The
University is set to build, and though
it says nothing is final, bet on Casper
choosing one of the three plans
soon.
With that in mind, the homeown
er group should consider spending
much of its meeting weighing the
options before Casper. The chance
to stop building may be past, but the
opportunity to influence where the
University decides to place the new
homes has not.
