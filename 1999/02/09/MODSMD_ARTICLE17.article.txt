# Campus Viewpoint: T.J. Babbitt
## Technology is not a panacea 
### 
IF YOU ARE looking
to get funding for a
project at Stanford, a
good way to start would be
to claim that you are going
to use technology to revo
lutionize teaching and
learning. One of the things

that has characterized the Stanford adminis
tration in the 1990s is a certain optimism that
new technologies are going to improve abso
lutely everything.
So its no wonder that experimental tech
nology-intensive courses keep cropping in a
lot of departments. The temptation for a
department to get more funding by joining in
on a new teaching fad dictated from above,
whether it be Stanford Introductory Studies,
Freshman/Sophomore College or what have
you, must be intense.
Undergraduates often wind up as the
guinea pigs in these technology experiments.
The Web page of a class I am taking refers to
students taking the class as "study partici
pants."
I'm prejudiced against this enthusiasm for
incorporating computers into every class
room. My first experience with technology in
learning at Stanford was negative.
We were promised that a decked-out
classroom called the Meyer Flexible Class-
Lab, with its very own technical support per
sonnel, would enable us to learn second-year
French far more effectively than it had ever
been learned before. Yes, the room was sup
posed to help us learn French.
Hut this was no ordinary room. This room
had it all. Interlocking tables, bean bags, a
projection screen and Ethernet sockets all
over the floor for the Powerbooks we were
given at the beginning of class.
The idea was that we would learn French
by doing, by creatively using technology. We

could make a Web page, for example,
exchange e-mails with other French students
across the country or make a film. Anything,
as long as it involved the use of expensive
equipment.
We decided to make a film. The film orig
inally had a plot, but devolved into us filming
each other goofing off at various locations on
campus, sometimes in French. We used the
Powerbooks to write e-mails when things got
dull.
A pretty predictable result. But the weird
thing is, I think our teacher honestly expect
ed that we would be so excited about all of
these gadgets that we would spontaneously
organize ourselves into happy autonomous
French-learning groups and be unusually
productive.
This was only a couple of years ago, but I
think, at best, little has changed since then.
Most people, even at Stanford, are not so
naive as to expect the Internet and comput
ers to unleash human creativity in a way
never before seen in human history. The
experiments with computer technology are a
little more focused.
The course I'm taking now is an attempt
to have students at Stanford's overseas cam
puses work together on the Internet to put
together projects that research similar insti
tutions in various cultures, like opera or uni
versities. The technology makes what hap
pens in the course possible, but the content
of the course is once again central.
Hut the exaggerated faith in a potential
educational revolution lives on. The Stan
ford Learning Lab, which created the Web
site for the course, seems ecstatic in its
descriptions of the course. According to
them, I am "a pioneer" in "a very new type
of course" and the Web pages I log onto
"represent a pivotal tool in my ability to
learn and share."

Why this push for more technology in the
classroom? One of the reasons is certainly to
explore the few fundamental possibilities
that new technologies open up, like this
attempt to take advantage of the fact that
students at multiple overseas campuses can
bring different experiences and research pos
sibilities to a course.
But the real reason behind the adminis
tration's push is mostly an economic one.
First of all, Stanford wants to license the
"learning technology" it develops to other
teaching institutions through its Educational
Ventures Office, and undergraduates are a
test market to see what sinks and what
swims.
Secondly, Stanford is dedicated to finding
new markets for its own educational "prod
uct," and information technologies are a
great way to push its courses to new "stu
dents" in the Bay Area and all over the coun
try.
Another eventual goal is to try to make
undergraduate education itself more effi
cient. Whatever that means.
University President Gerhard Casper
wrote ruefully in his pamphlet "Cares of the
University," "Due to the personnel-intensive
traditional modes of teaching, universities, in
the past, have not participated in the produc
tivity gains in the economy that, ironically,
can be traced to the very discoveries ulti
mately attributable to universities,"
What Casper is implying here is that
classes with teachers who interact with indi
vidual students personally may not be pro
ductive enough.
1 wonder if we are we participating in
experiments that will eventually help under
mine what a university is all about?
