launting went too Jar
I .1111 sure that my letter will be one of
many you receive regarding the embarrass
ing behavior by our student "fans" at the
men's basketball game versus Connecticut
on Saturday.
I'm not especially sensitive, and I've
chuckled under my breath at many of the
|iast actions ol the Stanford Hand and other
rowds Stanford supporters. But the cruel,
immature, and unjustified taunting of
Khalid I'l-Aniin 111 Saturday's game made
me. and others I'm sure, not want to wear
their Stanford sweatshirts off campus for a
while.
I just can't understand what motivates a
group of people to display signs such as
"Another Bastard Child" and to chant
"Deadbeat Dad" to someone just because
he is a college student with children.
While I know that these sort of tasteless
messages are not indicative of our student
body as a whole, it reinforces the stereo
type around the Bay Area and the nation
that Stanford is a place for a bunch of priv
ileged. elitist and sheltered brats who think
themselves above those unlike themselves.
I strongly support free speech and
expression. And 1 generally dislike having
the administration meddle in student
affairs. But, since it seems that the goal of

the school is to have strong athletic pro
grams in order to send a positive message
to the national consciousness, it must he
concluded that the Sixth Man Club is
undermining that effort.
Something needs to change. Soon.

Scholes article misleading
Please note that the final paragraph of
the Feb. 5 article entitled, "Scholes
returns," is quite misleading.
The losses of Long Term Capital Man
agement were completely unrelated to the
Black-Seholes formula. The Black-Scholes
option pricing model is a mathematical for
mula which determines the value of an
option based upon the value of the under
lying stock. The formula is a true arbitrage
model, not a "market predictor" as the arti
cle suggests.
LTCM lost betting that the spreads rela
tive to U.S. Treasuries of corporate and
emerging market bonds would decrease.
When Russia defaulted on its bonds in
August, prices of emerging market bonds
fell dramatically and U.S. Treasuries rallied
sharply, resulting in a historically unprece

dented widening of spreads. LTCM col
lapsed because they had bet such a scenario
would never occur.

I greatly appreciate Mark Silver's will
ingness to ask whether Stanford undergrad
uates (with whom I do happen to have had
a great deal of experience) are passionate
about ideas and willing to challenge their
own (and each others') understandings of
the world.
I would like, however, to propose broad
ening the discussion in two ways. First, my
concern about the somewhat desultory intel
lectual atmosphere for undergraduates at
Stanford is by no means limited to the class
room; I worry, too, whether there is very
much intense, engaged ethical and intellec
tual discussion in dorm rooms or dining
rooms on campus.
Here is a place where the fact that Stan
ford students work so hard, a fact pointed to
by some of my critics, is no longer irrelevant,
but actually detrimental. All those class
assignments leave less time for free-form
intellectual exploration with friends and
acquaintances, especially if free time is often

taken up watching Jerry Springer or playing
video games.
Second, the question of Stanford under
graduates' intellectual engagement may
perhaps be better addressed by faculty and
graduate students, those who have experi
ences of the intellectual atmospheres on
other campuses. How does Stanford mea
sure up in this regard?
My own partly informed observation,
which prompted my initial letter, is that
Stanford has a number of admirable pro
grams, including Structured Liberal Educa
tion, aimed at creating a serious intellectu
al environment (and they've recently
announced another one), but that the rest
of the student body (with isolated excep
tions, of course) goes through four years
without the benefit of such an environment.
Just as analysts of primary and secondary
education are now wondering whether it
might be better to leave the top students
mixed in with the rest — as is done in the
rest of the world, and as has been shown in
some studies to benefit the majority of stu
dents without harming the top group — I
wonder whether Stanford ought simply to
end SLE and its other specialized programs,
and help these already more intense stu
dents energize the rest of their peers.
