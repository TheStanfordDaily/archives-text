# Senators propose ASSU split
## Amendment would separate grad, undergrad branches 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
Citing the undergraduate focus of
the ASSU Senate, senate leaders
have proposed dividing the institu
tion into graduate and undergraduate
branches, although both would re
main under the auspices of the ASSU.
The proposal also calls for under
graduates to take over payment of
three-fourths of the student general
fees, raising undergraduate fees
about $25 per year.
The ASSU will discuss the propos
al in its meeting today and could vote
on it Feb. 23. If two-thirds of the sen
ate approves the changes, the student
body will vote on them in the spring
ASSU election.
Under the proposal, the ASSU
would be composed of a 15-member
undergraduate senate and a 15-mem
ber Graduate Student Council. The
graduate student arm would be an ex
tension of the current GSC, a three
year-old council under the auspices of
the ASSU. The ASSU vice president
would be a member of both bodies,
and the leadership of both branches
would participate in an "executive

council" with the president and vice
president.
The new CISC', unlike the ASSU,
would require no quorum and have
no standing committees.
Regardless of the branch division
being approved or not approved, all
representatives will be elected in the
1W Spring General Election. This
flexibility is possible, because the new
graduate branch would operate by
consensus.
The Senate "is a rigid, lithified, al
most ossified structure; it is institu
tional memory with a vengeance,"
said 1 larris Shapiro, primary author
of the proposal and a member both of
the CISC and ASSIJ Senate. "They
get caught up in writing bills and
amendments.
"In the CISC', everything is done by
consensus â€” the debate itself is the
vote. This method works well, sur
prisingly well."
The CISC ' was the organizing force
behind the graduate student housing
rally last spring and has organized a
number of successful graduate stu
dent social events, including a Hal
loween party and a Thanksgiving din
ner.

Part of the proposed change in
volves general fee payments, which
fund student activities through the
Programming, Community Service
and Publications Boards. Currently
undergraduates pay $194,(XX), or 44
percent, of the general fees, and grad
uate students pay $243,(XX), or 56 per
cent, according to ASSU Financial
Manager Matt Garlinghouse.
Most of the fees, however, go to
support undergraduate program
ming.
"Cirad students feel unnerved, as
they should, that they're paying all
this money and not seeing the bene
fits," said Senate Chair Adam Weiss,
a junior.
Under the proposed system, gen
eral fees would be split between the
two arms of the ASSU, with the GSC
gathering and dispensing its own
funds.
Shapiro estimated that graduate
students would require about
$120,(XX) to fund programming, one
third of the $354,000 predicted for un
dergraduates. He added that these es
timates are only preliminary.
This shift would mean that either
undergraduate fees would need to in

crease or programming would de
crease.
"I would be lying if I said it wasn't
a concern to me that general fees are
going up," said ASSU President
Maren Norton, a senior.
Weiss is concerned that the split
might limit the effectiveness of the
ASSU.
"I want to make sure that in the
eyes of the University we are seen as
one cohesive organization," he said.
"It's a balancing act; we want to
change the internal structure but
show the University that the associa
tion represents all Stanford students."
"One thing 1 am not willing to do is
create two separate senates."
Norton said she believes that the
ASSU would still remain a united
voice.
"The executive committee will
continue to meet weekly; plus they
can call a joint meeting of both hous
es," she said.
According to ASSU Graduate
Senator Dave Robinson, another of
the proposal's authors, "We're al
most correcting a problem, because
the GSC is doing a whole bunch of
things now" without being the official
representatives of the graduate stu

dent body.
The idea developed early this fall,
according to Norton.
"It involved formal and informal
discussion between members of the
GSC, senators and random con
cerned people," she said.

They felt the change was neces
sary, ASSIJ Vice President Santos
Marroquin, a senior, explained, be
cause graduate and undergraduate
students have different goals in join
ing the senate.
"Undergrads take part in the

ASSU to see how government
works," he said. "Grad students join,
because they're pissed off about some
thing ... and want to get stuff done."
