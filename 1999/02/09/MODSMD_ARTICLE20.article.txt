## Card beats Penn State and UCLA 
### Ramona Shelburne Contributing writer 
Technically speaking, last Fri
day night's women's gymnastics
meet at Maples Pavilion between
No. 8 Stanford, No. 5 Penn State
and No. 10 UCLA was at home for
the Cardinal.
But the host Cardinal had never
competed or even practiced at
Maples Pavilion before Friday
night.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Friday: No. 8 Stanford (5-1)
194.050, No. 10 UCLA (7-3) 193.900,
N0.5 Penn State (5-2) 191.650.

And so, instead of having the ad
vantage of competing on the unusu
ally bouncy floor at Maples Pavil
ion like most of the Stanford teams
that play there, the women's gym
nastics team was forced to adjust to
the "home court advantage" at
Maples just like its two visitors.
'it was really like a neutral meet
because we had never competed
there before," said Stanford sec
ond-year head coach Mark Cook.
During pregame warmups, sev
eral Cardinal gymnasts had trouble
with the timing of their floor exer
cises and vaults, forcing the coach
ing staff to juggle the starting lineup
right before the start of the match.
Instead of letting the foreign
court get the best of it. however, the
Cardinal (5-1) responded with one
of its best performances of the year
(194.050) and defeated both the Pa
cific 10 Conference rival Bruins (7-
3), who finished second with a team
total of 193.9(H), and the Lady Lions
(6-2), who ended up in third place
with a team total of 191.650.
Penn State had come into the
Chili's "Red Hot" Invitational un
defeated through six matches and
one week removed from setting a
school-record team total of 196.750
against then No. 15 Florida.
Adjusting to the floor at Maples
was not the only thing the Cardinal
had to overcome Friday night, how
ever.
Prior to the meet, Stanford star
Larissa Fontaine underwent
surgery for a broken finger suffered
two weeks ago against California
and the Cardinal had to find a
leader who could fill the void left by
its only Ail-American — senior co
captain Amy Murakami.
For the second week in a row,
Murakami took home first-place
honors in the uneven bars competi
tion with a near-perfect routine.
Last week against then No. 13
Oregon State, Murakami set a new
school record with a 9.975 to cap

ture lirst place on the bars and was
subsequently named the Pac-10
Gymnast of the Week for her ef
forts.
Friday night, she was almost as
good on her high-flying bars rou
tine, earning a 9.950 from the
judges.
In addition to setting the pace
lor the Cardinal early in the meet
with her bar routine, Murakami
was consistent throughout the com
petition as she recorded no score
lower than 9.7(H) and clinched the
team title for Stanford with a 9,875
on the floor exercises that earned
her second-place honors.
"Amy is just a phenomenal com
petitor." Cook said. "She really has
a presence about her when she gets
into competition."
Besides Murakami, sophomore
Jen Exaltacion stepped up her per
formance en route to a second place
finish in the all-around competition
with a Cardinal season high 39.075.
Exaltacion showed little residual ef
fects from the injured foot she had
been nursing for the past week as
she took home second place on
both the balance beam (9.850) and
the uneven bars (9.9(H)).
Leading the Bruins was senior
Kiralee Hayashi who won the all
around competition with a total of
39.150. Hayashi was among the top
three finishers in three events in
cluding a first-place finish in the
floor exercise with a 9.9(H) and a see

ond-place lie with Exaltacion on the
bars with a 9.900.
Penn State senior Missy
Leopoldus took home third place in
both the all around competition
(38.875) and the balance beam with
a 9.825.
According to Cook, Friday
night's win was more than just a
boost for Stanford's win-loss record.
I he Cardinal showed that it could
still be a factor in the national cham
pionship hunt without Fontaine in
the lineup.
"We are really lucky to have such
depth on our team this year," Cook
said. "I think that we have a lot of
character this year and that's really
good for postseason competition be
cause you have to be able to deal
with adversity in the postseason."
