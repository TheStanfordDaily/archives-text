# Freshman Irvin wins tournament
## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
Zuzana Lesenarova of the Uni
versity of San Diego, the nation's

top-ranked sin
gles player, was
on a mission last
weekend at the
Rolex Indoor
Championships
in Dallas, Texas.
She planned to
do something no
eolle g i a t e

women's player
had ever done before â€” win a third
straight Intercollegiate Tennis As
sociate Grand Slam.
Her mission was stymied in the
semifinals, however, by the in
spired play of Stanford freshman
Marissa Irvin, who went on to take
the tournament crown.
The fourth-seeded Cardinal de
fined herself as one of the tourna
ment's top contenders as she relin
quished a mere five games in her
first three matches. In the quarter
finals. Irvin bludgeoned Kansas'
Kris Sell, 6-0, 6-0.
As Irvin and Lesenarova plowed
through their early-round oppo
nents, it became clear that the win
ner of their semifinal clash would
likely prevail in the tournament
final.
The highly-anticipated semifinal
did not disappoint, as the two
women battled through three sets.
Irvin overpowered the top seed for
a 6-1 first-set score, but the cagey
Lesernova drew upon her experi
ence to take the second set in a tie
breaker. Irvin rebounded in the
third, however, and closed out
Lesernova. 6-3.
Irvin's opponent in Sunday's
final was Georgia's Marissa Catlin.
Catlin was the No. 1 player in the
nation heading into last May's
NCAA Championships, but was
forced to withdraw due to a bout
with mononucleosis.
Catlin was back in full force
against Irvin. taking the freshman
sensation to a first-set tiebreaker,
which Irvin won, 7-4. Irvin took
control of the match in the fourth
game of the second set, when she
broke Catlin to even the set at 2-2.
From there. Irvin won 21 of the last
27 points and four of the last five
games for a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 triumph.
"I wanted to make her play the
points, and she broke down a little
bit," Irvin said. "I focused on stay
ing aggressive and keeping the ball
in and not giving her any points."

Catlin was attempting to be
come the fourth woman to sweep
the singles and doubles titles at the
Rolex National Intercollegiates,
having taken the doubles title with
her partner Vanessa Castellano on
Saturday night.
Irvin was not the only Cardinal
stand-out at the event. Junior cap
tain and veteran star Teryn Ashley
also had an impressive showing.
After a rough fall season in
which she posted a 4-2 singles mark
and saw her national ranking plum
met to a dismal 77th, Ashley is
clearly playing solid tennis again.
More importantly, Ashley's once
questionable mental game seems to
be developing into one of her
strengths.
Over the weekend, after an easy
first-round win, Ashley found her
self in precarious situations against
her next two opponents, but man
aged to outwit them both.
In the second round. Ashley
overwhelmed Duke star and sec
ond seed Vanessa Webb 3-6,6-3,6-
3 and then struggled past Washing
ton's Kristina Kraszewski in the
quarterfinals, 2-6,7-5,6-0. Ashley's
ability to come back after dropping
the first set in both matches was a
testament of her will to win.
"I fought hard throughout and
came back," Ashley said.
"[Kraszewski] was hitting the ball
so hard and hitting winners every
where and I was down a break in
the second. But I think I played the
big points well."
An all-Cardinal final was not
meant to be, however, as Catlin up
ended Ashley in a thrilling semifi
nal, 2-6,6-3,7-5.
"I was up 5-4 and it was deuce
and I was two points away from the
match," Ashley said. "It \Vould've
been good to beat her, but it was
still a great weekend. I'm not going
to dwell on this loss."
Stanford's duo of Ashley/Irvin
reached the doubles semifinals, but
a vengeful Webb, teamed with
Karen Goldstein, scratched past
the Stanford women in a close
three-set tussle, 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4.
"I think we could've won this
tournament," Ashley said. "But
losing takes the pressure off of us
for the rest of the season."
After an exhausting but worth
while weekend, the Cardinal has a
busy week. The team returns to ac
tion today, taking on Fresno State
at 1:30 p.m. at the Taube Tennis
Center.


Irvin
Fresno State is led by Dora Djil
ianova, who is ranked 17th in the na
tion. Djilianova will carry a lot of
confidence into today's match, hav
ing posted impressive wins herself
in Dallas over the weekend. Djil
ianova upended California star and
Irvin-rival Anita Kurimav 5-7. 7-6
(10). 7-fr (4) in the second round be
fore falling to Lesernova in straight
sets in the quarterfinals.
Unfortunately, rain may wreak
havoc on this week's matches,
which will also feature a Thursday
meeting with Pacific and a Friday
encounter with University of San
Dieeo.
