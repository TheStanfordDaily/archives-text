The zone is a mythical place in sports in which
everything goes right. An athlete in the zone scores at
will and even if he slips, somehow, a positive outcome
will be managed. It is the day every athlete knows he is
better than anyone he is facing and he will not be de
nied victory.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the zone lasted the
whole weekend for Beau Weiner.

WRESTLING

■ Saturday: All-California Invitational —Stanford (4-5)
finished 3rd out of 8 schools.

Weiner. a senior captain wrestling at 157 lbs., was a
perfect 5-0 on the weekend and took home the title in
the California Invitational held at San Francisco State
on Saturday. Weiner also won his final home dual
meet with a 12-4 major decision over Fresno State ju
nior Tim Cornish on Friday.
"I felt really good this weekend," Weiner said. "I
did not coast in any of my matches and kept the pres
sure on. I just never let up.'
Weiner's weekend success came almost solely at
the expense of Cornish. After the dual meet win.
Weiner defeated Cornish in the finals on Saturday, 3-
2. This is the second time this season Weiner denied
Cornish in the finals, having beaten him 7-6 in the fi
nals of the Aggie Open on Jan. 16.
The road to the championship proved Weiner's
dominance. He posted two pins in 2 minutes, 45 sec

onds and 1:27 in the opening rounds and accepted a
forfeit from UC-Davis Ireshman Burt Pierson in the
semifinals to set up the match with Cornish.
"Beau is just on a roll right now," said Stanford
coach Chris Horpel. "He is just dominating people."
Team points scored by Weiner propelled Stanford
to a third-place finish with 74.5 points. The Cardinal
finished behind champion Fresno State (IKS.S) and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo (106.5) in a field of eight
California programs.
In all, Stanford had five place winners and three fi
nalists. with Weiner being the only champion. Junior
Warren McPherson (165) and junior Tim Kendall
(IS4) also reached the finals for the Cardinal.
McPherson stepped up a level after looking a little
sluggish the last couple of weeks because of lingering
sickness.
After an opening round win. lie upset the No. I seed
Steven Duran of Cal State-Fullerton in a close, 7-5 bat
tle. In the finals, he met sophomore Matt Demers of
Fresno State and came up short in 4-3 decision. De
mers slipped past McPherson in the Friday dual meet
by the identical score.
"We really have to start winning those close match
es," Horpel said. "Those could go either way on an
other day."
Kendall had three solid matches leading into the fi
nals. He scored a major decision on Friday against
Fresno State's Michael Mellor 10-0. and had a 3:57 pin
and technical fall in the opening rounds on Saturday.
In the finals, he faced Mark Pisoni of UC-Davis and
came up short 9-7.
"I am more aggressive lately
and just have more confidence
than I did earlier in the year, "
Kendall said.
Stanford junior Rudy Ruiz
(125) and senior Shane Cross (174)
also placed for the Cardinal. Ruiz
managed a third-place finish after
losing in a tough overtime match
against Darrick Hayes of Fresno
State in the opening round 7-5. He
was able to come back and face
Hayes again in the third place
match winning 6-4.
Cross posted a fourth-place fin
ish to cap off a disappointing week
end. After losing the opening
match to eventual champion David
Wells of Cal Poly, Cross fought
through the consolation rounds but
lost a heartbreaker to Dan Jackson

of Fresno State, 3-2.
"These close ones are just not
representing how good our guys re
ally are," Horpel said.
In preparation for the tourna
ment, the Cardinal faced Fresno
State on Friday and simply did not
wrestle as well as they could in the
25-14 defeat. Stanford looked a lit
tle fatigued and could not pull out
three tight matches that proved to
he the difference.
"1 just hate losing these meets
that I know we can win," Horpel
said.
The most devastating loss came
at 133 lbs., as junior captain Zach
Zimmerer dropped an overtime
decision to the Bulldogs' Paris
Ruiz K-6. The match ended Zim
merer's nine match winning streak
and aggravated a scratched cornea
he had suffered prior to the meet,
keeping him out of action on Satur
day.
