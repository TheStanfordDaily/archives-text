## 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
Senior Ryan Wolters and freshman k.J. Hippen
stecl represented the No. 1 Stanford tennis team this
past weekend in the National Collegiate Rolex Indoor
Championship in Dallas, Texas.
The tournament hosted the top players from all
eight regions of the country and consisted of a 32-man
singles draw as well as a 16-team doubles draw. Both
Wolters and Hippensteel were eliminated in the sec
ond round of the singles and the pair was also elimi
nated in the second round of the doubles bracket.
In Wolters' first singles match of the tournament,
lie defeated Aaron Marchetti of Virginia 7-6. 1-6. 7-5.
It was a hard fought match on the fast indoor surface
and Wolters was able to get his only break of the match
at 5-5 on the third.
"The courts were very fast which may have taken
away some of my return strength," Wolters said.
"When I got down a break in the second I was dis
couraged because I knew how hard it would be to
break back. But, I tried some new things on my return
and they finally paid of when it counted at the end of
the third set."
With the win. Wolters advanced to play Jeff Morri
son of Florida. Morrison immediately took advantage
of Wolters' slow start and stayed in control throughout
the entire match, winning 6-2, 6-1.
Wolters had played nine grueling sets the day be
fore until 10 p.m. and was forced to play Morrison at
a.m. the following morning. He did not use that as an
excuse, however.

"Although I was physically and mentally exhausted
from the day before, Morrison played a great match,"
Wolters said. "He had a big serve and I wasn't ever re
ally able to get into my rhythm. I give him full credit."
Despite also losing his second-round match. Hip
pensteel had a huge win in his opener. In this match he
defeated the No 2 player in the nation. Brian Vahaly of
Virginia, by a score of 6-4, 6-3. Hippensteel used his
aggressive style of play to put pressure on Vahaly.
"I had some confidence going in because I knew I
like playing indoors on fast surfaces," Hippensteel
said. "Vahaly is a backcourter, and 1 figured it I could
play aggressively and put a lot of pressure on him, 1
could win. Luckily I was able to do so."
That was perhaps Hippensteel's biggest win of the
season, but he was unable to use it for momentum in
his next match. In the second round, Hippensteel was
defeated by Ese Usentag of Rice. 6-4, 6-3. Losing the
big points in this match, which made the difference.
Hippensteel may also have been a bit tired and deject
ed from his doubles loss.
Hippensteel and Wolters played a very long open
ing doubles match against a team from Southern
Methodist, although both of them said it should not
have been so close. They were up a break in the first
set. but lost serve and eventually won 7-5. In the sec
ond set they were up double-break point at 4-3, but
lost that game and the next two to lose 6-4. They did
not return serve very well in the third set and were
forced to win it in a tiebreaker, 7-6.
"It ended up being longer and closer that it should
have," Wolters said.
In their second doubles match,
Hippensteel arid Wolters lost to
James Blake and kunji Majudarof
Harvard. 7-5. 6-7, 6-4. Stanford's
duo was broken only once in the
third set. but was not returning well
enough to gel it back.
"We got up a set and had six
break-point opportunities in the
second." Hippensteel said. "We
didn't convert and then when we
got down a break to open the third.
We never recovered."
Overall, though. Cardinal head
coach Dick (iould was pleased with
the weekend. He believes it is a

very long year and everything that
happens now is a learning experi
ence.
"It is a long season, and I think
bv the end of the year we will see
that Ryan |Wolters| is as tough to
beat day in and day out as anyone
in the nation," Gould said. "As far
as for K.J., he played two tough op
ponents with very distinctive styles
and handled them well. His first
win was very big and good for his
confidence. They both had mo
ments of brilliance in the doubles,
which is a good sign for our team in
doors in a couple of weeks."
The team will play at home this
weekend, pending on weather,
against Northwestern and Rice be
fore traveling to Seattle the follow
ing Wednesday.
