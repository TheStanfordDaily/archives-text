### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
As part of next year's new
freshman / sophomore college in Sterling
Quad, sophomores will have the option of
joining the "Sterling Scholars" program.
This program, focused on improving oral
presentation skills, will "culminate with a
spring quarter symposium of formal
talks," according to Material Sciences
Prof. John Bravman, dean (if the college.

The subject of the speeches will be stu
dents' descriptions of the
"intellectual/academic explorations that
led them to select a certain major," Brav
man said.
The program is still very much in the
planning stage, and "we're still putting
ideas together," said Assoc. Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education Ellen
Woods. However, "at this point I do not
anticipate that the speaking program will
be mandatory," said Bravman. He hopes.

though, that it will attract most, il not all. of
the sophomores.
Those students who do decide to partic
ipate will earn academic credit, most likely
in the form of independent study units.
The best talks will be awarded substantial
prizes, and the judging will be by both stu
dents and faculty.
Bravman will be the chief organizer of
this program but will receive help from a
staff that is part of the college. He will also
be involved with tutoring students in pub

lie speaking and related topics.
According to Bravman. this program
should be one of the features of the new
college that increases student-faculty in
teraction. helping sophomores who are de
ciding on a major.
Bravman anticipates using resources
such as the Center for Teaching and
Learning and the Technical Communica
tions program to enhance this program.
This new program in Sterling
Quad follows a growing national
trend among universities of "incor
porating more speaking require
ments and oral examinations into
their courses," according to the San
Jose Mercury News.
Last year, Smith College Presi
dent Ruth Simmons introduced
"Speaking Across the Curriculum,"
a program designed to increase the
number and quality of students' oral
presentations.
The plans for the program are not
final. In planning the new college,
"we'll he involving the students,
working with a student staff. It's a
creative challenge," Woods said.
