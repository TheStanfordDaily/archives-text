# Sociologist tackles distrust in democracies

### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Orlando Patterson, renowned historical sociologist
and professor of sociology at Harvard University, gave
the first of two Lectures in Problems in Democ
racy last night.
Patterson, whose speech was titled, "Cultivating
Distrust: The Development of Three Cultures of
Democracy in America," argued that the three main
expressions of democracy in America each involve the
creation of a different kind of trust.
The first, or the "minimalist" model of democracy,
focuses on the personal trust of individual leaders by
citizens. Former presidential candidate Bob Dole acted
on this model in his 1996 campaign, using the slogan,
"Who are you going to trust?" according to Patterson.
The second model, the "old contradistinctive"
model, holds that solidarity among the members of cer
tain groups is cultivated by targeting another group as a
common enemy.
Drawing on early American history for examples,
Patterson said that slavery served to unify whites, both
rich and poor, against blacks who were cast as "the
other."
Humans have use for two kinds of otherness, God
and strangers, Patterson said.
"One kind of distrust is created by a means of creat
ing trust," said Patterson, who is the author of "The Or
deal of Integration."
The third model Patterson discussed was the "Jack
sonian" system, which focuses on the expansion and in
tensification of trust in government as a body, instead
of individual leaders.
"The sharing of the state is not a 20th century inven
tion," he said.

democracy requires an under
standing of the differing align
ments and interactions of these
three democracies, or "cultures of
freedom," Patterson said.
Patterson framed the problems
facing American democracy in the
terms put forth by noted political
scientist Robert Putnam.
"I want to begin with
[Putnam's] claims about the 'crisis
of civic engagement'... and the
erosion of social capital," Patter
son said.
While Putnam examines the so
ciological changes leading to this
"crisis," such as the increasing
presence of women in the work

force, he neglects the behavior of
political actors in his analysis, Pat
terson noted.
"The sickness or health of a
democracy ... is not [just] a func
tion of social and economic vari
ables. It is a product of political
will," he said.
Democracy has always involved
some form of power-sharing, and
central to this is the concept of
"fraternal equality" and a common
political culture, Patterson said.
Also operating dynamically in
American democracy are the con
cepts of negative and positive free
dom, Patterson said. While the for
mer refers to the freedom from
state power, the latter refers to the
power to act according to one's
will, which may, paradoxically, in
clude the desire to coerce others.

Born in Jamaica, and educated
in the West Indies and at the Lon
don School of Economics, Patter
son was praised as a "resolutely in
dependent thinker."
In his introduction of Patterson
last night. Political Science Prof.
Robert Reich said that Patterson
"has been hailed as a true hero" by
the Stanford faculty for his work.
Patterson will deliver the sec
ond Wesson lecture "Trust and
Democratic Transition in Contem
porary America" tonight in Build
ing 420, room 40 at S. The final
event will be a seminar tomorrow
at 3:15 p.m. in Building 90, room
92Q.
The annual Wesson Lectures
are sponsored by the Program in
Ethics in Society and endowed by
the late Robert G. Wesson.
