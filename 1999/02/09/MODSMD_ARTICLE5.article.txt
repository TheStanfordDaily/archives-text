# Sociologist tackles distrust in democracies

Orlando Patterson, renowned historical sociologist
and professor of sociology at Harvard University, gave
the first of two Lectures in Problems in Democ
racy last night.
Patterson, whose speech was titled, "Cultivating
Distrust: The Development of Three Cultures of
Democracy in America," argued that the three main
expressions of democracy in America each involve the
creation of a different kind of trust.
The first, or the "minimalist" model of democracy,
focuses on the personal trust of individual leaders by
citizens. Former presidential candidate Bob Dole acted
on this model in his 1996 campaign, using the slogan,
"Who are you going to trust?" according to Patterson.
The second model, the "old contradistinctive"
model, holds that solidarity among the members of cer
tain groups is cultivated by targeting another group as a
common enemy.
Drawing on early American history for examples,
Patterson said that slavery served to unify whites, both
rich and poor, against blacks who were cast as "the
other."
Humans have use for two kinds of otherness, God
and strangers, Patterson said.
"One kind of distrust is created by a means of creat
ing trust," said Patterson, who is the author of "The Or
deal of Integration."
The third model Patterson discussed was the "Jack
sonian" system, which focuses on the expansion and in
tensification of trust in government as a body, instead
of individual leaders.
"The sharing of the state is not a 20th century inven
tion," he said.
