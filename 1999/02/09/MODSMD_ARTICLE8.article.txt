Mike Roberts, former director of Communi
cation Services at Stanford, now may have more
control over the Internet than Bill Gates.
As president of the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN),
Roberts is responsible for organizing the new
non-profit corporation, which will administrate
the registration of Internet domain names, like
.org and .edu.
The corporation, called for in a 1998 directive
by President Bill Clinton, is funded and support
ed by the Internet community, according to
Roberts.
Roberts, who graduated from Stanford with a
bachelor's in psychology and an MBA from the
Graduate School of Business, also spent 20 years
directing Communication Services, which in
volved running all computing, communications

and information systems at the University.
Roberts says he spent the final five years of his
job at Stanford organizing networks. "Working
for a university computing system is very good
preparation," he said.
Tom Rindfleisch, director of Lane Medical
Library and senior researcher in computer sci
ence and medicine, worked with Roberts on fed
eral networking communication.
"Mike was exposed at very early stages to the
use of networking and the impact of academic ac
tivities, because there was so much going on
here," Rindfleisch said, noting that Stanford was
one of the first five universities to use the Inter
net and the first to use the Ethernet.
In between Stanford and ICANN Roberts
consulted and was vice president at EDUCOM,
a collection of 6(X) universities and colleges inter
ested in networking, finally retiring in 1997.
However ICANN took him out of retirement.
"They badly needed someone to step in and start

it up," Roberts explained, noting that he has
found the position "very challenging."
Roberts is in charge of organizing a staff, an
office and a routine for the company. The com
pany has been operating since November, but he
said "it takes a while to get everything together,
depending on money, deadline pressures and the
staff." He anticipates opening an office in South
ern California soon and expects the company to
be working "with all cylinders" in May or June.
Rindfleisch said, "It's extremely important to
have the right people to guide the efforts to attain
openness, inter-operability and fairness of infor
mation access. To have people like Mike Roberts
who have, at their core, these principles is ab
solutely essential."
"There are lots of people who contribute to
the effort," Rindfleisch said, mentioning Vinton
Serf, the Stanford alumnus who is generally re
garded as the father of the Internet. "Mike is a
person of that ilk."
