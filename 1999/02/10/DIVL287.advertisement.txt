Dear Colleagues,
The search committee for a new Provost has been formed and plans to
work expeditiously. As a first and important step in the search process, we
seek the counsel of Stanford faculty, staff and students.
Which tenured member or members of the Stanford faculty do you
propose for consideration as the next Provost? What reasons do you list for
suggesting the consideration of this person? Special thought needs to be
given to potential candidates who are women or members of ethnic minority
groups.
Please send your written responses, before February 24, via email to
provost-search@stanford.edu. If you prefer, you may fax your nomination to
725-7340, or send mail to Building 310, Mail Code 2060. All communications
will be kept strictly confidential.
Thank you for your help and for sending your response within the next
two weeks.
Building 10, Main Quadrangle • Stanford, California 9430-2060 • Fax (650) 725-6847
