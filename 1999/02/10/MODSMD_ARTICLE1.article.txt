## CIV to I-Hum change reviewed 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Editor's note: Today The Daily be
gins a two-part series examining reac
tion to the changes in the Area One re
quirement. Here, we look at the at
tempts to reduce reading loads and in
crease author diversity in I-Hum. To
morrow, we report on team teaching,
integration of lectures and sections
and the future of I-Hum.
As it completes its transition from
Cultures, Ideas and Values to Intro
duction to the Humanities, program
administrators are praising the re
vamped Area One requirement.
However, not all students have greet
ed many of I-Hum's key goals and
changes with such enthusiasm.
By next year, the three-quarter
CIV tracks will be entirely phased
out of Area One, with Structured
Liberal Education the only full year
program remaining. All other fresh
men will take a fall I-Hum course, fol
lowed by a winter / spring I-Hum se
quence.
The I-Hum program was created
in response to student demands for
reduced reading loads to increase the
time spent on each text in theory, as
well as student complaints about a
lack of diversity in the authors cov
ered by CIV. Also, the I-Hum pro
gram has established a unique, team
teaching approach.
This year, the second year of the
transition from CIV to I-Hum, only
two CIV tracks are being taught: Eu
ropean history and anthropology.
Meanwhile, about 1,1 (X) freshmen
are in the I-Hum program, while the
remaining freshmen are in SLE.
According to Area One program
director Harry Elam, the students in
I-Hum this year have responded pos
itively to the program for several rea
sons.
"What really seems to be working
is the reduction of the texts," Elam
said. "Many are saying that a depth of
reading has been taking place... CIV

had much more for them to read.
Now, there's not as much breadth,
but there is a depth in what is being
covered."
Freshman Tim Cao, who is taking
the Anthropology CIV course this
year, said that the amount of reading
assigned in CIV is impractical.
"While it is manageable, it's unneces
sary because we hardly get a chance
to cover anything in section. It's a fu
tile effort to try to read everything,"
he said.
Elam said that the Area One gov
ernance committee reviews the syl
labus for each I-Hum course, and
that legislation requires that each fall
I-Hum course contain three to five
works.
However, according to Area One
associate director Cheri Ross, some
freshmen have complained that the
pace of reading in their
winter / spring I-Hum courses has in
creased greatly.
"Students are wishing that they
could continue to do some of the crit
ical analysis and careful reading that
they did in the fall," Ross said.
Winter / spring courses are not re
quired to adhere to the limit imposed
on the fall courses. However, Ross
said, "we can tell people who are
teaching those courses that it has
been a positive aspect from the fall."
Freshman Asha Bhandary, who is
taking the winter / spring sequence
"Living Through the Changes," said
the reading load this quarter has been
manageable. "I think it was good that
they had less reading fall quarter to
ease you in, but I don't think it's that
unreasonable this quarter. It's defi
nitely do-able."
The I-Hum program also has
aimed to increase the diversity of the
authors whose texts are read in each
course in an attempt to address a
common complaint that CIV texts
overwhelmingly provided a white.
Western European viewpoint.
Elam said that I-Hum still needs to
make additional progress in this area.
"The legislation says at least one
author must be outside the Western
canon, hut it was left ambiguous to

have reading that brought in not only
American writers of color, but also to
bring in writers from Africa and
Asia," he said.
"I want to see that happen more,
hopefully to get more courses that
deal with issues outside the West...
that is a goal that we can do better
on."
