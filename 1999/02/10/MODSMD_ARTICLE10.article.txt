Holbrooke named UN ambassador
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton moved
ahead with plans to nominate Richard Holbrooke to
be ambassador to the United Nations after Hol
brooke agreed yesterday to pay $S,(MK) to settle civil
charges that he violated federal ethics laws.
The veteran 57-year-old diplomat denied in the
settlement the Justice Department's allegations that
he improperly contacted a I J.S. diplomat on behalf of
his employer. Instead. Holbrooke said he was acting
as a special government employee asked to explain
U.S. policy to Asian officials.
The Justice Department said Holbrooke did not
willfully violate the law barring former government
officials from contacting ex-colleagues about busi
ness for one year after leaving government. The
department also said the contact produced no direct
financial gain for Holbrooke or his employer, the
investment banking firm of Credit Suisse First
Boston.
"From building lasting peace in Bosnia to search
ing for a political settlement in Kosovo, to finding a
workable solution in Cyprus, Richard C. Hol
brooke's intellect, vigor and diplomatic skills have
significantly advanced the values and the interests of
the American people," Clinton said.

Hubble shows forming of planets
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” New pictures from
the Hubble Space Telescope are giving
astronomers a look at what may be the early for
mative stages of planets, NASA said yesterday.
While the pictures don't actually show planets,
they give a look at disks of dust that circle young
stars.
Scientists believe that as stars age, this dust con
denses to form planets.
Thus, the Hubble images may be offering a
glimpse of what our solar system looked like 4.5 bil
lion years ago when the Earth and other planets
began to condense, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration reported.
"While the existence of these disks has been
known from prior infrared and radio observations,
the Hubble images reveal important new details
such as a disk's size, shape, thickness and orienta
tion," said Deborah Padgett of the California Insti
tute of Technology's Infrared Processing and Anal
ysis Center in Pasadena, Calif.
Her group used Hubble cameras to look at six
young stars 450 light years away in the constellation
Taurus.
