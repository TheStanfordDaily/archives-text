# Censure growing unlikely
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Several
Republicans expressed a willingness
yesterday to let President Clinton
walk away from his impeachment
ordeal with an acquittal, leaving
judgment of his conduct to history
rather than any Senate-approved
rebuke.
The notion of censuring Clinton -
— either immediately following his
trial or later — has strong Republi
can opposition but remains on life
support with the backing of most
Democrats and a handful of GOP
senators.
But to have a such a measure
considered in the l(X)-meniber Sen
ate. supporters would need (SO votes
to hurdle an expected stalling action
by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas, the leading opponent of a
censure resolution.
Meetings on a censure resolution
are expected to become intense
immediately after the Senate ren
ders a verdict on the impeachment
charges of perjury and obstruction of

justice. With 67 votes needed for
conviction and removal of the presi
dent, both parties agree that acquit
tal is virtually certain.
Democratic Sen. Dianne Fein
stein of California, has been drafting
and redrafting censure language
with the help of Republican Sen.
Robert Bennett of Utah.
Gramm has threatened to offer
innumerable amendments to any
such resolution, an approach that
could amount to a filibuster, requir
ing 60 votes to overcome.
Censure to Gramm is a "covering
your fanny approach" — letting
those who want to acquit Clinton on
impeachment still express disap
proval of his behavior.
Gramm has said it's not allowed
by the Constitution and would set a
dangerous precedent for the future
concerning the separation of powers.
Sen. Jon Kyi, R-Ariz., said he
could support a censure resolution
only "if the language would refer" to
the perjury and obstruction language

in the articles of impeachment.
That's not likely, since
Democrats have expressed strong
opposition to a declaration that Clin
ton committed impeachable offens
es — especially after the Senate fails
to reach the two-thirds majority to
convict the president and remove
him from office.
A censure resolution would only
need a simple majority.
Although the large procedural
hurdles facing a censure resolution
dim prospects for consideration
immediately after the impeachment
verdict. Democratic leader Tom
Daschle of South Dakota has set in
motion a possible procedural vote
that could allow Democrats to
express themselves.
He also has talked of trying to
attach censure language to legislation
after senators return from next
week's week-long recess.
A censure of President Andrew
Jackson in the 1860s was overturned
by a subsequent Congress.
