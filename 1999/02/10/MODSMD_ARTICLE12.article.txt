Community should
participate in the
provost selection process

IN TODAY S DAILY you will find
an advertisement from University
President Gerhard Casper asking
Stanford students and faculty input
on who should be their next provost.
Ihis is the community's best and
only opportunity to participate in the
selection process, and we encourage
everyone to get involved.
The provost is the University's chief
academic and budget officer, the per
son responsible for the "nitty-gritty,"
so to speak, at the University.
He or she is responsible for admin
istering the academic program and all
University services.
Such a person must be multi-talent
ed. Before anyone starts suggesting
names, we think that it is important to
consider what traits would make a
good provost. We offer the following
qualities as a starting point to promote
further thought and discussion.
Experience
The candidate must be a dedicated
and committed leader within the Uni
versity â€” someone who has been
involved with University administra
tion and committee work.
Because Stanford prides itself on
being a center of academic research
and teaching, a provost should be a
reputable scholar within his or her
field.
It is important that this person be
familiar with the issues surrounding
academia and be a respected partici
pant in it.
Student interaction
At the same time, we strongly
encourage the community to recog
nize the need for a candidate that has

a record of consistently relating well
with students. After all, students are
the primary responsibility of the
provost and the University as a whole.
It is therefore essential that any
candidate considered have experience
with teaching undergraduates.
'ITiis is yet another tie between the
candidate and the academic environ
ment here at Stanford. It is also a way
for the candidate to have interacted
closely with students.
An emphasis on undergraduate
education, one would argue, is one of
the tenants of any strong institution
like Stanford.
Vision
Moreover, the next provost should
also be a visionary.
ITiis person, in conjunction with the
President, will be directly responsible
for determining the path that the Uni
versity will take.
He or she must have a clear idea of
where Stanford should head.
'Hie next provost should help Stan
ford continue its tradition of leading
the way into the future and beyond.
Other considerations
Casper also said in his advertise
ment that "Special thought needs to
be given to potential candidates who
are women or members of ethnic
minority groups."
We applaud his decision to include
these issues in the selection process. It
is especially of concern because the
current provost is the only female and
minority in the President's cabinet.
However, we also feel that the
search committee should be cautious
not to exclude any otherwise well
qualified candidates based on efforts
to have diversity within the President's
cabinet.
Given all of the aforementioned
considerations, we urge students and
faculty to make their voices heard..
