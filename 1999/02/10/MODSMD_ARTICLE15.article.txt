## A 						new take on Valentine's Day 
### 
IWILL NO T be celebrating Valentine's
Day in my usual way this year — out
wardly proclaiming it as the most ridicu
lous holiday in the world and inwardly pre
tending that I am not expecting my knight in
shining armor to show up with a dozen
roses.
Every year it was the same. Silent, ado
lescent thoughts of secret admirers
repressed by a cynical mind. The most
romantic of thoughts — the ones that we
Stanford students pretend that we do not
have. Once I went so far as to think that a
serenade was happening just below my win
dow as I woke up in the morning.
Every year — the wait, the anticipation. I
never know what makes me believe that one
year will be any different from the last. I cal
culate the chances of the perfect guy show
ing up on my doorstep. And. every year
there is not one guy I am even remotely
involved with. Of course, 1 pretend not to
care as half the day passes and no one has
brought me my dozen roses yet.
When the day is over. I convince myself
that my roses got lost in transit, and they will
be here tomorrow. But tomorrow leads to
another tomorrow, until 1 wait once again
for hope to reveal itself in the form of a
materialistic, ridiculous holiday.
Of course, each year 1 convince everyone
around me that the holiday means nothing
to me. that I hope they abolish it because I
feel so sorry for all those hopeless romantics
who are keeping their lingers crossed. And
then I mention how sad it must be for them
to feel pathetic, unlike people like me who

can easily look past the holiday.
But now I look back on each Valentine's
Day with a smile. Valentine's Day has
always brought me a secret hope. Not roses,
but the hope for roses. Not love, but the
promise of love, of one day finding it and
never taking it for granted.
This is what our romantic dreams are
made of; this is from where they stem — the
seedlings of hope that we create when we
wonder il reality will ever match imagina
tion.
And when it does, when we fall hopeless
ly and helplessly, we never fall short of these
imaginative expectations. So while I will
never be able to ask myself whether that first
kiss will be as magical as I hope. I know now
that all those seemingly futile desires exist
for a purpose.
Last year, after being swept up in the tra
dition we call spring quarter, I was sure my
exhilarated feelings must have meant love.
But walking on air turned to longing in the
three months of summer we spent on sepa
rate continents, and 1 started wondering
whether my feelings would ever be ground
ed in reality. When I came back to Stanford.
I crossed my lingers and hoped that we
would still see stars.
And I am still keeping them crossed. Per
haps once upon a time I thought that being
in a relationship would make me knowl
edgeable about love. But now I learn each
day that I am ignorant, that my shallow view
of love is challenged bv a deeper sense of
understanding.
Our perspective of love is always chang

ing but our needs stay the same. To be
understood, to be needed, to be touched.
Once I thought I was ridiculous for believing
in love song lyrics and romantic movies.
Now I know that love can mean all of that,
but it can also mean much more. Love can
mean support. It can mean jealousy. Love
can mean holding on, talking it through. It
can mean telling the truth.
It means waking up with the knowledge
that you do not have to face the world alone;
it means going to sleep some nights lonely
and afraid that things will not work out.
Perhaps Valentine's Day will mean
something different to me in 10 years. Right
now it means realizing that I know nothing
about love except that I need it. It means
cherishing the wait, the anticipation, even
the past disappointment that makes love
rare.
Perhaps I am being too overly dramatic
for the stringent minds of Stanford. Love?
We shun the idea, the concept, the principle
for more important aspects of intelligent
thought. Even as I write this column I am
embarrassed for writing about a topic as
banal as Valentine's Day, a day ignored by
seemingly everyone at Stanford.
But we, I have found, are the best pre
tenders. We hide our romantic hopes in the
excuses of "too busy" and "how pointless."
Inside, we too have hopes. Beautiful ones.
