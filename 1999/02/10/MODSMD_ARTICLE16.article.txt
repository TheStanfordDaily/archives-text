Sixth Man's conduct was inappropriate

As a member of the Stanford communi
ty, 1 wish to express my deep regret for the
inappropriate conduct of the members of
the Sixth Man Club at the men's basketball
game Saturday against Connecticut,
If I felt it was an incident uncharacteris
tic of a general attitude here at Stanford. I
would not bother to make note of it. But. I
feel this shameful episode hints at a deeper
issue.
What kind of name does this University
have to outsiders? In many circles, Stan
ford represents a great institution dedicat
ed to teaching and research. A look back at
our past reveals that Stanford was estab
lished by our founders out of an apprecia
tion for higher learning and expanding the
human mind. We are known for pushing
our intellectual limits and striving to
achieve our potential. In doing so, we set

an example which stirs in others a desire to
follow suit.
Nelson Mandela, a man of great quiet
strength and known for his understated yet
powerful influence, once wrote, "As we let
our own light shine, we unconsciously give
other people permission to do the same." I
would ask, what is the light that we shine
and what is the permission we unconscious
ly give others when our respected university
is characterized by such deplorable conduct
as displayed by the members of the Sixth
Man Club at the game?
Stanford is coming to make quite a name
for itself for skirting the limits and testing
the boundaries of decency.
It shames me that our university is por
trayed to others on national television in a
manner which is so uncharacteristic of the
moral principles of dignity and respect for

others upon which we as a university were
founded. I would hope that we could raise
ourselves from this level and shine a light
which enlightens others, not dulls their
senses.

I don't think its very humorous to make
fun of the misfortune of others. But that is
exactly what the Sixth Man Club did to
Khalid El-Amin during Saturday's men's
basketball game against Connecticut.
Personal details concerning members of
the opposing team are no one's business. 1
think that taunting someone because he is a
young father is mean spirited. Attention
must be paid, not only in the Sixth Man

Club, hut also in the community.
I have been going to Stanford basketball
games since 1 was in third grade. I admired
Todd Lichti, Deshonne Wingate and Kenny
Hicks because of their athletic abilities but
more for their sportsmanship. Back then
the team was not as good, but fans and play
ers alike had fun because there was a warm,
sportsmanlike atmosphere.
Now we are a better team, but we seem
to have grown big heads, so to speak. The
idea of a home court advantage is not an
open invitation to fire personal insults at the
other team. Let us not forget what Stanford
and we, as human beings, are all about.
Congratulations to Khalid El-Amin for
scoring 23 points despite what happened.
