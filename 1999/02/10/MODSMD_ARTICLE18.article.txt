# Keep your computer in your pocket

### Jen Godwin Contributing writer 
You will be assimilated. Resis
tance is futile. We are plugged into
the system by email, pagers, key
boards, phones, faxes, ad infinitum.
It was clearly only a matter of
time before we started strapping on
our computers so that we would
never have to be separated from our
connection.
Enter Computer Science Prof.
Vaughn Pratt, leader of the new
Wearables Project.
The Wearables Project is devel
oping computer technology that can
be directly incorporated into cloth
ing. Pratt, along with doctoral stu
dent Gregory DeFouw, took a long
first step early this year when they
created a pocket-sized Web server.
The device is less than 2 inches
high, 3 inches wide and 1/4 inch
thick. It is about one-tenth the vol
ume of a Palm Pilot.
"It's basically a powerful little
computer," Pratt said. "We could
have set it up for any number of dif
ferent uses. But because most peo
ple think of servers as mysterious
boxes, located in dark basements
and cranking out stuff for everyone
to see, I thought making it into a
Web server was particularly dra
matic."

In addition, the server can be
controlled through a Web connec
tion without need of a keyboard or
monitor. The Web site run on the
server, http://wearables.Stanford,
edu, has had more than 9(),(MX) hits
since its establishment Jan. 22.
Pratt said, "We hope to have the
next version done in a few days, and
we will have the ability to plug in a
graphic terminal [monitor], ether
net, a mouse, serial board, floppy
drive and so on."
He explains that the general goal
of the Wearables group is to "re
search pocket machines to run the
same software that runs on your
desktop."
Right now, he says, scaled-down
"palmtop" computers are available.
However, these machines are not
capable of running standard soft
ware, so there is a tremendous ex
pense in rewriting the software to
work.
The main obstacle to wearable
computers with present technology
is the lack of a suitable input device.
The Wearables team is working on a
digital sign language, Thumbcode,
which they have developed to re
place the keyboard. The sign lan
guage is read by a special glove. In
addition, future versions of the tiny
computers should be able to run
voice recognition software.

Pratt said that the underlying ra
tionale behind creating wearable in
tegrated computers is that, "if you
have to reach for a keyboard and
peer over at a monitor, then it inter
feres with the other things you are
trying to.
"We're trying to create machines
that do not interfere with our nor
mal non-computer routines."
While humans will not be
"bristling" with computers in the
near future, they may move closer
to integrating the real and virtual.

Interactions between the real world
and the virtual world may no longer
be limited by physical impediments
like skin, eyes, fingers and beige
plastic.
"The only difference is that you
won't be visibly borg-like. There
won't be a sense of borgness having
to be sort of all bristling with gad
gets. It's more subtle borg. Hopeful
ly, there will by ways to be less in
trusive, have people go about their
normal business, and not raise eye
brows."
