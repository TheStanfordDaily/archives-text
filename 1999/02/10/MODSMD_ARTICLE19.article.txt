## Newly revived Science Bug analyzes Klingons, birds, bees 
### Garth Patil Contributing writer 
After a long hiatus from the
pages of the science section, I've
finally returned to put the endlessly
confused, fuzzy minds at Stanford at
ease.
I'd like to say I took a break for a
long pleasure cruise in the South
Pacific, or even just got hung up for
a couple of months feasting on a few
pieces of saliva covered dog food
that happened to slip underneath
the refrigerator to a place bugs refer
to as "Xanadu." But, alas, Bug just
hit a creative block and was unable
to produce the kind of quality mate
rial he could back during the days of
Bug Chris Patil (shameless sibling
plug)-
Over the course of the past vol
ume I developed a sinking feeling in
the pit of my tiny exoskeleton, and
realized that there was a void in the
Science page that needed to be
filled.
Where was the section's interac
tion with the world? How would the
wanting student masses get answers
to pressing questions like, "Why do
farts smell?" and "Why do I get a
fever when I'm sick?" And for

goodness sake, where's the
humor?!!! I decided that evasive
action was necessary, and thus. Bug
Has returned.
So you're probably thinking:
"I've got all of these questions for
Science Bug. but how am 1 ever
going to get him to answer one in
the weekly Science page?" Never
fear, silly human. The rest of today's
column contains a few sample ques
tions that will give you an idea of the
kinds of questions that are appropri
ate or inappropriate for Bug.
Q: What in the world were my par
ents talking about when they sat me
down for the 'birds and the bees'
discussion?
A: Although the practice of human
reproduction would probably be a
fascinating subject to dedicate a
week of research to, the answer that
you're looking for would probably
be better given by Roxy Sass (see
Intermission, back page).
Q: What is that thing on a Klingon's
forehead?
A: Unfortunately the Science Fic
tion Bug is on extended sabbatical.
Last I heard, he was caught in a tem
poral wake behind a Borg ship trav

eling through time. You believe me,
right? Resistance is futile.
0:1 took a long exposure picture in
the Quad, but the image came out
underexposed. I metered the light
ing situation and set the camera, but
it still came out dark. What am I
doing wrong?
A: Lucky for you, I also double as
Photography Bug. Reciprocity fail
ure in film during long exposures is
the problem you face. This is the
kind of question we Bugs like: a real
world problem with an elegant sci
entific explanation.
Q: From a Bug's perspective, which
movie was better, A Bug's Life or
Ant/?
A: Again, even though I may have
an opinion, this question would
probably be better fielded by the
folks over in Intermission.
Q: Why is digital audio better?
A: Ahlih. A deconstruction of ana
log and digital recording technology
would be a worthy topic for Bug.
Silly analog fool. You will be
crushed by the advancement of
technology.
Q: Left?
A: Right.
Q: So you're a Bug, right? Why on
earth would I want to ask my impor
tant questions to someone smaller
than my little finger when I have the
brilliant professors of Stanford Uni
versity at my disposal?
A: Allow me let you in on a little
secret: Bugs have been around for 95
million years. You've been around
for one. Do the math. Einstein.
