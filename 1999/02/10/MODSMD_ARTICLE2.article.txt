# Tuition to rise by 3.5 percent
## 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
For the second year in a row, tuition, room and
board will increase by 3.5 percent next year, the
Board of Trustees announced yesterday. In con
junction, the board voted to earmark an additional
$500,000 for financial aid beyond last year's total.
Stanford's costs are "significantly behind our
major competition for students — Harvard. Yale
and Princeton," said Robert Bass, chair of the
board.
The total University bill for the academic year

1 999-20(X) will be $30,939, up from $29,879. Room
and board charges will increase by only 1.4 percent,
from $7,769 to $7,781, while tuition will rise 4.3 per
cent, from $22.110 to $23,058.
"The administration has done a fantastic job
keeping administrative overhead contained," said
Bass, "especially in a local economy with a lot of
cost pressures."
The 3.5 percent increases this year and last year
represent the smallest increases in a decade. Bass
explained that two-thirds of Stanford's annual
funding comes restricted to specific types of spend
ing, while tuition money is more flexible.

According to Bass, the Board of Trustees is con
sidering a fundraising effort to endow the costs of
new programs such as the recently announced
freshman / sophomore college in Sterling Quad.
University officials were enthusiastic about the
increase in financial aid funding. James Montoya,
vice provost for student affairs, explained that "we
want to make certain that exceptionally talented
students of all socio-economic backgrounds con
tinue to see Stanford as a viable option."
" The additional funds will help us better meet
the needs of low-income students, and give us
added flexibility in those cases where the financial
aid formula doesn't fully reflect the family's ability
to contribute to the cost of higher education," he
added.
Cynthia Rife, director of student awards in the
Financial Aids Office, said that the funds would
also help the office "alleviate the stress and strain
[on families] of borrowing too much."
Bass also said that funds will be put toward the
Presidential Scholars program.
The new increase in financial aid funding fol
lows an increase of $3.8 million last year, which al
lowed sweeping revisions in financial aid policy.
The board also announced a continuation of the
current 5.25 percent rate of withdrawal from the
University endowment, to fund capital improve
ments.
They also discussed the recent disclosure of a
complaint filed with the Labor Department alleg
ing gender discrimination in hiring and promotion.
Bass was unhappy with Labor Department
lawyers' comments directed at Stanford specifical
ly, as there is no official investigation based on the
complaint at this point.
On Monday night, trustees ate dinner at student
residences to discuss issues facing the University.
