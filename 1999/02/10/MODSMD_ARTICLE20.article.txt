# How the universe was created: Is the Big Bang theory wrong?
## Research presents new beginning to universe 
### Matt Bell Contributing writer 
The Big Bang theory, which
claims the universe began 15 bil
lion years ago when a single point
of unimaginable heat and density
spontaneously exploded, is a sci
entific tale so well-known in pop
ular culture that most people
accept it as a fact.
However, while the Big Bang
theory explains many mechanisms
of the universe, it leaves plenty of
questions unanswered.
What caused the Big Bang?
Why is the universe flat rather
than curved, as predicted by the
theory of relativity? Why is matter
clumped into galaxies but more
uniform at larger scales? How did
the laws of the universe come into
being?
Physics Prof. Andrei Linde has
come up with a very different
explanation for the universe's ori
gin. In his theory, titled "The Self-
Reproducing Inflationary Uni
verse," the universe is constantly
spawning new universes.
"If my colleagues and I are
right, we may soon be saying
goodbye to the idea that our uni
verse was a single fireball created
in the Big Bang," Linde noted.
According to his theory, no
particles exist during the early
stages of each universe's life.
Instead, there is only some
thing Linde calls an inflaton field,
a region of space charged with
energy.
This energy drives the expan
sion of space itself, decreasing
very gradually as the universe
grows. Consequently, space will

inflate exponentially, reaching an
unimaginable size many orders of
magnitude larger than the visible
universe in a tiny fraction of a sec
ond.
Once the energy of the inflaton
field drops below a certain level,
space ceases to expand, and the
remaining energy forms the basic
particles that make up the uni
verse today.
Since we can see only a tiny
fraction of the universe, it appears
flat even though, as a whole, it is
curved according to Einstein's
theory.
However, the situation is a lit
tle more complicated. There are
several different types of inflaton
fields and multiple ways for the
fields to settle into equilibrium.
Thus, while our area of the uni
verse may have one set of univer
sal constants, physical laws and
particles, another area may have a
completely different structure.
These differences, as well as
the uneven distribution of matter
in the universe, are caused by
something called quantum fluctu
ations, which are tiny perturba
tions in the energy of space.
Quantum fluctuations cause
particles to constantly pop in and
out of existence everywhere, even
in a perfect vacuum.
During inflation, these fluctua
tions create microscopic differ
ences in the field's energy level,
which become the size of galaxies
as the universe expands.
When the universe stops grow
ing. the galaxy-sized areas with
more energy end up with more
particles.
This explains why matter even

tually clumps together into galax
ies.
Finally, in extremely rare cases,
the quantum fluctuations will be
sufficient to drive the energy of
the inflaton field high enough that
inflation will begin to occur again,
creating a new universe.
This inflation will essentially be
the Big Bang for the new universe.
Although our region of the uni
verse is currently too low in ener
gy to give birth to another uni
verse, other regions at higher
energy levels might be able to do
so.
'if life in our part of the uni
verse were to disappear, then it
will appear again someplace else.
So the universe as a whole
becomes immortal," Linde said in
a previous interview.
Linde has run several comput
er simulations exploring this
reproduction process.
The universe starts with a near
ly homogeneous field, but some
areas begin to inflate and give
birth to other universes, which in
turn give birth to even more uni
verses.
Despite the success of the com
puter model and the ability of his
theory to elucidate many things
left unexplained by the "Big
Bang" theory, Linde has encoun
tered resistance from other physi
cists.
Linde said. "The theory is very
simple, but we have a lot of psy
chological barriers to overcome."
Like all theories, Linde's: Self-
Reproducing Inflationary Uni
verse will have to answer to the
continuing stream of data coming
from astronomers and physicists.
