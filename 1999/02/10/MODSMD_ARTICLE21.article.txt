# The
						thrills and chills of those Valentine's Day kisses
## Unwary college students fall prey to mononucleosis, the kissing disease 
### Joanne Wu Editorial staff 
With Valentine's Day just around the corner, dreams
of romance and kisses often consume the mind with pleas
ant thoughts. Unfortunately, a harrowing illness may be
lurking just a few embraces away.

Infectious mononucleosis, also known infa
mously as the "kissing disease" or mono, is a com

mon infection among young adults. It is especially

prevalent among college students, due to inadequate rest
and crowded living conditions. Cowell Student Health
Service sees about I(K) cases of mono every year.

Mono is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, which
infects B cells, one type of white blood cell in the
body's immune system. The virus transforms the B
cell into a malignant form, which then elicits an
immune response where the body attempts to
destroy the infected B cells.
The virus is spread through saliva and nasal
secretions. Only about a third of adults who
L.

contract the virus actually become sick. Many
adults and children are carriers of the virus

who can transmit the illness, but do not
exhibit symptoms themselves.
Contact with carriers or recovered

individuals who might still harbor the

virus can expose people unwittingly to
mono. Typically, the virus remains present
| in saliva for 30 to 45 days, but in some peo-
pie it can be detected in saliva for up to 18

months. Long afterwards, the virus can
still be dormant in the immune system.
Although it is not highly contagious.

sharing things like silverware, drinks or,
of course, a kiss, can transfer the virus.
Practicing good hygiene can lower the
chances of catching the disease.

In fact, few romantic couples actual
ly share the illness at the same time since

many factors enter into vulnerability to the

virus. Stress and previous illness that may have weakened

the immune system can make a person more susceptible to catching
the disease.
The virus affects the respiratory system, liver and lymphatic system.

Early symptoms of the illness include exhaustion, headaches, sore throats
and appetite loss. However, even these initial symptoms do not begin to
appear until four to six weeks after exposure to the virus, and a person is most

contagious before symptoms actually appear.
The first stages of mono can be easily mistaken for the flu, a bad cold or strep-

tococcal throat. The early symptoms can be followed
three to five days later by more acute problems such

as muscle aches, fatigue, skin rash and fever.
Lymph nodes, particularly the ones under
the neck and armpits, also swell as they pro

duce white blood cells to battle the virus. The
spleen and liver, acting as filters for the circu
latory system, can also become enlarged and
vulnerable.

Although most cases of mono last for a
short period, requiring only two weeks of bed
rest, energy levels may not return to nor

mal for a long time. In some cases,
lasting effects of the illness may cause
fatigue lasting up to six months.
Rest should be taken as regularly
as needed, and strenuous exercise and
contact sports should be avoided for at

least one month in order to prevent the enlarged
spleen from rupturing. The swollen spleen may
drop below the protection of the ribs, where it is

then in danger of being burst by a physical blow.
No cure currently exists for the virus, but

adequate rest, pain relievers and small fre
quent meals with plenty of liquids can

help fight the infection.
Alcohol consumption should also
be avoided to prevent stressing the liver.
Inflammation of the liver can cause jaun
dice, which can require hospitalization.
Some medication can be helpful for
easing the symptoms of mono. Pred
nisone, an anti-inflammatory pill that
shrinks the tonsils, making it easier to

breathe comfortably. Ibuprofen is a pain
killer that can ease headache and fever
symptoms. Gargling warm salt water or tea
can relieve sore throats.
In most cases, people who have been

infected with the Epstein-Barr virus are
immune from getting mononucleosis again.
Occasionally though, relapses do occur.

The mono virus is a member of the herpes virus family, which also cause
chicken pox, shingles, cold sores and genital herpes.
At the Stanford Medical Center studies are being conducted to examine the
mechanisms of the disease. In some areas of the world, mono has been known
to lead to severe diseases like cancer. In Africa, the Epstein-Barr virus has been
linked with Burkitt's lymphoma, and in China, the virus is associated with can
cers of the nose and throat. According to researchers, environmental, rather
than genetic, conditions determine these connections.
