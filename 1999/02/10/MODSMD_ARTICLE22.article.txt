One athlete in New York and the rest in Reno last
weekend, three in Los Angeles, two in Reno and three in
Tacoma this weekend.
It's not that Stanford head track and field coach Vin
Lananna doesn't believe in strength in numbers. He is
well aware that to win the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Championships just nine days from now, nearly
all of his athletes will have to be in top form. Hut until
then, team unity will be more spiritual then physical.
This past weekend the team was coming off a high
after sophomore Julia Stamps, redshirt sophomore
Courtney Adams and the distance medley team all quali
fied for indoor nationals.
Sophomore Melissa Feinstein, who had earlier quali
fied for nationals in the pole-vault, looked to reach even
greater heights at the prestigious Millrose Games at
Madison Square (Jarden in New York. Though she didn't
have her best performance of the season, jumping 12 feet,
1/2 inch, she did get the experience of watching Melissa
Mueller, a professional athlete, break the American
record with a vault of 14-8 3/4.
The rest of Stanford's competitors had to forego the
bright lights and big city of New York for simply bright
lights in Reno, Nev., at the Bill Cosby Invitational. The
standout events for the Cardinal were the throws with ju
nior Cassie Romuld taking the shot put and junior Mau
reen ()nyeagbako winning the women's 20-pound weight
throw with a Stanford record of 54-3 1/4.
Senior Trayce Lawyer, the No. 5 finisher in the high
jump at last year's indoors, saw her first action ol the year
with a fifth-place finish in the high jump with a mark of 5-
5 3/4. Lananna was pleased with her first performance
since recovering from injuries from soccer season.
'it was a great opener for Trayce," said Lananna.
"She'll compete in the next two weeks to try to qualify for
the NCAA meet."
This weekend. Lawyer will likely join Stamps and ju
nior Sally Glynn at the Los Angeles Invitational, one of
three meets on tap for the Cardinal.
Glynn, who was on the distance medley team that
qualified for nationals, will get a chance to qualify indi
vidually this weekend while dueling with Stamps in the
mile. She'll have her work cut out for her as Stamps is
coming off the best performances of this short season in
the 3,(XX) meters, the same race in which Glynn just
missed qualifying for nationals.
"Sallv has had a calf problem coming off of the winter
break and when she came back she kind ol just got start
ed again." said Lananna. "She'll have an opportunity to
get a good mile in this weekend, which is really where we
want her to qualify anyway."
Elsewhere on the West Coast, senior long jumper
Para Oettinger will join Feinstein at the Holiday Inn In
vite in Reno. Oettinger. who started out the season red
hot. will look to improve on her season best of 19-8 with
the hopes of obtaining a provisionally qualifying mark for
nationals.
Just when things started to make sense on the week be
fore the championship portion of the season, the Cardinal
will also be sending three athletes to Tacoma, Wash, lor
the I ISA National Cross Country Championships.
