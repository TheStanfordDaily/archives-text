# No. 7 Card takes on winless Gaels
## 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Just because No. 7 Stanford (3-3) has climbed back to
,S(X) docs not mean the Cardinal will begin to treat any
of its opponents lightly.
That includes usually weak teams like Saint Mary's,
who Stanford takes on this afternoon at 4:30 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said he realizes

that despite the Cardinal's outburst of seven runs in the
second inning of Sunday's 13-7 victory over Cal State-
Fullerton, its offense is still inconsistent and the pitching
has been largely ineffective.
"We've shown that we can go through a game and
not hit," he said, referring to last Friday's two-hit 8-0 loss
to Fullerton. "If you don't hit, and you don't score runs,
anybody can beat you."
Anybody, but probably not St. Mary's (0-4).
The Gaels went 12-29 last year and responded by

promoting former assistant John Baptista to head
coach. However, not much has changed for St. Mary s so
far. The team began the year by getting blown out ot
their season-opening series to Arizona and losing to
Fresno State 5-2 last Tuesday.
Despite this poor start and the fact that Stanford
leads the all-time series 39-8, Marquess counsels that St.
Mary's is not a bad team.
"They're solid and they'll play well against us, they
always do," he said. "They have a new coach and some
young, talented players."
Marquess said, in baseball, "if one pitcher has a good
day against you, he can shut you down, even if you are
hitting well. Combine that with the fact that we haven t
really swung the bat well the last couple of games and
I'm worried about everyone we play."
Sophomore right-hander Jason Young will start for
the Cardinal this afternoon.

Young had an exceptional opening outing versus
Fresno State, striking out seven and allowing just one
hit, an infield single, in six innings. However, he strug
gled against Fullerton last Friday night. In just five in
nings of work, he allowed five runs on eight hits and five
walks.
Although Young and the rest of the starting staff
have struggled so far. Marquess is not worried.
"It's not surprising," he said. "Even though they're
talented, they haven't [started] before. It means that
there's an opportunity for a lot of pitchers to pitch.
There's going to be a lot of competition."
Marquess has already started the competition, giving
10 different pitchers, including five freshmen, the
chance to throw in the first six games.
Friday night alone, sophomore Jim Vankoski and
freshmen J.D. Willcox and Mike Wodnicki made their
first appearances for the Cardinal.
"The situation was there; we were behind and I want
ed to get them some experience without having to [face
pressure]," Marquess said. "It was good for them to get
their feet wet a little bit."
Sunday night, freshman Jason VanMeetren made his
first start for Stanford, replacing junior Craig Thompson
as the left fielder and leadoff man. Although Thompson
has only two hits in 18 at-bats and VanMeetren had two
hits in Sunday's game alone, Marquess did not say Van-
Meetren would move into the regular starting role.
"I, haven't been disappointed with Thompson," he
said. "It was just an opportunity to get VanMeetren into
the game; [Fullerton] started a left-hander. I think
Jason's going to be a real good player for us, but it was
just the opportunity to get him some at-bats."
