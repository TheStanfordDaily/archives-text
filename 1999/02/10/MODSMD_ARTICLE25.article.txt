Stanford quali
fied another five
athletes auto
matically for the
Feb. 5-6 NCAA
championships.
Stanford has
now accumulat-

Ed 11 automatic qualifiers for the
national meet.
At the Cyclone Classic, it was the
Cardinal distance runners who sent
a reminder to defending indoor
champs Arkansas about the
progress of this consistently tough
squad.
Senior Nathan Nutter cruised to
a second-place finish in the 5,0()0
meters with a time of 13 minutes,
57.68 seconds, his first automatic
qualifier of the year.
Brothers Brad and Brent
Hauser captured their second auto
matic marks, this time in the 3,000
meters. Brad finished fourth in
7:51.95, while Brent was seventh in
7:56.30.
Then, in the marquee event of
the indoor season, Stember and
Riley took to the track against a
field comprised of several sub-4:00
milers and other established dis
tance runners.
After cruising through relatively

even splits through the first 1,200
meters, Riley freed himself from
traffic on the inside of the track and
pounced into the lead. Distancing
himself from the field, only Stember
could hold on to Riley's pace.
With just 150 meters to go, Stem
ber surged past Riley and towed
him through the remainder of their
58-second last quarter-mile. Stem
ber blasted across the finish stripe in
a first place time of 3:58.50, and
Riley was just a step back at 3:58.72.
"Both Jonathon and Michael
have been training very well," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "The
four-minute barrier is an excellent
credential for a middle-distance
runner to possess."
Not only were both times auto
matic qualifiers and personal bests,
but they also secured the top two
spots in the nation at that distance.
Jake Maas was a solid fourth place
at 4:02.28, a provisional qualifier.
"The facility was great, the ath
letes prepared well, and they were
excited to compete," Lananna said.
"We have been training hard and
the athletes capitalized on the op
portunity to race well."
While the distance runners were
busy posting national marks in
lowa, Stanford's throwers and
jumpers made the short trip to
Reno to set a few top-notch marks
of their own.
Junior Toby Stevenson contin
ued to return to the form that gar
nered him a national title in the pole
vault outdoors last year with a sea
son-best mark of 18 feet, one inch.
He now holds the No. 3 spot in the
nation.
Sophomore Todd Beyerlein
continued his string of strong per
formances with a 6-11 high jump,
earning him first place.
