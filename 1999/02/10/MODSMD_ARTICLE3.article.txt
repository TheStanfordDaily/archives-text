# Senators introduce amendment
## ASSU debates proposed graduate/undergrad separation 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
A coalition of undergraduate and graduate
senators formally introduced an amendment to
the ASSU constitution that would create separate
legislative bodies for undergraduate and graduate
students at last night's ASSU meeting in room 190
of the Law School.
Graduate student Dave Robinson, chair of the
ASSU Administration and Rules Committee, in
troduced the 43 page amendment, titled "An
ASSU for All Students: Effective Advocacy &

Improved Programming."
Reading from the amendment's summary, he
emphasized that "the proposal allows graduate
and undergraduate students to represent them
selves in the way that works best for each."
Robinson added that the ASSU works well for
undergraduates, but graduate students haven't
felt their participation in the senate to be as grati
fying.
The new Graduate Student Council, accord
ing to the summary, "would represent graduate
students in the same capacity that the Under
graduate Senate serves its population, but its

structure would be much more open and flexi
ble. .
An executive committee would coordinate the
Iwo bodies, making sure that I hey "stay tied to
gether and don't go their separate ways," said
Robinson. The committee would also determine
what issues are relevant for both bodies, calling
joint meetings when appropriate and "fostering
informal collaboration between bodies."
The third main area that the amendment ad
dresses is use of programming resources. Gradu
ate students currently contribute the majority of
funds, but "most of that gets allocat
ed for undergraduate events," said
Robinson. "There is a need for more
graduate student programming.
[Graduate students] complain that
there are not enough social events
that bring everyone together."
Once debate opened, the prima
ry issue discussed was that of gradu
ate student participation on commit
tees. Appropriations committee
member Malia Villegas raised the
point that "graduate student partic
ipation has been highly beneficial to
undergraduate issues."
However, after some discussion,
she said she "realized that a lot of
their efforts have been in vain."
Graduate students would still be in
volved in committees, only now
solely through the GSC.
This proposal has been devel
oped for the past several months by
a coalition of graduate and under

graduate senators, ASSU President
Maren Norton, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Santos Marroquin and the
GSC. The senate will vote on the
amendment at its next meeting, Feb.
23, with a two-thirds approval vote
required for it to pass.
Earlier in the meeting Norton
read a statement in which she, with
the "utmost respect," publicly con
demned University President Ger
hard Casper's decision to appoint
students to the provost search com
mittee without ASSU approval.
The ASSU constitution reads,
"The Senate shall have the right to
confirm appointments of represen
tatives of the Stanford student
body." Norton emphasized that by
signing his letter of acceptance in
19% Casper recognized the ASSU
constitution as University policy.
Norton plans to meet with the
general counsel of the University
and has met with the president's of
fice in an effort to "demand that
from this time forward such an ac
tion does not occur again."
