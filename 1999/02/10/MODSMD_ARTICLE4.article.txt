# Students protest universities' ties to sweat shops
## 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
Recent waves of student protest at universities nation
wide have refoeused attention on Stanford's affiliation
with Nike and the company's foreign labor practices.
Nike, one of the Stanford Athletics Department's
many corporate sponsors, has been singled out by stu
dents for the conditions in its factories in Asia.
Last spring, Stanford students held up picket signs that
read "Shame on Nike," when Business School alum and
Nike CEO Philip Knight, spoke on campus about his com
pany's labor policies.
Nationwide criticism
Last week, students at both Duke and Georgetown
11 niversities demonstrated against the working conditions
in factories that produce college athletic apparel, succeed
ing in convincing their administrations to sign more so
cially responsible licensing contracts.
These two universities are the first to institute such
strict conduct codes, setting a new precedent.
To achieve these demands, members of the Duke Uni
versity Students Against Sweatshops held a 31 -hour sit-in.
The group had demanded that university officials not sign
the Collegiate Licensing Company's anti-sweatshop code
unless it was amended to require full disclosure by college
apparel manufacturers about the occupational health and
safety standards in their foreign factories and the location
of all production facilities.
The Collegiate Licensing Company oversees the li-
censing contracts of more than 160
universities, including Duke and
Georgetown Universities, but not
Stanford's. The agreement is titled
the Code of Conduct.
At Georgetown, members of the
Georgetown Solidarity Committee, a
student group devoted to worker's is
sues, also staged a sit-in. The group
felt that the code contained too many
loopholes.
Georgetown, like Duke, will now
require full disclosure of factory loca
tions from its apparel licensees.
Criticizing Nike
Nike's labor policies came under
fire in 1997 when a disgruntled em
ployee leaked an internal report, de

tailing abysmal working conditions in
its foreign shoe factories.
The policies have led students to
question Stanford's affiliation with
the company.
Senior Jill Shenker, a member of
the Student Labor Action Coalition,
was one of the students that protested
against Nike at a career fair last
spring. She acknowledged that the
Athletics Department depends on
Nike for some of its funding, but sug
gested alternatives.
"Either find alternate funding, or
make demands on Nike in our con
tract that they follow certain human
rights legislation," Shenker said.
"When we first started we thought
we could really get universities to
cancel contracts. But that's really
hard to do," admitted Medea Ben
jamin, co-director of the San Francis

co based human rights group Global
Exchange.
"Instead, we emphasize using the
fact that you have these contractual#
leverage to change these companies."
Benjamin also observed that Stan
lord, with its prominence, was in a
special position to affect apparel pro
ducer's labor practiced
Stanford's contract policies
Senior Associate Athletic Direc
tor Cheryl Levick said that the Ath
letics Department's corporate spon
sor contract policy precluded using
pressure at the bargaining table.
"Individual coaches are contract
ed with Nike or other apparel compa
nies. The big difference [between our
department and Duke's] is that 1
think Duke has a department-wide
contract. We don't have a multi-sport
contract with Nike," Levick ex

plained.
Robert Carruesco, marketing
manager for the Athletics Depart
ment, said that the Pacific 10 Confer
ence had contemplated an agreement
similar to the Collegiate Licensing
Company's Code oi Conduct.
"We talked about that at a meet
ing at a couple months ago. There
were a great many problems because
it was premature.'' Carruesco said.
He noted that it was difficult to reach
consensus on a possible code because
"there were so many groups in
volved" with different opinions.
Athletic Director Fed Leland said
that any plans for any code of conduct
regulating Stanford licensees or
sponsors were still very uncertain.
Leland was not sure if Stanford
would jointly adopt such a code with
other schools in the Pac-10.
"More importantly... it seems to

me if we're going talk about the social
business practices of a company like
this, any decisions would have Uni
versity-wide ramifications," Leland
added.
Leland also said that the Athletic
Department "may at some point"
contract Nike as the sole provider of
apparel for all athletic teams.
In defense of Nike
Senior Marc Mitchell, the Nike
student representative at Stanford,
did not think that students should be
concerned about the prospect of Nike
as the sole supplier for teams.
"I think Nike has proved over the
years that they are the leader of the
industry. Many programs that they
have installed recently illustrate that:
educational programs, micro-loan
programs to help workers start their
own businesses, a zero-tolerance pol

icy for abuse. All Nike workers are
paid at least and in most cases higher
than the minimum wage in their
country," Mitchell said.
Ryan Parks, president of College
Republicans, concurred with
Mitchell's assessment of Nike's wage
policies. "Nike is in business and
should be commended for providing
jobs that pay better than the average
local wage," Parks said.
Global Exchange's Website, how
ever, noted that the minimum wage
in many Asian countries is purposely
set below subsistence level to attract
foreign investment.
"Right now so many of our indi
vidual coaches and individual teams
have contracts that run through 2(M)1
that we're not really in a position to
consider a multi-sport contract right
now," Leland explained. "We're just
trying to beat UCLA."

"More importantly... it seems to

me if we're going talk about the social
business practices of a company like
this, any decisions would have Uni
versity-wide ramifications," Leland
added.
Leland also said that the Athletic
Department "may at some point"
contract Nike as the sole provider of
apparel for all athletic teams.
In defense of Nike
Senior Marc Mitchell, the Nike
student representative at Stanford,
did not think that students should be
concerned about the prospect of Nike
as the sole supplier for teams.
"I think Nike has proved over the
years that they are the leader of the
industry. Many programs that they
have installed recently illustrate that:
educational programs, micro-loan
programs to help workers start their
own businesses, a zero-tolerance pol

icy for abuse. All Nike workers are
paid at least and in most cases higher
than the minimum wage in their
country," Mitchell said.
Ryan Parks, president of College
Republicans, concurred with
Mitchell's assessment of Nike's wage
policies. "Nike is in business and
should be commended for providing
jobs that pay better than the average
local wage," Parks said.
Global Exchange's Website, how
ever, noted that the minimum wage
in many Asian countries is purposely
set below subsistence level to attract
foreign investment.
"Right now so many of our indi
vidual coaches and individual teams
have contracts that run through 2(M)1
that we're not really in a position to
consider a multi-sport contract right
now," Leland explained. "We're just
trying to beat UCLA."
