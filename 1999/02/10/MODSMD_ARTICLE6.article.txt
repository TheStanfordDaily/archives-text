# Sexes split over health
## Women seek health care more than men

A casual scan of the newsstand reveals cov
ers of Glamour and Mademoiselle pushing ar
ticles on fashion, flab-fighting, and reproduc
tive health, while Details and GO offer stories
of adventure in the Amazon, CIA drug wars
and celebrity interviews.
Although in many cases it is debatable
whether or not these magazines represent real
ity, differences in men's and women's attitudes
toward their personal health are marked.
Mental health seems to be the area of largest
discrepancy between men's and women's usage
of campus resources. An annual report issued
recently by the Stanford Help Center, which
provides free counseling to Stanford faculty
and staff, indicated that 67 percent of those who
visited the center last year were women, while
only 33 percent were men.
Likewise, Adrienne Watt. University rela
tions coordinator at The Bridge, estimated that
about 60 percent of callers and visitors to the
counseling center are women. Counseling and
Psychological Services reported that 64.1 per
cent of visitors and callers arc women and 35.8
percent are men â€” figures that are consistent
with national statistics, according to ('APS Di
rector Alejandro Martinez.
Martinez believes women seek more sup
port than men because "women are more in
terested in learning and dealing with personal
issues in more interpersonally interactive ways.
In contrast, more men have indicated that they
prefer to learn and deal with these issues
through written materials and other less inter

personal mechanisms."
As a whole, men and women come to CAPS
for help with similar problems, many of which
involve relationships, self esteem, anxiety and
depression. However, in Martinez's experi
ence, issues of sexual abuse affect women
more.
The Stanford Student Health Needs Assess
ment study, conducted by Cowell Student
Health Services in 1997, found that men self-re
ported greater frequencies of emotional well
being than did women.
Carole Pertofsky. director of Health Promo
tion Services at Cowell, attributes this trend to
"gender role socialization." She believes that
schools like Stanford value traditionally mascu
line behaviors such as competition and as
sertiveness, forcing many women to adapt a
more masculine model of thinking.
"These efforts to constantly change and
adapt leads to anxiety, depression and feeling
tired, both physically and emotionally," Pertof
sky explained.
Caring for the body
Physical health service providers also saw a
difference in male and female approaches to
wards their bodies. Although Cowell did not
have formal statistics available, figures for the
morning of Feb. 4 indicated 46 male visitors and
56 female visitors.
"There wasn't that big a difference between
male and female visits, but if it wasn't in the
middle of flu season, my suspicion would be
that we'd see more female patients,"
said Robyn Tepper, chief of medical
services at Cowell.
Pertofsky agreed with Tepper's
intuition. "In general, women are
more apt to respond earlier to feel
ing a bit unwell or to a minor injury.
Men are more inclined to be tough
and strong," she said.
Sophomore Tom Nguyen
agreed: "Men generally want to pre
sent themselves as stable in regards
to [health) issues. Only in very ex
treme cases do 1 feel that I am oblig
ed to seek out [health] services."
"Men just don't want to be seen
as not being invincible," added ju
nior Cruz Caldera.
Motives for seeking health care
Men and women not only differ

in how often they use health re
sources on campus, hut in their rea
sons for seeking care. According to
Tepper, many women enter the
physical health care system seeking
contraception. Before prescribing
birth control, Cowell requires that
women undergo an annual exam.
Men have no similar impetus to seek
out care.
While women seem to focus on
health maintenance, many men only
request medical care when they are
sick or injured. In fact, men report
more injuries due to bicycle and
motor accidents than do women, a
fact Pertofsky attributes to the tradi
tional male gender role as risk taker.
"However, men coming in for
health maintenance exams is not
something that doesn't happen. It's
not even something that's rare,"
Tepper said.
The Health Needs Assessment
provides one possible reason for the

gender difference. In 1997, 34 per
cent of men reported their health as
"excellent," while only 21 percent of
women did.
Pertofsky believes that women
require more physical health main
tenance because they are more
physiologically complex.
Freshman Zoe Chafe agrees:
"Women often require specialized
care, like 08/GYN, that men do
not. 1 often think of women's health
issues as being more complex and
pressing than those of men."
According to an informal survey
of students, there is a generally a
greater perceived need for and avail
ability of women's health services.
"I know there are specific re
sources available to women. But
there don't seem to be the same kind
of specific programs, like the
Women's Center, dedicated to
men," said junior Dana Serovy.
That doesn't mean that attitudes

arc not changing.
One area of greater equalization
is sexual health. The Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center reported a
relatively even distribution of male
and female visitors. Also, Pertofsky
said that more men than women
seek anonymous HIV testing.
SHPRC Co-Director Kate Bed
ford described the shift: "[Sexual
health has] stopped being exclusive
ly a women's space. Women used to
hold the consequences of sex but
that's not true anymore."
Pertofsky also reported equal
numbers of males and females ap
plied to be peer health educators this
year for the first time.
Support groups, usually targeted
towards females, are now also turn
ing up with male-oriented themes.
CAPS offers a group specifically for
men. titled "Men's Search for Mean
ing: Integrating Gender, Sexuality,
and Spirituality."
