# Sexes split over health
## Women seek health care more than men

A casual scan of the newsstand reveals cov
ers of Glamour and Mademoiselle pushing ar
ticles on fashion, flab-fighting, and reproduc
tive health, while Details and GO offer stories
of adventure in the Amazon, CIA drug wars
and celebrity interviews.
Although in many cases it is debatable
whether or not these magazines represent real
ity, differences in men's and women's attitudes
toward their personal health are marked.
Mental health seems to be the area of largest
discrepancy between men's and women's usage
of campus resources. An annual report issued
recently by the Stanford Help Center, which
provides free counseling to Stanford faculty
and staff, indicated that 67 percent of those who
visited the center last year were women, while
only 33 percent were men.
Likewise, Adrienne Watt. University rela
tions coordinator at The Bridge, estimated that
about 60 percent of callers and visitors to the
counseling center are women. Counseling and
Psychological Services reported that 64.1 per
cent of visitors and callers arc women and 35.8
percent are men â€” figures that are consistent
with national statistics, according to ('APS Di
rector Alejandro Martinez.
Martinez believes women seek more sup
port than men because "women are more in
terested in learning and dealing with personal
issues in more interpersonally interactive ways.
In contrast, more men have indicated that they
prefer to learn and deal with these issues
through written materials and other less inter

personal mechanisms."
As a whole, men and women come to CAPS
for help with similar problems, many of which
involve relationships, self esteem, anxiety and
depression. However, in Martinez's experi
ence, issues of sexual abuse affect women
more.
The Stanford Student Health Needs Assess
ment study, conducted by Cowell Student
Health Services in 1997, found that men self-re
ported greater frequencies of emotional well
being than did women.
Carole Pertofsky. director of Health Promo
tion Services at Cowell, attributes this trend to
"gender role socialization." She believes that
schools like Stanford value traditionally mascu
line behaviors such as competition and as
sertiveness, forcing many women to adapt a
more masculine model of thinking.
"These efforts to constantly change and
adapt leads to anxiety, depression and feeling
tired, both physically and emotionally," Pertof
sky explained.
Caring for the body
Physical health service providers also saw a
difference in male and female approaches to
wards their bodies. Although Cowell did not
have formal statistics available, figures for the
morning of Feb. 4 indicated 46 male visitors and
56 female visitors.
"There wasn't that big a difference between
male and female visits, but if it wasn't in the
middle of flu season, my suspicion would be
