Discounts on lift tickets for anyone who uses a Wells Fargo ATM
|«hp«ih| Now anyone can get great savings on great slopes, whether you strap one
BttgWj™™™ board to your feet or two. Just stop by a Wells Fargo ATM with the Snow
■■■■■■#■♦; Sport Express symbol and you can buy discount vouchers
good for lift tickets and lesson packages at Heavenly, Northstar, Sierra or
Sugar Bowl. You don't even have to be a Wells Fargo customer. But if you sign
up for our Student Banking Combo, you'll get Student ATM Checking, a
Student MasterCard and free online banking. Not to mention bankers who
move so fast to serve you, you'd swear they were going to catch air.
