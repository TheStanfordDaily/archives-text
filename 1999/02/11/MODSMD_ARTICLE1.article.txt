# Mixed reviews for I-Hum's team-teaching
## 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Editor's note: This is the continuation
of a two-part series on changes in
Area One. Today we look at team
teaching, lectures and sections, and
the future of I-Hum.
Area One officials are hailing the
gradual replacement of Cultures,
Ideas and Values with Introduction
to the Humanities as a success and
have laid out plans for next year's I-
Hum offerings. Meanwhile, student
opinions of the I-Hum program are
mixed.
In addition to the reduced reading
load and the attempt to increase the
diversity of authors, another element
of I-Hum that organizers said has
proven crucial has been team-teach
ing. In this approach two or three
professors alternately give lectures
on required texts.
Josh Landv. assistant professor of
French and Italian, was one of three
lecturers who taught the fall course
"The Good Life." He said that the
team teaching proved beneficial to
students.

We're looking not only to
the things that are working;
we want to do everything
possible to make it better.'

"I can only speak for our team,
but it worked really well," Landy
said. "It gives students an exposure to
different styles, and hopefully they
get a sense of what it means to have
different approaches to literary
analysis."
"I learned a lot from it too,"
Landy added. "'It's a hidden benefit
from team-teaching."
While the lectures offered differ
ent viewpoints, some freshmen said
that lectures were not sufficiently
clear or direct.
Freshman Maureen Fan, who
took "Themes and Variations" in the
fall, said, "Often times the lectures
were so bad that our TA spent most
of the time in section explaining what
the lecture was about."
Elam said he hopes that the lec
tures and sections will integrate suc
cessfully to enhance the student's un
derstanding of the text.
"Lectures can be an impersonal
thing: within that process, yoi get a
singular argument focusing on the
text in a particular way, and you see
how a professor shapes the materi
al," he said.
"What we want to see is the intei

action of that particular lecture with
the discussion sections."
With this principle in mind, Elam
said, the Area One legislation has
mandated that the average section
size be no higher than 15 students
and that each course contain two
hours of lecture time and three hours
of discussion section each week.
However, Fan said that the sec
tions, which meet twice a week for
one and a half hours, are simply too
long.
"Most importantly, the sections
should be shorter. By the end of one
and a half hours, you are totally dead.
You just can't discuss intensively for
that long a period of time," she said.
Elam said he hopes that the I-
Hum program will be adaptable to
student concerns and criticism. In
this spirit the Area One office recent
ly conducted focus groups in which
freshmen contributed their feedback
regarding their fall-quarter I-Hum
experiences.
"We're looking not only to the
things that are working; we want to
do everything possible to make it bet
ter," Elam said. "We take comments
we get in focus groups very serious
ly"
As for next year's plans, Ross said
that the Area One program will offer
eight fall courses for incoming fresh
men to choose from and hopes to
offer nine to eleven choices for the
winter-spring sequence.
She added that course organizers
are attempting to broaden the scope
of the I-Hum program. Next year
they will offer a "Great Works"
course from the French and Italian
department, an anthropology course
with a partial focus on India and a
course from the Slavic Languages de
partment. which will concentrate on
political philosophy.
"We'll always try to refresh the
options available to freshmen," Ross
said.
Elam said that in the long term the
Area One requirement w 1 once
again be entirely revamped in the
next decade.
"What is written into the iegisla
tion ... is that the I-Hum program
has to be reviewed and will change in
10 years," he said.
Elam said that the CIV program
lasted for 10 years and that he be
lieves pressures from both students
and the discipline of the humanities
will limit I-Hum to a similar life span.
"The humanities arc a really
rapidly changing field. Given
changes in t'le 1 12; -Id coupled with
changes in Stan, >rd students, we
want to make the requirements meet
the needs of students as well as reflect
what is happening in the field."
