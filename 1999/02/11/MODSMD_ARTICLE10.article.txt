# Two GOP senators to vote to acquit

### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Two
Republican senators declared yes
terday they would vote to acquit
President Clinton of both articles
of impeachment, the clearest sign
yet as the trial neared an end that
the charges would fall far short of
conviction.
Sens. James Jeffords of Ver
mont and Arlen Specter of Penn
sylvania were the first Republi
cans to announce opposition to
both articles, perjury and obstruc
tion of justice in the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
Jeffords said enough Republi
cans may join them to hold the
final roll calls today or tomorrow
short of even a majority of 51
votes. Only a constitutional two
thirds — 67 votes in the 100-mem
ber Senate — could convict and
oust Clinton, the second president
in history to be put on trial.
As the Senate plodded through
a second day of closed-door delib
erations, Jeffords said Clinton
"gave misleading statements .. .
did obstruct justice, but his actions
in this case do not reach the high
standard of impeachment."
A short while later. Specter
said the charges "have not been
proved" at the historic month
long trial now drawing to a close.
He said he wished Clinton, who
refused to be questioned in writ
ing or in person, had submitted to
a "firm examination" by lawyers
in the case.
With solid support among the
Senate's 45 Democrats, the presi
dent has long been out of danger
of conviction. Failure to deliver a
simple majority for either article
in the Senate, controlled by 55
Republicans, would be a stinging
repudiation of the case that the
GOP House voted to take to trial
and its 13 prosecutor-congress
men argued to the senators.
With Clinton's acquittal
assured, Democrats continued
their campaign for a formal vote

to censure the president after the
trial. But Republican opposition
seemed to be stiffening, and
Specter said censure would violate
the constitutional doctrine of sep
aration of powers.
"There's been very little men
tion of censure" in the closed
door deliberations, said Sen. Bill
Frist, R-Tenn. "To me, the push
for censure is losing steam."
With Chief Justice William
Rehnquist presiding, the Senate
spent a second day behind closed
doors, senators taking turns deliv
ering their final statements.
Majority Leader Trent Lott told
reporters at a midday break that
26 to 28 lawmakers had spoken at
that point in the closed-door
deliberations. He said he hoped a
final vote was still possible by late
today, although he indicated it
could slip to tomorrow.
Jeffords and Specter are among
the most moderate Senate Repub
licans, and had long been viewed
as possible votes for acquittal.
"The facts and circumstances
of this case are low and tawdry,
but these same circumstances do
not, in my opinion, cause his
offenses to rise to the level of
impeachable acts," Jeffords said in
his statement.
Specter said that under Scottish
law. three verdicts are possible:
guilty, not guilty or not proved.
He opted for the third.
Specter was critical of the trial
itself, saying only "partial justice"
had been served since House
prosecutors were hampered by
the Senate's unwillingness to call
witnesses.
"If the full weight of the evi
dence with live witnesses had
been presented to the Senate
instead of bits and pieces of cold
transcript, it is possible the Senate
and the American people would
have demanded the president's
appearance in the well of the Sen
ate."
