# New reign leads to Jordan royal disunity
## 
### 
AMMAN. Jordan (AP)-The man who spent his
life preparing to sit on the Hashemite throne was
absent when the new monarch began greeting his sub
jects.
The death of King Hussein did more than shake up
his nation. It rattled the royal family to the core.
At the center of the storm is Hussein's brother, 51-
year-old Prince Hassan, who had been groomed as the
royal heir for more than three decades. Then a quarrel
over succession left Ha an out in the cold last month
when the ailing Hussein picked his eldest son, Abdul
lah. to take the throne after his death.
After Hussein died Sunday and King Abdullah
took power, the family publicly united for the funeral.
But Hassan's decision to stay away from the greet
ing ceremony Tuesday could point to cracks emerging.
This has some people nervous after 46 years of stead
fast rule under Hussein, although Hassan attended
similar condolence ceremonies today.
"There is no room for any family rift because that
will imperil national security and disturb the personal
interests of the royal family," said former Cabinet min
ister Jamal Shaer.
There is little chance of a serious challenge since the
military is loyal to Abdullah, 37. a career officer. Yet
Jordanians grow quickly uneasy over any royal discord
in their small desert kingdom with an unmatched
record of stability in the volatile Middle East.

"The monarchy here allows for one head of state,
not two," said political analyst Labib Kamhawi. "Has
san's options are simple and clear: Either to stay in the
country quietly or leave."
Hassan's world came crashing down on Jan. 26.
Hussein sent his brother an angry letter of dismissal,
accusing him of power-grabbing and fabricating "lies
and gossip" about his family.
Palace sources said Hussein was referring to false
allegations that his wife, Oucen Noor, had an out-of
wedlock child before marriage and that she was
maneuvering to have her son, 1 lamzeh, replace I lassan
as crown prince — as he ultimately did.
At Hussein's funeral Monday, Hassan and his 19-
year-old son Rashid were virtually the only immediate
members of the family who did not wear the tradition
al mourning headdress.
Hassan stood silently, staring at the ceiling of the
ornate throne chamber in Raghdan Palace, as other
members of the family tearfully shook hands with
heads of state and dignitaries paying respects.
Hassan's Pakistani-born wife. Princess Sarvath. and
their three daughters were not with other female mem
bers of the royal family during the funeral. Hassan's
daughters did not visit their uncle in his last days, when
all the other royal family members were in constant
attendance.
In an emotional letter to Abdullah read l uesdav

night on Jordan Television. Hassan pledged his sup
port for the king and crown prince.
"I vow in front of God. the nation, and our great
people to support you and be a brother to your majesty
and your crown prince," Hassan wrote.
There have been suggestions that Abdullah would
appoint Hassan as a chief adviser to primarily oversee
economic development in Jordan.
But it was not immediately clear if Hassan would
accept a post that would require working under his
nephew, 18-year-old Prince Hamzeh. As crown prince.
Hamzeh is now No. 2 under King Abdullah, responsi
ble for the country's affairs when Abdullah is away.
Hamzeh is Hussein's son from his fourth wife.
American-born Queen Noor. who converted to Islam
before she married the king in 1978. Noor had irritat
ed Hassan's family by grooming Hamzeh for the
throne in recent years, royal palace sources said.
Another factor is Princess Muna — the former Toni
Gardiner — Hussein's British-born second wife and
Abdullah's mother. She lived in Britain after her
divorce, but was in Jordan during Hussein's final ill
ness. visiting him frequently at the hospital.
Muna had been little seen publicly in Amman for
some years, but on Tuesday she joined Noor and other
royal relatives in receiving condolences from Jordani
an women. In addition to Abdullah, she had a second
son and twin daughters with Hussein.
