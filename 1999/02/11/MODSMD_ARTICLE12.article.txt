# Cancer growth linked to cyclosporine

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Cyclosporine, a drug
given to transplant patients to prevent organ rcjec
tion, may turn pre-existing cancer more aggressive,
researchers say.
Transplants always carried the risk of cancer
because doctors must suppress the immune system
with powerful drugs such as cyclosporine to prevent
the patient's body from attacking the new organ.
But previously it was believed the cancer risk
increased because the weakened immune system
failed to destroy defective cells that could turn malig
nant.
"This study suggests the drug has a direct effect on
the tumor cell and enhances it growth," said Dr. Gary
Nabel, a University of Michigan researcher who spe
cializes in the immune system.
The study was conducted by Cornell University
researchers and published in today's issue of the jour

nal Nature.
Doctors were quick to caution that the findings
will not affect treatment of transplant patients
because it applies only to cancer that has already
formed.
In fact, they emphasized the study provides an
important clue about blocking cancer growth.
"If anything, it's a reason for hope," said Dr.
Manikkam Suthanthiran. chief of transplant medicine
at Cornell.
Suthanthiran and his colleagues isolated human
lung and bladder cancer cells that were treated with
cyclosporine. They also injected cancerous cells into
specially bred mice that had virtually no immune sys
tem.
The findings indicated that cyclosporine promotes
the production of a natural protein called transform
ing growth factor beta, already a suspect in cancer

growth.
"Our findings in no way mean this is increasing the
incidence of cancer," Suthanthiran said. "It more
reflects that cancer can be made more aggressive by a
certain protein."
He added that the study reveals a potential mech
anism for blocking cancer by inhibiting the produc
tion of TGF beta.
Cyclosporine, which is also used to treat arthritis,
is made by the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant
Novartis. Geoff Cook, a Novartis spokesman, said the
company sees no cause for concern.
Dr. Israel Penn. a transplant pioneer at the Uni
versity of Cincinnati, said only a small proportion of
transplant patients have pre-existing cancer.
"For the tens of thousands of people receiving
cyclosporine for years with very beneficial results, the
good far, far outweighs the bad." he said.
