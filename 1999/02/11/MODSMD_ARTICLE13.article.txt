## Editorial Battling over tenure 
### 
History of conflicts
over tenure merit
outside probe

The university should
have seen this coming. But, at
the most recent Faculty Senate
meeting. University President Ger
hard Casper said he was surprised to
read the newspaper and find out that
the U.S. Labor Department is consid
ering an investigation into Stanford's
tenure policies. However, the possible
probe by the Labor Department is
not a surprising development in a
University with a record of controver
sy over tenure of women faculty.
Ilie central question in the Labor
Department probe is whether Stan
ford practices gender discrimination in
hiring and promotion, including
tenure; a so-called "unconscious bias."
The University has a policy of using
affirmative action when hiring new
professors, but not in regards to the
issues surrounding tenure.
Among the female professors who
have won tenure, a shocking number
were forced to fight for their academ
ic lives, resorting to techniques from
student protests to lawsuits against
the University to secure their profes
sorships.
In the 19K0's, History Prof. Estelle
Friedman sued the University after
initially being denied tenure. History
Assoc. Prof. Gordon Chang also had
to light tooth and nail for his tenure.
There are lew indications that this is
no longer a problem today.
Students, in particular, are out
raged over the loss of some of their
favorite professors, who are often
considered to be some of the best
undergraduate instructors. That list
includes former History Asst. Prof.
Karen Sawislak, who studies labor
history, Anthropology Assoc. Prof.
Akhil Gupta and Religious Studies

Asst. Prof. Alice Bach.
Losing so many popular instructors
in such a short time sparked a lot of
controversy among students and fac
ulty, and the ensuing protests should
have sent a message to the University.
Granting a tenured position is, no
doubt, a difficult process, and the
merit-based approach so heavily
endorsed by Provost Condoleezza
Rice makes a certain amount of sense.
The female professors who filed the
complaint with federal officials cer
tainly did not do so just to gain pref
erential treatment. Their call for an
investigation is justified in other ways.
Considering the University's
notable obstinacy against changing the
policies that lead to angry professors
and often more irate students, the
Labor Department investigation may
serve a very useful purpose, simply due
to the outside perspective that the
investigation will provide and the
notoriety it has caused. In short, it
would force Stanford to officially justi
fy the role of affirmative action in its
tenure system.
Sawislak and the other professors
who filed the complaint with the
Labor Department insist that they are
not after preferential treatment, only
fair consideration. Considering the
firestorms that have a history of
erupting around the tenure process,
the concerns of these faculty mem
bers certainly deserve to be heard.
ITie University should have been
expecting this type of complaint. A
track record of student and faculty
protest over gender issues in tenure
was bound to get the Labor Depart
ment's notice sooner or later. If the
government pursues its investigation,
it will help to send an important mes
sage that the issues surrounding tenure
must not be taken lightly. It is, howev
er, unfortunate that such action need
ed to be taken for the University to
finally listen to what students and fac
ulty have been saying all along.
