## Scholes' welcome is undeserved 
### 
The announced return of
Myron Scholes to Stanford hardly
four months after the Long-Term
Capital Management scandal rocked the
financial world should alarm whatever
moral sensitivity is left in us.
In the past a disgraced public figure was
expected to retreat TO a monastery for
some soul-searching. Today, he simply
assumes an academic position at a presti
gious university, gets fat salaries and
receives absolution from a morally senile
academia where ethical questions are
crushed under the granite plates of profes
sional prestige.
"We are delighted to have him back,"
stated the associate dean of the Graduate
School of Business in The Daily. You may
as wejl organize a hero's welcome. But
why? For discrediting his own theoretical
work or for threatening the world economy
with open bets worth $100 billion and total
transactions worth more than $1.2 trillion?
Both The New York Times and The
Washington Post covered the scandal, call
ing it "one of the biggest financial missteps
ever to hit Wall Street."
Do we forget that for days the media
was issuing continuous updates on the
impending collapse of LTCM, spreading
shock waves around the globe? Shall we
forget that the blind faith in a Nobelist's
work led to 100-to-l leverage levels report
ed in The New York Times? It that were
true, it would imply that with any amount
of initial capital and hundredfold borrow
ing they expected to yield profit no matter

what direction the markets followed.
I call that hubris. And life always finds
ways to crush titanic ambitions.
But let's accept that Scholes' work has a
positive dimension, for it helps generate
wealth, and that's good. The question, then,
is: Who really benefits from his alchemical
formulas? He does, obviously, because he
invested in LTCM. and so do the wealthy
customers of what The Washington Post
called the "Cadillac of hedge funds," who
expected undreamt-of profits. As for the
rest of the world, on whose shoulders all
these bets were made, let them drown.
Ambrose Bierce's definition of corpora
tion holds even more true for hedge funds:
"an ingenious device to generate individual
profit without individual responsibility."
Why not? The more you bet. the more you
endanger the system, hence the more likely
it is that Alan Greenspan will step in to
help save you. A win-win situation.
The worst for Scholes is to see his
income shrink down to six or seven digits;
the best, to return back to LTCM after
three years and resume his profit-hunting.
Who cares if the rest of the world sinks into
poverty? In fact, he may well have had a
generous contribution in that. Since the
time his magic formula has been applied,
economic inequality, both worldwide and
particularly in the United States, has
reached explosive levels.
If a soldier cannot kill millions, an
economist these days can condemn them to
poverty and starvation (as it has actually
happened in Russia).

And if we agree with The New York
Times that what Scholes did in LTCM was
make bets so daring that "when they went
wrong they threatened to destabilize the
whole system," the question is: Why should
universities be the harbors of gamblers?
Why should these selfish people be wel
come?
Perhaps it's my lack of training in
accepting injustice generated through
ultra-sophisticated methods of creating
wealth by stealing the future of others, prel
sented by dazzling professionals and
caramelized with humanistic rhetoric fol
low moral IQs. It does require effort to
swallow boulders of nonsense as the nectar
of wisdom.
Finally, I would declare myself the most
stupid student this university ever had if I
were to believe that the GSB really wel
comes to its ranks someone who endanr
gered the world economy in such an irre!-
sponsible way. Shame on me, for, academ
ic independence notwithstanding, the GS3
seems to lack the courage to direct the
shame where it really belongs.
I've never had anything against people,
just against actions. Thus, I cannot but wel
come Prof. Scholes back to the Farm pro
vided that his teaching begins with "Soul-
Searching for Economists" and drops alto
gether the "Aesthetics of Institutionalized
Global Gambling".
