Tuition increase unfair
Yesterday was a bad day. My jacket was
stolen, my foot hurt, midterms were hap
pening. ...
But, the worst was the tuition increase. I
read Evan Nordby's Feb. 10 article, hoping
to find some sort of rational justification for
the increase, but all I saw instead were
things like, "Stanford's costs are 'significant
ly behind our major competition for stu
dents.
This really got me thinking. Is it an
advantage to charge the same tuition as our
competition? It seems to me that "we cost
just ;is much" is not a strong selling point.
Further, I read about how our board
"earmarked) an additional $S(X),(XX) for
financial aid." This seems insufficient.
There are 6,591 undergraduate students
here, of whom a significant number receive
financial aid. With a tuition increase of
roughly $I,(XX) per person, this earmarked
money does not cut it. The reason is not just
because everyone will have to pay a few
hundred bucks, but because this money will
not be distributed evenly. For most students
on financial aid. the $I,(XX) increase will
mean another $I,(XX) that they will have to
pay out of their own pockets.
This does not seem fair. Nor does this
tuition increase seem justified. Talking
about a $S(X),(XX) slush fund is not very pro
ductive either. Perhaps its no wonder that
students were not included in the phrase
"University officials were enthusiastic
about the increase in financial aid funding."

Frosh / Soph college is
poor use of resources
As staff members in a large freshman
dormitory, we have a good perspective on
the academic and social needs of freshmen
at Stanford. Alter numerous discussions
with friends, residents, fellow resident assis
tants and head academic assistants, we have
concluded that the new Freshman / Sopho
more College at Sterling Quad does not
adequately meet (and in some cases totally
neglects) the needs of the freshmen and
sophomores who will he part of the pro
gram and the needs of the greater Stanford
community.
As many students have pointed out over
the past week, one basic flaw is the use of
Sterling Quad dorms as the setting for this
experiment. More troubling than the physi
cal location of the site is the reason behind
choosing it. As mentioned in The Daily on
Feb. 3, "due to the proximity to the house
that the University wished to use for Brav
man. Sterling Quad seemed to be the most
viable option." But this raises a troubling
question: how will closer student-faculty
interaction be facilitated by moving the fac
ulty farther away from the students, which is
exactly what is being done by putting Brav
man in a house across the street.
Equally unfathomable is the decision to
run this college outside of the jurisdiction of
the Office of Residential Education, and
according to a system more like that
employed in the Sophomore College pro
gram. Res Ed provides crucial training pro
grams which supply RAs with many of the
skills they will need during the year. It will

be a tremendous disservice to those
enrolled in the new college if the "college
assistants," as Bravman wishes to call them,
are not trained by Res Ed. In fact, Brav
man's vision goes so far as to suggest that all
resident staff positions (head advising asso
ciate, resident computing coordinator, etc.)
would be merged into a new position of col
lege assistant, effectively eliminating the
system of peer advising that has been so cru
cial to the success of undergraduate pro
grams and advising.
The economic aspects of this program
are truly ludicrous; $ 1 SO.(XK) has been bud
geted for this first year. Even if a third of
that money is being used to pay the rent on
Bravman's house, the remaining $120,(KK)
still blows away the operating budgets of all
other houses on campus, where resident fel
lows typically have budgets of $2,5(K)-S3,(KK)
for the entire year. It is a pathetic demon
stration of University bureaucracy that this
outrageous sum of money is being funneled
into a new program while an already estab
lished and exemplary program like Res Ed
is constantly denied the extra funding it
could desperately use.
Perhaps the greatest fault of this pro
gram lies in its premise that current faculty
will participate in it. Bravman promises to
bring some big names to this endeavor, but
from where will they come? Will he canni
balize the current advising system and steal
the few advisors at present who actually are
senior faculty? Indeed, though Bravman
claims that he will not, the cannibalism has
already begun with his own departure from
the Undergraduate Advising Center: Brav
man is currently a faculty advisor at Larkin.
If he is true to his word and no other senior

faculty are taken from the UAC, what
incentives will he provide for other senior
faculty to be a part of this program? What
message will be sent about the faculty's
commitment to teaching, if the administra
tion has to provide rewards for advising ser
vice? Finally, if the program succeeds in
recruiting all of the senior faculty it hopes
for, what kind of advisors will they make
anyway? These new advisors will be people
who were unwilling to advise students
through the UAC and are out of touch with
undergraduate life at Stanford. By tamper
ing with the current peer advising system of
RAs, HAAs and AAs, this program is
dooming a whole crop of students to advice
from professors who simply will not be able
to relate to students at their level.
In the end, all of these problems are
indicative of a larger one — the fact that the
University did a poor job of gauging student
opinion before going forth with this pro
gram. Indeed, though James Montoya and
Ramon Saldivar claim to have conducted
focus groups and meetings with students to
discuss these initiatives, all too often the
meetings that took place were too vague for
students to form opinions or occurred after
the administration had already made up its
mind on the issue. With deliberate tactics
like this to minimize student input and
opposition, it is no wonder that so many stu
dents feel the University is unresponsive to
their concerns.

because everyone will have to pay a few
hundred bucks, but because this money will
not be distributed evenly. For most students
on financial aid. the $I,(XX) increase will
mean another $I,(XX) that they will have to
pay out of their own pockets.
This does not seem fair. Nor does this
tuition increase seem justified. Talking
about a $S(X),(XX) slush fund is not very pro
ductive either. Perhaps its no wonder that
students were not included in the phrase
"University officials were enthusiastic
about the increase in financial aid funding."

Frosh / Soph college is
poor use of resources
As staff members in a large freshman
dormitory, we have a good perspective on
the academic and social needs of freshmen
at Stanford. Alter numerous discussions
with friends, residents, fellow resident assis
tants and head academic assistants, we have
concluded that the new Freshman / Sopho
more College at Sterling Quad does not
adequately meet (and in some cases totally
neglects) the needs of the freshmen and
sophomores who will he part of the pro
gram and the needs of the greater Stanford
community.
As many students have pointed out over
the past week, one basic flaw is the use of
Sterling Quad dorms as the setting for this
experiment. More troubling than the physi
cal location of the site is the reason behind
choosing it. As mentioned in The Daily on
Feb. 3, "due to the proximity to the house
that the University wished to use for Brav
man. Sterling Quad seemed to be the most
viable option." But this raises a troubling
question: how will closer student-faculty
interaction be facilitated by moving the fac
ulty farther away from the students, which is
exactly what is being done by putting Brav
man in a house across the street.
Equally unfathomable is the decision to
run this college outside of the jurisdiction of
the Office of Residential Education, and
according to a system more like that
employed in the Sophomore College pro
gram. Res Ed provides crucial training pro
grams which supply RAs with many of the
skills they will need during the year. It will

be a tremendous disservice to those
enrolled in the new college if the "college
assistants," as Bravman wishes to call them,
are not trained by Res Ed. In fact, Brav
man's vision goes so far as to suggest that all
resident staff positions (head advising asso
ciate, resident computing coordinator, etc.)
would be merged into a new position of col
lege assistant, effectively eliminating the
system of peer advising that has been so cru
cial to the success of undergraduate pro
grams and advising.
The economic aspects of this program
are truly ludicrous; $ 1 SO.(XK) has been bud
geted for this first year. Even if a third of
that money is being used to pay the rent on
Bravman's house, the remaining $120,(KK)
still blows away the operating budgets of all
other houses on campus, where resident fel
lows typically have budgets of $2,5(K)-S3,(KK)
for the entire year. It is a pathetic demon
stration of University bureaucracy that this
outrageous sum of money is being funneled
into a new program while an already estab
lished and exemplary program like Res Ed
is constantly denied the extra funding it
could desperately use.
Perhaps the greatest fault of this pro
gram lies in its premise that current faculty
will participate in it. Bravman promises to
bring some big names to this endeavor, but
from where will they come? Will he canni
balize the current advising system and steal
the few advisors at present who actually are
senior faculty? Indeed, though Bravman
claims that he will not, the cannibalism has
already begun with his own departure from
the Undergraduate Advising Center: Brav
man is currently a faculty advisor at Larkin.
If he is true to his word and no other senior

faculty are taken from the UAC, what
incentives will he provide for other senior
faculty to be a part of this program? What
message will be sent about the faculty's
commitment to teaching, if the administra
tion has to provide rewards for advising ser
vice? Finally, if the program succeeds in
recruiting all of the senior faculty it hopes
for, what kind of advisors will they make
anyway? These new advisors will be people
who were unwilling to advise students
through the UAC and are out of touch with
undergraduate life at Stanford. By tamper
ing with the current peer advising system of
RAs, HAAs and AAs, this program is
dooming a whole crop of students to advice
from professors who simply will not be able
to relate to students at their level.
In the end, all of these problems are
indicative of a larger one — the fact that the
University did a poor job of gauging student
opinion before going forth with this pro
gram. Indeed, though James Montoya and
Ramon Saldivar claim to have conducted
focus groups and meetings with students to
discuss these initiatives, all too often the
meetings that took place were too vague for
students to form opinions or occurred after
the administration had already made up its
mind on the issue. With deliberate tactics
like this to minimize student input and
opposition, it is no wonder that so many stu
dents feel the University is unresponsive to
their concerns.
