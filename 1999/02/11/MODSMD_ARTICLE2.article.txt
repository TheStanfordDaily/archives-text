# Retention of minority and female law profs debated
## Mabry's resignation causes issue to heat up 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Law School Dean Paul Brest held
an open meeting with law students
and faculty yesterday to address stu
dent concerns over the turnover rate
of minority faculty at the Law School.
The issue was of particular relevance
in light of the December resignation
of Prof. Linda Mabry, one of the Law
School's few minority professors.
Brest refused to comment on the
reasons for Mabry's resignation, and

she has not issued a public statement
yet concerning her departure.
"Students found out about her res
ignation when we came back this se
mester and found that her two classes
had been canceled," said Dominique
Day, a third-year law student.
Brest began the "town hall" meet
ing, which was attended by about 200
students, with an explanation of the
University's tenure practices.
"[The law school] makes recom
mendations of tenure when we want
to appoint a professor." said Brest.

"The University then applies the
same tenure standards as it does for
its undergraduate professors. Our cri
terion is to cast a very broad net at the
entry level stage to draw in a diverse
pool, but at the time of tenure, we do
not differentiate on race."
Brest also emphasized Stanford's
particularly "high standards" for aca
demic scholarship.
Day. however, voiced concern that
definitions of academic scholarship
are often cross-cultural, and that any
standard would be one developed by

the majority. "ITiere are a lot of mi
nority scholars who are writing in very
innovative fields," she said. "If a facul
ty member is an expert on activism in
the 19505, how can they accurately
judge activist scholarship of 1999?"
Some students expressed a desire
for an increase in breadth and diversi
ty in teaching methods. "As an
African-American student. I feel that
1 really could have benefited from a
bigger minority faculty community,"
