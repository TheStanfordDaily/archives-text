# Retention of minority and female law profs debated
## Mabry's resignation causes issue to heat up 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Law School Dean Paul Brest held
an open meeting with law students
and faculty yesterday to address stu
dent concerns over the turnover rate
of minority faculty at the Law School.
The issue was of particular relevance
in light of the December resignation
of Prof. Linda Mabry, one of the Law
School's few minority professors.
Brest refused to comment on the
reasons for Mabry's resignation, and

she has not issued a public statement
yet concerning her departure.
"Students found out about her res
ignation when we came back this se
mester and found that her two classes
had been canceled," said Dominique
Day, a third-year law student.
Brest began the "town hall" meet
ing, which was attended by about 200
students, with an explanation of the
University's tenure practices.
"[The law school] makes recom
mendations of tenure when we want
to appoint a professor." said Brest.

"The University then applies the
same tenure standards as it does for
its undergraduate professors. Our cri
terion is to cast a very broad net at the
entry level stage to draw in a diverse
pool, but at the time of tenure, we do
not differentiate on race."
Brest also emphasized Stanford's
particularly "high standards" for aca
demic scholarship.
Day. however, voiced concern that
definitions of academic scholarship
are often cross-cultural, and that any
standard would be one developed by

the majority. "ITiere are a lot of mi
nority scholars who are writing in very
innovative fields," she said. "If a facul
ty member is an expert on activism in
the 19505, how can they accurately
judge activist scholarship of 1999?"
Some students expressed a desire
for an increase in breadth and diversi
ty in teaching methods. "As an
African-American student. I feel that
1 really could have benefited from a
bigger minority faculty community,"

said Terry Gray, a third-year law stu
dent.
While Brest acknowledged this
need for more minority faculty mem
bers, he cited statistics that place Stan
ford second only to Harvard Law
Schml in its number of minority faculty.
Some students, however, were
skeptical of these numbers. "The sta
tistics spell a misleadingly positive
story of law school hiring and reten
tion," said David White, a second
year law student. "It's possible that
the numbers are roving, including lec

turers and people who are here only a
temporary basis.
Brest insisted that the law school
makes a concerted effort to recruit
minority faculty, citing three recent
offers made to minority faculty,
which were ultimately declined. A
number of students speculated on
this unwillingness on the part of mi
nority faculty to join Stanford's law
school.
"We need to determine what it is
that's going on here," said Xavier
Gutierrez, a second-year law student.
"Faculty members are committed to
diversity, but we need to start looking
at concrete ways of fostering this di
versity."

Gutierrez' sentiments were echoed
by several students, who pointed out
that Mabry's resignation seems to be
part of a "disturbing pattern" of the
law school losing most of its minority
scholars to other institutions.
"Almost every year, we're seeing
people of color leave the law school,"
said Day.
Brest felt that the individual cases
of minority faculty departures were
due to personal reasons and not in
dicative of an uncomfortable atmos
phere within the law school.
"We have lost very valuable facul
ty — white, black, and Latino — over
the past few years. There is no racial
pattern," said Brest. "Minority facul

ty who have left over the years often
had other offers or personal issues
causing them to leave.
Means for addressing these issues
have been considered by the Com
mittee for Diversified Faculty, a stu
dent group that was formed about 10
years ago to promote diversity at the
law school. It will meet next week to
discuss the matter further, taking into
account possible solutions raised at
yesterday's meeting.
"Minority professors need to be
told, 'you are an extremely integral
part of our institution'," Gutierrez
said. "We are a small community, so
when we lose a member, it really hits
home."
