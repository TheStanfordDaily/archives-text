Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) lost much more than two
conference matches this weekend.
'•Sophomore middle blocker
Dan Zhang exited the weekend's
second match with an injury to his
knee, which required stitches. His
condition is probable for this
weekend's games.
K But. that wasn't even the tip of
the iceberg.
After the Cardinal's Saturday
night loss to the Trojans, Stanford
junior Ail-American outside hit
ter Andy Witt informed Cardinal
head coach Ruben Nieves that he
was leaving the team, citing per
sonal reasons.
A lengthy team meeting upon
returning to Stanford did not af
fect Witt's decision.
.- "I was very surprised by his de
cision." said senior outside hitter
Patrick Klein. "1 had known Andy
was unhappy, but was surprised by
hixS drastic step."
Witt declined comment.
• The Cardinal will be losing one
of its most experienced players.
Witt was a member of the 1997
NCAA championship team that
defeated UCLA in a scintillating
live-game match against UCLA.
In that match, the then-freshman
collected 19 kills and 17 digs to aid
the Cardinal victory. Last season.
Witt lead the team in kills (487)
aijd also earned the highest Stan
ford hitting percentage (.362).
This season, Witt surpassed the
I,(XK) career kill mark during the
Cardinal's match against Hawaii
at home.
When Stanford takes on Cal
State-Northridge at Burnham
Pavilion on Friday, the Cardinal
will have its first test of its ability
to adapt to competition without
Witt.
"Whenever you deal with ad
versity," Nieves said, "there are a
couple of possible scenarios. A
team can fall apart and crumble or
it can become stronger and closer
for having dealt with it. Hopeful
ly, this team will choose option
number two."
On- and off-court perfor
mances will have to be increased
to maintain team intensity.
