# Pitchers give Stanford win
## 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
On a chilly night at Sunken Diamond, most of the
few fans in attendance wanted to get home quickly.
Behind the stellar work of four pitchers, No. 10 Stan
ford (4-3) complied, quickly dismissing Saint Mary's 5-
0.
The game was never a blowout and the Cardinal did
not look overpowering offensively. Starting pitcher
Jason Young and a trio of relievers, however, allowed
only four hits, assuring the Gaels (0-5) would never
mount a significant challenge.
Junior catcher Damien Alvarado again provided the
offensive spark for the Cardinal, going 1 for 2 with two
crucial RBIs. Alvarado is now hitting .381 and has seven
RBIs in the last two games.

■ Yesterday: No. 10 Stanford (4-3) 5, St. Mary's (0-5) 0.

Young, a sophomore right-hander, struck out nine
and allowed only three hits in six strong innings.
"Young was outstanding." Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said. "He had a good curveball and located
his fastball real well."
Marquess has made Young the early No. 1 starter for
the Cardinal, but his inexperience has shown through at
times, especially during last Friday's 8-0 loss at Fuller
ton.
"At Fullerton I struggled to throw strikes," Young
said. "That's what 1 concentrated on tonight. I'm just
trying to get experience."
When Young is finding the plate with his fastball, his
sweeping curveball is especially effective. Against right
handed batters, Young throws an almost unhittable
curve that starts towards the body and then dives, cut
ting across the inside corner.
"As long as I'm playing, the curveball will be my out
pitch." he said.
Senior lefthander Tony Cogan continued his domi
nance out of the bullpen, closing the game in the ninth
inning on only seven pitches.
As a long reliever and closer. Cogan has looked
sharp and consistent. Opposing batters are hitting only
.125 against Cogan, who has 15 strikeouts and a 0.83
ERA in 12 innings.
"All good teams have to have a good guy out of the
pen," Marquess said. "He's pitching real well and he's
got confidence. He's a big asset to our team."
After Young was pulled with a high pitch count,
freshmen Brian Sager and Mike Wodnicki followed him
to the mound for an inning each.

Sager, a hard-throwing right-hander, made his third
short appearance for the Cardinal this season. He has
struggled with his control at times, walking in a run in
two separate games. However, Sager was able to find
the plate last night, recording two quick strikeouts and a
fly-out to center field to end the inning.
Wodnicki, a right-hander as well,gave Stanford a
solid inning of work.
"The best thing was that we only had to use them an
inning a piece," Marquess said. "So, we'll have all of
them ready Saturday and Sunday."
This is important for the Cardinal as it has relied on
its deep bullpen, full of freshmen, to get the team
through the middle innings. Mike Gosling, who has now
moyed to a starting role; Dan Rich; Sager; J.D. Willcox
and Wodnicki have all helped out in their first year.
"Our freshmen have to step up this year," Young
said. "It's a big change from high school, but they have
impressed me so far."
