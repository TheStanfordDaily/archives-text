# Stanford faces another Bruin showdown
## 
### Will Felmming Staff writer 
Everybody hates to lose.
So it is understandable that the sixth

ranked Stanford men's basketball team may
still be feeling the pain of last Saturday's 70-
59 home loss to Connecticut.
Check that —it belter be upset about that
loss, considering its long-term implications,

and it had better learn from the mistakes
that killed the Cardinal's chances to make an
statement to the nation.
But more importantly, Stanford had bet
ter get over it. Right now.
Because tonight the No. 9 UCLA Bruins
come to Maples Pavilion looking to cut into
the Cardinal's two-game Pacific 10 Confer
ence lead.
A second straight home loss would be
very damaging to Stanford's hopes for a
first-ever Pac-10 title, as it would bring both
UCLA and Arizona to within one game of
the lead.
Another loss at Maples would also end
any and all chance the Cardinal (19-4, 9-1
Pac-10) has at a No. 1 seed in next month's
NCAA Tournament.
In other words, this is a gut check.
Especially considering that this UCLA
team (17-5, 8-3) is loaded with young talent
and extremely capable of pulling off the
upset.
This Bruins team is inexperienced, which
could be the perfect medicine for the veter
an Cardinal.

MEN'S BASKETBALL ~
■ Today: No. 6 Stanford (19-4 overall, 9-1 Pac
-10 Conference) vs. No. 9 UCLA (17-5,8-3)7:30
p.m. Maples Pavillion.

But UCLA is also quick, athletic and ag
gressive. Which could be the perfect poison
for Stanford, since that is exactly the de
scription of all four teams that have beaten
the Cardinal this season.
The strategy for the Bruins — and every
single one of Stanford's opponents that is in
its right mind, for that matter — will be sim
ple: press, press, press.
The Cardinal had a great deal of difficul
ty with UConn's full-court pressure (and
North Carolina's, and Maryland's, and Ari
zona's).
If Stanford can control the tempo of the
game and turn it in to a half-court battle,
UCLA's strategy will also be quite simple:
foul, foul, foul.
The Cardinal made just 12 of 24 free
throws against Connecticut and has strug
gled from the charity stripe all season long.
Fortunately, the Cardinal seems to be aware
of the urgency of tonight's game.
"We are obviously disappointed [with

losing to UConn]," said Stanford point
guard Arthur Lee after Saturday's game.
"But we have to move on. UCLA is a great
team and we will have to he ready for them
on Thursday."
Getting ready for the Bruins, however,
may be easier said than done, primarily be
cause of recent alterations to UCLA's star
ing lineup.
Freshman forward Jaron Rush was
benched in the Bruins' 85-67 win against
Oregon State Sunday, after being thrown
out of practice the day before for a lack of
focus.
Jerome Moiso, also a freshman, played
just 14 minutes against the Beavers, while
center Dan Gadzuric was only able to play
for 22 due to nagging tendinitis.
Despite the shakeup in the frontcourt.
UCLA has thrived on consistently explosive
play from its dynamic duo of sophomore
guards. Earl Watson and Baron Davis.
Speaking of backcourt production, the
Cardinal could desperately use some im
proved shooting from its senior tandem of
Lee and Kris Weems. The two combined to
make just 7 of 29 shots against UConn and
they seem to have lost their early-season
shooting touch.
Another key for Stanford will be whether
or not center Tim Young can stay out of foul
trouble and remain on the floor for more
than a few minutes at a time. When on the
floor. Young provides an invaluable defen
sive presence in the paint and a safety valve
on offense.
Stanford was in an eerily similar situation
a year ago, coming off a loss to UConn and
heading down the stretch in the Pac-10. The
Cardinal rebounded in brilliant fashion,
making a run to the Final Four before falling
to Kentucky in the national semifinals.
But in order to match that effort, Stan
ford will need every single player to step it
up —including the Sixth Man, which has a
history of slacking off after big losses.
Case in point: after losing a highly-antici
pated matchup with Arizona at home last
season, there was a noticeable fallout in stu
dent attendance at the next game against
Arizona State. The result was a second
straight home loss.
That kind of effort — from the Stanford
players and students —would be an absolute
disaster.
