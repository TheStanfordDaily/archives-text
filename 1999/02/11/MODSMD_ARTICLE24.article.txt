# Swimmers to take on improved Cal
## Hyman and Fox are expected to shut down Bears' versatile Chiang 
### Chad Morse Contributing writer 
Note to the clever folks who
coined such terms as Big Game, Big
Splash, and Big Sing: It's time to light
the midnight oil once again and put
those thinking caps back on — anoth
er Stanford-Cal rivalry has finally
sprouted in the chlorinated waters of
Berkeley's Spieker Aquatics Com
plex.
The No. 4 Stanford women's

swimming and diving teams will
make the short trek north Saturday
for a 1 p.m. meet to face a Berkeley
squad that has made vast improve
ments in past years.
After enjoying a decade of success
in the 1980s, the Berkeley swim pro
gram has struggled in the c X)s. A team
that once placed consistently in the
Top 5 at the NCAA Championships
has finished as high as 28th in the past
few years.
This season, however, the Bears

have proved that they are back
amongst the elite. With a decisive vic
tory over No. 5 USC a few weeks ago,
Cal put pressure on the Cardinal to
match the feat. Stanford rose to the
challenge and toppled the Trojans,
but the outcome of the meet came
down to the final events.
Now. the Bears have a more direct
challenge for Stanford. Behind star
senior Marylvn Chiang, Cal comes
into this Saturday's meet ranked sixth
in the nation.

"After they beat USC, we knew
that Cal would be tough to beat," said
Stanford freshman Sylvia Bereknyei.
Chiang, an extremely versatile
swimmer, will pose a major threat to
the Cardinal. An automatic NCAA
qualifier in the l(X)-yard backstroke
and the 1 (K)-yard butterfly, she also
has posted NCAA consideration
times in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle
events, the 200-yard backstroke, and
the 2(X)- and 400-yard individual
medlev events.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Friday: No. 4 Stanford (8-2) at No.
6 California (11-2) 1 p.m. Spieker
Aquatics Center.

Assuming that Chiang competes
in the butterfly and backstroke
events, she will likely face up against
some of Stanford's finest. In the but
terfly events. Misty Hyman, Shelly
Ripple, Jessica Amey and Allison
Fealey are the most likely Cardinal
candidates to race with Chiang.
Hyman and Ripple should have an
edge on Chiang in the 2(X), but Amey
and Fealey will have their work cut
out for them in the 1 (K).
In the backstroke events, the Car
dinal will most likely be led by junior
Catherine Fox. Hyman, Ripple, and
senior co-captain Chantal Rawn. A
matchup between Fox and Chiang
would pit a former NCAA 100-yard
backstroke champion (Fox) with a
former runner-up (Chiang). Not as
dominant in the 2(X), Hyman and
Ripple once again have the advan
tage over Chiang.
The Bears have several other au
tomatic qualifiers on the team be
sides Chiang. An incredibly strong

butterfly team, Cal's lineup includes
juniors Waen Minpraphal and Amy
Simpson and freshman Joscelin Yeo.
Simpson and Yeo have achieved the
KM) cut, while Minpraphal has quali
fied in the 200.
California senior Elli Overton will
provide the Bears 1 strength in the IM
events. A school record holder in the
200- and 4(X)-yard IM, she placed sec
ond in the 200 IM and the 200 fly at
last year's NCAAs.
A number of Stanford swimmers
could match up against Overton. Ju
nior Gabrielle Rose has been swim
ming extremely well in the 200 IM,
and freshmen Jessica Foschi and Rip
ple should present a challenge to
Overton in the 400 IM.
In the sprint freestyle events, the
Bears have Chiang along with sopho
more Adrienne Mattos. Cal's school
record holder in the 50-yard freestyle,
Mattos also adds a great deal to the
Bears' relay teams. Mattos and Chi
ang will be met by Stanford's Siobhan
Cropper, Emily Smith, Sylvia
Bereknyei and Fox. Fox, a former
NCAA champion in the 50, could
edge out the field with her unique un
derwater start and turn techniques.
The Cardinal divers will not meet
much opposition in Berkeley. The
Bears have only three active divers
on their squad. Amy Hlavaz, the only
Cal diver with varsity experience, has
been plagued by soldier problems
throughout her college career. Stan
ford is coming off a relatively success
ful performance in Texas, where se
nior Christina Zenorini and sopho
more Kim Powers competed neck
and neck with Southern Methodist's
Jenny Lingamfelter, one of top divers
in the nation.
