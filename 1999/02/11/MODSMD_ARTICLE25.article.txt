# Wrestlers on the road to the end
## Bakersfield and Fullerton prove formidable challenges 
### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
This weekend holds great
weight for the Stanford wrestling
team as it enters the final two
weeks of training before the Pacific
10 Conference Championships
held at home Feb. 27-28. This is the
final chance to fine tune any prob
lems and step up the intensity level
needed for the season finale.
The Cardinal's final step on the
road to the Pac-10 championships
runs through No. 14 Cal State Bak
ersfield tomorrow and Cal State
Fullerton Saturday in the final dual
meets of the season. Stanford (4-5)
is looking to go over .500 against
Titans (0-6-1) and the heavily fa
vored Roadrunners (10-5-1).
"We are a lot better than our
record shows, " said senior captain
Beau Weiner (157). "Most of our
losses came down to the last point
or we would lose in overtime."
Weiner leads the team with 20
wins and is looking to continue his
winning ways this weekend, but he
might be hampered by a shoulder
injury suffered last weekend. It is

not definite if Weiner will be able
to wrestle.
"My shoulder has been hurting
a little lately," Weiner said. "If I do
not go this weekend, I will get
healthy and be ready for Pac-10's."

'This weekend will be very
important for us. Each
starter has specific things
to work on before Pac-10's.'

Stanford will face one of the
toughest opponent in Cal State
Bakersfield. The Roadrunners
have faced some of the toughest
competition in the nation — name
ly. No. 1 Oklahoma State, No. 7
Nebraska and No. 7 Arizona State.
Bakersfield were able to tie fellow
Pac-10 favorite Arizona, validating
its national ranking.
The Roadrunners are led bv se
nior Steve Neal (285), w ho is wide
ly considered to be the best
wrestler at any weight. He was an
All-American in 1997 and was the

1998 national champion. He is 33-0
on the year with 24 pins and is cur
rently ranked first in the nation. He
has a 72-match win streak and was
named the Outstanding Wrestler
at last weekend's Congressional
Cup at American University. Neal
will take on Stanford freshman
Andy Hunter in the toughest battle
of Hunter's short collegiate career.
Also leading the charge for the
Bakersfield is 12th-ranked junior
Moses Dell in (125) who is ranked
second in the Pac 10 and is a 1998
NCAA qualifier. He will battle Ju
nior Rudy Ruiz, who came away
with a third-place finish at the All-
California Invite last weekend and
has shown improvement and a
higher level of intensity as of late.
The Roadrunners also tout
13th-ranked Raphel Davis (197)
who will wrestle freshman Chuck
Fairbanks.
"This weekend will be very im
portant for us," said Stanford head
coach Chris Horpel. "Each starter
has specific things and problems
area to work on before Pac-10s."
The Cardinal get a partial break
when they clash with Cal State

Fullerton. The Titans have had a
dismal season, only managing one
tie against San Francisco Stale and
have proved why they belong in the
cellar of the Pac-10. Stanford de
stroyed the Titans 37-3 last season
and are looking for a repeat perfor
mance this season.

WRESTLING
■ Friday: Stanford at Cal State- Bak
ersfield
■ Saturday: Stanford at Cal State-
Fullerton.

The one highlight for the Titan's
is senior Joey Coughran (141), who
was an All-American last year and
is one of the favorites to win not
only the Pac-lOs, but the NCAA
tournament. He will take on fresh
man Kenji Arai, who struggled at
last weekend's tournament.
These two meets are important
for seeding in the Pac-10 tourna
ment and are the last tests for Stan
ford.
"Our team is going to surprise a
lot of people (at the Pac-lOs),"
Wei ne r said.
