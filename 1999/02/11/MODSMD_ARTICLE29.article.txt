# Classes go on line at public library
## Stanford-in-Palm Springs? 
### Sylvia Lin Contributing writer 
Stanford is one of several universi
ties participating in a program to give
residents of Palm Springs, Calif., the.
opportunity to take courses on line
from the public library there. This is
the first time Stanford has made
course content available through a
municipal government agency.
Opened to the public on Dec. 3,
IWK, the Palm Springs Library dis
played its array of technology in a
room known as the Palm Springs Vir
tual Library. The plan was first con
ceived by Henry Weiss, the city li
brarian of Palm Springs.
"This town has about 3.(XK) per
manent residents, but we don't have
a four-year college or university in
this area. We've got a small commu

nity college here, but nothing compa
rable to the likes of Palo Alto," Weiss
said.
By combining the best hardware
and software technology available
from joint participants such as 3Com,
Microsoft, Nortel and GTC, the vir
tual library has 12 elaborately de
signed workstations.
Each station is complete with
computers submerged under a glass
face, so that students can see the
room's 70-inch television screen; a
camera mounted on each desk that
can directly point to the student, en
abling students to ask questions dur
ing lectures; and equipment that al
lows students to interact with off-site
professors from universities even as
distant as MI T.
"I wanted to bring in the wave of
higher education," Weiss said.

Beginning in the summer, nearby
students and corporations will have
access to advanced Stanford courses
in computer science and engineering.
Weiss hopes to expand to more class
es in the future.
"I really think that this program is
a good idea. I worked at Lucent
Technologies this past summer, and
the courses available on line were re
ally beneficial. I'm glad Stanford has
decided to do this." sophomore Jeff
Wang said.
Michael Koenig, the professional
education manager who is responsi
ble for organizing the courses for this
program, expresses high hopes.
"They're the first and only library to
be a member of the Stanford Infor
mational Technology Network. We
can now bring information to the
market quicker."
