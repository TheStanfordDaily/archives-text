# Wais 'optimistic' on director issue
## Students ask for full-time staffing at LGBCC, Women's Center 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
As University officials continue
to crunch numbers for next year's
budget, students have reason to be
hopeful that included in those fig
ures will be funding for a full-time di
rector at both the Women's Center
and the Lesbian. (lay and Bisexual
Community Center.

In a meeting held last Friday ai
the Women's Center, about a dozen
students received an update from
Jean of Students Marc Wais and
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves on the progress of budget
discussions regarding increasing the
level of permanent staffing at both
centers.
"I'm very optimistic. ... I con
veyed that optimism to students,"

Wais said. He declined to give details
regarding any new staffing plans and
emphasized that the budget is still
pending approval.
"That's why there hasn't been a
final announcement." he ■ I.
"No assurances were made." said
sophomore Jill DiGiovanni. who at
tended the meeting and called it
"mostly pretty vague."
"1 think both Dean Wais and

Morris Graves were very careful not
to make promises," said Sonia Das.
Community Outreach Intern at the
Women's Center.
The issue of staffing at both cen
ters has long been one of intense de
bate between students and adminis
trators. Throughout the years stu
dents have tried to convince the

University of the necessity of perma
nent staffing for the centers, while ad
ministrators have cited a lack of fund
ing as the stumbling block to hiring
full-time employees.
11 was only in 1997 that officials ap
proved the hiring of Fabienne
Macphail as the first ever part-time
director of the Women's Center.
Students have requested funding
for a full-time position directorship at
the Women's Center.
"The need [for a full-time direc
tor] is tremendous," said Macphail.
"One person can't handle this."
The LGBCC was granted funding
for a half-time director last spring.
Prior to that, it had no permanent di
rector.
After a nationwide search, Gwen
dolyn Dean was hired to take the
helm of the center this year. But she
left in November after working only
three months, accepting a similar,
full-time position at Cornell Univer
sity.
Following her abrupt resignation,
students renewed their efforts to gain
a full-time director for the LGBCC.
More than .SO students attended a
meeting held in December with Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya, Wais and Graves. At the
meeting students expressed their

wishes for a full-time director, and of
ficials agreed to look over the budget.
"I think the whole thing was really
catalyzed by Dean leaving," said se
nior Cathy Rion, who also attended
Friday's meeting. "It was unfortu
nate, but a lot of good has come of it.
The Women's Center is sort of riding
on the movement of the LGBCC."
Students involved with the push
for a full-time director for the
LGBCC have mentioned the possi
bility of organized protest should
their request be denied. But at the
Women's Center "most people ...
accept the current level of funding,"
according to Rion.
Das said Friday's meeting was
held in part to "give [students] moti
vation to wait" before engaging in
any sort of organized protest.
"They think it would be best if stu
dent activity is kept at a minimum to
reduce a lot of the politics," Das said.
"My personal opinion is that
protest is not the way to go," said
Nana 1 lowton, interim director of the
LGBCC. "The University adminis
tration is trying hard to respond to the
needs of the Women's Center and the
LGBCC"
The budget has already been re
viewed by Wais and Montoya, and.
has been submitted for approval to
Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Wais has said a public announce
ment will be made before the end of
the month.
