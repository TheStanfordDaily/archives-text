# Dean's office sponsors award
## Wais seeks groups, individuals improving student life 
### Jane Morril Contributing writer 
The Dean of Students' Office has
set up a new award designed to rec
ognize students and groups that have
showed outstanding achievement in
improving the quality of student life
on campus. The awards will be pre
sented at a ceremony in the spring.
The idea for the award was con
ceived by Dean of Students Marc
Wais and colleagues, who are work
ing closely with the ASSU to prepare
for the event.
"In looking at how Stanford rec
ognizes its students we realized we
didn't really have a campus-wide
achievement ceremony." Wais said.
"The ceremony is unique in that we'll
be recognizing both individual stu
dents and student organizations."
There will be one individual

award and 10 group awards, one in
each of a set of categories.
Groups interested in the award
can nominate themselves based on a
singular achievement. The 10 cate
gories in which awards will be given
are: academic, athletic/recreational,
career / pre-professional, community
service, creative arts, ethnic/cultur
al. fraternity / sorority, health / coun
seling, media/publications and reli
gious/philosophical. The criterion
for nomination is a unique contribu
tion or achievement that has en
riched student life and that occurred
between March 30, 1998 and March
19.1999.
Individuals may not nominate
themselves but rather must be nomi
nated by a fellow student or faculty
member. The individual's contribu
tion must also have occurred be
tween the specified dates for the

group award.
There are 521 campus organiza
tions eligible for the group awards,
and virtually all undergraduates are
eligible to receive the individual
award. Graduate students can partic
ipate in the group awards but are not
eligible to receive an individual
award.
The event will take place on May
12. with a dinner preceding the
awards ceremony. Two large plaques
will be displayed in Tresidder Memo
rial Union to recognize both the indi
vidual and group achievements. This
year's ceremony is the first of what
planners hope will become an annual
event on campus.
The selection committee will con
sist of both students and staff. "From
day one, students have been involved
in the planning and development of
the process," said Wais.
