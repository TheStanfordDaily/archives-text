/; he sleeps with a blow-up doll. She dances with imaginary
/'"Yy babies. We love her, we hate her, we devote Monday night
television to her. I myself became addicted to the show

this slimmer, and since then watching "Ally McBeaT has

become a Monday night ritual for me and my roommates.
"McBeaT and its star, Calista Flockhart, have sparked

controversy since the show's debut last year. Last summer,
the cover of "Time" featured Flockhart's face alongside
feminist leaders such as Gloria Steinem, proclaiming her
character as the new face of feminism.
The article claimed that Ally presents today's woman as
being obsessed with her looks, lonely in her career and
aching for a husband and kids. True, Ally is lonely and inse

cure. Critics worry about her influence as a role model for
young women. But what girl would not want to be a hot

lawyer who wins every case and buys her expensive, ever-so-flat

tering suits from bebe?

Maybe Ally's priorities are a little out of order. Let's take a look. Her

first priority is finding a man. Beyond that? Getting over her ex-boyfriend.
Hemming her skirt up six inches. Thumbing her nose at other hot women.

Sometimes I watch the show and promise myself I am never going to watch again.

I mean, come on, what other show would have a plot line where Ally gets
stuck in a toilet bowl and drools over the firemen who come to res

cue her? And what about the episode where Ally wins a case for an

old woman who wants to be induced into a coma so she can live

I have to admit, I like the exaggerated world Ally lives in.

/ ,d perhaps because of her stuttering instability and vul
nerability, I also love Ally.

The world has become a place where girls are insecure
and for good reasons. Many women are afraid to admit that

the drive to be successful and beautiful does not necessarily
make us happy. Critics shun Ally because they are afraid of

becoming her. They see her as weak, as having the wrong pri
orities, as having those qualities we want to get rid of in our

selves.
But many fens will admit that what they love about Ally is her

weakness, and her strength in dealing with that weakness. Ally Mcßeal

deals with her life; she dances, she goes on. As do the rest of us.
