Impressionists in Winter:
Effets de Neige'
Yerba Buena Center
701 Mission Street
through May 2, $12
(415) 776-1999

After much negotiation, the
curators of the de Young
Museum of Fine Arts
arranged for the exhibition
to travel to California, only
to learn that their museum
was too seismically unsound
to qualify for the insurance

the valuable paintings required. So an exchange with
the Yerba Buena was effected: for the next three
months, Yerba Buena's up-to-the-moment exhib$f#|l
would be shown at the de Young, while its own spt&
would be occupied by "Impressionists in Winter: I ffets
de Neige."
The paintings represent another reversal: While tfae
Impressionists are best-known for their color-saturated
landscapes and still lifes, this exhibit gathers their more
austere, monochromatic works. Though Paris and its
environs are not known for snow, unusually icy weaA* <
er patterns prevailed over much of Western Hurope
from 1865 to 1894, the peak of Impressionism, fira
conditions allowed the painters ample opportunity t©
explore the subtle colorations achieved by the player'*
* light on frost, snowdrifts and ice floes. As a museum
placard notes, one does well to remember the painters'

technique of working en plein air. the freezing temper
atures in which the canvases were often composed
make the end products all the more admirable.
In Claude Monet's "Boulevard des Capucines"
(1873-4), the soft, heathered hues of tall trees contrast
with the sharply delineated, vibrant figures of
Parisiennes, smartly dressed in blacks and riavys. The
painting represents something of a watershed in the
history of Impresuoniwn. The piece was included in the
first showing of Impressionist works, which itself took
place on the Boulevard des Capucines in the studio of
photographer Caspar Nadar. Its reception was initially
negative. One critic dismissed Moneys depiction of the
pedestrians as so many "black tongue-lickings". Yet the
work conveys the tenor of Paris to modern eyes, inspir
ing one patron to comment "Paris hasn't really changed
all that much."
!|ln *Worta by the English painter Alfred Sisley are
another higtight, particularly "The Watering Place at
Marly With Hoarfrost" {1876). The painting brings out
the bluish cast sue fends snow, with a carefully balanced
composition of a village scene. "Snow Effect at
Argenteufl" (t874) is eq ua Hy remarkable, expertly cap
turing the effect of a shadow on snowThe picture is of
a snow bank beside a road; the bunk casts a long, dark
shadowoVet the snowfall to the right. The judicious use
of peaches and pinks enhances the warmth of the melt
ing snow.

Paul Gaugin, a bit out of place in this milieu, is nev
ertheless well-represented by such works as "The Seine
at the Pont d'l Ena, Snowy Weather" (1875) and
"Winter Landscape, Snow Effect" (1888). The latter
particularly straddles the line between Impressionism
and Syntheticism, combining the former's palette with
the bold, geometrical rendering of buildings. Works by
Camifle Pissarro, though abundant, are largely disap
pointing in their dreary portrayal of drab winter scenes.
The final grouping, a trio of Monets, might be the
exhibit's high point. The paintings each depict the same
$cene pf ice floes on the Seine, yet the chromatic varia
tions between the three make the arrangement wonder
fully compelling. The pastel radiance of "Floating Ice at
Bennecount" (1893) is flanked by its etiolated twins
"Morning Haze" (1894) and "Ice Floes" (1893). But
-twins'' goes too far, though monochromatic both, the
latter has a silvery palette, while the other is a study in
browns. As each painting is owned by a different muse
um, the juxtaposition here is especially gratifying.
The "Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige" is at
Yerba Buena's 701 Mission Street Gallery until May 2.
The ihuseum is open Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday
from 10 to 6; Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 10
to 8. Admission is $12. Reservations are recommended
for the weekends; call (415)776-1999.
