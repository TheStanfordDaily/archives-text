# SONDHEIM MUSICAL MARRIES CHARM AND HUMOR
## 'Company' at the Saratoga Drama Group

y 1) / > hile it's very different from "Into the Woods" or "Sweeney Todd," there is
J?f / simply no such thing as a typical Stephen Sondheim musical. Sondheim's
"Company" is a unique Broadway experience. The brilliant musician and
lyricist first presented "Company" in 1971, and it went on to win the 1971 Tony Award
for Best Musical. Filled with toe-tapping tunes and charm, "Company" nevertheless
goes against the stereotype of the corny Broadway show. Don't expect sappy love
scenes or dramatic battles in the Saratoga Drama Group's production. It is simply the
story of five married couples, three single females and a lone bachelor.
The lone bachelor, adorably portrayed by Joe Colleti, is constantly barraged by his
five married-couple friends about the fact that he is in his mid-thirties and not yet
married. During the show, Robert carefully observes each couple. In between drags of
marijuana, homosexual encounters and casual girlfriends, he notices the pros and
cons of his friends' marriages.
The debate on marriage's legitimacy as an institution is as relevant today as it was
in 1971. One could almost feel the audience squirm as uncomfortable truths about

marriage were exposed and breathe sighs of relief when pro-marriage truths were
revealed. When after his 37th birthday Robert still has not found a suitable wife, we
begin to wonder if he ever will.
The Saratoga Drama Group presents a very nice production of "Company." The
theater is small and quaint, with only a two-person orchestra. The sets are sparse and
the choreography is limited and sometimes a wee bit corny. Still, it's obvious that the
group can rely on solid voices to carry its productions. The singing in "Company" is
very good, with Colletti (Robert) providing a strong vocal performance to go along
with his wonderful acting and boyish smile. The whole cast is very talented with nary
a major weakness to report.
If you're expecting a Broadway-quality show, well, go to New York. But if you want
some solid community theater, look no further than Saratoga. And frankly, the low
key, family-like atmosphere of community theater often creates a more pleasant expe
rience than can be found in stuffy Broadway shows.
