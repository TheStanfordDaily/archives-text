## UNWOUND Live at the Great American Music Hall 
### 
112 Beck is postmodern, then
(Y Unwould is high modernism.
Seeing them in concert is a
dark ride. I had fleeting impressions on
many things during their show last
Friday at the Great American Music
Hall. One thing 1 kept thinking of was
what Marcel Proust wrote about music:
"a few great artists who do us the service
of showing us what richness, what varity
lies hidden, unknown to us, in that vast,
unfathomed and forbidding night of our
soul which we take to be an impenetra
ble void."
That said, this is an amazing band to
see live. I was not terribly familiar with
it. A friend of mine lent me a few of the
band's compact discs a couple weeks
before the show, but they didn't really
sink in. But the band's dense, dark per
formance was the most amazing I've
seen in quite a long time. In terms of
sound, Unwound does follow from a
punk tradition, but it has made the punk
sound something far more sinister and
emotional then it has ever been before.
Although Justin Trooper, the guitarist
and primary singer, is the star of the
show, the rhythm section of Vern
Rumsey (bass) and Sara Lund (drums) is
certainly distinctive, rolling and explod
ing, respectively. They provide a rocking,
but unifying and intricate, backdrop to
the dense drama of Justin's vocals and

guitar.
The songs are rather diverse, varying
from the frustrated riffing and pop-rock
structures of "Laugh Track" and "Meet
the Plastics," to the more expansive and
complex "Lifetime Achievement Award,"
with which they opened and"For Your
Entertainment," the closer. The latter
contained all that is best about this
band. It began with a strummy, trance
like intro, barely hinting at the gorgeous
tidal wave about to break: A solitary
high-pitched whine of guitar that goes
down a bit, twinning itself into a
moment of mellow calm before fading
to oblivion. Then comes the grungy
verse, with Justin's lips curling into a
half-sneer, quieting again before the rep
etition of the tidal wave, this time with
his vocals riding across the guitar line. It
was a stunning performance of a great
song. "For Your Entertainment" was per
fect to end the set with, but unfortunate
ly there was no encore. It was strange to
see all the indie scenesters, who have
such exquisitely detached poses at the
beginning of the night, whining for just
one more song. You could not blame
them, for Unwound is a band that really
does connect with its audience.
At certain points in the set, I felt
utterly alone, or as Justin sang, "I don't
feel anything." The mood he conveys,
though, is not the desolately ironic
