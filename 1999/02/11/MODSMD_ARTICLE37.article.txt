# THE 						MR. T EXPERIENCE
## Live in Palo Alto 
### 
n Wednesday, Feb. 3, The Mr. T Experience opened up for Dick Dale at the Edge,
112 / so one can imagine the eclectic mixture of people in attendance at the all-ages
Palo Alto show. In fact, "all-ages" took on new meaning as multitudes of middle
aged folk came out to see a master surf-rock guitarist in action, and most were clueless
to the Bay Area pop punk of MTX. In lead-vocalist / guitarist Dr. Frank, bassist / back
up vocalist Joel and drummer Jym, this trio — signed to Lookout Records — has been
doing its thing since 1986. Despite several line-up and record label changes through the
years, the music the group's putting out still defines the harmony-laden punk rock that
its been playing with ease for so long, and it sounds as good as ever,
MTX played through a 45-minute set that included a lot of material off of its last two
full-length albums, "Love Is Dead" and "Revenge Is Sweet and So Are You." Songs such as
"Thank You (For Not Being One of Them)" and "Here She Comes" were representative of
much of the performance: pop-punk numbers about various girls and the problems that
come with them. Dr. Frank began many of the songs by saying, "Here's a song about a girl,
hit it Jym!" and indeed, it almost seems like all of MTX's songs are about girl troubles.
There is a certain appeal to the lyrics, though, and regardless of the repetitive subject mat
ter, seeing the band rip through these songs live demonstrates why kids go to punk shows
in the first place. Choreographed simultaneous guitar movements and screaming groupies
aside, MTX is musically gifted, and it lets its talent shine in a live atmosphere.
The crowd, however, may not have been as into the music as the band is used to, hav
ing headlined on world tours from Europe to Japan. The old people just stood around,
while a small group of younger fans formed a dancing coalition at the front of the stage.
The pogo-ing reached it's peak during "Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba," and there was audience recog
nition of MTX's MTV single "And I Will Be With You." But for the most part, there was
a lack of the energy typical at a punk rock show in a small venue. Maybe the security
guards roaming the crowd and climbing up on the go-go cages to the right of the stage
had something to do with it, because after all, we're talking about the Edge and Palo Alto
here. It ain't no Gilman.
MTX covered the '80s song "Crash," a nice touch, and Dr. Frank also played two solo
songs prepping the audience for his upcoming solo album and tour in April. And,
although most of the songs were newer material, there were some older tunes thrown in
as well. The most notable was MTX's own version of the "Spiderman" theme song,
which closed out the set. Admittedly, it wasn't the longest performance, or even one of
their best, but considering the circumstances, The Mr. T Experience showed to even a
crowd of Dick Dale fans how rock 'n' roll should be played.
