# CURTIS MAYFIELD
## 'Roots' & 'Gospel' 
### 
his month, Rhino records re
releases two albums, "Roots" and
"Gospel," by soul legend Curtis
Mayfield, best known for his 1972 soundtrack
for the movie "Superfly."
Mayfield released his second solo album
"Roots" in 1971, which was a transition point
in his career. Back in the '60s, Mayfield spent
his time as a producer, singer and songwriter
with the Impressions, an R&B group that
released such hits as "Gypsy Woman," "I'm So
Proud," "Fool For

Roots/Gospel
.
Curtis Mayfield
'

You" and "Woman's
Got Soul." The
,
Impressions sang
mostly love songs
with minimal social
commentary and a

penchant for radio play. As his days with the
Impressions ended in 1970, Mayfield got bold
er and funkier instrumentally, and lyrically
more socially conscious. The seven tracks on
"Roots" are marked by heavy bass-lines, funky
electric wah-wah guitar, rambling African
drum percussion, full horn-blaring orchestra
tion, and longer songs with reflective instru
mental breaks. Mayfield also expands the
scope of his lyrics with politically-conscious
tracks, such as the Vietnam-inspired "We Got
To Have Peace," "Underground" and the didac
tic black-pride anthem "Beautiful Brother of
Mine."
According to the album's liner notes, "We
Got To Have Peace" remains as one of

Mayfield's favorites, and he has performed it
on military bases around the world. One sim
ple refrain conveys the basic message of the
song: "And the soldiers who are dead and gone
/ If only we could bring back one / He'd say,
'We've got to have peace.' " On "Under
ground," Mayfield begins with a cryptic mono
logue stressing the environmental pollution
and racism that has ruined us and will one day
force us "underground." You can't help but
really dig this track as the head-bobbing funk
mirrors the message. Other tracks on the
album, such as the opening song "Get Down,"
address more traditional themes. The song
begins and ends with heavy breathing and
starts out with the command "Get down baby,
to the funky, funky grooves." The album's sec
ond track, "Keep On Keeping On," is some
thing for the children. Mayfield calls it a song
containing "life's story —the hopefulness...
the sweetness — and the bottom line to keep
on keeping on." "Now Your Gone" is the most
unique track on the album. It sounds like a tra
ditional blues track, but Mayfield's voice lacks
the growling melancholy necessary to make it
convincing. Since Mayfield's general theme is
that the world lacks love, "Love To Keep You In
My Mind" is an appropriate end to the album.
This love song is a beautifully orchestrated
track and a nice mellow-out after the fast
paced funk characteristic of the album.
"Gospel," a compilation of 13 gospel tracks
released by Mayfield, either solo or while with
the Impressions, is a complete change of pace

from "Roots." Throughout his career, Mayfield
released gospel tracks because his personal
introduction to music came from the church,
and he saw gospel as the foundation of all
black music.
The tracks on "Gospel" are predominantly
slow, reflective and reverent. The tracks
"Amen," "People Get Ready," "Wherever You
Leadeth Me," "You Ought To Be In Heaven,"
"Meeting Over Yonder" and "Keep On
Pushing" were all released while Mayfield was
with the Impressions. These songs are a mix
ture of the church sound and the Motown
sound.
Mayfield's solo tracks, "Jesus," "A Prayer,"
"Something To Believe In," "Love To The
People,""We Got To Have Peace,""When We're
Alone" and "It's All Right /Amen (Live)" are
again more reflective, characterized by daring
lyrics, rambling soulful instrumentals and
Mayfield's distinctive tenor and falsetto. The
most notable track on the album is "Jesus,"
which features Mayfield reflecting on Jesus as a
person and emphasizing that people on earth
should model their lives after his.
Both "Gospel" and "Roots" offer a wonder
ful sampling of the musical career of one of the
most influential figures in '70s funk-soul. For a
more nostalgic look at '70s pop culture, I rec
ommend "Superfly," but for the soulful essence
of Mayfield, "Roots" and "Gospel" are as good
as it gets.
