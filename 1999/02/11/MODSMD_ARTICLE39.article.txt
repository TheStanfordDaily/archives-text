# COVER STORY
## AN INTERVIEW WITH V .VALE rebel publisher of REsearch/Vsearch publications 
### 
Interview by Wendy Yao, transcribed with help from Simon Martinez

rVale is an independent publisher from
San Francisco who has been studying
counter-culture for the past 25 years.
Back in the late '70s, he started the early punk
magazine, "Search & Destroy," which is now
deemed by many as "the authoritative guide to
punk culture." All of his books focus on providing
primary sources of information, mainly in the
interview format. Since then, he has conducted
thousands of interviews with a wide variety of
people, including bell hooks, William S.
Burroughs, Jello Biafra, Robert Moog, J.G.
Ballard and pretty much everyone involved in the
early punk scene. Last week, Intermission got the
chance to talk to him about his experiences grow
ing up in San Francisco and running his publish
ing company.
INT: When you were doing things back in the
"Search and Destroy" days [the '70s], were you
one of the only Asians?
VV: You bet! [laughter] God, there were so
few Asians back in the early punk scene. There
was me; I think I was the only one for a while ...
There was this Linda Nakamura, but she didn't
come in until late '78, early '79. But 1 was there
in '76, the fall ... I do think that for someone as
non-famous as me, I've had a tremendous
impact.
INT: Everyone knows your books —
VV: Well, they don't really know me behind
it. They don't even know I'm Asian, for example
... I'm actually a San Francisco native and my
first job that I had was working at City Lights
bookstore in San Francisco because I loved the
Beats, the Beatniks, and I loved to read, and I
particularly loved the Beat movement. I had
read all the books I could get my hands on —
especially like William S. Burroughs. Although
what I liked about Burroughs was not the
books he's famous for — the fiction like
"Naked Lunch" — what I loved about him was
one book called "The Job," which is a book of
interviews with him. And I also started collect
ing any interviews I could find.
INT: How old were you?
VV: Oh God, young. Much younger. 25 years

younger than I am now ... The point is that I
was lucky enough to score the job at City Lights
bookstore which many young writers had
dreamed of working for, and one advantage to
working there in the pre-computer days was
that you didn't have to work as hard. Seriously.
I could read all the media that was coming in,
in between ringing up books. And it was really
around *74, right after when I started, that I
discovered what was punk rock.
It was really starting to be public. I knew
about Patti Smith back then; 1 got my first book
from her. I knew about CBGB's, I knew some
thing was happening. And the only way you
could read about punk back then was in these
British rock music papers — New Music

Express, Sounds and Melody
Maker. In the summer of '75,
there was a huge centerfold
that I cut out and put on my
living room that was about
the emerging punk scene in
New York — but they didn't
even know what to call it
then. They had Patti Smith,

The Ramones played
this teeny club... but I
knew that this was
the future...

Tom Verlaine, Television, the Ramones, Blondie
— all these people were each given a paragraph
in this article and I wanted so much to go to
New York but I had no money. And 1 was just
hoping that something like that would happen
in San Francisco, and it did — like the
Ramones played here in a teeny club where 15
people went, including me, of course.
INT: Were you a teenager then? .
VV: No, no, I was older. And the Ramones
played this teeny club where there were literal
ly 30 people each night, but 1 knew that this
was the future. As you know, punk was just a
reaction against this bloated dinosaur stadium
rock and the guitar gods like Led Zepellin, and
basically restored folk culture and folk music to
the people again, that's the way I looked at it.
When early punk started, it was such a revolt
against the moribund hippie culture, that
everyone was so creative at the beginning. No
one was just an audience person consuming or
buying a band t-shirt. There weren't any band
t-shirts then. You had to make your own punk
clothes. You had to cut them up and spray slo
gans on them and hand-make your own things.
And of course, everyone started trying to be in

a band. Because the Ramones made it look so
easy. Literally, there were people in a band a
week after they had picked up an instrument.
Like Will Shatter, picking up the bass. And of
course, everyone was making their own posters;
and a lot of the posters have been forgotten.
They had very shocking graphics, sometimes
from sex magazines — the kind of forbidden
things. It was really quite a grass roots cultural
revolt.
The iconic writers were different from the
hippie culture writers; we championed William
S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard, you know, hard
er core things. And for films, too, I remember
all the punks would go down to Market Street,
they had these theaters where for 99 cents you

could see three movies, with
mostly winos sleeping all day in
the theaters. That was where we
got our taste for B-movies, it was
in the 70's and that's why 10 years
later I came out with incredibly
strange films-it was the book
development of that idea, of
alternative cinema ...

Anyway the reason that I got the idea to pub
lish because I became so angry reading the few
mainstream articles there were about punk
rock. I said, "I'm going to publish and tell the
truth." And I was already a big fan of Claude
Levi-Strauss, who's a major French anthropolo
gist, father of structural anthropology, so 1
wanted to treat it like an anthropology project,
in other words, not make any assumptions
about the culture, and try and use a lot of what
I call "first-hand informants." So, that's why I
did the interview format.
INT: So you printed the direct dialogue?
VV: It's all source stuff — not a lot of edito
rializing by me. Also, the advantage of handling
a whole bunch of various viewpoints and their
words is that collectively everybody has a much
greater intelligence than any one person with a
limited point of view ...
Of course, as punk spread, there was a lot of
diverse development, and I chose to follow
what was called the Industrial Culture
Movement, which was focusing on making
noise, and found sounds, away from the tradi
tional guitar, bass, drums format ... trying to
explore doing things with tape recorders, and I
guess more abrasive, and using cut up sounds
from TV news, you know, critique of society ...
death imagery ... things that were forbidden at
the time. Although they're now as common as
toast and tabloid TV —
INT: Yeah, what do you think about that?
VV: Oh, of course whenever anything
becomes mainstream, I naturally react against
it. Actually, that was the credo of the "Sex
Pistols": an easy way to raise your intelligence
— ask, "is it against the status quo?" Anything;
I don't care what it is that's embraced by the
mainstream, 1 tend to react against it. Even then
in the "Industrial Culture Handbook," we were
one of the first in print to kind of objectively
probe serial killers and phenomena like that.
Really, no one was doing it back then. Still,
when it comes to the point over 10 years later
when you see frat boys start wearing Ted Bundy
t-shirts, well then, I'm out of there.
INT: So do you think that things completely
lose their meanings then (after they have
become mainstream]?
VV: Well, I think everyone has to go through
their own personal voyage of discovery, where
they learn about the really dark things that can
happen in life, because otherwise you're having
a cotton candy version to the way the world
works. But at the same time, we're going
through stages and developing, and I certainly,
I've read about 500 books about serial killers,
and really, I'm done with that. You have to
move on, and again it's like so mainstream now.
INT: Because there will probably be some
frat-boys reading this, if you want to explain
anything more about that...
VV: Well, it's just that we live in a culture
now in which everyone is trying to up the ante
in terms of grossing out; there's something
macho associated with trying to gross out your
friends, like "I can outgross-you out" or "I can
read about more gorey stuff than you." But it's
kind of a macho thing, I think. I don't think it's
a serious inner exploration — because we are
all tied together, I mean, the darkest things that
someone does, you might say we're all capable
of murder, in one sense or another. If the right
circumstance happened. There's always an
outer and inner component to all investigation,
and there's no such thing as objectivity.
Everything has a personal component to it;
that's one thing that the feminist movement
kind of alerted us to — the method of objectiv
ity. So I tried my best to give an accurate in
depth chronicling of I call the punk rock cul
tural insurrection. I thought it was like an
archetype for many subsequent generations to
make their own [culture], and the reason why I
think that in a way punk rock will never die is

because I look at it as entry level social rebel
lion for people in grade school and high school
with very little resources.
INT: So, do you think that stuff like punk
rock's viability is contingent —
VV: It's economics!
INT: — It has to be underground, because it
can always grow, but at a certain point if it
becomes a dominant thing, then it loses its
point.
VV: ... There's always going to be a new gen
eration coming up every six months, critiquing
everyone else that's come before them, and I
think that's a very necessary stage — I think
rebellion is a very necessary stage to go

through. I mean, at least chal
lenging what they used to call
the dominant paradigm or the
dominant cultural assump
tions and values of the time.
In any case, I think you always
have to do this constantly. You
have to refresh your standards
by which you evaluate any
thing and examining your

language — this is a very key thing. It was
funny, the last time I talked to Jello Biafra, lead
singer of the Dead Kennedys, we were talking
about the death of William Burroughs, and how
there had never been a San Francisco celebra
tion, which by the way I'm organizing, a memo
rial. And I was calling him to get him involved
as a speaker. This will be on April 23rd, by the
way, at the San Francisco Art Institute.
Anyway, we were talking about it and I said, I
hate this word, but I haven't gotten any sense of
closure over William's death, and this excited
Biafra's fury instantly: "Closure? That's this
yuppie corporate word bullshit. This is like
some word which corporate types use to try
and get you to buy more things." And he went
off on it. He said you don't get any closure
about anyone dying. He said, "My sister died
two years ago, and I will never get closure over
that." And you know, he's right. These words, all
the language has to be constantly reevaluated. I
had never really thought that way. But this is
just a small example.
INT: How did you start actually publishing
books? You were working at City Lights...
VV: I was working at City Lights and I asked
Allen Ginsberg for a hundred dollars, and he in
one minute wrote me a check. Then I took the
check to Lawrence Ferlinghetti and he also in
one minute wrote me another check for $100. I
got another $200 from another friend of mine
who happens to be a doctor, and that's all it
took to produce the first "Search and Destroy,"
and then I sort of kept going, but I never

thought I would ever make a living off it.
Although, I probably should have taken a
Stanford MBA class — it would have helped
me, I'm sure ... I would advise every rebel to
take one business class and accounting class,
definitely.
So basically I just developed themes that
were uncovered during the punk years ... The
main book that changed society was "Modern
Primitives," which more or less gave every pos
sible reason to get tattooing and doing body
piercing and modifications, and none of the
negatives, pretty much, and then we did "Angry
Women," which is still a favorite in college
classes, it's kind of an early activist, feminist
performance artist kind of text ... and then the
"Guide to Bodily Fluids," which is still a very
funny book.
One of our goals was to try to be anti-puri

tanical, you know, we live in a
very puritanical culture in
America, which regards the
body with disgust, and none of
our books dealt with dealing
with that ... I mean that's why
one of our best-selling books
was called "Freaks," it was deal
ing with people who used to be
circus freaks ... and Bob

Flanagan supermasochist, and just reclaiming
the body as your artistic canvas, as well as like,
a non-guilty source of all kinds of pleasure ...
But my newest book is on the Swing movement.
A lot of my punk rock friends of course were
horrified ... You have to remember that Swing
was not invented by white people in this cul
ture, it was an underground movement, invent
ed by black people in Harlem 10 years before
white people found out about it, in 1936.
... In a way there's never been so much
awareness, shared by so many people — but it's
sound bite-ish awareness, it's not really deep.
It's so superficial ... and as you know the num
ber of readers is declining every day ... and yet
that's how you get depth, it's by reading, and
thinking about things.

around *74, right after when I started, that I
discovered what was punk rock.
It was really starting to be public. I knew
about Patti Smith back then; 1 got my first book
from her. I knew about CBGB's, I knew some
thing was happening. And the only way you
could read about punk back then was in these
British rock music papers — New Music

Express, Sounds and Melody
Maker. In the summer of '75,
there was a huge centerfold
that I cut out and put on my
living room that was about
the emerging punk scene in
New York — but they didn't
even know what to call it
then. They had Patti Smith,

The Ramones played
this teeny club... but I
knew that this was
the future...

Tom Verlaine, Television, the Ramones, Blondie
— all these people were each given a paragraph
in this article and I wanted so much to go to
New York but I had no money. And 1 was just
hoping that something like that would happen
in San Francisco, and it did — like the
Ramones played here in a teeny club where 15
people went, including me, of course.
INT: Were you a teenager then? .
VV: No, no, I was older. And the Ramones
played this teeny club where there were literal
ly 30 people each night, but 1 knew that this
was the future. As you know, punk was just a
reaction against this bloated dinosaur stadium
rock and the guitar gods like Led Zepellin, and
basically restored folk culture and folk music to
the people again, that's the way I looked at it.
When early punk started, it was such a revolt
against the moribund hippie culture, that
everyone was so creative at the beginning. No
one was just an audience person consuming or
buying a band t-shirt. There weren't any band
t-shirts then. You had to make your own punk
clothes. You had to cut them up and spray slo
gans on them and hand-make your own things.
And of course, everyone started trying to be in

a band. Because the Ramones made it look so
easy. Literally, there were people in a band a
week after they had picked up an instrument.
Like Will Shatter, picking up the bass. And of
course, everyone was making their own posters;
and a lot of the posters have been forgotten.
They had very shocking graphics, sometimes
from sex magazines — the kind of forbidden
things. It was really quite a grass roots cultural
revolt.
The iconic writers were different from the
hippie culture writers; we championed William
S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard, you know, hard
er core things. And for films, too, I remember
all the punks would go down to Market Street,
they had these theaters where for 99 cents you

could see three movies, with
mostly winos sleeping all day in
the theaters. That was where we
got our taste for B-movies, it was
in the 70's and that's why 10 years
later I came out with incredibly
strange films-it was the book
development of that idea, of
alternative cinema ...

Anyway the reason that I got the idea to pub
lish because I became so angry reading the few
mainstream articles there were about punk
rock. I said, "I'm going to publish and tell the
truth." And I was already a big fan of Claude
Levi-Strauss, who's a major French anthropolo
gist, father of structural anthropology, so 1
wanted to treat it like an anthropology project,
in other words, not make any assumptions
about the culture, and try and use a lot of what
I call "first-hand informants." So, that's why I
did the interview format.
INT: So you printed the direct dialogue?
VV: It's all source stuff — not a lot of edito
rializing by me. Also, the advantage of handling
a whole bunch of various viewpoints and their
words is that collectively everybody has a much
greater intelligence than any one person with a
limited point of view ...
Of course, as punk spread, there was a lot of
diverse development, and I chose to follow
what was called the Industrial Culture
Movement, which was focusing on making
noise, and found sounds, away from the tradi
tional guitar, bass, drums format ... trying to
explore doing things with tape recorders, and I
guess more abrasive, and using cut up sounds
from TV news, you know, critique of society ...
death imagery ... things that were forbidden at
the time. Although they're now as common as
toast and tabloid TV —
INT: Yeah, what do you think about that?
VV: Oh, of course whenever anything
becomes mainstream, I naturally react against
it. Actually, that was the credo of the "Sex
Pistols": an easy way to raise your intelligence
— ask, "is it against the status quo?" Anything;
I don't care what it is that's embraced by the
mainstream, 1 tend to react against it. Even then
in the "Industrial Culture Handbook," we were
one of the first in print to kind of objectively
probe serial killers and phenomena like that.
Really, no one was doing it back then. Still,
when it comes to the point over 10 years later
when you see frat boys start wearing Ted Bundy
t-shirts, well then, I'm out of there.
INT: So do you think that things completely
lose their meanings then (after they have
become mainstream]?
VV: Well, I think everyone has to go through
their own personal voyage of discovery, where
they learn about the really dark things that can
happen in life, because otherwise you're having
a cotton candy version to the way the world
works. But at the same time, we're going
through stages and developing, and I certainly,
I've read about 500 books about serial killers,
and really, I'm done with that. You have to
move on, and again it's like so mainstream now.
INT: Because there will probably be some
frat-boys reading this, if you want to explain
anything more about that...
VV: Well, it's just that we live in a culture
now in which everyone is trying to up the ante
in terms of grossing out; there's something
macho associated with trying to gross out your
friends, like "I can outgross-you out" or "I can
read about more gorey stuff than you." But it's
kind of a macho thing, I think. I don't think it's
a serious inner exploration — because we are
all tied together, I mean, the darkest things that
someone does, you might say we're all capable
of murder, in one sense or another. If the right
circumstance happened. There's always an
outer and inner component to all investigation,
and there's no such thing as objectivity.
Everything has a personal component to it;
that's one thing that the feminist movement
kind of alerted us to — the method of objectiv
ity. So I tried my best to give an accurate in
depth chronicling of I call the punk rock cul
tural insurrection. I thought it was like an
archetype for many subsequent generations to
make their own [culture], and the reason why I
think that in a way punk rock will never die is

because I look at it as entry level social rebel
lion for people in grade school and high school
with very little resources.
INT: So, do you think that stuff like punk
rock's viability is contingent —
VV: It's economics!
INT: — It has to be underground, because it
can always grow, but at a certain point if it
becomes a dominant thing, then it loses its
point.
VV: ... There's always going to be a new gen
eration coming up every six months, critiquing
everyone else that's come before them, and I
think that's a very necessary stage — I think
rebellion is a very necessary stage to go

through. I mean, at least chal
lenging what they used to call
the dominant paradigm or the
dominant cultural assump
tions and values of the time.
In any case, I think you always
have to do this constantly. You
have to refresh your standards
by which you evaluate any
thing and examining your

language — this is a very key thing. It was
funny, the last time I talked to Jello Biafra, lead
singer of the Dead Kennedys, we were talking
about the death of William Burroughs, and how
there had never been a San Francisco celebra
tion, which by the way I'm organizing, a memo
rial. And I was calling him to get him involved
as a speaker. This will be on April 23rd, by the
way, at the San Francisco Art Institute.
Anyway, we were talking about it and I said, I
hate this word, but I haven't gotten any sense of
closure over William's death, and this excited
Biafra's fury instantly: "Closure? That's this
yuppie corporate word bullshit. This is like
some word which corporate types use to try
and get you to buy more things." And he went
off on it. He said you don't get any closure
about anyone dying. He said, "My sister died
two years ago, and I will never get closure over
that." And you know, he's right. These words, all
the language has to be constantly reevaluated. I
had never really thought that way. But this is
just a small example.
INT: How did you start actually publishing
books? You were working at City Lights...
VV: I was working at City Lights and I asked
Allen Ginsberg for a hundred dollars, and he in
one minute wrote me a check. Then I took the
check to Lawrence Ferlinghetti and he also in
one minute wrote me another check for $100. I
got another $200 from another friend of mine
who happens to be a doctor, and that's all it
took to produce the first "Search and Destroy,"
and then I sort of kept going, but I never

thought I would ever make a living off it.
Although, I probably should have taken a
Stanford MBA class — it would have helped
me, I'm sure ... I would advise every rebel to
take one business class and accounting class,
definitely.
So basically I just developed themes that
were uncovered during the punk years ... The
main book that changed society was "Modern
Primitives," which more or less gave every pos
sible reason to get tattooing and doing body
piercing and modifications, and none of the
negatives, pretty much, and then we did "Angry
Women," which is still a favorite in college
classes, it's kind of an early activist, feminist
performance artist kind of text ... and then the
"Guide to Bodily Fluids," which is still a very
funny book.
One of our goals was to try to be anti-puri

tanical, you know, we live in a
very puritanical culture in
America, which regards the
body with disgust, and none of
our books dealt with dealing
with that ... I mean that's why
one of our best-selling books
was called "Freaks," it was deal
ing with people who used to be
circus freaks ... and Bob

Flanagan supermasochist, and just reclaiming
the body as your artistic canvas, as well as like,
a non-guilty source of all kinds of pleasure ...
But my newest book is on the Swing movement.
A lot of my punk rock friends of course were
horrified ... You have to remember that Swing
was not invented by white people in this cul
ture, it was an underground movement, invent
ed by black people in Harlem 10 years before
white people found out about it, in 1936.
... In a way there's never been so much
awareness, shared by so many people — but it's
sound bite-ish awareness, it's not really deep.
It's so superficial ... and as you know the num
ber of readers is declining every day ... and yet
that's how you get depth, it's by reading, and
thinking about things.

Interview by Wendy Yao, transcribed with help from Simon Martinez

rVale is an independent publisher from
San Francisco who has been studying
counter-culture for the past 25 years.
Back in the late '70s, he started the early punk
magazine, "Search & Destroy," which is now
deemed by many as "the authoritative guide to
punk culture." All of his books focus on providing
primary sources of information, mainly in the
interview format. Since then, he has conducted
thousands of interviews with a wide variety of
people, including bell hooks, William S.
Burroughs, Jello Biafra, Robert Moog, J.G.
Ballard and pretty much everyone involved in the
early punk scene. Last week, Intermission got the
chance to talk to him about his experiences grow
ing up in San Francisco and running his publish
ing company.
INT: When you were doing things back in the
"Search and Destroy" days [the '70s], were you
one of the only Asians?
VV: You bet! [laughter] God, there were so
few Asians back in the early punk scene. There
was me; I think I was the only one for a while ...
There was this Linda Nakamura, but she didn't
come in until late '78, early '79. But 1 was there
in '76, the fall ... I do think that for someone as
non-famous as me, I've had a tremendous
impact.
INT: Everyone knows your books —
VV: Well, they don't really know me behind
it. They don't even know I'm Asian, for example
... I'm actually a San Francisco native and my
first job that I had was working at City Lights
bookstore in San Francisco because I loved the
Beats, the Beatniks, and I loved to read, and I
particularly loved the Beat movement. I had
read all the books I could get my hands on —
especially like William S. Burroughs. Although
what I liked about Burroughs was not the
books he's famous for — the fiction like
"Naked Lunch" — what I loved about him was
one book called "The Job," which is a book of
interviews with him. And I also started collect
ing any interviews I could find.
INT: How old were you?
VV: Oh God, young. Much younger. 25 years

younger than I am now ... The point is that I
was lucky enough to score the job at City Lights
bookstore which many young writers had
dreamed of working for, and one advantage to
working there in the pre-computer days was
that you didn't have to work as hard. Seriously.
I could read all the media that was coming in,
in between ringing up books. And it was really

er core things. And for films, too, I remember
all the punks would go down to Market Street,
they had these theaters where for 99 cents you

could see three movies, with
mostly winos sleeping all day in
the theaters. That was where we
got our taste for B-movies, it was
in the 70's and that's why 10 years
later I came out with incredibly
strange films-it was the book
development of that idea, of
alternative cinema ...

Anyway the reason that I got the idea to pub
lish because I became so angry reading the few
mainstream articles there were about punk
rock. I said, "I'm going to publish and tell the
truth." And I was already a big fan of Claude
Levi-Strauss, who's a major French anthropolo
gist, father of structural anthropology, so 1
wanted to treat it like an anthropology project,
in other words, not make any assumptions
about the culture, and try and use a lot of what
I call "first-hand informants." So, that's why I
did the interview format.
INT: So you printed the direct dialogue?
VV: It's all source stuff — not a lot of edito
rializing by me. Also, the advantage of handling
a whole bunch of various viewpoints and their
words is that collectively everybody has a much
greater intelligence than any one person with a
limited point of view ...
Of course, as punk spread, there was a lot of
diverse development, and I chose to follow
what was called the Industrial Culture
Movement, which was focusing on making
noise, and found sounds, away from the tradi
tional guitar, bass, drums format ... trying to
explore doing things with tape recorders, and I
guess more abrasive, and using cut up sounds
from TV news, you know, critique of society ...
death imagery ... things that were forbidden at
the time. Although they're now as common as
toast and tabloid TV —
INT: Yeah, what do you think about that?
VV: Oh, of course whenever anything
becomes mainstream, I naturally react against
it. Actually, that was the credo of the "Sex
Pistols": an easy way to raise your intelligence
— ask, "is it against the status quo?" Anything;
I don't care what it is that's embraced by the
mainstream, 1 tend to react against it. Even then
in the "Industrial Culture Handbook," we were
one of the first in print to kind of objectively
probe serial killers and phenomena like that.
Really, no one was doing it back then. Still,
when it comes to the point over 10 years later
when you see frat boys start wearing Ted Bundy
t-shirts, well then, I'm out of there.
INT: So do you think that things completely
lose their meanings then (after they have
become mainstream]?
VV: Well, I think everyone has to go through
their own personal voyage of discovery, where
they learn about the really dark things that can
happen in life, because otherwise you're having
a cotton candy version to the way the world
works. But at the same time, we're going
through stages and developing, and I certainly,
I've read about 500 books about serial killers,
and really, I'm done with that. You have to
move on, and again it's like so mainstream now.
INT: Because there will probably be some
frat-boys reading this, if you want to explain
anything more about that...
VV: Well, it's just that we live in a culture
now in which everyone is trying to up the ante
in terms of grossing out; there's something
macho associated with trying to gross out your
friends, like "I can outgross-you out" or "I can
read about more gorey stuff than you." But it's
kind of a macho thing, I think. I don't think it's
a serious inner exploration — because we are
all tied together, I mean, the darkest things that
someone does, you might say we're all capable
of murder, in one sense or another. If the right
circumstance happened. There's always an
outer and inner component to all investigation,
and there's no such thing as objectivity.
Everything has a personal component to it;
that's one thing that the feminist movement
kind of alerted us to — the method of objectiv
ity. So I tried my best to give an accurate in
depth chronicling of I call the punk rock cul
tural insurrection. I thought it was like an
archetype for many subsequent generations to
make their own [culture], and the reason why I
think that in a way punk rock will never die is

because I look at it as entry level social rebel
lion for people in grade school and high school
with very little resources.
INT: So, do you think that stuff like punk
rock's viability is contingent —
VV: It's economics!
INT: — It has to be underground, because it
can always grow, but at a certain point if it
becomes a dominant thing, then it loses its
point.
VV: ... There's always going to be a new gen
eration coming up every six months, critiquing
everyone else that's come before them, and I
think that's a very necessary stage — I think
rebellion is a very necessary stage to go

through. I mean, at least chal
lenging what they used to call
the dominant paradigm or the
dominant cultural assump
tions and values of the time.
In any case, I think you always
have to do this constantly. You
have to refresh your standards
by which you evaluate any
thing and examining your

language — this is a very key thing. It was
funny, the last time I talked to Jello Biafra, lead
singer of the Dead Kennedys, we were talking
about the death of William Burroughs, and how
there had never been a San Francisco celebra
tion, which by the way I'm organizing, a memo
rial. And I was calling him to get him involved
as a speaker. This will be on April 23rd, by the
way, at the San Francisco Art Institute.
Anyway, we were talking about it and I said, I
hate this word, but I haven't gotten any sense of
closure over William's death, and this excited
Biafra's fury instantly: "Closure? That's this
yuppie corporate word bullshit. This is like
some word which corporate types use to try
and get you to buy more things." And he went
off on it. He said you don't get any closure
about anyone dying. He said, "My sister died
two years ago, and I will never get closure over
that." And you know, he's right. These words, all
the language has to be constantly reevaluated. I
had never really thought that way. But this is
just a small example.
INT: How did you start actually publishing
books? You were working at City Lights...
VV: I was working at City Lights and I asked
Allen Ginsberg for a hundred dollars, and he in
one minute wrote me a check. Then I took the
check to Lawrence Ferlinghetti and he also in
one minute wrote me another check for $100. I
got another $200 from another friend of mine
who happens to be a doctor, and that's all it
took to produce the first "Search and Destroy,"
and then I sort of kept going, but I never

thought I would ever make a living off it.
Although, I probably should have taken a
Stanford MBA class — it would have helped
me, I'm sure ... I would advise every rebel to
take one business class and accounting class,
definitely.
So basically I just developed themes that
were uncovered during the punk years ... The
main book that changed society was "Modern
Primitives," which more or less gave every pos
sible reason to get tattooing and doing body
piercing and modifications, and none of the
negatives, pretty much, and then we did "Angry
Women," which is still a favorite in college
classes, it's kind of an early activist, feminist
performance artist kind of text ... and then the
"Guide to Bodily Fluids," which is still a very
funny book.
One of our goals was to try to be anti-puri

tanical, you know, we live in a
very puritanical culture in
America, which regards the
body with disgust, and none of
our books dealt with dealing
with that ... I mean that's why
one of our best-selling books
was called "Freaks," it was deal
ing with people who used to be
circus freaks ... and Bob

Flanagan supermasochist, and just reclaiming
the body as your artistic canvas, as well as like,
a non-guilty source of all kinds of pleasure ...
But my newest book is on the Swing movement.
A lot of my punk rock friends of course were
horrified ... You have to remember that Swing
was not invented by white people in this cul
ture, it was an underground movement, invent
ed by black people in Harlem 10 years before
white people found out about it, in 1936.
... In a way there's never been so much
awareness, shared by so many people — but it's
sound bite-ish awareness, it's not really deep.
It's so superficial ... and as you know the num
ber of readers is declining every day ... and yet
that's how you get depth, it's by reading, and
thinking about things.

Interview by Wendy Yao, transcribed with help from Simon Martinez

rVale is an independent publisher from
San Francisco who has been studying
counter-culture for the past 25 years.
Back in the late '70s, he started the early punk
magazine, "Search & Destroy," which is now
deemed by many as "the authoritative guide to
punk culture." All of his books focus on providing
primary sources of information, mainly in the
interview format. Since then, he has conducted
thousands of interviews with a wide variety of
people, including bell hooks, William S.
Burroughs, Jello Biafra, Robert Moog, J.G.
Ballard and pretty much everyone involved in the
early punk scene. Last week, Intermission got the
chance to talk to him about his experiences grow
ing up in San Francisco and running his publish
ing company.
INT: When you were doing things back in the
"Search and Destroy" days [the '70s], were you
one of the only Asians?
VV: You bet! [laughter] God, there were so
few Asians back in the early punk scene. There
was me; I think I was the only one for a while ...
There was this Linda Nakamura, but she didn't
come in until late '78, early '79. But 1 was there
in '76, the fall ... I do think that for someone as
non-famous as me, I've had a tremendous
impact.
INT: Everyone knows your books —
VV: Well, they don't really know me behind
it. They don't even know I'm Asian, for example
... I'm actually a San Francisco native and my
first job that I had was working at City Lights
bookstore in San Francisco because I loved the
Beats, the Beatniks, and I loved to read, and I
particularly loved the Beat movement. I had
read all the books I could get my hands on —
especially like William S. Burroughs. Although
what I liked about Burroughs was not the
books he's famous for — the fiction like
"Naked Lunch" — what I loved about him was
one book called "The Job," which is a book of
interviews with him. And I also started collect
ing any interviews I could find.
INT: How old were you?
VV: Oh God, young. Much younger. 25 years

younger than I am now ... The point is that I
was lucky enough to score the job at City Lights
bookstore which many young writers had
dreamed of working for, and one advantage to
working there in the pre-computer days was
that you didn't have to work as hard. Seriously.
I could read all the media that was coming in,
in between ringing up books. And it was really
around *74, right after when I started, that I
discovered what was punk rock.
It was really starting to be public. I knew
about Patti Smith back then; 1 got my first book
from her. I knew about CBGB's, I knew some
thing was happening. And the only way you
could read about punk back then was in these
British rock music papers — New Music

Express, Sounds and Melody
Maker. In the summer of '75,
there was a huge centerfold
that I cut out and put on my
living room that was about
the emerging punk scene in
New York — but they didn't
even know what to call it
then. They had Patti Smith,

The Ramones played
this teeny club... but I
knew that this was
the future...

Tom Verlaine, Television, the Ramones, Blondie
— all these people were each given a paragraph
in this article and I wanted so much to go to
New York but I had no money. And 1 was just
hoping that something like that would happen
in San Francisco, and it did — like the
Ramones played here in a teeny club where 15
people went, including me, of course.
INT: Were you a teenager then? .
VV: No, no, I was older. And the Ramones
played this teeny club where there were literal
ly 30 people each night, but 1 knew that this
was the future. As you know, punk was just a
reaction against this bloated dinosaur stadium
rock and the guitar gods like Led Zepellin, and
basically restored folk culture and folk music to
the people again, that's the way I looked at it.
When early punk started, it was such a revolt
against the moribund hippie culture, that
everyone was so creative at the beginning. No
one was just an audience person consuming or
buying a band t-shirt. There weren't any band
t-shirts then. You had to make your own punk
clothes. You had to cut them up and spray slo
gans on them and hand-make your own things.
And of course, everyone started trying to be in

a band. Because the Ramones made it look so
easy. Literally, there were people in a band a
week after they had picked up an instrument.
Like Will Shatter, picking up the bass. And of
course, everyone was making their own posters;
and a lot of the posters have been forgotten.
They had very shocking graphics, sometimes
from sex magazines — the kind of forbidden
things. It was really quite a grass roots cultural
revolt.
The iconic writers were different from the
hippie culture writers; we championed William
S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard, you know, hard
er core things. And for films, too, I remember
all the punks would go down to Market Street,
they had these theaters where for 99 cents you

could see three movies, with
mostly winos sleeping all day in
the theaters. That was where we
got our taste for B-movies, it was
in the 70's and that's why 10 years
