## AN INTERVIEW WITH V .VALE rebel publisher of REsearch/Vsearch publications 
### 
Interview by Wendy Yao, transcribed with help from Simon Martinez

rVale is an independent publisher from
San Francisco who has been studying
counter-culture for the past 25 years.
Back in the late '70s, he started the early punk
magazine, "Search & Destroy," which is now
deemed by many as "the authoritative guide to
punk culture." All of his books focus on providing
primary sources of information, mainly in the
interview format. Since then, he has conducted
thousands of interviews with a wide variety of
people, including bell hooks, William S.
Burroughs, Jello Biafra, Robert Moog, J.G.
Ballard and pretty much everyone involved in the
early punk scene. Last week, Intermission got the
chance to talk to him about his experiences grow
ing up in San Francisco and running his publish
ing company.
INT: When you were doing things back in the
"Search and Destroy" days [the '70s], were you
one of the only Asians?
VV: You bet! [laughter] God, there were so
few Asians back in the early punk scene. There
was me; I think I was the only one for a while ...
There was this Linda Nakamura, but she didn't
come in until late '78, early '79. But 1 was there
in '76, the fall ... I do think that for someone as
non-famous as me, I've had a tremendous
impact.
INT: Everyone knows your books —
VV: Well, they don't really know me behind
it. They don't even know I'm Asian, for example
... I'm actually a San Francisco native and my
first job that I had was working at City Lights
bookstore in San Francisco because I loved the
Beats, the Beatniks, and I loved to read, and I
particularly loved the Beat movement. I had
read all the books I could get my hands on —
especially like William S. Burroughs. Although
what I liked about Burroughs was not the
books he's famous for — the fiction like
"Naked Lunch" — what I loved about him was
one book called "The Job," which is a book of
interviews with him. And I also started collect
ing any interviews I could find.
INT: How old were you?
VV: Oh God, young. Much younger. 25 years

younger than I am now ... The point is that I
was lucky enough to score the job at City Lights
bookstore which many young writers had
dreamed of working for, and one advantage to
working there in the pre-computer days was
that you didn't have to work as hard. Seriously.
I could read all the media that was coming in,
in between ringing up books. And it was really
around *74, right after when I started, that I
discovered what was punk rock.
It was really starting to be public. I knew
about Patti Smith back then; 1 got my first book
from her. I knew about CBGB's, I knew some
thing was happening. And the only way you
could read about punk back then was in these
British rock music papers — New Music

Express, Sounds and Melody
Maker. In the summer of '75,
there was a huge centerfold
that I cut out and put on my
living room that was about
the emerging punk scene in
New York — but they didn't
even know what to call it
then. They had Patti Smith,

The Ramones played
this teeny club... but I
knew that this was
the future...

Tom Verlaine, Television, the Ramones, Blondie
— all these people were each given a paragraph
in this article and I wanted so much to go to
New York but I had no money. And 1 was just
hoping that something like that would happen
in San Francisco, and it did — like the
Ramones played here in a teeny club where 15
people went, including me, of course.
INT: Were you a teenager then? .
VV: No, no, I was older. And the Ramones
played this teeny club where there were literal
ly 30 people each night, but 1 knew that this
was the future. As you know, punk was just a
reaction against this bloated dinosaur stadium
rock and the guitar gods like Led Zepellin, and
basically restored folk culture and folk music to
the people again, that's the way I looked at it.
When early punk started, it was such a revolt
against the moribund hippie culture, that
everyone was so creative at the beginning. No
one was just an audience person consuming or
buying a band t-shirt. There weren't any band
t-shirts then. You had to make your own punk
clothes. You had to cut them up and spray slo
gans on them and hand-make your own things.
And of course, everyone started trying to be in

a band. Because the Ramones made it look so
easy. Literally, there were people in a band a
week after they had picked up an instrument.
Like Will Shatter, picking up the bass. And of
course, everyone was making their own posters;
and a lot of the posters have been forgotten.
They had very shocking graphics, sometimes
from sex magazines — the kind of forbidden
things. It was really quite a grass roots cultural
revolt.
The iconic writers were different from the
hippie culture writers; we championed William
S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard, you know, hard
er core things. And for films, too, I remember
all the punks would go down to Market Street,
they had these theaters where for 99 cents you

could see three movies, with
mostly winos sleeping all day in
the theaters. That was where we
got our taste for B-movies, it was
in the 70's and that's why 10 years
later I came out with incredibly
strange films-it was the book
development of that idea, of
alternative cinema ...

Anyway the reason that I got the idea to pub
lish because I became so angry reading the few
mainstream articles there were about punk
rock. I said, "I'm going to publish and tell the
truth." And I was already a big fan of Claude
Levi-Strauss, who's a major French anthropolo
gist, father of structural anthropology, so 1
wanted to treat it like an anthropology project,
in other words, not make any assumptions
about the culture, and try and use a lot of what
I call "first-hand informants." So, that's why I
did the interview format.
INT: So you printed the direct dialogue?
VV: It's all source stuff — not a lot of edito
rializing by me. Also, the advantage of handling
a whole bunch of various viewpoints and their
words is that collectively everybody has a much
greater intelligence than any one person with a
limited point of view ...
Of course, as punk spread, there was a lot of
diverse development, and I chose to follow
what was called the Industrial Culture
Movement, which was focusing on making
noise, and found sounds, away from the tradi
tional guitar, bass, drums format ... trying to
explore doing things with tape recorders, and I
