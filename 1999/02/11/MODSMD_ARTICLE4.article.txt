# Med School to benefit from NIH budget hike
## 
### Virginia Yang 
Researchers at medical schools across the
country, including Stanford, will be seeing
windfalls from a $2-billion budget increase for
the National Institutes of Health for the 1999
fiscal year.
About 75 percent of the total research bud
get at the School of Medicine comes from the
NIH. Other federal government money makes
up another 5 percent.
"The National Institutes of Health is by far
our major source of research support," said
Harry Greenberg, senior associate dean for re

search at the Medical School.
This unprecedented increase boosted the
agency's budget up to $15.7 billion, almost
twice what it was 10 years ago. President Clin
ton is expected to request an increase of about
2.1 percent for the agency next year.
The agency's plans for spending this new
money include a large increase in research
grants and funding.
This means more money available to fund
research at colleges and universities such as
Stanford.

Greenberg said, "this is the gold
en age for biomedical research with
advances in areas such as the
genome project. In the next 10 to 20
years there will be huge advances in
the way we take care of people." He
called the budget increase "money
well spent."
Surgery Prof. Thomas Krummel,
who will soon take over as his de
partment's chair, said the increase
"represents a fabulous opportunity
for anyone involved in biomedical
research."
Along with the increased budget,
Congress is also looking into in
creased oversight on where the
money goes. In the past the NIH has
always been very well respected and
had relatively little congressional
oversight.
Now, various senators are scruti
nizing the agency's use of the new
funds.

"There has always been a feeling
of some oversight of the National
Institutes of Health, hut if the agen
da began to be run by congressional
staff that would not be good, but
that won't happen," Greenberg
said.
"Accountability has always bpen
important, and we must participate
under those circumstances," agreed
Krummel.
Compared to other federal agen
cies such as the Food and Drug Ad
ministration. Congress is relatively
lax on the NIH, although some
problems has arisen about abuse of
funds, such as when Mark Hughes, a
Georgetown University scientist, vi
olated federal laws and used NIH
equipment and postdoctoral fellows
to conduct genetic tests on human
embryos two years ago. But these
cases are few.
Greenberg said, "the scientific
community has been quite account
able and the NIH itself is at the best
position to oversee where the
money goes."
