Researchers at medical schools across the
country, including Stanford, will be seeing
windfalls from a $2-billion budget increase for
the National Institutes of Health for the 1999
fiscal year.
About 75 percent of the total research bud
get at the School of Medicine comes from the
NIH. Other federal government money makes
up another 5 percent.
"The National Institutes of Health is by far
our major source of research support," said
Harry Greenberg, senior associate dean for re

search at the Medical School.
This unprecedented increase boosted the
agency's budget up to $15.7 billion, almost
twice what it was 10 years ago. President Clin
ton is expected to request an increase of about
2.1 percent for the agency next year.
The agency's plans for spending this new
money include a large increase in research
grants and funding.
This means more money available to fund
research at colleges and universities such as
Stanford.
