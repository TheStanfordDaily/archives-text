## This week's music reviews Peanut Butter Wolf My Vinyl Weighs a Ton 
### 
rou might have never heard of him, you
might even do a double take at the sound
of his name, but in some circles the mere
utterance of "Peanut Butter," "Wolf" or even simply
"Chris Manak" conjures up images of a man with
beats for days and memories of such hip hop master
pieces as the "Lunar Props" EP and the "Step On Our
Hgos" EP. These releases, along with a handful of oth
ers, have so ingrained this man on the minds of some
that finer points of his career are retold like folk tales:
his namesake is a make-believe monster made up by
an ex-girlfriend's younger brother in 1988, a name
first used by Wolf in a mildly successful punk roc ;
band. He changed his DJ name from Chris Cut to
Peanut Butter Wolf after encouragement from his
partner Charizma, whose memory has been kept alive
by Wolf through posthumous releases since his
untimely death. The name of his record label, Stones
Throw, comes from the first time he heard the saying
"a stones throw away" — an inside joke between him,
his mom and his boy Chari/.ma. The title of his long
awaited LP "My Vinyl Weighs a Ton" refers to the time
he moved his thousands of records up and down two
flights of stairs.
Known for providing tracks with head-nodding
beats and cleverly used samples for emcees from his
own backyard here in the Bay (as in songs for Rasco,
Grand and Charizma, and on the "Step On Our Egos"
EP) as well as for his own DJ-ing skills, Peanut Butter
brings more of the same on this solid LP laced with
appearances by top notch West Coast emcees, as well
as by DJs from across the US and Canada. Emerging
emcee Planet Asia drops a teaser verse over a low-key
but addictive beat, with Wolf on the cuts, on "In Your
Area," only to come full force with "Definition of 111"
later on in the album. In one of the highlights of the
LP, Oxnard-based Likwit Crew member Lootpack's
"Styles Crew Flows Beats" begins with a typically well
formed PBWolf track that you won't want to end —
which it does by changing the beat halfway through to
bring in an equally respectable track. Lootpack
emcees Wildchild, Madlib and Quasimoto (Wild
child's alter ego, a la Del the Funky Homosapien's
Unicron) deliver lyrics with their distinctive flows, as
Lootpack DJ Romes provides the cuts over Wolf's lat
est masterpiece. Charizma's "Keep on Rockin It"

reveals once again the talent that the P- • v, °"
scene lost with his death, as his style is as fresh now as
it was then. The '97 classic "Run The Line," with Rasco
on the mic and Invisib! Scratch Piklz DJ Qbert on the
cuts, appears here for all those who slept on the now
out-of-print original. Grand, a Bay Area favorite,
comes strong once again on "Competition Gets
None" with How and voice inflections to make for a
melodic stinger. His own description fits best: "I move
on and blow through just like a monsoon /1 creep in
fuckin step with the <ounds of a Shaft tune / No
rough drafts, I use what I wrote first / to be your ran
beverage, quenching your hip hop thirst." Also mak
ing their mark here aie emcees Persevere, Zest, Dave
Dub, Pablo and Kazi. On the DJ end, DJ Babu of
Dilated Peoples and the Beat Junkies comes in on
"Casio", while Wolf and DJ Design of Foreign Legion
give their perspective on "Phonies", and an all-star
lineup (Rhettmatic & J Rocc of the Beat Junkies; Kid
Koala; Rob Swift & Total Eclipse of the X-Ecutioners;
A Track & Shortkut of the Invisible Scratc 1 n: V!z; DJ
Hands; Z Trip; DJ Quest of the Space Travelers; and
Cut Chemist of Jurassic 5) tells a "Tale of Five Cities"
in a nine minute turntable collage.
In fine tradition, Peanut Butter perfectly comple
ments his talented emcees with homegrown beats and
cuts. With its lyrical lineup, turntablism showcases
and several short interludes, "My Vinyl" weighs in at
24 tracks, where even the weakest links are strong
enough to merit Wolf's latest effort.
