# Kevin O'Donnell
## It's a Process 
### 
n inger-songwriters from Los Angeles are gen
erally a dime a dozen, but Kevin O'Donnell
does have at least one catch — he used to be
a Hollywood producer, working mainly on cartoons
for CBS. O'Donnell abruptly changed careers and is
now releasing his debut album, "It's A Process," a pol
ished chunk of adult-contemporary boredom.
Penning upbeat lyrics in today's world of irony and
cynicism could be seen as courageous. However, being
'life-affirming' usually means being bland. On the
song "Vibe," O'Donnell sings "I believe the world's
gonna be all right /1 think we're going to be OK /
'Cause in the end, good's a little better than bad."
Maybe if O'Donnell was a tall, beautiful, blond 'poet
ess' from Alaska who likes to ride horses bareback and
used to live out of her car, he could get away with such
trite lyrics.
Nonetheless, while "It's A Process" suffers from
dumbness, the music is credible. Although the band is
obviously full of studio musicians, it plays elegant
music which places O'Donnell's weak voice in a flat
tering setting. Further, typical adult-contemporary
cliches like chiming acoustic guitars are nicely bal
anced by a tight rhythm section and unexpected bits
of harmonica and bazouki.
O'Donnell also knows how to write pleasing vocal
melodies, and on songs with a little ragged despera
tion, like "Fading Away" and "Can You Feel It,"he even
has a little soul in his voice. With "Song Of Love," he
delivers a simple, evocative performance which, for
what it's worth, compares reasonably well with a Phil
Collins ballad.
The real problem with "It's A Process" is that the
album violates the illusion of reality that lurks behind
much of popular music. "HonkyTonk Women"
wouldn't be much fun if we didn't think that Mick
Jagger was such a carouser. "Born To Run" would not
be as moving without Springsteen's mythic past as a

Jersey guttersnipe. However, when O'Donnell sings
that he is "Down on money, high on hope," one can't
really forget that producers working for CBS usually
don't starve.
