# Four Shillings Short
## Coming soon to the CoHo 
### 
our Shillings Short is a California band
/ ~ located in the Bay Area. It has been mak-
C ing audiences jig for more than 10 years
with their rich eclectic mix of Celtic and American
Folk.
The band was founded by Aodh Og, a native of
Ireland, who sings and plays tinwhistle, woodwinds,
dumbek and spoons. He joined with Christy Martin,
a Southern California-based singer who plays the
North Indian sitar, hammered dulcimer, banjo, man
dolin and bodhran. Soon afterwards, Kristopher
Klover and Jeff Buenz added their talents to the Og-
Martin team, making the group complete.
Four Shillings Short plays unique, rich pieces, with
fun titles like "Internet Blues." Moreover, the vocalists,
Christy and Aodh, dynamically convey the message
behind the music. "The Schillings" take on material as
diverse as the instruments they play. Dealing with the
political and grave, as well as the absurd and funny,
they also make these transitions — from somber to
hopeful — in a masterful way.
Although Four Shillings Short is primarily a Celtic
group, its music is also inspired by Indian raga, jazz
and other ethnic idioms. Coupled with that fact is
that the instruments used by the artists are rarely
played by musicians of the Celtic genre. The result of
the group's innovative blend of sounds and cultures is
fresh and enriching. Granted, it may take time to get
accustomed to this "Four Shillings Sound," but once
you let the music take hold, you can truly appreciate
the unusual style.
The band has produced five recordings under the
Gael Force Imports label, the most recent CDs being
Kelptic OddYaSee and The Boggy Spew. In capturing
its atypical sounds and oddly flavorful melodies in
these productions, this innovative group offers its
own refreshing spin on Celtic music. It has already
toured 38 states, played 150 performances nationwide
and plans to take Europe by storm in 2000.
You can receive more information on Four
Shillings Short by visiting its website
www.art.net/~4ss/ and you can come see them at the
Stanford Coffee House, tonight, 9 p.m. to midnight.
