# Placebo Without You I'm Nothing

### 
am an unlikely embodiment of wide-eyed
(V innocence; yet, completely spellbound by
v the music of Placebo, I cannot help but add
to the far-reaching and enthusiastic, almost idolatrous
praise of the group's latest release "Without You I'm
Nothing" (Virgin Records). The music is exciting,
noisy, captivating and ingeniously invigorating —
this sophomore release is a successful album.
Placebo has earned a reputation for glam, and with

it, a duty to maintain its sexy, coy look, especially after a
nod of approval from David Bowie and its recent
involvement in the movie "Velvet Goldmine." You can
only expect the CD case of its new release to burst open
and bring forth a cloud of glitter, mascara and attitude.
But when I heard "Without You I'm Nothing" described
as full of sex, my face reddened at thoughts of the pos
sibilities. So when I received the album, I was under
standably a little shy. I started off just smiling at it a lit
tle from across the bed, then I even dared to press it
against my heart, but all without much result (the pack
aging wrinkled, but no more). A more direct approach
had to follow if I was going to experience this much
lauded prize, so off with the wrapper and into the CD
player went Placebo.
The album's opening track, "Pure Morning," is a
dynamic start. The song is something of an anthem,
with its underlying pulse of drums and guitar calling to
the bleary eyed of the "night-turned-dawn" to form
rank. Singer Brian Molko rasps out to the upturned
faces: "A friend in need's a friend indeed / A friend with
weed is better / A friend with breasts and all the rest / A
friend that's dressed in leather." This rather sexy start
may mislead the listener; the song eventually offers the
comfort of contented solidarity among friends. First-off
the boys have to set the scene. Although "Without You
I'm Nothing" is rather reflective and beautiful — quali
ties which are thankfully never at odds with its perme
ate sexiness — we will not be allowed to forget that this
album is sex discarnate. So "Pure Morning" goes on,
contending with the vulnerability of the spirit in the
aftermath, during the come-down that is accompanied
so often with the start of morning and scheduled life:
"Dazed / Dawning / Skin Crawling / Pure Morning."
But when the chilling sobriety is faced in the comfort of
a friend's arms, the spirit unfettered, the day is
redeemed.
Following the initial rouser of a track is a variety of
upbeat songs, from the angrier "Brick Shithouse" to
poppier stuff like "You Don't Care About Us" and
"Allergic (To Thoughts of Mother Earth)." The com
plexity and variety of sound this three-piece group pro
duces throughout the album is already an impressive
feat, but that coherency in sound and theme is especial
ly showcased in the slower songs on the album. Ballads
can fall short of inspiration unless they're timely or top
ical, catching us in need of that sort of obvious reflec
tion and touching sentimentality. While Placebo rounds
out its sound on its second LP with down-tempo songs
like "My Sweet Prince" and "Burger Queen," the change
does not drag down the flow of the album, nor is the lis
tener left cold and alienated. The ballad-y tracks still
manage to capture our attention and inspire the same
awe and empathy of the other songs. Instead of relying
on a coincidental synchronicity of emotion between lis
tener and musician, Placebo captivates by virtue of its
musicianship.
The American, Swedish and British trio forms a solid
group, producing beautiful sounds and imagery. On
"Without You I'm Nothing," Placebo manages to bal
ance out various, often contradictory, images and ele
ments of style to present us with a very exciting and
overall brilliant album.
