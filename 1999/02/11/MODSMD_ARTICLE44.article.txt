## Doc's Da Name 2000 
### 
/ 7*J) / 112 hile talentless new rappers like DMX and
fY/ Silkk the Shocker continue to top the pop
€/[/ charts, Redman once again delivers quality
hip-hop with his fourth album, "Doc's Da Name 2000."
Blessed by the production of Erick Sermon, Redman
shines over funk-laced, bass-heavy tracks, showing that
he is still one of the top MCs in the game.
As always, while his subject matter of choice is limit
ed, Redman comes with all new metaphors describing
his blunted Newark, N. J. existence: "I smoke buddah to
the last drop like I was Maxwell / If blunts came in
degrees, call me a black belt" (from "Jersey Yo!").
Standout tracks include the hilarious "Get It Live, Jersey
Yo!" (a New Jersey interpretation of Ice Cube's "Once
Upon a Time in the Projects"), and the Del Squad col
laboration, "Down South Funk." On "Da Da DaHHH,"
Redman recounts the golden days of his youth as only
he would: "For quick cash, Doc hit up 13th Ave. / Sell
white boys oregano dash, then we laugh."
The greatest weakness of "Doc's Da Name 2000" is
that Redman often makes awkward attempts to incor
porate choruses into each song. His presence on the mic
stands out; he really doesn't need to rely on catchy cho
ruses like the majority of less-skilled MCs. In addition,
the numerous interludes, while often entertaining,
become excessive and annoying by the end of the
record. All things considered, "Doc's Da Name 2000"
constitutes Redman's least effective release. It never
achieves the standard he set with 1994's "Dare Iz A
Darkside" or 1996's "Muddy Waters." Nonetheless,
"Doc's Da Name 2000" is one of the better releases to
drop during the recent drought of bold and interesting
hip-hop. Redman proves that he has not fallen off, and
once again refuses to compromise his raw style for com
mercial appeal. You can quote this: "Redman is still the
Moby Dick of dopeness."
