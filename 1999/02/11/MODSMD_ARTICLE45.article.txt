# Satisfact
## The 						Third Meeting at the Third Counter 
### 
on't dance to Satisfact. And don't laugh either
J because the band is really serious, in the same
way that teenage poetry is really serious. It's
got guitars, drums and synths, and it's ready to experi
ment.
Somebody, however, should have told Satisfact that
you experiment in order to discover, because Satisfact
discovers nothing. Instead, it's so fascinated by the nois
es it makes that it doesn't do anything with them: the
violins scratched to buzz like flies, the white noise, the
lethargic bleeping and the vocals that resemble the
drawn-out moans of the terminally bored.
Satisfact is like a 9-year-old playing with a home
chemistry set. It fools about with the test tubes and
Bunsen burners and is completely satisfied if all it has
managed to do is to create a mess. Its music is as inco
herent as the jangle of coins in your pocket and without
any of the incidental beauty.
But it does have atmosphere. "M 52 or SMC," "Triple
Deck" and "Upon Arrival" quite honestly stun in the
way they manage to maintain a flavor, or a mood, or
whatever, while their noises change every moment but
keep the atmosphere intact. Quite hypnotic, really.
What sort of atmosphere? Well, if Portishead is film
noir then Satisfact is snuff movies played backwards
and in slow motion. The band mines a peculiar beauty
out of ugliness. In the middle of my first listen to "M 52
or SMC" I wrote down, "Underwater guitars.
Underwater violin cases with machine guns inside." I
have no idea why. That is Satisfact at its best. It empties
your mind and then fills it with images.
Mostly, though, the group is simply too cool to care.
They stand 10 feet back from the music and mutter,
"You will never understand." And for all the bouts of
rage — drums rolling, guitars screaming — you just
know their hearts aren't in it. After a while it becomes
one half antiseptic and one half anaesthetic. Its detach
ment takes all the sting out of its music and clatter and
it begins, instead, to slowly persuade you to sleep.
