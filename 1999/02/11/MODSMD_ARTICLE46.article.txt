## A 						'BLAST' OF GOOD HUMOR Walken as crazy, '50s-era father? 
### 
t's a good thing "Blast
'/ from the Past" doesn't
take itself seriously. The
actors involved knew to take every
thing in the movie lightly, too. The
nuclear age certainly has its inher
ent quirks (remember those "stop,
drop and hold" drills for nuclear
attacks?), and "Blast" takes its stabs
at humor. Christopher Walken,

Blast from the Past

if A" i

perennial bad
guy, hams it up
as a science
driven family
man who
builds an un
derground fall

out shelter that can sustain three
people for 35 years.
Walken has his hands full with
the role of Calvin Webber, a former
Cal Tech scientist who goes over the
edge. Calvin cannot be portrayed
too one-sidedly, and director Hugh
Wilson ("The First Wives Club")
wisely balances the character.
Calvin really cares about his fami
ly's well-being, but it's hard for any
one to fathom how one person —
let alone two or three — could live
for 35 years on solely pre-arranged
supplies.
Questions abound. Did Calvin
predict beforehand that a new child
would be born into the family
while he was supplying the struc
ture with food and medicine? How
does air get recycled and purified?
(Don't tell me it's that small garden
of plants.) How does the elevator
bringing them to the surface today
break through the rock buildup
and cement foundations? Wouldn't
you go crazy without sunlight or
blue skies for 35 years?
But suspend all thought process
es for the moment. Calvin is mar
ried to Helen (an annoying Sissy
Spacek), who can't wait for her

chance to get bacl > reality. When
the chance finally arrives, however,
it is not Helen but the book-smart
35-year-old Adam (Brendan
Fraser) who makes he trek to get
fresh supplies. Adai.i is a guinea pig
of sorts. Who knows what the post
apocalyptic Earth has turned into,
right?
Eve Rustikov (sexily played by
Alicia Silverstone) has all the ingre
dients for being the saintly charac
ter in the movie. Adam would have
gone down the drain selling his
baseball cards from the '50s for a
few bucks had it not been for the
brave heroics of Eve. Adam would
not have been able to buy another
decade's supply of groceries with
out Eve's help. It is Eve who even
helps Adam try to find a girlfriend
or potential spouse.
Cute, you're thinking. Adam and
Eve. Sure it's an old gimmick, but
the "Adam" part sure makes sense
considering how he may be the first
child raised in a self-sustained envi
ronment. Throw in another con
trivance, the blatantly gay friend
Troy (Adam Foley, voice of Flick in
"A Bug's Life"), and you've got an
inherently ridiculous movie.
But all is well, as long as you love
L.A. and all of its seediness. Fraser
has never delivered the blank look
better than here, and Silverstone's
update of the "Clueless" shtick pro
vides relevant, late '90s humor.
"Blast from the Past" has the feel,
from start to finish, that this might
be a dumb-downed epilogue to the
"Truman Show." None of us can
return to the innocent days of the
'50s, but at least we can share in the
nostalgia felt by many nuclear fam
ilies like the Webbers.
