# A 						STURDY 'VOICE'

tly tions, "Little Voice"
a*—/ displays some
mind-boggling talent — the
aptly-named protagonist of
the film, L.V., can mimic Judy
Garland, Marilyn Monroe
and Shirley Bassey with star
tling precision. And to think:
you get acting talent from
Ewan McGregor, Michael

Caine and Brenda
Blethyn to boot!
As L.V., Jane
Horrocks is an
undiscovered gift
in Hollywood wait

the scene. Not only can she
sing up a storm and perform
uncanny impressions of
singers from the '40s and
'50s, but she acts too! She
goes from scared silence to
vivacious stage presence to a
daughter's anger in a
moment's flash. Ail that is
required is a small impetus.
JL.V. has a very buxom
mother, the widowed Mari
Hoff (Blethyn). Mari tries
too hard to make herself look
attractive and young.
Blethyn's humorous yet sad
portrayal of Mari is a full
reversal from her previous
Oscar-nominated role in
"Secrets and Lies." Mari's
problem is her self-centered
vanity. She shows little regard
for her silent daughter or her
dead husband. She even jokes
at one point that she used to
get a kick out of calling her
self "Mrs. F. Hoff" Lines like
this make it hard not to hate
her.
L.V. also has a possible
love interest, Billy
(McGregor). Billy really loves
his pigeons. A LOT. He cares
for pigeons on the rooftop of
the apartment complex
where the Hoff family lives.
He's also very quiet, much

like L.V. McGregor plays Billy
with a cup-full of innocence.
Like Blethyn's Mari, Billy rep
resents a new direction in
McGregor's acting, a leap
away from his roles in
"Trainspotting" and
"Emma."
Director Mark Herman
("Brassed Off!") has included
a long-time television star

(Caine) with a
flashy role as talent
agent Ray Say, who
(a) courts Mari for
love and cheap
thrills, and (b)
courts L.V. for her

potentially valuable vocal
cords. Caine was the lone
winner from "Little Voice's"
three Golden Globe nomina
tions, and he has a good
chance at a supporting actor
Oscar nod as well.
it's clear that Horrocks
more than deserves all of
the attention she's been
receiving. Her character
walks a high wire between
sanity and lunacy and
always keeps you guessing.
Was L.V. really singing on
stage as a thank you to her
father? Or as a direct
affront to her mother? Or
as a way to prove to herself
that she is strong inside?
1 couldn't figure out the
Billy character in "Little
Voice." His healthy calm
seems out of place. While all
of the other Brits are up to
their necks in urban despera
tion, Billy exudes pure ease. It
makes you wonder how or
why he ever got interested in
homing pigeons. One thing is
for sure: there is nothing like
the sweetness of music, of a
"Little Voice," to get a person
through a depressing, English
night.
