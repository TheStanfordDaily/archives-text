"Yellow." a film about a group of Asian-
American teenagers in Los Angeles, is show
ing tonight at 7 p.m. in Old Union as the sec
ond in a series of presentations on the Asian
Diaspora. It is sponsored by several Asian-
American student groups and the Stanford
Film Society.
" 'Yellow' is also second of a series of pre
sentations that focuses on the Asian Diaspo
ra — ranging from South Asians in London
to Koreans living in Japan." said sophomore
Eddy Chi. who interns with the Asian-Amer
ican Students Association.

About 40 students are expected to attend,
but Chi encouraged more students to come
and "learn something that they normally
wouldn't see on campus and topics not talked
about in the mainstream."
" 'Yellow' is the first movie released with
in the past couple of years that has been di
rected and performed by Asian Americans in
California," he said, citing this as one of the
reasons the film was chosen as a part of Stan
ford's series.
The film revolves around the adventures
of eight friends durinc one life-changing
night in Los Angeles as they em
bark on a doomed scavenger hunt
to get a friend out of trouble. Eight
teenage friends make party plans
for grad night in Los Angeles after
their friend Sin Lee gets robbed
while working alone at his dad's
shop. His buddies rally together
and sketch a shaky get-rich-quick
plan to recover the money before
sunrise, resulting in an adventurous
and funny scavenger hunt.
The film also features 13 Asian
American rock and hip hop bands
on its soundtrack, including Bay
Area artists 10 BASS T, The Bruce
Lee Band and J-Church.
The film was received with rave
reviews from various critics includ
ing the Chicago Sun-Times, The
New York Times, and the Los An
geles Times for its candid portrayal
of the Asian-American society and
what the Sun-Times' Roger Ebert
called its relevance to "young Gen-
Xer's of any race."
First screened in San Francisco

last November, "Yellow" has gone
on to receive awards such as the
1997 Golden Carp First Place Au
dience Award at the sixth annual
Seattle Asian-American Film Fes
tival.
"Asian Americans are the
image and have produced the
image," said senior Jane Kim. who
has already seen the film twice. She
noted the relevance of the film to
students of other races.
"Although 'Yellow' is an Asian-
American production, their race
isn't a major focus in the film," Kim
said. "It is just ordinary individuals
doing regular activities."
Chris Chan Lee, the San Fran
cisco-born director of the film, is
also expected to be present at the
presentation to talk about the pro
duction of' Yellow' and field ques
tions from the audience.
The film is showing in the ball
room of the Old Union clubhouse
and is sponsored by AASA, the
Stanford Film Society, the Asian
American Activities Center Per
forming Arts Series and the Asian-
American Studies Film Series and
Okada House.
