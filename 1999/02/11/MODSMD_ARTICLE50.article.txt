Dear Roxy:
Valentine's Day is taming up, and I
want to give my girlfriend something sexy
rather than a box of cheap chocolates and
a ragged pink carnation* I don't have a lot
of money, though, or time to pick it out
(frigging midterms!}, What can you sug
gest for this pitiful, poor Romeo?
"Sting"

Dear Sting:
Roxy has fust the thing for you. When the
usual won't do, she suggests you make the day
special by treating your lady to something new
in the sack, Now, we're not talking about a sleazy
little nighty or a bottle of syrupy love butter.
Instead, try a practice which some believe to be
the key to explosive orgasms: Tan trie sex.
A little history: Tantra, which means "woven
together," started out as a part of Hinduism.
Followers believed sexual union was the quin
tessential way to reach enlightenment Slow,
non-orgasmic intercourse was the prescribed
method of worship. As you might guess, this
particular type of Hinduism had quite a fewfol
lowers In its heyday.
Flash forward to today, and you'll find that a
slice of modern society, even in America, still
follows Tantrism. Naturally, many of its proper
ties have been adapted for the modern observer.
For example, people generally no longer believe
that when a man comes, his kundalini energy
shoots up from his testicles into his brain and is
then sucked down and wasted (not a good
thing, from what Miss Sass understands). It's
this modern face of the practice that we'll dis
cuss for your V-Day surprise.
So, the general idea behind Tantrism is this:
You tune in to your partner, concentrate on
your sexual sensations and eventually have an
amazingly long and intense orgasm. The way
they figure it, the average orgasm is only ten sec
onds long, with the average person having sex
around once or twice a week. What this breaks
down to is something like 18 minutes of orgasm
a year, judging by how lovely orgasms are, they
say, we can all use a little more of them. So that's
just what they set out to do, with a little fun
along the way. Sounds promising, doesn't it?
To start a session, you must first attune your
self to your lover. Sit quietly across from him or
her, maintain eye contact (no giggling or snort
ing), and breath deeply. If you prefer, you can
try lying in spoon position (front to back on
your sides) and breathe deeply that way. Try to
get your breaths synchronized and maintain the
rhythm for about 15 minutes.
Remember to keep breathing deeply as you
move on to more erotic activities. You might
want to give each other a hair Or breath mas
sage, which involves running your hair or hot
breath over the other person's skin. Chakra ton
ing is another option: press your lips to your
lover's chakras (energy centers like the heart,
genitals, forehead, etc.) and hum to bring
awareness to different parts of the body.

Of course, whipping your hair about or
singing into your partner's crotch may or may
not appeal to you, so proceed as you like.
If you're hot and bothered at this point, you'll
want to graduate to genital massage. The yoni,
or female genitals, enjoy gentle and considerate
rubbing with high-quality massage oil. Most of
the attention should be paid to the outside
parts, the labia and the pubic mound, though
some penetration is useftjl to stimulate the G
spot Actually, in Tantra, it is said that if you
have your pinky in the lady's anus, the ring and
middle finger in her yoni, ami your thumb cm
her clitoris, you hold one of the mysteries of the
universe in your hand Miss Sass wonders where
you have to put your fingers to find out the
other mysteries!
The Tantric term for boy's genitals is
"lingam." The word means "wand of light," a ltt~
tie ego-boost for you fellows. Lingam massage
involves applying a little of the same massage
oil, and stroking from the base to the tip while
alternating hands. Pressure should be greatest
near the base of the lingam and ease off at the
top. You can also try massaging the head of the
lingam with a twisting motion* like juicing half
an orange or chalking up a pool stick.
If during either the yoni or lingam massage,
the receiving partner nears orgasm, the giver
should back off and wait for him or her to cool
down. One of the basic components of iantra is
learning to control the orgasmic response, so
that pleasure can be extended as long as possi
ble. Over a couple of days prior to trying Tantra,
monitor your orgasm reflex and get to know the
point when you are about to come but it isn't
quite inevitable yet. Then, when you're actually
having a massage or sex with your partner,
you'll be able to come close to orgasm and pull
back.
Ideally, you'll pull back like this at least six
times before you actually orgasm. Though this
sounds more like a recipe for blue balls than
anything else, it will make the eventual climax
mind-blowing and long (so sources say).
That, oversimply, is Tantra. If you want to
know more, there exists all sorts of literature,
both on the Web and in bookstores. Now, Miss
Sass isn't sure whether you'll find rapture with
these techniques but with promises like "spiritu
al vistas of sexual beauty and unity," what have
you got to lose? Happy Valentine's Day, sweetie.
