attracts Stanford students, I lii.s
small restaurant scats only about
100 people. While there is often a
15 minute wait at the door, the
surprisingly last service more
than makes up for any inconve
nience. As you walk in, you look

into the open kitchen and are able tit smell
the aroma of what you are about to eat, and
you know the chefs are not spitting in your
udon, Silting on hard chairs al linoleum
tables took away from the authenticity of
the Japanese cuisine. The Celine Dion
"titanic" power ballad did not help the
restaurants cause either.
The restaurant is staffed with courteous
waiters who lend to your every need. Your
order is quickly processed and your food is
brought to the table in less than a New York
minute. The menu, largely composed of
combination dinners, did not feature sushi
or tempura selections but concentrated
instead on terivake platters and udon soups.
It also featured a variety of vegetarian selec
tions, mostly consisting of tofu. Though .
limited in its scope, the menu still provides
enough choices to please a hungry cus
tomer. Main dishes range from 13 with
their specialty teriyakes (chicken, beef,.and
salmon) concentrated at arouifd $10.
Our meal started on a good note with an
outstanding bowl of miso soup. Adrien pro
gressed to a chicken terivake-lVied shrimp
combination; the shrimp had a heavy oily
batter but the unimpressive chicken had a
D-licious terivake sauce. David had the daily
special of tuna sashimi, the only sushi avail
able on the menu. David more than enjoyed
his meal, but it must be noted that he has a
strong bias in favor ol lima. We also sampled
their beef udon soup. The broth and noo
dles were laslv yet the beef was quite incon
sistent and overall the soup lacked character.
It was a last, good meal but we do not plan
on rushing back anytime soon.
