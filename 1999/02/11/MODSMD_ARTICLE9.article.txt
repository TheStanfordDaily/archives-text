Smoker gets $1.5 million in lawsuit
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A woman who
blames her inoperable cancer on the smoking habit
she took up as a teen-ager won $1.5 million in the first
case to go to trial since California repealed a ban on
individuals' lawsuits against tobacco companies.
The compensatory damages awarded Tuesday to
Patricia Henley cover her medical costs, pain and suf
fering. The Superior Court jury was to consider puni
tive damages today.
Henley, 52, was diagnosed a year ago with inoper
able cancer in her chest. She sued tobacco giant Philip
Morris Cos. — maker of cigarette brands including
Marlboro and L&M — alleging negligence, liability
and fraud and blaming the company for her illness.
She said she began smoking at 15, several years
before government-required warnings began appear
ing on cigarette packages in 1966. She claimed major
tobacco companies failed to warn that smokers may
be unable to quit the habit.
Philip Morris released a statement saying it "will
have no further comment on the case or the verdict"
until the trial's punitive phase was completed.
It was the first case since the repeal of a 1987 tort
reform law that banned cigarette smokers' lawsuits
on the basis that smoking's risks were well known.
Dozens of cases were dismissed.
In 1997, then-Attorney General Dan Lungren
joined justice officials in other states in suing the
tobacco industry, and the state Legislature responded
to criticism of the ban by repealing it.
The tobacco industry came to a $206 billion legal
settlement with states in November but cigarette
makers still face class-action lawsuits and individual
lawsuits by smokers.
Henley, of Los Angeles, quit smoking in 1997 after
suffering coughing fits and other health problems.
Philip Morris argued it was not liable for Henley's
illness since she understood and assumed the risks of
smoking.

MOSCOW (AP) — A plane carrying President

Unabomber Kaczynski hires new
lawyer, seeks second trial
MONTPELIER. Vt. (AP) — Unabomber
Theodore J. Kaczynski believes he was unfairly
coerced into pleading guilty and has hired a new
lawyer to help him win a second trial, a Vermont law
professor said yesterday.
A new trial could lead to the death penalty for the
• anti-technology terrorist, who has been in a federal
prison in Florence, Colo., since he was sentenced to
life without parole last spring.
"It was very important to me that Ted have a
' choice, the meaningful choice of going back to court,"
said Vermont Law Prof. Michael Mello, who has
< exchanged about 130 letters with Kaczynski since
July.
Mello said he is trying to talk Kaczynski out of fil
ing a motion for a new trial because of the risk of the
death penalty.
Kaczynski's plea cut short his trial in Sacramento,
Calif. He capitulated after his lawyers attempted
against his wishes to portray him as mentally ill and
the judge refused to let him represent himself.
Under the plea bargain, the government withdrew
[' its demand for the death penalty.
Kaczynski began writing to Mello after the profes
sor published articles critical of the defense lawyers.
Mello contends that Kaczynski's guilty plea was invol
untary, that he was coerced by his lawyers and that
> the judge was wrong in not letting Kaczynski repre
•' sent himself.
Kaczynski asked Mello's help in finding a new
lawyer, and Richard Bonnie of the University of Vir
ginia law school recently agreed to take the case, said
Mello, who is writing a book about the Unabomber
v trial.
