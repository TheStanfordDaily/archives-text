Dear Restaurant Owner,
One of the most popular features in Bon App£tit magazine is R.S.V.P. In
it we publish recipes by our readers, who dine out frequently and travel widely.
In answer to a recent request, we would be most grateful if you would
send us your recipe for Susan's Downfall Cheese Raviolis.

Dear Sir,
I was a guest at your restaurant and 1 chose to eat two of your specials
and they were excellent. One was the corn soup with cumin. Would you be
willing to send me the recipe?
I liked it so much that I would enjoy preparing it for my husband. (I'm
not a good enough cook to prepare the main course, the gillled dorado, but I
compliment you on that as well.)
1 look forward to my next meal at Pro Bono. I shall recommend your
restaurant to my friends in the San Francisco area.
Sincerely,
Susan Sheehan, The New Yorker Magazine
Dear Chef de Cuisine:
