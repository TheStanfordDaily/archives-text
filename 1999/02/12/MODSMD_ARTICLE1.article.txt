# Mabry speaks out
## Fmr. law prof, alleges racism 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Former Law School Prof. Linda
Mabry spoke out yesterday about
"the law school's racially hostile en
vironment" for the first time since
her abrupt resignation in December.
"I left Stanford law school be
cause it is an institution that engages
in a pattern of practicing intense
bias, which devalues, discourages
and marginalizes people of color,"
Mabry said.
Mabry is one of the professors
who decided to file complaints with
the Labor Department concerning
the University's tenure practices.
"These institutions have never
been held accountable for their ac
tions to the students and the public,"
Mabrv said. "They've hidden be-
hind this veil of truth and scholarship,
when their real actions are certainly
not reflective of 'justice.' I issued
these complaints with the hope that
someone would hold them account
able. that the Labor Department will
deem them responsible."
I ;iw School Dean Paul Brest held
;i town hall meeting on Wednesday,
where he discussed diversity issues
with faculty and students. While
Mubry's resignation was never direct
ly mentioned, Brest addressed stu
dent concerns over minority faculty
departures in the past few years.
"Minority faculty who have left
over the years often had other offers
or personal issues causing them to
leave," Brest said.
Mabry, however, took a different
stance. "[Brest] is certainly entitled to
his own view, but when people of
color are leaving, not because of
money or because they are lured
away by Harvard, there is a serious,
racial problem," she said. " There is a
1(X) percent attrition rate for women

of color, and only two women of color
have been on the tenure track in the
Law School's 106-year history. The
Law School dehumanizes minorities,
and yes, [Brest] is right, I do take it
personally — very, very personally."
At the town hall meeting, Brest
cited statistics that indicate Stanford
is the most racially diverse law school
in the nation. Minorities make up
12.5 percent of Law School faculty.
"We are a small law school of
about 40 faculty members," said
Xavier Gutierrez, a second-year law
student. "We do have one tenured
Latino professor, two African-Amer
ican tenured professors and two
African-American junior faculty
members. This is sizable for a small
law school, but 1 obviously think
many more need to be brought in to
equalize."
Mabry said she was skeptical of
statistics that measure what she calls a
"revolving door."
"Minority faculty, both tenured
and tenure-track, come and go, and
the University may replace them with
other minorities, but that means the
faculty isn't a consistent body," she
said. "When professors must continu

ally leave, this harms the institution
and its students."
Mabry describes her six years at
the Law School as if "you're being
asked to run a race in lead boots,
while white men sail along on winged
feet."
Mabry recalled a particular inci
dent in October that she said largely
contributed to her decision to leave
the Law School.
"I found out, by seeing a flier on a
student bulletin board, that the Law
School was establishing a transna
tional business program," she said. "I
am the only faculty member that
teaches transnational business law. I
was not consulted about the forma
tion of this program, which I found
highly disrespectful."
"Basically, they used me in the in
cipient stages of the program to raise
money from an outside source. I went
to dinners and lunches with potential
donors and rolled out for the dog and
pony as the token minority. Then,
after they got the money, they hand
ed the reins to someone else, who —
while he is talented — is a half-time
professor and is not even in transna
tional business. It's as if I don't count

at all."
According to Mabry, the program
is being headed by Law Prof. Thomas
Heller, whose specialty is interna
tional law and economy.
Mabry came to Stanford in 1993
after practicing law at a variety of
prominent firms; she said she was
"publicly acknowledged by the Clin
ton administration in 1992 and 19%"
for her contributory work.
"I'm not a megalomaniac who
wants to be in charge of everything,"
she said. "I just ask that I be told when
a program in my field of expertise, of
which I am the only faculty member
in the school, is instigated."
While this incident was key in her
decision to leave, Mabry felt the gen
eral environment at the Law School
was also a strong factor.
"When students cannot accept the
expertise of a woman of color and will
do so willingly for a white man, who
may be less of an expert, this is deeply
painful," she said. "And then there
are colleagues who will subtly dismiss
your work as 'garbage,' though they
have little knowledge in the field but
just have an objection to the color of
your skin."

While Marcus Cole, an African-
American tenure-track law school
professor, declined comment on the
issue, another one of Mabry's col
leagues, Law Prof. William Gould,
mostly concurred with her views. "I
thought that I had encountered in the
past, situations similar to what
[Mabry] encountered," he said. "I
think that the fundamental problem,
which Dean Brest has tried to ad
dress, is that minorities are in many or
most instances invisible people."
According to Gould, Brest has at
tempted to address issues of diversity
more so than his predecessors.
"[Brest], to his credit, has been
quite focused and interested in diver
sity issues," Gould said. "When [the
Mabry situation] emerged, [Brest] at
tempted to engage many of us, mi
nority and non-minority in discus
sion."
In relation to Mabrys views, Brest
maintained that he was "very sorry
that [Mabry] feels this way."
"I've looked into this matter very
seriously," Brest said. "I knew what
her concerns were when she left, and
I met with many faculty members to
discuss this. The conclusion that I

reached was that she was not treated
in a manner different from other fac
ulty members."
Mabry, however, disagreed with
Brest's assessment. "I have put my
professional life on the line in doing
this, so obviously I must have very
disturbing and important reasons.
When you see people who look like
you being disrespected, when you see
this pattern of disrespect being forced
on you, it's basically like saying,
'Linda Mabry, you don't count.' "
Brest has organized meetings to
be held in the coming weeks with the
Faculty Appointments Committee
and the Student Liaisons Committee
to discuss diversity issues that
Mabry's case has catalyzed.
"I think it's very important that we
get someone from outside the Law
School to determine how and if we
have created a hostile environment
and how to fix that," said Beth Ybar
ra, a third-year law student.
Mabry has not made her plans for
the future. "I have to work; it is my
livelihood," she said. "But the way
I'm feeling right now, I can't see my
self going back to teaching for a
while."
