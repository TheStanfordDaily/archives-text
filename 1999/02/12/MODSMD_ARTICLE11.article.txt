## Tanker threatens disaster in Oregon 
### 
COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) —
Demolitions experts brought in
napalm and plastic explosives yester
day in another attempt to set fire to a
grounded cargo ship and save Ore
gon's beaches from a disastrous spill
of fuel oil.
"It's going to be like your barbe

cue pit, if you will." said Coast Guard
Chief Gene Maestas. "They are
going to put lighter fluid on the coals
and light it on fire."
The 639-foot New Carissa, a
Japanese-owned freighter, ran
aground Feb. 4 about 150 yards off
shore with nearly 4(X),(XX) gallons of

tarlike hunker oil aboard. It began
leaking Monday as pounding waves
widened the cracks in its hull.
With an approaching storm
threatening to tear the ship apart
with 70 mph winds, federal and state
authorities decided to burn the ves
sel and its fuel — something never

before attempted in the Lower 48
states — rather than risk trying to
bring the New Carissa out intact.
The first attempt Wednesday
night using grenades and buckets of
gasoline fizzled with only a flash of
flame and a plume of oily black
smoke.
But the approaching gale slowed,
and the revised forecast said a weak
ened storm would move ashore late
Thursday with rain and winds of no
more than 45 mph. "Our window of
opportunity has widened," Maestas
said.
Yesterday, Navy bomb experts
boarded the ship with explosive
charges that they hoped would crack
open the fuel tanks and allow the oil
to fill the cargo holds.
Then they planned to put nearly
350 gallons of napalm gel over the
oil, leave the ship and ignite it by
remote control with C-4 plastic
explosives. It could take five days for
the oil to burn.
"The controlled burn is the high
est and best hope," Gov. John
Kitzhaber said. "If we don't cause
detonation and burn tonight, I guar
antee you'll have the release of oil."
National Oceanic and Atmo
spheric Administration experts have
said an oil spill could coat 50 to 1(X)
miles of the coast.
