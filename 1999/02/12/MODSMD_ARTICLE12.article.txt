# Italy's women in Parliament stage rape protest
## 
### 
ROME (AP) â€” Women lawmakers wore
jeans to Parliament yesterday and Italy's highest
appeals court was accused of sexism after ruling it
is impossible to rape a woman wearing jeans.
"If we goon like this, every woman that doesn't
wear a chastity belt will have the 'right' to be
raped." said Sonia Viale of Parliament's equal
opportunities commission.
The Court of Cassation ruled Wednesday it is
impossible to take off tight pants like ieans "with

out the cooperation of the person wearing them."
Baggy jeans aren't popular in Italy, and many
women prefer tight pants.
The decision overturned the 1998 conviction of
a 45-year-old driving instructor in southern Italy,
Carmine Cristiano. for raping an 18-year-old stu
dent. A lower court had sentenced Cristiano to
two years and eight months in prison, but the
appeals court said the girl must have consented to
sex and sent the case back for retrial.

The court also questioned why the victim, iden
tified only as Rosa, waited several hours to tell her
parents she'd been attacked.
"It could be seen as a manual for aspiring
rapists," the Rome daily II Messaggero fumed in a
front-page story. "Jeans: An alibi for rape," read a
sign held up in Parliament by five jeans-clad law
makers.
Protesting lawmakers called on women all over
Italy to join a "skirt strike" and wear jeans.
