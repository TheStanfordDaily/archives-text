# Senate sets noon impeachment vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With
acquittal assured, the Senate talked
its way through a final full day of
closed-door deliberations yesterday
at President Clinton's impeachment
trial, set for climactic noontime votes
today in the case that one Democrat
called a "sordid saga."
Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine
became the fourth Republican to
declare her intention to vote to
acquit on both charges, following the
lead of other moderates who broke
party ranks a day earlier. "In my
heart and in my mind, I believe to a
moral certainty that my verdict is
just," she declared in a written state
ment.
A two-thirds vote is required to
convict the president and remove
him from office, and there was never
a chance of that happening. Instead,
whatever suspense lingered at the
end of the five-week trial was
whether either article of impeach
ment would attain a bare majority —
a psychological threshold that had
no bearing on Clinton's fate.
Republicans have a 55-45 majori
ty in the Senate.
A steady stream of lawmakers
came forward yesterday to
announce their intentions for the roll
calls on perjury and obstruction of
justice, dividing largely along party
lines on presidential guilt or inno
cence but offering nonpartisan con
demnations of Clinton's behavior
with Monica Lewinsky.
"There can be no doubt that
President Clinton's conduct has
made a mockery of most of his
words, or that his example has been
corrosive beyond calculation to our
culture and to our children," said

Oregon Republican Gordon Smith
who said he would vote to convict.

"No one, not any senator in this
chamber nor any person in this
country, will look at this president in
the same way again," said Democrat
Dick Durbin of Illinois, who said he
would vote for acquittal on both
charges.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman said he
had concluded that Clinton's
"wrongdoing in this sordid saga does
not justify making him the first pres
ident to be ousted from office in our
history." The Connecticut Demo
crat had commanded nationwide
attention last September with highly
critical words about Clinton's behav
ior at a time the White House still
hoped to avoid congressional action.
For all the expressions of disgust,
a formal effort to censure the presi
dent appeared all but dead, a victim
of Republican opposition
Three Republicans, Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania, John
Chafee of Rhode Island and James
Jeffords of Vermont, announced on
Wednesday they would not vote for
conviction on either article.
Among Democrats, Senate aides
said the only question was whether
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a
longtime party leader, would break
ranks and join Republicans in voting
to convict.
Controversy broke out over a
report that Clinton had vowed
revenge on House Republicans at
the polls in 2(XX).
"It is deeply troubling that the
president views closure of this con
stitutional process as an opportunity
for revenge," said Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss.
