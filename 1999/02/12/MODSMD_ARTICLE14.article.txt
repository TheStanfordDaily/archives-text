Daily opinions editor
examines paper's role
in campus dialogue

Learning often occurs in
the least likely places. It is
amazing what one can learn in
just two weeks of working as an Opin
ions Editor for The Daily.
These two weeks for me have not
just heen a whirlwind exposure to a
different type of journalistic experi
ence. They have also made me consid
er what role we, as a newspaper, play
in campus life here.
Every editorial, every column and
every letter that you see on these
pages forms the basis of a discussion
forum where members of the commu
nity can make themselves heard in
ways that may be popular or highly
controversial.
The guarantees of the First
Amendment, free speech in particu
lar, is arguably one of the most funda
mentally simple, vet deeply complex
parts of our Constitution. Its reper
cussions permeate all parts of life in
this nation.
Ill is week, we printed several let
ters in regards to the comportment of
the Sixth Man Club at the last Satur
day's game versus Connecticut. It was
argued that the members were an
embarrassment to the ideals of this
University and that their behavior
should not be tolerated.
Are we, as students, given the all
encompassing light to say and do
what we please, whenever we want?
At what point do we cross the line
between acceptable and unaccept
able behavior? Who decides right
versus wrong at a place like Stan
ford?
We are part of a University that
supposedly embraces campus "diver
sity." Diversity is not just something
defined solelv by race or gender, but

also by the ideas and the issues that
each of us is exposed to everyday on
this campus.
Educating students is not just an
academic task. Nor is it solely
extracurricular or social. Part of
building a truly "well-rounded" stu
dent is fostering an environment
where the ideas and issues that pre
dominate cause students to consider
who they are and the values that
define them.
How the Sixth Man handles itself
has enormous implications on how
outsiders view Stanford students. But
their actions can serve an important
purpose. ITiey help to create discus
sion. in many aspects of University
life, that educates not just the student,
but the person.
That's where we come in. Ihe dis
cussion that is an integral part of life
here in many ways begins here. These
pages, unlike other sections whose
purpose is to inform, work to examine
the opinions and ideas that each of us
have.
That freedom of speech that is
granted to each of us outside of this
paper also extends to these pages.
Part of my job as an editor involves
making decisions regarding the daily
content of each of these pages. How
do I do my job appropriately while
still maintaining the spirit and letter of
the First Amendment?
I've spent a lot of time considering
that question. In the end. it will not
be just myself or any editor at this
newspaper, but you, the reader, who
will decide what goes on in this
forum.
Education does happen when you
least expect it. but only when you take
advantage of it. Participate in this
important forum, make your voice
heard.
We will each learn something from
it.
