## Clarifying residential changes 
### 
THE: WORK OF the Residential Pro
grams Implementation Group has
occasioned debate over the issue of
the best possible integration between aca
demic programs and undergraduate hous
ing (one of the goals from the Task Force
on Residential Programs and Student
Housing for Undergraduates).
We welcome the debate, knowing that it
helps us develop the best possible pro
grams.
Given the high stakes and the complexi
ty of our residence program, we are glad
that a special effort was made to bring
together an implementation team that

offered important perspectives.from across
campus: three ASSU-appointed student
representatives, all seniors, including a resi
dent assistant from a freshman dorm; three
faculty, all current or former resident fel
lows; the student coordinator of the advis
ing associate program; and administrators
involved with undergraduate education,
advising and student life.
Despite our efforts to communicate our
plans clearly, recent letters and columns in
The Daily suggest that there are misconcep
tions floating around campus about the
work of the implementation group.
Questions have been raised about how
staff will be trained. Questions have been
raised regarding funding. Questions have
been raised about the participation of
senior faculty. A Daily commentary on
Monday bemoaned the shift to more class
segregated residences.

Here are the facts. College assistants will
go through RA training. There will be peer
health educators and resident computer
coordinators.
The funding for the Freshman/Sopho
more College comes from the academic side
of the University, not Res Ed. (These are
restricted academic dollars that can now be
used in residences because of the Stanford
Introductory Seminars connection.)
We will expand faculty participation in
the residences for a net gain, not reshuffle
existing faculty resources. The number of
four-class houses will increase by two (we
have added them back into the system).
The college, one.of the task (orce recom
mendations we were asked to explore and
implement, is a pilot program that allows us
to explore a new model of building an
undergraduate academic community
through the residence program
Is it a model that presents challenges?
Yes. Are we prepared to meet those chal
lenges? Yes. But only with the essential
ingredient of additional student and faculty
input.
Many pieces of the program will be
developed in consultation with this year's
freshmen who will be sophomore residents
in the college next year, as well as next
year's student staff. There will be a student
faculty advisory board put in place to assist
in shaping the program.
What will the group do for the rest of the
academic year? We will continue to formu
late programs and activities for the college.

We will hold a meeting in early March to
discuss the college with current freshmen;
ideas for programs are welcome then or
through e-mail or calls to us.
We will also make a decision about the
three-tiered Draw — but we want to hear
your opinion before we come to the final
conclusion. The ASSU has agreed to host a
survey on the Web. Tell us how you feel
about moving to a three-tiered system.
Once we make these decisions, we will
begin to bid farewell to the implementation
group. The oversight programs that we have
implemented will be shifted to their rightful
homes.
have spent much time thinking, talk
ing about and strengthening the residential
experience. We have enjoyed the unexpect
ed outcomes (such as all-sophomore
Toyon) as we worked on recommendations,
which ranged from improving the Draw to
increasing the number of freshmen in four
class houses for critical masses to creating
programs to support the academic pursuits
of all our undergraduates.
We hope that our work has, indeed, led
to the best possible integration between
academic programs and undergraduate
housing, and that you, too, will find that our
work was worth it.

James Montoya is Vice Provost for Student
Affairs, and Ramon Saldivar is Vice Provost

mentation Group.
