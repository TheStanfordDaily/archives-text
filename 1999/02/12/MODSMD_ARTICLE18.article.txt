Graduates should participate
I agree with the Daily's Wednesday
editorial emphasizing the importance of
community participation in the provost
selection process; however. I was highly
distressed to find that the discussion of
"student interaction" referred only to
undergraduate students.
No mention was made of the needs and
experiences of graduate students who are
here to be mentored into scholarship and
research or students who are here to learn
professions such as law. business and
medicine.
While it is true that an emphasis on
undergraduate teaching is a feature of any
strong institution, a wide array of top qual
ity graduate programs is crucial for attain
ing a world-class reputation.
()nc needs only to compare the relative
reputations of superb undergraduate
schools such as Reed, Swarthmore, and
my own alma mater. Rice University, to
that of Stanford to see the difference that
a strong graduate program makes.
A good choice for provost should cer
tainly include someone who has had
extensive experience with both graduate
and undergraduate students â€” for exam
ple. someone who has balanced under
graduate teaching and graduate student
mentoring by running a large research
group.
Although undergraduate applications
and acceptance rates continue to rise,
Stanford saw a distressingly large drop in
the graduate acceptance rate last year,
which was a! least partly due to the current

crisis in affordable graduate housing. Dur
ing this past year, many of the worst
effects of the housing crisis were immedi
ately alleviated by provost-led initiatives
to raise the minimum stipend, provide
subsidized housing and build more hous
ing on campus.
A new provost sensitive to the educa
tional and economic needs of graduate
students could continue to follow up on
Provost Condoleezza Rice's housing
efforts, as well as address other areas in
which the needs of graduate and profes
sional students are ignored. These include
libraries that set their hours according to
an academic calendar that most of us do
not follow, deadlines that are irrelevant to
our educational timetables and facilities
that close or reduce hours over the sum
mer when most graduate students are still
here.
I would like to remind The Daily that
even if it does choose to focus on only half
of the student community, it should be
aware that much of the excellent teaching
that Stanford undergraduates receive
comes from graduate students.
A provost sensitive to graduate student
needs to balance personal research with
teaching responsibilities can substantially
impact the educational experiences of all
members of the Stanford student popula
tion.
I find it disheartening that a paper that
claims to have a readership of more than
13,(XX) students so often fails to take more
than half of those students into account.

Sixth Man not entirely evil
Fan support is an integral part of colle
giate basketball. A packed gymnasium and
the crowd's cheers and jeers fuel both home
and visiting teams. As a University of Con
necticut student, I can say that the atmo
sphere at Gampel Pavilion can also reach
high levels of intensity.
While I disagree with the way some fans
chose to participate in the Stanford-Con
necticut basketball game, it is not my place
to criticize them. Rather than write yet
another letter condemning the deplorable
antics committed by several members of the
Sixth Man Club, I would like to commend
those former members of the Sixth Man
Club who have renounced their member
ship in protest over the incident.
When I am reminded of Stanford, 1 will
think of their conscientious act and not the
image displayed on national television this
past Saturday.

I-Hum article was skewed
I read "CIV to I-Hum change reviewed,"
the first of a two part series on the Intro
duction to the Humanities program, and I
question your choice to place it in the news
section of the paper. Rather, it seems that it
would be more appropriate among the
advertisements.
While you have cited program director
Harry Elani, associate director Cheri Ross
and two freshmen who praised the 1-Hum

program, the article mysteriously lacks any
statements from students or faculty who
notice the huge problems that the program
must still reckon with.
I wonder where the reporter looked for
commentary, as in the several conversa
tions I've had on the subject with friends
and faculty, I have had no problem finding
opposition to the program. Rather, I can
count on one hand the number of people
I've spoken to who support the I-Hum pro
gram.
Perhaps an experience I had today will
illustrate my dislike of the 1-Hum program.
A history professor of mine, discussing the
Logical Positivist movement of the 2()th
Century made a reference to Friedrich
Nietzsche, saying afterward, "I assume I
don't need to explain or define Nietzche's
work, as you have most likely had some
contact with him."
Suddenly, I was lost, as I have never
learned a thing about Nietzsche. My fall I-
Hum class placed Stravinsky, Mozart and
Verdi as more integral to my education at
Stanford than Nietzsche. This led me to
think about the holes in my education.
In addition to Nietzsche, I've never read
Milton. Dante or Descartes. I've never read
"The Iliad" or "The Prince" and, other
than the 20 pages of " The Republic" that
appeared in my fall 1-Hum course reader, 1
haven't read any Plato. I spent fall quarter
discussing Verdi's "Otello," Mozart's "Don
Giovanni," and Stravinsky's "Oedipus
Rex."
While interesting, I doubt that these
texts are integral to the future of my educa
