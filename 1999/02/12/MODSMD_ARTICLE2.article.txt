One year after the merger be
tween UC-San Francisco and
Stanford Hospitals, UCSF-Stan
ford Health Care is facing an un
expected shortfall of $10.7 million
in its latest financial quarter.
USHC spokesman Daniel
Berman said that USHC will con
sider cutting costs through layoffs,
early retirement plans and expect
ed attrition rates.
In order to maintain a balanced
budget, USHC plans to revise its
1999 budget in light of the short
fall. Berman said that USHC will
first attempt to reduce costs in the
areas of administration and sup
port. Efforts to reduce costs will
include "looking at layoffs," he
said.
However, Berman emphasized
that no final decision has been
made in respect to layoffs.
"No decision has been made

about what type of cost reduction
will be taken," he said.
Ronnie McKean, member of the
recently organized Service Em
ployees Union International Local
715, was surprised by the news of
the shortfall and the potential lay
offs.
"It seems strange there would
be layoffs after the $38 million sur
plus announced during the merg
er," he said.
McKean did not know if mem
bers of the union would be affected
by the potential layoffs. Members

of the union, which was organized
this past November, include main
tenance workers, nurses' assistants
and clerks.
Peter Van Ettcn, the chief exec
utive officer of USHC, in an inter
view with the Faculty Focus, a
USHC publication, said that the re
cent merger of UCSF and Stanford
did not contribute to the shortfall.
"The merger has provided and
will continue to provide the oppor
tunities to improve both financial
performance and patient care,"
Van Etten said.
Berman attributed the shortfall
to decreasing governmental fund
ing of uninsured patients as well as
low rates paid by HMOs. As a re

suit of legislation passed in 1997,
government support of uninsured
patients and academic hospitals
will be phased out over the next six
years,
The reduction in spending on
uninsured patients impacts USHC
because of the large number of
uninsured patients it treats,
"Fifty percent of our patients
are covered by public programs,"
Berman said.
According to Berman, USHC
faces an $80 million dollar annual
shortfall for treating Medi-Cal pa
tients. USHC will further lose $170
million over the next five years as a
result of decreases in Medicare
spending.

In addition to the decrease in
government funding, Berman said
that the shortfall stems from the
low rates paid by HMOs in Califor
nia.
"California has some of the low
est HMO ratea in the nation,"
Berman said. He said that USHC is
in near-constant negotiation with
HMOs over rates but that the re
sults of these discussions cannot be
revealed.
Berman said he does not believe
that Stanford is the only hospital
affected by the changes in govern
ment funding. "California hospitals
on average lost 2.6 percent [of their
operating margin] last year," he
said.
