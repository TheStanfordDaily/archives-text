## No. 6 Stanford bounces back Tough Bruins put up fight 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Looking at the score in last
night's 77-73 victory by the sixth
ranked Stanford men's basketball
team against No. 9 UCLA, one
may think that the Cardinal is still
in a slump, perhaps reeling from its
loss to UConn last Saturday.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford 77, No,
9 UCLA 73.

Think again.
Stanford did just about every
thing right in the second half and
looked to regain its offensive
rhythm and shooting touch.
The only problem was that the
Bruins were just as tough and re
fused to go away quietly.
UCLA (17-6. 8-4 Pacific 10
Conference) made the game excit
ing until the final buzzer by nailing
a string of amazing three-pointers.
But the Cardinal (20-4. 10-1) was
just too tough from the free throw
line down the stretch, nailing its
last 12 opportunities.
Stanford, which shot itself in
the foot against UConn by missing
12 of 24 from the charity stripe,
came back strong and iced the
game with free throws.
"That was a great victory for
us," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "I really
thought we hung in there and
played well in the second half. It
was a hard-fought win."
For the first 20 minutes of the
game, however, things did not
look so promising for the Cardi
nal.
The Bruins led by as many as 10
points — despite foul trouble that
sent center Dan Gadzuric to the
bench for most of the half — and
looked ready to hand the Cardinal
a devastating second straight loss.
Enter David Moseley.
