## No. 6 Stanford bounces back Tough Bruins put up fight 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Looking at the score in last
night's 77-73 victory by the sixth
ranked Stanford men's basketball
team against No. 9 UCLA, one
may think that the Cardinal is still
in a slump, perhaps reeling from its
loss to UConn last Saturday.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford 77, No,
9 UCLA 73.

Think again.
Stanford did just about every
thing right in the second half and
looked to regain its offensive
rhythm and shooting touch.
The only problem was that the
Bruins were just as tough and re
fused to go away quietly.
UCLA (17-6. 8-4 Pacific 10
Conference) made the game excit
ing until the final buzzer by nailing
a string of amazing three-pointers.
But the Cardinal (20-4. 10-1) was
just too tough from the free throw
line down the stretch, nailing its
last 12 opportunities.
Stanford, which shot itself in
the foot against UConn by missing
12 of 24 from the charity stripe,
came back strong and iced the
game with free throws.
"That was a great victory for
us," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "I really
thought we hung in there and
played well in the second half. It
was a hard-fought win."
For the first 20 minutes of the
game, however, things did not
look so promising for the Cardi
nal.
The Bruins led by as many as 10
points — despite foul trouble that
sent center Dan Gadzuric to the
bench for most of the half — and
looked ready to hand the Cardinal
a devastating second straight loss.
Enter David Moseley.

ley nailed a 19 foot jumper for (wo
of his eight first-half points.
Despite Moseley's efforts, Stan
ford made just 27 percent of its
shots from the field in the first half
and went into the locker room trail
ing 26-24.
More depressing than the score
was the fact that the Cardinal
looked tentative on offense and flat
on defense.
Luckily, the defense — and
everything else, for that matter —
picked up in the second half.
Less than a minute in. Lee
drained a three-pointer from the
top of the key to cut the Bruin lead
to one.
And by the first television time
out at 15:55. both Kris Weems and
Peter Sauer had also hit threes to
knott the score at 35.
On the first possession after that
timeout, Lee stripped UCLA cen
ter Dan Gad/uric in the paint and
took off running on a fast break.
The Cardinal floor general dished
beautifully to a streaking Weems
who converted the layup to give the
Cardinal its first lead since opening
the game up 2-0.

The Bruins would never be
ahccfdUgSin.
But they were certainly close.
Twice in the final five minutes,
Bruin forward Jerome Moiso hit a
pair of free throws to cut the Stan
ford lead to one.
The first time, Moseley an
swered with a three.
The second, with just 41 seconds
remaining, set the stage for a pair of
dramatic free throws from Mark
Madsen.
Madsen had missed 5 of 8 free
throws against UConn — and
hadn't stopped practicing since.
The practice paid off and Mad
Dog was perfect on both.
But that was hardly the end of
the drama, as the Bruins answered
a pair of freebies by Art Lee with a
three from Davis, with just 14 ticks
left.
Twelve seconds and four more
Stanford free throws later, Jaron
Rush — who finished with 20
points — hit his fourth three-point
er of the game to cut the lead to
two.
It was too little, too late for
UCLA, though, as Lee hit the final
two free throws to seal the deal.
"I'd like to compliment (UCLA
head coach] Steve [Lavin]," Mont
gomery said. "UCLA played very

good basketball. We're taking peo
ple's best sh&ts." I
Lee led the Cardinal with 17
points, while Tim Young had 12
points and nine boards. Madsen
scored 11 and grabbed 12 re
bounds, including eight on the of
fensive end.
But the most pleasant surprise
was Moseley, who chipped in with
13 points and seven rebounds off
the bench.
"I've been missing for a while,"
Moseley said.
"My face has been on the milk
carton. I felt like I needed to step in
and help the team win, and I did
that."
Last night, the Cardinal did in
deed answer many of the questions
that hung over the team after Sat
urday's loss.
"For them to come through
those past five games 3-2. that's
good," Lavin said.
"I see that as they're a heck of a
basketball team. ... Every team
hits the wall in terms of fatigue, and
that happened to Stanford. But it's
not like they're losing to patsies.
"Stanford remains the team to
beat, and probably the one seed in
the West unless there's some dra
matic shifting in the next couple
weeks."

Stanford free throws later, Jaron
Rush — who finished with 20
points — hit his fourth three-point
er of the game to cut the lead to
two.
It was too little, too late for
UCLA, though, as Lee hit the final
two free throws to seal the deal.
"I'd like to compliment (UCLA
head coach] Steve [Lavin]," Mont
gomery said. "UCLA played very

good basketball. We're taking peo

Lee led the Cardinal with 17
points, while Tim Young had 12
points and nine boards. Madsen
scored 11 and grabbed 12 re
bounds, including eight on the of
fensive end.
But the most pleasant surprise
was Moseley, who chipped in with
13 points and seven rebounds off
the bench.
"I've been missing for a while,"
Moseley said.
"My face has been on the milk
carton. I felt like I needed to step in
and help the team win, and I did
that."
Last night, the Cardinal did in
deed answer many of the questions
that hung over the team after Sat
urday's loss.
"For them to come through
those past five games 3-2. that's
good," Lavin said.
"I see that as they're a heck of a
basketball team. ... Every team
hits the wall in terms of fatigue, and
that happened to Stanford. But it's
not like they're losing to patsies.
"Stanford remains the team to
beat, and probably the one seed in
the West unless there's some dra
matic shifting in the next couple
weeks."
