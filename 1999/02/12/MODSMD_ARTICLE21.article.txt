The No. 1 Stanford men's tennis
team will take on Northwestern
today at 1:30 p.m. at the Taube Fam
ily Tennis Stadium. The team will
also face Rice tomorrow at noon at
Taube.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Today: No. 1 Stanford (2-0) vs
Northwestern (2-1), 1:30 p.m.
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Rice (3-
1), noon, Taube.

Northwestern (2-1) enters
today's match ranked 37th, and it is
always one of the tougher teams in
the Big Ten Conference. With the
No. 3 starter for the Cardinal (2-0),
sophomore Alex Kim, unlikely to
play in either match due to a stress
fracture, the team will be forced to

raise its level and give different play
ers match experience.
The two players that are most
likely to step in for Kini are junior
Vijay Sekhan and junior David
Houser. Head coach Dick Gould
believes the weekend will be a good
test as to how the Cardinal reacts to
injuries.
"It will be telling to see how we
react without Alex," Gould said.
"Injuries can happen at any time
throughout the year, and you have
to be prepared for them and have
guys ready to step in to do the job. I
think whoever steps in will be pre
pared and will do fine."
Gould believes that sometimes
injuries can provide a positive by
getting players who normally
wouldn't compete into the starting
lineup. If any of those players are
then forced to step in later in the sea
son, they will be more confident and
experienced under the pressure of a
match.
Sophomore Ali Ansari agreed.
"It will be a good experience for who
ever steps in."he said. "It is impor
tant for those who normally wouldn't
play to get match experience. That
could be big down the road."
In today's match, Northwestern is
led by its No. 1 player, Mark Silva, as
well as Dan Bohayboy. Bohayboy, a
graduate of Palo Alto High School, is
ranked No. 48 in the nation. Both are
solid players with big serves and the
potential to beat anyone at any time.
Cardinal sophomore Scotty Scott
also believes the weekend will be a
good test for the Cardinal. "It will be
a test to see how well we play as a
team and whether we can pick up our
level of play as the season progress
es," said Scott.

It has been two weeks since the
Cardinal's last team match. After a
pair of big wins against Washington
and Oregon on the road two weeks
ago, the team looks to continue its
momentum.
Ansari said. "Two wins this week
end would be nice heading into the
[National Team Indoors] next week.
It would be something to build on."
The Cardinal leaves Wednesday
for the Indoors in Washington. The
tournament will provide a good test
for the team to see where it stands in
comparison to the best teams around
the nation.
Even if it wins today against
Northwestern, though, the team
must be very careful not to let up
against a pesky Rice (3-1) squad to
morrow. Rice heads into Saturday's
match ranked 49th and is led by Efe
Ustandag, who is ranked 15th in the
nation. He defeated Stanford's, K.J.
Hippensteel, last weekend at the
Rolex Indoor Tournament.
