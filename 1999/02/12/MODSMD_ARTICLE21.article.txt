Taube Family Tennis Stadium.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Rice (3-

Northwestern (2-1) enters
today's match ranked 37th, and it is
always one of the tougher teams in

No. 3 starter for the Cardinal (2-0),
sophomore Alex Kim, unlikely to
play in either match due to a stress
fracture, the team will be forced to

raise its level and give different play
ers match experience.
The two players that are most
likely to step in for Kini are junior
Vijay Sekhan and junior David
Houser. Head coach Dick Gould
believes the weekend will be a good
test as to how the Cardinal reacts to
injuries.
"It will be telling to see how we
react without Alex," Gould said.
"Injuries can happen at any time
throughout the year, and you have
to be prepared for them and have
guys ready to step in to do the job. I
think whoever steps in will be pre
pared and will do fine."
Gould believes that sometimes
injuries can provide a positive by
getting players who normally
wouldn't compete into the starting
lineup. If any of those players are
then forced to step in later in the sea
son, they will be more confident and
