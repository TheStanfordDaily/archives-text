San Diego's Zuzana Lesenarova
may have lost to Stanford freshman
Marissa Irvin last weekend at the In
tercollegiate Tennis Association's
Rolex Indoor Championships in
Dallas, but she's still the top-ranked
player in the nation.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Yesterday: No. 5 Stanford 9
Pacific 0.

■ Today: Stanford vs. San Diego
(W>*ibp.m.,Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.

Today, Lesenarova, along with
her the rest of her teammates, will
venture from San Diego to the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium in
hopes of a victory against the fifth
ranked Cardinal, which now sports
a 7-0 dual match record.
"San Diego is the best team

we've played so far," said Head
Coach Frank Brennan. "They're
real tough."
Irvin remembers having to play
some of her best tennis to upset
Lesenarova in three sets in the semi
finals of the Rolex Indoor Champi
onships.
"I played really aggressive and I
was executing well," she said. "She's
a very tenacious player and I don't
doubt her abilities."
Lesenarova might be especially
motivated coming into today's
match considering Irvin stopped her
from taking three collegiate Grand
Slams in a row.
Irvin. however, is determined to
prove her triumph wasn't a fluke. Of
course, few onlookers doubt Irvin's
ability — most believe that she'll
eventually assume the No. 1 ranking
in women's collegiate tennis.
"I was really excited to beat
[Lesenarova]," Irvin said. "She's
older and no one's done it in a Grand
Slam and she's a top foreign player. I
just wanted to stop her from getting
three titles in a row."
Irvin now boasts a 21-2 match
record for the season. She has won
her last 13 matches.
"My confidence has grown,'' she
said. "But I have to remember to
keep everything in perspective."
Brennan is thoroughly impressed
with Irvin, one of the top recruits in
Stanford tennis history.
"Marissa's amazing," he said. "It's
nice to have a really dominant No. 1.
It rubs off on the rest of the players."
Irvin was the top-ranked junior in
the country before heading to the
Farm and could have easily chosen to
play professionally right after high
school.
She felt that forgoing Stanford's

educational opportunities, however,
would have been a mistake.
Irvin said, "I'm in no rush to play
pro tennis. When I will choose to do
it is unsure."
Brennan hopes to hang on to
Irvin's talent for as long as possible.
Of course, there are eight other tal
ented players on the Cardinal squad.
One of them is junior captain Teryn
Ashley, who reached the semifinals
of the Rolex Championships, upset
ting second seed Vanessa Webb of
Duke in the process.
"Ashley's really starting to estab
lish herself," Brennan said. "She's
playing mentally tough and exhibit
ing her talents."
Brennan is eagerly anticipating
the San Diego match. After the per
formance of his top two singles play
ers at the Rolex Championships, his
confidence is high.
"I'm even a little more encour
aged then 1 was last week," he said.
"We're gaining strength."
