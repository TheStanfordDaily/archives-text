# Top-ranked Stanford battles all comers down South
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
The No. 1 Stanford women's
water polo team (1-0) will get a
good look at the nation's top com
petition this weekend as the squad
travels to Southern California for
the UC-San Diego Invitational
Tournament.
"All the top teams are in [the
tournament]," said Stanford head
coach John Tanner. "Certainly all
of the top 10 will be there."
Stanford's first match of the
weekend pits the Cardinal against
No. 10 San Jose State at 5 p.m.
today. Then Stanford takes on No. 6

UC-Santa Barbara at 9 a.m. tomor
row. Both San Jose and UCSB have
improved since last year and should
provide Stanford with some compe
tition.

Tournament.

"There are a lot of teams that
have improved a lot," Tanner said.
"It should he a very competetive
tournament."
The Cardinal will play an addi
tional game tomorrow and two on
Sunday. The times and opponents

will be decided based on the first
round games. But Stanford should
have the advantage of a little extra
confidence after its huge victory last
weekend. In a 4-3 upset, Stanford
defeated then-No. 1 UCLA and
proved the Cardinal team was
ready to begin a strong season of
play.
In spite of the win, the Cardinal
was seeded third for this weekend's
tournament. Rounding out the top
of the field are No. 2 California, No.
3 USC, the No. 4 Bruins, No. 5
Hawaii, No. 7 San Diego State, No.
8 Massachusetts, No. 9 IJC-Davis
and host No. 12 UC-San Diego.
"All the teams are pretty closely

matched," Tanner said. "I think
USC is going to be the best team.
And UCLA, Cal and [our team] are
in the next tier. But Santa Barbara,
Hawaii, Davis, San Diego State and
San Jose State have all improved a
lot. Every game has the potential to
be a close one. Every game could
come down to the wire."
Because it's the first tournament
of the year and the regular season
has only just begun, Stanford has
still been using its practice time to
focus on the fundamentals.
"We've been working on our of
fense, our defense, 6-on-5, 5-on-6
and our counterattack," Tanner
said. "But it's still early in the sea

son so we still have a big emphasis
on individual skills."
Last weekend already showed
that the Cardinal has plenty of tal
ent to carry it through a successful
season. The seniors on the squad —
goalie Heather Crary, two-meter
defender Nicole Glazer, and dri
ver / hole-set Lindsay Tam — were
instrumental in the win by provid
ing strong play and effective leader
ship. All of the returning players
turned in excellent performances,
and freshmen Margie Dingeldein
and Kate Pettit were outstanding in
their first collegiate match.
Now, with one game under its
but, the Cardinal coaching staff will

look to try some new combinations
to see how all the skills of its indi
vidual players are going to come to
gether.
"Everyone is going to get to
play," Tanner said. "We're going to
see how different people do in dif
ferent situations."
This weekend's tournament
should provide the Cardinal with a
good opportunity to both size up
the competition and target any
weak spots in its own play.
"This is the first tournament of
the year," Tanner said. "We're
going to have the chance to play in a
lot of games and evaluate how
we're doing so far."
