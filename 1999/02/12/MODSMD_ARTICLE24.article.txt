WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Today: No. 7 Stanford (5-1) at
Washington (4-5), 7 p.m.

Last season, after winning the
first Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship in school history, the Cardi
nal traveled north to the Hec Ed
mundson Pavilion on the Universi
ty of Washington campus to com
pete as a favorite in the NCAA Re
gional Tournament.
After a solid performance on

the first three apparatus, it ap
peared as if the Cardinal would he
making a trip to the NCAA nation
al tournament.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
there were four apparatus and
Stanford saw its national champi
onship hopes disappear during an
uncharacteristically shaky beam
rotation.
And so tonight, as the Cardinal
travels north to compete against
Pac-10 rival Washington (4-5) in a
quadrangle meet with UC-Davis
and Seattle Pacific University, re
memberances of last season's
NCAA Regionals can't be far from
the mind of every Stanford gym
nast.
"One of our goals is to finish
what we started last year at Re
gionals," said second-year Stan
ford head coach Mark Cook.

"We really rocked on the first
three events and then the beam was
our weakest event. We'd like to go
up there and do really well on
beam."
In addition to avenging last
year's performance at the Region
al, the Cardinal will be looking to
extend its four-meet winning
streak that has placed it in the thick
of the national championship race.
Stanford enters tonight's meet
performing at its highest level of
the season and riding the momen
tum from last Friday night's victo
ries over then-No. 5 Penn State and
No. 10 UCLA.
Last week against the Bruins
and Lady Lions, Cardinal senior
co-captain Amy Murakami turned
in yet another outstanding perfor-

mance en route to a first place fin
ish on the uneven parallel bars
(9.950) and a second place finish in
the floor exercise (9.875) that
clinched the team title for the Car
dinal.
Sophomore Jen Exaltacion
headlines the Cardinal attack on
the beam, her best event, and may

enter the all-around competition
for the second straight week. Ex
altacion has been among the most
consistent Cardinal gymnasts on
the beam.
Last week against UCLA and
Penn State, Exaltacion took home
second place honors on the balance
beam (9.850), uneven parallel bars
(9.900) and in the all-around com
petition (39.075) — the highest
Stanford all around score of the
season.

The Huskies come into tonight's
meet without the services of six
time Ail-American Tiffany Simp
son who has a stress fracture in her
right leg. and while the Huskies
have been struggling of late, they
still could pose problems for the
Cardinal.
"They've been struggling but
they're definitely a good team and
I'm sure that they'll give us good
competition," said Cardinal senior
co-captain Tracy Kohl.
