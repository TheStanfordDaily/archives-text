MEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Today: Stanford (2-4, 1-4 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) vs.
Cal State-Northridge (1-5, 1-4), 7
p.m., Burnham Pavilion.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. No. 15
UC-Santa Barbara (3-3,3-2), 7 p.m.,
Burnham.

For three consecutive week
ends, the Stanford men's volleyball
team (2-4, 1-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) has competed
against opponents ranked among
the nation's elite and has estab

lished a dismal conference record

But the team faces an even
more difficult challenge this week
end.
After junior outside hitter Andy
Witt's decision to leave the team
earlier this week, the outcome of
this weekend's games will test
Stanford's ability to adjust to play
without the All-Ameriean starter.
Witt's decision comes at a criti
cal point in Stanford's season. A
few weeks ago, the Cardinal kicked
off MPSF competition with the
goal of winning matches to posi
tion itself at (he top of the Pacific
Division of the MPSF. Now, the
Cardinal must improve its rough
start so that the team will be able to
qualify for the MPSF Champi
onships, which begin in late April.
Stanford will attempt the turn
around when it takes on the un
ranked Cal State-Northridge Mata
dors (1-5, 1-4 MPSF) Friday and
the No. 15 UC- Santa Barbara Gau
chos (3-3. 2-3 MPSF) Saturday at
Burnham Pavilion
Although the Matadors and
Gauchos do not have records as
strong as some of the Card's earlier
opponents, Stanford is at a vulnera
ble position in the season. Not only
has Witt left the team, but the sta
tus of another consistent contribu
tor also remains ambiguous.
Sophomore middle blocker Dan
Zhang received stitches to a knee
injury last weekend. Although his
practice ability has been limited.

Zhang's condition is listed as prob
able for tonight's game. In Zhang's
absence, senior team captain Jere
my Bart will most likely come into
the game.
Introducing new starters into
the game will require others to as
sume new roles. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, Witt's position is one of
depth and talent for Stanford.
"With Andy not playing, we are
more prepared than one might
think," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves.
Perhaps the one person most
likely to help fill the void will be se
nior outside hitter Patrick Klein.
After coming off the bench in criti
cal match situations. Klein has been
an effective Cardinal attacker.
"Patrick Klein has been the
most productive outside hitter on
the court," said Nieves. "Based on
his performance this season, we
were going to have to get Patrick

into the starting lineup one way or
another."
Klein, who consistently seems to
bring an emotional lift to the team,
will try to continue this trend as the
team deals with Witt's absence.
The Cardinal has an entire arse
nal of outside hitters who will be
able to contribute.
Junior Gabe Gardner, who
trained with the US National Team
the past two summers, is a consis
tent starter at this position. Marcus
Skacel, although only a freshman,
has received playing time as well.
Junior Josh Palacios, who also
plays at the middle blocker position
for the Cardinal, has training at the
outside hitter position.
But those are not all the adjust
ments that Witt's departure will en
tail.
"Everyone in general will have
to play a larger role," said sopho
more setter Brad Griffith.

The first opportunity to assume
new roles will be tonight when
Stanford takes on the Matadors.
Northridge has had its own strug
gles this season. Continuing the re
building process after having its
volleyball program cut and then re
instated. the Matadors have earned
only one victory this season.
The Cardinal face a more formi
dable challenger tomorrow night
when it takes on the Gauchos.
UCSB, like Stanford, is trying to
position itself to be competitive
within the MPSF.
"Although Santa Barbara is a
young team, they have a lot to
prove," said Nieves. "They have a
program that is competitive each
and every year and find a way to be
tough."
Being tough and competitive de
spite adversity is also what the Car
dinal will try to prove they can do
this weekend.
The Cardinal's struggles have
only just begun.
