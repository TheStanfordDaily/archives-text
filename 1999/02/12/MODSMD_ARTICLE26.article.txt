The Broncos didn't give the Stan
ford defense much of a challenge, as

they were held to four hits and no
runs by senior pitchers Becky Blevins
and Marcy Crouch. Meanwhile, the
Cardinal teed off on Santa Clara,
scoring a combined 16 runs in both
games.
But Pacific (1-0) looks to provide
much stiffer competition for Stan
ford. The Tigers lost much of the staff
that put them one win away from last
season's College World Series, but
still figure to be a tough matchup for
the Cardinal.
" They're a team that was one win
away from the College World Series
last year," said Cardinal head coach
John Rittman. "Defensively we need
to work on our communication. We
definitely didn't get tested a lot [by
Santa Clara], Pacific's got some good
speed and some pretty good hitters."
The Tigers trounced San Jose
State 9-0 in their opening game at the
Spartan Early Bird Tournament be
fore the rest of the matches were can

celed due to rain.
Tiger freshman Cindy Bell threw
a two-hitter in the five-inning game,
and Erica Reynolds scored two runs
while going 3 for 3 at the plate. An
gela Davis had two RBIs on her 2-
for-3 hatting.
But the Cardinal has also found an
offensive punch. Freshman Jessica
Mendoza broke out in her first colle
giate game, knocking in four runs on
3-of-4 hitting. Five other Cardinal
players helped the effort with at least
two RBIs in the two games.
And of course, the Cardinal also
has reliable pitching.
Blevins and Crouch will once
again get the starts for Stanford, es
pecially since freshman left-hander
Susan Winkelman is out indefinitely
with a stress fracture in her right foot
— her landing foot.
Blevins broke her own school
record by fanning 12 Broncos in her
one-hit complete game, and Crouch
sprinkled three hits through her six
scoreless innings in game two.
"I think we got good momentum,
and that's what we're trying to keep
up right now," Blevins said. "We
started off with two good games,
which is good going into a tough
weekend like this one.
"UOP is a very good team. We
split with them last year and they
swept us at home two years ago."
Rittman has enough confidence
with his two seniors not to let the loss
of Winkelman rattle him too much.
"They both know the situation,"
he said. "They're both gamers and
very competitive. They've been
doing this for their first three years, so
[their starting] is no secret, to us or
[the opponents]."
St. Mary's (0-6) has stumbled out
of the gate, getting swept in double

headers against Sonoma State, Loy
ola Marymount and the University of
San Diego. The Gaels have been
outscored by a combined total of 46-
15.
But the Cardinal isn't about to
look past any opponent.
"These are two tough games com
ing up." Blevins said. "I don't think
we have any easy games this year,
and St. Mary's is the kind of team that
can beat anybody on any day."
Though the offense was prolific
against Santa Clara, Rittman is still
looking for ways the team can im
prove its output from the plate.
"I think there are a few little
things we need." said Rittman. "Of
fensively we need to work on hitting
the ball to the opposite field. [Against
Santa Clara], we had three doubles
which were hit to the opposite field or
up the middle, which is good. For us
to be successful offensively we have
to be able to hit that outside pitch.
"We've also done a good job of
laying off the stuff that's out of the
zone."
