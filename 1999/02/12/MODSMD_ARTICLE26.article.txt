The Broncos didn't give the Stan
ford defense much of a challenge, as

they were held to four hits and no
runs by senior pitchers Becky Blevins
and Marcy Crouch. Meanwhile, the
Cardinal teed off on Santa Clara,
scoring a combined 16 runs in both
games.
But Pacific (1-0) looks to provide
much stiffer competition for Stan
ford. The Tigers lost much of the staff
that put them one win away from last
season's College World Series, but
still figure to be a tough matchup for
the Cardinal.
" They're a team that was one win
away from the College World Series
last year," said Cardinal head coach
John Rittman. "Defensively we need
to work on our communication. We
definitely didn't get tested a lot [by
Santa Clara], Pacific's got some good
speed and some pretty good hitters."
The Tigers trounced San Jose
State 9-0 in their opening game at the
Spartan Early Bird Tournament be
fore the rest of the matches were can

celed due to rain.
Tiger freshman Cindy Bell threw
a two-hitter in the five-inning game,
and Erica Reynolds scored two runs
while going 3 for 3 at the plate. An
gela Davis had two RBIs on her 2-
for-3 hatting.
But the Cardinal has also found an
offensive punch. Freshman Jessica
Mendoza broke out in her first colle
giate game, knocking in four runs on
3-of-4 hitting. Five other Cardinal
players helped the effort with at least
two RBIs in the two games.
And of course, the Cardinal also
has reliable pitching.
Blevins and Crouch will once
again get the starts for Stanford, es
pecially since freshman left-hander
Susan Winkelman is out indefinitely
with a stress fracture in her right foot
— her landing foot.
Blevins broke her own school
