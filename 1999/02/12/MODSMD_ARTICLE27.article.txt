# No. 10 Cardinal faces scrappy Santa Clara
## Three-game weekend series should test team's resolve and offensive production 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Most college students can look
forward to the weekend as an almost
mythical time of rest, relaxation and
fun. For Stanford baseball players
the weekend is much different. It is
certainly a nice break from classes
but. until June, it will afford the Car
dinal few times to rest or relax.
No. 10 Stanford (4-3) does not
start its demanding Pacific 10 Con
ference schedule for a while, but
only two weeks into the season, it is

getting used to weekends full of
hard-lought games versus quality
opponents. I'he Cardinal was lucky
to make it out of its first two series
versus Fresno State and No. 17 Cal
Stale-Fullerton with a .500 record.
The schedule provides little rest
for the wcarv, though. Fresh off a 5-
0 win over St. Mary's Wednesday
night, the Cardinal takes on Santa
Clara (1-3) Saturday, Sunday and
Monday.
"I'm concerned every weekend,"
said Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "The people that we play on

the weekends will beat us if we don't
play well. They arc all that caliber of
team and Santa Clara's no excep
tion."
Although Stanford breaks up its
schedule with some easier oppo
nents during the week, there seems
to be an almost constant barrage of
good teams tin the weekends.
"It's good," Marquess said. "If
you're not ready to play or you don't
hit the hall or don't pitch well, you'll
get beat. That's not always the great
est thing, but it prepares you for the
postseason if you're good enough to

get that far."
While the Broncos come into the
series sporting a losing record, all
three of their losses have come by
one run. Two of the three came
against Fresno State, which also beat
Stanford twice early on. Santa Clara
actually outscored the Bulldogs, 15-
11, in the three-game series, but
could only come away with the series
opener.
"Santa Clara always plays
tough," Marquess said. "They're es
pecially tough to beat at home and
we've got to play two there this

weekend. It'll be a good series."
It'll be especially good for Stan
ford if the Cardinal hitters can final
ly put together a consistent three
game series. Although the offense
has shown signs of life in the last two
games, especially in Sunday's seven
run second inning, it has yet to see
good production throughout the
lineup.
Junior catcher Damien Alvarado
has been one of the few stars at the
plate for the Cardinal, going 5 for 7
with seven RBIs in the last two
games to raise his season average to
.364. Senior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang and junior center field
er Edmund Muth have also started
the year strong, batting .357 and
.393, respectively.

Junior first baseman John Gall
has been the most disappointing hit
ter for the Cardinal so far. Gall en
tered the season as Stanford's all
time leading batter and a preseason
first team All-American. Gall,
though, has yet to live up to the lofty
expectations, hitting only .214 with
two RBIs. However, few expect him
to go the entire season without
breaking out of his slump.
In tomorrow's game at Santa
Clara, sophomore Justin Wayne (0-
1. 7.82 ERA) will probably start for
the Cardinal. The right-hander has
the talent and the experience to be
the No. 1 starter; he was 6-0 with six
saves and a 3.81 ERA last season.
However, he has yet to put together
a consistent outing this year, giving
up 11 runs on 16 hits in a little less
than 13 innings on the mound.
Santa Clara senior Vince Boy
anich (0-0,1.84 ERA) will square off
against Wayne Saturday. With 50ca

enced member of a deep Broncos
staff. Last year, he went 5-6 in 15
starts and kept opposing batters to a
West ( oast Conference-low .249
hatting average.
Sunday, freshman Mike Gosling
(1-0. 1.42 ERA) will go for the Car

dinal as the series comes to Stan
ford's Sunken Diamond for one
game. Gosling, a left-hander with a
live fastball, has only one start, a
poor showing last Sunday versus
Fullerton. In just over three innings.
Gosling allowed eight hits and live
runs, although only one of those was
earned.

six innings, the right-hander allowed
only three hits and struck out a ca

ford if the Cardinal hitters can final
ly put together a consistent three
game series. Although the offense
has shown signs of life in the last two
games, especially in Sunday's seven
run second inning, it has yet to see
good production throughout the
lineup.
Junior catcher Damien Alvarado
has been one of the few stars at the
plate for the Cardinal, going 5 for 7
with seven RBIs in the last two
games to raise his season average to
.364. Senior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang and junior center field
er Edmund Muth have also started
the year strong, batting .357 and
.393, respectively.

Junior first baseman John Gall
has been the most disappointing hit
ter for the Cardinal so far. Gall en
tered the season as Stanford's all
time leading batter and a preseason
first team All-American. Gall,
though, has yet to live up to the lofty
expectations, hitting only .214 with
two RBIs. However, few expect him
to go the entire season without
breaking out of his slump.
In tomorrow's game at Santa
Clara, sophomore Justin Wayne (0-
1. 7.82 ERA) will probably start for
the Cardinal. The right-hander has
the talent and the experience to be
the No. 1 starter; he was 6-0 with six
saves and a 3.81 ERA last season.
However, he has yet to put together
a consistent outing this year, giving
up 11 runs on 16 hits in a little less
than 13 innings on the mound.

Sunday, freshman Mike Gosling

ford's Sunken Diamond for one

live fastball, has only one start, a
poor showing last Sunday versus

Gosling allowed eight hits and live
runs, although only one of those was
earned.
