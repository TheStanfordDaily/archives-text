# Depleted men face old foes

Although Stanford has beaten
both Air Force and UC-Santa
Barbara earlier this season, this
weekend they will be forced to try
to do it again without one of their
best gymnasts — junior Jason
Katsampes.
Katsampes finished among the
top three in four events and
placed first in the high bar with a
score of 9.5 in last weekend's
BYU Invitational. He will travel
to Las Vegas to compete in the
Winter Cup today and tomorrow.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Today-Tomorrow: No. 13 Stan
ford at Winter Cup Tournament.

■ Sunday: No. 13 Stanford vs. UC-
Santa Barbara & No. 15 Air Force,
1 p,m„ Burnham Pavilion.

The meet, which is hosted by
Nevada, is not officially a NCAA
meet. Therefore, the No. 13 Car
dinal (0-1) will send only one rep
resentative in the form of Katsam
pes. He will probably not return to
Stanford in time to compete in
Sunday's meet against UC-Santa
Barbara and No. 15 Air Force.
Nevertheless, even with the ab
sence of Katsampes, the team be
lieves it can still pull out another
home victory.
"If we do our job," said junior
Craig Nesbitt, "it shouldn't be a
difficult match."
What will be crucial in this
match is the performance of the
six freshmen on the team, who will
need to hit even more routines
than in their recent performances.
"Our goal is to hit more rou
tines." Nesbitt said. "Right now
we're not even hitting a third of
our routines; we need to get to the
point where we're hitting more
like half of our routines."
The gymnasts are having trou
ble finishing their routines be
cause of their difficulty; the men
have been learning and perform
ing the most difficult routines
early in the season so as to prepare
for later, more important meets.
Although some of their early sea
son outings have been rockier
than others, later in the season the
team feels their work will pay off
in preparedness for more difficult
meets
Also critical, in addition to pre
cision routines, will be the perfor
mance of junior Jason Biltz, who
will need to step up in the absence
of Katsampes. As one of the few
upperclassmen on this mostly in
experienced squad, he shoulders
