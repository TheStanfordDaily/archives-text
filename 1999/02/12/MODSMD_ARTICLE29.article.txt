# Fouls offer sweet redemption

And now for something com
pletely different.
Stanford hits its free throws in
the clutch, its opponent doesn't.
Something seem a bit odd?
After being ripped on all season for
missing far too many free throws,
the Cardinal nailed 12 shots from
the line off of 12 attempts, to defeat
the "never say die" UCLA Bruins
77-73.
While Stanford went 91.7 per
cent from the charity stripe in the
second half and UCLA only hit 64
percent, there might have been one
aspect to this statistic that was even
more impressive — not only did
Stanford hit its free throws down
the line, Murk Madsen hit his free
throws down the line.
"In the [Connecticut] game, we
were all frustrated with the loss. I
was especially frustrated missing
four free throws in the stretch,"
Madsen said.
This game would be a different
story for the junior forward.
With the Cardinal up by one and
less than a minute on the clock,
UCLA's Ray Young fouled Mad
sen and sent him to the line.
Stanford guard David Moseley
had just hit two. Arthur Lee and
Kris Weems would go on to hit a
combined eight in a stretch of 19
seconds. But with Madsen on the
line, there was tension in the air.
"Mark's a tough kid," said Stan
ford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "He steps up and every
body is holding their breath. He hits
two big ones.
"He can shoot free throws, he
just needs to get the confidence."
Bruin head coach Steve Lavin
called him Superman and struggled
to find someone who could shut
down Madsen last night. In addition
to scoring 11 points and grabbing 12
rebounds, the forward hit his free
throws.
"I saw Madsen practicing free
throws [earlier]," Lavin said.

"Maybe it was a dream, or a night
mare. They all went in."
Last night, however, was real.
Madsen's campaign to get back
on track at the line after averaging
56.1 percent during the previous 23
games, however, has not been a solo
one. It seemed as if he was recruit
ing just about anybody he could
find to help him out.
"I've been trying to get a lot of
extra reps in before practice, after
practice and on my own time,"
Madsen said.
Yesterday morning, he found a
Fox cameraman working in Maples
Pavilion at 9 a.m.
"1 recruited him to rebound for a
little while," Madsen said.
Three days prior, Madsen had
the whole team jumping, shouting,
dancing, beating their chests and

trying to distract him while shooting
during practice.
"I didn't see them at all." he
laughed.
"The guys just get behind me,"
Madsen said. "II you miss a shot,
they're still going to have confi
dence."
Someone even suggested he
shoot underhand. Not going to hap
pen. he replied with a smile.
Last night he wasn't about to let
his supporters down.
"I was so happy." Madsen said.
"When you let your teammates
down, it's the worst feeling in the
world."
So he hit those two shots.
Overhand shots.
The fans screamed, the team
cheered and somewhere, hidden in
Maples, a Fox cameraman smiled.
