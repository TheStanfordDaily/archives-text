# Endowment return sags
## 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
The Stanford Management Company is
sued its annual financial report last week,
showing a sharp decline in interest from the
University's $4.7 billion endowment in the
fiscal 1997-98 year. The report attributes this
to volatility in Asian and emerging markets
and an ensuing decline in stock prices world
wide.
A study from the Chronicle of Higher Ed
ucation shows a striking dichotomy between
Stanford's endowment earnings and average
earnings of 413 universities nationwide.
While the average national return for 1998
was 18.2 percent, Stanford's yield was 1.3
percent.
Laurie Hoagland, chief executive officer
of Stanford Management Company, said the
August cut-off date of Stanford's fiscal year
explains this difference.
"Most other universities have a fiscal year,
which ends in June. These additional two
months made a crucial difference," he said.
Falling stock prices, which culminated in a
disastrous month of August, first started de
clining in Thailand in June of 1997. The
Asian financial crisis soon spread to Latin
America and then Europe and the United
States.
Hoagland emphasized that endowment

return must be looked at in a long-term con
text. Stanford's annual compound return
over the last three years was 20.1 percent, the
median for the 20 largest university endow
ments nationwide.
"While we have the disadvantage that the
year-end snapshot was taken in August, it
also gives us a good starting point for this
next year, whose figures are already in the
double digits," Hoagland said.
Despite the recent Asian and world crisis,
Hoagland said he does not foresee re-invest
ing domestically the 25 percent of the Stan
ford endowment currently allocated in in
ternational stock.
"Investment markets in general can often
be quite volatile. Our interest is getting it
right for the long-term and living with short
term fluctuations," he said.
In fact, an overall upwardly mobile econo
my has meant growing returns for college en
dowments nationwide. The average has been
more than 10 percent for six years since 1990,
according to the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion.
John Ford, vice president of development
at Stanford, said that a healthy economy has
also meant growing contributions to the en
dowment.
This year $88 million in donations were
added to the endowment, contrasted to only
$48 million in 1997.
