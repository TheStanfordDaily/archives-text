# Fighting for the Pac-10
## Surprising Stanford can tie for lead with win 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
Los Angeles has always been
known as the place where you ei
ther make it big or end up in a
cheap motel on Interstate 5, won
dering what went wrong.
The Cardinal (12-9, 8-2 Pacific

10 Conference) women head into
Pauley Pavilion tonight to face the
Bruins (18-5, 10-1), in a game that
is the biggest yet for the team. All
the cards are on the table, and head
coach Tara VanDerveer hopes to
bring up an ace, forcing a tie for
first place in the Pac-10.
The game won't be an easy win

by any means for Stanford, as
UCLA is led by All-America can
didate Maylana Martin. The 6-
foot-3 forward is the only player in
the Pac-10 to rank in the top 10 in
five different statistical categories
(scoring, rebounding, field goal
percentage, blocks and steals). Al
though she has been bothered re
cently with severe headaches, Mar
tin led the Bruin with 17 points in a
losing effort against Oregon Feb. 4.
"Maylana is very good. UCLA
is not a one-player team, but she's
their strongest one inside," Van-
Derveer said. "What we try and
concentrate on is taking away her
favorite moves; there's certain
things she likes to do and we try not
to let her do them."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Today: Stanford (12-9, 8-2 Pacific
10 Conference) at No. 12 UCLA (18-
5,10-1), 7 p.m.

■ Sunday: Stanford at. IJSC (6-14.2-
9), 2 p.m.

Stanford is in no way powerless
against Martin, as it has two dy
namic freshmen forwards, Lindsay
Yamasaki and Bethany Donaphin,
who have been helping the Cardi
nal throughout the Pac-10 season.
Yamasaki is the leading scorer for
the Cardinal with 13.3 points per
game, while Donaphin leads the
team with 8.2 rebounds per game.
Not only are these two freshmen
hot, but forward Enjoli Izidor and
center Cori Enghusen have been
putting up solid numbers off the
bench recently, and Enghusen's
dominating inside presence could
help stifle Martin's offensive
hopes.
"I want [Stanford'sfreshmen) to
just continue the way they've been
playing," said VanDerveer. "1

think we've had a real productive
week in practice. It's been ex
tremely competitive, and we just
need people to take this practice
improvement into the game."
While the freshmen will he a key
ingredient, the lone senior 011 the
team, Regan Freuen. will he sure to
mix things up. Freuen, the captain
of this year's squad, led the Cardi
nal against California last week
with 21 points and 10 rebounds.
Not only has she been posting up
big numbers, her knowledge of the
game and feel for the floor has
often helped stabilize the young
Stanford squad.
"Regan is coming off some real
ly good games for us, and we need
her to just continue the way she's
been playing," VanDerveer said.
"She's going out on fire; she only
has eight more games and she feels

a sense of urgency. We need her to
play with the confidence and en
thusiasm she's been playing with
the last lew games."
Martin is not the only threat to
Stanford. Point guard Erica
Gomez will be a curveball ready to
strike out the Cardinal. Gomez has
been a consistent leader on the
floor, averaging 7.6 assists per
game, good for fourth in the nation
and tops in the Pac-1(). Against
Arizona State 011 Jan. 5, Gomez set
a UCLA record with 16 assists and
only committed three turnovers.
Stanford has its own star at
point guard, though, with junior
Milena Flores. This 5-6 force has
become the go-to player lately, im
pressing all with her dependable
play and a court sense that has led
to more and more transition points.
Flores is right behind Gomez in as
sists, averaging 6.6 per game, but
she leads the Pac-10 with a .795
free-throw percentage.
Free throws continue to be an

important part of Stanford's game,
as the Cardinal is 9-0 when making
more free throws than their oppo
nent.
"1 think Milena has really im
proved a lot since the last UCLA
game, and it'll be a good time to
show it." said VanDerveer.
The impressive UCLA roster is
filled out with players who have
perimeter power as well as strong
post games. Center Janae Hubbard
is strong under the basket, and
against Oregon State last weekend
she nabbed her sixth double-dou
ble of the season. Beside Gomez,
guard LaCresha Flannigan will
bring the ball up the court for the
Bruins, and Stanford will have to
watch out for her threat from be
yond the arc.
While tonight's game is vital not
only to Pac-1 0 standings but also to
Stanford's chances in postseason
play, the Cardinal also has a very
tough game against USC (6-14, 2-
9) on Sunday.
