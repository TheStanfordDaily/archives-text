# Fighting for the Pac-10
## Surprising Stanford can tie for lead with win 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
Los Angeles has always been
known as the place where you ei
ther make it big or end up in a
cheap motel on Interstate 5, won
dering what went wrong.
The Cardinal (12-9, 8-2 Pacific

10 Conference) women head into
Pauley Pavilion tonight to face the
Bruins (18-5, 10-1), in a game that
is the biggest yet for the team. All
the cards are on the table, and head
coach Tara VanDerveer hopes to
bring up an ace, forcing a tie for
first place in the Pac-10.
The game won't be an easy win

by any means for Stanford, as
UCLA is led by All-America can
didate Maylana Martin. The 6-
foot-3 forward is the only player in
the Pac-10 to rank in the top 10 in
five different statistical categories
(scoring, rebounding, field goal
percentage, blocks and steals). Al
though she has been bothered re
cently with severe headaches, Mar
tin led the Bruin with 17 points in a
losing effort against Oregon Feb. 4.
"Maylana is very good. UCLA
is not a one-player team, but she's
their strongest one inside," Van-
Derveer said. "What we try and
concentrate on is taking away her
favorite moves; there's certain
things she likes to do and we try not
to let her do them."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Today: Stanford (12-9, 8-2 Pacific
10 Conference) at No. 12 UCLA (18-
5,10-1), 7 p.m.

■ Sunday: Stanford at. IJSC (6-14.2-
9), 2 p.m.

Stanford is in no way powerless
against Martin, as it has two dy
namic freshmen forwards, Lindsay
Yamasaki and Bethany Donaphin,
who have been helping the Cardi
nal throughout the Pac-10 season.
Yamasaki is the leading scorer for
the Cardinal with 13.3 points per
game, while Donaphin leads the
team with 8.2 rebounds per game.
Not only are these two freshmen
hot, but forward Enjoli Izidor and
center Cori Enghusen have been
putting up solid numbers off the
bench recently, and Enghusen's
dominating inside presence could
help stifle Martin's offensive
hopes.
"I want [Stanford'sfreshmen) to
just continue the way they've been
playing," said VanDerveer. "1
