## Students pray for Sudanese 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
A group of 12 concerned students gath
ered in a prayer vigil held last night in the
Main Quad to protest Christian persecu
tion in Sudan.
According to freshman Stephen
Doane, an organizer of the event, the mili
tary rulers of Sudan have been responsible
for starving and terrorizing millions of Su
danese Christians, while attempting to im
pose strict Islamic law on both Muslims

and non-Muslims.
Since 1989, when Lt. Gen. Omar Has
san al-Bashir seized power from the
African nation's democratically elected
leaders, government persecution has re
sulted in the deaths of more than 1.5 mil
lion people, according to The New York
Times.
Doane said the purposes of the vigil are
to "persuade Congress to work forcefully
for justice ... raise awareness of this ongo
ing atrocity [and] ... bring change to the
situation through prayer to our Almighty

God. That is the most powerful thing we
ean do."
"The persecution of Christians in Sudan
is as much a religious issue as a human
rights issue," said Afua Ntiwa, a junior cur
rently studying in Paris and one of the
event's organizers. Ntiwa said the main
issue at stake was"the right of the Su
danese Christian to practice his faith with
out fear of torture and death."
Christians make up approximately 30
pcrccnt of the population of Sudan,
Africa's largest country by area. Ac
cording to the Center for Religious
Freedom, more people from the
mostly Christian areas in southern
Sudan have been murdered than in
Bosnia and Rwanda combined.
"I'm here to pray for our brothers
and sisters in Sudan who are being
persecuted," said Paul Martin, a
sophomore who attended the event.
After briefly highlighting the
controversy in Sudan, organizers
read four testimonials of Sudanese

individuals who were kidnapped as
slaves.
The vigil was organized by the
Center for Religious Freedom, Sim
ilar events will be taking place at col
leges and universities across the
country, according to event organiz
ers,
Christian student groups intend
to petition Congress to convey their
concern about this issue.
Doane called on each student, re
gardless of religious conviction, to
be "a voice for justice" on behalf of
Sudanese Christians.
"These are deep, very important
character issues for every student on
campus," he said.
