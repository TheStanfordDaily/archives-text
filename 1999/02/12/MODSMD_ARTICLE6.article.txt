Editor's note: In IVM, Andy Warhol made the oft-quoted state-

ment, "In the future, everyone will he famous for
15 minutes." With that in mind, in addition to the
idea that everyone has a story to tell, this article is
the first in a revived series about various members
of the Stanford community. Interview subjects are
picked at random from the Stanford Directory.
"I seem very rambunctious. I come across as very
outgoing," said Erin Mallery, a sophomore living
in Roble Hall. "But I used to be very shy and

things used to be very painful for me."
Certainly no one would guess that of the Stanford Band's
"tooba" section leader. Mallery explained that she changed at the
end of high school:"I just thought, 'Screw it, their opinions don't re
ally matter to me.' "
However, the treatment of her stuffed bunny definitely matters.
Her bunny has been her favorite toy since she received it as a gift for
Easter at the age of four. "It was my confidant, my bunny," she said.
She left her bunny at home after freshman year, because "other
people enjoy torturing me by hanging it out the window or stringing
it up to the sprinklers."
She grew up in Edmonds, Washington, a "really beautiful"
town north of Seattle. Her father is an editor for The Seattle Times,
where "he does the [news] section but not the front page," she ex
plained. Her mother is a nurse.
She has two older sisters, both of whom live around Seattle.
Kami is 31 and makes jewelry, and Keri is 30. Keri is married and
has a two-year-old, making Mallery "a proud aunt."
In high school, she participated in several sports: crew, softball,
skiing and snow boarding. She also was involved in debate and
worked at Starbucks. "I enjoyed high school. 1 was a yay-school
spirit kind of kid," she said.
Mallery entered Stanford as a premed "like everyone else," but

she changed her mind twice and currently is wavering. Seeing the
doctors that helped her sister through her pregnancy inspired her.
but Mallery said. "Now I just don't know. Hum Bio's kicking my
ass."
Mallery considers the Band one of the best parts about her time
here. "It's a blast. I love the section," Mallery said. "It's great getting
together, making music, having fun. We're the crazy spirited group
on campus."
She never played a musical instrument before, but her resident
assistant in Alondra. who played the trombone in the Band, in
spired her. "He got me psyched," she said. "He came back from
events, and they looked like so much fun I wanted to be a part of it."
She also enjoys traveling with the Band.
In addition to the Band, she is busy playing intramural basket
ball and "trying to survive the Hum Bio core."
She said that her basketball team is "really, really horrible. We
really suck. But we enjoy ourselves."
Mallery envisions settling down in the Pacific Northwest, even
though she has done a lot of traveling. "I've been very lucky and
seen more than my share, considering I'm 20 years old," she said.
Last year, she visited Prague, Czech Republic, where her sister

Keri was teaching English as a sec

"It was so much fun. It was the

first time I had gone without my
folks, and we went to bars and had a
rowdy time," she said. "There the
drinking age doesn't matter. It's very
chill. Here Americans are focused on
nit-picky rules and laws that don't re
ally matter."
