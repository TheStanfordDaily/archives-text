In response to a critical shortage
of public school teachers, the Mass
achusetts Department of Educa
tion is taking an active role in trying
to recruit 50 highly qualified educa
tors from Stanford and other top
universities nationwide.
According to an article in the
San Francisco Examiner last week,
officials from Massachusetts are
visiting 48 different college cam
puses in hopes of hiring teachers
for kindergarten through high
school, who will be given a $20,0 CX)
signing bonus paid over four years.
Officials have already visited
and held an information session on
campus through the Career Devel
opment Center. Interviews and
final decisions will take place in
March.
"We want the 50 best people we
can get," said Mieka Fruend, who is

the head of the teacher quality en
hancement program at the Massa
chusetts Department of Education.
"We want people excited about
teaching and about teaching in
Massachusetts."
Although Stanford does not
offer a specific undergraduate
major directed at training teachers,
a masters program known as the
Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram allows students to obtain
teaching credentials after 12
months of study. Compared to
other teaching programs around
the nation, STEP is rather small: it
only enrolls about 75 students.
"I don't know exactly how at
tractive and appealing this Massa
chusetts offer is to students in the
STEP program," said Bob Thirsk,
the Director of the CDC. "Most of
those in the program are here be
cause they probably want to teach
in the state of California."
Citing the even more severe
teaching shortage in California,
Cathy Campbell, assistant director
of the CDC, agreed with Thirsk.
"The Massachusetts [Depart
ment] of Education is looking for
the best and the brightest since they

are only limited to recruiting 50
new teachers with the signed
bonuses. Personally, I don't think it
will be too detrimental to Califor
nia's efforts in recruiting new
teachers," she said. "A lot of peo
ple will still want to relocate and
teach here because location and cli
mate is always a big consideration."
While Massachusetts is taking
an aggressive role in recruiting a
qualified crop of teachers, the state
of California is spending $2 million
on its first ad campaign through the
Long Beach-based California Cen
ter for Teaching Careers.
With the 30-second advertise
ment airing in major cities through
out the state, officials are hoping to
find teachers to educate the more
than 1 million new students expect
ed to enter California's classrooms
in the near future.
According to the Examiner,
260,000 to 300,000 new teachers
will be needed in California alone
within the next 10 years.
"What I see here is an obvious
demand for teachers," freshman
Eva Mejia said. "I think that Mass
achusetts has the right to search for
teachers; although it seems it would

be better if they looked for and
trained people back East to teach
rather than coming out here."
Senior Aditya Mathur dis
agreed. "It's a free market. Stan
ford students are free to do what
they want. If they think it's best for
them, then I say go for it."
"I think that this would be a
good job opportunity. Why should
students here be limited to only
teaching in California?" agreed
freshman Scott Silverglate.
Explaining that she has not seen
any extreme interest in the Massa
chusetts offer, Campbell said, "If
students here were originally look
ing to teach in Massachusetts, then
the offer of more money would just
be an added bonus. But again, I
haven't had anyone specifically tell
me that they wanted more informa
tion about this job offer."
"This is definitely a step in the
right direction, because teachers
really should be paid more," fresh
man Graham Schelle said. "They
should also be recruited from the
top colleges. Personally though, I
don't think the bonus would be
enough of an incentive for me to go
out to Massachusetts and teach."
