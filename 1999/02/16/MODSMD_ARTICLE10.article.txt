# Students honor New Year
## 
### Bo Zhang 
I his past weekend had special
meaning for I i Zeng. Not because it
was Valentine's Day: Zeng's girl
friend lives in Beijing. Not because
President's Day meant a respite
from elasses. It's because today is
Chinese New Year, and Zeng, first
year graduate student in chemistry,
is from Hunan, a province in South
China.
Chinese New Year, also known
as the Spring Festival, is a significant
Chinese I loliday. This holiday cele
brates the first day of the year in the
ancient ('hinese lunar calendar. Tra
ditionally. it is a time for families to
gather together, eat and pray for
good luck in the coming year. They
start preparing for the celebration ;i
week before the new year and con
tinue to celebrate for five days after
wards.
At Stanford Zeng doesn't have
12 days to commemorate the holi
day. On Sunday night, he and four

other ( hinese students made home
made dumplings in the cozy kitchen
of an apartment in the Rains Hous
es. They piled fillings of pork, beef
and shrimp into flour wrappers
while a pot of water boiled on the
heater beside them.
"It's a tradition to eat dumplings
on Chinese New Year's Eve," Zeng
said as he put two dozen of them into
the boiling water. The dumplings
sank to the bottom of the pot.
'They'll float up to the surface when
they're fully cooked," he explained.
"We Chinese people think it's a
symbol of our ascending luck in the
coming year."
Stanford has a large C 'hinese pop
ulation. About 2(M) Stanford stu
dents come from Taiwan, and many
more come from mainland China.
Zeng and his friends were not alone
in their celebration. Many other
Stanford students of Chinese origin
celebrated Chinese New Year over
the weekend.
Last Friday night, more than KXI

Taiwanese students gathered in
Kicker Dinning Center, to celebrate
the holiday with traditional Chinese
music at a party sponsored by the
Stanford Taiwanese Students Asso
ciation.
Linda Kuo, president of the asso
ciation, said the party gave a break
to overburdened students and pro
vided them with a sense of home.
"Usually Stanford students study
very, very hard and they seldom
have a break," Kuo said. "So events
like this promote interaction among
Taiwanese students here."
Kuo said the association invited
not only Taiwanese but also stu
dents of other ethnic backgrounds,
who were interested in celebrating
the new year.
Ann Collins, a graduate student
in Asian studies and Kuo's room
mate, attended the party.
"I think it's a good time for peo
ple to get together with their friends
and family," Collins said. Collins
said she had spent a year each in Tai

wan and Beijing and enjoyed Chi
nese culture.
"I've made dumplings myself,"
she said proudly.
The band at the party, the South
Bay Chinese Orchestra, included
erhu player Matt Springer.
Springer said he learned to play
erhu — a violin-like traditional Chi
nese instrument — five years ago
from a Chinese woman. Like
Collins, Springer, a research associ
ate in molecular pharmacology,
loves Chinese culture. Springer said
his fiancee is from Taiwan, so he's
also celebrating the new year.
While most Chinese students cel
ebrate the Spring Festival tradition
ally, some find other ways to spend
this time.
Li Gong, a second-year doctoral
student in communication studies,
went skiing in Lake Tahoe.
"I'm celebrating it, though in an
untraditional way," Gong said. "I
don't have family here. I want some
thing different, so I'm going to ski."
