# Capturing the 'Art of the Steal'
## 
### Steve Kessler 
After being immortalized in
Stanford sports lore last spring, se
nior basketball player Arthur Lee's
dramatic last minute steal of a
Rhode Island pass in the NCAA
tournament has also been immortal
ized in Stanford art.
Longtime Cardinal fan Bill Mar
tin, *61, commissioned Stanford ju
nior Drue Kataoka. a professional
sitmi-e artist, to create a painting of
the play. I lie result was 'Art of the
Steal," a commemorative poster
which celebrates the team's historic
run to the IWN Final I our.
According to Martin, who has
traveled more than l().(HH) miles to
see nearly I.(HX) Stanford games in
15 sports. "The steal is the most sig

nificant instant in Stanford basket
hall history."
Television cameras caught Lee
knocking the ball to teammate Mark
Madsen for the go-ahead dunk, but
because the steal itself was so unex
pected and happened so quickly, the
flurry of camera flashes missed it. As
a result, Kataoka's piece is the only
known still depiction of the historic
play.
To recreate the moment, Katao
ka watched extensive television
footage of the final minute of the
Rhode Island game and then met
with Lee to discuss the play.
"We went into an empty Maples
Pavilion last summer, and Art and 1
simulated the play. I got an appreci
ation of the intensity of the moment,
standing on the court in front of

thousands of invisible fans," Katao
ka said.
From there, it was a simple step
for Kataoka to translate her under
standing of the play into sumi-e, a
2,(XX)-year-old Japanese art form.
"Basketball and sumi-e are very sim
ilar," she explained. "Both require
diligence, practice and control. The
brush strokes, like a basketball play
er's dribble or shot, must be done
with confidence and precision, be
cause they cannot be repeated or un
done."
In sumi-e, the artist must first
spend about an hour using a stone to
grind ink until it achieves the desired
consistency. The artist then has one
chance to lay out his or her interpre
tation of the subject in the broad,
flowing strokes that characterize the

form.
Kataoka. who grew up in Japan,
remembers being fascinated by the
sumi-e scrolls in the Tokyo national
museum as a child. At the age of five,
she began to paint sumi-e and after
much tutelage was granted her Han.
or professional status, at the age of
17.
Autographed and unsigned
copies of "The Art of the Steal" are
available for $15 and $10 respective
ly at every men's basketball home
game. Proceeds benefit Coaches vs.
Cancer, a partnership between Stan
ford Basketball and the American
Cancer Society. In addition, the
poster is available for purchase at
University Art Center locations in
downtown Palo Alto, San Francisco
and San Jose.
