### 
BAGHDAD. Iraq (AP) — Iraq will attack a Turk
ish base for U.S. warplanes — and other American and
British bases in the region — if the jets continue to
patrol the skies over Iraq, the Iraqi vice president
warned yesterday.
l aha Yassin Ramadan's threat, coming in an inter
view with Radio Monte Carlo, monitored in Baghdad,
marked the first time Iraq has threatened to attack
neighboring Turkey in years.
U.S. jets based in Incirlik, in south Turkey, have
struck almost daily at Iraqi defense sites after being tar
geted by Iraqi defenses while patrolling the "no-fly"
zone over the north of the country.
Ramadan threatened attacks on the Incirlik base,
and repeated Iraq's threat Sunday on other bases in
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait from which U.S. and British
iets patrol a southern "no-fly" zone.
"If the Turkish base continues attacking Iraq it will
certainly be (targeted) like other bases (in the Persian
Gulf)." Ramadan said.
"I say if America and Britain do not retreat, they'll
soon pay dearly in relation to the properties and ele
ments they use to launch aggression on the people of
Iraq," he said.
Ramadan made his remarks the same day that Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz held talks with
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit in Ankara.
Aziz went to Turkey to try to persuade the Turkish

government to put a halt to the overflights from Incir
lik base.
I J.S. warplanes attacked Iraqi defense sites in north
ern Iraq yesterday as well, the Defense Department
said in Washington. The planes returned safely to Incir
lik. the U.S. spokesman said.
The "no-fly" zones were set up ter the 1991 Per
sian Gulf War to prevent Iraqi aircraft from commiting
attacks in the north and south of the country.
Iraq has never accepted the validity of the zones,
which were created by the United States, Britain and
France and are not authorized by a specific U.N. Secu
rity Council resolution. France later withdrew its par
ticipation in the enforcement of the zones.
The United States says Iraq has violated the zones
90 times since it began challenging them in December.
U.S. and British planes have retaliated by attacking
more than 40 Iraqi air defense sites.
Iraq says at least 32 people have been killed in these
attacks.
In Ankara, Ecevit made clear yesteiday that U.S.
and British planes would continue to be allowed to use
Incirlik to patrol northern Iraq. However, he distanced
his nation from the American interest in overthrowing
the Iraqi president.
Turkey fears attempts to remove Saddam could lead
to chaos in Iraq. "For us the problem is not Saddam
Hussein," Ecevit reported after meeting with Aziz.
