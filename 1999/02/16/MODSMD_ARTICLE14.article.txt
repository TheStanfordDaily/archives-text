# Serbs willing to compromise

### 
PARIS (AP) — Serbia is willing
to make major compromises and
grant rival ethnic Albanians broad
self-rule, but it adamantly opposes
having NATO troops police a
Kosovo agreement, the republic's
president said yesterday.
For the first time since a Kosovo
peace conference started Feb. 6,
Milan Milutinovic indicated Serbs
were willing to give up most of the
demands that have stalled the talks,
with the exception of NATO peace
keeping troops.
"We don't think that the troops
are needed if the agreement is good
and acceptable to the majority of
people living in Kosovo," Miluti
novic told The Associated Press,
adding that abandoning NATO
demands for a peacekeeping force
was a "precondition" for any even
tual peace deal.
Milutinovic spoke as the Kosovo
conference headed toward a fast
approaching deadline, with the
United States pressuring the Ser
bians to make a deal with Kosovo
Albanians or prepare to be bombed
by NATO forces.

More than 2,000 people have
been killed in a year of clashes in
Kosovo between ethnic Albanian
separatists and Serbian security
forces.
The province is in southern Ser
bia, the dominant Yugoslav repub
lic, and 90 percent of its 2 million
people are ethnic Albanians.
Milutinovic said any NATO
deployment would "badly damage
our sovereignty" and that NATO
bombing raids in the absence of an
agreement would amount to "an
aggression and a war crime."
British military vehicles and
heavy guns were moved yesterday
from Germany to Greece for use in
a possible NATO intervention in
Kosovo, the British army said.
With just five days to a deadline
set by the United States and five of
its European allies for a deal to be
signed, Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov visited the 14th-century
French chateau where the talks
were being held yesterday.
Russia is pushing as hard as the
United States for a resolution of the
Kosovo conflict by Saturday.

But Moscow opposes the use of
NATO airstrikes and is noncom
mittal on the deployment of
international peacekeeping troops.
The Albanians seemed to accept
the international peace plan grant
ing them virtual self-rule in Kosovo
but keeping the Serbian province
within existing borders.
But the Albanians want NATO
troops to police any agreement
because they don't trust the Serbian
government.
NATO already is making plans
to send up to 30,000 troops into
Kosovo, including 4,000 U.S.
troops.
A Kosovo Albanian close to the
talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said yesterday that Sec
retary of State Madeleine Albright
laid out three possibilities to their
delegation.
The Kosovo Albanians don't
sign, and they lose all American
support; the Kosovo Albanians
sign, the Serbs don't and the United
States bombs the Serbs; or every
body signs and NATO enters Koso
vo to police the agreement.
