Impeachment saga
ends with all parties
looking bad

THE NATIONAL impeach
ment mess has finally subsid
ed.
Any attempt to forecast the long
range impact of this ordeal would be
premature, but one thing is certain
— nobody came out of the impeach
ment process looking good.
Polls and approval ratings are not
the only rulers by which to measure
a presidency. President Clinton's
legacy has been permanently tar
nished with the stain of impeach
ment, and he must bear the shame of
having engaged in a sexual relation
ship in the Oval Office, then lying
about it under oath and to the pub
lic.
Clinton cannot deny that his
behavior was egregious and merited
punishment.
The President has somehow man
aged to retain part of the moral high
ground as the wrongfully accused
victim.
But last week. The New York
Times reported that Clinton told
aides he will work to oust his Repub
lican accusers from office by
fundraising for their opponents.
Such vindictive statements by Clin
ton show a stunning lack of remorse
on his part, and if he does follow
through with this threat, we think he
should lose any sympathy he has
garnered.
Republicans are equally account
able in contributing to the impeach
ment circus because of the way they
chose to handle the situation.
ITiey pursued the President in a
highly partisan and self-righteous
manner, showing how even
impeachment can be a method of
partisan politics. References to a

"witch hunt" were often appropri
ately made.
With the impeachment vote
behind them. Republicans are now
saying that it is time to move on and
attend to the business of the nation.
ITiese promises seem like too little,
too late. The legislative agenda has
been irreparably damaged.
Furthermore, the frenzy of news
paper and television coverage sur
rounding the proceedings did little
to improve the image of the Ameri
can media, which had already been
maligned for prying into public lives
under the guise of "the public's right
to know."
The public found out more than it
wanted to know, and it's doubtful
that our lives are better because of
it.
Even the behavior of the Ameri
can public merits concern. From its
vantage point, the gravity of perjury
and obstruction of justice charges
was often obscured by prosperous
economic times and Clinton's charis
matic speaking style.
This is nothing new.
Compare this to the presidency of
Ronald Reagan, a leader with a con
genial television demeanor and a
strong economy behind him who
was similarly let off the hook for the
Iran-Contra affair.
Clinton may be able to "feel our
pain," but that doesn't mean we
should look the other way when he
blatantly lies about his misconduct.
Europeans are known for having
more tolerant sexual mores than
Americans, and often wax superior
about their more liberal opinions.
Now, the whole world can feel
superior to Americans, whose peo
ple and their leaders have exhibited
a childish inability to handle allega
tions of misconduct.
Now that the ordeal is behind us,
perhaps we can work toward
redeeming ourselves.
