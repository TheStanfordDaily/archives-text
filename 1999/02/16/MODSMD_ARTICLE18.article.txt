## Articles that really matter

IT'S ANOTHER
weekday morning
and, hurrying to my
first class, I invariably stop
to pick up a copy of The
Daily to make the trek
from Toyon to the Politi
cal Science Building go by

that much faster. Most days, I'm lucky if I
haven't exhausted my interest in the paper
by the time I sit down in class (the cross
word puzzle I save for later, of course).
The routine, I imagine, is the same for
most undergraduates: a brief glance at the
front page, a follow-up on the one or two
articles that engage my curiosity, a turn to
page four to check out the editorial and the
columns and finally, a glance at the horo
scope. If I haven't checked out the CNN
Web site in the last 24 hours, the World and
Nation section is an enlightening exercise
in reductionism. And, as a liberal arts
major, it's fun to laugh at the recruitment
ads from consulting firms and investment
banks trying to convince graduating seniors
that they will be wandering the streets of
New York next year, in sweater sets and
khakis, searching for the perfect martini,
rather than being locked into a cubicle for
16 hours a day, every day.
In other words, though five times a week
The Daily manages to distribute 10 to 12
pages of newsprint to those übiquitous
kiosks, much like Oakland, there never

seems to be all that much there. The com
mon rebuttal to this assertion is that not
much happens at Stanford. Well, that's
true. Our biggest crime remains bike theft,
and when Stanford Police Lieutenant Del
Bandy mentioned in The Daily last week
that the intersection of Santa Teresa and
Lomita presents a "tough situation," he's
talking about the high prevalence of bike
accidents, not drug dealers.
In many ways, Stanford is a small town,
and The Daily's articles often reflect this
fact. But though little actually "happens,"
that does not mean that nothing is going on.
The flip side of The Daily's role as the sole
daily newspaper is a heightened duty to
keep us, the public, informed of the most
current issues. This doesn't just mean on
the-spot mobilization every time the rare
campus emergency occurs, or the unques
tioning recapitulation of changes in admin
istration policy that herald huge shifts in
student life as inevitable faits accomplis.
But it does mean more articles on issues,
such as land use or tenure, that have made
Stanford the place it is. This is so the vast
majority of us can understand why other
people have dedicated their careers to the
Farm. Maybe then we can understand the
University better for the four brief years
while we're here and be more involved
alumni once we leave.
It also means looking at the tortuous
bonds of mutual dependence between

graduate students and the schools; it means
examining the alienation many students
feel from the overall mission of the Univer
sity. It means making a commitment to
more stories (and, yes, maybe less ad
space) and more time spent on research.
But it also means taking advantage of The
Daily's position as the last remaining major
publication independent of both University
and ASSU support.
For my part, as a columnist, I will try to
encourage you to learn more and think
more about the impact of these kinds of
issues in your life; to make you reflect
more, not only about your role as a mem
ber of the Stanford community, but also
about your role in the world at large; and,
most importantly, to urge you to act so that
your opinions are not ignored.
With the education we've received —
and at the prices that we've paid — once we
have left this place behind, we will probably
be moving on to bigger and brighter things
sooner and easier than 9() percent of our
peers. It may be uncomfortable to admit,
but our voices will likely carry further than
those of many others. It's probably in our
best interest to start using them now.
