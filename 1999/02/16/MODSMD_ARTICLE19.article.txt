Upperclassmen need support
While the University is currently creat
ing more programs to increase the faculty
student interactions for underclassmen, I
cannot help but feel that as an upperclass
man, the University is not looking for ways
to increase our interactions with faculty.
Some upperclassmen are complaining
about the loss of potential two-room dou
bles, but I am more concerned about the
lack of support that upperclassmen receive
from the University.
While most of us have chosen majors,
many of us are still unsure of our career
paths and exactly where our fields of study
will lead us in the future. The Career Devel
opment Center is a valuable resource; how
ever, why aren't there more resources for
possible careers?
There are fewer opportunities for small
group seminars, sometimes at the expense
of Freshman and Sophomore Introductory
Seminars. Upperclass houses and dormito
ries do not have faculty nights, a valuable
way to interact with faculty outside of an
academic context.
I applaud the University's efforts to
increase the faculty interaction with under
classmen through programs such as Sopho
more College, Intnxluctory Seminars and

(he new Freshman Sophomore College.
However, I hope that the University
does not continue to neglect the needs of
upperclassmen. It feels as if after sopho
more year, the University discontinues the
support that it has provided during our
underclass years.
Just because we are nearing the end of
our Stanford careers does not mean that we
are no longer in need of guidance and facul
ty interaction.

Taunting part of college sports
There's been a lot of criticism regarding
the Sixth Man Club's behavior at the Con
necticut game. True, the comments about
Khalid El-Amin probably crossed the line
of decency, but taunting is part of college
sports.
The infamous Duke student section
taunted Antawn Jamison with chants of
"your mom can't spell" because his name,
which was supposed to be Antwan, was mis
spelled by his mother on his birth certificate.
Anyone who has attended an athletic
contest between southern schools, and his
torically Black colleges in particular, can

attest to pot-shots and insults taken to new
ereative levels. It's all part of school spirit.
1 attended Stanford as an undergraduate
at a time when you could have studied for a
midterm amidst the quiet of men's basket
ball games, and school spirit and fan excite
ment at athletic events was something that
Stanford students condescendingly ascribed
to state schools and the University of
Spoiled Children.
Although comments about players' chil
dren should be off limits, this new exuber
ance is for the most part a welcome change,
and along with the high caliber of Stanford
basketball, has made Maples one of the
toughest venues for visiting teams to come
away from with a win.

Affirmative action backlash
The popularity among Chicanos of wild
Aztlan ideas has provoked a backlash
against Chicanos. The misuse of affirmative
action is illustrated in the selection of a vio
linist for a Chicago orchestra. The contes
tants performed behind a curtain to avoid
charges of race prejudice. A black contes
tant who was not selected denounced the

curtain as an example of racism.
At Stanford, affirmative action has dis
torted the appointment process. I was on
the committee to select a new professor.
The administration suggested a woman who
had a Spanish name by marriage, and sim
ply refused to consider any other candidate.
When I reported the case of a black
attendant, possibly on drugs, who manhan
dled me in the Stanford Hospital — which
was frightened to fire him — a Stanford col
league denounced my racism.
The latest case is that of a black woman
in the Law School (I had never heard of
her) who resigned because she was passed
over as head of the Transnational Business
Law Program in favor of Thomas Heller,
who deservedly has an international reputa
tion. This has led to denunciations of the
Stanford Law School, which has a far better
record of hiring blacks than any other major
law school.
I wish to assure Thomas Heller and the
Law School administration that they have
my strong support and that this episode
indicates the potential danger of favoring a
black candidate whose main qualification
seems to be her popularity.
