Stanford may have sent a small
delegation to the country's oldest and
largest Model United Nations con
ference. but the delegates made their
presence felt. Two of the six students
who attended came back with awards
for their skills in debate and diploma
cy.
"That's a higher proportion than
Berkeley got," pointed out sopho
more Pascal Schonard, taking a dig at
UC-Berkeley's larger and better
funded delegation.
Schonard and fellow undergradu
ates Brian Milch, Michael Ross,
Honor Gunday, Nnena Nnoli and
Margot Brandenburg were among
the 2,000 college students who at
tended Harvard's National Model
United Nations Conference last
week in Boston. As in the real United
Nations, each school's delegation
represented a different country. The
conference was broken into 21 com
mittees imitating such U.N. bodies as
the World Health Organization, the
Security Council and the World
Bank.
At the end of the event, each com
mittee recognized seven of its dele
gates for outstanding work. Milch
and Brandenburg each received hon
orable mention.

Milch, a junior majoring in sym
bolic systems, won his award for help
ing to shape a resolution addressing
unequal schooling for the world's
poor, minority, female and otherwise
underprivileged students.
"A lot of people don't realize that
most of the U.N.'s activities are hu
manitarian and cultural," said Milch.
" They tend to focus on how it failed
to prevent genocide in Rwanda and
things like that." He pointed out that
such organizations as UNICEF and
UNESCO have provided a great deal
of direct aid towards educating the
world's children.
The Stanford delegation had an
uphill climb just getting to the event.
Although the university's Model
U.N. Club has about 20 members,
only six could make it because the
group isn't funded by the ASSU and
had to pay its own expenses. Only the
larger delegations of 30 or more were
permitted to represent such major
players as the United States or China,
because they needed to have mem
bers on all the committees. Stanford
represented the Slovak Republic.
The lack of funding is a sore point
with the club. "1 was talking to some
friends from Carleton College, and
all their expenses were paid," Milch
