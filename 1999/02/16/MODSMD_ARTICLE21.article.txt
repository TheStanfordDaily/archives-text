Occasionally,
I HOPE I may be
permitted to com
ment on a subject that is
not related to present,
pressing controversies but
that is nonetheless of signif
icance.

The first art museum 1 ever visited was the
Kunsthalle in Hamburg, the Hanseatic port
city on the Elbe River where I was born and
went to school. Apparently, Leland Stanford
Jr., accompanied by his mother, saw the
then-new museum on his first trip to Europe
as a 12-year-old in 1880.
I first went there on a field trip with my
elementary school homeroom. Rather than
tour the entire museum, we spent two hours
with two pictures (I remember one of these
to have been a landscape of a lake and moun
tains by the Swiss painter Ferdinand

Hodler). We were expected to describe and
analyze in detail what we saw.
I was reminded of this door opening to art
a few years ago at the National Gallery in
London. 1 noticed a group of English school
children, under the inspired guidance of their
teacher, sitting in a circle on the floor in front
of a Gainsborough, doing exactly what we
had done.
The 20th-century German poet Gottfried
Benn began one of his last poems with the
line, "In my parental home there were no
Gainsboroughs."
A museum at a university, in some ways,
is a luxury comparable to having Gainsbor
oughs at home. Jane Stanford, however, in
her commentary on the Founding Grant,
referred to galleries of art as "necessary and
appropriate to a University of high degree."
This is a truth that is hardly self-evident.
However, it has become so much a part of

Stanford's mission (in later years thanks to
Lorenz Eitner, Wanda Corn and Thomas
Seligman) that even the formidable universi
ty-wide restoration challenges that we faced
after the 1989 earthquake did not deter the
university leaders of the time from assuming
the restoration and, indeed, expansion of the
Stanford Museum as necessary and appro
priate.
That restoration and expansion now have
been achieved, and achieved splendidly.
What does it mean to us?
Art in a permanent collection permits us
to spend hours in front of a painting or a
sculpture and to come back. The point was
beautifully made by a man who viewed the
recent regrouping of Rodin's Burghers of
Calais in Memorial Court. He was overheard
by Bernard Barryte, chief curator of the Can
tor Center and the person responsible for the
rearrangement of the Burghers. The old gen

tleman looked at the statues for quite a while
and then turned to a young woman, perhaps
his daughter, and said: "I would go to school
here just to be able to look at these statues
every day."
Stanford's emphasis on the arts and
humanities will be greatly enhanced by the
reopening and enlargement of our museum
as the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for
Visual Arts. In this emphasis, we will be reas
sured by the fact that our founders thought of
the arts and humanities as necessary for the
institution's object, "to qualify students for
personal success, and direct usefulness in
life." The educational goals of a university
can hardly be stated more pragmatically than
by a reference to success and usefulness. Yet
under this, our founders' pragmatism,
lurked, as it were, a more complex view of
human aspirations. "Cultivation and enlarge
ment of the mind" were sine qua nons.

Of course, the role of an art museum at
Stanford is not solely educational. It is also to
provide the university community and the
larger community around Stanford with the
sheer aesthetic pleasure that comes from
viewing art. Exposure to good art often
increases subsequent demand for good art. It
can become, in the words of my economist
friends Gary Becker and George Stigler, a
"beneficial" addiction.
I encourage you to visit this campus trea
sure soon, to spend a few hours in front of a
painting or sculpture and to come back time
and again. 1 believe you will find your educa
tion furthered, your mind cultivated and
enlarged and yourself beneficially addicted
to good art.
