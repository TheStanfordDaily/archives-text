## Streak opens door in Pac-10 race 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Don't pass the torch to lICLA
just yet.
After cruising through the first
half of the Pacific 10 Conference
schedule with an unbeaten record
and remaining in the nation's top 10
for most of the season, the IJCLA
women's basketball team was seem-

ingly charging
toward its first
conference title.
The tides had
changed, or so it
seemed.
Since its in
ception in the
1986-87 season,
Pac-10 women's

basketball has been owned by the
Cardinal. Stanford has won nine of
the last lOconferenee crownsâ€”one
as co-champions with Washington
in the Cardinal's 1989-90 NCAA
title season. The other eight titles
Stanford has won outright.
But with their early-season suc
cess. the Bruins were beginning to
make a statement. Stanford was no
longer the dominant force it had
been in previous years, and UCLA
became the new team to beat in the
Pac-1().
That statement was never louder
than when the Lady Bruins came to
Palo Alto on Jan. 16. and walked
out of Maples with an KO-72 win.
The loss marked Stanford's first
Pac-10 defeat at home since a 69-68
loss to Washington on Feb. 9, 1991,
and was the first time UCLA has
taken a game from the Cardinal at
Maples since the 1987-88 season.

The post-game talk for the Bru
ins was about their hopes for an un
defeated Pac-10 record, a feat that
didn't seem so farfetched for a team
filled with a core of talented and ex
perienced juniors. That was a
month ago. and things have certain
ly changed.
"They have a good team, and
when they were up at Stanford they
were talking about going undefeat
ed," said senior guard Regan
Freuen. 'I've been on two unde
feated teams, and it's harder than
people think. You've got to come
out and be on top of things every
game. You have a target on your
back."
If anyone currently playing in the
Pac-10 Conference understands the
big picture, it's Freuen. Only three
teams have ever finished the 18-
game P.MO schedule unbeaten.
Freuen vv as on two of them (1995-%
and 1996-97). The other was Stan
ford's 1988-89 squad.
She's also got a pretty good idea
about the national picture too. Asa
fifth-year senior, Freuen is one of
only three active players in the na
tion who have been to three Final
Fours. The other two are Ten
nessee's Chamique Holdsclaw and
Kelly Jolly, winners of three nation
al titles.
So it's only fitting that in Stan
lord's seven-game win streak since
the loss to UCLA, Freuen has been
a major reason for the Cardinal's
turnaround. After earlv-season in
juries, Freuen is finally having the
kind of impact she had hoped for all
season, and Stanford has certainly


Freuen
been successful because of it. In her
last live games, the guard is shooting
well, driving aggressively to the bas
ket and averaging l l ).2 points per
game.
She had a double-double against
California (21 points and 10 re
bounds). and no performance in her
career has been bigger than the show
Freuen put on last Friday at Pauley
Pavilion. Freuen played all but one
minute of the game and scored a ca
reer-high 34 points on 12-of-18 shoot
ing from the field and a perfect 7 of 7
from the line.
"I've gotten a lot of confidence
with my shot." Freuen said. "I'm
being more aggressive. 1 don't have
many games left, and I'm trying to
put [the rest of the team] on my back
and take them where I want to go. I
don't think they all feel that sense of

urgency.
Indeed, the Cardinal's youth has
been the source of both its success
and its troubles this season. The team
that took the floor Friday night, how
ever. displayed the talent it has been
touted to possess and performed in
the clutch with the experience of a
veteran team, winning on the road
despite missing four of its final six
free throws.
For the Bruins, life hasn't been so
great in the second half of the confer
ence schedule. A Feb. 4 loss at Ore
gon ruined UCLA's hopes for a per
fect Pac-10 record, but the Bruins
were still in control of the conference
race until last weekend. That's when
the Cardinal came to town and
walked out of Pauley with a three
point, buzzer-beating victory.
"I don't think we came into the
season feeling the pressure," said ju
nior forward Maylana Martin, who
led UCLA with 22 points. "1 think
now the pressure has become a fac

tor."
One of the things the Bruins have
been most successful with is their in
side game. But on Friday it was the
Cardinal's post play that made the
biggest impact. Sophomore center
Carolyn Moos notched a double
double (17 points. 11 rebounds), and
Stanford matched UCLA in re
bounds. Even more importantly, the
Cardinal swatted five UCLA shots
and made its defensive presence felt
in the middle.
"We have a lot of young players."
said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"They're listening. Practices are real
ly competitive. I haven't had a team
work any harder than this one."
. With the win over UCLA and
another barn-burner at USC. Stan
ford is at the top of the Pac-10 con
ference sitting a half-game behind
UCLA and Oregon. And with just
six games remaining, the Cardinal
looks poised to make another run at
the Pac-10 title.
