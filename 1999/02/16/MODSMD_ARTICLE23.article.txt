### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
Sometimes, a change in the stan
dard operating procedure can be a
good thing. That's just what hap
pened for the 1 lth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team (4-4, 3-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) this past weekend.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Friday: No. 11 Stanford (4-4. 3-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
d. ('al State-Nortbridge (1-6,1-5) 16-
14.15-8.13-15.15-7.

■ Saturday: Stanford d. DC-Santa
Barbara (3-5. 2-5) 15-13, 13-15. 17-
15.15-13.

The Cardinal defeated the No. 15
UC -Santa Barbara Gauchos (3-5,2-
5) 15-13. 13-15. 17-15, 15-13 on Sat
urday and the unranked Cal State-
Northridge Matadors Friday night
16-14. 15-8. 13-15. 15-7 at Burnham
Pavilion.
Stanford introduced a new rota
tion of starting players, which
proved effective on both nights. Se
nior outside hitter Patrick Klein and
senior middle blocker Jeremy Bart
joined the usual starters on the
court.
After Stanford outside hitter and
All-American Andy Witt's decision
to leave the team, it became evident
that Klein would assume a starting
role. Bart was brought back into the
starting rotation to allow sopho
more middle blocker Dan Zhang
extra time to rest his injured knee.
But the variation didn't stop
there.
On Friday night, for the first time
since the season opener win over the
Loyola Marymount Lions, the Car
dinal won the first game of a match
Then, Stanford did it again on
Saturday night.
The most productive change this
past weekend was the Cardinal's
ability to step up its level of play dur
ing the most critical aspects of a
match. Although in the past Stan
ford has been unable to close out
games, the Cardinal remained men
tally tough throughout the entire
match.
Stanford's first test of its mental
toughness came early against the
(iauchos in game one. With the Car
dinal leading 13-11. Bart injured his
ankle while attempting to retrieve a
ball.
After letting five game points slip
away, the Cardinal captured game
one on a UCSB hitting error.
The Cardinal faced another test of
its ability to stay poised during game
three. This time, the Gauchos were
the ones struggling to hold onto a
lead. Key kills by junior outside hitter
Gabe Gardner and effective block
ing by sophomore Brett Youngberg
and junior Josh Palacios enabled the
Cardinal to hold off four game
points.
"Game three was huge for us,"
said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. "We were down 14-12, but
found a wav to win and got our of

fense working."
Stanford allowed five game points
of its own to slip away before a kill by
(Jardner ended game three.
The intensity continued in game
four. Stanford let a match point slip
away off a serving error by Palacios.
But the Cardinal remained focused
and closed out the match on another
kill by Gardner.
If at times Stanford seemed as if it
was going to let its lead slip away
against the (iauchos. they were in for
the same scenario on Friday.
"We knew it was going to be a
tough game against Northridge."
Nieves said. "Being 1-4 in this league
doesn't mean that you are a
pushover. Every game in the MI'SF
will be competitive."
After establishing a 10-0 lead in
game one, Stanford let the Matadors
back into the game. But just like on
Saturday night, the Cardinal stepped
up its play during crunch time.
Gardner served two aces with the
scored tied at eleven, but his contri
butions were not limited to serving.
He recorded 35 kills throughout the
match to lead the Cardinal offense.
" The team offense is coming
along." Nieves said. "We got off to a
slow start in game one. but were able
to improve as the match progressed."
Using Gardner's momentum, the
Cardinal eventually pulled away for a
16-14 game-one win.
