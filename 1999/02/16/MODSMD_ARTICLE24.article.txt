# Gymnasts edged in Huskies' house
## 
### Ramona Shelburne Staff writer 
After winning its last four compe
titions, including victories over three
top-15 teams, the No. <S Stanford
women's gymnastics team had every
reason to be confident going into its
meet against the I Jniversity of Wash
ington last Friday night.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal also
had every reason to be emotionally
and physically drained.
And so, even though Stanford
showed flashes of the talent that has
landed it in the thick of the national
championship race, the Cardinal fell
to the unranked Huskies (192.975-
192.950) with an uncharacteristically
inconsistent performance.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

â–  Friday: Washington 192.975 (4-5),
No. 8 Stanford 192.950 (5-1). UC-
Davis 187.800, Seattle Pacific
187.700.

"People are kind of getting tired
and sore and that was reflected in the
meet," said Stanford senior Katie
Fitzpatrick. "It's definitely nothing to
panic about; this happens every year
where you have a down meet."
Although Friday's performance
was by no means among the Cardi
nal's finest of the year, it was far from
being Stanford's worst. In the end.
the Cardinal lost by only one-fourth
of a point and was leading the com
petition by three-tenths of a point
going into the final rotation.
This situation was too familiar to
the returning members of last sea
son's Cardinal squad who saw their
national championship hopes disap
pear on the final rotation at the
NCAA Regional competition held at
the Hec Edniundson Pavilion, the
same venue for Friday's meet.
But Friday night's meet was not
the NCAA Regional Tournament
.and the Cardinal still has its national
championship hopes intact after Fri
day's loss in the Pacific Northwest.
"When you have a rough meet it's
not always a bad thing; you can al
ways learn from it," said second-year

Stanford head coach Mark Cook.
"We still feel like we're a better team
[than Washington], but maybe not on
Friday night."
Despite its inconsistency through
out the meet, Stanford still had an op
portunity to swipe a victory from the
Huskies, who were almost as shaky as
the weary Cardinal.
Both Stanford and Washington
had to count multiple falls through
out the competition and only the
I luskics' strong finish on the floor ex
ercise decided the outcome of the
meet. The Cardinal counted four
sub~y.6(K) scores in its last rotation,
the vault, while Washington posted
three of the meet's five highest scores
during the floor exercise.
Even though the Cardinal would
have liked to have come away with
the victory, Stanford still turned in a
respectable performance on a night
where the wear and tear of six
straight weeks of competition, cou
pled with the residual effects of
preparing for midterms, had taken a
101l on the Cardinal squad.
But, in spite of the loss, several

Cardinal gym
nasts turned in
solid perfor
mances. Headlin
ing the Stanford
attack were
sophomores Jen
Exaltacion and
Jenny Wilson.
Exaltacion, the

only C ardinal gymnast to compete in
all four events, ended the day with
second-place honors in the all
around (38.925), the balance beam
(9.8(X)) and the vault (9.750).
"Jen was able to face her demons
|Friday night | because she fell last
year at Regionals on the beam and
she just rocked this year." Cook said.
Wilson has been among the Car
dinal's most consistent performers
this season and Friday night was no
exception. She earned a 9.825 and
first-place honors from the judges on
the vault. Wilson also tied for third on
the uneven bars (9.750) and in the


Exaltacion
floor exercise (9.8(H)).
Senior co-captain Amy Muraka
mi continued tier string of victories in
the uneven bars with a routine that
earned a 9.850 from the judges. Mu
rakami has won three straight un
even bars competitions, including
two near-perfect routines against
()regon State (9.975) two weeks ago
and against UCLA and Penn State

last week (4.950).
Washington was led by sopho
more Lanna Apisukh, who won the
all-around competition (39.300) and
tied for first place on vault (9.825)
and the balance beam (9.850).
Apisukh has won the all-around
competition in three of her last four
meets.
Stanford will look to rebound
from Friday's defeat when it takes on
Pacific 10 Conference rival Arizona
State this Friday night at 7:30 p.m. at
Burnham Pavilion.
