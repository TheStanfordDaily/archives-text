WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Friday: Stanford (14-9, 10-2 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) 87. No. 13 UCLA
(19-6.11-2)84.

■ Sunday: Stanford 60. USC (7-15
3-10)59.

This game had all elements of a
history-making story — a 34-point ef
fort by the team's lone senior, Regan
Freuen, a last- second shot by fresh
man Lindsey Yamasaki for the win
and impressive play off the bench by
a host of soon-to-be-legendary char
acters. The win also put the Cardinal
within a half game with UCLA and
Oregon for the Pac-10 lead.
The win. along with Sunday's vic
tory against IJSC (7-15, 3-10), put
Stanford's win streak at seven games,
and arguably makes it one of the
hottest teams in the nation. It also
tied Stanford's record in the loss col
umn with IJC'LA's. meaning that the
Cardinal can clinch at least a share of
the conference title if it runs the rest
of its schedule. Winning the confer
ence title is a feat Stanford has ac
complished nine out of the past 10
years, but most critics thought this
would be the year of the Bruin.
The story of the night, though, be
longed to Freuen. who has come on
strong of late, possibly feeling the

pressure as her Stanford eareer
comes to a close. Freuen did every
thing for the Cardinal (14-9,10-3 Pa
cific 10 Conference), shooting better
than 66 percent from the field while
constantly punishing the Bruins (19-
6,11-2 Fac-10) with her inside moves.
Late in the second half, Freuen
had one of the most fantastic moves
of the night. She drove down the right
baseline — coming up from under
the basket, contorting her body in
mid-air — and finally laid the ball in
over the Bruin defender.
More and more, Stanford is not
just about one player, and all of the
Cardinal's roster stepped up against
UCLA. Junior point guard Yvonne
Gbalazeh, while only scoring two
points, led the team to an 11 -point
lead when her fellow guard, Milena
Flores, had to sit out with four fouls.
Gbalazeh showcased her dribbling
skills, not always her strongest point,
as she was continually able to break
the full-court press that UCLA was
hoping would stop the Cardinal.
Sophomore center Carolyn Moos
led the team in rebounds with 11 and
also contributed 17 points to com
plete her team-leading fourth dou
ble-double of the season. While
Moos' counterpart on the team,
freshman Cori Enghusen, only
played for five minutes, her two
blocks against Janae Hubbard
helped keep UCLA's inside threat
from clawing her way to the basket.
While Freuen may have been the
story throughout the night, the final
play belonged to Yamasaki, who be
fore her final three had been only one
of nine from beyi >nd the arc, and due
to a minor rule infraction had not
