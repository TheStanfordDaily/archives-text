Stanford lore.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Friday: Stanford (14-9, 10-2 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) 87. No. 13 UCLA
(19-6.11-2)84.

■ Sunday: Stanford 60. USC (7-15
3-10)59.

This game had all elements of a
history-making story — a 34-point ef
fort by the team's lone senior, Regan
Freuen, a last- second shot by fresh
man Lindsey Yamasaki for the win
and impressive play off the bench by
a host of soon-to-be-legendary char
acters. The win also put the Cardinal
within a half game with UCLA and
Oregon for the Pac-10 lead.
The win. along with Sunday's vic
tory against IJSC (7-15, 3-10), put
Stanford's win streak at seven games,
and arguably makes it one of the
hottest teams in the nation. It also
tied Stanford's record in the loss col
umn with IJC'LA's. meaning that the
Cardinal can clinch at least a share of
the conference title if it runs the rest
of its schedule. Winning the confer
ence title is a feat Stanford has ac
complished nine out of the past 10
years, but most critics thought this
would be the year of the Bruin.
The story of the night, though, be
longed to Freuen. who has come on
strong of late, possibly feeling the

pressure as her Stanford eareer
comes to a close. Freuen did every
thing for the Cardinal (14-9,10-3 Pa
cific 10 Conference), shooting better
than 66 percent from the field while
constantly punishing the Bruins (19-
6,11-2 Fac-10) with her inside moves.
Late in the second half, Freuen
had one of the most fantastic moves
of the night. She drove down the right
baseline — coming up from under
the basket, contorting her body in
mid-air — and finally laid the ball in
over the Bruin defender.
More and more, Stanford is not
just about one player, and all of the
Cardinal's roster stepped up against
UCLA. Junior point guard Yvonne
Gbalazeh, while only scoring two
points, led the team to an 11 -point
lead when her fellow guard, Milena
Flores, had to sit out with four fouls.
Gbalazeh showcased her dribbling
skills, not always her strongest point,
as she was continually able to break
the full-court press that UCLA was
hoping would stop the Cardinal.
Sophomore center Carolyn Moos
led the team in rebounds with 11 and
also contributed 17 points to com
plete her team-leading fourth dou
ble-double of the season. While
Moos' counterpart on the team,
freshman Cori Enghusen, only
played for five minutes, her two
blocks against Janae Hubbard
helped keep UCLA's inside threat
from clawing her way to the basket.
While Freuen may have been the
story throughout the night, the final
play belonged to Yamasaki, who be
fore her final three had been only one
of nine from beyi >nd the arc, and due
to a minor rule infraction had not

even started the game. With no hesi
tation at all. however. Yamasaki set
up before a silent crowd and swished
the three for an 87-84 win with three
seconds on the clock.
"UCLA is an excellent team; I
think we just had a little more time to
prepare for them this time," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "I am really proud of how
our team played together; Regan had
a great game, a career high, and Lind
sev made a great basket, and that's
what our players do. they make
plays."
Stanford wasn't finished after Fri
day. though; the Cardinal still had a

tough matchup against IJSC. a team
that has been coming together re
cently after being decimated by in
juries.
Alter UCLA, the Cardinal
looked visibly tired throughout the
game, and the win was again decided
by last-second glory and superb
bench play.
Stanford was only able to build up
a five-point lead. 2 c )-24. going into
halftime, and IJSC used its athleti
cism to force 16 first-half turnovers.
Freuen continued her strong play
with 2-of-3 shooting in the first half,
but traveling violations and poor
passes continually disrupted the of
fensive flow.
Freshman forward Enjoli Izidor
contributed nine minutes of solid
play that included eight points. One

of those baskets came late in the sec
ond half when Stanford was down by
five, 56-51. Flores had taken the in
bounds pass for a fast break, only to
brick it off the glass. I/idor was able
to block out a defender, grab the ball,
and put it back in. keeping Stanford
in the game with under four minutes
to go.
Moos, who continued to crash the
boards and took down US for the
weekend, dazzled everyone at the
Lyons Center with her outside abili
ties. as she buried a three to put the
Cardinal up with less than a minute to
go.
After two free throws by Adrian
Williams of USC, Freuen took the
game into her capable hands, driving
through a Trojan defender for the
winning lavup.
