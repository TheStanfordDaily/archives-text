# Triple threat rises to top

"I really want to go into redesigning stuff, making
things better," said Stanford senior Amy Murakami of
her product design major.
And while Murakami, co-captain of the No. 8 Stan
ford women's gymnastics team, may have only been
speaking of her career plans, she may as well have been
describing the impact that her class of seniors has had on
Stanford's program.
Along with senior teammates Katie Fitzpatrick and
Tracey Kohl, Murakami has revitalized a Cardinal team
that had never before been a consistent force on the
women's collegiate gymnastics scene. This season Stan
ford finds itself in the thick of the national championship
race and has been ranked among the top 10 teams in the
country throughout the entire season.
But life as members of the Stanford women's gym
nastics team has not always been as peachy as this year.
Throughout their four-year careers, Fitzpatrick, Mu
rakami and Kohl have worked with three different
coaching staffs as the program struggled for stability and
success in the Pacific 10 Conference — consistently
ranked among the nation's toughest..
"We had some coaching troubles but I think that it
helped us grow closer," Fitzpatrick said. "If you could
see a silver lining to all the turmoil, that's it, that we're a

really close team and we all get along really well."
And so. even though the three spend much of the day
training together at the Ford Center, they decided to
spend even more time together as suitemates in this,
their final year together on the Farm.
Although each has a distinct personality, the bond
between the usually reserved Murakami, the gregarious
Kohl and the witty Fitzpatrick is quickly apparent.
"We're all very different and we each come from
very different backgrounds, but when you share some
thing that is so important to you. it definitely brings you
together," Kohl said. "It's hard to explain why we're so
close, we just are and we have been forever."
Because the three have such distinct personalities,
each takes a different approach to her role as a leader on
the 1998-99 squad.
According to second-year Stanford head coach
Mark Cook, Murakami leads by example. A three-time
Ail-American, Murakami is among the most accom
plished Cardinal gymnasts in school history, but you'd
never know it by her demeanor. Energetic yet soft-spo
ken. Murakami is more than modest about her accom
plishments.
"Amy would do anything in the world for anyone on
the team," Cook said. "She's a perfectionist and proba
bly the best technician I've seen in gymnastics."

The gymnastics team's success this season rests heavily on the efforts of its senior
triumvirate:Tracey Kohl, Katie Fitzpatrick, and Amy Murakami.
Winner of the Iron Cardinal
award for competing in the most all
around competitions on the team in
1997-98, Murakami's work ethic is
key to her success as a gymnast.
To get a sense of Amy Murakami
as a competitor, look no further than
her performance against Oregon
State on Jan. 29. When junior All-
American Larissa Fontaine went
down Jan. 22 with a broken finger,
Murakami responded with perhaps
one of her finest performances as a
('ordinal. Still feeling the effects of flu
symptoms that had limited her to one
event the previous week, Murakami
won two event titles while tying her
school record on the uneven bars
with a near-perfect 9.975 as the Car
dinal posted its highest team total of
the year.
In contrast to Murakami's calm
demeanor. Kohl brings a more high
energy approach to her leadership
duties.
"Tracy has just got an extreme
amount of energy," Cook said.
"She's very fun-loving and sponta
neous. She brings a kind of excite
ment and energy to our team."
While Murakami and Fitzpatrick
are more perfectionists, Kohl per
forms best when she is relaxed and
confident. But don't think that Kohl
is any less competitive than her fellow
seniors.
Specializing in the floor exercise
and vault. Kohl has also been asked
to compete on the beam this year.
" The floor exercise is really her
best event and when she hits a good
vault, it's really awesome," Cook
said.
Energy is perhaps her best at
tribute as a Kvmnast and a student. A

human biology major. Kohl won
honorable mention on the Pac-1()
All-Academic Team in 1997 and
plans to be a physical therapist. He
sides her academic and gymnastic ac
complishments, Kohl still finds time
to counsel at the Sexual Health Peer
Resource Center and perform for the
dance group Jam Pac'd.
Of the three seniors, Fitzpatrick
has had the most painful career. She
has been hampered by injuries in
every year on the Farm and will have
surgery on both ankles after the sea
son. And while the injuries have hin
dered her performance over the
years, Fitzpatrick has fought through
the pain and established herself as a
leader on the team.
One of the Cardinal's most consis
tent performers on the balance beam
and the uneven bars, Fitzpatrick was
one of only two Stanford gymnasts to
qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships in 1997 and went on to post
career highs in every event there.
"Katie is a rock; she's a very
strong-minded and determined
young lady," said Cook.
In this season of high expectations
for the Cardinal squad, each of these
three seniors hopes to end her career
in storybook fashion with a national
championship.
And why not?
The senior class of 1999 has left its
mark on the women's gymnastics
program and a first-ever champi
onship is not out of the question.
"It is so much fun to think of how
much potential we have, not just for
this year but for the future of the pro
gram as well," said Fitzpatrick.
And so as the three friends and
teammates prepare to end their ca
reers together, Murakami can rest as
sured that they have made things in
the Stanford women's gymnastics
program better.
"I really want to go into redesigning stuff, making
things better," said Stanford senior Amy Murakami of

very different backgrounds, but when you share some
thing that is so important to you. it definitely brings you
together," Kohl said. "It's hard to explain why we're so
close, we just are and we have been forever."
Because the three have such distinct personalities,
each takes a different approach to her role as a leader on
the 1998-99 squad.
According to second-year Stanford head coach
Mark Cook, Murakami leads by example. A three-time
Ail-American, Murakami is among the most accom
plished Cardinal gymnasts in school history, but you'd
never know it by her demeanor. Energetic yet soft-spo
ken. Murakami is more than modest about her accom
plishments.
"Amy would do anything in the world for anyone on
the team," Cook said. "She's a perfectionist and proba
bly the best technician I've seen in gymnastics."

The gymnastics team's success this season rests heavily on the efforts of its senior
triumvirate:Tracey Kohl, Katie Fitzpatrick, and Amy Murakami.
Winner of the Iron Cardinal
award for competing in the most all
around competitions on the team in
1997-98, Murakami's work ethic is
key to her success as a gymnast.
To get a sense of Amy Murakami
as a competitor, look no further than
her performance against Oregon
State on Jan. 29. When junior All-
American Larissa Fontaine went
down Jan. 22 with a broken finger,
Murakami responded with perhaps
one of her finest performances as a
('ordinal. Still feeling the effects of flu
symptoms that had limited her to one
event the previous week, Murakami
won two event titles while tying her
school record on the uneven bars
with a near-perfect 9.975 as the Car
dinal posted its highest team total of
the year.
In contrast to Murakami's calm
demeanor. Kohl brings a more high
energy approach to her leadership
duties.
"Tracy has just got an extreme
amount of energy," Cook said.
"She's very fun-loving and sponta
neous. She brings a kind of excite
ment and energy to our team."
While Murakami and Fitzpatrick
are more perfectionists, Kohl per
forms best when she is relaxed and
confident. But don't think that Kohl
is any less competitive than her fellow
seniors.
Specializing in the floor exercise
and vault. Kohl has also been asked
to compete on the beam this year.
" The floor exercise is really her
best event and when she hits a good
vault, it's really awesome," Cook
said.
Energy is perhaps her best at
tribute as a Kvmnast and a student. A

human biology major. Kohl won
honorable mention on the Pac-1()
All-Academic Team in 1997 and
plans to be a physical therapist. He
sides her academic and gymnastic ac
complishments, Kohl still finds time
to counsel at the Sexual Health Peer
Resource Center and perform for the
dance group Jam Pac'd.
Of the three seniors, Fitzpatrick
has had the most painful career. She
has been hampered by injuries in
every year on the Farm and will have
surgery on both ankles after the sea
son. And while the injuries have hin
dered her performance over the
years, Fitzpatrick has fought through
the pain and established herself as a
leader on the team.
One of the Cardinal's most consis
tent performers on the balance beam
and the uneven bars, Fitzpatrick was
one of only two Stanford gymnasts to
qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships in 1997 and went on to post
career highs in every event there.
"Katie is a rock; she's a very
strong-minded and determined
young lady," said Cook.
In this season of high expectations
for the Cardinal squad, each of these
three seniors hopes to end her career
in storybook fashion with a national
championship.
And why not?
The senior class of 1999 has left its
mark on the women's gymnastics
program and a first-ever champi
onship is not out of the question.
"It is so much fun to think of how
much potential we have, not just for
this year but for the future of the pro
gram as well," said Fitzpatrick.
And so as the three friends and
teammates prepare to end their ca
reers together, Murakami can rest as
sured that they have made things in
the Stanford women's gymnastics
program better.
