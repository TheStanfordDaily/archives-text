# Triple threat rises to top

"I really want to go into redesigning stuff, making
things better," said Stanford senior Amy Murakami of
her product design major.
And while Murakami, co-captain of the No. 8 Stan
ford women's gymnastics team, may have only been
speaking of her career plans, she may as well have been
describing the impact that her class of seniors has had on
Stanford's program.
Along with senior teammates Katie Fitzpatrick and
Tracey Kohl, Murakami has revitalized a Cardinal team
that had never before been a consistent force on the
women's collegiate gymnastics scene. This season Stan
ford finds itself in the thick of the national championship
race and has been ranked among the top 10 teams in the
country throughout the entire season.
But life as members of the Stanford women's gym
nastics team has not always been as peachy as this year.
Throughout their four-year careers, Fitzpatrick, Mu
rakami and Kohl have worked with three different
coaching staffs as the program struggled for stability and
success in the Pacific 10 Conference â€” consistently
ranked among the nation's toughest..
"We had some coaching troubles but I think that it
helped us grow closer," Fitzpatrick said. "If you could
see a silver lining to all the turmoil, that's it, that we're a

really close team and we all get along really well."
And so. even though the three spend much of the day
training together at the Ford Center, they decided to
spend even more time together as suitemates in this,
their final year together on the Farm.
Although each has a distinct personality, the bond
between the usually reserved Murakami, the gregarious
Kohl and the witty Fitzpatrick is quickly apparent.
"We're all very different and we each come from
very different backgrounds, but when you share some
thing that is so important to you. it definitely brings you
together," Kohl said. "It's hard to explain why we're so
close, we just are and we have been forever."
Because the three have such distinct personalities,
each takes a different approach to her role as a leader on
the 1998-99 squad.
According to second-year Stanford head coach
Mark Cook, Murakami leads by example. A three-time
Ail-American, Murakami is among the most accom
plished Cardinal gymnasts in school history, but you'd
never know it by her demeanor. Energetic yet soft-spo
ken. Murakami is more than modest about her accom
plishments.
"Amy would do anything in the world for anyone on
the team," Cook said. "She's a perfectionist and proba
bly the best technician I've seen in gymnastics."
