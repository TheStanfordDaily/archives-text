### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
The Stanford Parents' Club,
which is celebrating its 75th an
niversary, awarded its annual schol
arship to senior Geoffrey Gaisford
during its monthly meeting on Feb
9.
Scholarship eligibility is deter
mined by the Office of Financial
Aid. The scholarship is presented to
one undergraduate each year on be
half of the Parents' Club. While the
Parents' Club tries to alternate be
tween male and female recipients
and tries to give the award to out
of-state students, there are no defi

nite guidelines or requirements
other than financial need.
"We are notified by the Finan
cial Aid Office of who the student
is, and then we get to know the re
cipient throughout the remainder
of the year," said Carol Eger, the
scholarship chair. "Since we are a
locally based group, we want to
reach out to the entire population
by possibly aiding out-of-state stu
dents."
The scholarship is funded mostly
through Parents' Club fund raisers,
although some of the amount does
come from donations. The Parents'
Club also funds the scholarship by
selling services such as cakes, bal

loons and flowers for student birth
days and through a mail-order cata
log that offers Stanford memorabil
ia.
"I'm certainly very grateful for
the scholarship," Gaisford said. "I
think that [the Parents' Club] is a
very positive organization, and I
like the idea of parents that are in
volved in a continuing tradition. It's
nice to have that local support."
The Parents' Club will be pro
viding staff for the upcoming Par
ents' Weekend on Feb. 26 and 27.
The group also helps with Orienta
tion Weekend.
"In addition to fund raising for
the scholarship, we try to help the

University out with its year-round
events," said Carol Knowles, presi
dent of the Parents' Club.
The Parents' Club was founded
as the Mother's Club in 1924 as a
small group designed to promote
the welfare of students, mainly
through providing rest homes for ill
students, until the Student Health
Center was built in 1962. This
month, a bulletin board in Tresid
der Student Union outlines the Par
ents' Club's 75-year history.
"It's really amazing to see how
the club has grown over the years,
but how its basic goals have stayed
the same," said Nancy Stevens, the
Parents' Club's historian.
