# Stanford receives ocean studies grant
## 
### Fei Wu Contributing writer 
As the recipient of a $ 17.7 million
grant, the single largest scientific
grant ever made by the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation, Stan
ford and three other leading marine
science universities in Oregon and
California will soon begin a five-year
partnership in ocean studies.
Focusing on near-shore ecologi
cal patterns, the grant will link to
gether Oregon State University,
Stanford, UC-Santa Cruz and UC-
Santa Barbara in studying the
movements and interactions of ma
rine organisms along the 1,2(K)-mile
coastline stretching from Santa Bar
bara to the Washington-Oregon
border.
While the other three universities
will set up sites to carry out research
in near-shore ecology, Stanford will
use Hopkins Marine Station to edu
cate students and participating re

searchers in understanding marine
biology techniques.
The Hopkins Marine Station will
add a summer course for about 20
graduate and post-doctoral students
to study the biodiversity of marine
organisms, said Biology Prof.
George Somero, one of Stanford's
two principal investigators for the
project.
"The Stanford component of the
project is to provide training experi
ence for people who are primarily
ecologists in acquiring some current
methods that are used to help under
stand ecology," Somero said.
Specifically, he will teach the eco
logical physiology of near-coast en
vironment while Biology Prof. Mark
Denny, the other principal investiga
tor, will help students examine the
biomechanics of marine organisms.
"The course will link together
factors such as temperature, wind
velocity and salinity with the physi
ology of the organism," Somero

said. "The biomechanics compo
nent will look at the physics and de
sign of the whole organism, for ex
ample, how the shape of an organ
ism may help prevent it from losing
water, and I will look under the skin
and see the metabolism part of
things."
The course will last for four
weeks, from June 14 to July 9.
Somero said the advertisements for
the course will begin appearing this
week in Science and Nature, the two
most widely circulated science jour
nals. He expects applicants from
around the world.
In addition to the summer course,
the grant will also help fund year
round training for several additional
researchers at the Hopkins Marine
Station.
The other three partner universi
ties will couple field research with
the course.
Oregon State, UC-Santa Cruz
and UC-Santa Barbara are con

cerned with related questions, such
as how larvae movement near the
shore is affected by temperature and
current movements. The three uni
versities will research the issues from
different latitudes along the coast.
" There's lot of technology that's
available that was not there 10 years
ago," Denny said.
Somero said the idea for the stud
ies first came three to four years ago
when Denny and he began talking
about their interest in teaching a
course in near-shore ecology. Re
searchers from other universities
with similar interests joined in their
proposal.
"The course became the nucleus
for research," Somero said. "We
said, 'Let's go into things together
and we can coordinate better.'"
Somero said it would be difficult
to find funding for a research project
of this scale from government-fund
ed grants such as those from the Na
tional Science Foundation.
