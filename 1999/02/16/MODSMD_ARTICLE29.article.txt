# Professor calculates toll of sedentary lifestyles
## Bad news for e-mail addicts

William Haskell has found that time
spent e-mailing can translate into
weight gain. According to his calcu
lations, students who e-mail for two
minutes an hour for eight hours a day
instead of visiting friends could gain
11 pounds over the course of 10
years.
Haskell, a medical school profes
sor, calculated these statistics based
on a formula of energy use and calo
rie consumption. He presented them
at a recent scientific meeting on ex
ercise, weight and diet.
His statistics touched on obesity,
one of the most pressing issues dis
cussed at the conference. Currently
34 percent of Americans are over
weight, and American adults can
gain an average of 10 to 12 pounds
of body weight over the course of
10 to 15 years. Since adults are like
ly to exert less energy than they did
at a younger age. they lose muscle
mass. "This should result in a
downward trend in weight, but we
see the opposite happening,"
Haskell said.
Haskell and colleagues theorized
that the upward trend in weight
among Americans may be partly a
result of a "decrease in energy de
mands created by a rapid advance in
computers and technology."
"Years ago we had patrolmen
who would walk about the area pa
trolling, now we have watchmen
who sit at the control desk watching
their monitors," Haskell said. "What
if we traded walking five minutes
every hour, eight hours a day and
five days a week for sitting?"
Haskell calculated the number of
calories expended by an individual
walking 2 miles per hour, taking into
account the individual's body
weight. He equated the numbers of

calories to pounds of body fat and
found that walking for 2.5 minutes
an hour for eight hours a day, five
days a week, in the course of 10 years
will expend 9to 11 pounds. Statistics
show that the average American
adult gains the same number of
pounds in about the same number of
years.
According to Haskell, "The in
crease in body weight is not due to an
increase in calorie intake but a de
crease in expenditure." He recom
mended that adults older than 20 do
resistive exercises that involve lifting
and pulling to avoid losing muscle
mass. This should maintain the level
of energy expenditure to prevent
weight gain, according to Haskell.
But does the body simply slow
down as a result of age? Haskell ar
gues that weight gain is not a genetic
manifestation of age.
"Genetically, the body wants to
conserve energy in body weight, but
the actual weight gain is environ
mental, due to some calorie imbal
ance," Haskell said.
A person's cells retain the same
composition as he or she ages.
Therefore, a person maintaining
close to the same amount of exercise
should reap nearly the same benefit
at any age, according to Haskell.
Freshman Steve Doane was skep
tical about the claim that a 2.5-
minute walk every hour eight times a
day consumes 11 pounds in the
course of 10 years. "Haskell is right
in saying simply that walking is bet
ter than sitting, but [the statement]
does not take into account many
other factors that contribute to body
weight," Doane said.
Sophomore Miho Tanaka added
that "people do things to compen
sate for what they don't do." She
asked. "How many people iive such
routine lives that one single change
will make such a difference?"
