### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
The University's decision to deny tenure to pop
ular English Prof. Robert Warrior has disappoint
ed faculty and led students to question the Univer
sity's commitment to Native American Studies.
Warrior, one of only two professors in the Na
tive American Studies program, was notified Mon
day by University officials that he would not re
ceive tenure, according to several professors in the
English department.
"I'm very disappointed about the decision; 1 en
tirely didn't expect it. My understanding is that
there was strong support among the senior faculty
to see him tenured." English Prof. Paula Mova said.
"I think Robert is an outstanding scholar."

Denial of tenure means that
Warrior's faculty position at
Stanford will end with his current
appointment at the end of the
1999-2(KX) academic year. Over
the next year, however. Warrior
will continue in all of his academ
ic duties.
The English department rec
ommended Warrior for tenure.

and the decision not to grant it to him was made at
the next higher level of review, which is the Hu
manities and Sciences Dean's Office.
"Negative tenure decisions are always painful,
but they are taken with only great care and sensi
tivity," said Prof. Malcolm Beasley, dean of Hu
manities and Sciences.

No professor has been granted tenure in the past
10 years in the English department, leading some
people to question why Warrior was denied tenure.
"It's very disheartening to hear the news, and
I'm pretty much in a state of shock right now,"
English Prof. Sharon Holland said. "I don't under
stand why this decision was made. Since I've been
here, no one has been granted tenure."
"There's no one else doing what Robert is
doing, and I feel that it's a great loss, especially since
there's no indication that they're going to hire
someone else in Native American Studies as a re
placement," Moya said. "Robert has the book on
the Native American movement, and it's just a
tremendous loss."
