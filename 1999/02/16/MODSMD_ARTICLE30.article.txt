# No. 1 Card serves up two
## Stanford breezes by Northwestern, Rice 6-1, 6-1 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
The men's tennis team showed why it is ranked No. 1
this past weekend with two convincing 6-1 wins over
Northwestern and Rice. The Cardinal asserted its domi
nance early Friday afternoon against Northwestern and
used its fast start to build confidence throughout the
weekend.
The match scores are a good indication of how the
team took charge and played the kind of tennis it is capa
ble of playing. But an even better indication is how few
sets the Cardinal lost on both Friday and Saturday.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Friday: No. 1 Stanford (4-0) 6. Northwestern (2-2) I
■ Saturday: Stanford 6, Rice (3-2) 1.

"We had a very successful weekend on the whole," said
head coach Dick Gould. "1 was pleased with our doubles
play both days — we have been working on doubles a lot
because to get the that point can be critical. I also think we
got off to fast starts both days and never really gave North
western or Rice an opening."
The Cardinal's fast starts and good team play despite
the absence of its No. 3 singles player, sophomore Alex
Kim. Kim was out with a stress fracture in his left shin and
is questionable for this weekend's team indoors competi
tion in Washington. But the Cardinal used Kim's injury as
motivation to come together and raise its level of play.
" This weekend showed us we are capable of lifting our
level when we need to." said No. 1 singles player Ryan
Wolters. "With Alex out. we all needed to step up and
show we can overcome a little adversity. This gives us con
fidence going into the indoors because we know we can
handle injuries and not let them get us down."
Wolters did exactly this in his doubles match on Satur
day against Rice. He and his partner, freshman K.J. Hip
pensteel, faced three match points after falling behind 7-5
before coming back to win l )-X. Hippensteel came up big
by winning his serve on all three of those points, and then
both he and Wolters hit four perfect returns to break at 6-

7. They ended up pulling it out 7-5 in the tiebreaker.
This was perhaps the key match of the weekend be
cause not only was it for the doubles point, it also took the
wind out of Rice going in to the singles. It was only mo
ments alter the Cardinal had lost the No. 2 doubles spot,
and it looked as if it would surely lose the point.
"We knew that if we lost the doubles point it would
give them some hope," said Wolters. "By coming back
from the match points and turning it around, 1 think we
kind of took all of their momentum away from them. Both
of the players we were playing against seemed to then
come out flat for their singles matches."
Wolters' ability to come back late in matches when the
team needs it shows why he is the Cardinal's senior leader.
The other players used his win as a spark going into their
matches.
"I was very pleased with the way the [Nos.] 4-6 players
performed this weekend," said assistant coach John
Whitlinger. "In the close matches the bottom of the line
up is usually what it comes down to, and to see them play
the way they did is encouraging. We need to keep building
on that kind of play."
The idea of building toward the NCA As in May seems
to be a Cardinal trademark. Il is an idea that both Gould
and Whitlinger feel strongly about, and it rubs off on the
players. They look at each match as an experience and a
way to continue to improve for May.
"We know there are still things we need to work on. but
this weekend was a solid step in the right direction for us."
said sophomore Scotty Scott. "I thought K.J. did a great
job of stepping up and playing on the stadium courts. That
is not easy to do as a freshman, and he deserves a lot of
credit. He seems like the kind of player that has fun with
new challenges and actually thrives off of them."
Hippensteel is not the only Cardinal player who
stepped up and played well in a new role. Junior Vijay
Sekhon replaced Kim to fill the Cardinal's No. 6 spot, and
although he did lose, his play was encouraging. 1 le proved
that he is capable of filling a hole in the Cardinal's lineup.
"Vijay played well and was close, he just had trouble
finishing sets." (iould said. "That comes with match expe
rience. though. For his first matches in the lineup he did
fine."
