## Come and Get Mel 
### Chiara Smutina 
Sketchy

People complain there is no romance at Stanford. I
heartily disagree, those dateless chumps are only looking
in the wrong places. I get plenty of action, even though I
don't shave my armpits.
1 like men, not boys. Real men are not afraid to tell me
what they want. They will grab my booty on the dance
floor, as I shake in my special way. I practice shaking my
booty in my bathroom mirror. I send messages to the
dorm e mail list inviting all the boys to the second floor
bathroom to watch my booty practice sessions.
Two in the morning is the most romantic time of night.
I uo to the Row and meet bovs who give me beer because

they are in love with me. They ask me my name and I tell them I am the Seductress
of Santa Teresa. I give then my business card. It is an animated picture of me shak
ing my booty.
Sometimes I go to the row and there is no more beer. The men tell me there is a
keg in their room. I know this is secret code for, "You are the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen."
I keep my lip liner, foundation, hairspray and blow dryer, along with other items,
in my Dr. Smutina's medical kit. I make sure I reapply my makeup before my man
wakes up. I strategically misplace my spandex booty pants so I have to walk home
draped in his sheets. Then he must come visit me to get his bed coverings.
Sometimes a man will tell me he is not in love with me the next day. I tell him I am
knocked up, that I am having his baby. He says this is impossible, I tell him he does
not understand a woman's body. I make him marry me in Tijuana. This plan has not
worked vet
