# Meet S.K.E.T.C.H.Y

### Stanley Kevin Edvard Theo Christian Hans York 
I am he whose name is that of the five men who could
possibly have been my father, but names are unimportant
when you have as many as I.
1 am he whose ass you have all seen. And will see again.
Repeatedly.
I am he who inhabits this body with its strange, oily
sheen. I bottle my corporeal ooze and sell it as hair "prod
uct.' 1 have made millions. (Combined with aerosol it
makes a mean non-stick spray that's great for baking cook-

ies, cakes or just drying your underwear in the oven on a cookie sheet.)
I am he who drives a Ford Econoline van with a twin bed in the back. (I could
11 ford a queen, but then it would be more difficult for us to cuddle.)
I am he who goes to the post office with twenty pink slips and laughs when you
complain that you never get your packages.
I am he who wears Victoria Secret lingerie, J. Crew sweaters, and Lands End fleeces
.md listens to Ani DeFranco CDs from BMG while eating Christmas fruitcakes.
I am he who calls all women "Hot Cakes" and all breakfast food "Francine."
1 am he who is always in your dorm, the one who approaches you in the hall and
offers to give you a full body massage. You refuse, so I nibble on your ear. With your
elbow you jab at my gonads, so I jumps backwards, clutching at my lower abdominal
area in "great pain," howling like a "wee lass." I fool you. You are lucky that I do not
retaliate with my mad tai-chi skills.
1 am he who sits in a wheelchair on Saturdays so that I can sit courtside at Maples.
I am he who has a fetish. I only date people with hair.
1 am he with whom you would never entrust your pet or your pro-fro.
1 am he who urinates out his window in a drunken stupor.
I am he who realizes that his window was closed last night and someone came in
and urinated on it. Now 1 play "Assassin" with a watergun filled with petrol. I will
find you.
I am he whom you meet in White Plaza as you stand with a group of friends, one
of whom I know. Your mutual acquaintance introduces you to me. You extend your
hand to shake mine. 1 receive it but do not let go for several minutes, all the while
silently watching you with a half-smile and a gaze that screams "C.S. MAJOR." You
attempt to make conversation, asking me where I am from. I softly reply without
moving my lips, "Ye 5...."
Love me.
