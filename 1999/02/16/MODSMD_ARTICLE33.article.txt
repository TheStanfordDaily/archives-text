# FREAKS OF THE FARM

Take a look around the Stanford com
munity on a given day. Inhale the palm
oil drifting in the brisk spring sunlight.
As you sip your Jamba Juice, you might
see out of the corner of your eye some
thing vile, obscene or grotesque. You are
afraid to take a look — and for good rea
son. It might attack. It might cling to you
for dear life and never let go. It is the
essence of sketchiness.
You wonder how these individuals
were admitted to this fine, prestigious
institution. True, Stanford opts .not to
interview its prospective freshmen. But
even on paper, there must have certainly
been sketchy cues that should have cried

out to the admissions offi
cers. Whether it was late at
night or the readers were
under the influence of some
strange, foreign element,
several questionable individ
uals slipped by the keen and
ever-so-observant eyes of
the current and former Dean
of Undergraduate
Admissions, Robert Kinally
and James Montoya. Here
are some excerpts from the
essays of actual Stanford
admits. The question was
simply "Tell us about your
self."
ERIK VAN DER WOHL

Now a junior, international relations
"When I was 11,1 overheard a signifi
cant conversation in a bathroom stall at
CIA headquarters. From the top-secret
government information that I attained
on this elementary school field trip gone
awry, I was able to start plans on what I
am convinced will soon become the sin
gle most influential invention in western
civilization. 1 am now in the final phases
of completing a nuclear weapon that has
the potential to blow up the entire uni
verse. It is the size of a pea. 1 strongly sug
gest that you admit me to your school."

X AVI ERA HOPE
Now a sophomore, feminist studies
"You — Who are you?
You are probably a white devil —
The type of man I would CASTRATE
If we were alone in a dark alley.
You —
You want to Hump, screw And fondle.
I want to gain Tools for the Everyday life,
you chauvinistic f—k!
YOU have the power to make my future.
But I'm telling you right now,
motherf—cker:
I will not sleep with you to get into your
school.
P.S. I decided to enclose a little something
extra with my application just in case my
academics aren't strong enough. Enjoy
the stripper!"

CHIP McDOUGAL
Now a sophomore, computer science
"Last night I got into a huge fight with
one of my friends. It was as if he wasn't
listening to me. And I began to wonder if
our relationship was falling apart.
I would type in one thing, and he
would print something else. After I con
fronted him, he just froze and gave me a
blank stare, as if to suggest that he was
innocent. But I know him too well. He
didn't fool me. All I had to do was restart
him and turn off his extensions. That

showed him who's boss!"
ERNEST KINALLY
Now a freshman, undeclared
"Dear Uncle Bob —
This is so stupid that you're making me
do this. My friends are waiting for me to
go to a party right now and I don't have
time for this crap. Give it a rest. I took the
SAT's and got over 900 like 1 promised.
Isn't that enough? Dad told me that you
told him that I have to put some effort
into this. Is that true?
I refuse to fill out these god damn
forms anymore. Go ahead — don't admit
me. You're the one who will have to
answer to grandma!"
SASHA MONTGOMERY
Now a senior, American studies

"I pride myself on being
a community service
activist. For instance,
whenever a person drops
a piece of trash on the
ground at my school, I
always remind them that
school is not like home
where we have maids to
clean up after us.
I feel that I would be
most suited for Stanford,
where I could go into the
community help out all
of the bums — giving
them my leftover food
and teaching them man
ners. I could also serve as
a fashion consultant to
some friends when we

go to the Stanford Shopping Center."
MIKE WELLS
Now a freshman track team member
"I couldn't think about things to write,
so the coach told me to say why I like
doing shot put:
When I get the metal shot in my hands,
I feel very powerful and special. I think
that 1 can throw it far into the parking lot
and dent a lot of cars. But I wouldn't get
in trouble because everyone would be
happy that 1 set a world record."


Let the kid in!
