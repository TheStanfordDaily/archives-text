"We played very well in each of
our afternoon games," said Stanford
head coach John Fanner. "But our
morning games were not quite as
good."
Stanford started off the weekend

with a 7-4 victory
over No. 10 San
Jose State on Fri
day afternoon.
Sophomore Dani
Bell led the Cardi
nal offense with
three goals. After
a scoreless first
quarter, Stanford

secured a 2-0 lead by halftime.
All four of the Spartans' goals
came in the second half, but the Car
dinal was able to maintain its lead
throughout the match. Junior Elissa
Keszler and sophomores Kelly
Shouey, Anne-Marie Keenan and
Hilary Gallogly each contributed
one point to the Cardinal win.
On Saturday morning, the Cardi
nal downed No. 6 UC-Santa Bar
bara in a 6-1 decision. Although
UCSB took a 1-0 lead in the first
quarter, goalie Heather Crary shut
out the Gaucho offense in the three
remaining periods.
Leading Stanford's attack was
freshman Margie Dingeldein, who
tallied her first three goals of the sea
son during the match. Bell, Shouey
and sophomore Kris Koblik each
scored once.
Later in the afternoon, Stanford

defeated No. 7 San Diego State 8-5
in one of the Cardinal's best games
of the weekend.
The Aztecs led 1-0 after the first
quarter, but Stanford scored three
goals in the second period to take a
3-2 lead. After taking the lead, the
Cardinal never trailed, thanks to the
efforts of both Stanford's talented
defense and impressive offensive
two-meter players.
Shouey, one of the Cardinal's pri
mary hole-sets, notched three points
for the Cardinal. Bell, whose seven
goals in five games made her Stan
ford's leading scorer for the tourna
ment, put two goals past the SDSU
defense.
"Our two meter players — which
a lot of people think is a weakness on
our team — played very well," Tan
ner said. "Especially Kelly Shouey
and [freshman] Kate Pettit. And
Dani Bell did a great job coming in
[to set hole] as well."
Rounding out the scoring for the
Cardinal were Dingeldein, Koblik
and senior Lindsay Tam with one

point apiece.
Unfortunately, after three great
showings, Stanford was unable to
shut down the Cal offense in Sunday
morning's semifinal match.
"Cal looked really balanced,"
Tanner said. "They've got a lot of
depth this year."
But the biggest obstacle for the
Cardinal was the Golden Bears' Co
lette Glinkowski. who scored five of
her team's six goals in the 6-3 deci
sion. Gallogly. Keenan and Shouey
scored one goal each for the Cardi
nal, but the Stanford attack wasn't
strong enough to penetrate Cal's
tough defense.
Despite the disappointing loss,
Stanford bounced back to beat the
No. 4 Bruins in the third-place
match.
Each team scored once in the first
quarter and twice in the second to
end the half in a 3-3 tie. But in the
third period, Stanford scored three
points while the Cardinal defense
held UCLA scoreless.
A key part of Stanford's defense
was senior Nicole Glazer, who shut
down UCLA's tough hole-set.
"Nicole did a fantastic job," Tan
ner said. "She was sick, but she
guarded UCLA's best offensive
player and really had her under con
trol."
Although the Bruins scored the
only goal in the fourth quarter, Stan
ford played strong defense to secure
the 6-4 victorv.
