# Borchard slams two homers in Sunday victory over Broncos
## Stanford offense sparks sweep 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Tenth-ranked Stanford (7-3) fi
nally lived up to its ranking this
weekend, putting together three
games of solid pitching and timely
hitting to beat local rival Santa Clara
(1-6), 6-2,7-6 and 7-1.
The Cardinal started the season
off poorly, going 1-3 in its first four
games. However, since then, Stan
ford has ripped off six in a row, in
cluding this weekend's sweep of the
Broncos, which gave head coach
Mark Marquess wins 900, 901 and
902.
"[ The series] was really good,"
said senior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang. "It's our first sweep
and it's always good to know you can
be consistent enough to play three
quality games and get three wins in a
row."
"But, also, the pitching was

above-average to really good and
the hitting finally came along.
Everyone really contributed to this
weekend, which was good for our
team."
The Cardinal's 7-1 victory yester
day at Santa Clara (1-6) was espe
cially impressive as Stanford racked
up 10 hits behind the complete
game pitching of sophomore Jason
Young (2-1,2.08 ERA).
Young allowed three hits, only
one of which left the infield, while
striking out eight. In 26 innings, the
right-hander has given up just 15 hits
while fanning 28.
"I'm very pleased with how he's
pitching," Marquess said. "He's had
two fabulous performances in a
row."
As usual. Young looked confi
dent and in control on the mound,
talking to himself and to opposing
batters.
"If I get out there and don't stay

vocal, at least to myself, then I don't
really stay in the game," he said. "I
do a little bit of talking, but it's all to
keep myself focused."
While Marquess is loathe to es
tablish a defined pitching order so
early in the season. Young's recent
performance and self-confidence
certainly help his case to be the No. 1
starter throughout the year.

Young pitched outstandingly
Sunday, but the Cardinal bats made
sure they put up enough support.
Stanford used both the long-ball and
the bunt to put up seven runs off of
10 hits.
Hochgesang led the team again,
going 2 for 5 with a double and a
three-run home run that started off
the Cardinal's scoring in the first in
ning. He also leads the team with a
.732 slugging percentage.
"1 seem to have some pretty hot
days and then other days when I
struggle," Hochgesang said. "Some
times, you get away from the funda
mentals, but today I just went back
to going up and seeing the ball hit the
bat."
While Hochgesang's shot gave
Stanford an early cushion. Marquess
showed he was not content to wait
for another home run.
As he has done recently. Mar
quess allowed his baserunners to be
aggressive and took any opportunity
to move them around the bases.
Twice Marquess had junior short
stop Eric Bruntlett lay down a sacri
fice bunt. Each led to a run.
Junior first baseman John Gall,
junior left fielder Craig Thompson
and junior second baseman Jeff
Rizzo all had encouraging games for
Stanford. All three had been hitting
the ball well, but none of them had
much luck finding holes in the de
fense. However, yesterday, each was
effective.
While Stanford scored just as
many runs in Sunday's 7-6 win as it
did Monday, the Cardinal only had
half as many hits. However, the Car
dinal was able to hold off Santa
Clara Sunday at Sunken Diamond

with three timelv home runs

Hochgesang led off the second
inning with a single, followed by a
walk from junior catcher Damien
Alvarado. Junior Joe Borchard then
hit his first home run of the year, an
opposite-field line drive that cleared
the left-field scoreboard.
After a walk to Rizzo, Thompson
hit his first home run of the year, a
liner to right.
The Broncos clawed back into
the game with four runs off of fresh
man Mike Gosling. Gosling, a left
hander who has struggled in his early
outings, gave up three hits and two
walks in the inning before Marquess
took him out.
However, Borchard again gave
the Cardinal a boost, jacking a tow
ering home run to right field to give
Stanford a 6-4 lead.
The Broncos made a game of it,
putting up two runs in the bottom of
the ninth. But Borchard's bombs,
and a fifth-inning insurance run, had
given the Cardinal enough to pull it
out.
"I just finally saw some good
pitches and 1 took advantage of
them," Borchard said. "I felt good
swinging the bat and I was lucky
enough to get two out of the park."
Sunday's game also saw fresh
man outfielder Jason VanMeetren
take the mound for the Cardinal.
While he had pitched in high school,
VanMeetren came to Stanford as an
outfielder. However, Marquess used
the right-hander with some success
in an inter-squad scrimmage Thurs
day and. based on that, brought
VanMeetren out for two-and-a
third scoreless innings Sunday.
"It came up real recently that we
might need someone to come in and
pick up some innings and I just want
ed to help the team." said VanMee
tren (1 -0, ().(X) ERA). "I was real ner
vous; it's been a long time since I've
thrown. I was just pleased I could
throw strikes."
Friday's 6-2 victory again saw the
Cardinal struggle for hits, coming
through with only six that all came in
the first two innings. However the
pitching was solid as sophomore
Justin Wayne (1-1, 5.95 ERA)
pitched seven strong innings and
freshman Brian Sager (1-0, 1.50
ERA) looked sharp closing out the
game.
The game was especially impor
tant because it marked Marquess's
900 th win. Marquess, who played for
Stanford for three years and gradu
ated in 1969, is in his 22nd year as
head coach for the Cardinal.
