# Hoops falters in OT loss to Trojans, 86-82
## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
When you play with fire, eventu
ally you get burned.

This cliche rang all too true for
the Stanford men's basketball team
on Saturday, as the No. 8 Cardinal
(20-5, 10-2 Pacific 10 Conference)
was unable to battle back from its

seventh consecutive halftime deficit
and suffered a shocking 86-82 OT
defeat to USC (12-10.4-9).
When trying to understand this
team's propensity to start slowly,
one must go back as far as last
March and analyze the team's run
through the NCAA Tournament.
What becomes plainly obvious is
that this team's nature is to put its
hand way too close to the burning
candle — to push the limits of the
believable.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Thursday: No. 7 Stanford (20-5
10-2 Pacific 10 Conference) 77, No
16 UCLA (17-7,8-5)73.

■ Saturday: USC (12-10, 4-9) 86
Stanford 82.

After all, Stanford took the
biggest step in the men's basketball
program's history in exactly that
fashion.
Last March in the Elite Eight
game against Rhode Island, the
Cardinal was down six points with
59 seconds remaining. On the
strength of Arthur Lee's 13 points in
the final two minutes, Stanford
pulled an improbable victory out of
the fire and rolled into the Final
Four.
So maybe the tendency is in
grained for Stanford — get down
early, no problem. Just pull it out in
the end.
Whatever the tendency, the Car
dinal needs to change, because — as
evidenced by Saturday's loss — that
plan doesn't always work out.
"This is what we get," 1 Lee said.
"We think we can come back and
win anytime in the second half. You

can't do that every time."
But the Cardinal did come close
to winning once again on Saturday.
Trailing by 11 with 10 minutes, 42
seconds to go, Lee again became
Mr. Clutch. The Stanford floor gen
eral scored 13 points in the next
seven minutes.
Lee's late-game heroics gave the
Cardinal a one-point lead with 3:28
remaining. From that point, it was a
back-and-forth ballgame, featuring
a number of ties and lead changes.
But the real action began with
just under 20 seconds left on the
scoreboard.
USC's Elias Ayuso, nicknamed
El Rifle for his deadly shooting
touch, missed a long range three
pointer as time expired on the shot
clock. The ball quickly found its way
into Lee's hands.
It looked like a perfectly scripted
Hollywood drama would be played
out in front of the burgundy-clad
boys from Los Angeles.
All Lee would have to do was
knock down an outside shot, or even
better, penetrate and dish off to cen
ter Tim Young or forward Mark
Madsen in the paint.
He did none of the above. Lee
waited until there were only eight
seconds left to make his move. With
four ticks left, he was still outside
the three-point line, and when he
tried to create some space for a look
at the basket, he lost control of the
ball and any chance to get a set shot
off. He launched a back-to-the-bas
ket hook shot three-pointer as time
expired, but it never had a chance.
In the wake of his first-ever
blown opportunity in such a situa
tion, Lee sat on the floor near half
court, head buried between his

knees.
"I knew time was running out,"
Lee said. "I tried to go through the
legs but they double-teamed [me].
We had the opportunity to win it —
I had the ball in my hands. We just
didn't execute."
The Cardinal got off to another
slow start in overtime and was down
six in the blink of an eye. Stanford
fought back to within two, 76-74. On
the next USC possession, however,
center Brian Scalabrine pulled off
the most miraculous shot of his ca
reer, a 21-foot three-pointer over
Madsen as the shot clock expired.
That rainbow — the first three of
the season for Scalabrine — was the
final dagger in the heart of the
comeback kids.
USC did hit some unbelievable
shots down the stretch. To go with
Scalabrine's heroic trifecta, point
guard Brandon Granville hit count
less NBA-range threes en route to
21 points.
"We came out flat as a pancake,"
said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We got outplayed, I
don't think there's any question
about that. Goodness gracious, we
get a chance at the last shot of the
game, and we didn't even get a shot
off.
"We tried to make [our players]
understand that USC was capable of
beating us. Apparently, they didn't
believe us. We've got nobody to
blame but ourselves. Mentally we
were some place else."
As a result, Stanford's lead in the
Pac-10 over Arizona has been whit
tled to one game, while Washington
— the Cardinal's next opponent —
moved to within two and a half this
weekend.
