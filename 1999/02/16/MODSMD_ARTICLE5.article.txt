# Regina Casper urges support for anorexics
## Psychiatry prof, has spent more than 20 years studying eating disorders, body image 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
Though she has dedicated herself to studying
the subject for more than 20 years. Psychiatry
Prof. Regina Casper has never understood
anorexia nervosa.
After all. growing up in wartime Germany,
she and her family never had much to eat.
Casper said she spent most of her childhood
"pretty much starving."
"In school, we were fed Hoover meals, part
of the relief effort for German children in the
Second World War." she said. "We would bring
a metal container and a spoon to school and we
got food around 10 in the morning, like cheese
and noodles and other things cooked together.
These meals kept us alive. Most of the time dur
ing my student days we had nothing else to eat."
So when she first came in contact with
anorexics while playing in a medical school or
chestra in southern Germany, she found the dis
ease bizarre, she said.
"I saw these young women (patients) coming
down the staircase like skeletons, very thin and
very proud," she said. "I thought that it was very
strange. The fact that you could use food per
versely like that was amazing to me."

That amazement has driven Casper to study
anorexia for more than 20 years, including seven
at Stanford. Last week, the wife of University
President Gerhard Casper discussed her work at
the Women Center's 1999 Distinguished Facul
ty Lecture.
"I think we do not know the prevalence of
eating disorders at Stanford," she said. "1 do
think that most of the students who have
anorexia came to the campus with anorexia.
During freshman year, we ought to he prepared
to help them."
The new setting can prove enough to re-trig
ger anorexia, she said. "Most have come with
the problem hut thought they were better." she
said. "The stress of the new environment throws
them off balance."
In a study of 120 Stanford athletes several
years ago. Casper found that 90 percent of the
male athletes liked the way they looked most of
the time, compared to only 45 percent of fe
males. Additionally. 100 percent of the females
wished to change some parts of their body.
Casper stressed that students suffering from
these disorders must believe they can talk to
someone, and that the community must be sup
portive.
"With eating disorders, the person denies the
problem," she said. "I'hey are secretive,
ashamed, and they live a life of lies, which I
think is very painful. The resident fellow has to
recognize that this denial does not help the per
son."
One group on campus that focuses on help

ing students with these problems is Body Image,
Food and Self Esteem. A member of this group,
junior Antonia Welch, spoke of her experiences
with anorexia at Casper's lecture.
"Eating disorders are particularly prevalent
on the Stanford campus because of the tremen
dous amount of academic pressure and stress,
especially on freshmen coming in." Welch said.
"Most of us came from high positions in high
school. There is an expectation when you come
to Stanford that you will really distinguish your
self here as well."
Welch and other members of BIFSE are
looking into giving freshmen a presentation
about eating disorders and getting help at the be
ginning of the year, Casper said.
"1 think this is a very good idea," she said.
"The entire freshman class would be invited to a
panel to discuss body image problems. 1 want to
help [BIFSE] set up something like this."
Casper said that people must look to find
other meaning in their lives than dieting.
"These patients need to reflect on where they
need to go in their lives," she said. "They need
to unravel why they have become so enamored
with this process."
Casper attended medical school at the Uni
versities of Berlin. Geneva and Freiburg and
had a one-year postdoctoral fellowship in the
Department of Physiology at UC-Berkeley.
Initially, she studied schizophrenia and de
pressive disorders. She later began researching
anorexia nervosa, bulimia ner
vosa, and other eating disorders
after receiving funding to conduct
a treatment study at the University
of Illinois.
There she ran a research ward
where she was able to hospitalize
patients as long as was needed in
order to improve their conditions.
"Because there was almost no
charge for the treatment, it meant
that many people got better," she
said.
Since that experience. Casper
has conducted much research in
eating disorders, and she brought
her knowledge to a primarily fe
male audience in the Women's
Center last Wednesday night.
In addition to her research and
speeches, Casper wrote a paper in
1980 that noted the differences be
tween bulimia and restricting
anorexia — the first ol its kind.
Last year she released a book,
"Women's Health: Hormones.
Emotions, and Bellas ior."
