# Acquittal no surprise at Stanford
## 
### Erica Platt Contributing writer 
Stanford students had a break from classes Monday on
account of President's Day, hut this year. President's Day
took on a whole new meaning.
The Senate on Friday rejected the two articles of im
peachment brought against President Clinton, voting to
acquit him on the charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice. After a year of scandal and investigation, the five
week-long Senate trial of the president came to an end:
and as the Senate closed its deliberations, Stanford stu
dents and historians were handed a new set of questions to
ponder on their extra day off.
Many pundits had anticipated such a verdict from the
Senate. " This was the expected outcome. There really was
no surprise," History Prof. Douglas Rivers said. "Really
the Republicans could have pushed for a strong censure
resolution, but at the end of the day, they just didn't have
enough support for impeachment."
In response to his acquittal Clinton addressed the na
tion and said, "how profoundly sorry 1 am for what I said
and did to trigger these events and the great burden they
have imposed on the Congress and the American people."
The President went on to add that, " This can be and this
must be a time of reconciliation and renewal for Ameri
ca."
It appears many Stanford students are simply happy
that the impeachment has reached its
conclusion. As senior Lisa Gilley, a
geological and environmental sci
ences major, noted, "I think most of
us are glad that its all over. Hopef ully,
we can move on to other issues now."
Yet, others are not so quick to dis
miss the case, pointing to questions of
character and personal conduct. Ju
nior Robert Hsieh said, "I feel Clin
ton should have gotten a little more
than a slap on the hand."
Sophomore Huat Chye Lim
agreed, hut added, "I think the presi
dent acted wrongfully, but I'm happy
he wasn't removed. His actions may
be wrong but they don't rise to the
level of high crimes and misde
meanors."
In the wake of the first impeach
ment to be conducted under the inde
pendent counsel law, it will now be up
to historians to judge the outcome.
Meanwhile, the debate over whether
the impeachment process worked or
failed certainly continues.
"A lot of members of Congress
point to this trial as an example of

how the Constitution works," Histo
ry Prof. Jack Rakove said. "But I'm
really more concerned about the
whole mechanism of impeachment. "
"If we are to keep in mind the idea
of history," noted Rakove, "we
should realize that the questions fu
ture historians will ask are essentially
the same ones we are asking our
selves today."
Rakove points to three major
questions facing future historians:
Why did the Republicans allow their
animosity to get the better of them?
Why did Clinton take such serious
risks? And why did the Democrats
rally around Clinton?
For now, the impeachment drive
has left the Republican party at
record lows in public opinion polls,
while Clinton has retained some of
the highest job approval ratings of his
presidency. But many in both parties
believe that public opinion could shift
with the passage of time, now that
Clinton is out of danger of removal.
As Rakove anticipates, "The real
secret is figuring out what has been
driving this whole machine. So the
judgment of history will not be deter
mined by this verdict, but by the con
tinual question."
