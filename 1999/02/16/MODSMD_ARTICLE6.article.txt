# Acquittal no surprise at Stanford
##

Stanford students had a break from classes Monday on
account of President's Day, hut this year. President's Day
took on a whole new meaning.
The Senate on Friday rejected the two articles of im
peachment brought against President Clinton, voting to
acquit him on the charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice. After a year of scandal and investigation, the five
week-long Senate trial of the president came to an end:
and as the Senate closed its deliberations, Stanford stu
dents and historians were handed a new set of questions to
ponder on their extra day off.
Many pundits had anticipated such a verdict from the
Senate. " This was the expected outcome. There really was
no surprise," History Prof. Douglas Rivers said. "Really
the Republicans could have pushed for a strong censure
resolution, but at the end of the day, they just didn't have
enough support for impeachment."
In response to his acquittal Clinton addressed the na
tion and said, "how profoundly sorry 1 am for what I said
and did to trigger these events and the great burden they
have imposed on the Congress and the American people."
The President went on to add that, " This can be and this
must be a time of reconciliation and renewal for Ameri
ca."
It appears many Stanford students are simply happy
