# Pests threaten eucalyptus trees
## 
### Tai-Li Chang 
While eucalyptus
have plagued campus trees for the
past 10 years, the problem liSkonly
recently caught public attention.
Both longhorned borers |and
red gum psvllids are found indigq~
nously in eucalyptus trees.
Borer larvae burrow into the
tree, damaging the cam,biura, Uie
active growing tissue layer of the
tree.
Psyllids ate sucking insfccts<jthat
deplete the leaves' nutrients. caus-J
ing them to wither.
According to Herb Fong, the
I diversity Facilities Grounds
Manager, "This is definitely a
very significant problem that W
have been constantly
ing." v *
Stanford has not been willing to
use chemical |&stiddes to control
the pests dde to the significant air
pollution that would result from
constant application.
Injection of pesticides into the

ground has also been frowned
upqn due to the possibility of
ground water contamination.
predators are the best
option and remedy for problems
of this nature." Fong said
Findingffredators for the euca
lyptus parasites is not easy, since
the trees ajt not indigenous to
California.

However, eucalyptus parasites
are equally tenacious.
Adult longhorned beetles are
known as cylindrical beetles be
cause of their distinctive, 11-seg
mented antenna, often longer than
the beetle's body.
They feed under the bark and in
the sapwood and bore long holes as
they feed, weakening and destroy
ing the wood.
The other eucalyptus parasite is
the red gum psvllid (Eucalyptus
blakelyi).
For many years. Stanford's eu
calyptus trees have been heavily in
fested by the red gum psyllid,
which causes necrosis and prema
ture leaf fall.
Since the discovery of these par

asites on the trees, the grounds di
vision of facilities has taken pre
cautionary measures. According to
Fong, Stanford uses monrtoring
stations to collect information con
cerning the status of the eucalyptus
trees.
The University of California has
employed two entomologists to
find natural predators of the long
horned borer and red-gum lerp
psyllid.
One of the entomologists is at
tempting to find natural predators
selective only for these two para
sites in Australia.
So far. the eucalyptus parasite
problem has been relatively inex
pensive. However, if the trees die
before a sufficient remedy or nat
ural predators are found, removing
the trees could cost tens of thou
sands of dollars.
