# SHPRC class resurrected
## 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
After losing its affiliation with
the Psychology Department last fall,
the training program for Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center coun
selors has joined the School of Edu
cation and is now focusing more di
rectly on counseling skills.
The new class, first taught this
quarter, is now much smaller and
more discussion-based. Sophomore
Casey Ward, the head teaching as
sistant, said, "Instead of just being
lectured at on new topics, students

do readings before class, and we dis
cuss issues pertinent to counselors.
"All of the students plan to coun
sel next quarter and so the class is
more intense and SHPRC-focused
than classes for a general audience."
In the past the class had been a
larger seminar, not limited to people
who intended to become counselors
at the SHPRC, Ward explained.
Now the class is a two-hour-per
week extension of the peer counsel
ing class offered for counselors at
The Bridge.
