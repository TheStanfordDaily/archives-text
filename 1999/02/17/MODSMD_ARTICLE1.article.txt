# SHPRC class resurrected
## 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
After losing its affiliation with
the Psychology Department last fall,
the training program for Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center coun
selors has joined the School of Edu
cation and is now focusing more di
rectly on counseling skills.
The new class, first taught this
quarter, is now much smaller and
more discussion-based. Sophomore
Casey Ward, the head teaching as
sistant, said, "Instead of just being
lectured at on new topics, students

do readings before class, and we dis
cuss issues pertinent to counselors.
"All of the students plan to coun
sel next quarter and so the class is
more intense and SHPRC-focused
than classes for a general audience."
In the past the class had been a
larger seminar, not limited to people
who intended to become counselors
at the SHPRC, Ward explained.
Now the class is a two-hour-per
week extension of the peer counsel
ing class offered for counselors at
The Bridge.

center.
The changes to the class are still
experimental. Whether the new for
mat will undergo further changes has
yet to be determined.
But for now, students in the class
get "streamlined... information rele
vant to being a sexual health peer ed
ucator. More time is spent on issues of
contraception and STDs," said

sophomore Jill Di Giovanni, another
teaching assistant.
The new format of the class is de
signed to prepare students to become
SHPRC counselors, so it "serves an
orientation purpose along with its in
formational r01e... [by] focusing on
the problems counselors are most
often faced with," Ward said.
Class members are also encour
aged to participate in SHPRC events
such as handing out condoms at Full
Moon on the Quad and on World

AIDS Day.
But Kate Larson, a sophomore
and class member, stressed that "it's
not just an anatomy class, and we
don't just play with condoms — we
also talk about the emotional side of
sex and contraception."
For participating in the extra sec
tion, students receive one unit
through the School of Education.
Lecturers receive two units of credit.
Ward describes the atmosphere as
"relaxed and fun."

"We joke around a lot and get to
know each other," she said.
The students enjoy the small class
size because it "allows for a lot of dis
cussion on the issues presented...
which is great preparation for coun
seling. From this we learn the impor
tance of understanding that there are
a lot of different perspectives arid val
ues where sex is concerned, and, as
counselors, we need to be respectful
of everyone's choices," Larson said.
Although the format of the class

has changed, the information con
veyed is no less substantive. "While
people may not get the same breadth
of knowledge, they get more depth,"
Di Giovanni said.
She also stressed the importance
of the nature of the information being
taught.
"If one is at all sexually active or
considering becoming sexually ac
tive, this class is beneficial. It teaches
people knowledge that is applicable
now and for the rest of their lives."
