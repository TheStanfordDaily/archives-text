# AT&T deal nears approval

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
AT&T Corp. s proposed takeover
of cable giant Tele-Communications
Inc., which could dramatically
change the markets for local phone
and Internet service, is nearing final
approval by federal regulators.
The Federal Communications
Commission is expected this week to
clear the deal, which was valued at
nearly $32 billion when it was
announced in June, said government
and industry officials speaking on
condition of anonymity.
For consumers, the merger holds
the promise of providing a new
choice for local phone service — a
prospect appealing to regulators

wanting to crack open local phone
monopolies to competition. The
merger could eventually give resi
dential and business customers one
stop shopping for local, long-dis
tance and Internet services.
The FCC, however, is not expect
ed to force AT&T and TCI to pro
vide other companies with access to
TCl's high-speed cable TV lines.
Consumer groups, America Online
and others had been pressing for the
agency to require AT&T to give
other companies access to those
lines to offer competing services.
AT&T is the nation's largest
telecommunications company and
biggest provider of mobile phone

services. TCI is the nation's second
largest cable TV company, with lines
reaching one-third of all U.S. homes.
Many of those TCI lines have
been upgraded to permit cable TV
customers to connect their comput
ers to the Internet and access online
data at speeds as much as 100 times
faster than conventional telephone
lines.
Eventually, AT&T intends to
make TCl's lines capable of provid
ing customers with local phone ser
vice, too. AT&T has a separate
agreement with cable company
Time Warner to provide local phone
service over its high-speed cable TV
lines.
