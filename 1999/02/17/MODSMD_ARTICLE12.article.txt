Financial aid should
be increased in
relation to tuition

WHEN THE UNIVERSITY
Board of Trustees decided
on the amount that tuition
and financial aid would he increased
for the coming academic year, they
kept roughly in line with inflation.
Tuition was raised by 4.3 percent, and
room and board, which varies across
campus, was raised by 1.4 percent.
However, not greatly increasing
the impact of financial aid is counter
productive at a campus that ostensi
bly wants to retain students from
diverse economic backgrounds. Eco
nomic diversity brings with it the
multiplicity of perspective that the
University insists upon.
The jump in tuition is certainly
moderate, but only $500.000 was
allotted for a corresponding increase
in financial aid. This leaves Stanford
students, a majority of whom receive
some form of aid, with an additional
burden.
While we applaud the Board of
Trustees' efforts to contain tuition
inflation to a relatively moderate
pace, it is clear that maintaining the
status quo will not effect any progress
toward maintaining economic diver
sity in the student body.
I his status quo does have its posi
tive consequences. The additional
funding for the Presidential Scholars
program is commendable.
In addition, we applaud the Uni
versity's efforts to pursue outside
sources of funding for initiatives like
the Freshman / Sophomore College
that will occupy Sterling Quad next
year.
Outside funding, which has been
abundant of late, is an excellent way
for the I Iniversity to commence inno
vative projects without overburden

ing students in the form of unduly
excessive tuition increases.
At a campus where economic priv
ilege is abundant enough that almost
40 percent of students are able to foot
a bill of more than $3(),()()() each year
without University aid, more eco
nomic diversity is both an attainable
and a desirable goal.
In addition, it would help to molli
fy Stanford's less than desirable elitist
image, which was recently highlight
ed on national television in connec
tion with taunting of Khalid El-Amin
at the men's basketball game versus
Connecticut on Feb. 6.
Keeping more Stanford students
from differing economic back
grounds is also desirable for expand
ing the scope of the subjects that
undergraduates choose to study.
These students could bring their
experiences to bear in programs that
expand the scope of academic
research done at Stanford.
A more significant financial aid
program would do more than help
current students who have difficulty
paying their University bills.
It would also allow Dean of
Admission and Financial Aid Robert
Kinnally to attract a larger number of
qualified candidates from more
diversified socioeconomic back
grounds.
Hie loss of brilliant prospective
Stanford students from less privi
leged backgrounds to other, more
affordable universities is not a part of
the University's status quo that
should be maintained.
While Stanford is a diverse campus
by most standards, the economic
backgrounds of its students tend to
vary less than other demographic
characteristics.
If the University truly seeks to be
successful in retaining economic
diversity on this campus, increasing
the amount of financial aid money
available is a necessary measure.
