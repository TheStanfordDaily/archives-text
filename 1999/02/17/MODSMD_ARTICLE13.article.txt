Sixth Man mission too vague
In response to the eontroversv regarding
the signs ridiculing Khalid El-Amin at the
men's haskethall game versus Connecticut
on Feb. ft, the Sixth Man Club Steering
(ommittee decided to send a letter of apol
ogy to El-Amin and included a copy of the
club's mission statement. Men's Basketball
Director of Operations Jamie Zaninovich
also sent a copy of this statement to the
Sixth Man members through email. The
statement read:
"The Sixth Man Club was founded and
exists as the official student booster club of
the Stanford Men's Basketball Team. We
aim to enhance pride in the Stanford com
munity and reflect the values of the Univer
sity by creating an exciting and fun atmo
sphere for the benefit of the team and their
fans.
"Our home court advantage is based on
the fundamental tenets of dedication and
good sportsmanship without detracting
from the performance and integrity of the
opposing team. With the philosophy of
Stanford Athletics in mind, let us aim high
and strive toward continued excellence."
I think that many Sixth Man Club mem
bers will agree with me that this mission

statement is much too vague to be taken
seriously.
By saying, for example, that we are not
to "detract from the performance" from the
other team, we are promising not to do any
cheers that ridicule or attempt to interfere
with their play on the court.
T his would also include common accept
able cheers like "air-ball" or "ball hog." It
also precludes distractions like yelling and
jumping around during our opponents' free
throws. If we really were to promise not to
try and detract from the performance of the
other team, then we would have to be very
quiet during their free throws so they could
concentrate.
If we are going to have a mission state
ment that people really take seriously then
it will have to be more specific. For exam
ple. I think the mission statement should
specifically preclude cheers or signs about a
player's family, ethnic background or any
thing that just says that they "suck." If peo
ple would just avoid these off-limits topics, I
think the Sixth Man Club's members can
maintain their reputations as dedicated, cre
ative fans with class.

Another view on El-Amin
I am not about to start taking sides in the
whole Khalid El-Amin taunting incident at
the men's basketball game versus Connecti
cut on Feb. 6. But I'd like to bring up some
points that those so quick to persecute the
Sixth Man Club have, in my opinion,
ignored.
1 think that we can all agree that father
ing children out of wedlock and then
neglecting them both monetarily and emo
tionally is a serious problem affecting
American society and that "deadbeat dads"
are worthy of societal scorn.
That's where "society" (of which the
Sixth Man Club is a part, albeit a tactless
one) comes in. If local authorities aren't
willing to address the issue, single mothers
are unable to organize themselves en masse
and the federal government pleads that
such a problem is out of their jurisdiction,
then someone has to say something about it
and try to make it right. Those kids can't
talk and for the most part they don't know
what they're missing.
Now I'll allow that the middle of a bas
ketball game is not the appropriate forum
to bring up such issues, and that the Sixth
Man probably was not trying to raise social

awareness but rather cause El-Amin to be
distracted and miss some shots. But if he
had been neglecting his son and was so hurt
by the taunts that he went and visited his kid
the next time he went home, well then I
think it would have to be chalked up as a
victory.
If the taunts were truly slanderous but he
had been a dutiful, loving father to his child,
well then he would have had every right to
be upset. At the same time, there are other
basketball players and hundreds of thou
sands of individuals who have children out
of wedlock they are neglecting who need to
be woken up.
Of course, chanting "You're a great
father" wouldn't have had the same ring
and wouldn't bring attention to El-Amin
nearly as much as making false accusations.
I think that it's about time that deadbeat
dads are held accountable for the hardship
and duress they put their children and the
children's mothers through, and if this inci
dent can start the ball rolling in that direc
tion, then however offended Khalid El-
Amin might have been, it would have been
well worth it.
