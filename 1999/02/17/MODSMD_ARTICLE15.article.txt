# Breathing Lessons

IF YOU WANT to get
closer to someone,
you're going to have to
sleep with him or her.
You're going to have to lie
down and unbutton your
jeans and your defenses
and slip with someone into

those eight hours of lost consciousness where
there is no shyness and no pretension.
You've got to get some serious shut-eye,
take a detour to the Land of Nod.
That's right, if you want to get to know
someone, you're going to have to go all the
way ... to REM.
It seems like a perfect solution. After all.
people gel closer by sharing experiences and
by revealing their private selves. You and
your bed partner, tangled in sheets and crust
ed with ocular residue, are the epitome of the
honest-to-goodness, stripped-down, tandem
vulnerability that brings people together.
The light wanes, sleep comes and in that
space between being awake and being dead,
you are just you.
Gone are the conscious daytime
resources we use to construct that best ver
sion of ourselves. Present, human imperfec
tion. Snoring, drooling, bad breath. An occa
sional smile. It's truth and wholeness for the
two of you, and the two of you together. Peo
ple can only sleep honestly.
You're not buying it yet. You're thinking
not much can be gleaned from two smelly,
slack-jawed bags of flesh playing comatose in
the same square footage. Then first picture
one of the two awake. My mama always told

me that if you really want to witness some
one's character, you ought to get them
drunk. Co-sleeping is simply a cheaper ver
sion of Veritas than vino. If you get down, get
funky and get supine, your companion will
soon drift off and you'll have a brief tour of
the life of the mind.
Take for instance my cousin Anne, best
described in waking hours as the "Human
Doormat." The holidays we slept together in
Grandma's guest room earned her the titles
of "kicky" and "screamer" for her lights-out
behavior; she struggled at night against the
people she wouldn't confront during the day.
Then there was Melissa, my best friend in
seventh grade. She slept spread-eagle across
a full-size bed while I crouched in the top
right-hand corner. A few weeks later, she
stole my favorite sweater and laughed when
a seagull pooped on my head. See the con
nection?
Even if you can't draw detailed correla
tions between sleeping habits and personali
ty types, there is a great deal to be learned
from waking up together. After hours of
withdrawal from the harried world, there is
some satisfaction in having mutually experi
enced that calm.
There are also, often the first time, sheep
ish smiles and heads quickly buried in pil
lows. It's only to be expected. You each have
a private place that you go to when your eyes
close, and last night you went there together.
Embarrassment can be interpreted as the
acknowledgment of a new intimacy: "You
saw me at my rawest, didn't you?"
Challenge brings people together, too, so

the bonding effect is amplified if you're shar
ing the adventure of clinging to one twin-size
bed. It's the buddy system at its finest. You
start to fall off, he catches you... indirectly..
. in the tangle of sheets that originate from a
bundle under his knee. He has no place to
put his elbow, and you accommodate by con
torting into the space-conserving fetal posi
tion. You kick him, he doesn't move. He
can't, or he'll plummet eight feet to the floor
from your lofted bed.
But close proximity isn't all sacrifice. The
first cough or wave of laughter that resonates
through your back from your cozy bedfellow
will remind you what the sleep is all about.
Feeling your friend breathing next to you in
the same slow rhythm. Existing together
honestly, without reservation. Being close in
the body to be close in the mind.
So take a big breath and a warm glass of
milk and give it a shot. I'm telling you, there's
no better remedy for tension and no better
adhesive for a tighter bond. Awkward first
date? Big fight? Hope for deeper chats? Just
plain hard to get to know each other? Then
bed down, cuddle up, strip to your skivvies or
yank on your sweats and engage in some
earnest co-snoozing. That bed is an exercise
in intimacy waiting to happen. And this time
you'll even respect each other when the
morning comes.
