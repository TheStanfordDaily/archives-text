Dining Services responds to criticism

Last week. I he Daily ran several articles
about changes taking place in University
Dining Services. I he comments and con
cerns noted in the articles among students at
Munzanita Park reflect considerable
thoughtfulness about what is currently hap
pening. However, the articles also reflect
some misconceptions, which are important
to clarify.
One misconception is that these changes
were related directly to the late opening of
the Lagunita Roble kitchen and dining
halls. \\ hile that delay did present some dif
ficult issues, it was not the reason for the
implementation of schedule changes for
Dining Services workers. Another miscon
ception is that the changes were localized to
Man/anita Park employees. On the con
trary. these changes in schedules, by neces
sity. affect all Dining Services workers.
On Feb. V.the Hoard of Trustees
approved room and board rates for next
year. Included was the approval of a "zero"
increase in the cost ol meal plans. As a
result of the work ol I hiiversits Dining Ser
vices staff the Value Enhancement Pro

gram played a major role in making that
possible. The program is a broadly based,
multi-year effort on the part of University
Dining Services to reduce the cost of meal
plans and at the same time dramatically
improve dining services offered to students.
Fundamental to the program are
changes to the core menu and the addition
of "just in time" preparation and serving in
all units. These improvements, coupled with
better management of food waste, will help
keep our cost of food lower. Another criti
cal area of expense is labor. Changes in the
menu and the move to the "just in time"
mode of food preparation and serving
require that members of the Dining Ser
vices staff be reassigned to maximize the
effectiveness of the program throughout the
entire system.
I he primary objective of Dining Services
in this effort has been to ensure optimal din
ing services staffing in each residence
according to the hours of operation and
times of greatest use by students. Employee
work schedules must match both ol these.
In order to accomplish both of these objec

tives. work schedules for some employees
needed to be changed.
Deciding how to change the schedules
was a thoughtful and cooperative process
involving Dining Services management
human resources and shop stewards (union
employees entrusted to act on behall ol
their co-workers in policy-making deci
sions) from the various residence halls
including the shop steward from Man/anita
Park. Beginning last August. Dining Sci
vices held a series of special conferences
with the union on this subject. We began
with the objectives, but had no preference
regarding how schedules would actually be
changed. We were committed, however, to
implementing any change in a manner that
would not adversely affect the delivers ol
services to students.
With that in mind. Dining Services man
agement presented the union and stewards
last December with two options. First, on
the basis of seniority, employees could
select their own schedule choices from the
time slots available. Or. second, manage
ment would assign employees lo schedules

as has been the practice in the past.
While the union and employee represen
tatives at this meeting may have preferred
more time to consider alternatives, when
given a limited opportunity to do so they
elected not to take the issue back to the
workers. They selected the option that
allows employees to choose their own
schedules on the basis of seniority. The pro
cess they chose is fair and democratic.
We strongly believe that this is a fair
approach, but we also recognize that some
employees will not gel their first choices for
scheduling.
Overall, employee response has been
positive. Some long-time Dining Services
employees in other parts of the campus
have especially welcomed the opportunity
to choose their schedules for the first time in
as many as 35 years of service.
Despite this, and with no further com
munication to us. it now appears that the
I Inion wants to undermine many months of
collective effort.
We understand that changes of this kind
ultimately affect illeli\ iduals and that change

itself can be unwelcome for any numbei of
reasons.
However, to sustain Dining Services as a
Univeisity managed service, we must
ensure that our operation is meeting stu
dents' needs in a valuable, cost-elfeetive
manner and be willing to make changes nec
essary to achieve that goal.
A small group of students met with Din
ing Services Managers to talk further about
these issues. It was our impression that they
better understood the reorganization pro
cess after hearing both sides. Our hope in
writing this letter is to have the same oppor
tunity to communicate with others who are
also concerned.
