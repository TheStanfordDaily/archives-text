## Disease escapes detection worldwide Study finds standard test for tuberculosis unreliable 
### Joanne Wu Editorial staff 
Despite extensive research and
vaccination advancements, tuber
culosis remains a serious disease,
causing about three million deaths
each year, mostly in developing
countries.
New studies by Stanford scien
tists have revealed inadequacies
and a wide range of error in the
standard tuberculosis test.
"Only half of TB patients are
detected by this test," said former
postdoctoral fellow Marcel Behr,
lead author of the study, which
was started while he was at Stan
ford.
"Yet the other half are still
infectious and continue to propa
gate this epidemic," he said.
The standard test used world
wide for diagnosing the presence
and severity of tuberculosis in
patients consists of the acid-fast
bacilli smear.
This involves examining spu
tum — better known as phlegm —
samples under a light microscope
to determine whether there are
tuberculosis bacteria present.
Since this method is inexpen
sive, simple and efficient, it is the
most common test employed by
TB control programs.
Patients who test positive are
immediately placed in isolation to
avoid transmission of the airborne
disease, which can be passed by
the tuberculosis bacteria released
in coughs.
Patients who test negative are
assumed to be free of infection
and no precautions are taken to
isolate or treat them.
The theoretical and experimen
tal results of Stanford researchers,
however, have cast doubt on the
ability of this workhorse test to
detect infectious patients, said
Peter Small, assistant professor of
medicine and senior author of the
study.
A mere five TB bacteria in the
lungs are sufficient to cause a new
infection.
But in order to reach the mini
mum threshold for the standard
test to detect TB in a patient, 5,000

to 10,000 bacteria per milliliter
must be present in the phlegm
sample.
Moreover, the rate of TB infec
tion in people who are exposed to
patients who tested negative is
unusually high.
This points to the likelihood
that the standard test failed to
show the patients actually har
bored the TB infection.
If the study's results are con
firmed worldwide, it could carry
serious implications for tuberculo
sis control in developing countries.

are detected by this test,
yet the other half are still
infectious and continue to
propagate this epidemic'

These nations have limited
money and a shortage of facilities,
which may not allow an alternative
to the smear test.
Unlike the United States, many
countries cannot afford to run
more sensitive tests for every
patient with a suspicious cough.
In order to verify the inaccura
cy of the smear tests. Small, Behr
and their colleagues worked in col
laboration with UC-San Francisco
and the San Francisco Department
of Health to analyze a database of
smear test and DNA fingerprint
ing records of TB patients in San
Francisco since 1991.
DNA fingerprinting, which
identifies characteristic patterns in
DNA samples, can be used to
trace the transmission of tubercu
losis among people in a communi
ty-
Patients with bacteria that
share identical DNA fingerprints
most likely received their infection
from the same source.
Organizing 1,359 TB patients
into clusters according to their
bacterial DNA fingerprint,
researchers were able to identify
the source patient in each group.
Of the 71 disease clusters, near
ly 40 percent were originally trans

milted by a source patient who
had tested negative in the smear
test.
Furthermore, researchers
found that at least 17 percent of
the individual patients had
received the infection from some
one with a negative smear test.
Since the smear test does iden
tify the most infectious individu
als, it remains useful. Small
affirmed.
Smear-positive patients are
approximately four times more
infectious than smear-negative
patients.
By clarifying the limitations of
the test, Small said, the findings
question TB control procedures in
both developed and developing
countries.
In industrialized nations such as
the United States, the smear test is
used to identify patients who need
the most immediate care and
intervention, since it is logically
assumed that they transmit the
majority of new cases.
Even in San Francisco, where
health officials make an attempt to
locate and treat smear-negative
patients, it appears that a signifi
cant source of infection has been
overlooked. Small said.
The DNA fingerprinting
method allowed the researchers to
conclude that patients classified as
non-infectious by the smear test
actually gave rise to one-sixth of
new cases of tuberculosis.
"A significant number of infec
tions are caused by persons with
negative smears but positive cul
tures of septum, indicating that
this group should be regarded as
an important, albeit secondary,
priority in tuberculosis control
programs in developing coun
tries," said Prof. Philip Hopewell,
associate dean at UC-San Francis
co School of Medicine and a mem
ber of the research team.
Small and Behr both empha
sized the need for a more accurate,
yet still affordable and efficient,
test to replace the old smear test.
Behr noted, "For any other dis
ease, we wouldn't tolerate a diag
nostic test that only picks up half
of the cases."
