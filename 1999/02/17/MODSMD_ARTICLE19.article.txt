# Interdisciplinary method enriches research realms
## Zare explains benefits of collaboration when dealing with problems in science

A greater emphasis on inter
disciplinary research is needed if
science and technology are to con
tribute to solving the increasingly
complex problems that face soci
ety.
That is the take-home message
from a critique of U.S. science
policy co-authored by Prof.
Richard N. Zare of the Chemistry
Department and Norman Met
zger, executive director of the
National Research Council Com
mission on Physical Sciences,
Mathematics and Applications.
Zare and Metzger outline
some of the historical, structural
and cultural hindrances to inter
disciplinary research in an article
in the Jan. 29 issue of Science.
Metzger and Zare posit that
federal science policy has histori
cally been motivated by three
forces — war, crisis and need.
For example, World War II
fueled research in fields as diverse
as synthetic materials, medicine
and atomic energy.
Advances in these and other
realms resulted in public interest
in federally funded research and
led to the postwar creation of the
National Science Foundation, the
National Institutes of Health and
other institutions.
Other public research institu
tions have been created to address
a crisis. For example, the Environ
mental Protection Agency was
created in the early 1970's in
response to growing concern over
environmental problems.
Because U.S. science policy
has been formed in reaction to
these forces, it has not been
planned from the ground up.
Instead of being organized like
a blueprint for a house, with all of
the parts designed to fit into a
well-conceived whole, it has
evolved more like a burgeoning
city, with bits and pieces added on
as the need or inspiration arose.
As a result, Zare and Metzger

write, the current system is "con
fusing, complex, lacking coher
ence and somewhat unwieldy."
They hasten to add, though,
that the U.S. scientific enterprise
has, despite its complexity, been
"spectacularly successful."
The two authors attribute this
success in large part to the symbi
otic relationship between
research universities and the fed
eral agencies that support
research.
Nonetheless, Zare and Met
zger argue, the scientific enter
prise (and therefore the public's
investment in the scientific enter
prise) would be better served if
the current system encouraged
more interdisciplinary research.
Zare and Metzger cite the
environment as one important
area that is poorly addressed
under the current structure.
Using the depletion of oceanic
fishing stocks as an illustrative
example, they wrote: "Under
standing the reasons, aside from
the simplistic one of overfishing,
means synergistically blending the
perspectives of many sciences —
genetics, oceanography, popula
tion dynamics, marine ecology
and so forth."
One of the principal obstacles
to interdisciplinary research, Zare
and Metzger argue, is the current
peer-review system for allocating
research grant money.
Grant applications for federal
research money are reviewed and
evaluated by other scientists with
in the applicant's field of study.
Because of this, most proposed
projects tend to be highly special
ized and restricted to one disci
pline.
Scientific journals and profes
sional societies also tend to be
heavily weighted towards one dis
cipline.
Because grant money and pub
lication records are the bread and
butter of research scientists,
proposing interdisciplinary
research projects can be very
risky.

Younger researchers are espe
cially vulnerable to this.
"Researchers, especially
untenured ones, proposing
research programs that move
across disciplinary fences have,
and do, put their careers at risk,"
Zare and Metzger pointed out.
Zare and Metzger propose the
creation of a federally funded pro
gram to encourage interdisci
plinary research.
This program would be admin
istered by several disciplinary
committees within a government
agency or even by several agen
cies.
Decisions on funding would be
made by a panel of researchers
representing a variety of disci
plines.
The program would offer
grants for work on a variety of
previously agreed-upon themes,
such as environmental sciences,
integration of social and behav
ioral sciences with biological
research and the role of cognitive
sciences in shaping future science
and technology research.
Others topics would include
attacking resource allocation
issues, applying contemporary
mathematics to complexity issues
in many fields and combining sub
specialties within the biological
sciences.
Under Zare and Metzger's
proposed program, 10 new inter
disciplinary research projects
would be funded each year.
Each research team would be
given an average of $1.5 million
per year for 5 years. Once fully
operational, .the program would
run at an annual cost of $75 mil
lion.
Zare and Metzger believe that
"this relatively modest investment
would reap substantial returns in
enriching and enlarging the
national research enterprise, in
directly addressing several nation
al goals and in creating substantial
and healthy changes in the funda
mental nature of the research
enterprise."
