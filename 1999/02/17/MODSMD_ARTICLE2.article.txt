# Project to oust EPA non-profits
## 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
The University Circle project, a develop
ment planned for University Avenue in East
Palo Alto that secured final approval last
week, appears to promise new business and
economic growth for the area.
However, solutions often create prob
lems of their own. Among the small busi
nesses and residents that will be forced to re
locate are several community organizations
serving East Palo Alto.
Two of the organizations which will need
to relocate are Plugged In: Learning
Through Technology and Free At Last
Community Recovery and Rehabilitation
Center, both begun by Stanford graduates
and helped occasionally by Stanford volun
teers.
Bart Decrem, Law School Class of '92,
who leads Plugged In, is worried about the
relocation.
According to Decrem, location is an im
portant element in the success of Plugged In
and other nearby organizations, which are

only effective if easily accessible.
"The drop-in technology center needs to
be downtown so people can come across us
easily. For the children's program, a lot of
kids walk over after school. In a new loca
tion, we'll lose some of those kids," Decrem
explained.
The move also costs money that the ser
vice organizations would otherwise commit
to community outreach. Although the devel
opment company would cover the cost of
moving to a rented location, the shortage of
rental space in East Palo Alto may make it
necessary to buy property, a cost not covered
by the developers.
Founder of Free At Last, Priya Haji, a
member of the Class of '93, hopes for city
support during the organization's relocation.
"The city government has been instru
mental The city has made a commitment
to helping non-profits find adequate and ac
ceptable space, and I hope the city will keep
that commitment," Haji said.
Although Decrem acknowledged that
the move "is not trivial," he supports the re
development. "It's a survival issue. This city

has a lot more social needs, but it hasn't had
a tax base for 10 years," Decrem explained.
"Redevelopment is a financial necessity in
order to have a viable community."
Haji, however, does not see the redevel
opment as a panacea. With the recent re
moval of rent control in East Palo Alto,
rental costs are rising, for all residents, in
cluding Stanford students.
"This affects a lot of the students who can
afford to live here right now," Haji said.
To both Haji and Decrem, the most im
portant questions are those that affect the
whole community. To Haji, the rising prices
threaten the very spirit of East Palo Alto.
"The question is 'How do we prevent
large-scale gentrification of East Palo Alto?'
We need to create both an economically vi
able community and a neighborhood for
people of color," Haji said.
In the end, Decrem approaches the move
with a bittersweet attitude. "On one hand, I
think there is a pretty broad consensus that
redevelopment is important. But there
needs to be a concern for what will be the
heart and soul of East Palo Alto."
