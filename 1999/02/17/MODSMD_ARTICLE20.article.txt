# Science bug explores effects of marijuana on apathy
## Link between marijuana use and lack of motivation remains uncertain

Q: Does marijuana use really cause apa
thy?
A: Huh?
Were you talking to me?
Oh ... uh ... OK.
Weed, pot, reefer, grass, dope, ganja.
Mary Jane, herb, skunk, boom and chron
ic are all nicknames you might use in refer
ring to the subject of today's column. After
the criminalization of cannabis in the
1930'5, there has been a constant flow of
research on the effects that marijuana,
specifically the active ingredient, delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has on the
human brain. However, this research has
been problematic because of its coinci
dence with an emotionally charged debate
on the subject.
Most of my research time was spent try
ing to figure out what information was
based in experiment and what was just
government propaganda and unfounded
conjecture. It is pretty disheartening how
little useful and scientifically based infor
mation organizations like Partnership for a
Drug-Free America actually provide.
However, I cannot say 1 was surprised
to find most of the references to experi
mental and scientifically rigorous data
were made in essays and writing by orga
nizations that support the legalization of
cannabis use.
Amotivational syndrome has been
hypothesized as a long-term effect of mar
ijuana use â€” that is, it is supposed to be an
effect which occurrs among people who
smoke pot not only when they are stoned,

but all the time.
W.H. McGlothin and L.J. West in the
American Journal of Psychiatry defined
amotivational syndrome as "apathy, loss
of effectiveness and diminished capacity
or willingness to carry out complex, long
term plans, endure frustration, concen
trate for long periods, follow routines or
successfully master new material. Verbal
facility is often impaired both in speaking
and writing. Some individuals exhibit
greater introversion, become totally
involved with the present at the expense
of future goals and demonstrate a strong
tendency toward regressive, childlike,
magical thinking." (Not bad; where do I
sign up?)
It is difficult to deny that many college
students have changed from assertive,
clean, ambitious achievers into the sort of
person just described at about the same
time that they started smoking marijuana.
What is not clear, however, is a causal
relationship between the loss of high aspi
rations and motivations and the use of
marijuana. It becomes the classic debate
over the chicken and the egg: Which
comes first, the grass or the loss of moti
vation?
Behavioral studies suggest that fre
quent users of marijuana are more impul
sive and rebellious than non-users. In a
recent survey conducted by the Center for
Humanities and Human Sciences at
Southern Cross University in Australia, a
section of 2,(KK) college undergraduates
was studied. There was no difference in
grade-point average and achievement
between marijuana users and non-users,
but the users had more difficulty deciding
on future career plans, and a smaller num

her were seeking advanced professional
degrees.
On the other hand, other studies have
shown lower GPAs and higher dropout
rates among users than non-users. Howev
er, the data used in these studies seems to
ignore personality types and differences
that existed before subjects began using
cannabis.
When cannabis is smoked or ingested,
THC rapidly disappears from the blood
and is taken up by fat where it remains
with a half-life of about 4-5 days. This
means that following a single smoke-out,
less than 2 percent of the active ingredient
remains in the fatty tissue after a month.
There is little doubt that there are some
direct effects of THC on the nervous sys
tem during the period of acute intoxica
tion.
The psychological changes that occur
immediately following use seem to be
agreed upon by users and observers. Long
term effects of cannabis use that have been
characterized as amotivational syndrome
appear to be much less of a "syndrome,"
but rather just original behavior or the
result of chronic intoxication.
So, to return to the root of your ques
tion, the extent to which long-term apathy
will persist is related to the amount and
frequency of marijuana use rather than
some "syndrome" that cannabis users are
cursed with from their first hit from the
bong. Recovery from the pharmacological
effects of THC exposure is time-based and
will not persist longer than a month past
the most recent use. But if marijuana use
continues on a "bake when you wake"
schedule, the effects will continue as long
as there's money in the pot.
