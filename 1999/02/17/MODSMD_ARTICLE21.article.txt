## Stanford's fans inferior to Duke's Crazies outshine Sixth Man 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Stanford is the "Home of Cham
pions" — the ultimate combination
of academics and athletics.
Stanford students have proven
themselves to be the nation's finest,
both in the classroom and on the
field.
Around the fields — in the
stands — however, it is a complete
ly different story.

The relatively small student
body has been unable to support
big-time athletics with sufficient en
thusiasm.
But over the past few years, the
Sixth Man Club — the majority of
Stanford's student section at men's
basketball games — has emerged as
the single most reliable fan base,
and its loud, rowdy members have
been the antithesis of a typical Stan
ford crowd.
The energy behind the Sixth
Man in anticipation of this season
was so high that students began
camping out at Maples Pavilion a
full two weeks prior to the season in
order to secure tickets.
Combined with the aforemen
tioned spirit of its students, the tent
village outside Maples sparked the
inevitable comparisons of the Sixth
Man with the Cameron Crazies —
the student section at Duke.
Yet this season has clearly illus
trated one simple fact — there is no
comparison to Duke. The Sixth
Man has proven itself inferior to the

Crazies, and has a lot to learn be
fore it can truly be christened one of
college basketball's elite groups of
student fans.
For the true Stanford fan, there
is perhaps nothing worse than being
compared to Duke basketball.
Much less proclaimed inferior.
But the bottom line is that at
Duke, they certainly do know how
to support a basketball team.
So the Sixth Man Club members
slept out once, four days prior to the
Connecticut game. The Crazies
sleep out for every game, not just
the big ones. And that's not to say
they don't turn it up for the big
showdowns. Fans begin camping
out up to two weeks before arch
rival North Carolina comes across
town.
Yet. it is inside Cameron Indoor
Stadium where the Crazies really
separate themselves from the Sixth
Man.
The students are jumping up and
down throughout the entire game.
They never stand still, they never
shut up. Relentless noise and pres
sure on the opponents.
How many times has there been
a camera shot of the Sixth Man.
only to reveal that a painful majori
ty of the students are quietly sitting
in the stands with a blank stare?
The Sixth Man Club has been
brilliant at times, shouting at the
top of its lungs and seriously dis
rupting the opposition.
But the problem is that it only
happens in the biggest moments,
against the biggest teams.
The Sixth Man has only been
completely full a couple of times

(UConn and UCLA) and it is
painfully obvious when it's not. Be
cause every member of the Club
wears the same t-shirt, on the all
too-often occasion that attendance
drops, any casual observer immedi
ately knows it from the spattering
of misplaced color in the bleachers.
And on those rare occasions
where it was completely full, the
students were not into the game
from the opening tip until the final
buzzer.
In fact, they seemed far more in
terested in dedicating their atten
tion and energy to inappropriate
and obnoxious cheers.
The often-discussed debacle at
the UConn game is the prime ex

ample of this immaturity. Fans
chanted "Deadbeat Dad," and
"Who's your baby?" to Khalid El-
Amin, who is a responsible father.
The leadership of the Sixth Man.
however, reacted swiftly and ap
propriately. writing a letter of apol
ogy to El-Amin.
The El-Amin incident raised a
lot of questions about the Sixth
Man, but even more about the over
all nature of "good cheering."
There is admittedly such a fine
line between what is accepted as a
hilarious and effective cheer and
one that is condemned as childish
and inappropriate.
The attacks on El-Amin clearly
fall into the latter category.

But how about last season when
the Sixth Man taunted UCLA for
ward Jelani McCoy, who had been
suspended for marijuana use, with
chants of "How high is Jelani?" and
waved a six-foot paper mache joint
courtside?
Different, certainly. Funnier,
perhaps.
Better? There is no clear-cut an
swer.
To be honest, individualized
cheers and "attacks" are an accept
ed part of college sports. Which
makes the issue that much tougher.
In its defense, the Sixth Man
Club has to make up for a whole lot
