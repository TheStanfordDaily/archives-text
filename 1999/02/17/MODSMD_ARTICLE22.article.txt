# Wrestlers prepare for Pac-10s
## 
### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
It was just one of those weekends. Your mind is somewhere else looking
ahead to something more important and the task at hand seems a minor in
convenience. For the Stanford wrestlers, the importance lies on Feb. 27-28 at
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships and the minor inconveniences
were No. 11 Cal State-Bakersfield and unranked ( al State-Fullerton.
The Cardinal (4-7) faced the 1 lth-ranked Roadrunners (14-5-1) Saturday,
outgunned and unable to match up against a team that features six ranked
wrestlers including a heavyweight with a 75-match winning streak. In the end.
Bakersfield proved too much for Stanford, handing the ( ardinal a 2K-6 loss.
"We just looked and felt a little flat during the road losses this weekend,"

said senior Shane Cross (174 pounds).
Stanford junior captain Zach Zimmerer (133) led the way for the Cardi
nal. looking to rebound from his first loss of 1999 and a recent eye injury. Zim
merer stepped up against Brad Hull and pulled out a 9-5 decision.

Team scoring did not resume until Cross defeated lan Nelms, 3-2.
One of the major blows for the C Cardinal out of the eight losses on the night
was at 157 pounds as 2()th-ranked se
nior captain Beau Weiner dropped a
9-5 decision to 19th-ranked Nathan
Vasquez. Weiner came into the
match riding a win streak that dates
back to Jan. 6, hut was not able to
stop Vasquez.
"When it comes down to it, the
dual meet season does not mean a
whole lot — the only focus is on the
Pac-lOs," Weiner said.
Junior Warren McPherson (165)
was not able to ride the momentum
of his second-place finish at the All-
California Invite, dropping a 3-1 de
cision to 1 lth-ranked Andy Varner.
Junior Tim Kendall (184), also
riding a second-place finish at the
All-California Invite, stepped onto
the mat with 9th-ranked Lionel
Halsey. Kendall had an inspirational
performance hut Halsey narrowly
escaped with a 4-2 win.

More disappointing for the Car
dinal was the 22-18 loss to Cal State
Fullerton (1-6-1) Sunday, which
gave the Titans their only dual win of
the year.
Freshman Andy Hunter (285)
provided a spark for the Cardinal,
bouncing back from a loss on Satur
day to pin Jonathan Dyßeyes in
2:40, coupled with a forfeit to Zim
merer to give the Cardinal 12 team
points.
Kendall was able to dominate
Ryan Gutzwiler 9-2 and Weiner was
able to finish the weekend on a high
note with a 8-1 victory over Ben
Nakamura to round out the scoring
for the Cardinal.
Fullerton's Jason Webster posted
the technical fall over Cross in 6:39
and All-American Joey Coughran
(141) major-decisioned freshman
Kenji Arai 14-5.
"These losses shows us how we
can improve before Pac-lOs, and by
then we will definitely be ready,"
Cross said.
