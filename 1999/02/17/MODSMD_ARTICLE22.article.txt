### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
It was just one of those weekends. Your mind is somewhere else looking
ahead to something more important and the task at hand seems a minor in
convenience. For the Stanford wrestlers, the importance lies on Feb. 27-28 at
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships and the minor inconveniences
were No. 11 Cal State-Bakersfield and unranked ( al State-Fullerton.
The Cardinal (4-7) faced the 1 lth-ranked Roadrunners (14-5-1) Saturday,
outgunned and unable to match up against a team that features six ranked
wrestlers including a heavyweight with a 75-match winning streak. In the end.
Bakersfield proved too much for Stanford, handing the ( ardinal a 2K-6 loss.
"We just looked and felt a little flat during the road losses this weekend,"

said senior Shane Cross (174 pounds).
Stanford junior captain Zach Zimmerer (133) led the way for the Cardi
nal. looking to rebound from his first loss of 1999 and a recent eye injury. Zim
merer stepped up against Brad Hull and pulled out a 9-5 decision.
