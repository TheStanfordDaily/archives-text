WOMEN'S WATER POLO

■ Today: No. 1 Stanford (5-1,1-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) vs. No. 5 Hawaii (6-3,0-0), 4
p.m.,deGuerre Pool.

For both teams it will be a re
match of the final game last sea
son.
Stanford defeated the Rain
bow Wahine squad in the 1998
NCAA third-place match.
The Cardinal notched a 10-4
victory and closed the season by
capturing the bronze medal.
Seven different Cardinal
players scored during the game,
including senior goalie Heather
Crary who put away a phenome
nal full-court shot.
But earlier in the season the
Wahine gave Stanford a run for
its money.
In a Hawaii home match, the
Wahine played well enough to
force Stanford into overtime be
fore the Cardinal finally secured
the win.
Hawaii's performance last sea
son was especially impressive, con
sidering it was the squad's first sea
son of Division I collegiate compe
tition.
This season, Hawaii lost some
key players, including First-Team
All-American and national scoring
leader Marie-Luc Arpin. But re
gardless of its losses, the Wahine
squad still poses a legitimate
threat.
"They lost a couple of good
players," Tanner said. "But they
have more depth this year. They're
better than last year in that they
have a strong bench."
Hawaii's assets include two tal
ented left-handed players, return
ing starter Michele Wong and
transfer Katie Hill.
Wahine hole-set Karin
I Jmemura is also a strong offensive
player.
"They're biggest strength is on
offense," Tanner said. "But they're
also good on defense and on their
counterattack."
And the Cardinal hasn't had

long to prepare for the match.
After last weekend's three-day
UCSD Tournament, the Stanford
squad took Monday off before re
turning to the pool for yesterday's
practice.
"We've only had one practice to
get ready for the game," Tanner
said.
"The biggest thing for us is to
play good 5-on-6 defense."
Even though league play began
just a week and a half ago, Stanford
is already looking strong.
The squad has been making im
provements and fine-tuning its de
fense all year in preparation for
this season.
"We've been improving on of
fense," Tanner said. "And we've
been continuing to play good de
fense.
"We're keeping teams off bal
ance and holding their goals
down."
Stanford was ranked third at the
outset of the season, but the Cardi
nal upset then-No. 1 UCLA in the
first league match of the year to
take over the top spot.
Last weekend, Stanford won
three games before falling to No. 2
Cal in the semifinals.
The Cardinal finished third by
defeating UCLA for the second
time in one week.
