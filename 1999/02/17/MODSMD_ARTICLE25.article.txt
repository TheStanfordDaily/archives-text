### Chad Morse Contributing writer 
With sweeps in both the one
and three-meter diving competi
tions, Stanford women's diving
team gave its swimming squad just
enough breathing room to slip past
No. 6 California. The Saturday
event was the last dual meet of the
season.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING

■ Friday: No. 4 Stanford (9-2, 4-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
153, No. 6 California (11-3,4-2) 145.

In what proved to be the first
Cal-Stanford women's dual meet
to raise pulse a rate in the crowd in
years, the No. 4 Cardinal (9-2, 4-1
Pacific 10 conference) triumphed
over the newly resurgent Golden
Bears (11 -3, 4-2) by a score of 153-
145.
Competing in the morning, be

fore the swimming portion of the
meet, the talented Stanford diving
squad jumped out to a quick lead.
Taking center stage for the Car
dinal was senior Carissa Zenorini,
who won both the one- and three
meter competitions.
In the one-meter competition,
Zenorini was followed by team
mates Shawn Sinesky and Erin
Sones.
In the three-meter competition,
Sones took second and senior Kari
Kokka took third.
"We were tired and worn out
but pleased with our perfor
mance," said freshman diver Alex
is Sowa. "It's really exciting to
compete alongside the swim
team."
The swimming squad had high
praise for the divers as well.
"The divers are important in
every meet," said Stanford sopho
more swimmer Misty Hvman, "but
without them [this weekend], we
wouldn't have beaten Cal."
With their meet-winning perfor
mance against the Bears, the Cardi
nal divers merely continued to do
what they have done all season —
earn big points.
Saturday's meet made it clear
just how important the diving as
pect of the sport can be.
Out-performed in the water,
Stanford's women came up big on
the boards and came away with the
victory.
"We knew we had an opportuni
ty to go one-two-three this meet,"
said Zenorini, "but it was great to
actually pull it off."
While the Cardinal may have
been hard-pressed in the water, it
was not due to poor performances
by its swimming squad.
Both Cal and Stanford had out

standing times, with six new pool
records set at Berkeley's Spieker
Aquatics Complex.
The Bears were led by senior
standout Marylyn Chiang, who
came away with three victories
(two individual), two pool records
(one individual) and two Berkeley
dual-meet records.
Chiang won the 100-yard back
stroke (54.07) in pool record time
and captured the 100-yard freestyle
(49.99).
Chiang also anchored the pool
record setting 400-yard freestyle
relay (3:19.75).
Assuming the starring roles for
the Cardinal were Hyman and ju
nior Catherine Fox.
In what has become a familiar
picture, Hyman dominated both
butterfly events, setting pool
records in both the 100 (52.68) and
the 200(1:55.89).
In the past few weeks, Hyman
has edged ever closer to her NCAA
Championship-winning times of

last year.
Also, Stanford junior Jessica
Amey took third in the 100 with a
time of 55.43.
Fox took home two individual
victories as well. With a time of
23.26, Fox beat out Cal sprinter
Adrienne Matos in the 50-yard
freestyle.
The Cardinal's Sylvia Bereknyei
took third in the event in 23.70.
Fox also captured the 200-yard
backstroke (1:59.94) and swam the
backstroke leg of the 200-yard
medley relay (1:41.96), another
pool record-setting performance
for the Olympic gold medalist.
Other winners for Stanford
were junior Gabrielle Rose and se
nior co-captain Elin Austevoll.
Rose took a close race in the
200-yard freestyle (1:49.40), just
touching out a pair of Cal swim
mers.
She also took third in the 200-
yard breaststroke with a time of
2:19.72.

Austevoll took first and second
in the breaststroke events. Swim
ming a 1:03.82, she cruised to victo
ry in the 100.
Stanford freshman Whitney
Leatherwood tailed closely with a
1:04.49.
In the 200, Austevoll's time of
2:15.24 was good enough for sec
ond behind Cal's Joscelin Yeo.
In the distance freestyle events,
junior Courtney Lischke was the
Cardinal's top finisher. Lischke
placed second in the 1,000
(10:22.20) and third in the 500
(5:06.08).
With its last dual meet under its
belt, the Cardinal is now looking
towards the postseason.
After two weeks of practices of
decreasing intensity, the team will
travel to Federal Way, Wash., for
the Pac-10 Championships.
"We're right where we want to
be for Pac-lOs," Hyman said.
"We've put in the work. Now it's
time to rest."
