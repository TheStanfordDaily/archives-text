# Card Crushes Cal

### Catherine Chen 
With a season opener trounce
over California, the Stanford Syn
chronized Swimming team looks
primed for another championship
season.
The seven team members, head
ed by senior captain Vanessa Shaw,
make up the best team in Stanford's
brief NCAA synchronized swim
ming history. Furthermore, four of
the returning five team members
are All-Americans.
But this phenomenal team is fac
ing a season of uphill battles, despite
all of the talent. With the retirement
of head coach Vickey Weir, who left
after nearly 20 years of leading the
Cardinal, as well as the graduation
of Olympic gold medalist Heather
Pease, the team has lost two major
contributors to its success from last
season.
Stanford's new head coach, Gail
Emery, comes to the Farm after
coaching a private team in the East
Bay for more than 25 years. Like
her new swimmers, she brings an

impressive list of accomplishments
to the pool, including coaching four
Olympic teams and eight athletes to
Gold Medal finishes. In addition
she has coached her club team to 12
national championship titles in the
span of 13 years.
Emery hopes her excitement and
expertise in coaching title-winning
teams will rub off on the Cardinal.
"I am excited to be at Stanford
University helping build both the
team and this program. I have one
main goal â€” to bring a string of na
tional titles to this Cardinal team."
Along with adjusting to a new
coach, this year's team also faces a
unique challenge because it is the
first team in synchro history to vie
for the NCAA Title with only seven
members. In synchronized swim
ming, the team event has a mini
mum of four swimmers and a maxi
mum of eight. However, for every
swimmer below the maximum num
ber of eight, the team receives a
half-point deduction.
Sophomore Laura Yund, a mem
ber of last year's championship
team, left the squad less than a
month ago after training with the
team since August.
Thus, the squad is entering the
team competition at a distinct disad
vantage. Stunts and choreography
that are designed for eight people
have been adjusted to account for
the missing eighth person.
Yet even with this disadvantage,
the seven-woman squad showed its
amazing abilities at the first meet of
the season against Cal on Feb. 6.
The Cardinal swept all events

against its rival across the Bay. Se
nior captain Vanessa Shaw walked
away with a first place finish in solo
and duet, for Stanford, along with
freshman Lindsay Wigginton.
Wigginton later teamed up with
sophomores Shannon Montague
and Paige Freiheit to win the trio
competition.
Montague and Freiheit came in a
close second in duet behind Shaw
and Wigginton. Senior Emi
Kanayama, junior Julie Enos and
sophomore Kristi Wright finished
second behind the trio of Mon
tague, Freiheit and Wigginton.
The only sign of struggle for the
Cardinal was that the squad only
swam parts of its team routine be
cause the choreography is still being

changed to fit seven swimmers in
stead of the standard eight.
While the coaches and the team
do admit that swimming with seven
members will be a difficult task,
they are confident that this season
will bring with it another NCAA
Championship.
"We only have a seven member
team this year so we have our chal
lenges but we also are confident that
we are a super, solid seven" Emery
said.
The Cardinal will have a chance
to show off its hard work and dedi
cation this weekend as it as it heads
to Virginia to meet Ohio State. The
Cardinal beat the Buckeyes last
year by only two points to win the
title.
