# Card Crushes Cal
## 
### Catherine Chen 
With a season opener trounce
over California, the Stanford Syn
chronized Swimming team looks
primed for another championship
season.
The seven team members, head
ed by senior captain Vanessa Shaw,
make up the best team in Stanford's
brief NCAA synchronized swim
ming history. Furthermore, four of
the returning five team members
are All-Americans.
But this phenomenal team is fac
ing a season of uphill battles, despite
all of the talent. With the retirement
of head coach Vickey Weir, who left
after nearly 20 years of leading the
Cardinal, as well as the graduation
of Olympic gold medalist Heather
Pease, the team has lost two major
contributors to its success from last
season.
Stanford's new head coach, Gail
Emery, comes to the Farm after
coaching a private team in the East
Bay for more than 25 years. Like
her new swimmers, she brings an

impressive list of accomplishments
to the pool, including coaching four
Olympic teams and eight athletes to
Gold Medal finishes. In addition
she has coached her club team to 12
national championship titles in the
span of 13 years.
Emery hopes her excitement and
expertise in coaching title-winning
teams will rub off on the Cardinal.
"I am excited to be at Stanford
University helping build both the
team and this program. I have one
main goal â€” to bring a string of na
tional titles to this Cardinal team."
Along with adjusting to a new
coach, this year's team also faces a
unique challenge because it is the
first team in synchro history to vie
for the NCAA Title with only seven
members. In synchronized swim
ming, the team event has a mini
mum of four swimmers and a maxi
mum of eight. However, for every
swimmer below the maximum num
ber of eight, the team receives a
half-point deduction.
