### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
The No. 14 Stanford men's gymnastics team con
tinued its climb up the national rankings last weekend,
winning Sunday's three-school meet convincingly.
Stanford's final score — 218.65, easily surpassed
the second place score of 209.95 posted by the Air
Force Falcons. UC-Santa Barbara finished third
among the three with a final score of 206.95.
Stanford's 218.65 score was unquestionably a sea
son high, far surpassing its previous scores of 211.9,
215.15 and 213.60.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Sunday: No. 4 Stanford 218.65, Air Force 209.95
UC-Santa Barbara 206.95.

In addition to scoring a season high, Stanford gym
nasts nailed scores of 9.5 or better a total of six times,
and scores better than 9 in a total of 20 instances, a vast
improvement over previous meet scores.
The improvement reflected an increase in the
number of routines landed by Stanford gymnasts.
With the difficulty of the early season routines, this in
crease proves to be a step in the right direction for the
Cardinal.
"Everyone supported each other," said senior co
captain Scott Finkelstein. "The freshman hit more
routines. There was a definite sense of team spirit."
Stanford dominated throughout the match, win
ning the floor exercise, pommel horse, vault and par
allel bar competitions, in addition to finishing second
in the two remaining competitions, the high bar and
still rings.
While Stanford gymnasts struggled on the rings.
Air Force gymnasts were able to land clear routines.
They ended up with three out of the top-five and two
out of the top-three scores on the rings.
In any case, despite their dominance on the rings.
Air Force's gymnasts were unable to place anywhere
in the top-three individually with the exception of the
vault competition.
Freshman Adam Berkenbile had the best meet of
his young college career finishing first in the All-
Around competition with a score of 55.00.
He also finished first in both the pommel horse and
high bar competitions, posting scores of 9.7 and 9.6 re
spectively.
Adam Berkenbile was not the only member of the
Berkenbile family to demonstrate a marked improve
ment in Sunday's meet.
His twin brother Brandon also performed su
perbly, finishing second in the Ail-Around competi
tion with a score of 52, second in the floor exercise
(9.55) and second in the vault competition (9.2).
The one bright spot for UCSB was the perfor
mance of sophomore Cody Casey who finished third
in the All-Around competition (51.7), and won both
the floor exercise (9.65) and vault (9.465) competi
tions. His performance stood out from an otherwise
dismal performance from the UCSB squad.
The win for the Cardinal was especially meaningful
coming off last weekend's loss to B YLJ in Utah.
