# Card sweeps Pacific, easily defeats USD
## 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
Last Friday's highly-anticipated match between
top-ranked Zuzana Lesenarova of the University of
San Diego and Stanford freshman Marissa lrvin was
not meant to be, as Irvin's back injury kept her on the
bench.
As a result, junior captain Tervn Ashley, who plays
No. 2 singles for the Cardinal, stepped up to the plate
against the nation's No. 1.
Spectators worried that the match would be a blow
out, considering Lesenarova had won two collegiate
grand slams and taken lrvin to three tight sets at the
Rolex Indoor Championships in Dallas the weekend
prior.
As it turned out, the match was a blow-out, with one
catch — Ashley came out on top, 6-2, 6-2.
"Teryn just played really great," Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan said. "This is the best match I've
ever seen her play."
Ashley employed a dynamic shot selection in dis
mantling Lesenarova. The talented Cardinal was able
to match her opponent's flat and powerful ground
strokes. but it was her deft touch and variety that en
sured her victory.

"I tried to mix it up and disrupt her game," Ashley
said. "I came to the net and hit low slices to her lore
hand. And my serve helped a lot."
Ashley endured a rough fall season that saw her na
tional ranking plummet to a dismal 77th.
She has picked up her game since, however, and is
now considered one of the country's top contenders.
In the Rolex Indoor Championships, she upended
second-ranked Vanessa Webb of Duke. Friday's victo
ry over Lesenarova has convinced any remaining skep
tics of Ashley's talent.
"I feel really excited," Ashley said. "I had nothing
to lose."
Ashley's teammates also put in strong perfor
mances over the weekend. The Cardinal swept Pacific
on Thursday, 9-0. Then, Stanford trounced the Uni
versity of San Diego, 7-2, to improve its record to 8-0.
Freshman Gabby Lastra, competing at the No. 2
singles position, whipped San Diego's Anja Tragardh,

was plagued by double faults in a 6-2, 6-3 loss to San
Diego's Katrina Valkyova.
"Lauren just had a bad day." Brennan said. "Her
serve went off."
Sophomore Sarah Pestieau toppled the Toreros'
Millier Prior at the No. 6 spot, 6-4, 6-4, clinching the
dual match for the Cardinal.
In doubles action, Stanford's top team of Lastra /
