record in the

Michael

Ponikvar flew over seven feet in
the high jump last weekend as a
small Stanford contingent trekked
to Reno, Nev. for the Holiday Inn
Invitational.
In only his second meet of the
season, Connolly threw the 35-
pound weight 70 feet, seven inches
to win the competition. The toss
was also a stadium record for the
Reno venue and bettered Connol
ly's 1998 school and stadium best of
69-11.
"Adam is a meticulous prepar
er," said head coach Vin Lananna.

"He and [throwing coach] Robert
Weir had planned out when would
make the most sense for him to
throw, and 1 think he felt like he
wanted a little tune-up before the
Mountain Pacific Indoor meet and
the NCAAs".
"Adam is primarily a hammer
thrower, so anything he does in
doors is gravy," Lananna said.
"Seventy feet-seven is one heck of
a throw."
No other competitor threw the
implement even 60 feet.
In the vertical jumps, Ponikvar
did a little record setting of his own.
as his leap of 7-2 1/4 was a personal
best indoors and also one of the
highest marks a Stanford freshman
has ever posted.
Sophomore Todd Beyerlein
jumped to a second-place showing
at 6-11.
Ponikvar's mark surpassed the
NCAA provisional qualifying stan

dard and may be good enough to
earn him a spot in the national
meet.
Also competing for the Cardinal
over the weekend were two middle
distance runners who traveled to
the Los Angeles Coliseum to par
ticipate in the Los Angeles Invita
tional.
Junior Jake Maas took eighth in
the mile against a star-studded
field with a time of 4 minutes. 6.92
seconds, and sophomore Mark
Hassell was seventh in the 800-
meter run at 1:57.40.
Maas already qualified for the
NCAA meet provisionally last
week with a 4:02.68 mile at lowa
State's Cyclone Classic.
The remainder of Stanford's
athletes will still have one week
after the upcoming Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation champi
onship meet to post NCAA quali
fying marks.
