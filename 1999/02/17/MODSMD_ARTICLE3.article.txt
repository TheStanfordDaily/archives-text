# Spoon returns to dining halls
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Staff writer 
With newly coordinated efforts to both
reduce food leftovers in dining halls and con
tribute to local hunger relief programs, the
Spoon Hunger Relief Network is again
bringing Dining Services food leftovers to
the needy.
The project donates to the Urban Min
istry of Palo Alto, an umbrella organization
that helps allocate food to the hungry.
Rafi Taherian, executive chef at Stanford,
explained that recent negotiations with
Spoon have resulted in a new operational
policy. Spoon representatives are calling
dining managers and asking about food in
advance, instead of holding weekly set visits
to collect the food.
Spoon's mission statement asks partic

ipating parties, including campus dining
halls and the Faculty Club, to "understand
that Spoon does not attempt to feed commu
nity members by increasing costs, but rather
channels the unused food leftovers to those
who need it."
Previously, a Spoon representative visit
ed dining halls once every week to collect
leftovers. This created some difficulty for
Dining Services, whose staffs felt a timing
pressure because often, days with heavy left
overs did not coincide with the pickups, ac
cording to Taherian.
"We were not OK with that," Taherian
said. "We wanted more organization and ef
fort — it put a burden on [Dining Services]
people to round up food on the Spoon day,
and that wasn't acceptable."

Spoon Hunger Relief Network and Dining Services are working together once more
to deliver food to hungry people in Palo Alto.
Along the same lines, another
problem was that the previous
process gave the dining services
staffs incentive to work less effi
ciently, according to Spoon mem
ber and Faculty Club coordinator
Nathan Luther. They had less need
to be conscientious about waste be
cause Spoon made use of what they
did not.

"Our overall mission [for dining
services] is the reduction of waste,"
Taherian said. "We do this two
ways: first, we see if the food can be
potentially used as a byproduct in
another recipe, and second, we give
[leftovers] to any food collecting
agency" like Spoon.
Spoon coordinator Phoebe
Grow, a senior, arranged some dia
logue between the project and the
dining services to try to reach a
compromise.
"We're just in the process of

amassing volunteers and figuring
out what works best on an individ
ual basis with the dining halls,"
Grow said.
She added that the situation
looks positive and promising.
Dining Services has "been really
accommodating," said Meghan
Higgins, one of the Spoon coordina
tors.
"It was obviously inconvenient
for the dining halls to have a bunch
of people showing up with bags
|once a week). We all just kind of

compromised."
Spoon members seem positive
about working together with Din
ing Services to promote similar ob
jectives, like raising hunger aware
ness and reducing food waste.
"Once we got together," Taher
ian said, "we realized that Spoon is
concerned with our same objectives
about food. We don't want to create
extra food — we need to be able to
sustain the cost of the meal plan."
"We just had to find a way that
works for both of us," he said.
