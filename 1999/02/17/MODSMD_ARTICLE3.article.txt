# Spoon returns to dining halls
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Staff writer 
With newly coordinated efforts to both
reduce food leftovers in dining halls and con
tribute to local hunger relief programs, the
Spoon Hunger Relief Network is again
bringing Dining Services food leftovers to
the needy.
The project donates to the Urban Min
istry of Palo Alto, an umbrella organization
that helps allocate food to the hungry.
Rafi Taherian, executive chef at Stanford,
explained that recent negotiations with
Spoon have resulted in a new operational
policy. Spoon representatives are calling
dining managers and asking about food in
advance, instead of holding weekly set visits
to collect the food.
Spoon's mission statement asks partic

ipating parties, including campus dining
halls and the Faculty Club, to "understand
that Spoon does not attempt to feed commu
nity members by increasing costs, but rather
channels the unused food leftovers to those
who need it."
Previously, a Spoon representative visit
ed dining halls once every week to collect
leftovers. This created some difficulty for
Dining Services, whose staffs felt a timing
pressure because often, days with heavy left
overs did not coincide with the pickups, ac
cording to Taherian.
"We were not OK with that," Taherian
said. "We wanted more organization and ef
fort — it put a burden on [Dining Services]
people to round up food on the Spoon day,
and that wasn't acceptable."
