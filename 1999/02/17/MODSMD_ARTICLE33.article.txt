### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
One week under its belt, and the
Stanford softball team already has a
lot of things it can smile about.
Overall solid pitching and tough
defense, as well as a quick integration
of the freshman class into the heart of
the team has given the women a pos
itive look early in the season.
The Cardinal (4-1) swept St.
Mary's in decisive fashion in a Sun
day doubleheader after dropping
game one of its Saturday double
header to Pacific. The second game
against Pacific was canceled due to
rain.

SOFTBALL

■ Saturday: GAME 1 — Pacific (2-
0) 3, No. 14 Stanford (5-1) 1 (11 in
nings). GAME 2 — Canceled
■ Sunday: GAME 1 — No. 14 Stan
ford 18, Santa Clara (0-9) 1 (5 in
nings). GAME 2 — Stanford 4,
Santa Clara 0 (7 innings).

The team saw the Pacific game as
one of the tougher matchups on the
preseason schedule, and the Tigers
proved that to be true as they forced
Stanford into an 11-inning marathon
before pulling out the 3-1 win.
"I felt we played really well," said
senior pitcher Becky Blevins. "It's
tough to play a game that was that in
tense so early in the season. I defi
nitely don't think we have anything to
hang our heads about."
Both teams went scoreless
through the first eight innings, and
the Tigers drew first blood on a cost
ly pitching error by Blevins.
With two outs and runners at sec
ond and third, Blevins beaned Tiger
pinch-hitter Kelly Lowry to load the
bases.
Right fielder Tiffany Heilbut then
broke the deadlock with a one-run
single to third base.
But the Cardinal struck right back
in the bottom of the inning.
After right fielder Michelle Acos

ta opened the frame with a single to
center, senior Kelly Yablonski came
in to replace her on the basepaths.
Yablonski advanced to second on
a passed ball and then to third on a
double by shortstop Michelle Schnei
der.
She then proceeded to take home
on a fielding error by Tiger catcher
Erica Reynolds.
But another error cost the Cardi
nal the game.
With a runner on third and one
out in the top of the 11th, Blevins hit
another batter, putting runners at the

corners.
One out later the Tigers had run
ners on second and third and an error
by Cardinal third baseman Shane
Anderson allowed one run in. With
runners still on the corners, Pacific
center fielder Michelle Cordes
knocked in an insurance run.
Stanford jumped out of the gate
quickly on Sunday, trouncing the
Gaels (0-9) 18-1 in the opening game
behind the powerful hitting of two of
its freshman stars.
The offensive output shattered
the school's runs-scored record of 14

set against Cal State-Fullerton two
years ago.
Center fielder Jessica Mendoza
went 3 for 3 in game one, driving in
four runs and belting a triple. Fellow
rookie Christine Chao also went 3 for
3 and drove in another four runs be
hind two doubles and a grand slam.
"The UOP game was the first re
ally big game for our freshmen and I
think they did well," Blevins said.
"All of our freshmen are working re
ally well. They've done a great job of
stepping up to every challenge that
they've been given."
