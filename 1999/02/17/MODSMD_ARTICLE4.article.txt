# New FARM advising program gets good reviews
## 
### Anthony Chiu Contributing writer 
Reviews are mostly positive for
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter's latest initiative, the pilot Fresh
man Advising Resource and Men
toring program. Formed in an at
tempt to make undergraduate advis
ing more effective, the FARM pro
gram has been in place since the be
ginning of fall quarter.
The 120 freshmen involved in the
program are housed together in

West Lagunita, Rinconada or Otero.
Unique features of the program in
clude a graduate student mentor to
complement the advising associate
and freshman adviser, as well as a
weekly one hour adviser group
meeting.
"I think it's been really positive,"
said FARM coordinator Maia
Young. "Overall, students who are in
FARM feel that they are getting
good advising and making more in
formed choices with their knowledge
of campus resources."

The program is very structured, as
each meeting has a curriculum that
includes various objectives, group
activities and a "realistic desired im
pact."
"We've learned a lot of useful
things," said freshman Amanda Vin
son, who cited faculty interaction
and practice in writing grants and re
sumes as valuable experiences.
Another advantage of the pro
gram is the closer contact between
freshmen and their AAs and grad
mentors as a result of their weekly

meetings. "If you have someone
there for you every week for an hour,
it's hard to feel abandoned," said se
nior Peter Kasson, the head advising
associate for West Lagunita.
However, not all were completely
positive. "1 like how they tell you
about research opportunities and
summer internships... but the once
a-week meetings just get in the way,"
said freshman Ryan Meuse. "You
get together and talk about nothing.
It's seems like another task, an extra
hour of class."

An easy solution to that would be
course credit, said one of the men
tors.
"I think that it would be great if
the freshmen could be given one unit
a quarter for attendance and partic
ipation in all the functions," said
Holly Tabor, a graduate mentor and
third-year student in the doctoral
program in epidemiology, 'it's a lot
of work, and I think it would be great
if it could result in some units as well
as accumulated knowledge and
experience."

Another drawback is the lack of
information for incoming freshmen.
Some students said that they did not
even plan to be in the program or
simply checked the box on a whim. "I
would recommend that they put
more description in Approaching
Stanford so people know what they
are signing up for," said freshman
Jennifer Chu.
The FARM program, which is
funded by the Provost's Office, is
scheduled to continue and possibly
expand next year. "I think it's a great
program for freshmen, and I have
even met some freshmen who wish
they had signed up for it," Tabor
said.
"Since it meets once a week, it's
important to really want to partic
ipate, though."
