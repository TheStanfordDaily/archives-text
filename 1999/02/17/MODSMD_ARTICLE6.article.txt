# Geophysics team heads to Colombia for quake study

To study the aftermath of the devastating Jan. 25
earthquake, a team of scientists heads to Colombia
today with the non-profit organization GeoHazards
International.
Carlos Villacis, the group's technical director, and
recent engineering graduate Cynthia Cardona will
lead the team on the two-week trip. The team also in
cludes two geophysics graduate students from Stan
ford.
GeoHazards International, based in Palo Alto, was
founded six years ago by current president Brian I uck
er, a seismologist and consulting professor at Stanford.
On their Web site at www.geohaz.org, Tucker states
that the organization's goal is to "reduce death and in
jury caused by earthquakes in the world's most vulner
able communities."
The team will stay in Pereira, Colombia, and travel
to the cities of Armenia and Bogota to interview local
residents and study the structural damage.
Their primary objectives are to investigate the level
of preparedness of each city and then to explore the
possibility of recommending an awareness project in
the region.

"Awareness and experience play a big role in a
city's ability to respond properly to emergencies," said
Villacis.
The 6.0 Richter scale earthquake especially rattled
Pereira and Armenia, both of which were fairly
equidistant from the epicenter. While the two cities
suffered tremendously, Pereira had considerably
smaller losses.
Armenia endured approximately 1,7(X) injuries and
70 percent of its buildings were damaged as opposed to
650 injuries and 40 percent of the buildings damaged in
Pereira.
The GeoHazards team believes that this disparity
could be due to Pereira's better earthquake prepara
tions after previous quakes earlier this century. Jan. 25
marked the first recorded earthquake in Armenia in at
least a hundred years.
According to Villacis, Cardona, who was working in
Bogota at the time of the earthquake, noted that other
cities sent much needed supplies into Armenia, but
there were no authorities to handle them. Even police
and fire stations were inoperable in the midst of the dis
aster.
