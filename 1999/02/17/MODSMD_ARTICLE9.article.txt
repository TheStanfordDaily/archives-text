Hillary Clinton considers running
for Senate
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Hillary Rodham Clin
ton said yesterday she would give "careful thought"
to running for a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
Three confidants said she was talking with supporters
about what it would take to run a serious campaign.
The first lady promised to make her decision later
this year. President Clinton said on Monday she
would be "terrific in the Senate."
Mrs. Clinton said she was deeply gratified by "the
large number of people who have encouraged me to
consider running" for the Senate seat being opened
by the retirement of Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick
Movnihan in 2(KX).
Just four davs after the end of her husband's

impeachment ordeal, Mrs. Clinton said she had not
been able to give much thought to a potential candi
dacy but would be able to focus on it now. She said
she would make her decision later this year.
"In the meantime," she said in a three-sentence
statement, "I intend to continue to focus my atten
tion on the issues central to the president's agenda
and on which we have worked together for so many
years."
Marsha Berry, her press secretary, said she could
not elaborate on the timing of Mrs. Clinton's deci
sion. "1 can't be any more specific than that because
she doesn't know. She's going to talk to people, those
who want her to do it and some who don't, and hear
them out."
Clinton said Monday he would enthusiastically
support whatever decision she makes.
