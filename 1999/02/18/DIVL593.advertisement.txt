gram at New York University's Courant Institute
of Mathematical Sciences combines the faculty of
the top-rated* applied mathematics department in
the United States with practitioners from New
York's leading financial institutions.
The NYU program includes graduate level
course work in mathematics, computation,
finance theory, and practical aspects of the
finance industry.

• Quantitative risk management
• Stochastic processes and partial differential
equations
• Scientific computing
• Interest rate and currency modeling
