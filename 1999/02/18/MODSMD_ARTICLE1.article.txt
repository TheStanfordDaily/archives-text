# Cancer center planning draws fire
## Environmental groups ask for halt until general planning is considered 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
Stanford officials are seeking final approval
from the Palo Alto City Council for a planned
cancer treatment and research building at Stan
ford Medical Center to replace the current
cramped, scattered facilities â€” some constructed
in 1957,
However, the proposal is running into opposi
tion from local politicians and open-space ac
tivists who want more oversight of Stanford de
velopment.
Denice Dade, Santa Clara County legislative
advocate for the Committee for Green Foothills,
said the committee supports a City of Palo Alto
policy proposed by four city council members

that would delay any further Stanford develop
ment plans in Palo Alto, including the cancer cen
ter, until after the completion of a new General
Use Permit to govern Stanford development.
Stanford officials expect that process to take
two to three years, which they say is unaccept
able.
"Any delay equals a cease-fire in the war on
cancer," said Charlotte Jacobs, professor of on
cology and director of the Clinical Cancer Center
at Stanford.
"This [proposal] has been around" since 1994,
said Larry Horton, University director of com
munity and government relations. "This is not a
new project."
But activists claim that Stanford's land-use
planning is inadequate.

"We are not opposed to the cancer research
center," Dade said, but in favor of planning by
Stanford "that's required of everyone else."
The full city council will take up the issue on
March 1.
"Your environment has an effect on whether
you get well," Jacobs said.
Cancer patients receiving infusion therapy in
the current building are often confined for hours
to 12-foot-by-12-foot converted opthalmology
exam rooms in the basement.
