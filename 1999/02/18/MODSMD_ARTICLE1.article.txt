# Cancer center planning draws fire
## Environmental groups ask for halt until general planning is considered 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
Stanford officials are seeking final approval
from the Palo Alto City Council for a planned
cancer treatment and research building at Stan
ford Medical Center to replace the current
cramped, scattered facilities â€” some constructed
in 1957,
However, the proposal is running into opposi
tion from local politicians and open-space ac
tivists who want more oversight of Stanford de
velopment.
Denice Dade, Santa Clara County legislative
advocate for the Committee for Green Foothills,
said the committee supports a City of Palo Alto
policy proposed by four city council members

that would delay any further Stanford develop
ment plans in Palo Alto, including the cancer cen
ter, until after the completion of a new General
Use Permit to govern Stanford development.
Stanford officials expect that process to take
two to three years, which they say is unaccept
able.
"Any delay equals a cease-fire in the war on
cancer," said Charlotte Jacobs, professor of on
cology and director of the Clinical Cancer Center
at Stanford.
"This [proposal] has been around" since 1994,
said Larry Horton, University director of com
munity and government relations. "This is not a
new project."
But activists claim that Stanford's land-use
planning is inadequate.

"We are not opposed to the cancer research
center," Dade said, but in favor of planning by
Stanford "that's required of everyone else."
The full city council will take up the issue on
March 1.
"Your environment has an effect on whether
you get well," Jacobs said.
Cancer patients receiving infusion therapy in
the current building are often confined for hours
to 12-foot-by-12-foot converted opthalmology
exam rooms in the basement.

reach the department. Radiation
treatment is limited by the depart
ment's cramped quarters as well.
"The machines have two power
levels," said Jose Fernandez, design
and construction director for for
UCSF-Stanford Health Care. "We
can't use the full capacity... because
the walls aren't thick enough" for ra
diation shielding.
Physician workspace is also
cramped, with teams of doctors often
meeting in narrow hallways and
stuffy workrooms.
The new $118-million, 218,000-
square-foot building would consoli
date outpatient cancer treatment
and cancer research, as well as house
some new surgery facilities in one
state-of-the-art building. The site,
adjacent to Packard Hospital, is cur
rently a parking lot; new parking is

planned as well. Forty-three million
dollars have already been raised to
ward a fundraising goal of $50 mil
lion for the project.
The building is within Palo Alto
and thus not covered by the current
General Use Permit, which governs
building on central campus and
foothill lands in unincorporated
Santa Clara County.
" There's no reason to hold [the
cancer center] hostage to any other
process," said Horton. "We will ad
dress open space concerns in the
GUP.''
But local politicians and activists
are in favor of a new General Use
Permit that covers all development
on Stanford land, regardless of juris
diction.
"Smart growth is from a regional
perspective," said Dade, noting that
development impacts reach across
boundaries. She accused Stanford of
"continually trying to circumvent
planning processes."
