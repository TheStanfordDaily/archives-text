## Race-based admissions banned Desegregation case reaches settlement 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” San
Francisco schools and the NAACP
agreed yesterday to abandon race
based school admissions to settle a
suit by Chinese-American students
who were kept out of the schools
they wanted to attend by quotas.
The settlement, which gained
preliminary approval from a federal
judge, would eliminate racial and
ethnic ceilings that have been
enforced at each San Francisco
school for 15 years.
It also would prohibit assigning
any of the district's 62,(XX) students
to a school, class or program solely
on the basis of race or ethnicity, but
would let the district consider diver
sity, along with economics and geog
raphy, in a new assignment plan
starting in the fall of 2(XX).
The ban on racial and ethnic
admissions would take effect this fall
only for students in kindergarten
and the sixth and ninth grade, and
for students new to the district. It
would cover all students the follow
ing year.
The settlement leaves the dis
trict's overall desegregation efforts
under court supervision through the
end of 2(X)2.
That means the district should be
able to keep $37 million a year that it
now receives from the state for
remedial and enrichment classes and
other programs to eliminate the
effects of segregation, said Anthony
Anderson, an associate superinten
dent.
U.S. District Judge William
Orrick praised all sides for bringing
the case to a "successful and peace
ful solution" and avoiding a poten
tially divisive trial, which was to have
started Tuesday. He gave prelimi
nary approval to the settlement and
scheduled a hearing on final
approval for April 20.
The enrollment ceilings, to be
repealed this fall, set a limit of 45
percent on enrollment of any racial
or ethnic group at a school and a 40

percent limit at alternative or "mag
net" schools.
The latter category includes elite
Lowell High, which has an entrance
examination and counts Supreme
Court Justice Stephen Breyer and
former Gov. Pat Brown among its
alumni.
The limits are part of a desegre
gation program, approved by Orrick
in 1983, that settled a 1978 discrimi
nation suit by the NAACP.
Daniel Gerard, lawyer for three
Chinese-American students and
their parents who filed the suit in
1994, said the settlement "in many
ways (is) better than what we could
have achieved through litigation."
since it gives the parents a role in
working with the school district and
oversee ing com pliance.
"We think this gives control of
the district back to the population of
San Francisco," he said.
"This is definitely worth the
fight," said Charlene Loen. whose
14-year-old son. plaintiff Patrick
Wong, was denied admission to
Lowell High in 1994.
At that time, the school required
higher test scores from Chinese-
American applicants than other eth
nic groups.
That policy has been changed,
but the 1983 court ifrder still has the
effect of curbing Lowell's Chinese-
American enrollment, the largest of
any group.
Wong. 18. now attends the UC-
Irvine. The other two plaintiffs were
denied admission to neighborhood
elementary schools because Chi
nese-American enrollment already
exceeded 45 percent.
The settlement comes at a time of
increasing judicial hostility to race
based admissions.
Last November, a federal appeals
court struck down race as a factor in
the admissions process at the presti
gious Boston Latin School. The
school board has decided not to
appeal this decision.
