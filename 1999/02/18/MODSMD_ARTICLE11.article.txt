# Kurds protest leader's arrest

### 
BERLIN (AP) — Israeli securi
ty guards shot and killed three
Kurds who forced their way into
the Israeli consulate yesterday with
dozens of protesters enraged by
reports that Israel aided in the
arrest of the foremost Kurdish
rebel leader.
Turkish officials jubilantly
released a videotape of their cap
tive, Abdullah Ocalan, dramatic
footage showing him handcuffed
and sweating, his eyes taped shut.
Officials said he was being interro
gated in an island prison and
promised a fair trial, but refused to
allow three of his foreign attorneys
into Turkey.
In Berlin, as many as 100
demonstrators pummeled their way
past 30 German police officers Sent
to the Israeli consulate 30 minutes
earlier after officials received
reports that Kurds planned to take
the building, police chief Hagen
Saberschinsky said.
The Kurds climbed a fence sur
rounding the four-story white
building and broke through the
door. A man and a woman were
shot to death in the consulate's
foyer and another man was shot in
a stairwell. Saberschinsky said.
At least 43 people were injured:
16 demonstrators and 27 police offi
cers. Police said they arrested 220
Kurds, 45 at the consulate and the
remainder at demonstrations after
the shootings.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu reiterated that Israel
had no role in Ocalan's arrest and
defended the shootings, saying the
guards acted in self-defense.
Israel had put its diplomatic mis
sions on alert after a news report
claimed that Israel's Mossad intelli
gence agency helped Turkey track
Ocalan.
The violence in Berlin brought
stern warnings for Germany's half
million Kurds to curb their outrage.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said Germany would "not tolerate
having political conflicts from for
eign countries carried over into
German streets." And Interior

Minister Otto Schily threatened to
deport Kurds involved in violent
protests.
Ocalan and his guerrillas have
waged a 14-year war for Kurdish
autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
Almost 37.000 people have died in
the conflict. He could face the
death penalty if convicted.
Kurds began seizing Greek
diplomatic posts across Europe
early 'Tuesday after learning of
Ocalan's capture in Kenya, where
he had been hiding at the Greek
ambassador's residence in Nairobi.
Many of the demonstrations
ended yesterday. But about 40
protesters held a clerk hostage in
the Greek Embassy in London and
announced they were beginning a
hunger strike, police said. Occupa
tions also continued at the offices of

political parties in Sweden and
Austria.
The U.S. State Department
warned that Kurdish violence could
extend to American interests and
urged U.S. citizens traveling or liv
ing abroad to review their personal
security.
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said four or five Turkish
commandos, a pilot and a doctor
took part in the covert operation
that brought Oca lan back to
Turkey.
Turkish intelligence released a
videotape showing Ocalan being
put aboard a private jet in Kenya,
blindfolded with tape and in hand
cuffs.
On the video, masked Turkish
commandos strap Ocalan into a
seat and the tape wrapped around

his head is cut off. He winces. A
close-up shows his face drenched in
sweat.
One of the commandos tells him
the tape is rolling.
"You can tape me and broadcast
it since you haven't tortured me,"
Ocalan says. "1 love my country.
My mother was a Turk. If there is
anything I can do, I will do it. Don't
ask me anything else."
One of the commandos replies:
"Welcome to your country. You're
our guest now."
The footage ends with the com
mandos making victorious "high
five" and "thumbs up" signs.
The nucleus of the special com
mando force, known as the
"maroon berets," was trained by
Green Berets and other American
instructors.
