WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Kenneth
Starr is clearing the way for Monica
Lewinsky to give her first television inter
view. hut prosecutors and lawyers for the
former White House intern are still dis
cussing restrictions on what she can say.
people familiar with the talks said yester
day.
Under the arrangements being worked
out with Starr's office, Lewinsky could he
interviewed by ABC as early as Saturday
about her relationship with President
Clinton. The network is hoping to run the
Barbara Walters interview during the
February ratings "sweeps'" period, which
ends March 3. Lewinsky's book in collab
oration with Princess Diana biographer
Andrew Morton will be published March
The main restriction is that Lewinsky
cannot go beyond what she has said in her
numerous interviews with prosecutors
and in her grand jury testimony, said the
sources, all speaking on condition of
anonymity. All of those interview sum
maries and testimony from her two grand
jury appearances and from a sworn depo

sition in Starr's offices already are on the
public record.
Also, "there are a number of areas still
under investigation and those are off-lim
its" for Lewinsky to respond to, said one
of the sources.
The negotiations are necessary due to
a prohibition about talking to the news
media contained in the agreement Lewin
sky signed with Starr's Office of Indepen
dent Counsel last July 28. In exchange for
promising not to prosecute Ms. Lewinsky,
the document states that "pending a final
resolution of this matter, neither Lewin
sky nor her agents will make any state
ments about this matter t0... representa
tives of the news media, without first
obtaining the OlC's approval."
I lie grand jury that Starr used to con
duct his perjury and obstruction investi
gation of Clinton is meeting twice this
week. While Starr concluded some time
ago that a sitting president is indictable, it
does not appear that the prosecutor is
gearing up for a case against ( 'linton. One
of Starr's deputies has left the office and
at least one other key prosecutor is

preparing to leave, according to people
familiar with the plans of Starr's prosecu
tors.
Lewinsky's testimony conflicts on a
number of points with both Clinton and
presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who
helped line up a job offer for the ex-intern
and found her a lawyer when she was sub
poenaed as a witness against Clinton in
the Paula Jones case.
Lewinsky has testified that she tried to
make clear to Jordan that she had an inti
mate relationship with the president after
initially denying having sexual relations
with Clinton in response to a direct ques
tion from Jordan.
She also says she understood Jordan
was telling her to destroy drafts of notes
she had written the president. Jordan
denies doing so.
In regard to Clinton, Lewinsky's testi
mony conflicts on when their intimate
relationship started, how many times they
engaged in such behavior and the details
of their encounters. He says he never
touched her in a sexual manner. She says
he did.
