# US to approve India loan request
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Respond
ing to recent nonproliferation gestures by
India, the Clinton administration plans to
open the way for World Bank approval
of a $150 million loan request for a power
project in central India, an administra
tion official said yesterday.
The step represents an easing of the
sanctions that were imposed last May
after India conducted a series of nuclear
tests.
In addition, the official said President
Clinton has been in contact in recent days
with Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpay
ee of India and Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan
on the possibility of a visit to the two
countries later this year.
Clinton needs a "high degree of confi
dence" that the nuclear disagreements
that have plagued U.S. relations with
both countries won't dominate his visits.

said the official, asking not to be identi
fied.
Those issues have been dealt with dur
ing eight rounds of discussions that
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
has held separately with top Indian and
Pakistani leaders.
The official said Clinton has no inter
est in covering the same ground as Tal
bott if the president decides to make the
trip. He was supposed to have gone in
1998 but the nuclear testing last May. first
by India and later by Pakistan, prompted
a postponement.
It was not clear from the official's
remarks how much progress will have to
be made for Clinton to agree to go.
The United States has agreed to
adjust its sanctions policy toward both
India and Pakistan on the basis of
progress in the nonproliferation negotia

tions.
India had made it clear early on that it
would not sign the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty — a key U.S. goal — while
under sanctions. But officials from both
countries said two weeks ago, after Tal
bott's most recent visit, that there was
movement toward a resolution.
Using its influence in the World Bank,
the United States has blocked approval
of the Indian request for the power pro
ject loan. The official said the United
States did not plan to support the loan
but would allow it to come to a vote.
Pakistan's main interest after the sanc
tions were imposed was in regaining
access to loans from the International
Monetary Fund. Amid evidence that
Pakistan was heading for economic disas
ter, the United States lifted its opposition
to IMF loans for Pakistan last November.
