Decision not to give
Warrior tenure adds
to disturbing trend

Sometimes it just seems
as if we're experiencing deja
vu.
Regardless of whether we believe
that affirmative action should or
should not be applied in the tenure
process, we cannot help but con
clude that the recent decision of the
deans of the School of Humanities
and Sciences to deny tenure to Asst.
English Prof. Robert Warrior raises
serious questions about the Univer
sity's commitment to faculty diversi
ty and non-traditional studies.
Warrior, whose scholarship is in
the field of Native American studies,
is one of two professors in the Native
American Studies program and one
of three Native Americans on the
Stanford faculty.
It seems terribly contradictory
that the University implemented a
program in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity during the spring
of 1997, but appears unwilling to
tenure junior faculty, such as War
rior, who teach in the program.
At minimum, the Administration
must make a firm commitment to
hiring a Native American studies
scholar to replace Warrior. Other
wise its commitment to CSRE will
look truly farcical.
The Warrior decision also comes
at a time when the University faces a
potential investigation by the Labor
Department.
A complaint filed in November by
eight faculty and staff members
alleged gender discrimination in the
University's hiring and promotion
practices, including tenure.
With a spotlight focused on its hir
ing and promotion practices, the
University can hardly afford to deny

tenure to a respected minority schol
ar.
In short, Warrior's case appears to
be hauntingly reminiscent of the
tenure cases of then-Asst. Anthro
pology Prof. Akhil Gupta and for
mer Asst. History Prof. Karen Saw
islak.
Like Gupta and Sawislak, Warrior
receives high praise from both col
leagues and students.
Like Gupta and Sawislak, Warrior
has been commended for his pro
student attitude and his dedication
to teaching and mentoring students.
Like Gupta and Sawislak, War
rior's academic interests lie in a field
which has yet to gain legitimacy
among certain segments of the aca
demic community.
Like Gupta and Sawislak, the
deans of the School of Humanities
and Sciences have recommended
that he be denied tenure.
And as was the case with Gupta
and Sawislak, we fear that the War
rior case, should he choose to appeal
the ruling, will ultimately be
resolved without meaningfully
addressing some fundamental ques
tions.
What is the University's commit
ment to faculty diversity? What is its
commitment to scholarship that falls
outside the mainstream of accepted
research fields?
The Stanford community deserves
more than another indecisive tenure
skirmish that leaves these questions
unanswered.
At the very least, we deserve an
open, productive dialogue about the
tenure process and a demonstrated
commitment on the part of the Uni
versity to making Stanford a hos
pitable environment for all fields of
inquiry, including Native American
studies.
History need not repeat itself,
though all indicators suggest that it
will.
