# From the trenches:
## Love's labour at Stanford 
### 
Erin Bouchier

Love is in the air, or
so they say. But
where? At Stan
ford?
With the recent passing of
Valentine's Day, I can at
least say that love is on my
mind. For those blessed

with beloved significant others, you hopeful
ly reveled in the one holiday dedicated to
I'amour.
For the rest of us flying solo, many of
whom see Valentine's Day as a conspiracy
involving Hallmark, I-800-FLOWERS and
See's, I hope it wasn't too painful.
Bemoaning this artificial holiday and the
loneliness it brings for the unlucky in love,
my girlfriends and 1 made our way to a party.
Looking for love in all the wrong places,
maybe?
Potential mates may be plentiful and
packed conveniently into a confined space;
however, immersing yourself in throngs of
sweaty, smelly people and bumping and
grinding to thundering music is certainly not
the optimal atmosphere for a get-to-know
you conversation.
The 21 and older crowd (and those who
are skilled with a color copier) can partake in
the wonders of the Palo Alto bar scene. But
bars may be even less fertile mating grounds
than campus parties. Palo Alto bars seem to
require their patrons to be at least 30, male
and utterly unattractive. In a word, sketchy.
Consequently, hitting the bars is not likely a
fruitful endeavor in the quest for love.
A better bet might be classes or sections.
It's quite natural to start up a conversation,
maybe with the standard, "What did you

think of the test?" After a few successful
academically-themed exchanges, you can
make the simple transition to social conver
sation. Did you spend a lot of the time on
the reading this weekend? No? So what did
you do?
Once this transition has been made,
you're on your way to waving in White Plaza
and chatting at parties. It's not a foolproof
formula for romance (then again, what is?),
but at the very least you've made a new
friend.
Speaking of friends, they are theoretically
one of the best means through which to meet
a potential love. Friends know what you're
like and what you like, but everyone has
heard horror stories of friends' failed
attempts at matchmaking and blind dates
gone horribly wrong.
Friends are not infallible, but they are
often quite successful at facilitating romance.
Take for example a couple I know well.
Meeting on what was ostensibly a blind date
in 1967, they have been together ever since,
blissfully married for 30 years. Moral of the
story: let your friends hook you up every so
often.
Of course, do not overlook your friends
themselves as potential love interests. If you
belong to the "When Harry Met Sally"
school of romance, you remember that at the
end of the movie, Harry and Sally, close
friends for years, accept their true feelings
for one another. Straight to the altar they
run, a content couple. While it's debatable
whether the transition from friends to lovers
has ever been this simple or successful in real
life, it's still worth considering. You never
know what could happen.

A piece of wisdom: do not look to your
friends' ex's for romance.
Rarely a good scene, dating a friend's ex
almost always results in more tension than
it's worth. More often than not, you lose the
friend and the ex.
But if through these means or others you
manage to meet that nearly perfect some
one, what does the future hold?
Lets take a quick look at your typical
Stanford relationship. As has been oft
lamented in the past by everyone from Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper on down,
Stanford does not seem to have any sem
blance of a normal dating scene. We tend to
have extremes.
Think of a couple you know at Stanford.
Do they seem like they have already taken
their marriage vows? Are they constantly
together? Does each one know their love's
schedule better than they know their own?
For many Stanford couples, this is indeed the
case.
Now think of a single person you know.
Does he or she actually go out on dates with
much regularity? Not likely. Where's the
happy medium?
There are no easy answers, no ideal places
to find romance and no optimal dating con
ditions. But don't lose hope.
We're supposed to be a bright bunch;
with time, we can only come closer to figur
ing it out. In the meantime, if you see my
Prince Charming galloping around on his
horse, send him my way.
