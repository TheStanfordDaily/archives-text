Facts about financial aid increase
I am writing in response to Erik Ben
son's letter to The Daily on Thursday, Feb.
11. In his letter, he expressed concern that
the $500,000 announced as additional
financial aid for 1999-2(XX) was not enough
to cover the tuition increase next year for
all students on financial aid. Students need
to be aware that the $S(K).(XX) is in addition
to the budgeted increase already planned
for financial aid for the 1999-2(XX) year.
Stanford's policy to meet the full calcu
lated need of all undergraduate students
on financial aid has not changed. For 1999-
2(XX), the full cost of this policy will contin
ue to be covered by the financial aid bud
get. In addition, $S(X),(XX) more is being
allocated to the financial aid budget so that
the particular mix between scholarship and
self-help dollars can be adjusted in some
situations to make Stanford affordable,
especially for lower income students. In all
cases, the total aid package for both new
and continuing students is based on need.
Continuing students on financial aid
should rest assured that they will benefit
from the annual increase in the financial
aid budget, approved by the Board of
Trustees at their February meeting. The
level of job and loan in the financial aid
package will remain the same as in the
prior two years.
I hope this information will alleviate the
concerns that students may have regarding"
their financial aid awards for the upcoming

year. Please contact the financial aid office
if you have any question* about your finan
cial package.

Hilton misuses affirmative action
In his letter yesterday, Prof. Emeritus
Ronald Hilton attempted vainly to argue
the misuses of affirmative action.
I have heard other critiques of a policy
that needs revision before. Hilton's com
ments, however, are not only difficult to
follow, but they fail to justify why affirma
tive action should be done away with. He
sets out to enumerate isolated incidents
that, while unfortunate, do not explain his
thesis that affirmative action is a complete
failure.
Also, I would expect Hilton, as a former
professor affiliated with Latin American
studies, to be versed in Latino politics on
either side of the border. Apparently this is
not the case, as Hilton begins his letter by
arguing that "the popularity among Chi
canos of wild Aztlan ideas has provoked a
backlash against Chicanos."
I will concede that during the late 1960s
and early 1970s Chicano nationalism was
very popular in that community. However,
to argue that this is still the case and the
cause for a backlash or discrimination
against Chicanos is not only a ridiculous
conclusion but a historically misplaced one

as well.
We are currently 30 years removed
from the early nationalist concepts of Azt
lan that Hilton would have encountered at
the height of his academic career. A little
research at our libraries will reveal that the
bulk of Hilton's work was between 1948
and 1970. This would explain the broad
brush strokes he has used to define Chi
cano politics. Perhaps Hilton has been
unable to read about the development of
Chicano political ideology since the Chi
cano Movement.
I would encourage him to seek out the
works of historians such as Juan Gomez
Quinones, Vicki Ruiz and David Gutierrez
to familiarize himself with the develop
ment of Chicano politics both during the
Movement and since. These would greatly
assist Hilton in understanding that the
backlash against Chicanos is not a recent
phenomenon, but a continued history of
oppression that resulted from being
strangers in their own land.
We are not experiencing a backlash
because of our "wild Aztlan ideas;" rather,
the cycle of oppression is continuing in our
country and on our campus. That's what
happens when racist notions are not chal
lenged.
To quote Hilton from a Daily letter he
wrote during my sophomore year,
"Engage in enlightened debate, but not in
yahoo behavior." Arguing that Chicanos
still subscribe to 30-year old notions of
nationalism is not only evidence of igno

rance on the subject, but also irresponsible
"yahoo behavior," especially from some
one as esteemed as a Hoover Institution
fellow.

Warrior decision not surprising
Students are questioning the Universi
ty's commitment to Native American stud
ies because one professor was not granted
tenure?
Given the competitiveness of academia,
especially in the humanities, no one should
be shocked or surprised that a certain per
son wasn't granted tenure.
Just because your best friend didn't get
in to Stanford, does that mean that Stan
ford holds whatever special abilities or tal
ents your friend possesses in low regard?
No, it's simply that the numbers dictate
that there are more qualified applicants
than spots, and the selection of one student
over another will sometimes be almost
arbitrary.
The English department hasn't tenured
a professor in the last 10 years.
This causes people to question why he
wasn't given tenure? It should cause peo
ple to understand why he wasn't given
tenure.
