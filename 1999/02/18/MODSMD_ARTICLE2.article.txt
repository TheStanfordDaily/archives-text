# Directors get funding
## Full-time posts in works for Women's Center 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
Dean of Students Marc Wais an
nounced yesterday that both the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com
munity Center and the Women's
Center will receive funding for full
time directors beginning next Sep
tember.
Fabienne McPhail, the current
half-time director of the Women's
Center, will now work full-time at
the center.
A nationwide search, conducted
by Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves, will be held this spring to
find a permanent director for the
LGBCC.
"This is a historical moment for
the Woman's Center and the
LGBCC. I feel honored to serve
students on our campus," McPhail
said, in a press release compiled by
Wais.
The announcement comes after
the repeated denial of student re
quests throughout the years for in
creased staffing at the centers.
"It's a fight that's been 26 years
in the making," said sophomore Jill
Di Giovanni, referring to the length
of time the Women's Center has
been on campus.
"The struggle's been going on
for a long time," said Sarah Guy,
who has volunteered at the
Women's Center and is currently on
staff at the LGBCC.
The Women's Center received
funding for a half-time director in
1997. Before that time, the Center
did not have a director.

Funds were allocated for a half
time director at the LGBCC last
year. After a nationwide search,
Gwendolyn Dean was hired.
But Dean left Stanford abruptly
in November, accepting a similar
full-time position at Cornell Uni
versity.
"There have been efforts, I
think, for the better part of a decade
[to get a full-time director] for the
LGBCC," said Zack Allen, a mas
ters student in Latin American
studies.
"When [Dean] left. I feel that
was sort of a catalyst for students,"
he said, adding that he was very
pleased with the solidarity students
showed on the issue.
About 50 concerned students
met with Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya, Graves
and Wais in December to voice
their request for a full-time director
for the LGBCC.
"The [lesbian, gay, bisexual] and
women's communities have been
extremely helpful by articulating
student needs in a thoughtful and
honest way, and for that I am ex
tremely grateful," said Montoya in
the press release.
Nam Hee Kim. a sophomore
volunteer at the Women's Center,
said, "it's great that the administra
tion is finally making up for its lack
of support by giving us the support
now."
Allen praised administrators for
their efforts in finding funding for
the centers despite budget con
cerns.
Wais said that the budgets for
the other campus community cen
ters will not be reduced due to the
increase in staffing. He said the
funding for the increase in staffing
will be "primarily absorbed" within
the overall budget for the Dean of
Students office.
Duties for the new directors will
include enhancing "educational

focus, programming initiatives, op
erational management and re
sponse / support to acts of intoler
ance," according to an e-mail sent to
students by Wais.
"I'm working long hours here as
it is, and will continue to respond to
women on campus," said McPhail,
saying her job description will basi

cally stay the same. She will, howev
er, give up her current half-time po
sition as a Graduate Residence
Dean.
Juan Barajas, Peer Health Edu
cator at the LGBCC, spoke of how a
permanent director would lend sta
bility to the center.
"[The center] will be a lot

stronger, a lot more unified, with a
leader to look to during a time of cri
sis, or even when things are going
well," he said. "It will be nice to have
someone there 40 hours a week."
Graves has said previously that
he hopes to name a new director for
the LGBCC by the end of the acad
emic year.
