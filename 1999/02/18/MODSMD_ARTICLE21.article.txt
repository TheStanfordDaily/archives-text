# Campus viewpoint
## University cannot tolerate hate crimes 
###

ABOUT a WEEK ago, I met with
Stanford's student tour guides to
update them on aspects of Stanford
lite to share with prospective students and
their parents. As is common at these presen
tations, I raved endlessly about the special
qualities of academic and student life here on
the Farm. 1 often use the term "uniquely
Stanford" when 1 talk about the exceptional
academic opportunities and resources, tradi
tions and values that in my view are Stanford
hallmarks.
As dean of students and a Resident Fel
low in Junipero, an all-frosh house, I am able
to immerse myself among the best and
brightest students, faculty, staff and alumni in
this very special place we call Stanford.
However, there are other aspects of cam
pus life that I become involved with as Dean
of Students that I can't rave about, and in
fact, I get upset about.
Unbeknownst to many, acts of intoler
ance take place on the Stanford campus on a
seemingly regular basis.
Acts of intolerance can be viewed as any
actions that disparage in a harmful way any
individual or group on the basis of sex, race.

age, color, disability, economic background,
sexual orientation or national and ethnic ori
gin, among other factors.
While Stanford for the most part is gener
ally a safe campus, it is not insulated from
acts of intolerance, which oftentimes are
crime-related.
Since October, I have been made aware
of seven different incidents of intolerance on
campus.
Some of these incidents resulted in Stan
ford students being physically accosted or
assaulted: others involved threatening and
harassing correspondence and behavior
toward students. Others involved writing
racist graffiti on public buildings and student
residences.
Moreover, it should be noted that acts of
intolerance are not a new phenomenon at
Stanford. The University has experienced a
number of disruptive acts of intolerance over
the past decade.
Some of these acts have received signifi
cant media attention. Examples include the
homophobic graffiti in the Bollards Eating
Club in 1997, racist graffiti in the Asian
American Activities Center in 1996 and van

dalism of the Segal Gay Liberation statue in
1995.
Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of
incidents tend to take place far removed
from the media spotlight. It is for this reason
that 1 believe the University community will
benefit from my periodic reporting on acts of
intolerance on campus, in addition to sharing
the progress we continue to make in both
preventing and responding to these harmful
acts.
It is important to know that the Universi
ty reacts quickly and decisively on all report
ed acts of intolerance.
A variety of agencies on campus —
including Stanford Police, residence deans,
Cowell Student Health Services, the dean of
students' office, the dean of religious life's
office, community center directors and oth
ers— mobilize quickly to provide support
and comfort to the injured individual or
group. They next conduct an investigation
into the facts of the reported incident and
then hold responsible individuals account
able for their actions.
In the past year alone we have worked
hard to improve and refine the University's

overall response to acts of intolerance by
establishing a campus coordinating commit
tee and improving communications among
staff and with students.
As we strive to respond to and prevent
acts of intolerance on campus we are guided
by the values, principles and beliefs of this
institution.
In an amendment to the Founding Grant,
Jane Stanford declared that her and her hus
band's "moving spirit" for founding the Uni
versity was their "love of humanity and a
desire to render the greatest possible service
to mankind."
She went on to add that "the University
was accordingly designed for the betterment
of mankind morally, spiritually, intellectual
ly, physically and materially." In essence, the
Stanfords wanted to empower students to
make the world a better place in which to live
when they left the Farm.
The process of preparing students to
assume positions of leadership and influence
in the world is articulated in part by the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard, established
by David Starr Jordan, the University's first
president, in 1896. It states: "Students at

Stanford are expected to show both within
and without the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded of good citi
zens. Failure to do this will be sufficient cause
for removal from the University."
Within this context, I ask each member of
the Stanford community to do his or her part
in preventing and addressing acts of intoler
ance on campus. Only when all of us adhere
to University values, principles of good citi
zenship and expressions of civility will we be
able to make a difference.
While education certainly needs to be a
key component of this "call to civility," I
believe many of us can already distinguish
right from wrong, good from bad.
Last year's commencement speaker, Ted
Koppel, summed it up simply in his address
"Aspire to Decency; Practice Civility," with
the following charge to the graduates:
" There's no mystery here. You know what to
do. Now go out and do it!"
