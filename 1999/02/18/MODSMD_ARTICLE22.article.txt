## Divers add depth to swim team Card kills boards 
### Chad Morse Contributing writer 
In an extended stroll around the
Stanford campus, a diligent explorer
might chance upon some of the enig
matic sports that teem in the college
mysterious underworld of college
athletes.
Here in this nether-realm of low
profile sports one might come across
the fascinating phenomenon of
women's collegiate diving. For bet
ter or worse, college diving is not an
independent sport. Rather, it has
been fused in a sort of clunky sym
biosis with swimming, its aquatic
brethren.
In a standard swimming and div
ing dual meet of 16 events, there are
14 swimming and just two diving
competitions. This rather lopsided
7:1 ratio leaves many diving pro
grams stunted in the shadow of the
higher-priority swim programs. The
Stanford women's diving team, how
ever, has found itself a comfortable
niche within this larger entity and
flourished.
During last weekend's dual-meet
with California, the Cardinal divers
fully exploited their fractional influ
ence on the meet's outcome. Stan
ford ended up winning the meet by
an arm stroke, 153-145.
The Cal meet reminded the col
lege swimming scene that a meet can
very well be determined by a stellar
diving performance ... or a lacklus
ter one. for that matter.
Under the tutelage of veteran
head coach Rick Schavone, Cardinal
diving teams have been among the
top squads in the country since the
Carter administration. Schavone has

racked up enough awards and hon
ors to fill a page of print. He's proven
he's a darn good coach.
Coincidentally, Schavone hap
pens to coach a darn good team.
They are a cheerful group of
seven gals who talk like sisters and
have a tendency to finish one anoth
ers' sentences. On Tuesday night,
they graciously passed an hour of
their time explaining the nuances of
their trade to an ignorant reporter
who was wasn't thoroughly knowl
edgeable of such diver lingo as "DD"
— degree of difficulty. By all out
ward appearances, they love their
team, their school and their relative
ly humble position within the vast
world of college sports.
"Diving is such a small sport, it's
great to be part of a larger team," of
fered sophomore Erin Sones in ref
erence to her sport's relationship
with swimming. At a towering five
feet, seven inches, Sones is the diving
team's best answer to basketball cen
ter Tim Young.
Sones and her teammates realize
they are part of something special at
Stanford. With NCAA Champi
onship rings and Sears Cup honors,
they are proud to be part of such an
academic and athletic powerhouse.
Diving at Stanford "is a great op
portunity to get together with some
of the best athletes in the country,"
said sophomore Shawn Sinesky, elic
iting a chorus of nods and vocal affir
mations from her teammates.
"Being involved with such a great
program and competing at such a
high level is an amazing thing."
The diving ladies admit, however.
that their sport s role as an ap
pendage to the swim team can lead to

a sort of identity crisis.
"Sometimes people will ask, 'So,
how's your swimming going?"'
sophomore Kim Powers conceded
with a laugh. The fact that no one
seems to know that she's one of the

nation's top divers doesn't even seem
to bother her.
Powers, like many of her team
mates, is a former gymnast who was
bitten by the diving bug. Most mem
bers of Stanford's diving squad
were high school converts, recruit
ed by swim coaches eager to put the
girls' athletic talent where it could
benefit the team the most — on the
boards.
Carissa Zenorini, one of three se
niors on the team, has diving roots
that stretch back a bit further.
"I was a member of a town swim
club and the coach was also a college
diving coach," Zenorini recalled.
The next question put to her was,
"How would you like to dive?" She
was eight at the time and hasn't
looked back since.
For Zenorini and her senior team
mates, this season marks the possible
end of three long and illustrious ca
reers. Life beyond diving is a reality
that seniors Kari Kokka, Tricia Tem
pio and Zenorini are unsure they are
ready to face.
"Life will be really different," said
Kokka. "I'm so into the season right
now, I'm trying not to think about
what's next."
Freshman Alexis Sowa is the only
new fish on the team. Celebrating her
17th birthday next week, this talent
ed prodigy has been quick to find her
place in this close-nit squad.
"I'm extremely happy with my sit
uation right now," Sowa said. "I have
the sophomores to support me after
just having gone through freshman
year themselves. And at the same
time, I can turn to the seniors and
learn from all their experience."
This remarkable chemistry be
tween experience and youth will con
tinue to guide the women's diving
team throughout the postseason.
With just a week of practice left be
fore the Pacific 10 Championships in
Federal Way, Wash., the opportunity
to witness the talented team in its
home environment has become
scarce.
In the coming week, the diligent
Stanford explorer who finds his way
to deGuerre Pool may be fortunate
enough to witness a fascinating side
of the college sport's underworld. He
may not see any of the big names of
the sporting kingdom, but he would
see seven talented women work their
unique magic in a way he wouldn't
believe.
