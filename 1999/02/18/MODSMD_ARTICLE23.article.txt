# Stanford looks to continue streak
## 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
Going into Pacific 10 Confer
ence play with a 4-7 record, Stan
ford's place among the elite of col
lege basketball looked to be in seri

ous question. The Cardinal (14-9,
10-2 Pacific 10 Conference) has
never given up, though, and is now
in serious contention for at least a
share of the Pac-10 title.
Stanford hopes to continue its
seven-game win streak as it faces

Washington (11-11, 7-6) tonight
and Washington State (10-12, 4-9)
on Saturday at Maples Pavilion.
Last weekend's defeat of
UCLA has given this young Cardi
nal team a confidenee that was
lacking in its earlier play, and a
sense of the Stanford tradition —
one that has won nine Pac-10 titles
in 10 years — has become evident
to all.

cific 10 Conference) at Washington
(11-11,7-6).

"There's no doubt that they feel
both the pressure and the burden
of the tradition of Stanford basket
ball, and at the same time I think it
gives them a lot of confidence as
well," said associate coach Amy
Tucker. "When you walk into a
place with Stanford on your jersey,
I think it gives you a lot of confi
dence, but it also means that other
teams are always going to be pre
pared and bring their A-games
against you."
Washington will be sure to do
the same, as four of its starters are
seniors who have never beaten the
Cardinal. After the loss to Stanford
in Seattle earlier this season, Husky
forward Amber Hall and guard
Jamie Redd left the floor in tears,
and both vowed in post-game inter
views to beat the Cardinal at
Maples. Redd and Hall have been
consistent leaders throughout the
season, with Hall averaging a dou
ble-double (14.1 points, 10.7 re
bounds) per game.
"If we let them do what they do
well, we're going to be in trouble,"
Tucker said. "When we played

them up there, we used almost ex
elusively a zone in the second half
and they shot very poorly. We are
intent on taking away their
strengths individually."
Hall will be well challenged in
side by freshmen forwards Bethany
Donaphin. Enjoli Izidor and Lind
sey Yamasaki. All have improved
during the Pac-10 season, and as
exhibited with UCLA, they may be
young, but they can be counted on
down the stretch.
While the Stanford freshmen
have proven their abilities recently,
the'oldest player on the team. lonic
senior Regan Freuen. has shown
that she can face down all that her
opponents throw at her. Freuep
was named Pac-10 Player of thte
Week after her 34-point perfor
mance against UCLA and her
game-winning shot at USC. She is
the only Stanford player to receive
the honor this year, and her 34
points puts her 11th on Stanford's
all-time single-game output. I
"It was a really exciting week
end for our team and I think it wijs
a good step in the right direction fdr
us," Freuen said. "1 was just happv
I was able to have a good weekend
and contribute to our team's sue-
I
cess. That's just one of the perks
that comes along when the team
does well."
Against Washington Freuen
will need to keep up her impressive
play, especially for the Cardinal is
to position itself for the postseasofi
tournament. If Stanford is able tjo
sweep the Washington schools, it is
almost guaranteed its first appeaf
ance in the top 25 in over twt>
months, putting it back on the road
toward being among the elite of
women's hoops.
