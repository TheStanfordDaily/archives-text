# Polo gets Rainbow gold
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
Yesterday, the No. 3 Stanford
women's water polo team (6-1. 2-0)
defeated No. 6 Hawaii K-4 in a
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
match.
"We came out ready to play and
we played the way we wanted to,"
said sophomore Hilary Gallogly,
who scored once for the Cardinal.
"We were tired yesterday, but we
came out strong today."
The Cardinal squad has good
reason to be worn out.
After its third-place finish at last
weekend's UC-San Diego tourna
ment, the Cardinal squad had just
one day to rest and one day to prac
tice before facing the Rainbow
Wahine (6-5,0-1).
"We were still tired from the
weekend," said Stanford head
coach John Tanner. "Hut we had a
great first quarter."

Stanford was able to jump ahead
early with a 4-0 lead in that quarter
as Gallogly and sophomores Dani
Bell. Kris Koblik and Kelly Shouey
all scored. Stanford's play was sharp
across the board in what Tanner de
scribed as one of the team's best
quarters this season.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Yesterday: No. 3 Stanford (6-1,2-
0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) K. No. 6 Hawaii (6-5,0-1) 4.

"We played the kind of polo we
want to be playing now," Gallogly
said.
Leading the Cardinal defense
was Stanford's senior goalie
Heather C'rary, who collected 10
saves in the match and was able to
keep the Wahine offense in check,
allowing just one goal in the first
half.
"Heather played really good in
the goal," Tanner said. "She kept

them from getting closer."
After the first quarter, the Cardi
nal suffered a few defensive lapses.
Then, in the third quarter. Hawaii's
Katie Hill scored twice to close
Stanford's lead to 7-3. Hut the Car
dinal defense stepped it up and shut
down the Wahine attack.
"The first quarter was just really
good," Tanner said. "We really
looked together and intense — all
10 people who played contributed.
But our second quarter was really
lethargic. We had some good
chances, but we didn't pass the ball
well."
Although Stanford didn't con
vert all of its scoring opportunities,
the Cardinal defense was solid.
Stanford's two-meter defenders, se
nior Nicole Glazer and sophomore
Anne-Marie Keenan, were espe
cially effective against Hawaii's
hole-sets.


Sophomore Danl Bell contributed to the women's water polo team's incredible start by scoring one of
four first-half goals.
