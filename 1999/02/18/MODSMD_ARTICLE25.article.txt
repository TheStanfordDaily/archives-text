# Pitchers pull through against Sacramento State
## Borchard leaves Card on top 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Joe Borchard's third home run
in three games was all No. 5 Stan
ford (8-3) needed last night as the
Cardinal made quick work of
Sacramento State, 8-1.
The sophomore right fielder's
three-run home run to left field in
the bottom of the first inning was
more than enough support for an
effective trio of Stanford pitchers.
Freshmen Mike Wodnicki and Dan
Rich combined with senior Tonv
Cogan to hold Sacramento State
(2-7) to only one run on three hits.
Borchard started off the season
slowly. However, in the last four
games, he is 6 for 12 with three
home runs, seven RBIs and five
walks.
"I feel a lot better at the plate,"
he said. Assistant Coach Dean
Stotz "made a few adjustments
with me and they really paid off the
last few days."
Borchard's recent breakout is
representative of an offensive out
burst throughout the lineup.
The first few games, the Cardi
nal relied on the consistent hitting
of senior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang and junior center
fielder Edmund Muth. Lately,
those two have continued their hot
hitting while other players, such as
Borchard. junior catcher Damien
Alvarado and junior second base
man Jeff Riz/o, have begun to pro
duce.
"When we weren't hitting, we
really had to bear down and find a
way lo get runs across the plate."
Ri/.zo said. "Now that we're hit
ting. it's all coming together."
That's the first time someone
could say that about the Cardinal
all year.
Early on. the hitting and pitch
ing were both inconsistent. In the
Cardinal's 8-0 loss to Cal State-
Fullerton, both were nonexistent.
Then, when the pitching picked up,
most of the hitting stayed behind.
Finally, in the last two games —
yesterday's victory and Monday's
7-1 win at Santa Clara — all facets
of Stanford's game have been
working.

Wodnicki, who made his first
collegiate start, went five scoreless
innings, striking out three and al
lowing only two hits and two walks.

The right-hander has only

from 4.50 to 1,2S.
Rich (()-(). ().()() ERA), making
his second appearance on the year
and first since Fresno State,
pitched efficiently, allowing only a
walk in two innings of work.
Cogan (0-0. 1.20 ERA), who has
developed into the team's sure-fire
closer, was again on the mark. Al

though he allowed a run in the
ninth inning, the left-hander gave
the Hornets little hope for a comq
back. ,
"You feel good about the gartie
when you piteh well and you psy
good defense," said head coa;«h
Mark Marquess. "Lately, we ye

The one real concern for the
71
Cardinal now is the hitting of junior
first baseman John Gall. Gall, who
is Stanford's all-time leading career
batter, has struggled at the plate
early, hitting only .227.
However, Marquess said he js
not concerned with Gall and know.s
he will eventually break out of his
slump.
"What I'm more concerned
about is how lie's swinging the
bat." he said. "He's not getting a lot
of hits, but he's hitting the ball hard
