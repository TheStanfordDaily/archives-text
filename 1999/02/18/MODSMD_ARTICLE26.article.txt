# Women's track gambles for win
## 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
A gambler has to risk losing in
order for a big payoff. While Stan
ford head coach Vin Lananna may
not exactly be the gambling type,
he knows that playing it safe
doesn't always have the best long
term outcome.
That's why when his women's
track team heads to the casino
town of Reno, Nev. on Friday for
the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation Indoor Championships, there
will be some athletes who will not
be competing in their traditional
events.
"I really don't care about the
score or even the place," Lananna
said. "What were trying to do is de
velop a championship atmosphere
and attitude. Our objective for this
weekend will be to use the Moun
tain Pacific as an example for
championship meets."

"If we put everybody in their
right events and tried to maximize
our points, we could score a lot of
points, hut we're not doing that.
We're putting people in events that
make sense for them at this point in
their training."

■ Tomorrow-Sunday: Stanford at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Indoor Championships, Reno,
Nev.

For the throwers, sprinters,
jumpers and hurdlers, that proba
bly won't mean much in terms of
changes. Defending champion
Melissa Feinstein in the pole vault
and 1997 champion Cassie Romuld
in the shot put will compete in their
respective events.
The changes will be most recog
nizable in the distance events. Na
tional qualifiers Julia Stamps, Sally
Cilynn and Courtney Adams will

run a different event than they plan
to focus on at the NCAAs on
March 5 and 6. Stamps will try to
repeat her victory in the mile last
year, while Adams will attempt the
S,(KH) meters for the first time.
Despite Lananna's shifting of
events and outlook toward the
meet, the Cardinal has a solid
chance of winning the team-scored
competition. Standing in the way of
its third straight championship will
be Washington State and UCLA.
To a large degree, the Cardinal's
chances rely upon the strategies
that other coaches employ. Like
Lananna, many West Coast coach
es treat the indoor season as an ex
tension of the outdoor.
In addition to the incentive of a
team title, the meet will likely be
long jumper Tara Oettinger's and
high jumper Tracye Lawyer's last
chance to qualify for the national
meet.
And qualifying is no gamble.
