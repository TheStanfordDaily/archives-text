Stanford's men will get their first
taste of championship-style competi

travels to Reno, Nev., to compete in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Indoor Championships.

MEW'S TRACK
■ Tomorrow-Sunday: Stanford at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Indoor Championships, Reno,
Nev.

Though the meet does not have
far-reaching implications for the Car
dinal, head coach Vin Lananna ex
pects to use the meet as a sort of
"dress rehearsal" for upcoming
championship competitions, includ
ing the March 5 and 6 NCAA indoor
meet.

" We are trying to develop a cham
pionship atmosphere and attitude,"
Lananna said. "Our objective for this
weekend will be to use the Mountain
Pacific meet as an example of how to
prepare for championship meets."
Despite the downplay, the meet
should feature some top-quality
competition as most of the squads
from the Pacific 10 and Big West
Conferences will be represented.
Teams to look out for will include
Arizona, Washington State, Utah
State and UCLA.
Stanford will send 26 men into the
fray, and while Lananna plans to
have the field athletes focus on their
keystone events, many of the dis
tance runners will have an opportuni
ty to step down a distance and com
pete in quicker races.
Brad Hauser will compete in the
mile run, while brother Brent will
participate in the 3,(XX) meters. Both

are entered in the S,(KX) meters as
well. Miler Michael Stember will gut
out the N(X)-meter run, and Jonathon
Riley will race the 3.(KX) meters.
Adam Connolly will compete in
the weight throw, Toby Stevenson
will pole vault for the Cardinal and
Michael Ponikvar will try to continue
his high jump hot streak.
The meet will also serve as a qual
ifying opportunity for those athletes
who have not yet posted an NCAA
automatic or provisional mark.
Reno lies at an altitude of 4,5(X)
feet, so Lananna does not see an
abundance of distance qualifiers in
the weekend ahead even with the al
lowed altitude time conversions.
However, he expects Reno to be an
excellent venue for the throwers and
jumpers to post fine marks.
Athletes who do not post quali
fiers at Reno will have one week be
fore the national meet to do so.
