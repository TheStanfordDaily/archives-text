■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (20-5,10-
2 Pacific 10 Conference) at Wash
ington (15-8,8-5).

Arizona sits only a game behind
in the Pac-10 standings, and the
Wildcats have another shot at the
Cardinal — and the conference
crown — when they visit Maples
Pavilion next week.
But even more pressing is Wash
ington (15-8,8-5), which sits two and
a half games back but has a chance to
knock a full game off of that discrep
ancy when it hosts the Cardinal
tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Hec Edmund
son Pavilion.
Things weren't supposed to be
like this. This year the entire Pac-10
was supposed to be seeing Cardinal
as Stanford finally claimed that elu
sive Pac-10 trophy. But Stanford has
seldom done things the easy way .
The Cardinal has trailed at half
time for seven straight games. It held
off an offensively explosive UCLA
team only to let USC, which at the
time was drudging along the Pac
l()'s sewer, steal a game at Maples.
Now two of Stanford's more
prominent preseason goals — a
league championship and a high
seed in the West Regional of the
NCAA Tournament — are in seri
ous jeopardy.
Of course, Washington's presea
son vision has also taken a beating.
After the Huskies made it within
one rebound of the Elite Eight last

year, expectations were high tor a
shot at the conference crown and
perhaps even a run into the Final
Four.
After a 4-0 start, Washington
dropped six of its next nine games,
including slip-ups against supposed
pushovers Boise State and Gonzaga
and losses in its first three confer
ence games.
Head coach Bob Bender has
righted the ship again, but the dam
age done means Washington has lost
some of the preseason luster it had.
Now the two teams sit at the
crossroads. Stanford needs the win
to keep the Wildcats at a safe (for
now) distance. A Husky upset
would make quite an impression
when the NCAA selection commit

tee seeds teams for the tournament.
But perhaps the most intriguing
angle will be the matchup in the
paint. Cardinal center Tim Young
and Husky big man Todd MacCul
loch have traditionally heen
watched closely when they go head
to-head, and with this possibly being
their final contest, the scrutiny will
be even greater.
In the last meeting between the
teams, MacCulloch (team-leading
19.1 points and 11.5 rebounds per
game) forced Young into foul trou
ble and won the stat war with a dou
ble-double, but the Cardinal got the
67-60 win.
Young was much more effective
against MacCulloch last year as the
Cardinal swept its series with Wash

ington. Young's play was especially
key in the trip to Seattle as Stanford
escaped with a 76-74 win on a Kris
Weems three-pointer.
The Huskies also have off-guard

Donald Watts, who has overcome
early-season injuries to return to form
as one of the conference's more pro
lific scorers. Though estimated to be
running at 90 percent, he has brought
his scoring average up to 12.3 points
per game. Fellow swingman Deon
Luton chips in 14.9 points per game
for a potent backcourt combination.
