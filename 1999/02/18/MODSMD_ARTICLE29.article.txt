# Ultimate, polo win

### Joey Elger 
Polo: Once again, the weather
played havoc on the men's and
women's horse polo teams in their
drive toward the Regionals.
On Feb. 6. the men's match with
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo was can
celed completely, and the women
were restricted to just two "chuck
ers," or quarters, of play.
The Cardinal, despite con
fronting soggy weather conditions,
managed to come together and pull
out a victory against the visiting
squad from Cal-Poly.

CLUB SPORTS

Led by Alison Dawson's three
goals, the Cardinal posted a 4-1 vic
tory. Andrea Avtjoglou also con
tributed one goal to the Cardinal's
cause.
The win puts the Cardinal
women's record at 6-0, good
enough for first place in the West
ern Regional. Because of the first
place finish, the Cardinal have
earned a first-round bye in the up
coming Regional in Rancho Muri
etta, Calif.
"We played well. The ball
moved slowly and the conditions
were not good, but we definitely
outplayed them," Moses said.
The Cardinal men have a record
of 3-3 going into Regionals and will
face old nemesis Oregon State in
the first round.
In two tries this year, the Cardi
nal has yet to defeat the Beavers.
However, it should be a tightly con
tested match, as the last Beaver vic
tory came by just one goal.
The West Regional will be held
from Feb. 25-28. The Cardinal men
open play on Friday, while the
women face a yet-to-be-determined
foe on Saturday.
The winners of the tournament
advance to the National Tourna
ment, to be held in Burleson, Texas,
during the last weekend of March.
Men's Ultimate: The men's ulti
mate team completed a successful
weekend trip to San Diego for
Valentine's Day, coming away with
a second-place finish in one of the
year's biggest tournaments.

More than 30 teams competed in
the tournament, and Stanford fell to
just one, three-time national cham
pion UC-Santa Barbara.
The Stanford men's ultimate B
team followed the good example set
by the highly ranked A-team.
"We played well," said B-team
captain Jeremy Brown. "Although
there is room for improvement, we
showed potential. We're still really
young."
Next on the itinerary for the Car
dinal squad is the Stanford Invita
tional tournament it hosts in mid-
March. Twenty-plus teams will
compete with the Cardinal for the
tournament title.
Men's Lacrosse: The men's
lacrosse team suffered its first loss of
the year in a weekend trip to South
ern California.
The men suffered a 12-9 setback
at UC-Santa Barbara. However,
they bounced back to defeat Cal
Poly-SLO 13-12 in overtime to sal
vage a split on the weekend trip.
The offensive story of the week
end was the goal-scoring of captain
Benton Williams, who tallied six
goals in the victory over Cal Poly.
"It was just an incredible individ
ual performance," said sophomore
Paul Koh.
Defensively, the Cardinal was
expected to struggle, as it was forced
to play without one of its defensive
leaders, sophomore Stan Hsu, who
was out with an injury. That wasn't
the case though, as the defense hung
tough in both contests.
"The defense [as a whole] really
stepped up for the loss of Stan. They
played solid in both games," Koh
said.
The victory over Cal Poly pushes
Stanford's record to 6-1 heading
into the bulk of the all-important
conference season.
That season, which began last
weekend with the match against
Santa Barbara, heats up this week
end when the Cardinal squares off
at home with Sonoma State on Sat
urday at 1 p.m.
"This game is huge," Koh said.
"We need people to come out and
support us. The conference race will
be really tight, so every victory is
huge."
