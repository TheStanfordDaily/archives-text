A group of about 4() students rep
resenting ethnic student organiza
tions and women's groups met last
night in response to recent Universi
ty tenure decisions.
Sophomore and event organizer
Tim Ly said that his purpose in call
ing the meeting was "to get students
together and talk about tenure."
"I think [those at the meeting] re
ally want more people to know about

issues," he said.
Nathan Watanabe, who was at the
meeting, said it was held in order to
"get everyone organized."
"Before we get going we want to
get everyone on the same page."
Watanabe said that before the
group's next meeting, written infor
mation would be distributed to mem
bers about tenure issues.
"We will all be more informed at
the next meeting," he said. Watan-

A sign posted in White Plaza on Tuesday protests the recent deci
sion to deny tenure to Asst. English Prof. Robert Warrior, one of only
three Native-American professors at Stanford.
Abe agreed that no plans would come
as a result of the meeting.
Mark Sanders, who attended the
meeting and is president of the
NAACP at Stanford, said that the
issue of faculty diversity is important
to his organization.
"Minority students in different
departments want advisors and pro
fessors whom they can look up to
and relate to," Sanders said, adding
that an important aspect of the meet
ing was to show solidarity between
different student organizations.
"We are working together with
other groups on campus, this is not
just a black student, native American
student or female student issue," said
Sanders.
