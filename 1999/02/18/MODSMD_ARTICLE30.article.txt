MEW'S TENNIS
■ Today-Sunday: No. 1 Stanford at
Washington for the Men's National
Indoor Team Championships.

The Cardinal received good
news Tuesday afternoon when No.
3 singles player Alex Kim was
cleared to travel. Kim has been suf
fering from a stress fracture in his
left shin, and was forced to sit out
last weekend's matches against
Northwestern and Rice. It is still
unclear how much he will play,
though.
"A lot depends on how [head
coach Dick] Gould wants to use
me," Kim said. "I may only play
doubles against Oklahoma to get
my stroke back. It also hinges on
how my shin feels when I test it
out."
Kim's questionable status has
not seemed to affect the players' at
titudes. They proved they are capa
ble of winning without him over the
weekend, and they actually tried to
use his injury as a positive motiva
tor.
"With Alex out, it forced the
guys below him to step up and raise
their level," said sophomore Scotty
Scott. "It gives us more confidence
to know we can perform at a higher
level when we need to."
With or without Kim, the Cardie
nal knows this will be its biggest tesi
of the season so far. Not only does
the tournament host the best teams
in the nation, it is also the first time
all season that these teams are at
full strength. Many of the teams
have foreigners who were not regis
tered to play during the fall season,
but are back to play for the winter
and spring.
"This will be our best chance be
fore the NCAAs to see what the top
teams are like at full strength,"
Gould said. "Inter-regional play is
always a good way to see where
your team stands."
Gould also mentioned that there
are several teams in the tournament
whom the Cardinal will not get a
chance to play later in the year. This
means that a loss to them is more
severe since the Cardinal will not
get an opportunity to atone for it.
Despite this danger, however,
the entire Cardinal squad seems to
be entering tonight's match against
Oklahoma with a confident, but not
arrogant, attitude.
"We are excited and confident
to go in there with our best lineup,"
said senior Ryan Wolters. "We
know it is a different kind of a year

than the last, though, so we can't af
ford to take anyone for granted. If
we play our kind of tennis we
should be all right."
Wolters said that he has been ex
tremely impressed by the way the
three younger Cardinal players
have handled themselves so far this
year. Freshman K.J. Hippensteel
and sophomores Scott and Ali
Ansari are all in their first seasons
in the starting lineup, and Wolters
believes they are getting better with
each match. This tournament will
provide their biggest test so far in a
pressure situation.
"There will be a lot going on
around us," Hippensteel said.
"Whether we're winning or losing,
we have to stay mentally in our own
match. Also, indoor courts are fast,
so we need to stay aggressive and
try to get on top early."
The Cardinal is not putting too
much pressure on itself, though, be
cause it knows that the team in
doors is only an indication of where
it needs to be in May.
"We have to compete hard every
match and have fun," said assistant
John Whitlinger. "This is a stepping
stone for our goal in May. Win or
lose, it will be a learning experi
ence, especially for the younger
guys."
