# Enrichment program allows Stanford students to teach high schoolers
## SHEP seeks to broaden learning 
### Anne Becker Contributing writer 
Recognizing that high school stu
dents should learn more than just al
gebra and American history, mem
bers of Stanford's Educational Stud
ies Program met last night to organize
their yearly high school enrichment
program.
The main goal of the Stanford
High School Enrichment Project is to
"allow Stanford students and profes
sionals in the area to teach their inter
ests to high school students," said the
group's vice-chair, senior Catherine
Chan.
SHEP is designed as an enrich
ment program for high school stu
dents from San Francisco to San Jose.
Students take three two-hour-long
classes each Saturday at Stanford for
six consecutive weeks beginning
April 17.
"We offer different subjects and
disciplines than students learn in high
school," Chan said. "Some of the

courses are non-academic and others
are deeper and in more detail than
high school courses would be."
Courses offered last year ranged
from "Digital Electronics and Chip
Design" to "Dance in Film: The
Movie Musical" to "From Plato to
Playboy: the Politics of Porno."
Teaching for SHEP is open to any
Stanford student or area professional
and is on a volunteer basis. Students
can also teach courses in pairs. Teach
ers submit their own ideas for courses
on topics of their choosing. They then
meet with members of the program's
board of directors and mentoring
groups of more experienced teachers
to work out any problems they have
with their courses.
"We really encourage every
prospective teacher to teach what
they enjoy," Chan said.
She also noted that teaching at
SHEP provides Stanford students in
terested in teaching with classroom
experience. Students interested in
teaching for SHEP must submit

course proposals by tomorrow.
Response from teachers in previ
ous years was positive.
"Teaching for SHEP was very in
formative," said senior Swaroop
Mishra, who has taught classes in
public policy, genetics and biotech
nology. "I learned a lot about teach
ing. It's one thing to think about it, but
it's a new experience to get in front of
a class. It's rewarding to see students
learn something new or figure some
thing out. and it's nice that there's no
set curriculum."
The Educational Studies Pro
gram's other main project is Splash, a
one-day series of similar workshops
and seminars for high school stu
dents. Splash, held this year Jan. 30,
was intended to "give students a taste
of courses from different fields to fig
ure out interests before taking the
longer courses at SHEP," Chan said.
Members of Educational Studies
Program were pleased with the
growth of the Splash program, noting
a turn-out of 432 high school students

as opposed to the 150 students that at
tended the program two years ago.
"Splash is a young program, but
it's growing really fast," said Volkan
Rodoplu, a graduate student in elec
trieal engineering and corporate lia
son for the group. "The idea is to
make learning and teaching a lot of
fun."
Courses taught at this year's
Splash included "Researching on the
Internet, Balloon Twisting for Begin
ners." "101 Excuses for Not Doing
Your Homework" and "60 Minutes
of Calculus in its Awesome Entirety."
Students pay a small fee for at
tending Splash and SHEP, but Chan
noted that the program is "liberal in
granting financial aid."
Group members are currently vis
iting area high schools to students to
attend SHEP in April.
"Recruitingstudents is the hardest
thing to do," Chan said. "We want to
make Splash and SHEP more acces
sible to students from more need
based backgrounds."
