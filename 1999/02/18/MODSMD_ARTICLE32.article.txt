# Magazine founder asks for greater scrutiny of media
## 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
In the 11th annual Knight Lec
ture in Cubberly Auditorium last
night, Stephen Brill, founder and
editor of the magazine Brill's Con
tent addressed the question, "Can
the press fix itself?"
The main theme of Brill's lec
ture was that journalists should not
separate people whom they portray
into categories of "villain and
hero."
He stressed that journalists
should not go out looking for scan
dal and consider a story null if no
wrongdoing is present.
He gave as an example a story in
his magazine that examined
whether Entertainment Weekly, a
magazine owned by Time Warner,
used more Warner Brothers
movies as cover stories than the law
of averages would suggest. The re
porter that was covering the story
found that Warner Brothers
movies were covered less often
then their market share would indi
cate.
"The young reporter who was
covering the story came in and said,
'There's nothing there; there's no
scandal,' and I said, 'Well that's in
teresting. That's a story.' I had her
write it and we gave it as much
space as we would have otherwise."
Brill's magazine, the first issue
of which appeared last August, bills
itself as the "independent voice of
the information age" and a "new
magazine to monitor the media."
He posed his magazine as a model
that all information-age journalists
should follow in all media: elec
tronic, print and television.
The New York Times said of his

magazine, "Mr. Brill fashioned not
so much a bombshell as an enor
mous cream pie smeared in the face
of the Washington press corps."
Aside from his current maga
zine, which has a circulation of
200,(XX), Brill founded cable net
work Court TV and American Law
Magazine. He received undergrad
uate and law degrees from Yale

University and, while in law school,
wrote for New York magazine and
Esquire.
As further answers to the quest,
tion, "can the press fix itself," he of-'
fered some reasons that he sees it as
"broken."
"The press has a huge amount o£
unaccountable power," he said.
"The first amendment allows it aU
most unlimited freedom."
Brill then moved on to address a
question that has arisen recently
due especially to the emergence of
electronic media: what is publish
ing? :
"What if you hear a rumor and;
you e-mail it to 300 people? What if
you post it on AOL? Is that pub
lishing? The boundaries have
changed," Brill said. »
