# Volleyball takes on familiar challenge
## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
There's one aspect missing from
the seventh-ranked Stanford men's
volleyball team's preparation for
tonight's game against the No. 12
Loyola Marymount Lions (2-5, 1-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion):
The element of surprise.
The Cardinal (4-4, 3-4) and the
Lions have already competed twice
this season in one preseason
matchup and in an exhibition game.
Given this preparation, Stanford is
rather familiar with the playing cal
iber and tendencies of the Lions.

at No. 12 Loyola Marymount (2-5,1-
4y

The Cardinal expects the usual
scenario from Loyola: a challenge.
It's not the norm for Stanford to
face an opponent three times in any
one season. In order to maximize its
preseason preparation, the Cardinal
competed in two matches against
the Lions before MPSF competition
kicked off on Jan. 23.
The stakes have gotten progres
sively higher in these matches.
The first game was a preseason
matchup in which Stanford cap
tured the win in a five-game, come
from- behind victory 7-15,10-15,15-
4, 15-13, 15-9. The following night,
the Cardinal attained a 15-10, 15-7.
15-4 victory. This game was an exhi
bition game which did not affect ei
ther team's record.
With two wins against Loyola
under its belt, one could think Stan
ford might overlook tonight's game.
Think again.
The stakes are even higher
tonight because this game counts to
wards each team's record in the
MPSF. When the MPSF Champi
onship Tournament begins in late
April, the top three teams in each di

vision as well as the two remaining
teams with the strongest conference
records will comprise the tourna
ment field.
"Last time we played LMU, they
were both really tough games," said
sophomore setter Brad Griffith.
"This time, we are bringing a differ
ent personnel."
The Cardinal started nine differ
ent players in the two games against
LMU earlier in the season. This
weekend, Stanford will use a differ
ent combination of starters.
"Last weekend, we changed our
starters and rotations," Griffith said.
"This weekend will be a good test of
how our new system works."
The Cardinal is coming off a
weekend in which the team earned
two wins, one of which was against a
ranked opponent.
"This weekend, we expect a step
up in our level of competition," said
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves.
LMU has shown improvement
from its performances earlier in the
season. Last weekend, the Lions de
feated USC, who upset Stanford
earlier in the season.
Even after the match against the
Lions, the Cardinal will not have
much time to relax this weekend.
The Cardinal takes on the second
ranked Pepperdine Waves (9-1,6-1)
Saturday at 7:30 at the Firestone
Fieldhouse.
Despite this formidable oppo
nent later in the weekend, Stanford
cannot overlook its first task at
hand.
"We can't go in thinking about
Pepperdine," Nieves said. "LMU
will give us everything we can han
dle."
The Waves recently had their
nine-game win streak broken in a
five-game loss to the Long Beach
State 49ers. During this game, the
Waves' leading attacker, Volleyball
Magazine's 1998 Player of the Year,
George Roumain. was unable to
play due to a hyperextended right
thumb. Roumain is expected to re
turn to action this weekend.
