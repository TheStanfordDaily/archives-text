# Women's Center hosts leadership conference
## Participants to meet local leaders 
### Sylvia Lin Contributing writer 
This year's women's leadership
conference, sponsored by the
Women's Coalition and the
Women's Center and hosted at El
liott Programming Center, will be
held tomorrow and Saturday. The
conference's theme is "Voices of
Creation: The Art of Women's Lead
ership."
For the past five years, the stu
dent-initiated Stanford Women's
Leadership Conference has provid
ed women with the opportunity to
meet Bay Area female leaders and to
seek the possibilities of leadership
within themselves.
"Our theme represents the com
ing-to-voice in coalition with other
women â€” finding the voice inside of
you to speak out," said senior Jenny
Assef, a co-coordinator for this year's
conference.
According to Assef, one of the
main focuses of this year's confer
ence is "to build and solidify a net
work of communication of women."
She hopes that this branching effort
will help women to foster the spirit of
unity that can be carried beyond this
weekend.
"This is a crucial time in Stanford
history on this campus for Stanford
women to find support for their fu
ture endeavors," she said.
Assef noted that this year's con
ference will differ from past confer
ences, since, for the first time, partic
ipants will be meeting in a large "re
treat-like" setting throughout the
conference, as opposed to dividing
into small groups. This new idea will

be implemented this year in hopes of
emphasizing the "network" appeal
of the conference.
The conference expects partici
pants from Stanford and nearby uni
versities, including UC-Berkeley,
UC-San Francisco, New College and
San Jose State.
Features of this year's conference
include workshops and activities that
plan to address cross-cultural and
non-defensive communication, as
well as issues of gender as they relate
to race, class and sexuality. Partici
pants will also have the opportunity
to have lunch and discussions with fe
male leaders from various Bay Area
universities.
"We hope that women will leave
the conference with a sense of and re
spect for their own forms of leader
ship that don't always necessarily
have to be traditional," said junior
Wallace Adelman, a co-coordinator
for the conference.
Victoria Rue, a feminist play
wright and theologian, as well as the
keynote speaker for the conference,
will open the program.
Other speakers include Merle
Woo, a local socialist activist and
poet, who will focus on political ac
tivism and women's leadership;
Sharon Ellison, author and commu
nications specialist; Fabienne
McPhail, director of the Stanford
Women's Center; and Rose Frances,
Dean of Women's Spirituality at
New College in San Francisco.
Several Stanford students and or
ganizations will be performing at this
year's conference, including Jam
Pac'd and the Women's Perfor
mance Collective.
