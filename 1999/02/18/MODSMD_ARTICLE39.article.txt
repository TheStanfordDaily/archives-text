## (LONG LIVE ‘KILLING MY LOBSTER') SF comedy troupe explodes 
### 
/'Z/*'™ soldiers trudge across a battlefield, gunshots vol
laying through the cool night air. One soldier falls,
certain to die. He has a few finals words for friends
and relatives, and then one final request: "Kill me, Tommy ...
I'm in pain." An uncomfortable pause follows, for this is the
worst task a soldier can ever face. The request continues: "I want
you to set my body on fire ... and then cook your dinner on
me." And so on, with increasingly elaborate desires for mutila
tion rituals.
What began as a tense but moment of World War II
drama, a veritable scene from "Saving Private Ryan," becomes a
very '90s dissection of self-absorbed obsessions and fetishes.
Though their recipes vary, this is the essential method of the
wacky San Francisco comedy troupe, "Killing My Lobster," in
their current show, "Killing My Lobster Throws a Hissy!":
attacking pop culture, self-therapy and contemporary obses

sions with a blunt machete and making a casse
role out of the left-overs.

Like all great sketch comedy, "KML"
features

characters trapped in delusions fighting against the world. One
bit features a public defender who is convinced that her client is
guilty of being framed by his Evil Twin. And why is there no evi
dence of this Evil Twin? "No parent wants it on record that there
is an Evil Twin in the family."
Some of the best skits are absolutely random. One sketch
begins with an angst-y black-on-black man in rectangular
framed black glasses typing something on a typewriter called
"Treatise on Suffering." Then all hell breaks loose, with a little
Aryan girl dancing in, saying she wants "sunshine for breakfast."
The writer, "Uncle Franz," replies, "We will have suffering for
breakfast." Meanwhile, a running joke involving Karl Marx and
a baby dressed like a distressed '90s yuppie parent keeps popping
up. Both Marx and the girl mock Franz's latest story, which hap
pens to involve a man turning into a roach. Then another char
acter, "Coach Rockbottom" (a caricature of the tough-guy
scholastic sports coach, including hideous clinging polyester
shorts), enters and offers "Franzie" some comedy advice, adding
that the roach wasn't likely to be picked up by the networks, sug
gesting that instead a "wacky cousin roach visits for like a week."
As may be clear from my meandering description, the really
fun thing about the Franz sketch was the collision of personas,
particularly the Coach and Kafka. One thing that I would like to

have seen more of was dissection of "KML's" audience
i and cast, who were for the most part middle-class

urban types. After intermission, they had a battle
of white-trash hecklers they planted in the audi
ence, and it was a funny bit, with the mock
| heckler repeatedly shouting at the mock-sketch,
112 "Shit's not funny." The problem is that mocking

the trashier parts of American society is not
particularly daring; the audacity to insult your
audience and yourself is an imperative for a

fringe comedy troupe.
Still, "Killing My Lobster Throws a
Hissy!" works very well, with many of
j| the sketches offering the dark or ran
' dom quality that a middle-class

wannabe urban type on this campus
might want to seek out.
