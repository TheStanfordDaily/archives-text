## Student assistant will investigate responsible investing issues for trustees' advisory panel 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
The movement for socially responsible in
vestment on campus has achieved a victory
through the creation of a student position that
will focus on researching investment issues
that affect Stanford.
The student will do research on both issues
raised by the Stanford community; the posi
tion will also involve doing background re
search on shareholder activism with a particu
lar corporation or on a particular issue. The
student will directly assist the manager of in
vestment responsibility at the Stanford Man
agement Company and report to the Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibility.
The APIR, made up of faculty, staff, alum
ni and students, looks at company records on
social issues and makes recommendations to
the Board of Trustees Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility concerning which

companies Stanford should invest in. The
SCIR. which has no student members, makes
final policy decisions.
Senior Shubha Chakravarty, a member of
the APIR, emphasized that students have
been seeking this position for at least two
years. "The burden has always fallen on stu
dents to find the background info ... now. it
won't be their job to do all this background re
search."
The student research assistant is important
to the APIR as well, according to Chakravarty.
"We only get the side of who ever is presenting
to us... it's hard to decide, is this a good com
pany?"
"[We're] trying to develop more broad pol
icy guidelines so we don't have to look at every
proxy every time," Chakravarty continued.
She mentioned the targeting of four main
areas: human and labor rights, environmental
issues, diversity and corporate gov
ernance."
In 1996 student groups led by
then-ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson and Kelly Naylor, then a
senior, began to push for a "socially
responsible" endowment fund. This
would have allowed donors to ear
mark contributions for a separate
fund that invests in companies that
met certain criteria in terms of
human rights, labor, environmental
causes and other issues.
Trustee Roger Clay, who chairs
the Special Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility, wrote a letter
to the students explaining specific
reasons why the board had rejected
Thompson and Naylor's proposal.
The concerns included no evidence
that a socially responsible fund
would increase alumni giving, that
socially responsible funds have a
lower return rate over time and that
the new fund would politicize the
business of donating to the Universi
ty-
"The outright rejection of the
proposed fund really deflated a lot
of the energy that went into the cam

paign and was really pretty frustrat
ing," Donaghy said.
Sinee that disappointment Stu
dents for Environmental Action at
Stanford and other student groups
have shifted their priorities, accord
ing to Donaghy, focusing more on
specific corporations such as mining
company Freeport-McMo√üan Cop
per and Gold and allegations of
human and environmental rights
abuses in Indonesia.
However Stanford's endowment
remains the focus of much attention.
Sophomore Aarthi Belani, a stu
dent representative to the APIR.
presented both sides of the issue.
"Stanford is an apolitical institution
and does not take stances on issues,"
she said.
On the other hand, Belani contin
ued, "The students argued that by
not taking a stance, you're taking a
stance."
"We want the University to rec
ognize the role it plays in the global
economy, for good or ill," said Tim
Donaghy, a SEAS member. "If in
vestment in a corporation compro
mises the mission of the University,
we want divestment."
Stanford's endowment is sepa
rate from The Stanford Fund, which
is money raised for spending on un

dergraduate education.
The University's $4.7-billion en
dowment is managed by the Stan
ford Management Company, which
invests in several ways, including
corporate stock and real estate.
The company makes all day-to
day investment decisions, while two
smaller groups determine invest
ment policy, including whether
Stanford should introduce share
holder resolutions concerning social
issues.
The APIR is made up of faculty,
administration, staff and alumni and
has primary responsibility for re
viewing shareholder resolutions.
"We invite student input and con
cerns to the APIR," said Dickson,
"and we consider every proposal
very seriously."
The committee has four student
representatives, and has added a stu
dent research assistant to work
under the manager of investment re
sponsibility.
The APIR makes recommenda
tions to the SCIR, a subgroup of the
Board of Trustees. The SCIR votes
on each resolution.
Data compiled from 20 large en
dowments over the past 10 years
shows that Stanford produced the
greatest return with the least risk, as

discussed in the Stanford Manage
ment Company's annual report.
According to Linda Kimball,
Stanford Management Company's
manager of investment responsibili
ty, "The endowment was established
to meet the educational mission of
Stanford: to provide the best educa
tion to students so that students can
make their own choices."
Stanford has faced the issue of so
cially responsible investment on
many occasions, including the suc
cessful push to divest from South
Africa in the early 1980s and the
controversy surrounding the possi
bility that Taco Bell would open a
branch in Tresidder, in a spot that
was eventually occupied by Polio
Rey.
In 1996 several student groups
advocated boycotting Taco Bell and
other chains and products owned by
PepsiCo, which at that time had sig
nificant investments in Burma, a
country that has come under heavy
fire for its human rights record.
"Stanford's investments in cor
porations that prop up military dic
tatorships, pollute the communities
of indigenous peoples or sell ciga
rettes to teenagers represent real im
pacts upon the world," said Don
aghy.
