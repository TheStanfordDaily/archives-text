# BROKEBACK & THE CHICAGO UNDERGROUND DUO
## Live at the Capoeira Arts Café Sponsored by Beanbender's 
### 
the Bay Area's premier cre
(at»ve music collective, recently lost its
Berkeley concert space. Fortunately for us,
the group continues to sponsor and showcase fine
music from local, national and international avant
garde musicians. Last Saturday evening at the
Capoeira Arts Caf£, Beanbenders hosted a concert
featuring Doug McCombs and the Chicago
Underground Duo.
The recent fervor over post-rock has pushed the
genre into the vocabulary of mainstream — albeit
"sophisticated" — America. The group that has
received the most publicity is probably the Chicago
band Tortoise, whose sound is a melange of differ
ent styles, from jazz to electronica and rock.
Members of Tortoise have formed a myriad of spin
off bands, including Isotope 217, a funkier jazz out

fit that also includes members of the Chicago
Underground Orchestra.
Brokeback is Doug McCombs' solo project.
McCombs is a member of Tortoise, and the band's
influence was evident at the Beanbenders show.
Armed with an electric bass, a few looped samples
and an upright bass player, McCombs treated the
audience to 45 minutes of minimal, but very beau
tiful, music. Unhurried and deliberate, the set was
fixed upon single melodies. The addition of samples
and the live bass created sparse layers over
McCombs' instrument. He let his notes resonate
before going on, working on each as if it were a
composition in itself by giving every sound a char
acter: warbly, soft, abrupt or warm. All in all, his
sound was similar to Tortoise without the frills,
pared down to just the melody.
The Chicago Underground Duo features Rob
Mazurek, a trumpet player for Isotope 217, and

drummer Andy Taylor. Together they form an inter
esting ensemble. Their brand of free jazz borders on
experimental music, rather than the noisier, sax
dominated "skronk," combined with variations on
the "traditional" jazz sound. The greatest part about
their performance was the synchronicity of it all.
One of the two would begin, the other would follow
and soon the two sounds would diverge in a free
jazz manner, untU suddenly they were right on
again. Furthermore, they created some interesting
sounds using things like hand-held gongs and a
string of wooden beads.
Overall the music was perfectly suited to the sur
roundings. The Capoeira is an actual cafe, complete
with hot cider and ginger cookies. The crowd was
small and intimate that night, and as it was driz
zling* you could hear the raindrops hit the roof — a
nice compliment to the richness of the two bands.
