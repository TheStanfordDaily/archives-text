# SPARKLING 'GLASS' FAILS TO SHATTER
## 'The Glass Menagerie' at the Actors Theater of SF 
### 
112 /"Tennessee Williams' "The
C-Xf Glass Menagerie" is one of
only a handful of canonized
American plays from the 20th century.
Now, at the end of the century, accom
plished West Coast acting teacher Jean
Shelton is directing a faithful version
of "Menagerie" at the Actors Theatre
of San Francisco. This intimate, 99-
seat theater has built a strong reputa
tion in the local press, benefiting from
its connection to Shelton's acting
school.
"Menagerie" centers on a small,
struggling family in 1930s St. Louis.
The mother, Amanda, is the daughter
of a rich Southern planter. In her
youth she married a telephone man
who "fell in love with long distances,"
meaning he abandoned her and her
family years ago. Amanda's son, Tom,
works in a local warehouse to support
the family but dreams of an adventur
ous future as a writer. The daughter,
Laura, is a self-conscious shut-in with
a love for delicate glass animals, her
"glass menagerie."
Amanda rules the family, but her
own life is ruled by her tragic past.
Having fallen from the Southern aris
tocracy to the level of a poor, single
mother, Amanda's singular goal lies in
her children's happiness. She clings so
desperately to this dream that she can
not understand Tom's deep resent
ment of his factory job and Laura's
complete isolation from the social
world. This tense lack of communica

tion drives the play to its conclusion,
an unavoidable collision of bitterness,
disappointment and shattered illu
sions.
A classic ensemble piece, "The Glass
Menagerie" lives and dies by the
strength of its main actors, and in this
production, their performances are
solid. The strongest acting came from
Robert Corrick, who creates a very
human, sympathetic Tom, full of anger
and frustration but also capable of a
surprising tenderness. Rachel Klyce
plays Laura with all the hurt and awk
wardness appropriate to the role, even
if she seemed a little over-matched by
the other actors. Anne Macey gives
Amanda all the bluster, close-minded
ness and thinly-veiled arrogance of the
archetypal controlling mother, though
she does seem to lack Amanda's
unique mix of self-delusion and inner
desperation. Amanda is more than just
another bossy matriarch — she is an
abandoned historical relic, both in
denial and painfully aware of her fam
ily's complete inability to rise above
working poverty.
Ultimately, "The Glass Menagerie"
is a series of duets between its princi
pals. The performance soars in Tom's
scenes with his mother and sister.
Seeing Tom claw for freedom from a
mother who wants both his money
and his obedience is unavoidably pow
erful. The climax of the play is the
exchange between Laura and the semi
mythic Gentleman Caller, played with

appropriate simplicity by Dean
Shreiner. Although their candlelight
scene is indeed touching, his exit is
ambiguous. Laura does not seem to be
as crushed as she should be, and the
audience is left with the impression
that Laura may actually find a kernel
of self-confidence from the encounter.
Most of Williams' plays, including
"The Glass Menagerie," are known for
their utter despair, yet Shelton's pro
duction seems to end on a relatively
(for Williams) upbeat note. In her
"Director's Note," Shelton writes that
"Tennessee Williams is my favorite
author and 'Glass Menagerie' is my
favorite play.... Be kind to the Aman
da's of the world and forgive us our
transgressions." Has Shelton identified
too closely with the play's characters
and thus been unwilling to throw
them into the abyss necessary for the
play's climax?
"The Glass Menagerie" is in some
ways a clumsy play — the symbolic
link between the glass unicorn's horn
and Laura's physical and emotional
disability is often overdone. The true
power of "Menagerie" is its painfully
honest portrayal of American society's
untouchables and the price of illusion
in the face of tragedy. Jean Shelton's
"Menagerie" is a worthy production,
but also one which ducks the play's
most brutal issues.
