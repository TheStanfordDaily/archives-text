Sunday at the Edge in Palo Alto, co-sponsored by KZSU. Intermission had the opportunity to talk with lan, who actually spent some time here at Stanford.
IM: My dad was working at The Washington Post, he was there for 20 years. In 1974 he received a [Knight] fellowship and was able to go and take classes at Stanford for
about nine months. We lived in Escondido Village, in 140 C. I went to a school called Terman Junior High, my brother [Alec] went to Escondido Elementary, my sister went to
Gunn High. My entire life I lived here in Washington, I was born here, my parents live in the same house I was raised in. That's the only time I ever lived away from ashington,
and it was quite a strange experience.
INT: How old were you then? ... , . .. • ~,
IM: I was 12.1 turned 13 and [met my] first girlfriend. I think she's the daughter of a professor there. Where Gunn Senior High is, there used to be a really incredible motor
cycle / motorcross kind of track there that we used to ride our bikes on. We used to go canoeing at Lake Lagun[it]a. Do you know where the computer center is? In the student

union? That used to be a bowling alley. I used to ride my bike off the stairs at, well, it
used to be called "UGLY" [Meyer Library].

INT: Were there any lasting impressions of Stanford you took back to D.C., or was
it just a year out of your life?
IM: Well, I remember everything about it. It was really the only college that I ever
spent any time in. I never went to school myself, so I guess to some degree all universi
ties I've ever been to since then, or whenever I think about it, will be put through some
what of a Stanford filter. I think it's changed quite a bit since I was there, but I actually
think that universities have changed a lot in 30 years.
INT: In what way?
IM: My sense is that for a lot of universities, they're not so much places where peo
ple can fool with ideas, rather, it's more about how to get these ideas into line so that
they're actually commodifications. I feel like the universities across the board, instead
of a free space where people can play with ideas, it's been developed into training
grounds for jobs.
INT: A lot of universities cut programs because they're not economically feasible
and really focus on job placement.
IM: Which I find is discouraging. I mean, Jesus, you're gonna work the rest of your
life, do you really have to learn only about getting a job? Why can't we learn about other
things? I don't know, that's just the way I feel about it, but maybe I should go to college
and really know what I'm talking about.
[Laughter]
IM: Actually something that did really have a great affect on me at that school. I
enjoyed going to the Stanford football games and 1 think their team, I don't think was
a very good team. It's irrelevant whether they were good or not, I just liked going. It was
so crazy to go because it was just so alive, so wild and the crowd was so wild. What I
really loved about it, and I don't know if it's still this way, but the marching band was
so outrageous. I don't know if they still are or not.
INT: Yeah, actually they were banned from...
IM: The Rose Bowl?
INT: ... Notre Dame last year....
IM: Well I found that so inspiring. No one wore uniforms, they just wore costumes
and hats, and there was a guy that used to always dress up as a gorilla. I just thought it
was insane! Their music was bad-ass, too. I mean, I really took it away with me like, man
that is cool! I like it when people are unconventional. I find that refreshing. It gives me
hope.
INT: That's one of the founding things behind Fugazi....
IM: Well, I'd say it's one of the founding things as far as my involvement with punk
rock as much as Fugazi. From the very beginning, when I first got involved with punk
rock, I was in high school. I felt really discouraged because the horizon seemed incred
ibly bleak. Everyone was worried about, oh what am I going to do with the rest of my
life, and I'm like, god, what are you doing with your life now? That's what I want to
know. We're alive, live, don't worry about the future! I felt like I didn't know what I was

going to do. There was a radio station here called WGTB, which was Georgetown University's radio station. In 1979 that station was shut down, and there was a protest. That
night there was a concert, ostensibly a benefit concert to raise money to create a legal fund to try to get the station back. The Cramps played. It was a punk show. It was that
show that I realized, here it is. Here is what I was looking for, the place where conventions are being challenged and not just musical convention, but political convention, and
ideological convention and sexual convention, all of the conventions. There was something at that show flying in the face of everything. I appreciated that, not because I agreed
with all of those people. I don't necessarily agree with them, but because I agree with the idea that they have the right to exist, and people should think about it. It's not just to
take things for granted.
INT: My experience is that I've challenged conventions ideologically, politically and it all stems from when I experienced music for the first time [that] challenged me.
That challenge opened up more challenge musically, like the recognition of an aesthetic in noise....
IM: Right. Totally.
INT: And then, that breakdown of barriers in my mind where I organized things like, what's a good sound and what isn't. Then I started applying that to other aspects of
my life.
IM: I would say it was exactly the same for me. I totally don't apply it only to music. What I found out was that there's pliability, that there's flexibility. The basic rigidity of
someone's mind is not permanent necessarily. You can change your mind, you can learn. That's really a good thing to know. My first year of punk rock, I was like, this sucks. It
