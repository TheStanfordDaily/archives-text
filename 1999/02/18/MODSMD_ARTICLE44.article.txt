## This week's music reviews Defari Focused Daily 
### 
V y o ' he Southern California-based Likwit Crew has come to
LSi represent the best in underground California hip-hop.
Spearheaded by the efforts of the veteran King Tee, the
inimitable Tha Alkaholiks and newcomer Xzibit, this hip-hop
alliance has offered the most visible alternative to the"G-funk era"
that has for so long dominated popular perceptions of the West
Coast rap scene. Combining intelligent, clever lyricism with mel
lowed gangster attitudes and New York-style beats, the Likwit
Crew is an elite group in hip-hop circles. Coming off several suc
cessful, critically praised 12-inch releases, newest Likwit Crew
member Defari serves up his freshman full length effort with
"Focused Daily," striving to solidify his place within the Likwit
family.
Defari is unquestionably an anomaly in the rap game; he is a
UC-Berkeley graduate and, by day, a high school history teacher.
Yet for all this, his rhymes lack the cleverness of an Xzibit and his
flow lacks the natural fluidity of a Tash (from Tha Alkaholiks);
Defari often seems at odds with — rather than complementary to
— the beats. While his evident love for hip-hop is admirable,
"Focused Daily" is lyrically uninspiring and ultimately disappoint
ing. In a setting that should highlight the best of Defari's skills, his
performance is consistently surpassed by his accomplished pro
duction crew, which includes Evidence, Alchemist and E. Swift of
Tha Alkaholiks. Defari does occasionally shine over the resonant
piano loops of "Never Lose Touch" and the outstanding "Bionic":
"Handle this / Make you believe like an evangelist / That real MCs
are coming to reclaim Los Angeles." Other noteworthy tracks
include the enjoyably distinctive "No Clue" and "Gems," Defari's
self-affirmation of his old-school authenticity. Unfortunately,
Defari's classic blend of boastful rhymes with social consciousness
regularly plays second fiddle to the consistent, if sometimes for
mulaic, production.
Maybe this is being overly critical; God knows worse has been
done. It seems like hip hop has now reached a point where, as long
as a new artist is not "commercial" sounding, they are uncondi
tionally lauded; substance is secondary. Defari seems to exemplify
such a situation. More than a substantive disappointment,
"Focused Daily" fails to validate the lofty of claims of Defari's
many advocates.
