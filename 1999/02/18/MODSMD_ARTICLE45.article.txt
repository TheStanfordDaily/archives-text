ne hallmarks of a great singer is the ability to trans
ff/J figure a thoroughly mediocre song with the energy of an
impassioned performance. Halfway through "God Is a
Number," a dreary anti-technology rant on Sleater-Kinney's new
album "The Hot Rock," Corin Tucker's voice suddenly opens up in
front of you like a Book of Revelation, tongued with fire and
threatening to burst from the limited confines of the song. If there
was any doubt before, it's obvious in that moment that Tucker has
one of the most thrilling voices in modern rock.
However, the real joy of the album is that the rest of the songs
are so damn good. It seemed like it would be impossible to follow
"Dig Me Out," which topped nearly every critic's best-of list for
1997, but Sleater-Kinney doesn't look back and the result is anoth
er punk masterpiece.
This time around the songs are slightly less intense, but that
energy is more than made up for by the heightened emotional
nuance which the singers bring to each track. Carrie Brownstein,
who sings on most of the tracks, is an increasingly effective foil for
Tucker — her archly flat voice provides the perfect complement to
Ttocker's Patti-Smith-does-Puccini wail. On gloriously contrapun
tal melodies like "Burn, Don't Freeze," the effect is dazzling.
Tucker has learned some vocal restraint since the last album,
and it adds immeasurably to her already formidable talent. On
"Hot Rock," the modulation in her delivery from the clipped
whimper of "I'm not the one you keep" to the hurricane gale of
"It's not real" is particularly devastating, while the slight but beau
tiful ballad "A Quarter to Three" floats by on her gentle phrasing.
In fact, one of "The Hot Rock's" greatest improvements over
"Dig Me Out" is its increased dynamic range. For example,
Brownstein's solo "The Size of Our Love" is nearly folk, complete
with a plaintive violin. This song in particular is a revelation — a
marvelously affecting and well-written examination of a woman's
ambiguous feelings for a lover who is dying of an incurable dis
ease.
This is not by any means to say that Sleater-Kinney has stopped
rocking. Songs like "Start Together" and "Burn, Don't Freeze"
careen with barely controlled abandon. The brilliant guitar playing
is less claustrophobic on this album, and the interlocking riffs cir
cle, swirl and smash through wide-open spaces. Janet Weiss' drum
ming anchors everything artfully, simultaneously controlling and
encouraging the chaos.
Not every song is perfect, of course ("Don't Talk Like" and"The
End of You" come to mind), and the lyrics are often a little clum
sy, but they're all made worthwhile by the band's musicianship and
Ticker's stunning voice.
In the roaring surf extravaganza "Banned From the End of the
World," Sleater-Kinney claims to be "the band from the end of the
world." If "The Hot Rock" is any indication, one couldn't ask for a
better apocalypse.
