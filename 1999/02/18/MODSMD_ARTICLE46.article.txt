s ou've got to love the Souls. When it comes to live perfor
mance, they rarely disappoint — and their newest release, a
C—S specially priced, 23-minute recording of a show at The
Continental in New York City last June, is no exception. But if you
can't catch them in person, "Tie One On!" is the next best thing.
Usually background vocals are the first to go when a band makes
the transition from the studio to the stage, but the Souls do an excel
lent job of maintaining their stride. Greg Attonito's lead vocals sound
fantastic as well, as he delivers the songs in a more spontaneous, fun
filled way.
Evident throughout the show is the Souls' irreplacable unique sense
of humor and quirkiness. "I'd like to stop for a moment and tell every
one that this show is being recorded — so don't be a jerk!* Attonito
announces after the first song. "Eh, you can be a jerk if you want," he
adds later. Throughout the show, guitarist Pete Steinkopf declares
himself to be out of tune, while all of the members of the band swear
gratuitously and mouth off to one another after just about every song.
The highlights of the album include the show opener, "Say
Anything," the super charged "East Coast! Fuck You!" — a Souls shout
out for East Coast pride — and the ultra-catchy "ArgyleWhile these
three stand out head and shoulders above the rest, all of the songs are
a real pleasure to listen to.
However, 1 was personally disappointed that they didn't include
"These Are The Quotes From Our Favorite '80s Movies" on the
album. It was the song that turned me on to the band at the Orange
County leg of the "Warped Tour," but nonetheless, the songs that they
did pick worked pretty well. Eight of the tracks are live, while the
ninth one, "Kid," is a promising studio track from the band's upcom
ing release.
For big Souls fans, this one will be a great pickup. If you're unfa
miliar with the band, though, I'd recommend securing their solid
1997 self-titled album first.
