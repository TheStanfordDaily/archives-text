## The 						South Park Album

*Y/Tl ///"~ hat
are you reviewing this week?"
"The South Park CD."
(/ "South Park has an album now?"

Apparently, yes, there's an album now as well. And
thankfully, "Chef Aid: The South Park Album"
(American/Columbia) only has one Eric Cartman
song. For those who like that sort of thing, well, that's
the sort of thing you'd like.
"South Park," the animated comedy series on
Comedy Central that inspired the album, is fine; the
gazillion product tie-ins are a problem. Not to drive
this point into the ground, but, South Park is an over
exposed cult hit, of which most of the fun has been
sucked out its oversized construction paper head.
However, this album works by bringing geeky
goofiness (Primus, Ween, Devo) and bad-boy, hip
hop posturing (Ol Dirty Bastard, DMX, Master P,
Mase, Puffy, LU' Kim) together with a couple dashes of
punkier fare (Rancid, Joe Strummer, Perry Farrell &
D.V.D.A.). This formula is perfect for suburban
teenage boys, which not coincidentally overlaps heav
ily with the audience of the TV show.
The "Chef" character provides the best tracks:
wonderful Isaac Hayes performances which push pil
low-talking seduction to the point of parody. Obvious :
but delightful puns abound in these tracks, most ;
obviously and delightfully in "Chocolate Salty Balls
(P.S. I love you)" The song plays with the overt sexi
ness of Chef's recipe: "Say everybody have you seen '
my balls / They're big and salty and brown / Suck on

my chocolate salty balls / Stick 'em in your mouth and suck 'em."
Hayes is perfect for the Chef character, upping the silliness quotient of
an oversexed womanizer while still being somehow tender, like in
"Simultaneous," as he's trying to invite several women to his bed: "You
and me / And Whitney Houston... On the radio, baby, on the radio,
baby!"
More stand-outs are to found among the hybrid tracks. "Nowhere
to Run,"for example, features Ozzy Osbourne, DMX, Ol Dirty
Bastard, the Crystal Method and Fuzzbubble. Having such different
types of music works shockingly well, for they are all united by a car
toonish thrill and exhlliration. Or as the song ends, "Don't try to psy
chology my shit, motherfucker." Puffy's track, "Will They Die 4 You" is
a stomping hip-hop and metal hybrid that works way better than his
collaboration with Jimmy Page last summer.
Though a South Park production, one can imagine that (Def)
American impresario Rick Rubin is the inspiration behind such a fun
CD. First finding success with the Beastie Boys, Rubin has always
known how to delight suburban audiences with goofy bad-boy pos
turing.
