# Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five vs. The Sugarhill Gang
## The
						Showdown 
### 
d / either Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five nor The
/!/ Sugarhill Gang were the originators of rap, but these two
r legendary hip-hop groups were equally responsible for the
beginning of rap's national exposure and mass production. "The
Showdown: The Sugarhill Gang Vs. Grandmaster Flash" takes each of
these artists' greatest hits and puts them against each other in the bat
tle tradition. It's up to the listener to decide upon the winner.
"The Showdown" explores the roots of rap. Listening to such clas
sics as Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five's "Jesse" — a cam
paign rap to elect Jesse Jackson for president — and"The Message"
— a tale of urban poverty — makes it easy to see where later political
rappers like Public Enemy and Ice-T got their influences. Ten years
later, "The Message" is still as popular as ever, as it has been sampled
and recreated by Ice Cube, as well as Sean "Puffy" Combs: "Don't push
me / 'Cause I'm close to the edge / I'm trying not to lose my head / It's
like a jungle / Sometimes it makes me wonder / How I keep from
going under." Although the context has changed, the message remains
the same.
The Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight" was the first party song.
Set to the music of Chic's disco hit "Good Times," this rap takes you

back to the time of "crews rappin'

on the street corner about the
fun things they did or planned
to do." They brought the feel
good, party-time quality to
rap that would later influence
Doug E. Fresh and the Get
Fresh Crew, Slick Rick, Salt 'N
Pepa, The Fresh Prince (now
Will Smith) and Kid 'N Play.
"The Showdown" is sure to
be an old school collector's
item. This compilation takes
the best of the beginning of
rap and puts it all together for
the listener's delight. This
album will take you back to
the beginning when "old
school" rap was the only
school.
