## MY LEAST FAVORITE MOVIE 'My Favorite Martian' makes no Friends 
### 
here's a fast-paced scene in
Ls/ "My Favorite Martian"
where Christopher Lloyd's
body becomes detachable and Jeff
Daniels is talking to a roving arm.
The scene exemplifies the entire
movie. It is rushed, makes pathetic
attempts at elementary school

it

humor,
employs two
scantily clad
women to tug
at Jeff Dan
iels' "emo
tions" (not to

mention the libido of the fathers of
Disney's target audience) and ends
prematurely.
"Martian," the latest live-action
kid's movie from Disney, stars
Christopher lioyd ("Back to the
Future'') as an alien whose ship has
crash landed into Tim's (Jeff Daniels)
living room. They go through the
usual man-meets-alien pleasantries,
and then Tim realizes that this could
be the story to get him hack his job as
a journalist "Uncle Martin," as the
alien is affectionately referred to, has
his own problems. His spaceship lost
its ability to travel with the crash. It
has something to do with electron
generators. Meanwhile, an evil top
secret government agency tries to
find Uncle Martin.
The rest of the movie is as pre**
dictable as a film can get To be hon
est, the predictability isn't the part I
had issues with. I don't really mind it
in a movie that targets young people.
I do mind when these movies use
recycled methods to arrive at the pre
dictable ending. For example, when
Christopher Lloyd has a monologue
regarding what he needs to fix his

ship, he sounds exactly like he did in
the "Back to the Future" trilogy. I
actually overheard people in the
audience finishing his sentences with
quotes from the earlier film series.
Another example of this movie
"borrowing* from other movies is its
villains. They are supposed to be the
government's secretive extra-terres
trial watchdog agency. In reality, they
are the government's secretive extra
terrestrial watchdog agency from
"Men in Black." The leader of this
division is Wallace Shawn (Vizzini
from"The Princess Bride"), who
obviously has the potential to be
funny - a potential squandered in
this film.
I was also mildly offended by the
use of racial / cultural stereotypes in
the movie. There is a completely
unnecessary character played by an
South Asian American male. The
only reason he exists is to make cer
tain less-educated members of the
audience laugh at his fake accent 1
wasn't the least bit surprised, know
ing Disney's long history of insensi
ti vity to minority groups,
I think the movie could have
worked if Disney had paid more
attention to the story. The chemistry
between the man and the alien could
have carried the movie, if it was
taken seriously. As far as the target
audience is concerned, 1 don't think
kids will find much to interest them
either. I believe kids, like everyone
else, care about characters they can
relate to, and these characters have
nothing to offer anyone.
