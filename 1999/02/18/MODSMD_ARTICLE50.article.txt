# DEATH COMES FOR THE CINEPLEX
## 'Message in a Bottle' 
### 
/^ > rV'eath is a topic that Western culture has
(fyw) deemed verboten, its complexities swept
under the rug and only examined by the rare
William Shakespeare or Lou Reed. In popular movies
death is primarily used as a means of advancing the
plot or getting rid of bad guys. Lately, however, some
mainstream movies such as "Meet Joe Black" and "City
of Angels" have been giving death a serious look. The
newest addition to this trend is "Message in a Bottle."
Of course, the previews for the movie gloss over
death entirely, fearing that such a morbid topic might
scare away viewers. But it is death that compels ship

restorer Garrett Blake
(Kevin Costner) to write a
series of moving and lov
ing letters to his departed
wife, Catherine, and to cast
them into the ocean. One
of these letters — simply

signed "AH my love, G" — is found two years later by
divorced mother Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright
Penn), a Chicago newspaper researcher. Therese
painstakingly sets out to find the man who wrote it.
She eventually finds and meets Garrett, who lives in
a house by the Carolina coast near his father, Dodge
(Paul Newman). Garrett has been disconnected from
the other inhabitants of his small town since his wife's
death. Back in Chicago, Theresa has kept an emotional
distance from others since her divorce. As they get to
know each other, Theresa and Garrett open up; they
are two lost souls learning together how to enjoy them
selves and the company of others.
Although some aspects of the plot are familiar,
"Message" isn't afraid to take chances and deviate from
the predictable love story formula. The movie deals
with what it means to have a loved one die and the way
that survivors grieve, live and love. It's also about
Garrett's relationship with Catherine's family. They
had hoped for greatness in her until she married
Garrett and settled for being a small-town housewife.
And it's about Theresa learning to love and trust again.
"Message in a Bottle" also brings in Garrett's rela
tionship with Dodge, a former alcoholic who has
learned from a hard life and wants to help his son do
the right thing. Dodge isn't afraid to speak his mind,
and his salt-of-the-earth point of view is laced with a
wit that surfaces in the movie's more light-hearted
moments. These aspects of the film do not distract
from the primary story line; rather they lend the story
a life-like complexity.
"Message" is well-shot, with beautiful ocean views
and ocean-town vignettes. Its well-paced development
keeps the viewer's interest until the credits start to roll.
"Message in a Bottle" is a film that will stay with you
long after leaving the theater.
