Dear Roxy:
I can walk around my apartment na
ked, no problem. But after sex I feel the
need to cover up before I &U asleep. That
usually makes the guy grab for his clothes
too. Does it make sense to be uncomfort
able in front of the guy I just had sex with?

people think that enjoying onePphyskal
appearance is a privilege reservecHßKgl
gym-pumped gladiators alone. But Missel
Sass maintains the firm belief that every
one can be naked if they just take off their
clothes. It's just a matter of confidence.
Where does all the anxiety about naked
ness come from? Call it "body-image
issues "call it "American prudishness,"call
it "an extremely humiliating incident in
high school theater." Whatever you say, it
comes down to this: it can be nerve- .
wracking to have someone look at your J
naked body.
Now we go to the beach ... after a little
menial preparation at home. Let's start off
with looking at you. Once your roommate
is out of the room for a long enough time,
lock that door and get naked. Oh, come
now, you coy fox — as if this is new to
you! Now, plant yourself in front of the
mirror. Open your eyes. Forget about
your diet plans for a second. Have you
ever looked away from those love handles
or that birthmark and checked out the
curve of your calf or the changing tone of
your skin from your shoulders to your
toes? Look close. Revel in the beauty.
Now touch yourself. Take it slow, this is
a learning experience. Let's check out the
sensitivity of some under-used nerve*.
When was the last time you really touched
your neck? Run your hand over your
shoulders. Give them a squeeze.
Now that you have gotten to know

yourself with your eyes and your finger
tips, it should be easier to tolerate some
one else's penetrating stare. Don't worry
about narcissism: this is about awareness,
not vanity. When you think about your
body, you begin to realize its potential.
