# THE 						SAN JOSE MUSEUM OF ART

San Jose Museum of Art has few permanent-
LsJ ly installed collections. Instead, its three gal
leries are filled by shows organized around a
theme or artist. Currently, the museum is featuring
exhibits by two American artists, as well as a history of the
last 150 years of street photography.
John Register: A Retrospective
Born in 1939, Register studied English at UC-Berkeley
before enrolling in the California School of Fine Arts,
where he flunked his painting class. Register went on to
succeed in advertising, but experienced a crise-de-couer at
the height of his career. During an important business
meeting, he quietly announced that he had a dentist
appointment, left the meeting and never returned to his
office. From that time on, Register dedicated himself to
painting.
Register often uses photographs as a point of departure,
and his depictions of a reflection in a store window or of a
vinyl diner booth's glare present a photorealistic precision.
Yet large parts of his canvas are rendered in a naive style,
with simple shapes and pure, unblended colors. These
contrasts enhance the eerie atmosphere created by
Register's subject matter — deserted bus shelters, living
rooms, motels, offices and gas stations. The canvases are
devoid of people; human debris such as coffee cups, mag
azines, ashtrays and erasers are also absent.
His work often invites comparison to that of Edward
Hopper. Though flattered, Register comments that "with
Hopper you witness someone else's isolation; in my pic
tures, I think, the viewer becomes the isolated one."
GRONK X 3: Murals, Prints, Projects
The artist known as "GRONK" has transformed the
spacious center hall of the Museum's upper gallery into a
coded text, covering the walls with his visual vocabulary of
abstract, organic forms. There is an element of perfor
mance art in these works: The murals were painted while
the museum was open to the public, and GRONK's inter
actions with the visitors helped shape his artistic vision.
The murals themselves are slated to be whitewashed at the
exhibit's end, underscoring the ephemerality of artistic
experience.
The second part of the exhibit is occupied by GRONK's
multimedia installation projects. "Four Directions" is the
most compelling. Dedicated to the memory of a young girl
murdered while baby-sitting in Hollywood, the piece com
bines music from the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass, a
rhythm from Aztec ritual dance, a central sculpture and a
canvas inspired by a Marisela Norte poem.
In the third room, the visitor is treated to a range of
etchings, woodcuts and monotypes. These playful works
combine GRONK's trademark use of line with a surpris
ingly whimsical palette of pastels.
Bystander: A History of Street Photography
"Bystander" sets out to catalog the evolution of street
photography from its formative days to recent work by
Garry Winogrand and Henri Cartier-Bresson. While unit
ed by a promising theme, the works on display are disap
pointingly commonplace; the strongest response evoked is
the occasional, slight cough of amusement. A number of
eminent photographers are represented, but sadly, the
prints themselves are unremarkable.
