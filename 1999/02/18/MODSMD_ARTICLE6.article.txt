# Clinton explains social security plan
## 
### Kelly Young Senior staff writer 
Now that the threat of impeachment has
passed. President Clinton concentrated his ef
forts yesterday on selling college students on his
proposal for Social Security and Medicare.
The president, with first lady Hillary Rod
ham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin, spoke by satellite to students from 41 col
leges and universities.
Without reform, funds for Social Security are

projected to be exhausted by 2032. when many
of today's college students will either be caring
for their parents or thinking about long-term
care themselves.
By setting aside 62 percent of the projected
federal budget surplus over the next 15 years —
more than $2.7 trillion — Clinton hopes to ex
tend the Social Security Trust Fund until 2055,
and eventually until 2075.
"It ensures that [today'scollege students] will

have Social Security benefits when
[they're] out there," said Sylvia
Mathews, the White House's deputy
director for the Office of Manage
ment and Budget.
One unique aspect of the plan is
that nearly a quarter of the allotted
surplus will be invested in the stock
market, which other countries have
been practicing for years.
The plan will also set aside 15 per
cent of the projected surplus for
strengthening Medicare, and 12 per
cent will go toward a $536-billion tax
cut to establish Universal Savings
Accounts that will help middle-class
families save for their retirement.
Clinton also hopes to eradicate
the national debt by 2018

By buying back U.S. Treasury
bonds, Clinton claims his plan will re
duce the national debt by more than
two-thirds over the next 15 years.
The money returned to bondholders,
he hopes, will be reinvested in the pri
vate sector, which in turn will stimu
late economic growth.
The Congressional Budget Office
estimated that Clinton's plan could
lead to about $800 billion in budget
deficits by 2009. Republicans on
Capitol Hill and at Stanford are al
ready finding holes in Clinton's plan,
so the final product may be far differ
ent than what was discussed yester
day.
"Clinton is playing up Social Secu
rity reform to save his own legacy,"
said Stanford College Republicans
co-President Ryan Parks. "His pro
posal does nothing to reform the rev
enue / benefit structure of Social Se

curity, which is the real threat to its
long-term financial viability."
Rita Ricardo-Campbell, a senior
Hoover fellow who worked on the
Social Security Advisory Council in
1974, predicted that the proposal
would not get far in Congress.
"When you're piling up surplus, 1
think nothing will happen," she said.
"This is not going to be solved by
playing around with figures."
The parties differ on what to do
with the budget surplus. Republicans
have proposed cutting taxes by 10
percent.
"Their idea sounds simpler,
sounds good, even sounds fair — 10
percent for everybody," Clinton said.
"Our idea will give you a stronger
economy, will save Social Security
and Medicare, will stabilize families,
will strengthen the ability of the Unit
ed States to lead the world."
