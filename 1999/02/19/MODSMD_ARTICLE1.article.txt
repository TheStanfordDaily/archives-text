# Continuing studies director steps down
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
When Classics Prof. Marsh McCall first came to Stan
ford in the mid-1980s, he eagerly settled in to a life of
studying Aeschylus and teaching Euripides. But he soon
noticed one major problem with the Stanford educa
tional community: All of the students were under 30.
"It seemed not right for a great university not to have
a continuing education program," McCall said.
So, like the Greek and Roman heroes he studies, Mc-
Call came, saw and conquered. He became the Univer
sity's first dean of continuing studies and summer ses
sion, and under his stewardship, Stanford created an
adult education department that now serves 2.3(H) stu
dents per quarter, up from only 9(X) students four years
ago.

McCall will step down July 1. however, and the de
partment he built from scratch will have to learn to func
tion without his leadership.
His replacement will he Charles Junkerman. who has
been associate dean of continuing studies and summer
session since 1995. J unkerman has been at Stanford for
15 years in a variety of capacities, including assistant
dean of undergraduate studies.
"It's been a great pleasure for me to teach in [contin
uing studies] courses," Junkerman said. "The students
are so smart and so committed. They have such great life
experience, and they're great talkers."
The continuing studies department offers primarily
non-degree granting liberal arts courses, although it
does have a small masters of liberal arts program. It gives

one-day, five-week and 10-week
courses as well as summer courses
on topics from Robert Frost to ab
normal psychology.
Junkerman plans to expand on a
number of the program's recent ad
ditions, including "classes in new
fields like ecology and nature, Web
technology and creative writing.
We're also putting in more travel
programs and field seminars,... and
we started a theatrical summer pro
gram."
As a result of the alumni associa
tion's recent merger with the Uni
versity, Junkerman will have the op
portunity to work with the associa
tion on several programs, including
travel and field seminars.
He also plans to bring Web tech

nology into more classes.
Unlike many college continuing
education programs, Stanford's is
not a money-maker. According to
Junkerman and McCall, the kind of
courses that make money at most
schools are technical classes that are
less academically-focused.
"We don't have backyard bar-he
cue courses or wine tasting courses,
and those are the ones that make
money," McCall said.

Junkerman added the program
"wasn't designed to make money."
The continuing education pro
gram makes almost no money, but
the summer program brings in about
$1.5 million per year. This number
hardly compares to the revenue gen
erated by continuing education pro
grams at other universities: Harvard
makes $150 million a year, and
Berkeley $45 million, according to
the Chronicle of Higher Education.
