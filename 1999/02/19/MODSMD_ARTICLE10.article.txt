## Top UC applicants would benefit Davis backs 4% plan 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Saving a spot at the University of
California for the top 4 percent of
high school graduates is a smart
move. Gov. Gray Davis told LIC
regents yesterday.
"This is a loud and clear message
that we will reward excellence,"
said Davis.
Regents, who are not scheduled
to vote on the plan until next
month, appeared largely receptive.
However, some said they need
reassurance the change won't lower
academic standards or mean turn
ing away students eligible under

existing standards.
Davis, who campaigned on a
platform of improving education,
has made it clear he wants to see
the 4 percent plan passed. He made
it a key part of his inaugural address
last month.
The 4 percent proposal is part of
a larger plan that includes reducing
the extra admissions points for
advanced-placement courses. The
plan would also de-emphasize the
importance of the general SAT I
test in favor of SAT II scores that
reflect knowledge of particular sub
jects.
