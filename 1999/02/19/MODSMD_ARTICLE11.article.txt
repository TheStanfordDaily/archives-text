### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With time run
ning out for a political settlement, NATO
reviewed possible Serb targets in and around
Kosovo, and the Clinton administration warned
President Slobodan Milosevic yesterday to
choose peace with ethnic Albanians or face a
devastating military strike.
"I le will be hit hard, and he will be deprived
of the things that he values," warned Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, who planned to
return today to the peace talks in Rambouillet,
France.
If an attack were ordered, scores of sea
launched Tomahawk missiles would hit Serb
air-defense sites and radar facilities first, then
vital command centers and barracks in what
likely would be a limited NATO strike. Pen
tagon planners said. They cautioned, however,

that a more aggressive attack plan is being con
sidered.
In their second week of peace talks, the
Serbs and ethnic Albanians have until noon
tomorrow to reach agreement on a self-rule
plan for Kosovo, a Serbian province. Mediators
at Rambouillet presented the two sides a final
version yesterday of a proposed political settle
ment.
Albright and Norwegian Foreign Minister
Knut Vollebaek. chairman of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, point
edly reminded Milosevic that if he doesn't
accept NATO peacekeeping ground troops as
part of any Kosovo agreement, he will face mil
itary consequences.
Adding power to the military threat, 51 addi
tional U.S. warplanes ordered to the region

Wednesday will arrive over the weekend and
early next week, augmenting a 220-aircraft fleet
already at European bases and aboard the USS
Enterprise in the Mediterranean.
Even as NATO prepared for possible
airstrikes, however, it also prepared for peace.
Cohen signed an order yesterday for 1,855
Marines to be part of a 7,000-strong NATO
"enabling force" that would move into Pristina.
Kosovo's capital, ahead of peacekeeping
troops, if an agreement is signed.
At stake is the future of the poor southern
province where 90 pereent of the 2 million pop
ulation is ethnic Albanian. An estimated 2,000
people have died, and hundreds of thousands
have been driven from their homes in a year of
conflict between Serbs and independence-seek
ing Kosovo Albanians.
