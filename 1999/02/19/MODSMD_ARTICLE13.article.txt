Administration makes
good decision in hiring
full-time directors

WEDNESDAY'S announce
ment by the dean of stu
dents office promising
funding for full-time directors for
the Women's Center and the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center was an extraordinarily posi
tive step that was a long time com
ing.
A nationwide search will be con
ducted during the spring for the
LGBCC director. Fabienne McPhail,
the current half-time director at the
Women's Center, will now work full
time at the center.
The announcement comes after
the repeated denials of requests for
full-time directors at both centers.
This decision shows a genuine
commitment by University adminis
trators to the needs of students on
campus. Both centers serve a vital
and supportive role for many stu
dents. Full-time directors will pro
vide each center with an increase in
valuable leadership and stability.
In 1997, both centers were allocat
ed funds for half-time directors. In
addition to McPhail in the Women's
Center, Gwendolyn Dean was hired
as the LGBCC director. Dean, how
ever, abruptly left Stanford last
November for a full-time position at
Cornell University.
Student requests for increased
staffing culminated last December
when about 50 students met with
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya, Dean of Students

Marc Wais and Assoc. Dean of Stu
dents Morris Graves to voice their
concerns.
We applaud the dean of students
office for the way in which it chose
to handle this situation. In respond
ing to what the community had to
say, Wais and Graves gave students a
reason to show a renewed faith in
the administration's desire to listen
to what students want and act upon
it.
This decision points towards an
administration that is in touch with
the concerns and needs of its student
body.
Further, administrators should be
lauded for finding funding for these
posts despite current budgetary con
cerns. Wais indicated that the bud
gets for other centers on campus will
not be affected by this decision, but
will rather "be absorbed" within the
dean of students office.
This shows how this type of deci
sion need not be made at the
expense of other students on cam
pus.
All students can therefore sup
port this decision, whether or not it
affects them directly, because it
serves to improve the situation of a
number of their peers.
It is important that the University
community focuses on the fact that
this decision was indeed reached,
rather than on its timing. While we
wish the decision had been made
earlier, we're glad that it has hap
pened and feel that the topic of tim
ing can be put to rest.
We should celebrate this decision
as a valuable gain for creating a sup
portive environment on campus for
our eommunitv centers.
