Maples not yet Cameron
As a four-time Sixth Man Club member
and twice a Cameron Crazy, I agree with
Will Flemming that Stanford basketball fans
have a long way to go before they can be
worthy of the comparisons to Duke ("Stan
ford's fans inferior to Duke's," Feb. 17). It
seems to me that many Sixth Man Club
members are under the impression that their
mere presence in massive numbers is enough
to make any visiting team weak in the knees.
While I admit that a sea of students wearing
identical T-shirts and chanting in unison at
times is impressive, it pales in comparison to
Cameron, where Duke students encircle the
floor completely and cheer from start to fin
ish.
How many times has Stanford come from
behind to take the lead amidst a deafening
roar from the student section only to struggle
to keep ahead with no more than a whisper
of encouragement?
This kind of fair-weather support has
been observed to extend deeper into the
final minutes of a game when a win doesn't
seem likely, and currently it can be seen in
the lack of loyalty of many club members
who aren't even interested in the remaining
games of the season. Earlier this quarter on
the Stanford market newsgroup, users were
bombarded with requests for UConn and
UCLA tickets offering to pay top dollar. Log
on to the newsgroup now. and all you see is
Sixth Man Club members selling the use of
their tickets and shirts now that the big con
tests have passed. It upsets and disgusts me
that so many students would rather make a
profit than be loyal club members and sup
port the team at each and every game.

1 don't want to say that the Sixth Man
Club is all bad. On the contrary, 1 applaud
them for their latest cheer that follows a play
er on the opposing team who has fouled out
all the way to the bench by calling out his
steps. Once again, though, the lack of sup
port for the team is astounding at times. This
past weekend during the game against USC,
the Sixth Man Club was so intent on com
pleting this cheer when a USC player fouled
Kris Weenis for his fifth foul, that club mem
bers yelled the final "sit-down" right as
Weems took his foul shot. Where are the pri
orities here?
I think the problems with the Sixth Man
Club of late are many, but I want to make it
clear that I am in no way suggesting anything
less than the continuation of the program. As
I mentioned earlier, I was a member of the
Sixth Man Club my entire Stanford career
and bore witness to the extraordinary rise to
the top of our basketball team. The club
membership was no more than ISO students
my freshman year, and I have watched the
numbers grow exponentially each year with
excitement and pride.
I am still excited about the potential of the
club to create an atmosphere at Maples that
can and will rival Cameron, but I can honest
ly say that amidst the incidents of this year,
it's hard to be proud of what the Sixth Man
Club has become.

A plan for Dining Services
During the past two weeks. The Daily has
run two articles on the scheduling changes

associated with Stanford Dining Services'
Value Enhancement Program. In addition,
on Wednesday, Keith Guy, Shirley Everett
and Keith Smith wrote an opinion piece
responding to some of the criticism levied
against Dining Services concerning the
implementation of these changes. Our pur
pose in writing this letter is not to add to the
polemics of this debate but rather to present
a just and practical solution to the problems
currently at hand.
As Stanford students, we appreciate
efforts to improve food quality and lower
food costs. However, at the same time, we
want to feel assured that our room and board
fees are supporting a dining program in
which the employees preparing and serving
our food have a fair opportunity to share
their opinions regarding major schedule
changes with management. In this vein, we
propose the following:
• The Service Employees International
Union Local 715 (United Stanford Workers)
and the management of Dining Services
should reconvene discussions over both the
actual changes in work hours and locations
for given work shifts (which has never been
done to date). In addition, the discussions
should address the decision-making process
for assigning work shifts to employees whose
locations and hours change.
• Any changes which come out of these
discussions should be put to a vote by the 114
unionized employees of Stanford Dining
Services who will be affected by the changes.
• The implementation of the schedule
changes cease (including the bidding over
work shifts and the transfer of employees)
until the aforementioned items are complet
ed.

In order to facilitate this process, we
would be most happy to administer a vote to
the workforce on the results of these discus
sions between the union and management.
We think that our proposal could provide
a potentially amicable solution to the current
problems between management and labor in
Dining Services. This proposal would give
workers an opportunity to express their
needs so that they do not have to bear unfair
burdens. For example, it would allow those
who would be adversely affected by an
increased need for child care as a result of the
scheduling changes to find alternative work
arrangements.
Furthermore, since the program is a
multi-year effort which will require ongoing
cooperation between management and
employees, affording workers the opportuni
ty to be involved in making decisions which
greatly impact their daily lives can only
improve the work environment. Hopefully,
this process will forge a stronger relationship
between management and workers, resulting
in future cost savings and improved food
quality for Stanford students.
To demonstrate our support for the
employees affected by these changes and to
request that management adopt this three
point proposal, we will hold a rally in White
Plaza today at noon. From White Plaza, we
will march to the office of Keith Guy, Direc
tor of Housing and Dining Services, where
we hope to meet and present our ideas.
