## Alden Clarke Randomizing Stanford output 
### 
STANFORD belongs
to the genus univer
sity, but it also
belongs to a much more
general class of entities:
transformations. As a
transformation, Stanford
receives inputs, the mem
bers of the freshman class,

and after four years yields roughly the same
number of outputs, the members of the
graduating class.
As it stands, the input of a diligent, com
puter-loving, Porsche-fixated 17-year-old
with an 800 on her Math SAT proceeds fair
ly predictably to the output of a computer
science co-terminal student hungry for
stock options. As it stands, the input of a
studious Gatorade National High School
Baseball Player of the Year proceeds fairly
predictably to the output of a prototype
Major Leaguer who leaves Stanford at the
end of his junior year with an economics
degree. As it stands, the input of a hard
core International Physics Olympiad gold
medallist proceeds fairly predictably to the
output of a Caltech physics doctoral stu
dent. As a transformation, Stanford is
somewhat predictable.
Sadly, esteemed Stanford shares this
type of predictability with mundane, com
mon machinery. Consider the Sweet Hall
vending machine: the input of $1.25 and the
pressing of the "Surge" button invariably
results in the output of one bottle of Surge
soda. Consider the Gordon Biersch Brew
ery: the input of malted and roasted barley
and moderate hops proceeds every time to
the output of pilsner, a crisp golden lager.
Consider your Web browser: the input of

"http://www.theonion.com" leads almost
without fail to its output, the funniest site on
the Web.
To distinguish itself ontologically, Stan
ford must perform a transformation that's
utterly unpredictable. In other words, for
Stanford to transcend the class of common
machines — things like vending machines,
breweries and Web browsers — it must link
inputs to outputs with intractable magic, not
predictable causal chains. Otherwise, Stan
ford is nothing more than an extremely suc
cessful factory, producing a popular and
influential product — much like Microsoft.
The most obvious solution is to random
ize Stanford. Doing so would make the
transformation Stanford performs similar to
blindly throwing a dart with your name on it
at a table of majors, values and personality
types in order to determine what you'll be
like when you graduate.
Such a dart-throwing process, however,
would not only rob us of any involvement in
choosing our fate, but would also still, in
some strong sense, be predictable. Suppose
that you made the Sweet Hall soda machine
random. Pressing the "Surge" button on
this random soda machine might now yield
Coke, Sprite or Dr. Pepper. The output is
random, but it is selected from a pre-deter
mined, pre-existent, limited set of options.
Stanford will be redeemed and will be
an entity of the highest order when its out
put is random in the most profound sense:
each output is something that has never
existed before.
After pressing the "Surge" button, a
vending machine of this new type might dis
pense a viscous, mint-scented, hallucino
genic, mango-flavored Sprite, but would

never do so again.
Can Stanford produce an International
Physics Olympiad gold medallist who is
money from three-point land, has
Maxwell's equations tattooed in huge Goth
ic letters on his left arm and has a crossover
dribble that can juke Khalid El-Amin out of
his shoes? Can Stanford produce a Major
League all-star who delivers radical Leftist
rhetoric every time he's interviewed? Can
Stanford produce a CS co-terminal student
who leads a militant free-love movement to
victory in Eastern Europe? Can Stanford
transform us into people who haven't exist
ed before?
We stand in the incredibly privileged
position of possessing control over the pro
cess by which we are transformed. By plan
ning unprecedented events and conducting
ourselves in unprecedented ways, we let
Stanford produce unprecedented people.
How about a "screw your roommate" in
which you're not assigned a date for a dance
but a girlfriend for a week? Or a Nonverbal
Communication Day on which no person
on campus utters a word? Or students
vehemently insisting that their professors be
grateful for the opportunity to teach them?
Or "cosmologies" symposia (there's one
tonight at the Science and Engineering
Quad Teaching Center, 7:30 p.m.) attended
by throngs of peyote-influenced students in
exotic religious costumes, chanting incanta
tions on the SEQ steps?

Alden Clarke is a senior majoring in
physics and symbolic systems. He wishes
you well. His column will appear here on
Fridays.
