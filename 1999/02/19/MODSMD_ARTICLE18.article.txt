## Smoking and other ways to feel good Mark Silver 
### 
People at Stanford are sup
posed to be smart. We all do pretty
well on tests and, arguably, have a
better grasp on rational thought than the
average American. But if we're so intelli
gent, then why do so many people at Stan
ford smoke? I'm talking about cigarettes;
there's nothing inherently stupid about
smoking marijuana.
There's nothing smart about smoking.
It makes you and your clothes smell really
bad, gives your teeth ugly stains and
makes you unable to walk long distances
at normal speeds without hyperventilat
ing.
Oh, and it can and will kill you. I think
medical science is pretty much right on
with this particular correlation.
Now, all you smokers out there may be
saying, "Who is this holier-than-thou, self
righteous bastard who keeps calling me
stupid?"
Well, hold on there. I'm just trying to
answer an honest question, and now I'll
proceed.
I come from the East Coast, where lots
of people smoke. I had friends who were

heavy smokers, and I used to bum a
cigarette every once in a while (since I can
be stupid as well) and join them for a brief
stop on their road to cancer. It was never a
big deal; I never smoked all that much,
because I thought it was stupid and made
me smell bad.
Then I arrived in California, a.k.a.
Super Healthy Land, and everything
changed. Not too many people smoked.
The state even passed a measure banning
smoking in bars.
Who bans smoking in bars? Now every
one can see better, and doesn't that defeat
the purpose? Bars should by nature be
smoky and dim; how else will they facili
tate beer goggles and drunken sex?
But I digress. I came to Stanford, and to
my surprise, almost no one in my limited
world of dorm life smoked. In fact, I was
hard pressed to find smokers anywhere.
Sure, people were getting hammered and
vomiting everywhere, which could be con
sidered moronic behavior, but no one was
taking an unintelligent drag off a Camel
filter.
I started to believe in a pervasive total

itarianism of anti-smoking, that there was
a grand conspiracy on the part of almost
all Stanford students to eliminate smokers
from the general population. So, since I
sometimes like to pretend I'm a noncon
formist, 1 began to fight back. I picked up
the habit, eventually progressing to about
a pack a week by last fall.
As soon as 1 started smoking — sur
prise, surprise — smokers began appear
ing everywhere. 1 saw them outside of the
Coffee House, by the Quad, at parties, in
the sky.
Either I had joined the ranks of fellow
revolutionaries, unknown to me before, or
I had vastly over-estimated the extent of
the grand conspiracy. Either way, I decid
ed it was time to stop, pretending it was for
health reasons but secretly acknowledging
my reluctance to spend more than $4
(close to five now) on anything that could
fit in my pocket.
But we still haven't answered the real
question. Radical sentiment is not a suffi
cient explanation for smoking at Stanford.
The real, obvious answer came to me in a
flash while I jumped off the wagon for a

short while and smoked a Parliament last
week: smoking cigarettes makes you feel
good.
Nicotine is a stimulant, and it gives you
a buzz. Why shouldn't we want to feel
good? Who cares about cancer; all of us
die eventually, so why not really enjoy our
time here?
Well, my friends, here is my answer.
Smoking only provides a momentary high,
a quick escape from the stresses and pres
sures that we face here at Stanford. Band-
Aid solutions don't address the more fun
damental problem — why do we need
cigarettes to feel good?
Our hectic schedules and relentless
drive towards successful careers leave us
gasping for air and with a pressing need
for release. Many drink, some smoke, few
dose.
Why don't we attack the root of the
problem instead of trying to momentarily
escape from it? The question is — what do
we need to be truly happy?
The answer, my friends, is sleep and
love. And maybe music. But the first two
are most important. Sleep makes us less

irritable and more productive and leaves
us feeling better about the world in gener
al. Love makes us infinitely happier
(although also infinitely sadder) than any
other emotional state in the world — peo
ple in love do not need cigarettes.
So let's do it. Let's try a little experi
ment and not just with smokers — 1 want
non-smokers too.
All of you out there, stop working so
hard and walking so fast, and go to sleep.
And when you wake up, make eye contact,
start smiling and talk to interesting people.
Maybe you'll fall in love. Work towards
happiness. Get back to me in a few weeks
with results.
As Margaret Mead once said: "Never
doubt that a small group of well-rested,
well-loved citizens can change the world.
Indeed it is the only thing that ever has."
Let the revolution begin.

declared. He has had enough of love for
now and just wants to take a nap. His col
umn will appear here on Fridays.
