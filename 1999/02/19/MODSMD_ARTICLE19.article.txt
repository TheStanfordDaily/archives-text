## Washington ruins streak Women lose by 12 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
Stanford basketball has a prob
lem, a very, very serious problem. Its
men's and women's programs seem
to be unable to perform well at the
same time. The men beat Washing
ton in Seattle by 32 points.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Yesterday: Washington (12-11, 8-
6) 62, Stanford (14-10,10-3 Pacific 10
Conference) 74.
The Cardinal (14-10, 10-3 Pacific
10 Conference) lost their seven
game win streak and the game, a 74-
62 debacle to the Washington
Huskies (12-11, 8-6). The Cardinal
moved themselves out of a tie for first
in the Pac-10, and most likely have
seen a postseason first-round home
game disappear.
Stanford's free-throw shooting
ability also vanished, as did its skill at
keeping the ball on its possessions
and rebounding the ball defensively.
On the night, the Cardinal was only
58 percent from the line, committed
24 turnovers and consistently al
lowed Washington to get second
chances on offense.
The Huskies came out strong in
the first half, taking a 10-0 lead with
in the first three minutes. Senior
guard Jamie Redd was instrumental
within this stretch, driving down the
lane on one play only to hit a trey
from four feet behind the line a few

plays later.
The cold Cardinal finally found
some heat in sophomore forward
Sarah Dimson, who returned after
being out with a stress reaction in her
right foot. Dimson scored Stanford's
first points on a driving layup, and
followed one play later with a seven
foot jumper.
Along with Dimson, sophomore
center Carolyn Moos helped get the
Cardinal back in the game early on.
Moos stayed strong throughout the
game, ending with her team leading
fifth double-double (16 points, 13 re
bounds), and only committing one
turnover in her 37 minutes.
"Carolyn did a really nice job
against their defense pretty much all
night," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer
Moos was the exception to the
rule tonight, as both freshman for
ward Lindsey Yamasaki and junior
guard Milena Flores let go of the ball
six times. At the five-minute mark in
the first half, Stanford was only down
by one, 27-28, but five turnovers, in
cluding four bad passes to various
past players, allowed the Huskies to
make a 10-point run for the second
time that half.
"When you turn the ball over 24
times you're not going to win very
often," VanDerveer said. "I thought
our turnover situation really cooked
us."
"We shot ourselves in the foot be
cause thev were able to convert on
our turnovers," added senior guard
Regan Freuen.
Another problem area for the
Cardinal was its free throws, an as
pect of its game that had improved
dramatically within the Pac-10 sea
son. Stanford was above 70 percent
heading into the game, but in the first
half it shot only 50 percent, and it im
proved to just barely over 65 percent
for the second half.
The one bright spot for the Cardi
nal came at the beginning of the sec
ond half, as Stanford ripped off an 1 8-
3 run in the first seven minutes. The
Cardinal committed only three
turnovers during this period, and
Freuen finally came alive, scoring
seven including two driving layups
and two bombs from behind the arc.
"When we made the run. its not
like we put them down by 15, but I
think to their credit they stayed with
things," VanDerveer said.
The Huskies never gave up, coun
tering with a 9-3 run, tying the game
with 10 minutes to go. From that
point on, it was all Washington, as it
scored 22 points and Stanford could
only answer with eight.
Turnovers were a major reason
for the dismal finish, as Stanford was
never able to find a rhythm. At the
two-minute mark Stanford was still
only down by six as Yamasaki had
just hit two threes in a row. but two
turnovers by Flores and junior guard
Christina Batastini quickly shut
down any hopes of a victory.
"I think this game here cost us a
chance at hosting a first round," Van-

Derveer said.
The Cardinal's chance at receiv
ing an automatic bid to the tourna
ment by winning the Pac-l()isnowin
dire straits, and Stanford will have to

count on other teams stepping up
against UCLA and Oregon. The
Cardinal face Oregon later in the
season, hut it must first face Wash
ington State.
