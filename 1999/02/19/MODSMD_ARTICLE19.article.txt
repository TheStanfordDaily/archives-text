## Washington ruins streak Women lose by 12 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
Stanford basketball has a prob
lem, a very, very serious problem. Its
men's and women's programs seem
to be unable to perform well at the
same time. The men beat Washing
ton in Seattle by 32 points.
What happened to the women?
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
â–  Yesterday: Washington (12-11, 8-
6) 62, Stanford (14-10,10-3 Pacific 10
Conference) 74.
The Cardinal (14-10, 10-3 Pacific
10 Conference) lost their seven
game win streak and the game, a 74-
62 debacle to the Washington
Huskies (12-11, 8-6). The Cardinal
moved themselves out of a tie for first
in the Pac-10, and most likely have
seen a postseason first-round home
game disappear.
Stanford's free-throw shooting
ability also vanished, as did its skill at
keeping the ball on its possessions
and rebounding the ball defensively.
On the night, the Cardinal was only
58 percent from the line, committed
24 turnovers and consistently al
lowed Washington to get second
chances on offense.
The Huskies came out strong in
the first half, taking a 10-0 lead with
in the first three minutes. Senior
guard Jamie Redd was instrumental
within this stretch, driving down the
lane on one play only to hit a trey
from four feet behind the line a few

plays later.
The cold Cardinal finally found
some heat in sophomore forward
Sarah Dimson, who returned after
being out with a stress reaction in her
right foot. Dimson scored Stanford's
first points on a driving layup, and
followed one play later with a seven
foot jumper.
Along with Dimson, sophomore
center Carolyn Moos helped get the
Cardinal back in the game early on.
Moos stayed strong throughout the
game, ending with her team leading
fifth double-double (16 points, 13 re
bounds), and only committing one
turnover in her 37 minutes.
"Carolyn did a really nice job
against their defense pretty much all
night," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer
Moos was the exception to the
rule tonight, as both freshman for
ward Lindsey Yamasaki and junior
guard Milena Flores let go of the ball
six times. At the five-minute mark in
the first half, Stanford was only down
by one, 27-28, but five turnovers, in
cluding four bad passes to various
past players, allowed the Huskies to
make a 10-point run for the second
time that half.
"When you turn the ball over 24
times you're not going to win very
often," VanDerveer said. "I thought
our turnover situation really cooked
us."
"We shot ourselves in the foot be
