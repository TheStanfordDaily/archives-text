Editors note: In 1968, Andy Warhol

made the oft-quot
ed statement, "In
the future, every
one will be famous
for 15 minutes."
This article is part
of a series about
various members
of the Stanford

community. Subjects are picked at
random from the Stanford Directory.
Patrick Coffman, a junior living in
Whitman, said he is fascinated by
"the underdog, the people who didn't
get all the credit, the people behind
the people — not just those who
stand out."
However, if his dreams of human
advancement through technology
are realized, he may have to accept
recognition.
Coffman is majoring in symbolic
systems, "although you'd never
know it from looking at my tran
script," he said. He said he is current
ly taking "fun classes" about human
and computer interactions and entre
prenuership.
He hopes to start "a great compa
ny with great products for people, in
stead of just building great products."
He said his goal is "designing tech
nology for the sake of human ad
vancement, not just for the sake of
technology."
Coffman regards Doug Engel-
I ;rt, the inventor of the computer
nouse, as his hero. "He's someone
who's shown a lot of foresight and

done visionary things hut never got
ten eredit. He still tries to move the
world even though his name's not
plastered all over," he said.
His parents are divorced and live
in Idaho. His father, Larry, works for
an electrical utility company and is
now remarried. His mother Janet is
an interior decorator, who "is famous
around the country," according to
Coffman.
Coffman grew up in Rupert.
Idaho, which is a small town of S,(XX)
people, an hour away from Sun Val
ley ski resort. Growing up in Rupert
"was boring but really nice because
you knew everyone — you'd go into
the grocery store and talk," he said.
Iri high school, where he graduat
ed in a class of 3(X), he joined the busi
ness club and competed nationally,
particularly in graphic design. "1
started a chess club, but that's not
very interesting, so don't put that" in
the article, he added.
"I was always interested in high
technology and Silicon Valley, and
Stanford was the best place to [pur
sue] this," he said. He also said he was
"looking to expand my knowledge of
other people in the world," since his
town was 50 percent white and 50
percent Hispanic.
Coffman said he likes the Farm's
proximity to Silicon Valley, and he
enjoys attending forums with local
companies.
He praised the "truly caring, intel
ligent" people at Stanford.
"It's great to be at Stanford be
cause you're recognized as intelligent
... with the potential to understand."
he added.
