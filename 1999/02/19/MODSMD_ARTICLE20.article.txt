SEATTLE — In case anyone
had forgotten, the Stanford men's
basketball team used an 89-57
blowout of the Washington
Huskies to remind everyone that
this is why people picked the Cardi
nal to return to the Final Four and
make a run at the national title.
MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Yesterday: NO. 7 Stanford (21-5,
11-2 Pacific 10 Conference) 89
Washington (15-9,8-6) 57.
Heading into last night's game,
no one would have expected this
result. Stanford had dropped three
of its last six, including a terrible
home loss to USC last Saturday.
Washington, on the other hand,
had won eight of its last 10 contests
including huge victories over
UCLA and Arizona. And the
Huskies were unbeatable at home,
going a perfect 10-0 at Hec Ed
mondson Pavilion on the season.
But this was a game of turn
arounds.
The Cardinal, which had trailed
by at least nine points in the first
half of its last seven games, came
out sprinting in the first period and
jumped out to a 14-point halftime
lead.
Stanford, which had been stone
cold from the floor and unable to
break through pressure defense

and get out on the fast break for
easy baskets, suddenly became a
hot-shooting team that was eager
to push the ball out on the break for
easy buckets.
The final stat sheet told the story
of the game, this one brief chapter
in the 1997-98 season. But the
smiles on the faces of the Stanford
players spoke volumes about how
much this win meant to the Cardi
nal.
"This was great for our confi
dence," said Stanford senior guard
Kris Weems, who broke out of a re
cent slump and scored 14 points on
6-of-9 shooting. "We wanted to
play well from the start. Tonight
was definitely the best we have
played in a long time."
The game figured to hinge on
the battle in the post between the
two centers, Tim Young and Todd
MacCulloch. But Young picked up
two fouls in the first four minutes
and was forced to the bench in
favor of senior forward Mark
Seaton.
Much like he did at Maples
Pavilion in January in a nearly iden
tical situation, Seaton stepped in
and gave the Cardinal huge min
utes, keeping MacCulloch away
from the basket and off the score
board.
"He is so difficult to guard, be
cause he is a such a great player in
the post," Seaton said. "I just tried
