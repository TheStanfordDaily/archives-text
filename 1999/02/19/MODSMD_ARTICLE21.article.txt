# Last dual meet for men
## 
### Rebecca Rettig Editorial staff 
The men's swim team is destructive.
In its two past meets, the top-ranked Stanford team
(9-0 overall, 3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) did not think
twice about demolition. The swimmers shattered six
pool records, broke into the NCAA qualifying times
and obliterated three teams in the course of one week
end. Every showdown results in Stanford's opponents'
ruin.
And now it is time for another showdown, a bigger
type of showdown, a California-Stanford showdown.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will take on the No. 8 Bears
(9-1), ready to wreak its usual Stanford swimming
havoc.
MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford (9-0, 3-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) at No. 8 California (9-1).
The meet will take place at the UC-San Francisco
swimming complex due to complications with the pool
at Berkeley. Typical of Cal to have something wrong
with its pool; it seems that there is always something
wrong with Cal — except for its swim team.
This year, Cal has a stronger team than it has had in
years. The usually slack Bears gave Stanford a run for
its money in the traditional double-distance meet in
the week preceding Big Game. Although the first Car
dinal-Cal showdown of the year was not scored, both
teams realized just how competitive the Cal swimmers
had become.
"Cal gave an unexpectedly strong performance in
the double-distance meet," said junior Kurt Spenser.
"They have a more talented team than they have had

in the past."
Stanford's true goal in competing against the Bears
is to keep itself undefeated for the season. If the Car
dinal prevails, it will have the prestigious qualification
of being undefeated for two consecutive years.
Other factors besides Cal's improved team will
make the meet challenging for Stanford. First, since
the dual meet season is coming to a close and the Pac
-10 Championships are rapidly approaching, teams
have begun tapering. Tapering includes resting more,
having shorter workouts and also not putting in as
many yards.
"At this point in the season, both teams have begun
resting," said junior Steve Ronson. 'it is a good indicator
on how fast we're going to be at Pac-lOs and NCAAs."
Another factor that will make tomorrow's meet
even more arduous for the Cardinal is that it is the last
dual meet for the eight seniors on the team, including
pool record breakers Tate Blahnik and co-captains
Dod Wales and Justin Ewers.
The last thing that provides some Cardinal appre
hension is the fact that both Cal and Stanford experi
enced close meets with No. 4 USC. The Trojans are
the second most competitive Pac-10 team after Stan
ford and the fact that Cal gave USC a run for its
money, despite the Bears' loss to the Trojans, proves
even further the vast improvement in the cross-Bay
rival's swimming team.
The team's goal is to "post faster times than we've
posted all season since we've begun to cut back in
practice and prepare for the championship part of our
season," Ronson said. "If we are able to do that, there
is no way that Cal can beat us as long as we swim as
well as we've swum so far."
But despite the obstacles facing the Cardinal, the
swimmers will step up to their intensity to ruin yet an
other team, Cal.
