# Baseball hosts three-game series
## Stanford takes on Cal

newly formed Pacific 10 Conference
baseball season.

No. 8 California (9-1).

Or maybe just a way to keep an
old Pac-10Southern Division rivalry
alive, a rivalry that has seen Stan
ford and California evenly split its
400 meetings.
Whatever the case may be, fifth
ranked Stanford and Cal — two Six-
Pac expatriates — will square off in
a three-game weekend series

starting tonight with a 7 p.m. game at
Sunken Diamond. Because the Pac
-10 Northern and Southern Divisions
merged to form a new nine-team
league, the conference season will
now consist of a 24-game round
robin schedule. Therefore, the Stan
ford-Cal series in April will count in
the Pac-10 standings, but this week
end's games will not.
Not that it quells this Bay Area ri
valry.
."It's a typical Cal-Stanford
thing," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "It's always a rival
ry and 1 think records really mean
nothing. They had a big losing
record last year and they beat us two
out of six last year. Whether it's Cal
or Stanford, we usually play our best
baseball against each other."
The Cardinal (8-3) has quickly
turned things around, ripping off
seven straight wins and outscoring
its opponents by 52-22 in the
process. Lately, the winning formula
has been the big inning by the

offense and some strong pitching
from the young Cardinal staff.
Leading the way in that depart
ment has been sophomore right
hander Jason Young (2-1, 2.08
E R A), who was named Pac-10 Play
er of the Week and will take the
mound for Sunday's game. In two
starts last week, Young went 2-0
with an 0.60 ERA while allowing six
hits and one earned run in 15 innings
of work.
The rotation this weekend will be
slightly juggled, however. Sopho
more right-hander Justin Wayne (1-
1, 5.95 ERA) will start tonight, but
freshman right-hander Brian Sager
(1-0, 1.50 ERA) will make his first
start tomorrow afternoon in place of
fellow freshman righty Mike
Gosling (1-0,5.00 ERA).
The offense has started to come
up with the clutch base hit after
stranding several runners in its
opening series versus Fresno State,

Stanford freshman pitcher Dan Rich throws a pitch in a game earlier this year. Stanford hosts three
weekend games against California this weekend.
In Wednesday's game against Sacra
mento State, Stanford managed
very little against the Hornets
until a two-out rally in the sixth in
ning. that is.
"We're starting to swing the hats
a little bit better. By that I'm refer
ring to (iall, Borchard. I iochgesang,
and Mutli. who has been our most
consistent hitter from day one,"
Marquess said.
California's baseball season got
off to a very difficult start as team

head coach Bob Milano underwent
triple-bypass surgery Jan. 26, the
day of Cal's season opener. After a
1-5 start, Cal has come on as of late,
securing four victories the last five
times out.
In terms of pitching, Cal (5-6) is
led by sophomore right-hander
Ryan Atkinson (1-1, 4.74 ERA),
who notched a career-high eight
strikeouts in his last start, a 7-2 win
over Long Beach State Sunday.
So as old acquaintances get re
newed this weekend — weather per
mitting — the Cardinal will look to
continue building on its latest run of
good fortune.
Consider this a full-blown dress
rehearsal for the impending and
newly formed Pacific 10 Conference
