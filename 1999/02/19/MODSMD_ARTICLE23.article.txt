## Cal, BYU visit Card 
### Nina Cassidy 
After last Sunday's dominating
win, the Cardinal looks to keep its
momentum going tomorrow when
they host BYU and archrival Cali
fornia in Burnham Pavilion.
MEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Saturday: Stanford (5-2) vs. Cal
ifornia (4-1), Brigham Young (1 -0).
Sunday's win came against two
teams who had already fallen this
season to the Cardinal, Air Force in
the BYU Invitational and UC-Santa
Barbara in the Cardinal Open. This
weekend though the Cardinal will
face two teams who have beaten it
this season, making the match de
cidedly more difficult to win.
"This will be a very competitive
match," said Freshman Adam
Berkenbile. "Both teams are pretty
good; it will be a tough match for us
to win."
However, this meet the Cardinal
will be playing to win. This season
they have increased the initial diffi
culty of their routines. Head Coach
Sadao Hamada is hoping that at the

end of the season the team will be
able to perform and land more diffi
cult routines.
While this strategy is beneficial in
the long run, Cardinal gymnasts
have been having trouble landing
many of the routines. This weekend
the team will not perform their most
difficult routines, but will rely in
stead on ones that are more conven
tional. Coaches are hoping that this
will pay off in the short term with a
much-desired win.
Stanford's loss to BYU came two
weeks ago, when the Cardinal trav
eled to Utah to compete in the BYU
Invitational. Stanford finished in
second place beating Air Force, but
losing to BYU.
This will be the third match this
season between California and
Stanford. More than a month ago in
its season opener, Stanford fell
211 to then-No. 2 California.
At that point, California had a
three-year, 48-meet winning streak,
and had taken 15 meets in a row
from the Cardinal.
Three weeks later, it was Stan
ford who ended up on top in the
Cardinal Open. The win, by the final

score of 215.15-213.4, put an end to
California's extended winning
streak and hurt the team's rankings.
However, as the result of a win last
weekend, California has again
moved in front of the Cardinal in the
national rankings.
This weekend's meet will be an
opportunity for Stanford to move
ahead of California in the rankings
and for California to avenge the loss
dealt to them in their last meeting
with the Cardinal.
Nevertheless, the losing team can
take heart; this will not be the final
time this season that the two teams
face each other. Next Thursday both
teams will travel to Los Angeles to
compete in the UCLA Invitational.
If the Cardinal hopes to pick up a
win against California, it would be
wise to do it this weekend at Burn
ham Pavilion, capitalizing on the
home advantage. Cardinal gym
nasts have performed remarkably
well in the two meets they have host
ed this season, picking up the win in
both cases. On the road it is a differ
ent story, the team members has
lost the two away meets it has com
peted in this far.
