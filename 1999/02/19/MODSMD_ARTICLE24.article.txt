With only three regular-season competitions left
in the season, tonight's 7:30 p.m. faceoff in Burnham
Pavilion between the No. 10 Stanford women's gym
nastics team (7-2, 2-1 Pacific 10 Conference) and No.
7 Arizona State (4-1,2-1) marks a critical juncture in
the Cardinal's season.
WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
â–  Today: No. 10 Stanford (7-2. 2-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) vs. No. 7 Arizona State (4-1,2-1).
After falling to the unranked Washington Huskies
Feb. 12, the Cardinal needs to prove to both itself and
its competition that last week's performance was a
fluke, that it is still a force to be reconked with in the
Pac-10.
A win over the Sun Devils would do just that.
And while the Cardinal enters tonight's meet look
ing to rebound from a shaky performance, Arizona
State comes in having won 11 of its last 13 matches
and riding the momentum from an impressive win
against then-No. 10 UCLA.
Against UCLA, the Sun Devils set a school record
on the balance beam (49.550) and posted season highs
in vault, uneven parallel bars and floor exercise.
"They've been a strong team the last couple of
years, but so are we," said Stanford senior Katie Fitz
patrick. "It'll be nice to see where we are in the Pac
-10."
Leading the Sun Devils are a pair of junior Ail-
Americans, Elizabeth McNabb and Elizabeth Reid.
McNabb has won the floor exercise in three of ASU's
five meets and is currently ranked first in the nation in

that event.
If Stanford is to challenge the Sun Devils, the Car
dinal will need to be more consistent than it was last
week in Washington. Against the Huskies, the C ardi
nal had to count three falls on the balance beam and
four sub-9.600 scores on the vault.
Perhaps the best thing about last Friday night's
loss was that it was uncharacteristic of a deep Cardi
nal squad that has been solid in every event through
out the season. Coming into tonight's meet, the Car
dinal is ranked no lower than 20th in the nation in all
four apparatus.
Leading the Cardinal in tonight's competition will
be senior co-captain Amy Murakami. Murakami has
been superb on the uneven bars this season and
comes in ranked fourth nationally on the event. A win
on the uneven bars tonight would be Murakami's
fourth in a row.
Besides Murakami, the Cardinal will look for solid
performances from sophomores Jen Exaltacion and
Jenny Wilson.
Last week against the Huskies, Wilson tied for first
place in the vault (9.825) and tied for third place in
both the floor exercise (9.800) and on the uneven bars
(9.750).
A fixture on the balance beam, Exaltacion has
been the workhorse for the Cardinal of late and is be
gining to emerge as Stanford's top all-arounder.
Against the Huskies, Exaltacion took home second
place honors in the all-around competiton, the vault,
and the balance beam.
Senior Tracey Kohl looks to be the Cardinal's best
hope on the floor exercise. Kohl brought home third
place honors in the floor exercise with a 9.800.
With solid individual performaces, Stanford
should attain success this weekend.
