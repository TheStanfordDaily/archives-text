This week, both the men and
women had to cancel games due to
wet conditions at Maloney Field.
Tuesday evening, the women (4-
1-1) were forced to postpone their
match against UC-Santa Cruz until
next week, while Wednesday the
men (2-3) cancelled their match
against the University of British ( o
lumbia.
On Feh. 6, both teams posted
wins at Humboldt University.
Monday, the men's squad hosted
the University of Victoria squad at
Maloney Field. The Canadian rug
gers showed why they are the reign
ing North American Collegiate
Champions in the 63-11 win over
the Cardinal.
"It is always fun to play them,"
said team president Jackson Wa
gener. "They put on a show on the
field for us, and we learn a lot."
The experience will serve the
men well as they head toward the
playoffs. Tomorrow, the men face
St. Mary's.
"Usually they have a lot of big
guys that come at you hard and
strong, and try to beat you up a little

bit," Wagener said.
The match will determine home
field advantage for the playoffs. If
Stanford wins, it will play at home,
but a loss would send the team on
the road.
Being on the road "would be a
lot more difficult both financially
and of course to win," Wagener
said.
The team looks to bounce back
from the early-season struggles that
plagued the young players.
"After the first couple of games,
we straightened out the team a lot,"
Wagener said.
The Stanford women's rugby
squad is looking strong as ever, as it
prepares for three games in the next
five days.
Last weekend the Cardinal de
feated San Jose State in a match that
provided much needed rest to a few
of the key players. Tomorrow, the
women ruggers will host both Santa
Clara and Nevada.
Two games in one day could
prove difficult for the Cardinal
strength.
"Santa Clara is generally pretty
good." said team president Lara
Strauss. "They have a lot of big
[players] that are very strong."
