# Disciplines to join for cosmology lecture
## Panels to debate universal truths 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Some of the world's leading scien
tists and humanists will come togeth
er and explore the possibility of
"finding a common language" this
weekend during the Presidential
Lectures and Symposia's first collo
quium, titled "Cosmologies and
World Views."
The first panel, on "The Begin
ning of the Universe," will be held in
the Science Quad Teaching Center,
Room 20 at 7:30 p.m. tonight. The
second panel, addressing "Distances
in the Universe," will begin at 9 a.m.
Saturday.
TTie final panel, w> ; ,:h will be held
at 2 p.m., will focus on "Temporali
ties of the Universe."

In an interview several weeks ago.
Comparative Literature Prof. Hans
Gumbrecht and Physics Prof. Steve
Chu, a 1997 Nobel Laureate, ex
plained the goals of the colloquium.
One of the topics that will be ex
plored is how the humanities should
relate to other fields.
According to Chu, "there's a
translation process going on" be
tween the sciences and the humani
ties. The scientists on the panels, he
said, "are serious scientists, and they
don't view as part of their career to
connect to the humanities. There's a
disconnect," Chu said.
Although focusing explicitly on
cosmologies and world views, t he col
loquium will address other underly
ing themes, including the role of un
certainty and speculation in the sci
ences and the humanities.
"There is speculation at both
ends," Chu said. "To create new sci
ence you have to wildly speculate and
goof around Progress in science
[requires] faith in what we're doing."
Developments in the humanities,
however, have not always found sci
entific counterparts.
Philosophy Prof. Emeritus Patrick
Suppes cited post-modernism as an
example of a development that "has
currency in the humanities," but not

in the sciences.
"The borders are not stable," said
Gumbrecht. "Lately, there is not a
sense of converging, but rather the
certainty that there's no common lan
guage is disintegrating."
"Why is rock music in English
everywhere? The content is not im
portant. i can't get no satisfaction' is
not necessary to translate," Gum
brecht quipped.
The panels will be moderated by
C'hu/Suppes and Gumbrecht.
Panelists include chemistry Nobel
Laureate Dudley Herschbach, Hei
degger specialist Thomas Sheehan,
Stanford physicist and cosmologist
Andrei Linde, among other interna
tionally renowned scholars.
