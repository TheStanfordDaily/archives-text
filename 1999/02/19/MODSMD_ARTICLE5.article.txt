# Racial tensions grow
## E-mail stirs Law School 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
About 150 law students attended a meeting called by
Law School Dean Paul Brest on Wednesday to discuss
concerns about an anonymous, student-authored e-mail
that attacked African-American visiting Prof. Kendall

Thomas.
The e-mail was sent to Thomas's
constitutional law students and ques
tioned Thomas's legitimacy as a schol
ar, teacher and lawyer. The statement
that brought the issue of race to the
forefront was a comparison of
Thomas to another black professor.
"(There are] no similarities [be
tween the two] other than race and

gender. The comments were offensive to both [Thomas]
and the other professor," said Tonya Osbourne, a first
year law student.
A series of heated and outraged e-mails were ex
changed within the class, resulting in a response from
Brest. In an e-mail sent to students Wednesday morn
ing, Brest condemned the attack on Thomas but de
fended the author's First Amendment right to remain


Thomas
