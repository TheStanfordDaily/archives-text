# Racial tensions grow
## E-mail stirs Law School 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
About 150 law students attended a meeting called by
Law School Dean Paul Brest on Wednesday to discuss
concerns about an anonymous, student-authored e-mail
that attacked African-American visiting Prof. Kendall

Thomas.
The e-mail was sent to Thomas's
constitutional law students and ques
tioned Thomas's legitimacy as a schol
ar, teacher and lawyer. The statement
that brought the issue of race to the
forefront was a comparison of
Thomas to another black professor.
"(There are] no similarities [be
tween the two] other than race and

gender. The comments were offensive to both [Thomas]
and the other professor," said Tonya Osbourne, a first
year law student.
A series of heated and outraged e-mails were ex
changed within the class, resulting in a response from
Brest. In an e-mail sent to students Wednesday morn
ing, Brest condemned the attack on Thomas but de
fended the author's First Amendment right to remain


Thomas
anonymous.
Law student Dominique Day said
it was Brest's "weak response" that
further inflamed the students. "He
defended the anonymous hate
speech and refused to address that
[the author] was inflicting racist ha
rassment," Day said.
The defense of the author's
anonymity angered students, who ac
cused the author of violating Univer
sity policy with regards to using Le
land e-mail accounts.
"(Brest's defense] is placing the
right to anonymity over the rights of
professors and students," Day said.
Wednesday's meeting did little to
relieve students' anger and outrage.
"Brest didn't take a strong stance ...
he never gave any thought to the fact
that an attack on a professor because
of his skin color is an attack to all,"

Day said. "[Brest's reaction] was
quiet tolerance for bigotry."
Students said that Brest's com
ments dismissed the issue. Brest was
unavailable for comment.
"This is a very collegia! communi
ty, full of really nice people," Os
bourne said. "That makes it more dis
turbing that students can so glibly at
tack a black professor."
Day said this sort of situation
"never happens to white professors."
Thomas's only comment on the
issue was that "the e-mail incident
and the aftermath have much more to
do with student life than with rne."
However, according to several stu
dents, when the e-mails were first
brought to his attention he said that,
though something like that had never
happened to him before, he knew it
would happen at Stanford.
"This is an inhospitable academic
environment for minorities, and it is a
culture unique to Stanford," Day
said.
