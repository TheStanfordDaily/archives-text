### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
A group of 12 students met with Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Robert Kinnally yesterday to voice

their concerns and criticisms regard
ing the Board of Trustees 1 plans for an
increase in tuition. Both sides said the
meeting was productive.
The students raised three main
concerns in their meeting with Kinnal
ly: communication between the stu
dent body and administration with re
spect to tuition decisions, student rep-

resentation on the board when dealing with such issues
and changes in socioeconomic diversity that can result
from higher tuition.
l he group of students gathered in response to an
nouncements made last week by the Board of Trustees.
The board disclosed that tuition, room and board would
rise 3.5 percent for the 1999-2(XX) academic year, from
$29,K79 to $30,939, the same percentage increase as last
year.
Also, the board voted to allocate an extra $S(X),(XX)
for financial aid, in addition to a budgeted increase to


Kinnally
cover the full costs of the financial aid
program.
Cynthia Hartley, director of stu
dent awards for the financial aid of
fice, was also on hand at the meeting.
According to senior Sarah Faye
McMullen, the group was aiming to
communicate student dissatisfaction
to Kinnally during the hour-long
meeting.
"As a representative of the stu
dent voice, we wanted to let him
know that students a not happy
with the tuition mere? e," she said.
"Ultimately, it's not his decision, but
he has a strong voice with the Board
of Trustees."
Senior Laura Jean Torgerson, an
other member of the student group,
said Kinnally was attentive to their
concerns.
"He was taking a lot of notes, and
he definitely put forth answers to a lot
of the issues we raised," she said.
The students described their un
happiness with a lack of student in
volvement in decisions about tuition
increases.
"When the Board of Trustees
deals with this issue, there is no for
mal student representation in the de
cision-making process," McMullen
said.
However, Kinnally said he would
like to make students more aware of
their existing forms of representa
tion, referring to the three student
representative slots on the Faculty
Senate's Committee for Undergrad
uate Affairs and Financial Aid.
"Students need to know that their

voice is on CUAFA," he said.
Hartley concurred. "CUAFA is
probably the best arena for students
to, first of all, understand what's
going on in the area of financial aid
and, secondly, to have an impact on
these decisions," she said.
Another sentiment expressed by
the group was their fear that higher
tuition rates will diminish the socioe
conomic diversity at Stanford.
The group reported concerns that
prospective students from less privi
leged backgrounds may be discour
aged from enrolling by the high fees.
Hartley attempted to reassure the
students. "I think the role of financial
aid is to try to make sure that that
doesn't happen. Our program has
been good at making sure that we do
have students from a broad socioeco
nomic spectrum," Hartley said.
Overall, Kinnally called the meet
ing "very productive," and said, "It
was great to hear from students about
what it means to pay for a Stanford
education."
"They raised some very good
questions and ideas, and I will cer
tainly bring them up before the right
administration at Stanford," he said.
"1 left the meeting with a lot of
things to think about, and a lot of
things to share with Vice Provost [for
Undergraduate Affairs James] Mon
toya," he said.
Members of the group also said
they were glad to open up a dialogue
with administration on these issues.
"The lines of communication
were opened with this," McMullen
said. "[Kinnally] is as much on our
side as he can be, and we feel he has
been an important ally and advocate
for us."
