# Autumn overseas applications fall
## 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
Despite a 25 percent drop in ap
plicants over the last two years, the
Overseas Studies program is still
turning away students from its most
popular autumn quarter programs.
Overseas Studies sent out e-mails
yesterday notifying applicants of
their acceptance or denial to the pro
grams of their choice for autumn
quarter 1999. This year the office re
ceived 255 applications, down from
316 last year and 341 the year before.
"We turned away many people,
particularly from the Oxford pro
gram. Many students apply to Ox
ford because it does not have a lan
guage requirement," said Overseas
Studies Director Russell Berman.
However, Berman encouraged
interested students to apply to the
three programs which have not been
filled: Moscow, Berlin and Florence.
The application deadline has been
extended for these programs.

"Students should take advantage
of the Moscow program, where stu
dents with no background in Russian
can arrive a few weeks early for lan
guage instruction." Berman said.
While many students were happy
to receive their acceptance letters,
others realize that they may have to
apply again at a later date if they still
want to study abroad.
The most popular programs have
students on wait lists. Sophomore
Doug Aley, who is third on the wait
list for ()xford, said, "I am a little ner
vous because I may not know until
two weeks before the program starts
whet her or not I get into the program.
It kind of messes with my planning
for the rest of the year."
Applicants for all programs began
the process by attending information
sessions. To apply they submitted
transcripts, a four-year plan of pro
posed classes and a two-page essay.
In the essay, students told how they
would integrate studying abroad with
their academic plans at Stanford.

One applicant, sophomore Dan
Barghelame, described the essay that
got him into the Oxford program. "I
am an Economics major, so I want to
do my tutorial at Oxford on mone

tary policy in Europe." he said.
"Also, I have always planned on
going overseas, and this will be a
chance for me to gain an internation
al view of life."
