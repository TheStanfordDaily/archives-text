And We Want To Hear From You!
At Dolby Laboratories, we're dedicated to improving the quality of entertainment audio. Whether it's movies, music, games,
broadcast, or professional products, Dolby is always a step ahead in developing new ways to deliver state-of-the-art multichannel sound.
We're leading the entertainment industry's move from stereo to surround sound in every medium, from blockbuster films to the
latest computer games. We're looking for great technical minds to work on products for emerging technologies such as:
HDTV audio
Multichannel broadcast sound
DVD audio
Electronic cinema
Interactive surround sound for games
Metadata for broadcast audio
Audio IC test development
Dolby's work environment is unique. We believe that individuals forge technological change-your contribution will shape the future
of audio. The rewards go beyond job satisfaction: Dolby offers an excellent, progressive benefits package; a prime San Francisco location;
a stable, supportive work culture; plus the challenge of working in an innovative think tank environment.
Dolby currently has openings in research and development, product engineering, and licensing applications engineering. For specifics,
