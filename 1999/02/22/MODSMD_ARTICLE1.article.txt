# Brest responds to e-mail
## Anonymous attack 'cowardly’ but legal 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Neither the law nor Stanford's Fundamental Stan
dard are safeguards against acts such as Thursday's
anonymous, racially charged e-mail. Law School
Dean Paul Brest said yesterday. Such "vicious at
tacks," while "cowardly" and "invidious," he added,
are a protected form of free speech.
Controversy erupted last week over the e-mail sent
to students of visiting Law Prof. Kendall Thomas,
which drew negative comparisons between Thomas
and another law professor, both of whom are African-
American.
"What the [sender of the e-mail] did was their legal
right under the law but terribly destructive to the com
munity," Brest said.
California has strict laws that protect freedom of

speech, and the state does not
allow the authors of such state
ments to he punished, Brest said.
"The nature of the e-mail is a
terrible thing to do — but that
doesn't mean we can punish it,"
Brest said. "For all the harm this
kind of speech can do, my commit
ment to free speech wouldn't per
mit punishment of it."

Stanford once had narrow restrictions against cer
tain types of speech, but those restrictions were found
to be unconstitutional. Brest said the interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard used in 1990 prohibited
"facing a person and using racial epithets." That inter
pretation. though, was declared unconstitutional by a
Santa Clara County court in 1995.
Stanford is not unique in ite4fl#bility to punish the
author of the e-mail, Brest said. "I am quite sure that
no major university in country would be permitted to
punish what that student said."
The identity of the author of the anonymous e-mail
has not been discovered. Brest said that it is likelv that
