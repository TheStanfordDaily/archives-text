# Brest responds to e-mail
## Anonymous attack 'cowardly’ but legal 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Neither the law nor Stanford's Fundamental Stan
dard are safeguards against acts such as Thursday's
anonymous, racially charged e-mail. Law School
Dean Paul Brest said yesterday. Such "vicious at
tacks," while "cowardly" and "invidious," he added,
are a protected form of free speech.
Controversy erupted last week over the e-mail sent
to students of visiting Law Prof. Kendall Thomas,
which drew negative comparisons between Thomas
and another law professor, both of whom are African-
American.
"What the [sender of the e-mail] did was their legal
right under the law but terribly destructive to the com
munity," Brest said.
California has strict laws that protect freedom of

speech, and the state does not
allow the authors of such state
ments to he punished, Brest said.
"The nature of the e-mail is a
terrible thing to do — but that
doesn't mean we can punish it,"
Brest said. "For all the harm this
kind of speech can do, my commit
ment to free speech wouldn't per
mit punishment of it."

Stanford once had narrow restrictions against cer
tain types of speech, but those restrictions were found
to be unconstitutional. Brest said the interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard used in 1990 prohibited
"facing a person and using racial epithets." That inter
pretation. though, was declared unconstitutional by a
Santa Clara County court in 1995.
Stanford is not unique in ite4fl#bility to punish the
author of the e-mail, Brest said. "I am quite sure that
no major university in country would be permitted to
punish what that student said."
The identity of the author of the anonymous e-mail
has not been discovered. Brest said that it is likelv that


Brest
the author will remain anonymous.
"There is a lot of buzz in the stu
dent body, and I'm not sure [who
wrote the e-mail]. [We] did every
thing in our power to find out who
wrote the e-mail, but we still aren't
sure."
While neither he nor the law
school can punish the author of the
e-mail, Brest made it clear that he
does not condone the author's
words.
"Serious harm is done to people
of color, men and women when
they are attacked based on their
identities. There is no question that
such attacks make people feel less
welcome, less safe, and feel that
they are in a less hospitable envi
ronment," he said.
Brest revealed that he, too, had
been the victim of an anonymous
written attack.
"An anonymous person accused
me of unconscious prejudice," he
said.
"If a white guy at a job for 11
years can be very hurt from an
anonymous accusation, then it
would be a thousand-fold more
hurtful for Thomas," Brest said.
While the author of the e-mail
cannot be formally punished, Brest
said that the issues raised bv thee

mail can be dealt with through
other channels. "This is not a mat
ter of law; it is a matter of commu
nity We must condemn it and
make it clear that it is not accept
able."
Brest said that he believed he
accomplished these two goals in an
e-mail he sent in response to the
anonymous e-mail:
"In this case, however,
anonymity was nothing but a cow
ardly shield behind which the au
thor launched vicious attacks on a
guest at our school, a current facul
ty member, and a classmate."
"Both because 'racist' is among
the most opprobrious words in the
language and because it gets
bandied about rather casually, I
hesitate to use the word. But there
are aspects of the message that give
rise to deep concerns along these
lines."
"Professor Thomas is among
the most distinguished law profes
sors in the country. He is also our
— and your — guest at the Law
School."
"That does not entail that his
professional activities are any
more immune from criticism than
anyone else's."
"But there can be little hope of
productive critical exchange when
students — or faculty or anyone
else here — descend to invidious
ad hominem attacks."
