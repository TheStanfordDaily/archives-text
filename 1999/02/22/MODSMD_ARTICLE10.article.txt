Oklahoma governor endorses Bush for GOP
WASHINGTON (AP) — Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, chair
man of the Republican Governor's Association, on Saturday
endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the Republican nomination
in the 2(XK) presidential race.
"We have a lot of very good people running, but George has been
elected and re-elected the governor of a country; Texas is a country,"
Keating said during an appearance on CNN.
"He's done an excellent job as governor. He's been able to appeal
to a cross-section of the people. He is a very, very good governor, very
effective."
Keating, who was in Washington for the winter meeting of the
National Governor's Association, said he thought Elizabeth Dole, a
potential presidential candidate, would be "a very good running
mate" for Bush.
"I think a lot of people would be very good running mates. Eliza
beth Dole is very bright, very knowledgeable, has a lot of national and
international experience. But fortunately, we have a lot of good peo
ple," Keating said.
Bush said Wednesday that he was "warming to the task" of running
for president, but neither he nor Mrs. Dole had said they will be can
didates.
Other likely candidates for the GOP nomination include business
man Steve Forbes, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. Rep.
John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, former Vice Pres
ident Dan Quayle and social activist Gary Bauer.
Mexico elects new governors
C'HETUMAL, Mexico (AP) — Mexico's ruling party battled to
keep two governorships in yesterday's elections, with the toughest bat
tle by far in Quintana Roo, where palm trees and turquoise waters
serve as a backdrop for grinding poverty and a booming drug trade.
The Caribbean coast state, where wealthy tourist resorts like Can
cun are located near dirt-poor Maya Indian communities, will test the
Institutional Revolutionary Party's ability to convince voters it can
narrow the income gap and overcome the image of corruption and
authoritarianism that dogs current Gov. Mario Villanueva.
Voters formed short lines at polling places in Chetumal. Turnout
also appeared to be light in yesterday's other race, the gubernatorial
contest in 1 lidalgo state, on Mexico's central plains.
1 he ruling party, known as the PRI. was expected to win easily in
I lidalgo. The Ouintana Roo race between Gaston Alegre of the left
ist Democratic Revolution Party and PRI candidate Joaquin Hen
dricks, a former army officer, was much closer.
The PRI has governed Ouintana Roo since it was admitted as a
state in 1974. At the federal level, the party has held the presidency
without interruption since 1929 and would like to maintain its strength
for the 2000 presidential vote. Earlier this month, it won the gover
norship of Guerrero state but lost in Baja California Sur.
Famed critic dies at 53
CHICAGO (AP) — Gene Siskel fell in love with movies as a child.
Every Saturday the schoolboy Siskel would walk eight blocks to his
neighborhood theater on Chicago's North Side to catch the newest
films with his friends.
But it would be many years before Siskel would make movies his
life's work, giving the world the thumbs-up and thumbs-down film
reviews he and colleague Roger Ebert created.
"1 can't even imagine what it will be like (without Siskel)," Ebert
said Saturday from his Michigan home as news of Siskel's death at age
53 spread.
Siskel's death ended a quiet but strenuous battle against complica
tions that arose after a growth was removed from his brain in May.
At the time of his death, Siskel had taken a leave of absence from
his work not only with the "Siskel & Ebert" television show and the
Chicago Tribune, but also as a film critic for "CBS This Morning" and
WBBM-TV. and as a columnist for TV Guide.
Ebert said Saturday that the show would continue with revolving
guest critics.
Tahoe storm strands travelers
RENO, Nev. (AP) — The latest in a series of powerful weekend
storms dumped up to 2 1/2 feet of snow in the Lake Tahoe area and
caused more major delays for trans-Sierra travelers.
The California Highway Patrol said U.S. Highway 50 over Echo
Summit, southwest of Lake Tahoe, was closed most of Saturday night
and yesterday morning for avalanche control activities.
Tourists jammed the highway after it reopened early yesterday
afternoon, causing a backup of westbound traffic for about 10 miles
from Meyers, Calif., to South Lake Tahoe, Calif.
The CHP reported another major jam — of several miles — for
westbound traffic on Interstate SO in Truckee, Calif. Motorists head
ing over Donner Summit faced delays of up to two hours.
"It's bumper to bumper out there, a real zoo,"' said Sara Olson ol
J&L Food Mart in Truckee. "If you live here, you have to love snow.
But even locals are getting sick of all the snow."
Chains or snow tires were required yesterday on most highways in
the Tahoe area.
In California, avalanche control activities also shut down Highway
<S8 over the Carson Spur west of Kirkwood for most of yesterday. The
highway remained open over Carson Pass with mandatory chain con
trols.
No major accidents were reported.
