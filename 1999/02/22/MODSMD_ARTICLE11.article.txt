RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) — Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, making scant head
way toward a Kosovo peace settlement, said yes
terday that it neither Serbs nor ethnic Albanians
accept the six-nation plan. NA TO cannot carry
through on its threat to attack Serb targets.
With a new deadline set for tomorrow, Serb
negotiators "are not engaging at all" over the
critical question ol whether NA TO peacekeep
ers would enforce the settlement, while the
Kosovar Albanians must still be persuaded to
sign on fully with the plan to give them greater
autonomy in the Serb province, Albright said.
"Some really earth-shaking decisions are
being made, which is why it is difficult," Albright
said on CNN after several hours of talking sepa
rately with each side. "And these are really deci
sions between war and peace and life and death."
Albright, talking to reporters, declined to
explain what was holding up Albanian approval.
In fact, she said, U.S. officials thought the
Albanians had given her a green light on Satur
day.
But other U.S. officials said the renewed
negotiations focused on the Albanians' quest for
independence after the plan's interim three-year
period, and the U.S. refusal to endorse indepen
dence.
And Albright, ruling out any independence
referendum in the agreement, said she was look
ing for a way "the voice of the people" could be
expressed in Kosovo.
But "if this fails because both parties say no.
there will not be bombing of Serbia and we will
try to figure out ways of trying to deal with both
sides." she said.

However. Albright said that if the Albanians
give their total endorsement to the complex plan
— which would give the majority Albanians sig
nificant autonomy but stop short of indepen
dence for Kosovo — and if the Serbs keep hold
ing out. then the Serbs would be attacked.
"As far as the use of force is concerned. I
think that the allies remain united if the situation
is that the Serbs alone are responsible for crater
ing the talks," she said on CNN.
Albright, on CNN. took a sympathetic tone
with the Albanians, saying "their lives are in the
balance." but restated the U.S. opposition to

granting them full independence.
"What we really need to do is to focus on this
interim period, help them to really make sure
that the various instruments that are part of this
agreement that has local elections, local police,
the possibility of schools that teach the Albanian
language ... plus a presidency and a constitution,
that we ought to focus on making those institu
tions real," she said.
The six nations sponsoring the talks agreed
Saturday to extend the deadline they had set for
noon that day until 3 p.m. (6 a.m. PST) tomor
row.
