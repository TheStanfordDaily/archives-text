# Clinton to meet with key Republicans
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Presi-
dent Clinton and congressional
leaders will mark the beginning of
the post-impeachment Congress
with a White House meeting tomor
row. but don't expect much beyond
a shaky image of bipartisan cooper
ation.
Both sides feel pressure from the
public to demonstrate they are deal
ing with the nation's business and
moving beyond the Senate impeach
ment trial, which ended Feb. 12 with
Clinton's acquittal. The White
House session will be the first meet
ing in 19 months between the presi
dent and Republican leaders.
But Republican distrust for Clin
ton runs deep, as do partisan divi
sions on Social Security and tax cuts,
the major issues facing the two sides.
Given the lingering animosity
and the differences on issues, there
is little chance that much will occur
at the White I louse beyond symbol
ic gestures of intent to work togeth
er.
"It looks like something that's
more for show," said Bill ( onnelly. a
political scientist at Washington and

Lee University in Lexington, Va.,
who has studied Congress. "The gulf
between congressional Republicans
and the Democratic White House is
enormous, and not likely to be
bridged by a single meeting."
That distrust was sown in 1995.
well before the start of Clinton's 13-
month-long impeachment ordeal.
Republicans say Clinton used that
year's failed White House budget
talks to create an illusion that he was
working with them but was actually
planning to use GOP proposals on
revamping Medicare to bash them
during his 1996 run for re-election.
The White House has long
denied the allegation. Even so.
Republicans like Rep. David Mcin
tosh. R-Ind., a top House conserva
tive and member of the House lead
ership. says GOP trust for Clinton
just isn't there.
"The fundamental question of
whether you can trust him on any
thing he says will be there," Mcin
tosh said. "Even if he says Til work
with you on Social Security, tax cuts,
education,' nobody would take that
promise to the bank."

White House spokesman Barry
Toiv said Clinton "fully intends" to
work with GOP leaders this year
and next on a range of issues.
"It's going to be up to the Repub
lican leadership to decide if they're
going to work with him or not," Toiv
said. "The American people would
not be particularly pleased by any
suggestion by one side or the other
that they won't work together."
Neither side is likely to show up
with specific new proposals on the
major issues confronting them,
which will leave gaping partisan and
substantive differences to deal with.
The top agenda item is to shore
up Social Security for the pending
retirement of baby boomers. Clin
ton favors putting some money in
government-run investments, while
Republicans want individuals to
control that money. And neither
side seems willing to suggest benefit
reductions or tax increases that
many experts say likely are needed
to buttress the massive pension sys
tem.
Another major split is over tax
cuts, where Republicans want big

ger. broader reductions than Clinton
does. The two sides say they favor
more spending on defense and
improved schools but differ over
details.
The last time Clinton met at
length with top congressional
Republicans was July 15. 1997, as
they wrapped up talks on the bud
get-balancing plan enacted a few
days later. Last year, during the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, there
were no such sessions.
On Feb. 11, 1997, Clinton jour
neyed to the Capitol to meet with
congressional leaders in what both
sides hoped would be a demonstra
tion of bipartisan resolve to address
major issues.
The two sides emerged listing
balancing the budget and five other
topics as their top priorities, and
they appointed working groups to
work on them. Thev did work out a
budget-balancing package and cut
some taxes that year, but the other
matters — including fighting juve
nile crime and helping welfare recip
ients find jobs — were mostly unad
dressed.
