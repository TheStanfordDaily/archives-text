# DeLay investigated for possible dishonesty
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Tom DeLay,
the House Republican leader who led the drive
to impeach President Clinton for statements he
made under oath, now finds himself at the center
of his own controversy over truthfulness.
DeLay got a lot of media attention as he kept
up a steady stream of invective against Clinton.
But now the spotlight has turned and is focused
on the Texan. DeLay is being asked about dis
crepancies between statements he made in a
legal proceeding and in financial disclosure forms
he is required to file as a member of Congress.
"Frankly, it's my opinion he lied to me under
oath." said Gerald DeNisco. the Houston lawyer
who questioned DeLay for a 1994 deposition in a
civil lawsuit filed against the congressman by a
business partner.
The former pest exterminator, whose profile
rose after the former speaker. Rep. Newt Gin
grich, resigned, blames Democrats for critical
media coverage.
"I am the most investigated man in America.
They're trying to bring me down." DeLay, the
No. 3 G()P 1 louse leader, said this month.
Yet the man who repeatedly exhorted Clinton
to provide facts isn't rushing to talk.
Generally loquacious, the majority whip is
brushing off inquiries regarding the lawsuit filed
against him bv a business partner who claimed
DeLay and a third partner were trying to oust
him from a pest control firm.
"We have answers to all of that," DeLay said
in a brief hallway encounter. "It ain't worth talk
ing about."
Aides have been equally tightlipped. Ques
tions about DeLay's business dealings were first
raised by an alternative Houston weekly in 1995
and were resurrected recently by The New
Republic, a liberal-oriented magazine. "These
stories are being forwarded by political enemies

of Tom DeLay. and we choose not to fight them
out in the press," said spokesman Michael Scan
lon.
T he roots of DeLay's current troubles reach
back to that 1994 deposition, taken 10 months
before he got the GOP leadership post.
DeLay, who owned a third of Albo Pest Con
trol, testified that he had not been an officer of
the company for two or three years.
But on congressional financial disclosure
forms filed for several years preceding the depo
sition — and one filed three months afterward —
he listed himself as chairman of Albo's board of
directors. He dropped the title on his 1995
report.
DeNisco, the lawyer, said he believes DeLay
was attempting to limit financial liability by deny
ing he was a corporate officer. DeLay later
retreated somewhat from his claim, saying he
couldn't remember when he resigned.
The spat with former Albo partner Robert
Blankenship, ultimately settled with an undis
closed payment to Blankenship, wasn't DeLay's
first business dispute.
A court imposed a $32,(XX) judgment against
DeLay in 1984 after he stopped making pay
ments to Robert Bartnett for the purchase of
Bartnett's pest control company. DeLay, elected
to Congress in 19X4. didn't report that debt on his
disclosure form.
Business isn't the only arena where the 51-
year-old DeLay has come under scrutiny.
The blunt-spoken Texan, known as "The
Hammer," has had ethical scrapes since joining
Congress. Among them:
•In an affidavit given to House Democrats
last year, a Republican donor said DeLay urged
him to evade campaign finance laws and funnel
more money than legally allowed to a GOP con
gressional candidate in East Texas. DeLay

denied the accusation.
•The House ethics committee investigated
complaints accusing DeLay of granting favors to
his lobbyist brother and demanding campaign
contributions for Republican causes from other
lobbyists. The ethics committee dismissed the
complaints in 1997 but reminded him that House
members are prohibited from soliciting contribu
tions in the Capitol or House office buildings.
