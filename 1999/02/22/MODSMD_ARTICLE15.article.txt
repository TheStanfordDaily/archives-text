City council needs
to remember cancer
center patients

THE PALO ALTO City Coun
cil needs a sense of priorities.
The construction of a new
cancer center at the Stanford Medi
cal Center is an indisputably positive
development for the medical center,
Stanford Hospital and surrounding
communities. But above all, it is crit
ical for cancer patients.
The council wants to stop the cen
ter from being built.
The council has taken issue with
construction on the Stanford campus
in the past. However, blocking the
construction of a cancer center is
clearly not the place to make a stand
against Stanford development.
The need for a new cancer center
is obvious. Current cancer care facil
ities have been characterized as scat
tered and cramped. Existing cancer
treatment technology cannot be
used to its full potential due to the
inadequacies of the buildings, some
of which were built in the 19505.
Physicians do not have enough space
in which to work.
Perhaps most disturbingly, some
children who are cancer patients at
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
must walk past the morgue through
an underground corridor in order to
receive treatment.
Four members of the council cur
rently support a proposal that would
halt any new Stanford developments
on Palo Alto land until a new Gen
eral Use Permit is negotiated for
future Stanford construction. The
cancer center would be built on Palo
Alto land and is not covered by the
current permit.

The council should concern itself
more with the impact of the cancer
center on people who seriously need
it and not on an abstract notion of
Stanford's violation of planning pro
cesses.
The center has been in the works
since 1994 and most of the funding
for it has already been raised. Those
who have been waiting for the new
cancer care facilities should not be
forced to wait because of the obsti
nance of a city council.
Having pursued the permits to
build this cancer center through all
the appropriate channels, the Uni
versity cannot be accused of trying
to circumvent proper planning pro
cedures. Open space advocates who
make that claim join local politicians
in ignoring the real consequences of
opposing a new cancer center.
University officials rightly insist
that the general-use permit negotia
tions are not justification for delay
ing the construction of the cancer
center and will deal with the ques
tion of open space.
We agree with the University.
There is no reason to slow develop
ment of the center.
The city council will put the issue
to a vote on March 1. We urge the
members of the council to cast their
votes conscientiously and keep in
mind the people who can be helped
in their recoveries from cancer.
When developing the unused por
tion of the Stanford campus, the
University has an obligation to the
community to build responsibly.
However, the community has an
obligation to not heedlessly oppose
all Stanford construction and to look
at the impact of its action on more
than the community's open space. It
must consider its impact on people
in need.
