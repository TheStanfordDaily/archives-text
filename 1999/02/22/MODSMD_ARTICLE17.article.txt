## Rethinking the tenure issue 
### 
Mari Webel

Amidst the
most recent
tenure furor, it
seems high time that
something different he
suggested regarding
tenure, labor, affirmative
action and the hiring and

firing of Stanford professors.
Perhaps you noticed a few weeks ago
that the U.S. Department of Labor might
investigate the University on allegations of
discrimination and about the questionable
processes which surround a few recent
tenure decisions. You may have seen and
heard rallies to tenure then-Asst. History
Prof. Karen Sawislak, or been a part of the
"Save Akhil Gupta" protests two years ago.
You may not care at all.
Hopefully assuming that those readers
who fall into the latter category will skip
straight to the horoscopes, I'll proceed.
Remember, we are here to use our profes
sors for all of the knowledge and insight
they can impart and take those things into
the world as assets that can never be com
promised.
As students at an institution which has
historically been the site of great teaching
and impressive scholarship in the humani
ties, sciences and in our professional
schools, we have watched our professors
receive Nobel prizes, Pulitzer prizes and a
variety of yearly teaching awards.
It is hard to ignore the importance of
attracting and keeping great faculty. Not
only is the reputation of the University
enhanced by attracting and employing high
ly qualified faculty, but we, as students, get
a pretty sweet deal. We have at our dispos
al a wide-open field of great teachers and
scholars. Yet quite unfortunately, we
remain alienated from the seemingly mech

anistic process that decides, after seven
years, if a given professor is qualified to
remain at Stanford indefinitely.
By alienation, I mean that students do
not have any real idea how the process
occurs, is run, will end and so forth. If there
is a place where students can have input
before the guillotine falls, so to speak, it is
well encrypted in the by-laws of the Univer
sity.
If students do have a place in the tenure
procedure, they remain uninformed. This is
just as unfair as exclusion. Rather than write
indignant and mournful letters to The
Daily, a particular department or any num
ber of vice provosts of various pieces of
undergraduate education, students need to
have a voice and know that this voice will
not only be acknowledged but respected.
Student feedback is one of the only ways
that the University can gauge the perfor
mance, enthusiasm and efficacy of its teach
ers, and this is an invaluable resource.
This is not to say that either student
opinion or administrative evaluation should
reign supreme in the tenure debate. Stan
ford cannot maintain a reputation as a
teaching institution if graduates leave the
Farm with the memory of shining examples
of one instructional and academic skill after
another denied tenure despite the passion
ate protests of students.
Now, my Math 41 professor shouldn't be
denied tenure because I just don't get opti
mization problems. Neither should my
English professor be denied tenure just
because she has not produced the adequate
amount of literature for the appropriate
journals.
A balance of faculty and administrative
input, well-tempered by the evaluation of
students, is the best way to decide who will
be responsible for carrying on the reputa-

tion of our university as a premier teaching
and research institution.
The voice of students should not be reac
tive, but proactive. Student input should not
come in a flood (please let it be a Hood if the
teacher really matters) of letters to Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper, Provost
Condoleezza Rice or Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Eduction Ramon Saldfvar.
It should come when solicited by the
department or school which chooses to
award tenure to a candidate, because as stu
dents, we really do matter in this process.
For the tenure process to truly include
student input, it must be adapted such that
candidacy for tenure and departmental
review systems leave room for participation
from graduates and undergraduates alike.
The University should not have to ask for
our opinion about a given professor only
when that professor is up for review. Stu
dents should feel welcome to approach
administrators and faculty â€”we need to
break down the barriers that have allowed
the exclusion of the student voice from a
process which greatly effects our education
here.
Departmental and school-based reviews
have functioned well for a very long time,
but the current dispute over tenure, with its
potentially nasty climax in the possible
Labor Department inquiry, seems to sug
gest that some innovation is necessary.
Having a system that seems arbitrary
and largely incomprehensible until a profes
sor is told to pack his or her bags is absurd
and leaves students feeling disconnected
and underrepresented.

Mari Webel is a junior majoring in history.
She will miss Karen Sawislak and Suvir
Kaul. Her column will appear here Mon
days.
