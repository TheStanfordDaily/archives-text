Don't delay cancer center

I have an active cancer called multiple
myeloma and have been treated at Stan
lord Hospital for 5 years. 1 am very much
in favor of the planned new cancer treat
ment and research building. This would be
a tremendous benefit for me and hundreds
of us seeking the best possible treatment
for this deadly disease.
I very much resent these environmental
groups suggesting years of delays in this
process ("Cancer center planning draws
fire," Feb. IK). Maybe they would change
their minds if they got cancer or if their
family members did. It's one thing to be a
bureaucrat sitting on a committee to
restrict development, but it's quite anoth
er to be a cancer patient struggling to stay
alive and needing the best treatment facil
ity possible.
Let's stop this insanity of delays. We're
talking survival here folks.

Silver was wrong about smoking
Since Stanford is a haven for big brains
who know so much more than the average
Bear, Mark Silver should expect to have
anything but the last word on the ridicu
lous subject of happiness as it relates to
smoking.
Silver was right on about one thing:
smoking is bad. Everyone learned this les
son at a young age.
Then a select few of us substituted

Michael Jackson's brand of "bad" to the
"smoking equals bad" equation, and we
learned the next lesson in life's lecture
series: smoking is cool.
Being cool has a direct correlation with
an individual's happiness. Of course smok
ing does shorten one's life.
But it gives you more happiness per
unit-time than the so-called "well-rested"
life that Silver finds appealing. That means
that my life as a smoker has more quanta
of happiness than a non-smoker who is my
age.
For example, Mark Silver's smile in his
column photo conveys the image of a
happy and well-adjusted young man. But I
can smile so much bigger and better than
Silver, donning my pasty yellows for the
world to behold. I am obviously less super
ficial as well, because I don't care that 1
have yellow teeth — I am happy and 1
want to share my unrequited (as opposed
to requisite-whited) love with the world.
Moreover, when I'm dangling a smoke
from my grin-to-grin, I am certainly cooler
than Mark Silver in the way that insult
adds to injury.
Lastly, on the one hand, Arnold
Schwarzenegger served on President
Bush's cabinet as secretary for physical fit
ness, proclaiming the evils of tobacco con
sumption.
Yet on the other hand, some of
Arnold's coolest photos from the early
days depict him with a cigar. This one is a
no-brainer, because we all would much
prefer to be the Terminator than a Repub
lican cabinet member.
The attractiveness of the Terminator's
lifestyle is the deepest human expression

that smoking is cool, even in the face of
the alternative. Hut maybe I've just got
iron lungs like the Terminator, and there's
no one quite as happy and cool as I am, or
Silver needs to be a lot more golden
before we mark his words again ... anoth
er no brainer.

Dining Service effort continues
Last Friday, 60 students met in White
Plaza to protest the mistreatment of dining
hall workers in the implementation of
University Dining Services' Value
Enhancement Program.
Students were protesting the dining
administration's disrespect for workers in
the planning and implementation of the
program.
This included the failure to involve
workers in the re-organization of their
schedules, a disregard for workers' present
needs in renegotiating their schedules and
insensitivity to the damage and havoc the
program, in its present form, is having on
workers' lives.
Protesters then marched through Bran
ner, Manzanita and Wilbur Dining Halls,
where the students chanted and invited
the diners to come along. The dining hall
employees cheered and showed their sup
port for the demonstration. The march
ended at the Dining Services office, where
we met with all five dining service admin
istrators and Keith Smith, Stanford's
human resources manager for labor and

employee relations.
Forty of the student protesters attend
ed the meeting, and five student represen
tatives spoke on behalf of the students and
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition.
We emphasized that, regardless of mis
takes made by any individual or organiza
tion in the past regarding these issues, it
was now time to refocus on the damaging
effects of the program and how to alleviate
them.
We also stressed that, in a university
setting, it is especially important that
employees of all levels be respected and
the university should not be setting an
example of racism, classism or general dis
respect.
We asked them to commit to respecting
their employees. We asked for a meeting
between the union and University with
student observers to ensure that a fair pro
cess takes place.
This proposal was not well-met by the
administrators, but students and union
representatives will continue to pursue the
possibility of creating a more just process.
