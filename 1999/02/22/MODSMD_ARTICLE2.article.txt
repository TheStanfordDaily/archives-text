### Sasha Polonsky Staff writer 
While many universities are eol
laborating on their technology
strategies and budgets, Stanford re
mains a successful maverick.
The improvement curve for new
technology is an uphill slope, often
creating great difficulty for large
scale users like universities. Many
schools have started discussions
about how to address this issue, ac
cording to the Chronicle of Higher
Education last week.

"Technology costs at [Stanford]
are increasing due to a variety of fac
tors." said Andrew Harker, associ
ate director of budget management.
"The needs for information technol
ogy compete with all other areas in
the university."
"Essentially, we have a budget
like any other unit on campus," said
Hob Phillips, director of finance at
Information Technology Systems
and Services. "We have to make
trade-off decisions."
