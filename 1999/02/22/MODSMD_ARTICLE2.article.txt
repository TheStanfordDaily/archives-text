# Schools collaborate on technology budgets
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Staff writer 
While many universities are eol
laborating on their technology
strategies and budgets, Stanford re
mains a successful maverick.
The improvement curve for new
technology is an uphill slope, often
creating great difficulty for large
scale users like universities. Many
schools have started discussions
about how to address this issue, ac
cording to the Chronicle of Higher
Education last week.

"Technology costs at [Stanford]
are increasing due to a variety of fac
tors." said Andrew Harker, associ
ate director of budget management.
"The needs for information technol
ogy compete with all other areas in
the university."
"Essentially, we have a budget
like any other unit on campus," said
Hob Phillips, director of finance at
Information Technology Systems
and Services. "We have to make
trade-off decisions."

attempting to keep University technology similarly up to date.
According to Phillips, technology
spending has increased rapidly,
making it more difficult to plan
costs. Jan Thomson, director of
communication and network ser
vices for ITSS, agreed.
"The university's need for infor
mation technology is just growing by
leaps and bounds," Thomson said.
"Trying to create a financial model
to work by is really hard."
Because so many universities
share the same woes, a survey of
technology expenses of more than
100 institutions began two years ago.
This effort, called the COSTS pro
ject, was intended to offer adminis
trators a look at how other colleges

and universities are classifying their
technology spending, according to
the Chronicle of Higher Education.
According to Smallen, the pro
ject first began as an idea triggered
by frustration with technology in
IW6. Steve Gilbert, moderator of
the American Association for 1 ligh
er Education's technology listing,
complained about computer failure
to an on.ine discussion group about
technology and education.
Gilbert wrote in 19%, "As I've
been suffering the effects of my own
personal 'support service crisis,' I've
realized there are a lot of people
who want the same thing Id 0...
we're willing to pay a premium for
all this, but we'd like that premium
to be as low as possible."
Smallen and Gilbert coordinated
with hopes of starting some discus

sion and movement on the problem
of keeping up with technology.
The project aims to give universi
ties sources of comparison for tech
nology spending at similar institu
tions. It identifies a core of informa
tion technology services that should
be common to most institutions,
publicizes outstanding university
technology programs and develops
benchmarks on a grand scale.
To participate, universities fill
out a survey on technology spend
ing. They later receive results tallied
from about 1(H) universities across
the country.
Although Stanford is not a partic
ipant in the project, the level of
scrutiny in areas of technology ex
penses on campus is quite compre
hensive, according to ITSS director
of finance Phillips.

"We have an extensive and de
tailed accounting process, with ex
tensive cost and budgeting models"
Phillips said. "We understand costs
reasonably well."
According to Phillips, ITSS is
managed like a small business. "Our
responsibility is to project what rev
enues will be, based on revenue
streams from other departments,"
he said.
"Fortunately, what seems to be
happening is that hardware is get
ting cheaper while new technology
gets more powerful," said Phillips.
"As long as we can keep ahead of
that curve, we're fine."
Phillips did add that, as expected,
"there are never sufficient funds for
the demands on the Stanford cam
pus. We just have to make the best
use of what we do have."
