## Frosh / Soph College a dubious proposition

ON THE SURFACE, corporate giant
A I &T and Stanford don't seem to
have much in common. But if you
look at their sales strategies, the two could he
blood brothers.
Just as AT&T now seeks to be the world's
one-stop shopping center for telecommuni
cations customers — bundling telephone,
cable TV and Internet services into one iiber
package — Stanford seems to want to be the
nation's leading provider of undergraduate
housing options.
Not only does the University currently
offer perky pink dormitories, lecherous lake
side property. Row houses, co-ops, academic
theme houses, a self-sufficient apartment
complex and a budding Greek community,
coming this fall it will also sport a brand new
residential college.
While this freshman / sophomore alterna
tive must delight the Office of Admission,
which now has one more way to convince
prospective students why Stanford is just as
good as its Ivy League counterparts (the
granddaddies of residential colleges), this
option shouldn't sit so well with the rest of
the campus. Despite its quite necessary mis

sion of forging a strong faculty-student com
munity, the new college, like the colors blue
and gold, just doesn't belong here.
This may seem reactionary, not unlike the
mantra offered by technophobes: II it's new,
it can't be good. However, the newness of
this program — in fact, its very uniqueness to
this campus — will ultimately limit its poten
tial impact.
If the residential college will be at all
effective in establishing the academic ties
that bind, the college must be, first and fore
most, a residence — a palpable community.
Without some feeling of unity (however
imposed it might be), students wouldn't have
the support upon which to build a lasting
intellectual foundation.
There are several ways residential col
leges can form this sense of community. They
could maintain their own libraries, gyms and
game rooms. They could build friendly rival
ries among other colleges, engaging in athlet
ic contests or co-sponsoring social events. Or.
they could begin a set of traditions, which, at
other universities, seem to involve some sort
of naked ritual in the middle of winter.
Princeton and Yale, for example, do all of

these things.
The new college won't seem to be able to
do any of these things. First of all. the two
dorms made available for the college don't
have the facilities for full-fledged fitness cen
ters or game rooms, and 1 doubt that enough
resources will be leveraged to build
respectable libraries. On the front of the
building, it will say "Residential College,"
but don't expect to look inside and find one.
Moreover, there will only be one college
on campus. While it would seem foolish to
create additional colleges before this one
proves its worth, the lack of a college com
munity doesn't bode well for the lone col
lege's own community. After all, a sense of
belonging often arises from a sense of exclu
sion: I know I belong to College A because 1
don't belong to College B. The college stu
dents won't have any rivals or peers; they will
be alone in an uncharted journey toward
another Res Ed abyss. Their isolation might
form for them a kind of resilient cohesion,
like the one among passengers on a falling
plane. But do we really want to sequester 180
partially clueless underclassmen from the
rest of campus in the name of some nebulous

"community?"
And while we can't fault the new college
for a dearth of tradition — someone must
take the first leap — we must sympathize
with the students until traditions are estab
lished. These may come about quickly or
take quite a while, but regardless of the time
it does take, it seems unfair to subject a por
tion of this campus to uncertainty and isola
tion while this grand experiment is
debugged.
However, let's assume that the college's
mission is fulfilled. Incoming students make
connections with senior faculty. Intellectual
discussions bloom, research projects are con
ceived, office hours are booked for months.
All 180 students have nicknames for each
other. Sounds like a cool place to live, right?
If this academic Utopia is achieved, then
the inevitable problem arises as to who gets
in. Will there be a lottery, a weighted draw,
some kind of application? Fathers will have
to tell their children. "Sorry, son, you got into
Stanford, but didn't get into the residential
college." Res Ed officials have suggested that
those uncertain of their career plans or
desirous of an "honors" experience might be

best suited for the college. Well, that limits it
to just about everyone.
There will be those who can take advan
tage of this formidable experience and those
who can't. So on a basic level, the residential
college creates a mild inequality. The college
students get intense faculty interaction while
the rest get a passing nod from a head aca
demic adviser.
Of course, if the college is successful, then
more can be built. But Stanford, perhaps
fearful of looking too much like its Ivy peers,
would never inundate the campus with resi
dential colleges. After all, despite its poten
tial benefits, not everyone would enjoy this
type of living experience. As AT&T or any
other business could tell you, the last thing
you want to do is limit the number of options,
however poorly conceived, from which your
customers can choose.
But Stanford is a university, not a busi
ness, right?
