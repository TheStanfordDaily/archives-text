MEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Saturday: No. 7 Stanford (22-5.12
2 Pacific 10 Conference) 64, Wash
ington State (10-16,4-11) 58.

The No. 7 Stanford men's basket
ball team did just that Feb. 13 when
it lost a shocker to USC at Maples
Pavilion after a big win against

UCLA earlier in the week.
Seven days later, the Cardinal
found itself in exaetlv the same posi
tion. After handing Washington its
first home loss of the season in a sur
prising 89-57 blowout. Stanford (22-
5, 12-2 Pacific 10 Conference) trav
eled across the state to Pullman to
face the Washington State Cougars,
who sat in last place in the Pac-10.
On paper, the game figured to be
a rout — but the players and coach
es knew better than to expect that.
The Cardinal weathered the
emotional storm of Senior Night at
WSU (10-16,4-11) and avoided a let
down, escaping with a relieving 64-
58 victory,
"You play so well against Wash
ington.and then you look at tape of

the |California]-Washington State
game and you think, 'Oh. man.' be
cause Washington State played
great." said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "You'd like to think
you have a chance to play great
again, but there's no chance in this
league."
Indeed, the Cougars gave the
Cardinal very little chance for a big
win. Washington State head coach
Kevin Eastman started all five of his
seniors and the veteran quintuplet
jumped out to a 7-0 lead.
Stanford countered with a 16-2
run to take a seven-point lead with
less than 12 minutes to go in the first
half, but the Cougars refused to go
away.
Junior forward Chris Crosby, a

regular starter for Washington State,
came off the bench and sparked
WSU with eight first-half points, in
cluding a pair of free throws that
knotted the score at 32 going into
halftime.
Stanford forward Mark Madsen
was an undeniable force in the paint
for the second straight game.
In the span of about four minutes.
Mad Dog scored five points and
hauled in seven powerful rebounds.
"We knew it was going to be
tough tonight," Madsen said. "They
have too many good players and ath
letes. And the fans here are brutal —
they're up there with our Sixth
Man."
In fact, the WSU fans were a kind
of wannabe Sixth Man Club, wear

ing familiar-looking shirts which
were essentially Cardinal red and
sported an iron-on white six on the
front.
Imitation shirts aside, the fans
themselves were for real. And they
were unrelenting.
Early in the first half, Stanford
point guard Arthur Lee had a shot
partially blocked that did not reach
the rim.
The Cougar fans would not let
him forget it, chanting "Air Ball"
every time he touched the ball for
the rest of the game.
Stanford continued to show a lit
tle rust early in the second half, turn
ing the ball over and letting WSU
hang around.
Leading 52-48 with 8:03 remain

ing, the Cardinal appeared ready to
pull away, as sophomore point guard
Mike McDonald stripped the ball at
the free-throw line and took off on a
breakaway.
But WSU forward Kojo Mensah-
Bonsu caught McDonald and swat
ted his layup off the glass. The
Cougars gained possession of the
block and quickly pushed it down
court. Within six seconds. Chris
Crosby had drained a three-pointer
to pull Washington State within a
basket.
Neither team scored for the next
three minutes, though, until a Mad
sen layup ended the drought and put
Stanford ahead 54-50.
