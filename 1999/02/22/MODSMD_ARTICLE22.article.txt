# Women put the hurt on Cougars, 77-54
## 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
On Saturday night at Maples Pavilion,
Stanford proved why its women's basketball
program is consistently among the top in the
country. With support from a host of players,
the Cardinal drubbed the Washington State
Cougars (10-14, 4-11 Pacific 10 Conference)
77-54.
The win keeps the Cardinal (15-10,11-3) in
the hunt for the Pac-10 title and proves that
unlike earlier this year, Stanford is able to
brush off defeat and come back strong.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Saturday: Stanford (15-10,11-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) 77. Washington State (10-14,4-11) 54.

Spurred by stifling defense from sopho
more forward Sarah Dimson, who was start
ing for the first time since injuring her foot in
late January, the Cardinal broke out to a 9-0
lead in the first two minutes.

"I feel good; my foot's doing really well,"
Dimson said. "I feel ready to go, and I'm just
glad that 1 can come in now and play. I'm just
happy to be out there to contribute whatever
it is that we need to the team."

Its my job to try to set the tone with
the kind of urgency we need. If we
want to be in the NCAA tournament
we need to show how bad we want
to be there.'

— Regan Freuen
Dimson wasn't the only sophomore with
strong plav. Sophomore center Carolyn Moos
also logged a huge game, racking up 16 points
and 11 hoards for her third double-double in
four games and her sixth of the year. Moos
was a dominant offensive force inside, posting

up with seeming ease over the much smaller
Washington State defenders.
Moos wouldn't have been able to do much
without good passing by perimeter players.
Junior point guard Milena Flores was dishing
the ball off like a pro, giving out eight assists
to complement her 13 points.
Flores was able to get the Cardinal into a
well-flowing transition game, frequently
bombing the ball upcourt for easy points.
On one play Flores took the ball from
freshman forward Lindsay Yamasaki and
passed it full court to senior guard Regan
Freuen, who was unable to sink her shot from
the right baseline.
Flores flew out of nowhere to grab the of
fensive board, quickly giving it back to Freuen
for the put-in from the middle of the key, and
giving Stanford its largest lead of the first half,
28-12.
Freuen, as consistent as death, taxes and
Cal Ripken, Jr., gave the Cardinal 19 points,
as she was close to 50 percent from three
point land and perfect from the free-throw
line.
"1 have a lot of confidence in my shot right
now, and they're falling for me," Freuen said.
"I think I took some shots that maybe were a
little bit rushed; I could have done a better job
at that, but for the most part I've been getting
open looks."
The Cardinal continued its dominance in
the second half, jumping out to a 20-point lead
by the five-minute mark. Flores had four as
sists during the run, including a pass inside to
Yamasaki, who put the ball in over Cougar
guard Jen Kerns while being fouled. Yamasa
ki sunk the free throw, and the crowd at
Maples was as deafening as it has been in a
long time.
There were only a few pitfalls for the Car
dinal, one being Yamsaki's continued strug
gles from the field. She was only 3 for 11 for
the night, and many of her shots seemed off

balanced and forced.
Last night was only the second
time this year Yamasaki hasn't
started, and her role on the team
may become that of first player off
the bench.
"She's sometimes rushing her
shot a little, and she sometimes
looked off-balance, but I think
Lindsay can help our team a lot;
she does a lot of things for us," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
"Right now maybe she's in a sit
uation where she might not feel the
same amount of pressure."
Stanford's only other troubles
came on the defensive ulass. as the

Cougars were able to grab 19 of
fensive boards. As happened with
Washington, the Cougars often got
two or three shots on their trips
down the court.
Most importantly, though, the
Cardinal showed that it could play
with heart, and unlike Thursday, it
was able to hammer the nails in the
coffin and not allow the Cougars to
resurrect themselves.
"I took that loss pretty hard; 1
don't think our team came out
ready to play like we needed to,"
Freuen said.
"It's my job to try to set the tone
with that sense of urgency we need.
If we want to be in the NCAA tour
nament we need to show how bad
we want to be there. I know I want
to be there, and so I need to set the
