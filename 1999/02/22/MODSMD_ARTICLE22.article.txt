### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
On Saturday night at Maples Pavilion,
Stanford proved why its women's basketball
program is consistently among the top in the
country. With support from a host of players,
the Cardinal drubbed the Washington State
Cougars (10-14, 4-11 Pacific 10 Conference)
77-54.
The win keeps the Cardinal (15-10,11-3) in
the hunt for the Pac-10 title and proves that
unlike earlier this year, Stanford is able to
brush off defeat and come back strong.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Saturday: Stanford (15-10,11-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) 77. Washington State (10-14,4-11) 54.

Spurred by stifling defense from sopho
more forward Sarah Dimson, who was start
ing for the first time since injuring her foot in
late January, the Cardinal broke out to a 9-0
lead in the first two minutes.

"I feel good; my foot's doing really well,"
Dimson said. "I feel ready to go, and I'm just
glad that 1 can come in now and play. I'm just
happy to be out there to contribute whatever
it is that we need to the team."

Its my job to try to set the tone with
the kind of urgency we need. If we
want to be in the NCAA tournament
we need to show how bad we want
to be there.'

Dimson wasn't the only sophomore with
strong plav. Sophomore center Carolyn Moos
also logged a huge game, racking up 16 points
and 11 hoards for her third double-double in
four games and her sixth of the year. Moos
was a dominant offensive force inside, posting

up with seeming ease over the much smaller
Washington State defenders.
Moos wouldn't have been able to do much
without good passing by perimeter players.
Junior point guard Milena Flores was dishing
the ball off like a pro, giving out eight assists
to complement her 13 points.
Flores was able to get the Cardinal into a
well-flowing transition game, frequently
bombing the ball upcourt for easy points.
On one play Flores took the ball from
freshman forward Lindsay Yamasaki and
passed it full court to senior guard Regan
Freuen, who was unable to sink her shot from
the right baseline.
Flores flew out of nowhere to grab the of
fensive board, quickly giving it back to Freuen
for the put-in from the middle of the key, and
giving Stanford its largest lead of the first half,
28-12.
Freuen, as consistent as death, taxes and
Cal Ripken, Jr., gave the Cardinal 19 points,
as she was close to 50 percent from three
point land and perfect from the free-throw
line.
"1 have a lot of confidence in my shot right
now, and they're falling for me," Freuen said.
"I think I took some shots that maybe were a
little bit rushed; I could have done a better job
at that, but for the most part I've been getting
open looks."
The Cardinal continued its dominance in
the second half, jumping out to a 20-point lead
by the five-minute mark. Flores had four as
sists during the run, including a pass inside to
Yamasaki, who put the ball in over Cougar
guard Jen Kerns while being fouled. Yamasa
ki sunk the free throw, and the crowd at
Maples was as deafening as it has been in a
long time.
There were only a few pitfalls for the Car
dinal, one being Yamsaki's continued strug
gles from the field. She was only 3 for 11 for
the night, and many of her shots seemed off
