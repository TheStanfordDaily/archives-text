Championships. Illinois (9-1) went
on to lose 4-1 in the finals on Sunday

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Thursday: No. 1 Stanford (6-1) 5
Oklahoma (4-3) 1.

■ Friday: Stanford (6-1) 5, No. 9
South Carolina (4-3) 1.

■ Saturday: No. 5 Illinois (9-1) 4
Stanford 3.

Even though it was the first loss
for the Cardinal in nearly two years
of matches, the team still remains
positive heading into its rematch
with Illinois this Friday at the Taube
Family Tennis Center.
"You never like to lose, but 1 was
encouraged by our weekend." said
assistant coach John Whitlinger.
"We competed well, fought hard

and our doubles really came
through the last two matches."
The Cardinal advanced to the
semifinals with consecutive wins
over Oklahoma (4-3) and ninth
ranked South Carolina (4-3), both
by a score of 5-1. The team started
the weekend a bit slowly by imme
diately losing the doubles point
against Oklahoma.
"We all came out a little flat in
doubles on Thursday," said junior
Geoff Abrams. "Losing that point
was kind of a wakeup call."
Every Cardinal starter seemed
to raise both his intensity and level
of plav as the team won five straight
singles" matches to beat Oklahoma
5-1. Junior Vijay Sekhon stepped in
at the No. 6 singles spot for sopho
more Alex Kim. Kim had been out
for the previous two weeks with a
stress fracture in his left shin before
playing his doubles match. He was
then rested in the singles to be
ready if needed against South Car
olina.
"Against Oklahoma we all
played solid singles," said sopho
more Ali Ansari. "It was a good
match to open the tournament with
and got us ready for rounds to

come.
It did appear to help, as Kim was
back in the lineup and the entire
Cardinal squad raised its level of
play in the South Carolina match.
The team got off to a very fast start
by convincingly winning the dou
bles point, and continued its domi
nance in singles to close out the 5-1
victory. Ii was in this match that the
Cardinal appeared to play at its best
level of the weekend.
"Against .South Carolina we
showed what we are capable of
when we put it all together." said
freshman K.J. Hippensteel. "We
had some momentum going into
Illinois."
Illinois was able to put a halt on
both the ( ardinal'smomentum and
its -match winning streak, howev
er. In the match Stanford once
again came out strong in doubles
and won that point despite facing
three tough Illinois teams. But the
Cardinal was unable to use its dou
bles victories as momentum as Illi
nois won four singles matches to
close it out 4-3.
The key match was at the No. 4
singles spot where Kim took on Jeff
Laski of Illinois. All five of the other
matches ended early in the third set
of Kim's match, so both teams were
there to look on. It was a close
fought match in which Kim battled
the pain of his sore, tight legs.
Kim played a solid first set and
broke Laski at 4-5 to eventually send
it into a tiebreaker. He was inconsis
tent in the breaker, however, and
dropped the set 7-6. In the middle of
the second set his quads began to
tighten up and he was forced to use

sweatpants to try to keep them
warm. In that set, Laski was serving
for the match at 5-3 and had several
match points before Kim battled
back to break. Kim sent the set into
another tiebreaker and fought off
several more Laski match points in
that breaker to eventually win it 10-
8.
That may have been his last-ditch
effort, however, as by the third set
Kim did not have much left in his
legs. He was defeated 6-3.
Despite its loss, the Cardinal took
many positives out of the weekend
and it also knows it is lucky to have a
chance at revenge against Illinois on
Friday.
