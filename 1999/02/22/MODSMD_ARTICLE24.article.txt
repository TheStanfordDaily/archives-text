Another chapter of the Florida-
Stanford women's tennis rivalry was
written this past weekend. The Car

ferred a different ending to the plot.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Friday: No. 5 Stanford (10-1)7, No,
10 William & Mary (7-1) 1.

■ Saturday: No. 1 Florida (8-0) 5
Stanford 4.

Like Chris Evert and Martina
Navratilova in the 1980s, Stanford
(10-1) and Florida (9-0) have been
the two most prominent power
houses of collegiate women's tennis
this decade. Both programs have
captured several NCAA titles and
boasted several standout stars.
Going into Saturday's dual
match, a semifinal encounter at the
National Women's Team Indoor
Championships at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison, Florida had
won its last 34 matches.
In fact, the Gators' last loss took
place against the Cardinal at the
NCAA Championships final in
1997.

It was a dramatic afternoon as
Florida edged Stanford, 5-4, tying
the Florida-Stanford series at 10
wins apiece.
"It was another Florida-Stanford
war," Florida coach Andy Brandi
said. "Ajiy time we meet it's going
to be a good match, and this was an
other barn-burner."
The Cardinal was seeded fourth
at the tournament, one of the most
important team events of the sea
son, while the Gators were seeded
first.
The singles competition pro
duced several nail-biting encoun
ters. Stanford freshman Marissa
Irvin, the second-ranked player in
the nation, posted an easy victory at
the No. 1 spot, overpowering Flori
da's Whitney Laiho, 6-3,6-2.
Junior captain and ninth-ranked
Teryn Ashley also did well for the
Cardinal, outlasting Florida's Mary
Carlyle White in three tough sets, 6-
4,3-6,6-1.
Then the Gators rebounded with
hard-fought victories at the third,
fourth and fifth singles spots.
Stephanie Nickitas struggled past
Stanford freshman Gabby Lastra, 7-
6 (6), 6-3, while Florida's Jessica
Lehnhoff stopped freshman Lauren
Kalvaria, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. Junior Jen
nifer Heiser fell to 48th-ranked
Gator Stephanie Hazlett in straight
sets.
Eighty eighth-ranked freshman
Keiko Tokuda fought back for the
Cardinal at the No. 6 spot, outwit
ting her higher-ranked opponent,
No. 30 Baili Camino, 7-6 (4), 6-4.
With the match tied 3-3 after the
singles, the doubles became crucial.
The Cardinal's top duo of Ashley
and Irvin squeezed by Florida's
Nickitas / Lehnhoff 8-7, but the
Gators took the remaining doubles
as Florida's team of Hazlett and
Laihobeat Kalvaria / Lastra 8-4 and
Traci Green and White crushed
Tokuda / Heiser 8-0. With those
victories, the Gators captured the
match.
"Coach Brennan told us

throughout the weekend that this
was more of a midterm than a final,"
Ashley said, "so I'm really not dis
appointed with the result."
Florida went on to take the tour
nament crown, battling past Duke
5-4 yesterday afternoon.
While Stanford Head Coach
Frank Brennan might have pre
ferred a tournament victory, over
all, he and captain Ashley were very
proud of the women's performance.
"Everybody fought really hard,"
Ashley said. "I think we scared
them because we can only get bet
ter."
After all, the Cardinal plowed
through their first two opponents,
Arkansas and William & Mary, in
reaching the seminfinals. Moreover,
Stanford's extremely young team
almost toppled the top team in the
nation.
"The freshmen handled the situ
ation so well," Ashley said.
"I was so impressed with how
they played."
