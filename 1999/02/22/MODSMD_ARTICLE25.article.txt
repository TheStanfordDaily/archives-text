## Reeling Card shaken 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
This weekend was a wake-up
call for the Stanford men's volley
ball offense (4-6,3-6 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation).

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Saturday: No. 11 Loyola Mary
mount (3-5, 2-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) d. No. 9 Stan
ford (4-6, 3-6) 15-7,15-0,15-12.

■ Saturday: No. 5 Pepperdine (11-
1,8-1) d. Stanford 15-7. 15-0, 15-
12.

The ninth-ranked Cardinal
dropped two three-game decisions
this weekend in sub-par offensive
performances.
N0.5 Pepperdine (11-1.8-1) de
feated Stanford 15-7,15-0.15-12 on
Saturday night. On Thursday, the
Cardinal dropped a 15-6.15-10.15-
11 contest to llth-ranked Loyola
Marymount (3-5,2-4).
Against the Waves, Stanford
tallied a dismal .163 team hitting
percentage. Eleven Cardinal hit
ting errors occurred in the first
game alone.
But it got even worse during
game two, where the Cardinal was
unable to score a single point.
* As the Stanford offense contin
ued to falter, Pepperdine seized the
opportunity. The Waves recorded
a .500 team hitting percentage dur
ing game two.
Stanford's offensive woes were
only half the story, though, as the
defense was unable to stop Pepper
dine's attack. The Waves recorded
18 digs to the Cardinal's two by the
end of game two.
Game three offered glimpses of
the caliber at which Stanford is ca
pable of competing. Better com
munication and organization en
abled the Cardinal to not only earn
a short lead at the start of game
three, but also to stay competitive
through the remainder of the set.
"Game three is very encourag
ing for us." said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "It was the
first time in the whole weekend in
which we matched our opponent."
Perhaps Thursday's match
against the Lions was even more
discouraging for the Cardinal, be
cause Stanford beat LMU twice
earlier in the season in an exhibi
tion game and its season opener.
Inconsistent play prevented the
Cardinal from threatening LMU at
any point in the match.
"We played well at times,"
Nieves said. "Then, we would have
short bad spells, lose the lead and
were unable to recover."
Stanford will attempt to re
bound from these disappointing
matches later this week when the
team takes on Long Beach State
and USC.
