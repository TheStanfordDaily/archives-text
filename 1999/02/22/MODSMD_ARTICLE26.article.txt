# Conflicts between culture, literature
## Cultural critic Sarlo to lecture 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Beatriz Sarlo, professor of liter
ature at the University of Buenos
Aires and renowned cultural critic
of Latin America, will speak
tonight at 7 p.m. in the Language
Corner.
"I work on the limit that sepa
rates cultural studies and literary
criticism. But my work also deals
with popular culture, mass-media,
and politics," she said.
Sarlo will deliver the second
Presidential Lecture of the winter
quarter. Starting last fall, this lec
ture series has brought several
prominent humanists to campus.
As a literature student at the
University of Buenos Aires, Sarlo
encountered the "conflictive" rela
tionship between culture and liter
ature.
"As a 20-year-old at the Univer
sity of Buenos Aires, I was present
ed a poem [which I found] com
pletely hermetic. 1 discovered for
the first time what was a tense, con
flictive relationship between cul
ture and literature," she said.
In her student days, Sarlo also
pursued her interest in politics
through activism.
"My story is not smooth," Sarlo
said. "Argentina has seen several
dictatorships, each worse than the
one before. People of my age were
left out of the university for years.
"Under democracy, it is easier
to establish a relationship between
politics and the public sphere, but
more difficult to establish a rela
tionship between academics and
the public sphere," she said.
Sarlo and other progressive in
tellectuals founded the journal
"Punto de Vista" in 1978. At that
time, Argentina was governed by a

military regime, rendering such
acts "subversive."
"Politics is in perpetual crisis,
producing and governing crisis. I
was not an exile. It was impossible
to leave the language and the city
that I love, which is Buenos Aires.
I had to live undercover at times —
I lived secretly," she said.
Since that time, Sarlo has writ
ten on Argentina's popular culture
and prominent Argentinean liter
ary figures such as Jorge Luis
Borges.
"In literary criticism, being Ar
gentinean, you cannot avoid
Borges," she said.
In 1988, Sarlo wrote "Una mod
ernidad periferica: Buenos Aires
1920 y 1930," focusing on the
"transformation of Buenos Aires
into a modern urban city," accord
ing to the Presidential Lectures
web site.
As one of the leading intellectu
als in Latin America, Sarlo has
continued her political activism
through involvement in political
campaigns.
"I am so very interested in poli
tics. I have been working very
closely with a woman [Graciela
Fernandez Meijide] who, coming
from the human rights movement,
has won several elections," Sarlo
added.
Sarlo also commented on the
challenges for women, both as
workers and as intellectuals.
"It is harder to be a woman and
an intellectual. During our more
productive years, women have
children .. . and [are made] to
choose between public and private
spheres."
"I want to emphasize that it is
the case for [women who are]
workers and politicians — not just
intellectuals," Sarlo said.
