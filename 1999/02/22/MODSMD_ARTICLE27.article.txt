Last Saturday 2(X) Bay Area stu
dents from 11 high schools gathered
in the Manzanita Dining Hall to de
sign a nuclear reactor and specify a
process for manufacturing yogurt,
among other things.
The students were participating
in the Tests of Engineering Apti
tude, Mathematics and Science, or
lEAMS. The Society of Women
Engineers hosted the Northern Cal

ifornia division of the test, which in
cluded questions on nuclear reactor
design, yogurt production, roller
coaster and windmill engineering.
The purpose of the TEAMS test
"is to introduce high school students
to engineering and to have them get
a feel for math and science," said
sophomore Staci Fujii, co-chair of
the High School Outreach Program
of the Society of Women Engineers.
Fujii and sophomore Tina Young,
the other co-chair organized Satur
day's event.

Held every February and March
at sites across the nation, the
TEAMS test consists of KM) multi
ple choice questions and several
free response questions.
Test-takers have 180 minutes to
work in teams to complete the mul
tiple choice and free response com
ponents, both of which are open
book and open discussion.
The multiple choice questions
are scored the day of the competi
tion to determine local rankings,
while the free response questions
are sent for scoring to the Junior En
gineering Technical Society, a non
profit Virginia-based organization
that supervises the tests nationwide,
to determine the national standings.
Saturday's competition "went
off pretty we 11 ,,, according to Fujii,
who has been planning for the event
since Fall Quarter.
"The participants didn't seem
very stressed" for a three-hour test,
Fujii said, "and they came away
pretty happy."
Evan Ciates, a sophomore mem
ber of the TEAMS group from
Homestead High School in Cuperti
no, agreed. He liked the fact that the
test encourages students to discuss
the problems they solve.
"It involves checking your work
with other people and exchanging
ideas," Gates said, "which is a lot
more fun than doing it yourself."
Al Fuller, the coach for San
Jose's Leland High School team,
said one of the benefits of the test is
that "it allows students to meet
other students with the same engi
neering interests. It also exposes the

students to a contest environment,
giving them an introduction to what
engineering is like. It may even in
terest some of them in an engineer
ing career."
Jonathan Fjelstrom, the Fowler
High School team coach, said that
preparing for the TEAMS test "al
lows students to see how everything
gets together and works together in
various areas of science and math."
Other participants, though, did
not view the benefits of taking the
test in such serious terms.
High-school senior Justin Tan,
who has already accepted a place in
Stanford's Class of 2003, noted that
"free food and free gift bags" are
two of the upsides of participating in
a test like TEAMS.
Jason Hsu. also a high-school se
nior. cited "getting into the Daily"
as another upside.
Both Hsu and Tan are members
of the eight-person team from
Monta Vista High School in Cuper
tino, which took first place in the
varsity division in Saturday's com
petition.
Financial assistance for the event
was wholly provided by several
technology-related corporate spon
sors, including Compaq. Lucent
Technologies. National Semicon
ductor and Synopsys, as well as sev
eral Stanford engineering depart
ments.
The Society of Women Engi
neers, which has been hosting the
event at Stanford for several years,
plans to do so again next year. The
only other university in the state to
host the TEAMS test is USC.
