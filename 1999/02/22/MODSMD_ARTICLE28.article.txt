# Fewer students use tutoring program

Participation in the tutoring pro
gram at the Women's Center has
fallen dramatically this quarter.
While the program's coordinators
remain optimistic about the pro
gram's future, they are now attempt
ing to improve student turnout.
"The program is still doing well,
but student turnout is lower than it
was last year and we are afraid that a
number of people just don't know
about it. " said tutoring coordinator
Maureen Doyle, a Scientific Com
puting and Computational Math
ematics graduate student.
Compared to last year, participa
tion in the program has dropped bv
half.
Founded last year in collabora
tion with the SURE Escort Service,
the School of Engineering and the
Undergraduate Advising Center,
the program offers students a safe

and well-lit environment for study
ing. Its services have received posi
tive feedback from students and fac
ulty for their peer-oriented compre
hensive approach to tutoring.
The tutoring sessions, which in
clude Math 20,42, and 52, Chemistry
31 and 33, Engineering 14,30 and 60
and Physics 23 and 43, are led by
both undergraduate and graduate
students who have taken the class
before and received a grade above
A-.
Doyle suggested that scheduling
might be the cause of low turnout.
"Stanford is a wonderful learning
environment that provides a lot of
help to students. People get into
their studying patterns in the fall and
we didn't get up and running until
later."
Junior Beth Appleman, a tutor
with the program, said she is con
fused bv the low turnout, since the
program targets broad introductory

classes, schedules sessions right be
fore large assignments, and makes
concerted efforts to publicize itself.
"And there was a big effort last
year to advertise more," Appleman
added. The center increased flier
distribution and began announcing
tutoring sessions after lectures in key
subject areas.
Freshman Allison Hsieh said she
remembers hearing about the tutor
ing sessions in Chemistry 33, but
never attended them. "There is a
designated time on Sunday from 7
p.m. to 9 p.m. when it's offered and it
isn't convenient," she explained.
Freshman Heather Flemming
disagreed. Sunday tutoring is perfect
for her, because it is the day when
she does all her homework. "But I
wouldn't consider it now. I am al
ready in a tutoring program. Maybe
if I had heard about the Women
Center before."
Using such mixed feedback.

Doyle is currently meeting with two
other student project coordinators
to discuss the falling numbers and
come up with ideas that may spark
interest.
The program still emphasizes a
collaborative learning environment
and group learning.
Coordinators suspect that this
strategy may be the problem "Our
goal is to get students studying in
groups and maybe now more stu
dents are forming study groups of
their own," Doyle said.
Next quarter, the center plans to
offer tutoring in Human Biology
and Statistics. With increased adver
tising and additional courses, coordi
nators hope to see a surge in turnout.
If the program is successful, Doyle
stated, word-of-mouth advertising
will improve participation. "Our goal
is to have a collaborative learning en
vironment. We are working on that.
We are sure students will come.
