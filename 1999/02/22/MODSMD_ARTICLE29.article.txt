# SF schools change admission policy

The elimination of San Francis
co's 15-year race-based admissions
system in public schools will give city
officials a year to come up with a new
enrollment formula, but Stanford of
ficials don't expect any significant
changes in the racial diversity of the
students they admit from those
schools.
"I don't see this having a tremen
dous or any visible impact on Stan
ford's admissions policy [concerning
race]," Senior Associate Director of
Undergraduate Admissions Jon
Reider said. "We don't admit high
schools. We admit students."
Reider's comments stem from
the overwhelming concern that ad
mission into top-ranked Lowell
High School will become nearly im
possible for many disadvantaged mi
nority students.
Joan Catelli, a Lowell guidance
counselor, said, "1 do agree [with
Reider] that there probably won't be
any major affect on Stanford's ad
mission of Latinos and African-
Americans from local schools."
Commenting upon its notable
academic environment. Reider said
that Lowell traditionally sends from
four to 12 students to the Farm.
Placed in the top 1 percent of Cal
ifornia's public high schools in a re
cent statewide study, Lowell acts as
the academic flagship of the 62.(XM)-
student district and serves as a major
feeder into Stanford.
Currently. San Francisco schools
must maintain a 45 percent limit on
any racial or ethnic group and a 40
percent limit at magnet schools to
ensure diversity and demographic
desegregation. State funds totaling
$37 million be provided to the dis
trict as it phases out its quota system.
While the change will mainly im
pact economically disadvantaged
African-American and Latino stu
dents who would be given prefer
ence to their first choice schools, the
effects of the settlement will not be
felt until the next school year, ac
cording to Catelli.

Because admission into Lowell is
purely based upon grades and not
upon district boundaries, many fear
that the elimination of the 40 percent
quota will bring about the racial ho
mogenization of the highly regarded
school.
"It would be sad if the new policy
results in a Lowell that's exclusively
white and Asian-American, because
that multicultural dimension to edu
cation would be lost," Stanford
freshman Sherry Yu, a recent gradu
ate of Lowell, said.
Currently, there already is a racial
imbalance in Lowell's enrollment.
African Americans constitute 17
percent of San Francisco's public
school students but just four percent
of Lowell's 2,515 students. Only 11
percent of the school's students are
Latino, while they constitute 21 per
cent of the district's enrollment.
In contrast, Chinese Americans
comprise 28 percent of the district's
population but 43 percent of Low
ell's students.
"Minorities like African Ameri
cans and Latinos make up such a
small part of Lowell's population, so
in that sense maybe Lowell isn't di
verse enough," Yu said. "On the
other hand, I can understand how
frustrating it must have been for Chi
nese students who had the same or
better qualifications than other stu
dents but were turned away just be
cause of the 40 percent racial quota."
Michelle Lee, a '92 Lowell gradu
ate, said. "I can see the concern of a
predominantly Asian population at
Lowell, but I really think that the
city's action to eliminate racial quo
tas eliminates a lot of unfairness in
the admissions process." Lee at
tained her bachelor's degree at
Berkeley before coming to Stanford
to get her master's in computer sci
ence.
Lawsuits brought against the
school district four years ago by Chi
nese American students, who were
denied admission to Lowell despite
their high test scores, were the impe
tus to remove the system of racial
quotas.
