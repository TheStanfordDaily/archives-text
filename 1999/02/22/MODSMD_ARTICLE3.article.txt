# Students challenge dining
## 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
Protesters, chanting slogans and
holding hand-painted cardboard
signs reading "We Value Dining
Service Workers," greeted students
passing through White Plaza on
their way to lunch Friday.
Members of the Student Labor
Action Coalition organized the
protest rally to demonstrate their
opposition to the way in which din
ing service management is imple
menting the Value Enhancement
Program.
The program was developed by
Dining Services in an attempt to re
duce costs while simultaneously in
creasing the quality of food and ser
vices offered.
Students at the rally said that the
rescheduling and changes in work
er location required to institute in
dividually the program have caused
"widespread dissatisfaction"
among workers.
Bobbie Hodges-Betts, the work
site organizer and union represen
tative for the Dining Services em
ployees, urged students at the rally
to investigate individually worker
dissatisfaction.
"You eat in the dining halls. Talk
to [the workers] and see if they like
it," she said.

Hodges-Betts also accused the
management of misleading the
union regarding the extent of the
changes required by the program.
"We were assured schedule
changes would be minimal. Man
agement said that they would meet
one-on-one with disrupted work
ers," Hodges-Betts said.
Instead, there were "massive
changes, instead of minor, individ
ual ones," she alleged.
Jill Shenker, a member of the
student coalition, spoke to the
group after Hodges-Betts. "We
want a diginified, respectful dia
logue between administrators and
workers," she said.
The students then shouted in
unison: "What do we want? Re
spect! When do we want it? Now!"
The group of about 30 protesters
then marched through several din
ing halls. Lindsay Imai noted later
that there was "obvious support
from workers in Manzanita as we
walked through there."
Their route ended in front of the
Wilbur administrative module,
where the meeting with manage
ment was scheduled to take place.
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Dining Services, told the as
sembled students that "we want to
