# Students challenge dining
## 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
Protesters, chanting slogans and
holding hand-painted cardboard
signs reading "We Value Dining
Service Workers," greeted students
passing through White Plaza on
their way to lunch Friday.
Members of the Student Labor
Action Coalition organized the
protest rally to demonstrate their
opposition to the way in which din
ing service management is imple
menting the Value Enhancement
Program.
The program was developed by
Dining Services in an attempt to re
duce costs while simultaneously in
creasing the quality of food and ser
vices offered.
Students at the rally said that the
rescheduling and changes in work
er location required to institute in
dividually the program have caused
"widespread dissatisfaction"
among workers.
Bobbie Hodges-Betts, the work
site organizer and union represen
tative for the Dining Services em
ployees, urged students at the rally
to investigate individually worker
dissatisfaction.
"You eat in the dining halls. Talk
to [the workers] and see if they like
it," she said.

Hodges-Betts also accused the
management of misleading the
union regarding the extent of the
changes required by the program.
"We were assured schedule
changes would be minimal. Man
agement said that they would meet
one-on-one with disrupted work
ers," Hodges-Betts said.
Instead, there were "massive
changes, instead of minor, individ
ual ones," she alleged.
Jill Shenker, a member of the
student coalition, spoke to the
group after Hodges-Betts. "We
want a diginified, respectful dia
logue between administrators and
workers," she said.
The students then shouted in
unison: "What do we want? Re
spect! When do we want it? Now!"
The group of about 30 protesters
then marched through several din
ing halls. Lindsay Imai noted later
that there was "obvious support
from workers in Manzanita as we
walked through there."
Their route ended in front of the
Wilbur administrative module,
where the meeting with manage
ment was scheduled to take place.
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Dining Services, told the as
sembled students that "we want to

have a dialogue, not yell and
scream."
Shirley Everett, associate director
of University Dining Services, Rafi
Taherian, executive chef for Dining
Services, and Keith Smith, manager
of labor and employee relations,
were also in attendance at the meet
ing.
After introducing the manage
ment representatives, Guy began to
make some opening remarks. He
was quickly interrupted by Shenker.
"We'd really like this time to tell
you our concerns because we don't
feel we've been heard," Shenker
said. She then asked him to "sit
down."
Guy did so, although he added.
"Just understand that I'm not
pleased with the way you're ap
proaching this."
Imai, an English tutor for some
Manzanita dining hall workers, said
that the "shifting and bumping [due
to implementation of the program]
has resulted in deleterious conse
quences for most of the workers."
Imai quoted Article IV-A of the
United Stanford Workers Agree
ment. The article gives workers the
right tt) review schedules and to pro
pose alternate schedules.
"It seems, to my and our under
standing. that this has not been com
plied with." Imai continued.
"Your understanding is incorrect,
ok?" Everett tersely responded.
The protesters frequently spoke
of dissatisfaction expressed by em
ployees who participated in the bid
ding system required by the program.

Seniority largely determined which
employees received their highest
choice when bidding for new posi
tions.
Management, however, consis
tently replied that the union had
agreed to this bidding system.
Students conceded that the union
had made a "mistake."
"We're not so concerned with
contractual rights as human rights,"
Shenker said.
The group demanded the renego
tiation of the program's implementa
tion with student monitors present.
The group also asked that the result
ing agreement be sent to dining ser
vice workers for a final vote and that
implementation of the program be
halted until such a vote was taken.
Management did not agree to
meet any demands.
"One of the reasons we were not
able to give you an affirmative an
swer to any of your demands is we're
bound by law to deal with the union
representative," Smith said.
The request to have students
monitoring union-management ne
gotiations elicited Guy's disapproval.
"That's not our policy or our prac
tice. We'll talk about it, but I don't
think that's a good idea," Guy said.
Guy did make one observation
that drew nods from both manage
ment and the students.
"The reality of this program, if in
fact we are going to keep our costs
down, requires change. The question
is, what's the process?" he said.
The Student Labor Action Coali
tion concluded the meeting by assur
ing Guy that they would be involved
in that process, whatever it is.
"You'll be seeing us again as ne
gotiations occur," Shenker said.
