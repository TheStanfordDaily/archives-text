# Alumni trade tales of time in showbiz
## 
### Marie Sotelo Contributing writer 
Last Saturday, a panel of alumni
offered the Stanford community a
look inside the entertainment in
dustry.
The panel titled "Divas, Dramat
ics and Digital FX," was sponsored
by the Bay Area Chapter of Stan
ford Alumni in Entertainment, as
part of the organization's efforts to
bring together alumni and students
to share advice and professional ex
periences.
Hosted by Fanny and Alexan
der's restaurant in Palo Alto, the
event drew a diverse crowd of un
dergraduates and alumni looking
for support and direction. The
restaurant was filled with people
whose interests included theater
production and pop music perfor
mance.
Panelists began by explaining
how their own interests evolved into
careers in the entertainment indus
try.
In 1981 panelist Kip Cranna re
ceived his doctorate in 17th-century
Italian music. He built upon his ex
posure to opera while stationed with
the U.S. army in Naples and com
bined his love for foreign languages
and his musical talent to find a ca
reer with the opera.
Currently a musical administra
tor for the San Francisco Opera,
Cranna coordinates and develops
performances such as "A Streetcar
Named Desire."
After receiving his bachelors in
English, panelist Robert Kelley
founded Theatre Works, a theatrical
company, in 1970. "What makes a
theater work is that it represents the
community," said Kelley, who now

serves as the company's artistic di
rector. He emphasized his compa
ny's efforts to represent the cultural
diversity of the Bay Area.
Panelist Dan Goldman, comput
er graphics supervisor at Industrial
Light and Magic, described his job
as "whatever anyone else doesn't
know how to do." Before receiving
his bachelors and masters in com
puter science, Goldman was in
volved in Ram's Head's student
performances.
"I loved science and technology
and I also really loved arts and
entertainment," said Goldman. He
found a way to combine these inter
ests after interning at ILM in the
summers after his sophomore and
junior years. He has worked on
movies such as "Mission Impossi
ble," "Men in Black," and the up
coming "Star Wars" prequel.
Citing his experiences at ILM,
Goldman commented on the role of
technology in the future of the
entertainment industry. "Not only is
there a need for people who have
knowledge of the technical tools,
but the know-how to create beauti
ful things with them," Goldman
said.
All of the panelists agreed that
technology generates artistic poten
tial in the entertainment industry.
Kelley spoke of technology as "the
frosting on the cake."
"It's like the difference between
a date and a phone call. The poten
tial is just so much greater," he said.
The panelists also emphasized
their support for bringing perfor
mances to a more diversified audi
ence. "The key is not to change the
product but to change your out
reach," Cranna said. He cited the
participation of the San Francisco

Opera in educational and communi
ty outreach programs, including
brown bag opera performances in
unconventional places, such as
schools, corporate lunchrooms and
outdoor parks.
Kelley encouraged students and
alumni to gain professional experi
ence by volunteering and interning
with the many not-for-profit perfor
mance groups located in the Bay
Area. Volunteer help is important
to ensure that the performing arts
expand their depth of experience
and develop new audiences to sup
port the arts and entertainment in
dustry in the future, he said.
SAE encourages such opportu
nities and job placements through
its student services. Headquartered
in Los Angeles, SAE includes more
than 300 alumni and has chapters in
both New York and the Bay Area.
This breadth provides a rich net
work of support for students seek
ing career opportunities.
As SAE's Bay Area Steering
Committee member Gwen Strong

explained, she and fellow members
put together this particular event to
"cover broad strokes of what the
Bay Area has to offer."
The Los Angeles chapter also
brings to campus the popular "Get
ting Started in Hollywood" pro
gram each May to help seniors
break into the entertainment indus
try. In addition to its programming.
SAE also provides a range of free
services to students, including e
mail job listings and a mentor list
available at the Career Develop
ment Center.
Adam Miller, a senior double
majoring in human biology and
music, learned of SAE's services at
a campus liberal arts career fair. A
performer with the campus band
Enamel, he is working toward a ca
reer in music production.
Although he is just starting to use
SAE as a resource. Miller has found
this sort of exposure to be advanta
geous to his professional pursuits.
"You can get a broad-based per
spective of the industry," he said.
