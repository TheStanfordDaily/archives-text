# Gymnasts swing forward in loss
## BYU takes advantage of vault, rings to get past No. 14 Cardinal 
### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
Despite turning in its best perfor
mance of the season, the men's gym
nastics team lost a competitive
home match Saturday to the No. 11
BYU Cougars by a score of 222.15-
222.(X). The margin of defeat, 15-
hundredths of a point, easily made
the meet the closest of the season.
No. 12 California finished a close
third with a score of 221.50.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Saturday: No. 11 Brigham Young
University (3-0) 222.150, No. 14
Stanford (6-3) 222.(XX), No. 12 Cali
fornia (4-3) 221.150, Australian Na
tional Team 1%.2(X).

The No. 14 Cardinal once again
showed drastic improvement, set
ting season highs for total points
scored, surpassing last weekend's
score by almost four points. The
team also set season highs in every
competition but the pommel horse.
The Cardinal finished first in the
floor exercise and pommel horse
but struggled on both the parallel
bars and high bar.
Junior co-captain Jason Katsam
pesonce again led the Cardinal, fin
ishing third in the all-around com
petition with a final score of 55.5 —
also a Cardinal season high. Adam
Berkenbile faltered somewhat from
last weekend's exceptional perfor
mance, failing to place in the top
three in any event.
Like Stanford, BYU performed
below par on both of the bar com
petitions, but was able to capitalize
when Stanford stumbled on the
vault, taking the competition by
four-tenths of a point.
However, it was on the ring com
petition that BYU remarkably out
performed both Stanford and Cali
fornia. The Cougars captured two
out of the top three and three out of
the four finishes, and Cougar gym
nast Courtney Bramweli turned in
the performance of the evening on
the rings, capturing an impressive
score of 9.9. He also won the vault
competition with a score of 9.5.
BYU gymnast Guard Young had
another good match, finishing sec
ond in the all-around, floor and ring
competitions and third in the vault.
But the star of the show was Cal
ifornia senior Alexander Nissen
who once again grabbed the all

around title to remain undefeated
in that event this season. Nissen
captured his seventh all-around
title in a row by winning the parallel
bars and high bar competitions with
scores of 9.55 and 9.65 respectively
and finishing third in the floor exer
cises.
In a losing cause, California
sophomore gymnasts Tal Moscovitz
and Dave Eskilden were also im
pressive. Moscovitz picked up first

place in both the floor exercise and
parallel bars competitions, and fin
ished second in the vault.
Aside from the spectacular per
formance of those three gymnasts,
California performed poorly. In the
end, it was youth and a lack of depth
that brought about the Bears' last
place finish.
With this win over California,
Cardinal gymnasts have topped the
Bears two out of the three times

they have met this season. Califor
nia's win came in the season open
er when the Cardinal lost 214.80-
211.90. The Cardinal went on to
win the next meeting in the Cardi
nal Open by the score of 215.15-
213.4.
California will have one last
chance to claim Bay Area bragging
rights this Thursday when both
schools will travel to Los Angeles to
compete in the UCLA Invitational.
