## I-Hum-ing a different tune 
### Zach Udko Editorial Staff

After nearly two quarters of experimen
tation with the new Introduction to
Humanities (I-Hum) courses offered
through Stanford's Area One Program, the
debate over freshman core education still
lingers. Are students learning as much as
they should? Did the Cultures, Ideas and
Values students work harder? How much
reading is too much or too little?
The following is a list of suggestions for

improving what some may call a ter
minally flawed program:

MAKE LECTURES HAVE NOTH
ING TO DO WITH SECTION
Several of the I-Hum courses have
already experimented with this bold
technique — but it's time to take it
to the next level. Random people
from across the country should be
scheduled to give a lecture on what
ever subject their heart desires.
Topics can range from Fauly Shore
films to enemas to mating practices
of simians. Section leaders can try to
connect the weekly oration with
highly sophisticated themes from
ancient philosophers through over
analyzation.
There is no need for these lectur
ers to be actual college professors, so
long as they have a high school
diploma and can talk coherently.
Wait — scratch the exemptions.
Anyone will do. They can't be any
worse than some of the talent I-
Hum currently offers.

TEAM UP PROFESSORS THAT HATE
EACH OTHER

If the random weekly lecturer proposal
seems a bit too progressive to you, then one
might try this alternative method. Reaserch
is conducted campus-wide to find all the
professors who can't stand one another.
They are grouped to teach a course on a
subject that they couldn't give a hoot
about, and then the fun begins.
Nothing adds more to philosophical
intrigue than a couple of punches and cat
fights in the middle of lecture. Students
will be assigned a side to root for, and part
of their participation grade will revolve
around the level of enthusiastic cheering
and jeering in lecture.

ADD A COMMUNITY SERVICE
COMPONENT
Some Writing and Critical Thinking
courses have added a community service
theme to their curriculum, whereby stu
dents are encouraged to write for nearby
organizations.
Why not do the same for I-Hum?
Stanford students will be bussed into crack
houses and neighboring violent areas in
San Francisco to read their provocative I-
Hum papers in the streets to local inhabi
tants. An effective question and answer ses
sion should follow if time permits.

MAKE IT ALL MORE P.C.
The Area One Program must be com
mended for making great strides in Ihis
area: many of its courses already focus on
"men who challenge social norms and are
destroyed because of their actions." But
there's still quite a ways to go. Shakespeare's
plays, for example, are always quite popular
in the classroom, but as we approach the
millenium, one can hardly consider filling
innocent minds with the politically incor
rect ramblings of a white male! "Othello" is
out for sure. So is "Merchant of Venice" for
that matter. We need to read more plays by
lesbian Albanian Americans who have
Tourette's syndrome. They do exist, and it's
about time that society stopped ignoring
them.

ADD MORE STRANGE STUDENTS TO
SECTION
The Area One Program should take
greater care selecting sections for each
course to ensure that there is always at least
one obnoxious kid in every class. He must
sit right next to the teaching fellow at each
session, always arguing with him about the
accuracy of certain historical dates. It
seems that this student's high school notes
from an ancient civilizations class don't
quite match up with what the teaching fel
low had to say. Whenever someone else
makes an insightful comment, the student

is prone to irritation and will most
likely declare, "How the hell did
you get into this school?"
TEACH MORE WRITING SKILLS
The WCT courses do a stellar job
drilling the fundamentals of expos
itory writing into the nimble
minds of its students.
Weeks are devoted to training
Stanford's elite how to form a the
sis, for example. Why not waste
even more time and units reinforc
ing the same ideals in I-Hum?
Various diagrams and charts
should be included in the I-Hum
course reader to bring these points
home.
Nothing helps a student under
stand more about the formation of
an essay more than the hamburger
metaphor: the buns represent the
introduction and conclusion para
graphs, and the meat and fixings
are the body paragraphs!

SPICE UP THE READINGS

While the course readers vary from one
I-Hum to another, many texts of antiquity
remain constant: Plato, Aristotle, Freud and
Shakespeare, to name a few. These are defi
nitely the right names to read, but often
their canonized titles are chosen in place of
their lesser-known and more intriguing
works.
Instead of Plato's Republic, why not read
his love letters to little boys?
For Shakespeare, how about studying
"Catherine the Great," his tawdry and
visionary play that predicted there would
one day be a Russian queen who would
have lurid liaisons with her horse (100
years before it actually happened)?
Why not ruminate over Freud's child
hood diaries, filled to the brim with juicy
excerpts of lust?


"So basically what Plato is alluding to here is ..
