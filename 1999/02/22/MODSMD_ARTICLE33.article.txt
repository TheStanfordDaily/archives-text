# Back to Farm with new GER
## 
### Bob Gates 
In honor of the coming millenium, the Stanford Biology
Department is teaming up with the History Department to
offer a new, one-time only, GER-fulfilling course for the 1999-
2000 school year which will allow Stanford students to explore
the roots of their beloved university. Tentatively entitled "A
History of the Stanford Farm: How to Milk a Cow," this joint
venture will allow students to have a unique lecture / labora
tory experience not usually found in either of the two respec
tive departments.
The Biology Department will provide the laboratory com
ponent of the course. Initial labs will include basic udder
squeezing skills. By the end of the quarter, students should be
able to actually squirt their classmates with udder milk. Final
laboratory grades will be based on distance and steadiness of
stream.

The History Department will provide the classroom aspect of the course. Lectures will
cover the history of cow milking from the Renaissance era to the modern period of the
dairy farm. Students will learn about milestone achievements in the cow milking indus
try, from the three-legged stool to the mechanized udder sucker. But perhaps most
intriguing will be the course's focus on new research on historical trends in cow psychol
ogy. Students will be able to understand the true feelings of the cow as study after study
reveals the extent to which the Industrial Revolution turned this docile, domesticated crea
ture into a turbine of emotion, as gentle hand-milking was replaced by the cold, hard
metal of an unfeeling machine. Yet somehow the cow perseveres, bolstered by the knowl
edge, as research shows, that its bodily juices are indeed the nurturing breast milk of the
world. Thus, the quarter will end with a world-wide symposium entitled "The Cow as
Mother." Scholars, dairy farmers and milkmen will come from all over the world to offer
their thoughts and philosophies on the subject. In this great spirit of collaboration, the
Drama Department will present a dance interpretation of the Brecht masterpiece "The
Alienated Cow."
Students will also be able to learn, as one professor put it, "what the Stanford Barn was
like before the University turned it into a moonshine distillery."
For undergraduates, "A History of the Stanford Farm: How to Milk a Cow" will fulfill
Area 4B: American Cultures. For interested alumni, a Continuing Studies seminar as well
as a Continuing Studies Travel Escapade are in the works. A yet-to-be-designated, tenured
professor will be leading an alumni / Continuing Studies group to Texas, Ohio and the
Mongolian steppe this summer to follow the footsteps of cow milking development.
