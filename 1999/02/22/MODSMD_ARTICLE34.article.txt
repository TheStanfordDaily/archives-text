# Julfill more than just GERs

### Chiara Smutina 
As I complete my general education requirements, I find myself very much offended by
the system. While 1 must learn about tall, white, western, male contrived areas like math
ematics and applied science and technology, I am not truly getting the wide base of

knowledge I deserve. A Stanford education is now woefully
incomplete; thus I propose new areas to be covered under a
revised system of GERs.
Area 3B should be changed to Canadian studies, eh? How
can we not be concerned with such a large, unprotected bor
der, eh? Courses would include "Annoying Women on the
Radio: Alanis Morissette to Shania Twain" and an in-depth
analysis of the acclaimed television series "You Can't Do That
on Television."

We have to study the 1
humanities, but isn't this an
anthropocentric view of the world? What about other,
more abundant species? I recommend an area called
"Insectology from a Multi-Disciplinary Perspective."
Courses include "Wings in Transition: Bug Collections
from the 19th to 2()th Century" and " 'Antz' vs. 'A Bug's
Life:' Themes and Variations."
They make me learn about the ugly box they call the
computer, but shouldn't I have a working basic knowledge

of things like circular studies
first? Ball bearings are the future

of the global economy. How can a sphere have only one side, yet
go on forever? I must ponder.
And what about booty studies? Classes would include "Big
Booties in Rap Music: Sir Mix-a-Lot to Shaggy" and "Why Her
Butt is Sooooo Big: Environmental and Genetic Explorations."
I eagerly turned to the gender studies area, dismayed to dis
cover the classes only discussed the gender 1 know far too much
about. What about masculine studies, i.e."Meatheads on
Parade" or "Five Magic Spells to Make Your Crush Call Now."
Then 1 can major in Canadian masculine studies.
