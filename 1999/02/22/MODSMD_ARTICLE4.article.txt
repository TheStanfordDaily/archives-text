"I don't consider myself a nerd,"
said Adam Elman, Class of '94, first
place winner in the Nerd for the New
Millennium contest.
"I have mixed feelings about the
word nerd," he added.
Elman, who develops online pub
lishing for university libraries, beat
out approximately 50 other contest
entries. Designed to promote the
launch of a new World Wide Web
site, www.siliconvalley.com. the con
test was held at The Tech Museum of
Innovation in conjunction with the
San Jose Mercury News.
Doug Edwards, who helped the
Mercury News run the contest, said,
"We thought it would be a fun way to
get Silicon Valley dweeby guys and
high tech people interested in a con
test to redefine nerds."
Elman stumbled across the con
test himself. "My folks were in town
and wanted to go to the art museum,
but it was closed. So we went to the
tech museum. We walked in and
there it was,"he said.
After answering 20 computer triv
ia questions, Elman became a finalist.
He then answered six more questions
and completed technical tasks, such
as: "Using Windows 95, reconfigure
the computer to make Netscape the
default browser when you click on
hyperlinks in an e-mail message."
As his reward, Elman won a
$1,000 dollar shopping spree at the
online computer store NECX. He

plans to buy a CD burner to make
CD demos for his band.
The contestants ranged in age and
ethnicity, which. Edwards said, indi
cated that "nerd has become a much
broader term for everyone.''
Despite the diversity of entries,
Edwards stated, "Nobody got I hem
all right. Thirteen and a half was the
highest [score], and we were gener
ous with the grading. We were sur
prised."
Elman said the trivia questions

were not particularly difficult. He ex
plained that he picked up the infor
mation from reading newspapers and
taking a computer history class.
"I've been interested [in technolo
gy] all my life," Elman said. "My dad
is interested in computers." He said
that his family got its first computer
when he was nine years old.
