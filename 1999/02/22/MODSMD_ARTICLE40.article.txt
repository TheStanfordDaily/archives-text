# Baseball doubles up to grab two

### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
The only thing Damien Alvarado
was thinking about was a fastball.
As the junior catcher stepped in
against California freshman relief
pitcher Trevor Hutchinson with two
outs and runners on first and second
in the eighth inning of a 3-3 hall
game, all he wanted was a fastball.

p.m., Sunken Diamond. RADIO:

Adding to the drama was the fact
that Trevor is the younger brother of
former Cardinal starter Chad
Hutchinson, a pitcher for whom Al
varado had caught last year. Lately,
the younger Hutchinson had shown
the ability to get out of big late-in
ning jams like the one that he en
tered yesterday afternoon in Sunken

Diamond.
But all that did not matter to Al
varado; he was already sitting on a
fastball.
He got it, smoking a double into
the left-center field alley that
brought home two runs and secured
a dramatic 5-3 victory over the Ciold
en Bears (5-8). It was the second vic
tory over Cal in three days, Stan
ford's (10-3) ninth straight.
Hutchinson is "a freshman and he
probably doesn't have a whole lot of
experience," Alvarado said. "So I
was ready to hif, the first one, but it
was a little high. But the second one
was a strike right there for me to hit."
Alvarado's double salvaged an
other strong performance by starter
Jason Young. In getting his third win
of the season, the sophomore right
hander threw his second complete
game of the year while striking out a
career-high 10 batters. Despite
throwing 124 pitches, Young
showed no signs of tiring, retiring 10
of the final 11 Cal batters he faced.
"(My arm] felt fine throughout
the entire game," Young said. "I was
getting some quick innings and that
helped me get through the game."

I lis catcher was clearly impressed
with his performance.
"1 thought it was unbelievable,"
Alvarado said. "He gives us a battle
every time he goes out there. He
threw his ehangeup a lot, and it was
his best pitch today. His fastball is al
ways good; it's got a lot of run to it.
But when he's throwing that change
up. it makes it really tough to hit
him."
But this command performance
almost went to waste. Stanford
jumped out to an early 3-0 lead. But
after the first three batters of the
game, Cal starting pitcher Ryan
Atkinson did not allow a hit for the
rest of his start. Cal eventually tied
the game on a balk by Young that
scored sophomore third baseman
Xavier Nady with two outs in the top
of the eighth inning.
"That was a big turn in the game,"
Young said. "But we got it going."
Indeed, Atkinson tired in the
eighth as he walked Hochgesang and
Borchard after retiring the first two
batters of the inning. He gave way to
Hutchinson, setting up Alvarado's
heroics.
"The good thing about [Atkin

son | was that he was throwing two or
three pitches for strikes," Alvarado
said. "He didn't throw his fastball
very much and we're a fastball-hit
ting team. He got us to hit a lot of
ground balls and we didn't hit the
ball very hard. But we've been find
ing ways to win this year."
That was precisely the case in Fri
day night's series opener, a 9-7 Stan
ford victory. Sophomore right-han
der Justin Wayne got the start, but
he did not have his usual pinpoint
control. He entered the game having
walked only three hatters all year, a
total that he matched in less than two
innings. Wayne exited the contest
after five innings and staring at a 5-2
deficit despite notching a career
high nine strikeouts.
Stanford rallied in the bottom of
the fifth, however, scoring five runs
on just two hits. The big hit of the in
ning was a one-out, two-run double
by Borchard that gave Stanford a 7-
5 lead and helped secure Wayne's
second victory of the season.
The fifth inning "was the game,"
Marquess said. "They actually gave
it to us and we took it."
