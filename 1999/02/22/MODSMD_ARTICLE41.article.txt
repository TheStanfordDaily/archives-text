# Taking on the backstroke giants
## The
						Cardinal's Tate Blahnik aims at a Stanford-held American record 
### Rebecca Rettig Editorial staff 
What senior swimmer Tate
Blahnik is aiming to do this year is
not unexpected from someone who
learned how to swim before he
learned how to walk. Blahnik is
striving to break former Stanford
swimmer Brian Retterer's 2(X)-yard
backstroke short-course (25-yard
pool) American record of 1 minute,
40.1 seconds.
At about 13 months of age, Blah
nik took to the water, beginning his
ascent to swimming greatness early.
But not until the age of nine did he
formally join a swim team. It was
originally Blahnik's own idea to

begin swimming, but when his
mother saw his talent and his glee at
winning "little yellow or blue rib
bons," she allowed him more op
portunities to increase his swim
ming ability and put him on one of
the local Houston club teams where
he swam three times a week for half
an hour.
The 6-foot-6 Blahnik was also in
volved with other sports such as bas
ketball, using his height to an ad
vantage. These other sports soon
began to get in the way of swim
practice, which had expanded from
three times a week to every after
noon.
Before he started high school,
Blahnik's family moved to New

York for his father's job. The tallest
swimmer on the No. 1 Cardinal
joined the New Jersey Wave, then
coached by now-retired Frank
McElroy. McElroy was a "distance
oriented" coach, according to Blah
nik.
"[McElroy] really taught me a lot
more about swimming fast. He took
me up to the next level of swim
ming," Blahnik said. Blahnik attrib
utes his distance expertise in back
stroke — one of the more difficult
strokes, stamina-wise — to McEl
roy. Most swimmers do not often do
long-distance training for strokes,
so Blahnik had an advantage over
other backstrokers due to his
unique type of training.

And all this training paid off.
By the summer of his junior year
in high school, Blahnik was being
recruited by the top swimming
schools in the country, including
Stanford. His visit to Palo Alto was
his first recruiting trip. Blahnik re
calls that the trip was a little intimi
dating due to Stanford's history of
outstanding backstrokers such as
Retterer and Derek Weatherford.
as well as Stanford's 11 NCAA
backstroke titles.
"Originally, I didn't really want
to come out here," Blahnik admits.
"I was a little intimidated of the guys
that were on the team. I would be
this little fish in a huge pond."
But when Blahnik arrived, the
weather was beautiful and he found
that he really clicked with the other
members of the team. He also spent
an entire afternoon with Retterer.
At the top of Hoover Tower, Ret
terer sold Blahnik on what the team
and the school had to offer and what
kind of training opportunities he
would have at Stanford. Blahnik
"loved everything" that he heard
from Retterer.
"He is one of the main reasons I
came to Stanford. He is one of the
greatest guys I have ever met,"
Blahnik said enthusiastically. "He
did a great recruiting job on me."
Blahnik, the current reigning
NCAA champion in the 2(X) back
stroke, says that Retterer was not
really a role model, but more of a
motivating force, one of the swim
mers that he always wanted to beat.
"It wasn't that I always wanted to
be like Brian. It was that I wanted to
be faster than Brian in the 200
back," Blahnik recollects.
And now he finally has that op
portunity.
Blahnik wants to start by break
ing the short-course 200 backstroke
American record at NCAAs this
year. At his last home meet ever as a
Stanford swimmer on Feb. 6 against
USC, Blahnik swam 1:42.78 in the
200 back, his fastest time this year,
breaking Weatherford's 1993 pool
record. At NCAAs last year, Blah
nik went 1:41.1, one second off from
the American record, securing his
backstroking prowess. Blahnik con
cedes that he drops about three or
four seconds when he is fully rested
and shaved, giving him the opportu
nity to clock a 1:39 or even a 1:38 at
NCAAs for the record.
Even though attaining the short
course record is a major accom
plishment, it is merely a stepping
stone in Blahnik's swimming career.
Within the next year, he aims to
break the long-course record at Na
tionals and then hopefully break the
world record at the 2(XX) Olympic
Games in Sydney.
"Breaking Brian's record at
NCAAs is a big step for breaking
the long-course record and [Spain's
Martin Lopez-Zubero's] world
record," Blahnik said. "Ever since I
was about 15 and I saw Zubero at
the Olympics, that has been the ulti
mate of my goals: breaking the 200
back world record."
