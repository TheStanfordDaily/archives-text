# Stanford selects online vendor

### Khai Nguyen 
Catching the wave of electronic
commerce technology, the University
has selected an online vendor for
some of its financial transactions.
Stanford chose the Internet Com
merce Services Corporation to pro
vide a safe method of exchanging
credit to facilitate buying and selling
over the Internet.
"We are excited about implement
ing a secure and cohesive approach to
financial transactions processing over
the Internet," Raman Khanna, the
University's chief information officer
said in a statement.
"An important aspect of that is a
reliable and cost-effective back-end
system. This will allow us to focus on
creative ways to utilize electronic
commerce for Stanford University, as
opposed to building and maintaining
the e-commerce platform ourselves,"
she added.
Currently, most financial transac
tions between the University and a
buyer are done manually. A buyer
first sends his or her check or credit
card number to the University de

partment involved. The department
must then deal with the credit and
banking system in order to carry out
the transaction.
ICOMS will provide the option of
carrying out exchanges through the
Internet. It safely handles credit card
numbers through encryption, checks
to see if the exchange is valid and
deals directly with the banking sys
tem.
"The buyer types information into
a browser and the information goes
through ICOMS directly to the
banks. We never see the credit card
number," said Donald Levy, a project
principal at Information Technology
Systems and Services. " This elimi
nates the manual part of the process.
It saves time arid money and elimi
nates the possibility of error. It's a
win-win situation."
Levy is working through the Of
fice of Development to pilot a pro
gram using ICOMS for alumni dona
tions through the Internet. The use of
ICOMS will help the OOD reach
more people, said Levy.
Other departments can use
ICOMS to help ease the registration

for conferences and the selling of
products, according to Sandy Senti,
the director of the Distributing Com
puting Group that helped to make the
deal with ICOMS.

"Any department can use ICOMS
as a way to augment its current
method of taking payment," Senti
said. With ICOMS, "every depart
ment does not have to figure out its
own way of exchange. Departments
can have flexibility in designing its
web sites ... and can provide better
customer service" that goes beyond
the normal business hours.
Some potential ICOMS projects
are web-based payments for parking
permit payments and course registra
tion for Continuing Education and
the Stanford Center for Professional
Development.
The extension of ICOMS toward
the payment of University tuition and
bills will take more work, since the
University must account for ICOMS
service fees, said Senti.
The first ICOMS pilot program for
Internet alumni donations, headed by
Information Systems Delivery and
Support, ITSS and online designer

Multimedia Video Production, will
be out by early spring.
Stanford's decision to use ICOMS
took great consideration. "We looked
at a lot of vendors and models," Senti
said. ICOMS stood out because it was
a cost-effective, secure method that
could complement a variety of de
partment World Wide Web sites and
had a reliable reporting mechanism to
allow the University to track its trans
actions, she added.
"We are proud that one of the
most prestigious universities in the
country has selected ICOMS for its
order management and transaction
processing," said Cliff Conneighton,
CEO of ICOMS.
"Stanford is looking at some inno
vative uses for electronic commerce
in education and we look forward to
working with them to make these
ideas a reality," he added.
However, the program is still in a
"discovery phase," said Christine
Madison, the co-manager of MVP
who is piloting the alumni donations
project. "The future is unknown as to
how well it'll work and what the Uni
versity will do."
