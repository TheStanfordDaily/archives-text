# Agencies have Y2K problems

WASHINGTON (AP) —Fed-
eral agencies are belatedly respond
ing to the Year 2000 computer
problem, and some of the biggest
departments, including Defense
and State, are still lagging behind, a
House expert said yesterday.
Agencies, "are finally getting
around in the last year to really
putting some effort into this," Rep.
Stephen Horn, R-Calif., said in
releasing his seventh quarterly
"report card" on the status of
efforts to what is known as the
"Y2K" problem.
Horn, who heads the House sub
committee on government manage
ment, information and technology.

gave the 24 agencies he has fol
lowed an overall grade of "C+."
That's up from the "D" grade he
handed down last November.
President Clinton has given most
federal agencies until March 31 to
upgrade their computers so there
will not be breakdowns in basic
public services on Jan. 1, 2(XX). Most
older computers use only two digits
to keep track of what year it is. and
could confuse 2(KK) with the year
1900 at the turn of the century,
causing malfunctions and shut
downs.
John Koskinen, head of the pres
ident's Year 2000 Council, and
Horn agreed that about 90 percent

of federal computer systems will be
ready by the March 31 deadline and
critical transportation, defense and
benefits programs will be fixed well
in advance of the yearend.
Horn gave 11 agencies, including
the Social Security Administration
and the Veterans Affairs Depart
ment, either an "A" or "A-" for
installing software that is Y2K-com
pliant.
But he said three departments
— Health and Human Services.
Agriculture and Defense — were
still in the "C" category and three
others — State, Transportation and
the Agency of International Devel
opment — got failing grades.
