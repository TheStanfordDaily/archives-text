While a good idea, the
proposed ASSU split
needs stronger safeguards

TODAY THE ASSU Senate
will consider an amendment
that, if passed, will divide the
organization into two distinct
bodies — one for undergraduate stu
dents, the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate, and another for graduate stu
dents, the Graduate Student Council.
While we support the rationale for
this split, there are a number of issues
that should be considered by the
ASSU senators before passing the
proposed amendment — even if it
means delaying the vote.
The reasons for the proposed split
make sense. It is important that
undergraduates be able to focus on
the needs of undergraduates, and sim
ilarly for graduate students. In doing
so, each group will be able to expedite
change and will have more time to
consider a greater number of issues
that focus primarily on the groups
they represent.
Further, the creation of an inde
pendent graduate student governance
body will foster a sense of enthusiasm
in student government. More gradu
ate students will get involved, and the
new body will reap its benefits.
While the underlying philosophy
behind such a change is positive, we
have several reservations about the
proposed amendment in its current
form.
The amendment does not contain a
sufficient number of checks and bal
ances on the new Graduate Student
Council —safeguards which are an
important part of any democratic gov
ernment. Under the system which
would be implemented, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate would contin
ue to operate under current proce
dure, which is detailed in the ASSU
Constitution and difficult to change.
The Graduate Student Council, on
the other hand, would be largely gov
erned by its own bylaws, which would
be much easier to alter.
Presently this type of system would
not be problematic due to the consci
entiousness and good intentions of
those currently serving on the Coun
cil. But the body may look very dif
ferent in 10 years. Graduate leaders
with more selfish intentions would
have the ability to abuse the organiza
tion for their own benefit.
It is therefore important that the
ASSU Senate consider the addition of
a number of checks and balances on
this new council so that this type of
activity would be prevented.
Perhaps a body with operating pro
cedures similar to the current ASSU
Senate (and that of the proposed
ASSU Undergraduate Senate) would
suffice.
In addition, the proposed amend
ment does not fully address the issues
surrounding membership require

ments and procedures for the new
council. Under the current system,
should the population of the ASSU
Senate fall below two-thirds of its
original size, a special election must
be called to fill the vacancies.
However, the amendment calls
upon the Graduate Student Council
to immediately fill vacancies based on
its own bylaws, which could be
changed to serve the desires of those
in power. This, too, provides little
security against a Council with differ
ent intentions than those of the pre
sent one.
Moreover, the amendment under
consideration does not require the
two separate senates to convene
together each spring when the overall
ASSU budget is under consideration.
ITiis is an important piece of legisla
tion which should be considered joint
ly so that one branch cannot unilater
ally impede its passage.
These considerations are not
meant to stymie student legislators
from initiating change in the present,
but to protect these organizations for
the long term. While it is important
that each group monitor itself, it can
not be expected to be solely responsi
ble for such a sizable task.
Proponents of the amendment con
tend that a major precaution in the
new system allows monitoring of the
legislative process by students though
open meetings and minutes posted on
the Web. But no matter how public
the process is, it still does not fully
protect against any future govern
ment members acting inappropriately.
Most importantly, though, any
action taken by the Senate must take
into account the effects that such a
decision would have on the general
sentiment of both undergraduates
and graduate students. This proposed
system gives a sizable amount of
extra-constitutional control to gradu
ate students which the undergradu
ates will not have. Is this to say that
graduate students are somehow more
responsible participants in student
government than undergraduates?
Do they not need to be subject to the
same checks and balances as other
students?
An equal standard of procedure
must be applied across the board.
After all, both bodies ultimately will
be under the ASSU executive branch,
which may be filled by either an
undergraduate or a graduate student.
Each student is viewed similarly in the
executive branch. Why not within the
legislative branch?
In the end, it is important that all
students feel comfortable with their
governing body. It is our hope that
any amendment passed be sufficiently
comprehensive to address the needs
and concerns of every student.
While we agree with the funda
mental rationale of the amendment
under consideration, we feel that
these issues should be considered in
greater detail before any significant
action is taken.
