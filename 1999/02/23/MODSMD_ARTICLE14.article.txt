# Sprinkle Cool Patience
## An American rite of passage 
### 
IT HASN'T been easy
being a martyr.
I realized this bitter
sweet truth last Thursday,
as I slunk away from a
growing swarm of seniors
congregating in front of
Tresidder, eager to "Party

Like It's 1999" in San Francisco. Hot soy
chai in hand. I turned towards Green
Library when I ran into some friends who
immediately chastised me for not joining in
on the traditional Pub Crawl.
"It's five days too early," I explained
morosely. "I'm not 21 yet."
A round of nods, murmurs and silent
reflection ensued, mostly, I presume, revolv
ing around "the man's" conspiracy to keep
demon liquor out of the hands of its most
ardent devotees. Various ID hijinks were
suggested, until I finally admitted that 1 also
had an eight-page paper to complete by the
next day. My friends, no longer quite as sym
pathetic, wished me luck and continued on
their way towards mixed drinks and merri
ment.
I'll admit it — it's been fun winning sym
pathy for being young, and now I won't be
able to exploit it until my friends start col
lecting Social Security benefits. It's funny
that turning 21 is generally considered the
defining milestone of one's lifetime while
other birthdays tend to fall by the wayside.
Even becoming 18 is looked on with little
more than a shrug — sure, you can finally
get into Club X, but it also means losing
your eligibility to enter cereal box contests.
Though plenty of my high school conversa

tions revolved around alcohol, or the lack
thereof, it's hard to remember any occasion
when I commiserated with my friends over
being locked out of the political process.
Perhaps I was alone in being excited to
turn IS because it would mean 1 was finally
able to vote. On Election Day last year, one
friend of mine admitted that he wasn't vot
ing because he hadn't done any research on
the issues; he argued that it was probably
better for him not to vote. In other words,
his apathy helped democracy by preventing
candidates from winning office thanks to the
votes of the clueless.
It's an attitude that's unusually pervasive
among college students — amateur pundits
argue that individual votes don't matter in
light of the two-party monopoly on power.
This attitude filters into the mainstream
media, whieh concludes that Americans sim
ply aren't interested in the government.
Politicians then use this logic to explain that
what "the people" are demanding is a small
er government.
It would be easier to believe this rhetoric
if it weren't for the fact that more and more
money is being poured into elections every
year, more than $9(X) million for the 1998
process alone.
One might take this as evidence of grow
ing civic commitment if it weren't for the
fact that voter turnout rates have been
decreasing steadily for the past two decades.
Paul Cellucci. now governor of Mas
sachusetts, won his seat with 30 percent of
the ballots of registered voters. Meanwhile,
one businesswoman, when asked about her
family's political donations, replied that she

has decided to "stop taking offense at the
suggestion that we are buying influence.
Now I simply concede the point."
Many political donors, we are forced to
conclude, expect some recompense for their
largesse, and the rhetoric of "smaller gov
ernment" comes to seem like a sleight-of
hand maneuver designed to distract our
gaze from what happens in Washington. By
ignoring our privilege and our responsibility
to vote, young students enable this process
to continue and essentially surrender control
of our government to the special interests
willing to pay the most money.
The answer isn't to hide our heads in the
sand and claim that not voting is for the pub
lic's own good; rather, we might be better off
reading up on the candidates, following up
on the issues and going to the ballot box
ready to make an informed decision. It was
great to see that front-page announcement
last fall announcing a new plan for student
loan refinancing, but wouldn't it be great to
see such announcements every year? By not
voting, our generation discourages the can
didacy of those who share our viewpoints
and our concerns.
In essence, we are abdicating the chance
to make sure that our own special interests
are represented. Anyone who doubts the
importance of elections should recall that
today is the day Georgia voters go to the
polls to elect Newt Gingrich's successor.
