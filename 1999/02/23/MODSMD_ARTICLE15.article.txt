Defending the Law School
Stanford Law School has taken quite a
beating in the press as of late. I am writing in
defense of my alma mater.
A Feb. 15 San Francisco Chronicle article
reflected a concern that a minority faculty
member had been unfairly denied the lead
ership role in a new program at the Law
School.
While I do not personally know the
allegedly slighted individual, the person who
was selected brings to the position a tremen
dous amount of valuable, relevant experi
ence. More to the point, Dean Paul Brest,
and Stanford Law School as a whole, would
be the last to unfairly discriminate against
any minority.
The only group discriminated against at
the Law Schwl, in subtle and not-so-subtle
ways, is the conservatives. Students are often
ostracized for revealing sentiments that may
not be viewed as politically correct. The few
faculty members who are not card-carrying
liberals (and don't get me wrong: some of my
very favorite professors are liberals) find it
necessary to temper the views they express
in order to avoid a student backlash.
Indeed, the "diversity" mantra is so per
vasive at the Law School that, to this day, the
term makes me nauseous (even though I
wholeheartedly agree with its legitimate
goals). The Coalition for a Diverse Faculty,
or whatever they call themselves now, has
consistently proven itself impossible to satis
fy. If the schml newly hired an African
American, a Mexican American and a les
bian, the "Coalition" would immediately
begin to agitate for an Eskimo and an Alien.

As I was mulling over the above, I hap
pened upon a copy of The Daily from last
Friday and discovered the llap over an e
mail critique of a visiting African-American
professor of constitutional law. While I do
not pretend to know the validity of the spe
cific criticisms voiced in this case, the affair is
quite reminiscent of previous situations, one
of which in particular stands out as strikingly
similar.
Some years ago, a number of students
"defected" from the class of another visiting
African-American constitutional law profes
sor in order to sit in on the classes of other
professors teaching the same subject. This
was very unusual behavior for Stanford law
students, and racism was again charged.
If you actually spoke with the students
involved, however, their action was readily
explained. The professor in question was
spending inordinate amounts of class time
peddling his own political and social views,
activity more suited to a noon lecture or an
elective course. These students were merely
attempting to assure that they would have an
opportunity to learn what they knew they
needed to learn.
It is certainly possible that, upon full
examination, these more recent situations
may reflect inexcusable transgressions. My
concern is that there should be at least a rea
sonable airing of the facts prior to the out
break of hysteria that seems to be the imme
diate reaction on this campus to any issue
vaguely involving race, gender, sexual orien
tation or any other "protected" status.
