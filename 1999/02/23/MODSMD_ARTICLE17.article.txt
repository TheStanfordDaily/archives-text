## Swim beats Cal Dual winners lift Card over Bears 
### Rebecca Rettig Editorial staff 
For the No. 1 Stanford men's
swim team, Saturday's victory
against the No. 8 California Bears
(9-2,2-2) was a perfect 10.
A perfect 11 really.
The team (11-0 overall, 4-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) finished off its
regular dual meet season undefeat
ed with 11 wins and with a bang-up
174-121 triumph over the Cardinal's
cross-bay rivals. This unbeaten sea
son is the swimmers' second in a
row, confirming their season-long
top ranking.
"We had a great, great dual meet
season which in this conference, the
best [conference] in the country, it is

very difficult to
go undefeated,"
said head coach
Skip Kenney.
The Cardinal
won 14 of 16
events and had
five dual winners
for the day when
they competed at

the Koret Center in San Francisco.
Senior Tate Blahnik won both
the 100 (48.28) and 200 yard back
strokes (1:43.31), showing that he
was ready to go into the resting part
of the season in preparation to de
fend his NCAA 2(X) backstroke title.
Another senior, co-captain Dod
Wales, continued his streak of big

weekends by triumphing in his usual
victory-studded KM) butterfly and
freestyle with times of 46.81 and
43.89 respectively.

MEN'S SWIMMING
â–  Saturday: No. 1 Stanford (11-0
overall, 4-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
174. No. 8 California (9-2,2-2)121.

Two sophomores also had win
ning weekends. Rob Canales pulled
out victories in both individual med
leys. In the 400, Canales went
3:49.92 and in the 200, 1:48.10. On
Saturday, Canales swam as fast he
did last year when he was shaved
and tapered. Adam Messner won
his habitually strong 2(X) freestyle in
1:38.46, more than one second faster
than Cardinal sophomore transfer
Clayton Jones.
Messner's more important victo
ry r ame in the 2(X) butterfly, an
event he picked up in the middle of
the season in order to make up for
senior defending 2(X) fly NCAA
champion Matthew Pierce's ab
sence due to shoulder surgery.
Messner's time of 1:46.85 brought
him well under the NCAA consider
ation time (1:49.30), allowing him to
take this event as the third of his in
dividual events at NCAAs.
The third sophomore to pull out
two victories in the meet was dis
tance swimmer Jeremv Kane. He


Gustin
won both the mile (15:18.87) and the
500 (4:30.94) freestyles.
But the real story of the victory
showing that Stanford has more
aquatic prowess than the Bears was
not the usual standouts, but more
the "supporting cast" of the team.
Four of the less prominent members
i)l the team had huge performances.
Sophomore Mario Scussel pulled
out a 20.77 in the 50 freestyle, clock
ing his fastest time ever in that event.

Senior Dan Schultz had a similar
performance in the 2(H) backstroke.
Finishing third, Schultz went 1:46.87,
to secure a consideration time for
the March National ('hampionships.
Two freshman also had non-spot
lighted amazing performances
against Cal. Freshman Reid Clustin
qualified for NCAAs in the mile,
right behind Kane, with a time of
15:19.89, his lifetime best in the 1650.
JeffGuymanstood out quietly in the
1(H) free with a time of 45.50.
"We're using the great perfor
mance overall as a spring board for
the last part of our season." Kenney

said.
Overall, Saturday's performance
was the perfect end to an otherwise
solid season, reassuring the Cardinal
of the fact that a repeat champi
onship performance at Pac-10
March 4-6 is well 011 its way to being
sealed.
"Going undefeated is about the
pride of the guys on the team."
Kenney said. "But in the reality of
swimming, being undefeated is
about the momentum of the season
and about a good feeling inside
going into the championship part of
our season."
