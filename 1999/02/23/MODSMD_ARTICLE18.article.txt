# Bears break Card in 14 innings
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
As the frigid night air gripped
Sunken Diamond last night, the Cal
ifornia Golden Bears found a hot
spark in the unlikeliest of places to fi
nally burn the fifth-ranked Cardinal.
Junior Kevin Johnson, who only
three days earlier could not find the
strike zone in a forgettable pitching

performance, stepped in against
Stanford sophomore left-hander
Tony Cogan for his first at-bat of the
season with two outs in the top of the
14th inning.
Cogan was in his fourth inning of
work in this mind-numbing 2-2 ball
game as both teams struggled to find
any way to end this three-game se
ries. In his previous appearance in
this series, Johnson had entered the

fifth inning of Friday's game with a
5-2 lead and promptly walked three
batters and hit one more as the Car
dinal rallied.
This time, however, Johnson al
most literally broke the ice in this
ballgame, driving a one-strike pitch
over the left-center field wall for a
home run that eventually gave the
Bears a stunning 3-2 victory. Stan
ford (10-4) saw its nii.e-game win

ning streak come to an end while
also missing a chance to sweep Cal
(5-8) in this non-conference series.
"We just couldn't get any runs,"
said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "The Cal pitcher did a
great job and really shut us down.
We had a couple of opportunities
that we couldn't take advantage of.
It was a tough one for us to lose."

■ Yesterday: California (5-8) 3,
No. 5 Stanford (10-4)2(14 innings).

Indeed, Stanford mustered very
little offensively in this 4-hour, 21-
minute marathon as Cal starting
pitcher Jason Dennis kept the Car
dinal off-balance early on. The
sophomore left-hander went the
first nine innings, allowing four hits
and only one earned run. Cal fresh
man right-hander Trevor Hutchin
son pitched five hitless innings of re
lief to pick up his second victory of
the year.
Perhaps most startling about
Cal's pitching was how effectively it
shut down Stanford's first five hit
ters. The batters who set the tone for
the Stanford offense — left fielder
Craig Thompson, center fielder Ed
mund Muth, first baseman John
Gall, third baseman Josh Hochge
sang and right fielder Joe Borchard
— went a combined 2 for 26 on the
night with eight strikeouts, four of

those hy Borchard.
As a result, some solid pitching by
the young Cardinal staff went to
waste. Freshman right-hander Brian
Sager made his first start of the year
and he made it count. He went five
innings-plus, striking out six and
walking only one batter while allow
ing two runs. Two batters into the
sixth, Sager gave way to freshman

left-hander Mike (iosling, who pro
ceeded to get out of a bases-loaded,
one-out jam by striking out the next
two batters. He would work into the
l()th, allowing only one hit and strik
ing out eight.
"Both of them pitched well,"
Marquess said. "Sager got a little
tired, but he pitched well, and
Gosling did well. Actually, Cogan
pitched well — the [Cal] guy got one
pitch and he hits it out. Bui 1 was very
pleased with the pitchers."
Stanford tied the game in the sixth

inning on a two-out double by
Hochgesang that scored Ciall from
first base. But the next inning was
when the Cardinal saw its best
chance go to waste. It had runners on
first and third with one out and junior
shortstop Eric Bruntlett at the plate.
On a 2-1 count, a squeeze attempt
went terribly awry as Bruntlett
popped up his bunt attempt to Den
nis. The pitcher then easily doubled
up junior catcher Damien Alvarado
at third to end the inning and drag
the game further into the night.
