# Two worlds collide on the mat
## Zimmerer and Weiner find friendship through fate 
### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
In a small house in Menlo Park,
two wrestlers reside. To look at their
stories, one would wonder how they
ever got there.
Two lives that should have been
separated by the strange faetor of
fate somehow crossed paths to be
come a potent tandem for Stanford
wrestling. Junior Zach Zimmerer
and senior Beau Weiner should not
share the bond of teammates and
friends, but somehow life and twists
of chance have a way of working the
seemingly impossible.
In the small city of Billings,
Mont., Zimmerer began the journey
that would lead him to Weiner and
Stanford success. By the age of four,
he had entered the world of
wrestling. The oldest of four chil
dren. Zimmerer did not have any
guidance that led him to the mat.
However, afternoons spent partic
ipating in soccer, gymnastics and
football — as well as weekends spent
fishing and hunting— fell behind as
Zimmerer's love of wrestling grew.
"Even when I was a little kid, I
played a lot of other sports and did a
lot of other activities, but in my
heart, I always considered mvself a

wrestler," Zimmerer said
While Zimmerer was getting an
early start in the plains of Montana,
Weiner was enjoying the sun of
Northern California just outside
Placerville. In the mix of two older
brothers and an older and younger
sister. Weiner spent his days swim
ming, playing soccer and football
and competing in judo and gymnas
tics. But. in the fourth grade, Weiner
was introduced to wrestling from a
liver given to him by his older broth
er. Rejoined his first wrestling team
and despite losing all his matches in
his first year, he decided to continue
the sport
"I-was horrible at wrestling when
I started," Weiner said. "But it
forced me to work because it did not
come easy for me and I think that is
why 1 value it so much now."
As both entered high school,
their paths seemed to diverge even
more. Zimmerer attended Billings
Central, a small Catholic high school
where the wrestling program was so
undeveloped that the coach himself
had never wrestled. Zimmerer took
control of the program and helped
to organize practice and teach his
fellow teammates the moves that
seem to come so natural to him. As
the dust settled on his high school ca

reer. Zimmerer had won three Mon
tana state titles, was a junior nation
al finalist and was looking ahead to
college.
"My high school was so small and
wrestling was just not that impor
tant. " Zimmerer said. "1 pretty
much had to drive and teach myself
in order to improve."
In contrast, Weiner attended
Ponderosa High, a larger public high
school of 2,(XX) with a firmly estab
lished program and coach who guid
ed him through his fledgling career.
He finished his career taking eighth
his junior year and third his senior
year at the California high school
tournament.
"I could have won four state titles
if I was in as small a tournament as
Montana's," Weiner joked.
As the pair looked towards col
lege, head coach Chris Horpel be
came instrumental in bringing this
duo together. Zimmerer and Wein
er did not consider Stanford until re
ceiving a recruiting letter from Hor
pel. But, Weiner was unable to gain
admittance until his sophomore
year, and after spending a year at
UC-Davis. he joined the freshman
Zimmerer. who signed earlv with

Stanford the same year.
The following year proved fruit
ful as the kids from two different
worlds placed in the top four at Pac
10's to qualify for the 1997 national
tournament in whieh each did not
place. It was also the year the pair
gained mutual respect for each other
and became fast friends. Zimmerer
also qualified last year while Weiner
took a disappointing fifth at Pac
10's. As this season began, the pair
looked towards the same goal: re
turning to Nationals, together.
Even though they may seem as
close as brothers now. the demeanor

they hold on the mat still suggests
they are from two different worlds.
Weiner has a calculating style in
whieh he is determined to work his
specific moves on his opponent, be it
a duck-under or double-leg take
down to bring his foe to the mat. Ile
uses speed and quickness to control
a match on his feet while keeping re
laxed.
"Beau is very explosive," Zim
merersaid. "He is determined to get
the move he wants and works the
whole match to set the guy up for
it."
Zimmerer goes with the flow of
the match, working his opponents'
moves against them, while looking
for gaps in which to shoot a low sin
gle-leg. He dominates the tie-ups

and always looks for a big throw in a
flurry of intensity.
"Zach likes to let the guv know he
is there by working on his head and
usually leaves them a little banged
up," Weinersaid.
On the two different roads the
pair traveled, the one constant was
how much the sport of wrestling has
become a part of them.
"It is one of the biggest things in
my life," Weinersaid. "It has shaped
who I am and my greatest joys and
lowest disappointments are all
grounded in wrestling."
"It defines what I do in all aspects
of my life by showing me true deter
mination and will, " Zimmerer said.
"Wrestling helps me balance all
parts of my life."
