# Two worlds collide on the mat
## Zimmerer and Weiner find friendship through fate 
### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
In a small house in Menlo Park,
two wrestlers reside. To look at their
stories, one would wonder how they
ever got there.
Two lives that should have been
separated by the strange faetor of
fate somehow crossed paths to be
come a potent tandem for Stanford
wrestling. Junior Zach Zimmerer
and senior Beau Weiner should not
share the bond of teammates and
friends, but somehow life and twists
of chance have a way of working the
seemingly impossible.
In the small city of Billings,
Mont., Zimmerer began the journey
that would lead him to Weiner and
Stanford success. By the age of four,
he had entered the world of
wrestling. The oldest of four chil
dren. Zimmerer did not have any
guidance that led him to the mat.
However, afternoons spent partic
ipating in soccer, gymnastics and
football — as well as weekends spent
fishing and hunting— fell behind as
Zimmerer's love of wrestling grew.
"Even when I was a little kid, I
played a lot of other sports and did a
lot of other activities, but in my
heart, I always considered mvself a

wrestler," Zimmerer said
While Zimmerer was getting an
early start in the plains of Montana,
Weiner was enjoying the sun of
Northern California just outside
Placerville. In the mix of two older
brothers and an older and younger
sister. Weiner spent his days swim
ming, playing soccer and football
and competing in judo and gymnas
tics. But. in the fourth grade, Weiner
was introduced to wrestling from a
liver given to him by his older broth
er. Rejoined his first wrestling team
and despite losing all his matches in
his first year, he decided to continue
the sport
"I-was horrible at wrestling when
I started," Weiner said. "But it
forced me to work because it did not
come easy for me and I think that is
why 1 value it so much now."
As both entered high school,
their paths seemed to diverge even
more. Zimmerer attended Billings
Central, a small Catholic high school
where the wrestling program was so
undeveloped that the coach himself
had never wrestled. Zimmerer took
control of the program and helped
to organize practice and teach his
fellow teammates the moves that
seem to come so natural to him. As
the dust settled on his high school ca

reer. Zimmerer had won three Mon
tana state titles, was a junior nation
al finalist and was looking ahead to
college.
"My high school was so small and
wrestling was just not that impor
tant. " Zimmerer said. "1 pretty
much had to drive and teach myself
in order to improve."
In contrast, Weiner attended
Ponderosa High, a larger public high
school of 2,(XX) with a firmly estab
lished program and coach who guid
ed him through his fledgling career.
He finished his career taking eighth
his junior year and third his senior
year at the California high school
tournament.
"I could have won four state titles
if I was in as small a tournament as
Montana's," Weiner joked.
As the pair looked towards col
lege, head coach Chris Horpel be
came instrumental in bringing this
duo together. Zimmerer and Wein
er did not consider Stanford until re
ceiving a recruiting letter from Hor
pel. But, Weiner was unable to gain
admittance until his sophomore
year, and after spending a year at
UC-Davis. he joined the freshman
Zimmerer. who signed earlv with

Junior Zach Zimmerer and senior Beau Weiner back each other up as both friends and teammates on
the Cardinal wrestling team. Both wrestlers are looking to return to Nationals again this year.
