# Greek groups apply for housing
## 
### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
Two sororities and five fraternities have sub
mitted applications to the University for on-cam
pus housing next fall, according to Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe.
The Greek Housing Review Committee is
currently considering these applications and is
expected to make a recommendation to Director
of Residential Education Jane Camarillo by
March 1. On that date the committee will recom
mend which of those organizations should be
housed and where, Howe said. Camarillo will
then deliver a final decision some time in early
March.
Pi Beta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma soror
ities, along with Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Nu.
Sigma Phi Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta and Phi
Kappa Psi fraternities have applied for housing,
Howe said.
Although seven groups have applied, Howe

explained, any number from zero to four could
be awarded housing. Howe pointed to the Greek
Housing Policy, which stresses the importance of
"overall balance in housing options for all stu
dents" and caps the number of housed Greek or
ganizations at between 10 and 12.
Currently there are eight housed Greek orga
nizations on campus.
Defining selection criteria
Unlike the job application process, in which
an employer seeks to fill a vacancy, Howe said
that the quality of the applications is driving the
housing selection process, rather than a need or
desire to fill a specific number of slots.
It is possible, Howe said, that the University
will elect not to house any Greek organizations
this year.
"The intent of the Greek Housing Policy is to
allow groups to apply for housing every year,"
Howe said. "It does not guarantee housing."

Howe said the Committee is evaluating nine
criteria to determine which Greek chapters will
receive housing. According to a Committee press
release, these criteria are "demonstrated com
mitment to the goals of Residential Education,
their past and present conduct history, the
strength of their membership, their financial
health, their house management plan, their par
ticipation in the larger Greek and Stanford com
munity, their involvement in on / off-campus
community service, their alumni involvement
and the strength of their relationship and com
munication with the University administration."
Members of the Greek Housing Commit
tee — made up of Howe and Associate Director
of Res Ed Ann Porteus, representatives from
other housing offices in the University and
Greek and non-Greek students — explained
that in considering whether to house Greek or
ganizations this year, they are seeking more stu-
dent input to determine which
houses would be vacated for those
Greek organizations.
After the University decided to
house the Kappa Alpha Theta and
Delta Delta Delta sororities last
year, many students responded
negatively, complaining that they
felt excluded from the decision
making process. Residents of the
Alpha Sig house expressed particu
lar concern, protesting in White
Plaza after losing their house.
"Last year there was general dis
appointment, anger and disap
proval," said Interfraternity Coun
cil representative Tim Fisher, a ju

nior. "Alpha Sig was the main
issue."
Porteus acknowledged that the
process last year was "not the best
one" and said that although to some
extent the actual selection so far has
been similar to last year's, the Uni
versity is communicating more
openly with students throughout.
Soliciting student input
Last week the Committee spon
sored a series of three focus groups
to discuss criteria for determining
which houses would be given to
Greek organizations, should the
University decided to house them,
Porteus said. More than 60 students
participated in the program, includ
ing representatives from each of the
Row houses, the ASSU and the In

terfraternity and Intersorority
Councils.
Porteus said that the Commit
tee, taking the focus group discus
sions into account, is still working to
establish specific criteria to decide
which Row houses will go to Greek
organizations.
"At this point we still don't
know," Porteus said. "There are all
sorts of possibilities. A lot of rec
ommendations were made, and we
haven't had the chance to digest
them yet."
The focus groups were an at
tempt to open up the process to a
broader group of students in the
most constructive way possible,
Porteus explained.
"There were some who wanted
to open the discussion up to every

one," Porteus said. "It's hard to
have a thoughtful discussion with
100 people in a room. Even in the
groups there wasn't discussion, but
I do think everyone had the chance
to say what they wanted to say."
Members of the Committee ex
plained that the process is particu
larly complicated, because there is
no possible win-win situation
should the University decide to
house any Greek organizations.
"There is not going to be a deci
sion that is going to make everyone
happy," Porteus said. "We are try
ing to minimize the harm. I would
ask any students who are going to
be unhappy with the decision to do
a mini-analysis in their heads.
Someone is going to have to give
something up, and that makes the

process incredibly complex."
Greeks aim to strengthen bonds
The fraternities and sororities
who have applied for housing said
that the application process has al
lowed them a chance to reevaluate
their organizations.
"We have thought a lot about
why it is we want a house," said Sig
Ep president Ted Leng, a senior.
"We have never been housed be
fore, but as a chapter we feel it is
time to move on and get a house."
Leng said the Sig Eps applied for
a house last year and were denied,
but said he believes this year's ap
plication is stronger and that the
fraternity is committed to getting a
house.

"I think that last year we were
not as dedicated as we are this year
to getting a house," Leng said. "The
chapter is really set in getting a
house in the next two to three
years."
The unhoused Greek organiza
tions also said they think that get
ting housing would increase group
solidarity. Pi Phi president Tara
Hale, a junior, said that she felt ap
plying for the house was a unifying
force within the sorority.
"Our primary reason for apply
ing was because of greater accessi
bility ... to each other's company,
contact with each other, friendship
and support, all things that the
sorority stands for now, but would
be made stronger with a house,"
Hale said.
Two sororities and five fraternities have sub
