### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
Two sororities and five fraternities have sub
mitted applications to the University for on-cam
pus housing next fall, according to Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe.
The Greek Housing Review Committee is
currently considering these applications and is
expected to make a recommendation to Director
of Residential Education Jane Camarillo by
March 1. On that date the committee will recom
mend which of those organizations should be
housed and where, Howe said. Camarillo will
then deliver a final decision some time in early
March.
Pi Beta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma soror
ities, along with Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Nu.
Sigma Phi Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta and Phi
Kappa Psi fraternities have applied for housing,
Howe said.
Although seven groups have applied, Howe

explained, any number from zero to four could
be awarded housing. Howe pointed to the Greek
Housing Policy, which stresses the importance of
"overall balance in housing options for all stu
dents" and caps the number of housed Greek or
ganizations at between 10 and 12.
Currently there are eight housed Greek orga
nizations on campus.
Defining selection criteria
Unlike the job application process, in which
an employer seeks to fill a vacancy, Howe said
that the quality of the applications is driving the
housing selection process, rather than a need or
desire to fill a specific number of slots.
It is possible, Howe said, that the University
will elect not to house any Greek organizations
this year.
"The intent of the Greek Housing Policy is to
allow groups to apply for housing every year,"
Howe said. "It does not guarantee housing."

Howe said the Committee is evaluating nine
criteria to determine which Greek chapters will
receive housing. According to a Committee press
release, these criteria are "demonstrated com
mitment to the goals of Residential Education,
their past and present conduct history, the
strength of their membership, their financial
health, their house management plan, their par
ticipation in the larger Greek and Stanford com
munity, their involvement in on / off-campus
community service, their alumni involvement
and the strength of their relationship and com
munication with the University administration."
Members of the Greek Housing Commit
tee — made up of Howe and Associate Director
of Res Ed Ann Porteus, representatives from
other housing offices in the University and
Greek and non-Greek students — explained
that in considering whether to house Greek or
ganizations this year, they are seeking more stu-
