### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Big-time performers come
through in big-time meets. When
you have as many big-time athletes
as the No. 2 Stanford men's track
squad, championships result.
The Cardinal came through
with its first championship of the
season last weekend at the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation In
door Championships.
Led by the strong distance team
and weight thrower Adam Connol
ly's second school record in the last
two weeks, Stanford captured the
title, scoring 128 points to second
place Washington State's 124.
Connolly got the ball rolling the
Cardinal's way as he set yet anoth
er school, stadium and meet record
with his 35-pound weight toss of 71
feet, 7.25 inches.

In the 8(X) meter run, junior
Michael Stember set an indoor
school record placing third with a
mark of 1:49.65, Ryan Carroll
(1:52.05) and Mark Hassell
(1:52.57) placed fourth and fifth.

MEW'S TRACK
■ Friday-Sunday: Stanford finished
first at the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Indoor Championships
in Reno, Nev.

"The turning point of the meet
was probably the 8(X)," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "Getting
third, fourth and fifth meant big
points that could have gone any
way because it was a good field."
High jumper Michael Ponikvar
helped the Stanford cause with his
second place effort of 7-1.5. Toby
Stevenson was second in the pole

vault (17-4.5).
"When it «t>t
halfway through the it
appeared that we had a good shot
at winning the meet, we decided to
go ahead and take the necessary
steps to try and win." Lananna said.
That meant bringing back
brothers Brad and Brent Hauser,
who had already competed in the
mile and 3.000 meters, respective
ly, to race the 5,000 meters.
The move paid off, as a group of
four Stanford runners swept the
top four places, amassing a critical
29 points to secure the victory.
Brad was first across the line
(14:31.63), while Jason Balkman
and Brent Hauser crossed together
at 14:31.66 and Nathan Nutter fol
lowed in 14:31.68.
Qualifying runners will compete
March 5-6 at the Indoor National
Champiosnhips in Indianapolis.
