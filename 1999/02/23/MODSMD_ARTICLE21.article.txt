# Card never slows in softball
## 
### Gabby Duno Contributing writer 
When you have the task of playing
six games in four days, many teams
would start slowing down by the end.
However, the No. 14 Stanford soft
hall team (9-2), showed its resilience
this weekend, posting a 5-1 record at
the Cambell/Cartier Classic in
Poway, California. Despite the tough
schedule, the Cardinal only lost once,
finishing second in the tournament to
Cal State-Northridge.
The tournament, which was
played as a round-robin, pitted the
Cardinal against Texas Tech and
lowa State on Thursday. Freshman
center fielder Jessica Mendoza hit a
game winning double in the bottom
of the sixth inning to score junior
shortstop Michelle Schneider. After
beating Texas Tech 1-0, the Cardinal
went on an offensive spree and
scored nine runs on route to a 9-1 rout
over opponent lowa State.
The highlight of the game oc
curred in the fourth inning when
freshman first baseman Sarah Bee
son hit her first home run as a Stan
ford Cardinal. The game was stopped
before the sixth inning because Stan
ford was leading by eight.
Stanford continued its winning
streak Friday by posting a 1-0 victory
over UC Santa Barbara. Early in the
game, the Cardinal threatened to

score, but was continually shut-out.
But with two outs in the bottom of the
seventh inning, sophomore Jenni
Shideler hit the game winning home
run to give the Cardinal the win.
The only loss of the weekend
came Saturday afternoon when the
Cardinal took on its toughest oppo
nent. Sacramento State. Offensively,
Sacramento hit well and took advan
tage of the Cardinal's inability to
score, handing the Card a disappoint
ing 4-1 loss. Stanford came out flat
and could not come up with the right
plays as Sacramento continued to ex
ecute.

■ Thursday-Sunday: Stanford came
in second at the Cambell/Cartier
Classic in Poway, Calif.

"The loss was disappointing for
us," said Coach John Rittman. "Their
pitcher played great and we hit the
ball hard, but we just didn't execute
the way we are capable of. We didn't
meet the challenge."
Thankfully, Stanford pulled to
gether just hours later and played
their best game of the tournament
against Wichita State. Mendoza con
tinued to play well and again fired up
the Card going 3-4 with 2 runs and 2
RBl's.
"Fortunately," added Rittman,
"we were able to use this game as a

bounce-back — this time we re
sponded to the challenge."
Stanford finished out the week
end with a 6-3 win over Cal State
Fullerton. Early in the game, the Car
dinal took advantage of Fullerton's
two field errors in the first inning and
scored two unearned runs to get the
offense going Junior Kelly Wiginton
and senior Jenny Foyle both con
tributed strongly for the offense.
Despite the impressive tourna
ment record, the Cardinal players
were somewhat disappointed in their
performance and hope to improve in
their next outings. Since it is still the
beginning of the season, many of the
players are still being moved around
in an attempt to find the strongest
line-up.
"In general, we are not satisfied,"
said Rittman. "But I know we have
not peaked yet and we are still win
ning games. We have the talent and
we are working hard, we jut have to
put it all together."
Stanford took a lot of positives out
of the weekend. Pitchers Becky
Blevins and Marcy Crouch continue
to impress, along with Mendoza.
The team is confidant and is look
ing forward to their constant im
provement. Stanford hopes show
case this improvement this weekend
as it travels to Columbus. Georgia,
for the NFC A Invitational Tourna
ment.
