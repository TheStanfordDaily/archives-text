# Student-made film airs on TV
## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Few Stanford students have the
opportunity to see their theses on
television. But last night some Bay
Area television viewers watched
the film that Will Zavala made as
his final project for the Documen
tary Film and Video Program last
year.
Zavala, who earned a master's
degree from the Communication
Department in 199K, produced the
film as his master's thesis in the doc
umentary program.
The subject of Zavala's film is
Drawbridge, an island in Coyote
Creek on the Fremont-San Jose
border. Drawbridge used to be a
rough community, serving as "an
antidote for city dwellers of the fast
growing Bay Area," according to
Zavala's narration.
Zavala gained support for his
film alter sharing his idea with the
executive director of San Jose's
KTEH public television station.
"It's kind of like a local history for
the Bay Area," he said. In exchange
for free editing at KTEH, Zavala
agreed to air the documentary
there first.
"It's fantastic for any student's
work to get out to a wide audience,"
said Communication Prof. Kristine
Samuelson, one of three faculty in
charge of the documentary pro
gram.
Zavala's film recently won third
place in the annual ( 'ollege Emmys,
a national contest sponsored by the
Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences. He will travel to Los An
geles in a few weeks to receive his
award.
Although Zavala engaged in a
wide variety of work while he was a
student, according to Samuelson,
he was "always intrigued by this
funnv little ghost town."

The summer before entering the
10-person documentary program,
Zavala found a picture of Draw
bridge and a page about the ghost
town while reading a book on Bay
Area history.
The town was born in 1876 as a
two-room cabin for bridge tender
George Mundershietz. By 1906
Drawbridge had grown to a bawdy
saloon town with two hotels and 79
cabins.
"During the week Drawbridge
was peaceful. The fun began when
the Friday night train arrived,"
Zavala says in the narration.
The island of Drawbridge began
to sink into the mud as the burgeon
ing San Francisco Bay communities
drew out groundwater faster than it
could be replaced.
By 1940 only 50 cabins re
mained. The island eventually be
came a wildlife refuge, and the final
remaining resident was asked to
leave. Drawbridge quickly became
a ghost town; the island is still a
wildlife refuge today.
Zavala encountered many prob
lems tracking down former resi
dents of Drawbridge. "It's a scatter
shot process," he said. "You have to
put out a lot of calls [and hope] a
few people will respond."
Samuelson added that it was dif
ficult for Zavala to separate fact
from fiction in the process of inter
viewing former residents. "You be
come a little bit of a psychologist,
dealing with elderly people," she
said. She also mentioned that docu
mentary makers face three addi
tional challenges of finding archival
footage, persuading its owners to
lend it to you and paying the huge
fees networks and professional
archivists often charge. Fortunately
Zavala was able to use resources
from a local historical society.
Zavala described the production
of a documentary as "a huge collab

orative process, where you go
through a very structured series of
critiques." Zavala found his Stan
ford colleagues extremely helpful
in the filmmaking process. The
Communication Department re
quired one professor and three
classmates to screen three stages of
the film, called rushes, rough cuts
and fine cuts. Rushes include the

rough footage; Zavala shot 80 per
cent of the 6 hours of footage him
self. In rough cuts and fine cuts,
Zavala edited the film down to its
final length. 21 minutes.
When asked where he would be
viewing the fruits of his labor.
Zavala said he would be watching
the documentary on his own TV, in
his living room with friends.
