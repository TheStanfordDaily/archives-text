# Lecturer argues arts are marginalized
## Sarlo dissects culture 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
The humanities traditionally have been viewed as in
struments in building the modern state. In eurrent times,
however, arts and literature have beeome marginal in
universities, said writer and eultural eritie Beatriz Sarlo to
an overflowing audienee at Piggott Hall last night.
In a talk she entitled "The Ditfieulties of Understand
ing," Sarlo, a professor of literature at the University of
Buenos Aires and the second presidential lecturer of
winter quarter, argued that art conflicts with culture, pol

itics and social institutions.
"Art is ironic. It avoids direct identification," she said.
"(While] eulture is a form of positive identification,
modern art ... defines itself against the background of
negative or conflictive processes," she added.
Recent developments, sueh as American cultural
studies, provide further evidence of this conflictive rela
tionship.
"Cultural studies are not a solution but a statement of
a problem. [They] require a relativistic perspective,"
Sarlo said, adding that modern art cannot be understood
through this relativism.
Modern art requires more than a respect for
diversity — it involves evaluation, which may not be de
mocratic, she said.
Sarlo also contrasted the role of the humanities in left
ist political action in the l c M)s and in the new "public
post-modern sphere." She said the post-modern era has
witnessed the extension of the arts into everyday life
while simultaneously driving the humanities to a defen
sive position.
In his introduction of Sarlo, C omputer Science Prof.
Terry Winograd likened the urban transformation of
Buenos Aires to the rapid development of cyberspace.
The two places bring a simultaneous desire for and
fear of new technologies, Winograd said.
In the wake of rapid technological change, Sarlo ar
gued, the humanities are important in cultivating the
"creative tension" required to inspire new images of so
ciety.
"The best politicians are those who advocate a new
image of society." she said.
Narrating moments from her first experiences with
the "remoteness" of culture. Sarlo said. "I was not at all
equipped to face it. Not understanding was a central re
lationship with literature."
"Culture was not what I knew — it was what 1 had
never met before... strange, remote. Culture challenged
my identity."
"[The] key to culture is what is missing, what we don't
have," she said.
Sarlo said her early experiences with literature had in
them "every element of a modernist, elitist education ...
personal engagement, limitless effort and the communi
cation of a tradition."
In current times the arts and humanities "have no mis
sion to accomplish." They open questions but cannot
provide whole answers, she said.
A discussion with Sarlo will take place tomorrow at
Piggott Hall room 252 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.
