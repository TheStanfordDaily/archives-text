# Symphony to tour Italy
## 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
After spring quarter this year, a
large group of Stanford Symphony
Orchestra members won't be head
ing home for a leisurely summer
break — they'll be boarding a plane
to Italy.
From June 15 to 30, approximate
ly 60 students involved with the or
chestra. led by Conductor J. Karla
Lemon, will perform five concerts in
several Italian cities.
This trip will be the symphony or
chestra's fourth international tour.
The group toured East Asia in 19K8,
Eastern Europe in 1991 and Hong
Kong and China in the summer o£
199.5.
The orchestra originally planned
to travel to Russia last summer but
canceled the tour due to political un
rest.
Musicologv graduate student Em
ilie Patton, president of the orches
tra's student committee, said that the
group considered traveling to Russia
this summer. However continuing
political instability there influenced
the committee's decision. " I"here
were discussions between our con
ductor and University administra
tors, and they decided it would be a
better idea for us to choose some
where else to go." Patton said.
Orchestra members considered a
variety of tour location options, in
cluding Canada and the Caribbean.
In the end the vote came out almost
unanimously in favor of Italy, said
Giancarlo Aquilanti. assistant direc
tor of the orchestra.
To some Italv seemed to be the

logical choice.
"Our assistant conductor is Ital
ian," said tour manager Erica Roed
der. referring to Aquilanti. "We will
be playing in his hometown, and we
will be performing one of his own
pieces." _ §1
"Giancarlo'sties to Italy will help
with making the tour really excel
lent," Patton added.
Roedder, a junior, also said that
Italy holds a special spot in the hearts
and minds of the orchestra members.
"For one thing ftaly is a country,
which has a place in America's imag
ination,'l she said. "We have this
sense of fascination with the country.
There was definitely a high level ol
student interest in Italy.
"Italyhas a long tradition ol miteic
festivals in the summer. On hot sum
mer days people go into the towns
and listen to concerts. We'll be
adding to that atmosphere," Roed
der said. w|l H
The symphony orchestra must ad
dress the important issue of funding
before it leaves for Italy, Patton said.
"We have a lot of money to raise,
bhe said. "Members of the orchestra
are hiring themselves out to do gigs,
and we'll be doing a play-a-thoQ in
the spring. We're trying to focus on
publicity and getting people out to
our concerts."
A play-a-thon is an event similar
to a walk-a thon. in which people
sponsor orchestra members to play
for specified amounts of time.
In addition to giving concerts the
orchestra members will enjoy tradi
tional tourist experiences, Roedder
said.
"While we're there we'll play in a

Roman amphitheater," she said.
"We'll see a huge opera, Tosca,' and
watch an authentic Gregorian chant
performed by a group of monks."
Aquilanti said that the orchestra
members will also be able to meet
Italian musicians and students.
Besides learning about cultural
differences the Stanford students will
have the opportunity to exchange
ideas musically, Aquilanti added.
"We'll be getting involved with
some students at Brefcia, a town near
Milan," he said. "There is a conserva
tory there where we'll have a con
cert." He added that some students at
the Italian conservator)' are currently
writing compositions that the Stan
ford orchestra will play while in Italy.
Members are looking forward to
the trip for varying reasons.
I'm most excited
about going to Italy, because I've
never been out of the country be
fore," Patton said. "This will only be
my Bird time on an airplane. It's
quite an adventure. To be able to do
this while playing is an extra treat."
Jpn order to prepare for the tour,
orchestra members have been get
ting a preview of the Italian culture
from Aquilanti, Roedder said.
"Giancarlo has been trying to
teach us Italian phrases, such as 'May
I please have agelato,' and we've also
been watching classic Italian
movies," she said. "We've really
been trying to boost cultural aware
ness in the orchestra."
The orchestra will also be per
forming a joint upcoming concert
with the University Singers in
Memorial Church this Friday and a
winter concert March 5.
