# Women run to fourth inside
## 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
Without the services of distance
runner Sally Glynn, who had to be
sent home due to illness, the Stan
lord women's track team was never
really in the running for the team
title at this weekend's Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Champi
onship in Reno, Nev. The Cardinal
ended up fourth, 54.5 points behind
first place Washington State.
That didn't mean that the team
rolled over and played dead.
Making the most of what would
be the final meet of the short indoor
season for all but a few athletes, the
team showed promise for the out
door season, which starts in just
three weeks.
Junior Jayna Smith continued to
improve upon her best indoor 400-
meter time which is also Stanford's
all-time best. After setting the
school record on Friday in the pre

lims with a time of 55.70 seconds,
she came back on Saturday to run
55.31 in her second place perfor
mance.

WOMEN'S TRACK
■ Friday-Sunday: Women's track
came in fourth at the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation Indoor
Championships in Reno, Nev.

Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na was very pleased with Smith's in
door season and looks for even bet
ter things outdoors.
"Jayna is getting better and bet
ter each week," Lananna said. "She
is not your prototypical indoor run
ner. She has huge long legs and to
run on a banked board 2(X) meter
track is pretty tough."
Another school record fell in the
20-pound weight throw. Breaking
her own record by over three feet,
Maureen Onyeagbako placed
fourth with a throw of 57 feet 5.5

inches. Fellow thrower Cassie Ro
muld also placed fourth for the Car
dinal in the shot put with a throw of
47 feet 5.25 inches.
While Smith and Onyeagbako
are just now reaching the cusp of
national-caliber performances,
sophomore distance runner Julia
Stamps knows what it's like to be
there.
Continuing an outstanding sea
son, Stamps won the mile for the
second straight year in 4:50.18. He
hind her were Colleen Flaherty and
Elena Villareal in sixth and seventh
respectively.
"Julia looked great in the mile —
she looked nice and relaxed," said
Lananna. "The other two women.
Elena Villareal and Colleen Fla
herty, did quite well for the second
time (this season in the mile)."
Stamps will be heading to Indi
anapolis in two weeks for the
NCAA Indoor National Champi
onships.
