# Gym makes near-perfect win
## 
### Ramona Shelburne Staff writer 
For Jen Exaltation, last Friday
night was almost perfect.
In addition to helping the l()th
ranked Stanford women's gymnas
tics team (8-2 overall, 4-1 Pacific 10
Conference) to a season-high team
total 195.775 in the Cardinal's win
over No. 7 Arizona State (4-2, 2-2),
Exaltacion broke a school record
with her near-perfect 9.975 on the
balance beam. And if that wasn't
enough, she took home first-place
honors on the vault (9.825) and the
beam and finished second on the
bars (9.875)
Although one of the two beam
judges gave Exaltacion a 9.950 for
her beam routine, her teammates,
coaches and the more than S(H) spec
tators on hand at Burnham Pavilion
Friday night tended to agree more
with the other judge who awarded
Exaltacion a perfect 10.0 for her ef
forts.

"From college standards, we
thought it was a 10.0," said Stanford
head coach Mark Cook. "The judge
who gave her a 9.950 was red-faced
afterwards."

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Friday: No. lo Stanford (8-2 over
all, 4-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
195.775, No. 7 Arizona State (4-2,2-
2) 194.250

Although the Cardinal would
have liked to receive a perfect score
for the first time in school history,
Stanford was more than happy to
post team-season highs on the bal
ance beam (48.925) and vault
(48.675) and upset a Pac-10 Confer
ence rival
Coming into Friday's meet, few
would have expected the C 'ardinal to
dominate the highly-ranked Sun
I )evils. Stanford was coming off one
of its most disappointing perfor
mances of the season, a 192.975-
192.950 loss to unranked Washing

ton, while Arizona State entered the
competition having won 11 of its last
13 meets and one week removed
from a convincing win over then-No.
10 UCLA.
But on a night where Exalta
tion's brush with perfection was
only one of a number of highlights
for Stanford, the Sun Devils stood
little chance of upending the red-hot
Cardinal.
"We knew that we made some
silly mistakes in Washington and we
were more trying to clean up our
routines rather than trying to prove
ourselves," said junior co-captain
Kim Young.
And prove themselves they did.
Besides Exaltacion, sophomore
Jenny Wilson and senior co-captain
Amy Murakami headlined the Car
dinal attack. Fast establishing her
self as a premier vaulter, Wilson
continued her solid season en route
to a second place finish in the vault
(9.800) behind Exaltacion and third
-place honors on the balance beam
with a 9.875.
Competing in all four events for
the first time this year, Murakami
brought home the all-around title
with a Cardinal season high 39.275.
But perhaps even more impressive
was Murakami's fourth-straight vic
tory on the uneven parallel bars
(9.9(H)) — an event in which she
ranks fifth in the nation. Murakami
also took home the event title in the
floor exercise with an artistic rou
tine that earned a 9.925 from the
judges.
Junior Sarah Harding and fresh
man Becky Meldrum rounded out
the scoring for the Cardinal with sec
ond-place performances in the floor
exercise (9.875) and on the uneven
parallel bars (9.875) respectively.
Meldrum was filling in for freshman
teammate Katy Herbert, who
hyper-extended her knee in the first
rotation.
Leading the Sun Devils were ju
nior All-Americans Elizabaeth
Reid and Elizabeth McNabb, who
tied for second place in the floor ex
ercise with scores of 9.900. McNabb
came into Friday's competition
ranked first nationally in the floor
exercise with an average 9.915.
The Cardinal will look to carry
the momentum from last Friday's
meet into its showdown with Ari
zona this Friday night in Tucson.
"This was a great opportunity for
our team to come together and it's
really encouraging to know that we
can be this good [such as in Friday
night's performance] and still have
room for improvement," Young
said.
