## 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Former California Gov. Pete Wil
son was appointed to the Hoover In
stitution yesterday as a distinguished
visiting fellow. The appointment, ef
fective immediately, came in con
junction with Wilson's announce
ment that he will not seek the 2(XK)
Republican presidential nomination.
Wilson intends to focus his re
search on how the relationship be
tween government and the governed
affects education and domestic eco
nomic development. He will also con
centrate on national security with re
gard to ballistic-missile defense and

counter-terror
ism, according to
the institution's
public affairs of
fice.
Wilson's press
office said he is
not expected to
teach courses.
"Hoover is

one of the most exciting centers of in
tellectual energy to be found any
where." Wilson said in a press re
lease. "Its scholars, policy makers,
business, governmental and media
leaders constantly ask the questions
and find answers that promise to take
America to greater heights. I'm hon

ored that they've asked me to join
them and lend my insights on issues
that are vital to this nation's future."
Most of the institution's top ad
ministrators are at a conference in
Washington. D.C. and could not be
reached for comment.
While nobody knows exactly what
position Wilson will fill in the institu
tion, he is expected to work part-time,
according to Senior Hoover Fellow
and Business Prof. David Brady.
"I'm sure he'll be a research fellow
of some sort," Brady said, "but I don't
expect him to move down here."
Wilson left office on Jan. 4 after
serving the maximum two terms as
the state's chief executive. He has

also served as a U.S. Senator, the
mayor of San Diego and a California
state assemblyman.
After Wilson ran for the Republi
can presidential nomination in 19%.
many expeeted him to try again for
the 2(HX) bid. However, after polling
supporters, Wilson projeeted he
eould only raise $5 million to $8 mil
lion, far short of the $25 million he be
lieves a candidate needs to run a
strong campaign.
But Brady said Hoover will bene
fit from Wilson's political ties.
"Around two or three years ago
he helped Hoover with a conference
