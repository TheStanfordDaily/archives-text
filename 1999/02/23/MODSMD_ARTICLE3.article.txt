## 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Former California Gov. Pete Wil
son was appointed to the Hoover In
stitution yesterday as a distinguished
visiting fellow. The appointment, ef
fective immediately, came in con
junction with Wilson's announce
ment that he will not seek the 2(XK)
Republican presidential nomination.
Wilson intends to focus his re
search on how the relationship be
tween government and the governed
affects education and domestic eco
nomic development. He will also con
centrate on national security with re
gard to ballistic-missile defense and

counter-terror
ism, according to
the institution's
public affairs of
fice.
Wilson's press
office said he is
not expected to
teach courses.
"Hoover is

one of the most exciting centers of in
tellectual energy to be found any
where." Wilson said in a press re
lease. "Its scholars, policy makers,
business, governmental and media
leaders constantly ask the questions
and find answers that promise to take
America to greater heights. I'm hon

ored that they've asked me to join
them and lend my insights on issues
that are vital to this nation's future."
Most of the institution's top ad
ministrators are at a conference in
Washington. D.C. and could not be
reached for comment.
While nobody knows exactly what
position Wilson will fill in the institu
tion, he is expected to work part-time,
according to Senior Hoover Fellow
and Business Prof. David Brady.
"I'm sure he'll be a research fellow
of some sort," Brady said, "but I don't
expect him to move down here."
Wilson left office on Jan. 4 after
serving the maximum two terms as
the state's chief executive. He has

also served as a U.S. Senator, the
mayor of San Diego and a California
state assemblyman.
After Wilson ran for the Republi
can presidential nomination in 19%.
many expeeted him to try again for
the 2(HX) bid. However, after polling
supporters, Wilson projeeted he
eould only raise $5 million to $8 mil
lion, far short of the $25 million he be
lieves a candidate needs to run a
strong campaign.
But Brady said Hoover will bene
fit from Wilson's political ties.
"Around two or three years ago
he helped Hoover with a conference


Wilson
on federalism. He brought in eight
other governors," Brady said.
"From Hoover's view, he's well
connected with people and gover
nors andean set up some conferences
on subjects that matter to us."
Hoover Director John Raisian
agreed that Wilson will benefit
Hoover.
"Pete Wilson stands out among
America's leading statesmen,"
Raisian said in a press release. "His
philosophy and track record of ac
complishments embody Hoover's vi
sion of empowerment of the individ
ual, reducing government intrusive

ness and the safeguarding and
preservation of both individual free
dom and America's national securi
ty"
Wilson's appointment is not with
out controversy. His support for
19%'s Proposition 2()9, also known
as the California Civil Rights Initia
tive, stirred anger within minority
groups throughout campus. The ini
tiative prevented public institutions
from discriminating on the basis of
gender, race, ethnicity and other
characteristics. The measure, which
tried to eliminate affirmative action
in public institutions, passed by a
large margin.
Wilson's appointment to Hoover
"is an affront to every Stanford stu
dent that helped challenge the racist

ideology of the Wilson administra
tion," said senior Leslie Anne Hum
mel. "1 am not proud to have him on
campus."
Other students, however, feel
Wilson will be an asset to the Hoover
Institution's policy decision-making.
"His role in quietly instituting the
regulatory and tax reforms that stim
ulated the high-tech and other
emerging sectors of the state's econ
omy makes him a fitting contributor
to the study of fiscal policy," said
Brian Karimzad, communications
director for the Stanford Republi
cans.
"We should not forget the obsta
cles he overcame during the early
'90s, as the state was ravaged by de
fense cuts and natural disasters."
