# Sullivan to become Law dean
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
On her final day at Stanford as a
visiting professor during the spring of
1992, Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan en
tered an eerily quiet classroom to de
liver her last lecture before returning
to Harvard.
"1 scribbled all over the top chalk-

board, until I finally ran out of space and rolled the board
up from the bottom position to the top, and underneath
[my class] had scrawled in giant letters "Defect to Stan
ford.' "
A year later the renowned constitutional scholar
stunned the legal world and answered her students' call,
leaving Harvard for a third-floor office at Stanford Law
School.
Yesterday the 43-year-old New York native accepted
another call, this time from University President Gerhard
Casper, when she agreed to become the school's dean.
In September Sullivan will become the first female
dean of any school in the University's history when she re
places outgoing Law School Dean Paul Brest, who an
nounced his retirement last fall.
Brest, who has led the Law School for 12 years, said
that "Sullivan will bring to the deanship the array of skills
that make her such a great lawyer, scholar and teacher.
She is a brilliant choice to assure Stanford Law School's
preeminence in the 21st century."
Meeting challenges
Sullivan takes over at a time when students and former
faculty are claiming the school fosters an environment
hostile to women and minorities.
Two weeks ago former Prof. Linda Mabry spoke out
on her reasons tor leaving the Law School in December.
"1 left Stanford, because it is an institution that engages
in a pattern of practicing intense bias, which devalues, dis-


Sullivan
courages and marginalizes people of
color," Mabry said.
Mabry, who is black, is one of a
number of professors who filed com
plaints with the U.S. Department of
Labor, alleging discrimination in the
University's tenure practices.
Last week an anonymous e-mail
to students of Prof. Kendall ITiomas
touched off heated responses from
many, who claimed the message's
negative comparisons between
Thomas and another black professor
had racist overtones.
Sullivan, who did not return
phone calls yesterday, has repeatedly
held that the Law School is a family
like community far ahead of its peer
institutions in issues of diversity.
"Since [Law Prof.] Barbara Bab
cock pioneered the advent of women
to the faculty, Stanford has done ex
traordinarily well attracting women
to the faculty," Sullivan said soon
after coming to Stanford in 1993.
"Tokenism is just not an issue here."
She went on to serve on the
school's faculty appointment com
mittee, which recruits visiting and
permanent law professors. In that ca

pacity she spoke in 19% to students,
who raised concerns over the school's
small number of female faculty.
At the time Sullivan said that,
compared to Harvard, Stanford "has
achieved a good, healthy critical mass
of women."
When she left Cambridge for Palo
Alto, many national newspapers
speculated that she did so because
she found Harvard a hostile environ
ment for female faculty. Sullivan,
though, has always downplayed that
speculation, saying that she was not
pushed from Harvard but drawn to
Stanford.
"This place was too good to be
true," she usually quips in response to
questions about her motivations for
moving. "I mean, who could resist a
world-class law school in paradise?"
Distinguished record
Casper, who was instrumental in
recruiting Sullivan six years ago, said
he believes her status as a relative
newcomer will serve her and the Law
School well.
"I always try to pick the best per
son," he said. "In this case 1 chose the
person in whose capacity to bring
new perspectives to bear I had the
greatest confidence. Kathleen Sulli
van is not only very smart... she has

a relatively fresh eye."
Casper, himself an expert on con
stitutional law, also praised her ac
complishments as a scholar and
teacher.
Sullivan has published scores of
articles in law reviews and on op-ed
pages around the country. She has
been recognized by law students at
Harvard and Stanford for her teach
ing. And she has literally written, or
at least edited, the book on constitu
tional law.
Emeritus Law Prof. Gerald Gun
ther, who chose Sullivan to co-edit
the most recent edition of his land
mark text "Constitutional Law," said,
"1 consider [Sullivan] the best scholar
in the country on the subject."
Gunther, who for more than a
decade was the schtxil's longest-serv
ing teacher and the highest rated by
students, had always said he would
retire when another faculty member
bettered his evaluation scores.
"Then Kathleen comes along, and
I had to amend that statement," he
said. "I said. Til quit as soon as I get
poorer teaching ratings than anyone
other than Kathleen.'"
According to Sullivan, "Teaching
has always been the absolute center"
of her career.
But her commitment to the class

room has not kept her out of other
venues, such as the U.S. Supreme
Court.
Sullivan has presented more than
10 written briefs to the nation's high
est court and has twice argued cases
herself. She has battled on behalf of
abortion rights, against Colorado's
1992 anti-gay Amendment 2 and in
favor of President Clinton's attempt
to delay Paula Jones' civil lawsuit
until after he left office.
Many legal pundits have suggest
ed that Sullivan will eventually leave
academia for the other side of the
bench.
USA Today, The Washington
Post and The New York Times have
all floated her name as a potential ap
pointee to the Supreme Court. Dur
ing the past six years all three have re
ported rumors that she was being
considered for the job by President
Clinton.
Sullivan even once called being a
Supreme Court justice a "dream job"
but quickly followed the thought with
another pro-Stanford quip: "Who
would ever want to leave paradise?"
Thanks to Casper, for the next five
years she will be in charge of a small
part of her paradise â€”or at least
until she decides to answer someone
else's call.
