# Three-month wait ends
## Tower reopens 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
A ribbon-cutting ceremony was
held yesterday to celebrate the re
opening of Hoover Tower, the tallest
Hoover-named monument in the
United States next to Hoover Dam.
Closed for nearly three months
the tower now sports a new elevator
veneered with rare and expensive
golden bird's-eye mahogany. Amidst
the fanfare were Stanford President

Gerhard Casper as well as several
students and faculty.
The tower's observation deck,
with lofty views of campus and the
surrounding valley, had been inac
cessible since Nov. 30, when Hoover
Institution officials decided to close
the tower and replace the original el
evator, which had served visitors
since 1941.
"The old elevator would break

down about every two weeks," said
tour guide Lucy Lewis, a senior.
"People would get stuck either at the
top or on the elevator, and we would
have to call someone to get them
down. On weekends this could take a
really longtime."
Raye Leigh Marion, director of
Stanford's Visitor Information Cen
ter, added that these past three
months were the ideal time for the re
furbishment, because traffic is usual
ly slower during winter quarter. Also
57,(XX) visitors in 1998 capped a three
year climb in tower attendance,
which made the new elevator neces
sary for the sake of safety and effi
ciency.
Repairing the old elevator was
never considered as a permanent so
lution, because "every time the
motor on the old elevator broke
down, we would have to call people
in to rebuild it.
The motor couldn't be replaced
since it was so old," Leigh said.
According to Hoover Institution
facilities assistant Kelly Hauge,
spending what she estimated as
$140,000 to $150,(XX) on the new ele
vator was a joint decision made by
Stanford administration and the
Hoover Institution.
Part of her job was to serve as a li
aison between these two bodies and
Montgomery Elevators, which han
dled the construction.
She also supervised access to the
various floors of the Hoover Institu
tion building via the stack elevator lo
cated in the Hoover Library.
ITie only time Stanford adminis
tration clashed with the contractors,
she said, was when the opening was
delayed for a week, because they
were unable to attain an operational
permit for the elevator on time.
"We wanted to open it the day
after President's Day, but the inspec
tors didn't work on President's Day.

So we had to wait a week for them to
come out and issue the permit,"
Leigh said.
Hoover Institution tour guides,
who work three at a time guiding
tours of the tower and answering
questions, were excited about the
new elevator. Tour guide Kevin
Stults, a senior, said, "It's nice. It's
faster, and it doesn't break down as
much."

'People would get stuck
either at the top or on the
elevator, and we would
have to call someone to get
them down. On weekends
this could take a really long
time.'

They also had reason to be excited
since completion of the project
meant they could go back to working
their regular shifts. Leigh said that,
during construction, "I kept all my
staff on, but only those who needed
to work were encouraged to take all
their hours." So some employees
were not allowed to work as much as
they would have liked, Leigh said.
Lewis, who was staffing the obser
vation deck yesterday morning, said
there were more visitors than usual
for a Monday and that people were
happy that they could finally go up
and see the view again.
At any rate Leigh said, "we only
got a few complaints while it was
closed. There were some people for
whom it was their only visit in 10
years, and they were a little disap
pointed."
