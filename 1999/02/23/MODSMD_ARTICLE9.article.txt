## Supreme Court justices reject abortion arguments Doctors must notify parents 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court yes
terday left intact a Virginia law requiring doctors to
notify a young girl's parent before performing the abor
tion she seeks.
I he justices, without comment, turned away argu
ments that the law wrongly denies most mature girls
under IS the right to an abortion without parental
involvement.
Yesterday's action is not a decision, and does not
preclude the possibility the court may review the Vir
ginia law, or one similar to it, at some future date.
In other action, the court:
•Declined to revive lawsuits stemming from the 1986
terrorist hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi, Pak
istan. The justices, without comment, turned away argu
ments that allegations against Pan American World

Airways and a security firm should be restudied in light
of their decision last year on transfers of complex law
suits from one federal trial court to another.
• Refused to let Hare Krishnas solicit donations or
sell religious literature at Miami International Airport.
The court rejected an appeal that argued such restric
tions violate free-speech rights. Today's action sets no
national precedent. But the denial of review lets stand a
ruling that applies to all airports in Florida. Alabama
and Georgia.
•Agreed to use a Nevada case to clarify a 1996 fed
eral law aimed at curtailing federal court access for state
prison inmates who seek to challenge their state prose
cutions. The court said it will decide later whether con
victed killer Antonio Slack is entitled to have a federal
judge study the arguments he raised in a 1995 appeal.
