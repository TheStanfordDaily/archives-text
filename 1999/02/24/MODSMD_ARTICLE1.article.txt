# Amendment to split Senate passes ASSU

### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night, in its final meet
ing of the quarter, to place on the spring election ballot
a proposed constitutional amendment that would di
vide the Senate into graduate and undergraduate bod
ies.
The amendment, which needed a two-thirds major
ity to pass, passed by an 18-3 margin, with one senator
abstaining.
A debate preceded the vote, during which several
concerns were raised and then addressed by the au
thors of the amendment.
ASSU Vice President Santos Marroquin, a senior,
and ASSU Senate Deputy Chair Mike Levin, a junior,
both reminded the senate that this vote was not to de
cide whether or not the division would actually occur,
but whether it would go on the election ballot. "We're
doing this for the students. Let's let the students who
we represent decide," Levin said.
Sophomore David Searle, a senator who voted
against the proposal, read a statement in which he ex
plained his fear that "the long-term result of creating an
ASSU composed of graduate and undergraduate bod
ies will be a disjointed and unaccountable ASSU â€” one
that is ineffective in dealing with issues that pertain
jointly to both the undergraduate and graduate popu
lations."
He outlined three main concerns with the amend
ment, the first of which being that it would cause "leg
islative dichotomy" and its failure to address issues per
tinent to both populations... "could be devastating."
He also argued that the amendment "is proceeding
outside of the framework that was intended originally
for the ASSU." He questioned the changes in by-laws
included in the amendment and the separate proce
dures for the two new bodies.
The third concern was that the name "Graduate
Student Council" implies "a dissection of the ASSU
and not an attempt to work within the presently delin
eated guidelines of our constitution."
Graduate senator Hunter Tart responded to Sear
le's speech by replying "the authors [of the amend
ment] see the dichotomy as positive." He agreed as to
the importance of joint meetings, referring to the exec
utive committee's power to call them when necessary.
Marroquin urged senators to make their opinions
about the proposal known to their constituents and to
