Continued economic growth predicted
WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said yesterday a "surprisingly robust" U.S. economy
should continue growing this year but at a much slower pace than last.
And he dropped hints that if the slowdown doesn't occur, the central
bank is prepared to increase interest rates to make it happen.
Delivering his twice-a-year report on Fed policy to Congress,
Greenspan did not signal that a rate hike is imminent. Indeed, he also
left open the possibility that if the global economic crisis should sud
denly re-ignite, the Fed would respond with further rate cuts, as it did
last fall.
Some economists say Fed rate hikes could occur as soon as May if
the economy doesn't slow. But others say the central bank will prob
ably wait until the second half of the year before making any changes,
given the fragile global situation.
The U.S. economy grew at a sizzling 5.6 percent annual rate in the
final three months of last year, pushing the unemployment rate down
to the lowest levels in three decades.
White supremacist convicted in murder
JASPER, Texas (AP) — A white supremacist was convicted of
capital murder yesterday for chaining a black man to a pickup truck
and dragging him to his death in one of the nation's grisliest hate
crimes since the civil rights battles.
Jurors deliberated less than 2 1/2 hours before returning their ver
dict against John William King, who now faces either life in prison or
execution. The panel of 11 whites and one black will decide his pun
ishment after a separate phase of testimony.
King, a 24-year-old laborer, was the first of three white men to be
tried in the June 7 slaying of James Byrd Jr.
The 49-year-old man's body was torn in two — a head and right
arm severed from his torso — when he was pulled nearly three miles
while tied by his ankles with a 24 1/2-foot logging chain.
The murder thrust Jasper into a national spotlight as members of
the Ku Klux Klan and New Black Panthers descended on the timber
town of B,(XX) people about 1(H) miles northeast of Houston.
Clinton rejects Chinese satellite sale
WASHINGTON (AP) — After years of promoting satellite
exports to China, the Clinton administration abruptly reversed
course, rejecting a $450 million commercial satellite sale to a Chi
nese-controlled consortium amid concerns about valuable military
know-how.
The decision, confirmed yesterday by senior administration offi
cials, leaves Hughes Electronics with tens of millions of dollars in
high-tech hardware under construction at its Southern California
plant.
Rejection of the export comes a week before Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright travels to Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders
and amid congressional and executive branch probes of whether past
satellite deals helped the Chinese military.
