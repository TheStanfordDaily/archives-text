# Kosovo talks to continue next month

R AMBOUILLET, France
(AP) — Serbs agreed in principle
ysterday to give limited self-rule to
majority ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, but the two sides failed
after 17 days of intense negotia
tions to conclude a deal for ending
their yearlong conflict. More talks
were scheduled for March as a new
round of violence shook the
province.
The partial settlement puts on
hold, at least temporarily, NATO's
threats to bomb Serb targets if
they don't adopt the complex plan
that would force them to withdraw
troops from Kosovo and accept
NATO peacekeepers.
After four days of strenuous
personal diplomacy, shuttling
between the two sides and even
enlisting the help of 1996 GOP
presidential candidate Bob Dole,
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright accepted less than she
had insisted on.
There was no provision for
deploying NATO peacekeepers in
the tense province to enforce the
settlement, and the Serbs refused
to give their consent to major ele
ments of the self-rule sought by
the ethnic Albanians.
According to senior U.S. offi
cials, the Serbs still insist on Ser
bian courts for Serbs accused of
crimes, refuse to permit the ethnic
Albanians to have a president and
are unwilling to cooperate with a
war crimes tribunal looking into
atrocities against civilians commit
ted during the war that has
claimed some 2,(MK) lives.
"But we have broken the stale
mate that hung over Kosovo for so
long," Albright said.
The Albanians also hedged.
They were given two weeks for
"consultations" with people in the
province, and still are insisting on a
referendum to vote for indepen
dence and secession from Serbia at
the end of the three-year autono
my trial period envisioned by the
accord formulated by the United

States, Britain, France, Italy, Ger
many and Russia.
The settlement also calls for a
restoration of the cease-fire that
was arranged by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke last October
and for the staged removal of Ser
bian troops and special police units
— but only after a NATO force is
deployed to enforce the agree
ment.
In order to put a halt to the pro
tracted negotiations, which ran
through two deadlines, the ethnic
Albanians and Serbs agreed to
another round of talks in France,
beginning March 15.
The Serbs gave no indication
they would agree to NATO peace
keepers, arguing that they could
not be sure the Serb minority —
the province is about 9() percent
ethnic Albanian — would be pro
tected.
In a concession, the 81-page
accord permits the Serbs to keep
troops along the Kosovo border.
Final approval by the ethnic
Albanians also is a question mark.
Meanwhile, the violence contin
ued.
In Pristina, Yugoslavia, five
Serb policemen were wounded
when suspected rebels opened fire
on Serb mourners, who gathered
under police escort at the home of
Mirko Milosevic, a civilian killed
Monday allegedly by the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
Albright, on Sunday, had called
Milosevic's refusal to accept a
NATO peacekeeping force to
guarantee security a "nonstarter."
"We accept nothing less than a
complete agreement, including a
NATO-led force," she declared at
the time. "Without that element,"
she said, the agreement is "just a
piece of paper."
On the eve of a meeting yester
day with Clinton, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott sent the presi
dent a letter expressing concern
that U.S. forces "could become
involved in yet another costly.

open-ended and ill-defined peace
keeping mission" in Kosovo. Clin
ton has pledged up to 4,000 Amer
ican troops, if a peace accord could
he reached.
Asked about Lott's reserva
tions, Clinton said, "What we
learned in Bosnia was that we
shouldn't set a date certain (for
withdrawal) and later find out we
can't meet it and have people feel

that they've been misled. I don't
want to do that.
The contingent of Marines
aboard Navy ships in the Mediter
ranean who have been designated
as the vanguard of a NATO-led
peacekeeping force in the event of
a Kosovo peace deal will remain in
the area, Bacon said. He said they
would not gtwashore unless there is
a peace agreement.
