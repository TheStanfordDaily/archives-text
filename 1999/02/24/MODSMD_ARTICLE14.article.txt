Newly appointed Law
School dean will be an
asset to the University

STANFORD LAW SCHOOL
could not have made a better
choice.
In naming Law Prof. Kathleen
Sullivan the School's next dean,
Stanford snared a celebrated consti
tutional scholar, a brilliant teacher
and one of the best lawyers in the
country.
It also ended a drought of more
than 100 years: When she takes over
for current Law School Dean Paul
Brest on Sept. 1, Sullivan will
become the first female academic
dean in the University's history.
No one should question Sullivan's
qualifications for the job.
She has won teaching awards at
Stanford and Harvard, argued two
cases before and presented more
than 10 written briefs to the
Supreme Court, testified for
Congress on computer encryption
and co-edited the most recent edi
tion of Emeritus Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther's landmark text, "Constitu
tional Law." Gunther calls her "the
best scholar in the country on the
subject."
We do question, however, why it
has taken so long for the University
to appoint a woman dean of one of
its schools. It is difficult to imagine
that Sullivan is the first woman with
the qualifications to be an academic
dean since the University's found
ing.
We commend the Law School for
finally breaking the barrier and Sul
livan for having the courage to stand
alone as a female dean. Hopefully,
she will not find the uniqueness of
her situation to be a distraction from
her job — she will have enough to
worry about as it is.

Sullivan wants to make the Law
School, which last year tied with
Harvard for second in U.S. News &
World Report's rankings, the best in
the country.
She believes Stanford students
should have "the best legal educa
tion in America." That's a large task,
but one she and the School are capa
ble of completing.
TTie Law School, though, is cur
rently mired in charges of gender
and racial bias leveled in recent
months by students and former fac
ulty.
Two incidents last week involving
black professors — former Law
Prof. Linda Mabry's denouncement
of the school as a biased institution
that "marginalizes people of color"
and an anonymous e-mail to stu
dents of Prof. Kendall Thomas that
some students claimed had racist
overtones — underscore racial ten
sions that will not be laid to rest eas
ily.
To accomplish her goal, Sullivan
will need to address those tensions.
Like Brest, she will need to open
a school-wide dialogue on race and
gender discrimination.
She needs to get to the heart of
one of the Law School's deepest
problems: Does the school foster an
environment hostile to women and
minorities?
Most of all, she must listen to the
concerns of students and faculty and
be willing to devote time to breaking
down bias where it exists.
Putting Sullivan in its top position
can only help make the Law School
more of a leader in the legal field.
We welcome her, and we hope that
her actions as dean will help make
the School more of a leader in areas
of diversity as well.
Her success could convince the
University to wait less than a centu
ry before naming its second female
academic dean.
