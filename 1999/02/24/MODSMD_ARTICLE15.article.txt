Faculty housing needs better forum

For six years, 1 served as the first execu
tive director of Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders. Though I have left the Bay
Area temporarily, I have remained in touch
with my many friends and neighbors and for
mer colleagues on the Stanford campus.
I have been horrified and heartsick to
hear from all parties about the escalating bit
terness over the "infill sites" housing issue.
Although residents had been notified
over a year ago that the University was con
sidering developing selected parcels of open
land in the residential area for additional fac
ulty housing, they expected that before the
administration moved ahead with concrete
plans, they would be given a chance to con
sider other possible sites as well as what the
impact of the now-imminent construction of
Sand I lill Road apartments and senior hous
ing might be on the stock of campus houses.
They were particularly disturbed that the
University was moving ahead on the "infill"
proposal in the absence of a formally devel
oped, mutually agreed to, long-range plan
for the residential area which includes desig
nation of dedicated parks and open spaces.
Here is the crux of the problem —

demonstrated again in this dispute as it has
been in previous disputes over housing
developments, such as Ryan Court for facul
ty and staff and Rains Houses for graduate
students. Residents feel that they should
have some part in the brainstorming that pre
cedes decision-making in matters that will
have a direct effect on their community and
the value of their homes (for many people
their largest single asset). Administrators
prefer to make the basic decisions and have
definitive plans in hand before they
approach residents for comment.
The difficulty is that after having expend
ed so much effort, time and money on the
plans they present, the administrators are
already so heavily invested that they have a
stake in seeing the plans become a reality
and are understandably reluctant to make
major modifications or even to go back to the
conceptual drawing board, if necessary, to
accommodate objections or suggestions by
residents.
The residents, who are among the most
important stakeholders in the residential
community but who are without the elected
representation and well-defined public plan

ning process they would have if they consti
tuted the usual sort of municipality, feel pow
erless, resentful and alienated when their
objections are overridden and their sugges
tions are ignored.
This sense of alienation is now present
and growing. The "we/they" attitude that
characterizes the stance of all participants in
this current dispute serves neither side well.
It is clear that work needs to be done to
amend the agreement negotiated between
the University and SCRL in 1989, in which
the idea of collaboration was subscribed to
by both parties.
The shape and timing of that collabora
tion needs to be better defined.
Positions are now so polarized that I
believe nothing short of an extreme measure
can rescue the situation. I believe that a
moratorium should be called, and the deci
sion on infill housing should be delayed long
enough for a neutral, independent and high
ly skilled expert in conflict resolution and
community planning to be engaged.
This expert should guide administrators
and residents through a structured process of
goal setting and resource assessment leading

to an agreement on a long-range plan for the
residential subdivision.
This process need not take very long: it
can build on the planning document commis
sioned by SCRL three years ago. The Uni
versity already has at its fingertips a vast
amount of information about the resources
available, and many of the important goals
have already been articulated.
Most modern communities engage in
some version of this process — the citizens of
Menlo Park, for instance, are now in the
midst of a "Smart Growth Action
Program" — and the unusual structure of
our community should not condemn it to a
future without such long-range planning in
which its constituents participate.
It is true that we need more affordable
housing to help attract the quality of scholars
that Stanford will always need.
Even more, we need a spirit of open dis
course, trust and mutual understanding that
will make Stanford attractive to those whom
we hope to attract.
