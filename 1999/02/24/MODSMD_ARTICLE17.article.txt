# Breathing Lessons
## April van Scherpe Searching for direction 
### 
I'VE ALWAYS SAID
that the worst possible
personality combina
tion is a firm belief that you
can do anything you set
your mind to, coupled with
a mind not set to anything
in particular.

In this eighth week, as
you crack open your course catalog and
choose the next few bricks to wall you fur
ther into your Stanford career, you may dis
cover that you have this most dire of colle
giate afflictions: tons of talent and zero direc
tion.
Symptoms include the following. Fetishis
tic enjoyment of nearly every class you've
taken. Fantasies about potential colleagues
at NASA, Kaiser-Permanente and FQX
entertained'in equal measure. lißfe,
"Well if Super Alumnus X majored in
Physics AND English, what's wrong with a
Chem-EE-Feminist Studies triple degree?"
Drooling over page 485 of the Stanford Bul
letin ... you know, that well-worn page
where Quantum Field Theory falls under the
banner of Political Science. Swearing in front
of your grandma because "tezzie" just
sounds... well ... stupid.
These signs point toward an all too com
mon plague amongst the college population:
the beautiful, noble interest in everything
and in nothing; a moderate delight in every
possible subject and an overwhelming pas
sion for no singular area.
Renaissance Man-ia.
While you're still fulfilling your general
education requirements, the symptoms are
harmless.
God help you if it's time to choose a

major.
Regardless of where you find yourself in
the progression of your thoughts, there
comes a designated moment at which you
must declare. You must write down what
one thing it is that you want to do for the rest
of your life and stick with it. You're sitting
here with a $30,000-a-year education and a
multiplicity of options. At this threshold,
you've got the smarts, the good sense and the
resources to become just about anything. So
which road do you choose? For us Renais
sance Maniacs, the answer is as simple as the
glaring "undeclared" under our Whois
Directory entries. No Freaking Clue.
And it isn't that you haven't tried. Much
to the contrary — you've searched, you've
surfed, you've plodded through Intro To
Everything, you've endured aptitude tests
and •stinhped vocational batteries, you've
searched in vain for the color of your
parachute. And still, no answer.
If not research, then what about with
drawal? Perhaps the secret of finding your
passion is to stop out, to devote time to
thinking, to climb to a deserted mountaintop
and wait for career karma to set in.
Unfortunately, seclusion further exacer
bates the problem. In your stroll through
Cogitation you'll trip across not a career path
but two unsettling conclusions. First, that
you're desperately afraid; while delving
deeply into the chosen subject, you're leav
ing everything else you love behind. Second
ly, that you're desperately worried; what if
you make a mistake? You'd better be sure of
your decision, because you'll never get the
chance to do this over. The other doors of
opportunity close as you pick one to walk
through.

Not that you should feel pressured.
Some of you declared students will ask
why this is such a big deal. For motivated stu
dents at a great university, failure is fading
quickly in the rear view mirror. Why not just
pick something and go with it?
It's precisely the possibility of success that
causes hesitation. Excellence is well within
reach, and our time here is a critical planning
stage. Scaling the right staircase now means
reaching greater heights than someone who
starts one stair, changes his mind, and starts
up another one.
Renaissance Maniacs envy people with
destinations. We watch those with true inspi
ration race towards their goals, while we're
stuck at the starting line, revving our engines,
wanting fervently to get on with life but not
knowing which road to take. What do we
want? Certainty! When do we want it? Now!
Maybe instead of jumping to action, some
of us are destined to simmer for a while.
However, in the absence of a passion and the
presence of a letter to your parents, the best
route seems to be to leap up, make mistakes
and turn around and try again. Shatter inac
tion. Guess. Learn by doing.
As for me, I'm watching for good omens.
I'm waiting for the Supreme Being to pull up
a battered chair next to me at the CoHo, take
a sip of my chai latte and with much pomp
and circumstance and a milk-frothed mus
tache, announce, "Urology! You're sup
posed to go into urology!"
Any day now, for sure.
