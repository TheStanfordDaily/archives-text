# The 						Present Tense
## Jocelyn Wiener Memories of war and the grasping for peace 
### 
THE FIRST TIME I visited Nejapa,
a small municipality about 30 min
utes from San Salvador, I rode in
the bed of a pick-up truck with the mem
bers of a micro-enterprise organization
where I was interning. The drive took us
past the shadows of a high-security prison,
starving dogs and gang graffiti. But the sun
was shining and the world looked lush and
green in the undetailed haze granted me
by distance.
A young man pointed to the sky that
day and laughed. "Miren, aguilaslook,
eagles. I stole a glance to where he was
pointing and felt a small surge of joy, but
kept my mouth shut. "Grosero/, don't say
that!" a woman shouted at him, and every
one laughed. When we approached the
swarms of birds I was overwhelmed by the
stench permeating the dusty air.
A huge landfill, piled far above maxi
mum capacity, took up several acres at the
side of the road. In it, I was told, more
than five hundred families had set up
homes. The majestic birds gliding above
were not eagles, of course, but vultures.
Turning off the two-lane highway onto
the cobblestone street of the pueblo of
Nejapa one enters el rinconcito mas feliz

del mundo, the happiest little corner of the
earth. Nejapa is the poorest municipality
in the San Salvador area, and yet it thrives.
Here, people smile and wave, tossing off
friendly teasing remarks and occasionally
even stopping your pick-up to offer an
opinion, an anecdote or a bag of candies.
Older kids play basketball in the park, city
council members take breaks at the
restaurants selling traditional pupusas
across the street. Ciuns 'N' Roses mixes in
with cumbia and the teenaged locutadores
who run the community's youth radio sta
tion offer spirited dialogue.
l"he music and the cobbles fade after
another half mile, and the truck turns off
onto a dirt path. Here you bounce through
riverbeds and wind through cornfields and
rice bogs and a few acres of grazing cattle.
(The first time I rode through 1 was struck
by the patchwork of greens and browns
draped over the hills around us. 1 said
nothing of this welling joy, gladly. The
driver of the car eventually pointed to the
landscape and said in a matter-of-fact
voice, "deforestation.")
Finally, you pull to a stop in front of a
community center. On the front wall of the
building, hand-lettered in white, are the
names. Juan Francisco Melgoza, Felix

Antonio Valdez, Jose Maravilla.... Some
25 of them are listed under a painting of
Archbishop Romero, the priest who was a
spokesperson for the poor before his
assassination in 1980. At the bottom of the
mural is a dedication "to the Archbishop
and to all these men who sowed the path
to freedom with their blood."
From 1979 to 1992, El Salvador was
engaged in a bloody civil war. Nejapa was
heavily affected, with 700 non-combat
deaths in addition to "disappearances,"
threats and torture. In the park where chil
dren now play basketball, the national
guard used to keep constant vigil and
enforce a strict 6 p.m. wartime curfew. The
small, brightly-lit, one-room library
attached to the town hall housed a win
dowless torture chamber.
The Peace Accords that ended the war
provided for a Truth Commission which
would assume the task of investigating acts
of violence "whose impact on society
urgently demands that the public should
know the truth." Nejapa at that time was
dusty, tired and broken.
Following the release of the Truth
Commission's report, then-president
Alfredo Cristiani released a statement that
"as far as promoting reconciliation, we

think the Truth Commission report does
not fulfill the desires of the majority of
Salvadorans ... that desire is to forgive
and forget the painful past that has caused
so much suffering." He therefore institut
ed a policy of impunity, amnesty and offi
cial amnesia. Forgive and forget, he said to
a country that had lost 80,(XX) of its citi
zens. But the small municipality of Nejapa
has chosen, instead, to remember.
Nejapa remembers the war in terms of
individual nightmares, but also as a com
munity tragedy. The young disc jockeys
know the role community radio played
during the war and can contextualize it in
the history of their own personal terrors.
The young librarian tells the history of the
room where she now works.
Every year, the community participates
in the aptly named celebration of La
Recuerda — The Reminder. Young boys
and men dress up in army clothes or guer
rilla-style outfits and paint their faces
black and white. They take flaming balls of
old rags — tied with wire and doused with
kerosene — and throw them at one anoth
er in a simulated war.
There are two explanations offered for
the tradition. One refers to an ancient vol
canic eruption, the other to the patron

saint of the village who, even as the devil
threw balls of fire at him, was not distract
ed from his holy meditation. The use of
army and guerrilla costumes by the young
participants, however, imbues the game
with a third meaning — an act of remem
bering the recent war.
The civil wars in Central America,
heavily funded by the U.S. government,
are no longer newsworthy here. With the
amnesty of 1993, the national government
of El Salvador offered complicity. Forgive
and forget. Today, the country suffers
from the highest per capita homicide rate
in the world, due to the rapid growth of
gang violence in the post-war vacuum.
This violence is particularly intense in the
communities bordering Nejapa. In one of
these, there is a youth mural project. But
the young people are allowed only to paint
pictures of lush landscapes — nothing of
vultures or deforestation, nothing of war.
But within the pueblo of Nejapa, there
is almost no violence.
