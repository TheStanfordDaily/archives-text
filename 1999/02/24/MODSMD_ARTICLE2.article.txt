### Erika Check Senior staff writer 
Next quarter, students may notice a famil
iar figure in a crisp, white suit strolling across
campus. Journalist and author Tom Wolfe
will be hosted by the Communication De
partment this spring while he does research
on campus for his next novel.
The Communication Department will
most likely name Wolfe a visiting scholar, ac
cording to Steven Chaffee, professor and
chair of the department. In return. Wolfe has
said he will participate in some activities with
students and faculty. He will not teach or en
roll in classes.
Wolfe was one of the original practitioners
of "new journalism," a movement born in the
l%()s that combined social commentary and
traditional news reporting. Wolfe began his
career working for newspapers and published
his first compilation of essays, " The Kandy-
Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamlined
Baby," in 1%5. Since then, Wolfe has contin
ued to publish nonaction and fiction, includ
ing "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" in
1968. "The Right Stuff" in 1979 and "Bonfire
of the Vanities" in 19K7. Wolfe visited Stan
lord last December to promote his latest
novel. "A Man in Full."
His publicist said Wolfe is in the early
stages of planning his visit to Stanford. "He
may give some lectures or do something for
them. It's still very loose," said Jeff Seroy,
Wolfe's publicist at Farrar, Straus and

Giroux, which has published Wolfe's books
since 1965.
Chaffee said he was initially contacted by
Rolling Stone magazine a month ago to
arrange Wolfe's visit. "We kicked it around as
to what would be most beneficial to stu
dents. ... He said he doesn't need an office,
but he'll be on campus. Its part of our contri
bution to a free and inquisitive piess," Chaf
fee said.
Communication Prof. Ted Glasser, who
has been working with Rolling Stone to
arrange Wolfe's visit, said the details of
Wolfe's stay are still uncertain. "He ap
proached us, and we're trying to figure out an
arrangement that would be mutually satisfy
ing," Glasser said.
Rolling Stone has published Wolfe's non
fiction essays and printed excerpts from "A
Man in Full" last year.
Nobody is certain why Wolfe has chosen to
visit Stanford. In interviews, Wolfe has sug
gested that his next book will explore the sub
ject of education. However, Glasser said that
he is not sure why Wolfe wants to conduct re
search at Stanford. "[That's] the question
we're all asking ourselves. Everyone's gen
uinely curious," Glasser said.
Seroy said he didn't know what Wolfe's
motivation was."He was out there speaking
for his last book, and I guess he liked what he
saw," Seroy said.
Wolfe was unavailable for comment.
