## Study raises question: how tall is tall enough? Growth hormones cause average height increase of 2 inches in children 
### Ryan Chuang Contributing writer 
Have you ever wished you were
taller? Just think — if you just had
an extra 12 inches, you would be
able to reach that top shelf in the
bookcase or make the basketball
team.
Some parents, worried that their
children are too short, have turned
to growth hormones for a solution.
However, a new study published in
the Feb. 18 edition of The New
England Journal Medicine con
cludes that long-term administra
tion of growth hormone to children
with short stature can increase their

adult height by only about 2 inches.
The lead author of the study. Dr.
Raymond Hintz of the Medical
School's Pediatrics Department,
and the other authors in the paper
worked with Genentech. a biotech
nology company located in South
San Francisco. Genentech is the
leading supplier of growth hormone
in the United States and helped
fund the study.
A few diseases — such as Turn
er's Syndrome, where a woman
only receives one X chromo
some — are known to cause some
growth deficiency.
However, the study followed 121
children of "idiopathic short

stature" — shortness from an unex
plained cause.
Hintz said that there are psycho
logical reasons for taking growth
hormone.
"Part of the problem is, of
course, our society's attitude
toward short stature. Along with
sexism and ageism, there is height
ism in our society," he said.
All of the children in the study
had an initial height below the third
percentile for their age. The chil
dren were treated with growth hor
mone for two to 10 years. Some of
the children started taking the hor
mone treatment before the age of
10.

Of these 121 children, 80 have
now reached adult height. Scientists
compared their heights to the
heights of two control groups of
"normal" and "short-statured" chil
dren.
The results from the study
showed that the short boys expect
ed to grow to a height of 5 foot 3
inches; with the growth hormone
treatment, they grew to an average
height of 5 feet 5 inches Girls on
the growth hormone treatment had
a similar level of growth — increas
ing from an expected 4 feet 10 inch
es to 5 feet.
The dilemma for parents and
doctors is determining whether or

not taking hormone shots for years
is worth the addition of 2 inches to
a child's height. Protropin, one of
these growth hormone drugs, may
cause side effects such as insulin
resistance, scoliosis due to
increased rapid growth and allergic
reactions. Also, these drugs can
cost $20,000 a year. Some insurance
companies pay for this, but others
do not.
Some doctors, including Dr.
Sharon Oberfield of Columbia Uni
versity, worry about possible
unknown long-term risks of giving
children growth hormones.
"I think you can be a very happy
short child, and you can be a very

unhappy tall child," Oberfield said.
"I think there are many more things
to happiness than just one's
height."
Though some people might not
find these drugs "effective" enough
to use for now, it is reasonable to
assume that one day researchers
will be able to make more effective
growth enhancers.
Just last month, Genentech
announced plans to expand the
development and distribution of
their human growth hormone prod
ucts worldwide.
Then, people will have some
very interesting issues to confront
