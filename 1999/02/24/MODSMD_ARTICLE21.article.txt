# Science Bug gnaws on problem of rotten fruit

Q: Why does fruit spoil faster and unevenly if
I leave it in a plastic bag as opposed to a
paper bag or out in the open?
A: I've got an idea. Why don't you put your
entire body in a plastic bag and see how long
you last? Oh, are you running out of air in
there? I'm terribly sorry, silly human.
"Hut fruit doesn't have to breathe, right?"
Well, not exactly.
Lucky for you, this bug eats a lot of fruit.
Five to 10 pieces a day to be more specific. No
kidding. Three or four times a week, I would
have to make a special trip to the grocery
store to buy more fruit because it would spoil
so quickly. When a science bug emeritus
became aware of my sour situation, he quick
ly supplied me with a hanging fruit basket and
a.wire fruit bowl. He reminded me that fruit
needs a little room to breathe, just like us
bug* Otherwise it tends to go bad much
fasfer.
An odorless gas known as ethylene
(CH2=CH2) is thought to regulate several
processes of plant development and growth.
An active area of research currently under
development studies how the ethylene hor
mone is received by cells in truits and plants
and how its signal is translated to cellular
response.
While not much is specifically known
about the entirety of the fruit ripening pro
cess, ethylene is thought to play a significant
role in the speed at which fruit ripens. Many
produce companies actually use controlled
addition or deprivation of ethylene to manip
ulate the ripening of produce during shipping.
Fruit ripening is a form of aging and signi
fies the final stage in fruit development. A
fruit is the enlarged ovary of a flower or addi
tional floral parts such as in apple, pear and
pineapple. Fertilization and pollination stimu
lates the parts of a flower, causing an explo
sion of cell divisions.
After this stage, the floral parts start to dif
ferentiate and the fruit structure begins to
form. At this point, the relatively young cells
in the fruit are filled with protoplasm, but as
the hormonal stimulation increases the cells
also begin to rapidly expand in size and
weight. Vacuoles develop and the fruit con
tinues to grow.

Ethylene is formed in small amounts as a
plant hormone. It is created by the enzyme
catalyzed decomposition of a protein known
as methionine. Ethylene production is said to
increase beyond normal levels when a fruit is
placed in conditions of overall stress. An
excessively humid environment that might be
promoted by sealing fruit in a plastic bag is
one such insult that may increase ethylene
production.
While the specific mechanism by which
ethylene speeds the fruit's senescence
remains a mystery, it appears that the expand
ing cells must have some receptor which
chemically triggers further expansion.
If it is true that ethylene production, stim
ulated by aging, also triggers the maturing
process, then the cycle is a self-perpetuating
one. The immature cells produce the hor
mone in small amounts, but that quantity rises
as the cells mature. This produces a positive
feedback loop in the direction of ripening,
over-ripening and eventually spoiling. Such a
vicious cycle can become quickly catastrophic
if the fruit is left in an environment that is rich
in ethylene and not exposed to a constant cir
culation of air; again, a plastic bag.
Probably the best solution to your acceler
ated fruit ripening problem is to leave fruit in
a breathable paper bag or use one of the items
currently on the market like my hanging wire
fruit basket.
There is actually a housewife-invented
product that recently entered the market
known as the "Ripe-N-Pockets." Sally
Bergmoser of McLean, Va., noticed that a
tomato left in her apron pocket ripened to
perfection. She invented a string of pockets
made of polyester mesh fabric that you can fill
with fresh fruits and hang freely to ensure
360-degree air circulation and minimize
stress.
Bug Tip: Taking a date to the Viennese Ball
this weekend? Don't leave your roses in the
fruit crisper drawer in the refrigerator. Rose
petals are effected by ethylene in much the
same way as fruit. An abundance of ethylene
in an enclosed space will cause the flowers to
wilt and brown quickly.
