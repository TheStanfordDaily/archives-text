# Bacteria and legume plants share symbiotic relationship
## Findings may benefit agriculture and environment 
### David Lin Contributing writer 
"You scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours." That adage sums up not only the
concept of friendship and national
alliances but also the concept of symbiot
ic relationships, in which independent
organisms come to depend on each other
for survival.
Biology Prof. Sharon Long, after years
of studying one such relationship
between Rhizobium bacteria and plants
known as legumes, has pinpointed genes
within the beneficial bacteria which assist
them when they invade the plant.
These findings, which Long presented
Jan. 23 at the meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Sci
ence, are the latest in a series of discover
ies by Long which could lead to increased* 1
crop yields and reduced dependence on
fertilizers.
It has long been known that bacteria
live in a mutually beneficial relationship
with legumes — a class of plant that
includes peas, beans, peanuts, soybeans,
clover and alfalfa — by providing nitro
gen to the plant in exchange for shelter.
Nitrogen is essential for protein produc
tion, yet most plants and animals are
unable to use the inert nitrogen gas in the
atmosphere.
Rhizobium bacteria, however, can
synthesize nitrogen-containing nutrients
using atmospheric nitrogen, a process
known as nitrogen fixation.
In exchange for this service, which
most plants cannot perform themselves,
the bacteria find a place to stay in the
roots of the plant. These bacterial living
quarters, known as nodules, form in the
root system of the plant when it is invad
ed by the bacteria.
However, the mechanism which leads
to nodule development and establishes
the symbiosis between bacteria and
plants is not yet fully understood. The
relationship is extremely specific and inti
mately involves both organisms: out of
thousands of species of bacteria inhabit
ing the soil, the Rhizobium bacteria alone
can locate the legumes in the darkness of
the soil and infect them.
Moreover, the infection process caus
es a cascade of changes within each inde
pendent organism and transforms both
into a symbiotic pair.
Understanding this mechanism of
infection and transformation is the focus
of Long's current work.
"This symbiosis [between Rhizobium
and legumes] was already known to be
useful 100 years ago," Long said.
"What's new is that we've gone back
to basic biology and asked about a part of
symbiosis never explored before — how
infection of the host by the bacteria
occur."
Her research has already partly
answered that question. A key discovery
Long made was the existence of a chemi
cal communication system between bac
teria and plants.
A chemical given off by legumes, part
of a chemical family known as flavonoids,
activates certain genes in the bacterium
and tells it that the legume is nearby.
These bacterial genes produce a second
group of chemicals that, together, consti
tute a reply signal to the first.
This second signal returns from the

bacterium to the plant and causes the
plant to grow a tumor which becomes the
nodule.
The bacteria then invade the plant,
entering the nodules and beginning to
produce the nitrogen compounds which
the plant needs.
More recently. Long discovered bacte
rial genes which affect the bacteria's
means of entering and settling into the

plant, including genes which affect bacte
rial interactions with oxygen and genes
which produce an adhesive-type protein.
These genes apparently are activated
only in the presence of legumes. Their
exact functions remain a mystery.
Other key questions also remain unan
swered. In particular, scientists are
attempting to understand what triggers
the large host of complicated changes
that occur in the plant in response to the
bacterial return signal.
While Long has yet to elucidate the
complete mechanism behind these
changes, her findings offer some hints to
possible answers.
She has shown, for instance, that the
bacteria's return signal causes rapid
changes in calcium ion concentrations in
plant root hairs.
This phenomenon is well-documented
in animals, but had not been detected
previously in plants.
Long cautiously projects various appli
cations of her research — most promi
nently, the potential for developing ways
of increasing crop yield in an environ

mentally safe way.
If Rhizobium could be induced to
infect other plants in the manner it
resides in legumes, crops could be grown
without use of fertilizer, even in nutrient
poor soil.
"It could permit a sustained agricul
tural system that is less resource-inten
sive" than current farming techniques,
Long said.

Such a reduction in fertilizer usage
could cut farming costs, reduce pollution
from fertilizer runoff and prevent deple
tion of soil nutrients.
Long's work also has consequences for
understanding the ways in which cells
react to and interact with their environ
ment.
The mechanism by which Rhizobium
induces the development of nodules in
the plant may illustrate more generally
how chemical signaling affects cell
growth and development.
" This may provide clues to what may
be components controlling cell behavior
in many organisms," Long said.
In addition to her research. Long has
worked extensively to improve under
graduate programs at Stanford.
She teaches courses in biology and in
the new Science, Math and Engineering
Core, an interdisciplinary science pro
gram designed for non-science majors.
Long was also awarded the Bing Fel
lowship for outstanding teaching in 1997
and the Mac Arthur Fellowship "genius
award" in 1992.
