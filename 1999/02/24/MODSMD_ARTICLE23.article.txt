						primer: What is tenure at Stanford?
## Administrators and faculty discuss the pros and cons of a controversial process 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Almost every year, decisions an
nounced by the University of whether a
junior faculty member has been granted
tenure provoke controversy and debate
on campus.
However, many students are in the
dark about the lengthy process that pre
cedes tenure decisions, unaware that the
decision is actually years in the making
and involves nearly every level of Uni
versity administration.
According to Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Malcolm Beasley, the tenure
system is crucial to the University.
"It's absolutely critical, because we're
making lifetime appointments . . . im
pacting the quality of scholarship and
teaching in the school for 20 to 30 years,"
he said.
The tenure track
J
The career of a Stanford academician
begins as an assistant professor with an
initial term of either three or four years.
At the end of this period, the department
chair or dean of the field conducts a reap
pointment review that evaluates the per
formance of the assistant professor.
If the review is approved, the assistant
professor is given an additional term of
three or four years to complete a seven
year stint.
During the seventh year of the assis
tant professor's term, the tenure review
process begins.
The assistant professor meets with the
chair of her department to consider peo
ple who could serve as outside referees
during the process.
The candidate provides samples of his
research, publications and manuscripts to
a subcommittee of tenured faculty within
the department, which .also considers
teaching evaluations and reports from
graduate students who have worked with
the candidate.
The subcommittee is governed by

University guidelines of review which are
aimed at keeping the process consistent
throughout all departments.
"The idea is to get as broad a spectrum
of evidence and data about a person's
work as can be done," said Kathy Gillam,
senior associate provost for faculty af
fairs.
After a file on the candidate is assem
bled, a process that takes several months,
the committee presents the case to the
full tenured faculty of the department,
which votes on it.
If the department faculty approves the
case, the department chair summarizes
her department's view to a committee
with that school's dean's office.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences, for example, has a Committee for
Appointments and Promotions com
prised of two senior faculty members
from each school: the humanities, social
sciences and natural sciences.
This committee reviews the candi
date's file and advises the dean of that
school on whether to approve the case.
According to Beasley, the committee
is considering six appointments for
tenure promotions from within the Uni
versity this year, as well as more than 20
applications for tenure from assistant
professors at other universities, which he
said is an exceptionally high number for
outside applications.
If the dean feels that the candidate
merits tenure, the case is sent on to the of
fice of Provost Condoleezza Rice, who
reads each case and consults with the staff
of her office.
If the provost approves the tenure
case, she sends it on to a committee
known as the Advisory Board, which
consists of seven faculty members from
across the University elected by the en
tire faculty.
The Advisory Board conducts its own
review of the candidate and ultimately
makes a recommendation to University
President Gerhard Casper.
If he chooses, the president can come
to the Advisory Board to discuss the case.

According to Gillam, however, Casper
generally tends to accept the board's rec
ommendations.
Successes and problems
Gillam said the tenure track system is
as beneficial to professors as it is to the
University.
"On one hand, tenure provides securi
ty of employment to academicians.. .
which allows for freedom of investigation
and scholarship and protection against
arbitrary firing," she said.
"It also establishes a modicum of eco
nomic security" for professors who, on
obtaining tenure, can retain their posi
tions for decades, she added.
Statistics Department Chair Brad
Efron highlighted the success of Stan
ford's tenure system by comparing it to
other universities.
"At Harvard, they basically don't pro
mote people. They just appoint people
from the outside," Efron said.
"There is no job at the end of the rain
bow for assistant professors at Harvard.
Stanford gives junior faculty an honest
shot at being promoted."
Also, Efron said that Stanford's ap
proval of approximately 50 percent of ap
plications for tenure promotions within
the University compares favorably to
UC-Berkeley.
"Berkeley promotes at least 80 per
cent of its people. ... With such numbers,
there's less pressure. They can afford
more mistakes and do make more," he
said.
Several officials involved in the tenure
process agreed that one of the most chal
lenging elements of the system is the
pressure and impact riding on the tenure
decision.
Biology Prof. Bob Simoni, chair of the
Advisory Board, who himself was grant
ed tenure in the late 19705, said the most
difficult part of the process is worrying
about the consequences: "You face the
