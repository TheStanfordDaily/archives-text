## Ruggers rout Men's team still needs help 
### Chuck Gates Contributing writer 
This weekend the women's rugby
team was supposed to have two diffi
cult games in one day that would test
the Cardinal.
There were two games but no dif
ficult test.
Stanford dominated the morning
game against Santa Clara, winning
72-0. In the afternoon game, the
starters rested while the rest of the
team continued with a romp over
Nevada, 35-0.
The women (6-1-1) were unstop
pable.
"It went really well, obviously
from the score," said team captain
Sue Landsittel.
The Cardinal started out very
strong and shook the confidence of
Santa Clara.
"They started losing at the begin
ning and they got really frustrated,"
said team president Lara Strauss,
"and everything really started to
break down [for them]."
Yet despite such dominating play
over the two league opponents,
there is still a bit of displeasure
among the women.
"It's fun to win by that much, but
it is not really a very beneficial game
for us," Strauss said. "You can make
the same mistakes and still win by a
lot. That is kind of the problem with
our league in general. Some teams
are not quite at the same level as oth
ers."
For the sake of Santa Clara, per
haps it is good the women made
those few mistakes.
"We had a ton of lost balls,"
Landsittel said. "We had a ton of
knock-ons."
It may seem wrong to point out a
weakness in a team that wins by so
many points, but the women seem to
have very lofty goals.
"Despite our victory we had a lot
of mistakes we need to correct be
fore we play better teams," Landsit
tel said. "Especially in the playoffs. It
was a great win.
"It was a really fun game, but we
can't let the score overshadow all the
mistakes we made."
The women are looking to clinch
home-field advantage, but they are
determined not to get complacent
despite their dominating play.
"It is really hard to tell without
strong competition, . . . how we

played," Landsittel said. "We have
no idea how we are going to compare
to better teams."
Last night, the Cardinal contin
ued its domination with a 96-0 win at
Santa Cruz.
This weekend the Cardinal will
travel to Chico to play Chico State's
large team.
"They have two full sides,"
Strauss said. "Most teams by now
have lost a lot of players, but they still
have two sides. So they must be
doing something right."
Saturday, the men's team (2-4)
was upset by St. Mary's, 25-11, in a
game marred by terrible weather.
"It was horrible, horrible condi
tions," said Stanford head coach
Franck Boivert. "It was very much
an equalizer."
The Cardinal was clearly not in
the game emotionally to begin with.
Then frustration set in.
"We played quite well at one
point and we had very, very good
scoring opportunities and we didn't
punch it in," Boivert said. "And I
think that really played on the nerves
of the team and they started to lose
their marbles."
By the end of the game it was
clear which of the two teams came
prepared to win.
"They had a bigger heart that
day," said team president Jackson
Wagener. "They were more aggres
sive than we were all day long. It is a
team we really should have beaten. It
is a setback."
As the rain fell, Stanford's early
season ball-control problems came
back as the ball slipped from Cardi
nal control repeatedly.
"They controlled the ball a little
bit better," Boivert said. "It is a prob
lem that has been plaguing us since
the beginning of the season. This
year we are very poor in that area
and this is our weakness."
The match was closer than the
score indicated. With less than a
minute to go, the Cardinal trailed 18-
11, so Coach Boivert gambled, ask
ing his players to focus on scoring.
"I asked the players to go all out
in the last minute," Boivert said.
Unfortunately, St. Mary's scored
with only seconds left to widen the
gap-
Now there are worries about the
postseason.
"The implications [of the loss] are
huge," said Boivert. "Our fate is not
in our hands."
The men can still get to the play
offs, but it will take some outside
help.

The Cardinal needs to win and
score more points than others in the
league.
Friday night at 6 p.m., Stanford
hosts a team from Buenos Aires, Ar
gentina.
Since this game does not count in
the Cardinal's standings, the team's
focus in practice is on the March 6
game against California.
