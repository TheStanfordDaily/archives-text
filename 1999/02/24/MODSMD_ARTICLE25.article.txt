# Hippensteel's positive attitude affects team
## Lone freshman makes his mark 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
K.J. Hippensteel is a player who
thrives off the individual battle in a
tennis match. Whereas some athletes
prefer team sports because, if they
lose, the blame is spread among oth
ers, Hippensteel would rather accept
full responsibility.
"I have always loved how tennis is
an individual sport where each match
you have to come up big," Hippen
steel said. "The competition and
pressure of the big points in impor
tant matches is the best part about it
for me. It's all on you."
As the sole freshman on the No. 1
men's tennis team, Hippensteel
seems to have made the leap from the
juniors to the college level with ease.
He is currently ranked 17th in the na
tion in singles and along with his part
ner, senior Ryan Wolters, is ranked
fifth in doubles.
"He has adjusted to college tennis
as well as anyone 1 have seen in my
four years here," Wolters said. "He
definitely has the size and the game to
compete with the best college players
in the nation. With a little more expe
rience, he could be dangerous."
Hippensteel grew up in Roanoke,
Va., and played basketball, football
and golf in addition to tennis in high
school. He had many big moments as
a junior player, but by far his most
memorable was last summer when he
and current high school senior David
Martin won the junior U.S. Open
doubles title. Their win also got them
a wild card into the main draw of the
Open.
"That was the biggest win of my

life as a player," Hippensteel said.
"Those were also the most fun two
weeks I have ever had. Although
David and I lost [in the] first round in
the Open, just being there was in
credible. That is what you dream
about as a junior."
Hippensteel has wasted no time in
accruing his big moments as a Cardi
nal. In the fall he won both the singles
and doubles titles in the Rolex quali
fier at St. Mary's. In the finals of the
singles draw he defeated Wolters,
who was seeded No.l and ranked
fifth in the nation. Later that day, he
and Wolters teamed up to win the
doubles.
"Beating Wolly and getting two ti
tles in the same tournament that early
in the year was huge for my confi
dence," Hippensteel said. "That
made me realize I could compete
with anyone at this level."
Late last month at the Rolex Invi
tational in Dallas, Hippensteel de
feated Ryan Vahaley, who was then
second nationally. Although that
tournament ended on somewhat of a
sour note — he and Wolters did not
do as well as they would of liked in the
doubles — his win over Vahaley
proved that when he beat Wolters it
was no fluke.
Hippensteel is a big lefty who uses
his strong serve and solid ground
strokes to wear down his opponents.
But teammates and coaches cite his
enthusiastic and eager attitude as one
of his major pluses.
"K.J. has a gTeat attitude and is
willing to learn from what we tell
him," said Stanford head coach Dick
