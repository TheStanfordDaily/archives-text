# Hippensteel's positive attitude affects team
## Lone freshman makes his mark 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
K.J. Hippensteel is a player who
thrives off the individual battle in a
tennis match. Whereas some athletes
prefer team sports because, if they
lose, the blame is spread among oth
ers, Hippensteel would rather accept
full responsibility.
"I have always loved how tennis is
an individual sport where each match
you have to come up big," Hippen
steel said. "The competition and
pressure of the big points in impor
tant matches is the best part about it
for me. It's all on you."
As the sole freshman on the No. 1
men's tennis team, Hippensteel
seems to have made the leap from the
juniors to the college level with ease.
He is currently ranked 17th in the na
tion in singles and along with his part
ner, senior Ryan Wolters, is ranked
fifth in doubles.
"He has adjusted to college tennis
as well as anyone 1 have seen in my
four years here," Wolters said. "He
definitely has the size and the game to
compete with the best college players
in the nation. With a little more expe
rience, he could be dangerous."
Hippensteel grew up in Roanoke,
Va., and played basketball, football
and golf in addition to tennis in high
school. He had many big moments as
a junior player, but by far his most
memorable was last summer when he
and current high school senior David
Martin won the junior U.S. Open
doubles title. Their win also got them
a wild card into the main draw of the
Open.
"That was the biggest win of my

life as a player," Hippensteel said.
"Those were also the most fun two
weeks I have ever had. Although
David and I lost [in the] first round in
the Open, just being there was in
credible. That is what you dream
about as a junior."
Hippensteel has wasted no time in
accruing his big moments as a Cardi
nal. In the fall he won both the singles
and doubles titles in the Rolex quali
fier at St. Mary's. In the finals of the
singles draw he defeated Wolters,
who was seeded No.l and ranked
fifth in the nation. Later that day, he
and Wolters teamed up to win the
doubles.
"Beating Wolly and getting two ti
tles in the same tournament that early
in the year was huge for my confi
dence," Hippensteel said. "That
made me realize I could compete
with anyone at this level."
Late last month at the Rolex Invi
tational in Dallas, Hippensteel de
feated Ryan Vahaley, who was then
second nationally. Although that
tournament ended on somewhat of a
sour note — he and Wolters did not
do as well as they would of liked in the
doubles — his win over Vahaley
proved that when he beat Wolters it
was no fluke.
Hippensteel is a big lefty who uses
his strong serve and solid ground
strokes to wear down his opponents.
But teammates and coaches cite his
enthusiastic and eager attitude as one
of his major pluses.
"K.J. has a gTeat attitude and is
willing to learn from what we tell
him," said Stanford head coach Dick

Freshman K.J. Hippensteel, the sole freshman on the No. 1 Stanford
men's tennis team, is currently the nation's 17th-ranked player. He
also combines with Ryan Wolters to form the nation's No. 5 doubles
team.
(iould. "He is a fresh and raw player
in many ways, and so his eagerness to
learn and improve makes his poten
tial that much greater."
Assistant coach John Whitlinger
agreed.
"He's done everything we have
asked of him so far." Whitlinger said.
"His positive attitude rubs off on oth
ers. You can tell he is having fun out
there on the court."
Hippensteel believes that the

team- and coaching-oriented aspects
of college tennis have both allowed
him to have more fun and improve
his game at the same time. He says
that in college tennis he gets the best
of both worlds, because he is still
competing on an individual level, but
he also knows his teammates are
there for support.
"Having Gould and Whit out
there during my matches has helped
me to be a smarter player," Hippen
steel said. "They work on strategy a
lot, like when to be more aggressive
or when to get to the net more, and
the strategy has helped my game. It

gets me thinking situational tennis
more."
Despite his early success, Hippen
steel is fully aware that there are as
pects of his game he needs to im
prove. He appears to he a solid all
around player, hut perhaps could use
a weapon wit h which to punish his op
ponents.
"We are trying to work on his
serve and how he should use it."
Whitlinger said, 'if he can learn to
use his serve in different ways to get
to net more, he'll he that much
tougher to heat."
But Hippensteel says he is very

willing to make the necessary adjust
ments to improve. He says that his
quick start may force him to raise his
goals as a college player.
By far, his primary goal is to win a
national team championship this
May in Athens, Ga., but he now real
izes there is a chance he will qualify
into the singles draw of the tourna
ment.
"I first want to get a team ring,"
Hippensteel said. "Then I would love
to get a ring with Wolly in doubles.
After that, it would be great to quali
fy for the singles and win a round or
two."
