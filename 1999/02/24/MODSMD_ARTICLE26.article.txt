# Synchro splits swimming squads
## 
### Catherine Chen 
The Stanford synchronized swim
ming team headed to Virginia this
past weekend to compete at both the
University of Richmond and at
William and Mary.
The seven-woman squad split into
two, with half of the team competing
against Richmond and Ohio State
University and the other half compet
ing against William and Mary and
Mary Washington College.
Captain Vanessa Shaw explained

that by splitting the team into two
squads last weekend, the Cardinal
was able to face more schools on the
trip. Also, this was the team's one
chance to compete against OSU, who
is quickly proving itself to be Stan
ford's main competition for the
NCAA title.
At Richmond. All-Americans
Julie Enos and Kristi Wright teamed
up to take third in the duet competi
tion. The Buckeyes' A-team won all
events, taking the top two spots in the
duet and sweeping the solo, trio and

team events. Senior Emi Kanayama
also headed to Richmond with Enos
and Wright but was unable to com
pete due to a minor tendon injury.
Meanwhile, an hour away at
William and Mary, the Cardinal once
again showed why it is the national
champion. Shaw took first place in
solo and duet (with freshman Lindsay
Wigginton) and sophomores Paige
Freiheit and Shannon Montague
came in second in duet. Freiheit,
Montague and Wigginton also
teamed up to win the trio competi

tion.
After competing all morning, the
team regrouped at William and Mary
to conduct a training clinic for some
of the age-group and masters syn
chronized swimming clubs in the
area. Stanford head coach Gail
Emery, assistant coach Nathalie
Bartleson and graduate assistant
coach Courtney Harrison worked
with the squad to teach new tech
niques to swimmers 10 to 45 years
