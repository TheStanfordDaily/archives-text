# Table tennis takes two
## Hockey misses Pac-8 playoffs

Ice Hockey: The men's ice hockey
team looks toward next year after an
impressive end-of-season run that
left them barely out of the Pacific
Eight playoffs.
Led by the stellar play of seniors
Sami Jo Small and Tom Terbell, the
team ended the season by winning
five of their last six contests, including
a sweep of California in "Big Ice."

After the victories over Cal, the
Cardinal thought they had locked up
a playoff spot as it jumped past Ore
gon for third place in the conference
standings.
However, unknown to Cardinal
players, all contests after Feb. 1 did
not count in the conference totals.
This ruling by the powers of Pac-8
hockey left the Cardinal one point
behind the Oregon Ducks for the
final playoff spot. The top three
teams make the playoffs in addition
to the host of the event. California is
the host this year, so the Bears go on
to the playoffs despite having a worse
conference record than Stanford.
Especially frustrating to the Car
dinal is the fact that they defeated
both of the top seeds in the tourna
ment, UCLA and USC. The Cardi
nal gave the Bruins their only two
conference losses of the year.
"We were playing our best hockey

at the end of the year." sophomore
D.P. Buck said. "I definitely think we
would have swept through the Pac-8
tournament had we gotten a bid."
Although the Cardinal expects to
return most of its skaters from this
year's team, they do have to fill the
holes left by the losses of both Small
and Terbell.
Despite these losses though, the
Cardinal looks forward to continuing
its late season run into next year. No
significant drop-off in play is expect
ed.
"We lose a couple of key players,
but we'll still be a good team next
year," Buck said. "The Pac-S playoffs
and championship are definitely
goals going into next year."
With the strong finish to the sea
son, the Cardinal finished at .500 in
conference play at 7-7. Its overall
record stands at 9-13 for the year.
Men's Lacrosse: Playing on a field
sophomore Paul Koh called a "mud
pit," the men's lacrosse team man
aged a split of two home contests
played last weekend.
Stanford fell to Sonoma State in a
conference game on Saturday, but
then came back to defeat Pacific on
Sunday in a non-conference affair.
Against Sonoma State, Stanford
stayed close throughout the first half
and only trailed by one at halftime.
However, Sonoma State pulled away
in the second half and won by a score
of 10-6.
In the Sunday contest against Pa
cific, the Cardinal controlled the
match, winning 7-3.
With the victory over Pacific, the
Cardinal ran its overall record to 7-2.
However, the Cardinal has yet to ob
tain a conference win. The loss to
Sonoma State dropped Stanford to 0-
2 in conference play. In a conference
filled with evenly-matched quality
teams, Stanford can't afford to fall
too far off the pace.
"Our conference is strong from
top to bottom. There are a lot of good
teams who could conceivably win the
conference," Koh said.
This weekend Stanford takes on
two more non-conference foes at
home.
On Saturday the Cardinal will do
battle with Humboldt State, and on
Sunday the Cardinal takes on Whitti
er. Both matches are at 1 p.m.

Table Tennis: The men's and
women's table tennis teams each
took home first-place finishes from
last weekend's ACU-I Region 15
championships.
In this tournament, which is essen
tially the California-Nevada singles
championship, Stanford players
emerged victorious in both the men's
and women's competitions.
Vineet "The Wall" Agarwal again
proved to be an unmovable object, as
he swept through the men's field at
Cal State-Fresno to clinch a birth to
the national championships. Agarw
al, as he has done all season, domi
nated the field en route to the title.
In the women's draw, the victor
again donned Cardinal red, as gradu
ate student Shelley Cheng came out
on top. Cheng, much like Agarwal,
showcased a dominating series of
performances in her drive to the title.
Both Agarwal and Cheng ad
vance on to the national champi
onships to be held in Houston from
April 23-24.
