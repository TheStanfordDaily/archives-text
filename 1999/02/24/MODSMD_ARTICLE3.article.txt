Freshman applications are currently
projected to hTt about 18,000 this year, a
number slightly down from last year's
record high of IK.KXy. Applicants this
year will still face some of the toughest
competition in University history for a
coveted place in the Class of 2003.
While Stanford received more appli
cations last year than any other universi

ty in the top live in the U.S. News &
World Report college rankings for 1998,
the number has dropped this year while
the number of applicants to other
schools has increased.
The Yale Daily News reported Yale's
current application numbers are at
13,160 applicants — a record high for
the college. At I JC-Berkeley 30,303 ap
plied for freshman admission — an in
crease from 29.114 applications — of

which about 8,000 will he admitted.
Harvard University has similar num
bers to Stanford, with ahout 18,000 ap
plicants for the Class of 2(M)3. However.
Harvard's total represents an 8 percent
increase from last year, and is just off its
record. Princeton University has yet to
finish tabulating its numbers, but claims
to have a slight increase over its 13,006
application total of last year.
Robert Kinnally, dean of undergrad

uate admissions and financial aid, ex
plained the breakdown of Stanford's
numbers.
A total of 2,608 students applied
under the Early Decision piogram. The
Office of Undergraduate Admissions
sent acceptance letters to 4XI and the re
maining 1,520 were either rejected or
deferred. The breakdown actually
showed an increase in the number
of applicants for regular decision
over last year. The decrease in ap
plications this year came in the
Early Decision round.
"The drop in Early Decision ap
plications is a product of the con
solidation of the Early Decision
rounds. Prospective applicants
have become more aware of how
competitive admission is and they
are being more selective about ap
plying early to Stanford," said Kin
nally. "The number of applicants in
the regular round is actually up by
200."
However, he is still upbeat
about the numbers.
"It's about the place and re
sources of what we have here and
we just keep getting better at it,"
Kinnally said.
Kinnally attributed the still
huge number of applicants partial
ly to Stanford's world-class faculty.
"When we are talking about na
tional issues there is normally
someone connected to Stanford at
that stage. They [the prospective
freshmen] know the prominent
faculty and what projects they are
working on." '
Last year, when application
numbers hit their peak. Kinnally
acknowledged that it could be
more than world-class faculty at
tracting students to Stanford.
"There was a lot of press around
[Chelsea Clinton] coming to a
place called Stanford," he admitted
last year. "Here is a famous high
school student who chose wisely
and came to Stanford."
Freshman Andrew Mac Donald
agreed with the international pub

licity the Stanford faculty receives
as being a factor for prospective
applicants, "The more Nobel
Prizes and other recognition our
professors get, the more people
recognize a school like Stanford.'i
Said freshman Alan Chen,
"Within the past few years, Stan
ford has become more popular
among applicants because they re
alize they can get world-class acad
emics at or above the level of
Ivy League schools."
"The decrease in applicants th)s
year may be because the high
school students who were educated
I
by smaller and not well funded
J I
schools feel that they cannot com
pete with the increased amount of
students coming from highly acad
emic caliber schools who are also
applying. Thus, those students
don't apply." ;
Geographical numbers are ex
pected to stay consistent with the
Class of 2002, which is composed of
only 35 percent of students from
California. "Stanford is still very
much more than a blip on every
one's radar screen — it is a school
that is so high in respect with evefv
high school student," said Kinn^i
iy- I
"The overall pool of applicants
this year is extremely strong, and
we are in the midst of selecting
from an amazing group of very
competitive hopefuls for the Class
of 2003."
Applications to Stanford had
been rising significantly since 199J4.
Stanford has still received
enough applications this year thbt
Kinnally recruited more readers
for his Office of Undergraduate
Admissions.
"We had enough, but we actual
ly hired a few more part-time read
ers this year."
