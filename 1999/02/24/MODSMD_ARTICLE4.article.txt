# Declaration of majors now possible on Axess
## 
### Murtaza Alimohamed 
To those brave souls taking the bold step
and declaring their majors, the process just be
came a whole lot easier.
Students can now declare, drop or change
their majors via Axess. whereas in the past stu
dents had to complete paper forms from the
Registrar's Office.

"We've been wanting to streamline and
make the major declaration process easier,"
said Associate Registrar Gloria Williams.
"We put [the online declaration process] out
there as a service to students to reduce the shut
tling across campus," she explained. "Now they
can get most of the process done via Axess."
The project started in the fall of last year. A
pilot initiative was tested with some students
who had not yet declared their majors.
The new feature, however, is available to
only those declaring majors in departments and
programs that do not require a prior screening

of their prospective students, such as the Psy
chology Department.
Thus, according to Williams, most majors in
the humanities, as well as individually designed
majors and inter-disciplinary programs, are still
on the old system.
In these instances, however, students can
still use the advances in Axess to alert depart
ments of their interest and signal the beginning
of the declaration process.
For example, the program in Human Biolo
gy still requires students to submit a list of po
tential classes of interest, as well as a written
proposal, before getting approval, but students
can use Axess to begin the process.
The latest changes also enable graduating
seniors to check on their progress and raises a
warning flag in case of unfilled requirements or
in case students forget to change their majors.
"Let's say someone declared Economics as
their major but later ended up taking lots of
English classes and forgot to change his or her
major," said Williams. " The system will warn
the student of the discrepancy and enable him
to change his or her major to English directly
online."
Previously, the student would have been re
quired to go to the Registrar's Office in Old
Union and complete paperwork to file changes.
According to Williams, all the changes imple
mented are proceeding smoothly so far.
In addition to the latest innovation, the Reg
istrar's Office is also working to enable students

Reactions from the various de
partments have been largely positive,
according to Williams. "The new pro
cedure has been helpful to them," she
noted, "and they appreciate it."
However, the new system is also
causing departments to re-examine
their own procedures. "Departments
are considering a review of whether
or not they should require prior ap
proval for students intending to de
clare," Williams observed, again cit

ing the Psychology Department as an
example. >
Student reaction has been mixed.
"I think it is a great idea," said unde
clared sophomore Michelle Wang,
"because it will save students a lot of
unnecessary hassle."
Junior Seema Shah, who has al
ready used the system to declare psy
chology while investigating a major
in Human Biology, held a different
view. Although she said the old
process was overly complicated, she
believes the new system to be too im
personal. "I don't think this change is
a good idea. I think the process of de
claring a major should be a big deal."
she said.
