# Faculty debates infill proposal
## 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
More than 1 (X) people attended
a town hall meeting hosted by Stan
ford Campus Residential Lease
holders yesterday evening in Kres
ge Auditorium. The meeting was
called in response to recent admin
istration proposals to alleviate the
shortage of faculty housing.
"We are here tonight to learn
how members want to be repre
sented," said JoAnn Cabrera, pres
ident of the leaseholders' associa
tion.
The proposal, which is not yet fi
nalized, calls for building 36 apart
ments and single-family houses in
campus residential areas and sug
gests three different options to add
faculty housing.
The aspect of the proposal
which incited the greatest debate
was the proposed infill housing
sites, in which housing would be
built on undeveloped land in neigh
borhoods. Many of these tracts of
undeveloped land currently serve
as parks and open space.
"We ask that the University

dedicate these lands as parks," said
Cabrera.
Larry Diamond, senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
was the first scheduled speaker at
the meeting. He supported the ad
ministration's proposal.
"I don't think my view is too
popular in this room," he began. "I
object to unequivocal rejection of
infill anywhere on campus."
"I believe that we are in a hous
ing crisis of unfathomable propor
tions," he continued. "1 would say,
yes, that other proposals have more
promise ... but it is several years
before they can be developed. The
interim 36 units can make a differ
ence in our ability to remain facul
ty."
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner also supported the pro
posed faculty housing. "Given the
status of the housing crisis, it makes
sense to go ahead and do this if
there are no alternatives," he said.
Emeritus Molecular Pharmacol
ogy Prof. Avram Goldstein argued
against the proposed housing. "I
vociferously oppose and will ac
tively resist actions that 1 believe

will be harmful to us all," he said.
"Designating playgrounds as in
fill is not acceptable," Goldstein
said. "It is our right to know that
the playgrounds on which our chil
dren played will be there for their
grandchildren and children after
them."
Goldstein said he was upset
about what he perceived as a lack
of leaseholder representation in
the housing proposal. "The com
munity has the right for meaningful
input to decisions that affect it,"
Goldstein said.
"Although we live in a suburban
paradise," he said, "we are like
serfs on a lord's land."
"The proposed infills are only a
Band-Aid," he added.
At the conclusion of Goldstein's
remarks, the audience erupted into
applause for the first time in the
evening.
Goldstein's opposition to the
housing proposal was echoed by
Dennis Bark, a senior fellow at
Hoover.
"Opinion is sharply divided on
the issue of infill," Bark said. "I be
lieve that the issue is polarizing all

of us."
Bark called for a moratorium on
debate over proposed infill in order
to "let people cool down."
English Prof. John Felstiner said
that he first became aware of the
administration's plans for develop
ment when he saw a worker survey
ing open land next to his house.
"It was Kafka-esque in the liter
al sense of the word when you see
the area where you taught your
children to kick soccer balls being
surveyed without any warning,"
Felstiner said.
In a public letter sent Feb. 19,
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost and
dean of institutional planning and
operations, said that he would be
unable to attend the meeting be
cause of a previous engagement.
He further said that no members of
his staff would be able to attend be
cause of the short notice they were
given.
Cox wrote that between Feb. 10
and March 3 seven neighborhood
meetings will be held to solicit com
munity input and that the Faculty
Senate will discuss the housing pro
posal March 4.
