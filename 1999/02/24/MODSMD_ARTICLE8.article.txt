# Eastside gives EPA its own high school
## 
### Virginia Yang Contributing writer 
Chris Bischof, Class of '92, has
put a high school hack in East Palo
Alto for the first time since
Ravenswood High School closed
down in 1976.
Eastside College Preparatory
opened in 1996 with only eight stu
dents and no permanent location.
After two years, it has grown to 35
students and expects its first gradu
ating class in 1999.
With a 65 percent dropout rate,
East Palo Alto residents have strug
gled when it comes to their chil
drens' education. Since 1976, stu
dents have been bused as far as 15
miles away to Carlmont High
School in Belmont every day for
classes.
This busing requires getting up
early and makes it difficult to par
ticipate in after school activities and
sports. Also as Bischof pointed out.

it makes it harder for parents to get
involved in their children's learning
experience.
Eastside College Prep is aimed
at "students who express interest at
going to college and are going to
take advantage of the resources
made available to them," Bischof
said. All students are on full schol
arships, as the school is funded by
grants from private donors.
With a maximum of 15 students
per class, an extended school day
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and about
three hours of homework per day,
"this school is aimed to prepare all
the students for four-year colleges,
especially the UC system," Bischof
said.
Graduation requirements for
Eastside are substantially more dif
ficult than for most high schools.
Students are required to take four
years of English, math, science, his
tory and a foreign language.
The junior class will be taking

their SATs for the first time in May,
hut based on practice SATs, the stu
dents have made major improve
ments since getting to Eastside.
Students are very excited about
the school. There is a 98 percent at
tendance rate, and many students
stay past 5 p.m. for additional help
and tutoring.
With such a small population,
students also get more of a chance
to participate in extracurricular ac
tivities, such as student government
and the newspaper.
Bischof emphasized the impor
tance of extracurricular activities
because they "encourage students
to develop a positive identity with
the school." Other activities include
the art club, a basketball team and
the National Society of Black Engi
neers, which has been adopted by
the Stanford chapter of the organi
zation.
Bischof got the idea to start this
school after working with the Shoot

for the Stars program, which he
founded in 1991 during his senior
year at Stanford through a Haas
Center summer fellows grant; and
also through programs like
Ravenswood Reads and the East
Palo Alto Stanford Academy Pro
gram.
Many Stanford organizations
and individuals have helped East
side gain its success. Education
Prof. John Baugh sits on the board
of directors. Also, the Alpha Kappa
Alpha sorority has been working
with the female students.
Individual students have been
tutoring at Eastside both as volun
teers and as work-study employees.
Bischof said that Eastside "relies
heavily on Stanford students for tu
toring, and now as the school ex
pands. we need more and more tu
tors."
More information about the
school is available by calling
Bischof at 688-0851.
