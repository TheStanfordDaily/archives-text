A new e-mail newsletter, a collaboration be
tween the Stanford News Service and Stanford
Alumni Association, is the latest way for the asso
ciation, which also has a Web site and publishes
Stanford Magazine, to stay in touch with gradu
ates.
Two weeks ago, the first issue of @Stanford
was sent to some 20,(XX) alumni after four months
of pilot-testing to a group of 1,5(X). The newsletter
is designed to be a monthly record of campus
news, research and events.
"The goal is to keep alums, many of whom are
far away, informed as to what's going on here.
They tend not to see The Daily, and we know they
have an appetite to know what's happening. We
also know they're incredibly busy," explained

Hob Cohn, editorial director of the Alumni Asso
ciation.
is divided into nine sections ranging
from news to events to research to sports, which,
according to Cohn, will make it easier for busy
alums to read.
Under each section there are short summaries
of campus happenings with a link to a Web site,
for example to Stanford News Service, GoStan
ford.com or The Daily, where those who are in
terested can read more about the story of their
choice.
"We're trying to be pushing instead of pas
sive," said Alan Acosta, director of Stanford
News Service, "For those who are interested, it is
quick and timely."
"The idea is to give a dozen to 20 stories in
every newsletter. We want to keep it brief and fre

quent enough so people stay in touch, hut not so
much that they get annoyed," Colin explained.
It has the potential to be particularly effective
considering 84 percent of alumni have an e-mail
address.
The response has been overwhelmingly posi
tive.
"I'm glad to see Stanford is taking advantage of
the Internet. After one newsletter I already feel
like I am back in the Stanford community. This is
a great way to enhance alumni relations with the
school," one alumnus commented in an e-mail re
sponse to (^Stanford.
Although the newsletter is already distributed
to 2(),(XX) alumni, @Stanford plans to increase its
distribution as alumni who receive the e-mail
spread the word, and more alumni add their e
mail addresses to the list.
