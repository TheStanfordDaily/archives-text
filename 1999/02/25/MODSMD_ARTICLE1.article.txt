# Faculty housing solutions cause ire
## 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
The shortage of housing on the
Stanford campus has been an issue
reaching as far back as 1970. raising
concerns and questions about what
should be done to remedy the situation.
It was in response to the growing

problem of faculty housing that University President
Gerhard Casper asked Geoffrey Cox, vice provost and
dean of institutional planning and operations, to coordi
nate a proposal addressing these issues.
In January. Cox, with the help of the University Plan
ning Office, Faculty-Staff Housing, the Office of Govern
ment and Community Relations and the Office of the
Chief Financial Officer, released "Fa .iltv Housing De
velopment Proposals," a 28-page document that de
scribes University plans to add 36 housing units, in exist
ing neighborhoods to help alleviate the housing crunch.
In addition to the increasing unavailability of housing
for faculty, the housing crunch has had the effect of in
creasing the difficulty of recruiting and retaining faculty.
According to the proposal, "In a letter dated June 19,
1998, all 25 department chairs in the School of Medicine
wrote, 'Several recent examples can be cited in which
promising candidates for our faculty declined offers due
to an inability to afford housing in this area. The problem
is significant, pervasive and increasing.' "
There are three proposed options, involving combina
tions of four sites: Dolores Street. Mayfield Avenue,
Gerona / Junipero Serra Boulevard and Frenchman's
Triangle. Each option involves the creation of parks.
This proposal has ignited a great deal of controversy,
as it would call for the construction of houses in neigh
borhood lots that are now vacant. Residents object to the
destruction of land that has for years been enjoyed by fac
ulty and their families.
Perhaps more importantly, residents say that they are
not being given enough say in the University's decisions
on how to use its land.
Stanford Citizen Initiative, a grass-roots effort estab
lished "for the protection of community parks, neighbor
hoods and citizen's rights," has been protesting the "in
fill" development before the January proposal came out.
Last November, some 200 campus homeowners asked
Casper to investigate other options that would ease the
problem but also give residents a voice in the process.
According to Institute for International Affairs Prof.
Stephen Schneider, who posted his comments on the
Stanford Citizen Initiative Web site, the homeowners
asked for the administration to suspend all work on the
"infill" developments until an investigation is led to ex
amine the full range of other alternatives.
They also want the results of these investigations made
known to them, a poll of faculty and staff taken regarding
the alternatives and a strengthened role of residents "in


Cox
the governance of their communi
ties," Schneider wrote.
Many residents have posted com
ments that lament the destruction of
land that children have enjoyed for
decades.
"Open spaces and all the simple
pleasures that come with them are
'priceless,' and, unfortunately, ex
tremely vulnerable," wrote an
anonymous "former resident."
"Once they are taken away they
are gone forever. And the character
of the whole residential area around

them is changed forever."
There are those residents, howev
er, who support the proposed hous
ing developments.
"I do not believe that there is any
reasonable case for preserving the
Mayfield Playfield or the French
man's Triangle as park area," wrote
Political Science Prof. Stephen Kras
ner on the Stanford Citizens Initia
tive Web site.
"The dramatic increase in prices
has made it more difficult to attract
new faculty. My primary concern is to
continue to maintain Stanford as the
extraordinarily vital intellectual envi
ronment that it is now," he said.
Long-term resident Jill Carter

Knuth also posted her support of the
housing proposal.
"When we signed a lease with the
Stanford 30 years ago, our rights and
those of the University were clearly
spelled out," Carter said.
"We understood that we would
not have elected representation," she
added. "If in the future the Universi
ty's interests and ours no longer coin
cided, we had the right to live else
where."
The housing proposal includes an
1899 quote from Jane Stanford,
which reads, "It is desirable that the
members of the faculty and the stu
dents should generally reside upon
the grounds of the University."
