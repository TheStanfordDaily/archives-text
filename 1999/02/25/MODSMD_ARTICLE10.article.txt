Sixth Man Club has
chance to remove
tarnish from image

THE STANFORD MEN S bas
ketball team has a chance to
make history this weekend at
Maples Pavilion. With wins over Ari
zona State tonight and Arizona Satur
day, the Cardinal would clinch at least
a share of the Pacific 10 Conference
title for the first time ever.
This is the weekend the Sixth Man
Club has been waiting for all year, why
students pitched tents in front of
Maples Pavilion weeks before tickets
went on sale, why jeans and a black
long-sleeved shirt will be the most
fashionable outfit on campus tonight.
It's a chance to watch history from a
courtside view.
The Sixth Man Club has a chance to
make some history of its own this
weekend. The club and its 750 black
clad students — famous for loud, orga
nized cheers and infamous for a few
chants that have crossed the bounds of
good taste — can atone for past mis
takes and wipe some of the tarnish off
of its reputation on national television.
Taunting opposing players and
coaches is a disturbing trend that has
spread to college basketball fans across
the country. The head coaches of Indi
ana and Northwestern nearly came to
blows earlier this month after a
postgame argument over the conduct
of Northwestern's fans who had
harassed the Indiana bench all night.
The first time Stanford and Arizona
met this year. Cardinal forward Jarron
Collins had a laser pointer shined in his
eye during a free throw.
When Arizona came to Maples last
year, the Sixth Man Club greeted
Wildcat starting point guard Mike
Bibby with cries of "your dad hates
you" in reference to his rift with his
father, USC men's basketball coach
Henry Bibby. On Feb. 6, the club

embarrassed itself in front of a nation
al audience by chanting "deadbeat
Dad" at Connecticut guard Khalid El-
Amin, a father of two.
Both games showed the ugly side of
an organization that has otherwise
been resoundingly good for Stanford
sports. The Sixth Man Club is the most
concentrated body of support for any
Cardinal team and one of the key rea
sons that Maples has become one of
the toughest places in the country for
visitors to win. But the attacks on
Bibby and El-Amin passed out of the
realm of good sportsmanship.
The Sixth Man Club has a chance at
redemption tonight and Saturday,
when the national spotlight will again
shine on Maples.
When the Fox cameras pan the sea
of black that is the Cardinal student
section Saturday night, we hope they
find a loud, enthusiastic and, most
importantly, classy group. The crowd
should be fired up throughout the
game regardless of the score, possibly
dispelling another negative Stanford
stereotype — that Sixth Man Club
members disappear if the team is los
ing — in the process.
Tonight's game is no less important
to the team or the fans, though Ari
zona State doesn't carry Arizona's
record or national ranking.
A Cardinal victory would make
head coach Mike Montgomery the
winningest coach in Stanford history.
A good performance by the Sixth
Man Club would be a great way to
honor one of the nation's classiest
coaches.
So break out the face paint. Scream
for Arthur Lee, Tim Young, Mark
Madsen and company. Cheer the team
to victory and make Stanford look
good in the process.
One final note: In both the Arizona
team's visit to Maples last year and the
Connecticut game this year, Sixth Man
Club embarrassment coincided with a
Stanford loss. Perhaps this weekend, a
little class will bring some big wins.
