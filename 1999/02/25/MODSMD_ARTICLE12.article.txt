Lopez misrepresents Prop. 209
As a fifth year Stanford student, I was
extremely disappointed in The Daily's
skewed presentation of Pete Wilson's
appointment to the Hoover Institution
("Pete Wilson named Hoover fellow," Feb.
23). Gil Lopez's representation of the under
lying premise of Proposition 2()9 was mis
leading and downright inaccurate.
As Lopez would have it: "Wilson's
appointment is not without controversy. His
support for 19%'s Proposition 2()9, also
known as the California Civil Rights Initia
tive, stirred anger within minority groups
throughout campus. The initiative prevented
public institutions from discriminating on the
basis of gender, race, ethnicity and other
characteristics. The measure, which tried to
eliminate affirmative action in public institu
tions, passed by a large margin."
The fact is, Proposition 2()9 was not about
preventing institutions from discriminating;
such language was indeed borrowed from the
files of the Civil Rights Coalition, the right
wing think tank responsible for the skewed
drafting of the ballot. It doesn't take a rocket
scientist to figure out that to equate the elim
ination of affirmative action programs with
the elimination of discrimination is to pur
posefully ignore history and the true inten
tion of the program itself.
Moreover, because I was on campus dur
ing the proposition's controversy, I can
assure you it was not only "minority groups"
who were up in arms against both the Propo
sition and Governor Wilson's cowardly sup
port of it. At the time, I was proud to see that
University President Gerhard Casper, sever

al members of the Senate (who were white, I
might add), and many other "groups" and
individuals (also white, I might add) also
stood out against the initiative which stood to
reset the history lxx)ks to a time of educa
tional white dominance and minority exclu
sion. I would hope that both Lopez and The
Daily will take better caution in the future
and avoid presenting what they proffer as
"unbiased" editorials using inaccurate and
ill-informed facts to substantiate their stories.

Save open space at end of Row
We are writing to address the plans of
the administration to develop Mayfield
Playfield, Frenchman's Triangle and two
other nearby open spaces on campus. The
administration is proposing to build 12
houses on Mayfield Playfield and / or
Frenchman's Triangle.
In theory, this development should ease
the junior faculty housing crisis. In reality,
the houses that will be built are estimated
to sell at prices that are far out of the range
that these faculty members can afford.
Therefore, the administration's justifica
tion for building these houses seems coun
terintuitive, and it might be more produc
tive to explore other options, including but
not limited to the development of the
Campus West /Stable Site, the Sand Hill
Housing Projects and the Buck Estate.
It is apparent that preserving these open
spaces is important to both students and
faculty. As residents of the end of the Row,

we see that Mayfield Playfield in particular
provides valuable space for members of
the University. The administration has
done very little to solicit student input
regarding this matter, though the students
are clearly concerned. This is exemplified
by the fact that within a 24-hour period, we
collected over 70 signatures from students
at the end of the Row who support the
preservation of these open spaces. Clearly,
this is a University issue affecting all mem
bers of our community, including the stu
dents.
Mayfield Playfield provides students
with an opportunity to gather on an infor
mal basis to play sports, study, fly kites,
interact with neighborhood children and
meet the neighboring students and faculty.
As farfetched as this might sound, it con
tributes to the goals of the Office of Resi
dential Education. Many of the events that
occur on Mayfield Playfield may not be
organized "programs" and therefore may
go unnoticed by the administration. How
ever, the various activities that do occur
provide invaluable learning experiences for
the students. We are especially concerned
about this plan because building on this site
would result in an unrecoverable loss.
We hope that the administration will
consider preserving this and other open
spaces for members of the Stanford com
munity.
