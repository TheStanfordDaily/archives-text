# From the trenches
## Farm life as a local yokel 
### 
Erin Bouchier

I'LL ADMIT IT: I'm
from Menlo Park. No,
not Menlo Park, N.J.,
but Menlo Park down the
street, the one you pass
through to enjoy the fruits
of Costco or the 24-hour
Taco Bell. I grew up some

where between the Secret Safeway and the
Dutch Goose. Mom and Dad's house may
very well be closer to Stanford than to my
high school.
So what is it like being a local kid at Stan
ford? Well, you always run into people you
know. Every Thursday and Saturday I enjoy
waving up to Mom and Dad at Stanford bas
ketball games from my spot with the Sixth
Man Club. On weekends, I regularly bump
into old friends who now work as bartenders
at two local restaurants; the connection
never fails to bring me free food or drinks.
However, bumping into people from
home can happen at very inopportune
times. Last year, I sat at a table next to my
high school history teacher while I was out
on a date. Predictably enough, he decided to
join us and talked for a solid half hour.
But advantages to being local abound.
We save money. We don't have to use our
PAC codes to call home. We drive rather
than fly to school. During freshman orienta
tion, natives have no need to purchase the
standard Stanford sweatshirt, as we've prob
ably had one since fourth grade.
Proximity to home can be nice. When
really sick, a local kid can return home to a
bowl of Mom's chicken soup rather than
attempting to recover amidst the craziness
of dorm life, replete with the neighbors'

gospel music blaring at 7 a.m.
Sickness is not the only impetus to head
home; dirty clothes are a strong (smelling)
stimulus. A native friend recently revealed
that he has never done his laundry at Stan
ford in his nearly three years on the Farm.
Guess he could never find enough quarters.
The benefits to being a local don't end
there. Natives tend to know where they're
going, whether trekking to Tahoe or simply
venturing to the AMC Mercado. Better yet,
we know how to employ all the Bay Area
backroads when pressed for time. However,
we too are subject to getting lost. Just ask
the people I drove with on our frosh ski trip.
Local kids, quite naturally, become the
dorm experts on where to go in the Bay
Area. Some dormmate questions are fairly
simple like, what's a good Italian restaurant
in the area? Other questions are more diffi
cult. Someone once asked me where he
should go to have his rug cleaned. Simple
enough, right? He then complicated things
by inquiring if there was a body-piercing
place nearby the rug cleaners, because he
wanted to get all his errands done at once. I
was a bit bewildered. In these areas, local
kids have no more expertise than anyone
else.
We have our own lingo. When a native
says he needs to pick something up at Stan
ford, he's not referring to the University but
to the Shopping Center. When thirsting for
a healthy blend of fruit, he heads not to
Jamba Juice but to "Juice Club," using the
store's original name. Contrary to popular
belief, slang for cities such as Frisco, San Jo
and Oaktown are definitely not part of the
vernacular. The term "bopper" equates to

snob. And a "lurk" (or "lurker") is someone
who seems really out of place.
Family and friends, all non-boppers and
non-lurks, also enjoy the fruits of Stanford.
My sister, before she headed to college her
self. enjoyed coming to parties at Stanford
when high school social life wasn't cutting it
(although Exotic Erotic frightened her a
bit).
Similarly, when my friends from home
are back in town, they always come to visit.
They have the opportunity to meet my new
friends. Later, when I tell the Menlo Park
crew a story about the escapades of my Stan
ford friends, it's much more meaningful
because they actually know the people
involved. The end result is that my sister,
friends from home and parents have truly
gotten to know my friends here.
So after cost-benefit analysis, what do we
think of life at Stanford for a local? For me,
life here is nothing like it was the 18 years
before I came.
I enjoy an entirely new group of friends,
people who grew up all over this country
and beyond. I live on my own, with a room
mate, in a dormitory, on a campus filled with
thousands of other people my age. Although
I only moved a few minutes away, I feel as if
I've entered a new world.
But when I want a taste of the old world,
I can still hop in the car and visit Mom and
Dad on my wav to the Dutch Goose.
