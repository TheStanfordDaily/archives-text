## Student action vital to achieving economic diversity 
### 
Does Stanford university
have a vision for an economically
diverse student body? Now that a
Stanford undergraduate education costs
$I,(XX) per week, how does Stanford plan to
recruit and retain students from a full range
of social class backgrounds?
Last Ihursday, 12 students including
mysell met with Robert Kinnally, dean of
admission and financial aid. and Cynthia
Hartley, director of student awards, to pose
just those questions. We called the meeting
out of concern that next year's tuition, room
and board had been increased 3.5 percent
without a similar increase in financial aid
funding.
What role does Stanford play in perpetu
ating inequality? Stanford is a gateway to
advantage. Many of us will one day hold
positions of power, and connections we
make at Stanford may help us find jobs or
influence policy. Here we can help professors
with cutting-edge research or start our own
research projects. A resume sporting the
name Stanford may itself unlock dix>rs. II
these privileges are available only to those
who can already afford them, Stanford is

complicit in reproducing society's class dif
ferences.
These administrators are quick to point
out that the median family income of Stan
ford students on financial aid is $58.(XX).
which is lower than that of students at
schools like Harvard and Berkeley. We
asked that Stanford compare itself not only
to other elite institutions but to the median
income of families in the United States,
which is significantly lower. Talented stu
dents come from all class backgrounds.
Shouldn't Stanford strive for a student body
economically representative of the country?
Students from low-income backgrounds
may already have overcome obstacles to
prove themselves. Underfunded public
schools often cannot offer the same quality
education as private schools. High school stu
dents who must work part-time lose oppor
tunities to participate in extracurricular activ
ities which round out a college application.
They must spend summers working rather
than traveling or participating in summer
programs. The student who succeeds regard
less of such obstacles should be able to attend
Stanford. Yet such students may believe

Stanford is financially out of reach and save
their application money for loss expensive
colleges. Some middle-class high school stu
dents may not apply because they fear they
won't qualify for financial aid.
The Financial Aid Office attempts to
change such perceptions through outreach at
high schools. But outreach programs may
never touch students at schools that lack
guidance counselors. Dean Kinnally agreed
with the importance of expanding efforts to
reach students from all economic hack
grounds.
The cost of Stanford may also deter stu
dents who want to pursue futures in low-pay
ing fields. While many computer scientists or
engineers will be able to pay off loan burdens
relatively quickly, artists, activists and educa
tors may be repaying college loans into
retirement. Hut shouldn't these students be
able to get a top-notch education?
Some students may choose to study a field
they perceive to be lucrative, pushing other
interests aside. While a personal decision, it
saddens me that for some students, choice of
major must be a cost-benefit analysis rather
than a commitment to their communities or

a pursuit of intellectual passion.
I his issue affects all of us. The diverse
interests and backgrounds of the student
body create a more dynamic interaction and
exchange of ideas. When many students
choose majors they believe lead to high-pav
ing jobs, some departments are weakened or
disappear, and we all lose opportunities to
learn.
If we, as students, believe in economic
diversity at Stanford, we must make a per
sonal commitment to taking action to bring it
about. We have three primary responsibili
ties.
First, we must tell the administration that
all forms of diversity matter to us and should
be high priorities for Stanford. Kinnally and
Hartley proved welcoming and attentive;
they and other administrators want to hear
student opinions. They encouraged us to
continue to talk informally with administra
tors and to speak through our representa
tives on University committees. Students
have three spots on the Committee for
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid (CIJAI A). Do you know what these
students are saying on your behalf? I don't.

We should all know what's going on in the
administration, rather than just reacting t<>
decisions handed down from above.
Second, we must call for better student
representation. CUAFA students report to a
committee that reports to a committee th;{t
reports to the people who actually vote oh
tuition (pretty powerful, huh?). Stanford stu
dents have no direct representation on
Board of Trustees. Tuition decisions withoijt
representation? We need a voting studerjt
member of the Board of Trustees.
Finally, we must make Stanford a wel
coming place for all students. Some students
feel overburdened by hours of work on top
of their academic load. Some feel that sum
mer travel and research are taken for grant
ed by those who don't need to make money
during the summer.
Class is a silent but important issue on
campus. We need to start talking to each
other and to the administration about it. Wfe
need to envision a socially and economically
diverse university and act on that vision. ?
