The Stanford women's swimming and diving teams
have three.
Arizona, US(' and California are all hoping that 1999 is
the year they dethrone the Pacific 10 Conference's colos
sus of the water.
The Cardinal has bullied its Pac-10 competition for
more than a decade, taking first in each of the 12 years that
the division has existed. Hut this year, three very strong
teams have emerged as a threat to Stanford's dominance.
Today, tomorrow, and Saturday, the Cardinal, tied for
second in the national rankings, will have to fend off fierce
competition to capture its 13th title in as many years at the
Pac-10 Championships in Federal Way. Wash.

At 9-2 (4-1 in the Pac-10), Stanford will travel to Wash
ington with its poorest dual-meet season record in over 10
years. But statistics do not tell the whole story of this Car
dinal team. Stanford's two losses came in the desperate
month of January, when illness and injury left the team in
shambles. At its low point, the Cardinal sent only nine
swimmers, less than two-thirds of its swimming contin
gent. to compete against Pac-10 rival Arizona.
After losses to NCAA powerhouse Georgia and co-
No. 2 Arizona, the Cardinal regrouped and won all its re
maining dual-meets, including a squeaker over rival Cal.
Now. with its health regained and its spirits high, Stan
ford looks to squash the hopes of any team with the gall to
try to steal its crown.
"We always have certain expectations going into Pac
10s." Stanford junior Jessica Amey said. "We're always
looking to end up on top."
"1 think our chances for a win are very good," added se
nior Allison Fealey. "We have a lot of tradition riding on
this. People will be putting in everything they have. It's a
very important meet for us."
Unlike some past years, however, the battle for this
year's Pac-10 Championship will not be a walk in the park.
Undoubtedly in the strongest division in college swim
ming and diving. Stanford, Cal. IJSC and Arizona cur
rently account for four of the top six teams in the nation.
There is no clear favorite going into this weekend's
competition, because each of the top-four contenders has
experienced both sides of an upset this season. Despite
giving Stanford a stunning defeat in January. Arizona was
crushed by USC early in the season. The Trojans, mean
while, have fallen to three Pac-10 teams: Stanford. Cal and
UCLA. Cal has proved to be the darkhorse competitor.
{•rising from its lowly position near the
*jK}ttom of the Pac-10 through much
£)f the '90s to stun IJSC and nearly
;!fcnap its 25 dual-meet losing streak
'jngainst the Cardinal.
I'he Cardinal will be led by red
■ijhot sophomore Misty Hyman. In past
l;jweeks, Hyman has exploded in the
'butterfly and backstroke events,
nearly equaling her NCAA-winning
Mimes from last season. Now, well

rested and prepared, Hyman will
look to recapture the three individual
events she won at last year's Pac-l()s.
Another Cardinal swimmer hop
ing to reclaim three Pac-10 titles is ju
nior Catherine Fox. At last year's
meet. Fox took the 100-yard freestyle
and backstroke events and tied for
first in the 50-yard freestyle with
teammate Siobhan Cropper.
Along with its star swimming
power, Stanford will also bring the
finest diving squad in the Pac-10 con
ference. Exemplified in the close
meet with Cal, the diving team has

been an integral part of Stanford's
success. In the battle for this year's
Pac-10 title, the Cardinal's diving
contingent could prove to be the de
ciding factor.
Unlike the swimmers, the divers
will be confronted with a format that
is different from a dual-meet format.
Whereas in a dual-meet the divers
would complete six dives, champi
onship meets such as the Pac-lOs re
quire divers to complete 11 dives dur
ing the three-meter competition and
10 dives during the one-meter com
petition.
