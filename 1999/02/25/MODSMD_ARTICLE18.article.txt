# Stanford women face Arizona schools
## 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
This year. Stanford (15-10, 11-3 Pacific 10 Conference) women's basket
ball has been inconsistent, had more turnovers than your average bakery and
seen its home court advantage disappear with losses to UCLA and Wash
ington.
The Cardinal has also grown by leaps and bounds, had players emerge
with each game and with two more weekends of Pac-10 play remaining, finds
itself only a game and a half out of first place.
This weekend Stanford travels to Arizona for battles against the Sun
Devils (11-12.5-9) on Thursday and the Wildcats (14-9,9-5) on Saturday.
"I think a lot's on the line for us because of the opportunity to play in the
NCAA tournament," said Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
While on paper Arizona is clearly the team that can give Stanford the
more trouble, the ( ardinal cannot afford to overlook Arizona State.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Tonight: Stanford at Arizona State (11-2,5-9), 7:30 p.m.

Arizona State's offensive weapons are many, including forward Theresa
Jantzen who leads the team with more than 11 points per game, and Michelle
Tom. who leads the Pac-10 in three-point percentage with 43 percent.
"We have to get out on them. We can't let them sit out there and shoot
shots," VanDerveer said. "It's going to be a tough game against both teams.
We need our team really focused and coming out like we did when we swept
in Washington and swept down in L.A. Personally our team likes playing on
the road."
This year the road has been favorable to the Cardinal, as it has been 6-1,
while dropping two games at Maples Pavilion for a 5-2 record at home.
Sophomore center Carolyn Moos has really come up big recently, leading
the team with 14.1 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. She has had three dou
ble-doubles in the last four games and the traveling problem that plagued her
early in the season has nearly become nonexistent.
The team member enabling Moos to get the ball inside has been junior
point guard Milena Flores, who is second in the Pac-10 with 6.76 assists per
game and who leads the conference in free-throw shooting.
After a tough game on Thursday the Cardinal will have to regroup and
face Arizona on Saturday at Mckale Center. The Wildcats are fourth in the
conference standings and have dropped only one game at home the entire
season.
*i think [playing two tough teams in a row is] just the nature of the Pac
10. That's what you have to do." VanDerveer said. "It has been hard. Wash
ington struggled down there. Oregon struggled down there. We know its
Desert Storm. We have to go down there and get the job done."
Arizona is led by forward Angela Lackey, who was the leading scorer for
the Wildcats the last time the two teams met. The Wildcats are also a threat
from beyond the arc, with guard Lisa Griffith as the most prolific on the team.
Arizona's offense is dynamic enough to be second to only UCLA in the
Pac-10. but rebounds have been a problem for it. When the teams met at
Maples, the Cardinal outrebounded the Wildcats 42-2K. Since then. Moos
has been grabbing even more boards per game, and the difference in the
game could come down to who gets the most second and third chances on of
fense.
However, the biggest advantage for the Wildcats could be their speed, an
advantage that they have used to cause over 12 turnovers a game, good
enough for third in the Pac-10. Stanford has had a turnover problem all sea
son. and will have to be wary against the speedy Cats.
"It's going to be a verv tough road trip lor us. Our teams excited and we're
building off a good win against WSIJ," VanDerveer said. "We have confi
dence after going down to L.A.. and I expect we'll play really well."
