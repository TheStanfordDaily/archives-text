### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
There is no more preparation. The endless hours of
practice, going over takedowns hundreds of times and
pushing the limits of endurance culminate into a single
weekend — this weekend.
Burnham Pavilion will be the stage on Saturday
and Sunday as Stanford hosts the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Wrestling Championships, which determine
who competes in the national tournament held next
month.

WRESTLING
■ Saturday-Sunday: Pacific 10 Championships, all day.
Burnham Pavilion.

Each team is allowed one wrestler in each of the 10
weight classes to compete in a single elimination tour
nament. If a wrestler is knocked out before the finals,
he will compete in the consolation bracket which will
determine third and fourth place. The top four will
then go onto nationals.
The team race will be close as No. 11 C'al State-Bak
ersfield (14-5-1. 7-0-1 Pacific 10 Conference) will bat
tle contenders No. 12 Arizona State (11-8-1,2-1-1 )and
No. 16 Oregon State (13-8. 6-1) for the conference
title.
A strong showing by Stanford (4-7,2-5) should land
it in the middle of the pack, most likely behind No. 25
Boise State (10-7,5-3).
" This is a great chance for us to come together be
cause this is what the whole season comes down to."
said junior captain Zach Zimmerer (133 lbs.).All our
focus has been on this tournament for a shot at na
tionals."
Zimmerer represents Stanford's best shot at an in
dividual title. He is ranked 16th nationally and is a
two-time NCAA qualifier who finished fourth and
second in the previous two Pac-10 championships. He

has complied a 20-4 record and
placed first at both the California
Open and Aggie Open earlier this
season.
"If he is healthy and has his mind
in the right place, he could win the
Pac-10 and bean All-American this
year," said Stanford head coach
Chi is Horpel.
Zimmerer will have his hands
full with No. 4 Arizona State fresh

man Eric Larkin (20-3) and Oregon
State sophomore Ben Richards,
who placed third at last year's Pac
l()s. Zimmerer lost to Richards 6-5
in November, hut he has steadily
improved as the year has pro
gressed, so this should not he a fac
tor in their match-up.
Senior captain Beau Weiner will
be a threat in the 157-pound race
and potentially represents another
Cardinal title. Weiner has two fifth
places and a third place in previous
Pac-10 tournaments. He is 20-6 on
the year and took fifth in the Cali

fornia Open and first in the Aggie
Open and the All-California Invita
tional.
"If I wrestle like I know I can and
how I have in the past week, I have a
shot at the title,'" Weiner said.
"Everyone has high points on the
year and if I can re-create mine for
this tournament, I think I have as
much right to the title as anyone else."
Weiner's main competition will
he No. 4 Boise State junior Larry
Ouisel, who has complied a 23-2
record on the season. Weiner will
also have to deal with No. 17 Ore

gon senior Daryl Christian and No.
20 Oregon State sophomore Eric
Jorgenson in order to reach the fi
nals.
A major loss for the Cardinal in
volved standout junior Warren
McPherson (165), who tore a liga
ment in his knee Feb. 14 against Cal
State-Fullerton. The injury will not
require surgery, but will prevent
him from wrestling this weekend.
Junior Rudy Ruiz (125), senior
Shane Cross (174) and junior Tim
Kendall (184) are other possible
placers for Stanford. All will have to

wrestle the tournament of their
lives for them to reach nationals.
Ruiz will have to get by Arizona
State sophomore Matt Azevedo
and Cal State Bakersfield junior
Moses Deflin, who are ranked sev
enth and eighth respectively. Also
on the mat for Ruiz will be No. 15
freshman Nathan Navarro of Ore
gon State. With one big upset, Ruiz
could set himself up to finish in the
top four.
" I think everyone is ready to go,"
Zimmerer said. "If everyone can
stay focused and wrestle their best.

we might qualify six or seven."
Cross and Kendall's weights are
dominated by returning All-Ameri
cans, senior David Wells of Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo (174) and
Arizona State senior Casey Strand
(184), who are both ranked fifth na
tionally. Beyond these competitors.
Cross and Kendall both have a le
gitimate shot of competing with
anyone else in their bracket.
"Everyone needs to step up be
cause if you lose in this tournament,
there is no tomorrow or second
chances," Weiner said.
