### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
There is no more preparation. The endless hours of
practice, going over takedowns hundreds of times and
pushing the limits of endurance culminate into a single
weekend — this weekend.
Burnham Pavilion will be the stage on Saturday
and Sunday as Stanford hosts the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Wrestling Championships, which determine
who competes in the national tournament held next
month.

WRESTLING
■ Saturday-Sunday: Pacific 10 Championships, all day.
Burnham Pavilion.

Each team is allowed one wrestler in each of the 10
weight classes to compete in a single elimination tour
nament. If a wrestler is knocked out before the finals,
he will compete in the consolation bracket which will
determine third and fourth place. The top four will
then go onto nationals.
The team race will be close as No. 11 C'al State-Bak
ersfield (14-5-1. 7-0-1 Pacific 10 Conference) will bat
tle contenders No. 12 Arizona State (11-8-1,2-1-1 )and
No. 16 Oregon State (13-8. 6-1) for the conference
title.
A strong showing by Stanford (4-7,2-5) should land
it in the middle of the pack, most likely behind No. 25
Boise State (10-7,5-3).
" This is a great chance for us to come together be
cause this is what the whole season comes down to."
