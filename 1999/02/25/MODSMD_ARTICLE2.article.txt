## Montgomery tries for all-time win mark, team chases Pac-10 title 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
When Mike Montgomery came to Stanford, all anyone
ever said was, "You just can't win at that school."
Boy, did he ever prove them wrong.
With a win tonight against Arizona State, Mont
gomery would become the all-time winningest coach in
the history of Stanford men's basketball, surpassing
Howie Dallmar with win No. 258.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Tonight No. 6 Stanford (22-5, 12-2) vs. Arizona State
(14-12,6-8) 7:(X) p.m. at Maples Pavilion.

"It is significant to me, for two reasons," Montgomery
said. "One is, because of the respect with which I hold
Howie Dallmar and the job that he did here and the num
ber of people that he affected. And two, because I've al
ways felt that making your mark someplace and being
able to be someplace long enough to be that person, for
example, was kind of what this business is about."
Montgomery has certainly made his mark on the Farm,
defining his career by making the impossible happen.
Last spring, he guided the Cardinal to its first appear
ance in the Final Four in 56 years.
And if the Cardinal sweeps the Arizona schools this
weekend, Stanford will clinch at least a share of its first
ever Pacific 10 Conference Championship.
Everyone is pointing to Saturday nights showdown
between Stanford and the Arizona Wildcats as the game
of the regular season for the Cardinal.
A win over Arizona would be the sweetest possible
scenario for the Cardinal. What better way to clinch its
first title than knocking off the team that has won eight
championships in the Pac-10's 20-year existence?
Stanford is also looking to avenge last month's heart
breaking 78-76 loss at the buzzer.
But none of that will matter unless the No. 6 Cardinal
(22-5,12-2 Pac-10) can get by Arizona State (14-12,6-8)
