## Montgomery tries for all-time win mark, team chases Pac-10 title 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
When Mike Montgomery came to Stanford, all anyone
ever said was, "You just can't win at that school."
Boy, did he ever prove them wrong.
With a win tonight against Arizona State, Mont
gomery would become the all-time winningest coach in
the history of Stanford men's basketball, surpassing
Howie Dallmar with win No. 258.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Tonight No. 6 Stanford (22-5, 12-2) vs. Arizona State
(14-12,6-8) 7:(X) p.m. at Maples Pavilion.

"It is significant to me, for two reasons," Montgomery
said. "One is, because of the respect with which I hold
Howie Dallmar and the job that he did here and the num
ber of people that he affected. And two, because I've al
ways felt that making your mark someplace and being
able to be someplace long enough to be that person, for
example, was kind of what this business is about."
Montgomery has certainly made his mark on the Farm,
defining his career by making the impossible happen.
Last spring, he guided the Cardinal to its first appear
ance in the Final Four in 56 years.
And if the Cardinal sweeps the Arizona schools this
weekend, Stanford will clinch at least a share of its first
ever Pacific 10 Conference Championship.
Everyone is pointing to Saturday nights showdown
between Stanford and the Arizona Wildcats as the game
of the regular season for the Cardinal.
A win over Arizona would be the sweetest possible
scenario for the Cardinal. What better way to clinch its
first title than knocking off the team that has won eight
championships in the Pac-10's 20-year existence?
Stanford is also looking to avenge last month's heart
breaking 78-76 loss at the buzzer.
But none of that will matter unless the No. 6 Cardinal
(22-5,12-2 Pac-10) can get by Arizona State (14-12,6-8)

With a Cardinal victory against Arizona State tonight at Maples Pavilion, Mike Montgomery would sur
pass Howie Dallmar as Stanford men's basketball's all-time winningest coach.
tonight at Maples Pavilion.
Judging from the last time these
two teams met — at the Wells Fargo
Arena in Tempe, Ariz., last month —
that will be no easy task for Stanford.
In Tempe. the Cardinal ran into a
red-hot Sun Devil squad and trailed
by as many as 11 points in the first
half. Eddie House and Mike Batiste
scored 31 of ASU's 37 points and led
ASU to a six-point halftime lead.
Fortunately for Stanford, the Car
dinal went on a 16-0 run over an
eight-minute span in the second half
to pull out a 73-63 victory.
But the fact remains that Arizona
State is quite capable of beating Stan
ford — just as it did a season ago at
Maples, one of the Cardinal's two
home losses all year.
"We're concentrating on Arizona
State," Montgomery said. "Oregon
played great against them, and they

came back out Saturday and played
great against Oregon State, shut them
out. Really generated a lot of energy.
So our focus is clearly on Arizona
State, and then we'll figure out what
to do with Arizona come Saturday."
Sitting in fifth place in the Pac-10
at 6-8, the Sun Devils are dying for a
late-season run. If ASU could get to
.500 in the conference, it would have
a decent chance to slide into the field
of 64 in the NCAA Tournament.
Tonight is the second-to-last
home game in the careers of the five
outstanding Stanford seniors: Arthur
Lee, Peter Sauer, Mark Seaton, Kris
Weems and Tim Young.
Over the course of their careers,
this fivesome has helped lead the Car
dinal to a 115-35 record, changed the
face of the program and pioneered
last year's run to San Antonio.
Young committed to Stanford
months before the signing period,
triggering a string of recruiting suc
cesses for Montgomery and his staff.
Lee opted to come to Stanford

over more traditional basketball
schools, which paid off with a place on
the cover of Sports Illustrated.
These five have witnessed the evo
lution of Stanford into a powerhouse.
They and Montgomery have realized
the hcx>p dreams of players such as
Todd Lichti and Brevin Knight.
They had a taste of college basket
ball's sweetest nectar — the Final
Four — last year, and are now hun
grier than ever to get right back to
that Promised Land.
Stanford is on a roll, coming off a
big sweep of the Washington schools,
highlighted by a 32-point blowout of
the Huskies in Seattle.
And tonight, just like every other
night in the splendid careers of these
five seniors, the task will be simple —
focus on the game at hand.
"We're into the point in the season
where we've got to just win games,
and we're probably pretty aware that
the league's good enough that you
can't afford to not be ready to play
everv night out," Montgomery said.
