# Volley battles USC — again
## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
A positive aspect of the repetitive nature of schedules
within the Pacific Division of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation is that the system lets teams avenge earlier loss
es.
That's just what the No. 12 Stanford men's volleyball
team (4-6,3-6 MPSF) will try to do when it takes on the No.
10 USC Trojans (6-4, 5-3) tonight at 6 p.m. in Burnham
Pavilion.
The Cardinal will seek to avenge the loss the team suf
fered at USC on Feb. 6.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 12 Stanford (4-6,3-6) vs. No. 10 USC (6-4,
5-3), 6:00 p.m. Burnham Pavilion.

During the MPSF season, the seven teams that com
prise the Pacific Division compete against each other twice
and each Mountain Division school once. Because Stan
ford and I fSC both belong to the Pacific Division, tonight's
game is the second and final matchup between the schools.
Tonight's matchup holds similar importance for both
teams.
Both the Trojans and the Cardinal look to snap losing
streaks. Stanford has dropped its last two games, two three
game decisions to Loyola Marymount and Pepperdine.
After kicking off MPSF competition with a five-game
winning streak, the Trojans have since faltered and lost
their last three MPSF matches.
Only the top-three finishers from each division of the
MPSF as well as the two teams with the strongest overall
records will have the opportunity to continue into postsea
son play.
I JSC is currently in second place in the Pacific Division,
two games behind Long Beach State. Stanford, however,
sits in fifth place, 4.5 games behind Long Beach.
"We are in a position where every league match could
determine our play-off opportunities," said head coach
