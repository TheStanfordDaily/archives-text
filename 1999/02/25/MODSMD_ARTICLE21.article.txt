# Spring break exchange
## Club hosts Japanese students 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
Ten Japanese students, seven
from Keio University in Tokyo and
three from Doshisha University in
Kyoto, are spending one month on
campus to learn about life at Stan
lord.
The annual exchange program is
arranged entirely by volunteer stu
dents in the Japan Exchange Club.
The Japanese students are on
campus from Feb. 5 to March 6, their
spring vacation. The exchange is re
versed in July and August, when
Stanford students visit Japanese uni
versities.
Senior Rachel Brunette, co-pres
ident of the Japan Exchange Club,
said the students are living with 30
hosts in different dormitories, co
ops and graduate housing. "They
stay with each host for a week and a
half so they can experience different
cultures," she said.
The club has planned activities
for every day. Educational ones in
clude visiting a nursing home and
teaching a second-grade class in East
I'alo Alto about Japanese culture.
Social activities include visiting
Napa, Santa Cruz, Monterey and
San Francisco, taking a ballroom
dancing class and attending on-cam
pus performances of groups such as
the I Jniversity singers.
Brunette, who is majoring in East
Asian Studies, got involved fresh
man year as a hosting coordinator.
She spent a year living in Japan and
attending a high school.
"This is a way to help other stu
dents from Japan have a positive ex
perience here," she explained,
adding that many Stanford students
continue friendships with the ex
change students.

"We're trying to give them an
intro to university life, however typ
ical Stanford is," Brunette said. She
also hoped the students gain knowl
edge of American social issues.
They applied to the program
through international exchange
clubs at their universities. Each stu
dent was struck by different aspects
of Stanford life.
First impressions
Mali Nakayama, a freshman at
Keoi, called America an "excessive
ly consuming" country, noting that
the Japanese use handkerchiefs in
stead of toilet paper and can't adjust
the water pressure in the shower.
Akiko Morita, a freshman at
Doshisha, noticed the diversity.
"There's lots of different kinds" of
students, she said. "They know when
to have fun, when to study."
She said she liked the trips to San
Francisco and Napa and said,
"kayaking was fun but it was very
cold."
"I just like hanging around here,
going to the CoHo and feeling like
one of the students."
The campus
Morita was surprised by the Stan
ford Hand. "I didn't have that image
in mind — they're wild," she said.
"I wish Japan had housing on
campus where you live together,"
she said. "It's really good because if
you live with [students], you get to
know them."
"In Japan, the dorms are off cam
pus. It's a totally different environ
ment. It would be a lot of fun to go
here," Morita added.
She was also impressed by the
si/e and beauty of the campus. Even

though her friends told her that the
campus was pretty, she said," 1 didn't
expect it to be this pretty."
Universities in Japan and America
Yasuhiro Kikuchi, a senior at
Keio, said he came to Stanford be
cause it was his last vacation. "I want
to make a good memory." He also is
interested in attending Stanford for
his MBA.
Keiya Mizutani, a freshman at
Doshisha, said he was thinking of
going to an American university for
his MBA and wanted to get experi
ence here. He said he expected Stan
ford to be a representative universi
ty with a general education, as op
posed to MI T.
"Everyone [at Stanford] studies
really hard," he said.
Morita used to live in the United
States and moved to Japan for her
father's job. She also wants to attend
graduate school in America.
She also found that students in
the United States are "more stu
dious than in Japan, with more
school spirit."
Morita was impressed by the stu
dent participation in an internation
al law class. "The teacher didn't
speak much. He just wrote down
what they said on the board. The stu
dents must have done a lot of read
ing beforehand," she said.
Kikuchi attended classes in
macroeconomics, Japanese business
culture, Japanese language and
American history.
Kikuchi said, "The professors are
eager to teach so seriously — it's a
big difference from Japan."
He was also struck by the size of
the Japanese classes. "Many, many
students are interested in Japan," he
added.
