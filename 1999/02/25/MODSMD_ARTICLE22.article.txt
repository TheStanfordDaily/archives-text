## Nobel economist explains work on 'function of social choice'

Kenneth Arrow, Nobel Prize
winning emeritus professor of eco
nomics, gave a lecture to an audi
ence of about 50 last night at Braun
Music Center. About a third of the
crowd was undergraduates, marking
the first time in two years Arrow lec
tured to undergraduates at Stanford.
Since he no longer gives courses.
Arrow found this forum a unique
opportunity to explain some of his
most current economic theories.
"( This forum] is a brand new idea
and something that has never been
done before," Arrow said. "1 en
joyed it."
Arrow discussed his current re
search interest and area of study,
collective decision making. After

lecturing for an hour, he fielded sev
eral questions including some about
the significance and effects his poli
cies will have over time and his cur
rent opinion on the Microsoft anti
trust lawsuit.
He related the issue to his re
search in that both sides in the trial
are framing their appeals in social
terms.
"The argument now is what is
good for the people — the welfare of
the consumer and not what rights
Microsoft has," Arrow stated.
The Stanford Economics Associ
ation. made up of students in the de
partment, organized the event. Co
ordinator Gautam Venkatesan. a
sophomore, stressed the importance
of the event to graduate and under
graduate students. "This is probably
one of the few opportunities that
people are going to get to hear him
speak."
Amartya Sen, the 1998 Nobel
Prize winner in economics, has
called Arrow the world's greatest
living economist and credits him
with the inspiration for his own re
search and policies.

"He is generally accepted as the
premier economist of the 2()th cen
tury," said sophomore Hector
Calderon, coordinator of the event
and co-director of SEA. "There is no
one [economist] more renowned or £
well known that's still alive." 'J.
Arrow deals mainly in the theo
retical side of economics, Calderon .
said, and his theories are often un- •
popular because they are not "very ,
politically attractive." I
"People don't really understand '
economics, so they don't think [his J
theories] will work socially," !
Calderon said.
The only faculty member in the j
Economics Department with a •
Nobel Prize, Arrow was recognized
for his contributions to the equilibri
um and welfare theory. Arrow pre
viously held positions at Harvard £
and the University of Chicago and
was the president of the American ;
Economic Association. J
Although Arrow was unsure |
when he would address undergradu
ates again, Venkatesan said he
thought an occasion such as this was
"very rare."
