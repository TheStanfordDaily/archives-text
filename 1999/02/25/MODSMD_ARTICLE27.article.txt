# All-American team captain Tam inspires in and out of pool
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
Whether she's writing short sto
ries, planning wilderness hikes or

leading the Stanford women's water
polo team to another win, senior
Lindsay l am is always an inspiration
to the people around her.
Tarn began playing water polo in

her freshman year at Punahou High
Schcx)l in Honolulu, Hawaii. As the
only girl on the squad, water polo was
a challenge from the start.
"It was something to do in the off
season," said Tam, who was a dedi
cated swimmer in high school. "1 just
decided to do it and 1 couldn't quit,
even though it was hard."
When Tam came to Stanford, she
was a part of the first recruited class of
female water polo athletes. Before
the 1995-% season, the Cardinal was
still a club program for women's
water polo.
"It was a great opportunity be
cause it was the first year of varsity [at
Stanford]," Tam said. "It felt special.
Even back then, we knew it was going
to be something big. The team just
gets better every year."
And from the outset of her colle
giate career, Tam has been an incred
ible asset to the Cardinal program. In
her freshman year, Tam earned hon
orable mention Ail-American hon
ors as a starter for Stanford.
Not only has Tam contributed her
talent to the powerhouse program,
but she's also made an impact with
her leadership skills.
"Lindsay has determination, em
pathy, loyalty and respect," said Stan
ford head coach John Tanner. "All of
those qualities make her a wonderful
captain. She's a terrific role model."
This is Tarn's third year as a co
captain of the squad, a role she takes
a lot of pride in fulfilling.
"I'm honored by the position,"
Tam said. "Being a captain is being
someone who's there to support your
teammates. [The role of a captain) is
to leave the team with something per

manent, so the team is stronger, even
without you there."
One value Tam has already epito
mized for her team is total commit
ment.
"You can always count on Lind
say to live up to her commitments,"
Tanner said. "When she gives you her
word, you know without a doubt that
she'll fulfill it."
The biggest test of Tarn's determi
nation came at the beginning of last
season. After tearing her ACL the
summer before her junior year, Tam
was unsure whether her play would
ever be the same again. But in spite of
her injury, Tam was always there to
support her team.
"Lindsay's opportunity to con
tribute to the team has been in all
areas of the continuum," Tanner said.
"She's been an Ail-American and a
leading scorer, but she's also seen set
backs. She didn't even get to travel on
our first road trip last year, but she
drove all the way down [to UC-San
Diego] to watch."
Even though Tarn's commitment
to the team never wavered, her re
covery was often slow and frustrating
at points.
"Nobody expects to get injured,"
Tam said. "For a long time I didn't see
a lot of progress. I was inclined to
think I'd never be able to play like be
fore. But now I fell like it's even bet
ter than before."
For Tam, it was more of a mental
struggle than a physical obstacle to
overcome.
"It's hard sitting on the bench for a
quarter and feeling like you're so be
hind," Tam said. "But mentally find
ing out you can get over things like

that gives you a lot of confidence. It
makes it even easier to work on your
skills."
Tarn's mental strength and ability
to pull through rehab stronger than
ever are some of the qualities that
make her an ideal leader.
"In spite of the varied roles she's
played in terms of her contribution in
the water, she's always remained the
same person out of the water," Tan
ner said. "She's got steadiness and
consistency."
And that steadiness and determi
nation to succeed carries over into
Tarn's academic life as well.
An English major with an empha
sis in Creative Writing, Tam has been
honing her skills from a young age. In
fifth grade, her first attempt at cre
ative writing resulted in a 20 page un
published "novel," as she called it.
With the creative impulse that
took root in her youth. Tam has
steadily worked towards her goal of
becoming a published writer. With
Tobias Wolff as her mentor and advi
sor, Tam has been able to challenge
her creative abilities and make some
serious attempts at fiction.
"I've liked writing since I can re
member," Tam said. "When you
write, you write about people and
people fascinate me. It would be
great to be published someday, but 1
write more for myself. It's a challenge
to get better. Writing is a big thing for
me and I really want to keep it in my
life, whatever I'm doing."
If Tam is not writing or playing
polo, she's usually enjoying the out
doors. An avid hiker, she has worked
as a camp counselor in upstate New
York for the past three years and

plans to return again this summer.
"I went to this camp as a camper
and my dad is one of the heads [of the
camp] and my brother is a camper, so
it's kind of a family thing," Tam said.
"I'm [also] outdoor oriented and 1
like being around kids. And the kind
of counselors the camp attracts are
people who are inspired and alive. I
love being around people who have
energy and creativity and that in
cludes my teammates, my suite
mates, and the people at camp."
In addition to being a youth leader
during the summer, Tam is a mentor
for local children as well. This will be
Tarn's second year as a co-chair of the
Youth Olympics, a mentorship pro
gram for East Palo Alto kids put on
by the Stanford Captain's Council.
Children come to the Farm to play a
variety of sports with these mentor
athletes.
"We're teaching them how impor
tant it is to succeed on the field and
off," Tam said. "More than athletics,
we're trying to inspire them to be suc
cessful in life."
For Lindsay Tam, being a success
means more than just playing good
water polo or writing a good story.
"Success is being satisfied with
what you do — not necessarily
happy," Tam said. "It's knowing you
made a difference."
Tarn's attitude towards life and
her dedication to success has made a
lasting impression on those around
her, especially her teammates.
"She puts the same expectations
on herself as she looks for in her
teammates," Tanner said. "That's
something that will continue long
after she leaves.
