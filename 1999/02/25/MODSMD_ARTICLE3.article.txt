# Women's Center hosts anti-abortion speaker
## Gans argues abortion 'dehumanizes' women 
### Murtaza Alimohamed 
"Investigate for yourself. There's more to
this issue and a deeper human face that is
struggling to get its voice heard," was the
parting message given to an audience of
about 15 by Olivia Gans, a pro-life activist
and the director of American Victims of
Abortion in Washington.
Gans spoke yesterday at a panel discus
sion held at the Women's Center, co-spon
sored by Stanford Students for Life and the
Women's Center. Gans also gave a lecture on
to approximately 20 students at Tressider
Tuesday night. On both nights she urged stu
dents to consider the merits of the pro-life
stance.
Gans argued that while women some
times resort to abortion to protect their ca
reers from possible derailment due to child
birth. this notion only reinforces the negativ
ity towards a woman's professional capacity.
"For anyone to say that being pregnant is
a sign of doom and disability — unable to

continue with education and being inactive in
society — is an archaic, Victorian affirmation
of women's weakness and inferiority," she
said.
She also objected to the idea of aborting
due to financial inadequacy, arguing that the
existence of social services such as Mother
Helping Centers should be the community's
solution to this obstacle.
"Why does a woman have to feel that the
only solution she has is to end the baby's
life?" she said. "I object to that."
According to Gans, her organization ad
vocates legislation in Washington that pro
tects women. For instance, AVA is currently
focusing on a bill that entitles women to "in
formed consent" before they decide to have
abortions, including the nature of the proce
dure and its risks.
"When I went through [the process of
abortion], the most reprehensible experience
was not being given an explanation of the

whole process," she said. "My right
to know what happened to my body
was not respected."
According to C Jans, other legisla
tive bills that the organization is ac
tively pursuing include "partial
birth" abortion bans, which would
prevent late-term abortion, as well
as parental involvement laws in case
of pregnancy of minors.
Some students at the meeting,
however, said that legislation
against abortion is not an effective
means of furthering women's rights.
"I disagree that legislating
against abortion and restricting
women's rights to choose is a right
step in women's rights," said sopho
more Antonia Whalen.
Gans, who herself had an abor
tion in 1981, also decried the lack of
adequate research regarding the
physical, psychological and emo

tional travails that accompany the
termination of pregnancy.
"When I was faced with the situ
ation [of getting pregnant and later,
abortion), there was an utter lack of
intimate world experience for
women to draw upon," she recalled.
She remembered going to three
doctors and one Planned Parent
hood office, and in spite of her being
the main reason for the visits, she
complained about being "complete
ly dehumanized and invisible at that
setting."
"The abortionist winked at the
lather and said. "I take care of such
minor problems regularly,' " she
said.
Clans emphasized that, based on
her experience, among women
throughout the United States, as
well as 17 other countries that she
has traveled in, this "dehumaniza
tion" appears to be a trend.
"My experience echoes the expe
riences of hundreds of thousands of
women all over America," she said.

"What I was hearing from Ameri
can women was the voice I was
hearing from European women."
Gans also deplored the lack of
proper safety considerations during
such procedures, as well as sub-par
facilities.
"It is distressing to see that most
states lack proper regulations re
garding abortion facilities," she
said, citing Florida as an example
where, in spite of violations in three
facilities, state administration was
not allowed to initiate investigations
because of prior legislation.
Cians partly blames attempts to
keep abortion legal in the United
States on the problem of "dehu
manization" of women.
"Attempts to normalize the
practice of abortion has meant that
the agenda has run roughshod over
the individuals and the crises they
face," she said.
"You don't have to agree that
what I experienced means that we
need to establish some sort of uni

versal standard. But you have to ac
knowledge me the respect of my
whole experience."
Some students felt Gans ex
pressed her ideas effectively, but
were not necessarily convinced of
her view.
"I didn't agree with a lot of the
views expressed by her," said
sophomore Jill DiGiovanni, who is
the health intern at the Women's
Center. "The speaker was very
strong about her convictions and
passionate about them. While I dis
agree, it wasn't an antagonistic dis
cussion."
Regarding the idea of birth con
trol, Gans explained that AVA
takes no position on the issue.
"[ That] is a matter of personal
choice."
However, she continued to ex
plain that, "preventing fertilization
is one thing, but I do believe that
after fertilization, life sets in, and
abortion construes termination of
this life. We are opposed to that."

struggling to get its voice heard," was the
