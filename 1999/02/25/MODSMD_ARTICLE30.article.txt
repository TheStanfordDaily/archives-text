## EVITA Los Perones en SF 
### 
mploying new costumes and
orchestrations, this 20th anniver
sary production of "Evita" deliv
ers a powerful new rendition of the story of
Eva Per6n, complete with Argentine salsa
and actual footage of the controversial fig
ure.
In a departure from previous "Evita" pro
ductions, the new version was infused with
a more authentic Latin feel. The score was
re-orchestrated to incorporate Buenos Aires
salsa rhythms and, most notably, Argentine
cities are pronounced the way they are
meant to sound (i.e., ar-hen-TEE-nah
instead of ar-)en-TEE-nah).
The show's efforts toward creating a
more authentic Latin feel were taken a bit
far, however, with the inclusion of
Argentine tango. As Eva Duarte and Juan
Per6n flirted with one another in "I'd Be
Surprisingly Good For You," the stamping
feet of the tango dancers only distracted the
audience. Everyone else had cleared the
stage by then; the gratuitous juxtaposition
of these four cast members made one won
der if the tango dancers were hired because
of nepotism.
The three leading roles have been cast
with Latino actors. Natalie Toro plays Eva
Per6n, the strong, persuasive second wife of
Argentine President Juan Per6n. Toro was
the first American to be cast as

Eponine in "Les and

praised run as Grizabella

in "Cats." Her voice was

powerful, but became

shrill when she ven

higher octaves.

Raul Esparza captured ~
the audience soon after enter

ing the stage as Ch£ Guevara, a
Latin American revolutionary theo

rist. His smooth voice and vehement
emotion were the highlights of the pro
duction. He also demonstrated excel

somber tale of
creed and a

ambition.

As Juan Per6n, Raymond Jaramillo
McLeod was the weakest of the three main

ning Jonathon Pryce filled the role in the
1997 film version of "Evita." McLeod's voice
was too guttural, and he sounded more like
a singing jock than a statesman.
In a surprising departure, "Another
Suitcase in Another Hall" was not per
formed by Eva, but by Juan Per6n's discard
ed mistress (Angela Covington). This tweak
in the production, along with other minor
changes to the reprise, led to an overall
harsher portrayal of Eva Per6n. She was
unilaterally greedy and ambitious — gone
was the subtle vulnerability that has
appeared in previous productions.
The production had its rough spots. A
microphone malfunctioned during the bal
cony scene on the Casa Rosada; actors
rubbed on their portable mics a couple of
times at the beginning of the show; and at
one point, someone dropped something
backstage during a moment of dramatic
silence. All of this contributed to the feeling
that one was watching an authentic (albeit,

higher quality) Argentine high school

play rather than a smooth Broadway

production.

Overall, however, the intensity ,

of the show compensated for its ,

failings. The artful use of

an overhead screen

and built-in light

ing, though

not unique

r to this produc
tion, contributed

to an all-around

entertaining

show.
