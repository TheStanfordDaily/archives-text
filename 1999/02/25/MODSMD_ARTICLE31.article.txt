# COLLECTED STORIES
## Where's the line between fact and fiction? 
### 
who has ever taken a creative
f\jr writing class or read a compelling novel
has surely wondered at what point fact
becomes fiction. How much of another person's life
can a writer use as material? This is the central issue
in Donald Margulies' Pulitzer Prize-winning play,
"Collected Stories."
The play traces the friendship between two writ
ers, the renowned Ruth Steiner and her 20-some

thing protlgge Lisa
Morrison. As Ruth
guides Lisa's emerging
writing talent, they
become close friends

despite the decades sep
arating them. One afternoon Ruth divulges details
of an affair she had with the famous poet Delmore
Schwartz when she was Lisa's age.
During the next few years, as Lisa's career soars,
she drifts from her mentor. Eventually, she "bor
rows" details of Ruth's love affair as the starting
point for her own novel about a young writer's affair
with a poet Although Lisa adamantly defends the
work as fiction, the lines between Ruth's own life
and make-believe are too blurred for Ruth's satisfac
tion. Betrayed and embarrassed by the attention to
her own life, Ruth rejects the work and Lisa's
attempts to justify herself.
"Collected Stories" is a cerebral production dri
ven entirely by the ideas it presents and enlarges in
Ruth's New York City apartment. Ruth, played by
Christine McMurdo-Wallis, is the quintessential
passionate, aging teacher who is at once excited for
her young student and envious of the youth she can
no longer claim.
Jennifer Tighe is believable as the youthful Lisa,
a student whose ambition leads her to betray the
one person who believed in her before she was suc
cessful. Although McMurdo-Wallis' performance is
slightly more realistic, even this disparity legitimizes
the action of the play, mirroring the teacher-student
dynamic.
"Collected Stories" is at once witty and bitter,
interlaced with jabs at the literary world, such as:
"Life's too short for the 'New Yorker.' " In exposing
the mentor-prot£g6e relationship, Margulies reveals
the differences between Ruth and Lisa's generations.
Ruth is a child of the '60s, part of a generation of
women who had to fight for their voices to be taken
seriously. Lisa, on the other hand, is the ready recip
ient of this valor, of this easy attitude toward liber
alism. Perhaps like most of us in our 20s, she is
unable to fully comprehend the experiences of her
mentor.
Most satisfying about Margulies' work is that the
writing is almost invisible. The issues and characters
are so real that we are granted the voyeuristic sensa
tion of watching two friends struggling fiercely for
common ground.
"Collected Stories" inspires debate without tak
ing sides or reducing the characters to preachiness.
When is it justifiable to write another person's sto
ries, even in the context of fiction? The audience is
surely left to ponder this question for themselves
and to wonder whether Ruth's early words to Lisa
ring true: that writers are "all rummagers. ...
Rummagers at a tag sale. Picking through the neigh
bors' discards for material, whatever we can get our
hands on. Shamelessly."
