## BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD, INC. 'Office Space' sells big laughs 
### 
ike Judge stays true to his roots in "Office
Space." Much like his TV series, "Beavis and
tSvt/ Butthead," Judge's new film often feels like a
string of vignettes connected by a barely discernible plot
line. That said, "Office Space" makes up for its lack of a
compelling plot by delivering the big laughs.
As you might expect, "Office Space" is a movie about the
modern workplace and its inherently evil nature. Peter
Gibbons, credibly played by Ron Livingston, is a disgrun-

tled computer programmer for the Initech
software company. That stands for "initia
tive" and "technology."
Peter's job basically sucks. He finally
decides he's had enough and fails to show up
for Saturday morning overtime. On Monday,
Peter arrives at work to find the firm infil

trated by the dreaded management consultants. Figuring he
has nothing to lose, Peter uses his interview with "the Bobs"
to air his litany of complaints.
The Bobs decide that Peter's insights into the inner
workings of the company make him a perfect candidate for
a promotion. Unfortunately, they also decide to can Peter's
buddies Samir and Mike. This is where the fun begins, as
the three conspire to rip off Initech for hundreds of thou
sands of dollars.
Oh yeah, did I mention that Jennifer Aniston is in the
movie? She plays Joanna, a waitress at Peter's favorite hang*
out, Chotchkie's. Aniston is ostensibly the leading lady, but
her relationship with Peter is basically an afterthought. You
gotta have the big-name babes to draw the crowds, right?
What really saves "Office Space" from being just another
formulaic comedy is Judge's ability to play off of stereo
types. The movie opens with proto-computer geek Mike
sitting in traffic, getting down to some gangsta rap. As he
mouths lyrics about busting a cap in someone's ass, he
notices a black man selling flowers on the median. Terrified,

he promptly locks the doors and turns down the stereo.
Judge's depiction of Initech is similarly amusing. He cap
tures the absolute misery of an "office party," as well as the
universal loathing for Bill Lumbergh, the smarmy coffee
toting VP who runs the show. Lumbergh tries to motivate
his troops by raising banners that say, "Is This Good For the
Company?" and drawing insipid diagrams about "Planning
to Plan" — of course, to no avail.
Overall, "Office Space" is worth a look, especially if
you're a computer science major planning to join the ranks
of Silicon Valley next year. Presumably, Stanford grads can
avoid the Initechs of the world — although "Office Space"
may make you think twice about postponing that back
packing trip to Europe.
