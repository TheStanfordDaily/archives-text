you build it, they will come." In
/Of) "Field of Dreams," the"it" referred to
tIS a massive ballpark in the backyard of
a farmer. But here, in the truly remarkable "October
Sky," the"it" in question is a rocket. Without any
huge-name stars, this new release has the tenacity to
make you feel and hope. It is American individual
ism at its best when independent-minded Homer

Hickam tries to break free from the chains of coal mining in order to
become a rocket scientist
Subtly played by the virtually unknown Jake Gyllenhaal, Homer is
wide-eyed and full of vigor. He pours his energies into reading aeronau
tical engineering texts and constructing rocket parts. He even delves into
the world of football and coal mining as ways — albeit unsuccessful — to
find his true passion in life. But what he really loves and craves is rocket
science.
Lacking help from his parents, Homer must crawl to the depths of
nerd-ville to learn about propulsion fuels and trajectory equations.
Quentin (Chris Owen, "She's All That") has long been a social outcast, but
his smarts provide the guiding intellectual force behind Homer's efforts.
Along with two friends, Roy Lee (William Lee Scott, "Opposite of Sex")
and O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), the foursome unite to fulfill Homer's new
found passion.
Of course, father John (Chris Cooper, "Lone Star") despises this turn
of events in Homer's life. Cooper brings the parental figure to life, not

merely as a stereotypical, hard-nosed dad but rather as a traditionalist
who only wants the best for his son. The only thing that has driven John's
life is the coal mine. So why shouldn't Homer follow in his sizable foot
steps?
The final element in "Sky" is provided by Laura Dern ("Jurassic Park")
as a supportive teacher. Dern has the duty of making Homer believe he
can succeed. She knows that Homer's real joy in life can only be found on
the rocket launch pad field, so she gently encourages him and his buddies
to enter the state science fair. The winners could potentially garner college
scholarships, which is about the only way out of Coalwood's primitive
borders.
It's not surprising that one of the producers from "Field of Dreams,"
Charles Gordon, collaborated with director Joe Johnston on this endear
ing movie. Johnston has worked previously with rockets (the ridiculous
"Rocketeer") and plenty of special effects (both the "Star Wars" and
"Indiana Jones" trilogies). "October Sky" goes a step further and creates
real, believable characters trying to search for their directions in life, no
matter what the odds.
If Homer really wants to escape the quicksand-like drudgery of his
hometown and make a difference in his life, he will have to put forth extra
effort The path is far from easy, but the real Homer Hickam Jr., alive and
well today, would surely testify that all his hard work was worth the
rewards.
