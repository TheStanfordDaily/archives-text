# COVER STORY

### 
n the early '90s Bratmobile and it's cohorts (including Bikini Kill, Nation of Ulysses, Some
I Velvet Sidewalk and Heavens To Betsy) took the world by storm with their irreverent sounds,
style, charm and politics. The band members and their friends inspired a revolution called "Riot
Grrrl," and — at least temporarily—tore down the walls of mainstream rock music. Bratmobile will be
playing their first show since their "breakup" five years ago this weekend in Oakland and will be touring with
Sleater- Kinney in the Northeast at the end of March. Just like the Eagles said, "We never broke up, we just
took a five-year hiatus!"
This week. Intermission spoke with Bratmobile's singer, Allison Wolfe.
INT: So how did y'all start playingi I hear you guys met in a college dorm'.
AW: Molly and I were neighbors in the dorms at [the] University of Oregon. I
had been listening to all these K [Records] tapes, like Spook and the Zombies,
Courtney Love [a band with Lois Maffeo and Pat Maley, not the lead singer of
Hole], Oklahoma Scramble, Go Team — stuff like that. Molly was really into Public
Enemy. Eugene, Ore., is the kind of place where you totally have to create your own
fun, your own scene, so that's exactly what we did. We somehow knew that there had
to be something better than the music getting shoved down our throats — we had
to create it. We started crashing parties, grabbing the microphones, whatever, writ
ing songs. Then Calvin [Johnson, member of Beat Happening, and co-owner of K
Records, now in Dub Narcotic] heard we were a band and asked us to play our first
show in Olympia [Wash.] with Bikini Kill and Some Velvet Sidewalk on Valentine's
Day, 1991? That's when we realized we really had to get our shit together, be a "real"
band or something. Molly bought a cheap Galaxy 500 so we could get to our show.
Erin was in Bethesda, already playing guitar and into all the K scene stuff, playing
with Lois [Maffeo] sometimes, and Christina Billotte — of Slant 6 fame — I think.
Calvin and Tobi [Vail, of The Frumpies, Bikini Kill, Go Team, Jigsaw fanzine] were
responsible for introducing us all. Christina set up a practice for all of us at the
Embassy in DC, when Molly and I went out to visit, and we wrote a song — "Stab"
— and played it at a [Nation of] Ulysses show at Maxwell's in Hoboken, N.J.
INT: What was it like being in bands and in school at the same timet
AW: It was hard for me to concentrate on school. I probably should have just post
poned doing school and just worked on the band at the time, but Molly and Erin
were also in school, so the band as a unit probably wouldn't have gone full-time any
ways. I liked University of Oregon, but 1 think Evergreen [a Washington State col
lege] was kind of a waste of my time. The early '90s was such an exciting time to be
doing music, especially in the Northwest. I think I sometimes took that for granted.
INT: What do each of you play? Were you always in this configurationt

AW: Molly plays drums, Erin plays guitar, I sing. l know Molly can also play gui
tar, Erin does some mean maraccas, 1 can tune a guitar! Molly and Erin both have
great voices, too. Erin played clarinet in high school, and I played bass clarinet. But
Bratmobile went through various configurations. Originally it was me and Molly, I
mostly sang, and she would switch off between guitar and drums, depending on the
song. I played guitar on one of the songs, "Girl Germs." Then when we went to D.C.,
Erin played guitar, and Molly and Christina Billotte would switch off between gui
tar and drums, so there were always two guitars. And our friend Jen Smith would
play with us too, and sang on a song or two. So that was Bratmobile D.C. But then
sometimes when Molly and I were in Olympia, our friend Michelle Noel would play
with us on bass, and sometimes Tobi and Kathi [Wilcox, also of The Frumpies,
Bikini Kill] would play with us, too. But at some point we realized that it would just
be more solid if it were just the three of us, strip it down, keep it raw, keep it real!
INT: Where do y'all live these days?
AW: I live in Washington, D.C. Erin lives in Bethesda, Md. Molly lives in Oakland,
Calif-
INT: What are some of the new songs you've written, and what are they about?
AW: We've been working on two new songs so far. One's called "Give me back my
Cheap Trick record!" Well, to those who know, it's kinda obvious, but it's about this
ex-boyfriend of mine who I just found out he still has my Cheap Trick record by
reading the song lyrics on his band's record sleeve. It's kinda funny, we keep writing
songs about each other. The other song is called "Flavor of the Month," it's just
about feeling frustrated with my friends and my scene, feeling like I'm surrounded
by lack of ambition, lack of consciousness, lack of stimulation.
INT: So do you love Cheap Trick?
AW: But of course! "Stiff Competition" is my favorite song of theirs, and "He's a
Whore."
INT: Do you have different ideas of what you want to be doing musically now,
compared to five years ago?
AW: I'm not sure. It's hard to see myself how I've changed, how I'm changing. I
have to be around myself every day. I think loss of innocence is my thing! I think
my lyrics have gotten a little better, a little more biting, more punk rock. I just
wanna be more punk rock, yell more, throw shit. I think Molly definitely has differ
ent ideas of where she'd like to go musically now, trying new things, etc. And both
Molly and Erin have become such incredible musicians.
INT: What other projects have you all been working on since Bratmobile stopped
playingf Are you guys playing in any other bands right nowf
AW: Well, I did this horror-core project band with these two guys, Joaquin from
Chicago, and lan from Seattle, called Dig Yr. Grave. That was fun. Molly was in the
PeeChees, and the Frumpies, which she's still doing. Erin and I were in a band called
Cold Cold Hearts with two other ladies, Katherine Brown and Natalie Mencinsky. I
am presently in a band called Deep Lust with two guys, Steve Dore and Tommy Orr.
It's punk rock. And my twin sister has been writing all these incredible songs she
wants me to sing with her, we're gonna call it the Tennessee Twins.
INT: So, you guys like Oasis? What about Blur?I
AW: Molly's the Oasis fan! We're gonna do a Blur vs. Oasis 'zine! Erin and I are
the Blur freaks.
INT: What are your favorite new / current bands?
AW: Hmmm ... I really like Danko Jones from Toronto, Skull Kontrol from D.C.
and Savage Boys and Girls Club. I love The Frumpies! I've always loved Lungfish. I
saw this girl band in New York not long ago called High Teen Boogie, they're rad.
INT: What do you think about the underground music scene today? A lot of your
peers — as far as bands — no longer exist, or have reinvented themselves musical
ly ... what do you think has happened to the sense of community in the music

scene, is it still existent and strongi How is it different
AW: I'm not totally down on the music scene today, but the early '90s seemed
much better. There seemed to be more of a sense of community, things were raw and
D.I.Y. ["Do It Yourself"], everyone seemed to have ideals they wanted to live up to,
people shared and helped each other out more, and the mainstream hadn't swooped
down and co-opted everything yet. It was kinda scary and disgusting to watch cor
porate music come in and gobble up our "scene" or whatever, like in the Northwest
with grunge and riot grrrl, etc. I just think the market got saturated. There's too
much mediocrity right now, it's not very punk, and that's sad. Maybe that's why I'm
staying in the ring, trying to kick some ass in the late '90s! I can't believe the shit peo
ple settle for.
INT: In the early '90s Bratmobile was a really politicized band, partly inten
tional, but also blown out of proportion by the media circus! Do you have any
thoughts on this role of politics and musicianship, looking backf Would you have
done anything differently?
AW: I think we each had different ideas and reasons for being in the band back
then. I don't think we ever had one certain intention, platform, agenda. I think that
everything is political, so our band did have political effects on music, the "scene,"
etc. I've never really been one to do music just for music's sake. To me, the songs and
performance always have some sort of politicized agenda. I think most people try too
hard to "not be political." It's like, what's that supposed to mean?! Looking back,
though, I guess I wish I would've calmed down a little more, not let things like the
media freak me out as much as it did. I wish that all of us in the scene could have put
more energy into supporting each other rather than tearing each other apart.
INT: What are you reading these days?
AW: I've been reading this autobiography by this woman, Anne Moody, who was
a civil rights activist in the '60s, called "Coming of Age in Mississippi." It's insane
when you read the racist climate and conditions in America that she describes and
realize it wasn't that long ago and then wonder, how good are things now?
INT: Are you playing any shows soon?
AW: We're playing our first show together in five years this coming Sunday in
Oakland at this party. Then we have five shows at the end of March with Sleater-
Kinney in the Midwest. W<e have another show in Brooklyn in April.
INT: Anything else you want to sayt
AW: Erin hearts A.K.!!
