# Bratmobile, the Intermission Interview
## 
### Alex Sepiol 
JW: I think it began in a spontaneous way just because we started writing these
songs, and we could sense a change in the mood. I think that was a reaction to the
forceful nature of "Dig Me Out" ... aggressive, like take hold of the listener and
shake them from start to finish. That record was exactly how we felt at the time. We
had just started playing together, and we were really excited with what we could do.
It was an outburst of energy and emotion. I think that with the new record, when
we started writing the songs, they were a lot more introspective, moodier, darker,
still strong I think. But because these songs have these different personalities, we
wanted the recording of those to reflect that and to enhance those personalities.
INT: In terms of the songwriting, how much of a role do you play in thatf
JW: It's a very collabo. stive band. The songs aren't complete or even partially
complete until everyone has sort of contributed. We often write songs in practice
and it's a matter of... OK, here's the beat, then Carrie will play something and
Corin will play something. We all really contribute to the crafting of the songs. Of
course, they write the lyrics and the guitar parts. I feel very integrated into the song
writing.
INT: Do you ever get defensive about being a drummer? Is there like a drum
mer syndrome of being in the back?

JW: No, I love being a drummer. Perfect place for me (laughing). I'm NOT a
drummer that will be ignored. I'm a musical person and I need to be involved in
the making of the music and not just like a time-keeper.
INT: Who are some drummers that have had an influence on your stylei Or
even just that you liked.
JW: I'm a huge Kinks fan. So I thought Nick Avery was the super-cool drummer.
Even though he's kind of rickety at times, he's more rocking at other times. I love
all the classic drummers. I'm really interested in the drum hook, the drummer who
can play a hook like a guitar hook or a vocal hook. It probably gets ignored a lot of
the time. I mean, Charlie Watts is probably one of the best drum-hookers. But I
guess Ringo Starr has been my biggest influence.
INT: Do you ever plan to step out and have a silly song that you singf
JW: In Sleater- Kinney? No, no, no. I don't even want to sing backup; I sing a lot
in Quasi. I just get too sweaty back there. It's kind of nice to concentrate on drum
ming. No silly songs, no.
INT: Did you all ever go back to "Dig Me Out" and with particular songs say,
this is where we want to go? There's a few songs that now sound like they're point
ing in the new direction, like "Dance Song 97."
JW: More in terms of the sound. Not so much in terms of the songs. But we did
go back and listen to "Dig Me Out." You know, we recorded that album really quick
ly, and it's pretty much the same guitar sounds through the whole thing, more of a
reflection of our live set, like we just plugged in and played. In terms of how the gui
tars sound, we did go back and listen to that record. We wanted the next record to
have more complexities in the guitar sound. We wanted some more sonic textures.
We wanted each song to be different. We wanted more of a complex journey for the
listener from start to finish.
INT: Do you think this is a direction the band is going to continue inf
JW: I don't know. We wrote a song yesterday afternoon that was crazy fast. You
just never know. We just make songs depending on how we're feeling that day in
practice. They will reflect like lyrically how those guys are feeling, what's going on
in their lives that day. That's all 1 can really ask for, something honest, something
vital. As long as we can still do that, we'll continue to play.
