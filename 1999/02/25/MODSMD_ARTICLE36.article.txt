# Sleater-Kinney, the Intermission Interview
## 
### Wendy Yao 
( yK/lea ter-Kinney's last album, "Dig Me Out," won raves from critics, captured the attention of indie
fans everywhere and ripped to shreds any idea of separating riot-grrrl from the rest of indie rock.
It was an amazing record, certainly one of the best of 1997, rocking ferociously without sacrificing
any emotional content.
As an encore, SUater-Kinney presents "The Hot Rock" (Kill Rock Stars) for your listening pleasure. More
textured and moody, yet still rocking, it has already won critical accolade. Now on a U.S. tour, Sleater- Kinney
puts its new material to the test of their fan base. They will appear next Wednesday and Thursday at the Great
American Music Hall. Label-mates The Bangs open for them on Wednesday, and they play with Versus on
Thursday.
Last week. Intermission talked to Janet Weiss, Sleater-Kinney's drummer. She joined the band right before
they recorded "Dig Me Out."
INT: Were you in Quasi before you joined Sleater-Kinneyf
JW: Yeah. I've been in Quasi for about five years.
INT: Are there any other bands you're in right now?
JW: Um, no. ... I sometimes play drums with Elliot Smith [formerly on Kill Rock
Stars].
INT: Really? Cool. He's actually playing in San Francisco the day before Sleater-
Kinney is.
JW: (regretfully) Yeah, yeah, I know. It's hard. Well, we're touring the whole world,
and it's hard for us not to get to play with him. Well, anyway. ...
INT: So are you from Olympia? Where are you from originally?
JW: Originally, I'm from Hollywood, Calif. I've never lived in Olympia. Corin
[Tucker] and I live in Portland now, and Carrie [Brownstein] lives in Olympia. We're
a two-city band.
INT: Do you find it hard to get together to rehearse for new material and to tour?
JW: Sometimes it's hard, but Olympia's not that far away. We've been rehearsing a
lot in the last two weeks, and it just takes some scheduling. It's not that hard. It's nice
in a way because it allows us a space away from the band and time to sort of relax
and not be playing and practicing all the time. ... I'm gonna eat some toast while
we're talking.

INT: That's OK. Do you feel that Quasi has gotten neglected since you've joined
Sleater-Kinney?
JW: No, not at all. Quite the opposite. When 1 joined Sleater- Kinney, I was able to
quit my job and play music more full-time, and that's sort of when Quasi become
more of a ... a contender, I guess.
INT: The title of the new record, "The Hot Rock," is said to be a reference to a
Robert Redford flick.
JW: That's true.
INT: That's true. That's not just an urban myth. Is it at all a reference to the
Rolling Stones' "Hot Rocks," or no?
JW: No, not really. We know that that exists.
INT: So it wasn't a conscious nod to them at all.
JW: Well, it's a title that has several meanings. I think we like that. The meanings
work on all kinds of levels, and I think we like that too. Obviously, we can't ignore
that the most popular band in the entire world has a greatest hits record called "Hot
Rocks." We're not trying not to address that.... It has many meanings. And some of
them are silly. Some of them are more complicated.
INT: What are some of the sillier ones?
JW: (laughing) The Rolling Stones! You know, "Hot Rock," like rock 'n' roll.
"That's some hot rock 'n' roll!" It's a funny thing to say. But to take one of the other
meanings, it's more like dealing with a stolen gem, or something real, or genuine. Or
the concept of us maybe getting away with something.
INT: What do you think you're getting away with ?
JW: We're getting away with doing things our way. Making this music that we're
sort of blessed with in a weird way. It's like, "why do we deserve this?" It's all so mag
ical in a way to be able to play the music that you love with the people that you care
about. It's not something that we want to take for granted.
INT: The sound of the new record seems a bit moodier. Is that something the
band set out to do after "Dig Me Out", or did it happen more spontaneously ?
