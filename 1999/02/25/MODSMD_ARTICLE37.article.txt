Going Underground

unk is a single moment. 1977. The year I
(JmlJ was born. It kind of sucks to have been
born after what I consider the terminal
moment in rock. But I appear to be stuck with that
year and my conception of it, however fatalistic such
nostalgia like that may be. Fortunately, rock is like
"Star Wars" — it starts in the middle with A New
Hope.
And this is where postpunk comes in. Or perhaps
more specifically, Rhino Records' recently released
compilation, "The Postpunk Chronicles."
Postpunk? What could a term like that possibly
mean? Well, Rhino apparently has an idea. These
three volumes include a healthy dose of pretty amaz
ing singles, dating from 1976 to 1985, though the
bulk of its contents were originally released from
1979 to 1981. The artists include a wide range of for
merly underground artists, from R.E.M. and Sonic
Youth to Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and the
Smiths, as well as a lot of permanently obscure acts
like The Pop Group, The Chills, Throbbing Gristle
and Green on Red (who? precisely ...).
With such an eclectic collection, what is the crite
ria? Let's start again with punk. I said it was a single
moment, and 1 mean it. Punk happened in England
in 1977, full stop. There were American bands that
easily fit into any definition of punk that predates
that, from the avant-garage Pere Übu to the chain
saw pop of the Ramones. And punk as a style or
genre continues to this day, with bands that contin
ue to inspire an emotional connection with their
audiences and release killer records. But PUNK is
also an aesthetic term, and in this, England's Class of
'77 is undeniably the real and only thing. The Sex
Pistols were a national sensation, to the point of
being debated in newspapers and inspiring reaJ con
troversies, the type that make Marilyn Manson's
"shocking" performances seem tame.
Moreover, punk as a style is the terminal move of
rock, an absolute reduction of rock to pure energy.

With three chords and attitude, four acne-scarred
geeks could form a band and take over the world. Or
at least imagine it. And this is the critical point. Punk
was so brutal, so apocalyptic, that the only thing
rock could do to be truly original and daring after
ward was to re-build. Punk was doomsday, so post
punk is the day after.
From another aspect, I'd like to borrow a line
from Baudelaire about modernism. Rock is always
equal parts eternal and fleeting. Punk collapsed
those terms. "Anarchy in the U.K." was timeless as
soon as it was released.
So postpunk artists were those who tried to do
something new, even after that apocalyptic final
moment. Punk was the Blank Generation, fighting
against boredom with a sneer and a gob of spit.
Postpunk artists were art-damaged geeks who
brought new and old adjectives to rock, like ironic,
dark, clever, gorgeous, abstract, committed. Geeks
formed bands and created records that had that,
"that's so fucking cool and weird" quality that
inspired even more geeks to form bands and copy
them or, better yet, try something new.
But perhaps all of this is pretentious nonsense, a
rock critic's conceit, a nostalgic fantasy. Fair enough.
But I'm so enchanted by this compilation, and
almost all of these songs fit together so well, that I'm
convinced it is not just some rock critic's fantasy.
Let's start with "Left of the Dial," a volume with a
title that is a perfect phrase to describe this music.
The songs on this volume are fucked-up pop songs
that, in a perfect world, would dominate the radio. It
begins, strangely enough, with "Radio Free Europe,"
R.E.M.'s brilliant early single. In this context, the fact
that Rhino has used the Hib Tone version, the song
becomes again a catharsis, a call for the freedom of
the underground. Next is Wire's 1979 single,
"Outdoor Miner," a humming and hauntingly lovely
song that makes no sense. It's fortunate that Wire
was included, for they are one of the bands that
managed to evolve after starting out as pure 1977
punk 'n' riff, hook, chorus, done. Massively influen
tial (Elastica ripped off their "Three Man Rhumba"
and"I am the Fly" to become huge; R.E.M. covered
"Strange" and on and on. ...), they evolved into a
truly experimental art group. Next are Joy Division
and their second incarnation, New Order, the artists
most responsible for bringing moody self-pity to the
dance floor. And God bless them for it.
The rest of this volume includes seminal pop and
rock acts that are all pretty breezy and emotional.
This is gorgeous stuff but always a little strange. "Tell
Me When It's Over" by the Dream Syndicate, for
example, is a lazy slice of psychedelic pop confusion
that resolves its own conflict. "I really don't know, I
really don't know... cuz I don't wanna know." And
every song has its little moments, like the opening of
The Chills' "Pink Frost," when after the opening riff,
everything gets quiet except a scaling echo of guitar,
and my heart skips a bit.
"Scared to Dance" is perhaps the most fitting title,
for this volume is all about fear, tension and a good
groove. It contains dissonant pop twisting between
the downright groovy "(We don't need this) Fascist
Groove Thing" by Heaven 17 and the Killing Joke's
slash-and-burn "Change." Most notably, it also con
tains the epic dub-punk workout "We Are Time" by
the Pop Group. This may well be the strangest thing
I have ever heard; at times the singer drops out,
emerging again so wet he sounds like he is underwa
ter. This volume seems the most consciously post
apocalyptic, with the singing guitars of Ultravox's
"Hiroshima Mon Amour" and the wailing beauty of
OMD's "Enola Gay."
"Going Underground" brings in irony (most
pointed on Gang of Four's "To Hell With Poverty!"),
or at least wistful kiss-offs. It kicks off with
Morrissey crooning to the backdrop of Johnny
Marr's vicious guitar work on the Smiths' "What
Difference Does it Make?" "No more apologies,"

indeed. And The Soft Boys on "I Wanna Destroy
You" create a perfect pacifist anthem, chirping lines
like "When I have destroyed you and come picking at
your bones / And you won't have a single atom left
to call your own." My personal favorite on this vol
ume is Billy Bragg's deceptively simple "A New
England." He sings a perfect folk-pop song while
strumming an electric guitar. Both voice and guitar
have tons of echo, making it seem live. The lyrics are
touching, though darker than they might seem at
first. The first lines are literally deathless: "I was 21
years when I wrote this song / I'm 22 now but I won't
be for long / People ask me, 'When will you grow up
to be a man?' / But all the girls from school are
already pushing prams."
A simple folk-pop song can be postpunk? 1 said it
was deceptively simple. Bragg's song brings to light
perhaps the most salient quality of postpunk, which
is contradiction. Postpunk has never been anything
but a mood, an idea, a bunch of geeks with toys. But
it revels in the contradiction of making pop music
after the Sex Pistols ever so modestly destroyed what
music was supposed to be. And then
