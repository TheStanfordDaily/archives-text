## Keep It Like A Secret 
### 
the opening of Built to Spill's 1997
\\y release "Perfect From Now On," front
man Doug Martsch sings "I'm going to
be perfect from now on / I'm going to be perfect
starting now." The claim may have held true for that
album; "Perfect" was a nearly flawless foray into the
world of the rock concept album, with its epic eight
minute songs overflowing with guitar effects.
However, the band's long anticipated follow up,
"Keep it Like A Secret," doesn't quite continue the
trend. While it's a great — sometimes fantastic —
album, it certainly isn't perfect.
"Keep It Like a Secret" marks a return to the
popcraft of Built to Spill's earlier years. Songs like
"Sidewalk" and "Center of the Universe" recall the
jangly style of the band's 1994 album, "There's
Nothing Wrong with Love," where Martsch displayed
his ability to write three-minute indie-pop gems.
While this new album is filled with upbeat power
pop, there is still heavy evidence of the epic, rich
sound that the band developed on "Perfect From
Now On." There is an added depth, complexity and
guitar noodling which balances out the album's
"poppiness." The opening track, "The Plan," begins
in an anthemic upbeat manner before breaking into
fantastic guitar heroics, layering tracks to dizzying
effects.
Strangely, despite all of the band's changes in
sound, "Keep It Like a Secret" most resembles its
debut, "Ultimate Alternative Wavers." Like "Wavers,"
"Keep It Like a Secret" mixes skewed pop with the
big guitar sounds of classic and prog-rock. The
whistling in the middle of "Broken Chairs" recalls
the odd juxtaposition of sounds of "Wavers," while
the Hendrix-esque intro betrays the band's hard
rock edges.
The band pays homage to these classic rock influ
ences on "You Were Right," a simultaneously funny
and achingly sad track where Martsch quotes classic
rock choruses: "You were right when you said all we
are is dust in the wind / You were right when you
said all we are is bricks in the wall." However, the
humor in these lines is undercut by Martsch's serious
delivery and emotional guitars.
As always, Martsch's guitar work holds the spot
light on "Secret." Wonderful swirling masses of
sound are evoked through multitracking and guitar

effects. "Else," perhaps "Secret's" best track, adds
beautiful slide guitar over a rolling, rhythmic base
that owes much to drummer Scott Plouf. The use of
slide on "Else" and the fantastic "Carry the Zero"
and "Temporarily Blind" creates an almost ethereal
quality that seems to lift the songs skyward with
every note.
Although "Keep it Like a Secret" lacks the consis
tency of "Perfect From Now On," it is, nonetheless, a
truly excellent album that yields more singles and
standout tracks and is more accesssible than
"Perfect." With this new album, Built to Spill's beau
tiful, rocking, psychedelic music may not remain
secret much longer.
