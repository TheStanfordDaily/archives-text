XTprMashback to San Francisco, 1977. Bay Area
punk rock quartet, The Avengers, rocks
Berkeley, led by their passionately ener
getic singer, Penelope Houston. Last month, Big
Takeover Magazine claimed that "the two greatest
U.S. punk rock bands ever walked this earth 22 years
ago," and named The Avengers to one of these
esteemed slots, shoulder to shoulder with The
Weirdos from Los Angeles.
While much of The Avengers' collection has dis
appeared over time, Houston managed to track
down old rehearsal and live recordings through the
Internet and word of mouth. To round them out, she
got together with her old guitarist Greg Ingraham
and re-recorded the tunes "I Want In," "Crazy
Homicide" and "The End of The World" with new
recruits Joel Reader (of The Mr. T Experience) on
bass and Danny Sullivan (of Screeching Weasel).
The result — 47 minutes of 21 pulse-pounding
tracks — is pretty extraordinary. "Died For Your
Sins" delivers an old-fashioned dosage of punk like it
was meant to be heard. All of the tracks are fast and
furious old-school punk rock numbers laced with
anger and urgency.
A good portion of the old live recordings are pret
ty damn grainy, but listeners who dig the low-fideli
ty sound of the "D.I.Y." ("Do It Yourself") punk aes
thetic will love it. The spontaneity and humor which
typify punk shows are an integral part of the record
ings. An audience member yells "Eh, your mother
sucks donkey dick!" at Houston just moments before
the band launches into "The American In Me."
Yet even fans of the new school punk sound can
appreciate The Avengers, as one can Immediately
detect the impact that they and other bands of the
era have had upon today's music scene.
It's amazing how much of Houston and
Ingraham's strength is apparent on the new stuff.

While it doesn't have

exactly the same
wallop, I had no
idea that it was
made 22 years

W later until I'd
' actually read the

liner notes. This
stuff rocks.

If you're into
The

Adolescents, Black Flag before Henry Rollins or late
'70s / early '80s West Coast hardcore in general,
you'll want to check this out. While it's too late to
catch The Avengers in concert, you can see Houston
and Ingraham perform Avengers as The Scavengers
(their current incarnation with Reader and Sullivan)
tomorrow at Berkeley's prototypical all-ages club,
924 Gilman Street
