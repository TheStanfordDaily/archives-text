# Dining workers' meeting delayed
## Bidding for shifts moved to Wednesday 
### Jane Morril Contributing writer 
A meeting between Housing
and Dining Services workers and
their managers to create new work
schedules has been postponed
until next Wednesday, manage
ment announced yesterday.
Workers will bid on shift selec
tions during the meeting, which
was scheduled to occur yesterday.
New schedules for these workers,
which would have gone into effect
on March 15, will also be post
poned for one week and will be im
plemented March 22.
Keith Smith, manager of labor
and employee relations, explained
that the delay was to ensure that
workers had information about the
bidding process and the choices of
schedules available to them.
"There are a lot of workers for
whom English is not a first lan
guage," Smith said. "We want peo
ple to understand any changes."
This meeting is part of a larger
plan to reorganize Dining Services
under the Value Enhancement
Program. The program intends to
reduce costs for students while in
creasing efficiency and quality of
service in campus cafeterias.
Part of the program involves a
rescheduling of workers' hours and
locations. Article IV-A of the
United Stanford Workers' Agree
ment, however, gives workers the
right to review new schedules and

change them if necessary. Union
workers have accused Stanford
management of understating the
scope of changes necessary for im
plementation of the program.
Students have taken a role in
protesting the upcoming changes.
Student unrest resulted in a protest
march last Friday that ended at the
Wilbur administrative module.
"We get the impression that
management may be quite nervous
about what's been going on, espe
cially with the increase in student
involvement," said Ethan Kaplan,
a member of the Student Labor
Action Coalition. "We're hoping
the delay is a sign that manage
ment is evaluating how they're
going to run the negotiations to
better [the conditions]."
"We want a dignified, respectful
dialogue between administrators
and workers," Jill Shenker, a mem
ber of the coalition told The Daily
Monday.
Management has acknowl
edged student unrest but maintains
that there is little they can do to ap
pease students.
"Students are involved because
they care," Smith said. "These con
cerns are legitimate.... One of the
problems, though, is as a matter of
law, the Service Workers Interna
tional Union is the only union
which we can draw workers from. 1
cannot sit in a meeting with stu
dents and negotiate with them
without involving the union."
Smith predicted that future
meetings would run smoothly and
that an agreement would be
reached. "We are working with the
union to consider any proposals
they raise," he said. "1 don't be
lieve there is a problem we cannot
sit down and work out with them."
