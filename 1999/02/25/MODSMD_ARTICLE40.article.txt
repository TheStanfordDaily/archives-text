## The 						Sebadoh 
### 
/ - so nice to see bands mature. While
I Cp nothing can really top the shock and
ZIS delight of the first time you hear a cool
new band, a long relationship with a band can be a
charm in itself. The records sound familiar on first
listen, like the experience of meeting an old friend
for coffee. Sebadoh has been around in some form
or another since 1986 when Lou Barlow, then a
bassist with Dinosaur Jr., started recording songs
with Eric Gaffney. Their new album, "The Sebadoh,"
(Sub-Pop / Sire) features Barlow on guitars, Jason
Loewenstein on bass and Russ Pollard on drums.
Perhaps nothing Sebadoh ever does will compare to
the magic of its early records — strange, distorted,
lovely messes. The idea behind the band has always
been a democratic collision of songwriting styles.
People never seem to like Loewenstein's adolescent
rants, preferring instead Barlow's more melodic and
emotional songs. Though its an understandable
complaint, I've never shared it. With this album, the
polarity works better than ever, with Loewenstein
somewhat calmer than in the past, though maintain
ing the punchy edge that no Sebadoh album should
be without.
The title of this new album says a lot. Adding a
definite article to its name indicates how much more
confident, mature and rocking the band has become.
The production is clearer than in the past, though it
has appropriate fuzz and distortion. "The Sebadoh"
begins with a buzz of feedback, then a flurry of
drums, then finally the whiny stuttering riff of "It's
All You," accompanied by bubbly electronic noises
before kicking into the Wilco-ish tambourine driven
chorus (complete with background whoo-whoo
whoo's). It rocks, but not quite in that psychotic way
that Loewenstein's songs used to.
For the overall sound, that's a good thing, for now
the songs mesh with each other better. Loewenstein
in fact supplies some of the coolest hooks on the
record: the soaring whine of "So Long," the psyche
delic riffing on "Nick of Time," more tambourines
on the scorching "Decide." And he still gets plenty
unhinged on rickety rockers like "Bird in the Hand"
and "Cuban."
For lovely emotional and melodic indie popcraft,
Barlow still remains second to none. "Flame" is the
album's first single, and it is great. It begins with a cor
roded bass and insistent drum riff—unmistakably
similar to the Stone Roses'"! Am the Resurrection" —
before morphing into more new wave territory. It even
has a rowdy coda. At his best, his songs are beautifully
layered and touching, like the folksy "Trees."
Unfortunately, none have the epic quality the band's
songs have occasionally attained in the past, most
notably "Homemade," off of "Bubble and Scrape."
Perhaps maturity isn't the best thing for a rock
band. Still, the pleasures of "The Sebadoh" are com
forting for any weepy and / or adolescent indie kid.
