/" Yy* he weather brightens and sunlight filters
in through the windowscreen; leaning
across the windowsill I breathe in the
untainted scent of ... Love. The latest Mom us
album, "The Little Red Songbook," inspires nothing
of the kind. Nick Currie, the man behind the person,
dons a perfectly manicured wig to present us with
this release, a kitten of an album. The pussy's tail
switches menacingly, however, and a deceptive purr
emanates from the furry bundle just as its claws
extend and latch onto the groin of the music indus
try. After the anguished, howling cries of the injured
suits subside, faintly, faintly, you'll start to discern
the wicked strains of analog baroque.
Wholly captivated with the postmodernist state of
affairs, Currie insists that styles and trends since
about 1970 are purely contextual; he separates expe
rience and action along existentialist terms —
whether or not the resulting kitsch is self-aware.
The style of the latest Momus release is an example
of this recontextualization. Analog baroque — its
exact definition ever fluctuating — entails both phi
losophy and instance; the idea of ironic artistic
expression coupled with the (reworked) sounds and
concepts of 17th-century baroque artistry.
True to its style, the"The Little Red Songbook" is
a raging collection of sordid tales and crass imagery
selected from Currie's collection of old e-mails. Set
to elaborately layered synthesized music (courtesy a
Roland VS-880 HDR and able hands), the entire lis
tening experience initially leaves one with the nausea
of having spent an indiscernible amount of time in a
surrealist maze (read: Tressider LaIR). Stepping
along its treacherous paths you're bombarded with
the sounds of harpsichords, kazoos and sinister sex.
