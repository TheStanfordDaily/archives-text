## The 						Little Red Songbook

/" Yy* he weather brightens and sunlight filters
in through the windowscreen; leaning
across the windowsill I breathe in the
untainted scent of ... Love. The latest Mom us
album, "The Little Red Songbook," inspires nothing
of the kind. Nick Currie, the man behind the person,
dons a perfectly manicured wig to present us with
this release, a kitten of an album. The pussy's tail
switches menacingly, however, and a deceptive purr
emanates from the furry bundle just as its claws
extend and latch onto the groin of the music indus
try. After the anguished, howling cries of the injured
suits subside, faintly, faintly, you'll start to discern
the wicked strains of analog baroque.
Wholly captivated with the postmodernist state of
affairs, Currie insists that styles and trends since
about 1970 are purely contextual; he separates expe
rience and action along existentialist terms —
whether or not the resulting kitsch is self-aware.
The style of the latest Momus release is an example
of this recontextualization. Analog baroque — its
exact definition ever fluctuating — entails both phi
losophy and instance; the idea of ironic artistic
expression coupled with the (reworked) sounds and
concepts of 17th-century baroque artistry.
True to its style, the"The Little Red Songbook" is
a raging collection of sordid tales and crass imagery
selected from Currie's collection of old e-mails. Set
to elaborately layered synthesized music (courtesy a
Roland VS-880 HDR and able hands), the entire lis
tening experience initially leaves one with the nausea
of having spent an indiscernible amount of time in a
surrealist maze (read: Tressider LaIR). Stepping
along its treacherous paths you're bombarded with
the sounds of harpsichords, kazoos and sinister sex.

The album begins calmly enough, however, with "Old Friend,
New Flame." There isn't much witchery to this first track; the
music is quirky, but unoffensive, and it's easy to miss the lyric
where Momus croons out "B-L-O-W (space) M-E," especially if
the listener cannot spell. Which brings up an important point —
advanced appreciation of the record requires a certain intellectu
alism, an education in the ways of musk, history, politics, art and
literature, but most of all, a sleek long grey coat by Corame Des
Garcons and a wry wit. This is immediately obvious on the second
track, "MC Escher." Momus raps the intro — "MC Escher / the
impossible rapper / ain't no-body / does it better / under pres
sure."
Along with the wordplay, the record is Uttered with weighty
phrases and commentary straining against— or rather, along
with — its airy musical style. The song titles themselves suggest
the range of topics, from the time of city-states in Italy ("Lucretia
Borgia"), to the philosophies of Proust ("How to Spot an Invert").
But we are still invited to snicker diabolically (and rather mind
lessly) at the similes presented in "Coming In A Girl's Mouth," or
the description of failed sexual exploits in "TVagedy and Farce:"
"Either I was too big or she was too small / But there was no way
on earth we would ever ball."
The frankness of the lyrics and the bold musical choices can be
shocking, but, stealing Currie's powdering supplies, Fll chalk up
any dismay as a reflection of the listener's sadly unexercised and
underexploited psyche.
Listen to "The Little Red Songbook." If you get dizzy, just lie
down and give it another go in the morning.
