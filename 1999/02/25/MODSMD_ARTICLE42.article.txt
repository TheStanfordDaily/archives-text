Writer-director Gaspar Noe's tech
nique is certainly inventive; most notably,
he employs lightning-quick pans accom
panied by the sound of something like a
shot. It's an interesting formal technique,
and breaks up the scenes of stark realism
with a real jolt. Further, it works within
the context of the film, foreshadowing the
butcher's growing obsession with his gun.
Such technique seems empty, though,
as Noe's careful dissection of the butcher
seems more like an exercise in social
analysis than art. He puts so much energy
into making things difficult for the audi
ence that nothing lasting emerges from
his scathing study of the butcher's char
acter. "I Stand Alone" is probably only for
connoisseurs of the disturbing.
