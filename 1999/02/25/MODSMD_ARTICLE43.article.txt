# A ROSE IS A ROSE IS A PSYCHO
## 'Jawbreaker' breaks the badness barrler 
### 
7awbreaker" doesn't sound so bad in theory: it's a dark comedy that's sup
posed to poke fun at the post-"Scream" horror movie craze. Rose
McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart and Marcie Fox star as high school beauties
who kill the fourth member of their clique in a birthday prank gone horribly awry.
The poor girl dies by choking on a jawbreaker, which, like her friends, looks sweet on
the outside but gets sour as you work, you* way in*,
The problem is that "Jawbreaker* Mis prey to most of the same pitfalls as the bad

teen flicks that it attempts to mock. On the surface it's nothing but a
bunch of dolled-up actresses with little talent and weak lines. Their
situations are too ridiculous to be given meaning and too morbid to
be funny, which leaves very little to entertain the audience.
Eventually the movie just turn® into a ttarae-callmg bitchfest.
Courtney (McGowan), the leader of the group, decides they should
leave their friend in her bed and make h look like she was raped and
murdered. Julie (Gayheart) decides that she won't have any part in
this plan, but she can't go to the police for fear that Courtney will kill

her, too. Instead, Julie does the safe thing and battles it out with Courtney at the
senior prom.
If my plot summary makes as little sense to you as it did to just keep the fol
lowing in mind: this movie includes Marilyn Manson as a featured actor. You can't
really expect much.
The highlight of "Jawbreaker" is the solid performance by McGowan. As the anti-
Jennifer Love Hewitt of our times, McGowan delivers a powerful blend of bitchiness
and ditziness. The viewer never questions her complete lack of morals.
Another standout, though not in a good way, is Fern Mayo (Judy Greer), who has
to be the most eerie character I've seen in years. Some evil casting director managed
to find a girl thinner than Ally Mcßeal and make her look even more horrible
through the use of a black wig and a retainer. Courtney manages to transform Fern
into one of her beauty groupies, but she still looks freakish.
The rest of the cast is simply pathetic. Gayheart and Fox can't do much except look
anorexic and wear ultra-tight outfits. This is all too bad, because the direction was
actually impressive. "Jawbreaker" has some cool dream sequences and a good car
toonish feel. Writer / director Darren Stein might someday produce a hit. As for this
movie, don't bother wasting your three bucks at the video store.
