x"T) Ys- ith such a painful time of the quarter
upon us, Miss Sass thought you might
v like to hear from a woman who turns
pain into pleasure professionally. Mistress Ariachtte,
27, has been a dominatrix for three years, after cotn»
pleting both an undergraduate education at Harvard
and a graduate one at Stanford. In a phone interview,
she was cordial enough to share with us the 'ttt* and
outs of business class bondage.
Dialogue with a Dominatrix
RS: How does an Ivy League grad like yourself
get started down this carreer patht
MA: I had some friends that went to Bondage-A'
GoGo (a club in San Francisco), and 1 went there
with them. Upstairs, people were being whipped,
and everyone was dressed Up. I had heard about
sadomasochism, but that was the fittt time I saw all
the culture that surrounded that scene. Then I start
ed dating one of the people in that group, and he
helped me get started.
RS: Is there a special license you need to be a
dominatrix, or could 112 go out on the street corner
and charge people $50 to slap them around a bit?
MA: There is no license, but I would recommend
talking to someone who does it or reading a few
books. "S&M 101 * is a great primer for sadism and
masochism, and"The Topping Book" is a fun, short
read that will getfOtt into the head space Of what it's
like to be a dom, People have a conception about it
that's much different than it actually is. It doesn't
involve hurting people against their will — you just
have to be really bitchy. You're role playing and
you've already both agreed on what they want to
have done.
RS: You've taken some classes in the city on var
ious things. What have you studied?
MA: oh, flogging (beating a person with a cat of
nine tails), spanking and blood play (ceremonial
cutting with scalpels). I've taken rope classes, too,
where you learn how to place rope* and tie people
up. You have to watch for chafing when running a
rope across someone** skin.
RS: With all this talk of torture devices, a begin*
ner can easily get overwhelmed. What kinds of tools
would you suggest for the novice?
MA: Start out Just by making the bottom (the
submissive or receiving partner) feel helpiess.You
can do a lot just by tying him or her up, «o get some
rope or better, silk scarves. If you've got four scam*
and know how to tie a square knot, you're set A
blindfold helps.too, and a few sensation toys like a
feather, a piece of velvet or leather Beyond that, a lot
of people enjoy a flogger (that's the cat of nine tails
again), which looks really dangerous and doesn't
hurt much.
RS: Over three years, you've got to have
ammassed a pretty nice collection of toys* What
should we be putting on the Christmas list foraftw
years down the road?
MA: My newest toy is called a Violet Wand, which
is actually a Tesla coil that generates static electricity.
When you turn it on, it glows violet, and you can
safely shock people with it. And it has an attachment
that you can wear to make the electricity come out
of your fingers, lips, or whatever, to shock people. 1
also have a set of sharp, steel nails th*t fit over my
fingertips (similar but more appealing than Freddy

Krueger). And I have a paddle, the kind that frater
nities supposedly use. That really packs a wallop.
RSc Assuming you don't advertise in the Stanford
Guide to the Good Life, how do you get customers?
MAi I advertise in papers like The San Francisco
and on the Web. And in places like San
Francisco, there are a lot of people into it, so word of
mouth works well. Then we'll do a screening, by
gsjone or in person, so 1 know that the person gets
what is going on and doesn't just want to be beat up
unta he Or she gets angry.
Rsh Describe a typical session for us.
MAi The first thing I <to when I meet the bottom
is discus* what he or she wants done. I find it helps
to have a paper checklist to go though and say, "Have
you done this and would you like it?" We would also
decide on a safe word, which is a word the bottom
uses when yotfre doing something they don't like.
Since this is rote playing, a lot of times the bottom
will want to protest with *no* or "stop" when he
doesn't really want you to. A good system is red-yel
low-green, where red means "stop now," yellow
means "riot so much* and green means "go for it."
Then you start the scene. As the top (the domina
trix), you have to get the bottom into his role. A real
ly popular way to do that is to put a leather or metal
collar on him or her, which signifies that he or she
belongs to you. Some doms have the bottom kiss all
the tools shell use, and some make him kneel and
kiss their boots* And sometimes doms give the bot
tom orders, like fetching underwear with his teeth.
There is always a warm-up period like this, without
hard pain or intense humiliation. Then it's on to the
heavier stuff.
R& What it the strangest thing anyone has asked
you to dot
MA: A man asked me to dress him in diapers, feed
him with a baby bottle and let him go to the bath
room in the diapers. And he wanted me to take pic
tures of it. My personal fetish is blood play, which
falls into the category of"edge play," things that most
people in the community won't do. I guess that
would seem weird to people.
RS: Does whipping people about ever get mun
danet
MAj For Some people, being # dominatrix is their
full-time job. Though they have a lot of free time, I
like my real job so I'm a dominatrix only part-time.
I'd get bored doing it all the time On the up side,
dominating someone reminds me of a ritual or
dance. You get a sense of raised energy in any suc
cessful scene and you get a little bit of a high from
that.
