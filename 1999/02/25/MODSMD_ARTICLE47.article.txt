For our second review, we decided to look for a restaurant
you could go to with a date. We found that and more in Vida, a
French bistro. This restaurant is sure to become a favorite
among the Stanford community. Located on the always pleasant
Santa Cruz Avenue, Vida may be hard to find from the outside,
but once inside a patron feels like family.
On the cover of the dinner menu, there is a small black
and white photo of a young couple, who are in fact the
owner's parents. This is just one example of the personal feel
that one cannot help but sense while dining at Vida. The
motto of the restaurant is written on the inside of every
menu: "In everyday French life, it is the Bistro that is woven
into the daily pattern of meals and celebrations. The Bistro
is that little neighborhood restaurant where they know who

you arc, greet you warmly
and serve you satisfying
foods that change with the
seasons and define regional
homey French cuisine." This
credo is reflected through the
warm, embracing smiles of
the owner, Ali, and his entire
staff.

Open seven days a week for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
Vida appeals to a wide range of clientele. While eating a deli
cious traditional French meal, one cannot help but notice
how Ali recognizes his regular customers by name and treats
them like old friends. This friendly relationship, as well as
Ali's pride in his restaurant, carries over to all contributing
staff members, from the decorator to the chef.
In a further attempt to foster a feeling of community, Ali
plans to begin an afternoon tea. The idea behind this inex
pensive treat is to have customers relax in an informal set
ting on a consistent basis.
The dinner menu is composed of a variety of traditional
French foods including escargot, onion soup, lapin (rabbit)
and lamb. Adrien began his meal with escargot and a salad
containing spinach and Gorgonzoia cheese. Both were
tremendously delicious. The Gorgonzoia cheese brought
out the flavor of the spinach and the garlic butter sauce of
the escargot was equally rich in flavor.
David's first course was French onion soup — with a
twist. Or should we say "without a twist," as there was no
baked cheese on top of the bowl. Do not be fooled into
thinking that the lack of cheese took away from the overall
taste of the onion soup. Rather, it accentuated the sweetness
of the caramelized onions.
For his main course, Adrien reverted to a childhood
favorite, French beef stew. "Just like mamma used to make it
in the old country," said a smiling French man. (That's
Adrien by the way.) The meat was tender enough to be cut
with only a fork. Though Adrien ordered the wrong lamb
dish (in "French") for David, David had no complaints. The
mashed potatoes were creamy yet light; the vegetables were
firm, and the lamb was u oh-la-la"
We finished our meal with a delicious profitterol The vanilla
ice cream center was melted just enough to wet down the bread
pastry. The combination of terrific food and friendly service at
Vida made us excited to become regular customers.
