## Justices reject stay of execution 
### 
: FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) —
The U.S. Supreme Court over
turned a lower court yesterday and
cleared the way for the execution
o4 a German citizen who had
picked the gas chamber over lethal
injection.
> The federal appeals court had
ruled earlier in the day that the use
of cyanide gas was cruel and
uiusual punishment, just as Karl
LiGrand had calculated when he
cfiose the gas chamber.
* The state had appealed the rul
iijg. to the nation's high court.
£ LaGrand, 35, had been sched
uled to die yesterday afternoon for
fatally stabbing a bank manager
daring a botched robbery in 1982.
I'he execution in the gas chamber
w£s rescheduled for early yester
day evening.
I His brother, Walter, 37, is set to
in the gas chamber next week
fifr the same crime.
The brothers' request for death
by cyanide, a method far more
painful than injection, was a calcu
lated move designed to keep them
from becoming the first German
citizens to be executed in the Unit
ed States since World War 11.
. Attorneys for the LaGrands,

who have been on death row since
1984, gambled — successfully —
that an appeals court would buy
their argument that gas is cruel and
unusual punishment. A three
judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled unani
mously in LaGrand's favor.
But the Supreme Court lifted
the stay late yesterday afternoon.
Justice John Paul Stevens dis
sented, contending that the ques
tions raised merited more consid
eration. Among them was whether
gas is cruel and unusual and
whether inmates who chose gas
waive their right to appeal the
method's constitutionality.
The brothers' case has drawn
widespread attention in Germany,
which does not have the death
penalty.
On Tuesday, a state clemency
board rejected impassioned pleas
from a German delegation that
included Germany's ambassador
to the United States and a member
of Parliament.
German officials complained
that they did not learn of the
brothers' case until 1992, eight
years after they were condemned
to die.
