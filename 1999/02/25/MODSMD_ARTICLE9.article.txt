# House speaker leaves door open for breaking Clinton limits
## GOP may exceed spending caps 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The new House
speaker signaled yesterday that Republicans
might exceed spending limits enacted two years
ago with President Clinton, placing the GOP in
the politically ticklish position of evading stric
tures aimed at shrinking government.
"I'm not saying we're going to bust them or not
bust them," Speaker Dennis Hasten. R-111., told
reporters.
Some top Republican aides went further, say
ing that in private consultations, the House (iOP
seemed to be moving toward surpassing the
spending limits for fiscal 2(XK) by billions of dol
lars. The aides said no decision has been made.
In addition. House Appropriations Committee
Chairman Bill Young. R-Fla.. has told GOP lead
ers the limits will probably have to be exceeded to
increase defense and other Republican priorities
and to ensure that spending bills will pass the
House later this year.
The budget Clinton sent Congress this month
claimed to obey the limits lor fiscal 2IXX). which
begins Oct. I. But Republicans have accused him
of breaking those caps by paying for extra expen
ditures with higher tobacco taxes, user fees and
other savings.
The spending issue is among several in which
Clinton's budget attempts to corner Republicans
as Congress begins crafting a 2(MK) budget. I le has
proposed using hundreds of billions of dollars in
projected budget surpluses to shore up Social
Security and Medicare, two widely supported pro
grams, daring them to use some of that money for

tax cuts the (i( )P wants.
"I le lias a habit of tning to put us in a box on
every issue." said Rep. Saxb\ Chainbliss, R-Cia.. a
senior member of the I louse Budget Committee.
"We've just got to work through it."
For years. Republicans have made reducing
the si/.e of government a philosophical tenet. I hey
won billions in cuts after taking control of
Congress in 1995. but spending has since crept
upward. Last fall, they acceded to Clinton's
demands lor extra spending and added some
increases of their own to produce a session-ending
measure that exceeded 1999 budget limits b\ $?.(•
billion.
I his year, many Republicans are concerned
that staving within the limits for .2000 would entail
cutting popular programs and perhaps a risky
budget fight with ( linton. In addition, both parties
want to boost the Pentagon's budget, making it
even hardei to stay within spending limits.
"The world changes every day," said Rep.
Jerry Lewis. R-Calif.. chairman of the I louse
Appropriations Committee's subcommittee that
oversees military spending. "Wo can't pretend
we're operating in a rigid forum."
The IW7 budget-balancing pact enacted by
( linton and the (i< )P-controlled C 'ongress would
limit discretionary spending in 2000 In $\-.6 hi I
lion, or less than one third of next year's $1.77 tril
lion budget. Discretionary spending covers all
defense ami domestic programs, excluding bene
fits such as Social Security and Medicare, plus
interest on the national debt.

That budget deal, designed l<» balance the bud
get by 2002. squeezed tighter and lighter on
spending with each passing year Both sides eon
ceded at the time that it would be tough to obey
its requirements.
Budget analysts say that 1999 spending is so
high that ii would take $10 billion in cuts just to
stay within that 2000 cap. And that excludes any
increases in spending for defense, education and
some other programs favored by main members
of both parties.
The move toward increasing the limits is far
from unanimous among Republicans.
"I'm in favor of keeping the caps," said Rep.
Ray La Hood, R 111. "I think that's the one thing
our party does stand for."
But many other Republic ins believe an early
decision to exceed the limits would be a bow to
the inev it able. I hey say the high spending level set
by last tail's budget bill made it virtually impossi
ble to stay within the limits set for 2000.
The\ also say surpassing the limits now would
inflict minimal political damage on the party and
avoid an autumn spending showdown with Clin
ton like last year's. I heir capitulation to many ol
Clinton's spending demands angered many con -
servatives and hurt the COP in last November's
\oting, many Republicans say.
Rep. John Kasich, R-Oliio, chairman of the
House Budget Committee, plans to propose a
2000 budget on March 17. Asked if a decision on
exceeding the limits had been reached. ('hambliss
said, "We haven't solved that question yet."
