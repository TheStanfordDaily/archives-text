# SLAC Nobel laureate Kendall dies
## Nat'l Geographic scuba dive ends tragically in Fla. 
### Juliana Liu 
Henry Kendall, a winner of the
Nohel Prize in physics for his work at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center and an avid environmental
ist, died Feb. 15. He was 72,
Kendall died while scuba diving
with the National Geographic Soci
ety at Florida's Wakulla Springs
State Park.
According to Capt. Gene Mc-
Carthy of the Wakulla County sher
iffs department. Kendall was taking
underwater photographs when fel
low divers found him lying uncon
scious in shallow water.
Kendall shared the 1990 Nobel

Prize with SLAC Prof. Richard Tay
lor and Jerome Friedman of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy. They were the first to observe
traces of quarks, sub-atomic particles
that form the basis of 99 percent of all
matter.
At Stanford from 1956 to 1961,
Kendall worked under the late
Robert Hofstadter, a physics profes
sor who won the Nobel Prize in 1961.
The principle facility used in
Kendall's research was a 300-foot
linear electron accelerator that was
the precursor to the more advanced
machine at SLAC today. Friedman,
Kendall and Taylor collaborated on
making a series of measurements on
deep inelastic electron scattering.
In addition to his research and
teaching. Kendall was a pioneer of
the environmental and disarmament
movement among scientists.
"Kendall was a symbol of vitali
ty," said Wolfgang Panofsky, former

director and emeritus professor at
SLAC. "He was a strong advocate
for arms control and a critic of some
governmental policies. We were
good friends; this is a terrible
shock."
In 1969, Kendall was a founding
member, and chairman since 1974, of
the Union of Concerned Scientists, a
public interest group that advocates
control of'dangerous technologies.
"It is hard to conclude that scien
tists are in the main responsible for
the damage and risks that are now so
apparent in such areas as environ
mental matters and nuclear arma
ments," he wrote in an autobiogra
phy in 1990. "Yet it seems clear that
without scientists' participation in
the public debates, the chances of
great injury to all humanity are much
enhanced."
In 1992, Kendall wrote and spear
headed the World Scientists' Warn
ing to Humanity, in which about

1,7(X) leading scientists appealed for
an end to the destruction of the
Earth's natural resources.
"Human beings and the natural
world are on a collision course," he
wrote in the document. "If not
checked, many of our current prac
tices put at serious risk the future
that we wish for human society and
may so alter the living world that it
will unable to sustain life in the man
ner that we know."
According to Taylor, Kendall's
love of the environment led him to
activities such as mountaineering,
surfing, photography and scuba div
ing. He made several expeditions to
the Andes, the Himalayas and the
Arctic.
Kendall earned a doctorate in nu
clear and atomic physics from M IT in
1954. From 1961. he served as Strat
ton Professor of Physics at MIT,
where he conducted research in
high-energy physics.
