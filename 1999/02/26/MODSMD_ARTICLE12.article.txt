## Tech job fair scheduled for Saturday 
### Vlada Teper 
Seventy of the most promising
and exciting high-tech start-ups in
the Silicon Valley will come to
Stanford Saturday for the annual
Start-up Job Fair.
The event will take place at the
Stanford Faculty Club between 10
a.m. and 3 p.m.
Katy Salakshahi, 1997-98 vice
president of the fair's sponsor, the
Business Association of Stanford
Engineering Students, said the idea
evolved naturally.
"The idea seemed awesome
from the start," said Othman Lara
ki. director of this year's job fair.
"In other fairs it is hard to differen
tiate between smaller companies
and larger ones. And if there is a
company like IBM next to one
without the same name-recogni
tion, IBM will be the one the stu
dent approaches,"
Interning or working at a start
up has its definite advantages, ac
cording to Steve Oskoui, marketing
director for the job fair.
"You'll probably learn more in a
small start-up. You jump into
things immediately, you're sup
posed to be involved from day
one," he said.
Laraki said students in start-ups
also experience the true definition

of teamwork firsthand.
"Teamwork is much more in
tense at a small start-up as com
pared to a larger company. The
close interaction with other em
ployees is the ideal environment for
teamwork," Laraki said.
"It can be very rewarding if you
are really seeking to be a part of
something. In a start-up you have
the opportunity to be at the core of
something great," he said.
The companies also look for
ward to meeting Stanford students.
"Many start-ups have actually
been started by Stanford students,"
Salakshahi said. "The feedback
from last year's participating com
panies have been extremely posi
tive."
Reza Malekzadeh, director of
product marketing at VMware, one
of the participating start-ups this
year, said, "There are lots of bril
liant and talented people down at
Stanford, and we are interested in
such students. We are looking for
interns as well as employees."
Salakshahi and Vice President
Anand Ramachandran pulled off
last year's job fair with 45 partic
ipating start-ups almost single
handedly. This year saw a team of
six engaged in pulling together a list
of companies, contacting individu
als and creating a job fair web site.
