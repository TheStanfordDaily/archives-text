## Avalanche toll rises 
### 
LANDECK, Austria (AP) —
The smile of a resuscitated 4-year
old boy — given up for dead when
rescuers found him under a mas
sive snowslide — brought hope
and joy to this snow-deluged valley
yesterday, even as the death toll
from two avalanches rose to 33.
In the western Austrian village
of Galtuer. where at least 28 people
were killed, scores of rescuers used
long metal probes to search for at
least three people still believed
buried beneath tons of snow.
Videotapes brought back by
rescue teams showed cars crushed
by walls of snow or hurled like toys

by the force of Tuesday's
avalanche.
Roads into the mountainous
area remained blocked yesterday,
but maintenance crews worked
steadily, hoping to clear them by
Friday afternoon.
Dozens of helicopters ferried
food and supplies into the stricken
area and brought out tourists.
Choppers from the German army
and police, Switzerland and U.S.
army bases in Germany reinforced
pilots from the Austrian army.
The Galtuer avalanche is the
worst to hit central Europe this
winter.
