# Jury sentences Texas racist to death
## 
### 
JASPER. Texas (AP) — Jurors
decided yesterday that John
William King should be executed
for dragging a black man to his
death behind a pickup truck, reject
ing tearful pleas from the white
racist's sickly father to spare his life.
He will become the only white
on Texas' death row condemned for
killing a black person.
The 11 white jurors and their
elected black foreman took just
under three hours to render the
decision, about the same time as
they took to find King guilty.
Jurors convicted the 24-year-old
King of capital murder Tuesday in
the death of James Byrd Jr. last

June.
Renee Mullins, Byrd's daughter,
said later that she was "very satis
fied" with the decision. Nephew
Darrell Verrett held up his fingers
in the peace sign and said. "Every
thing's OK."
As King was led from the court
house, spectators outside taunted
him. yelling, "Bye!" When asked if
he had anything to say to the Byrd
family, he responded with an
obscenity.
Prosecutors asked for the maxi
mum punishment, saying King
would be a menace even behind
bars.
"By giving Mr. King a life sen

tence, you're giving him at least 40
years to catch a black guard, a black
nurse, a black doctor, a Jewish
guard, a Jewish nurse, a Jewish doc
tor, or anybody else," prosecutor
Pat Hardy told the jury. "You're
giving him a chance to catch any
body ... who doesn't believe in his
satanic, racist views."
In deciding the sentence, jurors
had to decide whether the murder
was intentional, whether King was a
continuing threat to society and if
any mitigating factor in King's back
ground merited the lesser punish
ment of life in prison. They
answered yes to the first two ques
tions; no to the third.

Nationally, eight whites have
been executed for killing blacks
since the resumption of the death
penalty more than two decades ago.
Conversely, 124 blacks have been
put to death for killing whites,
according to the Death Penalty
Information Center in Washington.
Byrd, 49, died after he was
picked up while walking home from
a party. After a scuffle, he was
pulled nearly three miles behind a
pickup truck, chained by his ankles.
A pathologist testified Byrd was
alive until his head and right arm
were severed from his torso, which
was dumped across from a black
cemetery northeast of Jasper.
