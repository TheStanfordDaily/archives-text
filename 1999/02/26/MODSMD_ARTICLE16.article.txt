## Editorial Welcome, parents 
### 
Many exciting events
will show you what
your kids are doing

IT'S THAT TIME of the year
again.
Dirty clothes are hidden in the
backs of closets, your children are
looking forward to tree meals off
campus and red banners and newly
planted flowers adorn the campus in
anticipation of your arrival.
The University rolls out the red
carpet for you today, allowing you to
see firsthand what college life is like
for your children.
You will have plenty to see and do
around campus throughout the week
end.
Of course, the complete Stanford
experience cannot be condensed into
a few days, but the time will be
enough for you to get a feel for cam
pus life.
In addition to spending time catch
ing up with your children, you can
attend "Back to School" lectures,
athletic events and a conversation
with University President Gerhard
Casper.
You can visit the recently remod
eled Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center
for the Visual Arts, see the view from
the top of Hoover Tower and take a
tour of the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center.
We think you will see the unparal
leled learning opportunities and

resources available to your children
at this institution.
Your lectures will be given by
renowned scholars, respected for
both their teaching abilities and their
contributions to their fields. You will
be able to sit in on classes with a
recent Pulitzer Prize winner, a former
U.S. secretary of defense and the
inventor of the birth control pill and
marvel that your children have access
to such well-respected academics.
In addition, information
sessions — including workshops on
pursuing creative learning paths,
studying abroad and using resources
available for career development —
will exhibit the multitude of
resources available to your children
outside of the classroom.
The weekend is also an important
one for Stanford athletics. The men's
and women's basketball teams have
key games, while the women's swim
team and the men's wrestling team
compete at Pacific 10 Conference
playoffs.
You can catch the electricity on
campus as students take pride in the
school's athletic prowess.
Though Parents' Weekend is not
the only time during which Stanford
you are welcome on campus, it is a
unique weekend with special pro
grams and events that can provide
insight into campus life.
But to ensure that your weekend is
truly an enjoyable experience,
remember not to look in the back of
your child's closet.
