What's it like to bomb your chemistry
midterm? The blues know. What's it like to
bomb your chemistry midterm, then cruise
by your girlfriend's room for post-exam heal
ing, only to see your chemistry professor step
out of her room wearing nothing but a
towel? 8.8. King could tell you about it. The
blues understand the pain of loss in all its
permutations.
Now, what's it like to receive, in just one
day of commuting through White Plaza, 25
automated inquiries into the quality of your
winter break?
The blues have no idea.
What's it like to have so many acquain
tances whose names you can't remember
that you have actually uttered the sentence,
"So man, where are you living this year?"
Can the blues make you feel better about
residential social encounters so scripted that
nobody involved would pass the Turing test?
Do the blues have any understanding of
what it's like to have a pleasant time catching
up with a kindly acquaintance over coffee on
Monday, then see her Tuesday and have
nothing to say but. "It was great catching up
with you on Monday"?
Do the blues understand how it feels to
then spot that woman in the Bookstore on

Wednesday and deliberately avoid her by
leaving the store, in order to spare both par
ties lull frontal exposure to a profound inter
personal horror: that you have little in com
mon, you will never be close and your life
courses will quickly part, never to meet
again?
The blues are speechless.
For the chemistry exam, you've got the
blues to pull you through. Hut for the soul
crushing loneliness of seeing people you've
met divert their eyes so that you won't have
to ask each other, "So what classes are taking
this quarter?" you've got nothing but Ben
and Jerry's and "Seinfeld" re-runs.
Beneath the eyes of a blind, merciless
God there can be no exodus without a bold
new art, one which can articulate, offer com
fort for and ultimately end the hideously
bleak and repetitive nature of exchanges
with campus acquaintances. Behold this new
art: "the puces."
"The puces," the cultural object named
lor the tight band of hues surrounding pur
plish brown, articulate what the blues can
not. As a mood: "No, I'm not feeling blue.
Today I answered 13 questions regarding the
status of my participation on the field hock
ey team. I'm feeling puce." As a term differ
ent from but just as useful as "sketchy": "See
that guy over there wearing the cargo pants
and flannel shirt, holding the red plastic cup?
He had the kindness to ask me the oh-so-fas
cinating question, Men, How is it living in
Theta?!' He's so pucyAs an affliction:
"Cut it out, you're giving me the puces!"
Blues singers play guitar and belt out
deep, honest lamentations on top of a groove

laid down by a sweet rhythm section.
Puces singers play asteroid-sized electric
organs mounted on 12,000-grand-piano
capacity Caterpillar mining vehicles and belt
out polemical anti-conformity rhetoric in
German, on top of a baroque groove laid
down by an army of fugueing, glam-rock gui
tarists.
When a puces singer encounters an
acquaintance, he might begin with any one of
the following:
"Girl, since you are Being's poem just
begun, will you have dinner with me tonight
in my yellow Caterpillar mining vehicle
which, incidentally, can carry four blue
whales?"
"Does essence precede existence, or does
existence precede essence?"
"Hey, do you remember why Green's
theorem was useful?"
"1 had arguably the worst date of all time
yesterday."
"Seeing you makes me forget that it's a
school day."
"Let's watch a movie in Meyer tonight!"
"You just wouldn't believe how the Bali
nese conceptualize the self."
"How do you feel about the groove laid
down by my army of glam-rock guitarists?
Oh. you think we should return to our blue
grass roots?"
"Let's play home run derby in the parking
lot after dinner."

Alden Clarke is a senior majoring in physics
and symbolic systems. He's sorry to every
body he's totally puced out lately.
