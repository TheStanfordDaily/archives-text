Resident supports housing
I was sorry that in Betty Kaplan's
thoughtful letter (The Daily, Feb. 24) she
used the term "residents" as it that group
was monolithic. Not all of us who live on
campus speak with the same voice. Despite
the vociferous objections that have been
raised, I know that several of my neighbors
feel, as I do, that the University's tentative
designs for 36 new housing units are entire
ly acceptable.
Kaplan is right in stating the need for
"open discourse, trust and mutual under
standing" between residents and the admin
istration. Such a relationship was not always
honored in the past, as I can testify after 35
years of living on campus. Hut the present
situation differs markedly from earlier ones.
First, the new housing will be scattered
over three sites. It is hardly comparable to
Cowell Cluster, which backs onto faculty
residences.
Second, it seems to me there has been
ample opportunity for residents to review
the plans and express their objections and
suggestions.
Finally, the additional housing is a small
but helpful attempt to cope with a shortage
of affordable housing in this area that has
reached crisis levels. As a major employer,
Stanford has an obligation to increase the
availability of such housing.
Kaplan's suggestion that residents take
part in long-range planning for the residen
tial area sounds reasonable but could have
serious drawbacks. Most residents are
absorbed in activities and might be unwill
ing to attend frequent meetings and bone
up on technical details. Consequently, a few

interested activists might mistakenly come
to be regarded as representing the commu
nity as a whole.
What is disturbing about the current
protest against the additional housing is that
it comes from members of a community that
enjoys rare privileges. Those of us who live
on campus enjoy a quiet, safe and very
beautiful environment. We are spared time
consuming commutes in heavy traffic. Our
children attend better than average schools.
Just across from the campus there is plenty
of open space for hiking and bird watching.
Above all. we are close to one of the best
libraries in the country, an outstanding art
museum and a concert hall in which top
flight artists appear.
Stanford has been jokingly referred to as
"paradise." but when it comes to campus
living, this is not far from the truth. It seems
ungenerous to call for a delay or raise a fuss
over providing for a few more families to
join us.

Daily mistaken on ASS (J split
As student representatives on the ASSU,
we often hear the complaint that, despite all
the fanfare, student government just doesn't
do much for anybody. If anybody wonders
why, last Tuesday's Daily editorial offers
direct evidence of the political pressures
that cause this.
On Tuesday night, the ASSU Senate
voted to place a constitutional amendment
on the ballot that would allow the Graduate

Student Council to be the ASSU's primary
voice for graduate students. For years, the
ASSU Senate has consistently failed to
address the needs and interests of the grad
uate population. Graduate senators have
simply been mired in bureaucracy.
Over the past three years, the council has
been able to run laps around the ASSU
graduate senators.
As a result of council initiatives, the Uni
versity has committed to building 480 des
perately needed on-campus spaces for grad
uate students over the next two years. The
University has also leased 250 off-campus
spaces to graduate students at below-mar
ket rates.
In addition, a council initiative helped
neutralize nascent community opposition to
the proposed new graduate construction by
giving members of the community a chance
to meet and interact with graduate students
in dire need of affordable housing. Also,
over 600 graduate students with nowhere
else to go were given a nice Thanksgiving
dinner.
Finally, a dozen graduate student groups
have applied for or received funding, who
otherwise would not have received it due to
an ASSU Program Board application pro
cedure that assumes everyone operates on
the undergraduate-focused, three-quarter
academic cycle.
The key to this success has been the
council's flexible and open structure, which
has allowed busy graduate students to vol
unteer on their own terms rather than con
form to the demands of the ASSU Senate's
hundreds of pages of bylaws.
When the editors suggest that "perhaps a
body with operating procedures similar to

the ASSIJ Senate ... would suffice," they
completely ignore the chief reason for reor
ganizing the ASSU legislative branch.
The Daily wants us to preserve provi
sions that would require a year of planning,
thousands of dollars of expense and the
attention of thousands of undergraduates
before the GSC could change its meeting
schedule or the attendance requirements of
standing committees. It objects to the tem
porary appointment of members to the
GSC when many members currently win
their seats with less than 10 write-in votes.
The Daily also failed to notice that the
proposal retains exactly the same "checks
and balances" as the existing structure, from
an ASSU presidential veto to internal and
external methods for removing members. In
addition, as the GSC decision-making pro
cedures ensure complete transparency and
instant accountability, they provide a level
of protection in excess of the current
requirements. Only the paralyzing bureau
cracy is removed.
We hope that The Daily and the student
population as a whole will take the time to
understand our proposal, its context and its
rationale more thoroughly between now
and the election in April.
