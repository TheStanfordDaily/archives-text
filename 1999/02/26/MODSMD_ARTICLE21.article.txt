# Bringing it all back home

						'60s will never pass away

PEACE, FLOWERS. FREEDOM,
happiness. These were the defining
words of a decade. The Age of Aquar
ius came to an end nearly 30 years ago, and
many say the spirit of love, protest and caring
about one's fellow (wo)man died with the
dropping of the hall in Times Square in 1970.
Vegan cookouts and Phish concerts may try
to recapture some of that atmosphere, but
they always fall short.
Others say that there's nothing to
protest — the economy's stronger than ever,
and we're all doing just great. Let's look at
our world and see if that self-satisfied belief is
actually true.
First off, there is no draft, so any war or
pre-Ramadan strike our government autho
rizes is justifiable and right.
Second, affirmative action is disappearing
everywhere, so women and minorities must
have equal access and opportunity in all hir
ing and admissions decisions.
Third, welfare programs have been
slashed, so there can't be any more poor peo
ple.
Wow, the world does sound great —
what's a self-respecting leftist radical to do?

Well, one could try to provoke a brutal
attack from Stanford security officers while
shouting, " The whole world is watching! The
whole world is watching!" into imaginary
television news cameras, but that's some
thing I'd only recommend for kicks, not for
fomenting revolution.
But guess what? There is something left
to do, an issue that won't go away, and you
don't have to be a member of the Commu
nist Party or travel to Burma to get involved.
You don't even have to leave this beautiful
campus.
See, our University is being bad. Very
bad. Stanford has a $4.5 billion endowment,
much of which is currently invested in corpo
rations that are responsible for environmen
tal destruction and human rights abuses
around the world. Bad Stanford.
Don't worry, the endowment isn't funded
by tuition payments, so you aren't directly
responsible for the effects of the University's
investments — your parents' money is being
spent on much more important things, such
as taking care of one of those $30,(XX) trees
on Palm Drive. But you are a student at this
school, so you are an invisible participant in

every decision that Stanford makes.
I first got involved in this issue about a
year ago, when 1 started learning about a par
ticular Stanford-funded corporation named
Freeport McMoßan. Freeport, through its
subsidiary in Indonesia, is destroying the rain
forest and cooperating with a corrupt
Indonesian military that arbitrarily arrests
and tortures native inhabitants on the island
of Irian Jaya. Part of Stanford's endowment
is invested in Freeport. Bad Stanford.
Every year Freeport holds its sharehold
ers meeting at the corporation's headquar
ters in New Orleans, and last spring I trav
eled there with another student to represent
Students for Environmental Action at Stan
ford. The meeting happened to coincide with
Jazzfest, which I certainly didn't mind. It's
pretty difficult to top New Orleans in pure
entertainment value — the town, as one local
informed me, is all about "food, booze,
women and music," and females seem to
love flashing their chests all up and down
Bourbon Street. Who couldn't love a place
like that?
But partying was not our reason for going
to New Orleans. We demonstrated outside

of Freeport's headquarters. We made pre
sentations about Stanford's investment to
other activists. We went to meetings where
activists faced off with Freeport executives in
intense debates. We were involved; every
thing was fast-paced, exciting, confrontation
al and real. We were doing something.
I came back from New Orleans with a
realization — I'm not much of a protester. I
don't like yelling and screaming at people; 1
usually prefer making snide remarks.
But you don't have to march or stop eat
ing to make a difference. If you want to,
that's great — but there are so many other
ways to get involved, such as talking to the
University administration or educating other
students.
I arrived back here at Stanford happy
with that realization. I was no radical, but I
was sure as hell going to do some good.
Important people in the University hier
archy have addressed the issue of socially
responsible investment before, claiming that
by setting up guidelines or restrictions on
investment, Stanford would be making polit
ical statements, which are inappropriate for a
major university to make.

If you agree with this position or just don't
care at all about any of this, God bless you
and good luck on your Econ. 51 test.
But if your interest has been aroused, if
you're starting to get pissed off. don't just sit
there. On Tuesday, a speaker named Kevin
Danaher from the organization Global
Exchange is coming to talk about university
investment and other aspects of globalization
at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
Go check it out — maybe you'll learn
something, or maybe you'll want to get
involved. For those revolutionaries out there
who don't feel this issue is radical enough,
who are saying "This is lame. Let's just blow
something up," be patient. You've got to
start out small.
As the Boss would say, "You can't start a
fire without a spark." Spark up, my friends,
and let's bring those 1960s back. See you on
Tuesday.

Mark Silver is a sophomore who is currently
undeclared. Ile'd like to suggest that if you're
going to San Francisco, he sure to wear some
flowers in your hair.
