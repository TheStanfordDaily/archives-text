## Card beats ASU, one win from title

Stanford mens basketball head
coach Mike Montgomery became
the all-time-winningest coach in
the program's history last night —
in biblical fashion.
In a great twist of irony, a fan in
the student section unveiled a sign
that read "Monty 2:58."

It was perfect. But the parallel
went way beyond the sign, deep
into the story of the game itself.
The players were all too famil
iar. Goliath — the sixth-ranked
Cardinal — was facing off against
an overmatched Arizona State
team, which perfectly fit the part of
David.
The underdog Sun Devils did
pack a powerful punch, and slung a
powerful stone (or rock, as a bas
ketball is popularly called) at the

Cardinal in the form of a buzzer
beating Mike Batiste three-pointer
to send last night's game into over
time.
But unlike the tale of the Old
Testament, this was the Gospel ac
cording to Mike. Goliath was mere
ly stunned — not out cold.
Stanford (23-5, 13-2 Pacific 10
Conference) came up swinging in
the extra period, rolling to a 77-67
victory and escaping a serious scare
from ASU (14-13,6-9).
"Well, [that was] another great
Pac-1() basketball game," Mont
gomery said. "Everybody in this
league is so tough. Arizona State
has three guys who can score the
ball and they had good games."
The Cardinal got some help
from across the Bay, making the
win even bigger. Arizona, which
came into tonight just a game back
of Stanford and looking forward to
a showdown tomorrow at Maples,
lost to California and handed the
Cardinal a two-game lead in the
conference.
A win over the Wildcats tomor
row night would clinch outright a
first-ever Pac-10 title for Stanford.
That is a "huge game Saturday
and I hope we can come out and
play our best basketball," Mont


Josh Haner — Daily
Senior point guard Arthur Lee finished with 18 points behind 11 -
of-12 shooting from the free-throw line to help lead the Cardinal
to an 87-77 overtime victory against Arizona State.
gomery said.
Stanford continued its season
long trend of falling behind early and
trailed by as many as 13 in the lirst
half.
Arizona State senior forward
Bobby Lazor, last year's Pac-1 0 New
comer of the Year, torched the Car
dinal for 12 points on 5-of-7 shooting
to lead the Sun Devils in the first half.
"We got off to a slow start shoot
ing the ball." Montgomery said.
"Again, I thought Arizona State was
the aggressor and they got after us
pretty well defensively. We didn't
shoot the ball very well, we got a little
impatient and we dug ourselves a
hole. Fortunately, we got back to two
at the half and I think that was huge."
But immediately after a 16 foot

jumper from Eddie House — the
Pac-lO's second-leading scorer—put
the Sun Devils up 32-19 with 3 min
utes. 39 seconds remaining in the first
half, Stanford went on an 11-0 run to
end the period and pull within two.
After a running layin by Sun Devil
point guard Alton Mason to open the
second half. Stanford went on anoth
er run. outscoring ASU 8-0 to take a
38-34 lead.
From that point. Stanford quietly
stretched its lead and found itself
ahead 49-40 with 13:29 remaining.
It looked as if this game was com
ing straight from Stanford's cookie
cutter — a slow start salvaged by a
strong second half, defined by a cal
culated. meticulous resurgence.
But David — Arizona State —
had more ammo in its sling shot.
House and Batiste, another Sun
Devil among the Pac-10's top five
scorers, pioneered an ASU run and
in the blink of an eye. the Cardinal

had surrendered the lead. 54-53 with
7:11 to play.
It was a seesaw battle from there,
featuring five lead changes in the next
six and a half minutes.
The last of those changes occurred
when Peter Sauer converted a pair of
free throws to put Stanford up 64-63.
Four freebies from Arthur Lee
and a streaking House layup later,
the Cardinal clung to a 68-65 lead
with 15 ticks left on the scoreboard.
Then the real drama began.
House passed up an open three and
rotated the ball into the far corner to
Kenny Crandall. Crandall had a look
at the basket but swung the ball to the
top of the key to Batiste.
With time expiring. Batiste fired a
rainbow over the arms of Tim Young
that landed on the front iron.
Then it bounced to the back of the
rim and through the bottom of the
net, shocking the Stanford fans and
evoking a serious case of deja vu.

In the Cardinal's last home game.
USC center Brian Scalabrine hit a
miracle three in overtime that was es
sentially the Cardinal killer.
"I had a major flashback tight
then," Madsen said."
But the eventual outcome was
quite different, and Stanford pow
ered its way to the 10-point win.
After the game. Montgomery ac
knowledged that the record was im
portant to him. but — true to form —
was quick to shift the focus back to his
team and its chance to win a Pac-10
crown tomorrow night.
"Anytime you do something for
the first time, it's important," Mont
gomery said. "Arizona has been a
dominant factor in this league for
years. It's something you strive for at
the beginning. I'm certainly aware
that the NCAA tournament has
taken some luster off of that. But to
have a chance at a conference cham
pionship is very important to us."
