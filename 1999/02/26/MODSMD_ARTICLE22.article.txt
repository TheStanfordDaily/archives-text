## Card beats ASU, one win from title

Stanford mens basketball head
coach Mike Montgomery became
the all-time-winningest coach in
the program's history last night —
in biblical fashion.
In a great twist of irony, a fan in
the student section unveiled a sign
that read "Monty 2:58."

It was perfect. But the parallel
went way beyond the sign, deep
into the story of the game itself.
The players were all too famil
iar. Goliath — the sixth-ranked
Cardinal — was facing off against
an overmatched Arizona State
team, which perfectly fit the part of
David.
The underdog Sun Devils did
pack a powerful punch, and slung a
powerful stone (or rock, as a bas
ketball is popularly called) at the

Cardinal in the form of a buzzer
beating Mike Batiste three-pointer
to send last night's game into over
time.
But unlike the tale of the Old
Testament, this was the Gospel ac
cording to Mike. Goliath was mere
ly stunned — not out cold.
Stanford (23-5, 13-2 Pacific 10
Conference) came up swinging in
the extra period, rolling to a 77-67
victory and escaping a serious scare
from ASU (14-13,6-9).
"Well, [that was] another great
Pac-1() basketball game," Mont
gomery said. "Everybody in this
league is so tough. Arizona State
has three guys who can score the
ball and they had good games."
The Cardinal got some help
from across the Bay, making the
win even bigger. Arizona, which
came into tonight just a game back
of Stanford and looking forward to
a showdown tomorrow at Maples,
lost to California and handed the
Cardinal a two-game lead in the
conference.
A win over the Wildcats tomor
row night would clinch outright a
first-ever Pac-10 title for Stanford.
That is a "huge game Saturday
and I hope we can come out and
play our best basketball," Mont

Senior point guard Arthur Lee finished with 18 points behind 11 -
of-12 shooting from the free-throw line to help lead the Cardinal
to an 87-77 overtime victory against Arizona State.
