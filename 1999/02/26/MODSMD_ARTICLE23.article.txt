# Monty's winning ways
## Head coach breaks Howie Dallmar's 24-year-old victory mark 
### Brian Eule Senior staff writer 
The fan waving the large "Monty
2:58" sign may have wanted to un
leash it a bit earlier in last night's
game, but he was patient, and it be
came fully visible with less than a
minute remaining in overtime.
It seemed only appropriate that
the fan waited.
Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery has waited as well.
As the Cardinal fought past Ari
zona State, defeating the Sun Dev
ils 87-77 in overtime, Montgomery
earned his 258 th career victory and
surpassed Howard Dallmar as the
Cardinal's all-time winningest
men's basketball coach.
And now, in his 13th season at
Stanford, Montgomery is going
after one more thing that Dallmar
brought to the Farm.
A conference title.
Dallmar coached at Stanford for
21 years, a longer period than any
other Cardinal men's basketball
coach. Leading the team from
1954-1975, it was Dallmar's 1962-
63 season which gave Stanford its
most recent conference title — long
before the days of the Pacific 10
Conference.
Now, with California's 89-76 vic
tory over Arizona last night, a Stan
ford win against the defending con
ference champion Wildcats at
Maples Pavilion tomorrow night
would clinch the Cardinal's first
ever Pac-10 title — with two games
remaining.
"To be able to clinch the Pac-10
with two games left, you couldn't

ask for anything more," said Stan
ford forward Mark Madsen. "We
feel like we deserved it."
Montgomery has certainly been
waiting for this opportunity as well.
"Anytime you haven't done
something [at a school], I think it's
important," Montgomery said. "1
think it's something you strive for
every time you start a season.
That's why you play league games."
Point guard Arthur Lee will also
get the chance to match up against
Arizona's Jason Terry once again

after a devastating last-second loss
last month.
Only this time, a title will be on
the line.
"We would love to win it," Lee
said. "It means a great deal. We feel
the ball's in our court."
And while the intensity of these
two games may make Montgomery
downplay his personal accomplish
ment last, it certainly isn't going un
noticed.
"We're all very proud of him,"
Madsen said. "He mean's a lot to us

and to this university."
Despite not making any kind of
big deal about the event, Mont
gomery wouldn't hide the fact that
he was pleased.
"It's big," Montgomery said. "I
feel real good to be able to be
somewhere long enough" to do
that.
"Hopefully there will be a lot
more."
It's been a nice, gradual process
