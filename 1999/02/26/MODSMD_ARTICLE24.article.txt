# Anything but a Sauer experience
## With one game at Maples left, the Card's workman has left his mark 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Two Arizona fans stood outside the McKale center, smoking
their cigarettes during halftime of last month's Cardinal-Wild-

cat basketball game.
"I can't stand Stanford," one exclaimed to his friend.
"And 1 can't stand Pete Sauer. Sauer's an asshole."

When asked how he came to his colorful con
clusion, a strange look — a mix that showed he

was both angered that such an inquiry was
made and confused at trying to find the an-

swer — crossed his face.
"What do you mean? He just is! Look
at him!"
It's not exactly easy to figure out why

Some might say it is his defense: When was

basket? When was the last time that opponent

Perhaps it's Salter's overall game: He has
a pest-like ability to be everywhere, to' set

sink that shot.
I t could be his demeanor: He's quiet-

ly aggressive, never showing much emotion when sinking a shot or smoth
ering an opponent that's trying to get an easy lay-in.
Or maybe it's just the Kramer thing: The nose and mop of hair have al
lowed people to liken him to the strangest character from television's "Se
infeld."

But like him or hate him, people have to admit that Peter Sauer gets the
job done. With just one home game left in his Stanford career. Sauer has
helped take the Cardinal to new heights. And with a win tomorrow
against the Pac-10's reigning kings, the Arizona Wildcats, the Cardinal
would lock up its first conference title since its Athletic Association of
Western Universities crown in 1962-63.

"1 guess in some ways it makes me happy that people get
frustrated bv me," he said. "I'm not an All-American and I'm
not going to dazzle you with dunks and by averaging 25 points
a game. But if I can contribute the little things like score

when it's there and get a rebound when it's there, then I
can help our team win, and that's really the bottom line.
"That's how I approach the game and if that's seen as
being arrogant by the fans or by anyone else than so be it.
because that's the only end result we're looking for."

That workman-like approach to basketball also leads to an ag
gressive defense and sortie Hard fouls that fans from other schools
around the conference have taken exception to.
Fye been taught ever since I was a little kid was to not
give anybody an easy basket," Sauer said. "I'm not tryio|% inten
tionally foul guys or hurt guys, but we have the mentality where

if anyone comes into the lane we're going to contest it. so
5 everybody's kind of thinking twice about going into the lane.

If they've have that in the back of
their mind then it's to our advan
tage."
And Sauer takes whatever ad
vantage he can get. Exploiting the
subtle aspects of a game allows him
to "do the little things," a phrase
that seems synonymous with his
name.
Alter all. on a team which lacks
a true superstar, Sauer still man
ages to blend into the background.
Arthur Lee is the explosive floor
leader, Kris Weems is the deadly
sharpshooter, Tim Young is the in
side presence and Mark Madsen is,
well. Mad Dog. Sauer has no on
court personality. The rest of the
starting lineup fits together like
pu/zle pieces to form the Cardi
nal's game strategy, and Sauer slips
into the grooves to hold it all to
gether.
"As far as the basketball side
goes, [my role is] just todo the little
things." Sauer said. "Try to re
bound and make the shots if they're
there. It's just the complete game of

passing, rebounding and defense,
because I'm not going to be the one
who's looked at to get 20 points and
10 rebounds every game, but no
one on our team really is and that's
kind of what makes us effective."
It's a work ethic that fits in per
fectly with head coach Mike Mont
gomery's strategy. Selling team
achievements over personal glory
is never an easy thing to do with any
group of athletes in any sport, and
while all of Stanford's players have
readily bought into Montgomery's
plan — with great success — the
type of performance Sauer turns in
night in and night out is the epito
me of that system.
It's also the way he takes basket
ball off the court.
"You hope the freshmen and
sophomores see the juniors and se
niors and the things they've done
and how hard they work and they
take some of those lessons," he
said. "You hope you can teach
them lessons not only on the bas
ketball court ... but things off the
court like working hard in the
weight room and always condition
ing hard."
But Sauer adds something away

from the game. Two years ago no
one would argue thai Brevin
Knight was the team's leader, both
in action and vocally.
Lee fought for an entire year to
show the nation that he could take
the Cardinal's reins come game
time.
But off-court leadership seems
to have fallen in Sauer's lap. He's
the closest thing the Stanford men's
basketball has to a voice.
"We don't have a real vocal
team, but as the captain for the last
two years I've tried to take that role
a little bit," Sauer said.
The results are there, and
they're not just in the win column
and the history books, but also in
the attitude that the team has
taken.
Sauer might be the poster boy
for the way Mike Montgomery runs
the Cardinal team, and that's no
shabby cause to champion, consid
ering last year's Final Four appear
ance and the constant top-10 rank
ing the Cardinal has held all season
long.
It might even be worth being the
most hated man in the Pac-10, even
if no one can explain why.
