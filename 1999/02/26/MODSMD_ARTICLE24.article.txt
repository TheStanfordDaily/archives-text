# Anything but a Sauer experience
## With one game at Maples left, the Card's workman has left his mark 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Two Arizona fans stood outside the McKale center, smoking
their cigarettes during halftime of last month's Cardinal-Wild-

cat basketball game.
"I can't stand Stanford," one exclaimed to his friend.
"And 1 can't stand Pete Sauer. Sauer's an asshole."

When asked how he came to his colorful con
clusion, a strange look — a mix that showed he

was both angered that such an inquiry was
made and confused at trying to find the an-

swer — crossed his face.
"What do you mean? He just is! Look
at him!"
It's not exactly easy to figure out why

the No. 6 Cardinal's senior small forward is *
such a reviled target throughout the Pacific 10
( onierence, but everyone just knows that he
1N
Some might say it is his defense: When was
the last time an opponent went for a breakaway
layup with Sauer trailing and actually got the
basket? When was the last time that opponent

Perhaps it's Salter's overall game: He has
a pest-like ability to be everywhere, to' set
that pick, get that rebound, make that pass, >

sink that shot.
I t could be his demeanor: He's quiet-

ly aggressive, never showing much emotion when sinking a shot or smoth
ering an opponent that's trying to get an easy lay-in.
Or maybe it's just the Kramer thing: The nose and mop of hair have al
lowed people to liken him to the strangest character from television's "Se
infeld."

But like him or hate him, people have to admit that Peter Sauer gets the
job done. With just one home game left in his Stanford career. Sauer has
helped take the Cardinal to new heights. And with a win tomorrow
against the Pac-10's reigning kings, the Arizona Wildcats, the Cardinal
would lock up its first conference title since its Athletic Association of
Western Universities crown in 1962-63.

"1 guess in some ways it makes me happy that people get
frustrated bv me," he said. "I'm not an All-American and I'm
not going to dazzle you with dunks and by averaging 25 points
a game. But if I can contribute the little things like score

when it's there and get a rebound when it's there, then I
can help our team win, and that's really the bottom line.
"That's how I approach the game and if that's seen as
being arrogant by the fans or by anyone else than so be it.
because that's the only end result we're looking for."

That workman-like approach to basketball also leads to an ag
gressive defense and sortie Hard fouls that fans from other schools
around the conference have taken exception to.
Fye been taught ever since I was a little kid was to not
give anybody an easy basket," Sauer said. "I'm not tryio|% inten
tionally foul guys or hurt guys, but we have the mentality where

if anyone comes into the lane we're going to contest it. so
5 everybody's kind of thinking twice about going into the lane.
