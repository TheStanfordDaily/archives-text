The Cardinal (16-10, 12-3 Pacific 10 Conference)
made this one look easy, taking the fire out of the Sun
Devils (11-13, 5-10) early on, and never letting them
come back, eventually winning 81-61.

WOMEN'S BASTKETBALL

■ Yesterday: Stanford (16-10, 11-4 Pacific 10 Conference)
81, Arizona State (11-13,5-10) 61.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford at Arizona (15-9,10-5), 2:(X) p.m.
Stanford was in the zone all night, going 56 percent
from the field, their best effort this year. The Cardinal
also had its third-highest block total in history, denying
the Sun Devils nine times, a figure they had reached
once earlier this year, also against Arizona State.
Freshman forward Bethany Donaphin got it started
for Stanford, taking junior point guard Milena Flores'
assist and laying it in for the first of her team-leading 14
points. The Cardinal began the game with a 10-2 run, as
Flores found ways of dismantling the fullcourt press of
the Sun Devils. Flores ended the game with 10 assists
and 12 points to complete her sixth double-double of

the season.
"I think that during the week, we do practice against
the press," Flores said. "We have guys come in and
other experienced players, and so we are used to the
pressure. When we come here we are ready for that."
Flores was not only dishing it out to her post players,
hut she often took the ball coast-to-coast, turning the
ASU press into Swiss cheese. The Cardinal led the Sun
Devils by 15 with six minutes to go in the half, but a

three-pointer at the buzzer brought
ASU to within nine, 37-28.
"There were just holes that I
saw, and I made my way through
them very systematically," Flores
said. "People were getting spaced
out. and that worked really well for
us."
The Cardinal didn't let the

last-second trey worry it. Instead it
came out even stronger in the second half, taking the
ball inside, going outside for three and grabbing boards
with authority.
Donaphin led the team with 11 rebounds, complet
ing her own double-double, while adding four blocks.

had gone up for a three, when

running after it and picking it up for
a layup.
The blocked three "was cool,"
Donaphin said. "It surprised me.
and once I hit the ball I was like. 'Oh
my God,' and then I decided to go
for the layup."
That play typified the second
half. With just under 10 minutes to
go Stanford was up 65-43.
The rest of the game was spent
trading baskets, with little of note
except the continued vision of Flo
res and the dominance inside by the
Cardinal.
Stanford outrebounded the Sun

Devils 45-36, but more importantly
it neutralized ASU forward There
sa Jantzen.
She posted a career-high 28
points in her last game against Ore
gon State, but against the rough
play of the Cardinal. Jantzen could
only manage two points.
Returning to Stanford's line up
for her second game since injury
was sophomore forward Sarah
Dimson, and she began to play to
her old form.
In 23 minutes, she scored seven
points, but her drives down the lane
were a display of quick footwork
and swift ball-handling that had
been lacking against Washington
State.
The win keeps alive the Cardi
nal's hope of a Pac-10 champi
onship and gives Stanford the confi
dence it will need going into Tuscon
to wrestle with the Arizona Wild
cats (15-9, 10-5) tomorrow.
