# Lacrosse faces Bears at Cal
## 
### Jeff Cooper Editorial staff 
Revenge is a dish best served
cold. The Stanford women's lacrosse
team knows that lesson well.
After a third-place finish in the
Western Women's Lacrosse League
two years ago. in which it suffered
two losses to eventual champion
UC-Davis, the Cardinal came back
last year to knock off the Aggies in
the regular season and again in the
WWLL finals and claim the champi
onship title.
After the 10-month offseason.
UC-Davis (1-0) returns to Stanford
(0-1) tomorrow to try and repeat his
tory — but with the roles reversed.
Stanford's home opener, at New
Maloney Field tomorrow at 1 p.m.,
should prove an excellent test of the
team's ability to integrate its large
freshman class into the returning
championship squad, and to make a
statement to the rest of the WWLL

that Stanford is ready to defend its
erown.
The team is also looking to
bounce back from a heartbreaking
season-opening loss against Califor
nia (1-0) last Sunday, in which the
Bears scored three times in the last 1
minute, 30 seconds to secure a come
back victory.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE

■ Tomorrow: Stanford (0-1) vs. UC-
Davis (1-0), 1 p.m. New Maloney
Field.
Restructuring in the WWLL has
transformed Stanford's schedule.
This will be the first year that the
Cardinal plays Cal and UC-Davis
twice, and the first time it opens the
season with this emotionally
charged pair of games.
Stanford head coach Heidi Con
nor said the restructuring "has just
completely changed the intensity of
the entire season, in a good wav, but

in a way I don't know it we were pre
pared for on Sunday.
"We used to have the whole sea
son to build up momentum for those
games," Connor said. "But now
they're right at the beginning and
down the stretch."
The team did see flashes of excel
lence in the loss: sophomore Kather
ine Barnes had five goals and senior
goalie Stephanie Tuerk helped lead
a young defense.
Much of the team's potential this
year rests in its freshman class. 11
players strong. Patti Zettler. a high
school All-American, and defender
Jenny Silverman, from the Califor
nia state champion Thacher School
team, are among the most highly
touted of the new recruits.
"The freshmen have their first
Division I game under their belts,
and I think they're more ready to
play [this weekend)," Connor said.
