WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

â–  Tonight: No. 9 Stanford (6-2, 4-1
Pacific 10 Conference) at. Arizona
(6-4,2-2), 7:30 p.m.
With only three regular season
competitions left in the season,
the No. 9 Stanford women's gym
nastics team (6-2, 4-1 Pacific 10
Conference) comes into tonight's
faceoff with Arizona (6-4, 2-2)
looking to build on the momen
tum from its upset of seventh
ranked Arizona State last week at
Burnham Pavilion.
"Our goals for this meet are
just to hit a good meet and keep
our momentum going [from last
week's win]," said Cardinal senior
Katie Fitzpatrick. "People are re
alizing that there's not much time
left and we need to decide what
we want."
Judging from last week's per
formance in which Stanford post
ed season-highs in the vault
(48.675), balance beam (48.925)
and team total score (195.775),
Cardinal gymnasts expect and
want a lot out of this season.
And so as the Cardinal pre
pares to square off against a dan
gerous but unranked Wildcat
squad, it will need to compete
with the same energy and enthusi
asm as it did against the Sun Dev
ils if it is to return victorious and
maintain its momentum.
Leading the way for the Cardi

nal will be senior co-captain Amy
Murakami and sophomore Jen
Exaltacion. Against the Sun Dev
ils last Friday night, Murakami
continued her superb season by
winning the floor exercise (9.925)
and the uneven bars (9.900) and
the all-around competition with
the team's season-high of 39.275.
Murakami's win on the bars was
her fourth in a row in an event in
which she ranks fourth nationally.
Her score in the all-around com
petition also earned her a fourth
place national ranking.
Exaltacion enters tonight's
meet coming off the best competi
tion of her young Stanford career.
Against Arizona State, Exalta
cion broke the school record on
the balance beam with a near-per
fect 9.975 in addition to placing
first in the vaulting competition
(9.825) and second on the uneven
parallel bars (9.875). Had it not
been for a fall in the floor exercise,
Exaltacion would have taken
home the all-around champi
onship as well. Exaltacion ranks
18th nationally and second in the
Pac-10 on the balance beam and
has placed first in that event four
times this season.
Besides Exaltacion and Mu
rakami, the Cardinal expects solid
performances from freshman
Becky Meldrum and sophomore
Jenny Wilson. Last week against
the Sun Devils, while filling in for
injured teammate Katy Herbert,
Meldrum took home second place
honors on the uneven parallel
bars.
Wilson continues to be among
the most consistent Cardinal gym
nasts and last Friday night was no
