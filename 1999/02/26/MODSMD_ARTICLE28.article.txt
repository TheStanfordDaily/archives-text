■ Tomorrow -Sunday: No. 3 Stanford competes at the UC-
Santa Barbara Invitational.
In its last match, No. 3 Stanford (6-1) defeated No. 6
Hawaii (6-5) in an 8-4 decision. Since then, the Cardinal
women have been focusing on getting ready for the last
big tournament before the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration season gets into full swing.
"This (weekend) marks the last competition in the first
stage of our season," said Stanford head coach John Fan
ner. "It's sort of the end of our preseason, even though
we've already had two [MPSF] games. After this we'll
have dual league matches leading up to the postseason
and the NCAA qualifying tournament and Nationals."
With six wins, the Cardinal is well on its way to having
yet another successful season. And with lots of time to get
ready for this weekend, the Stanford squad has been using
its time to refine its skills and improve its offense.
"()ur defense has been good, so we're not really work
ing on that too much," Tanner said. "But we've worked a
lot on our counterattack and our offense. We've had

trouble scoring goals, especially against the better teams,
so we're just trying to figure out some ways to improve our
scoring."
According to Tanner, only a few of the top teams have
particularly strong offensive players. This season, scoring
— and winning — has come down to being able to capi
talize on key offensive opportunities through team strate
gies as opposed to relying on individual players.
"We've worked a lot on our 6-on-5 and 5-on-6 since
that's what it comes down to," Tanner said. "Most of the
teams | this year] are having to score goals with good com
binations and team play, and we're no exception."
Along with working on its set plays, Stanford is also
struggling to get all of its players healthy before the tour
nament.
"We've had a few injuries and illnesses over the last
week," Tanner said. "But I hope [everyone's] going to be
ready to go this weekend."
Most of the 16 teams competing in this weekend's
tournament will be using the opportunity to get one last
look at the competition before the intense part of the
MPSF season begins. And Stanford is no exception.
"After this weekend we're going to evaluate where we
stand and see what we need to improve on," Tanner said.
"But otherwise, we're going to be sticking to the game
plan we started with at the beginning of the season."
Stanford's first round game against Occidental is at 8
a.m. tomorrow morning. If the Cardinal wins, it will take
on the winner of the UC-Davis/ UC-San Diego match in
the quarterfinals at 2 p.m. The semifinal and champi
onship matches are scheduled for Sunday.
