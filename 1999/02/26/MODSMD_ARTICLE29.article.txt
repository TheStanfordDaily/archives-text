# Trojans dismantle volleyball
## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
Last night, throughout most of
game one of the No. 12 Stanford
men's volleyball team's (4-7, 3-7
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) match against No. 10 USC (7-4,
6-3), the Cardinal showed glimpses
of the potential it demonstrated
when it defeated then-No. 2 Hawaii
earlier in the season.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Yesterday: No. 10 USC (7-4, 6-3
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
def. No. 12 Stanford (4-7,3-7) 16-14,
15-7,15-6).
■ Tonight: Stanford vs. No. 3 Long
Beach State (9-0, 6-0), 7 p.m. Burn
ham Pavilion.
Although the Achilles' heel of
the Cardinal in recent matches has
been its inability to side out, Stan
ford was not plagued by this persis
tent problem in the first game. The
Cardinal capitalized on its scoring
opportunities and the Trojans strug
gled to match Stanford point for
point.
In game one, there were also crit
ical instances when inconsistent play
and poor passing enabled the Tro
jans to rack up a string of answered
points and get back into the game.
That's how the rest of the match
progressed as Stanford lost its third
three-game contest in a row in a 16-
14, 15-7 and 15-6 decision.
Concentration lapses at crucial
points in game one enabled the Tro
jans to remain competitive and
eventually capture the opening set.
After 18 rotations, Stanford bat
tled to a 7-5 lead only to allow the
Trojans to score four quick points.
"Giving up four points like that in
a row — that's inconsistent play,"
said head coach Ruben Nieves.
Another such instance occurred
when USC earned a sideout when
Stanford failed to capitalize on a 14-

13 game-point opportunity. A Car
dinal hitting error and bad passing
enabled the Trojans to win the next
three points and the game.
Stanford never recovered from
losing this close battle. In fact, its
play got worse in the final two
games.
"After we lost game one, it was
tough, because it could have gone ei
ther way," said freshman outside hit
ter Marcus Skacel. "It seemed like
we gave up, we lost the confidence,
and the spark that we had in game
one."
The Cardinal problems that oc
curred intermittently during game
one dominated the rest of the
match.
In particular, the defense broke
down and could not control the Tro
jan offense, which recorded a .459
hitting percentage in game three.
Stanford recorded six total team
blocks to the Trojans' 10.
"You can tell a lot about a team
by its mental toughness and its de
fense," Nieves said. "We were out
done by our opponent in both as
pects."
Not only was Stanford's mental
toughness lax, but at times it seemed
like the Cardinal was maintaining a
mere physical presence in the game.
Stanford did not play three close
balls, which ended up being called
in, and resulted in USC points.
"We were unaggressive," Nieves
said. "We were hoping that the other
team would make a mistake instead
of concentrating on earning points.
A good volleyball team plays all the
balls and takes matters into its own
hands."
Eighteen Stanford service errors
set up even more Trojan scoring op
portunities. And USC took advan
tage of these chances.
USC recorded a .4(X) team hitting
percentage for the evening. Fresh
man Trojan outside hitter Brook
Billings led the attacking effort with
a .538 hitting percentage and tallied

17 kills for the evening. Sophomore
Trojan outside hitter Eli Fairfield,
who sat out last week's games with
the flu, was second on the team in
kills with 11.
To the Stanford offense's credit,

the Cardinal had strong individual
performances. One sueh effort came
from junior outside hitter Gabe
Gardner.

The No. 12 men's volleyball team will try to rebound from last night's
three-game lossto 10th-ranked USC when it faces No. 3 Long Beach
State tonight in Burnham Pavilion.
Gardner competed in his first
two years of collegiate eligibility as a
Trojan. Despite being bothered by a
stress fracture in his leg and having
practiced sparingly, Gardner started
in last night's contest against his for
mer school. The junior had one of

his strongest hitting matches of the
season, leading the Cardinal with 17
kills.
Stanford will need this type of ef
fort tonight when it takes on third
ranked Long Beach State, which sits
atop the Pacific Division of the
MPSF with an undefeated record.
With each conference loss, Stan
ford's post-season aspirations dwin
dle.
