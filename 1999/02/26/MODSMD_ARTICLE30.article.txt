After last Saturday's heartbreaking loss to Brigham
Young, the men's gyninasties team travels to Los Ange
les to compete in the UCLA Invitational against some fa
miliar foes.
Tonight's meet will feature two teams that the No. 13
Cardinal (6-3) has already faced twice this season — No.
16UC-Santa Barbara and No. 10 BYU. The other oppo
nent, No. 12 California, has faced Stanford three times.
BYU has beaten the Cardinal both times the two
squads have met this season. The Cougars first win came
almost three weeks ago in the BYU Invitational. Their
final point score of 222.25 was almost nine points higher
than Stanford's 213.60 total. In that match BYU not only
dominated the overall competition, but also excelled in
the individual events, easily taking every single one.
Cougar gymnast Guard Young was a very big factor
in the meet, winning the all-around competition, floor
exercise, pommel horse and vault and finishing second
in the remaining events — high and parallel bars and still
rings.
Their most recent win, which came this past weekend,
was an intensely fought battle that ended with the victors
separated from the losers by mere hundredths of a point.

"Everyone felt like this loss was a team responsibili
ty," said Junior Ricardo Andrade. "If anyone had hit this
dismount or hadn't stumbled on that landing, we would
have won."
In this most recent of meets. Young's talents were
overshadowed by the stellar performances of two Bears.
California senior co-captain Alexander Nissen raked in
yet another all-around title to remain undefeated in that
competition this season. Aside from sophomore gym
nast Dave Eskilden, no other California gymnasts
placed in the top three in any events, while BYU had
eight players place in the top three. So, what BYU
lacked in star power it made up for in depth, ending up
with the win.

■ Tomorrow: No. 16 Stanford will compete at the UC-
Santa Barbara Invtitational, 7:30p.m.
With this last win against California, the Cardinal has
taken two out of three meets from the Bears this season.
However, because the national rankings are based on an
average of high scores, the Bears are still ranked ahead of
Stanford, even though Stanford has a better record than
