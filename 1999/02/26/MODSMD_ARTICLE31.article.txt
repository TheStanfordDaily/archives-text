■ Today-Sunday: No. 14 Stanford
(9-2) will compete at the National
Fastpitch Leadoff Classic, Colum
bus, Ga.
As Stanford prepares for the first
game against the Cowgirls of OSU,
revenge will be on the mind of all
Cardinal players. The only meeting
in history between these two teams
occurred last year in May at the
NCAA Regional Championship
game. Oklahoma State defeated
Stanford by a score of 4-0.
The Lady Indians of Northeast
Louisiana(B-6), have also played the
Cardinal before. The competition,
which also resulted in a Cardinal loss
(10-0), took place in 1994, the first
year that Stanford had a varsity soft
ball team.
Central Michigan will see its first
competition of the season this week

end in Columbus. Stanford and the
Chippewas have never met before.
Though disappointed that it did
not finish first at the
Campbell /Cartier Classic, the Car
dinal certainly has some things to
smile about. Freshman sensation
Jessica Mendoza is having an out
standing season thus far. The center
fielder from Camarillo, Calif., is
leading the Cardinal team in batting
(.500), hits (15), RBIs (14) and dou
bles (5). Mendoza, who hit her first
home run with Stanford last week
end versus Wichita State, is also rid
ing a nine-game hitting streak.
Fellow freshman Sarah Beeson,
who likewise hit her first home run in
a Stanford uniform this weekend
against lowa State, also seems to be
a growing star for the team. Beeson.
who plays first base, is second behind
Mendoza in RBIs with eight and
third in batting average vvith .393.
Pitchers Becky Blevins and
Marcy Crouch have played out
standingly so far. The seniors, whose
records are 5-1 and 4-1. respectively,
look to continue dominating their
opponents this weekend.
