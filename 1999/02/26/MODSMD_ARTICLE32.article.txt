# No. 1 men's tennis misses out on Illi-

### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
So much for getting back at No. 5
Illinois.
The top-ranked Stanford men's
tennis (6-1, 2-0) team was forced to
cancel today's match with the Illini.
Illinois, who ended the Cardi-

12 p.m.

nal's 46-match winning streak by
beating it last week in the semifinals
of the National Team Indoor Cham
pionships, has several players who
are ill and its doctor did not clear the
team to travel.
As a result, Stanford's weekend
slate will now consist of a road trip to
California to take on the Golden
Bears (3-2,1-1) tomorrow at noon.
The cancellation of today's
match against Illinois was an emo
tional downer for the Cardinal, who
was hoping to have another chance
at beating Illinois and thus jumping
back ahead of them for the NCAA
seedings in May. Now, in the next
national rankings both Illinois and
UCLA will most likely be placed
ahead of the top-ranked Cardinal.
But the players and coaches realize
that rankings only mean so much.
"Everyone is definitely disap
pointed that we don't get another
shot at them." said sophomore Alex
Kim. "It would have been nice to
beat them and jump back in front of
them, but we have never concerned
ourselves too much with rankings in
February. We have to accept it and

not let it affect our play."
Sophomore Scotty Scott agreed,
but appeared a bit more angry.
"It seems like a convenient time
for them to come up sick," he said.
"They have nothing to gain bv play
ing us again. But I'll try not to cast
too much blame on them, because
they could have legitimate reasons
not to be able to make the trip. Ei
ther way, I hope we can use the de
sire we had to play them as a positive
and just move right along."
I he Cardinal will have to move
on to a young but tough California
squad. The Bears may not be as
strong on paper as they were last
year, but at home they always pose a
challenge for the Cardinal. The Car
dinal will be back at full strength
against California, as Kim's stress
fracture in his left shin appears fully
healed. Now just needs to focus on
getting back into match shape.
"We're ready and healthy," said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould.
"Cal is a young team, but they are
scrappy and always tough to play at
their place. We're playing fine ten
nis right now. There are some things
we need to work 011, but that is what
these matches are for."
The Cardinal is aware that al
though this may be a match they
should win. the Bears always seem
to raise their level for the big rivalry.
"Cal will be as good as we let
them be," said Stanford assistant
coach John Whitlinger. "The crowd
is always a factor there and their
players seem to get extra pumped
up for us. We just have to play ag
gressive tennis and be ready from
the start. It's another building block
for the rest of the year."
