# Women's tennis ready for rival

### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team (10-1 overall, 3-0
Pacific 10 Conference) would have liked a rest after its
close loss to Florida in the semifinals of the National
Team Indoor Championships in Madison, Wise., last
weekend. Instead, the fifth-ranked Cardinal will be test
ed by its nemesis, fourth-ranked California (5-0,3-0) to
morrow.
"We've survived the nation's top team," said head
coach Frank Brennan. "But this is a tough way to come
home."
Tomorrow's match at the Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter, which will start at noon, should feature several in
triguing singles match-ups. All of Stanford's top com
petitors, including the nation's second-ranked player,
freshman sensation Marissa Irvin, should be in action
against the Bears.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Tomorrow: No. 5 Stanford (10-1, 3-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) vs. No. 4 California (5-0,3-0), 12 p.m. Taube Family
Tennis Center.

Cal, however, has three players ranked in the na
tion's top-40: No. 25 Anita Kurimay, No. 32 Amanda
Augustus and No. 36 Francesca La'O.
The Bears' top doubles team of Augustus and Amy
Jensen is ranked third in the nation, one spot behind the
Cardinal's duo of Irvin and junior Teryn Ashley. The
two tandems, which will face each other in the No. 1
doubles match tomorrow, are already developing a ri
valry, having split their previous two encounters.
"Cal's a really deep team," said captain and veteran
star Ashley, who plays at the No. 2 singles spot for the
Cardinal and whose recent stellar play has earned her a
No. 9 national ranking. "In years past, we've been able
to handle them pretty easily, but this year, they're
ranked a spot above us."
Brennan, of course, said he feels that his squad is bet
ter than its current ranking, having witnessed how close
the young Cardinal team came to upsetting the top
ranked Gators last weekend.
"I think that we're one of three teams [along with
Georgia and Duke] that is really challenging Florida for
the top spot," he said.

Junior Teryn Ashley and the women's tennis team will try to bounce back from its first
loss of the year when it travels to No. 4 California tomorrow.
