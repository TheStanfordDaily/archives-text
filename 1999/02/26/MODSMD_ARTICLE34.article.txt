# No. 4 baseball battles defending champs
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
To call the Stanford baseball
team's next several games a difficult
stretch would be an understatement.
Starting tonight, the fourth
ranked Cardinal (10-4) will hit a por
tion of its schedule in which 12 of its
next 14 games will be against ranked
opponents. Ten of those 14 games are
also on the road. And what better
way to kick off this stretch than with a
three-game series against defending
NCAA champion USC in Los Ange
les?

BASEBALL
■ Tonight: No. 4 Stanford (10-4) at
No. 19 USC (4-9). 7 p.m.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford at USC 1 p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford at USC 1 p.m.

The series against the No. 19 Tro
jans (4-9) will also be Stanford's sec
ond non-conference series against a
Pacific 10 Conference opponent in as
many weeks.
"They're 4-9 right now and that
scares me," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "They're
going to be better than 4-9 and we're
getting them at a time when they're
obviously upset and they'll want to
rebound against us and they're very
capable of doing that, especially at
home."
The Cardinal enters this series

having experienced a rather startling
reversal of roles through its first 14
games. Heading into the season,
Stanford was expected to ride the ex
perienced bats of players like senior
third baseman Josh Hochgesang and
junior first baseman John Gall while
the young pitching staff developed.
Instead, it has been the pitching that
has blown away its so-called question
mark with some heady performances
while the offense struggles to score
runs.
Sophomore right-hander Jason
Young, who will start tomorrow's 1
p.m. game, has emerged as an ace,
garnering three wins in four decisions
to go with a sterling 2.31 ERA.
Tonight's starter, sophomore right
hander Justin Wayne (2-1, 6.57
ERA), has also shown some flash —
even in starts in which he struggles.
Despite walking four batters and al
lowing five runs in five innings, he still
managed to strike out a career-high
nine hitters.
"The thing that has been amazing
to me is that we're hitting .240 as a
team," Marquess said. "But we're 10-
4 with a pretty good schedule."
With the Trojans the defending
champs and the preseason No. 1 team
in the country, there was nowhere for
them to go but down. USC" has gone
winless on the road, including a three
game sweep at Texas. The Trojans'
nine losses have been by a total of 14
runs, and they have also gone 1-5 in
one-run games.
Still, the team boasts a consider

able amount of offensive fire power.
Junior catcher Eric Munson. a pre
season first-team Ail-American, is
hitting .442 with seven home runs and
22 KB Is. Senior center fielder Jason
Lane, one of the heroes from last
year's Col lege World Series, has hit at
a .409 clip in live games since return
ing from a thumb injury.
While Marquess had considered

the three-game set at Cal State-
Fullerton the second weekend of the
season as the toughest test his team
has faced, he may have to correct
himself starting tonight when the real
fun begins.
"We've got a lot of tough ones
coming up, but it's good," Marquess
said. "When you play the Fresnos,
when you play the Fullertonsand you

play the Texases, they're always
going to he good. They're used to
winning and they're used to having a
strong program.
"It's always good for you to play
that type of program because it's a
good test of where you are. You
might get your brains beat in a little
bit, but in the long run it benefits
vou."
