# Policy may threaten aid
## Law School must be wary of military recruiting law

series on military recruiting at law
schools. Today: Recruiting at Stan
ford. Monday: National reform ef
forts.
When it comes to military recruit
ing at the Law School, Stanford is
stuck between a rock and a hard
place.
If the Law School permits military
recruiting, it could violate its nondis
crimination policy. Hut if the school
bars the military from recruiting on
its facilities, Stanford could lose up to
$1 million in federal funding.
The conflict boils down to two
statutes — one a school policy, the
other a federal law.
According to its nondiscrimina

tion policy, the Law School "makes
its facilities and services open only to
employers who do not discriminate
on the basis of ... sexual orienta
tion."
A federal law, popularly called
the Solomon Amendment, prohibits
certain federal funds from being
"used to provide contracts or grants
to any institution of higher education
that ... prevents military recruit
ment on campus."
In other words, the Law School
bans recruiters who discriminate by
sexual orientation, while Congress
mandates that, to receive federal
funding, schools must allow the mili
tary, which will not hire openly gay
individuals, to recruit on campus.
Avoiding the conflict
Thus far the Law School has es
caped directly confronting the issue
thanks to a new recruiting policy im
plemented last spring. The policy
does not keep the military away be
cause of concern over its practices,
but instead due to lack of student in
terest in working for the Judge Ad
vocate General Corps, the legal arm
existing in a number of armed forces
branches.
"We have a policy where new re
cruiters want to conduct interviews,
they post their information on our
Web site, and, unless five students
sign up. we tell the employer too
bad," Law School Dean Paul Brest
said.
According to Brest, when a mili
tary recruiter posted a listing this fall,
only one student signed up. and the
recruiter was thus not extended an in
vitation to campus. The school's ca
reer development center has not
heard from J A( i since its request was
denied.
Until five or more students ex
press interest, the Law School need
make no decision on whether it will
permit on-site interviews, Brest said.
"We have never had an occasion
to determine whether they violate
the [nondiscrimination] rules," Brest
said.
According to law student Alan

Drexel, former head of Outlaw, Stan
ford Law Students for Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Equality, "were a deter
mination to he made, the military
would clearly be in flagrant violation
of the" nondiscrimination policy.
Many students are pleased that
the Law School's policies have result
ed in no interviewing on campus.
"The [Office of Career Services]
policy was a good solution, because it
showed that there just isn't student
interest," said Toni Broaddus, a law
student and member of Outlaw.
Broaddus admits, however, that
she had hoped for a stronger state
ment from the school.
"In some ways I was disappointed
that we didn't take a stronger stance,
although my main concern is keeping
[the recruiters] off campus and keep
ing our nondiscrimination policy
from changing, which has been suc
cessful," she said.
University policy
Although the Law School does
not allow discriminatory employers
to recruit on its facilities, the Univer
sity as a whole has no such policy.
"We will allow any bona fide em
ployer to recruit on campus," said
Bob Thirsk, head of the Career De
velopment Center.
According to Brest, Law School
students can and do have discussions
with military recruiters through other
campus outlets like the CDC.

"Our policy doesn't cover all stu
dent contact with these groups, just
|Law| School sponsored contact,"
Brest said.
The military could therefore
arrange interviews at the CDC, a
University-wide center, instead of at
the Law School Office of Career Ser
vices, to get around the Law School's
nondiscrimination strictures.
Such a scenario occurred in the
fall of 1997, when JAG set up several
interviews at the CDC. When few
students signed up for the interviews,
JAG canceled its trip, and the CDC
has since received no interview re
quests from them, according to
ITiirsk.
Outlaw planned a variety of
protests after learning of JAG's
planned on-campus interviews and
would do so again should the corps
make any future plans to interview
on campus, according to Broaddus.
"We didn't find out until the week
before they were coming, but we had
several things planned, including fill
ing the interview slots with gay or
pro-gay students," she said.
Thirsk said that military recruiters
do occasionally show up at campus
career fairs and other recruiting
venues.
"I'm perfectly willing to accom
modate the military," he said, adding
that his stance does not mean that he
condones the military's practices to
ward gays.

Future plans
The military has thus far accept
ed restrictions on recruiting when
they are general restrictions based
on lack of student interest, like Stan
ford's.
That does not mean, however,
that Stanford has permanently evad
ed the issue. Thirsk noted that the
military is not known for backing
down.
"In working with the military,
I've found that if they really wanted
to push the issue, they would find a
way to come," he said.
In case the military does press the
issue at some point in the future, the
Law School is working on a contin
gency plan.
"Dean Brest convened a
fundraising task force ... to look at
ways of doing targeted fundraising
to replace funds that might be lost in
the future due to enforcement of the
Solomon Amendment." Drexel
said.
Brest steps down in September,
however, and will be replaced by
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan. Sulli
van could not be reached for com
ment on the issue, but Drexel called
her "a strong ally of the
lesbian I gay / bisexual community."
Sullivan co-wrote a friend-of-the
court brief opposing Colorado's
anti-gay rights amendment in the
1996 Supreme Court case Roemer v.
Evans.
