## Law School must be wary of military recruiting law

Editor's note: Part one of a two-purl
series on military recruiting at law
schools. Today: Recruiting at Stan
ford. Monday: National reform ef
forts.
When it comes to military recruit
ing at the Law School, Stanford is
stuck between a rock and a hard
place.
If the Law School permits military
recruiting, it could violate its nondis
crimination policy. Hut if the school
bars the military from recruiting on
its facilities, Stanford could lose up to
$1 million in federal funding.
The conflict boils down to two
statutes â€” one a school policy, the
other a federal law.
According to its nondiscrimina

tion policy, the Law School "makes
its facilities and services open only to
employers who do not discriminate
on the basis of ... sexual orienta
tion."
A federal law, popularly called
the Solomon Amendment, prohibits
certain federal funds from being
"used to provide contracts or grants
to any institution of higher education
that ... prevents military recruit
ment on campus."
In other words, the Law School
bans recruiters who discriminate by
sexual orientation, while Congress
mandates that, to receive federal
funding, schools must allow the mili
tary, which will not hire openly gay
individuals, to recruit on campus.
