Stanford Professors Patrick
Hanrahan, Ronald Howard. Don
ald Iglehart and James Swartz
were elected to the National
Academy of Engineering on Feb.
16.
They were among 80 engineers
elected this year. The academy has
1,984 members in the United
States, of whom 79 work at Stan
ford.
The award is considered one of
the most prestigious awards for
U.S. engineers. It honors engi
neers who have made important
contributions to engineering theo
ry and practice.
Prof. Patrick Hanrahan has
worked in the Computer Science
Department since 1995. Before
coming to Stanford, Hanrahan
worked at PIXAR Animation Stu
dios, the company responsible for
movies such as Toy Story and A
Bug's Life.
In 1993, Hanrahan won an

Oscar for the use of a visual effects
computer program he developed
that was used in the movie Jurassic
Park.
He has also served on the facul
ty at Princeton University, where
he won three teaching awards.
Currently Hanrahan is working
on a research project to develop a
three-dimensional display system
called the responsive workbench.
Ronald Howard has been a pro
fessor of engineering-economic
systems and operations research
since 1965. Among his accomplish
ments. he is a founding director
and chairman of the Strategic De
cisions Group and also a founder
and director of the Decisions and
Ethics Center at Stanford.
Howard originally studied elec
trical engineering and operations
research at MIT, where he re
ceived a doctorate in 1958.
The award honored his devel
opment of the field of decision
analysis.
When asked about the award,
Howard said that he was "pleased
and gratified by the honor," and
that, "it's always nice to be recog
nized for what you've done for oth
ers."
Howard says he is most proud of
"the many students that I've had
over the years whose life they claim
has been changed for the better by
my development and teaching in
the field."
In the same field is Prof. Donald
Iglchart, who has been at Stanford
since 1%7. He said that "for some

one in the field of operations re
search this [award] is a tremendous
honor."
Iglehart has "made numerous
contributions to the literatures of
inventory control, queuing theory,
simulation methodology and diffu
sion approximations."
James Swart/ is a professor of
chemical engineering and has made
large contributions to the field of
fermentation.
He has been at Stanford since
1998, after a career in the biotech
nology industry. Swartz has made
important contributions linking mi
croscopic biological processes with
the mechanics of large scale fer
mentation.
