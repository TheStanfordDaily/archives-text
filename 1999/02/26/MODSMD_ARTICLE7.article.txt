At yesterday's meeting of the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of University Professors, about 15
faculty members discussed the role of lecturers in under
graduate education.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences lan Morris,
Senior Lecturer Annamaria Napolitano and Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education Ramon Saldivar discussed
concerns about the treatment of lecturers, an issue raised
at a Faculty Senate meeting earlier this month.
At Stanford many lecturers have a heavy teaching load,
teaching foreign language, freshman writing and other
courses. But they aren't paid as much as professors, lead
ing some staff members to wonder if the University
overuses lecturers.
Faculty members at the meeting expressed concern
about a lack of clarity in University policy on the hiring
and compensation of lecturers.
Napolitano identified several problems concerning lec
turers at Stanford, including unclear terms in their con
tracts and that the administration failed to define their ob
scure legal status. Stanford lecturers, according to Napoli
tano, are subject to termination due to "programmatic
needs," have little possibilities of promotion and receive

heavier work loads than professors.
Napolitano claimed that "the
problem of lecturers is highly charged
of moral correctness and boils down
to the problem of gender," noting
that female lecturers far outnumber
male lecturers on campus. "Our
salaries are low and reflect gender
treatment," she added.
Despite lecturers' smaller salaries,
Napolitano said that there is a "gen
eral perception that wc must be more
active."
Saldivar stated that "the status of
undergraduate education is undergo

ing a tremendous redefinition,"
adding that the "task is to involve stu
dents in the search for knowledge."
He emphasized that the question of
lecturers cannot be answered outside
of this context.
He mentioned the conflict be
tween teaching and research. He said
that students demand that "the won
derful research libraries and the great
faculty that wins Nobel Prizes be
available to them from the first day
they arrive on campus."
"It boils down to a major realloca
tion of resources from research to
teaching," he explained and empha
sized the importance to "share the
process of creation of knowledge
with first- and second-year students."
