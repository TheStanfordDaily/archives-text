What's Enough
If you feel sleepy during the day,
whether in a "boring" lecture or
in front of the TV, you probably
need more sleep. Without
enough sleep, you're attention
span is shorter, and you can
become increasingly irritable.
Sleep needs are highly individ
ual. We all have an internal clock
that sets bodily functions,
including when we are most alert
and when we sleep best during a
24-hour period (our circadian
rhythm). Some students:
■ Need as little as 7 hours of
sleep; others need 10 (most
need 8 to 10)
■ Can sleep through anything;
others are awakened easily
by sound, light, or tempera
ture change
■ Are most alert in the evening;
others in the morning (this is
genetically determined)
■ Get sleepy after having sex;
others are energized
Is Sleep a Waste of
Time?
No. Your brain never rests, even
when you're asleep. It remains
electrically and metabolically
active, tending to its nighttime
tasks as you snooze away.
Recordings of electrical impulses
from the brain show two distinct
kinds of sleep: REM (Rapid Eye
Movement) or "dream sleep,"
Ever wander through a dreamy
landscape in your sleep? However
ephemeral dream imagery may
appear, your brain is hard at ivork
behind the scenes.
and NREM (Non-Rapid Eye
Movement). Each type of sleep
performs a different (but vital)
function. NREM sleep helps you
to attend and concentrate during
the day. REM sleep consolidates
short-term memory (such as the
new concepts, facts, and skills
you learn in a day) into long-term
memory, enabling you to retain it.
Sleepiness
Here are causes and cures for
most daytime sleepiness:
Sleep Debt: Do you deprive
yourself of sleep, then later crash?
If so, you've created a "sleep
debt," and lost much of the
benefits of the REMand NREM
sleep that you've missed. As long
as you don't get an adequate
amount of sleep, the debt grows
larger. When this debt is large
enough, it can take at least two
weeks of getting the right amount
every night to catch up.
Naps can help pay off sleep debt.
Even a 10 or 20 minute nap can
make a difference. If you wake
up from a short nap feeling
crummy, don't worry. In an hour
or so you'll have renewed energy.
Note: if you have difficulty
sleeping at night, don't nap.
Phase Delay: You can override
your natural tendency of being a
morning or an evening person by
establishing a different sleep
wake cycle. Switching over to
another pattern creates a "phase
delay" which can cause daytime
sleepiness, even if you are getting
enough total hours of sleep. To
correct this, reset your internal
clock by going to sleep and
getting up at roughly the same
time every day, consistently,
including weekends.
let Lag: When you fly across time
zones, your circadian rhythm is
out of synch with the day-night
cycle of your new environment.
Try to switch to your new
location's schedule immediately.
Sleep Disorders: If you sleep 8 to 9
hours a night and are still sleepy
during the day, you could have a
sleep disorder, especially if you
snore loudly while asleep. There
can be serious health conse
quences, so discuss the situation
with a medical practitioner.
Trouble Sleeping?
■ Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and
heavy use of alcohol
■ Sleep in a comfortable and
quiet place (earplugs can
help)
