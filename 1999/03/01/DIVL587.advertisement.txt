from the desk of Chiara Smutina
TO: HOUSING ASSIGNMENT SERVICES
STATUS: CLASSIFIED
So, you have heard from my resident assistant that I "know"a lot of boys on campus.
It is true that I am very familiar with the "ins and outs" of many frosh and their
residences. As you requested, I looked at your Incoming Frosh Dormitory
Placement Guidelines and made some necessary changes. An updated version
follows:
BRANNER: Obnoxious, hyperactive frosh who enjoy large, curtainless showers.
OTERO: Hot girls with big booties, socially maladjusted boys.
RINCONADA: Hot boys with things for big booties, socially maladjusted.
BURBANK: Far too religious. It takes too much persuading to get banged by one of these.
JUNIPERO: Nice people who dance funny and wear helmets.
ROBLE: Yuck! By far the worst lovers on campus. Trust me.
ARROYO: Nobody really lives there.
LARKIN: Fat, sweaty drunks.
DONNER: Muscled, sketchy drunks.
CASA ZAPATA: Blondes who have recurring nightmares of having their faces erased.
MIRLO: Arrogant intellectuals who never learned to talk.
LORO: Arrogant intellectuals with strange sexual perversions.
GRANADA: Hippie chicks who like to swim naked in I.ake Lag.
NARANJA: Frosh you will never see.
Don't forget to set aside the boys with the hottest wallet size pictures to be placed in
Casa Chiara. Good luck.
