## Men's basketball downs Arizona for first-ever Pac-10 title 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Dreams came true on Saturday
night at Maples Pavilion.
Chills ran up and down spines.
Faces caked in red paint smiled
until they hurt.
Hundreds of students rushed
the floor and created a human wave
machine, upon which Mark Mad
sen and David Moseley took a ride.
And Mike Montgomery, the dis
tinguished, stoic head coach of the
Stanford men's basketball team,
traded in his suit and tie for a back
wards baseball cap and a new form
of neckwear — the net.

■ Saturday: No. 6 Stanford (24-5.14-
2 Pacific 10 Conference) 98, No. 7
Arizona (20-6, 11-5) 83.

These displays of unbridled
emotion were the final touches on
an absolutely perfect night.
The No. 6 Cardinal had just
clinched its first-ever Pacific 10
Conference title with a 98-83
thrashing of Arizona on Senior
Night at Maples.
Stanford fans had long hoped it
would he like this, and when their
wishes were finally realized, it was
almost too much to handle.
Before the game, the Maples
faithful had witnessed a moving
ceremony to honor the greatest
graduating class in the program's
history. Players fought hack tears
■as they carried flowers to their par
ents at midcourt.

But Montgomery will long re
member the day he turned 52 by the
ultimately sweet gift his players
gave him on the floor.
"It's been a long time coming,"
Montgomery said. "I want to enjoy
this. Hey, they were having some
fun [after the game], and they de
served it.
'if you could write a script, this is
about as well as we could have
done."
In the wake of the biggest emo
tional roller coaster ride of his
young life, senior point guard
Arthur Lee had that look of disbe
lief in his eyes — the very same
glassy look that came over him after
the two-minute stretch against
Rhode Island when he scored 13
points and carried Stanford to the
Final Four.
"This is the best feeling I've ever
experienced," Lee said. When
asked if he was sure last night was
better than the Final Four, Lee was
quick to answer — and he was un
derstood, loud and clear.
"They are two different entities,"
Lee clarified. "But to do this here
tonight on Senior Night, in front of
our fans with our families here ... I
can't even describe it with words."
Heading into the game, no one
was quite sure how this unparalleled
level of emotion and nostalgia
would affect the play itself.
"I was emotional before the
game," Lee said. "I was emotional
when the game started. It was tough
for me to stay composed for the
opening tip."
From the second the game start
ed, however, it was clear that the
Cardinal (24-5, 14-2 Pac-10) would
channel all its emotion into positive
energy.
Stanford, which has struggled all
year long in the first half, sprinted
out to a 2()-point lead.
The Cardinal's backcourt duo of
Lee and Kris Weems were obvious
ly ready to make a statement to All-
America candidate Jason Terry,
whose last-second shot defeated
Stanford in Tucson.
"I just wanted to make sure I
didn't cry (before the game],"
Weems said. "And I didn't."
Instead, Weems came out and
torched No. 7 Arizona (20-6, 11-5)
for 17 first-half points, hitting 5 of 7
three-pointers.
With his fourth trifecta of the

half, Weems put Stanford ahead 37-
17. But Terry sparked 17-6 run to
end the half and draw Arizona with
in nine at the intermission.
Terry, who scored 29 against the
Cardinal in Tucson, looked to be
heating up as the teams headed into
the locker rooms.
Lee and Weems had other ideas.
The guard tandem put the defensive
clamps down on Terry in the second
half and held him to 7-of-29 shoot
ing from the field for the game.
"We played our best team de
fense of the season tonight," Lee
said. "Wc were thinking about pay

back all week long. Jason Ferry is a
catalyst in their offense, to say the
least. But we picked up the defen
sive intensity tonight."
Stanford's guard play was a defi
nite key to victory, which was in
credibly fortunate considering the
foul trouble that plagued its normal
ly-dominant frontcourt.
Starters Tim Young and Mark
Madsen both picked up two fouls
early, bringing sophomore Jarron
Collins and senior Mark Seaton off

a pair of quick fouls, though, it
looked as if the Widcats big men, led
by senior center A.J. Bramlett,
would dominate inside.
But forward Michael Wright,
one of the premier freshmen in the
nation, was in even more severe foul
trouble and played just six minutes
all night.
And the shots just kept on falling
for Stanford. The Cardinal shot 54
percent from the field on the night,
nailing 48 percent from beyond the
three-point arc.
Lee scored a career-high 29
points and was a perfect 12 for 12
from the free-throw line, while
Weems finished with 23.
Collins was once again a beast off

the bench in the second half, stop
ping Arizona runs with big offensive
boards and dazzling post moves.
Collins finished with 13 points and
senior forward Peter Sauer chipped
in with 11, including a pair of threes.
Thirty-seven ticks away from the
title, Montgomery sent Seaton into
the game to join Lee, Weems and
Sauer and enjoy the closing seconds
of his final game at Maples. Tim
Young had fouled out several min
utes earlier and was the only senior
on the bench.
So all four of the original mem
bers of the Stanford basketball
Class of 1999 stood heroically on the
Maples hardwood and watched the
scoreboard clock tick to zeroes for
the last time.
After that happened, it was time
to party.
Sauer was the first to jump on top

of the scorers table, an island in the
sea of humanity that spilled onto the
floor. The Mad Dog leapt into the
arms of adoring fans and surfed the
crowd. Moseley followed.
But after five minutes of "All
Right Now" and countless high
fives and hugs, it was time to head
for the ladder. Forty-five feet to the
left, the yellow ladder beckoned the
players and coaches to finalize this
long-awaited dream come true, to
climb and cut.
Montgomery waited patiently
and watched with a huge smile as his
players — the same 14 young men
who give him hours of blood, sweat
and tears in practice every day —
seized the moment.
Someone handed him a Pac-10
Champions hat. He threw it on, its
black bill behind his head.
And then finally it was his turn to

climb the ladder and cut the final
strands of twine. Montgomery
reached the rim, grabbed the scis
sors and severed the remaining two
strands, the precious symbol of vic
tory falling into his hands.
Then, with a huge grin, Mont
gomery raised the net high over his
head for the adoring fans. Finally,
he lowered it over his neck and gave
the crowd a thumbs up.
At that moment, Montgomery
was not the mastermind that has
brought Stanford so far in 13 sea
sons.
He was not the quiet, classy
leader of the Cardinal that some
times looks more like a professor
than a basketball coach.
He was just another fan, without
a care in the world, enjoying one of
the most exhilarating moments in
the history of Stanford basketball.
Dreams came true on Saturday

Chills ran up and down spines.

Thirty-seven ticks away from the

of his final game at Maples. Tim
Young had fouled out several min

on the bench.
So all four of the original mem
bers of the Stanford basketball
Class of 1999 stood heroically on the
Maples hardwood and watched the
scoreboard clock tick to zeroes for
the last time.
After that happened, it was time
to party.
Sauer was the first to jump on top

of the scorers table, an island in the
sea of humanity that spilled onto the
floor. The Mad Dog leapt into the
arms of adoring fans and surfed the
crowd. Moseley followed.
But after five minutes of "All
Right Now" and countless high
fives and hugs, it was time to head
for the ladder. Forty-five feet to the
left, the yellow ladder beckoned the
players and coaches to finalize this
long-awaited dream come true, to
climb and cut.
Montgomery waited patiently
and watched with a huge smile as his
players — the same 14 young men
who give him hours of blood, sweat
and tears in practice every day —
seized the moment.
Someone handed him a Pac-10
Champions hat. He threw it on, its
black bill behind his head.
And then finally it was his turn to

climb the ladder and cut the final
strands of twine. Montgomery
reached the rim, grabbed the scis
sors and severed the remaining two
strands, the precious symbol of vic
tory falling into his hands.
Then, with a huge grin, Mont
gomery raised the net high over his
head for the adoring fans. Finally,
he lowered it over his neck and gave
the crowd a thumbs up.
At that moment, Montgomery
was not the mastermind that has
brought Stanford so far in 13 sea
sons.
He was not the quiet, classy
leader of the Cardinal that some
times looks more like a professor
than a basketball coach.
He was just another fan, without
a care in the world, enjoying one of
the most exhilarating moments in
the history of Stanford basketball.
Dreams came true on Saturday
night at Maples Pavilion.
Chills ran up and down spines.
Faces caked in red paint smiled
until they hurt.
Hundreds of students rushed
the floor and created a human wave
machine, upon which Mark Mad
sen and David Moseley took a ride.
And Mike Montgomery, the dis
tinguished, stoic head coach of the
Stanford men's basketball team,
traded in his suit and tie for a back
wards baseball cap and a new form
of neckwear — the net.

■ Saturday: No. 6 Stanford (24-5.14-
2 Pacific 10 Conference) 98, No. 7
Arizona (20-6, 11-5) 83.

These displays of unbridled
emotion were the final touches on
an absolutely perfect night.
The No. 6 Cardinal had just
clinched its first-ever Pacific 10
Conference title with a 98-83
thrashing of Arizona on Senior
Night at Maples.
Stanford fans had long hoped it
would he like this, and when their
wishes were finally realized, it was
almost too much to handle.
Before the game, the Maples
faithful had witnessed a moving
ceremony to honor the greatest
graduating class in the program's
history. Players fought hack tears
■as they carried flowers to their par
ents at midcourt.

Club and was welcomed to the

floor with a rendition of "Happy
Birthday."
But Montgomery will long re
member the day he turned 52 by the
ultimately sweet gift his players
gave him on the floor.
"It's been a long time coming,"
Montgomery said. "I want to enjoy
this. Hey, they were having some
fun [after the game], and they de
served it.
'if you could write a script, this is
about as well as we could have
done."
In the wake of the biggest emo
tional roller coaster ride of his
young life, senior point guard
Arthur Lee had that look of disbe
lief in his eyes — the very same
glassy look that came over him after
the two-minute stretch against
Rhode Island when he scored 13
points and carried Stanford to the
Final Four.
"This is the best feeling I've ever
experienced," Lee said. When
asked if he was sure last night was
better than the Final Four, Lee was
quick to answer — and he was un
derstood, loud and clear.
"They are two different entities,"
Lee clarified. "But to do this here
tonight on Senior Night, in front of
our fans with our families here ... I
can't even describe it with words."
Heading into the game, no one
was quite sure how this unparalleled
level of emotion and nostalgia
would affect the play itself.
"I was emotional before the
game," Lee said. "I was emotional
when the game started. It was tough
for me to stay composed for the
opening tip."
From the second the game start
ed, however, it was clear that the
Cardinal (24-5, 14-2 Pac-10) would
channel all its emotion into positive
energy.
Stanford, which has struggled all
year long in the first half, sprinted
out to a 2()-point lead.
The Cardinal's backcourt duo of
Lee and Kris Weems were obvious
ly ready to make a statement to All-
America candidate Jason Terry,
whose last-second shot defeated
Stanford in Tucson.
"I just wanted to make sure I
didn't cry (before the game],"
Weems said. "And I didn't."
Instead, Weems came out and
torched No. 7 Arizona (20-6, 11-5)
for 17 first-half points, hitting 5 of 7
three-pointers.
With his fourth trifecta of the

half, Weems put Stanford ahead 37-
17. But Terry sparked 17-6 run to
end the half and draw Arizona with
in nine at the intermission.
Terry, who scored 29 against the
Cardinal in Tucson, looked to be
heating up as the teams headed into
the locker rooms.
Lee and Weems had other ideas.
The guard tandem put the defensive
clamps down on Terry in the second
half and held him to 7-of-29 shoot
ing from the field for the game.
"We played our best team de
fense of the season tonight," Lee
said. "Wc were thinking about pay

back all week long. Jason Ferry is a
catalyst in their offense, to say the
least. But we picked up the defen
sive intensity tonight."
Stanford's guard play was a defi
nite key to victory, which was in
credibly fortunate considering the
foul trouble that plagued its normal
ly-dominant frontcourt.
Starters Tim Young and Mark
Madsen both picked up two fouls
early, bringing sophomore Jarron
Collins and senior Mark Seaton off
the bench. When Collins picked up

a pair of quick fouls, though, it
looked as if the Widcats big men, led
by senior center A.J. Bramlett,
would dominate inside.
But forward Michael Wright,
one of the premier freshmen in the
nation, was in even more severe foul
trouble and played just six minutes
all night.
And the shots just kept on falling
for Stanford. The Cardinal shot 54
percent from the field on the night,
nailing 48 percent from beyond the
three-point arc.
