Continued encounters with Iraq suggest real U.S. strategy
WASHINGTON (AP) — Almost daily for the past two months, American and
British warplanes have hammered Iraq with missiles and bombs in a low-grade war of
attrition that the Clinton administration insists is nothing more than dutiful enforcement
of no-fly /ones protecting minority Iraqis in the north and south.
It is more than that, though. It is an avenue toward the administration's goal of replac
ing President Saddam Hussein as Iraq's leader. The bombings, U.S. officials hope, can
encourage internal unrest by portraying Saddam as hapless and cornered, unable to
defend his own territory and a danger to his own people.
Putting the onus on Hussein, President Clinton says the Iraqi leader can end hostilities
by cooperating with the United Nations. Clinton recently referred to the attacks on Iraq
as "these little encounters," which include one incident in which an errant Air Force mis
sile killed at least 11 Iraqi civilians.
While regularly talking down Hussein and talking up their Iraq strategy, administra
tion officials have had notably little to say about exactly what the nearly daily missile
attacks are achieving — or not achieving.
"We intend to keep pressure on Saddam Hussein: political, economic, military, any
way that we can," said Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and President Clinton's top military adviser.
Children not hurt by working mothers
WASHINGTON (AP) — Children of women who work outside the home are not sig
nificantly harmed by their mother's absence, according to a study that evaluated the
development and health of more than 6,(XX) youngsters.
The study, conducted by Elizabeth Harvey, a psychologist at the University of Mas
sachusetts, and published in the March issue of the journal Developmental Psychology,
came to a different conclusion than some earlier studies of the same group of children.
The new work examined the children at a later age, 12 years old.
This suggests, said David Eggebeen of Pennsylvania State University, who co
authored an earlier study, that problems detected in children of working mothers at age
3 and 4 may have gone away by the time the children were 12.
Harvey used standard psychological tests to evaluate children's language develop
ment. academic achievement, self-esteem and behavior problems. Some of the results
were based on reports of the parents.
CIA changes tactics in fighting terrorism
WASHINGTON (AP) — Frustrated by restrictions on using military force against
terrorists, the United States is turning to a lower-profile tactic.
The CIA calls it "disruption" — working with foreign law-enforcement services to
harass and hamper terrorists around the world before they can succussefully pull off
major attacks.
Least well known of counter-terrorist weapons, disruption involves using new or long
established clandestine alliances with foreign intelligence and law-enforcement services in
the tracking down, breaking up and knocking over of international terrorist cells.
There are no headlines when the job is done — and no fingerprints.
The CIA keeps its role secret, and the foreign countries that actually crack down on
the suspects carefully hide the U.S. role, lest they stir up political trouble for themselves.
