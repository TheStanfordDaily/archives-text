# Lebanese bombing kills Israelis

MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP)-
Lebanese guerillas detonated two bombs
beside a military convoy yesterday, killing
a brigadier general and three other Israelis
in one of the most serious attacks on
Israel's forces in southern Lebanon.
Israeli warplanes retaliated after the
bombing, firing missiles at suspected guer
rilla hideouts in southern and eastern
Lebanon, Lebanese security officials said.
There was no immediate word on casual
ties from the air raid, the second in south
Lebanon in as many days.
Brig. Gen. Erez Gerstein was the high
est-ranking officer to die in Lebanon since
the 1982 Israeli invasion. His vehicle,
described by area residents as an armor
plated Mercedes, careened off the road,
rolled into the valley below and burst into
flames.
Two Israeli sergeants and an Israel
Radio reporter, all of whom were in Ger
stein's vehicle, also were killed.
Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese

gi'.'rrjUa group, claimed responsibility for
the ditack. It came five days after another
south Lebanon ambush killed three Israeli
army officers, prompting renewed calls for
Israel to pull troops out of Lebanon.
Israel occupied part of Lebanon in 1985
to prevent cross-border attacks, setting up
a so-called "security zone" that covers
about one-tenth of Lebanon. Hezbollah is
the most active of the guerrilla groups
fighting to oust the Israelis and their militia
allies.
Speaking after yesterday's attack,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu called Lebanon "an acute
problem."
"It's one that awaits a solution. Israel
knows what to do," he said in Amman, Jor
dan, where he was meeting that nation's
new ruler. King Abdullah.
In announcing yesterday's retaliatory
attacks, Israeli chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Shaul
Mofaz said Israel adhered to a three-year
understanding with the Hezbollah to avoid

civilian targets.
However, Netanyahu hinted that
Israel's action, which would include land
and sea forces, might eventually end the
agreement. He accused the Iranian backed
militia of "systematically" violating the
agreement.
Netanyahu already faces a tough battle
for re-election before a vote May 17. Top
campaign issues include whether, when
and how to withdraw troops from
Lebanon.
More than 900 Israeli soldiers have died
since 1982. As many as 25,000 Lebanese
and Palestinians have been killed during
the same period, according to Lebanese
officials and international relief agencies.
If Netanyahu fails to react strongly to
the killings of Israeli troops in the past
week, he risks appearing weak when he is
seeking to portray himself as the toughest
of the candidates.
But strong retaliation could become
bogged down in an unpopular mini-war.
