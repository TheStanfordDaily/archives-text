# Nigeria holds contentious election

ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian pres
idential candidate Olu Falae plans to con
test the results of Saturday's elections, a top
aide said yesterday, casting a shadow over
the vote billed as a chance to bring democ
racy back to Africa's most-populous coun
try.
The presidential election, only the third
in Nigerian history, was "completely
rigged," said the aide, Sunday Durodola,
who is also the party secretary for Falae's
Alliance for Democracy.
"We have not had a free and fair elec
tion, and Falae will contest this," Durodola
said in a telephone interview from Lagos,
Nigeria's commercial capital.
The surprise announcement came as
Nigerian election officials announced that
Falae's opponent, retired Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo, a former military ruler seeking a
civilian comeback 20 years after leaving
power, had pulled further into the lead.

By yesterday evening, Obasanjo had
captured 61 percent of the vote with 29 of
Nigeria's 36 states and the federal capital
reporting.
An official of the All Peoples Party inter
rupted a news conference at Nigeria's Inde
pendent National Electoral Commission to
denounce the results.
"We cannot be bound by the results
released thus far," said Ayo Opakun,
Falae's campaign director.
The announcements from Falae's camp
followed reports by international observers
of ballot box-stuffing and other serious vot
ing irregularities.
Falae and top officials in his party, as well
as the All Peoples Party that also backed his
candidacy, headed to the capital city. Abuja,
to meet with election officials, Durodola
said.
A refusal to recognize the outcome by
one of the two presidential candidates

would taint the vote, though election offi
cials said they would continue to count the
ballots.
Obasanjo, who voluntarily stepped down
from power in 1979, is widely disliked by
many southern Nigerians — including
Falae's supporters — because of his military
past.
Falae reportedly told journalists on Sat
urday that he would accept the results of the
election if they were free and fair.
Ruled by a series of military leaders since
Shehu Shagari was overthrown in 1983,
Nigeria has been economically battered and
diplomatically isolated by its junta govern
ments.
Corruption and mismanagement have
cost the country billions of dollars of its mas
sive oil wealth, leaving much of Nigeria's
infrastructure crumbling, with electricity
and water service largely unknown in many
cities.
