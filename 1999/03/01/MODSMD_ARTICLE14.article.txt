BEIJING (AP) â€” Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in China yester
day planning to deliver a strong rebuke for
China's "deplorable pattern" of cracking
down on political dissent.
State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin suggested lack of improvement by
China on human rights and other irritants
could impede progress on Albright's prima
ry mission, to negotiate with Premier Zhu
Rongji terms for joining the World Trade
Organization. The goal is to admit China in
time for Zhu's trip to Washington in April.
"She will be explaining to the Chinese
and to Zhu Rongji specifically that if he and
the Chinese want their trip to be a success
..., it's got to go beyond economic issues,"
Rubin said.
Rubin dismissed the idea, however, that
differences over human rights, Taiwan,
trade and new disputes over high technolo
gy have created a crisis in the U.S.-China
relationship.
"We recognize there are a lot of events
that are converging at this very moment, but
we don't see them as linked and we don't
see them as a crisis," he said. "We see them
as hurdles that we obviously will need to
overcome."
Albright is meeting todav with Zhu, Vice

Premier Qian Qichen and Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan. Tomorrow, she plans to see
President Jiang Zemin before heading to
Thailand and then Indonesia during her
weeklong trip.
In Beijing, Albright will make clear that
human rights is among the top U.S. prob
lems with China's conduct, Rubin said. The
State Department's annual human rights
report, issued Friday, condemned China for
jailing dissidents for trying to form a demo
cratic political party.
"Secretary Albright will do what she
always does, and that is tell it like it is on the
subject of human rights," Rubin said.
"There has been an unfortunate deplorable
pattern of crackdowns on political dissent."
Chinese dissidents canceled a meeting on
human rights set to begin today because
organizers were in detention and police pre
vented others from attending, said Zha
Jianguo, a member of the banned China
Democracy Party in Beijing.
In a crackdown that began last year,
three leading members of the illegal opposi
tion party were convicted of subversion and
sentenced to prison terms of 11 to 13 years.
Still, the Clinton administration has not
decided whether to sponsor a resolution
condemning China at this spring's IJ.N.

Human Rights Commission meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland.
On another contentious subject,
Albright will urge China to avoid increasing
tensions with Taiwan, which it considers a
renegade province. Rubin said.
A new Pentagon report estimates Bei
jing may have by 2(X)5 the capability to
launch effective air and missile strikes
against the island. China already has more
than 1(X) ballistic missiles pointed at Taiwan
and has never renounced the use of force to
regain the territory, although the Pentagon
didn't predict a Chinese attack.
China strongly objects to U.S. proposals
to develop a missile defense system in the
region, which Taiwan wants to use as pro
tection.
On trade, Albright said she is trying to
engage in "serious discussions" about China
joining the WTO. Rubin said she was look
ing for a clear signal from Chinese officials
on "whether they have newfound flexibili
ty"
Joining the WTO would give China low
tariff access to export markets and protect it
from sanctions. The United States wants
Beijing first to lower more of its tariffs on
goods and get rid of other trade barriers so
that it doesn't have a big advantage.
