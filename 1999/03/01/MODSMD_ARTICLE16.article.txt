Tom Wolfe's time at
Stanford could bring
new revelations

ITS USUALLY BENEFICIAL
to have people with big names
and bigciout visit the University,
but Tom Wolfe is a special case.
The acclaimed author of "The
Right Stuff," "The Bonfire of the
Vanities" and most recently, "A Man
in Full," is an undoubtedly influen
tial figure in the world of contempo
rary literature. Usually clad in a
white suit that makes him instantly
indentifiable, Wolfe cannot help but
make his presence felt next quarter
at Stanford.
However, the most characteristic
feature of Wolfe's recent work has
been a scathing indictment of what
ever he chooses to write about.
Comparing himself with the 19th

century Frcnch novelist Emile Zola,
who actively sought out life experi
ences to write about, Wolfe has
taken Zola's blend of social com
mentary, journalism and literature to
a new level.
Having Wolfe on campus has the
potential to affect a real change at
Stanford. Considering Wolfe's
shredding of societies from New
York to Atlanta, we are left to won
der what he will uncover while here.
In interviews, Wolfe has hinted
that the subject for his next book will
be education or academia. With
change being the purpose of much of
Wolfe's work, his sojourn at Stan
ford has the possibility of sgnificant
ly altering how the world looks at
this campus and possibly many other
universities around the country.
Why Wolfe chose to visit Stanford
remains a mystery, but an even big
ger question is: What he will find out
about us?
