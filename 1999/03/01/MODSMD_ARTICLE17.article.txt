Hoover's decision to
appoint ex-governor
raises questions

PETE WILSON'S appointment
as a distinguished visiting fellow
has the potential to bring far
more confliet to the University than
meaningful scholarship to the Hoover
Institution.
The recent efforts of Hoover to
move toward a more policy-oriented
research fellowship appear to directly
contradict the appointment of Wilson,
who certainly carries a big name hut
does not have a reputation as a
renowned policy expert.

While we cannot predict the quality
of Wilsons scholarship during his stay
at the institution, it appears as though
he is making Hoover a refueling stop
in his grander plans for political office.
As a world-class policy research
institute in its own right, we feel that
Hoover should not have to concern
itself with luring big-name politicians.
In addition, Wilson invites conflict
at Stanford. His stance in favor of Cal
ifornia's recent anti-affirmative action
ballot initiative, Proposition 209, as
well as his controversial record with
immigration issues in California, have
the potential to bring discord to the
University.
The Hoover Institution can do bet
ter.
