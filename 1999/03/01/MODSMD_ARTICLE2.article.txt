## Local, national groups fight law tying funding to military recruiting

Editor's note: Part two of a two-part series
on military recruiting at law schools. Friday:
Recruiting at Stanford. Today: National re
form efforts.
The 162 institutions belonging to the
American Association of Law Schools, in
cluding Stanford, have pledged to bar from
campus employment recruiters who dis
criminate by sexual orientation.
Students at these same institutions re
ceive millions of dollars in Perkin's loans
and work-study annually, aid which is tied
to a congressional demand to allow the mil
itary to recruit on campus.
These two policies conflict, because the
military, which will not hire openly gay in
dividuals, violates the nondiscrimination
policies of the law schools. Thus law schools
are forced to choose between their nondis
crimination policies and aid for their stu
dents.
The policy "forces schools to pick be
tween two disadvantaged groups: those
who are denied career opportunities solely
on the basis of sexual orientation and those
who depend on financial aid to pursue a
professional education," said Stanford Law
Prof. Deborah Rhode, former president of
the American Association of Law Schools.
As detailed in Friday's article, Stanford

Law School has used a number of different
tactics to avoid making a direct decision.
But Stanford is not alone in its attempts to
subvert the linkage of aid to military re
cruitment. a linkage spelled out in congres
sional legislation known as the Solomon
Amendment.
In addition to localized efforts at schools
like Stanford, various organizations and
political leaders are conducting a national
campaign to repeal all or part of the amend
ment.
Localized efforts
As at Stanford, most law schools have to
face the direct dilemma of how to react to
the congressionally-mandated imposition
of military recruiters.
Few law schools have come out in direct
defiance of the amendment, which was
adopted in 19%. One of the few that has is
New York University Law School. The
school, which has outright refused to allow
military recruiters on campus, has not had
its federal funding adversely affected, ac
cording to the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion.
Most law schools have taken the middle
road, however, allowing some measure of
military recruiting on campus but making
clear their displeasure and taking compen
satory actions to support gay and lesbian
students.
Harvard Law School, for example, will
allow the recruiters on campus but will not
allow them the use of its career develop
ment center.
At Stanford, the Law School has adopt
ed a policy that requires a minimum level of

student interest before allowing recruiters
to interview on its facilities.
According to Law School Dean Paul
Brest, "we simply haven't had the interest,"
and thus military recruiters have been
turned away without the school invoking
the nondiscrimination policy.
The American Association of Law
Schools, which claims about 90 percent of

American law schools as
members, allows schools
to make exceptions to its
nondiscrimination poli
cy to comply with the
amendment. But it urges
schools that do so "to be
sensitive to the need for
creative and effective
amelioration strate-

gies," including posting signs and letters
that state that the schools do not condone
the military's policy and supportinggay and
lesbian forums and student groups.
Political remedies
Reps. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) and
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) are proposing an
amendment that would repeal the portion
of the amendment that denies financial aid
to schools that bar military recruiting on
campus.
"A student ought not be denied financial
assistance just because of the military's pol
icy," said Campbell, a Stanford law profes
sor.
