## Local, national groups fight law tying funding to military recruiting

Recruiting at Stanford. Today: National re
form efforts.
The 162 institutions belonging to the
American Association of Law Schools, in
cluding Stanford, have pledged to bar from
campus employment recruiters who dis
criminate by sexual orientation.
Students at these same institutions re
ceive millions of dollars in Perkin's loans
and work-study annually, aid which is tied
to a congressional demand to allow the mil
itary to recruit on campus.
These two policies conflict, because the
military, which will not hire openly gay in
dividuals, violates the nondiscrimination
policies of the law schools. Thus law schools
are forced to choose between their nondis
crimination policies and aid for their stu
dents.
The policy "forces schools to pick be
tween two disadvantaged groups: those
who are denied career opportunities solely
on the basis of sexual orientation and those
who depend on financial aid to pursue a
professional education," said Stanford Law
Prof. Deborah Rhode, former president of
the American Association of Law Schools.
As detailed in Friday's article, Stanford

Law School has used a number of different
tactics to avoid making a direct decision.
But Stanford is not alone in its attempts to
subvert the linkage of aid to military re
cruitment. a linkage spelled out in congres
sional legislation known as the Solomon
Amendment.
In addition to localized efforts at schools
like Stanford, various organizations and
political leaders are conducting a national
campaign to repeal all or part of the amend
ment.
Localized efforts
As at Stanford, most law schools have to
face the direct dilemma of how to react to
the congressionally-mandated imposition
of military recruiters.
Few law schools have come out in direct
defiance of the amendment, which was
adopted in 19%. One of the few that has is
New York University Law School. The
school, which has outright refused to allow
military recruiters on campus, has not had
its federal funding adversely affected, ac
cording to the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion.
Most law schools have taken the middle
road, however, allowing some measure of
military recruiting on campus but making
clear their displeasure and taking compen
satory actions to support gay and lesbian
students.
Harvard Law School, for example, will
allow the recruiters on campus but will not
allow them the use of its career develop
ment center.
At Stanford, the Law School has adopt
ed a policy that requires a minimum level of

student interest before allowing recruiters
to interview on its facilities.
According to Law School Dean Paul
Brest, "we simply haven't had the interest,"
and thus military recruiters have been
turned away without the school invoking
the nondiscrimination policy.
The American Association of Law
Schools, which claims about 90 percent of

American law schools as
members, allows schools
to make exceptions to its
nondiscrimination poli
cy to comply with the
amendment. But it urges
schools that do so "to be
sensitive to the need for
creative and effective
amelioration strate-

gies," including posting signs and letters
that state that the schools do not condone
the military's policy and supportinggay and
lesbian forums and student groups.
Political remedies
Reps. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) and
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) are proposing an
amendment that would repeal the portion
of the amendment that denies financial aid
to schools that bar military recruiting on
campus.
"A student ought not be denied financial
assistance just because of the military's pol
icy," said Campbell, a Stanford law profes
sor.
Alan Drexel, former president of Out
law, Stanford Law Students for Lesbian,


Campbell
Gay and Bisexual Equality, agreed
that "we were making victims of stu
dents that happened to attend insti
tutions that took a principled
stand."
The Campbell-Frank Amend
ment would allow for the return of
the financial aid portion of the fed
eral funding for schools that turn
away military recruiters but would
leave in place other restrictions.
Universities that turn away the mili
tary would continue to be denied
non-financial aid funding like De
fense Department grants.
"One can argue more persuasive
ly that if the Stanford Physics De
partment wants to accept funding, it
has to allow recruiting, but you can't
make the same argument for stu
dent financial aid," Campbell said.
By taking this middle approach,
the amendment is, in Campbell's
words, "a rifle shot rather than an as
sault weapon."
Campbell has high hopes for the
amendment, which will be intro
duced with the Defense Depart
ment Authorization bill next month.
"I've been talking to a number of
moderate Republicans, and there's
a lot of support out there, because
this supports universities," Camp
bell said.
()n-campus activism
Students and faculty around the
country are taking an active ap

proach in support of congressional
efforts to overturn the Solomon
Amendment, from filing lawsuits to
bringing in speakers to sending let
ters.
"The success of such legislation is
likely to depend on the legal profes
sion's ability to inspire broad-based
support from within and without the
bar," Rhode said.
Some faculty and students, of
course, disagree with the American
Association of Law Schools and
other groups' objection to the
Solomon Amendment. Oklahoma
City University Law Prof. Dennis
Arrow called the association a "mi
nority faction emanating from small
and inbred communities, the party
line types [who] have expressed out
rage that Congress might be so bold
as to overrule a cherished AALS
regulation."
He argued that it is more wrong
for the association to insist that
schools not allow discriminatory re
cruiters than it is for the government
to insist that military recruiters have
access to campuses.
Despite assertions like Arrow's,
protest against the Solomon
Amendment has been strong.
Last month, three student groups
at the I Jniversity of Vermont filed a
lawsuit to overturn the restrictions
imposed by the Solomon Amend
ment. The lawsuit argues that the
University of Vermont, which like
Stanford Law School prohibits dis
criminatory recruiters on campus,
should not be forced to host military
recruiters.

In addition, more than 100 law
professors have signed on to a na
tional letter-writing campaign to
support the Solomon Amendment's
repeal, according to the Chronicle of
Higher Education.
At Stanford, Outlaw has orga
nized a number of events to protest
the government's military recruit
ment mandates. It invited Frank, a
strong gav-rights supporter, to speak
in October. Frank's speech called
for the repeal of the Solomon
Amendment.
"We elevated this issue for Bar
ney, and he issued us a call to ac
tion," Drexel said.
In response to Frank's call for po
litical activism, Outlaw drafted sev
eral letters to congressmen con
demning the Solomon Amendment.
The letters state that "the Solomon
Amendment is misguided and con
flicts with America's basic commit
ment to equality of opportunity for
all citizens" and promise to support
members of Congress who back the
amendment's repeal.
Outlaw held a "bake sale for jus
tice" in February, which combined
cookie-buying and letter-sending.
According to Drexel, the effort re
sulted in the sending of more than 60
letters.
Drexel plans to post the letters on
Outlaw's Web site in the hopes that
other organizations at other univer
sities will follow Stanford's lead.
According to Rhode, such letters
are "critical" to successfully disasso
ciating financial aid and military re
cruiting.

campaign to repeal all or part of the amend
ment.
Localized efforts
As at Stanford, most law schools have to
face the direct dilemma of how to react to
the congressionally-mandated imposition
of military recruiters.
Few law schools have come out in direct
defiance of the amendment, which was
adopted in 19%. One of the few that has is
New York University Law School. The
school, which has outright refused to allow
military recruiters on campus, has not had
its federal funding adversely affected, ac
cording to the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion.
Most law schools have taken the middle
road, however, allowing some measure of
military recruiting on campus but making
clear their displeasure and taking compen
satory actions to support gay and lesbian
students.
Harvard Law School, for example, will
allow the recruiters on campus but will not
allow them the use of its career develop
ment center.
At Stanford, the Law School has adopt
ed a policy that requires a minimum level of

student interest before allowing recruiters
to interview on its facilities.
According to Law School Dean Paul
Brest, "we simply haven't had the interest,"
and thus military recruiters have been
turned away without the school invoking
the nondiscrimination policy.
The American Association of Law
Schools, which claims about 90 percent of

American law schools as
members, allows schools
to make exceptions to its
nondiscrimination poli
cy to comply with the
amendment. But it urges
schools that do so "to be
sensitive to the need for
creative and effective
amelioration strate-

gies," including posting signs and letters
that state that the schools do not condone
the military's policy and supportinggay and
lesbian forums and student groups.
Political remedies
Reps. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) and
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) are proposing an
amendment that would repeal the portion
of the amendment that denies financial aid
to schools that bar military recruiting on
campus.
"A student ought not be denied financial
assistance just because of the military's pol
icy," said Campbell, a Stanford law profes
sor.
Alan Drexel, former president of Out
law, Stanford Law Students for Lesbian,


Campbell
Gay and Bisexual Equality, agreed
that "we were making victims of stu
dents that happened to attend insti
tutions that took a principled
stand."
The Campbell-Frank Amend
ment would allow for the return of
the financial aid portion of the fed
eral funding for schools that turn
away military recruiters but would
leave in place other restrictions.
Universities that turn away the mili
tary would continue to be denied
non-financial aid funding like De
fense Department grants.
"One can argue more persuasive
ly that if the Stanford Physics De
partment wants to accept funding, it
has to allow recruiting, but you can't
make the same argument for stu
dent financial aid," Campbell said.
By taking this middle approach,
the amendment is, in Campbell's
words, "a rifle shot rather than an as
sault weapon."
Campbell has high hopes for the
amendment, which will be intro
duced with the Defense Depart
ment Authorization bill next month.
"I've been talking to a number of
moderate Republicans, and there's
a lot of support out there, because
this supports universities," Camp
bell said.
()n-campus activism
Students and faculty around the
country are taking an active ap

proach in support of congressional
efforts to overturn the Solomon
Amendment, from filing lawsuits to
bringing in speakers to sending let
ters.
"The success of such legislation is
likely to depend on the legal profes
sion's ability to inspire broad-based
support from within and without the
bar," Rhode said.
Some faculty and students, of
course, disagree with the American
Association of Law Schools and
other groups' objection to the
Solomon Amendment. Oklahoma
City University Law Prof. Dennis
Arrow called the association a "mi
nority faction emanating from small
and inbred communities, the party
line types [who] have expressed out
rage that Congress might be so bold
as to overrule a cherished AALS
regulation."
He argued that it is more wrong
for the association to insist that
schools not allow discriminatory re
cruiters than it is for the government
to insist that military recruiters have
access to campuses.
Despite assertions like Arrow's,
protest against the Solomon
Amendment has been strong.
Last month, three student groups
at the I Jniversity of Vermont filed a
lawsuit to overturn the restrictions
imposed by the Solomon Amend
ment. The lawsuit argues that the
University of Vermont, which like
Stanford Law School prohibits dis
criminatory recruiters on campus,
should not be forced to host military
recruiters.

In addition, more than 100 law
professors have signed on to a na
tional letter-writing campaign to
support the Solomon Amendment's
repeal, according to the Chronicle of
Higher Education.
At Stanford, Outlaw has orga
nized a number of events to protest
the government's military recruit
ment mandates. It invited Frank, a
strong gav-rights supporter, to speak
in October. Frank's speech called
for the repeal of the Solomon
Amendment.
"We elevated this issue for Bar
ney, and he issued us a call to ac
tion," Drexel said.
In response to Frank's call for po
litical activism, Outlaw drafted sev
eral letters to congressmen con
demning the Solomon Amendment.
The letters state that "the Solomon
Amendment is misguided and con
flicts with America's basic commit
ment to equality of opportunity for
all citizens" and promise to support
members of Congress who back the
amendment's repeal.
Outlaw held a "bake sale for jus
tice" in February, which combined
cookie-buying and letter-sending.
According to Drexel, the effort re
sulted in the sending of more than 60
letters.
Drexel plans to post the letters on
Outlaw's Web site in the hopes that
other organizations at other univer
sities will follow Stanford's lead.
According to Rhode, such letters
are "critical" to successfully disasso
ciating financial aid and military re
cruiting.
