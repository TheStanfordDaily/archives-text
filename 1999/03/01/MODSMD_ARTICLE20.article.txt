## Mari Webel Confronting the fear of flying 
### 
SOMETIME during the third week of
June in 2000, after hopefully graduat
ing from Stanford and a road trip back
to my home in southern Illinois, I am going
to be the best man in my best friend's wed
ding.
It's great, but it's terrifying. I haven't
decided whether to wear a tux or a conser
vative dress. My friend and I shopped for
the ring just two days before his 21st birth
day. He spent a chunk of change on a really
pretty piece of jewelry, and now he's
betrothed. In the meantime, I have to finish
college, and I think I have to throw a bach
elor party.
So, marriage. Whether you were told not
to marry young or that you'd just know
when you met the right one, or if you're a
child of divorce and scared of commitment,
marriage is a specter that looms ever closer
as we are forced more tangibly into the real
world.
Get used to it — from here on out,
they'll be dropping like flies.
I used to think it'd be cool to live with
someone over the summer, maybe think
more seriously about a life together and fig
ure "it" out sometime after graduation. I
would get to go grocery shopping and brush
my teeth with someone and then come
September, move back to my Stanford
world and be "independent" again.
But I'm having second thoughts. The
inherent tension between retaining inde
pendence and entering the real world is
frighteningly apparent to me.
We are all so eager to get out there, live
grown-up lives and be taken seriously that
we are jumping into Big Adult Things. They

legitimize our intentions and make real our
desires to vigorously begin life after college.
Sharing rent is sometimes economically rea
sonable, therefore a Big Adult Thing. Liv
ing with someone equals taking yourself
and your relationship seriously, right? It's a
commitment, it's giving up a degree of inde
pendence. but is it bad or good?
We reach a sort of crossroads, wherein
signing up for Big Adult Things means
implictly signing away our youthful twenty
something independence. It seems we can
only go one of two ways, and our alterna
tives are erased at the moment of decision.
Independence is something that we hang on
to the most.
In college, we find ourselves mostly free
of parental supervision, can choose our
vocations according to what classes excite
us in a given quarter and, in the most obvi
ous manifestation, can drink ourselves into
oblivion on a Friday night and suffer
through our post-frat party hangovers in
private misery.
Restrictions, apart from the bigger ones
like "declare before you're a junior" and
"obey the Honor Code" are self-imposed.
Anything that compromises those freedoms
is fiercely resisted.
We cling to our independence, but decid
ing whether to follow the impulse to hold on
for dear lite is difficult. Clinging can be a
hindrance to the things we can learn the
most from, although the fear of getting
burned is a reasonable one.
In a sense, we want it all. We want to
exercise free will; we want to love and be
loved; and we want to eventually have the
responsibilities that will lead us beyond col

lege life — but we don't want to be forced
into any decisions.
But independent doesn't have to mean
alone. Likewise, the bond you find, wherev
er you find it, doesn't mean relinquishing
your sense of self. We gain strength and
confidence through other people, or, if we
choose to be more solitary, through the
things we learn in observing human interac
tions.
Some choices force us to relinquish the
independence we are lucky enough to have
as college students — that management
consulting job with the 40-hour work week,
for instance. Financial stability comes with a
price — you can forget about waking up
late enough to have lunch food for break
fast.
But instead of theoretically gluing your
self to someone for a summer, why not
learn how to lean without the fear of falling,
or how to give yourself over to something or
someone without losing yourself?
We have this amazing power to affect
each other. It's total cheese, but people are
fascinating.
Human nature is a captivating and prob
lematic, inexplicable phenomenon, regard
less of the inroads psychology has made to
unravel it.
Life after college should be about mak
ing the most of the connections we find,
independent or not.

Mart Webel would like to apologize to her
more serious-thinking friends and still wants
to come to The Wedding in Mem Chu in
October of2ooo. She welcomes any sugges
tions for an appropriate best man's speech.
