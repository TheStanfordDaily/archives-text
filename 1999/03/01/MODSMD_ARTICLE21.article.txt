Community voices concerns over land use issues

Many Stanford campus residents are up
in arms because the University is proposing
to add about 36 additional faculty housing
units in residential "infill" areas of campus.
Like many others, I bought my campus
home in the early 19705, financed on easy
terms by the University and through dumb
good fortune have seen its value increase 12
or 15 times. If I were to be hired today,
there is no way that I could afford to live
here, and I suppose the same is true of many
others.
About a third of campus homes, like
mine, are occupied by retirees. One of the
few things we seem to have in common is
that we expect to live forever, occupying
our lovely campus homes and compounding
the difficulty of newcomers to find houses
on campus.
We all know that there is a dreadful
housing crunch in this area, and we all know
that the University must attract young fac
ulty. but it seems we don't all know how to
share.
I never heard anyone complain when the
University paid tuition for our kids to go to
college. I never heard anyone complain
because the University gives emeriti profes
sors free "A" parking stickers for the rest of
our lives, or a lot of other benefits. Some
faculty and emeriti may think that simply

because we were here earlier we have some
exclusive right to such advantages, but the
fact is that we enjoy them because Stanford
is a class act.
Now that the University wants to add
about 3 percent to the number of housing
units on campus, some old-timers sing a
chorus of "Not in My Backyard," even
though the backyard belongs not to them
but to Stanford.
From the indignant breastbeating, you
would think that University President Ger
hard Casper had ordered us to share our
homes with a family of ragged refugees
from the war of our choice. But what he has
really asked from us is exactly nothing,
except a little tolerance.
The nostalgic ramblings vented in the
recent "town meeting" are not valid argu
ments against the legitimate needs of the
University and of our younger faculty. This
campus has tons of room to kick soccer
balls, and if it has a tiny bit less when the
new units are built, so what?
Our privileged paradise might even be
improved by the addition of a few more
young and forward-looking families, and
my wife and I will be delighted to welcome
them.
The attitude of many campus residents
who demand what they consider their enti

tlements while denying them to their own
junior colleagues is shameful and embar
rassing. Let the hammers sing!

In the Founding Grant, Leland and Jane
Stanford created an important standard
from which the University has not deviated:
its lands should not be sold. The letter of
this standard cannot be placed aside when
considering the construction of a new can
cer center at the Stanford Medical Center.
While the imagery of children walking
past a morgue to receive treatment in
cramped conditions at the current center
should alone be enough motivation to alter
some zoning restrictions, it is the idea of
Stanford getting tangled in such zoning
restrictions that bothers me.
Stanford land has not been sold but con
trol of it has, causing the land to lose value
as the surrounding area tightens the brakes
on any development, worthwhile or not.
Controversial issues like faculty and gradu
ate housing construction or Sand Hill Road
development are heavily debated on cam
pus. Faculty and students must overcome
many obstacles to force the administration

to make sure development plans address
their concerns. Once you throw in outside
interests, though, the already difficult devel
opment process grinds to a halt.
Opponents of the cancer center cite
responsible development as their motiva
tion. Land preservation and careful building
are worthwhile causes with many rewards.
Anyone who has seen the sprawl of cities in
Southern California can appreciate the
recreational reserves that lie between Stan
ford and San Francisco along Highway 280.
However, responsible development
hardly seems to be the real issue.' The Stan
ford campus extends into four cities and two
counties. In this specific case, Palo Alto res
idents are attempting to maintain control
over their piece of Stanford with a petty dis
play of zoning and permit power.
Allowing the surrounding area to dictate
the construction of facilities such as the can
cer center shifts the University's goal of
developing its land for educational purpos
es to developing it for the preservation of
Palo Alto home values. Neighboring cities
should step down in cases such as this and
respect the endowment that the Stanfords
carefully made over 1(K) years ago.
