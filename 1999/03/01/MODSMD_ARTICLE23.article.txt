# Where we are
## David Stein About the so-called 'Overseas Experience' 
### 
Travels never been big for
me. I've visited New York and Mexi
co several times, Las Vegas twice,
Japan for 10 days and various West Coast
beaches. 1 have never been to Europe,
Africa, South America, the Midwest or the
Middle East, the larger Asiatic land mass or
any Disney theme park outside of my home
state of California. And I'm OK with that.
But I know there are those who need
more. There are those who can't wait to
accumulate millions of frequent flyer miles,
acquire vaccines against rare tropical dis
eases and become eloquent postcard writers,
if such a thing exists. Fortunately for you. we
have the Overseas Studies Program.
Hey, wait! Overseas Studies is not just
some glamorized travel agency. Aside from
fulfilling its main goal of breaking up draw
groups during junior year, the program puts
together a fine array of classes and other edu
cational opportunities. It affords us quite an
Experience, you say.
In fact, most people who've gone to one
of the overseas campuses mention this very
sacred and mysterious Experience. They will
sav. "Ten weeks living with my Chilean fam

ily was quite an Experience," or "Stumbling
through the Oxford House piss-drunk on
Guinness and mistaking a telephone booth
for an attractive coed was quite an Experi
ence." They rarely explain what this Experi
ence actually meant or how it might have
changed them. They will usually just say the
word "Experience" in the same grave tone
with which you might hear grad students dis
cuss available housing. So. when you ask
them to elaborate on their trip, they give you
that dreaded you really had to be there look
and quickly leave the room.
But what is this Experience all about?
Does it have to do with the firm friendships
formed in those few hectic overseas weeks or
perhaps the academic passions it inspires?
Could be. I've witnessed how a few quarters
away from Stanford have given a student
renewed purpose, and this might be the one
great contribution Overseas Studies makes
to our community. 1 do know the Experience
doesn't have to do with the classes offered, as
a recent survey has shown that on a list of
what students hope to get out of going over
seas, attending classes ranks just below get
ting mugged.

What I think this Experience means for
students, aside from the obvious desire to
escape, is the hope for a new Perspective on
Life. They seem to seek Truth, Meaning,
Love and a Great Understanding of what we
call Human Nature — all the things ( ultures.
Ideas and Values promised us and didn't
deliver. In their journeys, they hope to dis
cover something wondrous about them
selves, and I know this because you've told
me.
Not all of you. but a rather vocal and pub
lic minority: former Daily columnists.
For the past three years, a significant
number of writers appearing in these pages
thought it would be —pardon my enthusi
asm — super-fun to write about their foreign
jaunts. They also thought it necessary to
describe for us everything they observed: the
taste of Parisian wines, the gentle slope of the
English countryside, the fetid contents of a
Moscow sewer. And from these portrayals of
the mundane, they seem to garner the most
profound conclusions, as the following exam
ple illustrates:
"I was walking beneath the Eiffel lower
when an old woman, a black shawl wrapped

around her face, whispered something unin
telligible to me. It was then that 1 knew that
youth would conquer all. that poverty is a
universal but amenable condition and that I
really should have paid more attention in
language lab."
This, of course, is an exaggeration, but the
general sentiment remains true. Regardless
of the situation or observation, virtually
every column sought some Higher Truth,
which, more often than nut. fell into one of
three categories: I) Everyone all over the
world suiters and strives the same, and that's
OK; 2) Everyone all over the world possess
es attributes native to their own culture, and
that's OK: and 3) Non-Americans have
lunnv expressions which we like to call
Idiomatic.
1 am not saying micro-observations can
not reveal something meaningful. But 1 am
saying that the columnists — and 1 would
suspect a lot of other overseas travelers —
treat the foreign countries with such undue
reverence, as il places outside this country
possess some all-powerful mirror that once
held up to nature allows us to glimpse the
mvsterv ol life.

There's nothing inherently special about
faraway lands. Aside from their novelty and
unique beauty these places probably offer no
special Experience which your own backyard
couldn't provide. Learning something about
yourself and your world doesn't require a
round-trip ticket. It does require depth of
character and attention to detail, and the last
time I checked, these two options weren't
offered by Overseas Studies.
William Faulkner, who rarely left his Mis
sissippi home, wrote that he could never
exhaust the life from his "postage stamp of
native soil" and thus concentrated his ener
gies not on leaving but on staying put. Unless
there's an overwhelming reason to go over
seas ("I study koalas; Australia, 1 come to
thee"), I'd suggest thinking about staying
here to get your Experience. Guinness, as
our drunk old friend Mr. Faulkner would
probably have been able to tell you, is sold at
a store near you.
