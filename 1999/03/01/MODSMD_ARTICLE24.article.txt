### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
Dreams come to live and die on
the mat, and for three Stanford
wrestlers, the dreams they have
had all season finally came true —
they have qualified for the nation
al tournament held later this
month. Junior Rudy Ruiz (125
lbs.), junior captain Zach Zim
merer (133) and senior Beau
Weiner (157) all wrestled with in
spiration at this weekend's Pacific
10 Conference Championships at
Burnham Pavilion to qualify for
the national meet.
"All three gave it all they had,"
said Stanford coach Chris Horpel.
"They simply wrestled their
hearts out."
The unseeded Ruiz had a tough
road to qualify for his second na
tional tournament. In his first
match against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo sophomore Jaime Garza,
Ruiz needed a huge throw, taking
Garza straight to his back, to score
five points in the final 30 seconds
to pull out a 9-6 victory. Ruiz was
the only winner for Stanford out

of the six who had matches in the
first round.
"My first match was closer than
I wanted, but I have been working
on close situations all week," Ruiz
said.

WRESTLING
■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford
placed eighth at Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championship.

Ruiz found himself in a dog
fight in the quarterfinals against
Arizona State sophomore Matt
Azevedo (No. 7 in the nation. No.
2 in the tournament). The match
was knotted at three in the third
period when Ruiz shot a great sin
gle-leg takedown and managed to
put Azevedo on his back. After a
tense 10 seconds, Ruiz was finally
able to pin him in 6:20 to advance
to the semis.
In the semis, Ruiz faced Ore
gon State freshman Nathan
Navarro (No. 15, No. 3). Ruiz
looked impressive on his feet and
was able to outlast a frustrated
Navarro in a 6-3 win to earn a spot

in the finals.
In the finals, Ruiz was pitted
against Cal State-Bakersfieki ju
nior Moses Delfin (No. 8. No. 1).
Ruiz showed lightning quickness
in his shots and only trailed 4-3
after the second period. In the
third. Ruiz was able to score on a
stalling point and a standup, and
Delfin picked up a point for riding
time to send it into overtime. In
overtime, Ruiz gave up a tough
double-leg to lose 7-5.
"I did not feel the pressure
going into the finals." Ruiz said. "I
was really relaxed and just en
joyed the opportunity to be
there."
Zimmerer (No. 16, No. 3) dom
inated his opponents on the way
to his second consecutive finals at
the Pac-l()s. After a first-round
bye. he destroyed Cal State-Bak
ersfield senior Brad Hull with a
flurry of takedowns and exposed
his back to the mat at will through
strong leg-riding to win 13-1.
"I just opened up on offense,"
Zimmerer said. "I was really fo
cused in my first matches."
The semis proved more formi

dable for Zimmerer as he faced
Oregon State sophomore Ben
Richards, who defeated him 6-5 in
November. Zimmerer looked
convincing on his feet, getting two
takedowns and taking Richards to
his back in the closing seconds to
go up 8-3 in the first period. After
riding Richards the entire second
period, Zimmerer gave up five
points on a reversal, takedown
and escape, but managed to hang
on to a 12-7 win.
"My past experience with
Richards helped and he was not
prepared for me," said Zimmerer.
In the finals, Zimmerer faced
ASU freshman Eric Larkin (No.
4. No. I). In the 7-3 loss, Zimmer
er was just not able to work his
takedowns or counter Larkin's
riding style. Larkin's takedowns
proved too much for Zimmerer.
"Mentally I was not in it, l just
had too much going through my
head," Zimmerer said.
Weiner entered the tourna
ment unranked and unseeded,
hoping to erase his failure to reach
nationals last season. After a first
round bye Weiner drew Oregon
senior Darryl Christian (No. 15,
No. 2) in the quarterfinals. The
key to Weiner's 7-2 victory was his
intensity in scoring on his low sin
gle-legs and ability to fight off es
cape attempts by a stunned Chris

tian.
"I just went in there with a pos
itive attitude and really I had
nothing to lose," Weiner said.
In the semis, Weiner drew
sophomore Eric Jorgensen (No.
20, No. 3) of Oregon State. The
first two periods had the score at
3-1 in favor of Weiner after he
scored a two-point double-leg
takedown off the whistle in the
first period and a sit-out in the sec
ond. In the third he was able to tilt
Jorgensen on his back for two
points before giving up a late take
down to win 5-4 and advance to
his first Pac-10 finals.
In the finals, Weiner matched
up with Boise State junior Larry
Quisel (No. 4, No. 1). After two
hard-fought periods, the score
was tied at 2-2. Weiner started on
top for the final gave
up an escape and takedown to
Quisel to go down 5-3, and went
on to lose 6-4.
Senior Shane Cross (174) was
the only other placer for the Car
dinal, taking sixth despite
wrestling with torn cartilage in his
ribcage.
As a team, Stanford finished
eighth with 54 points. Cal State
Bakersfield was first with 136.5,
Boise State was second with 106.5
and Arizona State took third with
98.5.
