# Fall of Troy
## Baseball wins two vs. No. 19 Trojans 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
A couple of weeks ago, Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Marquess
pointed out that if his established
hitters at the top of the order — guys
like junior first baseman John Gall,
sophomore right fielder Joe Bor
chard and junior center fielder Ed
mund Muth — could begin to string
together some hits, then some of the
pressure would be taken off the less
experienced players in the batting
order.

■ Yesterday: No. 19 USC (5-11) 9,
No. 4 Stanford (12-5) 7.
■ Saturday: Stanford 5, USC 2.
■ Friday: Stanford 10, USC 7.

"It will take [the pressure] off
guys like [Jeff] Rizzo, Nick Day,
[Craig] Thompson and [Damien]
Alvarado. Once that happens, I
think we'll be a much better offen

time.
Consider this weekend a fait ac

The fourth-ranked Cardinal (12-
5) came out swinging this weekend
in its three-game series with USC in
Los Angeles, getting more than 10
hits in each game and taking the first
two games in impressive fashion.

The No. 19 Trojans (5-11), however,
were able to salvage the final game
of this non-conference series with
their Pacific 10 Conference rival,
winning 9-7.
Still, the Cardinal managed to
win the series at USC for the third
straight season, winning seven of the
nine games in that stretch. It is the
kind of momentum it will need
heading into its Pac-10 opener
against Arizona State Friday.
"I'm very excited," said sopho
more right-handed pitcher Jason
Young, referring to the upcoming
Pac-10 season. "It's going to he
great. It looks like our hitting is com
ing around and hopefully, our pitch
ing will be there as well."
It was indeed some unlikely
names that set the tone offensively
in Friday night's opener, a ragged
10-7 victory that lasted nearly four
hours and saw each team commit
five errors a piece. Junior right field
er Nick Day and junior second base
man Jeff Rizzo, the No. 6 and No. 7
hitters in the Stanford batting order,
respectively, both went 4 for 5 on the
night.
It was Rizzo's first home run of
the season, a three-run shot in the
seventh inning, that gave Stanford a
9-7 lead. It was a lead that it would
not relinquish as senior left-hander
Tony Cogan got out of a bases
loaded, one-out jam in the ninth to
