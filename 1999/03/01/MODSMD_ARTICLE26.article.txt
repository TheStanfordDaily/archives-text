# Fall of Troy
## Baseball wins two vs. No. 19 Trojans 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
A couple of weeks ago, Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Marquess
pointed out that if his established
hitters at the top of the order — guys
like junior first baseman John Gall,
sophomore right fielder Joe Bor
chard and junior center fielder Ed
mund Muth — could begin to string
together some hits, then some of the
pressure would be taken off the less
experienced players in the batting
order.

BASEBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 19 USC (5-11) 9,
No. 4 Stanford (12-5) 7.
■ Saturday: Stanford 5, USC 2.
■ Friday: Stanford 10, USC 7.

"It will take [the pressure] off
guys like [Jeff] Rizzo, Nick Day,
[Craig] Thompson and [Damien]
Alvarado. Once that happens, I
think we'll be a much better offen
sive team," Marquess said at the
time.
Consider this weekend a fait ac
compli — for now.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal (12-
5) came out swinging this weekend
in its three-game series with USC in
Los Angeles, getting more than 10
hits in each game and taking the first
two games in impressive fashion.

The No. 19 Trojans (5-11), however,
were able to salvage the final game
of this non-conference series with
their Pacific 10 Conference rival,
winning 9-7.
Still, the Cardinal managed to
win the series at USC for the third
straight season, winning seven of the
nine games in that stretch. It is the
kind of momentum it will need
heading into its Pac-10 opener
against Arizona State Friday.
"I'm very excited," said sopho
more right-handed pitcher Jason
Young, referring to the upcoming
Pac-10 season. "It's going to he
great. It looks like our hitting is com
ing around and hopefully, our pitch
ing will be there as well."
It was indeed some unlikely
names that set the tone offensively
in Friday night's opener, a ragged
10-7 victory that lasted nearly four
hours and saw each team commit
five errors a piece. Junior right field
er Nick Day and junior second base
man Jeff Rizzo, the No. 6 and No. 7
hitters in the Stanford batting order,
respectively, both went 4 for 5 on the
night.
It was Rizzo's first home run of
the season, a three-run shot in the
seventh inning, that gave Stanford a
9-7 lead. It was a lead that it would
not relinquish as senior left-hander
Tony Cogan got out of a bases
loaded, one-out jam in the ninth to
finally secure the victory for fresh
man right-hander Dan Rich (1-0).
Young, however, would have
none of this offensive madness,
coming out with another sterling
pitching performance Saturday. In
the 5-2 victory, the right-hander
pitched his third complete game in

as many starts to improve to 4-1. In
going the distance, Young struck out
10 and allowed only four hits.
"It was more of a mix of stuff for
me," Young said, referring to his ef
fectiveness. "My curveball was de
cent and my change-up really set up
my fastball."
The Cardinal broke the game
open in the sixth inning with some of
the usual offensive suspects.
Thompson led off with a walk, Muth

singled, senior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang slammed an RBI dou
ble and Borchard singled in another
run. The inning was capped off with
a sacrifice fly by Gall.
It was back to the Rizzo, Day and
Thompson show yesterday after
noon. The trio combined for seven
hits and five runs through the first
five and a half innings as the Cardi
nal eked out a 7-6 lead. With two
outs in the bottom of the sixth, how

ever, senior center fielder Jason
Lane tagged a two-run double to
give USC the lead for good.
Also, sophomore left-hander
Steve Smyth pitched some brilliant
relief for the Trojans. After uncork
ing a sixth-inning wild pitch that
scored a run charged to starting
pitcher Justin Lehr, Smyth allowed
neither a hit nor a run in three and
two-thirds innings of work to secure
the USC victory.
