TUCSON, Ariz. — The NCAA
tournament is still within sii>ht. but

Pacific lOConferencechampionship
hopes are all hut lost as the Stanford
women's basketball team (16-11,12-
4 Pacific 10 Conference) lost to Ari
zona (16-9, 11-5), 81-67. Saturday in

Tucson.
The Cardinal left the game with
out much to he happy about except
the play of freshman guard Lindsey
Yamasaki, who scored 28 points and
went 8 for 9 from behind the three
point arc. The eight treys are second
in Stanford's all-time single-game
total, but that was little consolation
as all other players had dismal offen
sive outputs.
The loss was made all the more
painful as UCLA fell to Washing
ton. 96-85, later the same day. The
IJCLA loss meant that with a win
against Oregon on Thursday, Stan
ford could have forced a three-way
tie for first between itself, the Ducks
and the Bruins. With the loss at Ari
zona, Stanford would be lucky to fin
ish higher than third in the confer
ence, its lowest Pac-10 standing in
head coach Tara VanDerveer's 13
years.
Stanford started well as it had
against Arizona State on Thursday,
with the Cardinal striking first when
sophomore center Carolyn Moos
passed it inside to an open freshman
forward Bethany Donaphin. On the
next trip down the court, Yamasaki
hit her first three, and the Cardinal
offense looked to be poised for an
other 20 point blowout.
The first indication of a Stanford
offensive problem was 10 minutes
into the game as the Cardinal was
only down three. All of its points had
come from Donaphin and Yamasa
ki. Finally, with 9:09 left in the half,
sophomore forward Sarah Dimson
hit a jumper and the Cardinal was
only down one.
Then the Wildcats' full-court
press took effect. Arizona ran an ef

fective 2-2-1 that continually caused
turnovers and even if Stanford was
able to break the press, the Cardinal
routinely had less than 20 seconds to
set up and execute on offense.
The Cardinal turned the ball over
12 times in the first half, while Ari
zona had half that. Stanford ended
the game with a disturbing 26
turnovers, as the Wildcats commit
ted only three in the second half for
a total of nine.
"Arizona is a very good team,
and they're very athletic," Van-
Derveer said. "They're quick, and
we got no offense off of defense;
they had nine turnovers, so we got
no easy offense. Every time we play
against them we're basically playing
against a set defense, and their de
fense was very aggressive and very
quick."

■ Saturday: Arizona (16-9,11-5 Pa
cific 10 Conference) 81, Stanford
(16-11,12-4)67.

However much the Cardinal was
effected by the press, it was only
down by one at the half after fresh
man forward Enjoli Izidor swished a
buzzer-beater jumper from 10 feet.
Yamasaki had been a phenome
nal 4 of 5 from three-point land in
the first half, but she outdid herself
later, going 3 for 3 to start the second
half. Yamasaki's nine points were
Stanford's only in the first three min
utes, but they got the Cardinal a two
point lead and a glimmer of hope
that it could beat a Wildcat team that
