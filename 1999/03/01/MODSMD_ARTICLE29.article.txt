# One last hurrah for seniors: going out on top
## 
### 
For a group of people that have given us so many mem
orable moments, the players on the men's basketball
team didn't forget the first rule of entertainment:
Always leave 'em wanting more.
Alter tour wonderful years of growth and success.
From Night finally came for the five seniors. They danced
divinely. They charmed us and made us laugh and made
us cry and made us cheer. They won us over, and in the
end we crowned them kings.

Sure it's not over yet. lucre's still a few weeks left in
the year, a couple of tests left to take. Graduation is still
off on the horizon.
But for now, for just this one night, we could enjoy this
last big dance before getting ready for that last Big Dance.
The seniors are a group of five people that have en
joyed more success than any other class in the team's his
tory, and they're not even done yet.
When these guys were freshman, they were part of an
upset of then-No. 17 UCLA — the "Miracle at Maples"

that snapped a l()-game Stanford losing streak to the
Bruins. A year later they helped thump the Bruins by 4 C )
points — the "Massacre at Maples" — the biggest loss in
the history of college basketball's most successful pro
gram.
They almost knocked top-ranked Massachusetts from
the 19% NCAA Tournament, then followed it up by
bouncing Wake Forest and National Player of the Year
l im Duncan out of the postseason in 1997. They took
I Hah, a No. 2 seed in the tournament, to overtime before
succumbing.
They entered the 199X-99 season without Brevin
Knight and with numerous question marks, but... well,
we all know the rest of the story. It turned out that season
just became a coming-out party for the ('lass of '99.
And while the effort against Kentucky in the national
semifinal fell a little short as faras the scoreboard was con
cerned. it was more than enough to help the game fall into
lore as one of the greatest in Final Four history.
So Saturday night was the perfect way for them to
leave us.
Head coach Mike Montgomery said it himself: You
couldn't hope to write a better script.
I wouldn't want to.
After the game, Montgomery addressed the fans over
the Maples microphone, thanking them for their support
and finishing with the words "Now let's go to the tourna
ment."
