## Montgomery's birthday merits overdue gift 
### 
Newspapers don't usually give out
birthday presents, particularly
not to the people they cover. Mike
Montgomery, however, has earned
himself an exemption.

The timing of the present is two
days late: Montgomery turned 52
Saturday. The present itself is two
years overdue.
Montgomery woke up two years
ago on his 50th birthday and. pre
suming he reads the Daily sports sec
tion. was greeted by a sports editor's
column suggesting that poor coach
ing was costing the Cardinal men's
basketball team wins. "He's not the
man." the headline read. "Mont
gomery should shoulder some
blame."

As if turning 50 wasn't bad
enough.
Todd Bernstein's column alleged,
among other things, that Mont
gomery was too set in his man-to
man defense, that he couldn't prop
erly handle his personnel and that he
was too complacent after losses. The
Cardinal's struggles that year, he
wrote, came "because the coach can't
make crucial game-time decisions
that could ensure a win. I can't re
member the last time Montgomery
called a timeout in a key situation,
drew up a play and then watched as it
was executed perfectly for the game
winning shot."
Since the column ran, Mont
gomery has gone 59-9, taking teams
to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in 1997,
the Final Four in 1998 and the
school's first-ever Pacific 10 Confer
ence title this year. His trademark
man-to-man defense is one of the
toughest in the nation.
Though he has never won the
award before, Montgomery is the fa
vorite to take home Pac-10 Coach of
the Year honors this season. Last
Thursday he became the winningest

coach in the history of Stanford men's
basketball.
Montgomery is the kind of coach
every university covets. He's dedicat
ed. having spent 13 years at Stanford,
second only to Arizona's Lute Olson
in time spent at one school among ac
tive Pac-10 coaches. He is a program
builder, a man who took the school
where everyone said he couldn't win
and slowly but surely proved them
wrong. He recruits intelligent, hard
workers, and he gets them cleanly.
He fits those players into a system
that, like the coach himself, is not at
all flashy. Montgomery's system
thrives on no-name role players,
young men like Rich Jackson or
Peter Sauer that don't need stats to
prove their worth. It is a system that
welcomes the superstar but doens't
need him. Only one Stanford alum —
Brevin Knight — is a current NBA
starter. Even lowly Oregon State
boasts more than that.
It is this lack of flash, of star power
and junk defense and game-time sur
prises that Montgomery has drawn

critcism for in the past. Those critics
miss the point: Montgomery wins be
cause he is solid, because his teams
are solid, because everyone in the
conference knows Stanford's lineup
and game plan on any given night,
and the team executes it and wins.
That is how Montgomery has dis

tinguised himself as one of the best
coaches in the country, and that is
why he has earned this birthday gift.
Coach, on behalf of The Daily,
I'm sorry we ran that column. I'm
sorry we ever doubted you.
Happy birthday, Mike Mont
gomery. You are indeed "The Man."

Jim Tankersley does not expect to re
ceive Christmas cards from Todd
Bernstein anytime soon.
