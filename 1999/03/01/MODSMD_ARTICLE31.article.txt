# King Arthur back on top of the game
## 
### Brian Eule Senior staff writer 
I Jnder the "Arthur Lee File," buried in this
year's basketball yearbook, is the heading and
response, "My parents were right when they
told me: college would go by quickly."
And for Lee. it has.
Saturday night. King Arthur's court was in
session for one last time in Maples Pavilion, as
the No. 6 Cardinal rolled by the No. 7 Arizona
Wildcats 98-83 in the final home game of the
season.
For Lee, a career-high 29-point perfor
mance — 50 percent from the field, 50 percent
from behind the three-point line and a perfect
12 of 12 from the free-throw line — was a good
way to end a career in Maples, among thou
sands of fans chanting his name.
It's good to be the king.
The man who came to Stanford almost four
years ago, intent to challenge point guard
Brevin Knight every day in practice, has
brought several things to this campus with
him. Last year, it was a trip to the Final Four
with his "Miracle Minute" win against Rhode
Island in the NCAA tournament. Saturday
night, it was Stanford's first-ever Pacific 10
Conference title.
"This is the best feeling ever." Lee said,
after spending a good half hour running
around Maples with Stanford's student sec
tion. "To do it on Senior Night. I can't even de
scribe it with words. We talked about it all sea
son long."
Furthermore. Lee got to go up against
long-time rival Jason Terry and prove just
whose house this was — Lee's house.
.lust about a month ago, Terry took the
Cardinal for a ride in the McKale Center, de
feating Stanford, 78-7b. with a last-second shot
and a 29-point performance of his own.
But he made one mistake. He let Lee have
the last laugh.
"We were thinking about payback all week
long." Lee said. "They really gave it to us
down there. So we had someone in [Terry's]
face all night so it wouldn't be easy for him."
But as one poked fun as the other shot free
throws, and as the roles reversed moments
later, it was clear that these two were more

than rivals — they were friends.
Despite the fact that Terry played high
school ball in Seattle. Wash., and Lee played
in Southern California. Lee said he was con
stantly aware of Terry and his status as the two
made their decisions of where to go to college.
Lee chose to come to the smallest arena in
the conference to back up one of the best
guards in the conference.
"1 just remember coming in here and being
a freshman," he said last night. He was just
"watching Brevin and waiting for my time."
While his time certainly came long ago.
Saturday night didn't hurt in reminding every
one that Lee is ready for his final NCAA tour
nament.
"It was a fitting performance for Art Lee,"
said Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery.
"1 think the whole thing worked out. if you
could write a script."
Maybe the kid from L.A. would know a
thing or two about that...
Opening Scene: It's early in the morning.
The sun is rising and a car travels North on the
1-5. Two men share stories, smile, and enjoy
some time away from work. Since Lee's fresh
man year, his father has made this six-hour
drive for almost every home game, along with
Bruce Seaton (senior Mark Seaton's father).
On a Thursday night, the two fathers are
forced to leave immediately after the game's
conclusion, heading back to Southern Califor
nia in order to arrive at work by 8 a.m. It's a lot
of driving, but it's worth seeing their sons grow
into men.
Closing Scene: The entire student section
has engulfed Stanford's Pac-10 Champions,
the first time the school has claimed such a
title, and Lee is high-living as many as he can.
After jumping up on a table and pumping his
fist, he somehow sneaks out of the crowd, with
basketball in hand, runs around the mass of
black Sixth Man shirts at center court, and
finds his father. He gives him a hug.
Curtain Call: After a final Pac-10 roadtrip
to the Oregon schools. Stanford is ready for
the 1999 NCAA tournament. It's a chance to
get back to the Final Four. It's a chance to top
a Pac-10 title.
It's a chance to show the country who is the
king.
