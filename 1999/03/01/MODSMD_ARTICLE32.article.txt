# Fmr. U.N. leader decries sanctions against Iraq
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
Former U.N. Asst. Secretary
General Dennis Halliday spoke Sat
urday against U.N. sanctions in Iraq,
saying that the U.S.-driven policy
kills 4,500 children a month due to
malnutrition and lack of medicine.
Halliday described a country
with raw sewage running through
the streets and hospitals and schools
empty of even the most basic sup
plies.
Under the sanctions, "one of the
best public health systems in the
Middle East collapsed for lack of
doctors and supplies," he said.
"The school system doesn't have
a sanitation system or heat for the
winter," Halliday told the overflow
crowd of 350 at Terman Auditori
um. Students can't have pencils, be
cause the U.N. worries that Iraq will
use the carbon in them for military
purposes.
The sanctions were imposed at
the end of the Gulf War in 1991 to
curb Iraqi weapons development
and compensate Kuwait for losses
incurred during the war.
Halliday, an Irish statesman who
was in Iraq for 13 months as head of
the IJ.N. relief effort, resigned in
protest in August, stating that he
could no longer support a relief pro
gram that did not even begin to ad
dress the scope of the problem.
" The [U.N.] program is a fail
ure. ... It does not begin to address
mortality [orj malnutrition," he said.
The program allows Iraq to sell
$5.2 billion dollars worth of oil every
six months in return for food and
medicine. Halliday argued that the
program is too narrow in both size
and scope.
"Malnutrition is not resolved by
food," he said. "Malnutrition is re
solved by safe water, a balanced diet
with animal protein and education."
According to Halliday, the solu
tion involves regional arms control,
the lifting of sanctions and extension
of credit to Iraq.
"Some of you will say, 'this guy is
crazy, Saddam Hussein will buy

weapons [if the sanctions are lifted].'
... I don't think so. The Iraqi people
are very close to the edge.... They
have very little tolerance" for Hus
sein's policies.
Halliday was joined by Phyllis
Bennis. a fellow at the Institute for
Policy Studies in Washington, D.C.
Bennis emphasized the United
States' leading role in imposing the
sanctions.
"Even though the sanctions are
imposed in the name of the U.N.,
there is no question that this is a U.S.
policy," Bennis said. "The United
States is using the fig leaf of the U.N.

to give legitimacy to it."
Bennis noted that the arms
buildup in Iraq was due primarily to
weapons, both conventional and bi
ological, provided by the United
States during the Iran-Iraq war in
the 1980s.
"Saddam Hussein was a partner
to the U. 5.... a recipient of a mas
sive amount of U.S. arms," she said.
"Saddam Hussein may be a son of a
bitch, but he was our son of a bitch
for a period of time."
The speech was sponsored by 18
campus groups, led by the Muslim
Students Awareness Network.
