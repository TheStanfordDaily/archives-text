# Prize goes to accurate, not fast, runners
## 
### Marie Sotelo Contributing writer 
Contestants in a non-traditional
race took to Campus Drive and the
foothills for Saturday's 10th annual
Bill Fairbank Memorial Run / Walk
/ Bike. The race is held as a memori
al for Bill Fairbank, a Stanford
physics professor from 1959 until his
death in 1989.
In the Fairbank race, the fastest
runner is not necessarily the victor.
The winner of the race is the partici
pant whose actual time is fractionally
closest to his or her predicted time as
calculated by computer.
Jane Fairbank, Bill Fairbanks
widow, has been the official starter of
the race since its beginning. Decked
in cardinal from head to toe, she wel
comed newcomers and chatted with
old friends before signaling the start
of the event.
She attributed the event's success
to the ardor and devotion of both the
participants and volunteers. "My
husband and these other folks who
run have an attitude and enthusiasm
that is contagious, and I think that is
the reason this is successful," she
said.
"People who have done this sort
of thing for years and years share this
enthusiasm for being outdoors,
keeping in shape and being in com
petition," Jane Fairbank said.

While the race was open to the en
tire Stanford community, it provided
participants an opportunity to re
member Bill Fairbank by living out
and celebrating his most endearing
characteristics.
"He was so competitive but in an
absolutely spirited, delightful way,"
said Dan Deßra, professor emeritus
of aeronautics and astronautics. This
competitive streak may have been
the driving force behind Fairbanks
many contributions to physics re
search and experimentation, he sug
gested.
According to Deßra, his contri
butions were impressive in both ma
terial value and intellectual variety.
Physics Prof. Todd Smith, de
scribed Bill Fairbank as "an excellent
physicist" and "an eternal optimist."
Smith and his wife, Sandy, were
also close friends of Bill Fairbank.
They have both participated in the
race every year and even won the
event once. i
Sandy Smith praised the event for
its unique constituency. "Where else
are you going to see people running
with their kids?" she asked. And kids
there were. Two avid runners sport
ed strollers and several of the partici
pants came as families with children
of all ages.
Anita Banning, a neighbor of
Jane Fairbank at Channing House in
Palo Alto, represented the opposite

end of the age spectrum. She has just
taken up race walking and was en
ticed by Jane Fairbank's enthusiasm
to participate in this year's event. "1
said fine, if it doesn't rain," she said.
Runners and walkers traveled the

4.1 mile Campus Drive loop, while
bicyclists used an alternative 11.5
mile route that looped out to
Arastradero Road.
Addressing the racers as they
lined up on Angell Field. Jane Fair

bank expressed her gratitude to the
event coordinators and volunteers
who have made the event a success.
Robert Wagoner, also a physics pro
fessor and friend of Fairbank, was
described as the driving force behind

the event's conception and organiza
tion.
Al! of the finishers will receive
certificates, and the winner's name
will appear on a plaque displayed in
the Physics Conference Room.
