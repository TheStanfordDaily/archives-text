If textbooks are getting shorter, the trend has not
reached Stanford.
While scholars at other universities are reportedly
feeling increasing pressure from publishers to downsize
their work, faculty authors of the textbooks for some of
Stanford's most popular undergraduate classes have not
felt the pinch.
According to a recent report in the Chronicle of High
er Education, university presses are demanding that pro
fessors make academic books shorter. Authors that have
trouble meeting these limitations are often given an ulti
matum: pare down the work or find another publisher.
"Books twenty years ago were often too big," ex
plained Economics Prof. John Taylor, author of the text
book for Stanford's Economics 1 course.
"Today, there is a tendency to water down textbooks
a little bit; shorter is sometimes viewed as easier for the
student," he said.
However, Taylor added, "I haven't heard of shorter
books having a better chance of being published. But I've
never had problems with exceeding length limits. With
me, it is frequently the other way around — the publish
ers think of more things that they want to include, and
they want the book longer."
"Reviewers always want books shorter," said Com
puter Science Prof. Eric Roberts, who wrote the text
book used for Computer Science 106 A and KKSB. "It's
what I always tell people who are thinking of writing a
book: the publishers will say, 'Add A, B, and C and make
it shorter.'"
However, Roberts said that he has seen no evidence
of increased pressure to shorten books. "I haven't pub
lished within the last two years, but I have no data to con
firm it,"he said.
William Petig, senior lecturer in German Studies,
concurred. Petig, the author of an introductory-level
German textbook used at Stanford, said, "Publishers
look at their competitors' books, and they want to stay
within a certain length limit of what already exists."
In the end, the deciding factor may often be the effec
tiveness of a book, not its length. As Taylor explained,
"Book length is more of a mutual agreement between
publishers and the author. We try and find out what helps
students the most."
