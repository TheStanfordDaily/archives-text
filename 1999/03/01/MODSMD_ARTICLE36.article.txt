Recognizing the important role
that youth sports play in the lives of
children, the Positive Coaching Al
liance, a nonprofit organization based
in the Department of Athletics, has
announced that it will implement a
new program to improve the skills ol
youth coaches.
The organization is currently seek
ing 20 Bay Area youth sports organi
zations to be part of the program.
"Youth sports has the potential to
do great things," said Jim Thompson,
founder and director of the Positive
Coaching Alliance.
"Unfortunately, coaches often

aren't familiar with the capacities of
kids at different ages. When they start
coaching, many don't know how to ef
fectively encourage and inspire their
players."
"It is usually the case that they
model the kinds of aggressive coach
ing they see on television, which is not
appropriate for young kids."
The program will implement a set
of "standards of excellence" devel
oped to help each youth sports organi
zation improve how coaches work
with their young athletes.
A "positive coach." according to
Thompson, "develops skills and char
acter; fosters internal motivation; sets
standards of continuous improve

ment; refuses to motivate through
fear and intimidation; creates a part
nership with players; has the strength
to let players take the spotlight and
honors the game."
Three representatives from each of
the 20 groups that are selected will at
tend a three-day leadership-develop
ment training program. The Positive
Coaching Alliance will work with
each organization for two years with
on-site training for coaches, quarterly
meetings and online help.
Thompson said that the Positive
Coaching Alliance is looking to select
a diverse group of youth organizations
for the program. The application
deadline for the program is April 1.
