# SLAC to study black holes, neutron stars

A new experiment will help Stanford
professors and graduate students ex
plore the distant reaches of outer space.
Working in conjunction with the
Naval Research Laboratory, the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
launched a satellite on Feb. 23 to study
black holes and neutron stars.
Expected to have a 3-year opera
tional life, Advanced Research and
Global Observation Satellite will carry
out nine primary experiments.
The Unconventional Stellar Aspect,
the experiment based at Stanford, is de
signed to observe bright X-ray sources
to further understanding of black holes,
neutron stars and white dwarf stars.

"This is the first time that SLAC has
been directly involved in a space-based
experiment. USA gives us the chance to
do in-depth particle astrophysics re
search on many different black hole and
neutron star systems in our Galaxy,"
SLAC Prof. Elliott Bloom, the lead co
investigator for the Stanford part of the
collaboration, said.
"This study will allow us to explore
and investigate many aspects of astro
physics that we cannot reproduce in the
lab," added Lynn Cominsky, a visiting
professor at SLAC.
Not only are various professors and
researchers at SLAC involved in this
project, a growing number of graduate
students are also making substantial
contributions.

Cominsky said, "One really unique
thing about USA is that it gives gradu
ate students in the physics department
the opportunity to become involved in
small groups conducting research.
Graduate students have played a huge
role in helping to develop the hardware
for USA."
According to SLAC Public Affairs
Director P.A. Moore, the Stanford as
pect of the experiment involved the
construction of a piece of equipment,
called a collimator, that can give loca
tion data about the origin of X-rays in
space.
"This is a very broad experiment,"
Bloom said. "Because the Air Force
and Navy are paying for most of the
project and SLAC only has to pay for a

relatively little portion, this mission
must be very diverse, involving many
practical aspects."
Although the USA experiment itself
costs $15 million, the remaining eight
experiments in ARGOS total up to
$200 million. Stanford only had to pay
for the hardware costs.
SLAC first became interested in as
trophysics in 1989 and received funding
for USA in 1991. Scientists at Calgary
University, MIT, and NASA AMES
have also collaborated with Stanford
and the NRL on this project.
"USA was driven purely by common
scientific interest and it will be interest
ing to see what will come up as far as
data and results in the next few years,"
Bloom said.
