Between Feb. 26 and March 6 students and staff
will get a chance to experience Stanford through a dif
ferent perspective â€” a Judaic one.
The annual Jewish Culture Week, sponsored by
Hillel Foundation at Stanford and the Sinai Memori
al Chapel, encompasses activities including learning
Israeli dance, picking up the basics of Yiddish and ex
periencing Israeli life through the Israel Film festival.
The events are being held to celebrate Purim, a
Jewish holiday marked by joyful revelry.
"I'm really happy that we cater to different peo
ple's interests," said Daniel Lipskin, an intern for Hil
lel who will coordinate Thursday's Israel Day's activ
ities, including a panel on "Upcoming Elections in Is
rael."
"Through the panel discussion that I helped plan,
we hope to increase the people's understanding and
knowledge in a non-political way."
UC-Berkeley's Hillel Israel Program Director
Inbar Horowitz will discuss the situation in Israel from
the perspective of the media, while San Francisco Is
rael Project Director Peter Altman will focus on the
political parties in Israel from a journalistic perspec
tive. The panel will take place Thursday at 4:30 p.m. in
Tresidder's Cypress Room South.
A new addition to the cultural week is this year's
film festival, which will take place Wednesday at 8
p.m. and Thursday at 6:30 p.m. Three current Israeli
movies will be aired: "My Own Golani," "The Gay
Cabaret" and "Florentene."
"We wanted to highlight Israeli contemporary cul
ture," said Melissa Chud, member of the committee
on Jewish Cultural Week that helped plan the film fes
tival. "Lots of images that students have now are out
dated, and we wanted to portray more of what Israeli
life is about."
"Florentene" is a movie based on a popular Israeli
television series similar to "Melrose Place" and
"Friends" that takes a look at Generation X growing
up in Tel Aviv after the Rabin assassination.
The director Eitan Fox is flying from Israel for a
chance to discuss the three-hour, six-part movie and
the popular Israeli series. The Israeli director of "My
Own Golani" and"The Gay Cabaret," Yuval Bechar,
will also be present for a question and answer period
following his short films.
On Friday Hillel will host a special Shabbat dinner
in the Old Union Ballroom at 7 p.m., featuring a well
known Bay Area Jewish comedian and a Jewish a
capella troupe.
The culmination of the week is the Purim Mas
querade to celebrate Judaism's most joyful holiday.
"We are not expecting just Jewish students to
come," said Hayley Delugach, program and outreach
director at Hillel. "The list of activities planned for the
week are for the whole campus to get involved in as
well as a chance for the Jewish students to get togeth
er and create something by meeting as a community."
