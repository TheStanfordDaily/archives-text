WOMEN'S GOLF
■ Last Week: No. 7 Stanford placed
sixth at the Arizona Invitational.

Homeyer opened with a 3-under
par 69 on the 6,(X)3 yard, par-72 Ran
dolph Park Golf Course. She fell to
rounds of 74 and 73 on the second
and third days to finish at even par, 10
strokes behind tournament winner
and reigning United States Golf As
sociation women's amateur champi
on Grace Park of Arizona State.
Tournament host and second
ranked Arizona came from behind
on the last day to capture the team
title in the inaugural event with a 10-
under total of 854.
The Cardinal ended with a total of
886, which earned the team a sixth
place finish. Stanford was boosted by
an uncharacteristically strong open
ing round behind scores of 69 from
both Homeyer and fellow sopho
more All-American Stephanie
Keever.
Sophomore Lauren Robertson,
who played as an individual medalist
— with her score not counting to
ward the Stanford team total —
noted that the team has had trouble
starting well in earlier tournaments.
"It was good to start off strong,"

Robertson said. "Hopefully this will
serve as a prelude of what's to come
in the spring season."
While Stanford fell back slightly
on the second two days, the tourna
ment was overall a positive experi
ence for the team. The relatively
wide open, trouble-free course led
teams to take risks which lowered
scores beyond normal totals.
"Had we played at the same level
on a more difficult course," Robert
son said, "we would have finished
second or third."
In addition to Homeyer's even
par total, Keever, who is returning
from November arthroscopic knee
surgery, finished in a tie for 14th place
at 3 over par. Junior Jae Jean Ro, be
hind solid rounds of 76, 75 and 76
ended up in a tie for 46th. Rounding
out the Cardinal scores were junior
Julie Dunn and sophomore Jessica
Belskis, totaling scores of 13 over par
to tie for 52nd.
The higher scores in the second
and third rounds, though taking the
Cardinal out of contention for the
title, were of little concern to team
members. Both Keever and Robert
son said that the team's level of play
did not fall off considerably, but that
a slight change in course conditions
may have prompted the rising num
bers.
Robertson said that course offi
cials decided to cut the usually slower
Bermuda greens to a shorter length
in order to make putts roll more
smoothly. The Stanford team may
have had trouble adjusting to the
minor modifications.
"The putts just weren't falling for
us," Robertson said.
