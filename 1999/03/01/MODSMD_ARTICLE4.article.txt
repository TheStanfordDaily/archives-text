"I think it's good to have a poet

— someone from the humanities
— speaking at graduation," senior
Seott Peterson said. "The lyrical
and improvisational character of
Pinsky's poetry really fits the di
versity of our senior class. His
name may be less well known than
some of our speakers, but I'm in
terested to see what he will say
when he addresses the graduating
seniors."
Senior class presidents recom
mended Pinsky based on his experi
ence in the arts.
"We wish to recognize the en
during value inherent in art and po
etry that speaks to all graduates,
