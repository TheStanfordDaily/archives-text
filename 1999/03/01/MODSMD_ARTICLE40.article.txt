## New show gets touchy, PHE-ly 
### Bob Gates 
A ROMP WITH RES ED

The Office of Residential Education is proud to announce a
new union between its Peer Health Educators group and the
Stanford Instructional Television Network. The Res Ed group,
known around campus as "PHEs," will actually be hosting its
own weekly talk show, which will be produced by SITN great
Menise Dorris, still known on campus primarily for her late
M97os documentary, "Hidden Treasures of a Nudist." The Daily
'caught up with Ms. Dorris recently at the exciting new Cantor
J Art Museum:
DAILY: Ms. Dorris, what exactly will the new show be about, and
* is there a working title yet?

MENISE DORRIS: The new show, tentatively called "PHE, Phi, Pho, Phum: I Swear to God This
Show's Not Dumb (or About Sororities)," focuses on health concerns which plague the cam
pus while not forgetting about the rebellious climate that we are immersed in. For example, the
first show deals with health problems while also taking a look at campus issues. I think it's
going to be entitled "How to Effectively Protest the Transfer of Dining Service Employees
While Suffering from the After-effects of Salmonella." We've also just started work on our sec
ond show, which we're pretty sure it will be called "Oh Lord Jesus — 1 Sound Like a Frog!: A
Lesson in Screaming Bible Verses in White Plaza Without a Larynx."
D: Shazam! Can you tell us a little about the show's format?
MD: Well, I'm really excited about our format. It's fresh, it's new, it's hard to describe. The best
I can do is say that it's like Jerry Springer with a tinge of "Pop-Up Video." The Annoying Guy
Who Goes to Every Class to Sell Used Books is going to be the host. We think that he's going
to help us draw a large crowd with his new look.
D: Vavoom! Tell us more! If you can, of course....
MD: All I can say without giving it all away is: Mr. T.
D: Kaplooey! This is all very fascinating! Now, you've had years of experience in the television
and documentary film arenas of creativity. How are your past experiences going to help shape
this fledgling talk show?
MD: Well, I'm most excited about being able to incorporate techniques I've learned from film
ing classes for SITN with those I studied while making "Hidden Treasures." With this talk show,
we're actually going to take out of the SITN classrooms some of the overhead cameras usually
used to film professors' notes or slides and use them as "Cleavage Cams."
D: Yummy! Well, we're about out of space. Good luck with the show! And to all of our readers,
don't miss this one!
