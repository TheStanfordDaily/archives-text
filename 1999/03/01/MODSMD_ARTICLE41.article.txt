# We crossed the line, baby!

By Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow
and Zach "Putz" Udko
Schmuck and Putz just had a revela
tion. In fact, as they are writing this col
umn, they are still in a euphoric state of
mental intoxication. If they sound overly
giddy in today's column, please excuse
them. They have just returned from the
amazing dorm-organized program
"Crossing the Line" — where students
share their deepest, darkest secrets with
each other — and yes, they have are now
reborn men. Hallelujuah!
In fact, the two were so moved by this
life-altering experience, they realized
what their calling at Stanford should be:
to educate — nay, to Res Educate! Here's
just a preview of some fresh programs
that these pricks have in store for you:
T & A
Dormitories tend to invite prestigious
professors from campus to give talks
about their specialties. Great! As if our
lives aren't already cluttered with the
mindless babble of tenured, white men!
(Go Warrior — we'll fight for you! Our
favorite film was "Dances with Wolves!").
We suggest extending invitations to an
unspoken minority at Stanford — the

poor, psychopathic teaching
assistants. They sleep in their
cars, don't change their clothes,
go days without eating and are
responsible for your grades at this
fine University. And they'll do
anything for a bite of food. Why
not feed them in our dining halls
and ask these courageous indi
viduals to come talk about their
intriguing night lives: namely,
their graveyard shift jobs?
Who knew that your math TA
was a stripper — she barely
speaks English? Hear your psych
TA talk about innocent brain
washing incidents that went awry
while babysitting. And who ever

expected to see their I-Hum TA with a
box of Domino's at your door? Better
make sure you tip him well!
PALO ALTO SCAVENGER HUNT
We feel that San Francisco is simply too
far to visit for this dorm tradition, espe
cially when we have the exciting metro

politan center of Palo Alto right in our
own backyard. Students will become
immersed in the hustle and bustle of this
alluring city for a whole 12 hours.
Instead of getting stripper applica
tions, talking to hookers, getting tattoos
and finding edible underwear in the city
of Rice-A-Roni, here are a couple of local
must-do's: Buy a $5,000 French poster.
Get a $100 haircut at Yosh. Read a book
at Borders. See a really obscure movie
that came to theaters 50 years ago. Walk
up and down the same block 80 times.
And don't forget to visit the nearby red
light district.
SEX WITH FURNITURE
Alright celibates and CS majors (oops!
same thing), listen up: this one's for you.
Few people know that Stanford has its
very own abstinence group on campus
called "True Love Waits." We kid you not,
it's true — there are virgins at Stanford!
Members of this elitist society will
come to your dorm and discuss how they
relieve sexual tension. Don't miss the
extra-special "Sex with Furniture"
demonstration featuring props made of
velvet, silk, cashmere and rosewood. It
promises to be kinky and naughty.

SWISS SKI TRIP
No more bourgeois bussing to Lake
Tahoe, kiddos. Next Martin Luther King
weekend, you'll be skiing like a Stanford
student should — in style. From your
first class Swiss Air ticket to your plush
chalet in the Alps to wining and dining in

the ritziest Geneva restaurants, you'll be
sure to find new meaning to the week
end's "liberation." Lackeys will carry your
skis to the powdered slopes and massage
your feet afterwards in the local spa.
Though only 0.06 percent of this event
will be dorm-subsidized, scholarships for
the peasants are always available.
HEBONICS: THE JEWISH TONGUE
Many dorms have been visited by some
guy who thinks he's so clever for compar-

ing all the different ways peo
ple refer to carbonated bev
erage across the country
(soda, pop, coke ... etc ...).
It's time for new a dialect
dynamic delight. It's time for
HEBONICS!
The Long Island School
Board has recently declared
"Hebonics" a legitimate
dialect of many Jewish
Americans. Linguistics
Professor Chaim Shlomo
Ben Yamim will discuss the
nuances of this phenome
non. Here are a couple of
rules: (1) Questions are
always answered with ques-

tions (Q: How are you feeling? A: How
should I be feeling?). (2) The subjects are
always placed at the end of the sentences
(That was delicious, that dinner!). (3) The
use of overexaggeration (In English:
Please finish your dinner. In Hebonics:
What's the matter with you? People in
Ethiopia are starving!).



Yes! Yes! Give it to me faster and harder, my woody friend!
