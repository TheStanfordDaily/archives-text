# Klein comes through in clutch for Card
## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
Alter completing his degree requirements
in just three years, helping the Cardinal win
the NCAA men's volleyball championship
during his sophomore year and studying at
multiple exotic ports through the Semester at
Sea Program, one could wonder what else
Patrick Klein hoped to accomplish as a Stan
ford student. For the senior outside hitter on
the Stanford men's volleyball team, the col
lege experience was still incomplete.
Given the history of professional athletes
in Klein's family, it's not surprising that the
opportunity to compete one final season in a
Cardinal uniform enticed Patrick to return to
Stanford, even though he had already com
pleted the academic graduation require
ments.
In previous years, one might have over
looked Klein's contributions to the Stanford
volleyball program. In his first two years ol
collegiate eligibility, Klein saw action in just
13 matches. During his junior year, he con
tributed in 19 matches.
"There were times our sophomore year
when Patrick was the best player on the
court," said 1996-97 setter P.K. Diflcnbaugh.
"He single-handedly would keep the second
team competitive."
This year, Klein rounds out his collegiate
career as one of the leading attackers in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and as an
invaluable contributor to the Stanford volley
ball program. Alter junior Ail-American
Andy Witt's decision to quit the team, Klein
has assumed Witt's starting position.
"This year, we have asked him to play a
bigger role," said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. " Throughout his career, Patrick has
taken a lot of swings for the team. He is so
physically strong and well conditioned. He
tends to gel stronger as the match goes on in
relation to other players."
Perhaps the athletic achievements of a
family of professional-caliber athletes down
play the significance of Klein's own athletic
success. Klein's father. Bob, played football at
USC before beginning a pro career with the
Rams and Chargers.
"I know the things athletics did for me,"
Bob Klein said. "It created the opportunity
for me to go to college. Athletics have been
good for our family."
I le could say that again.
Klein's older sister, Kristin, played colle
giate volleyball at Stanford from I9XK-91.

After earning four All-America honors,
Kristin went on to train with the U.S. Nation
al Team and represented the United States in
the'% Atlanta Olympics.
But that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Klein's brother-in-law, Adam Keefe,
played basketball for the Cardinal before be
ginning an NBA career with the Utah Jazz.
Patrick's older brother, Jimmy, also com
peted for Stanford. Jimmy was a member of
both the Cardinal football and volleyball
teams until a persistent ACL injury forced an
early retirement.
Perhaps Patrick's decision to play volley
ball seemed like the obvious progression after
his own three-sport varsity athletic career at
Loyola High School in Los Angeles.
To everyone but Patrick Klein himself.
"I was originally planning on playing foot
ball in the Ivy League," said the Southern Cal
ifornia native. "I went on a recruiting trip to
Harvard in January of my senior year and it
was snowing there. Once I got back, I can
celed some of my trips to East Coast schools
and planned some trips to ('alifornia schools."
After narrowing his selection process
down to Stanford and USC, the unparalleled
combination of academics and athletics at
Stanford proved too alluring. Many of these
non-athletic factors have afforded Klein some
of the most significant aspects of his Stanford
experience.
"Stanford has been a good place for my
volleyball career," Klein said. "But it's been
an even better place to grow as a person and
learn a lot about life."
Klein's whirlwind senior year began when
the Semester at Sea ship started its three
month journey from a Canadian port.
Patrick's decision to study abroad enabled
him to visit such foreign locations as Vietnam
and India, but he was forced to sacrifice valu
able fall quarter training time.
"1 had no idea what to expect in Vietnam."
he said. "I was amazed by the friendly people
and beauty of the place. The people were un
conditionally nice."
Klein returned to Stanford with a new out
look and increased responsibilities to the
team.
"For me, this season has been different,"
Klein said. "I have a new perspective on ap
proaching the game, and a lot of things have
been falling into place."
On Jan 29, Klein moved into the starting
outside hitter position and has since started
several matches in a row. On his first appear
ance of '99 as a starter, Klein posted a double

double recording 34 kills and 10 digs. Current
ly. he leads the team in double-doubles
(three) and is second in kills (179). Klein has
also tallied the sixth-best kills-per-game ratio
in the MPSF.
But for the senior who has been accus
tomed to such a lull schedule his entire life,

there's much to look forward to after the con
clusion of the Stanford volleyball season.
"I am going to be traveling throughout Eu
rope this summer with friends," Klein said. "I
am interested in looking into law school down
the road. But my immediate plans are up in
the air."
