# Volleyball runs out of gas against Trojans

### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
Perhaps Ihc one thing the No. 12
Stanford men's volleyball team (4-8,
3-8 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) needs right now more than
conference wins is just a little bit of
confidence.
Head coach Ruben Nieves be
lieves that there's not a team in the
N( A A that the (Cardinal can't beat.
Friday night in front of nearly WO
spectators, the Stanford band, the
I Jollies, and Kappa Kappa (iamma
sorority members clad in psyche
delic disco attire, the Cardinal bat
tled not just any volleyball team,
but the Long Beach State 49ers, the
most formidable team in the Pacific
Division of the MPSF. The third
ranked 49ers (10-0,7-0) have estab
lished an undefeated record, earn
ing victories over perennial volley

ball powerhouses Pepperdine and
I lawaii.
" Tonight, we played one of the
best teams in the nation and we had
them on the ropes," Nieves said.
Stanford challenged this high
caliber team point for point, refus
ing to allow I .ong Beach to string to
gether sequences of unanswered
scoring.

■ l-riduy: No. 3 Long Beach State
(10-0, 7-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) del. No. 12 Stanford (4-
8, 3-8) 155-9, 13-15. 15-8. 15-7.

At least until the ( ardinal lost its
confidence.
In the third game, the Cardinal's
original 8-5 edge evolved into a 15-8
I .ong Beach State game-three win.
"This was the key to the match,"
said Long Beach State head coach

Ray Ratclle. "Our guys sucked it
up and started scrambling for
points."
Stanford never recovered from
letting this game slip away and lost
the match 15-9,13-15, 15-K. 15-7.
"We dwelled too much on losing
this game instead of turning it
around and giving it back to them"
said junior outside hitter Gabe
Gardner.
Coming off a lethargic three
game loss to USC on Thursday
night, the Stanford squad that com
peted on Friday made a more deter
mined effort from the start of play.
"After the USC loss, a lot of us
wanted to leave it all on the court
tonight." (htrdner said.
Stanford's .419 hitting percent
age in the first game was higher than
in any of games in the USC loss. But
four Cardinal over-passes enabled
Long Beach to close out game one.

In the second game, Stanford's
remained confident, despite trailing
the 49ers throughout the game.
Down 11-5 and then down again 13-
8. the Cardinal fought back behind
Gardner's attacking efforts. Gard
ner recorded 17 of his 38 kills during
this set. The Cardinal closed out this
game when junior Josh Palaciosdug
a ball out at his foot, which Gardner
eventually killed.
This intensity continued into the
start of game three. Stanford kicked
off that set with a 2-0 lead, eventual
ly building up an 8-5 advantage.
But then Long Beach sopho
more Mark Prosser began a five
point scoring run which put the Car
dinal out of a competitive position
for the rest of the evening.
Long Beach State's momentum
did not stop with Prosser's serving.
Stanford was unable to score for the
remainder of the game and its hit

ting percentage fell to a match-low
.119.
After game three the Cardinal's
spark disappeared. The 49ers went
on to win the first six points of game
four, then dominated the rest of the
match, establishing a 9-2 lead and
eventually capturing the final game
15-7.
What the Stanford men's volley
ball team most desperately needed
Friday night — a fourth conference
win — it did not attain. Instead,
Stanford got a positive forecast for
the future, if and only if it maintains
a consistent, high level of intensity.
"Thursday night, we looked like
a team without a future," Nieves
said. Friday night, "we were more
determined, we stuck together. This
game is something we can build on.
If we can play more like this in prac
tice and in games, good things will
happen."
