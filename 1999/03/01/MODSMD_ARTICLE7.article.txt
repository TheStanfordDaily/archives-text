## 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
Three students have officially

declared their
candidacies for
the spring 1999
ASSU presiden
tial election.
Candidates in
clude Mike
Levin and run
ning mate John

Mills, Dave Lampson and Owen
Ellickson, and Auren Rule and
Sonali Mitra.
Although only a sophomore,
Levin has nearly two years of ex
perience with the ASSU. He cur
rently serves as deputy senate

chair and was a freshman senator.
Levin said his platform will be
based on increasing graduate and
undergraduate involvement and
strengthening the role of the
ASSU as an advocacy group for
students.
With Mills, a third-year doctor
al student in genetics, as Levin's
running mate, this is the first time
that an undergraduate and gradu
ate student will share a ticket.
Levin believes this will "pro
vide instant credibility with the
administration and with graduate
students."
"I'll have more credibility going
into a meeting with a mature 24-
year-old by my side," he said.
Lamspon, a junior and editor

of the Chaparral, has had no pre
vious involvement with the
ASSU. From Cambridge, Mass.,
he is most concerned about "free
dom" on campus.
"Freedom includes anything
from parking and education to the
fraternity housing scene."
Lampson complains of not
being able to find a parking space
for his car on campus and said that
fraternities do not have a large
enough voice in their housing sit
uation.
"Freedom is the opposite of
being a slave on campus," Lamp
son said.
Lampson's running mate, El
lickson, a junior and member of
the Chaparral, has no prior expe

rience with the ASSU.
Kule, a junior from New York,
is also a newcomer to the ASSU.
He said his work for the Treasury
Department in Washington, D.C.,
last quarter inspired him to run.
"That's where a spark in me
was formed that made me want to
run. I saw how the political
process worked, and I think I can
translate that here, " Kule said.
Kule hopes to address the
needs of individual undergradu
ate classes by creating focus
groups and stressed that his run
ning mate is the only female on
the ballot.
Conscious of being an outsider
to the ASSU, Kule promises that
"this is a serious campaign."
