# Actors help teach future psychiatrists

Forget "FR." At the School of
Medicine, acting and patient care
now come together to enhance the
experience of students.
For five years, actors have
helped Stanford medical students
learn how to diagnose patients with
physical ailments. Now, for the first
time, actors are being used in the
psychiatry clerkship to teach stu
dents the correct procedure for
identifying patients with drug or al
cohol dependency problems.
Interaction with patients who
have chemical dependencies re
quires aunique set of skills. In order
not to offend their patients, stu
dents follow strict sets of questions
that they have learned in the class
room.
One such procedure has been
used to identify patients with drink
ing problems by asking them if they
ever saw the need to cut down their

alcohol intake, felt annoyed when
asked about their drinking, experi
enced guilt about their drinking, or
used alcohol as an eye-opener in
the morning
Fifth-year medical student
Robert Matano said actors help stu
dents learn the human side of what
they are taught in classrooms. "You
can talk about it all you want," he
explained, "but it is good to see a
concrete example."
Fourth-year medical student
Rein Jensen shared Matano's en
thusiasm. She recently conducted a
session that ended in the "patient"
storming out of the room in a rage.
In such realistic situations, Jensen
said, "You forget it's an actor."
But some students complain that
the actors seem fake, or that they do
not care as much as if they were
with a real patient. Matano said that
some actors overplay their roles, a
habit that can render their use as
educational aids ineffective.
