# More golf, yoga classes offered
## 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
In response to the high demand
from stressed-out Stanford stu
dents, the Athletic Department has
increased the number of yoga and
golf classes offered this year.
Eight golf classes are being
taught this year, up from four last
year. Four of these elasses were
taught in the fall, and four will be
taught in the spring.
The new hitting area built at the
driving range made these additions
possible.
Twice as many yoga classes are
being offered this year as well;
there are six this year, while last
year there were only three.
The change was made possible
by promoting the yoga instructor
to a full-time position.
As the instructor teaches both
yoga and aerobics, the greater

number of yoga classes will force
the department to cut its aerobics
schedule from three classes to two.
Because aerobics classes can be
quite large, all interested students
can be accepted into aerobics.
However, "even this quarter
there is still a tremendous waiting
list [for yoga and golf classes]," said
Anne Gould, who organizes recre
ational sports in the Athletic De
partment.
She and her colleagues are "still
putting in requests for more class
es. We sent a letter to [Athletic Di
rector] Ted Leland," Gould said.
"We are no longer limited by fa
cility constraints. Now it is an issue
of money," Gould said.
The size of golf classes is still
limited by the availability of the hit
ting area and golf course.
Beginning Dead Week, stu
dents can register for these and
other athletic classes on the Web.
