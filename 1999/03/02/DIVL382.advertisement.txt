IF YOU THOUGHT COLLEGE WAS EXPENSIVE,
TRY PUTTING YOURSELF THROUGH RETIREMENT
Think about supporting yourself
for twenty-five, thirty years or
longer in retirement. It might be the
greatest financial test you'll ever face.
Fortunately, you have two valuable
assets in your favor: time and tax deferral.
The key is to begin saving now.
Delaying your decision for even a year or
two can have a big impact on the amount
of income you'll have when you retire.
What's the simplest way to get started?
Save in pretax dollars and make the most
of tax deferral. There's simply no more
painless or powerful way to build a
comfortable and secure tomorrow.
