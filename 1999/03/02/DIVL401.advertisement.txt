THE
PARADOX
PART-TIME
Time Norms, Professional Life, Family and Gender
Today's professionals are caught in a time paradox: can they build careers
and families at the same time? The Part-Time Paradox explores the conflict
and tension between escalating time demands of career and family life, and
the consequences of part-time work as a solution. Epstein is Distinguished
Professor of Sociology at the Graduate Center, CUNY.
