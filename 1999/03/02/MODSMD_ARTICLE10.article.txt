# Officials blame obsolete computers
## Errors plague IRS 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The
federal agency whose threat of an
audit strikes fear in the hearts of
American taxpayers did a poor job
of keeping its own financial books
last year, congressional investiga
tors reported yesterday.
The General Accounting Office
found that the Internal Revenue
Service experienced "serious inter
nal control and financial manage
ment issues" that resulted in mil
lions of dollars in fraudulent
refunds, failure to keep track of
assets like cars and substandard
computer security controls.
"The IRS cannot do some of the
basic accounting and record-keep
ing tasks that it expects American
taxpayers to do," said Gregory
Kutz, who oversaw the audit for
GAO.
"Think of this as not balancing
your checkbook with the monthly
bank statement, and at the same
time having a system prone to
error," Kutz told the House Gov
ernment Reform Committee's
panel on government management.
IRS officials were quick to take
full responsibility for the problems,
which they said were largely rooted
in the agency's antiquated comput
er systems.

But they were clearly embar
rassed by the report, coming as it
does while the IRS attempts to
become more efficient and more
customer-friendly.
"1 am deeply disappointed that
we failed to meet our obligations,"
said Donna Cunninghame, IRS
chief financial officer. "This is unac
ceptable."'
The GAO found IRS did a good
job of collecting $1.8 trillion in tax
revenue in fiscal 1998. The prob
lems were found in the agency's
administration of an $8.1 billion
annual budget. They include:
•At least $17 million paid out in
fraudulent refunds in the first nine
months of 1998.
•Improper paperwork to keep
track of items such as a Chevrolet
Blazer, a $300,(XX) laser printer, lap
top computers, televisions and fax
machines. Most of these were
accounting errors, not thefts.
•Poor computer security, includ
ing controls on access to sensitive
taxpayer information.
•Inadequate controls over basic
financial reporting, inability to
focus on accounts most likely to
result in tax collection and failure to
reconcile IRS balances with Trea
sury Department records.
