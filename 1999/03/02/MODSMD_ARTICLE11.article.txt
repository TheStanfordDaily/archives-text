# American incomes rise

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Americans'
personal incomes increased a robust 0.6 per
cent in January, and their spending rose
moderately, reflecting a strong start for the
economy in 1999.
The increase, following a flukey 0.1 per
cent decline in December, the first in five
years, suggests Americans will have the
wherewithal to power the economic expan
sion briskly past its eighth anniversary in
March.
Personal spending in January rose 0.3
percent following a 0.7 percent surge in
December, the strongest in seven months,
the Commerce Department said yesterday.
In New York, the National Association of
Purchasing Management said manufacturing
activity surged higher in February, reversing
an eight-month decline, as production and
orders for new business improved signifi
cantly.
The Commerce Department also said the
strongest burst of highway and street build
ing in 24 years powered a 1.6 percent
increase in construction spending in January.
On Wall Street, the strong economic data
pushed interest rates higher and stock prices
dropped. By late morning, the Dow Jones
average of industrial stocks had fallen 56
points to 9,255.
The income figures, particularly Decem
ber's, were influenced by a number of special
factors. These included a decline in farm
subsidy payments in December following
one-time payments in November and cost
of-living increases in January for Social

Security recipients and federal employees.
Excluding the special factors, incomes
grew solidly in both months: 0.3 percent in
December and 0.5 percent in January. That
suggests that any slowdown from the
startling October-December economic
growth rate of 6.1 percent won't be too pre
cipitous.
The fact that Americans' incomes
increased faster than their spending in Jan
uary helped them record a positive savings
rate for only the second time in five months.
It was 0.1 percent in January, minus 0.3
percent in December and 0.6 percent in
November.
The savings rate has sunk to levels last
seen on a sustained basis during the Depres
sion because some Americans have been
spending money from their accumulated
wealth as opposed to current income.
The key component of income rose 0.7
percent in January after increasing 0.4 per
cent the month before. Government
incomes jumped 1.2 percent, reflecting the
cost-of-living increases. Income in services
advanced 0.8 percent while manufacturing
incomes rose a modest 0.2 percent.
Transfer payments such as Social Securi
ty also rose, as did rental income as did busi
ness owners' income, rental income and div
idends. Personal interest income fell.
Spending during the month was led by a
0.8 percent increase in services, followed by
a 0.3 percent rise in purchases of nondurable
goods such as food and fuel, paper products
and chemicals.
