Proposed bill on
campus military issue
shows good potential

WHEN THE U.S. House of
Representatives considers
the Campbell-Frank
Amendment next month, we urge
House members to give it their sup
port.
The proposed legislation would
repeal parts of the Solomon Amend
ment, which denies government
financial aid to students attending
schools where oil-campus military
recruitment is prohibited.
It is high time that students, who
need federal loans to support their
law school education, do not find
their financial aid predicated on their
school's willingness to abide by the
Solomon Amendment. ITiis legisla
tion requires universities to allow on
campus military job recruitment or
else risk losing government funding
for student loans and university
research projects.
Because the military will not hire
openly homosexual individuals, many
believe allowing military recruitment
on a law school's premises violates
non-discrimination policies.
While Stanford Law School's cur
rent policy of preventing employers
from recruiting 011 its premises unless
there are five interested students has
staved off the military for now. Law
School Dean Paul Brest, faculty and
students have wisely recognized the
need for a contingency plan should
the military push the issue.
The Campbell-Frank legislation
should be one aspect of such a plan.

Particularly for students who feel
strongly about upholding a policy of
non-discrimination, the Campbell-
Frank Amendment is a good first step
toward enabling students to obtain
needed federal funding without sacri
ficing their principles.
Stanford Law School should be
proud that its very own faculty mem
ber, Prof. Tom Campbell, a Republi
can representative from California's
15th District, has taken a leading role
in authoring the bill.
We hope that Stanford Law School
and the broader Stanford community
will support the Campbell-Frank
Amendment and that it will consider
taking a leading role in the crusade to
entirely overturn the Solomon
Amendment.
We recognize that this crusade may
be an uphill battle.
Recent reports in major newspa
pers have highlighted the troubles
faced by the military in competing
with private corporations, which offer
higher pay and better fringe benefits.
A Los Angeles limes report, pub
lished last week, noted that the Army
fell approximately 800 short of its
recruiting goal last year and that the
Navy missed its target by around
7.000.
While we hope the Campbell-
Frank legislation will be a precursor
to overturning the Solomon Amend
ment, we urge the Law School to con
tinue to explore targeted fundraising
as a way of safeguarding its financial
health.
Phis way, the Law School can
afford to continue standing by its
principles should there be a future
confrontation with the military over
this issue.
