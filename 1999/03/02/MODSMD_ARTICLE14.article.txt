Pete Wilson will be an asset to Hoover

I read your editorial yesterday regarding
Pete Wilson's reeent appointment to the
Hoover Institution with a combination of
dismay and disbelief. Can you really believe
that recruiting Wilson is inconsistent with
I loover's "move toward a more policy-ori
ented research fellowship"?
Wilson is not a "policy expert," you
declare.
Not an expert? True, he is not an aca
demic. but his decades of experience as a leg
islator give him perspective, credibility and
expertise that most of his colleagues at the
I loover Institution plainly lack.
Not an expert? As an assemblyman,
mayor, U.S. senator and governor, Wilson
has successfully tackled vexing policy issues
at every level of government.
Not an expert? For 30 years, he has dom
inated the political process in the nation's
largest, richest and most diverse state, defeat
ing every Democrat that has challenged him.
Not an expert? As governor, he nimbly
converted a gaping budget shortfall into a
multi-billion dollar surplus and systematical
ly drove crime rates to their lowest point
since the 145()5.
Clearly, Pete Wilson is fully qualified to
make unique and substantial contributions to
the Hoover Institution. I suspect your objec
tions to his appointment have more to do
with the second part of your editorial, in
which you attack the former governor for his
support of Propositions 187 and 2(W. Wilson
has "Ihe potential to bring discord to the

University," you fret, as if the free and vigor
ous exchange of conflicting ideas were a bad
thing.
Yes, Pete Wilson is a central participant in
several contentious debates about the
integrity of our borders, the sanctity of our
constitutional rights and the nature of the
relationship between state and federal gov
ernment. While frailer politicians have been
cowed into submission by malicious, ill
founded allegations of racism, Wilson has
courageously defied his critics and raised a
number of explosive issues that have forced
us all to reexamine our society and the laws
that govern it. Isn't this precisely the type of
free-thinking leader that universities are sup
posed to covet?
Issues of fundamental fairness are almost
always controversial and disruptive. The
Civil Rights Movement and the campaign for
women's suffrage certainly were. Why is it
that new ideas raised by liberals are consid
ered "progressive" no matter how incendiary
they might be, while those raised by conser
vatives are hurriedly dismissed as "divisive"
even when they enjoy the support of strong
majorities (like Propositions 187 and 209)?
In short, I think you're wrong. The
Hoover Institution can't "do better" than
Pete Wilson. Hut Pete Wilson could certain
ly do better than Stanford University. He
should have run for president.

I'm writing in response to Janice Strong's
letter on Feb. 25 regarding an article in The
Daily about former Governor Pete Wilson's
decision to come to Stanford ("Pete Wilson
named Hoover fellow"). In that letter,
Strong objected strenuously to what she
called "misleading language" in the article's
description of Proposition 209. While she
may feel that "prevention of discrimination"
is a biased characterization of Proposition
209's intent, 1 would suggest that it may be
impossible to describe policies in this area
without incorporating some form of bias.
What are our alternatives? "Reverse dis
crimination" would certainly offend some,
and "positive discrimination" is probably not
much better.
People sometimes refer to "race and gen
der-based preferences," but I suspect this is
not universally viewed as entirely neutral
either.
Beyond these, I would go further to say
that the term "affirmative action" is equally
biased. While many may feel comfortable
with this term, it is most certainly biased with
its inherently positive characterization of
these policies.
Clearly, it is difficult to remain entirely
neutral when discussing certain issues. Of
course, within the University community,
neutrality is not ultimately what we seek.
Instead, in my view, we should seek a civi
lized dialogue characterized by tolerance for
those whose opinions differ from our own.
Presumably Strong's objection to The

Daily's choice of words stems from a desire
to have her views tolerated and respected.
However, in that light, I can see no justifi
cation for baseless personal insult of the for
mer governor, whom she called "cowardly"
for supporting Proposition 209. Where is the
cowardice in supporting something in which
you believe? And how can we expect toler
ance if we do not give it?
Unfortunately, in my experience, the
environment at Stanford has not always been
entirely open-minded when it comes to polit
ical debate. In place of tolerance and respect,
I have on occasion seen prejudice and antag
onism. For this reason, I have been extreme
ly grateful for the strong, sensible leadership
of the University's current administration.
While University President Gerhard Casper
did indeed act quickly to make it clear that
Proposition 209 would not affect Stanford
(which was a statement of fact), both he and
Provost Condoleezza Rice have done a
remarkable job over the years of articulating
their view that it is not the University's place
to take positions on political issues.
In closing, I'd like to welcome former
Governor Wilson to Stanford, because
whether or not we as individuals happen to
agree with particular policies he has pursued,
I strongly believe that he has valuable contri
butions to make to the University communi
