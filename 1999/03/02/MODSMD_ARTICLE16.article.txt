# Sprinkle cool patience
## Atiba Pertilla A 						different kind of travel 
### 
IT WAS A warm
March day, a
reminder that spring
was coming — that we
would be leaving soon.
The three of us had just
bought our lunch from the
better of Florence's two

falafel stands, and we ate carefully, sitting
on the curb of the sidewalk, hoping to keep
the grease and yogurt from running down
the wax paper wrapping and onto our
clothes. We were a stubborn obstacle in the
midst of an eddy of parents strolling with
their children and old women doing their
afternoon shopping. We tried to decide
whether it was for the best that the quarter
was almost over and that soon, we would be
going back to the United States.
I was ready to leave. I had been in Italy
for three months and, loving it for what it
was, I had had my fill. My first days had
been spent in total immersion, living in a
cheap hotel near the train station in Rome.
On my first walk through the city I came
upon a junkie huddled between two cars
about to give himself a dose of heroin, rub
ber tubing stretched tautly across his right
bicep, his left hand grasping the needle,
wavering only a little bit.
I walked on, trying not to let the scene
fall into focus, not willing to accept that I
was more alone than I had ever been before
in my life; although 1 might have accepted
the same scene in New York, might even
have expected it. But somehow the distance
of six time zones had warped my ability to
accept a moment of banal tragedy.
We think of travel in terms of the differ

ence between where we are at present and
our eventual destination, our awareness of
the magnitude of the alteration usually
dependent on the limits of our forewarning.
Some people have favorite places they
return to year after year, eager to visit the
same sights, do the same activities, maybe
even talk with the same people. I think of
travel in terms of the unfamiliar. What fas
cinates me about my favorite cities is all I
haven't seen of them.
I saw the man on the point of getting his
fix and realized that Rome wasn't that dif
ferent from New York after all. Maybe,
having come to Italy expecting my days to
alternate between scenes from the films
"Enchanted April" and "La Dolce Vita," I
should have expected, instead, only the
commonplace. We cling unreasonably to
the idea that the destination is somehow, by
virtue of its difference, bound to be better,
almost indescribably so.
The traveler's hope for delight or edifi
cation in a longed-for place creates the mys
tique of the unknown and, as others bring
back reports of the fabled land, its attrac
tion grows and it is assigned a particular set
of virtues and vices: Germans are abrupt;
Texans are obsessed with size.
We convince ourselves that if we stay
long enough in those other places, we will
adopt their unique way of life — that leav
ing behind our native habits is as easy as
emerging from a chrysalis. Meanwhile,
expatriates forsake their native places in
search of affirmation only to rediscover that
people are much the same: contractors dis
appoint, neighbors are mean, some mar
riages fall apart. Many authors have man-

aged to create a cottage industry of this
epiphany.
But there's more. We fight wars over
what we can call ours and what is theirs,
even when it is only a barren stretch of unin
habited land. We look away as a republic
falls apart and reach the conclusion that it is
"ethnic hatred," simmering away through
centuries of coexistence and intermarriage.
We convince ourselves that living some
where different is tantamount to being
something different, that we can never
bridge the fundamental divide between our
human nature and theirs.
It's all for the best to visit new places, to
see new things, eat the food and even drink
the water. Even amidst the monuments and
the commonplace I had my moments of
wonder, like coming upon the Piazza
dell'Esedra one morning, its fountain
sheathed in scaffolding, the pavement still
slick with the previous night's rainfall, the
sky a brilliant pale blue. That day in Flo
rence, I tried to explain to my friends that
what I had learned in Italy was that I was
irrevocably American, with all the ambigui
ty and the limitless possibility that label
implies. At the time I thought it was only a
small thing to have realized. But the
moments of greatest surprise are those that
come from within, that were waiting to be
discovered all along.

Pinti to anyone passing through Florence,
as long as it hasn't been shut down.
