â–  Saturday: No. 4 California 5. No. 5
Stanford (3-1,10-2)4.

Saturday's match couldn't have
been closer, decided by the after
noon's final doubles encounter.
A series of straight-set singles
victories brought the match to 3-2
by mid-afternoon. Junior captain
and 9th-ranked Teryn Ashley dom
inated Cal's feisty Anita Kurimay at
the No. 2 singles position, 6-3, 6-1.

Lastra and KeikoTokuda all lost at
the 3rd, 4th, and 6th singles posi
tions, respectively.
Playing No. 5 singles, junior Jen
nifer Heiser overwhelmed Cal's
Karoline Borgerson, 6-2. 6-0 to
keep the Cardinal in contention.
The most dramatic contest, how

ever, lasted over two hours and kept
spectators on the edge of their seats
throughout the afternoon.
Freshman Marissa Irvin. ranked
second in the nation, found herself
in a precarious position against
Cal's Amanda Augustus in the No.
1 singles match.
The hard-hitting Irvin overpow
ered Augustus in the first set. and
her brilliant play earned her a 6-4
triumph.
The counter-punching Augustus
flustered Irvin with her gritty deter
mination and strong passing shots in
the second set.
With Augustus leading 5-4. Irvin
and Augustus played a multiple
deuce, nail-biting 10th game. Irvin
attacked the net courageously, only
to often find herself the victim of
Augustus' relentless defensive play.
Irvin's aggression finally paid off
as she took the next two games for a
6-5 lead, leaving Augustus looking
despondent.
Both squads stood courtside and
cheered and the crowd grew more
vocal. Surprisingly, the resourceful
Augustus rebounded, and took the
set in a tie-breaker as an over-ag
gressive Irvin committed a slew of
forehand errors.
Irvin displayed tremendous re
silience in the third set. however.

and calmly put Augustus away for a
6-4,6-7 (2-7), 6-3 victory.
Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan was thrilled with Irvin's
play.
"She's learning to win tough
matches and grind it out." he said.
"She's really maturing and figuring
out how to beat opponents when
she's not playing her best tennis or
when they are playing their best ten
nis."
With the dual match tied at 3-3,
the doubles competition became
crucial. At the No. 3 spot, the team
of Heiser/Tokuda fell to Cal's Borg
erson/Jenny Lee, 8-6.

and Kalvaria, however, looked
pumped after their singles losses,
putting together some sparkling net
play and nailing countless over
heads in an S-4 triumph over the
Bears' Curran/Kurimay.
"It was the best doubles I've seen
all season," Brennan said.
Lastra agreed.
"I was a little sluggish for the sin
gles," she said. "But I redeemed my
self in the doubles."
Unfortunately, the duo's victory
wasn't enough, as Cal's top team of
Augustus and Amy Jensen out
