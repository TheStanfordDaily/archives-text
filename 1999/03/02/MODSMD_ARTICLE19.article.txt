In lacrosse, as in life, speed kills.
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
taught UC-Davis that lesson emphatically
this weekend as a freshman-sparked offense
and tough goaltending led the Cardinal to a
10-2 victory on Saturday.

■ Saturday: Stanford (1-1) 10, UC- Davis Ag
gies (1-1)2.

The weekend rout was a rematch of last
year's Western Women's Lacrosse League
Championship, in which Stanford (1-1) came
back from a 6-2 halftime deficit to win, 10-8.
This contest was to hold no such drama.

though, as the Cardinal jumped out to an
early lead and hung onto it for the remainder
of the game.
The Aggies (1-1) were clearly outmatched
in team speed, and the Stanford defenders
took full advantage of the mismatch. The
young defense, led by freshman Jenny Silver
man, exhibited none of the holes or mistakes
of last weekend's loss to California. Instead,
tenacious midfield defense, forced turnovers
and stellar play by veteran senior goaltender
Stephanie Tuerk (13 saves) held Davis to two
goals, both in the second half.
"I think we knew we definitely had some
thing to prove," said senior captain Carey
Jones. "If we're expecting to repeat the
WWLL Championship, we need to play like

we're the best team in the league,
which means decisively beating all
our competitors."
Davis, on the ropes for much of
the first half, showed signs of life
midway through the second half
when the Aggies' Jenna Rivett
blasted an underhand shot past
Tuerk with 18 minutes, 51 seconds
left to make the score 7-1.
On the next Davis possession.
Cardinal freshman Caroline Oster
wise drew a yellow card and the
momentum appeared to be shifting
the Aggies' way.
Stanford came back strong,
though, with two goals within a
minute. The second, Jones' lone
goal of the game, showcased Stan
ford's physical domination of the
game, as sophomore star
Katharine Barnes (one goal, one
assist) controlled the draw and
passed to Jones, who drove straight

through a crowd of Davis defend
ers and fired a shot past Davis
goalie Kate McCall to make the
score 9-1.
The real story of the game, how
ever, was the strong play from the
Stanford freshman class.
"The spark [for the game] came
from the four freshmen Liz Britt,
Caroline Osterwise, Sarah Lev and
Jenny Silverman, who all had the
game of their lives," said Stanford
head coach Heidi Connor.
"1 was impressed with the com
posure of the freshman who played
in only their second college Divi
sion I game," Jones said. "Our of
fense as a unit looked as good as
I've ever seen it."
Osterwise (two goals), Britt
(one goal). Lev (two goals) and Sil
verman (two goals) together ac
counted for seven out of the Cardi
nal's 10 goals. The freshmen's de
fensive contributions were also
critical to holding the physical Ag
gies offense to a scant two scores.
"We played with a lot of heart

today and we played well as a
team," said Silverman. "We moved
the ball around well. Having our
two biggest games at the beginning
of the season forced us to come to
gether and reach a higher level
than we've had in the past; maybe
not a peak, but a higher level."
"It has been really interesting
having 11 freshmen, but new faces
are something we're used to seeing
every year," said senior captain
Alexis Patrizio.
"The difference this year is that
I think these freshmen are going to
be players to watch for the next
four years."
Stanford's strong opening
seemed to catch Davis off guard, as
all five goals scored in the first half
came in the first 10 minutes. The
offense seemed to stall late in the
half as the Aggie defenders collect
ed themselves, but Lev's second
goal with 21:16 left in the second
half opened the floodgates for
Stanford's second-half scoring flur
