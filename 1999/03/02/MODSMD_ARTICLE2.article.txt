## Provost lends foreign policy expertise 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
Provost Condoleezza Rice demonstrat
ed her political savvy as an adviser to Presi
dent Bush. Now she is using her experience
to help Bush's son. Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, as he ponders a possible presidential
bid.
"I've been playing an organizing role."
said Rice, calling her involvement with the
governor "pretty minimal" due in part to

the time commitment of
her duties at Stanford.
"I'm close to
Gov. Bush, I like him.
and I undoubtedly will
try to find ways to help
him." said Rice. But she
called any speculation
on her role in a presiden-

tial campaign premature, "until he decides
what to do. until I'm no longer provost."
Rice announced in December that she
would take a leave of absence from Stan
ford. stepping down in June from the
provost position she has held since 1993.
Rice said she first began discussions with
Gov. Bush last August.
"This all started on a fishing boat in Ken
nebunkport." said Rice, explaining that she
began talking about foreign policy with

Gov. Bush while she was visiting his father,
former President George Hush, in Maine.
Since that time she said she has been in
contact with the Republican governor, pro
viding background and coordinating meet
ings for the younger Bush with other foreign
policy experts. She has flown to Austin, the
capital of Texas, twice this year to meet with
Bush.
"[Gov. Bush] considers her a friend."
said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the
Governor. "She's a smart conservative
thinker, and he's grateful to have her ad
vice."
Rice, an expert on Soviet and Eastern
European politics, served in President
Bush's administration from 1989 through
1991, helping guide U.S. policy during the


Rice
end of the Cold War and the reunifi
cation of Germany.
"I'm not anxious to go back to
Washington," said Rice, saying she
would like to work in the private sec
tor. But she said she would not rule
out the possibility of working with
Bush in a substantial capacity if he
does run for president. "We'll cross
that bridge if we come to it." she said.
Bush is meeting with a number of
other advisors besides Rice, includ
ing some with Stanford ties. Earlier
this year Bush met with Hoover Dis
tinguished Fellow George Schultz.
Hoover Senior Fellow John Cogan,
an economist who worked in the
Reagan administration, has also
made the trek to the Texas capital.
"I think it's very important for
Stanford professors knowledgeable
in their area to contribute to candi
dates' knowledge base," said Cogan.
He added that he has met with Bush

three times this year to discuss such
topics as Social Security, the federal
budget and Medicare. Cogan said he
was "perfectly happy" at Stanford
and has no plans to leave the Farm.
Bush has stated that he will not
make a formal decision on a presi
dential hid until the Texas legislature
adjourns in May. But Reuters report
ed yesterday that Bush is expected to
announce the formation of an ex
ploratory committee today. An ex
ploratory committee can raise funds
and is traditionally viewed as the first
step in political campaign.
Many Rebublicans have urged
Bush to run, and a February poll of
Ohio voters him a 16 percent lead
over Vice President AIC lore.
However. Rice said that Bush is
concerned about how a presidential
bid will affect his family.
"To say [Barbara and Jenna, his
twin teenage daughters] aren't crazy
about the idea is an understatement,"
said Rice, adding that the governor
felt a strong commitment to the state
of Texas as well.
