# Polo takes second place at UCSB
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
After winning its first three
matches, the third-ranked Stanford
women's water polo team came
away with a second-place finish
from the UC-Santa Barbara
Women's Open Tournament last
weekend, eventually losing to the
No. 1 USC Trojans in the champi
onship game.
While the two-day tournament
left the Cardinal just shy of the gold,
Stanford was provided with some
valuable experience that will help
shape the rest of the season.
"Overall, we did a pretty good
job this weekend, even though we
really wanted to win [the tourna
ment]," said junior driver Elissa

Keszler. "But I think a loss this early
in the season is only going to help.
Every time you lose, you see your
strengths and weaknesses and you
can focus on them in practice until
they get better."

WOMEN'S WATERPOLO

■ Friday- Sunday: No. 3 Stanford
took second hi UC- Santa Barbara
Women's Open Tournament.

Stanford (9-2, 2-0 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) started out
the weekend with a 13-2 win over
Occidental. The Cardinal scored 11
points in the first half alone, on its
way to the victory. Nine Cardinal
players contributed goals, including
senior Nicole Glazer, junior Elissa
Keszler, sophomore Anne-Marie

Keenan and freshman Kate Pettit,
who each scored twice.
In the quarterfinals, the Cardinal
took on No. 13 UC-San Diego. Once
again. Stanford took a quick lead,
led by freshman Margie Dingeldein
who scored three for the team. The
Cardinal's offense dominated the
match, especially during the second
and third quarters when Stanford
outscored UCSD 4-1 and 4-0.
Both of the Saturday games gave
the players and the coaching staff
the chance to evaluate the effective
ness of various combinations and
strategies.
"It was good to be able to practice
the fundamentals and fine tune
some areas of our play," Keszler
said.
And Stanford was also able to
demonstrate its depth across the
board, with 11 different players scor
ing in the first two matches. The Car
dinal offense was led by Dingeldein
and sophomore Kelly Shouey, who
scored seven and five goals, respec
tively, over the course of the week
end. Keenan, who scored four goals,
was also instrumental.
On Sunday, however, the compe
tition got more intense and goals
were not as easy to come by for the
Cardinal.
In the semifinal match, Stanford
overcame No. 2 California's talent
ed squad — and a two point deficit in
the first half — in an intense match

up of the Bay-area rivals.
"Beating Cal was a really good
step for the team," Keszler said.
But it wasn't an easy step.
Cal scored the lone goal of the
first period and led the Cardinal 3-1
at halftime. But a three-goal rally in
the third quarter, along with a defen
sive shutout of the Golden Bear's at
tack, gave Stanford an edge.
"We were down and all of a sud
den something happened with our
team. You could feel it," Keszler
said. In the final period of play,
Stanford notched the last goal of the
game to give the Cardinal the 5-3 vic
tory. Dingeldein led the Stanford of
fense with two goals. Keenan, Pettit
and Shouey also contributed points
to the win.
The final match of the weekend
pitted Stanford against the top
ranked USC squad. While Glazer

scored the first goal of the game for
the Cardinal, the Trojans responded
with two goals in the first quarter to
take the lead.
It was a lead the Stanford team
would never be able to overcome.
"In the final game, we set our
selves up a lot on offense, but we
couldn't put it away," Keszler said.
Both teams scored once in the
second quarter, but the third period
saw three unanswered Trojan goals.
Although the Cardinal rallied with
two fourth quarter scores, Stanford
couldn't close the gap and USC took
home a 7-4 victory and the tourna
ment title.
"To be successful during games
we're going to have to execute what
we do in practice," Keszler said.
"And if we do what we plan to do and
what we want to do - and if we do it
smoothly - then we're going to win."
