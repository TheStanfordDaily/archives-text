## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
After winning its first three
matches, the third-ranked Stanford
women's water polo team came
away with a second-place finish
from the UC-Santa Barbara
Women's Open Tournament last
weekend, eventually losing to the
No. 1 USC Trojans in the champi
onship game.
While the two-day tournament
left the Cardinal just shy of the gold,
Stanford was provided with some
valuable experience that will help
shape the rest of the season.
"Overall, we did a pretty good
job this weekend, even though we
really wanted to win [the tourna
ment]," said junior driver Elissa

Keszler. "But I think a loss this early
in the season is only going to help.
Every time you lose, you see your
strengths and weaknesses and you
can focus on them in practice until
they get better."

WOMEN'S WATERPOLO

â–  Friday- Sunday: No. 3 Stanford
took second hi UC- Santa Barbara
Women's Open Tournament.

Stanford (9-2, 2-0 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) started out
the weekend with a 13-2 win over
Occidental. The Cardinal scored 11
points in the first half alone, on its
way to the victory. Nine Cardinal
players contributed goals, including
senior Nicole Glazer, junior Elissa
Keszler, sophomore Anne-Marie

Keenan and freshman Kate Pettit,
who each scored twice.
In the quarterfinals, the Cardinal
took on No. 13 UC-San Diego. Once
again. Stanford took a quick lead,
led by freshman Margie Dingeldein
who scored three for the team. The
Cardinal's offense dominated the
match, especially during the second
and third quarters when Stanford
outscored UCSD 4-1 and 4-0.
Both of the Saturday games gave
the players and the coaching staff
the chance to evaluate the effective
ness of various combinations and
strategies.
"It was good to be able to practice
the fundamentals and fine tune
some areas of our play," Keszler
