The Stanford women's swim
ming and diving teams proved that
they deserve a hit of historical signif
icance last weekend as they sus
tained their monopoly on Pacific 10
Conference first-place trophies.
In the 13 years since the confer
ence's inception, the Cardinal has
never lost a Pac-10 Championship.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING

â–  Thursday-Saturday: Stanford took
first at Pac-10 Championships in
Seattle.

Never.
Now, after a dual-meet season
fraught with injury and illness, Stan
ford is still undisputedly the best in
the west.
Saturday, the third day of compe
tition at Weyerhauser/King swim
ming complex in Federal Way,
Wash., the Cardinal put victory out
of reach for California and a small
host of challengers throne.
"This year we didn't know what
to expect [at Pac-l()s]," said senior
co-captain Elin Austevoll. "We def
initely didn't expect to run over peo

pie."
But the Cardinal, with the help of
Austevoll's two victories, did run
over people, not to mention a few
teams.
In a meet that was hyped to be the
possible downfall of the Stanford
juggernaut, the Cardinal crushed its
nearest opponents by more than 300
points. After three days of competi
tion, Stanford reigned once again
with 1,533 points to USC's 1.177.5,
Cal's 1,155.5 and Arizona's 1,136.5.
From day one, the Cardinal
showed it was the team to beat.
After a disappointing third-place
finish in the 200-yard freestyle relay,
Stanford started its march to victory
with two stellar performances in the
500-yard freestyle.
Sophomore Misty Hyman placed
second behind USC star distance
swimmer Lindsay Benko in a sea
son's best time of 4:43.10.
Hyman was followed by Stanford
freshman Jessica Foschi, whose
third-place time of 4:45.73 qualified
her for the NCAA championships
and helped spark her team's com
petitive spirit.
The Cardinal's Catherine Fox
put an exclamation point on Thurs
day's competition by taking the 50-

yard freestyle for the second straight
year. Most impressively, though,
was the fact that Fox won the event
without having "tapered."or rested
in preparation for the meet.
Friday's competition started out
with a dominating performance by
the Stanford's diving squad. In the
three-meter competition. Cardinal
divers took first, second and fourth.
Sophomore Kim Powers won the
event, followed hy senior Carissa
Zenorini in second and sophomore
Erin Sones in fourth.
Hyman then worked her magic in
the l(X)-yard butterfly. She outswam
the field by nearly a second en route
to notching her second victory in as
many years. Her time of 52.38 was
just shy of her best of the season.
The highlight of Friday's events,
however, was Austevoll's record
setting performance in the l(X)-vard
breaststroke.
Austevoll seemed to forget that
she has typically been a stronger
swimmer in the 2(H) and swam an
amazing time of 1:01.01. Along with
being the former Norwegian
Olympian with the fastest career
time, the swimmer also set a Pac-10
