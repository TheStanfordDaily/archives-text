# Joe knows
## Borchard is two-sport star for Card 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Stanford never had Bo Jackson. Deion Sanders
never wore cardinal and white. However, in the last 30
years, Stanford has proven that it knows two-sport
athletes, especially those prime-timers who play both
football and baseball, better than anyone.
Stanford's prominent football-baseball players in
clude Cincinnati Reds' catcher Brian Johnson. Tampa
Bay Buccaneers' Pro-Bowl safety John Lynch, and the
great Denver Broncos quarterback and Super Bowl
XXXIII MVP John Elway.
Even baseball head coach Mark Marquess, who
played first base for the Cardinal from 1967-69. was
also a gridiron star at Stanford.
After Chad Hutchinson, Stanford's two-year start
ing quarterback and AII-American pitcher, signed
with the St. Louis Cardinals last summer, yet another
player was ready to continue the long tradition of jug
gling two time consuming sports — Joe Borchard.
Borchard, a sophomore right fielder and backup
quarterback, might not have the greatness of Elway or
raw talent of Hutchinson however, his unsurpassed
discipline and focus are paving the way for him to be
come as successful as any two-sport athlete at Stan
ford.
To be a two-sport athlete "is very demanding, aca
demically and athletically." Marquess said. "But he's
got a tremendous work ethic and he's done a great job.
"He's a complete player and he's very competitive.
He's real special. He's a great athlete and he's going to
be a phenomenal player for us."
Borchard. a 6-foot-4 195 pound, power-hitter, does
not talk much about his accomplishments and when he
does, gives most of the credit toothers. However, after
one season of football and well into his second year of
baseball, he has begun to prove that he has the talent
to be among the nation's best in both sports.
This year Borchard is already hitting .360 with three
home runs and 14 RHIs. Asa freshman he hit .330 with
10 home runs and 55 RBls. Borchard alsoshinedin the
postseason. In three games he hit .545 with two home
runs and two doubles and was the only Cardinal to be

named to the West Regional All-
Tournament Team.
In his redshirt freshman football
season, Borchard emerged as the
backup to junior Todd Husak. As
the season progressed, he began to
see more playing time, accumulat
ing 317 passing yards, completing
21 of 48 attempts. His 41-yard run
against North Carolina set up the
game-winning field goal in Stan
ford's 37-34 upset.
Borchard had been a successful
multi-sport athlete throughout his
youth. But with a little help from
his dad he began to concentrate on
baseball and football at Camarillo
High School.
In eighth grade his father helped
him build a batting cage. Daily bat
ting practice sessions and games of
catch in the backyard helped him
to further hone his hitting stroke
and football-throwing motion.
The extra practice propelled
Borchard to all-league honors in
baseball two years in a row and to a
stellar senior football campaign for
which he was named CIF Division

11l Player of the Year.
"The first time [any college]
called me or 1 took a visit, I made it
clear that I wanted to play both in
college," said Borchard, who was
recruited by California, Arizona
and Texas, among others. "But,
Stanford's history of two-sport ath
letes and the academics really put
me over."
According to Marquess, Stan
ford's success with two-sport ath
letes is because of the extra effort
the athletics department puts into
accommodating their schedules.
Last year. Borchard did not at
tend any spring football workouts
and struggled all summer to catch
up with Husak and the highly tout
ed redshirt freshman Randy
Fasani. This year, though, Bor
chard will leave baseball practice
early on non-game days to partic
ipate in spring football.
*'11 Joe opted to not take part in
spring ball, it would give Todd and
Randy the chance to widen the gap
with him," said offensive coordina
tor and quarterbacks coach Bill
Diedrick. "Those repetitions he
will get in spring ball are going to
help him tremendously. If he
missed that, he could never make it

up."
While Borchard's participation
in spring football will take away
from his baseball time, he said he
does not look upon his time spent
away from either sport as time
wasted.
"It may seem like I'm hurting
one sport by not doing it enough."
he said. "But. the way I look at it is
that I have the ability to play both
sports well, so I should."
Although he does not like to dis
cuss it. Borchard will have to make
a decision between the two sports
at some point in the next few years.
Odds are that Borchard will
choose baseball. He has had much
more experience and success on
the diamond and will likely be a
high pick in next June's amateur
baseball draft.
But. Borchard still says he does
not have a favorite sport and does
not want to make any premature
statements.
Five years down the road, he
said, he hopes to be "playing some
thing. of some sort, somewhere."
Or, if that falls through, he
wants to become a history teacher
and coach. A baseball and football
coach of course.
