# Joe knows
## Borchard is two-sport star for Card 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Stanford never had Bo Jackson. Deion Sanders
never wore cardinal and white. However, in the last 30
years, Stanford has proven that it knows two-sport
athletes, especially those prime-timers who play both
football and baseball, better than anyone.
Stanford's prominent football-baseball players in
clude Cincinnati Reds' catcher Brian Johnson. Tampa
Bay Buccaneers' Pro-Bowl safety John Lynch, and the
great Denver Broncos quarterback and Super Bowl
XXXIII MVP John Elway.
Even baseball head coach Mark Marquess, who
played first base for the Cardinal from 1967-69. was
also a gridiron star at Stanford.
After Chad Hutchinson, Stanford's two-year start
ing quarterback and AII-American pitcher, signed
with the St. Louis Cardinals last summer, yet another
player was ready to continue the long tradition of jug
gling two time consuming sports â€” Joe Borchard.
Borchard, a sophomore right fielder and backup
quarterback, might not have the greatness of Elway or
raw talent of Hutchinson however, his unsurpassed
discipline and focus are paving the way for him to be
come as successful as any two-sport athlete at Stan
ford.
To be a two-sport athlete "is very demanding, aca
demically and athletically." Marquess said. "But he's
got a tremendous work ethic and he's done a great job.
"He's a complete player and he's very competitive.
He's real special. He's a great athlete and he's going to
be a phenomenal player for us."
Borchard. a 6-foot-4 195 pound, power-hitter, does
not talk much about his accomplishments and when he
does, gives most of the credit toothers. However, after
one season of football and well into his second year of
baseball, he has begun to prove that he has the talent
to be among the nation's best in both sports.
This year Borchard is already hitting .360 with three
home runs and 14 RHIs. Asa freshman he hit .330 with
10 home runs and 55 RBls. Borchard alsoshinedin the
postseason. In three games he hit .545 with two home
runs and two doubles and was the only Cardinal to be
