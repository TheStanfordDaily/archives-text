■ Friday-Saturday: Stanford (13-4)
took the consolation prize in Na
tional Fastpitch Coaches Associa
tion Leadoff Classis.

"We are coming together and
starting to play some consistent
softball." said Cardinal coach John
Rittman.

The Stanford soft hall team
proved its tenacity this past week
end at the NFC A tournament, im
proving its reeord to (13-4). The
Cardinal went 4-2 on the weekend,
taking home the consolation prize.
In the first game of the tourna
ment. No. 14 Stanford squared up
against No. 15 Oklahoma State.
Having lost to the Cowgirls Inst
May in the NCAA Regional
Championship game, the Cardinal
was looking for revenge. Much to
their chagrin, the Cardinal women
came up short in their hid for a win.
falling to Oklahoma St. 4-3. De
spite striking out four, allowing
only two earned runs and giving up
just seven hits, senior pitcher
Marcy Crouch took the loss for the
Cardinal.
In true form though, the Cardi
nal pulled together after the loss to
Oklahoma State and bounced back
with a convincing win over North
east Louisiana.
Senior Becky Blevins, in her
sixth win of the season, allowed
just two hits while striking out
seven.
Also, freshman sensation Jessi
ca Mendoza extended her impres
sive hitting streak to 11 games by
going 2 for 2 with a double and two
RBIs.
Stanford began Saturday by
handing Central Michigan its sec
ond loss of the season by a score of
4-0.
In the last game of pool play,
freshman Sarah Beeson hit her sec
ond homer of the season, in the
fifth inning, to put Central Michi
gan away.
Next up for the Cardinal was
No. 4 Washington. The Huskies,

who hold an impressive 13-1
record, combined strong pitching,
fielding and hitting in the win over
Stanford. Second baseman Robin
Walker had the only hit of the
game for the Cardinal.
Like it had the day before, Stan
ford rallied back. In the first round
of the Gold Medal Bracket. Stan
ford again took on the Cowgirls of
Oklahoma State.
Three times proved to be the
charm as the Cardinal rallied 5-1
for the win. Beeson shined in the
game with three RBIs and two hits
— one of which was a two-run
homer in the fifth inning. Blevins
allowed just one hit in her eighth
win of the season.
The Cardinal neatly tied up all
the loose ends in the title game
against South Carolina. Crouch's
perfect pitching, combined with
the team's strong offensive perfor
mance, carried the Cardinal to vic
tory.
Stanford next goes to Fullerton,
Calif., for the Cal State Fullerton
Showcase Tournament. Excited
about his team's continual im
provement, Rittman added, "We
are going to take what we learned
in Columbus and take it with us
this weekend."
