### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
The No. I men's tennis team rebounded
well from its first loss in 46 matches by
going to Berkeley and convincingly beating
California 6-1 on Saturday. The Cardinal
got oil to a slow start by losing the doubles
point, but was able to raise its intensity and
level of play to sweep all six singles match
es.

■ Saturday: No. I Stanford 6, California I

It was a weekend in which the top
ranked Cardinal was hoping to have a re
match against No. 5 Illinois, which ended
the Cardinal's winning streak the week be
fore with a 4-3 win in the semifinals of the
Team Indoor Championships. Illinois,
however, canceled the match on Friday due
to having several players out with the flu.
The Cardinal was able to put its frustration
aside and play solid tennis on Saturday
against ( al.
Despite the easy victory, the team was
not pleased with its doubles play and real
izes doubles is something it needs to work

on as the NCAAs approach in May.
"We got off to a slow start again in dou
bles," said Stanford head coach Dick
Gould. "Right now that is our Achilles
heal. We let the No. 1 doubles slip away and
our No. 3 doubles were not on their game at
all. But 1 was pleased with the way we came
back in singles. In general it was a solid ef
fort."
In the No. 1 doubles match senior Ryan
Wolters and freshman K.J. Hippensteel
were serving at 7-3 before dropping six
straight games to lose 9-7. Cal broke serve
three consecutive times, something one
rarely sees in a doubles match.
"Once we lost serve at 7-3 we could just
sort of see it slowly slipping away from us,"
Wolters said. "It kept on building and get
ting worse and worse. It was one of the most
frustrating doubles matches 1 have ever
been a part of."
Despite their frustrating loss, both
Wolters and Hippensteel came back strong
in the singles. Hippensteel lost his serve to
begin his singles match and was down 2-0
before going on to win in straight sets.
Wolters took charge in his singles match
and also won in straight sets.
"Ryan and K.J. showed some heart by

playing such good singles," Gould said.
" That is not easy to do after a loss like they
had in the doubles. K.J. got down early in
his singles, hut instead of letting it get him
even more down he fought hard to come
back."
Sophomore Alex Kim and junior Geoff
Abrams played solid all-around tennis by
first winning their doubles match and then
going on to win in straight sets in singles.
Kim, who had been forced to miss two
weeks with a stress fracture in his left shin,
continued to build his strength and get back
into match condition.
"I felt better than I did the week before
at the Indoors, but I still need some time to
get to full strength," Kin said. Each match
and each practice I seem to get a little
stronger, though."
Kim said that the Saturday match
against Cal felt a lot like the Cardinal's first
round Indoors match against Oklahoma. In
that match the Cardinal also came out flat
in the doubles and dropped the point be
fore realizing it needed to wake up and
raise its level in the singles.
The team hopes to huild on its victory
when it takes on Utah at home today, which
is the last team match until spring break.
