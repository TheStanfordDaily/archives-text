ference) 194.050, N0.9 Stanford (8-3,
4-2) 193.425

The Cardinal came into Friday's
competition looking to build on its
best performance of the season two
weeks ago against Arizona State. It
left the Mckale Center, however,
disappointed and frustrated with the
loss.
Stanford senior co-captain Amy
Murakami finished second in the
floor exercise I >.<S2s but saw her four
match winning streak on the uneven
parallel bars snapped as the Wildcats
swept the top-three spots on that ap
paratus. Murakami entered Friday's
competition ranked fourth national
ly in the uneven parallel bars.

But despite the frustration of the
meet, there were some bright spots
for the Cardinal.
Sophomore .len Exaltation
turned in yet another solid perfor
mance against the Wildcats en route
to a first-place finish in the vaulting
competition (9.775) and a second
place finish on the balance beam
(9.850) behind freshman katv Her
bert's 9.875. Last week against the
Sun Devils, Exaltacion broke a
school record on the balance beam
and won two other events.
Besides Exaltacion, junior Sarah
Harding and senior Tracey Kohl
posted winning scores for the Cardi
nal. Harding took home first-place
honors in the floor exercise with an
artistic routine that earned a 9.875
from the judges. Kohl finished in a
tie for second place in the vaulting
competition with a 9.675.
Stanford head coach Mark Cook,
however, felt the meet was plagued
by controversial officiating.
"In a subjective sport, officiating
takes on a different element where
little deductions when added up can
create a one to two point spread in
the evaluations of routines," said
Cook, who protested six of the offi
cials' scoring decisions.
The Cardinal returns to action on
March 12th when it hosts Massachu
setts in Burnham Pavilion at 7:30
p.m.
