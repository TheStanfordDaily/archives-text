■ Friday-Saturday: No. 13 Stanford
took fourth of five teams in UCLA
Invitational.

No. 10 BYIJ easily took Thurs
day's meet, finishing with a final
score of 223.85. No. 12 California
finished a distant second, trailing
the Cougars by more than five
points — finishing with a final score
of 218.40. Furthermore, the Cardi
nal finished behind UCLA—a club
team — which finished third in the
competition with a final score of
212.15.
The difference for the Cardinal
was the parallel bar competition,
where it had only three gymnasts
compete, shy of the mandatory
number of competitors, and there
fore had to count a score of 0.00.
And while Stanford struggled,
the star of the show was UCLA
gymnast Jim Foody who brought
home the all-around title, won the

high bar and vault competitions and
finished in the top three in every
event with the exception of the
pommel horse and floor exercise
competitions.
California senior co-captain
Alexander Nissen saw his undefeat
ed streak in all-around competition
come to an end as he failed to place
in the top three in any event except
the high bar.
Stanford freshman Adam
Berkenbile was a bright spot for the
Cardinal on the weekend, though,
turning in stellar performances in
both meets, capturing the title in the
floor exercise at the UCLA Invita
tional and the pommel horse at the
UCSB Invitational.
The Cardinal dominated the
pommel horse in both competi
tions, sweeping the top-three posi
tions at the UCSB Invitational and
taking two of the top-three places at
the UCLA Invitational, where it
easily beat UCSB. but fell behind
New Mexico.
The C ardinal's score, 223.90, was
a season high and trailed New Mex
ico's winning score by less than .20.
Stanford continues to demon
strate marked improvement, espe
cially in the performances of the
freshmen on the team.
Next up for the Cardinal is the
New Mexico Invitational where its
competition will include Air Force,
Arizona State, New Mexico and
Ohio — four teams it has yet to
meet this season.
