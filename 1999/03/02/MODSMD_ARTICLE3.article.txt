# Art struggles with new demands
## Students cite organizational obstacles

Although Stanford now boasts the
expansive Iris & B. Gerald Cantor
Center for Visual Arts, the I 'niversity
Art and Art History Department con

tmues to experience growing pains.
The number of the department's de
clared majors has roughly doubled, up
from about 50. in the past live years.
There are currently 51 art history ma
jors and 45 studio art majors.
Jill Davis, the department's under
graduate assistant, attributed the in
crease to "more word of mouth, more
shows in the lobby and the gallery and
the art museum."
The department has been hard
pressed. however, to keep up with stu
dent demand, from both majors and
non-majors, for its courses. Entry-level

studio art classes, such as introductory
drawing or painting, are particularly
popular.
"I know one person who'd been try
ing to get into a drawing class for four
years, and he never got in. He was ob
viously very frustrated." recalled se
nior Casey Alt. a studio art minor.
Alt noted that "especially for fresh
men there's really a barrier into enter
ing into the program," but also said
that "once you're into one class you
kind of have free reign over what you
want to take."
Even Yale University's respected

art school, which currently enrolls ap
proximately KOO students in studio art
classes every year, has trouble accom
modating everyone who wishes to take
its classes. "As many as 50 percent [of
students interested in enrolling in art
classes] are turned away," said Marie
kuntz.. the school's business manager.
Although the number of art and art
history majors is on the rise, it is still
very low when compared to that of
Stanford's larger, more pre-profes
sional majors. The economics depart-
