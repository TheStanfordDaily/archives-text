# Art struggles with new demands
## Students cite organizational obstacles 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
Although Stanford now boasts the
expansive Iris & B. Gerald Cantor
Center for Visual Arts, the I 'niversity
Art and Art History Department con

tmues to experience growing pains.
The number of the department's de
clared majors has roughly doubled, up
from about 50. in the past live years.
There are currently 51 art history ma
jors and 45 studio art majors.
Jill Davis, the department's under
graduate assistant, attributed the in
crease to "more word of mouth, more
shows in the lobby and the gallery and
the art museum."
The department has been hard
pressed. however, to keep up with stu
dent demand, from both majors and
non-majors, for its courses. Entry-level

studio art classes, such as introductory
drawing or painting, are particularly
popular.
"I know one person who'd been try
ing to get into a drawing class for four
years, and he never got in. He was ob
viously very frustrated." recalled se
nior Casey Alt. a studio art minor.
Alt noted that "especially for fresh
men there's really a barrier into enter
ing into the program," but also said
that "once you're into one class you
kind of have free reign over what you
want to take."
Even Yale University's respected

art school, which currently enrolls ap
proximately KOO students in studio art
classes every year, has trouble accom
modating everyone who wishes to take
its classes. "As many as 50 percent [of
students interested in enrolling in art
classes] are turned away," said Marie
kuntz.. the school's business manager.
Although the number of art and art
history majors is on the rise, it is still
very low when compared to that of
Stanford's larger, more pre-profes
sional majors. The economics depart-

ment, for example, has five times
as many declared majors as the art
and art history department.
"There is less emphasis on art,
and as a result there aren't as many
majors. Therefore the classes
aren't as intense; they aren't con
cerned with really deep instruc
tion. |In] the classes I took, it was
more like you're on your own, and
we'll grade you based on how hard
you try. It's hard to have a unified
goal when there are some people
wh< are serious and some who
aren't," an art history major ex
plained on the condition of
anonymity.
Alt also spoke of a lack of depth
in the department: "There's a
weird kind of catch-22 in the studio
department. They really rely on
non-majors, so they're really en
couraging. Hut, if you get really en
gaged with it. there's a limit with
what you can do. At the entry level

it's great, but at the long-term level
it's frustrating."
"I think one thing that is a little
bit discouraging maybe or some
thing that 1 didn't really realize is
that a lot of the classes that are list
ed in the Bulletin aren't really of
fered. You can't really plan out a
four-year schedule, because you
just don't know what classes are
going to be offered when," said
Janice Ahn, a sophomore current
ly majoring in art history. Ahn is
considering just minoring in art
history partly because of this diffi
culty in planning a course sched
ule.
Alt believes that the depart
ment could be improved if it re
ceived more attention. "If there
were more of an emphasis [on the
department], there would be more
alumni contributions, more of an
even distribution of majors," said
Alt.
"Studio art is in a little bit of un
usual position in that there are
other [nearby) institutions for
which studio art is much more cen

tral to their enterprise. Inevitably
we cannot offer the kind of range
that a dedicated art institute can,"
said Richard Vinograd, chairman
of the department.
Vinograd conceded that the de
partment had room for improve
ment, but also maintained that it
does a good job serving its majors.
"We're very aware that some of
our facilities are substandard; we
do have a current project to re
model the gallery building. My
sense is, in fact, the program works
quite well in that the upper level
courses are less oversubscribed,
and the students get more atten
tion."
Alt also said that the lack of
funding and emphasis on the de
partment was part of a self-perpet
uating cycle. "If you don't provide
the funding or expertise, then peo
ple won't be interested."
History Prof. Barton Bernstein
explained the origin of this under
emphasis on the arts at Stanford.
During the height of the Cold War.
Stanford made a conscious deci

sion to emphasize the hard sci
ences and engineering disciplines
over the humanities to gain gov
ernment research contracts and in
creased prestige, Bernstein said.
"Stanford has been traditional
ly strong in the sciences and very
pre-professional. That's not going
to change," Vinograd said. He
added, however, that this science
and engineering orientation helps
rather than hampers the arts or the
Art and Art History Department
at Stanford.
"Especially initiatives like the
digital arts center prosper when
students come over from computer
science and other technical disci
plines," Vinograd said. He noted
that the department offers courses
on the theme of art and technolo
gy-
"lt's not just an effort to accom
modate what's out there in terms
of majors and career interests.
[Technology] has become integral
to the discipline and made possible
a broadening of its horizons,"
Vinograd explained.
