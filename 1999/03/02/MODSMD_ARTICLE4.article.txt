## Prof. shocked by partisanship, lack of resources 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Like many other Americans, Law Prof.
Deborah Rhode found herself weary of
the partisan dealings that marked Presi
dent Clinton's impeachment trial. Howev

er, after spending the summer and fall as
Democratic counsel to the House Judicia
ry Committee for the impeachment inves
tigation. Rhode has a unique perspective.
"It was so far removed from the way
one would envision a true democratic
process," Rhode said. "It truly was disillu
sioning."
Rhode explained the pressures she
faced, particularly the time crunch and the
lack of resources available to the Democ
ratic staff attorneys in the Republican
controlled Congress. She remembered
one individual telling her. "I sure wish vou

guys would win some elections, so you
could get some chairs!" At times they sat
on the floor.
She also related a story of begging Re
publican staffers for Wite-out at 2 a.m.
Law School Dean Paul Brest said
Rhode is a leading scholar in legal ethics,
the legal profession, and women and the
law. Rhode explained that she was inter
ested in the impeachment trial, because it
coincided with her field of expertise. The
Judiciary committee targeted her for the
same reasons. "It was a happy conver
gence," she said.

"It really seemed like a valuable oppor
tunity." Rhode continued. "I did learn
new things hut not the things I thought I
would learn.
"I was unprepared for the sheer parti
sanship of it," said Rhode, emphasizing
that there were "politics on every level."
Rhode was also surprised hv the degree
of hostility toward academics. Responding
to the extensive testimony concerning the
meaning of constitutional standard for im
peachment. House Judiciary Committee
