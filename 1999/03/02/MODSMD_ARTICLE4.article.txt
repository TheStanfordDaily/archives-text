# Rhode learns Congressional lessons
## Prof. shocked by partisanship, lack of resources 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Like many other Americans, Law Prof.
Deborah Rhode found herself weary of
the partisan dealings that marked Presi
dent Clinton's impeachment trial. Howev

er, after spending the summer and fall as
Democratic counsel to the House Judicia
ry Committee for the impeachment inves
tigation. Rhode has a unique perspective.
"It was so far removed from the way
one would envision a true democratic
process," Rhode said. "It truly was disillu
sioning."
Rhode explained the pressures she
faced, particularly the time crunch and the
lack of resources available to the Democ
ratic staff attorneys in the Republican
controlled Congress. She remembered
one individual telling her. "I sure wish vou

guys would win some elections, so you
could get some chairs!" At times they sat
on the floor.
She also related a story of begging Re
publican staffers for Wite-out at 2 a.m.
Law School Dean Paul Brest said
Rhode is a leading scholar in legal ethics,
the legal profession, and women and the
law. Rhode explained that she was inter
ested in the impeachment trial, because it
coincided with her field of expertise. The
Judiciary committee targeted her for the
same reasons. "It was a happy conver
gence," she said.

"It really seemed like a valuable oppor
tunity." Rhode continued. "I did learn
new things hut not the things I thought I
would learn.
"I was unprepared for the sheer parti
sanship of it," said Rhode, emphasizing
that there were "politics on every level."
Rhode was also surprised hv the degree
of hostility toward academics. Responding
to the extensive testimony concerning the
meaning of constitutional standard for im
peachment. House Judiciary Committee
Chair I lenry I Ivcic said, "We've had
so many college professors in here,
we should gel academic credit."
Even alter the expert testimony,
according to Rhode, members of
Congress continued to misunder
stand what the Constitution said. She
also expressed dismay that in the
process of producing the final report,
because no names of staffers would
be included, "few people cared at
all." The report represented "the his
torical legacy of these
proceedings.... I wanted it to be as
good as possible."
"Watching people go through the
motions, in a process that was of

enormous national importance,
would heighten the cynicism of any
one."
According to Law Prof. Barbara
Babeock, "the process was so in
tensely partisan that the full role that
she could play wasn't available."
Rhode authored "Speaking of
Sex: The Denial of (lender Inequali
ty," in 1997, in which she argues that
there is "room for sensitivity to diver
sity" in hiring. "We've made partial
progress, [but] women still do face
special scrutiny."
Rhode said, "All the research
shows that women with similar quali
fications and credentials advance less
far and less fast than men. I his is
compounded by widespread denial
that there is a problem."
I lie I .aw School has recently been

surrounded by controversy relating
to gender inequality. Rhode called
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan's recent
appointment as dean of the Law
School "a source of great rejoicing,
partly because she's the first woman
who's dean at this school and also be
cause she fully deserves the position."
Rhode declined to comment on
the resignation of Law Prof. Linda
Mabry several weeks ago amid accu
sations of discrimination.
Rhode served as director of the
Institute for Research on Women
and C lender at Stanford from 1986 to
1990. "She was an important intellec
tual force at the institute," according
to Marilyn Yalom, a senior scholar at
the institute. Rhode is also director of
the Keck Center on Legal Ethics and
the Legal Profession.

Rhode also just finished a one
year term as president of the Associ
ation of American Law Schools. Ac
cording to Babcock, Rhode's ap
pointment was "really an absolute tri
umph. She just did a great job."
Law School Dean Paul Brest de
scribed Rhode as "one of the people
that make the Stanford faculty as
strong as it is."
Rhode said that she would like to
write about the legal ethics and gen
der issues raised by the impeachment
proceedings. "Not a kiss and tell." she
added, "but an attempt to put it in a
broader perspective."
When asked if she would ever re
turn to Washington, D.C., Rhode
said, "Never in a job like that. I've
seen enough of that level of politics to
last a lifetime."
