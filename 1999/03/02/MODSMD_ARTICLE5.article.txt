# Delta Gamma closes after long history

Ending a presence on campus that first began more
than a century ago, members of the Delta Gamma soror
ity voted to relinquish their charter last fall and officially
shut down the chapter in January.
The DGs made the decision, which has been in the
works since last year, due to a gradual decrease in mem
bership in recent years. The closure leaves Stanford with
just five sororities.
According to senior Kalee Magnani. the last DG pres
ident. by the beginning of this year only 20 women were
in DG. Five years ago there were about 60 to 70 women
in the sorority.
"Our numbers were getting lower to the point where
next year, after everyone graduated, there would have
been very few people left." Magnani said.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said that the DGs deci
sion is a loss to the campus.
"Delta Gamma has been a good positive contributing
member to both the Greek and the Stanford communi
ties," he said.
Members of the DGs said they were content with the
decision to relinquish the charter.
"1 was really happy with the vote. I thought it was the
best thing for the chapter," said senior Jennifer Williams,
a DG.
"Based on the situation, 1 think we did what was
right." Magnani added. " There were definitely no hard
feelings in the group, because we all felt like we were
making the right decision."
In winter of last year, DG members attempted to sal
vage the chapter with what Magnani called "a revitaliza
tion effort."
They attempted to recruit new pledges by sending let
ters to women on campus and by conducting one-on-one
interviews with prospective members.
Magnani explained their efforts. "A common com
plaint about rush is that you don't get to meet people in
dividually. so we decided to make it more informal and
personal," she said.
Although the effort did earn the DGs a few new mem
bers. after the spring rush process the group realized that
it probably did not have enough members to survive.
For this reason they decided not to offer bids to any of
their new pledges.
"We realized that we might not continue, and if we
pledged these people and made them spend all that
money ... it just wouldn't have been fair." Magnani ex
plained.
From that point the prospect of relinquishing the char
ter became increasingly likelv. according to Maenani.
