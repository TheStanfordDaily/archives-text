# Delta Gamma closes after long history
## 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Ending a presence on campus that first began more
than a century ago, members of the Delta Gamma soror
ity voted to relinquish their charter last fall and officially
shut down the chapter in January.
The DGs made the decision, which has been in the
works since last year, due to a gradual decrease in mem
bership in recent years. The closure leaves Stanford with
just five sororities.
According to senior Kalee Magnani. the last DG pres
ident. by the beginning of this year only 20 women were
in DG. Five years ago there were about 60 to 70 women
in the sorority.
"Our numbers were getting lower to the point where
next year, after everyone graduated, there would have
been very few people left." Magnani said.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said that the DGs deci
sion is a loss to the campus.
"Delta Gamma has been a good positive contributing
member to both the Greek and the Stanford communi
ties," he said.
Members of the DGs said they were content with the
decision to relinquish the charter.
"1 was really happy with the vote. I thought it was the
best thing for the chapter," said senior Jennifer Williams,
a DG.
"Based on the situation, 1 think we did what was
right." Magnani added. " There were definitely no hard
feelings in the group, because we all felt like we were
making the right decision."
In winter of last year, DG members attempted to sal
vage the chapter with what Magnani called "a revitaliza
tion effort."
They attempted to recruit new pledges by sending let
ters to women on campus and by conducting one-on-one
interviews with prospective members.
Magnani explained their efforts. "A common com
plaint about rush is that you don't get to meet people in
dividually. so we decided to make it more informal and
personal," she said.
Although the effort did earn the DGs a few new mem
bers. after the spring rush process the group realized that
it probably did not have enough members to survive.
For this reason they decided not to offer bids to any of
their new pledges.
"We realized that we might not continue, and if we
pledged these people and made them spend all that
money ... it just wouldn't have been fair." Magnani ex
plained.
From that point the prospect of relinquishing the char
ter became increasingly likelv. according to Maenani.

"It's been a wonderful experience
for all of us. and we wanted to leave it
with good memories rather than
spend time trying to get new mem
bers and then getting frustrated," she
said.
According to Wais, the I Jniversity
was not involved in the DGs' deci
sion. "We received a letter from the
national Delta Gamma in February
notifying us that the sorority had vol
untarily elected amongst themselves
to relinquish its charter," Wais said.
Members of DG point to their clo
sure as symptomatic of a larger trend
of diminishing interest in the Greeks
at Stanford.
Magnani said the number of
women rushing has decreased dra
matically in recent years, from 2(X)-
300 three years ago to a little more
than 100 last year.
As each of the six sororities usual
ly had 30 slots open for new pledges,
she said it was inevitable that some
groups would fall short last year and
that the DGs knew they would be one
of those groups.

" The people that go through rush
go towards the bigger sororities, be
cause maybe it's perceived that you
can do more in a bigger sorority."
Magnani said. However, she added,
"I had a great time in a smaller soror
ity. I got to know everyone and have
a leadership role."
Williams said she believes that, de
spite the demise of the DGs. the sup
ply of sororities still outweighs de
mand on campus. "I really think that
Stanford can only support four soror
ities," she said.
Magnani said she hopes that the
DGs can eventually return to cam
pus. "If the situation's ever right for
us to come back, it would be wonder
ful," she said.
Wais said the University would
encourage such a return.
"There's nothing to preclude
Delta Gamma from resurfacing years
from now, if enough students express
an interest of bringing it back to life
on the Stanford campus," Wais said.
In the meantime all of the students
who were members of the DGs were
made alumnae of the organization by
the DG National Council in January,
making them members of the group
for life.
