# Prof. joins school voucher debate
## Levin argues vouchers aren't worth their cost 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
Stanford Education Prof. Henry
Levin is contributing to the nation
al debate about vouchers and
school choice by arguing that school
vouchers make a negligible differ
ence in children's academic perfor
mance.
In a recent article in the Journal
of Policy Analysis and Management,
Levin cites studies that - show stu
dents receiving vouchers exhibit "no
differences in achievement or only
minimal differences" from students
not receiving vouchers.
In voucher systems students re
ceive scholarships, or vouchers, that
can be used towards their education.
These vouchers enable families to
pay for tuition at private or public
schools that they select.
Vouchers give education funding
directly to students and their parents
rather than school districts, accord
ing to http://www.schoolchoices.org,
the Web site for the School ( hoices
organization. School Choices, like
many voucher supporters, favors
vouchers, because "parental choice

and competition between public and
private schools will improve educa
tion," according to the site.
Yet Levin suggested that this may
not always be the case, and improve
ments may be minimal.
'There is some empirical support
for the proposition that vouchers
will improve school achievement,
slightly." he said in an e-mail. "How
much is slightly'.' Perhaps an amount
equivalent to about 20 points on the
combined math and verbal SA T."
Additionally Levin is concerned
that the cost of voucher programs
may not justify their results.
"( ost comparisons are not readi
ly available," Levin said, "but it ap
pears that the overall cost of a
voucher system will exceed substan
tially the costs of the present system
because of the demands of central
ized records for each student, trans
portation requirements, accredita
tion of schools to receive vouchers
and so on."
However Political Science Prof.
Terry Moe argued that researchers
have not been studying voucher pro
grams long enough to justify conclu
sions on vouchers. He also pointed
out that studies on voucher effec
tiveness have only taken place in
Milwaukee, Cleveland and New
York City.
"I think that it's too early to tell
right now, because data aren't good
enough," he said. "To say vouchers
have a small impact summarizes
conclusions on very little data."
The New York City study, which

Moe credited as "far and away the
best," randomly selected 1,200 stu
dents out of 20,000 to receive vouch
ers and sent the rest back into the
public system. At the end of the year,
all of the original 20,000 were tested
to determine improvements.
"This was a really good way of ap
proaching this," Moe said. "The kids
who got in were compared with kids
that didn't get in.and the results look
pretty good for the voucher side.
Those who received vouchers were
performing 2 to 4 percent higher
than public school kids."
"The downside," Moe added, "is
that it has only been one year."
Education Prof. Michael Kirst,
who is teaching at Stanford in Ox
ford this quarter, echoed Moe's cha
grin at the lack of time-tested evi
dence.
"My overall view of vouchers is
that there is not sufficient evidence
on either side of the debate to reach
firm conclusions based on research."
he said. " There are only a few small
scale demonstrations with a few
thousand children, so policy conclu
sions will have to wail for more
large-scale experiments using con
trol groups."
Levin maintained that vouchers
could possibly even worsen educa
tional situations for children.
"Virtually all evaluations suggest
that equity in the distribution of
schooling opportunities will fall with
vouchers because of the conse
quences of who chooses and cream
skimminu by schools," he said, argu

ing that vouchers may remove the
best students from some schools,
leaving only unmotivated or disad
vantaged students behind.
In the coming years. Levin said,
educational issues will continue to
be among the United States' most
important national concerns.
"We will continue to see tremen
dous pressures for change in public
schools including pressures for
greater choice and for higher effec
tiveness of inner-city schools," he
said. "I think we will see much more
deregulation of public schools."
Moe suggested that the debate
should focus more on the fundamen
tal aspects of vouchers.
"Look at it as not whether vouch
ers have a positive impact but as
what types of vouchers have what ef
fects," he said. " The bottom line is
that it's all in the design. The impact
of a particular program is going to
depend on exactly how that program
is designed."
Currently, Moe said, things look
good for vouchers, despite Levin's
criticisms.
"At this point the data suggests
that vouchers can promote higher
levels of achievement," he said.
"Given all the data problems and
problems in design. I think it's heart
ening that things look as good as
they do."
Overall, despite their disagree
ment about how change should be
implemented, both Levin and Moe
agree on one final point: that educa
tion should be reformed.
