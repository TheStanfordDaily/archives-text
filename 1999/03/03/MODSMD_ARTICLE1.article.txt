Campus residents expressed their
concerns to Student Housing Ser
vices last night at an informational
meeting at Mirrielees about the Es

construction project slated to break

ground June 15.
Carey Roth, manager of graduate
housing construction and capital ren

with information on student parking,
construetion parking, construction
schedules and dust and noise abate
ment for residents of Mirrielees and
EV.

Those who attended the meeting
voiced strong concerns about the
preservation of adequate parking,
open space and pleasant views. Some
students living in Mirrielees ex
pressed dismay at a temporary loss of
parking spaces for safety fencing and

()thers. such as sophomores Whit
ney Drumright and Chad Wassink,
came to learn basic information
about the project. Flyers and e-mail
notices including basics about the
construction were distributed to all
I Iniversity residents by their resident
assistants.
Last night's meeting, in addition
to the e-mail notices, a Web site, and
an information hotline, is part of Stu
dent Housing Services' introduction
of the upcoming project to the Stan
ford community.
The University will start construc
tion in mid-June at three sites in Es
condido Village, to create 508 new
units for single graduate students.
Two of the sites are scheduled for
completion at the end of August
2(KH), including 139 units just east of
Mirrielees and another 128 units at
the corner of Campus Drive and Es
condido Road.
Two lour-story low-rise apart
ments are to be constructed adjacent
to Building 36 in Escondido Village
and will provide an additional 236
housing units. This third develop

ment site is scheduled for completion
by December 2000.
According to Diana Conklin,
manager of Graduate Housing Oper
ations, construction at Escondido
Village is the first in-fill development
on campus that will take place in the
presence of existing residents. This
will pose unique problems for stu
dents, contractors and construction
managers involved with or affected
by the project.
While acknowledging the un
avoidable problems of a project of
this nature, Roth assured students
that the University will make all pos
sible efforts to lessen noise, dust, and
parking difficulties.
"We want to do everything we can
to mitigate the impacts on students,"
Roth said. He also cited several mea
sures being taken to lessen the im
pacts of construction upon residents
in graduate and undergraduate hous
ing surrounding the development
site.
Contractor hours will be restricted
to the hours of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. In
addition, no disturbing or noisy con
struction will be allowed during Dead
Week and Finals Week. During the
dry summer months, the construction
area will be regularly watered down
to reduce the amount of dust in the

Graduate Housing Construction
is also working with Parking and
Transportation Services to mitigate
traffic problems that may be caused
by construction traffic and supply de
liveries. Student parking will be tem
porarily reduced during construction,
but students will find a net increase in
parking spaces after the completion
of the project.
Housing Assignment Services is
also making an effort to notify both
continuing and new students of the
impacts of construction before mak
ing their housing choices for this sum
mer and next fall.
"We want to make sure students
make informed choices," said Kath
leen Bransfield, manager of Housing
Assignment Services.
Housing Assignment Services will
include notices of the upcoming con
struction in the informational book
lets given to graduate students and
their residence agreements, in addi
tion to information on the Web that
will target both graduate and under
graduate students.
"Certainly, students were part of
the planning process from the very
beginning," said Bransfield.
According to Roth, this develop
ment has broad support from the

community and from graduate stu
dents and student housing services
representatives who are part of the
Graduate Housing Advisory Com
mittee.
"It's a very necessary addition to
the housing portfolio at Stanford,"
said Roth.
The University sought the advice
of an outside consulting firm and
carefully considered the needs and
concerns of both students and the
surrounding community before
choosing these particular sites. Con
struction coordinators took into con
sideration pre-existing utilities, com
munications infrastructure, and
water services in an attempt to keep
construction costs and rents low.
The apartments are being built in
response to an overwhelming de
mand for more on-campus graduate
housing. Housing costs in Silicon Val
ley have skyrocketed in recent years,
leaving many graduate students un
able to find affordable housing off
campus.
As a result, more graduate stu
dents are applying for on-campus
housing, which is already in short sup
ply. Last year, 736 graduate students
were denied housing as compared to
242 who were denied in the two years
before.
