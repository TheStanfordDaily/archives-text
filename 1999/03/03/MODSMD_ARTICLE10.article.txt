KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Rwandan
rebels kidnapped and slaughtered eight foreign
tourists, including two Americans, turning their
gorilla-watching expedition into a forced march
of terror and death deep in a rainforest, survivors
and witnesses said yesterday.
The dead also included four Britons and two
New Zealanders, according to diplomats. At
least a half dozen other tourists survived the
nightmarish rampage, which began with rebels
systematically raiding campgrounds at a national
park, killing rangers and rounding up foreigners.
"The rebels were looking for Americans and
British," said Hussein Kivumbi, manager of one
of five tented camps at the Bwindi Impenetrable
Forests. "They killed four women and four men
with knives, machetes and axes."
Some of the victims were killed because they
couldn't walk fast enough, he said. At least one
women victim appeared to have been sexually
assaulted.
Americans Rob Haubner. 48, and his wife,
Susan Miller, 42, who worked lor the computer
company, Intel Corp., were slain, company
spokesman Bill Calder confirmed. The Hills
boro. Ore., couple was on their third trip to
Africa with another couple from the company.
All of the victims were brutally hacked to
death Monday in the jungles of southwestern
Uganda made famous in the film "Gorillas in the
Mist."
Six tourists were rescued and were then flown
yesterday to safety in Kampala.
Events at the camps on the edge of Bwindi
National Park unfolded rapidly, though the exact
time it began was not immediately clear.
About 200 Rwandan rebels charged into the
camps set along the mountainous border with
Congo and separated the tourists in search of
Americans and British. Kivumbi said.
A French diplomat and his family were let go,
Kivumbi said. The rebels, speaking Kinvarwanda
and French and dressed in ragtag clothes, then
forced hostages into the mountains of neighbor
ing Congo.

Three Americans, six Britons, three New
Zealanders, an Australian, a Swiss woman and a
Canadian were among those kidnapped, Ugan
dan officials said, adding that three tourists were
still missing.
"They wanted them to move fast, hut some
couldn't." Kivumbi said. So they killed with
machetes one man and one woman who couldn't
walk. Then they killed another three."
"There was no rescue," he said.
Uganda's army said it attempted to pursue
them, but the rebels ran too fast.
One survivor. Mark Ross, a tour operator and
pilot from Arkansas, was freed with a political
message from the rebels.
He said he came upon the remains of some
captives who had been marched through the

rainforest.
"We came across the first set of bodies," he
said. "The women that we'd been told would be
escorted back had been killed on the spot. It
looks like one was raped prior to being killed."
Ross said he saw five bodies, and"the ones
that 1 saw had their heads crushed in and deep
slashes."
His account clashed with that of Ugandan
police spokesman Eric Naigambi, who told The
Associated Press there was a shootout and that
the rescue operation Tuesday morning.
The rebels also gave a message to Anne Pelti
er — a survivor who is France's deputy ambas
sador to Uganda — blaming the Americans and
British for not backing "the ethnic Hutu majori
ty"
