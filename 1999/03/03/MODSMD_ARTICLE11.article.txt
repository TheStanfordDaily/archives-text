# Company faces profit drop
## H-P Co. splits 
### 
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) â€” Hewlett-Packard Co., a
granddaddv of the high-tech industry that has lately
seen disappointing profits, is splitting into two publicly
traded companies.
The move would separate Hewlett-Packard's com
puter manufacturing from the much smaller divisions
that make electronic testing and measuring equip
ment.
"We are taking this action to sharpen the strategic
focus of our businesses, improve their agility and
increase their responsiveness to customers and part
ners." Hewlett-Packard President Lewis E. Piatt said
yesterday.
Under Hewlett-Packard's plan, each company will
have its own board of directors and shareholders. The
computer manufacturing business will keep the
Hewlett-Packard name. No name has been chosen for
the second company.
The board of directors approved the plan yester
day.and an initial public offering for 15 percent of the
smaller company could be held by the end of the year.
1 lewlett-Packard. founded in 193S by engineers Bill
Hewlett and David Packard, remains a leader in large
computers, called servers, that use the Unix operating
system.
It also makes personal computers and low-end
servers that use Intel Corp. chips and Microsoft's Win
dows software.
H-P's revenue was $47 billion last year, and its
stock is worth more than $70 billion.
However, its stock price growth has lagged behind
the overall market during the past two years, in part
because lower prices for personal computers have cut
into profits.
