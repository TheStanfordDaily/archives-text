# N.H. considers new tax

CONCORD. N.H. (AP) â€”New Hamp
shire. the "Live Free or Die" state, may not be
free of an income tax much longer.
A state Supreme Court order to overhaul
the way schools are funded threatens New
Hampshire's long-cherished distinction as one
of seven states with no personal income tax.
New Hampshire is also one of only two
states with neither an income tax nor a gener
al sales tax. (Alaska is the other.) The state
depends instead on a mishmash of taxes on
such thing as businesses, restaurant meals,
hotel rooms, property sales, cigarettes and
alcohol.
All of that may change as lawmakers
scramble to comply with an April 1 court
deadline to implement a fairer way to pay for
schools.
In 1997, the court ruled the state no longer
could rely on local property taxes, which vary
widely from place to place, to pay 90 percent
of the cost of public education. The court
ordered the state to use state taxes to ensure
every child receives an adequate education.
The court left it to the state to define an
adequate education, which lawmakers esti
mate will cost $7(X) million to $1 billion. That
would double the state's overall budget.
As the deadline nears, lawmakers are not
exactly embracing an income tax. But they're
no longer holding it at arm's length, either,
because it can easily raise the money needed
to solve the crisis.
One idea on the table is a combination of a
4 percent income tax and a uniform, statewide
property tax. Together, they would raise $970

million for education.
The property tax would be set at a rate
lower than what most towns are paying
already. As a result, the overall tax burden on
most people in New Hampshire would fall,
according to backers of the plan.
Gov. Sherman Adams, who went on to be
President Eisenhower's chief of staff, pro
posed a 1 percent income tax in 1949 but
abandoned the idea after failing to win much
support from lawmakers.
Two decades later, conservative Republi
can Gov. Meldrim Thomson coined the cam
paign slogan "Ax the Tax," and every gover
nor since has taken "The Pledge" to veto
broad-based taxes.
Current Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Demo
crat. was no exception, but she has left the
door open by saying she supports allowing
voters to choose a solution to the school fund
ing problem through a binding referendum -
something not attempted in New Hampshire
in more than 1 (K) years. The high court is
deciding whether a referendum would be con
stitutional.
The leader of the Republican-controlled
House, Speaker Donna Svtek. opposes an
income tax. But the Democrats control the
Senate for the first time since 1912 and are led
by Sen. Clesson Blaisdell, a longtime income
tax supporter.
New Hampshire's only statewide newspa
per, the fiercely conservative Union Leader of
Manchester, has led the way in vilifying
broad-based taxes. But income tax supporters
say the paper's influence is declining.
