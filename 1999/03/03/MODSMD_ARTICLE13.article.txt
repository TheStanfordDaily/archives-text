seeking egg donors
raise ethical issues

WE RECENTLY PRINTED
an advertisement from a
law firm publicizing a cou
ple's need for a human egg donor.
For the handsome sum of $50,000, the
donor will receive a free medical
screening and have all expenses paid
for their "services."
But there is a catch.
The donor has to be at least 5 feet
10 inches with a minimum 1400 SAT
score and possess no "major family
medical issues."
We feel that this brings to light a
number of important moral and ethi
cal issues that should be considered
as the scientific world, and the nation
at large, barrels forward technologi
cally.
Is the pre-selection of an egg with
certain traits a practice our society is
ready to adopt?
The donated egg will only have the
potential of producing the type of
individual that is desired.
But even still, the parents of the
individual who is born from the
donated egg have effectively
removed some of the chance that is a
part of natural child bearing. Can we
accept this?
But perhaps more disturbing is
that a certain monetary value has
been assigned to an egg with these
desired traits.
How can we say that a child who
might inherit these characteristics is
somehow more valuable than one
without them? Because this adver
tisement was run on the Stanford
campus, are offspring of those who
are educated here better than those
of people who aren't?
And what would happen if some
one had only a 1350 SAT score?

Would the offering price be reduced
to $40,000?
Parents-to-be already have the
capability of having an amniocentesis
performed while their fetus is still in
the womb. Historically, this proce
dure was used, aside from determin
ing the sex of the fetus, to test for
genetic abnormalities such as Down's
Syndrome.
However, as the National Human
Genome Project continues its work,
there will be a significantly greater
pool of resources available for identi
fying more specific traits of the fetus.
Gene therapy at this stage, or correct
ing some genetic "flaws," is a very
real possibility.
If this technology becomes avail
able, we will have to ask the difficult
questions of what characterizes a
"flaw," and what is just a "cosmetic
adjustment?"
If we can "correct" these traits at
this stage, it is equally possible to pre
select at an earlier stage. What are
the ramifications of those alter
ations?
Ultimately, will we one day be able
to build our own children from their
genetic bases?
Will those children, or even those
born to the parents who placed the
advertisement, truly be better off or
just simply a reflection of what their
parents want them to be? Is there
such a thing as the perfect child ... or
an imperfect one?
Hie ethical questions raised by the
advertisement are only a rudimenta
ry reflection of what will be an impor
tant debate that we, as a society, must
one day resolve.
We must be careful in deciding
how we proceed.
In doing so, we must be cognizant
of the fact that we are deciding issues
regarding human life, whose effects
will not only influence society at large
but also the individuals whose lives
these decisions will directly affect.
