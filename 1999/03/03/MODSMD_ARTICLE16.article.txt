# Breathing Lessons
## The 						failure of forwards (fwd) 
### 
April Van Scherpe

WARMTH. Ful
fillment. A
sense of con
nection with my fellow
man. What I noticed most
about these feelings was
that they were indeed not
welling up inside of me.

Even conceding the points that, yes,
"friends are the people who will listen and
won't laugh" and that yes, "friends stick
with you and stand by you," I derived no
special thrill from the newest forwarded e
mail lighting up my Netscape mailbox yes
terday. (Can you guess the title of the e
mail? It wasn't "Neighbors".)
I'm sure you've all seen these friendship
forwards. They're long, sentimental and
replete with the asterisk lines and ASCII
shapes that make any e-mail more grand.
Sent with the best intentions, they serve as
easily digestible wisdom on relationships
and count for points in the game of keep
ing in touch. They tell you you're splendid,
a veritable jewel of a friend, that you sport
unparalled qualities of "being there."
But somehow, this latest round of Inter
net warm fuzzies leaves something to be
desired. Maybe it has to do with the fact
that sixty-some other fine human beings
with .edu addresses around the country
apparently share my adeptness at the art of
friendship. Or maybe it's because the slip
shod rhymes and bad metaphors aren't so
eye-misting when not written by the actual
sender. Or maybe it's that the message of
hugs, smiles and shared experiences glows
numbly from a 14-inch glass and plastic
box. No, more likely it's the successive
rows of "»" — like so many recycling
symbols to the left of the text.
Whatever the specific qualm spurring
dissatisfaction, it's clear that electronics

have taken the touch out of keeping in
touch.
It's even worse if you extend it to your
love life.
The problem is that e-communication is
too easy, too careless to be genuine. Oh it's
no wonder, of course, that with the speed
and ease of e-mail, dates disguised as study
sessions come in the form of a "Subj: Hey
There." Just don't select "Reply To All" if
your love interest is on the class list, or the
prof will remember your Hum Sex field
work idea for months. And remember to
type your name, because who IS cyber
squirrel@leland, anyway?
But as the relationship progresses, the
contrast between mutual closeness and the
horrible short shrift of computer contact
grows painfully large. 1 don't mean virtual
dating, but even the short e-notes between
human interaction become laughably
indistinguishable as any semblance of inti
macy. While "I can still taste you on my
lips" is titillating even over the computer,
it's comical when nudged against the for
gotten sig file. You end up with cute little
messages like:
"Just wanted to say I love you. sweetie.
Bees! They're huge and sting crazy! Don't
try to be the hero!"
Um, glad I inspire ... that.
Better yet, from an A. A. Milne reader:
"God, you're sexy. I'm the luckiest guy
in the world. My spelling is wobbly. It's
good spelling but it wobbles, and the let
ters get in the wrong places."
Oh yeah, type it to me, baby. Right.
Work that keyboard.
Or not. E-mail has faults. It breeds
desensitization by putting a network of
wires and a huge screen between you and
what your loved one had to say. It's notori
ous for being emotionally ambiguous. And

please explain how you can cultivate inti
macy over a slate of keys.
So where have all the letters gone?
Where e-mail has deficits, letters have
the upper hand. First, they're physical,
chunks of space transcending time to
bridge the gap between two people. What
he once held you now hold, what he once
labored over, you now focus on. The fact
that it passed between you betrays inten
tion as well.What color is the paper? Is it
scented? Study the texture. Is it warped in
small places, watermarked from sweat or
an unblotted tear? What about the hand
writing? A tender phrase looks infinitely
better in cursive than in Arial, where you
can't pick out the quavering "1," the clum
sily crossed "t" or the sexual frustration of
incomplete "g" loops.
Second, letters are inherently more
open than e-mail. Perhaps it's because to
touch and commune with ink and paper is
so personal that the words correspond in
kind. Letter writers effuse themselves onto
the page and approach a rough draft
stream of consciousness, a visceral percep
tion of the world that invites the reader on
an excursion of untempered feeling. Let
ters provide a glimpse inside the person, a
frank revelation of what two can share.
Write letters.
They're desperately more connective
than what the mail server has waiting for
you. However, e-mail is useful for getting
into the mind in one respect. Open that
Friendship forward and see how far down
you are on the addressee list. Are you
number one? Best friend. But if you're
wedged between a mutual friend and a lab
partner, we 11... need a spamgoat?
