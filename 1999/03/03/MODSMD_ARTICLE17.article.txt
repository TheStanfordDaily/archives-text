Wilson editorial skewed
Monday's editorial against the appoint
ment of former Governor Pete Wilson to
the Hoover Institution was, quite frankly,
not well thought out.
Though it discussed the potential divi
siveness of his appointment and his appar
ent lack of policy credentials, the editorial
was clearly written out of distaste for Wil
son's politics.
That politicians have and will continue to
have association with Hoover is so
inevitable that to argue otherwise seems
ridiculous. You might recall that the
founder was also an American president;
more recently former Senator Bill Bradley's
affiliation as a visiting fellow (Wilson's posi
tion) didn't seem to raise much stir.
That Hoover "lured" Wilson so it could
be a "refueling stop" in his quest for higher
office seems strange as well. I have a hard
time imagining Hoover, with its Nobel lau
reates, former high-ranking government
officials and world-renowned scholars,
being dazzled by Wilson's "brand-name
appeal." More likely they felt that his expe
riences could make a positive contribution
to the work that goes on at the institution.
Much more divisive than Wilson's arrival
is the shrill intolerance, of which this edito
rial was an example, that tends to surround
political and philosophical discourse on this
campus. I consider myself a moderate liber

al, and I strongly opposed Proposition IX7
and Proposition 2(R However. I tend to
support the First Amendment, particularly
when it is employed with civility â€” some
thing often lacking from students and even
professors at Stanford. Whether I agree
with someone's politics on first analysis or
not, it seems worthwhile to try to under
stand why another intelligent person might
hold that different point of view. If you
accept this point, it follows that there really
is no reason that Wilson should not be asso
ciated with Hoover.
That being said, 1 (and probably most
students interested in issues of public poli
cy) would like to have access to former
elected officials such as Wilson and Bradley
as much as I would like access to former
political appointees such as former Secre
tary of State and Hoover Distinguished Fel
low George Schultz. Of course, that access
is almost nonexistent; the reality of it is that
the nature and structure of the Hoover
Institution has little impact on undergradu
ate life at Stanford. To say that Hoover
could do better than Wilson might be true.
To say that his presence may cause trouble
is doubtful at best. What is more certain is
that students deserve a more informed and
thoughtful opinion from The Daily's edito
rial writers.

A'ot advertising, brainwashing
When opening a copy of The Daily yes
terday. an "advertising supplement" from
the Human Life Alliance of Minnesota
Education Fund fell out from the folds of
the paper.
Why don't we call this "advertising"
what it really is? Propaganda.
What product is being advertised? What
company is trying to make a profit by sug
gesting its product or services to the Stanford
community? These are questions that are
hard to answer, and clearly the editors of The
Daily feel they don't need to answer them.
While the people who make the decisions to
include supplements like this one probably
think they are harmless and that people can
throw them out if they don't want them
(which I assure you most people don't), I
would like to suggest that it is not that simple.
I am all for freedom of speech, so 1 am
not calling for censorship of this, or any,
pro-life material. But let's not call it "adver
tising.'" What it is, more accurately, is a
right-wing organization that is trying to
brainwash college students into believing
that the government should control the
bodies and choices of its female citizens.
That's what it is. Yet I see no mention any
where on the paper from the editors that
explains the purposes of enclosing this sup
plement or offers any opposing views.
So I offer mine. You have the right to

take money from this organization and dis
tribute their propaganda, and I'm glad you
have that right. But I have the right to tell
you that it makes me sick, that it shows the
same kind of money-hungry irresponsibilty
displayed in the printing of the Holocaust
revision add earlier in the year. Maybe The
Daily is strapped for cash these days, but
please don't expect the Stanford communi
ty to digest this kind of political propaganda
without an appropriately repulsive reaction.

A call for help
Each member of our class is working on
a project called "Parade of States." We are
responsbile for gathering as much informa
tion about the state we choose to research
as we can, in order to help "sell'' that state.
I have chosen your state. California, for
my presentation. If any of your readers
would help me out by sending me pictures,
postcards, a used license plate, travel
brochures, facts or products from you state,
1 would greatly appreciate it!
Thank you for any help you can give me.
