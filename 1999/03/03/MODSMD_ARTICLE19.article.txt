# Students celebrate by lantern light
## Chinese festival commemorates first full moon 
### Bo Zhang 
In a surrounding of red lanterns
and Chinese holiday decorations, a
group of Chinese students gathered
last night in Mark Taper Law Stu
dents Center to celebrate the sec
ond festival in the Year of the Rab
bit â€” the Lantern Festival.
Ancient Chinese people be
lieved celestial spirits could be seen
flying about in the light of the first
full moon of the lunar calendar. To
aid themselves in their search of the
spirits, they lit torches. Eventually,
these torches gave way to lanterns
of every conceivable size, color, and

shape, as the event evolved into the
Lantern Festival.
During the festival, Chinese peo
ple raise lanterns and eat yuan xiuo,
a round dumpling made of rice flour
which symbolizes the full moon and
a complete family reunion.
Sponsored by the Asia/Pacific
Scholarship program and the Asso
ciation of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford, the event was
designed not only for Chinese stu
dents but for all students at Stan
ford.
"I have an interest and a duty in
promoting the communication and
interaction between different cul
tures," said l ing Shen, a doctoral
student, an Asia/Pacific scholar and
initiator of the event. "It's not only a
chance for Chinese students to cele
brate their own festival, but also an
opportunity for students from other
countries to know about China."

Among the non-Chinese stu
dents attending the event was Costa
Sapuntzakis, an doctoral student in
computer science.
"I'd never heard about this
Lantern Festival before." said Sa
puntzakis. "It's really cool that
someone overcame all the troubles
and organize such an activity which
gives all the students a good chance
to know about another culture.'
Although Sapuntzakis has eaten
a lot of Chinese food, he had never
tried yuan xiao.
"It's quite different," he said be
tween mouthfuls of the rice balls.
"But good stuff."
Unlike Sapuntzakis, many Chi
nese students feel a sense ol home
eating yuan xiao and watching
lanterns.
Jennie Zhou, a doctoral student
in mechanical engineering, has been
away from China for five years.

"I haven't seen these lanterns for
a long time," said Zhou. "It's great
to see them again. It makes me less
homesick."
Many doctoral students are mar
ried and have their own kids. Being
afraid that their children would for
get the Chinese cultural heritage,
they are eager to bring their kids to
this kind of events.
Liping Lai's husband is in a doc
toral student in engineering-eco
nomic systems and operations re
search. She has a 9-year-old daugh
ter and a 2-year-old son.
"I want them to know about Chi
nese culture, said Lai, as she
watched her kids eating yuan xiao
and playing with other Chinese kids.
"They grow up in a foreign country
and seldom have a chance to know
about China."
"This event perfectly gives them
the opportunity."
