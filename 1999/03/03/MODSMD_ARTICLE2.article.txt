They are all around you. in dor
mitories. classes and sporting
events. You've probably bumped
into a few at the Coffee House or
even eaten dinner with one in your
dining hall. They are National Merit
Scholar finalists, and Stanford has a
lot of them.
Stanford ranked third in the na

tion in enrollment of freshman Na
tional Merit Scholar finalists in
1998, according to a recent report in
the Chronicle of Higher Education.
According to the Chronicle,
Stanford enrolled 201 Merit Schol
ars. none of whom received scholar
ships paid for by the University. Just
ahead, the University of Texas at
Austin enrolled 202 Merit Scholars
with 149 sponsored by the universi
ty. In first by a large margin was
Harvard with 370 Merit Scholars
and no university scholarships.
Stanford and Harvard have high
enrollment of Merit Scholars de
spite the fact that there are no spe
cial recruitment programs or finan
cial packages specifically targeted at
them.
"We do not use any programs to
recruit National Merit Scholars, yet
there are always a very large num
ber of them in our applicant pool,"
explained Robert Kinnally, dean of
admissions and financial aid. Na
tional Merit Scholars "who do not
receive a corporate-sponsored
award do not receive University
funds unless they are eligible for a
need-based scholarship as part of
their financial package."
The same is true at Harvard.
"Our recruitment is aimed very
broadly. There is nothing specific
aimed at National Merit Scholars,"
commented Bill Fitzsimmons, dean
of admissions and financial aid at
Harvard.
However, many universities and
colleges heavily recruit Merit Schol
ars for their freshman class.
"We coordinate a mass mail-out

targeting [National Merit Scholar
ship] semi-finalists and explain to
them what they can get if they are a
finalist or semi-finalist," explained
Michael Orr, assistant director of
admissions at UT-Austin. The
Merit Scholar Finalists who choose
to attend UT-Austin receive $4,000
for their first year and $3,(XX) every
year after that. If they are not from
Texas, the university waives the out
of-state part of their tuition.
Steve Riley, a freshman Merit
Scholar at Stanford, was recruited
hv several other universities.
According to Riley, the Univer
sity of Oklahoma offered him
$50,(XX) and UCSD offered him full
tuition, plus a $I,(XX) dollar a year
stipend.
However, Riley went on to ex
plain that choosing Stanford was
easy for him. "Money wasn't a big
problem because 1 could get money
from Stanford. They offer to meet
1 (X) percent of your calculated need.
Obviously, this place had a better
reputation and better faculty. Its
worth it to come here and take out a
few loans."
Said Kinnally, "Merit Scholars
are among the best students out
there, and they obviously wish to
study at the best university in the
world. They know that Stanford of
fers incomparable resources, emi
nent faculty and impressive peers.
It's as simple as that."
