## Male milers make mark The 						Farm now a middle-distance haven 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
There was a time when it was not
thought to be humanly possible to
run faster than four minutes for the
mile. Back then, indoor tracks were
the dirt floors of old armories, Nike
was still just the Greek goddess of
victory and Stanford University was
not yet an athletic powerhouse.
As Stanford heads to the Indi
anapolis RCA Dome this weekend
to compete in the NCAA Indoor
National Championships, the team
can boast three sub-four-minute
milers of its own and at least one
other runner right on the cusp of the
mark.
Junior Michael Stember, sopho
more Jonathon Riley and the cur
rently redshirting sophomore
Gabriel Jennings have all broken
through the 4:00 barrier during the
last year. Jennings was first to do so
at the Mt. San Antonio College
Relay meet last year with his 3:59.32
clocking. Stember broke through on
July 4 in a race in Maine with a time
of 3:59.31 and Riley, the most recent
inductee to the sub-four club, ran
3:58.72 at the lowa State Cyclone
Classic on Feb. 13.
"In the United States, the four
minute mile is a great benchmark
and milestone," said Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna. "It has always
had a great charm and a great appeal

to it."
The mile, once the marquee
event of track and field, has widely
been replaced by the 1,500-meter
run and is now raced by collegians
indoors only. However, the mys
tique and glory of running better
than four minutes for the mile has
not been tarnished.
"The mile is the perfect test of the
combination of all of your energy
systems â€” aerobic, anaerobic,
everything," said Riley.
"1 think that the mile, from the
beginning, has been an amazing and
magical race." said Jennings. "When
I broke four. I was glowing."
All three of Stanford's sub-four
milers were highly regarded high
school runners, each bearing the
weight of sub-four prognostications
at the prep level.
Though the conditions of high
school races never quite led to the
sub-4:00 mile for the trio, college has
been a different story.
However, before Stember ar
rived on the Farm. Stanford had not
recently been heralded as a miler's
haven. Lananna was better known
for his production of some the na
tion's finest longer distance runners.
"When [Lananna] recruited me,
he told me that he was going to try to
turn around the middle-distance
program at Stanford," said Stember.
"1 saw myself as a huge brick in the
foundation of the middle-distance

stronghold that he was building."
With Stember joining runners
like former 800-meter specialists
Jake Maas and Jason Lunn, Stan
ford became even more enticing for
blue-chip recruits like Jennings and
Riley.
"1 think Stember was a huge
draw." said Jennings. "We compet
ed against him in high school, when
he was the king."
"With Michael and Gabe com
ing. 1 knew Stanford would be a mid
dle distance powerhouse," Riley
said.
It didn't take long for Stanford's
milers to benefit from each other's
energy.
"1 think we've all got very differ
ent strengths that we can each feed
off of and it makes us all better," said
Maas, who as a senior has recently
moved up to the mile.
As a 4:01.48 miler, Maas has con
tributed greatly to the success of
Stanford's middle-distance ranks.
By sharing the load in workouts and
proving his own mettle in competi
tion. Maas has helped push the other
milers toward greatness and has also
developed into a big contributor for
the Cardinal.
"Everyone's got the same goals.
When you get so many guvs that are
competitive, it just sort of rubs off on
you." Riley said. "You get a group of
these guys training, and you start to
do things you never knew you could
do."
Freshman Jonathan Stevens, a
top recruit out of Fremont, Calif.,
and Mark Hassell, primarily an N(lO
meter man, have also contributed to
the triumphs of this group.
"We all have radically different
personalities and radically different
race strategies and tactics that coach
has to try to put together," Jennings

said. "But beyond all that, when the
gun goes off and the race starts, it's
whoever has the most guts. We all
have that competitive spirit, and
that's our common bond."
And what is the next step for
these mile specialists?
"As far as goals go, [legendary
distance runner Steve] Prefontaine
said it right: No runner is truly satis
lied until he's got a gold medal in his
hands," Stember said. "1 think that's
the ultimate goal we're all trying to
get at."
Right now. though. Stember,
Riley and Maas are focused on help

ing the team to a possible indoor na
tional championship, while Jennings
prepares for a return in the outdoor
season.
Stemberand Riley currently hold
the No. 1 and 2 rankings in the
NCAA for the mile at 3:58.50 and
3:58.72, respectively, and Jake
Maas's mark is good enough to put
him in national championship con
tention.
"I don't think any of the guys
have thoughts of times for this week
end. I think they'd be just as satisfied
if they ran 4:20 and won the
NCAAs," Lananna said.
