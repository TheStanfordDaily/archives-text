The No. 1 men's tennis team
ended the first half of its season per
fectly by defeating Utah 7-0 yester

Center. The Cardinal picked up its
doubles play, which had been giving
it problems of late, and used that
momentum to sweep all six single's
matches.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Yesterday: No. 1 Stanford 7
UtahO.

"This was a good match to end
this phase of our season," said Stan
lord head coach Dick Gould. "We
came out and played strong doubles
and did not let up at all in the sin
gles."
Assistant coach John Whitlinger
agreed with Gould.
"Our No. 3 doubles looked bet
ter than it has in a long time," he
said. " That was encouraging. We
can feel good about going into the
break after this match, but we know
we still have a lot of work to do.
There are definitely things we can
still improve on."
In yesterday's match, Gould
gave No. 4 singles player K.J. Hip
pensteel a rest in the singles, which
made room for junior David
Houser to step in. It was Houser's
first match of the season, and al
though he started out a bit overanx

ious, he was able to pull through
and win the match in three sets. He
improved each set and had his
whole game working in a 6-1 victo

ry in the third.
"I came out a little slow because

Sophomore Ali Ansari hits a cross-court backhand in yesterday's
Cardinal victory. Ansari, along with doubles partner Scotty Scott,
won 8-4.
I was a bit nervous and just overex
cited," Houser said.
In addition to Houser, sopho
mores Scotty Scott and Ali Ansari
played solid tennis as well. The two
had been struggling a bit in their
doubles of late, but they put it to
gether yesterday and were in com
plete control in their 8-4 win.
"We started to get our confidence

back in the doubles," Scott said.
Scott also said that he believed
the entire team played aggressively
in the singles, something it needs to
do more often.
Senior leader Ryan Wolters
agreed with Scott. Playing with ju
nior Geoff Abranis in his doubles
match, Wolters got off to a bit of a
slow start before storming back to
win y-7.
Wolters also got off to a slow start
in his No. I singles match, but he
once again fired back to win in

straight sets.
"It was a tough match to fire up
for because we have had a long week
and we could easily have looked
ahead to our break," Wolters said.
"It was good for Geoff and me to
come up with a win in the doubles
after being down."
The entire Cardinal squad knows
it will have to raise its intensity and
level of play for the second half of
the season. It travels this weekend to
La Jolla for a doubles tournament
and then is off until spring break.
