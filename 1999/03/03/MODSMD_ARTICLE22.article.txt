# Track has individual focus
## 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
Believe it or not, track and field is
a team sport. Athletes are continual
ly asked to compete in events that
they may not feel most comfortable
in for the sake of the team. Racing
strategies are sometimes changed to
help pace a teammate.
Fortunately for Julia Stamps,
Sally Glynn and Courtney Adams,
they won't have to think about any
thing else except their own races this
Friday and Saturday at the NCAA
Indoor Track and Field Champi
onships in Indianapolis, Ind.
Competing for the team title is an
impossibility as these three distance
runners are the only Stanford
women heading to RCA Dome.
While these women may be used to

working as a team both in cross
country and track, individual honors
will be the sole motivation this
weekend.
They travel with high hopes, led
by sophomore Stamps. Competing
in the 3,(XX)-meter run. Stamps is en
tering the meet with the best time in
the country this season. After a
fourth-place finish at indoor nation
als last year in the 3,(XX), along with
her fourth- and sixth-place finishes
in her two cross country NCAA
races, Stamps is primed to make the
final step toward collegiate great
ness.
Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na is optimistic about Stamps'
chances.
"I think that Julia has enough rac
ing under her belt; she's been at four
NCAA Championships," said

Lananna. "She understands what
she has to do in order to perform at
the highest level."
Joining Stamps on the starting
line on Saturday will be Adams.
Chasing her first All-America
honor, Adams will likely have the
crowd behind her. as Indianapolis is
her home town. Entering the meet
with the 12th best time in the nation,
she will have her work cut out for
her.
By the time Adams and Stamps
battle it out Saturday. Glynn will
hopefully have proceeded through
the mile preliminaries on Friday as
well the final on Saturday. After
missing the Mountain Pacific Cham
pionship meet due to illness, Glynn
will look to return to the form that
landed her a fifth-place finish at
cross country nationals this year.
