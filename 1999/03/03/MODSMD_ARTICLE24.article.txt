# Men set for Nat'ls
## Cardinal has title hopes 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
The Indianapolis RCA Dome
will be the setting for the NCAAs
finest indoor track and field com
petition this weekend as the Stan
ford Cardinal joins athletes from
around the nation to compete in
the NCAA Indoor National
Championships.
This year. Stanford hopes to
turn the tables on perennial power
house Arkansas, which came out
ahead of the Cardinal last year
with a final tally of 56-36.5.
Sending 12 athletes to compete
in the meet, the Cardinal may have
its best shot at the indoor title ever.
Only 14 athletes per event — all of
whom have met either the auto
matic or provisional qualifying
standard — are invited to compete
in the national meet.
"This year's meet is going to be
very exciting because we have such
a great track and field team," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "It's a
great accomplishment just to make
it to the NCAA level. We're be
yond that now, and I think it's ex
citing for the kids to have a chance
to create their own dynasty."
South Carolina and Southern
Methodist are also national-caliber
teams which will join Arkansas in
putting the Cardinal to task.
Representing for the Cardinal
in the field events will be Adam
Connollv, Stanford's all-time

leader in the 35-pound weight
throw, and Toby Stevenson, the
best pole vaulter that Stanford has
ever called its own.
On the track. Stanford will send
a host of distance runners who look
to give Stanford the bulk of its po
tential points.
Doubling in the 3,000- and
5,000-meter runs will be brothers
Brad and Brent Hauser.
Brad is the returning champion
in the 5,000, and currently ranks
second in the nation at that event
and fourth in the 3,000. Brent
ranks third and eighth at the same
events.
Seniors Jason Balkman and
Nathan Nutter will join the
Ha users in the 5,000 and are
ranked fifth and seventh, respec
tively, at the distance nationally.
Michael Stember, Jake Maas
and Jonathon Riley are all slated to
compete in the mile run.and senior
captain Jeff Allen and either
sophomore Mark Hassell or fresh
man Jonathan Stevens will team up
with two of the distance runners
for the distance medley relay.
And though the Cardinal will be
mired in gut-wrenching competi
tion all meet long. Lananna is try
ing to keep the focus on the joy of
competing.
"For us, this meet and the whole
indoor season is a whole lot of
fun." Lananna said. "If we can do
something as a team, great, but the
fun is what it's all about."
