## Are college students ready to join a hair club for men? Bug contemplates the causes and cures of baldness in men

Q: Why am 1 going bald?
A: Well, if you're the guy in my philosophy class
who's always clawing and tugging at his few
remaining wisps of hair between asking confused
questions and leaving for "smoke breaks," I've got
a fairly simple explanation for you.
But 1 think I'll address the at-large male popu
lation on campus that might be starting to see the
beginnings (or in some cases, more advanced
stages) of baldness.
Given that your situation isn't due to a unique
problem such as poor scalp blood circulation, mal
nutrition, chemotherapy, clogged follicles or lack

of vitamins, your problem is probably a result of
the onset of male pattern baldness.
First of all, what is hair anyway? The adult male
body averages five million hair follicles, of which
1 (K),(XK) to 350,000 are on the scalp.
Hair is composed of keratin, the same protein
that makes up nails and the outer layer of your
skin. The part seen rising out of the skin is called
the hair shaft or strand. Each strand consists of lay
ers. The outermost protective layer (cuticle) is thin
and colorless. The middle layer, or cortex , is the
thickest. It provides strength and determines your
hair color and whether your hair is straight or
curly.
Not all hair follicles are productive. In each
producing follicle, the duration of the hair's life
cycle is influenced by age, pathology and a wide

variety of physiological factors.
Throughout their lives, males produce varying
amounts of testosterone to facilitate the maturing
and aging process. Some of the testosterone is con
verted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone
that encourages the development of secondary sex
characteristics, like hair. The conversion from
testosterone to DHT is driven by an enzyme called
5-alpha reductase, which is produced in the
prostate, various adrenal glands and the scalp.
During adolescence, this hormone stimulates
hair follicles to produce hair all over the body, but
specifically targeted at the head, genitals, chest
and armpits.
However, after adolescence and over time, the
action of DHT causes hair follicles to slowly
degrade and shortens the development cycle of a
hair. Though the follicle is technically still alive
and connected to a good blood supply, it will grad
ually grow smaller and smaller.
A few of the follicles will eventually die, but
most of them will simply reduce to the size they
were at birth, resulting in thinner, weaker hairs.
With a steadily shorter development cycle, more
hairs are shed, and the hairs become thinner and
thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear
and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from
long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, frag
ile sprouts.
Recent research indicates there may also be an
immunological factor in balding. Basically, the
immune system begins to target the degrading hair
follicles in the hair loss area. The current theory is
that the rise in male hormones such as DHT dur
ing puberty initiates this process. This may be why
many pharmaceuticals which lower testosterone
levels and inhibit DHT production do not com
pletely stop and reverse the hair loss process.
Q: How can I prevent or at least stow balding?
A: There are many commercial drugs on the mar
ket that block the production of DHT. The drugs'
manufacturers make impressive claims, but they
have achieved marginal success rates. Some drugs
even have sexual side effects that decrease poten
cy and the ability to maintain erection, which
seems a bit counterproductive given that most col
lege students are probably worried about their
hair because of dating and mate-finding issues.
If it is true that DHT is the main inhibitor of the
follicle's production, then the only sure way to
eliminate DHT is to eliminate the presence of
testosterone in the body. Ever met a bald eunuch?
