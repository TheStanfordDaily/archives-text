# Science slows speed of light
## Research tethers the velocity of light to 38 miles per hour 
### Ryan Chuang Contributing writer 
Light travels at 186,282 miles
per second in a vacuum. But a
physics team in Boston, including
Prof. Steve E. Harris of the
Applied Physics and Electrical
Engineering Departments, has
managed to slow down the speed
of light to 38 miles per hour —
reducing the speed of light by a
factor of 20 million.
The group, headed by Lene
Vestegaard Hau of the Rowland
Institute for Science and Harvard
University, eventually expects to
slow the speed of light to the rate
of a tortoise — 120 feet an hour.
Hau, two Harvard graduate
students and Harris had their
achievement reported in the Feb.
18 issue of Nature.
Scientists have known for years
that they can slow down the speed
of light slightly by shining it
through a transparent medium
such as glass, plastic or diamond.
Indeed, for the last seven years,
one of Harris' research groups has
studied an optical effect called
"electromagnetically induced
transparency" in ordinary atoms.
Using this optical effect, the sci
entists make ordinarily opaque
clouds of vapor transparent.
Four years ago, the Harris
group was able to slow light to less
than 120,000 miles per second by
shining it through a cloud of illu
minated lead atoms
Harris gave a lecture on the
subject at Harvard a little more
than a year ago, suggesting that
the speed of light could be slowed
even further.
"Lene was in the audience and
was very interested, so we set up a
collaboration," Harris said,
explaining how the project began.
Hau proceeded to slow the
speed of light by shooting a laser
beam through a super-cooled glob
of optical sodium molecules —

called a Bose-Einstein condensate
— that were only 50 billionths of a
degree above absolute zero.
Dr. Hau's group reached this
ultra-low temperature in stages,
using lasers to slow the atoms in a
confined gas and then evaporating
away the warmest remaining
atoms.
The temperature attained was
one of the lowest ever reached in a
laboratory and was far cooler than
anything in nature, even in the
depths of space.
The laser techniques for chill
ing atoms were first suggested by
Stanford Nobel laureate Arthur
Schawlow and actually done for
the first time by a research team
headed by Prof. Steve Chu in the
Physics Department before
Schawlow came to Stanford. Chu
won the Nobel Prize in 1997 for
this achievement.
Bose-Einstein condensates are
named after the two physicists,
Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert
Einstein, who first predicted the
existence of this new type of mat
ter.
In a Bose-Einstein condensate,
atoms are so cold they are forced
to overlap with one another and
merge into superatoms sharing the
same properties.
Currently, the process of slow
ing light this way is too expensive
to have any practical applications.
In the future, however, this
research has the potential to help
create ultrasensative night-vision
goggles and improve computers
and communication devices.
The research could also lead to
techniques for making television
displays and laser light shows
more vivid.
Indeed, according to Harris. "If
it cost a quarter to do, instead of
$250,000, you would see it all over
the place."
In early April, Hau will speak
at the Applied Physics / Physics
Colloquium at Stanford.
