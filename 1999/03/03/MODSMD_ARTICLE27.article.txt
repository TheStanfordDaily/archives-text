# Parasite makes salmon and trout chase their tails
## Whirling disease threatens lives of endangered fish and inspires immunological studies 
### Joanne Wu Editorial staff 
Sure, dogs chase their tails, and cats occasionally
indulge in swatting at their tails, but what does it mean
when fish start chasing their tails?
Unfortunately, the whirling disease, which aptly
describes the parasitic infection that causes fish to swim
in erratic circles, threatens many salmon and trout popu
lations in the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest. Stan
ford researchers, led by Prof. Peter Parham of the Struc
tural Biology Department, have collaborated with scien
tists from UC-Davis to study this disease. Each group has
received $75,000 in funding from the Whirling Disease
Foundation.
The parasite Myxobolus cerebralis invades young lish
through the skin, rapidly multiplying within the head and
spinal cartilage. The resulting pressure on nerves in the
brain stem and spinal cord causes the lish to engage in
characteristic whirling behavior. I he parasite originally
came from Europe and was introduced into North
American waters as an invasive species in the late 19505.
Since then, it has spread to 22 states.
Each infected fish that dies releases into the aquatic
ecosystem thousands of highly resilient parasite spores
that can survive for up to 30 years. In the water, these
spores are ingested by the tubifex worm, an alternate
host of the parasite. The spores hatch inside the worm
into the parasitic form that can once again infect young
trout. Fish can also become infected by eating other dis
eased fish.
"The problem is extensive, and it's getting worse,"
said Pathology Prof. Irving Weissman, a member of the
Whirling Disease Foundation's scientific advisory board.
"It has utterly devastated the fishing in the Madison
River (in Montana]. The rainbow trout used to be sever
al thousand per mile, and they are now down to less than
fifty per mile."
The rapid destruction of native trout populations has
raised concern from many sectors.
"One good thing about the whirling disease is that it

has pulled together investigators from various disciplines
to focus on a particular fish disease," said Benny Shum,
research assistant in Parham's lab and lead investigator of
the whirling disease project. "At a recent whirling disease
meeting, we had presentations from scientists, field biol
ogists, ecologists, epidemiologists and even economists.
In the end, all these scientific fields will benefit from such
endeavors," Shum said.
Fortunately, the parasite is not transmissible to
humans. Still, researchers want to find the pathological
reason behind the vulnerability of certain fish species to
fatal effects of the disease.
"As observed from the field or in laboratory settings.

rainbow trout, steelhead trout, chinook salmon, kokanee
salmon, cutthroat trout and brook trout are all found to
be highly susceptible," Shum explained. "However,
species like coho salmon and brown trout appear to be
quite resistant to the disease."
Steelhead trout, chinook salmon, sockeye salmon and
various cutthroat trout are all listed as threatened or
endangered in specific regions of the United States —
one reason motivating research on the whirling disease.
Furthermore, Shum said, "besides catfish, the salmon
species are the most important aquacultural fin-fish crop
in the United States."
Stanford researchers hope to understand the mecha

nism that allows close relatives of the susceptible species,
such as coho salmon and brown trout, to become infect
ed with the parasite while rarely showing any symptoms
of clinical disease.
"Our knowledge on the immune system of fish is still
quite poor," Shum said. "One question we would like to
answer is why certain species of salmon are resistant to
whirling disease while others are susceptible."
"We would also like to characterize the polymorphic
genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
to examine whether or not they are involved in disease
resistance and how they are distributed in wild trout pop
ulation," Shum said. "We want to understand the diver
sity of these fish and see if some of them have genetic
resistance to the disease."
The MHC is a cell surface molecule that binds foreign
antigens such as fragments of viruses, parasites or bacte
ria and display them on the outside of the cell, activating
other components of the immune system. The shape of
MHC molecules is extremely variable in order to bind a
wide variety of antigens.
In humans, different forms of these MHC molecules
convey resistance to certain infectious diseases, and
Parham and Shum suspect that this same mechanism
may hold true in fish. In an effort to correlate immune
system genes with symptoms of whirling disease, they
plan to study the MHC genes of a range of fish. Their
experiments will examine fish that are infected with
known doses of the whirling disease parasite, natural
populations of disease-resistant fish from different rivers
and a random sample of fish from hatcheries.
If a genetically transmitted resistance factor linked to
the MHC is discovered, Weissman believes that a simple
breeding program could be used to successfully repopu
late areas where fish populations have been decimated.
Wild trout could be bred with trout that have the resis
tant gene or genes and be raised in an environment free
of the parasite. The resistant fish could then be released
back into their native regions.
"Peter Parham is the world's leading researcher in the
[MHC] field," Weissman said. "This approach is our one
best hope."
