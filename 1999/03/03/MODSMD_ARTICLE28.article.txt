■ Yesterday: No. 9 Nevada (11-6)
7. No. 6 Stanford (12-6) 4.

A light Tuesday afternoon
turnout soaked in the good weather
during the first three innings as the
Cardinal began to establish its con
trol over Nevada.

Then, the wind blew in, clouds
covered the sun. the fans left and
Nevada (11-6) took the lead, the
momentum and the confidence.
Despite outhitting the Wolfpack,
No. 4 Stanford (12-6) never recov
ered and lost, 7-4.
Nevada's five bloop runs in the
fifth inning really put the game out
of reach.
Although four of those runs
were charged to freshman Mike
Wodnicki (1-0, 5.87 ERA), the
swirling wind and resulting defen
sive misplays were just as influen
tial.
"Give them credit; we walk a
couple guys, miss a couple balls and
they back it up with hits," said head
coach Mark Marquess. "That one
inning was the difference in the

game."
Sophomore Justin Wayne (2-1,
5.91 ERA) started the game for the
Cardinal and pitched a perfect two
innings. The right-hander struck
out four of the six hatters he faced
before being taken out to rest up for
his start against Arizona State Sat
urday.
Freshman left-hander Dan Rich
(1-0, ().(KJ ERA) then followed with
a quick three-up, three-down in
ning.
However, the Wolfpack circled
around the next two pitchers Mar
quess brought into the game.
Nevada junior Ryan Church
started the game for the Wolfpack
and shut Stanford down for six solid
innings. He allowed six hits but
never let the Cardinal score a run.
