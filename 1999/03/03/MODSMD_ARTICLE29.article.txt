WOMEN'S LACROSSE

■ Today: Stanford (1-1) vs. Santa Clara (0-2), 3:30 p.m.,
New Maloney Field.

Santa Clara could prove a serious speed bump on
the Stanford ride, though. The Broncos, stumbling out
of the blocks this season, kick off a tough homestand
for the Stanford women, and the last thing the team
wants to do is suffer a letdown after the emotional high
of last Saturday's win.
"We never look past any games," said Stanford
head coach I Icidi Connor. "We prepare for them all in
kind of the same way. But we look at this as a time to
... run through some plays and get ourselves to a point
where we're comfortable with each other on the field."
The Cardinal players that sent the Aggies packing
this weekend certainly looked far more comfortable
with each other than the team that lost to California in
the final seconds of the season opener Feb. 21. Seven
players scored in the win. including four of the 11 Stan
lord freshmen: Jenny Silverman. Caroline Osterwise,
Li/ Britt and Sara Lev.
The freshman class has proven —even this early in
the season — to be a critical asset to both ends of the
Cardinal's game. The young defense showed impres
sive composure against Davis' physical play and
meshed well with the solid goaltending of veteran se
nior goalie Stephanie Tuerk.
The Broncos begin a tough week for the team,
which has four games in 10 days. With a pair of show
downs this weekend with St. Mary's and Duquesne,
the Cardinal's conditioning will be tested in its first
back-to-back series of the season.
"This week is going to be mostly about physical con
ditioning. as we take on Santa Clara Wednesday, St.
Mary's Saturday and then Duquesne on Sunday." said
senior captain Alexis Patri/io. "We have to prove that
we are physically and mentally able to step up to the
challenge of three games in a row."
The coaching staff thinks its squad is well prepared
for the week.
Stanford assistant coach Ethan Scott said. "The
team has shown pretty good conditioning. The team

this year has a lot of depth with all the freshman, so we
can do a lot more substituting late in games and we can
bring in some fresher people."
The win this weekend, despite giving the team some
much-needed confidence, has a flip side; the Broncos
will be looking to make a statement against the revi
talized Cardinal.
"They will come out hard against us, giving it every
thing they've got because a win for them over Stanford
would be huge," said Patrizio.
Last year's playoff loss to Stanford is another fire
burning under the Broncos' bellies. Santa Clara strug
gled through a tough first-round playoff victory
against St. Mary's only to meet Stanford the following
day. The C ardinal demolished Santa Clara 19-4 behind
junior Hcdy Born's six goals.
All Stanford is hoping for this week, though, is a win
and a chance to ride its early momentum all the way
into the heart of the season. If it can get by Santa Clara
without a hiccup, it'll be well on its way.
