						year to explore: students laud break after high school

While so many Stanford students
seem to arrive freshman year
through a logical progression of
events in their educational develop
ment — grammar school, high
school, college — some current stu
dents praise the concept of time off
before college.
Dean of Admissions Robert Kin
nally reports an upward trend over
the past several years of educational
thinkers who decide to defer Stan
ford for a year to do something else.
"You have to work hard in high
school, and you have to work hard
here." Kinnally said. "For some stu
dents. [a year off] is exactly the right
thing."
Junior Emily Gaines deferred ad
mission to Stanford so that she could
take a year to study with the Pacific

Northwest Ballet in Seattle.
"Looking back, I'm really glad I
took a year off," Gaines said. "Danc
ing was at the time what I really want
ed to do. I always would have won
dered if I hadn't given it a try."
Gaines, who has been dancing se
riously since sixth grade, was not will
ing to sacrifice her high school edu
cation for dancing, which was the
typical trend of other girls in her
company.
"In the dance environment,
everyone grew up really fast," she
said. "Girls left home at sixteen to
live in their own apartments and
study ballet full-time." Gaines' un
willingness to do this in high school
put her at somewhat of a disadvan
tage.
Gaines admitted that she was
slightly apprehensive of the transi
tion into freshman dorm life, but she
also found that a year off helped her

to focus and really want to be at
school.
"All freshman year, I just kept
thinking, 'if my friends from ballet
could see me now ...'" since their
lives were going in such different di
rections.
Senior Assoc. Director of Admis
sions Jon Reider said, "It all depends
on what use you make of your year
off." he said. "Often it changes peo
ple's view of the world, and it's great
when they can articulate that."
Sophomore Nathan Osborne
took a different approach to an acad
emic hiatus before college, spending
14 months on European tour with an
enterprise promoting the Baha'i reli
gion through dance.
Called Diversity Dance Work
shop, the international group chore
ographs dances dealing with unity of
mankind, a central tenet of Baha'i.
"I didn't want to study" right after

high schix)l, said Osborne who had
intended to take some time off as a
way of gaining a mi>re gl< >bal and per
sonal perspective before entering
Stanford. "I wanted to learn hands
on, and be around people of all dif
ferent backgrounds."
Returning to the United States
for his freshman year, however, ini
tially made Osborne feel like a bit of
a foreigner.
"1 had experienced so much per
sonal development in Europe," he
said. "Plus I had gained a funky ac
cent from all the people in the dance
group, so people freshman year
thought I was foreign."
Despite the initial transition,
which Osborne admits he gradually
"got used to," his experience really
gave him a sense that he had some
thing to add to the dormitory.
Undergraduate admissions sup
ports students taking time off like

this, according to Reider and Kinnal
ly. Taking a year off "allows students
to make a contribution, figure out the
world, mature," Kinnally said. "This
serves students well and serves the
community well — and some people
just need a break."
Kinnally remarked that students
in general seem more reflective and
self-examined when they take a year
to start asking themselves more
questions.
Antonia Welch, a junior, felt a
twinge of reverse culture shock when
she returned from a year off as a vol
unteer working with cancer- and
AIDS-infected children in Bogota,
Colombia.
Her work with Casa del Oso. a
shelter for children with cancer, al
lowed her to facilitate hospice care
for kids who are abandoned in the
city.
"There are times when I cried, felt

overwhelmed and out of place, or
when I couldn't communicate effec
tively," Welch said. "It can be ex
tremely frustrating." Because of the
nature of the work she did in Colom
bia, Welch expected the transition to
freshman year to be tough.
She often had the sense that, "I've
been helping children die, and
you've been drinking beer." though
she admits her thinking was face
tious.
"1 never met anyone who had
gone through anything like it, but I
certainly met people who appreciat
ed the depth of my experience," she
said.
Despite the difficulty she experi
enced with freshman year, Welch ac
knowledges the lasting effect her
year off has made on her life.
."1 would absolutely tell people to
consider a year off — the amount
you gain is infinite."
