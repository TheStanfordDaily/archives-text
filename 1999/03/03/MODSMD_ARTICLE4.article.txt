# No Greeks housed
## All applications turned down for 1999-2000 year 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
None of the seven Greek chapters that applied for
housing for the 1999-2(XX) academic year was awarded a
house. Director of Residential Education Jane Camar
illo announced last night.
This recommendation was made by the Greek Hous
ing Review Committee and accepted by Camarillo; both
agreed that "no organization fully met the criteria stat
ed in the University's Greek Housing Policy," Camaril
lo wrote.
The review committee included representatives
from the offices of the Dean of Students. Student Activ
ities, Student and Housing Services, Housing Assign
ment Services, the Interfraternity Council, the Inter
sorority Council and the Greek Judicial Board, as well
as a faculty member.
The criteria include a history of good conduct, good
standing with the University, stable financial manage
ment history, strong student leadership, active partic
ipation in Greek leadership activities and meaningful
on-going community service.
Camarillo's statement made it clear that "(Residen
tial Education's] committment to Greek housing re
mains strong." and that the goal of such housing "is to
have highly successful housed Greek chapters that will
both strengthen the Greek system and be a positive con
tribution to the entire residential program."
"Of the seven, the two sorority proposals were the
strongest," Camarillo's statement read. "If these two
chapters maintain the strength of their organization
while addressing identified areas for development, I be
lieve they will be strong candidates for housing for the
fall of 2000."
The two sororities that applied for housing this year

are Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.
"We're a little disappointed, hut we'll apply again for
housing next year," Pi Phi's president Tara Hale, a se
nior, said. "[We're] a dynamic group of women who will
remain a prominent group on campus, and I think it will
work out for the best in the end."
Ted Leng, a senior and president of Sigma Phi Ep
silon, one of the fraternities that applied for housing,
echoed Hale's emotions.

"Obviously we're very disappointed with the Uni
versity's decision," Leng said. "We realize some of the
reasons why they might have denied housing to Greek
organizations on campus this year, and we think that
they are reasonable in their decisions."
Mike Wilson, a senior and president of Phi Kappa
Psi, thought the application process was fair and estab
lished reasonable goals.
Leng noted that "we weren't given housing because
our vision for what we would like to do as a housed fra
ternity was not perfectly in concert with the administra
tion's current frame of thought."

Policy."

Education
However, like both Wilson and
Hale, Leng is optimistic.
"We remain positive that the ad
ministration is committed to hous
ing Greek organizations in the fu
ture and that Sig Ep will he one of

them."
Senior Kevin Friedman, presi
dent of Alpha Epsilon Pi, was en
couraging as well. "We're a very
strong, close-knit fraternity, and at
this point I think we can get that
across to the University in the fu
ture."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
stated, .. housing is very tight on

campus. Greek housing is a privi
lege — one that is afforded no other
self-selected group."
All chapters that applied for
housing were contacted and given
feedback on the "strengths and
weaknesses of their proposals," Ca
marillo said.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya said that the Uni

versity envisions having 10 to 12
Greek organizations housed. " This
year's decision does not reflect a
change in that vision but instead
suggests that we must work more
closely with fraternities and sorori
ties so that they may more fully
meet the criteria established by the
Greek Housing Policy" adopted in
the fall of 1997.
