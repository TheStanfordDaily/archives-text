# Are Students quake Safe?
## 
### Virginia Yang Contributing writer 
California: sunshine, beaches,
surfers and earthquakes. If you at
tended high school in the Bay
Area, you remember being bom
barded by earthquake drills and
earthquake safety workshops. But
since coming to Stanford, this edu
cation hasn't been as much of a
presence.
Although the University pro
vides an Earthquake Safety Hand
book and has some programming
to offer, it is really up to the student
to be prepared.
"We try to emphasize the im
portance of surviving by prepared
ness," said Jane Camarillo, director
of Residential Education.
When residents move into Uni
versity housing, they are presented
with a pamphlet titled. "Be Quake
Safe at Stanford: An Earthquake
Preparedness Guide for Students,"
developed by the University's En
vironmental Health and Safety De
partment.
The office is charged with train
ing faculty, staff and students in dis
aster preparedness, according to
Camarillo.
This pamphlet gives students in
formation on campus emergency
procedures, how to make their
rooms safer, what to include in
emergency kits, duck and cover
methods and what to do after the
earthquake.
Its tips include keeping heavy
objects away from one's bed, hav
ing an emergency kit ready, and
knowing the location of fire extin
guishers.
"The program really does re
volve around" the booklets handed
out at the beginning of the year,
said Camarillo.
But some students are con
cerned the message isn't getting
through.
As freshman Abbv Shaw said,
"we got too many handouts, and I
just didn't read any of it." Shaw,
originallv from Maine, had little

knowledge about earthquake safe
ty-
She said, "I think it would be a
good idea if during orientation
week, when they do the programs
on safety, they should include a
general earthquake safety informa
tion session."
Senior Noah Margolis said
"there is little to none in terms of
earthquake education." He sug
gested a program in conjunction
with the fire department because
"if a fireman came here, people
would listen to him."
He also felt that Residential Ed
ucation should provide each stu

dent room with basic earthquake
supplies.
With the majority of students
coming from regions where earth
quakes are not an issue, many stu
dents are unprepared.
Le Yu, a freshman from Michi
gan, said. "I think they should have
practice drills every quarter so if
there is an earthquake, I'll know
what to do."
Melinda Kong, a freshman from
Oakland, noticed a big difference
between the amount of education
about earthquakes she received in
high school in comparison to what
Stanford offers.

Kong said. "I don't think they
tell enough to students here. They
need to emphasize the importance
of having earthquake safety kits in
the rooms."
Junior Shanaira Udwaida sug
gested. "Dorms should do a pro
gram. it is as simple as showing you
what to do, where to stand and
what not to put on book shelves."
Some students, like freshman
Nicolas Urrutia. disagree.
"If there were to be a program,"
Urrutia said, "not enough people
would go to it. I doubt you could

get students really interested in it.
It's not an issue until it happens."
Resident assistants are educated
during their summer training ses
sions in earthquake preparedness.
Aditya Mathur, an RAin Eucalip
to. said "there are earthquake safe
ty points all around campus and
RAs are always provided with
lamps and flashlights and meeting
zones in the event of an earth
quake."
When asked about his residents,
he said, "I think the kids definitely

need to know more about general
earthquake safety.
As April is Earthquake Pre
paredness Month, Residential Ed
ucation is planning presentations
for resident fellows, encouraging
them to sponsor residence pro
grams on preparing for earth
quakes.
But "educating and getting peo
ple to act on that information" isn't
easy, said Camarillo.
Residential Education tries to
leave students and faculty "im
pressed by the possible impact of
earthquakes, and that they have
control over whether or not they
survive," she said.
