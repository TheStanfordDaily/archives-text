Buchanan announces run for presidency
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Pat Buchanan, the pugnacious
conservative whose insurgent campaigns hobbled Republican front
runners in 1992 and 1996, launched a third White House bid yesterday
with a pledge to fight "a moral deficit that has become America's great
enemy within."
Suggesting that the Clinton administration has contributed to "a
polluted and poisoned" culture, Buchanan delivered a full-throated
attack on the Democratic White House.
"This temple of our civilization has been desecrated, used to shake
down corporate executives, to lie with abandon to the American peo
ple, a place to exploit women," he said.
He promised to stand against unfettered imports, freewheeling
immigration, abortion, euthanasia, expanded judicial powers, a
shrinking American sovereignty and, at times, his own party — all
familiar themes of a Buchanan candidacy.
Though he has a history of exceeding their predictions, many GOP
strategists and conservative activists believe Buchanan's third race
won't be charmed. Working against him this time: a swelling field of
like-minded candidates, a greater demand for money and a relatively
late start.
Buchanan was hearing none of it.
"We need a new patriotism in America that puts country first, a
new conservatism of the heart that puts people first, and a new set of
priorities where our party stands for something higher and greater
than the bottom line on a balance sheet," he said.
A crowd of at least 3(X) yelled, "Go Pat, Go!"
"It is our calling to recapture the independence and lost sovereign
ty of our republic, to clean up all that pollutes our culture and to heal
the soul of America. And. to that end, I declare my candidacy for pres
ident of the United States."
Closing with his traditional battle cry. Buchanan grabbed the hand
of his wife, Shelley, and shouted: "As we say, mount up and ride to the
sound of the guns!"
"Pat can win if Washington doesn't demonize him," said Tom
Hamill of Braintree, Mass.
Buchanan's third campaign began where his others peaked, in this
first-in-the-nation primary state. He beat eventual nominee Bob Dole
in the New Hampshire primary four years ago and put a scare into
President Bush in 1992, finishing a close second.
Soon after, both times, Buchanan ran out of money and votes.
Buchanan, who took a leave of absence from CNN's "Crossfire" to
run, is trying to overtake the early GOP front-runners, Bush's son.
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and Dole's wife, former Red Cross pres
ident Elizabeth Dole.
Senate examines Y2K threats
WASHINGTON (AP) —The Senate dedicated yesterday to the
Year 20(H) computer problem, looking at threats ranging from small
business bankruptcies to Russian missile malfunctions.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah,
who head a special Senate panel on the "Y2K" problem, issued a 160-
page report outlining serious potential problems in health care, ener
gy supply and government services if action isn't taken to change com
puters by the end of the year.
They also emphasized that, for most Americans, disruptions in vital
services will be minimal. People can expect, Bennett said, "a bump in
the road, but it will not be crippling."
Seeking to allay fears of widespread social and economic chaos,
Dodd said people should have canned goods and water on hand Dec.
31 as a normal procedure, but there is no need to stockpile food.
The Senate, by 99-0, passed a bill establishing a Small Business
Administration program to provide loan guarantees to small compa
nies trying to repair computers or affected by interruptions in supplies.
The National Federation of Independent Business said more than
half the nation's small firms that use computers have yet to act to
make their systems immune to the Y2K bug. "The majority of small
businesses are not ready, and they are not even preparing," Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass., said. "It may come down to a choice between debt or
dissolution or rolling the dice."
The bill, 5.314, still needs House consideration.
The Bennett-Dodd report concurred that small businesses and
local governments that lack the money or expertise to repair their sys
tems faced the biggest risks.
It said 64 percent of hospitals, mostly smaller units, haven't tested
their Y2K repairs, and more than 80 percent of doctors' offices aren't
prepared. The effects could be temporary loss of medical records, or,
more serious, breakdowns in computerized equipment.
Bennett said telecommunications and power systems are in rela
tively good shape, but there's real reason to worry about oil imports
from such major suppliers as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Nigeria.
All are 12 to 18 months behind the United States in addressing Y2K
problems.
