Stanford received $336,454,561 worth of feder
al research-and-development grants in fiscal year
1997, second only to Johns Hopkins University,
which is at $724,526,000, according to University
officials and the Chronicle of Higher Education.

Stanford's grant represented an 11 percent in
crease over the previous year's figure, due to an in
crease in the government budget for the National
Institutes of Health, which contribute significant
funds to the medical school, according to Charles
kruger. dean of research and graduate policy.
The University's high ranking in terms of feder
al research-and-development expenditures speaks
to the potential of Stanford research departments.
The federal government doles out the grants each
year based on proposals received from individual
researchers.
" There is an established system in which re
searchers submit peer-reviewed proposals to the
National Science Foundation, asking for money,"

Kruger said.
"If electrical engineering faculty members
wanted a grant, for instance, they would submit
documents that outline their research, those pro
posals would be reviewed by government experts
in the field, and they would say whether their work
is deserving or not," he said.
Kruger also mentioned that Stanford's figure
excludes Department of Energy funding for the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, while Johns
Hopkins' includes the $393 million for its similar
Applied Physics Laboratory.
