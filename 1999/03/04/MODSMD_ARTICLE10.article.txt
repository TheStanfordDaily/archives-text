### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Moni-
ca Lewinsky told Barbara Walters
she regrets her role in causing pain
and suffering not only for her own
friends and family, hut for President
Clinton's family.
"1 wouldn't dream of asking
Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton to forgive
me." Lewinsky said last night in her
ABC interview. "But I would ask
them to know that 1 am very sorry
for what happened and for what
they've been through."
Barbara Walters of ABC won
the first interview with Lewinsky
since the former White House
intern's affair with Clinton burst into

the headlines last year.
The interview was timed to help
promote Lewinsky's book. "Moni
ca's Story." written with Princess
Diana biographer Andrew Morton.
When asked whether Clinton
was a sensual man, Lewinsky
described the president as "a very
sensual man" who feels conflicted
because of his "strong religious
upbringing."
Lewinsky had stinging words for
her former friend, Linda Tripp, who
secretly tape-recorded their tele
phone conversations and turned
them over to independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's investigators.
