# Court OKs disabled student funding
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Federal law
requires the nation's public school districts to pay
for one-on-one nursing services for some disabled
students throughout the school day.the Supreme
Court ruled yesterday in the case of an lowa teen
ager.
The court, by a 7-2 vote, said such continuous
care is not medical treatment and therefore must
be publicly funded under the federal Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act.
The decision means the Cedar Rapids Com
munity School District must pay thousands of dol
lars a year to provide nursing care for Garret Frey,
a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic who was par
alyzed from the neck down in a motorcycle acci
dent when he was 4 years old. Frey is now a high
school sophomore.
School officials in Cedar Rapids said the spe

cial help Garret requires is so involved and so
expensive it should he considered medical treat
ment. A federal appeals court disagreed, and
today the Supreme Court said the appeals court
was right.
"This case is about whether meaningful access
to the public schools will be assured, not the level
of education that a school must finance once
access is attained," Justice John Paul Stevens
wrote for the court. "Under the statute, our prece
dent and the purposes of the IDEA, the district
must fund such related services to help guarantee
that students like Garret are integrated into the
public schools."
Joining Stevens were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony M.
Kennedy dissented. In an opinion by Thomas,
they said the decision "blindsides unwary states
with fiscal obligations that they could not have
anticipated."
Through most of his schooling. Garret has
been assisted by a licensed practical nurse, paid
through an insurance policy and funds from the
$1.3 million settlement with the motorcycle com :
pany involved in the accident that paralyzed him.
Today's decision could subject the school dis
trict to more than $285,000 in legal fees and nurs
ing costs, although there had been little agreement
between the school district's lawyers and attor
neys for Garret's mother. Charlene Frey, over the
cost of providing one-on-one nursing care for him.
The school district's lawyers have estimated
that cost as $30,(XX) to $40,000 per year.
