We applaud Res Ed
for soliciting input
before making decision

IT SEEMS THAT the Office of
Residential Education learned
something from the campus furor
over last year's Greek housing deci
sions.
In sharp contrast to the secrecy and
disregard for student opinion that
marked last year's decision, Res Ed
made its decision not to grant housing
to any additional Greek groups this
year after a good-faith effort to solicit
student input.
The Greek Housing Review Com
mittee made its recommendation to
Res Ed after holding three focus
group meetings with more than 60
students from Row houses, the Inter
fraternity and Intersorority Councils
and the ASSIJ.
Students made suggestions regard
ing what criteria the committee
should consider in reviewing housing
applications from Greek groups.
The committee itself also included
student representatives from the IFC,
the ISC" and the Greek Judicial Board.
We commend Res Ed and the
housing review committee for
remembering the importance of stu
dent input and not turning a cold
shoulder in coming to a decision
about this important and potentially
controversial topic.
In a statement after the decision
was announced. Res Ed Director Jane
Camarillo stated that the goal of
Greek housing "is to have highly sue

cessful housed Greek chapters that
will both strengthen the Greek system
and he a positive contribution to the
entire residential program."
Such a goal cannot be reached
without campus acceptance of Res
Ed's decisions, and soliciting student
input is one way to ensure such accep
tance.
Granting houses to fraternities and
sororities is a difficult process because
Res Ed must try to strike a balance
between individual Greek organiza
tions and Row house communities
that have developed their own tradi
tions which students have become
attached to. No housing decision can
make everybody happy.
After last year's Greek housing
decision gave the former ATO and
Alpha Sig houses to the Delta Delta
Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta sorori
ties respectively, a storm of controver
sy exploded on campus as Alpha Sig
residents decried the lack of input stu
dents had in determining the fate of
their house.
Similarly, another storm could
have erupted after Tuesday's
announcement that all seven Greek
chapters that applied for housing
were denied.
However, the fact that representa
tives from these Greek organizations
maintained upbeat attitudes about
the possibility of future housing and
acknowledged the fairness of the pro
cess illustrates the success of Res Ed's
new decision making methods.
We hope that Res Ed will continue
to remember the importance of stu
dents' voices in making future deci
sions.
