# From the trenches
## Reaching occupational nirvana

Erin Bouchier

YOU'VE been
asked a thousand
times. Even if
you're a freshman, people
are already asking. If
you're a political science
major, they wonder if
vou're considering law

school. The chemistry majors get grilled
about med school applications. Classics
majors get... a blank stare. The question: so
what do you want to do after you finish up at
Stanford?
Ilmm. Unlike many Stanford students, I
have no plans for investment banking, com
puter science, consulting or medicine. So
what options am 1 left with? I have some
ideas.
1. Host of ESPN's Sports Center.
I realize I am no Chris Merman, not even
Linda Cohn. but I certainly want nothing
more than to be on Sports Center. 1 look at it
this way: 1 would get paid to watch, analyze
and talk about sports all day. Hey, I basically
do that pro bono right now. And the perks
would be incredible; 1 could interview MJ.
maybe even score a date with Kobe. I might
have to wear a lime green suit, replete with
shoulder pads a la Hannah Storm, but it's the
price you pay for fame. What about my
neighbor last year who said he would never
watch a woman talk about sports? Well, let's
be honest — who cares about him? Can't
you see it: me, sitting alongside Stuart Scott
in the studio in Bristol, Conn., giving the
NFL playoff highlights, using Berman-esque
nicknames like Eric "Sleeping With" Biene

my? I can.
2. Secretary of Defense
Who says you shouldn't aim high? I know
from firsthand experience that the Pentagon
is no fun unless you're one of the top dogs. I
study political science. I even know a bit
about weapons of mass destruction. That
makes me far more qualified than many Pen
tagon big wigs. I might as well start tomor
row. Advising the president on when, where
and how to decimate a third world country
the si/e of Delaware is exactly the kind of
power this girl needs. The job has some seri
ous perks. The Secretary of Defense (Sec
Del to insiders) travels all over the world to
meet with other defense officiate and is treat
ed to sumptuous meals and the best accom
modations at every stop. The Sec Def also
has the plushest office in the Pentagon. It's
quite possibly the job for me. If a nuclear war
breaks out, Daily readers will know who
recently took the reigns over at the Depart
ment of Defense.
3. Interpretive dancer for the Samples
Admitting this secret desire is really let
ting you know a bit too much. But since I've
already let the cat out of the bag, I might as
well explain. The Samples are a band out of
Colorado. Not just a band, but my favorite
band (even if some people think the lead
singer sounds whiny). Since the Samples are
not an itber-band selling millions of records,
they tour a lot to try and spread their music
to the masses. The audiences at these many
concerts always seem to be dancing. I figure
that it might be interesting, even beneficial,
to have a dancer on stage to inspire the col

lective groove. Who better to fill that posi
tion than me, a dedicated fan with modest
dancing abilities? Getting paid to attend
their every concert sounds good to me.
4. Singer (maybe with a band and probably
with backup)
The idea of watching myself in a video on
MTV is oddly appealing to me. I see the
video being black and white, very artsy, near
ly incomprehensible, but very deep. One
problem: I can't sing. I'm embarrassed to
hear myself in the shower. Another problem:
1 can't play a musical instrument. Well,
maybe the handbells, but that was way back
in eighth grade, and handbells really aren't
used by fl&ny major groups today. But
maybe if I sign with Bad Boy, Puff Daddy
can take care of these minor problems.
Knowing Puffy, he would create an incredi
ble remix, maybe a combination of Eazy E
and the Allman Brothers. I figure with Puffy
backing me, at minimum I go platinum. The
result, in the words of Puffy protege Lil' Kim:
money, power and respect. Maybe even ado
ration. Teen idol sounds nice, doesn't it?
So you might be thinking that these
prospective jobs don't sound altogether fea
sible for me. You're probably right. But
you're not going to keep a girl from dream
ing, are you? And hey, if all else fails, 1 can
always be original and work for a start-up or
try I-banking.

Erin Bouchier is a junior majoring in political
science. Her other aspirations include joining
the pro fessional surfing tour, dancing in a rap
video and becoming a member of the intelli
gentsia.
