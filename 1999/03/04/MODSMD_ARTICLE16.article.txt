Ad deserved to be heard
Concerning Selh Weisburst's response to
the "advertisement supplement" from the
Human Lite Alliance of Minnesota Educa
tion l ; und in yesterday's Daily, I find one
fatal flaw in his ideas. He writes that the
advertisement "is a right-wing organization
that is trying to 'brainwash' college students
into believing that the government should
control the bodies and ehoices of its female
citizens." Pure hogwash.
If an advertisement had been included
regarding the exact opposite opinion, letters
would pour into The Daily from a multitude
of conservative students, and if these stu
dents attacked "left-wing" militants, they
too would be wrong.
I myself am not right-wing; in fact 1 dis
like the Republican Party (but am not too
fond of the Democrats).
On almost all issues I find myself very

liberal, except for abortion.
I agree with everything that the adver
tisement had to say. I feel that the argument
"it's my choice, it's my body" is absolutely
ludicrous.
It is not your body, it is a two-month-old
fetus' body that can't help to make its own
choices. Abortion is not an option, but a
cop-out.
I will stop with my beliefs because I don't
want this letter to inflame any further an
already bitter debate.
I include my strong opinion to counter
Weisburst's idea that the advertisement is
"right-wing propaganda." 1 am far from
right-wing, but still share this supplement's
opinions.
Because that is all that it was. An opin
ion. It did not attack anyone, only provided
a counter argument for pro-choice cam
paigners.
Until these advertisements defame other
people, promote racism or sexism, attacks

or violence, I say let The Daily include what
it wants. >
After all. couldn't certain right-wingers
find Roxy Sass' opinions on sex to be
"brainwashing" our students into having sex
at all times?

Controlling nature wrong
I thought it was a fortunate coincidence
that your thoughtful editorial on "Designer
babies" appeared the day after the informa
tion from the Human Life Alliance was
included. Artificial creation of fertility and
engineering of offspring with "desirable"
traits is emblematic of the trend in this soci
ety to control, and even defy, nature.
This desire is also manifest in the unnat
ural termination of life that results from an

abortion.
Those opposed to abortion should also
call for society to share in the responsibility
for children born into difficult circum
stances.
Those who cannot themselves conceive a
child are presented with a wonderful oppor
tunity to celebrate nature through adoption
of an unwanted child. The money they
would spend t>n chemical engineering can
instead be used to rear this new life. In this
way people do not hopelessly fight against
their natural gifts but rather join together to
dignify them.
In an age where we are becoming more
and more aware of the deleterious effects
on the environment created by our defiance
of nature, we remain blind to the grave toll
this defiance is taking on our bodies and our
society.
