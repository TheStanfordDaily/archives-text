## The 						Last Crusade: Holy Holy and the Paper Lambs

Lauren Oster

My oldest impressions of
organized worship are fun-house
faees.
I haven't attended church with any reg
ularity beyond the age when I was nearly
too small to squirm through full services.
I have a distinct memory, in spite of
that, of the doors that led to the main sanc
tuary of my parents' church: they were
gigantic, carved of dark wood and barred
shut.
My vacation Bible school class was hus
tled past them each week to our children's
group, where we'd paste together paper
lambs and guide Jesus through mazes to
his disciples. I asked my teacher about the
sanctuary doors; she told me that if we
opened them, the Holy Spirit would slip
out and fly away.
I could credit that teacher, if I liked,
with laying the groundwork for my child
hood conception of a Slippery God.
My Christ was the special-effects
smoke of "Raiders of the Lost Ark;" the
Holy Spirit was something that burst out

of containers that really should have
stayed shut (and melted the faces of Nazis
with spectacles).
Something of that impression still
affected me when I designed my tatoo
three years ago; I left the parlor with a 4-
inch Gothic cross on my back.
It's attractive from a secular perspec
tive — the drawing was originally a flyer
from a fetish club in San Francisco —but I
was fixated upon the retention of my faith
when I chose it.
I reasoned that I'd be an improbable
Wiccan with a giant cross in my skin; that
sneaky Holy Spirit, whether I appreciated
it in 50 years or not, was not going to fly
away, damn it.
I was a Christmas-Easter Christian, for
a while. My dead-of-night walks to Memo
rial Church and whispered Lord's Prayers
at the doors — always the doors, white
knuckles on both knobs — tapered off.
I told my parents this Christmas Eve
that I wouldn't go to church with them
that night or ever again.

"I know better than that" — I read it in
a Kerouac novel — "God must be a per
sonal God, because I've known a lot of
things that weren't in texts." They drove
halfway to services and home again, to
make sure. I was sure.
The old rites were attractive again on
Sunday when I followed a friend to
Catholic Mass.
My company surprised the hell out of
him — it surprised the hell out of me —
but there I was, in the most pious combi
nation of black I could salvage from the
floor.
No crucifix (I don't have one) but I
brought the pretty cross on my back and
had a go.
Mass smells a lot. Maybe that was it. I
didn't know when to mumble, when to
sing. Maybe that was it. There was a drunk
man four pews back answering the priest
in a voice more audible than the sermon.
Maybe that was it.
I lasted half an hour in the pew and told
my friend that I would meet him outside. I

stumbled out of the sanctuary, out of the
doors, and the crowd moving forward to
receive communion looked for all the
world like the silent high priests in "Indi
ana Jones and the Temple of Doom."
1 clutched myself beyond the gates,
recited poems to keep from vomiting and
cried.
My God is a personal God. I know a lot
of things that aren't in texts. I don't
believe in Heaven or Hell, in Jesus Christ
or Satan, and I think it's safe to say that
I'm not a Christian any more.
Mass didn't threaten me; it was, simply,
too much sadness. I am attracted to the
permanence of beauty that the back-cross
has come to mean to me — not a thin man
bleeding, not a mist that 1 need to chase,
but a silent and sober joy.
Shelley offered in his "Defence of Poet
ry" that the poet, the artist, the remem
berer "redeems from decay the visitations
of the divinity in man."
He continues, "The persons in whom
this power resides, may often, as far as

regards many portions of their nature,
have little apparent correspondence with
the spirit of good of which they are the
ministers. But even whilst they deny and
abjure, they are yet compelled to serve,
the Power which is seated upon the throne
of their own soul." Loosen your grip,
please. Remember your hands.
No more doors, I think; no more flying
away.
Harrison Ford, Shelley, Jesus Christ
and I have reached an understanding, so tb
speak. Some will preach, others will shut
things — face-melting will be kept to a
minimum, if it can be helped. " >
Me, I'll record the joy gently. I'm still
glad I have the tattoo; I remember the
beauty of the closed doors, but I can he
divine wherever I like. !
