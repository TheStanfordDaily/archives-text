### Rebecca Rettig Editorial staff 
Last Saturday was Mike Mont
gomery's first Pacific 10 Conference
championship, hut what most of the
Cardinal sports fans don't know is
that the head coach of the No. 1
Stanford men's swimming team,
Skip Kenney, already has 17 under
his belt. And starting today, the Car
dinal will be going for the school's
18th swimming Pac-1() title.

MEN'S SWIMMING

â–  Today-Saturday: No. 1 Stanford
(11-0, 4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) at
the Pac-1() Conference Champi
onships in Long Beach at the Bel
mont Plaza Pool.
As the swimmers head into the
championship part of their season,
competing in Pac-lOs and then the
NCAA Championships later in
March, they have a lot to live up to.
Last year, Stanford took yet another
title among the "strongest swim
ming conference in the country," ac
cording to Kenney. and clinched the
NCAA Championship with the sec
ond-largest margin of victory ever.
"This is the exciting time of the
season," Kenneysaid. "It is standing
up for the history of Stanford swim
ming."
Stanford (11-0 overall, 4-0 Pac
10) goes into the conference facing
three top-10 teams: No.4 USC. No.6
Arizona and No. 7 California, which
Stanford swept. The Cardinal is
heads into Pac-lOs with a general
feeling of confidence, having not
lost any meets and having the ability
to pull out close meets. This makes
the team feel that it can continue the
Cardinal's 17-title winning streak,
the. most in Pac-10 history for any
sport.
Yet Kenney doesn't attribute the

Cardinal's past, and hopefully fu
ture success solely to the "supers
tars" of the team.
"I've always believed that to
have a successful team, the bottom
one-third of your team really deter
mines how good you can be," he
said.
What Kenney worked on for this
weekend's Pac-lOs was getting the
bottom one-third to feel as impor
tant as the superstars. He expects
those swimmers to step up and swim
faster than ever. The bottom one
third is fully tapered and shaved for
the March 4-6 competition in order
to clock quicker times.
The other swimmers have light
ened their workouts in the past few
weeks, cutting down on yardage,
stopping dry-land training altogeth
er. as well as eliminating weigh-lift
ing from their regimen. They too are
more rested than during the prime
of their dual-meet season, but are
not in the stage of conserving as
much energy as the other members
of the team for whom Pac-lOs might
be their last meet of the season.
But the goal for the Cardinal this
weekend is not only to win. but also
to get as many people qualified for
NCAAs as it possibly can. The limit
for the number of individuals quali
fying from one team is 18 and Ken
ney is looking for that number com
ing out of this weekend's meet.
" The general team feeling is one
of excitement," said junior co-cap
tain Glenn Counts. " There is more
hope of getting guys qualified that
haven't qualified before and putting
together some really great relays."
There are currently approxi
mately eight swimmers qualified for
Nationals, and with the rest that the
team has been getting, more swim
mers can make the time cuts. Last
