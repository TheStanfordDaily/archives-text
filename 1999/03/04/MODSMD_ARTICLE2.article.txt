# CUDDLERS
## Infants receive human contact from volunteers 
### Steve Kessler 
Every Tuesday afternoon,
Menlo Park resident Wendy
Kixmiller dons a pale blue uniform
and heads off to work in the inten
sive care nursery of the Lucille
Packard Children's Hospital. Once
there, she makes the rounds, deter
mining where her help is needed as
she checks up on the 60 or so infants

in the unit.
Kixmiller is part of an elite
squad: her job is one of the most se
lective and highly sought-after in
the hospital, but she isn't a doctor,
or even a nurse.
She is a volunteer "cuddler."
As a cuddler. her responsibilities
include a wide range of activities,
from holding and reading to the in
fants to feeding them and changing
their diapers. She is one of 73 active
cuddlers at the center; the waiting
list, which was recently closed to the
public, boasts more than 3(H) people
and the wait is a year long.
"Cuddlers lill a vital need for the
babies, supplying them with posi

tive social interaction," explains
Joan Forte. Patient Care Manager
of the hospital's Intermediate In
tensive Care Nursery and coordina
tor of the Cuddlers Program.
"Most families try to be here as
often as they can. but they usually
can't be here all the time. And our
nurses are often too busy with their
medical tasks to take a lot of time to
just play with the infants. So the
cuddlers play an important role."
explained Forte.
According to studies, hospital
ized infants that are touched have
better survival rates than those who

are left alone in their incubators. In
addition, they tend to gain weight
much faster and have shorter hospi
tal stays.
' 4 Because Packard is a state-of
tlje-art facility, however, it treats in
fants from all over northern Cali
fornia, as well as many from out of
shite. Forte estimates that half of
the children are local, while the
other half are from an hour or more
away. Parents of these children
often must work or spend signifi
cant amounts of time away from
tbeir child.
' Which is where the cuddlers
cpnie in.
"We're just here to help the par

ents," Kixmiller notes, as she play
fully waves a stuffed Tigger doll in
front of a jovial brown-eyed boy of
four or five months. His lips are
stained dark blue from medicine,
and a feeding tube extends into his
nose.
The boy's home is a couple hours
away, and his mother has recorded
a tape of herself reading Pinocchio
to play aloud to him. Kixmiller has
already played the tape, and she
says,"It really calmed him down a
lot, being able to listen to his moth
er's voice."
Volunteers are drawn to the cud
dler program from a variety of
fields, from computer programmer
to bartender. Most have no previ
ous experience in medicine, and all
are required to undergo extensive
training.

As part of their training, they are
warned not to get too emotionally
attached to the infants, who often
have fatal illnesses. Instead, they
are encouraged to focus on the pos
itive. Anytime a baby gets dis
charged is a victory of sorts for
everyone involved.
Volunteer Monica Sandrini said,
"Fortunately, I've never held a
baby that died. I'm always thrilled
when they go home; it means
they're going to a better place."
However, it is sometimes a diffi
cult situation when an infant is pre
sent one week during a volunteer's
shift but gone the next. Says
Kixmiller optimistically, "I don't
usually ask after them. I like to as
sume the best."
But all the endings are not
happy. As an example, Forte tells a

story about a volunteer who cared
for a baby with a heart condition
and who was expected to die.
Says Forte, "The man would tell
the baby stories about life outside
the hospital, because he knew the
baby would never have these expe
riences. He would pretend that they
were at the circus or at a parade,
and he would tell about what they
saw and heard and felt."
Despite her warnings to the vol
unteers not to maintain their emo
tional distance, she admits, "Every
time I walked by I felt like crying."
Due to the long waiting list.
Forte is not currently accepting ap
plications for new cuddlers. How
ever, a new program is being found
ed at San Jose's Good Samaritan
Hospital, and interested parties are
encouraged to apply.
