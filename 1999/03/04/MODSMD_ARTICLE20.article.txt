# Baseball forms new conference

Change comes to everything,
even everything good.
This life truth is what consoles
Pacific 10 Conference coaches like
Stanford's Mark Marquess and
USC's Mike Gillespie.
That's pretty much all they have
to console themselves with now
that the six teams from the Pac-10
Southern Division, possibly the
greatest college baseball league of
all time, have merged with three
teams from the old Pac-10 North
ern Division to make a new but
probably not improved version of
the conference.
The Six-Pac had flourished for
20 years. Players such as Barry

Bonds, Scott Erickson. Trevor
Hoffman, Randy Johnson, Jeff
Kent, Kenny Lofton, Jack Mc-
Dowell. Mark McGwire, Mike
Mussina and others passed through
the league, which produced six na
tional titles, including Stanford's in
1987 and 1988. Last year, the
league featured the consensus No.
1 team throughout the season,
Stanford, and the two teams in the
NCAA final, Arizona State and
national champion USC.
But because Portland State
dropped baseball after last season,
the dream league is gone. With
only three teams remaining in the
Nor-Pac, the Pac-10 was forced to
merge the two divisions into one
nine-team league.
While the new Pac-10 is bigger

than the Six-Pac, it is not necessar
ily better. Gone are the days of
playing two series a year against
every other team in the league; this
year only one three-game series
will count.
"1 think it's sad because I think
the Six-Pac was the toughest
league in baseball, regardless of
what the [Southeastern Confer
ence] or [the Atlantic Coast Con
ference) says," Marquess said. "It
was [the toughest] because you
played each other six times — 30
games [in all]. The best team won."
Teams from the old Nor-Pac,
which was less competitive and had
much less national success, are
more enthusiastic about the
change.
"Up here in the north, we're re

ally excited about the new format,"
said Washington head coach Ken
Knutson, whose team dominated
Nor-Pac play. "We really wanted it
to be a true Pac-10. We might have
snuck up on some people in the
past, but now we have to be good
every weekend. It's going to be a
great challenge."
Although No. 6 Stanford is
presently the highest-ranked Pac
-10 team, no one is handing the Car
dinal a free title.
USC was the preseason favorite
to repeat as national champions,
Washington beat Stanford the last
two years for the Pac-10 Champi
onship and UCLA is stocked with
young talent after bringing in the
nation's top recruiting classes the
last two years.
While it may not be as powerful
as the Six-Pac was, the Pac-10 will
still be the premier baseball confer
ence in the country. Here is a team
by-team breakdown of the newly
formed conference.
Arizona (15-6): Even though
the Wildcats have to replace seven
starters, its one returning starter is
no pushover.
Sophomore shortstop Keoni
Deßenne comes off a season in
which he earned freshman All-
America honors, batting .349 and
leading the team with 68 runs
scored. Deßenne also earned
some experience as the starting
second baseman for the U.S. na
tional team last summer. Thus far,
he is hitting .372 with two home
runs and 20 RBIs.
Arizona State (19-5): Head
coach Pat Murphy calls his eighth
ranked Sun Devils "nothing spe
cial." But being the only other
ranked team in the conference is
no small accomplishment, especial
ly with 26 new faces on the 40-man
roster.

Three new teams were added to the Pacific 10 Conference this year, making clinching the title this sea
son more difficult for Stanford.
