# Baseball forms new conference
##

Change comes to everything,
even everything good.
This life truth is what consoles
Pacific 10 Conference coaches like
Stanford's Mark Marquess and
USC's Mike Gillespie.
That's pretty much all they have
to console themselves with now
that the six teams from the Pac-10
Southern Division, possibly the
greatest college baseball league of
all time, have merged with three
teams from the old Pac-10 North
ern Division to make a new but
probably not improved version of
the conference.
The Six-Pac had flourished for
20 years. Players such as Barry

Bonds, Scott Erickson. Trevor
Hoffman, Randy Johnson, Jeff
Kent, Kenny Lofton, Jack Mc-
Dowell. Mark McGwire, Mike
Mussina and others passed through
the league, which produced six na
tional titles, including Stanford's in
1987 and 1988. Last year, the
league featured the consensus No.
1 team throughout the season,
Stanford, and the two teams in the
NCAA final, Arizona State and
national champion USC.
But because Portland State
dropped baseball after last season,
the dream league is gone. With
only three teams remaining in the
Nor-Pac, the Pac-10 was forced to
merge the two divisions into one
nine-team league.
While the new Pac-10 is bigger

than the Six-Pac, it is not necessar
ily better. Gone are the days of
playing two series a year against
every other team in the league; this
year only one three-game series
will count.
"1 think it's sad because I think
the Six-Pac was the toughest
league in baseball, regardless of
what the [Southeastern Confer
ence] or [the Atlantic Coast Con
ference) says," Marquess said. "It
was [the toughest] because you
played each other six times — 30
games [in all]. The best team won."
Teams from the old Nor-Pac,
which was less competitive and had
much less national success, are
more enthusiastic about the
change.
"Up here in the north, we're re

ally excited about the new format,"
said Washington head coach Ken
Knutson, whose team dominated
Nor-Pac play. "We really wanted it
to be a true Pac-10. We might have
snuck up on some people in the
past, but now we have to be good
every weekend. It's going to be a
great challenge."
Although No. 6 Stanford is
presently the highest-ranked Pac
-10 team, no one is handing the Car
dinal a free title.
USC was the preseason favorite
to repeat as national champions,
Washington beat Stanford the last
two years for the Pac-10 Champi
onship and UCLA is stocked with
young talent after bringing in the
nation's top recruiting classes the
last two years.
While it may not be as powerful
as the Six-Pac was, the Pac-10 will
still be the premier baseball confer
ence in the country. Here is a team
by-team breakdown of the newly
formed conference.
Arizona (15-6): Even though
the Wildcats have to replace seven
starters, its one returning starter is
no pushover.
Sophomore shortstop Keoni
Deßenne comes off a season in
which he earned freshman All-
America honors, batting .349 and
leading the team with 68 runs
scored. Deßenne also earned
some experience as the starting
second baseman for the U.S. na
tional team last summer. Thus far,
he is hitting .372 with two home
runs and 20 RBIs.
Arizona State (19-5): Head
coach Pat Murphy calls his eighth
ranked Sun Devils "nothing spe
cial." But being the only other
ranked team in the conference is
no small accomplishment, especial
ly with 26 new faces on the 40-man
roster.


Josh Haner — Daily file
Three new teams were added to the Pacific 10 Conference this year, making clinching the title this sea
son more difficult for Stanford.
Junior Willie Bloomquist has
moved to shortstop after seeing ac
tion at second base and in left field.
Last season, the first-team All-
American led the Six-Pac in seven
offensive categories, including bat
ting average and stolen bases. This
season, he is hitting .417 with 16
stolen bases.
Emerging recently has been ju
nior second baseman Mark Ern
ster,who has a .478 batting average.
In a three-game sweep of Brigham
Young two weeks ago. Ernster
went 11 for 15 and was the first
ASU player to go 6 for 6 in a game
since Hubie Brooks did it in 1975.
California (6-12): Cal's baseball
season got off to a very difficult
start as team head coach Bob Mi
lano underwent triple-bypass
surgery Jan. 26, the day of Cal 's sea
son opener. Interim coach David
Lawn has seen the Bears struggle,
losing six of their last seven games,
including two out of three to Stan
ford in a non-conference series.
Cal's stumbling start has not
slowed down sophomore third
baseman Xavier Nady, however.
The National Freshman of the
Year last season. Nady is hitting at
a .361 clip to go with 11 home runs,
three of those in a loss to UCLA
last Friday.
Oregon State (7-8): The big
news surrounding the baseball pro
gram here is the addition of a $2-
million permanent grandstand to
Coleman Field, a field that the
Beavers have called home since
1907.
Baseball fever in Corvallis, ()re.:
Catch it!
The early returns have been tie
cent, especially the pitching. Junior
right-hander lIR. Cook pitched a
complete-game, 1-0 victory over
then-No. 13 Oklahoma State. He
allowed only one hit and one walk,
retiring the first 14 batters and the
final 10 batters he faced.
UCLA (11-12): The Bruins, who
qualified for the 1997 College
World Series, look to make a return
trip after stumbling to a 24-33
record with a very young team last
season. As expected, UCLA has
been hitting the ball hard, only to
be brought down by its pitching.
In a three-game sweep of Cal
last weekend, UCLA racked up 29
runs on 37 hits, including live home
runs. Leading the recent offensive
surge is sophomore left fielder Bill

Scott, who is on a 10-game hitting
streak. In those games, Scott has hit
.444 witli four home runs and 22
RBl's.
use (5-11): Ihe Trojans were
far and away the heavy favorite to
win the Pac-l()and maybe even re
peat as national champions. But
after starting as the No. 1 team in
the country, they have fallen out of
the rankings.
IJSC has gone winless on the
road, including a three-game sweep
at Texas. Ihe Trojans have also
gone 2-8 in games decided by two
runs or less.
Still, the team boasts a consider
able amount of offensive firepow
er. junior catcher Eric Munson,
Baseball America's preseason
Player of the Year, is hitting .417
with eight home runs and 25 RBl's.
"Ihe cream has been rising to
the top slowly and we need it to
move quickly." Gillespie said. "If
not, it's going to be a disastrous and
humiliating season."
Washington (7-4): As if the de
fending Pac-10 champion did not
have enough to deal with merging
with the more competitive Six Pac,
it has also had to deal with l ) 2 con
secutive days of rain and snow in
the Seattle area.
Anticipating the adverse weath
er situation. Washington has
played its first II games on the
road. It will finally open ;\t home to
morrow night against Gon/aga
weather permitting, of course.
"1 like our team a lot." Knutson
said. "We have the ability to be a
good team. We're only really play
ing one new starter, so it's not like
we're running out a big new team."
Perhaps the most attractive fea
ture of the Huskies, and one that
will keep them in contention this
season, is their experienced pitch
ing. Junior right-hander Jeff
Heaverlo, a Palo Alto native, an
chors a deep staff that returns all
four of its starters. I le has gone 2-0
with a 2.95 ERA this season and
will probably challenge Stanford
sophomore right-hander Jason
Young for conference pitcher of
the year honors.
Washington State (N-2): Hopes
are high in the Palouse as the
Cougars hope to complete a three
year turnaround from 13-42 laugh
ingstock in 1997 to a postseason
team this season. Washington
State, which has not made it to an
NCAA regional since 1990, went
25-24 last season with a team that
returns its entire pitching staff this
year.
