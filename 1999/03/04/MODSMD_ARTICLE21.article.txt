# Lacrosse gains from Alexis Patrizio's life experience
## 
### Brian Eule Senior staff writer 
She looks directly at her coach,
studying as the lips move in a
rapid manner, understanding more
than most of her teammates ever
will. They are all huddled together,
listening intently to the words that
motivate them to push harder and
harder each day they take the field,
yet for her. Yet there is only silence.
The rain has forced the hearing
aids out of her ears and into the bag
that rests on the sidelines. Witli

those little pieces of magic away
from her ears, the world has turned
90percent quiet. Hand signals, wav
ing arms and moving lips define the
game, yet she has little problem
The crowd has disappeared, the
screaming opponents have been si
lenced. but the game is as intense as
ever.
The fourth Thanksgiving of
young Alexis' life had come and
gone in the Patrizio's Philadelphia
household much like the ones that
came before it but vastly different
from those that would follow.

One day was spent focusing on
all that is to be thankful for, the next
day was spent mourning what was
no longer there.
It's her first memory.
Alexis Patrizio woke up that
morning with tears streaming down
her face. She crawled out of bed and
ran to her parents' room crying, in
silence. She couldn't hear her own
feet sprinting down the hall. She
couldn't hear the familiar creaks of
her very own house.
"They put me in the hospital for
10 days right after that," she said.

"They were trying to figure out what
was wrong and why it happened.
They never really came to a conclu
sive answer."
An airborne virus was the best
guess they could give.
.lust slightly west of Philadelphia,
where the Pennsylvania and
Delaware borders meet, eight-year
old Heidi Connor was growing up in
a town called Newtown Square. It
was only a matter of time until the
athletic Connor would be playing
lacrosse at Villanova, earning MVP
honors, being named captain and
winning letters for all four of her col
legiate years.
Hut it wasn't until several years
after Connor graduated from Vil
lanova and left the Philadelphia
area for Northern California that
she would meet Patri/io.
Patrizio had spent her high
school years playing tennis, basket
ball and lacrosse, her least favorite
among the three. Hut after 12 years
at the same private school where
everyone knew her, and everyone
knew that if she didn't respond
when they called her name it did not
mean she was ignoring them, Pa
tri/io ventured out to the West
Coast to attend Stanford. And she
wasn't about to let her hearing loss
define who she was as she met the
friends whom she would share the
next four years of her life with.
"I 've really tried not to make my
hearing an issue," Patri/io said.
"Obviously it's part of who 1 am. but
it doesn't change how I approach
things."
It did, however, change how
Connor approached things.
As Patrizio began her second
year of playing lacrosse at Stanford,
something she had never intended
to do in the first place, Connor
joined the Cardinal coaching staff.
One year later, she was promoted to
head coach with Patri/io as her cap
tain.
"As a coach, I have been
blessed," Connor said. "Coaches

are blessed because we see the best
— the best attitudes, the best minds,
the best athletes. But in Alexis, I
have had the chance to coach some
one better than the rest.
"To play a sport is unique, but to
play a sport without being able to
hear the referee's whistles, the plays
being called, the opposing player
closing in from behind or the cheers
of your teammates when you make
a great play — this is what is amaz
ing to me."

To play a sport is unique,
but to play a sport without
being able to hear the ref
eree's whistles, the plays
being called, the opposing
player closing in from behind
or the cheers or your team
mates when you make a
great play—this is what is
amazing to me.
— Heidi Connor

So Connor changed her coaching
style. For every play, there was now
a hand signal, not just a number.
Every time she addressed the team,
she would make sure she was direct
ly facing Patri/io. And she would al
ways be aware of where the sun was,
constantly attempting to prevent
any shadows from reaching her face.
In the meantime. Patrizio contin
ued to shine. What started with a
freshman hesitant to even join the
team turned into a journey that has
wound up with Patrizio finding her
self second on Stanford's all-time
scorers' list and entering her third
season as the team's captain.
"It's been a bumpy ride," Pa
trizio said. "My freshman year, we
had nine freshmen. Then, at the end

of that year, a bunch of people quit
— almost the whole team. At the
end of my freshman year, I was the
only one who said I was definitely
coming back."
One year later, Connor was
added to the coaching staff. A year
after that, she was named head
coach.
"I first met Heidi when 1 was a
sophomore," Patrizio said. "She
grew up right near where I grew up.
She's a very precise, organized
coach, which our head coach at the
time wasn't. She brought a certain
level of professionalism to the team.
The whole team [immediately] re
spected her. They knew Heidi could
play as well as coach. In practice, she
would be the one out there demon
strating."
After a season in which Patrizio
was third on the team in shooting
percentage, nailing 53.85 percent of
her shots, the three-time captain
now finds herself in her senior and
final season, still learning from Con
nor.
Yet it is Connor who is constant
ly learning from Patrizio.
"I'm trying to address the styles
of players individually," Connor
said. Working with Alexis has
"taught me to do that with each
player. No player likes to be
screamed at from across the field.
You learn to pick and choose your
moments when to instruct.
"It's pretty unbelievable," she
added. "You'd think someone
would rely on their handicap and
use it as a crutch. You never hear
her place the blame on it. Looking at
Alexis as a player just teaches you
what you can overcome."
But Patrizio feels she is not over
coming anything at all.
"I think it has made me much
more aware of people's positions on
the field," she said. "I think I have a
good sense of where everybody is
and what's going on. I never feel out
of the loop."
That's because she never is.

but to play a sport without
being able to hear the ref
eree's whistles, the plays
being called, the opposing
player closing in from behind
or the cheers or your team
mates when you make a
great play—this is what is
amazing to me.
— Heidi Connor

So Connor changed her coaching
style. For every play, there was now
a hand signal, not just a number.
Every time she addressed the team,
she would make sure she was direct
ly facing Patri/io. And she would al
ways be aware of where the sun was,
constantly attempting to prevent
any shadows from reaching her face.
In the meantime. Patrizio contin
ued to shine. What started with a
freshman hesitant to even join the
team turned into a journey that has
wound up with Patrizio finding her
self second on Stanford's all-time
scorers' list and entering her third
season as the team's captain.
"It's been a bumpy ride," Pa
trizio said. "My freshman year, we
had nine freshmen. Then, at the end

of that year, a bunch of people quit
— almost the whole team. At the
end of my freshman year, I was the
only one who said I was definitely
coming back."
One year later, Connor was
added to the coaching staff. A year
after that, she was named head
coach.
"I first met Heidi when 1 was a
sophomore," Patrizio said. "She
grew up right near where I grew up.
She's a very precise, organized
coach, which our head coach at the
time wasn't. She brought a certain
level of professionalism to the team.
The whole team [immediately] re
spected her. They knew Heidi could
play as well as coach. In practice, she
would be the one out there demon
strating."
After a season in which Patrizio
was third on the team in shooting
percentage, nailing 53.85 percent of
her shots, the three-time captain
now finds herself in her senior and
final season, still learning from Con
nor.
Yet it is Connor who is constant
ly learning from Patrizio.
"I'm trying to address the styles
of players individually," Connor
said. Working with Alexis has
"taught me to do that with each
player. No player likes to be
screamed at from across the field.
You learn to pick and choose your
moments when to instruct.
"It's pretty unbelievable," she
added. "You'd think someone
would rely on their handicap and
use it as a crutch. You never hear
her place the blame on it. Looking at
Alexis as a player just teaches you
what you can overcome."
But Patrizio feels she is not over
coming anything at all.
"I think it has made me much
more aware of people's positions on
the field," she said. "I think I have a
good sense of where everybody is
and what's going on. I never feel out
of the loop."
That's because she never is.
