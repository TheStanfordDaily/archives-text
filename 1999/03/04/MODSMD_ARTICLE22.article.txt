"Lifts are the riskiest part of our
routine," said Enos, a two-time
Ail-American. "If one thing goes
wrong, the stunt fails. It's really
nerve-wracking, but definitely the
most exciting thing to watch."
"Saturday's meet will he a great
opportunity to swim in front of
friends and family." Freiheit said.
"People are always asking us when
we'll be competing at home, so this
is their one chance to come out and
support the team. We're really ex
cited to be performing before a
home crowd."
Figure competition is closed to
the public. Routine competition
begins at I p.m. Doors open at
