## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
Traditionally, they're two of the
powerhouses of collegiate women's
water polo. They're currently vying
for the No. 2 spot in the national
rankings. The rivalry is, of course,
legendary — and it continues this
weekend.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO

■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (9-2, 2-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
at No. 2 California (9-2,1-0).
On Saturday, the Stanford
women's water polo team (9-2, 2-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) takes on the California Gold
en Bears in Berkeley in what
promises to he another intense
face-off.
"1 think we're going to find out a
lot about ourselves by how we han
dle this [game]," said Stanford head
coach John Tanner.
After meeting each other twice
in tournament play this season —
both times in semifinal matches —
the squads are each 1-1 in head-to
head competition. Cal landed the
first blow, defeating the Cardinal at
the UC-San Diego Invitational
tournament in a 6-3 decision that
gave the Bears a birth in the cham
pionship match.
But Stanford evened the score
last weekend.
In the semifinal round of the
UC-Santa Barbara Tournament.
Stanford came back from a 3-1 half
time deficit to score three goals in
the third quarter and one in the
fourth for the 5-3 victory.
According to Tanner, it was
Stanford's defense that clinched
the win. In spite of Cal's typically
aggressive counterattack, the Bears
were unable to overcome Stan
ford's tight defensive play at
UCSB.
"Cal has strong people at every
position," Tanner said. "They have

good shooting and a balanced at
tack. I think we won the game
mainly because of good 5-on-6 de
fense." «•
Another key factor in Staf
ford's win was the fact that the Car
dinal defense was also able to shfdt
down Cal's Colette Glinkowski,
who scored five of her team's six
goals in its win over Stanford at
UCSD.
However, Cal's attack will still
pose a strong threat this weekend.
And an added obstacle for the Car
dinal is the Bears' solid defense.
"Cal is a really good team on de
fense," Fanner said. "They're
strong in the goal and they have
several good two-meter defenders.
They're also very mobile and
strong and they're very big
throughout their lineup."
But Stanford has proven that it
has the skill to overcome Cal's
strengths and capitalize on frs
weaknesses. After two matchup,
the Cardinal knows what to exptitt
from its rival. And the squad knows
what it has to do to win. *£
"We need to focus on what
do," Tanner said. "We're working
to get more mobility on offense, im
prove our counterattack and be
ficient inour6-on-5 opportunities,"
In addition, the Cardinal will
have to deal with the traditionary
high-spirited enthusiasm of the Oil
fans.
"One thing we're going to nee*l
is composure," Tanner saii£
"They're expecting a full capacity
[SOU-I.(MM) fans]. And the fact th;o
we beat them last weekend wit)
make them even more energetic."
But the Cardinal will have it«
own support in the stands as wofl.
Many dedicated Stanford fans will
be making the trek to Berkeley tor
the 10 a.m. game in order to sup
port the Cardinal women as thJsf
attempt to improve their MPsf
record to 3-0. Vj
"We're expecting a good crowd
turnout for both sides, so it should
be a great atmosphere."
