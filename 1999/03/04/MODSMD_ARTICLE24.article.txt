# Lacrosse rides Broncos off the field
## 
### Jeff Cooper Editorial staff 
On paper, the Stanford women's
lacrosse team looked ripe for a let
down in yesterday's matchup against
Santa Clara. Coming off a big win
Feb. 27 against UC-Davis and facing
three games in five days, the prospect
of a midweek stumble lay ominously
over the game.
But they don't play the games on
paper.
The Cardinal women (2-1)
dodged the letdown bullet and then
some yesterday afternoon as they
steamrolled the Broncos (0-3) 18-3.
Santa Clara, a club team faltering in
its early season, was outclassed at
both ends of the field by the defend
ing Western Women's Lacrosse
League champion Stanford team.
Strong freshman play sparked a
flurry of early Cardinal scores; Stan
ford led 15-0 at halftime. For the first
time this season, though, the team

appeared less a youthful challenger
and more a veteran-led champion.
That point was driven home with
only a few minutes remaining in the
second half. With 3 minutes, 45 sec
onds left to play, the Broncos had
reeled off three unanswered points
in an attempt to salvage some pride
from a disastrous loss.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ Yesterday: Stanford (2-1) 18,
Santa Clara (0-3) 3.

With a quick shovel pass from
sophomore Kate Reilly, however,
senior captain Carey Jones brought
the Cardinal's intensity back up a
notch. Jones dumped Reilly's pass
under the stick of Santa Clara senior
goalie Veronica Villalobos for Stan
ford's first score of the half with 3:41
left.
With the score 16-3, though,
Jones was far from done. The Stan
ford offense pressed the attack, and

after drawing a penalty with 2:24 left,
Jones drilled the ensuing shot to in
crease Stanford's lead to 17-3.
On the next Stanford possession,
Jones again took control, faking her
defender off and driving to the goal.
Her shot was saved, but she drew an
other penalty, and her goal with 1:26
left, to finish the scoring at 18-3.
seemed almost inevitable.
Though the offense, under Jones'
and senior co-captain Alexis Pa
trizio's leadership, has made quan
tum leaps in fluidity and comfort in
every game of the season, the Cardi
nal defense has also come together to
quietly form one of the toughest
squads in the league.
Senior goalie Stephanie Tuerk
leads the tenacious defenders from
between the pipes.
"We came out and really tried to
show how far we've improved," said
Tuerk. "We didn't play down to their
level, but played up to the level we
knew we could play at."

"I think we came away not only
with a win but a learning experi
ence," she added.

The difference in experience and:
