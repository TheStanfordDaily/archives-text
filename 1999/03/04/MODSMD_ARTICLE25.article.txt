## Australian scientist speaks on origins of life 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
Staring up into the stars, kids with telescopes
wonder to themselves silently, "what's out there?"
( aptivated by the sheer mystery of it all, people
have debated lor centuries over the origin of the
universe, the source of life and the length of time
life has existed.
Australian scientist Paul Davies attempted to
address these questions last night in the 19th annu
al Bunyan Lecture to a crowd of more than 3(X) in
I'erman Auditorium.
• Each year, the Program in Astronomy invites a
distinguished scientist to give a lecture on a topic
relating to the "Evolution of the Universe and Des
tiny of Man."
Davies, a mathematical physicist, lectured in
part to promote his new book, "The Fifth Miracle,"
which concerns the origin of life and the possibility
of life on Mars.
. "Why do we care about the origin of life?" he
asked. "We want to know whether or not we are
one of the freaks in a universe which is indifferent
to our existence, whether the universe has some
deep and ingenious natural order, and if our origin
is something deeply embedded in the scheme of
things."
Davies pointed to the 1K59 findings of ( harles
I )arwin in " The ()rigin ol Species" that life began
out of very simple microbes and eventually became
more diverse.
■ "Darwin left out of his account the question of
how life got started in the first place," he said.
• In order to discover this, Davies said, there are
three questions to be asked: when, where and how.
Addressing the problem of when. Davies spoke
6l the classic tendency of looking to fossils to dis
cover the origin of life. Fossils have suggested, he

said, that there is "a hint of life possibly back as far
as 3.9 billion years."
This life, he said, could have evolved with the
help of comets.
"Just after the Earth formed, it seems quite like
ly it was struck by a terrible force the size of Mars,"
he said. "If this is correct, it would have melted
Earth and made it unsuitable for living. The ques
tion then is how did Earth become capable of sus
taining life?"
The possible answer has been found in the re
cent "series of surprises of microbes living in ex
treme conditions," including rock, extremely hot
areas and far in the depths of the ocean, Davies
said.
"There exists now no serious doubt that the
ground we're standing on is rock underneath which
it is teeming with tiny microbes," he said.
Thus, he said, "maybe life didn't start as Darwin
suggested, but started deep underground."
This theory brings up a much debated question.
"If this could happen on Earth, could it happen
on other planets too?" Davies asked.
Following this thought, Davies spoke of past
studies to determine whether or not life exists on
Mars. Much of the general conclusion, he said, is
that the "entire planet is dead."
However, due to strong evidence that water
once flowed on Mars, Davies said that it is possible
life did once exist.
Davies said several conclusions can be made of
a number of possible scenarios.
"It could be that life began on Earth and spread
to Mars," he said. "It could be that life began on
Mars and came to Earth. Or, life could have sepa
rately arisen on Mars and Earth. Life could have
also begun somewhere else and colonized both
Earth and Mars."
T his last possibility is a bit hard to swallow,
Davies acknowledged.

"I don't believe life began in comets," he said.
"Nor do I believe that this mechanism I've been
speaking of can get you from one star system to an
other. It still doesn't tell us how life began some
where else."
The answer to that question, Davies said, is yet
to be found.
"We don't know how life originated," he said.
"We can but seek the heavens to find out. But even
a single independently originated Martian microbe
would transform our world view more than ( oper
nicus. Einstein and Darwin put together."
