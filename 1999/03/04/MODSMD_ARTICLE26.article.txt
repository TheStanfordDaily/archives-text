Colleagues and friends gathered
at a memorial service on Tuesday
for Amy Ewing, Class of '94. and re
membered her commitment to ser
vice and contributions to Stanford.
Ewing died on Feb. 23 at the age
of 27 after stepping in front of a Cal
train south of Ravenswood Avenue
in Menlo Park. The San Mateo
County Coroner ruled her death a
suicide. Her ashes will be scattered
on a hill that overlooks the campus
and the Bay.
Ewing was employed at the Stan
ford Center for Professional Devel
opment for eight years, working
most recently as a Web and infor
mation coordinator. Beginning as
an undergraduate, Ewing become a
full employee of the SCPD after
graduating with a bachelor's degree
in psychology in June 1994.
Imelda Oropeza, Marketing
Communication Manager for
SCPD. had known Ewing since she
was an undergraduate.
Ewing grew up in Bellevue,
Wash., and graduated from Sam
mamish High School. As an under
graduate here at Stanford, she was a
member of the track and cross
country teams and was involved in
speech and debate groups.
In Palo Alto, she worked at Pro
ject Read, a nonprofit organization
aimed at improving adult literacy.
Ewing also took part in the Big

Brothers / Big Sisters program.
According to Oropeza, Ewing
kept in touch with her "little sister"
for years after the program ended.
"No matter how busy she was," said
Oropeza, "she always made time for
other people."
As an undergraduate, Ewing
worked for the Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network, which
broadcasts lectures to corporate
sites off campus. In 1993, she won
the SITN Spirit Award for the most
exemplary employee.
Mike Rouan, the Stanford On
line Manager for SCPD, called
Ewing "one of my best operators"
and said that she was "extremely
positive and a great employee."
Ewing also wrote a column for
the "SITN Sagaciousness," a
newsletter for student operators.
"Amy's Corner" featured poems,
short stories and haikus.
In 1996, when Oropeza took a
two-month leave of absence, Ewing
was given the responsibility to over
see the publication of the School of
Engineering's annual report.
"She stepped in and did a stellar
job," said Oropeza. For her work,
Ewing received the Dean's Service
Award from the School of Engi
neering. To Oropeza, this effort was
typical of Ewing, who "took lots of
initiative and was always indepen
dent."
"I am just lucky to have spent all
those years with her," said Rouan.
