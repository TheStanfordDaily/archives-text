# Investing policy criticized
## Speakers call for avoiding companies that add to the greenhouse effect 
### Shane Shelley 
Students met last night with the national nonprofit en
vironmental organization Ozone Action to discuss what
they called "irresponsible Stanford investment policies."
The primary focus of the meeting was Stanford's involve
ment with companies contributing to global warming.
Guest speaker Randy Schutt. Class of 77, set the tone
for the meeting, relating to the group his experiences with
protesting against apartheid in the Schutt de
scribed door-to-door petitioning and fighting the Stan
ford Board of Trustees in attempts to end investment in
companies that did business in South Africa. He even
mentioned a sit-in at Old Union.
In regard to the meeting's goal of divestment and glob
al warming awareness, Schutt said. "You can do the
same."
Stephen Schneider, a professor at the Institute for In

ternational Studies, outlined problems with global warm
ing and the Global Climate Coalition, a conglomerate of
companies determined to plav down the potential detri
mental effects of global warming.
Although Schneider admitted one cannot be sure
about the effects of global warming, for him, the possibil
ity of the projected effects alone warrants attention.
Schneider said that there is a "nontrivial chance of cat
astrophic change," which should be enough to instigate
global changes in environmental policies. In reply to a
study done by the GCC that stated otherwise, Schneider
stated, "It was utter scientific garbage."
Leila Salazar of Ozone Action said that the organiza
tion's main goal was "to raise student awareness of Stan
ford investments, particularly those concerning the GCC
and global warming."
However, some students believe that Stanford is irre
sponsible in their investments dealing with companies
known to be involved in not only environmental issues,
but also human rights abuses. Students for Environmen
tal Action at Stanford volunteer Tim Donaghy, a senior,
noted that Stanford did not even participate in share
holder meetings, where it might have the opportunity to
voice its opinion on issues such as global warming.
