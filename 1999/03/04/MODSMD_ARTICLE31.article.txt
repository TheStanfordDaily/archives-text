# Pacific 10 basketball champs look to pull through for two more in Oregon this weekend
## Winning, confident Card ready to fly by Ducks 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Last Saturday's gallant postgame
ceremonies at Maples Pavilion,
which celebrated Stanford's first
ever Pacific 10 C onference champi
onship. were the perfect conclusion
to the regular season.
The only problem? There are still
two games left on the Cardinal's
schedule before the postseason.
While the rest of the men's college
basketball world is focused on sea
son-ending conference tournaments,
Stanford will head north to take on
the Oregon schools in its final two
regular-season contests. Even
though the Cardinal accomplished a
major goal last weekend by capturing
the Pac-10crown,a loss this weekend
would almost erase the wonderful
memories of celebration and relief
and replace them with ideas of regret
and doubt.
The last thing Stanford can afford
to do at this point of the season is
place any more doubts in the minds
of the NCAA Tournament seeding
committee. Granted, we are talking
about the difference between a No. I
seed and a 3 seed at the lowest. Hut
Stanford has deserved — even
begged — to be considered at this
highest level, so the difference be
tween those two seeds is a worth
while discussion.
As it stands right now. the consen
sus belief is that the ("ardinal is a lock
to stay in the West Region, probably

as a No. 2 seed, with Auburn the 1.
A major player in this decision,
and every other nail-biting edict of
the omnipotent seeding committee,
is the Ratings Percentage Index. The
RPI is a system that calculates a
team's strength in relation to the rest
of the country. An RPI considers
three fundamental things: 1. The
strength of a team's schedule; 2. How
it has done in those crucial games
against highly-ranked opponents; 3.
How its opponents fare in other
games against such top-notch teams.

MEN'S BASTKETBALL
■ Today: No. 6 Stanford (24-5, 14-2
Pacific 10 Conference) at Oregon
(15-10,7-9).

Stanford has the third-best RPI in
the nation. Duke is No. I with Michi
gan State No. 2. Auburn, the team
that is projected hv most to be the 1
seed in the West, is just No. 6 in the
RPI,and has not beaten a single team
with a top-20 index.
The Tigers will compete in the
SEC" tournament this weekend, and
will have to go through the likes of
Kentucky, a hot Tennessee squad
and an Arkansas team that is red-hot
heading into the postseason and
handed the Tigers one of their two
losses just a couple weeks ago.
Which is exactly why Stanford
could be sitting pretty — assuming it
picks up a pair of wins in Oregon.
And that is one heck of an as
sumption. considering the fact the

Oregon is sitting at fifth place in the
Pac-10, starving for a weekend sweep
and a prayer at the tournament. The
Ducks will try to knock out the
heavyweight Cardinal at Mac Arthur
Court, one of the most imposing are
nas in all of the conference.
Oregon State, meanwhile, is just
one spot out of the Pac-10 cellar, but
will welcome Stanford to Gill ( olise
um. where the Beavers are 11-1 on
the season.
It will be Senior Night at OSIJ
and from last weekend, the Cardinal
knows all too well what such emotion
can do to a basketball game.
Stanford put down the flowers
from the senior ceremony and
stormed out to a 15-point lead against
Arizona behind senior Kris Weems'
deadly three-point shooting. Class
mate Arthur Lee found his shooting
touch and went off for a career-high
29 points, earning Pac-10 Player of
the Week 1 lonors.
But if Stanford can weather the
storm inside Mac Court, negate an
emotional fireworks show by the
Beavers and come away with a pair of
wins in ()regon, it could be in a great
position to steal a No. I seed in the
West.
"I am glad we got [the Pac-10 title]
over with before we headed up to
Oregon," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "It would not
have been good to head up there hav
ing to win to pull this thing off. I think
it will be nice to play without some of
that pressure."
