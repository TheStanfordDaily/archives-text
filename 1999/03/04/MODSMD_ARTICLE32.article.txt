"We're not accepting this. We're going to come back and
next time take it hard at them."
Those were the words of freshman guard Lindsey Ya
masaki after the Cardinal (16-11. 12-4 Pacific 10 Conference)
lost to the Ducks (23-4.14-2) in early January at Eugene. The
question is whether a Stanford team that has let two of its last
four slip away, including a 12-point loss to Washington at
Maples, regroup to face an Oregon team that is on the verge
of winning its first ever Pac-10 title.
There are no certainties with this young team, and this
season has been a study in inconsistency. Early on. the Car
dinal beat No. 1 Purdue only to fall three games later to an
unranked Santa Clara team. Recently, the Cardinal upset
then-No. 12 UCLA only to lose to Washington two games
later.
"I think we've only lost to good teams, but we've also beat
en good teams, so that's what is frustrating," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "A lot of time basketball
comes down to the details, and we've got to do a better job of
taking care of the little things. That's what being consistent is.
paying attention to detail."
Oregon's defense has been smothering this year, leading
all Pac-10 teams with a scoring defense of 57.6 points. When
the teams met earlier this year, the Ducks allowed the ( ardi
nal only 59 points, its second-lowest offensive output of the
season.
"It's a matter of going that much harder all the time," Ya
masaki said. "I think it's a matter of us wanting to go mental
ly full speed all the time. This is definitely a team we'll have
to do that against."
Against an Oregon team that is as deep as any in the Pac

10. Stanford will need solid games From all its starters and
bench players, especially from 6-foot-6 center Carolyn Moos,
who will he facing off against Jenny Mowe, the only center in
the Pac-1() who is close to Moos's height at 6-5.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Today: Stanford (16-11. 12-4 Pacific 10 Conference) v. No. 15
Oregon (23-4, 14-2).

"I've never seen a more balanced team, they play really 10
people," VanDerveer said. "They don't really have anyone in
double figures as much as so many people at eight or nine
points a game."
Moos is second in scoring on the team behind Yamasaki
and her inside play will be critical against a Duck team that is
known for its physical abuse in the post. Although Moos was
held to under 10 points for only the fourth time this season at
Arizona last weekend, she has three double-doubles in the
last six games and is second in the Pac-10 with just under two
blocks a game. This season has seen her perfect the jump
hook, and it it falls for her. the Ducks will have a hard time
stopping it.
"We need Carolyn to be a go-to player, scoring inside and
outside for us. really running the floor well," VanDerveer
said. "She's going to have to work really hard defensively.
Their post players are very physical, and we're going to need
our post players really battling."
The Cardinal will also have to find a way to stop forwards
Angelina Wolvert and Brianne Meharry. Against Oregon
State, Wolvert scored 19 points and grabbed 13 boards while
Meharry leads the Ducks with 10 points per game.
With forward Sarah Dimson back in the starting lineup„
the Cardinal's defense has been beefed up. and all of it will be
needed to keep the Ducks from waddling over the Cardinal.
