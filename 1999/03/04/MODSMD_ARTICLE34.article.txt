## RATTLE OF THE BANDS!! Phi Kappa Psi take Toyon by storm! 
### 
s —Saturday, six bands will compete in Toyon Hall
V in Phi Kappa Psi's ninth annual Battle of the
Bands. At stake is the title for best band on
campus. Battle of the Bands is put on by Phi Psi, an
unhoused fraternity of 21 active members. In recent
years, this has been the biggest all-campus event that Phi
Psi puts on during winter quarter.
"Toyon is a great place to play, with maybe the most
personality of any large space at Stanford, but a very
echo-y sound. Battle [of the Bands] always brings out
the best in all the bands, and it is great to see so much
talent in one place. It's always a superb night of music,"
explained Danny Morrow, guitarist of too Much neon,
one of the competing bands.
This year the first place winner will get to play at The
Edge, while the runners up will receive gift certificates
from the event's sponsors and small sums of cash.
However, the bands who generally play at the Battle are
more interested in the publicity they will get than any
prizes they might win.
Some info about the six bands that will play Battle
this year:

Elemental is a new hip-hop / funk band. The band
members have only been playing together for a few
months, but they've already developed a style of their
own. While music is rooted in the hip-hop
tradition, the six-man crew draws from a diverse musi
cal background to create a unique blend of sound.
Division Day is a rock band. Their band name comes
from an Elliott Smith song. Division Day likes Elliott
Smith a lot. According to their Web page, "Any band's
strongest moment, as a unit, is its show. A good show is
the best forum, we think, for the pure transmission of
really important, intangible things."
Last year's runner up was blues outfit Ware Wendell
and His Hep Blues Quartet It's repertoire focuses pri
marily on '50s-era Chicago blues, but in creating their
own sound, they also include other blues styles, jazz,
classic soul and funk. Some musical influences include:
Junior Wells, Pink Floyd and the rhythmically complex
rock of Primus.
Rock band School of Ruckus started playing last year
and was in last year's Battle of the Bands. "We bring in so
many different sounds, ranging from heavy metal to old

Hindi songs — there is a
song or two in [our set] for
everyone's tastes," said
School of Ruckus member
Raj Duwuri. Musical influ-

too Much neon won last year's Battle of the Bands.
Members describe themselves as lots of little bits of our
imagination and childhood rolled into one. A divine
synthesis of four very different and very much alike peo
ple. And a whole lot of fun.
According to Sinister Dexter*s alto-sax player Patrick
Neschleba, u The idea behind the band was simple: Meld
the sweaty grind of funk and the righteous power of
blues with the swing music you wouldn't dare tell your
mother about. Put them all together and see what hap
pens. Coffee and cream. Beer and doughnuts. Gog and
Magog. The Left and the Right Sinister Dexter."
