Thing," the recent film "Shakespeare in
Love"). The play deals with the role of
the British in India circa 1930 through
the story of Flora Crewe, a consumptive
English poet who journeys to India and

falls into an enigmatic romance with an
Indian painter, Nirad Das.
Stoppard spent four of his first nine years in India and
learned to speak English there; though born in
Czechoslovakia, Stoppard says that his first memories are of
India. Perhaps as a result of this, the play has an air of insider
knowledge. You know that Stoppard has a feel for colonial
India, and that makes the play's ambigious statements about
the British empire all the more thought-provoking.
But the judgement of Britain's role in India is only one of
the many thematic threads woven together in "Indian Ink."

Though not as verbally riddling as some

Stoppard plays such as "Arcadia,"
"Indian Ink" may be Stoppard's most
structurally complex work. It jumps
between 1930s India, 1980s India '

and 1980s London. Along the way,
it becomes a doomed romance,

a farcical detec
tive story in
volving an A
merican acade
mic in search
of the truth
about Flora
Crewe and a
touching study
of Nadir's son
coming to
terms with his
father's and his
own "Indi
anne s s . "

Keeping up with these hybrid plot strands demands an unusu
al degree of concentration from the audience, but the effort
never goes unrewarded.
Leading "Ink's" prestigious cast is Art Malik as Nirad Das, a
role he created in the original West End production of the
play. Malik delivers a performance of considerable warmth
and sincerity, avoiding any of the extremes that might have
reduced Nirad to an inconsistent patchwork of pro-British
culture, anti-British-empire servility and resentment.
In contrast to Malik's performance, Susan Gibney's turn as
Flora Crewe lacks believability. Flora's scenes with Nirad never
really connect; her vocalizations cannot match his sincerity.
While Crewe occasionally electrifies the stage with her techni
cal virtuosity, Malik can make the audience forget that the
stage is there.
Rounding out the big-name cast are Jean Stapleton (Edith
Bunker from "All in the Family") as Flora's younger sister in
the 1980s London scenes and David Conrad ("Return to
Paradise," "Relativity") as Flora's British suitor in 1930s India.
Stapleton seemed to be suffering from some opening night jit
ters but had a sort of wise charisma nonetheless, and Conrad,

_ other than occasional cracks in his

British accent, was flawless.
Critics have sometimes accused

Stoppard of a tweedy intellec

tualism lacking in emo
tional vitality, of

focussing on language at
the expense of feeling.

Though hardly a melo
drama, "Indian Ink"
proves these critics

j wrong through mo
ments of true romance
. and true sadness. The
ACT has done well to
steal this bit of the spot
light from Broadway.
