# MOVIE REVIEWS
## TERMS OF ORDINARY MAGNOLIAS, 'The Other Sister' is as good as TV... 
### 
its title to its Message Of Tolerance, "The
LOther Sister" is a TV-movie dressed up as a
Hollywood production. The problem is that it's a
romantic comedy (not a terribly bad one, at that), so you
can't really laugh at the campy melodrama; rather, director
Garry Marshall ("Pretty Woman") is trying really hard to
make you accept the film on its own terms.
Perhaps that is not a problem. "The Other Sister" is often
a very entertaining film, featuring charming performances

from its leads, Juliette Lewis ("Cape Fear,"
"Natural Born Killers") and Giovanni
Ribisi ("Suburbia") as two mentally chal
lenged twenty-somethings (I know, I know
...) who fall in love. But movies that try so

hard to make the audience feel good,
particularly with the subject matter of

individuals challenged by society,
often frustrate such moments of triumph by being so

contrived. "The Other Sister" would be a much better
film if it just relaxed and told its story.

This problem is demonstrated by the dizzying
array of loose ends, sub-plots, overtones and dead
ends in the movie. Some go nowhere and need to

be dropped, like Danny's (Rabisi) obsession
with marching bands. Some are interesting

and appropriate and should have been
developed. j

One such lost development concerns
the workings of Lewis' upper-middle- t

class family, which could have been
an interesting movie by itself (in
fact, it already is: "Ordinary

People"). Diane Keaton offers a
compellingly sympathetic por

trayal of a dominating matri
arch who is intent on having
a "normal" family. The film

takes an easy out, though, as everyone else in the family
seems to indolently disregard her desire for propriety.
Rather than explore the intricate dynamics of a family
that seems perfect to the outside world, "The Other Sister"
forcefully identifies simplistic problems and then ignores or
"solves" them. For example, one of the sisters is a lesbian,
which the mother refuses to acknowledge, but then does.
And the father (Tom Skerritt) is a recovering alcoholic, but
that was years ago.

Instead of family dynamics, the movie is
. about Carla and Danny, a pair of star-
I crossed lovers, who ... oh, nevermind. The
r premise of the film is that Carla (Lewis) has
finally returned home at the age of 24 upon
completion of her school, which specializes

in educating developmentally chal
lenged young people. Her mother still

sees her as a child, though a particu
larly well-bred one. The inevitable
conflicts ensue each time Carla wants
to do something on her own: go to
trade school, move into an apart
ment, get married.

r Skerritt occasionally smiles wanly and
urges Keaton to let their daughter do

(what she wants, but you really want him
to tell her to loosen up and get off the
cross. Somehow, Marshall manages to
wrap all of this together and end it neatly
with two — count 'em, two — wedding

scenes. It's vaguely satisfying, but you can't

, help but wonder why you didn't
just wait to rent it, or better yet,
see what was on TV.
