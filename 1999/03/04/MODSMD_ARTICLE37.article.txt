# ANALYZE WHY DE NIRO IS IN THIS
## 'Analyze This' has two stars. Period 
### 
/^\\ e've all seen how powerful
Lsjwif rnob guys are supposed to
%J behave (in the movies any
way). They're supposed to be our heroes,
but they're also supposed to be "bad guys."
Robert DeNiro has had no small success
playing this type of hero. But in "Analyze
This," he gives us a character that we have
never seen before in a role he's played
numerous times.
When a mob boss starts getting ner
vous and teary-eyed while watching
cheesey commercials, things are bad. This

Analyze This

is what happens to Paul
Vitti (DeNiro) a few weeks
before a huge meeting with
all the crime bosses in the
country. He decides he
needs a "head doctor," but
has to be discreet — other

wise his reputation will be shot to hell. It
just so happens that one such "head doc
tor" had a fender bender with one of
DeNiro's henchmen the night before. Vitti

shows up at Ben Sobel's (Billy Crystal)
office. Of course, Sobel thinks he's going
to die, but Vitti calms him down and tells
him he "has a friend who is having emo
tional problems." Sobel wins his confi
dence by immediately seeing through the
mischievous "friend" facade and showing
genuine interest in Vitti's problems.
"Analyze" is at its best when dealing
with the dynamic between DeNiro and
Crystal and at its worst when delivering a
series of contrived plot devices whose only
purpose is to set up semi-decent one-lin
ers. DeNiro and Crystal have awesome
chemistry. They feed off each other's
humor while still maintaining their own
styles. There is nothing new in Crystal's
performance, but it is funny precisely
because it is what we expect from him.
DeNiro uses his strong sarcasm like a
weapon in this his latest stab at comedy.
Despite their chemistry, the rest of the
movie was really bad. Predictable, unbe
lievable, painful to watch, however you

want to package it: bad. For example,
there are two or three wedding scenes in
the movie. I lost count. Two or three wed
dings in one movie might not sound so
bad (although I think it does), but they're
all the same scene: DeNiro interrupting
Crystal's wedding to Lisa Kudrow for "life
and death" reasons. Granted, some of the
lines were funny in these scenes, but their
sheer unbelievability took away from the
humor.
I recommend "Analyze This" to three
groups of movie-goers: Super-hard-core
DeNiro fans (it's physically painful to see
him cry, so you get your money's worth),
people in the mood for a few quick laughs
(we all get in that mood sometimes) and
people who want to know what "pop psy
chology" means. No one else is likely to
find anything especially worthwhile in
"Analyze This."
