## POET OF HORROR Val Lewton film festival at Cantor 
### Robin Moroney Contributing Writer 
Jal Lewton made his 14 movies in only nine
Oyr/'years, before dying at the age of 51. He and
C/ his films were forgotten. They were barely
even known in the first place. We all know who the
greats of the 1940s were — Orson Welles, Powell and
Fressburger, Preston Sturges.
But Val Lewton?
Val Who? What films did he make? "I Walked with
a Zombie," "The Leopard Man," "The Isle of the
Dead?" Sounds like horror movies. They look like

horror movies, too. They
are horror movies.
Small, cheap horror
movies, with actors as
wooden as the sets,and
villains as smooth as
the heroines' skin.
Yet Lewton's movies
are more, much more.
They are beautiful, lit
erary, inventive. The
Hollywood studio sys
tem of the 1940s was
like a prison for
creative peo
ple. Nobody

got out alive. But some, like Lewton, man
aged to carve some amazing things on the
prison walls. Through something like
courage he refused to make the sort of horror movie
wherein women in nightgowns run, scream and
unluckily trip as the Fish creature noisily approaches.
Instead, his movies create fear out of darkness, intel
lect and calculation. Some of Lewton's biggest fans
were Alfred Hitchcock and Martin Scorcese.
Art Prof. Alex Nemerov, is currently screening five
Lewton movies at the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor
Center for Visual Arts. "These movies are interesting
to those interested in the 19405," Nemerov said. "The
culture, the look. They're interesting to those who
study film in particular. And also, all these movies are
appealing: visually attractive and very well done."
Before Lewton became a producer in Hollywood he
was a writer. At the age of 30, in 1934, he'd written
nine pulp novels and five non-fiction works —
including books on Cassanova, women in the
Depression and the history of cosmetics. As a novelist,
Lewton can mark his success by the fact that Adolf
Hitler considered one of his books, "No Bed of

Although Lewton might
be the producor of a

Her Own," worthy of burning.
Lewton moved to Hollywood in 1933 when
his mother got him a job with the David
Selznik unit at MGM. "Selznik was a master
producer," Nemerov said, "the most important
figure in the studio system." In those days the
producer, not the director, was the auteur of a
movie, overseeing every aspect of the movie's
creation. Lewton had plenty of glorious
moments at MGM. He persuaded Selznik to
hire the unknown Ingrid Bergman. He per

suaded the director of "Gone with the Wind" not to
place two large grapefruits in front of Vivien Leigh's
breasts in a dinner scene. The groundbreaking eleva
tor shot of the battlefield was Lewton's idea. But at the
same time, Lewton did less glamorous work for
Selznik. He once stood outside the restroom door at a
test screening for "Gone with the Wind," timing how

long people spent in the bathroom so that Selznik
could calculate the correct length for intermission.
In 1941 Lewton was hired by RKO. The company
was going down in flames. They'd just produced two
of the greatest films of all time: Orson Welles' "Citizen
Kane" and"The Magni
ficent Ambersons," both

complete and utter
financial disasters.
RKO's plan for survival:
produce as many cheap
movies as possible, get
some fast cash and
make more cheap
movies.
Lewton was told that
he could produce any
movie that he wanted so

long as he obeyed the fol
lowing rules. Rule No. 1: It must cost less than
$150,000. Rule No. 2: It must run less than 75 min
utes. Rule No. 3: It must have a market-tested title
proven to draw the crowds. Rule No. 3 was the least
negotiable of the lot.
And so Lewton, a literary man, a writer of verse,
found himself producing a movie called "Cat People."
"Cat People" was quite unlike other horror movies
of the time. It built elliptically towards the
frights rather than serving up nothing but
scares for 75 minutes. The film begins as a
romance between a decent male American,
Tom Conway, and a mysterious Serbian
female, Irena. The two meet at a zoo. Only gradually
do we begin to understand that this woman will turn
into a savage beast. Her husband doesn't believe her
when she tells him this, nor does her analyst.
Meanwhile, Tom falls for a woman at his office and
Irena, jealous and

strange, begins to change.
"Cat People" is not
unqualifiedly great. But it
works. It is frightening,
and when it isn't fright
ening there is still plenty
to look at, plenty to
enjoy. The movie saved
RKO. It cost $134,000
and became a huge suc
cess, making something
between $2 — 4 million.
Lewton went on to make
11 movies with RKO, all
under the same condi
tions. Each success
received a pat on the back
from the studio and the

announcement of yet
another impossible title:
"Well done Lewton, your next one will be called 'Curse
of the Cat People.' Good luck."
You can see Lewton struggling against the confines
of the B-movie in every movie he made. Most great
films choose to be one thing and then turn into some
thing else. For instance, "Blade Runner" is a science
fiction movie that becomes a study in mortality. "Pulp
Fiction" is a movie about other movies. But Val
Lewton movies attempt to turn this formula upside
down. Lewton tried to hide the B-movie nature of his
pictures by displaying so prominently what they were
about. Example: another of his movies is, in fact, "Jane
