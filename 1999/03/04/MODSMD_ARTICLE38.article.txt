# COVER STORY
## POET OF HORROR Val Lewton film festival at Cantor 
### Robin Moroney Contributing Writer 
Jal Lewton made his 14 movies in only nine
Oyr/'years, before dying at the age of 51. He and
C/ his films were forgotten. They were barely
even known in the first place. We all know who the
greats of the 1940s were — Orson Welles, Powell and
Fressburger, Preston Sturges.
But Val Lewton?
Val Who? What films did he make? "I Walked with
a Zombie," "The Leopard Man," "The Isle of the
Dead?" Sounds like horror movies. They look like

horror movies, too. They
are horror movies.
Small, cheap horror
movies, with actors as
wooden as the sets,and
villains as smooth as
the heroines' skin.
Yet Lewton's movies
are more, much more.
They are beautiful, lit
erary, inventive. The
Hollywood studio sys
tem of the 1940s was
like a prison for
creative peo
ple. Nobody

got out alive. But some, like Lewton, man
aged to carve some amazing things on the
prison walls. Through something like
courage he refused to make the sort of horror movie
wherein women in nightgowns run, scream and
unluckily trip as the Fish creature noisily approaches.
Instead, his movies create fear out of darkness, intel
lect and calculation. Some of Lewton's biggest fans
were Alfred Hitchcock and Martin Scorcese.
Art Prof. Alex Nemerov, is currently screening five
Lewton movies at the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor
Center for Visual Arts. "These movies are interesting
to those interested in the 19405," Nemerov said. "The
culture, the look. They're interesting to those who
study film in particular. And also, all these movies are
appealing: visually attractive and very well done."
Before Lewton became a producer in Hollywood he
was a writer. At the age of 30, in 1934, he'd written
nine pulp novels and five non-fiction works —
including books on Cassanova, women in the
Depression and the history of cosmetics. As a novelist,
Lewton can mark his success by the fact that Adolf
Hitler considered one of his books, "No Bed of

Although Lewton might
be the producor of a
movie called "Cat
People," at least he

means.

Her Own," worthy of burning.
Lewton moved to Hollywood in 1933 when
his mother got him a job with the David
Selznik unit at MGM. "Selznik was a master
producer," Nemerov said, "the most important
figure in the studio system." In those days the
producer, not the director, was the auteur of a
movie, overseeing every aspect of the movie's
creation. Lewton had plenty of glorious
moments at MGM. He persuaded Selznik to
hire the unknown Ingrid Bergman. He per

suaded the director of "Gone with the Wind" not to
place two large grapefruits in front of Vivien Leigh's
breasts in a dinner scene. The groundbreaking eleva
tor shot of the battlefield was Lewton's idea. But at the
same time, Lewton did less glamorous work for
Selznik. He once stood outside the restroom door at a
test screening for "Gone with the Wind," timing how

long people spent in the bathroom so that Selznik
could calculate the correct length for intermission.
In 1941 Lewton was hired by RKO. The company
was going down in flames. They'd just produced two
of the greatest films of all time: Orson Welles' "Citizen
Kane" and"The Magni
ficent Ambersons," both

complete and utter
financial disasters.
RKO's plan for survival:
produce as many cheap
movies as possible, get
some fast cash and
make more cheap
movies.
Lewton was told that
he could produce any
movie that he wanted so

long as he obeyed the fol
lowing rules. Rule No. 1: It must cost less than
$150,000. Rule No. 2: It must run less than 75 min
utes. Rule No. 3: It must have a market-tested title
proven to draw the crowds. Rule No. 3 was the least
negotiable of the lot.
And so Lewton, a literary man, a writer of verse,
found himself producing a movie called "Cat People."
"Cat People" was quite unlike other horror movies
of the time. It built elliptically towards the
frights rather than serving up nothing but
scares for 75 minutes. The film begins as a
romance between a decent male American,
Tom Conway, and a mysterious Serbian
female, Irena. The two meet at a zoo. Only gradually
do we begin to understand that this woman will turn
into a savage beast. Her husband doesn't believe her
when she tells him this, nor does her analyst.
Meanwhile, Tom falls for a woman at his office and
Irena, jealous and

strange, begins to change.
"Cat People" is not
unqualifiedly great. But it
works. It is frightening,
and when it isn't fright
ening there is still plenty
to look at, plenty to
enjoy. The movie saved
RKO. It cost $134,000
and became a huge suc
cess, making something
between $2 — 4 million.
Lewton went on to make
11 movies with RKO, all
under the same condi
tions. Each success
received a pat on the back
from the studio and the

announcement of yet
another impossible title:
"Well done Lewton, your next one will be called 'Curse
of the Cat People.' Good luck."
You can see Lewton struggling against the confines
of the B-movie in every movie he made. Most great
films choose to be one thing and then turn into some
thing else. For instance, "Blade Runner" is a science
fiction movie that becomes a study in mortality. "Pulp
Fiction" is a movie about other movies. But Val
Lewton movies attempt to turn this formula upside
down. Lewton tried to hide the B-movie nature of his
pictures by displaying so prominently what they were
about. Example: another of his movies is, in fact, "Jane


Fit to be tied in"The Ghost Ship."


Surprises abound in "Cat People
Eyre," and only by accident happens to be about Voodoo
and Zombies in the West Indies. The movie makes
explicit its embarrassment over it's own title: "I Walked
with a Zombie," and cracks a joke about it in the open
ing line. Ignore the title, the movie says, ignore the
zombie, feel the literature, the symbolism, the beauty.
"Cat People" is an exploration into the subconscious.
The movie's epigraph comes from an invented book,
"The Anatomy of Atavism," announcing from the start
that, although Lewton might be the producer of a movie

called "Cat People," at least he
knows what atavism means.
The movie could just as
well be called "Psycho
pathological People." There's
an analyst, a dream
sequence and reasons why
the subconscious can
explain a woman's fear of
becoming a monster. "I have
not yet been able to answer
the great question that has
never been answered: What
does a woman want?" said
Freud. To which Val Lewton
sagely adds, "Especially
when that woman is a Cat
Woman." This intellectual-

ism exasperated Lewton's studio heads. Having told him
that his next movie was to be called "The Isle of the
Dead," Lewton's executive producer emphasized,
"Remember, no messages." Lewton considered the title
and replied wonderfully, "I'm sorry, we do have a mes
sage, Mr. Holt. And our message is that death is good."
Like Irena, the woman who can't face up to her animal
istic self in "Cat People," Lewton's movies try to struggle
free from their B-movies status. And yet, the struggle
itself was as responsible for Lewton's art as he was him
self. One of Lewton's scriptwriters, Ardel Wray, com
mented, "a low budget was a challenge to him, a spur to
inventiveness."
Some artists have chosen to constrain themselves vol
untarily. The French novelist George Perec deliberately
wrote an entire novel without using a single "e."
Similarly Wole Soyinka, stuck in prison for two years,
was forced to write terse, compact poems, which could
be written and smuggled out of his cell in cigarette
packs. They are wonderful, and Soyinka dedicated them
to the confinement that had made them possible: "to all
who participated in the two-year experiment on how to
break a human mind."
Lewton's art exists with-in the three rules that RKO
laid down for him. His movies are not simply master

pieces inartistic terms but
are also the work of a mas
ter of the studio system.
Lewton would manufac
ture fake scripts and lie to
his executive producers to
maintain his artistic free
dom. While working on
"The Curse of the Cat
People," Lewton hired all
the actors from "Cat

People," convinced RKO
that he was making the sequel they wanted and then,
instead of making a movie filled with cats and creatures,
produced a film about 3 '-»nely child and her
imaginary friend. ("The Curse of the Cat
People" plays tonight at the Cantor Arts
Center)
And on top of everything else, Lewton discovered the
cheapest form of horror there is: the dark. "I was scared
of the dark when I was a child," says a character in"I
Walked with a Zombie." "But I'm not anymore." Lies,
lies, lies. Everybody is scared of the dark, especially chil

dren.
I was a child, once, at Disneyland. I remember it
fondly: gentle rides, gigantic mice and candy floss. But
even Disneyland has its horrors, and, for me, there will
never be anything more horrid than "The Pirates of the
Caribbean" ride. The ride ended in a cave filled only
with eyes and the darkness that surrounded them. That
night in the hotel I woke and saw the light of the hotel
room's thermostat blink in the dark. It was, almost cer
tainly, one of the eyes from the pirate's cave. I lay under
my sheets, terrified, until my parents returned.
What frightened me was not so much the eye itself,
but the invisibility of whatever it belonged to. Behind
the darkness a creature patiently stood. It looked at me
still with a single, winking, orange eye. Not able to see it,
1 imagined it, populated the darkness with every impos
sible nightmare. Daylight is filled with facts, unsettling
facts, but facts all the same. Night is not simply filled
with dreams; it is dreaming itself. Eighteenth-century
slang referred to the night as "Darkmans," which cap
tures perfectly the way that the night can move and
think all on its own. And this is the essence of Val

Lewton's horror.
"This was Lewton's realization," Nemerov comment
ed. "That people are far more scared of what they can't
see." Lewton cast gigantic shadows across his films, let
ting the viewers' imaginations create all the fear that
money cannot buy. Whereas in film noir darkness
meant sinister style, mystery, concealment, in Lewton's
movie, the darkness frightens.
Lewton produced horror without spending money
on mechanical widgets and wolfman costumes. He did
the exact opposite and hid everything that special effects
normally try to reveal. "It's not necessarily moralizing,"
moralized Nemerov, "to say that today's Hollywood
with it's endless stream of special effects could learn a
lot from Lewton."
RKO certainly didn't learn from Lewton and forced
him to put a real cat into one of the scenes in "Cat
People." The poor animal was a drugged panther the
studio borrowed from the zoo. On film it doesn't look
even vaguely terrifying. It looks more like it's
staging some kind of sit-in. Lewton and his
director Tourneur did their best not to
reveal too much of the animal, but even the
slightest glimpse disappoints; this is not
what we imagined when all we had to look at was the
dark.
And one more thing. If you watch "The Seventh
Victim," you'll be surprised to discover that the one shot
that everybody knows is Hitchcock's is in fact Lewton's.


You're watching too much TV, dear


Good kitty.
