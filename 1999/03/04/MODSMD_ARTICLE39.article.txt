## THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS Prince Paul A 						Prince Among Thieves 
### 
jhe skit has become a staple of cur
rent hip hop albums. Occasionally
amusing, but usually not, rap artists
have grown so fond of the skit (or
interlude) — a brief departure from the music
usually consisting of humorous or introspec
tive dialogues or short plays — that it has
become unheard of for an album to contain
less than the requisite 10 or so minutes of these
interludes. It is only appropriate, then, that the
first album based entirely upon skits should
come from the father of the hip hop skit,
Prince Paul.
Prince Paul introduced the skit concept to
hip hop in 1989 in his masterpiece collabora
tion with De La Soul, "Three Feet High and
Rising." Unfortunately, the skit has grown into
a cancer that has plagued hip hop albums ever
since, as those less adept try their hand at his
forte. On his latest album, Prince Paul endeav
ors to elevate the skit to a new plateau by craft
ing an entire record of skits into the first rap
opera, "A Prince Among Thieves."
"Written, produced, arranged, scored and
hustled" by Prince Paul, "A Prince Among
Thieves" is the story of Tariq, a young artist in
New York trying to make a name for himself in
the rap game. Along the way, Tariq encounters
a variety of mostly uninteresting, stereotypical
characters, played by an all-star cast including
Big Daddy Kane, De La Soul and Kool Keith —
by far the story's most engaging personality.
In a solid performance from the little
known MC Breezly Brewin, Tariq is lead astray
by promises of overnight success, resulting in a
predictably ironic conclusion.
While "A Prince Among Thieves" is relative
ly innovative given the recent stagnation of
new ideas in hip hop, it is an ultimately
uncompelling project. The quantity and brevi
ty of the individual tracks inhibit the flow of
the project as a whole. The few effective
moments arise when the story is told through
lengthy rhyming soliloquies and dialogues,
highlighting both the lyrical excellence of the
cast and Prince Paul's production talents.
Everlast's"Men In Blue," a policeman's account
of his own corruption, is one of the few con
vincing tracks: "My name's Officer

O'Maley / I'll shoot you in the
alley / And burn you like a

cross at a fuckin' Klan rally."
The tale told by "A Prince
Among Thieves" is tired
and unoriginal. Its story

and characters

are, unlike
Prince

Paul's typical projects, insipid and forgettable,
as his innovation in production fails to trans
fer smoothly to his writing abilities. While he
deserves credit for trying out this new concept
of a " rap opera," there seems to be a natural
discord when the words "rap" and "opera" are
used together. It just doesn't sound right. "A
Prince Among Thieves" confirms this intu
ition.
