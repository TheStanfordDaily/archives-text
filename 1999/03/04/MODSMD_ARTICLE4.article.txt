# State financial aid agency affected by internal feuds
## 
### Pedro Toledo 
Financial aid and loan guaran
tees for some Stanford students and
many public school students all over
California are getting caught up in
the internal disputes of the state
agency responsible for those loans.
Ed Shaver, the director of the
California Student Aid Commis
sion. is fighting the state's attempt
to lire him at the same time as he is
trying to take EdFund, the loan
guarantee arm of the commission

away from state control. Shaver also
heads EdFund. and the state claims
it is illegal to hold both positions at
once.
EdFund asked a state court
Tuesday to issue a temporary re
straining order to prevent its parent
agency, the aid commission, which
awards $350 million instate grants,
from firing EdFund's board of di
rectors, which includes Shaver.
If the court allows the commis
sion to lire its board, a potential split
between the commission and Ed-

Fund could occur, an action that
could affect Stanford students who
benefit from California grants and
those who have their loans guaran
teed by EdFund. said in The Chron
icle of Higher Education.
Shaver was otherwise unavail
able for comment.
He argued in the Chronicle that
as a private corporation. EdFund
could more effectively compete
against USA Group, the nation's
largest guarantee agency, which has
won a large market in the state.
He maintained that with more in
dependence from the state aid com
mission, EdFund would be able to
provide California students with
more generous rebates on their
loans.
While the change will affect all
California students, Stanford offi
cials see it affecting state schools
more than Stanford, which works
primarily with another organiza
tion.
"I don't see these problems im
pacting Cal Grants and very few
Stanford students use EdFund.
Most of our students' loans are
guaranteed by [the Northeast Loan
Association], another agency," said
Cynthia Hartley, Director of Stu
dent Awards at Stanford.
Some students, however, were
concerned about any change that
may occur and its potential effects.
"Students like myself depend on
these forms of financial aid; hope
fully these institutions will resolve
their problems in such a manner

that they don't affect students who
depend on them," said sophomore
Veronica Rocha.
According to an article in the
March 1 Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation, Shaver stepped down from
his post at the aid commission after
the State Auditor ruled that Shaver
had violated state conflict-of-inter
est rules because he was in charge of
both a state agency and a private
sector entity.
Shaver, who remained in charge
of the guarantee agency, stepped up
his efforts to persuade the state leg
islature to separate EdFund from
the aid commission altogether, and
allow it to become a private non
profit corporation.
The Chronicle reported that
many, including the new executive
director of the state aid commission
and his commissioners, accused
Shaver of trying to turn EdFund
into a private business to enrich
himself and EdFund's other top of
ficials from the student loan pro
grams. According to the Chronicle,
they argued that California students
would be better off if the guarantee
agency remained a public entity
with greater accountability to the
state.
