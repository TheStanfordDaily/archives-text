# Hotter Than Hell!!!
## An Injection of Psychobilly Madness (Various Artists) 
### 
ock critic Peter Guralnick once
wrote that "Rockabilly is the purest
(y of all rock & roll genres ... because it
never went anywhere." In other words, rocka
billy died after the first wave of rock ended at
the beginning of the '60s.
However, in the underground, rockabilly
has surprisingly morphed into a new form
known as psychobilly. This sub-sub-genre is
yet one more unexpected cross-product of
country and punk to emerge. Still, unlike
acoustic punkabilly (i.e. the Violent Femmes)
and cowpunk (i.e. Jason and the Scorchers),
psychobilly sticks closely to its instrumental
roots, meaning lots of echo-box vocals, rhythm
guitar, slapping stand-up bass and 4/4 drum
ming.
This somewhat slavish devotion to tradition
is balanced with a strange mix of macabre
humor and punk aggression — leading to
bands named Hayride To Hell, Barnyard Bai
lers and Pat C. Kline. All in all, psychobilly is a
beautiful contradiction — punk music was
supposed to destroy the past, not revive it.
Hairball 8 Records has now released a gen
erous psychobilly compilation entitled "Hotter
Than Hell!!!" Most of the bands hail from
Southern California, and indeed, their sound
owes a great deal to L.A. punk stalwarts Bad
Religion and the Offspring in both energy level
and melodic punch.
At their best, the songs are more or less
punk raves with an earthy flavor. Mad Sin's
"Naughty Little Devil" and Los Gatos Locos's
miraculously titled "Someone's Gonna Get
Their Head Kicked In Tonight" are both as
good as any '90s punk yet with a freshness con
temporary punk is sorely lacking.
Psychobilly's unique humor also gives the
compilation a nice attitude — especially on
alien-obsessed tracks like Three Blue
Teardrops' "Major Trouble (from Ursa Mi

nor)" and the Flametrick Subs'"Evil Eye."
Some tracks are melodic enough to pass for
pop — The Ditch Bank Okies' "Stepchild"
starts out pretty rough, but its chorus is a pow
erful, if somewhat derivative, triumph. Bea
Pickles's "Frazzled" borrows a great deal from
the Offspring, but the conviction of the female
vocals makes the track worthwhile. Curse of
the Pink Hearse's "Sweat In The Pillow" even
flashes a social imagination with evocative use
of a '50s newsreel.
Of course, since the compilation spans 27
different bands, consistency is a problem. Also,
while psychobilly's strange form of humor can
be endearing, the genre can occasionally go too
far. In particular, Deadbolt's "The Interview" is
a dialogue track which portrays senseless tor
ture and mutilation as "humor." In truth, this
"joke" is both unlistenable and unthinkable.
Ultimately, however, "Hotter Than Hell!!!"
succeeds in exposing a mostly invisible genre
of music, one which certainly has its charms.
Whether or not psychobilly ever finds a mass
remains to be seen.
