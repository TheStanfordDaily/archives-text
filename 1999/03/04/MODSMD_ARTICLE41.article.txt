# '90s Teen Bands vs. '80s Teen Movies
## (Various Artists) 
### 
/ i net ie s teen bands covering
/!/ songs from '80s teen movies seems
r like a fairly random premise for a
compilation album, but "In Their Eyes" man
ages to pull it off. The producers selected songs
from their favorite classic '80s movies of the
"Sixteen Candles," "Say Anything..." genre,
and commissioned the kids who were original
ly affected by these films (i.e. us) to update
them with their own personal spin.
Almost all of the album's tracks are enjoy
able. F.O.N, attempts a faux ska / metal / clas
sic rock cover of The Cars' "You Might Think"
which is innovative, but ultimately annoying.
However, renditions of Jackson Browne's
"Somebody's Baby" by Phantom Planet, Peter
Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" by The Stinky Puffs
and Echo and the Bunnymen's "Bring On the
Dancing Horses" by Round House don't stray
far from the originals and still maintain their
own integrity.
On the more rocking side of the fence are
The Rondelles, whose lead singer actually
improves on the vocals in Modern English's "I
Melt With You." The Donnas lend their dis
tinctive flavor of rock 'n' roll to Alice Cooper's
"School's Out," while Slimer's rendition of
"Raised On the Radio," originally by The
Ravyns, rocks out scrumptiously.
Some of the album's best tracks have a dis
tinct electronic slant. Crazy Glue's Daniel
Pemberton recorded his remix of Yello's "Oh
Yeah" (from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off") in his
bedroom on the same brand of Emulator that
Ferris uses in the movie, while MC's MatrÂ£ and
Ludochris of The English League provide a
fantastically busy, bleeping, beat-heavy rendi
tion of Oingo Boingo's "Weird Science." The
album's strongest track, though, comes from
Grand Royal recording artist Ben Lee, who has
the chutzpah to slap a banjo behind the
Thompson TVvins' "If You Were Here," creating
a bluegrass / Beck tinged masterpiece.
