Grooverider can do
2000. And how

high can you
count? Groove
rider can count
up to three bil-

lion and forty
, two, maybe
even higher.

j Grooverider is
} about as drum
& bass as it

gets. He's
got a

pandora's box full of beats, and he's

not afraid to open it up and let out whatever's
inside it. Judging from the album cover, he's
got biceps like sausage skins filled with con
crete. He's a big man.
But his music's even bigger. The twisting
bass, the crunchy drum loops, the diva vocals
— it's irresistible. The only way to hear the
music is to dance to it. Just check out
"Rainbows of Colour," which is about as ecsta
tic as drum & bass can get. Right when you
think the song has reached its limits, Roya
Arab's vocals lift it higher and higher. "Starbase
23" and "Where's Jack the Ripper" have drums
dancing on top of drums; the songs pause only
to take a breath before they get on with the
fury.
But for all his machismo, Grooverider's got
a sensitivity for the complex, gentler sides of
drum & bass. Drum & bass works with jazz
and funk in a way that house never really
could. There's the spiraling jazz of "Where's
Jack the Ripper" and "Cybernetic Jazz." There's
the square funk of "Rivers of Congo." There's

the quiet triple threat of "Imagination parts

1, 2, and 3." There's even Star Trek:
"We're caught in some kind of energy
distortion ... it's tearing us apart... On
speakers!"

And, of course, there's also some good,
old-fashioned, terrifying noise. There are
those who claim that music played on a

machine can't have soul. Well,
Grooverider does have a soul and, like
his music, it's dark. But, so what? Are
you afraid of dancing in the dark?
