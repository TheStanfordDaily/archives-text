## Dusty in Memphis 
### 
/^yy^ nst Y Springfield, who passed away
[Ty/J yesterday, occupies a rather contra
dictory position in the popular con
sciousness. On one hand she is cool enough to
be included on the "Pulp Fiction" soundtrack.
On the other hand it is hard to classify most of
her music as anything other than "easy listen
ing," a mongrel category encompassing every
one from Sinatra to Manilow. And indeed, as
the new deluxe edition of Springfield's canon
ical "Dusty in Memphis" proves, her connec
tion to R&B is tenuous at best. Yet this is no
reason to lump this album together with the
collected works of Barbra Streisand. The qual
ity that sets Springfield apart from the rest of
the Easy Listening gang is her effortless ability
to create emotionally powerful songs without
slipping into either kitsch or overblown dra
matics.
Dusty makes women's music. Yet she is
worlds apart from both Jewel's yodeling yearn
ing and the minstrel act of "Ally Mcßeal's"
Vonda Shepard. Springfield sings from an
indelibly female perspective with a voice that
combines vulnerability and weary resignation.
The songs are about conventional pop subjects
— love, heartbreak, loneliness — but Dusty
manages infuse them with new vitality. This is
music to get over your boyfriend by.
"Dusty in Memphis" includes the classic
R&B track "Son of a Preacher Man" as well as a
few punchy, brass-laden songs. Yet it is clear
that Springfield's heart is in the softer stuff; she
is never entirely comfortable with material that
asks for the saucy brawn of Aretha Franklin.
Instead, Springfield shines on such ballads as
"So Much Love" and "No Easy Way Down."
Meticulous about picking her material, Dusty
also turns to songwriters like Randy Newman
and Bacharach and David, and gives definitive,
breathy performances of "Just One Smile" and
"In the Land of Make Believe."
Though not a concept album, "Dusty in
Memphis" is a record that is best listened to in
its entirety. There is no filler among the origi
nal 11 tracks; taken together they create an

evanescent but poignant atmosphere of

lost illusions and new hopes. They

are torch songs, but underneath
the vulnerability in Springfield's

voice there is defiant strength.
This reissue also includes 14
bonus tracks that were origi-

nally recorded for sin
gles and for the

Atlantic album
that was never
released. These

songs unfortu
nately are a

mixed
bunch.
"Cherish"

and
"You've
Got a

112 Friend"
are as good

as the Memphis
material, while on
"Natchez Trail" and"I

Found My Way" Springfield sounds over
whelmed by the soulful R&B groove.
Springfield did not have the octave-span
ning voice of Etta James or the slickness of
Diana Ross. Yet her music affects you on a
more personal level. "Dusty in Memphis" is an
album of startling emotional power and is
essential for admirers of both soul and the Brill
Building songwriters. After all, it is hard to dis
agree with Dusty singing "Just a little lovin',
early in the morning beats a cup of coffee for
starting off the day."
