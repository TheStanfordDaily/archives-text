## EVEREST Top o' the world

112 on * n Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now," in an impro
vised scene, a drunken Martin Sheen strikes a full-length mirror
and severely cuts his hand. Coppola kept the cameras rolling, and

by scene's end Sheen is huddled next to his bed, naked,
bloodied and crying. Sheen reportedly had a heart attack
during a later shoot and nearly quit the film altogether. In
Hollywood, obsessively single-minded directors are about
as rare as bartenders soliciting screenplays — they're the
norm.
Fortunately, "Everest" filmmakers Greg MacGillivray and
David Breshears had their Hollywood priorities all wrong.
When tragedy struck the numerous expeditions scaling Mt.
Everest in 1996, the two reportedly dropped their camera

gear in order to lend a hand. They were humane in the face of catastrophe.
Unfortunately, this humanity is not reflected in their film.
The '96 climbing season was the worst ever in terms of fatalities. It has
already been popularized on tabloid TV and in the best-selling account by
journalist / climber Jon Krakauer, "Into Thin Air." Normally there is a two
week period every year when the weather around Everest becomes clear
enough to allow large groups a shot at the summit. What used to be the
endeavor of all endeavors has in recent years become something of a guided
tour; if you have $60,000 and at least average lungs, you too can pay a sherpa
to lead you to the peak. It's undoubtably still dangerous — the most common

path to the summit is literally marked by frozen corpses from expeditions
past — but dozens of inexperienced climbers routinely reach summit every
season without major problems.
In 1996, however, a freak storm struck in the middle of the

climbers' final push, and numerous groups were trapped along
the path, unable to move either up or down. MacGillivray,
Breshears and their crew sacrificed their supplies and radio
equipment to aid in the emergency and consequently shot no
footage of the most fateful moments. Key segments in the IMAX
film are supported either with stills narrated by 2-way radio, or
by (the horror!) home video footage shot at base camps. Sorely
lacking is any record of the mishaps and tragedies we have heard
so much about: the unforseen storm, the trapped climbers, res-

cue attempts, a late-coming survivor (Beck Weathers) who stumbled into
camp severely frostbitten, his arms held out frozen solid in front of him.
In a most unsatisfying manner, "Everest" shows every physical detail of the
mountain on a dizzyingly vast domed IMAX screen powered by thousands of
watts of multichannel audio, but at the same time fails to deliver its promise
of showing us the very simple story we've already been told. The fact that TV
could (and did) outdo IMAX in this regard is a minor tragedy of its own.
