# BRIT COMEDY GOES FOR THE BIG SCORE
## 'Lock, Stock' unlocks the laughter 
### 
/V>" —yn ock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" is the
v 112 / "Comedy that Conquered Britain" according to
'jfc ' Gramercy Pictures, the studio that produced this
surprisingly funny look at the rough East End of London. An
action comedy that follows a group of naive Britons trying to
save their butts by robbing real gangsters,"Lock, Stock" keeps the

audience interested and laughing all the
way through the escapades of the wanna
be toughs.
Although all the actors would proba
bly be new to an American audience,
most of them are new to the screen, as
well. The writer and director, Guy
Ritchie, brought together a rag-tag group
of actors in this, his debut feature, but he
picked them well.

★★ ★ ★

Vinnie Jones, a former soccer star for Wimbledon, is perfect as
Big Chris, an enforcer for the main bad guy. He is the quintes
sential thug and loyal only to his partner, heir and son, Little
Chris. His calculated violence coupled with perfect one-liners
makes him the star of this movie.
Nick Moran, another newcomer to the screen, is the street
wise, card-playing Eddy. He can't be beaten — until Harry,
Gangster Extraordinaire and self-named "King of Porn," rigs a
game and takes half a million pounds off of him and his backers.
Ritche uses interesting camera tricks throughout the movie,
such as freeze frames, which add to the comedic effect until their

overuse gets a bit annoying, and toying with the fast
forward / slow-motion button, which manages to elic
it laughs all the way to the end.
Moran's three partners in crime are Bacon (Jason
Statham, a former Levi's model), Soap (Dexter
Fletcher) and Tom (Jason Flemyng). Flemyng has the
most experience of the group, having starred in "Rob
Roy" and"The Red Violin."
Sting turns in a good performance as Eddy's father.
His bar is threatened because of his son's card playing,
and his interactions with Eddy are believable and fun
to watch.
Lenny McLean also turns in a good performance as
"Barry the Baptist." Barry is Harry's main henchman,
an old con with a dirty mouth and an attitude.
Overall, Ritche's debut is very impressive. It mostly
avoids trite comedic slapstick and keeps you laughing
through a subtle blend of violence and drunken fun.
