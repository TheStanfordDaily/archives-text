# 'GENERAL' MAYHEM
## The 						rise and fall of an Irish Iegend 
### 
General* was so deeply,
U/ deeply Irish, sometimes I
couldn't even understand it.
Although the acting and writing were both
clear and above par, I was lost when it came to
the political jokes and violence.
John Boorman'a black and white feature
follows the story of Martin Cahill, a notorious
Irish thief, through his rise and fall in the
streets of Dublin. Cahill and his merry band of
thieves start with simple crimes, like stealing
potatoes for dinner, but before the group
breaks up they have graduated to stealing
Vermeers. Since his outlandish thefts were so
well-planned and his personality was so
benevolent, Cahill became popular with his
poor neighbors. He was dubbed "the General"
and, at one point, was powerful enough to pull
off a job the IRA thought impossible. But the
movie also follows Cahill in his fall from glory,
when he loses his "army" one by one to vice
and the world seems to be against him.
Brendan Gleeson plays the role of the
imperfect but basically kind-hearted thief very
well. He has found the key to his Cahill: always
looking like you're down, like the world is out
to get you, when really, it's the other way
around. Gleeson's Cahill is always hiding his
face in his hand as if he were ashamed to be
who he is, yet with a single quip he always

manages to show
who's really on
top.
Jon Voight is
less impressive as
Cahill's nemesis,
the police chief.

ing the chief's respect for his opponent clear
enough, Voight's accent sounds less than
authentic. When Voight and Gleeson share the
screen, the intensity of their mutual vehe
mence almost makes it seem that Voight is the
central character of the film.
The comedic lines in"The General" are
well-spaced and provide a lift to the mood.
During a scene in which Cahill and his hench
men are casing out Vermeers to steal, one of
his men points out to the others that they
should "Check out the knockers on that one!"
I laughed, you might not.
The violence in the movie is strange. There
isn't much, but what's there is prominent.
When the General thinks that one of his men
is selling gold from a heist to keep up a smack
habit, he questions him with a hammer and
some nails. Boorman elevates the tension of
the scene with a barrage of close-ups and long
pauses. After being exposed to the level of vio
lence in Hollywood's productions of late, a

nail in the palm didn't seem to warrant all
the attention Boorman gave it. I also didn't
understand the biblical reference to Jesus'
nailed palms, as the character in question is
a minor one and his place in the plot is never
really explored.
It seems as if Boorman took on too much
when he set out to follow the General. All of
the surrounding characters are made impor
tant; Boorman can't decide whose story to
focus on, leaving instead a muddled plot that
slightly drags in the middle. But these are
relatively trivial complaints in the context of
the overall picture Despite its structural
flaws, "The General" was an enjoyable watch.
