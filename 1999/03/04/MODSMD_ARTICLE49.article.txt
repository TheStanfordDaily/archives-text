I was searching the Web recently, looking for tips
to improve my foxtrot, when I came across a dis
turbing sight. A page labeled "swinging" showed a
naked mass of tangled bodies instead of the bobby
socked, wholesome scene I'd anticipated. What is
going on here, and do I have to wait for Social Dance

Dear Harriet:
Miss Sass always jumps at the chance to broaden
her readers' sexual palate, so let's take a little quiz,
shall we? All right, complete the following sentences:
L When it comes to loviri, my motto is:
a. Who needs companionship when there's
Lubriderm?
b. Two's company, three's a crowd.
c. The more the merrier.
2. The idea of acquaintances seeing my naked
body makes me:
a. wonder what acquaintances are.
b. think back to high school gym class with a
chuckle and a shiver.
c. want to gallop merrily around the room>
nude, with the curtains open.
3. If sexual curiosity was tike food, mine would
he:
a. a bowl of Malt-o-Meal.
b. a raisin bagel with strawberry cream
cheese and a glass of chocolate milk.
c. an enormous doughnut with chocolate
and sprinkles and a crazy filling of some
sort that dribbles in gluey chunks down
your, well, you get the idea.
If you answered w a" the most, Miss Sass is sur
prised you have the constitution to read her
columns. Mostly "b" makes you a rather vanilla per
son with some potential for adventure and mostly
"c n says you're driving the kink train. So, "b's" and
"c's" (and you few brave u a" souls that are still read'
ing), a whole world of people much like yourselves
awaits you, a world of sexual adventure you have yet
to crack open — namely, the world of swinging.
Swinging is a social, sexual practice in which cou
ples gather and pair up with anyone but the people
they came with. The hook-ups usually involve sex
(but may not, depending on the people involved)
and for the most part take place in one of the cou
ples' houses. The point is to have recreational, unin
volved sex just for fun, and the idea is not a new one.
The term "swinging" is said to have first been used
by a minister who told his congregation that
immoral people swung back and forth between beds
like monkeys. But sources say the practice dates back
as far as biblical times* with rulers of both sexes
keeping multiple consorts to satisfy their appetites.
Some parts of Africa, Iran, Egypt, China and Japan
have done it for centuries, and orgies were all the
rage in France during the reign of Queen Made. As
for America, dear old Ben Franklin was known to be

and having sex for the good and dirty fun of it
remains a popular one today, A 0 that seems to have
changed is the added presence of a latex layer
between the swinging folks. So what is a person to do
when swinging sounds right up his or her figurative
alley?
An easy first step is getting online. Trillions of
Web sites have been erected (well, they have!) to
Serve the swinging community. If you wade through
the muck of porn that comes up when searching for
them, you'll be rewarded with chat sites, information
and services to hook you up with other pairs of
swingers in your area.
Notice Miss Sass said "pairs of swingers'* there.
Swingers are much more open to including couples
than single people and (sorry boys), more open to
single women than men. Whether it's to make pair
ing up easier, or keep the activity from becoming a
scam market instead of the enlightened, liberal prac
tice it's billed as. Miss Sass couldn't tell you. The fact
remains: you'll have much more luck with a partner,
Once you're actually at the swing party, the scene
usually follows a bask pattern. Small talk is made;
ho*s d'oeuvres are served; and unfamiliar feces are
introduced. Selection of partners is made through
discussion, drawing names, or as a recent movie
showed, picking car keys. Even though the aim sex
withoot strings, you'll still want to pick someone
who puts you at ease emotionally as well as attracts
you.
Keep in mind that certain protocols exist at a
party like this, as in any group activity. First, you can
only play in designated "play areas." While the host
couple assumes that people will be making mad ani
mal love in just about every room in their house,;
they will make it known which places should be
avoided. Maybe Lacy doesn't want you to stain the
den rag, or Seth won't like you pressed up against his
golf trophy case. If they tell you to stay out of the
kitchen and you push the cookie jar aside and go for
it, don't expect to be asked back.
Another thing that will smother the love vibe is
poor body hygiene, so — for goodness sake! —
shower, brush your teeth and wear clean socks. The
human body is interesting enough without the
added olfactory experience of ripe 8.0. Some
swingers recommend keeping a kit with a sample of
mouthwash, breath mints, deodorant and condoms
in your glove box, but you could just as soon take
care of it before you leave the house.
There you are, darling, an answer to your per
plexity and probably more than you cared to know
about the wild world of swingers. Remember to be
yourself, be courteous and have fun, wherever your
search for swinging takes you.
