this spirit we recommend that you
give no business to Bell's Bistro on
Broadway. Though it is still fashion-

able to dine California Nouveaux, Bell's Bistro has failed to
capture this popular West Coast cuisine.
Located 15 minutes north of Stanford on El Camino in the
heart of Redwood City, you must follow the twists and turns
of Broadway to find this small, tucked away restaurant.
Noticing the size of the restaurant, we were expecting a cozy,
friendly environment. We did not find this to be the case.
Walking through the front doors, we were struck by the
plainness of the d£cor. The closest comparison we can think of
is to the inside of a spruced-up diner.
We were seated at a table with a wonderful view of the bev
erage refrigerator, but the friendly service made up a little for
the lackluster interior; it was the highlight of the evening. Our
waitress, though seemingly inexperienced, was still very ami
able, as was the water boy, who cracked jokes and made our
meal as enjoyable as it was going to get.
Other than a few fish dishes, the menu was primarily com
posed of meats: steaks, chicken and lamb. Since we went with
a large group of friends, we were able to sample a variety of
Bell's offerings. First, while waiting for our appetizers, we were
served some bread with balsamic vinegar and oil dressing. The
bread had a distinct store-bought quality to it and got the
meal off to an ominous start. Next, after a considerable wait,
we were served a below-average bruschetta appetizer. The
bread was soggy from the vinegar sauce and made it practical
ly impossible to eat without creating a mess.
After that came a soup or salad — your choice with any
entree. The variety of lettuces and tasty blue cheese dressing
made David's dinner salad the highlight of his meal. On the
other hand, Adrien found his Caesar salad to be dissimilar to
any Caesar salad he has previously eaten. The mysterious lack
of either dressing or crunchy croutons did not blend well with
the chopped-up lettuce.
Unfortunately, the quality of food failed to rise with our
entries. While David s lamb was hearty in bulk, it was a poor
cut of meat. Combined with its heavy sauce, the entree has
weighed him down all week.
On the suggestion of the waitress, Adrien ordered the spe
cialty ribeye steak dish. The chef must buy all of his meats
from the same butcher because Adrien's ribeye was also a poor
cut. The steak was not tender and was full of fat.
We were also able to sample from our friend's dishes. One
of them opted for the vegetarian route. She began with an
inventive yet average-tasting cauliflower and mixed vegetable
soup. Her main course, grilled portobello mushrooms and
eggplant served on top of polenta, severely lacked flavor due to
the absence of any oil, the burnt vegetables and the fact that
the polenta tasted like it came from a can. The only other dish
worth mentioning was the cappellini with chicken and pesto
sauce. Both of us agreed that it was the best dish at the table.
Instead of pushing our luck with dessert, we simply asked
for the check.

Ambience: Poor
