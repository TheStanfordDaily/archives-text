# Fac Sen to discuss housing shortage
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
Today's Faculty Senate meeting
will focus on Stanford's faculty
housing shortage and administra
tion proposals to relieve the prob
lem.
Geoff Cox, the vice provost for
institutional planning, recently sent
University President Gerhard
Casper three alternative proposals,
each for 36 new housing units in the
Faculty Ghetto.
" The demand is great because
there is almost nothing for sale on
campus," said Cox. "It makes it hard
to make attractive offers to new fac
ulty."
The proposal has met opposition
fr6m the Stanford Campus Resi
dential Leaseholders, whose presi-

dent, Christie Hol
loway, called the
proposed develop
ment "unsettling
and disturbing."
Residents com
plain that the pro
posed housing fills
open spaces, like

Mayfield Playfield, that are vital to
the community.
In response. Cox has scheduled
seven meetings in the homes of local
residents to hear concerns. He
called the discussions "great... very
productive." The last of these meet
ings occurred last night.
Cox also continues to preside
over a housing task force composed
of members of the SCRL and the
administration.
Casper will consider the results

of the faculty discussion and the
homeowner meetings before mak
ing a decision on the housing pro
posals, said Terry Shepard, director
of University communications.
The lack of available housing re
sults from both high demand and
low supply. Housing in Santa Clara
County is the most expensive in the
nation, with on-campus housing
prices averaging more than
$S(K),(XKJ. In addition, emeritus pro
fessors fill a substantial amount of
the on-campus housing, leaving on
campus housing for only 6 percent
of assistant professors and 10 per
cent of associate professors.
Cox hopes that the new resi
dences already under construction
on Sand Hill Road will help ease the
crunch. In addition to providing
rental units for young faculty and

graduate students, the Sand Hill
Road development will have resi
dences for senior citizens.
"We've talked to many of the se
nior homeowners on campus, and
they will be interested in the [senior
housing]," Cox said.
In the future, the University
would like to make large-scale plans
for new faculty housing.
"We're looking actively at a site
on the west side of campus across
from Lyman," said Cox.
No definite plans will be made
for the location until the University
negotiates a new general use permit
with Santa Clara County in the next
several years.
The general use permit sets limits
on how many square feet of new
buildings the University can build in
a given period of time.
