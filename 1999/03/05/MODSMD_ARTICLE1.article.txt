# Former top spy speaks
## CIA director talks terrorism 
### Vlada Teper Contributing writer 
John Deutch, former director of
the CIA, spoke last night in Annen
berg Auditorium on the "Terrorist
Threat to American Security."
The 351 seat auditorium was
quickly filled as the MIT chemistry
professor was introduced. Deutch
has held several other significant
government posts, including deputy
secretary of defense.
Deutch identified terrorist
threats and proposed preventative
actions. Among the threats Deutch
named were the production of VX
nerve agents and the possibility of
subnational groups developing an
thrax.
To emphasize the reality of possi
ble threats he cited the situation in
Russia. "The Russian nuclear com
plex remains very, very insecure.
The guards are poorly paid. The in
frastructure is decaying," he said.
Deutch also discussed recent de
velopments that have served to fuel
terrorism. "There is now a potential
for the use of mass destructive
weapons," he said, citing biological
agents and chemical agents as exam
ples. "There is also the international
character of subnational technologi

cal threats."
Deutch then proceeded to discuss
issues that should be addressed by
the U.S. government. "We ought to
be doing even more on cooperative
weapon reduction," he said.
He stated that technology re
quired to deal with medical effects of
terrorism was not in place yet. "We
need to have some ability to manage
consequences should the event
occur," he said.
To prepare for those conse
quences, he said, the government
must coordinate its anti-terrorist ef
forts, perhaps by forming a new
agency. "If you can't measure it; you
can't manage it,"he said.
He went on to discuss the effect
the fight against terrorism has on

civil liberties. He cited the profiling
of airplane passengers as an exam
ple. U.S. security agencies identify
certain groups, such as those with
Middle Eastern ancestry, as repre
senting a greater risk for terrorist ac
tivity.
"Profiling really infringes on civil
rights, because it says one group of
people will suffer a greater burden
than another."
Deutch listed possible causes of
the rise in terrorism, including the
emergence of the United States as
the world's single most important
power militarily and politically. "We
are vulnerable because we are pow
erful," Deutch said.
Above all he stressed the need for
being informed and knowledgeable.
"It is very important that we under
stand how terrorist groups function."
In that area, he said, "more collec
tion and analysis is needed."
