### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Retired Supreme Court Justice
Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote the
1973 decision that legalized abor
tion nationwide and ignited a still
raging moral and political debate,
died yesterday at 90 from complica
tions following hip-replacement
surgery.
He had retired in 19M4, after
serving 24 years on the nation's
highest court.
President Clinton, who had
come to know Blackmun well,
praised him "'for defending our lib
erties and our institutions, for mov

ing us forward together."
Blackmun was considered a
staunch conservative in his early
days on the court, but by the time he
retired was considered its most lib
eral justice.
His authorship of Roe vs. Wade
brought him repeated threats on his
life. He received more than 60,000
pieces of "hate mail" calling him a
murderer and comparing him to the
Nazi overseers of genocide. Black
mun insisted on reading all such
mail. "I want to know what the peo
ple who wrote are thinking," he
once said.
