# U.S. pilot acquitted in Italy tragedy

### 
CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) —Outraging
Italian authorities, a military jury yesterday
cleared a Marine pilot of charges he was Hying
recklessly when his jet sliced through a ski gondo
la cable in the Alps and sent 20 people plunging to
their deaths.
A whoop went up in the tiny courtroom when
the eight Marine officers found Capt. Richard
Ashby innocent of 20 involuntary manslaughter
charges and other counts. The jury deliberated for
7 1/2 hours.
"Basically, all I really want to say is this has
been a tragedy for all involved," Ashby said. "My
heart, my thoughts and prayers go out. to the fam
ilies of victims of this tragedy."
Prosecutors said Ashby was "flat-hatting" —
recklessly flying too low and too fast — when his
EA-6B Prowler hit the cable on Feb. 3. 1998. He

could have gotten 2()6 years in prison if convicted
of all charges.
Ashby argued that the cables weren't on his
map, that the jet's altitude-gauging equipment
malfunctioned and that an optical illusion made
him think he was tlying higher.
Ashby still faces another court-martial, on
obstruction of justice charges for the disappear
ance of a videotape his navigator made during the
fatal (light. He could get a year in prison if con
victed.
When the acquittal was announced, ending a
trial that began Feb. 8, a prosecutor turned and
said quietly, "I'm sorry" to some of the victims'
relatives. Other relatives hugged and wept.
"1 am really baffled by this ruling," Italian Pre
mier Massimo D'Alema said during a visit to
Boston. He said Italy will "explore all the legal

ways" to hold those responsible liable.
Achille Occhetto, president of the lower house
of the Italian Parliament's foreign affairs commit
tee, said, "In the face of many dead, and such clear
responsibility, this verdict is an act of arrogance
and prevarication."
The accident happened on a training flight
through the Italian Alps. Ashby flew the jet into
two cables of the Mount Cermis gondola at Cav
alese, Italy, sending it hurtling into the valley.
Eight Germans, five Belgians, one Austrian,
onoDutch, two Poles and three Italians died.
The accident caused an uproar in the Alpine
ski area, where people had long complained about
the "Top Gun" antics of pilots from the NATO
base at Aviano, Italy. The tragedy also strained
relations between the United States and Italy, a
NATO ally.
