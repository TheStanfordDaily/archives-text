It is no surprise that
our provost could be
headed for national office

TEXAS GOVERNOR George
W. Hush isn't quite a presiden
tial candidate. Condoleezza
Rice isn't quite a retired University
provost. Officially, they're not collab
orating on a campaign for the 2000
Republican presidential nomination.
ITiat doesn't stop speculation that
Rice will play a key role in the gover
nor's "potential" run for the White
House — and it doesn't stop Rice
from downplaying their relationship.
"People keep putting two and two
together and getting 264," she said in
January when asked if she would
advise Bush in a presidential bid.
When media outlets reported this
week that Rice was indeed serving as
a Bush advisor for international poli
tics, she called any speculation on her
role in a campaign premature "until
he decides what to do, until I'm no
longer provost."
Bush, the son of former President
George Bush, is expected to
announce Monday the formation of
an exploratory committee to consider

a presidential run. Iliat will allow him
to start raising money for a campaign,
and the amount of cash he is expected
to bring in makes him an immediate
favorite to capture the GOP nomina
tion.
Not that a Bush campaign would
be a surprise. Hie governor has been
"not running" for president for nearly
a year, remaining noncommittal on
his status while basking in the glow of
opinion polls that show him beating
the Democratic favorite, Vice Presi
dent A 1 Gore, by more than double
digits in a possible race.
When Bush does make a formal
announcement, don't be surprised if
the soon-to-be former provost takes a
large role in shaping his campaign
platform.
Rice advised Bush's father during
his term in the White House. And if
the younger Bush wins in 2()(X), don't
be surprised if Rice lands a cabinet
position like Secretary of State.
I'he only real surprises that could
come out of this relationship now
would be if Bush dropped out of the
running or if Rice discussed any kind
of campaign role before June.
In the meantime, it's getting easier
and easier to see hov. two and two
make 264.
