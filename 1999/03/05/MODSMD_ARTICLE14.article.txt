Weisburst letter neglects rights to free speech

Seth Weishurst's reaction to the Human
Life Alliance insert is peculiar. After all, to
"advertise" is to publicly proclaim or notify;
it doesn't require a product.
Maybe he didn't actually open the insert.
It's possible that the underlying tone of the
letter wasn't intentional, but it needs to be
addressed.
Whether to abort is one of the most ago
nizing decisions anyone could make. It's a
decision that should be made thoughtfully
and with careful weighing of all sides.
In the insert, several women poured out
their agony over haunting nightmares and
deep, lifelong regrets. They described the
many things they wished they had known
before they had an abortion. They spoke

out with personal, firsthand knowledge,
which deserves our respect regardless of our
beliefs.
Weisburst's letter silences and demeans
these women and also — more to the
point — others who suffer after an abor
tion. The letter says they're "brainwashed;"
it deprecates their voice as "propaganda."
Before an abortion, a woman should
have the right to know what to expect in the
hours and years ahead. After an abortion,
she should have the right to warn others
without being compared to a Holocaust
revisionist.

In his letter to the Opinions section, Seth
Weisburst described Tuesday's pro-life
insert as "a right-wing organization that is
trying to brainwash college students into
believing that the government should con
trol the bodies and choices of its female cit
izens."
However, he failed to cite any examples
from the publication to support his asser
tion.
I am not sure if Weisburst objects to The
Daily including political inserts in general or
only "propaganda" that he disagrees with. I
was personally pleased to see this insert
included in The Daily, because it raises
awareness of legally-sanctioned infanticide
in America.

If the unborn human child is a human
being with human rights, then to terminate
its lite would be murdering an innocent
human being.
Thus, all the arguments about personal
choice do not justify murdering innocent
people who are inconvenient.
The outrage against abortion is valid on
these grounds.
Weisburst had the opportunity to refute
this "propaganda" with cogent arguments,
but, instead, all he did was attack The Daily
for facilitating the dissemination of ideas he
doesn't agree with.
