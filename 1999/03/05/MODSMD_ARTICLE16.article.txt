## Alden Clarke Learning from Dead Week 
### 
IF, BY THE inertia of
scholastic achieve
ment, you ever chance
to attend Stanford Univer
sity and participate in its
"Dead Week," you will
learn many exotic new
facts.

You will find out:

That the largest and most private offices
on the Stanford eampus are in the History
Corner, which students invade each night of
Dead Week in order to construct personal
academic wombs in the luxurious and well
appointed 75-person capacity classrooms,
sustaining isolated nocturnal toil that ends at
8:55 a.m. when other students stroll into the
womb for their y a.m. lecture.
That the name "Dead Week" is some
sort of pernicious, vestigial misnomer for the
week preceding final exams, during which
courses actually continue as usual; lectures
happen, work is assigned and work is due.
Administrators will inform you that they
have tried to end the inaccurate connota
tions of Dead Week by giving it a new name,
"End-Quarter Period." which has not
caught on.
That three is the record for the number of
consecutive nights a student has gone with
out sleep, a record shared by a sufficiently
significant number of people to suggest the
existence of an impenetrable somnolent
glass ceiling at exactly three nights.
That during Dead Week some students
devote more temporal and financial
resources to self-care, dressing unusually
formally and eating out often. Others, for
example, who don't normally often brush

their teeth adopt and religiously abide by
Booker T. Washington's "gospel of the
toothbrush," a practice which they'll tell you
consists of maintaining immaculate oral
hygiene. Such students often navigate the
End-Quarter Period gracefully, dignity
intact.
That some people just cannot do any
thing until it's due. Then that, miraculously,
these people consistently achieve around
the level of their classmates.
That some students have, by the begin
ning of Dead Week, produced computer
generated print-outs of schedules directing
their every hour for the remaining two
weeks of the quarter.
That many of these same students deploy
motivational quotes on their desjes and tyck
up on their walls-posters of eagles with cap
tions like: "Dare to soar: attitude, I Tnofe than
anything, determines your altitude in life."
That stress and a large workload do not
inhibit but rather stimulate romantic feeling.
In some the effect is so pronounced that
they must ignore even the most platonic
invitations to study in ordinary, public
places, for fear of just losing control of their
fly, amorous selves.
That nearly everyone procrastinates.
Big time.
That during Dead Week a few students
will report experiencing something called
"synthesis," a profound, macroscopic disclo
sure of the fundamental, Parmenidean same
ness of all things — reportedly way cooler
than an epiphany — to which they are so
addicted that they voraciously consume even
their dreariest course books, despite their
trembling hands and blood-shot eyes, just to

keep alive the desperate hope of sating their
craving with the type of sublime, pre-lingual,
visceral knowing that can only be referenced
by saying something like, for example,
"DUDE ... IT'S ALL ENERGY."
That no matter how badly you want to
and no matter how much doing so would be
consistent with your treasured long-term
goals, sometimes you simply cannot study.
That a little known proof of the non
axiomatic nature of human knowledge and
expertise is: understanding everything in the
textbook, perfectly, does not translate into
being able to solve problems. Conversely,
that being able to solve problems does not
translate into being able to read and under
stand the textbook. Then, that exams do not
test your ability to read and understand the
textbook.
That many students are addicted to
assessing their progress, meaning they
obsessively calculate such quantities as
"minimum writing rate, in words per
minute, sufficient for completing final paper
by deadline" or "chapters to master per day,
for total exam readiness." That they will on
occasion update these calculations twice per
minute. That awareness of these quantities
inspires abject, motivating fear. That this
compulsion afflicts nearly all of those stu
dents who just cannot do anything until it's
due.
That everybody makes lists.
