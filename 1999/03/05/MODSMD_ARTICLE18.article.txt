# Bringing it all back home
## Mark Silver Soul-searching in a problem-set world 
### 
I DIDN'T USED to like Ani DiFranco. I
thought she was a typical angry lesbian
folksinger whose songs all sounded the
same. But now things have changed.
See, for a long time I was in love with
this girl. Maybe I still am. Her name is
Katie, and she was the most amazing thing
that ever happened to me. She was beauti
ful and intelligent and fun and the best
dancer I have ever seen. She made me
think.
We went out for four years. I fell in love
pretty fast, and 1 guess she did too. This was
no ordinary teen-age relationship. We were
the best. We had something that no other
couple in the world has ever had. We had
the look — that look when two people just
stare into each other's eyes and this intensi
ty builds up inside each of them, and it's not
a sexual thing. It's an emotional thing, a
crazy passion that can't even totally express
itself through physical contact. We'd look
at each other, and we'd just know, just

know that we were right. Yes, we had our
problems, but we always came back to the
look.
Soulmates — that's what we called each
other. We had a lot of the same passions,
the same excitement for traveling and
music and dancing. She was the only person
I have ever known who I could be together
with, but still alone. We could just sit next
to each other, for hours on end, sometimes
giving each other a quick smile or a squeeze
of the hand but without speaking at all. Just
sit and think, or watch or listen.
But four years went by, and the hurts
piled up. Something changed. The connec
tion didn't break; I don't know if it ever
will. But it got weighed down with this sad
ness, this depression of too many
heartaches and too much damage. The look
remained, but it was a look tainted by pain.
We could never be truly happy around each
other anymore —it was like gloom had
descended to haunt our every move.

So it ended, just about three months ago.
It's over, all four years of insane intensity
and the roller coaster that we called a rela
tionship. It's over, and I feel like part of me
has been ripped out.
I think over time we sort of morphed
into one person, one being, even when we
weren't together or didn't see each other
that much. And now we've been torn apart,
leaving this empty void inside me that
friends or school or anything can't really
fill. I can't shake this feeling of emptiness,
this feeling that even though I should be
happy, that the only problems I. have are
finals and lack of sleep, I'm not. I can't
seem to be happy by myself — not yet. And
being here certainly isn't making that feel
ing any better.
I think that there's something about
Stanford University that invites loneliness,
that encourages us to be ambitious, inde
pendent individuals, with our schoolwork as
our first and foremost priority and friends

and social ties as only secondary. But I need
people — people are my first priority, not
some stupid paper or problem set. I hate
that mentality, that feeling that no one here
really cares about anyone else, that we're
only here for our degrees and we're all
brainwashed into saying "I love Stanford!"
without thinking about reaching out to peo
ple, about being open to meeting people
beyond a superficial frat party level, about
opening up to our friends, about letting our
selves cry and be held by someone else.
I don't fully understand the feeling I
have about this place, and I don't know
whether to blame it on the school or the
students or my own feeling of loss. But
something needs to change, and change
now. Why don't people smile back when
someone smiles at them? Why is it so diffi
cult to make eye contact? Why won't peo
ple pass up a night of drunken fumbling for
some good conversation? Why not say yes
to that date? Why is everyone so damned

afraid to let their guard down, to let go of
their future-oriented worldview for just a
little while? I think that there's something
not quite right about Stanford. Prove me
wrong.
Katie loves Ani DiFranco. She said once
that she wonders why she pretends to like
any other music besides DiFranco's. She
introduced me to Ani, and I grew to like
her. Then the end came, and a month later
she sent me an Ani mix tape. I listen to it
and think of Katie, think of a time when I
had a connection with someone, a mental
and physical and emotional connection
with someone amazing.
Why songs about lesbians make me
think of her, I don't know — maybe I'm a
lesbian myself.

Mark Silver is a sophomore who is currently
undeclared. He hopes that the next time he
smiles at you, you smile right back.
