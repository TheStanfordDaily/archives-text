# Marguerite driver may face charges in accident
## 
### Catherine Lau Contributing writer 
The Stanford Police Department
is currently investigating allegations
that a Marguerite shuttle driver in
tentionally struck a motorist on
March 2.
The incident occurred at 6:05
a.m. at the intersection of Campus
Drive and Serra Street. Gilbert Lee,
a construction worker, was driving
to work when his vehicle was side
swiped by a shuttle twice. According
to police reports, Lee then got out of
his truck and asked the shuttle dri
ver to stop. The driver did not,
though, hitting Lee with the shuttle
and knocking him down.
Sgt. Hilary Karp, head of the in
vestigation, said that the driver re
ported that he was not aware of the
situation. He said "he didn't know
that something had happened,"
Karp said.
Investigators will meet with the
Santa Clara County district attorney
on Monday to determine whether
any charges will be brought against
the unnamed driver, who is em

ployed by Laidlaw Transit Services.
Karp said that Lee complained of
muscle spasms and pain to his left
thigh but was not hospitalized.
"We will probably discuss this
case with the transportation depart
ment here on campus and talk with
them to determine if there needs to
be a more rigorous evaluation of
shuttle drivers." Lieutenant Del
Bandy said. "It's ultimately left up to
them if they want to set up stricter
guidelines with the contractor."
According to Leslie Quintero,
manager of parking and transporta
tion, Laidlaw employs all Mar
guerite drivers and provides the
campus with its shuttles.
" The contractor has their own in
surance, so the responsibility of this
incident lies primarily upon Laidlaw
and the police as of now," Quintero
said. "I have not received a police re
port yet. It's important to remember
that it's only an alleged incident."
Bandy agreed. "Basically, the in
vestigation process is over. We've
interviewed both parties and con
tacted any possible witnesses. We're
just waiting to see the outcome of

the meeting with the district attor
ney."
If charges are brought against the
shuttle driver, Quintero admitted
that some sort of reevaluation must
take place. "If the driver's actions
are proven to be irresponsible and
egregious, then we will take the issue
up with Laidlaw."
Currently, Laidlaw puts all Mar
guerite drivers through a safety
training program independent of
any University involvement.
"I take the Marguerite all the
time, and I find them to be safe,"
freshman Annie Chan said. "The
drivers drive at a reasonable pace
along a prescribed route that doesn't
allow for much error."
"Sometimes you see the drivers
cutting off people when switching
lanes and driving really fast," fresh
man Will Faciosaid. "It can get to be
a safety issue."
"We pride ourselves with provid
ing good service," Quintero said.
"Everyone must remember that this
is an isolated incident. We hope that
people will still feel safe riding the
Marguerite."
