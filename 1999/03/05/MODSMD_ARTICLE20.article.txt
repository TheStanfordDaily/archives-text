## Nehamas advocates studying depth, not breadth 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Although philosophy may not provide definitive an
swers to moral questions, leading a philosophical life can
help us determine whom we want to be, according to
philosopher Alexander Nehamas.
As the final presidential lecturer of winter quarter, Ne
hamas will deliver a talk on Monday evening at 7 p.m. at
r<x)m 290 in the Law School,, titled "The Sleep of Reason
Produces Monsters."
"What kind of person you are and what you believe
philosophically are closely related. Philosophy helps us
determine what we want to be like, who we are and how
to manifest these views in our own actions," he said.
Nehamas, who is the Edmund N. Carpenter Professor
in Humanities, professor of philosophy and professor of
comparative literature at Princeton University, also
serves as the head of the Council of the Humanities and
has written books on Nietzsche, Plato and Socrates.
In an interview earlier this week, Nehamas, who was
born in Greece, said he has always viewed philosophy as
connected to art and literature.
"I've always been more drawn to literature and the
artistic sides of life; I found philosophy inspired by litera
ture and art and have always thought of them as connect
ed."
Nehamas said he was initially drawn to philosophy in
high school because at that time, he thought it was "deep."

He has since changed his view.
"The way I look at my work, at philosophy and reading
in general, [is] more as if it were an attempt to find breadth
... to find connection into what was unconnected before."
"Instead of starting with a surface that means some
thing and then digging, [I propose] that we begin with a
patch, which we don't know the meaning of unless we con
nect it to other patches," he said.
In this framework, there is no danger of hitting the bot
tom, and "meaning is inexhaustible," he added.
Given that "depth" is no longer a fruitful concept, Ne
hamas argued that a humanities education should culti
vate a love of beauty, not just truth.
"I want to say that beauty goes with imagination. Stim
ulating the imagination even if that may not make people
morally better, but it will make them more complex, more
interesting, more engaging. There are virtues that are not
moral virtues," he added.
"Nietzsche is a great inspiration for thinking that moral
values are not the only values there are," said Nehamas,
who is the author of "Nietzsche: Life as Literature."
In his book "The Art of Living," Nehamas maintains
that aesthetic virtues such as connectedness, elegance,
grace and originality were considered important in the
time of Socrates, but have been neglected in modern edu
cation.
Instead of looking to philosophy for guidance on prac
tical questions, we should view philosophy as a "particu
lar way to lead a life," he said.
