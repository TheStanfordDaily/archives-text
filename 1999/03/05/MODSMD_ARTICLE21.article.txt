## No.6 hoops barrels through Ducks Lee goes for 21 in victory over Oregon 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — Just past noon yesterday
in Eugene, the gray skies over Oregon opened
up and began to dump an endless sheet of white
hail upon the ground.
Later in the evening, the showers continued.
Only this time, the falling spheres were not pel
lets of hail — they were basketballs. The Ore
gon men's basketball team hit a barrage of 3-
pointers with startling ease to keep the Ducks in
the first half of its game with the No. 6 Stanford
Cardinal.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford (25-5,15-2 Pacific 10
Conference) 73, Oregon (15-11,7-10) 61.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford at Oregon State (12-14,6-
11), 7:05 p.m.

But with Selection Sunday just three days
away, Stanford weathered the 3-point storm in
side Mac Arthur Court and made one more
powerful statement for its case to he a No. 1 seed
in the NCAA tournament.
Those threes were not nearly enough to lift
theDucks(ls-l 1,7-10 Pacific 10 Conference) to
victory over a Stanford team that cruised to a
methodical 73-61 victory and appears to be
peaking at exactly the right time.
Senior point guard Arthur Lee continued to
shine, leading Stanford (26-4,15-2) with a game
high 21 points. The Pac-10 Player of the Week
appears to have rediscovered the confidence
and shooting touch that possessed him as the
Cardinal's shepherd into the Final Four.

"Last weekend was such a wonderful experi
ence, winning the Pac-10 title and celebrating it
with our fans and families," said junior forward
Mark Madsen. who finished with 12 points and
14 rebounds. "We knew that this Oregon team
had plenty of good athletes and shooters. So we
came up here with a certain sense of urgency,
knowing that the NCAA tournament is right
around the corner.
"Arthur Lee carried this team to the Final
Four last year." Madsen added. "And so to see
him playing so well right now — that will be
paramount for us."
Yet for all the positives that came out of an
other convincing win for Stanford, perhaps the
biggest news of the night could he extremely
sour for the Cardinal. Midway through the sec
ond half, sophomore forward Jarron Collins
was going for a loose ball and got his left leg
caught underneath the 260-pound body of Ore
gon sophomore forward Flo Hartenstein.
Collins's knee and ankle both buckled under
neath Hartenstein, and Collins was clearly shak
en, lying flat on his back tin the Mac Court hard
wood long after the play was over.
Collins, who has been an instrumental play
er in the Cardinal's Pac-10 title run. limped off
the floor and into the locker room, where he was
examined by team trainer Jeff Roberts for a
solid 10 minutes. Roberts then returned to the
team bench, but Collins was nowhere to be
seen.
Long after the game had ended and the fans
had emptied out of "The Pit," Collins emerged
from the locker room with a walking cast on his
left ankle, hobbling on crutches. X-rays will be

taken today.
"Jarron has been incredible in the
post for us this year," Madsen said.
"We will definitely need him in the
tournament, and to even lose him for
just one game would be hard to han
dle."
Despite the relatively solemn
mood on the bus after the win, the
bottom line for Stanford was anoth
er solid team effort and a road win
that exuded a complete game and an
air of veteran confidence.
"We weren't very sharp in the
first half," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We let them
get some open looks for three and

our defense wasn't very sharp. But
to get a win on the road against a
team like Oregon is a compliment to
our team."
The loss all but ensures that the
Ducks will not make the field of 64 in
next week's Big Dance.
Tim Young joined Madsen with
12 points and 14 rebounds, despite
missing five shots from close range.
Senior team captain Peter Sauer
and sophomore guard Mike Mc-
Donald also contributed 10 points
apiece.
"We got Mike playing the point
so we were able to get Art involved
in the motion," Montgomery said.
"Obviously someone has to have a
good night for us, and tonight Art
did it again, like he has so many
times before."
