who put the ball through the hoop
with her familiar pigeon-toed jump
shot.
Then Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer blew her whistle, and
practice continued with shooting
drills and sprints.
After three years of playing Pacif
ic 10 Conference championship and
Final Four basketball with Ail-
Americans like Wideman and Star
bird, Freuen now faces the skilled
veterans only in practice, where they
work out with the team.
When game time arrives, Freuen
takes the floor with players two.
three and four years younger than
she. And after three years of champi
onship-level basketball. Freuen now
plays on an unranked team that is
third in the Pac-10.
"It's been hard: I haven't lost this
many games my whole career here."
Freuen said. "I don't deal with losses
very well."

Freuen has been an asset even in
the team's losses, according to Van-
Derveer, because of her persever
ance. "She goes 'damn' and keeps
working," VanDerveer said.
Freuen has found her role on the
young team, both as a breakout play
er and a locker-room leader whom
VanDerveer calls a "second coach."
VanDerveer pointed to the im
portance of having a player on the
team with a connection to Stanford's
winning tradition.
"That's the thing with Regan —
she can explain to our team, 'look,
this is why we're doing this.... This
has worked,' " she said.
Freuen noted that "I can help he
cause I've been in every role: I've not
played, I've redshirted. I've come off
the bench and I've started."
Indeed, Freuen, a fifth-year se
nior. has traveled a varied path
through Stanford's recent basketball
history. As a freshman, Freuen saw
little time behind players like Star
bird and Vanessa Nygaard. During
her sophomore year, her effective
ness was hampered by injury, and
she missed her entire third year due
to a stress fracture in her right hip.
Last year she started the final 13
games and gave a valiant 19-point ef
fort in the team's first-round tourna
ment loss to Harvard.

"It wasn't easy for her," Van-
Derveer said. "She didn't play a lot
as a freshman, [then] she was hurt a
lot. She's a great example for deter
mination and sticking with things."
This year, alternating between a
starting and a reserve role, Freuen
has sparkled.
She hit the winning free throw in
November to beat then-No. 1 Pur
due. scored a career-high 34 points to
lead Stanford to a dramatic win at
UCLA last month and had 21 points
in last night's 82-73 win over Oregon.
"When you're on those streaks,
the basket just gets bigger and big
ger," she said.
Freuen's recent individual high
lights cannot measure up to her early
team successes, however.
"Going to three Final Fours was
an incredible experience; it's memo
ries for a lifetime," she said.
Freuen admits that the team is not
likely to make it back to the Final
Four in this, her final season. She
does believe, however, that the team
has great potential.
"We've shown that we can play
with the top teams," she said. "At
this point, our problems are more
mental than physical."
VanDerveer said that she and


Josh Haner — Daily
Senior Regan Freuen, an integral part of the veteran leadership this season, has led the youthful
women's team by example (9.5 ppg, 36.6 percent 3-pt. shooting). Freuen's final game is tomorrow night.
Freuen are both often frustrated by
the team's youth.
"It's hard to communicate some
times to young players and young
teams that sometimes it they just
worked a little bit harder — gave just
a little bit more — how much more
they would enjoy it," VanDerveer

said.
Freuen agrees that "with younger
players, it's not always possible to un
derstand the whole pieture."
After another few weeks of
provding an example for her young
teammates, however. Freuen's l X)-
odd game Stanford career will be
over, and the last link to Stanford's
Final Four streak will be gone.
"I'm not focusing right now on the
fact that Saturday is my last home

game," Freuen said. "But I know that
as the game approaches, and when
my family and friends show up and 1
see the crowd, I'll get emotional."
But Freuen knows that, wherever
she may be next March, she can al
ways call Maples Pavilion home.
While she may have to turn in her
Stanford uniform, she can always
come back to practice and torment a
new generation with the Wideman to
Starbird to Freuen connection.
