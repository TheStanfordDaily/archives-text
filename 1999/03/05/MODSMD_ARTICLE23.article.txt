Last weekend, the Cardinal's 52-match home win

Family Tennis Center. The Cardinal's last home loss
had been to Texas on March 5, 1995.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. No. 12 Arizona State (4-2,

Today, Stanford (11-2 overall. 3-1 Pacific-10 Con

takes on Arizona at 1:30 pm. The Wildcats (4-5 over
all, 0-3 Pac-10) are ranked 24th and are led by
Monique Allegre and Lindsay Blau.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal will face an even tougher
challenge against Arizona State. The 12th-ranked Ari
zona State squad (4-2 overall, 1-2 Pac-10) is establish
ing itself as a force to be reckoned with.
Arizona State crushed rival Arizona 9-0 last week
end.
Last season, the Sun Devils fell to Stanford twice,
both times by the close score of 5-4. In Sheila Mclner
ney's 14 years as head coach for the Sun Devils. Ari
zona State has yet to beat tennis powerhouse Stanford.
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan is confident
about his squad's chances despite its
recent loss to Cal. After all, the team
trounced No. 6 Texas Feb. 26th.
"Arizona State is always very
good and Arizona is solid but they're
a little down this year," Brennan
said.
"Neither of the teams are ranked
in the top 10," Brennan said, 'it's
going to be nice to play some teams

we can beat, hopefully."
Freshman Marissa Irvin and ju
nior captain Teryn Ashley will play a
crucial role in the Cardinal's perfor
mance.
Irvin is currently ranked second
in the nation and boasts a 26-2
record. She recently won the
Women's National Intercollegiate
Tennis Championships, the third leg
of the collegiate grand slam.
Ashley, ranked ninth nationally,
has also played well lately and is now
24-4 on the season.
