### Travis Neal Contributing writer

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Yesterday: Stanford (17-11, 13-4)
82, No. 15 Oregon (23-5,14-3 Pacific
10 Conference) 73.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Oregon
State (11-15,3-14), 7:30 p.m.. Maples
Pavilion.

Oregon entered the game ranked
No. 15, hut left battered and bruised,
as Stanford (17-11, 13-4 Pacific 10
Conference) played aggressively
from the start, constantly disrupting
the How of the Duck's offense. The
win keeps Stanford in the running
for a Pac-10 title, as Oregon (23-5,
14-3) and UCLA both go into the
last game with three losses.
The win will also help the Cardi
nal when it comes to the NCAA
tournament, keeping them from fac
ing a long plane flight to the Eastern
Seaboard.
"1 hope it puts us in the top 16. but
realistically the NCAA Committee
will do what they want," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"I think we play in a conference
where game in and game out we've
had really good games. I feel our
conference has prepared us for the
tournament."
Donaphin came out more than
prepared, as did all the Cardinal
women, scoring the first four points,
one off a transition assist by junior
point guard Milena Flores.
Donaphin ended the game with a ca
reer-high tying 20 points on 7 for 7
shooting from the field.
After her initial four, she was
quiet for the rest of the first half, but
Stanford was able to spread the
points around like peanut butter, as
five other players scored at least four
points.
Even more impressive was the
Cardinal defensive effort, a nagging
monkey on the backs of the Ducks.
In the first half, Oregon had more
turnovers than assists, and the shot
clock was almost always under 10
seconds before the ball was shot.
"From the start they were really

overplaying the passing lanes, and
Flores was getting a lot of pressure
on the ball." said Oregon freshman
guard Shaquala Williams. "It was re
ally hard to make an easy pass. 1
wasn't changing sides of the floor ei
ther. so it made it even more diffi
cult."
For all the good defense, Stan
ford still found itself down 36-35
going into the locker room. The
Ducks had gone ahead at the 12-
minute mark, and although fresh
man forward Lindsey Yamasaki and
senior guard Regan Freuen hit a
combined three treys in a row, the
Cardinal could not do better than tie
the game.
"I thought we started the game
pretty aggressively; the problem was
we picked up some early fouls,"
VanDerveer said. "We really want-

Ed to go inside more, and I thought
Bethany got the ball better in the
second half. [Sophomore center]
Carolyn (Moos] got the ball better in
the second half. 1 thought we could
run. which we did better in the sec
ond half."
Stanford began the half with a 6-
0 run.and with the five-point lead at
the 18:09 mark, the Cardinal never
looked back. The Ducks came with
in one point early on, but after a 10-
1 run. Stanford's smallest lead was
seven.
"We made a conscious decision
at halftime to really work on things
we weren't doing or keep doing
things we were doing well." said
sophomore forward Sarah Dimson.
Donaphin kept up her strong

play throughout the second half,
grabbing all nine of her boards and
adding 14 points. She was a power
house inside, often getting the ball
off of her teammates misses and
putting it back in. On defense,
Donaphin was physically dominat
ing against 6-foot-5 junior center
Jenny Mowe, denying the Ducks any
easy baskets inside.
Freuen maintained her stellar
play, leading all Cardinal scorers
with 21 points, while Flores was get
ting the ball to her teammates with
precision, finishing with 11 assists.

On defense, Dimson was her old self,
getting in the passing lanes of Ore
gon and forcing the Ducks to take
some undesirable shots.
The Cardinal will end the season
on Saturday against Oregon State
(11-15, 3-14) in Freuen's final home
game. She is the only member grad
uating from the team, and her last
hurrah is a must-win for Stanford's
tournament seeding.
"It's my last home game and it's
going to be pretty weird," Freuen
said. "The biggger focus is just on the
fact that our team, after tonight's
game, wants to have a lot of momen
tum going into the tournament.
"It's not my last game. We've got
