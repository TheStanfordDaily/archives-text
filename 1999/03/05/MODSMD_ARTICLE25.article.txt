# Donaphin's banging on the boards paves Cardinal path
## Youth shines in upset win 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
Bethany Donaphin scored the
first time Stanford touched the ball
last night, the last time Stanford
touched the ball last night and
every time she took a shot in be
tween.
The freshman forward was a
perfect 7 for 7 against 15th-ranked
Oregon, tying her career high with
20 points, most of them coming on
layups against the Ducks' tough
post players.
The first words the grinning
Donaphin could find to describe
the evening were "awesome" and
"amazing," words that could de
scribe both her emotion and her
play.

"It was the most amazing feeling
to play well," said Donaphin, who
was also 6 of 8 from the free throw
line.
Fourteen of her points and all
nine of her rebounds came in the
second half, which she accom
plished while forcing Oregon's post
players into foul trouble.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer credited Donaphin for
much of the team's second-half
turnaround, coming back from one
down to win by 11.
"Bethany came out and brought
her game... and we played better
inside," VanDerveer said.
Five minutes into the second
half with Stanford up by six, point
guard Milena Flores got trapped on
the left baseline as the clock ran

down. As the shot clock expired,
she shot a turnaround 3-pointer
which bounced off the rim, but
Donaphin jumped up to grab the
rebound.
She then put the ball back up
for a layup, and with a high-five
from Flores and a cheer from the
crowd, Donaphin had firmly en
trenched the Cardinal in the lead.
If playing the top team in the Pa
cific 10 Conference wasn't enough.
Donaphin had additional incentive
to play well tonight: her mother.
"My mom's here all the way
from New York, and last time she
was here, I had the worst weekend
of basketball I've ever had," she
said. Donaphin's mother last visit
ed when Arizona and Arizona
State came to town in January,
when Donaphin scored a combined
four points in 32 minutes.
"When I played badly [against
Arizona and Arizona State], it put
additional pressure on my team
mates to do well, and not that they
can't do it, but I want to be a part of
things," she said.
And Donaphin has been in
creasingly part of things as the sea
son progresses, averaging eight
points a game heading into last
night's contest.
Beginning the year on the bench
and in the shadow of fellow fresh
man Lindsey Yamasaki, Donaphin
stepped up her game and took over
a starting role when the Pac-10 sea
son began.
This weekend against Oregon,
Donaphin pledged to play to her
fullest.
"My mentality was that I was
going to make sure that when 1
leave I don't regret anything," she
said.
"I have one more practice and
one more game, so there's no sense
in holding back."
