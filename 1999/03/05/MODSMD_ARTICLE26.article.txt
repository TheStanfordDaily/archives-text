# Gymnasts up against clock

### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
In a much-needed match, the men's gymnastics team
will be in Albuquerque, N.M., tomorrow to compete in
the Lobo Invitational. The meet, which will be hosted by
New Mexico, will also feature No. 6 ()klahoma. No. 14 Air
Force, No. I<S Minnesota and an unranked Arizona State
club team.
The l()th-ranked Cardinal (10-5) has only two meets
remaining: tomorrow's match and a home meet against
Oklahoma a week from tomorrow. With Regionals and
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships
coming up, it will need to capitalize on its two remaining
meets to gain points for Regional standings.

"Since we have so few matches remaining, we really
need the points for Regionals," said junior Ricardo An
drade.
Nevertheless, in order to pick up those crucial wins, the
Cardinal will have to get by an Oklahoma team that is
coming off a dramatic victory over No. l ) Nebraska.
Oklahoma gymnast Todd Bishop had a spectacular
meet, winning the pommel horse and parallel bar, and
scoring a perfect 10 on the horizontal bar. The perfect 10
was the first in Oklahoma men's gymnastics history.
Bishop will be a serious threat in this weekend's meet
because he is ranked first nationally in the pommel horse,
parallel bars and horizontal bars. The eighth-ranked gym
nast in the all-around category, Gabe Hansen also com
petes for the Sooners and will likely be a large factor in to
morrow's meet.
The Cardinal, by contrast, is coming off a loss to the
No. 20 Lobos of New Mexico in last weekend's UC-Santa
Barbara Invitational. That was the only meeting this sea
son between the two teams.
In a sport where the biggest rivals meet each other
many times during the season, this weekend's competitors
arc surprisingly unfamiliar. Apart from New Mexico, the
Cardinal has met only Air Force previously this season. In
their only meeting this year-at the BYIJ Invitational,
Stanford topped Air Force by more than three points.
