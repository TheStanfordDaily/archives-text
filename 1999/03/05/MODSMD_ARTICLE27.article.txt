# Volleyball hopes to regain feet vs. UA, Mercyhurst
## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
Since the start of the 1999 season,
the No. 14 Stanford men's volley
ball team (4-8. 3-8 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) has battled
some of the most prominent names
in NCAA collegiate volleyball.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Today: No. 14 Stanford (4-8. 3-8
Mountain Pacific Sports Conference)
vs. Arizona (19-4 National Intramur
al Recreation and Sports Associa
tion). 7 p.m.. Burnham Pavilion.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Mercy
hurst (5-8 Midwest Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association), 1 p.m.,
Burnham Pavilion.

This weekend will he a change of
pace.
The Cardinal will take on two
teams of relative anonymity in the
sport when it hosts the Arizona
Wildcats National Intramural
Recreation and Sports Association)
tonight in an exhibition game and
the Mercyhurst Lakers (5-8 Mid
west Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation) Sunday.
Although the Arizona Athletics
Department has earned NCAA
success in many sports, its volleyball
program is a club team, which
makes it more difficult to match
Stanford's level of notoriety. I n gen
eral. the caliber and intensity of club
teams lag behind varsity programs
because they do not have the struc
ture and scholarship opportunities
of varsity programs.
Arizona, however, is an excep
tion.
The Wildcats have used the lack
of NCAA regulations to develop a
successful club team which is com
petitive with some of the strongest
NCAA schools. Arizona defeated
UCLA and UC-Santa Barbara, two
highly-ranked teams, earlier this
season.
"We are in a unique situation for
a club team," said Arizona outside
hitter Eric Quanbeck.
"Because of a large alumni dona
tion, we were able to offer scholar
ships and get a lot of talented ath
letes who otherwise would have
gone to NCAA Division I schools,"
Quanbeck said.
Four former NCAA athletes

have transferred to compete for the
Wildcats including former Pacific
players Kevin Jones and Jeremy
Koop.
The lack of NCAA regulations
governing club teams have also en
abled the Wildcats to compete with
graduate students who have already
used their four years of collegiate el
igibility.
For Arizona, tonight's game is a
step up from its usual level of com
petition in the NIRSA.
"We can really benefit from
playing a varsity team," Quanbeck
said.

For Stanford, however, the
match has different significance.
"We look at this match as a
chance to play a couple of our play
ers who could benefit from compe
tition," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves.
After this digression from
NCAA competition, the Cardinal
will take on Mercyhurst College, a
member of the Midwest Intercolle
giate Volleyball Association
(MIVA), Sunday.
This match counts towards each
team's overall record, so Stanford
will start its usual personnel.
