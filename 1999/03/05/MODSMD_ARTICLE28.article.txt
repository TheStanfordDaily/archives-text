■ Today-Sunday: No. I Stanford (8-1,
3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) at La Jolla
Doubles Classic.

The tournament at La Jolla Coun
try Club consists of doubles teams
from various universities, junior col
leges and even some older pro play
ers. In years past, the college teams
have tended to be the favorites to
win. This weekend the Cardinal will
most likely have two of the top eight
seeds.
The two likely seeds are the Car
dinal's No. 1 and No. 2 teams of se
nior Ryan Woltersand freshman K.J.
Hippensteel as well as junior Geoff
Abrams and sophomore Alex Kim.
The other two teams going for the
Cardinal are sophomores Ali Ansari
and Scotty Scott as well as juniors
Vijay Seekhon and David Hauser.
"It's always a positive weekend
for us," said Stanford head coach
Dick Gould. "It comes after the first
half of our season and since the
matches do not count for rankings,
our players are able to relax, work on
their games, and have some fun.
"This year it comes at a perfect
time for us as we can definitely use
the work in our doubles. I just hope
we come (Hit better doubles players
than we go in."
The Cardinal has been struggling
a bit of late in their doubles, although
they performed very strongly in their

last match against Utah.
(iould says that the La Jolla tour
nament provides a good opportunity
for every team, because they are all
assured at least two matches.

"It's always fun down there,"
Wolters said, 'it is also a good time
for us to work on the things we need
to. without the intense pressure of
team matches."
