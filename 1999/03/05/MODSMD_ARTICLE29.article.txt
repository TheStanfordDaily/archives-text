# Card revisits Pacific loss
## 
### Gabby Duno Contributing writer 
Three weeks ago, the Stanford Softball team got
cheated out of revenge.
In what was supposed to be the second game of a
doubleheade.r, the Cardinal found itself rolling out
tarps and standing under umbrellas instead of playing
softball. Earlier in the day, the Cardinal suffered its
first loss of the season to Pacific in a grueling 11 -inning
game. This weekend, Stanford has been given the
chance to finally finish that doubleheader and avenge
the loss.

■ Today-Sunday: No. 9 Stanford (13-4) at Cal State-
Fullerton Easton Showcase.

For the third weekend in a row, the Stanford soft
ball team is packing its bags. This time, the No. 9 Car
dinal (13-4) travels south to Fullerton, Calif., for the
Cal State-Fullerton Easton Showcase Tournament.
In what may be the most heated game of the tour
nament for Stanford, the Cardinal will lead off against
rival Pacific. The game, a rematch of the Feb. 13 loss,
not only gives Stanford the opportunity to redress the
loss to Pacific, but also witness its improvement since
then. Surely, the Cardinal women are looking at this
game as a chance to finish out the doubleheader that
the rain took away.
Because of the round-robin style of the tourna
ment. where the team with the best record comes out
on top, the Cardinal is aware of the significance of win
ning every single game. Though the team has fared
well recently, the players are bothered by their incon
sistency.
"We can't drop games to teams we shouldn't lose
to." said senior pitcher Marcy Crouch.
Three of the Cardinal's four losses have come to
unranked teams. Consequently, the team has focused
in on beginning the tournament in strong fashion and
maintaining intensity throughout the weekend.
"We've been improving all season." Crouch said.
"This weekend, we are looking to play well and hope
fully go 6-0."
