## CSRE conference kicks off 
### Corinne Yates 
Today and tomorrow Stanford will host a large na
tional conference titled "Models for Diversity: The Uni
versity's Role in Shaping an Inclusive Society." Spon
sored by the Research Institute for Comparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity, this two-day conference will
bring together approximately 20 speakers and 300 at
tendees from 11 different universities.
Former Princeton University President William
Bowen, who is co-author of " The Shape of the River:
Long- Term Consequences of Considering Race in Col
lege and University Admissions" and president of the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, will give the keynote
speech today at 1 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
A panel featuring three senior university administra
tors will then respond to Bowen's speech. Following the
panel, a roundtable discussion moderated by Provost
Condoleezza Rice will be held.
"Bowen's book contains a lot of important data that
is not very well known," explains Martin Carnoy, pro
fessor of education and moderator of one of three dis
cussion panels for Saturday. "There are many people
who are not citing all of the information correctly be

cause of lack of research. We are hoping that this con
ference will raise awareness, especially at the university
level."
On Saturday the conference will begin at 9 a.m. with
an address by Nicholas Lemann, a national correspon
dent and contributing editor for "Atlantic Monthly."
Three panels led by faculty from several universities will
follow. Nancy Cantor, provost of the University of
Michigan, will give the closing address at 4:30 p.m.
Dorothy Steele, associate director of the Research
Institute of CSRE, said, "Diversity is not a single issue
but a way of living together as a community. It touches
everything we do."
Carnoy said he believes that Stanford is an appropri
ate place to hold this event. "You don't have to con
vince anyone here that diversity is important," he ex
plained.
Steele agreed that Stanford, as a "primer university"
plays an im, ortant role as a model for the shaping of a
diverse society. "Stanford doesn't have all of the an
swers, but it is striving toward them."
Admission to the conference is free for Stanford fac
ulty and staff and all university students. For all others,
a $25 general admission fee can be paid at the door.
