# Baseball faces blazing-hot ASU
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
The new Pacific 10 baseball con
ference may not be as tough as the
old Six-Pac. But after looking at
Stanford's recent schedule, it is diffi
cult to see a way to toughen it up.
Last weekend, the Cardinal trav
eled to Los Angeles to face defend
ing national champion USC in a

three-game series that did not count
in conference standings. Stanford
(12-6) fared well, coming away with
two wins in three games.
But there is no joy in Palo Alto
this weekend, because hot-hitting
Arizona State, last year's runner-up
in the College World Series, travels
to Sunken Diamond to open the
Pac-1() season.
The eighth-ranked Sun Devils

have only 14 players back from last
year's successful squad, but have
opened the season at a good pace.
Despite being swept on the road by
No. 1 Florida State in three early
February games, the young team has
racked up a 19-5 record.
Arizona State has been especially
good at the plate, hitting a blistering
.366 combined. Six players are bat
ting above .4(XJ, while only four are
below ,3(X).

The sixth-ranked Cardinal has
put up decidedly less impressive
numbers. As a team, Stanford is only
hitting .260 and only two players
with many at-bats are above .300.
"We're playing quality teams so
that means we're facing pretty good
pitching," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "But I still think
we're not anywhere near our capa
bilities with the bat."
Despite the shabby statistics,
Stanford has somehow found a way
to win most of its games. The pitch
ing has been good, stellar at times,
and the defense has been consistent.
"I've been pleased with our
record, considering our batting aver
age," Marquess said. "I've been
pleased with our ability to win."
That ability will be tested this
weekend.
Arizona State has not played an
incredibly hard non-conference
schedule, other than its series
against the Seminoles.
But while Stanford lost to Neva
da 7-4 Tuesday and played fairly

close games with Saint Mary's and
Sacramento State, the Sun Devils
have beaten up on their easy non
conference foes.
Arizona State outscored
Brigham Young, Grand Canyon,
Hawaii-Hilo, Howard and Utah 218-
32 combined.
Senior Andrew Beinbrink and ju
nior Willie Bloomquist lead the
team in almost every category. Bein
brink is hitting .442 with a team-lead
ing five home runs, 11 doubles and
36 RBIs. Bloomquist is hitting .417
with a team-leading four triples, 24
walks and 39 runs.
The speed of the Sun Devils wor
ries Marquess as much as anything.
Bloomquist, who led the Six-Pac in
stolen bases last year, has 16 stolen
bases this season in 18 attempts. But
he is not alone. Junior Jay Sitzman
leads the team with 20, and 11 others
have at least one.
"They put a lot of pressure on
you; they've got a lot of stolen
bases," Marquess said. "They've got
some power and have been getting
good pitching. They'll be one of the
best teams in the conference. This
weekend will be difficult."
Sophomore right-hander Jason
Young (4-1, 2.25 ERA) will try to
start the weekend out right for the
Cardinal tonight against junior left
hander Will Waldrip (5-1, 2.06).
Young has 48 strikeouts in 44 in
nings and is holding opposing bat
ters to a .169 average.
"He pitched great in the fall and
all the way through," Marquess said.
"He had one bad inning against Cal-
State Fullerton, but otherwise he's
been outstanding."
Stanford sophomore right-han
der Justin Wayne (2-1,5.91) will go
tomorrow afternoon against fresh
man left-hander Jon Switzer (4-1,
3.97). Either freshman right-hander
Brian Sager (1-0. 5.54) or freshman
left-hander Mike Gosling (1-1,2.84)
will take the mound for the Cardinal
Sunday against sophomore right
hander Chad Pennington (4-2,2.84).

Senior Josh Hochgesang will get a chance to do more than throw
around when Arizona State comes to Sunken Diamond this weekend.
The Cardinal defense will be tested by ASU's .366 team average.
