President Gerhard Casper devoted the majority of
yesterdays Faculty Senate meeting to discussing the fac
ulty housing crisis.
Both the availability and affordability of housing for
faculty was of foremost concern to everyone who spoke.
"The housing problems faced by our faculty and stu
dents are part of a much larger housing shortage in the
Bay Area," said Geoffrey Cox, vice provost and dean for
institutional planning and operations. "Stanford cannot
solve this problem on its own. but it can use its resources
to help ameliorate the situation."
Cox has outlined three proposals, out of which one
will be chosen to serve as a short-term solution to the fac
ulty housing crunch. Each proposal includes the building
of 36 moderately sized housing units at sites on Dolores
Street, Mayfield Avenue, Gerona / Junipero Serra
Boulevard, and Frenchman's Triangle. The options vary
in the density of development for each site.
