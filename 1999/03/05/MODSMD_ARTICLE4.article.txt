# Fac Sen debates housing

### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
President Gerhard Casper devoted the majority of
yesterdays Faculty Senate meeting to discussing the fac
ulty housing crisis.
Both the availability and affordability of housing for
faculty was of foremost concern to everyone who spoke.
"The housing problems faced by our faculty and stu
dents are part of a much larger housing shortage in the
Bay Area," said Geoffrey Cox, vice provost and dean for
institutional planning and operations. "Stanford cannot
solve this problem on its own. but it can use its resources
to help ameliorate the situation."
Cox has outlined three proposals, out of which one
will be chosen to serve as a short-term solution to the fac
ulty housing crunch. Each proposal includes the building
of 36 moderately sized housing units at sites on Dolores
Street, Mayfield Avenue, Gerona / Junipero Serra
Boulevard, and Frenchman's Triangle. The options vary
in the density of development for each site.
These particular sites are being
proposed for development because
they are infill sites. Infill sites avoid
sprawl, maximize use of existing in
frastructure and reduce traffic con
gestion by locating housing on transit
routes or within walking or biking
distance of campus.
The University faces opposition
to this proposal from the Stanford
Campus Residential Leaseholders.

Prof. Jim Sweeney, though not a sen
ate member, was granted permission
to speak on the leaseholders' behalf
at the meeting.
"There's a fundamental sense that
[the leaseholders] are not going to be
considered in the final decision," he
said.
The group emphasized that it is
not against housing, but rather for re
sponsible planning. It wants the ad
ministration to suspend work on the
infill developments until Stanford in
vestigates the costs and benefits of
the full range of alternative options,

reports these results, polls the faculty
and staff concerning these alterna
tives and strengthens the role of cam
pus residents in the governance of
their community.
Casper emphasized that residen
tial leases do not have the right to de
termine the use of remaining land.
He said that the concerns of lease
holders must be weighed against the
pressing needs of schools and depart
ments to rejuvenate their faculties
and the importance that campus
housing plays in that process.
Salaries and benefits offered by
Stanford are competitive on a nation
al scale, but the lack of affordable

housing on or near campus makes it
increasingly difficult to attract top
candidates.
The new infill units would attempt
to alleviate this problem by building
smaller homes on smaller parcels of
land at lower prices than most hous
ing currently available.
"The proposed homes would be a
significant addition to our stock of
moderately priced housing - a critical
need in faculty recruitment," Casper
said. "Each new unit enables one
more faculty family to live on cam
pus, and for that family - and that fac
ulty member's school and depart
ment — the gain is great."
