# Grad school apps decline
## 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
Following a period of growth in the early '90s, the
nation has seen a decline in the numbers of students
applying to doctoral programs. Stanford is also fol
lowing this trend, most notably in the humanities.
According to an article in the Feb. 26 Chronicle of
Higher Education, "Applications to graduate pro
grams began declining in 1995, after nearly a decade
of growth, according to the Council of Graduate
Schools. The Council's data show that graduate en
rollment rose steadily from '86 to '92, stagnated until
'96, and has dropped since then."
At Stanford, doctorate applications in the humani
ties reached a high in 1991, with 1,903 applicants. Ap
plications have declined steadily since then,except for
a slight rise from 1993 to 1994.
In 1998 there were 1,376 applicants, a 28 percent
decline from 1991.
Kathleen Neils Conzen, a professor and chair of
the History Department at the University of Chicago,
attempted to explain the decline.
"Graduate departments had a boom in the early
'90s, when there were fewer good jobs for people with
[bachelor's degrees], and it looked
like the academic market might
open up," Conzen told the Chroni
cle for Higher Education. "Now it
is a booming market for BA's, and
it's pretty clear the academic mar
ket is not going to open up."
Rosemary Leute, an administra
tive associate in the Philosophy De
partment, said that her department
has had 140 applicants for the doc
toral program during the past cou
ple of years, down from 185 "when
the market [for B.A.'s] wasn't as
good."
Not all humanities departments
have experienced the trend of de
clining applications. The Compara
tive Literature Department had the
highest number of applicants ever
this year, according to Prof. Jo
hannes Gumbrecht, who is in

volved in graduate admissions for
the department. "This is atypical...
. I've heard this is not true for other
departments."
Gumbrecht noted that although
there seems to be an overall trend
of declining applications to doctor
al programs at Stanford this is not
considered a crisis in the humani
ties.
Prof. Lan Morris, chair of the
Classics Department, said his de
partment's experience hasn't ex
actly followed the national trend ei
ther.
"The department saw a serious
decline — perhaps one-third — in
the early '90s, but the applications
increased in the mid-'9os back up to
the late 1980s level. In 1997-98
there was a decline of something
like 20 percent, but this year [appli
cations] held steady at about the
same level as 1997-98."
Asst. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Veronica Holeton said

that because the quality of students
applying hasn't decreased there is
little worry within the department
"The pools are very strong this
year — as strong as last year," she
said.
Other areas of study at Stanford
have also experienced shifts in ap
plication numbers.
"We do notice that applications
have gone down in all of the disci
plines," Holeton said.
The number of applications in
the natural and physical sciences in
the past decade hit a high point in
1991, with 1,298. They dropped
until reaching 1,185, the low point,
in 1995. However, over the past
three years they rose to 1,392, a 7
percent increase from 1991.
The social sciences experienced
an increase in applications until
1994, when the number peaked at
1520. However, they have dropped
since then, with 1221 students ap
plying in 1998.
