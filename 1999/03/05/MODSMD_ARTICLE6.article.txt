# County planners move to add development restrictions
## 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
The Santa Clara County Planning
Commission voted unanimously yes
terday to accept staff recommenda
tions that a "combined Community
Plan / General Use Permit ap
proach" be used for future Stanford
land use agreements with the county.
Current Stanford development is
governed by a general use permit,
which places a limit on the number of
square feet Stanford facilities may oc
cupy but extends few limitations on
the use of that area.
County staff recommended that
the Board of Supervisors, which has
yet to approve the recommendations,
prepare a "community plan" to be
considered along with a general land
use permit. The University's existing
land use permit is expected to be ex

hausted in 2(X)1. Stanford is in the
preliminary stages of organizing a re
quest for a new land use entitlement.
The new plan would serve as an
other level of policy, forcing the
county to formally consider how Palo
Alto and other cities are affected by
University development in unincor
porated Santa Clara Country.
"This is the first step in determin
ing the process of a process," said
County Supervisor Joe Simitian, not
ing that several meeting are planned
for discussion before approving the
proposal. He said approval could
happen no sooner than March 23.
Already any University develop
ment in Palo Alto must be reviewed
by city officials. But residents have
expressed concern that the Universi
ty lacks a comprehensive plan when
considering land development.
Simitian characterized relations

between the University and Palo
Alto as "regrettably polarized."
He said the recommendations
were based on the county's desire to
not accept development contracts on
a "piecemeal" basis, but rather con
sider development from a long
range, comprehensive point of view.
"Despite its uniqueness, Stanford
is a land use applicant like any other,"
he said. "It has rights and responsibil
ities."
Other recommendations involved
notifying leaseholders about nearby
projects and consideration of specific
zoning in any future land agreements
with Stanford. The report also rec
ommended that several forums be
held on major land development is
sues.
Simitian said that a town hall
meeting was scheduled for March 16
to discuss the issue.
