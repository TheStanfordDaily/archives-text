Ever wondered what Dean of
Students Marc Wais would look like
in a chefs hat? Ever wanted to see
Provost Condoleezza Rice serve
coffee?
The first annual Midnight Break
fast will take place Monday from
11:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. More than 30
members of Stanford's faculty and
staff will be serving students a free
breakfast to kick off the beginning
of Dead Week.
The reason for putting together
this event is to "send a message to
students that the University cares
about them and to give students the
opportunity to meet with high pro
file administrators in an informal

and fun setting," Dean of Students
Marc Wais said.
Four dining halls will be open
and serving breakfast. Graduate
students will be served at the Tresid
der Dining Room and at Arbuckle
Lounge in the Graduate School of
Business. Undergraduates will be
served at Florence Moore and East
Wilbur dining halls. Admission is
free, but students must pick up tick
ets either today or Monday from 11
a.m. to 1 p.m. in White Plaza on a
first-come, first-served basis.
ASSU President Maren Norton
has played a significant role in
putting together the Midnight
Breakfast. She views the event as "a
way to show that we're all part of a
community and that students are an

integral part of the community."
The opportunity for students to
see faculty and staff members serve
thern food late at night will be quite
an unusual experience, Wais said.
According to Norton, the hope
of participating faculty and staff is to
provide a comfortable environment
in which students can get to know
their "servers" and bring the Stan
ford community together in a fun,
relaxed setting.
"The Midnight Breakfast will be
a wonderful opportunity to interact
with and learn from students," Vice
Provost James Montoya said. He
anticipates a fun time and said he is
excited at the prospect of serving
coffee to masses of students late at
night.
