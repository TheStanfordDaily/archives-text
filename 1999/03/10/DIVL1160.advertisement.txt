In all other residences, Stanford provides
each student with access to low-cost, in
room SUNet connections via Ethernet —
connections that are far faster than any
modem can achieve. Eventually, all
student residences will provide this"port
per-pillow" Ethernet access.

On Monday, March 22, Stanford's
14Kbps dial-in service will be removed
from service.
As announced in Autumn Quarter,the
higher-speed Central Modem Pool at
(650) 325-1010 will replace 498-1440,
becoming the University's only central
dial-in modem service.
The 325-1010 dial-in service supports
users with modems from 9600 bps
(V.32) up to the"s6K"type and has the
capacity to support many more calls
at once than its predecessor.
For more information about accessing
the Central Modem Pool, see the panel
