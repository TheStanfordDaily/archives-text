1999 Rebele Journalism Internships
Work at a weekly newspaper in California and earn a reporter's
salary! Students can write and report the news, or work in advertising,
circulation, or production. Internships generally last about 12 weeks.
Here are some comments from past interns:
Intern for the San Francisco Business Times
"Instead of making copies and faxing paper, 1 had the opportunity to pitch
and write several stories. The editors and reporters at the paper treated me
as a regular staff member... As a result, I have at least 10 clips and
business writing experience which undoubtedly helped me land my
current job as a staff writer for a monthly marketing magazine
Editor of the Milpitas Post
"Our intern was most interested in sports reporting, so we used her as
our lead sports writer covering local teams. She also covered general
assignment, and handled several specialty sections for all three of
our papers."
Pick up an information sheet at Building 120, Room 453 on
the fourth floor.

Coordinator at 725-2239.
Deadline: March 31
