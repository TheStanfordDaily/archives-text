FROSH!
In response to student feedback, assignments to the new Freshman/Sophomore College
will be made through the Draw, not through a spearate application process as earlier
indicated. You will simply need to obtain a "priority" (in spring quarter) for the Draw.
Three informaiton sessions will be held in spring quarter. Come hear more:
• April sth, 6:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. — Branner Lounge
• April 7th, 6:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. — Casa Zapata Lounge
• April 14th, 6:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. — Eucalypto Lounge
Here are some answers to the questions you have asked about the
Freshman/Sophomore College:
The Freshman/Sophomore College is a residence for approximately 90 freshmen and 90
sophomores who are interested in broad intellectual exploration of the liberal arts and
sciences. As the residential complement to Stanford Introductory Studies (SIS), the
College connects residential life with the mentoring and academic activities offered
through SIS courses. Programs will include: on-location seminars which begin or con
clude with dinner, oral communication workshops, study groups oranized around com
mon courses, and faculty presentations of scholarship and research over dinner at the
Dean's house, located across the street from the College.
The Freshman/Sophomore is NOT Sophomore College. Sophomore College (also an
SIS program) is a three-week program which takes place before school starts, while the
College is a year-long residential experience.
The College is NOT a "sophomore SLE". The College focuses on helping students
navigate the University's resources in supporting students' academic exploration. There
will be some courses taught on-location, but they will be open to all freshmen and
sophomores and are not required of each resident (though they will be given priority in
signing-up for the class).
The atmosphere of the College will be like that of places where other freshmen and
sophomores live: energetic and lively. The College will be based in Schiff and Adams
Houses; upper-class students will live in Potter and Robinson. The usual social and
cultural activities which occur in other houses will, of course, take place in the College
as well.
