Have you been traumatized?
• By a terrible accident, being attacked, seeing someone badly hurt, being threatened
with a weapon, or any other experience that made you feel terrified, helpless, or
horrified:
• Are you bothered by losing your temper, feeling irritable, upsetting memories,
nightmares, trouble falling asleep, feeling nervous or jumpy, and feeling numb.
At the Palo Alto National Center for Posttraumatic Stresc Disorder we are studying
investigational medications for the treatment of PTSD. If you are interested, please call
(650) 493-5000 ext 22812.
