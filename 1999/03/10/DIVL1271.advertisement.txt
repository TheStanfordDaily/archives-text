If finals are too easy for you and you've got tons of free time, do check out this tour that's coming through San Francisco on Monday.
Dub Narcotic Sound System: So this is what happens when punk rock goes funk ... featuring Calvin Johnson (the deep-throated co-founder of Olympia, Wash.-based
K Records and member of seminal indie band Beat Happening), Brian Weber, Chris Sutton and Heather Dunn (of the Bangs, Lois, Tiger Trap) on drums.
ICU: Trip-hoppy shakedown with Aaron Hartman on upright bass, Michiko Swiggs on keyboards and electro-board, K.O. on turntables and everything else. They have
a new record — "chotto matte a moment!" — out on K.
Kicking Giant: In the early '90s this band made the most energetic, innovative and exciting "love-rock" in America. Guitar genius and accomplished graphic designer
Tae Won Yu returns with a new drummer in this latest incarnation (original drummer Rachel Carnes has gone on to other projects like The Need and Mocket).
Miranda July: Performance-artist-movie-queen-superstar Miranda July ignites the stage with her unique, idiosyncratic brand of theatrics.
