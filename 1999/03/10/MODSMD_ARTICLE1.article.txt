-1 Swedish businessman and humanist Peter
Wallenberg presented a $15 million grant to the
University at a press conference yesterday to es
tablish the Wallenberg Global Learning Center, a
state-of-the-art learning laboratory at Stanford
University.
The gift was presented on behalf of the Knut
and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Mari
anne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation of Swe
den and is the largest single award the foundations
have given.
The Center will aim to extend the boundaries
of national universities into a realm of global
learning by using technology to facilitate academ
ic exchanges between students, teachers and re
searchers all around the world.
The university of the future will be a "forum
without borders," according to IJniversitv Presi

dent Gerhard Casper.
Director of the Stanford Learning Lab and
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Larry Leifer will
lead the Stanford professors who use Wallenberg
Hall as a base to collaborate with Swedish col
leagues. They will work to develop a network of
teaching and learning laboratories around the
world. Discussions have already begun with uni
versities in Norway, the Netherlands. Switzer
land, Germany and Japan.
Wallenberg Hall is slated to be completed in
2(K)1 and will take the place of the Department of
Political Science in Building 160 after it is retrofit

Larry Friedlander, a teaching professor of Eng

tech gadgetry similar to those found in the lab
classrooms already on campus. Wallenberg class

rooms will be user-friendly — imagine comput
ers for each student built into their desks — and
will have the capacity to communicate with peo
ple similarly equipped anywhere in the world, he
said.
Plans call for the Wallenberg Global Learning
Center to be permanently unfinished, constantly
undergoing modifications and updates. I'he Reg
istrar's Office will use the classrooms as proto
types for other integrated classrooms around
campus. According to Friedlander, courses that
