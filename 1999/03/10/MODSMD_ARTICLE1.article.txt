# Swede gives $15M for learning lab
## 
### Tienlon Ho Staff writer 
-1 Swedish businessman and humanist Peter
Wallenberg presented a $15 million grant to the
University at a press conference yesterday to es
tablish the Wallenberg Global Learning Center, a
state-of-the-art learning laboratory at Stanford
University.
The gift was presented on behalf of the Knut
and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Mari
anne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation of Swe
den and is the largest single award the foundations
have given.
The Center will aim to extend the boundaries
of national universities into a realm of global
learning by using technology to facilitate academ
ic exchanges between students, teachers and re
searchers all around the world.
The university of the future will be a "forum
without borders," according to IJniversitv Presi

dent Gerhard Casper.
Director of the Stanford Learning Lab and
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Larry Leifer will
lead the Stanford professors who use Wallenberg
Hall as a base to collaborate with Swedish col
leagues. They will work to develop a network of
teaching and learning laboratories around the
world. Discussions have already begun with uni
versities in Norway, the Netherlands. Switzer
land, Germany and Japan.
Wallenberg Hall is slated to be completed in
2(K)1 and will take the place of the Department of
Political Science in Building 160 after it is retrofit
ted. The Political Science Department will move
to its permanent location in Encina Hall.
Although exact details are still in develop
ment, Co-Director of the Stanford Learning Lab
Larry Friedlander, a teaching professor of Eng
lish. said that Wallenberg Hall will house high
tech gadgetry similar to those found in the lab
classrooms already on campus. Wallenberg class

rooms will be user-friendly — imagine comput
ers for each student built into their desks — and
will have the capacity to communicate with peo
ple similarly equipped anywhere in the world, he
said.
Plans call for the Wallenberg Global Learning
Center to be permanently unfinished, constantly
undergoing modifications and updates. I'he Reg
istrar's Office will use the classrooms as proto
types for other integrated classrooms around
campus. According to Friedlander, courses that

integrate technology and student ex
change are already popular. The lab
classroom in Building 300, for exam
ple, is the most heavily booked class
room on campus.
The gift represents the fledgling
connection between Stanford and
Sweden, a connection borne by
Stanford Nobel laureates research
ing in Sweden and business ex
changes between the Silicon Valley
and Swedish industries. Stanford
has already held joint real-time sem
inars with the Royal Institute of
Technology in Stockholm.
In addition to fostering further
relations between the two nations,
the motivation behind the founda
tions' gift. Wallenberg said, is that,
while research and industry have
continually pushed the envelope of
development, teaching has re
mained stagnant. Yet it is undeni
able that education and teaching are
the indicators of a nation's growth
and well-being, he said.
No strangers to altruism, the
Wallenberg family played a hand in
saving several troubled Swedish
businesses during the Great Depres
sion. and cousin Raon 1 saved
1 (K).(KK) Jews from the gas chambers
while stationed in Hungary during
World War 11.
Stanford Learning Lab projects
have already included integrated
learning in classes ranging from In
troduction to the Humanities to
seminars in Human Biology and
classes offered throunh the Over

seas Studies Program.
Courses taught through the Stan
ford Learning Lab feature "Web
based discovery environments,"
"collaboration tools" and "rapid
feedback diagnostics" that boil
down to assignments involving
newsgroups, real-time chats and
video conferencing.
In addition to offering new fo
rums for discussion, students take
tests differently too. For instance
students provide reasons for select
ing particular answers. A computer
quickly tabulates the responses, al
lowing instructors to learn individ
ual students' deficiencies and some
times about their own.
Casper described inaugural ef
forts to integrate technology with
education as in many ways "miracu
lous" but still a long way from per
fect. "A lot of the learning on the
Web is actually old-fashioned." he
said, "nothing more than talking
heads."
With the Wallenberg Center,
however, this method of teaching
and learning will move to another
level. The hope is to extend its re
sources to all departments at Stan
ford and to institutions around the
world.
Wallenberg explained, "The task
is to be effective, inspiring and stim
ulating by providing new learning
situations."
Friedlander said the goal of the
Center is not to advocate virtual
learning alone but to demonstrate
that it adds a meaningful perspec
tive. A hybrid approach, he said, can
allow students to think and share ex
periences with more people.
