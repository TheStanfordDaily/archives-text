Nabisco to sell tobacco business
NEW YORK (AP) — RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food-and
tobacco conglomerate whose brands include Camels and Winstons,
Oreo cookies and Ritz. crackers, is getting out of the cigarette business.
RJR said yesterday it will sell its international tobacco business to
Japan's biggest tobacco company for $7.8 billion and spin off its
domestic tobacco operations as a separate company.
The moves come amid rising legal challenges to cigarettes and
falling numbers of U.S. smokers — something tobacco opponents
were quick to note.
"The tobacco industry is in deep trouble," said Ahron Leichtman,
executive director of Citizens for a Tobacco-Free Society.
RJR said its aim is merely to help the cigarette and food companies
achieve greater success as separate entities.
The $17 billion conglomerate has been under pressure for several
years from major stockholders to separate its food and tobacco busi
nesses because the tobacco is considered a drag on RJR's stock. Some
investors won't put their money in any company that has tobacco
holdings, out of either opposition to smoking or fear that lawsuits will
hurt profits.
The breakup doesn't entirely solve the problem, because RJR can
be hit with tobacco lawsuits even after it has shed its cigarette busi
ness.
Carl Icahn, the corporate raider who holds 7.7 percent of RJR
stock, had threatened to launch a fight for control of the board of
directors to force a separation. He did not return calls for comment
yesterday.
His 25 million shares grew in value slightly as RJR Nabisco stock
rose 12 1/2 cents to $28.75 a share in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. Nabisco Holdings — which trades as a separate stock even
though RJ R owns 80.6 percent of it — closed up 31 1/4 cents at $44.93
3/4 a share.
RJR's international tobacco business is a distant third to Philip
Morris Cos. and British-American Tobacco, and its earnings have fall
en amid financial turmoil in its key Russian and Asian markets. It will
be sold to the Japan Tobacco Co.
"The deal will allow us to secure a base for future growth overseas
and establish us as a global player," Japan Tobacco said in a state
ment.
After the sale, RJR will spin off its domestic tobacco operations to
RJR shareholders. The tobacco business will revert to its old name —
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. — and retain its headquarters in Winston-
Salem, N.C.
Creatine may help muscular dystrophy
WASHINGTON (AP) — A dietary supplement that athletes use
to build muscle might offer help to patients whose muscles are wast
ing away from such diseases as muscular dystrophy, a new study sug
gests. _ „ _
Taking very large daik-,*uerntid4«!: increase the
strength of patients' muscles by about 10 percent, concludes the small
study published yesterday in the journal Neurology.
Independent scientists urged caution. The study was far too small
and too short, lasting only a few weeks, to show if creatine offers last
ing benefit or if high doses for long periods can cause side effects.
Plus, doctors actually tried to treat similar neuromuscular diseases
with creatine in the 19505, and it failed, said Dr. Audrey Penn of the
National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke. So creatine
was abandoned.
But those 1950s studies only looked at whether creatine could cure
or slow the disease, not if it had a smaller benefit like improving mus
cle strength and thus quality of life. Dr. Leon Charash of the Muscu
lar Dystrophy Association said. The new study suggests creatine might
do that, so Charash's association asked researchers yesterday to start
larger studies quickly and promised to help pay for them.
Creatine is an amino acid found naturally in healthy muscles. It has
become one of the biggest-selling dietary supplements, thanks to ath
letes who hope it will build muscles.
There are no data that confirm the safely of taking extra creatine
for long periods or at high doses, because the government allows
dietary supplements to sell largely unregulated. Some athletes have
reported muscle cramps, muscle tears and dehydration.
Separate research published last week in Nature Medicine already
had patients of Lou Gehrig's disease excited. It was only a study in
rodents, but it suggested that creatine might be more potent than the
only prescription therapy for the disease, a killer neurological disorder
that also attacks muscles.
