# Ecuador declares state of emergency

QUITO, Ecuador (AP) â€” Pres
ident Jamil Mahuad declared a 60-
day state of emergency in Ecuador
yesterday amid a deep financial cri
sis and a looming nationwide strike
by powerful leftist-led unions.
The decree allows the govern
ment to use the military to protect
oil and electricity installations, limit
public meetings and movement and
order strikers back to work.
In a government news release
Mahuad also announced that the
unscheduled banking holidays he
had declared for yesterday and
Monday to protect Ecuador's tum
bling currency and bank deposits
would be extended through tomor
row.
Government officials said that
tomorrow they may announce an
economic plan to rescue this tiny
Andean nation's economy, which
saw its currency, the sucre, lose a
quarter of its value last week.
"Since several sectors have
responded to the economic crisis
with illegal work stoppages and
calls for strikes that have a serious
destabilizing effect, the govern
ment has decreed a national state
of emergency," Interior Minister
Vladimiro Alvarez said, quoting
the decree.
Ecuador's largest labor federa
tion has called a national strike for
today and tomorrow to protest
Mahuad's economic reforms, which
have ended fuel subsidies and
caused prices to soar.
State energy workers have

threatened to block the supply of
oil and electricity if Congress
approves a bill to cut public spend
ing. Protesting Indian groups have
already started blocking roads in
northern Ecuador.
The Defense Ministry today
issued a communique denying alle
gations of discontent within the
armed forces over the govern
ment's response to the economic
crisis.
Ecuador's bankers have charged
that Mahuad was losing control of
the economy after he ordered the
unscheduled bank holidays.
"At this moment, the govern
ment has lost control of the country
and must retake control," said Car
los Larreategui, president of
Ecuador's Association of Private
Banks. "If it doesn't attack the fun
damental problems, it would be a
catastrophe."
Business leaders accuse Mahuad
of moving too slowly to confront
the crisis since he took office in
August.
Ecuador, with a population of 12
million, is embroiled in its worst
economic crisis in the last 20 years
due to $2.6 billion in damage from
El Nino-powered floods and mud
slides last year and falling prices of
its main export, oil.
Economic growth has fallen to
near zero, inflation is running near
50 percent and the budget deficit
stands at $1.2 billion.
The government had been
forced to sell dollars in recent

months to protect the value of the
sucre, draining its scant foreign
reserves. On Feb. 12, it abandoned
its trading band and allowed the
sucre to float freely.
But the sucre plunged as

investors have begun to doubt
Mahuad's ability to overcome polit
ical opposition and implement the
drastic austerity measures experts
say Ecuador's statist economy
needs.
