# Fatty diet and breast cancer unrelated
## New study finds no evidence that a low-fat diet prevents breast cancer 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Contradicting current
medical theories, a 14-year study of nearly
89,(KK) women found no evidence that a high
fat diet promotes breast cancer or that a low
fat diet protects against it.
Experts were quick to note that a low-fat
diet is still good for the heart and other aspects
of health. They said the study indicates a need
to look more carefully at how diet may affect
the risk of breast cancer.
"We should just accept that good scientists
can't tell you yet what to eat to minimize your
breast-cancer risk," said Dr. John A. Glaspy of
UCLA, who was not involved in the research.
The Harvard study was published in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
Doctors have theorized that eating lots of
fat increases breast-cancer risk. They have
based their thinking on animal studies,
international comparisons and studies of
women who developed breast cancer and
women who didn't.
Others have suggested that the key is the
type of fat consumed, rather than the amount;
that fish oil offers some protection from breast
cancer: or that contaminants stored in fat trig
ger breast cancer.
The new study tracked K8,795 women in the
continuing Nurses' Health Study. The women,

ages 30 to 55, completed detailed question
naires about their eating habits every four
years from 1980 to 1994.
Researchers compared the diets of the
women without breast cancer and the 2,956
women whose breast cancer was discovered
during the course of the study.
Breast cancer was found to be no more
common among women who ate lots of fat, or
among those who ate a large proportion of
animal fat, polyunsaturated fat (vegetable fat)
or trans-unsaturated fat (partially hydrogenat
ed oils, such as those used in margarine and to
cook doughnuts and french fries).
Nor was breast cancer any less common in
women who got a high proportion of their fats
from fish oil or who got less than 20 percent of
their total calories from fat.
"Our research indicates it's highly unlike
ly that women who consume a low-fat diet
i're protected against breast cancer," said the
study's lead author, Dr. Michelle D. Holmes,
an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medi
cal School and Brigham and Women's Hos
pital in Boston. "Equally, it appears a high
fat diet also poses no increased risk for the
disease."
Most surprisingly, women who ate the least
fat appeared to have a 15 percent higher rate

of breast cancer, the researchers said. But
Holmes said she's not ready to conclude that a
low-fat diet increases breast cancer risk,
because the finding was based on fewer titan
I,(XX) women who ate less than 20 percent of
calories as fat.
UCLA's Glaspy said fat intake may need to
be very low — as little as 10 percent of total
calories — to reduce breast-cancer risk.
He also noted that only some kinds of fish
oil have appeared beneficial in previous stud
ies. The new study did not distinguish between
types.
Nor did it run long enough to explore the
possibility that dietary effects may take longer
than 14 years to emerge, he said. Glaspy
believes that diet interacts with environmental
factors in subtler ways than scientists have
been able to identify.
The theory that dietary fat is linked to
breast cancer arose from the observation that
breast-cancer rates are far lower in traditional
Asian cultures, where diets are generally low
in fat.
Compared with women in Western cul
tures, traditional Asian women start menstru
ating later, give birth at a younger age and gain
far less weight in adulthood — all factors that
decrease breast-cancer risk. Holmes noted.
