# Scientist suspected of espionage
## 
### 
; WASHINGTON (AP) — In a grow
ing national security flap, Republican
■ lawmakers demanded yesterday that the
■ Clinton administration explain why a
- nuclear weapons lab scientist kept his job
• for nearly three years while under investi
gation for espionage.
The Senate Intelligence Committee
will have a closed-door hearing next week
to ask top administration officials, includ
ing Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and
FBI Director Louis Freeh, about the espi
onage investigation involving the scientist
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
A native of Taiwan, Wee Ho Lee, who
, is in his 50s. had worked at the prestigious
• weapons research laboratory in New
Mexico for a dozen years or more before
being dismissed on Monday at Richard
son's direction.
While Lee has not been charged with
► any crime, nor arrested, he has been the
prime suspect in a three-year investiga
tion into allegations that China obtained
sensitive nuclear weapons design infor
• mation from Los Alamos in the 1980s.
The case and the way the investigation
was handled has fueled a longstanding
controversy over the Clinton administra
tion's policies on trade and technology
transfers to China, and whether those
"policies might compromise national secu

rity.
It also has raised new questions about
an administration openness policy at
national labs that in the mid-1990s
allowed greater access to scientists and
researchers, including those from Russia
and China. Congressional investigators in
1997 said thousands of foreign visitors
were given access without adequate back
ground checks.
"We're interested in what some people
believe is a lax attitude toward security at
some of our national labs, including Los
Alamos" 1 and whether the administration
"reacted to possible breaches in that secu
rity in a timely manner." said Sen.
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., Intelligence
Committee chairman.
Shelby said in a telephone interview
yesterday that "it makes no sense" for the
Energy Department not to have acted
sooner to remove Lee from his job if he
had been targeted since 1996 in an espi
onage investigation.
Administration officials defended the
way the Los Alamos investigation was
conducted and Richardson's decision to
have Lee fired after he reportedly refused
to cooperate with the FBI during three
days of interviews recently.
"We fired him because he had misused
security," said Richardson. "He had

improper contact with foreign officials
and he had violated a number of security
measures."
U.S. intelligence officials became con
cerned in 1995 about China's apparently
having obtained U.S. warhead design
information, probably from Los Alamos,
leading to an FBI criminal investigation in
early 1996 that quickly focused on Lee.
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said the administration launched "a vigor
ous assessment using the CIA and other
assets in our national security operation."
"It is absolutely not true that we down
played evidence of this." State Depart
ment spokesman James I'. Rubin said,
when asked about the Los Alamos inves
tigation. "We took the issue seriously, as
our actions demonstrate."
While there have been no arrests, law
makers. mainly Republicans, expressed
concern about the apparent loss to China
of U.S. secrets that, according to U.S.
intelligence sources, allowed China to
make a significant leap in developing new
warhead technology in the early 19905.
"We found out last year when the
technology was transferred through
American corporations. ... Now wc find
this lax security," complained Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississip
pi.
