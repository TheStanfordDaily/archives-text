Swedish grant to
University will have
positive effects

IN A PRESS conference held yes
terday, University President Ger
hard Casper announced that Stan
ford is set to receive $27.5 million from
the Wallenberg Foundation of Sweden
to establish the Wallenberg Global
Learning Center.
According to a press release, $15
million of this grant will be allocated to
the Stanford University Learning Lab
to equip Wallenberg Hall in Building
160 as a "state-of-the-art facility that
will serve as a prototype for 'techno
logically agile' learning spaces."
The remaining $12.5 million will be
used for "partner activities in the
Swedish Learning Laboratory."
The University community should
be grateful for the opportunity to use
these funds toward the improvement
of its facilities, teaching and overall
academic program.
It will allow Stanford to build upon
current campus programs while estab
lishing new curricular opportunities
that are yet to be determined.
"Universities have not changed
much over the past 1 .(KM) years because
teaching remains the same," Casper
said. "Technology allows us to explore
a different part of teaching."

One example of where technology
is used to better serve both the educa
tors and the educated is the course
"Literary Institutions," currently being
taught as a collaborative project
between the Overseas Studies Pro
gram and the Learning Lab. Computer
technology is used to facilitate dia
logues among students and between
students abroad and faculty at home.
New technology and better learning
space design has tremendous potential
for improving education hefe at Stan
ford.
This grant will also have positive
implications for Stanford in the greater
global learning community.
It will expand the Global Learning
Network, currently being led by Stan
ford. Most importantly, the grant will
help to facilitate partnerships with
educational, cultural and industrial
institutions around the world.
Stanford has another opportunity to
further its reputation as a world leader
in higher education.
While the Wallenberg Grant may be
a tremendous asset to the University, it
also presents a challenge.
Administrators should be cognizant
of the need for student awareness in
making this grant truly successful.
Only through the involvement of stu
dents, one of the most important com
ponents of an educational institution,
will the potential of this grant be real
ized and fully appreciated.
