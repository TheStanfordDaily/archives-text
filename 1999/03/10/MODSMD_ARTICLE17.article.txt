Stanford Basketball
has made us proud,
and we wish them well

STA N FO R D BASK ETBA L L
not only deserves our congratula
tions, but our deepest thanks.
With both the men's and women's
teams NCAA tournament-bound,
Stanford students are provided with
more than tremendous school pride â€”
they will have a reason to put down
their course readers for a few minutes
and do something meaningful. They
can watch college basketball.
The task of making many Stanford
students drop their books for a while is
a sizable challenge. Our basketball
players have achieved this.
The effect that the players have had
on everyone at Stanford is indelible.
While few will ever fondly recall a
statistics lecture or an economics prob
lem set, we will always remember
Mike Montgomery cutting down the
net after winning the Pacific 10 Con
ference championship and Mark Mad
sen dunking against Rhode Island in
the Elite Eight last year.
It is much easier to forget the thou
sands of pages we read for Poli Sci 35

or the dozens of hours spent in front of
a computer for CSIO6A than the
images of Kris Weems rejecting Ari
zona's Jason Terry and Lindsey
Yamasaki swishing a three-pointer.
Our basketball teams have even
made Stanford life better in other,
more intangible ways. We often hear
complaints about the lack of religious
devotion at Stanford. Basketball
solves that problem: we worship
Arthur Lee.
Stanford basketball fans, and the
Sixth Man Club specifically, have been
harshly criticized in recent weeks.
Accused of being fair weather fans,
shamelessly violating rules of common
decency, failing to measure up to Duke
fans and knowing far too little about
the sport of basketball, they have suf
fered their fair share of abuse.
But for all the negative comparisons
between Stanford basketball fans and
Dukes "Cameron Crazies," one thing
has become clear. When former star
guard Jeff Capel began to slump
toward the end of his Duke career,
Cameron fans booed him. Stanford
fans will never do that to any of the
players who have given them so much.
To the members of the mens and
women's basketball teams: we wish
you well.
