# Breathing Lessons
## Don't think about it, just eat it

HAVE YOU seen
the new market
ing ploy? No, not
Cooler Ranch Doritos,
with more chemical fla
voring than ever before
but something along those
lines. A quick scan of the

supermarket aisle now yields not only
"New!" and "Improved!" labels alerting
you to the latest versions of a food but
something from even deeper in the annals
of the Department Of The Obvious. Adjec
tive Labels. Corporations spending money
to put adjective stickers on the products
we've been buying forever.
I guess it shouldn't be a huge surprise,
given the way that advertising is going.
After all, if they can build an enormous
Good Guys in the heart of San Mateo with
a towering lighted sign that reads "WOW!"
then I don't see why they wouldn't manu
facture tiny redundant stickers to jazz up
food packaging. If I read the plan correctly,
adeptly placed words such as "WOW!" and
"Spicy!" make consumers significantly
more likely to enter a particular electronics
store or to purchase a certain brand of salsa.
Really.
It starts today as "Yummy!" and
"Ouenching!" but tomorrow's grocery
stickers will exempt us from having to think
at all. Keep your eyes open for "Contains
Calories" banners on Kraft Mayonnaise
and Chiquita Bananas flanked with the "No
Meat" seal.

The other day I stopped at a campus
eatery and was quite astonished to see signs
that yes, "The Times They Are A-Changin".
Grabbing 50 fluid ounces of Napa Valley
Springs Water off the shelf, a new label
caught my eye.
It screamed "REFRESHING." Need
less to say, 1 was unbelievably thankful
they'd put that extra sticker there. One
enters a cafeteria with so many food points
set aside, and that kind of encouragement
really makes a difference.
Taxing decisions, you know. Last week,
for instance, I stood in the buzzing fluores
cence of a mini mart with a couple of bucks
in my hands and debated between the 106-
ounce Big Swill and bottled water. I must
have looked pretty distraught, because a
man motioned me towards him with a dis
arming smile.
"It's the water problem, isn't it?" he
asked.
"Yes, how did you know?"
"I saw you in front of the cold case," he
said sheepishly, handing me a Kleenex. 1
looked puzzled till he pointed out a large
icicle forming on mv chin.
"Well." he said, stepping closer and
starting to whisper, "I'll let you in on a little
secret."
He cased the joint with two quick
swerves of his head and cocked an eyebrow
furtively, murmuring. "Well, that water, the
water over there," he motioned with his
head, "It's REFRESHING."
Suddenly he flashed his badge at me, and

I saw the Napa Valley Springs logo on his
ID. It was all too much; I couldn't help but
gasp.
I bought the water. And it was refresh
ing.
Back in the land of reality, the logic of
adjective labels is elusive. Do companies
really believe some small descriptive
emphasis will push us off of the fence and
onto their side? Maybe they think con
sumers give points for trying.
Whatever the reasoning, watch out ...
finals week is a prime playground for subtle
influence. You're stumbling through your
day in a sleep-deprived stupor, subsisting
like a lab rat on the push-button deposits of
vending machine sustenance and are per
fect prey to the very sort of rough sugges
tion adjective labels provide. The same
"WOW" that meant "monstrously cool
stereos" on the Good Guys building trans
lates to "may cause abdominal cramping
and loose stools" for bags of Olestra-fried
chips.
A brief guide: cookies equal grain, Star
bursts work toward your five-a-day, animal
crackers are tantamount to protein and as
for dairy — see if you can track down Milk
Duds. Even with these guidelines, it's help
ful to stay on your toes. In the words of a
Chips Ahoy "Snack Size" eater, "Whew,
glad they said something — I guess I won't
count on getting a meal out of this."
