# USHC workers brace for layoffs
## 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
UCSF-Stanford Health Care an
nounced last week that it will lay off
workers as a result of an unanticipat
ed $10.7 million budget shortfall.
A local union protested the news
yesterday afternoon at UCSF. The
University Professional and Techni
cal Employees Union — whose
members include clinical lab techni
cians, lab assistants and computer op
erators — rallied in response to what
Union President Karen MacLeod
termed "obvious mismanagement"
on the part of USHC administrators.
USHC spokesman Daniel
Herman attributed the shortfall to
decreasing governmental funding of
uninsured patients as well as low
rates paid by HMOs.
Berman said that, while some lay
offs will be necessary, the exact num
bers has not been determined. He
also said that, while administrative
and support staff will be targeted, the
exact areas in which layoffs will be
made is not yet known.
MacLeod said the union was told
that layoffs will fall "within the range
of 10 to 15 percent" of workers at
USHC. However she said that if
USHC's target of reducing the ratio

of employees to occupied beds is im
plemented then layoffs will effect
"more like 40 percent" of the USHC
workforce.
Herman, who would not directly
address MacLeod's estimations, said
the employee per occupied bed ratio
at USHC is 7.9, although it ranges
from 5.5 to 6.5 at comparable institu
tions. As a result of layoffs, the ratio
will decrease, he said. "We will not
immediately go that far [as the 5.5
ratio); we will move in that direc
tion."
Berman said layoffs are not the
only means USHC is using to reduce
its 1999 budget. Berman said USHC
is seeking "creative solutions" to the
shortfall and is urging employees to
"work smarter." In addition to lay
offs, each department will also re
ceive a revised 1999 budget in light of
the shortfall.
MacLeod said the controversial
merger between UC-San Francisco
and Stanford Hospitals led to the lay
offs. "The cuts in Medicare are just
an excuse for the merger," she said.
In a press release UCSF-Stanford
Chief Executive Officer Peter Van
Etten disagreed.
"Without the merger, it would not
