Fighting against global warming

1 respond to Shane Shelley's March 4 arti
cle concerning the investing policy at Stan
ford. The article did a fine job of highlighting
the speakers who were at the meeting but
didn't completely capture the purpose of the
student volunteers gathered that evening.
The Global Climate Coalition actively
spends millions of dollars to confuse the
American public about global warming. In a
recent interview on National Public Radio,
Mark Hertsgaard, an environmental journal
ist, pointed out that if you were to go to Ger
many, you would not find a debate about the
existence of global warming. In Germany,
people concede it exists and debate about
what can be done. Because of institutions
like the Global Climate Coalition. America
is still debating global warming's mere exis
tence.
Student volunteers are building a coali
tion of students, faculty and alumni in sup
port of making a statement to Stanford
about their dissatisfaction with companies
Stanford invests in, in particular corpora
tions that are members of the Global Cli
mate Coalition.
Stanford has the chance to listen to the
voice of its own community and take action
against companies who do not act responsi
bly toward the environment as well as
human rights.
Those interested in joining this campaign
can come to our next meeting, today at 7
p.m. in the Haas Center.

Stanford can do its part to slow climate
change by passing resolutions supporting the
Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty
designed to prevent potentially dangerous
human alteration of the atmosphere.
In the near future, the U.S. Senate will
vote whether or not to ratify this protocol.
The prospects for passage do not look good
because many senators have been led to
believe the protocol will cost thousands of
jobs. In fact, most objective analyses show
that the protocol will either create net eco
nomic benefits through improved energy
efficiency and induced technological innova
tion or cost a few cents per gallon of gas.
Flexibility measures — market-based incen
tives and rules — were included in the proto
col to minimize its costs. The Kyoto Protocol
is an affordable first step in preventing glob
al warming. It may also save remaining trop
ical forests and prevent the extinction of
thousands of species. The protocol has
widespread support, and yet 1 (K) senators
may stop the whole show. A voice of reason
from the Stanford community may be able to
ignite a meaningful debate.
The Payne Lecture Series features
Ambassador Raul Estrada-Oyuela, who
presided over the protocol's negotiations.
