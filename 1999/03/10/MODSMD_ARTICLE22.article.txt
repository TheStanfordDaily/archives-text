SINCE 19%, TERENCE Freitas had
been working in the Colombian Andes
to stop Los Angeles-based Occidental
Petroleum from drilling on the lands of the
U'wa people. The U'wa, a traditional com
munity of S,(XM) indigenous people, have
vowed to walk off a 1,4(X) foot cliff in mass
suicide if Occidental is permitted to drill.
Terence Freitas was a friend to the U'wa
people. He was a threat lo Occidental.
"Terry |Freitas] was finding direct evi
dence that linked the oil companies to the
paramilitaries, and that was very dangerous."
said Melinda Selverston, director of the
Washington-based Coalition for Amazonian
People and the Environment.
Freitas, a 24-year-old recent graduate
from UC-Santa Cruz, had been followed by
people he believed to be right-wing paramil
itaries allied with oil companies in the area.
He had also received anonymous death
threats at his Oakland home by people who
told him "to back off or die."
He was disliked by the Colombian army,
and the right-wing paramilitary groups as
well as the country's largest leftist guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of

Colombia (FARC).
"He had problems with every violent
actor in the region." according to Coletta
Youngers, a Colombia specialist at the
Washington Office on Latin America. But
his passion for indigenous rights took him
back to the area time and again. Last month
Freitas returned to Colombia with 41-year
old Ingrid Washinawatok and 39-year-old
Lahe'ena'e Gay. The three were members of
an indigenous rights group that had filed suit
to block oil drilling in the region. They were
working with the U'wa to develop an educa
tional and cultural program for their chil
dren. Freitas had also been investigating dis
appearances of members of the community.
On Feb. 25 Freitas, Washinawatok and
Clay were kidnapped on their way to the
local airport. Last Thursday their bodies
were found in a cow pasture just across the
Colombia / Venuezuela border. They had
been blindfolded and bore marks of torture.
Each had been shot at least four times at
point blank range.
The U.S. government has placed blame
for the murders on the FARC guerrillas.
Demanding that the FARC hand over the

murderers, the U.S. government halted the
incipient peace negotiations between the
guerrillas and the Colombian government.
The U.S. allegations are based on claims by
the Colombian military that they have inter
cepted a radio conversation between a
FARC leader and another rebel. Members
of the IJ'wa who witnessed the kidnapping
also accuse the FARC.
The FARC has denied responsibility for
the murders, accusing right-wing paramili
taries of attempting to sabotage the peace
negotiations. Colleagues of the victims sup
port these claims. It was paramilitaries, not
the FARC, who issued death threats to Fre
itas. The kidnappers wore masks and civilian
clothes, outfits more typical of paramilitary
groups than of guerrillas, who usually wear
uniforms and bandannas. Having just
entered into peace negotiations, the FARC
would have much to lose by murdering U.S.
citizens.
The tragedy of Freitas, Washinatowak
and Gay is not an isolated event. It is an
embodiment of decades of senseless death
and gross impunity. While one group may
eventually be implicated in this case, the

paramilitaries, the military and the FARC
are all guilty of violence. The murder rate in
Colombia is 85 per KX).(XX) people, approxi
mately 10 times that of the United States.
Much of the violence is based in Colombia's
SO percent share of the world's cocaine trade.
With so much fear of retribution and dis
trust of the state, only one in 10 crimes goes
to trial. Of these. 99 percent are acquitted.
Those who take a stand for human rights are
often shot, so most judges are either afraid or
cynical. Sicarios, the adolescent hit-men paid
as little as $10 per murder, are the more
depended-upon form of "justice."
Occidental Petroleum has operated with
impunity in such a context, using threats and
bribery to secure its hold on the IJ'wa land.
Should Occidental be allowed to drill on
their traditional lands, it will destroy the lives
of the IJ'wa people. No group threatens mass
suicide lightly. Terence Freitas did not know
he would die in his fight against Occidental,
but he knew why he was risking his life.
Either directly or indirectly. Occidental must
be held accountable for his death.
The U.S. government is also guilty. U.S.
tax dollars fund the Colombian military.

even though the military is indisputably con
nected to the paramilitary death squads
responsible for the great majority of murders
in Colombia. And now, in suspending the
peace negotiations, the U.S. government will
be complicit in converting three tragic mur
ders into thousands more.
In a speech in 1992. Ingrid Washinawatok
said, "the human family needs all its peoples
to come together if it is to survive." In the last
three decades, Colombia has had more than
3().(XX) martyrs. The exploitation, the vio
lence and the impunity must stop, both with
in Colombia and internationally.
Accountability must supercede U.S.
power plays, multinational sovereignty and a
desire for politically expedient punishment.
Terence Freitas, Ingrid Washinawatok and
Lahe'ena'e Gay were members of that small
sector of humankind who acts on its princi
ples in a world where silence and complicity
seem the only ticket to survival.
Let us not misconstrue their deaths. Let
us not dishonor their lives.
