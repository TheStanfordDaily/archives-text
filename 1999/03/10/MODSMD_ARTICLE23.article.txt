# Bicycle seats increase risk of sexual dysfunction

The correlation between exten
sive bike riding and erectile dys
function has been no secret to bicy
cling enthusiasts for quite a while.
Now Stanford urologist Robert
Kessler is doing something about it.
His mission came into focus
about five years ago when scientif
ic journals began highlighting geni
tal problems associated with bike
riding, including impotence.
The articles prompted Boston
urologist Irwin Goldstein to con
duct various studies, which re
vealed conclusive damage to male
reproductive arteries and nerves as
a result of bike riding.
Before then "I thought the erec
tion problems I was finding in
young men were purely psycholog
ical," Kessler said. "And then I

asked about biking." Kessler soon
became aware of the coincidence
between bikers and the painful
conditions they bear as a sacrifice
to their sport, such as numbness,
tingling and even impotence.
Goldstein brought dreary news
to cycling enthusiasts two years ago
with his conclusions on the sport's
ill effects, specifically in irre
versible impotence.
He surveyed a total of 81 males
with erectile dysfunction who un
derwent standard impotence diag
nostic evaluations.
"Bicycle riding-associated im
potence occurs in different forms of
bicycle riding and riding exposures,
at different ages, in men with few
vascular risk factors and otherwise
good health who may or may not
recall episodes of recognized blunt
perineal trauma," Goldstein said.
Further lie found that "in males

and females bicycle riding expo
sure was associated with increased
sexual and urinary tract dysfunc
tion."
Kessler discovered reports of
similar problems to be especially
pronounced in those who bike
more than six hour per week.
Kessler joined forces with physi
cian and product designer Roger
Minkow, a cyclist himself, in order
to help combat the erectile prob
lems with a replacement seat.
Minkow designed the Minkow
Wedge, a Y-shaped saddle with the
rear portion removed to reduce
pressure on critical arteries. With
this seat the biker sits on the ischial
tuberosites (where bones stick
out), displacing the pressure previ
ously focused on nerves or vessels
exerted by traditional bike seats.
Kessler and Minkow saw 25 pa
tients, ages 27 to 62, all suffering

from bicycle-related medical prob
lems and to each they offered the
innovative saddle.
According to Kessler, 14 found
"complete" relief, while 9 out of
the remaining 11 experienced al
most "complete" relief.
"And this was a problem that
before seemed not very re
versible," Kessler said.
Minkow's seat is now available
to the general biking public.
"People are really going in and
asking for the seats," Kessler said.
"Serious bikers are aware of the
problem, and this is something that
they are addressing."
Kim Brown of Palo Alto Bicy
cles confirmed this.
"You get a lot of people coming
in here and saying, 'I need a saddle
for, well, you know .. and 1 just
