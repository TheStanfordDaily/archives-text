## University conducts self-study in compliance with regulations 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
The NCAA has certified the De
partment of Athletics after review
ing a comprehensive self-study per
formed by the University.
Issues included in the study were
fiscal and academic integrity, gender
equity and rules compliance.
Their findings were issued in a re
port compiled by administrators,
faculty, student-athletes and others
affiliated with Stanford. The report
was submitted to the NCAA in com
pliance with recent legislation re

quiring all Division I institutions to
undergo a certification process.
"I think we learned a lot about
ourselves," said Athletics Director
Ted Leland.
One of the issues focused on was
the academic performance of stu
dent-athletes.
Leland said he was pleased with
the graduation rate for student-ath
letes, adding that the study showed
that the areas of study student-ath
letes have chosen are not "clus
tered."
"The NCAA is interested in
making sure that athletes graduate,

are doing serious academic work
and not being.. .treated different
from other students academically,"
said University Registrar Roger
Printup, who chaired the Academic
Integrity subcommittee.
"There is no clear 'dumping
ground' major," said Printup. noting
that at some other schools too many
athletes major in "recreational stud
ies or physical education."
"We don't have anything like
that, and that's a good thing," he
said.
"We have a good distribution
across majors of students who are

also athletes," said Printup, describ
ing the findings of his committee as
"pretty positive."
"I still think there is a general
issue of how athletes feel they're
being seen by fellow students," said
Printup, describing the issue as
"something the University needs to
work on."
He said that focus groups with
student athletes revealed that they
thought other students questioned
an athlete's intelligence compared
to the rest of the student body.
"Athletes compete seriously in
the classroom." said Printup. "But
it's a time commitment.... Choices
have to be made."
"Athletics in particular is more
structured," Printup said. "You
can't just blow it off like some things
you participate in."
He said the University was con
cerned with how athletes fit acade
mics into their time constraints.
He gave the example of freshman
seminars, which often take place in
the afternoon, conflicting with prac
tice times for many student athletes.
Among other topics of concern
that were raised included such im
portant aspects as making sure the
University continues to follow the
NCAA regulations.
"Our recommendations were
that we continue to expand our edu
cational efforts, specifically working
in relation with students, coaches
and alumni groups, keeping them
aware of changes in NCAA regula
tions," said James Montoya, vice
provost for student affairs.

Montoya chaired the subcommit
tee for the governance and commit
ment to rules compliance.
Gender equity was also a focus of
the self-study.
Leland said the Athletics Depart
ment discovered it was"in good
shape" in terms of laws designed to
promote gender equity.
He did say, however, that "we
may want to look at augmenting the
women's program again."
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Emeritus Mary Ed
monds was chair of the Steering
Committee, which commissioned
the sub-committees.
The study involved focus groups,
individual interviews, question
naires and review of documenta
tion.
Montoya noted that when the
NCAA visiting committee consist
ing of administrators from other uni
versities asked the Stanford commit
tees questions about their report,
some called Stanford a model of in
tercollegiate athletic programs.
"In terms of breadth of programs,
our competitive posture and acade
mics, I don't know of any institution
that's comparable," Leland said.
