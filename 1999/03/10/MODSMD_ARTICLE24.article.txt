## University conducts self-study in compliance with regulations 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
The NCAA has certified the De
partment of Athletics after review
ing a comprehensive self-study per
formed by the University.
Issues included in the study were
fiscal and academic integrity, gender
equity and rules compliance.
Their findings were issued in a re
port compiled by administrators,
faculty, student-athletes and others
affiliated with Stanford. The report
was submitted to the NCAA in com
pliance with recent legislation re

quiring all Division I institutions to
undergo a certification process.
"I think we learned a lot about
ourselves," said Athletics Director
Ted Leland.
One of the issues focused on was
the academic performance of stu
dent-athletes.
Leland said he was pleased with
the graduation rate for student-ath
letes, adding that the study showed
that the areas of study student-ath
letes have chosen are not "clus
tered."
"The NCAA is interested in
making sure that athletes graduate,

are doing serious academic work
and not being.. .treated different
from other students academically,"
said University Registrar Roger
Printup, who chaired the Academic
Integrity subcommittee.
"There is no clear 'dumping
ground' major," said Printup. noting
that at some other schools too many
athletes major in "recreational stud
ies or physical education."
"We don't have anything like
that, and that's a good thing," he
said.
"We have a good distribution
across majors of students who are

also athletes," said Printup, describ
ing the findings of his committee as
"pretty positive."
"I still think there is a general
issue of how athletes feel they're
being seen by fellow students," said
Printup, describing the issue as
"something the University needs to
work on."
He said that focus groups with
student athletes revealed that they
thought other students questioned
an athlete's intelligence compared
to the rest of the student body.
