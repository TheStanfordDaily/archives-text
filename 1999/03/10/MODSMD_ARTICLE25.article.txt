# Athletics Dept. considering new 'S' logo

### Mills Schenck 
The cardinal red block "S" em
blem with the green tree in the
center has represented Stanford
athletics for years to alumni, stu
dents and fans.
Recently, however, the Athlet
ics Department has initiated mar
ket research studies aimed at pos
sibly changing Stanford's athletic

department logo.
Jon Denney, Assoc.
Athletic Director for
External Develop
ment, said that the logo
"should convey Stan
ford's combination of
excellence in athletics
and academics, as well
as a sense of integrity
and leadership. At the
moment we are testing
this message."
Denney went on to
say that in addition to

this testing, the Athletics Depart
ment is looking at the messages
conveyed by different images.
Market research is being han
dled by an independent firm that
has organized focus groups con
sisting of alumni, students and
members of the community to as
sess opinions about the current
logo.
While there are no fixed alter
natives, the focus groups were also
used to test feedback on several
new designs for an emblem.
Denney was reluctant to fore
cast the possibility of changing the
"S," having not yet read the re
search team's entire report.
According to water polo head

coach Dante Dettamanti, two po
tential designs were presented six
months ago at a coaches meeting
to test their reactions.
"Results were mixed, and it was
difficult to get a consensus opin
ion," said Dettamanti, who em
phasized that the research is only
in its preliminary stage.
"The first alternative direc
tion," Denney said, "is a more

modern version of the
"S" without the tree in
it."
T his direction is
meant to convey a
more modern and in
novative image, ac
cording to Denney.
"The second,"
said Denney, "is a
more iconic and high
tech version of the "S"
that is meant to have a
more regional connec
tion with Silicon Valley

and the Bay Area."
When he heard about the possi
ble change, freshman Nick Ellis, a
member of the water polo team,
said. "I think that changing our 'S'
would go against all of the success
and tradition that has been built
over the years around Stanford
Athletics."
The final report of the market ,
research team was submitted to
the Athletics Department early !
this week, but Denney does not ex
pect any decisions to be made until
the end of March.
"We have to examine there- •
port before we decide on what to •
do next," he said, "if we decide to
do anything at all."
