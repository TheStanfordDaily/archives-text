## Making a baby 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
The criteria tor being an egg donor these days
seem to be getting tougher and tougher.
According to an ad that recently covered half the
back page of The Daily, you have to be tall — 5 feet
10 inches to be precise. You have to be smart — at
least 1400 on your SAT's. No family history of dis
ease .. . and, oh yeah, it would be nice if you are a
student at a prestigious university such as Stanford,
Yale or Penn.
If you meet the criteria and are comfortable with
the idea of contributing your DN A to a couple you
have never met, you stand to gain $50,000.
That amount of money is enough to cover two
years of tuition at a school like Stanford. To a young
woman with large student loans, it is a tempting
offer.
This ad, and others like it, are becoming regular
features in the classified sections of selected campus
papers.
Often featuring drawings of storks and sweet
newborns, the ads exhort young women to "be an
angel" and "give the gift of life." Only it is not real
ly a gift if you are getting paid thousands of dollars
for your services — it is business.
Ads like the one offering $50,000 are rare, but
that couple's requirements are very specific. It is as

basic as the law of supply and demand.
All of this raises significant ethical dilemmas.
Should infertile couples be targeting cash-strapped
college women to donate eggs? Should eggs be trad
ed for large amounts of money?
And what do we make of the eugenic undertones
when couples seek out special traits such as height,
10. hair or eye color ?
According to Dr. Barry Behr, director of the In
Vitro Fertilization laboratory at Stanford Hospital,
it makes perfect sense for couples who need egg
donors to target college women.
"They're in the prime of life, they're the healthi
est — they're ideal for egg donation," Behr said.
But Behr cautions couples who think that eggs
donated from a Stanford or Ivy League student are
going to develop into a perfect baby and admits he
is shocked to think there are people willing to spend
$50,000 for a "premium" egg.
"It's naive and ignorant, to think you can buy
intelligence," he said.
"That just reflects their desperation to get the
child of their dreams. How many professors have
kids who don't become professors? How many kids
don't follow in their parents' footsteps?" he asked.
Still, Behr doesn't see anything wrong with pay
ing egg donors — he said they deserve compensa
tion for what they go through.
It typically takes six weeks to prepare a woman to
donate her eggs.

First, the donor is submit

ted to a battery of
medical testing to

make sure she is
healthy. She must be
injected twice daily

with fertility drugs to stimu
late her ovaries into pro
ducing multiple eggs rather
than the one egg nature
prefers. These injections

require trips to the doc

tor's office which, as

Behr points out, are
always time-consum

ing.
When the eggs are

ready to be extracted, the
donor is partially anes

thetized, and a 17-gauge needle
is inserted through the vagina

and into the ovaries

"It's not pleasant, and it hurts." Behr
said.

"I'd like to think [egg donors] do it
for altruistic reasons, but unfortunate
ly, money makes the world go round,"

he added.
Egg donors are paid $2,000 to i
$3,000 on average. In the past, $5,000
was considered high, but that was
before the ad offering $50,000 made
national headlines.
According to Dr. William Hurlbut,

who teaches a course in bioethics in the
Human Biology Department, such com

pensation from one couple is excessive.
"They could keep a lot of poor, unfortu
nate kids alive with $50,000," Hurlbut said.

But Behr said it is not up to doctors to tell peo
ple they are paying too much for egg donation, just
as it is not up to doctors to decide how many chil
dren a couple should have.
"We're not put in that position," he said. "That
would make us philosophers or judges, and that's
not our role. Basically, if you can afford the service,
you can have it."
Reactions from students to the half-page ad were
varied.
Alie Serrato, a junior in Hurlbut's bioethics class,
used to have negative feelings about in vitro fertil
ization and treatment of infertility until someone in

her family needed to use fertility drugs to get preg
nant. Still, the ad bothered her.
"There was something vain about how [the cou
ple] approached it," Serrato said. "To have such
specific criteria is really pushing the limit."
But classmate Randi Barken, a senior, admitted
she was swayed by the dollar signs. "I have the SAT
score," she said. "If 1 were over 5 [feet] 10 [inches],
I would've answered the ad."
