# Dolly cloner to headline event
## Wilmut is keynote speaker at symposium 
### Ryan Chuang Kim Downs Contributing writers 
1 Top scientists from around the
world, including lan Wilniut. the sci
entist known for cloning the sheep
; Dolly, will gather tomorrow to
•attend the University's first gene
therapy symposium entitled "Gene
• Therapy: Prospects for the Next
Decade."
• "It is wonderful to have this
to bring such renowned
•scientists to Stanford to talk about
i their research in gene therapy, a
"novel form of drug delivery that is
• likely to play a major role in the
future of medicine," said Molecular
w Pharmacology Prof. Helen Blau, the
•chief organizer of the event. Blau is
also the director of Gene Therapy
Technology.
The focus of the symposium will
be on research innovations in somat
ic gene therapy. Gene therapy is a
.'new form of pharmacology that is
used to treat disease in which the
body creates its own therapeutic
molecules rather than receiving
molecules synthesized by drug com
panies.
. The speakers at the conference
include experts in the gene therapy
.field from around the world as well
as Stanford's own gene therapy spe
cialists.
Wilmut will give the keynote
'address at the conference. An
•expert in early mammalian develop
ment, he is currently a visiting pro
cessor in the Molecular Pharmacolo
gy Department.
' The organizers of the symposium
selected Wilmut to give the keynote
r address because his work raises the
;possibility of transferring genes per
manently to human children.
\ "We, the public and the scientists,
*need to think about this ahead of

time and to give careful considera
tion to the scientific and ethical
issues this raises, as well as the excit
ing possibilities for the treatment of
diseases for generations to come,"
Blau said.
Biochemistry Prof. Paul Berg,
who is also a Nobel laureate, will
provide opening remarks. Berg
helped make this symposium possi
ble by providing funding -through
Stanford's Program in Molecular
and Genetic Medicine.
The symposium is divided into
several sessions focusing on specific
studies involving gene therapy.
There will be four different sessions
held throughout the day at the sym
posium. They will be: "Cardiovascu
lar Gene Therapy," "Single Gene
Defects and New Technology,"
"Vectors and Immunology" and
"Cancer and Stem Cells."
The topics addressed in these ses
sions will encompass techniques for
altering viruses, delivering genes to
specific areas in the body, advances
in gene transfer in the nervous sys
tem and potential strategies for
treating AIDS.
"I think gene therapy is going to
be very useful in the near future in
the treatment of heart disease by
growing new blood vessels or pre
venting blockage of existing blood
vessels, the treatment of cancer, in
vaccine development and in the
treatment of diseases such as
hemophilia," Blau said.
Members of Stanford's gene ther
apy program involved with this
event include Blau, Assoc. Derma
tology Prof. Paul Khavari, Asst.
Molecular Pharmacology Prof.
Garry Nolan, Assoc. Pediatrics Prof.
Mark Kay and physicians Gary
Fathman, Ronald Levy, Thomas
Quertemous and Branimir Sikic
from the Medicine Department.
These scientists have made
many important contributions to
the field of gene therapy and con
tinue to explore new ways to battle
a myriad of diseases.
Among the focuses of these es

teemed scientists are the treatment
of hemophilia. non-Hodgkin's lym
phomas, breast cancer, human skin
and autoimmune diseases, lentivi
ral vectors for gene delivery and
technologies for gene regulation.
" This symposium is important
for future gene therapy efforts at
Stanford." said Kay. who is also di
rector of Human Gene Therapy.
Kay will give the closing remarks of
the conference.

Blau and Kay are collaborating
to plan a multidisciplinary program
that will include a broad range of
investigators, new courses, a jour
nal club, a seminar series and re
treats that will focus on gene thera
py.
The symposium is free and open
to the public and will be held at
Fair child Auditorium, in the
School of Medicine, from 8 a.m. to
5:30 p.m.
