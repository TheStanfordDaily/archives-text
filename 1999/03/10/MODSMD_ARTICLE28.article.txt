# Science Bug explains how in vitro fertilization works
## Having babies against all odds 
### Garth Patil Contributing writer 
Q: / just saw another egg donation
ad in The Daily that offered a
"large financial incentive" for
"intelligent, athletic"females with
"desirable traits" to donate their
ova to an infertile couple. Aside
from a few ethical questions that I
have with the concept, how exactly
does third-party egg donation
work?
A: Maybe I need to catch up a little
bit. 1 was under the impression that
human babies came from storks
that carried the infants through the
air and gently planted (or in my
case dropped) them on the
doorsteps of their parents' homes.
My mother stiLl contends that is
how I came to be in her "posses
sion," and it had nothing to do with
biological conception or any desire
on her part to have a third son.
Just to make sure 1 wasn't oper

ating under any false pretenses, 1
decided to take a hack at this
week's question, and it turned out
that there was a lot more to me
than my mother was letting on.
Amidst the controversy that has
arisen from an ad in The Daily
offering $S(),(MX) for the donation of
an egg, your question is probably
the easiest to answer. However, it's
interesting to note that of the peo
ple I ran this question by, very few
of them actually knew how the pro
.cess worked.i So, of all the ques
tions that are raised by such an
issue, this might be the most impor
tant one to address before one
delves into further discussion on
the subject.
In vitro fertilization, also called
test-tube conception, is a medical
procedure in which mature egg
cells are removed from a woman,
fertilized with male sperm outside
the body and inserted into the
uterus of the same or another

woman for normal gestation.
Although in vitro fertilization with
re-implantation of fertilized eggs
(ova) has long been widely used in
animal breeding, the first success
ful birth of a human child from in
vitro fertilization, carried out by
Patrick Steptoe and R.G. Edwards
of Britain, did not take place until
1978.
Although it may be unclear to
some men on this campus, women
usually grow (no, not lay) a single
egg in a month. In the case of third-,
party in vitro fertilization, the
donor takes a lutinizing hormone
that can be utilized alone or in
combination to induce several folli
cles to develop. (A follicle is a bag
of water that houses the egg next to
the ovary.)
The eggs' development is then
monitored by ultrasound or inter
pretation of blood or urinary pro
gesterone and estrogen levels.
Embryologists evaluate the devel

opment on an ongoing basis to
determine the appropriate timing
for administration of the human
chorionic gonadotropin injection
to trigger final stages of ovulation.
When in vitro fertilization was
first used with humans, the eggs
were retrieved by laparoscopy, a
technique that involves creating an
incision in the abdomen. Today,
they are collected by a transvagi
nal. ultrasound-guided method that
is less invasive (in the surgical
sense rather than the privacy
sense). This is a technique that
involves the introduction of a fairly
small needle through the vaginal
wall guided by an ultrasonic probe.
Utilizing this procedure, eggs can
be harvested under local anesthe
sia. At this point, the donor's job is
done.
After the egg collection proce
dure, the harvested ova are placed
in an incubator along with the
extracted follicular fluid. This mix
ture is placed in a nutrient rich cul
ture where the eggs remain closely
monitored for four to six hours
before the embryologist adds the
sperm to allow the fertilization pro
cess to occur.
Two to three days later, if the
embryos are growing normally,
they are ready for transfer.
The embryo, which at this point
is known as a blastocyst, is intro
duced through the cervix into the
uterus, where the blastocyst floats
freely for about three-and-a-half
days. Of the problems that have
been noted with the in-vitro fertil
ization procedure, successful
implantation seems to be the weak
est link. One possible explanation
for this problem is that the devel
oping egg and the development of
the endometrial tissue are not per
fectly synchronized. However, if
the procedure is successful, the
embryo implants itself in the uter
ine wall, and pregnancy begins.
