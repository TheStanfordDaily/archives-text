# 'Happy 99 EXE' worms its way onto campus

### Jane Morril Contributing writer 
A new computer worm known as "Happy99EXE"
is assaulting computers at Stanford, the campus com
puter security office announced last month.
Each time an e-mail is sent from an infected com
puter, the worm sends an additional message as an at
tachment. The attachment contains a copy of the
worm without the user's knowledge. The problem was
first reported to the computer office on February 19.
"Happy99EXE" is a worm, not a virus, which dis
tinguishes the area of the computer it infects. Unlike
viruses, worms do not infect programs or files but
rather penetrate the computer's memory from a com
puter network and attach themselves to files sent with
in the network.
"A virus needs a host to live, for example an oper
ating system," said Stephen Hansen, director of the
campus computer security office. "A worm sits around
and waits for you to send an e-mail. It is different from
a virus because it does not replicate itself."
The worm attaches itself to e-mails, appearing as a
file named "Happy99EXE" in the e-mail or as a sepa
rate attachment. It is disguised under a program enti
tled "Happy New Year 1999," which shows a firework
display when executed.
The worm infects only Windows 95 and 98, and will
not affect Macintoshes if sent to them.
"Happy99EXE" was first posted on the Internet in
several newsgroups, and then some users began to
transmit it via e-mail. Infected computers can send the

worm
to others when

the worm either at

taches itself to an e-mail

sent by the user or infiltrates the users ad

dress book and sends itself to these recipients on its
own.
In order to avoid this and other worms or viruses,
the computer security office advises users to open only
files they requested. Those who receive an unrequest
ed attachment should verify its authenticity and scan it
for viruses before opening it. If the file is not verified,
it should be trashed immediately.
"In any of these cases, whether we are dealing with
worms or viruses, there is a problem that will continue
to grow as long as people click on files without verify
ing where they came from," Hansen said.
An even newer virus was reported Monday to com
puter security. Hansen said this virus is believed to
have originated in Bulgaria.
"T his one claims to have some pictures attached to
it, but when you click on the attachment it says 'in
valid,' " Hansen said. "In actuality, the program is in
stalling itself and giving this message. Computer users
must be extra cautious, as this virus is too new to be de
tected in a virus check."
Users should contact the campus computer securi
ty office to report any possible viruses they receive. In
the case of "Happv99EXE," they should also notify
the person who sent the worm through e-mail.
