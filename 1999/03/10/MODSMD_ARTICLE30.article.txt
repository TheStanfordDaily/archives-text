# Doctoral programs cut admits
## National trend allows for larger financial packages 
### Huat Chye Lim Contributing writer 
Universities across the nation
are admitting fewer doctoral stu
dents in the humanities and sci
ences in order to provide more fi
nancial assistance to those admit
ted. Some Stanford departments
are following this trend.
According to an article in the
Feb. 26 Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation. a new model of graduate
education is gaining popularity:
"enroll fewer students, but give all
of them full financial support." As
an example the Chronicle cited
Duke University, where doctoral
enrollment has shrunk 28 percent
since 1994.
The reduced number of doctor
al students admitted to Duke has
enabled the university to provide
more lucrative aid packages for
those admitted.
Duke was forced into this prac
tice because its small financial aid
packages were turning top students
away from the university, the
Chronicle reported.
At Stanford the Philosophy De
partment finds itself in a similar sit
uation. "This year we've converted
one of our fellowships to provide
more aid to doctoral students," De
partment Chair and Philosophy
Prof. John Etchcmendy said.
In previous years philosophy
doctoral students were funded only
for their first four years of study.
However, as an experiment, the de
partment recently decided to use a
Mellon Foundation grant to fund
students for five vears, the time

that most philosophy doctoral can
didates take to earn their degree.
"That program was tremen
dously successful," Etehemendy
said. As a result the department
has decided to continue funding
doctoral students for the full five
years. However, Etehemendy con
ceded that this increased funding
has come at a price: the department
now accepts fewer doctoral candi
dates annually than it did before
the funding increase.
According to Etehemendy the
increase in funding was necessary
to preserve the quality of doctoral
students admitted to the depart
ment. "If we were to continue of
fering four years of funding and
other institutions were offering
five, it certainly would have had an
effect" on the quality of philosophy
doctoral candidates at Stanford,
Etehemendy explained.
The Mathematics Department
is adopting similar tactics. It too
has increased financial aid to stu
dents and recently established a
Stanford Graduate Scholarship
specifically to lure top doctoral
candidates to the department.
"There is some concern that if
our aid packages are not consistent
with other top Ph.D. programs, we
may lose students on account of
that," said Mathematics Prof.
Richard Schoen. who heads the de
partment's graduate admissions
committee.
However, one key difference
between the math and philosophy
departments is that the Math De
partment is not admitting fewer
doctoral students to compensate
for the increase in aid.
Slight variations aside. Schoen
said, "the number of doctoral stu
dents admitted has remained
roughly constant over the last 20
years."

The trend toward increased aid
for doctoral candidates has not
taken hold in all departments,
though.
Economics Chair and Prof. John
Pencavel. for one, said that he con
sidered his department's financial
aid offers comparable to those of
its main competitors: Harvard,
MIT and the University of Chica
go-
Pencavel said one reason the
Economics Department's aid pack
ages have remained largely con
stant over previous years is that
economics doctoral students
choose to attend a given institution
based less on that institution's aid
package than on "the perception
among students that one [econom
ics] department is hiring better fac
ulty while another is losing them."
However, he admitted that if
economics departments at other
universities were to improve on
their aid packages, "that would be
very disconcerting indeed, and we
would try to harass the administra
tion into giving us more [financial]
support [for our aid packages]."
Political Science Prof. John Fer
ejohn, who chairs the department's
graduate admissions committee,
shared Pencavel's views.
He said that the department has
no plans to increase its aid pack
ages in the near future, although,
"if we find we're systematically los
ing people to other universities,
we'll go to the university to ask for
more [financial support]."
Despite the differences in de
partmental aid policies, one com
monly held view among depart
ments is that, in Ferejohn's words,
"given the cost of living around
here, Stanford's aid packages are
not too large. Doctoral students
should undoubtedly be getting
more."
