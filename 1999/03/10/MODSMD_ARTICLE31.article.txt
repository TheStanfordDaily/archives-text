## Njoroge calls Kenya home 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
When Nju "Joe" Njoroge was a child in Nairobi,
Kenya, he loved running around outside. "My parents
would lock the doors in fancy ways," said the electrical
engineering major, "hut as soon as I learned how to
walk. I was outdoors. They marveled at the different

ways 1 learned how to open the doc
Njoroge, a sophomore in Potter,
spent his first seven years in Nairo
bi, then spent his next six years in
Princeton, N.J., and the following
six in Geneva, Switzerland.
"I've never felt such a sense of
belonging" as in Kenya, he said. "I
can truly call it home.... In my
other homes, I've never felt like I
really belonged."

His relatives, including his 42 cousins, still live in
Nairobi, and he returns for visits every two years.
"Eventually, I want to go back to Kenya and use my
engineering abilities and talents to help the develop
ment of my country," lie said.
His father is a civil engineer, and his mother is a
Presbyterian minister and currently works with the
World Council of Churches.
"( elcbritv is the wrong word," he said, "but she was
the first woman pastor in the Presbyterian Church of
East Africa. When she was ordained, it was kind of a
big deal. I was (known as J the first woman pastor's
son."
His family, with his sister Njeri, who is now 17,

moved to Princeton so his mother could study at the
University. He remembers being surprised when he
arrived in September. "I had never been in a place that
cold," he said, but he adjusted to the new country read
ily because he was so young.
In Geneva, he attended an international high
school and learned French, adding to his fluent knowl
edge of English and his native language Kikuyu and
his partial knowledge of Swahili.
Njoroge said that he was struck by the Swiss small
ness of scale as compared to America. "Santa Teresa
Street here is the si/e of the main streets in downtown
Geneva," he said.
He added that the drinking age was another big
change. In Switzerland, the legal age was 16. "Kids like
us — 15 [or] 16 years old — were going to bars. It's a
really safe city," he explained.
The pace of life was another culture shock. "The
generalization applies — there's no hurry in Africa,"
he said. "When someone says they'll be coming by a
place in the afternoon, in the U.S. that means noon. In
Kenya, it means five."
Njoroge decided to come to Stanford partly be
cause "I had never been out west, and I was going with
my adventurous spirit."
The weather was another reason. "I thought it
would be like Kenya," he said, adding that he has been
"somewhat disappointed" bv the rain, especially El
Nino last year.
He plans to attend graduate school, study more en
gineering and return to Kenya. "I'm proud of where I
come from, my heritage, parents, relatives, culture. All
those things contribute to the person I am today."
