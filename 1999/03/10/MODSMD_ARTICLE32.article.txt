# Spring break brings varied travels
## Athletes, a capella, volunteers, students cover the globe 
### Anthony Chiu Contributing writer 
Many students will be using
spring break as a brief time of re
laxation between hectic winter and
spring quarters.
However, several groups
around campus will be busy repre
senting Stanford around the globe.
I he men's rugby team will be trav
eling to France from March 19-30.
Besides playing matches against a
student team and two reserve pro
fessional squads, the team plans to
visit Paris and bike in the Pyrenees
Mountains.
The well traveled team, which
has gone to Fiji and Hawaii in re
cent years, finds touring to be very
worthwhile. "The team learns a lot
because we tour in rugby country,"
said coach Franck Boivert. "Our
game improves, because in the
USA there is no rugby culture or
tradition that is as strong as in these
countries."
Other club and varsity sports
will also be active during the break
but staying in the country, includ
ing the men and women's Ultimate
teams who will travel to Wilming
ton. N.C. to compete at the College
Easterns tournament.
"This is definitely the biggest
tournament on the East Coast,

[with| about 16 women's teams and
20 men's teams," said women's
team captain Mary Hunt Martin.
"All of the best teams from the
East will be there — Yale, Brown.
Carleton and Wilmington — and
some West Coast teams as well.
"We go because it's our best
chance to see teams from the East
before nationals." The women's
team won the tournament last year
in their first appearance.
A few classes are also venturing
abroad to experience what they
have spent the past quarter dis
cussing in the classroom. The
Sophomore Seminar "Earth
quakes and Archaeology in the
Eastern Mediterranean," taught by
Geophysics Prof. Amos Nur, will
be examining various archaeologi
cal sites in Israel and Jordan for 10
days.
"We'll be looking at the'sites
from traditional archaeological
perspectives hut also looking for
evidence of earthquake damage,"
said sophomore Sarah Trainer.
The idea that earthquakes dam
aged many ancient Mediterranean
cities goes against the prevailing
theory that war caused much of the
destruction.
Some students will travel to
South America to advocate conser
vation in the Amazon as a part of
the Peru Field Seminar. "We need
to integrate conservation with sus
tainable community develop
ment," said sophomore Tamara
Gagnolet.
By serving as eco-tourists, the

class will encourage the preserva
tion of wildlife while helping the
local economy. The students will
also visit the Incan ruins at Cu/.co
and Machu Picchu.
Staying somewhat closer to
home, several of Stanford's a
capella groups will hit the road for
spring break. Fleet Street will stay
on the West Coast, visiting Seattle,
San Diego and Las Vegas, while
the Mendicants are going to San
Antonio and New Orleans. Talis
man. Mixed Company and Every
day People will also be on East
Coast tours.
"Touring, especially on the East
Coast, is fun because we get to in
teract with the groups over there
who tend to have a completely dif
ferent style of music than we do,"
said senior Christine Chang, the
musical director for Mixed Compa
ny.
"It's also terrific ... to have
nothing to do but drive around and
sing for people and not have to
worry about schoolwork or other
commitments."
Another 100 or so Stanford stu
dents will be fanning out across the
West Coast as part of the 11 Alter
native Spring Break projects of
fered through the Haas Center for
Public Service.
Sophomore Fed Bowie, who
will be on the Hawaii Native-
American Cross-Cultural Ex
change, said "I hope to see every
thing from a non-tourist perspec
tive and really experience what it's
like to be a native Hawaiian."
