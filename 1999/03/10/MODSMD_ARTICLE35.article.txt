# Women residents satisfied with opportunities at Med School
## 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
The demanding schedule of the
typical surgeon is still a deterrent for
many female medical students con
cerned about balancing the needs of
work and family. However women
who have graduated from Stanford's
medical school or completed their
training in the Medical Center's sur
gical residency programs seen) to
have a special advantage.
Dr. Elliot Wolfe, the associate
dean for student affairs in the med
ical school and the primary residen
cy advisor, characterized Stanford's
residency programs as more flexible
than most for women, especially
those with families.
"I don't think it's an issue within
any Stanford residency. I think
women are accommodated very,
very nicely. Maybe it's not perfect,

but 1 really think it's quite good,"
Wolfe said.
Although women now make up
approximately 45 percent of incom
ing medical students, the vast major
ity of surgical subspecialties are still
dominated by men.
Wolfe, however, was quick to
point out that "our women medical
students are not at all discouraged
about pursuing surgical residen
cies."
The encouragement for women
medical students and residents at
Stanford is "incredible," according
to Dr. Odette Harris, a Stanford
Medical School alumna and neuro
surgery resident at the medical cen
ter.
Brandon Earp, a fourth-year
medical student interested in ortho
pedic surgery, did not think that the
surgery field's reputedly unforgiving
attitude toward women has been an

obstacle in her career planning.
"It hasn't negatively affected it at
all. Stanford's a remarkable place in
that it does strive to promote women
in medicine and surgery. It hasn't
provided any special treatment but
has certainly been very supportive,"
she said.
Earp did have one less than posi
tive experience during a residency
interview at another school. "One of
my interviewers told me that he
didn't feel women should be in or
thopedics. I chose not to rank the
program. It only hurts the program.
There are too many programs that
see women residents as an asset that
I don't need to go somewhere that
doesn't see them as an asset," she
said.
Earp, though, felt that this atti
tude was unusual. "I was surprised in
that almost all of the programs I
went to were not only not just neu

tral on whether you were a woman
or a man. Most were actively seeking
to recruit women," she added.
Wolfe noted that negative atti
tudes toward females are more
prevalent in surgical residency pro
grams. Sometimes gender discrimi
nation can hurt women's chances of
acceptance to these programs, ac
cording to Wolfe.
"But of course it's unspoken, be
cause it's illegal. But that doesn't
mean that it's not considered. Some
times. these program directors ask
women if they plan to have a child.
It's women who are asked that ques
tion rather than men. In the primary
care specialties that kind of question
is just not asked of men or women,"
Wolfe said.
Wolfe also added that most resi
dency programs still need to address
quality of life issues for physicians
who also have care-giving responsi

hilities in their personal lives.
"There isn't any question there
needs to be more aceommodation
for both men and women who
choose to either have children or
adopt children," he said.
"1 think that when women apply
to programs they carefully look at
[quality of life issues]. How nurtur
ing programs are and how respon
sive they are to the needs and issues
of women are factors that play a
role," Wolfe said.
Such issues certainly played a role
in Harris' decision to complete her
residency at the UCSF-Stanford
Medical Center after graduating
from Stanford Medical School.
"Stanford was one of the programs
that combined academic excellence
with a greater quality of life. It's one
of the reasons I stayed here," she
said.
According to a March 1 report in

The New York Times, in recent
years, many women surgeons have
elected to work part-time in private
practice or work for health mainte
nance organizations. Such arrange
ments provide a more flexible time
schedule so that doctors can make
more time for their children.
Both Harris and Earp were confi
dent that, even as busy surgeons,
they would be able to handle the de
mands of work and family.
Harris said that she and her med
ical school roommates all meditated
on how compatible certain special
ties would be with their lifestyles.
"At the time we were all single
women, and I don't know that we
didn't look ahead to consider mar
riage, children, etc. It was not so
daunting that we felt we couldn't do
it," she said.
"I think more and more women
are going into surgical specialties
and are managing to have families.
You can't have it all I guess, but you
can come pretty close," Earp said, al
though she was realistic about the ef
fect of any career on one's personal
life. "You as a physician need to rec
ognize any time you pursue a career,
you're going to have to give up cer
tain things in your personal life."
Harris emphasized that her opti
mism about balancing her profes

sional career and family life was
largely the result of her very positive
experience at Stanford.
"I don't think that my experience
is by any means the norm," she said.
"[IJ trained at a fairly liberal institu
tion that might very well have a lot to
do with it. It was a program in which
I felt I could be nurtured and sup
ported. Women trained at other in
stitutions might not have that same
kind of environment from which to
draw," she said
"It's that kind of unending sup
port that bodes well for the experi
ences of women coming out of Stan
ford," Harris added.
