on March 7. The event, held at Bechtel In
ternational Center, was attended by about 3(X)
people, including students and their families
and friends,
"The event was a great success," said doc
toral student Pankaj Gupta, president of Asha.
"We were expecting the event to be a moder
ate success, but the nature of the event gener
ated lots of response."
Asha means hope in several Indian dialects.
Proceeds from Asha's events aid children's ed
ucation projects in India.
Holi, which is the Indian festival of colors,
marks the beginning of spring and a new har
vest. The celebration is drawn from a story in
Indian mythology, in which Prahlad, the son of
the oppressive king I liranyakashyap, triumphs
over his father through the power of devotion.
"Holi is part of a big cultural festival in India

and is tied to a couple of religious stories,"
Gupta said. "The main thing about Holi is that
it's a common gathering and it's a good way to
have fun."
At the event, participants smeared one an
other with colored powder or drenched each
other with colored water, and many played
traditional Indian games such as Pidhu and
Kabaddi.
While Gupta said the event went smoothly
for the most part, some students in neighbor
ing dormitories such as Florence Moore Hall
complained of the event's loud music.
"We hope to solve outstanding issues with
the dorms [for a future Holi event]," Gupta
said.
"On the whole I'm very enthusiastic about
the event in the future."
While the event was attended mostly by In
dian graduate students, doctoral student Shri
ram Ramanathan, a member of Asha and an
organizer of Holi. said that he was pleased with
the "fair number of individuals from other
backgrounds who attended."
"We were glad we could reach out." he said.
