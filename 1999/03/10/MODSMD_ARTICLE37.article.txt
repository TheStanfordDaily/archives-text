# Toyon tree replanting fails
## 
### Abishek Bajoria Contributing writer 
A fruitless attempt to remove a
palm tree in front of the Toyon Eat
ing Clubs last Thursday resulted in a
broken tree and disgruntled resi
dents.
The tree broke, because "the
whole center of the tree was rotted
out." said Hob Murphy, the grounds
supervisor for Facilities Operations.
Toyon Hall residents were an
gered. because they "were not noti
fied of any of the changes," said
Aaron Williamson, financial manag
er of the Toyon Eating Clubs.
Deborah Canino, the architect
for the Planning Office, admitted
that "notification went to the hous
ing division," and that there "may
have been a gap" in communication
between the students and the Plan
ning Office.
This breakdown in communica

tion occured because the Planning
Office notified Glen Cartwright, the
housing facilities manager for
Toyon, but not the students directly.
It was not Cartwright's responsibili
ty to know the tree was on Toyon
Eating Club land, and therefore he
did not notify the students of the
planned removal, Williamson ex
plained.
Because of this lack of communi
cation, the eating club management
was given only live minutes to de
cide the fate of the tree. Its choices
were to allow the tree to be moved
or to have it stay and face an uncer
tain future when construction takes
place in the area in two years.
The eating club managers opted
for the former because "it's not just
a tree to us. We have a personal af
filiation to it," said sophomore Gau
rav Misra, an eating club manager.
The legality of the issue is anoth
er concern because the eating clubs

planted the tree on leased lands. The
University's ownership of the tree is
questionable.
The members of the Toyon Eat
ing Clubs planted the tree more than
50 years ago on lands leased by the
clubs.
Some students are outraged, be
cause they believe this to be a "visi
ble symbol of a deeper trend," said
sophomore Zach Montz, another
eating club manager.
"They [the administration] don't
care about Toyon and the eating
clubs," and this action is "indicative
of a general disregard for students."
Montz said.
The University Planning Office
ordered that the tree be replanted at
the intersection of Palm Drive and
Museum Way as part of the Tree
Relocation Program.
This program "relocates trees in
the path of future development pro
grams," Canino said.
