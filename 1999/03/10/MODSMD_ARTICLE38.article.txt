## 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
Stanford will buy about $115 mil
lion in bonds sold by the California
Education Facilities Authority to
fund development projects around
campus.
"This is pretty standard," said
Daniel Kingston, managing director
at Stanford Management Company,
which handles the University's inter
nal finances.
He explained that the state of Cal
ifornia offers similar bonds to other
non-state universities, and that Stan
ford had purchased about 15 similar
bonds in the past.
The interest on the bonds mav be

paid back in non-taxable, municipal
rates.
"We were approved to huv up to
$120 million, but we're thinking $115
million." said Kingston.
Kingston said the money is divid
ed into five separate bonds, with dif
ferent maturity dates. ()ne bond will
mature in 2013 and another in 2023.
"I lopefullv we'll be selling at that
point," said Kingston.
"The difference in taxable rates
and municipal rates is substantial,"
said Kingston. "T hi:; provides savings
in terms of financing future develop
ment."
Kingston said that in the past the
University has used the bonds to con
struct new buildings and renovate old

ones.
He said the University must pre
pare a list of projects for approval by
the state before it can use the bond
money to work on the projects.
Housing and Dining Services Di
rector Keith Guy said that Housing
and Dining has in the past used bond
monies as a substantial source of
funding for projects.
Kingston said the University had
plans to spend the money on improv
ing campus roads, building faculty
housing and the construction of a
new academic building, among other
things.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter will
be the senior underwriter of the debt
offering.
