## Wais revokes frat charter 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Following a turbulent year
marred by two alcohol-related
tragedies, Stanford's oldest 112 raterni
ty has been forced to shut down.
Dean of Students Marc Wais decid
ed Monday to revoke the charter of
Phi Delta Theta for the next five
years, effective immediately.
Wais" decision, which concurred
with a unanimous recommendation
from the Greek Judicial Board,
means that Phi Delt will, as he said,
"lose its official University recogni
tion and cannot exist or operate as a
University recognized student orga
nization."
Junior Jackson Wagener, presi
dent of the fraternity, said that the
decision is stirring up mixed emo
tions for the Phi Delts.
"We are definitely disappointed
that we lost the house and charter,"
he said, "but we're relieved in some
respects. We are ready to get on with
our lives and... be a part of the Uni
versity again."
Wagener added that the fraterni
ty accepted the decision.

"1 think they did what they felt
they had to do," he said.
Greek Judicial Board co-chair
Stephanie Blossom, a senior, ex
pressed satisfaction with Wais' deci
sion.
"I'm really pleased that he decid
ed to concur with the decision of the
Board." Blossom said. "It was a real
ly difficult for us to make, with a lot
of long nights, hard work and consci
entious consideration. I really feel
like it was the best decision to
make."

Two incidents cuuse serious injury
Phi Delt's troubles began last
April, when during a weekend Rush
retreat, then-freshman rushee Mike
Ternoey was seriously injured in an

alcohol-related altercation.
The incident caused Wais to place
the fraternity on a one-year proba
tion, the terms of which included a
ban on alcohol at all Phi Delt func
tions.
While still under probation,
tragedy struck the Phi Delts last Oc
tober. when senior Michael Howard
fell 20 feet from the balcony of the
Phi Delt house. He was hospitalized
in serious condition.
According to Wagener. Howard
has since made a full recovery and
plans to return to Stanford at some
point in the future. "Above all else
we are thankful for the full recovery
of our friend." Wagener said.
After investigating the incident.
University officials discovered that
Howard had been drinking at a
house gathering, which was a clear vi
olation of the probation restrictions.
Following this discovery. Wais de
cided to evict the fraternity from its
house at the end of fall quarter and
turned the house into a self-operated
house renamed 680 Lomita.
Judiciary Board reviews fraternity
The Greek Judiciary Board then
began a review of the Phi Delt char
ter to determine the future of the Phi
Delts on campus.

The 10-member board, which
consists of three students from soror
ities. three from fraternities and
three non-(ireek students nominat
ed by the ASSIJ, along with Assoc.
Dean of Students Morris Graves,
conducted a broad examination of
the issues involved.
I he board attempted to incorpo
rate considerable input from the Phi
Delts during the review, inviting all
current members as well as many Phi
Delt alumni to share their opinions.
1 lowever. Blossom described the
input actually received from the Phi
Delts as "sparse."
"We tried really hard to solicit
their opinions, but it was very diffi
cult to get them to come to board
meetings or discuss the issue with
us." she said.
' I he board focused on two factors
in making its decision: precedents set
in similar incidents involving Greek
organizations in the past, and the re
cent patterns of conduct by the Phi
Delt fraternity.
Blossom said these two factors
combined to lead the board to a
unanimous recommendation of re
vocation of the fraternity's charter.
"Willi so many pre-warnings and
precedents, it was time to follow
through" on the Phi Delts. she said.
Wais considers three factors
After receiv ing the recommenda
tion from the Greek Judicial Board

last week. Wais adopted the standard
three-step procedure for reviewing a
Greek case.
Wais first reviewed the findings
and recommendation given to him
by the board, closely re-examining
the circumstances surrounding each
of the Phi Delt incidents.
He then discussed the matter with
various University officials, seeking
their opinions and consultation.
Third, he conducted a historical
review of how Stanford had handled
similar cases in the past.
After considering these factors,
Wais settled on the five-year revoca
tion of the fraternity's charter.
"1 think that the revoking of the
charter has been carefully calibrated
to match the severity of the viola
tions," he said.
Wais also stated that his decision
leaves the possibility open for a re
turn of the Phi Delts beginning in
2(XW if the group were to "demon
strate to the University that with new
leadership it is worthy of official Uni
versity recognition."
Regional Phi Delt rep reacts
Rudy Porchivina, Bay Area re
gional president for the International
Phi Delta Theta organization, said he
was not surprised by the University's
decision.
"Our chapter placed itself in a po
sition where it was vulnerable to this
kind of action," he said.

"The conditions of the chapter's
probation were very clear, the chap
ter understood those conditions and
the end result was that they simply
couldn't abide by them," he added.
According to Porchivina, because
of this decision, Stanford "loses a link
to its past."
Phi Delta Theta is the oldest stu
dent organization on campus. It was
founded in 1891 along with the
founding of the University.
Porchivina said the fraternity has
proven to be durable over the past
century, surviving economic hard
ships and societal movements against
fraternities.
"It's unfortunate that they break
that chain of existence with this kind
of an incident," Porchivina added.
However, he indicated that Phi
Delt will attempt to return to Stan
ford.
"I don't feel like Stanford is losing
Phi Delta Theta," he said. "We have
every intention of returning with a
new group at the end of the five-year
period."
Porcivina said the international
Phi Delt group had previously de
cided to impose an alcohol-free
mandate on all its fraternities next
year.
As of July 1. 2(XX), no alcohol will
be allowed to be possessed or con
sumed on all properties owned or oc
cupied by Phi Delt chapters.
"The alcohol-free policy speaks to
a desire to return to some semblance

of the foundation and ideals on which
our group was based," he said.
The future of Greeks at Stanford
The demise of Stanford's Phi Delt
chapter leaves the University with 16
fraternities total, six of which are
housed, along with five sororities,
two of which are housed.
Student officials said that the Phi
Delt situation has important implica
tions for the remaining Greek institu
tions at Stanford.
"It really sets a standard that
Greek organizations need to make
an effort to be a part of the Stanford
community," Blossom said.
"1 thought that Phi Delt had little
if any community-building efforts...
and it adversely affected them in the
process of decision-making," she
added.
"Losing any Greek chapter...
provides a disappointment for the
Greek community at large, but 1
think this decision provides the
Greek community an opportunity to
re-evaluate the goals, ideals and val
ues that we set for ourselves," said se
nior Melissa Chud.the Inter-Sorority
Council president.
"We should now look ahead in
hopes of strengthening our Greek
community to reflect the benefits of
joining a Greek organization here at
Stanford," said senior Mike Mar
tinez, the Inter-Fraternity Council
president.

ty has been forced to shut down.
Dean of Students Marc Wais decid
ed Monday to revoke the charter of
Phi Delta Theta for the next five
years, effective immediately.
Wais" decision, which concurred
with a unanimous recommendation
from the Greek Judicial Board,
means that Phi Delt will, as he said,
"lose its official University recogni
tion and cannot exist or operate as a
University recognized student orga
nization."
Junior Jackson Wagener, presi
dent of the fraternity, said that the
decision is stirring up mixed emo
tions for the Phi Delts.
"We are definitely disappointed
that we lost the house and charter,"
he said, "but we're relieved in some
respects. We are ready to get on with
our lives and... be a part of the Uni
versity again."
Wagener added that the fraterni
ty accepted the decision.

"1 think they did what they felt
they had to do," he said.
Greek Judicial Board co-chair
Stephanie Blossom, a senior, ex
pressed satisfaction with Wais' deci
sion.
"I'm really pleased that he decid
ed to concur with the decision of the
Board." Blossom said. "It was a real
ly difficult for us to make, with a lot
of long nights, hard work and consci
entious consideration. I really feel
like it was the best decision to
make."

Two incidents cuuse serious injury
Phi Delt's troubles began last
April, when during a weekend Rush
retreat, then-freshman rushee Mike
Ternoey was seriously injured in an

alcohol-related altercation.
The incident caused Wais to place
the fraternity on a one-year proba
tion, the terms of which included a
ban on alcohol at all Phi Delt func
tions.
While still under probation,
tragedy struck the Phi Delts last Oc
tober. when senior Michael Howard
fell 20 feet from the balcony of the
Phi Delt house. He was hospitalized
in serious condition.
According to Wagener. Howard
has since made a full recovery and
plans to return to Stanford at some
point in the future. "Above all else
we are thankful for the full recovery
of our friend." Wagener said.
After investigating the incident.
University officials discovered that
Howard had been drinking at a
house gathering, which was a clear vi
olation of the probation restrictions.
Following this discovery. Wais de
cided to evict the fraternity from its
house at the end of fall quarter and
turned the house into a self-operated
house renamed 680 Lomita.
Judiciary Board reviews fraternity
The Greek Judiciary Board then
began a review of the Phi Delt char
ter to determine the future of the Phi
Delts on campus.

The 10-member board, which
consists of three students from soror
ities. three from fraternities and
three non-(ireek students nominat
ed by the ASSIJ, along with Assoc.
Dean of Students Morris Graves,
conducted a broad examination of
the issues involved.
I he board attempted to incorpo
rate considerable input from the Phi
Delts during the review, inviting all
current members as well as many Phi
Delt alumni to share their opinions.
1 lowever. Blossom described the
input actually received from the Phi
Delts as "sparse."
"We tried really hard to solicit
their opinions, but it was very diffi
cult to get them to come to board
meetings or discuss the issue with
us." she said.
' I he board focused on two factors
in making its decision: precedents set
in similar incidents involving Greek
organizations in the past, and the re
cent patterns of conduct by the Phi
Delt fraternity.
Blossom said these two factors
combined to lead the board to a
unanimous recommendation of re
vocation of the fraternity's charter.
"Willi so many pre-warnings and
precedents, it was time to follow
through" on the Phi Delts. she said.
Wais considers three factors
After receiv ing the recommenda
tion from the Greek Judicial Board

last week. Wais adopted the standard
three-step procedure for reviewing a
Greek case.
Wais first reviewed the findings
and recommendation given to him
by the board, closely re-examining
the circumstances surrounding each
of the Phi Delt incidents.
He then discussed the matter with
various University officials, seeking
their opinions and consultation.
Third, he conducted a historical
review of how Stanford had handled
similar cases in the past.
After considering these factors,
Wais settled on the five-year revoca
tion of the fraternity's charter.
"1 think that the revoking of the
charter has been carefully calibrated
to match the severity of the viola
tions," he said.
Wais also stated that his decision
leaves the possibility open for a re
turn of the Phi Delts beginning in
2(XW if the group were to "demon
strate to the University that with new
leadership it is worthy of official Uni
versity recognition."
Regional Phi Delt rep reacts
Rudy Porchivina, Bay Area re
gional president for the International
Phi Delta Theta organization, said he
was not surprised by the University's
decision.
"Our chapter placed itself in a po
sition where it was vulnerable to this
kind of action," he said.

"The conditions of the chapter's
probation were very clear, the chap
ter understood those conditions and
the end result was that they simply
couldn't abide by them," he added.
According to Porchivina, because
of this decision, Stanford "loses a link
to its past."
Phi Delta Theta is the oldest stu
dent organization on campus. It was
founded in 1891 along with the
founding of the University.
Porchivina said the fraternity has
proven to be durable over the past
century, surviving economic hard
ships and societal movements against
fraternities.
"It's unfortunate that they break
that chain of existence with this kind
of an incident," Porchivina added.
However, he indicated that Phi
Delt will attempt to return to Stan
ford.
"I don't feel like Stanford is losing
Phi Delta Theta," he said. "We have
every intention of returning with a
new group at the end of the five-year
period."
Porcivina said the international
Phi Delt group had previously de
cided to impose an alcohol-free
mandate on all its fraternities next
year.
As of July 1. 2(XX), no alcohol will
be allowed to be possessed or con
sumed on all properties owned or oc
cupied by Phi Delt chapters.
"The alcohol-free policy speaks to
a desire to return to some semblance

of the foundation and ideals on which
our group was based," he said.
The future of Greeks at Stanford
The demise of Stanford's Phi Delt
chapter leaves the University with 16
fraternities total, six of which are
housed, along with five sororities,
two of which are housed.
Student officials said that the Phi
Delt situation has important implica
tions for the remaining Greek institu
tions at Stanford.
"It really sets a standard that
Greek organizations need to make
an effort to be a part of the Stanford
community," Blossom said.
"1 thought that Phi Delt had little
if any community-building efforts...
and it adversely affected them in the
process of decision-making," she
added.
"Losing any Greek chapter...
provides a disappointment for the
Greek community at large, but 1
think this decision provides the
Greek community an opportunity to
re-evaluate the goals, ideals and val
ues that we set for ourselves," said se
nior Melissa Chud.the Inter-Sorority
Council president.
"We should now look ahead in
hopes of strengthening our Greek
community to reflect the benefits of
joining a Greek organization here at
Stanford," said senior Mike Mar
tinez, the Inter-Fraternity Council
president.
