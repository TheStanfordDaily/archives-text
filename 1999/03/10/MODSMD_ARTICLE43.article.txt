## 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
Ralph Nader will come to Stan
ford on Saturday to give the keynote
address for a conference at the Stan
ford Law School titled "Shaking the
Foundations."
"The conference was organized
by law students for law students plan
ning careers in public interest law,"
said Toni Broaddus, conference co
chair and third year law student.
Law students from across the
country will be attending the confer
ence, which is based on the Rebel
lious Lawyering Conference, a simi
lar event held at Yale Law School.
"We were so inspired by the
I a wye rs who shared t he i r expe rie nces
and their visions for social justice,
that we decided to create a similar
event on the West Coast," Broaddus
said.
Nader's speech will take place at
a.m. Six hundred people are expect
ed to attend the event, and tickets are
still available.
His speech "will focus on the

theme of the conference: progressive
lawyering for social change. As he
has a lifetime of progressive lawyer
ing experience, I am not sure how he
will narrow that topic—but 1 am
sure he will have plenty to say"
Broaddus said.
Ralph Nader is a consumer ac
tivist who has "devoted his life to giv
ing ordinary people the tools they
need to defend themselves against
corporate negligence and govern
ment indifference," according to his
biography published on the "Foun
dations" Website.
In the early '70s, he helped draft
and pass the Safe Drinking Water
Act, the Meat and Poultry Inspection
Rules and the Freedom of Informa
tion Act. His best-selling books in
clude ' Winning the Insurance
Game," "Why Women Pay More"
and "Getting the Best from your
Doctor."
I lis message, as stated on the Web
site, is: "To go through life as a non
citizen would be to feel that there's
nothing you can do, that nobody's lis
tening that vou don't matter. But to

he a citizen is to enjoy the deep satis
faction of seeing pain prevented, mis
ery avoided and injustice decline."
The conference features many
panels in addition to Nader's talk.
Topics range from "Working Pro
Bono for Social Justice" to "Starting
your own 501(c)(3)." It is aimed at
Stanford Law School students and
law students from around the coun
try who are planning careers across a
broad spectrum of public interest
work.
Two hundred fifty people are ex
pected to attend the panels over the
weekend. More than 40 students
from law schools around the country
are also coming.
"Since [Nader's] speech is sched
uled for about one hour on Saturday
morning, we hope that it will provide
an opportunity for Stanford under
grads to take a study break" Broad
dus added.
"I think having the conferences is
good for students. Undergrads who
are interested can go and learn some
thing new," said freshman Lauren In
ouye.
