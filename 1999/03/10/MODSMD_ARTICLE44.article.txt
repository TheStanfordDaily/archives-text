## Familiar foes found in West Region Stanford may meet UConn, UNC in NCAA tourney 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Whether or not people believe
that the seventh-ranked Stanford
men's basketball team has lived up
to its preseason hype — a No. 3
ranking, a Sports Illustrated cover,
countless Final Four projections
from various college hoops "author
ities" — is now beyond a moot point.
The Cardinal can look back upon
yet another milestone season, but it
won't stray far from the old cliche
that it must now focus on every sin
gle opponent or else end its season
prematurely.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Thursday: No. 2 seed Stanford (25-
6) vs. No. 15 Alcorn St. (23-6), 30 min
utes following No. 7 Minnesota (17-
10) vs. No. 10 Gonzaga (25-6) (i 1:42
a.m.). Seattle. Wash. TV: CBS.

And if that wasn't humdrum
enough for Stanford fans, then Sun
day's announcement of the NCAA
Tournament brackets should have
capped off the mundane.
The Cardinal got exactly what
was expected — the No. 2 seed in the
West Region — perhaps forever
stamping an end to the era when
Stanford teams would sweat the
bracket unveilings, praying to even
make the field.
"I think it turned out about as
well as it could have," said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery. "It's
what we wanted. 1 think it's what we
earned. I think it's what we de
served. We couldn't be happier. We
wanted to be the top seed [from] the

West."
But while the Cardinal's postsea
son positioning may have been no
surprise, the puzzle pieces that fell in
around the team did create some in
terest.
Actually, it is much more than
some interest. Most soap operas
would kill for the potential story
lines that the Cardinal may en
counter.
Though Stanford drew the low
profile Southwestern Athletic Con
ference champion Alcorn State in
the opening round, the team has the
chance of playing three much more
intriguing matches as it tries to re
turn to the Final Four.
If the Cardinal can get past the
Braves on Thursday, it has the po
tential to face a Gonzaga squad,
should it beat Minnesota in the
opening round, that will in effect be
playing at home in Seattle. The Bull
dogs, who defeated Santa Clara in
the West Coast Conference Tourna
ment championship to earn an auto
matic berth in the Big Dance, are
seen by many as being the most like
ly Cinderella team of the tourna
ment, the role that Valparaiso filled
last year.
But there's another similarity be
tween this year's Bulldogs and last
year's Crusaders beyond the fact
that both were placed in regionals
close to home.
Gonzaga point guard Matt San
tangelo might be wearing a Stanford
uniform had a Los Angeles native
by the name of Arthur Lee decided
not to join the Cardinal squad.
