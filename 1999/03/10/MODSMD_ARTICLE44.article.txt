## Familiar foes found in West Region Stanford may meet UConn, UNC in NCAA tourney 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Whether or not people believe
that the seventh-ranked Stanford
men's basketball team has lived up
to its preseason hype — a No. 3
ranking, a Sports Illustrated cover,
countless Final Four projections
from various college hoops "author
ities" — is now beyond a moot point.
The Cardinal can look back upon
yet another milestone season, but it
won't stray far from the old cliche
that it must now focus on every sin
gle opponent or else end its season
prematurely.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Thursday: No. 2 seed Stanford (25-
6) vs. No. 15 Alcorn St. (23-6), 30 min
utes following No. 7 Minnesota (17-
10) vs. No. 10 Gonzaga (25-6) (i 1:42
a.m.). Seattle. Wash. TV: CBS.

And if that wasn't humdrum
enough for Stanford fans, then Sun
day's announcement of the NCAA
Tournament brackets should have
capped off the mundane.
The Cardinal got exactly what
was expected — the No. 2 seed in the
West Region — perhaps forever
stamping an end to the era when
Stanford teams would sweat the
bracket unveilings, praying to even
make the field.
"I think it turned out about as
well as it could have," said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery. "It's
what we wanted. 1 think it's what we
earned. I think it's what we de
served. We couldn't be happier. We
wanted to be the top seed [from] the

West."
But while the Cardinal's postsea
son positioning may have been no
surprise, the puzzle pieces that fell in
around the team did create some in
terest.
Actually, it is much more than
some interest. Most soap operas
would kill for the potential story
lines that the Cardinal may en
counter.
Though Stanford drew the low
profile Southwestern Athletic Con
ference champion Alcorn State in
the opening round, the team has the
chance of playing three much more
intriguing matches as it tries to re
turn to the Final Four.
If the Cardinal can get past the
Braves on Thursday, it has the po
tential to face a Gonzaga squad,
should it beat Minnesota in the
opening round, that will in effect be
playing at home in Seattle. The Bull
dogs, who defeated Santa Clara in
the West Coast Conference Tourna
ment championship to earn an auto
matic berth in the Big Dance, are
seen by many as being the most like
ly Cinderella team of the tourna
ment, the role that Valparaiso filled
last year.
But there's another similarity be
tween this year's Bulldogs and last
year's Crusaders beyond the fact
that both were placed in regionals
close to home.
Gonzaga point guard Matt San
tangelo might be wearing a Stanford
uniform had a Los Angeles native
by the name of Arthur Lee decided
not to join the Cardinal squad.

Senior center Tim Young and the Cardinal look to repeat their run to
the Final Four.
Bryce Drew, the hero of Val
paraiso's miracle run to the Sweet 16
of the last tournament, was also
heavily recruited by Mike Mont
gomery and his staff, but he opted to
play under his father. Crusader
coach Homer Drew. Though Valpo
narrowly missed a meeting with
Stanford in the Elite Eight, Bryce
Drew did explode offensively in a
preseason game with the Cardinal.
Things can only get more inter
esting after that. Sitting in the dri
ver's seat in the West is Connecticut,
a squad that seems to have the Car
dinal's number. After destroying
Stanford in Storrs, Conn., last sea
son, the Huskies came to Maples
Pavilion without Co-Big East Con
ference Player of the Year Richard
Hamilton this year and still held off
the Cardinal.
And as if national glory and po
tential revenge with the Huskies
weren't motivation enough for
Montgomery's squad, Stanford may
meet up with the North Carolina
squad it lost to in last November's
Preseason National Invitation Tour
nament final.
"If [a chance atj revenge comes,
we'll have to take the opportunity to
beat (North Carolina and UConn],"
said senior guard Kris Weems. "But
you never know what's going to hap
pen with them because they have to
play on a tough side of their bracket
as well. But if it comes down to us
playing those two teams then hope
fully we'll get some revenge and
move on to the Final Four."

But as Montgomery and every
other coach in the tournament will
remind us constantly for the next
two weeks, there is still a first-round
game to be played.
With 12.3 points per game, guard
Reuben Stiff is the only double-digit
scorer on an Alcorn State squad that
relies heavily upon defense for wins.
Offensively the Braves have had
trouble taking care of the ball, com
mitting 564 turnovers over the
course of the season while convert
ing only 396 assists.
For the second consecutive year,
the Cardinal will boast a consider
able height advantage over its oppo
nent; only one Brave stands above 6-
foot-8. But with Jarron Collins un
likely to play due to the high ankle
sprain in his left leg, the Cardinal is
down to only senior Mark Seaton as
a front court reserve.
"We'd like to hope that we can
get Jarron back," Montgomery said.
"I would say that it's a longshot, but
it's not outside the realm of possibil
ity for Thursday night's game. But if
we don't, we've got enough person
nel to go in there and be competi
tive.
"But at this point you're going to
slick with your better players as long
as you can, because you can't afford
to look past the game that you're
playing in. And I think it's very clear
that the focus is hack on our key
players to perform."
The bench has gotten so light that
senior Peter Sauer will likely have to
play at the power forward position
at times, something he hasn't had to
do since the Cardinal gained the
Collins twins in the 1997-98 recruit
ing class.
Whether or not people believe
that the seventh-ranked Stanford
men's basketball team has lived up
to its preseason hype — a No. 3
ranking, a Sports Illustrated cover,
countless Final Four projections
from various college hoops "author
ities" — is now beyond a moot point.
