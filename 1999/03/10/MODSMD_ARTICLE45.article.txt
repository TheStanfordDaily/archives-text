# OSU shocks Cardinal, 59-45
## No.1 NCAA seed lost in poor effort 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever see.
The Stanford men's basketball team found that out the hard way on Sat
urday night. Heading into its game with Oregon State, the Cardinal had a
chance to make a push to a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament due to
losses by Auburn and Maryland earlier in the day. But the Pacific 10 Con
ference Champions were outplayed from the opening tip at Gill Coliseum
and closed out the regular season with an uninspired — or, one might say,
lonely — 59-45 loss to Oregon State.
Lonely because the Cardinal hit just one outside shot in the entire game
at OSIJ (13-14. 7-11 Pac-10). And that is not an exaggeration. Through 40
minutes of college basketball action. No. 6 Stanford (25-6, 15-3) literally
made one single jumpshot.

MEN S BASKETBALL
■ Saturday: Oregon State (13-14,7-11) 59, Stanford 45

Aside from an 18-foot three-pointer in the first half, every one of the
Cardinal's points came from a lavup or a free throw.
At a level of basketball dominated by guard play and the three-pointer,
that just wasn't going to get it done, especially not at Gill Coliseum, where
the Beavers had lost just two games all season and had knocked off two
top-10 teams in IJCLA and Arizona.
Not to mention that it was Senior Night in Corvallis, and the showdown
with Stanford was almost sure to be the Beavers' curtain call with OSU
well out of the postseason picture.
But Stanford had plenty to play for in its own right. To go with the
prospects of a top seed in the tournament, the Cardinal had learned earli
er in the day that head coach Mike Montgomery had been named Pac-1()
Coach of the Year for the first time in his 13-year career. Senior point
guard Arthur Lee and junior forward Mark Madsen also earned recogni
tion in the conference with first-team All Pac-10 honors.
But the Cardinal was simply not hungry enough for one final win and
was more set on putting a close — albeit a slightly sour one — to the regu
lar season.
After all. the team has been laboring through the grind of the regular
season schedule for four months now, and is clearly itching to get back to
the site of last year's coming-out party for Stanford basketball — the
NCAA Tournament.
"It doesn't mean anything," Lee
said. "I think we approached this
with the wrong mind-set in the first
place. We knew it didn't mean any
thing, and we played like that.
Everyone knew the game was pret
ty much academic, and it showed in
our play."
After the ballgame, through
which the Cardinal appeared to
sleepwalk, everyone was quite ready
to put it out of sight, out of mind.
And ready to get the heck out of
Oregon.
"We're not going to make a big
deal out of it," Montgomery said.
"We only lost three games [in the
Pac-10], and this is a good basket
ball team."
"We don't want to spend a lot of
time with this game," said Young,
who finished with 13 points, 14 re
bounds and four blocks. "We just
have to let this one go. We have a
great opportunity ahead of us and
we just have to let go."
The real question lurking in
background, however, was whether
the selection committee would "let
it go," and give the Cardinal a high
seed in the West Region.
The fortunate answer to that
question was yes — Stanford's Pac
-10 title was rewarded with a No. 2
seed in the West.
And it could be the Region of
Revenge.
Assuming all the higher seeds
advance, the Cardinal would have
to take down North Carolina and
Connecticut, two teams that defeat

ed Stanford earlier this season, in
order to get back to the Final Four.
Of course, as Montgomery has
said time and time again, such pre
dictions are pointless and reflect a

lack of understanding of the tour
nament.
Especially considering the two
faced nature of this Stanford team.
Some nights — at home against

Arizona or at Washington, for ex
ample — the Cardinal looked like
the best team in the nation, blend

ing a bruising inside presence with
deadly outside shooting, defensive
intensity and a glimpse of a fast
break streak.
Other nights, like Saturday in
Corvallis, Stanford appeared com
pletely flat and unable to hit water
from a rowboat.
The Cardinal couldn't buy a
bucket against Oregon State,
shooting 33 percent for the game.
The team reverted to its early-sea
son woes at the free-throw line (K of
17), and Lee got into a brief power
struggle with Montgomery and was
benched for eight minutes.
All of that was forgotten, how
ever, by Sunday afternoon when
the brackets were unveiled in
Kansas City.
Stanford is primed for another
run through the field of 64 — the
Cardinal has all the talent it takes to

get to St. Petersburg.
Now is the time to move way
past the Oregon State loss, both in
mind and in aetion. For one such
performance in the Big Dance will
send the Cardinal packing.
And at this point, there is a short
list of things Stanford is willing to
send home in a suitcase, which does
not include its title hopes. Instead,
maybe a couple of nets — one from
Key Arena in Seattle, another from
America West Arena in Phoenix.
Perhaps some Hawaiian shirts and
sunglasses for the beaches of Flori
da. And ultimately, a nice big crys
tal trophy that reads: Stanford, 1999
NCAA Champions.
