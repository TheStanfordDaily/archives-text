# OSU shocks Cardinal, 59-45
## No.1 NCAA seed lost in poor effort 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever see.
The Stanford men's basketball team found that out the hard way on Sat
urday night. Heading into its game with Oregon State, the Cardinal had a
chance to make a push to a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament due to
losses by Auburn and Maryland earlier in the day. But the Pacific 10 Con
ference Champions were outplayed from the opening tip at Gill Coliseum
and closed out the regular season with an uninspired — or, one might say,
lonely — 59-45 loss to Oregon State.
Lonely because the Cardinal hit just one outside shot in the entire game
at OSIJ (13-14. 7-11 Pac-10). And that is not an exaggeration. Through 40
minutes of college basketball action. No. 6 Stanford (25-6, 15-3) literally
made one single jumpshot.

■ Saturday: Oregon State (13-14,7-11) 59, Stanford 45

Aside from an 18-foot three-pointer in the first half, every one of the
Cardinal's points came from a lavup or a free throw.
At a level of basketball dominated by guard play and the three-pointer,
that just wasn't going to get it done, especially not at Gill Coliseum, where
the Beavers had lost just two games all season and had knocked off two
top-10 teams in IJCLA and Arizona.
Not to mention that it was Senior Night in Corvallis, and the showdown
with Stanford was almost sure to be the Beavers' curtain call with OSU
well out of the postseason picture.
But Stanford had plenty to play for in its own right. To go with the
prospects of a top seed in the tournament, the Cardinal had learned earli
er in the day that head coach Mike Montgomery had been named Pac-1()
Coach of the Year for the first time in his 13-year career. Senior point
guard Arthur Lee and junior forward Mark Madsen also earned recogni
tion in the conference with first-team All Pac-10 honors.
But the Cardinal was simply not hungry enough for one final win and
was more set on putting a close — albeit a slightly sour one — to the regu
lar season.
After all. the team has been laboring through the grind of the regular
season schedule for four months now, and is clearly itching to get back to
the site of last year's coming-out party for Stanford basketball — the
NCAA Tournament.
