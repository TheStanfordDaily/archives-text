# Women on road in NCAA seeding
## 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
Beautiful California weather, the red-clad crowd at Maples Pavilion and
two national championship banners: these are the things the Stanford
women's basketball team is used to seeing in the first round of the NCAA
tournament. Not so this year, as the Cardinal was shipped to the frigid East
Coast as a No. 7 seed. It will face No. 10-seeded Maine with host Old Do
minion playing Tennessee Tech in the other regional game.
Two years ago Stanford was upset by Old Dominion in the Final Four, a
year when the Cardinal was supposed to challenge Tennessee for the na
tional title. On Sunday the tournament selection committee gave Stanford
a chance to exact revenge, but it must first get past the Black Bears.
"It'll be hard going west to east," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "It's hard on the our bodies, but it is something we have to do. It's
the dues we pay for not playing well. My attitude is. I'm excited about who
ever we play and wherever we go."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Friday: No. 7 seed Stanford (18-11) vs. No. 10 Maine (23-6) 2:30 pin.. Nor
folk, Va., Old Dominion University.

The Cardinal (IN-11) cannot afford to look beyond Maine (23-6), a team
Stanford has never faced in its 25-year history. I he Black Hears have a po
tent offense with junior forward Jamie Cassidy leading the way.
The 6-foot-4 Cassidy was named a Street & Smith preseason Honorable
Mention All-American and was the America East C onference Player ol the
Week five times. Against Middle Tennessee State, Cassidy scored 41
points, the second time she has accomplished t hose numbers. ( 'assidy is also
high in the rankings for rebounds and blocks, filling out her status as a po
tent inside force.
Maine also has a strong player at point, junior Amy Vachon. She has the
single-season assist record for the America East Conference at 194 and is
No. 1 on Maine's career record book for assists. Vachon currently averages
over eight dishes a game, putting her at third in the nation in that category.
Stanford has its own stellar point guard, junior Milena Flores, who was
recently named to the All Pacific 10 Conference team. She led the confer
ence in assists (7.11 per game) and was second in free-throw percentage
(.790).
Not only are her numbers impressive, but Flores has become the leader
on the court for Stanford. Although the start of her season was rocky and
her play was unpredictable, she showed a marked improvement against
UCLA. Playing on the Bruins' home court. Flores schooled UCLA's Erica
Gomez, another All Pac-10 player.
Sophomore Carolyn Moos, Stanford's 6-6 center, will also be an impor
tant weapon, as the Black Bears typically outrebound opponents by an av
erage of 6.3 boards a game. Moos, along with senior guard Regan Freuen,
received Honorable Mention honors from the Pac-10, and she has im
proved dramatically this year as Stanford's go-to player inside.
Stanford as a team has taken its game to new heights after starting the
year 4-7. The Cardinal ended up third in the Pac-10, going 14-4 in a confer
ence that is sending four teams to the tournament,
