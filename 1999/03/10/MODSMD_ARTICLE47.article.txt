The Cardinal goes into the na
tional collegiate competition as de
fending champions.
After the loss of a strong senior
class last year, including two-time in
dividual NCAA Champion Tom
Wilkens in the 200-yard breast
stroke and the 400 individual med
ley, the men's swim team did not
look to have had a drastic drop in the
caliber of its swimming this year. The
men went undefeated in dual meets,
but the difficulty of winning Pac-lOs
shows the Cardinal that this year's
NCAAs will not be as easy as last's.
"Our focal point is always
NCAAs," said senior co-captain
Justin Ewers. "Every team's taper is
different, so swimming against
teams who are already tapered is dif
ficult for us."
T his year's NCAAs, held in Indi
anapolis at the Indianapolis Univer
sity / Purdue University Natatorium
on March 25-27. look to be different
— much closer and more intense.
"NCAAs are going to be a lot
closer this year, but the points are
going to be spread out more," Ken
ney said. ''It is not only going to be a
three-way battle [between the usual
ly fierce competition of No. 2 Texas
and No. 3 Auburn] because [Califor
nia and USC|are better. The quality
at the top makes a difference."
Last year, the Cardinal qualified
lb swimmers and all 16 scored lead
ing to a win and the second-largest
margin of victory ever at NC 'A As.
Senior co-captain Dod Wales is
the top returner in the both the 1(H)
freestyle and the MX) butterfly, look
ing to break Lars Frolander's
NCAA and U.S. Open butterfly
record of 45.59, set last year.
Senior l ate Blahnik is the return
ing champion in the 2(X) backstroke
and is looking to break the American
record set by Stanford's Brian Ret
tererin IWS.
The Cardinal must also defend its
2(H)- and 400-yard freestyle and 4(H)-
medley relay titles from last year,
with members of each team return
ing this year as part of the relays.
Willi the performance at this past
weekend's ultra-competitive Pac-10

Championships, the prospect looks
as if it will take more work than just
having returning champions for
Stanford to win the competition.
In Stanford's favor, only five
swimmers did not shave for Pac-lOs
and all the members of the team who
were expected to make NCAAs
were not fully tapered. For Nation
als, all swimmers will be fully tapered
and shaved, hopefully making
NCAAs the fastest meet of the sea
son.
"This type of Pac-lOs is a great
springboard going into NCAAs,"
Ewers said. "It shows that our team is
tough and won't crack. It shows that
we know how to win."
One thing that makes this
NCAAs even more challenging be
sides the higher level of competition
is that senior Matthew Pierce, the de
fending 200 butterfly champion,
stopped competing in the middle of
the season due to shoulder surgery.
Messner stepped up to take over the
event, and from his third-place finish
at Pac-lOs, it looks like he will pick up
some of the points that Pierce was
expected to score. Sophomore
Steven Brown, who placed second
this weekend in the event, will also
contribute points in Pierce's ab
sence.
