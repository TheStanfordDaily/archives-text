## Senior posts game-high 21

By the grin on her face, by the
tears in her eyes, by the hugs she
gave her mom, you could tell Regan
Freuen was making the most of her
last home game.
But mostly, you could tell by
Freuen's play on the court, where
she led the team for the second
straight game with 21 points.
"It was exciting — a lot of emo
tion," the fifth-year senior said. "It's
an experience that you can't really
prepare for until you're there."
Team captain Freuen has in
creasingly filled a go-to role on the
young team, with her bulls-eye
shooting and on- and off-court ma
turity. She has scored in double fig
ures in eight of the team's last 11
games and is sixth in the Pacific 10
Conference with a .373 shooting av
erage from behind the three-point
arc.
"I think this is a tremendous ac
complishment for this team to go
14-4 in the Pac-10. It's a real credit
to Regan as a senior," Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
On hand to make sure Freuen re
ceived her share of credit was her
family, which traveled down from
Spokane, Wash., for her final home

game. Family members joined her
at center court before the game as
the team showered her with flowers
and accolades.
"I was crying a little bit, but I was
trying to hold it back," Freuen ad
mitted. "It's a feeling that you can't
really express."
Once play began, the emotional
Freuen was all business against Ore
gon State. She catalyzed the Cardi
nal's opening minutes, when she
scored eight of the team's first 10
points.
"I was really excited at the start
of the game, and I got into a really
good rhythm," she said.
She opened the game by draining
three-pointers on consecutive pos
sessions, and then blocked a shot by
Oregon State guard Chassie Weirs
ma, leading to a three-point play by
Stanford forward Bethany
Donaphin.
The next time down the court,
Freuen took a pass from point guard
Milena Flores in for a layup and,
thanks to its lone senior, Stanford
opened a nine-point lead that it
never relinquished.
But give Oregon State coach
Judy Spoelstra credit for knowing
her enemy. Spoelstra acknowl

Maples Pavilion.
edged that her team spent much of
the week in practice preparing for
the three-point threats of Freuen
and Flores. The preparation did lit
tle good when the game began, as
Freuen went 4 of 5 from three-point
land.
"With the competition we've
played this weekend, we really
needed to battle, and that's what we
did tonight," said Freuen, who shot
7 of 11 overall.
Her other electrifying sequence
was a defensive one, coming with

less than four minutes left in the
game.
Beaver center Tanesha Wade
had the ball in the paint when
Freuen stripped it and drove the
length of the court, nine players
trailing her needlessly as she floated
in for a layup.
Oregon State guard Sissel Pierce
was dribbling the ball back up the
court when Freuen again reached in
a long arm and stole the ball, run
ning it to the Stanford basket before
putting the ball in the hands of team
mate Sarah Dimson with the crowd
on its feet.
That play gave Stanford a game
high 17 point lead, and two minutes

later the star senior left the court to
a deafening roar of cheers, claps and
whistles, led by the ecstatic Freuen
family.
Though Saturday marked the
end of Freuen's time at Maples
Pavilion, it will not be the last the
Freuen family sees of their daugh
ter's basketball career. The team
travels to the NCAA tournament
this weekend, and Mom. Dad and
the rest of the Freuen clan will be
there to cheer Regan on.
"They told me that they're going
wherever I'm going," she said with a
smile. And if Freuen has her way,
her family will still have a couple
more weeks of travel.
