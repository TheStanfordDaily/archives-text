## Senior posts game-high 21

By the grin on her face, by the
tears in her eyes, by the hugs she
gave her mom, you could tell Regan
Freuen was making the most of her
last home game.
But mostly, you could tell by
Freuen's play on the court, where
she led the team for the second
straight game with 21 points.
"It was exciting — a lot of emo
tion," the fifth-year senior said. "It's
an experience that you can't really
prepare for until you're there."
Team captain Freuen has in
creasingly filled a go-to role on the
young team, with her bulls-eye
shooting and on- and off-court ma
turity. She has scored in double fig
ures in eight of the team's last 11
games and is sixth in the Pacific 10
Conference with a .373 shooting av
erage from behind the three-point
arc.
"I think this is a tremendous ac
complishment for this team to go
14-4 in the Pac-10. It's a real credit
to Regan as a senior," Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
On hand to make sure Freuen re
ceived her share of credit was her
family, which traveled down from
Spokane, Wash., for her final home

game. Family members joined her
at center court before the game as
the team showered her with flowers
and accolades.
"I was crying a little bit, but I was
trying to hold it back," Freuen ad
mitted. "It's a feeling that you can't
really express."
Once play began, the emotional
Freuen was all business against Ore
gon State. She catalyzed the Cardi
nal's opening minutes, when she
scored eight of the team's first 10
points.
"I was really excited at the start
of the game, and I got into a really
good rhythm," she said.
She opened the game by draining
three-pointers on consecutive pos
sessions, and then blocked a shot by
Oregon State guard Chassie Weirs
ma, leading to a three-point play by
Stanford forward Bethany
Donaphin.
The next time down the court,
Freuen took a pass from point guard
Milena Flores in for a layup and,
thanks to its lone senior, Stanford
opened a nine-point lead that it
never relinquished.
But give Oregon State coach
Judy Spoelstra credit for knowing
her enemy. Spoelstra acknowl
