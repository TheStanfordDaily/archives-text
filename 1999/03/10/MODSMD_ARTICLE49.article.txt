■ Saturday: Stanford 73, Oregon
State (11-16,3-15)61.

The Cardinal (18-11,14-4 Pacific
10 Conference) committed 19
turnovers to Oregon State's 16, a
subpar performance considering the
Beavers usually commit three more
turnovers than their opponent. Ore
gon State also outrebounded Stan
ford, especially on the offensive
boards, where the Beavers Cll-16,3-

15) had nine more than the Cardinal.
"We have to improve our offen
sive execution," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "We turn
the ball over. We are not at this point
a very good passing team. Honestly,
I don't think we can go very far [in
the NCAA tournament] with our
passing."
As sloppy as the game may have
been, there were bright spots for
Stanford. The Cardinal shot over 50
percent from the field and an im
pressive 58 percent from behind the
arc.
Individuals were also strong, with
Freuen leading all scorers with 21
points. With her trademark accura
cy from three-point land, she scored
the first six points for the Cardinal
and shot 66 percent from the field.
Freuen's threes were part of a 19-
4 Cardinal run, but Stanford began
to slow down as it seemed to begin to
look past the Beavers. At one point,
Stanford had four turnovers in a

three-minute span and although the
Beavers could only get to within
nine, Cardinal players were shaking
their heads in frustration.
"I think we showed today we're
not really there yet with the mental
part of our game," said point guard
Milena Flores. "We were up by
about 14 points, and we didn't put up
the pressure. I think we actually
eased up a little bit. That was disap
pointing."
What was not disappointing was
the play of Flores. who ended the
game one rebound away from the
third triple-double in Stanford
women's basketball history. In the
first half alone. Flores had seven as
sists and no turnovers.
She finished the game with 11 as
sists, 11 points and nine boards. Her
superior court vision allowed the
Cardinal to get easy transition bas
kets and her three steals were all

taken coast to coast for lay-ins. Al
though VanDerveer knew of Flores'
statistics, she later admitted that
memories of Vanessa Nygaard tear
ing her anterior cruciate ligament in
the final game of last year's regular
season prompted her to pull Flores
with two minutes left in the game.
"In our situation, Milena already
plays so many major minutes for us,"
VanDerveer said. "If it had been a
different situation, I might have a
different answer, but I would proba
bly not. I guess I get worried about
the freak injuries I've seen."
Behind Flores's well-timed pass
es, the Cardinal continued to shoot
well in the second half, but its de
fense allowed the Beavers to im
prove from 27 percent shooting in
the first half to 55 percent in the sec
ond.
"We need solid defense," Van-
Derveer said. "We need to rebound
the ball better than we have been
and all take care of it."
Freshman center Cori Enghusen,
who came off the bench for Carolyn

Moos, was Stanford's most impres
sive defensive asset, ending the
game with four blocks. Two of her
blocks came on one play alone, as
Enghusen threw one ball out of
bounds and stuffed another Oregon
State player who dared to come in
side. To top it off, Enghusen caused
a shot clock violation as the OSU
player she was guarding was too
afraid to react and stood in fear until
time ran out.
"I think Cori has really good tim
ing and she gets the ball," Van-
Derveer said. "We don't want her
jumping up out of position, but when
we're pressuring and they drive in
there, she did a great job of seeing
the ball and going after it."
The Cardinal ended the season
by winning eight of its last 10 games,
including upsets of Oregon ,>t home
and UCLA on the road.
Stanford may have begun the sea
son 3-7, but the Pac-10season saw an
improvement in play that led to a
third-place finish in a year that was
to be a rebuilding one.
