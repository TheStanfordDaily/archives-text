# Aging faculty may hurt female, minority tenure
## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
University presidents have
warned that the rising average age
of faculty would not come without
costs. Now their words seem to be
realized.
With the federal elimination of
a mandatory retirement age, older
faculty are staying on longer, and
consequently fewer tenure and
tenure-track spots are available to
younger faculty, comprised of a
larger percentage of females and
minorities than those currently
tenured.
Stanford is taking measures to
counterbalance this effect, but no
major changes in the trend toward

older faculty seem upcoming.
It has been live years since fed
eral anti-age discrimination laws
were put into place prohibiting
mandatory retirement ages for
tenured faculty.
The warnings
In 1992 then-University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy remarked
that in the last 15 years, Stanford's
median faculty age had risen seven
years.
"A faculty that is seven years
older costs more â€” tens of millions
of dollars more," he said, warning
of the looming changes in manda
tory retirement legislation.
