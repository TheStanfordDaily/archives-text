# Aging faculty may hurt female, minority tenure
## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
University presidents have
warned that the rising average age
of faculty would not come without
costs. Now their words seem to be
realized.
With the federal elimination of
a mandatory retirement age, older
faculty are staying on longer, and
consequently fewer tenure and
tenure-track spots are available to
younger faculty, comprised of a
larger percentage of females and
minorities than those currently
tenured.
Stanford is taking measures to
counterbalance this effect, but no
major changes in the trend toward

older faculty seem upcoming.
It has been live years since fed
eral anti-age discrimination laws
were put into place prohibiting
mandatory retirement ages for
tenured faculty.
The warnings
In 1992 then-University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy remarked
that in the last 15 years, Stanford's
median faculty age had risen seven
years.
"A faculty that is seven years
older costs more — tens of millions
of dollars more," he said, warning
of the looming changes in manda
tory retirement legislation.
As Gerhard Casper assumed the
president's office at the end of
1992, he too demonstrated concern
about an aging faculty, mentioning
that an "accepted rule of thumb" is
that every senior faculty member
who declines to retire precludes the
hiring of two assistant professors.
Faculty turnover falls
.Data from the Provost's Office
indicate several changes in hiring
and retirement practices at Stan
ford since mandatory retirement
policies ended.
By 1993 Stanford had ended its
policy of mandatory retirement at
age 70. one year ahead of the feder
ally mandated 1994 deadline.
In the 1992-93 academic year,
the last year of mandatory retire
ment for faculty at age 70, 50
tenured faculty members departed
and 91 new tenured and tenure
track faculty were hired. Fifty-one
non-tenured faculty departed in
that period as well.
The most recent data, from the
1996-97 academic year, show that
21 tenured faculty members de
parted and 62 new tenured and
tenure-track faculty were hired.
Twenty-five faculty members, who
did not receive tenure or did not
have tenure-track appointments,
also departed.
The report does not detail rea
sons for departure.
These figures indicate that the

number of tenured faculty mem
bers retiring annually has de
creased in the five years since Stan
ford ended its mandatory retire
ment policy. The number of
tenured and tenure-track hires has
decreased to match, with small
variations possibly due to budget
issues.
Stanford's tenure statistics show
that the number of faculty appoint
ments generally equal the number
of departures, and approximately
one-half of tenure-track faculty are
awarded tenure.
Early retirement measures
Despite a slowing turnover, the
University has taken steps to de
crease effects of the elimination of
the mandatory retirement age.
The average age of retirement
now is 66, according to Vice
Provost for Faculty Affairs Kathy
Gillam.
She added that Stanford's annu
al turnover rate is at approximately
2 percent, similar to the figure at
other comparable universities.
"Our appointments and promo
tions have proceeded as they al
ways have," Gillam said. "Faculty
can stay and teach and do their re
search as long as they wish."
Though there is no mandatory
retirement age, faculty members
can opt for early retirement.
A task force to study retirement
incentives and related issues in the
early 1990s designed Stanford's
current early retirement program.
According to Gillam, faculty
who choose to retire early, depend

ing on their years of service and
their age, are eligible for a lump
sum payment. Many retired faculty
are recalled to active duty as pro
fessors emeriti, according to
Gillam.
Gillam said statistics on how
often faculty make use of this early
retirement program are not avail
able.
Retirement only part of puzzle
Larry Morton, director of gov
ernment and community relations,
said that, at the current faculty
turnover rate, change in the make
up of the faculty will come slowly.
"11 women and minorities got every
position, how long would it be be
fore it's 50-50?" he said.
"We don't have fewer positions
available, but we have greater un
certainty regarding when those po
sitions will be open," Gillam said.
"It doesn't have a lot to do with op
portunities for women and minori
ties."
The administration has also
made efforts to increase the num
ber of tenured positions available,
according to (iillam.
The Stanford Introductory
Studies program increases the
number of faculty positions in
schools that offer undergraduate
education, and Casper's fundrais
ing efforts have created several
presidential professorships in the
humanities.
In support of older faculty
Anthropology Prof. Cliff Bar
nett called the end of mandatory

retirement "an excellent thing/'
Harnett expressed the feeling that
older faculty members make valu
able contributions. "If you think
about aging conditions as represen
tative of all past life experiences of
individuals, [elderly faculty] have a
lot to contribute.
"I'll retire when I stop enjoying
what I'm doing and when I stop
learning from my students." said
Harnett, who would have been
forced to retire by now if mandato
ry retirement policies were still in
effect.
"We're the living history. It's
one thing to read about the De
pression and World War II; it's an
other to have someone talk to you
who was there."
Harnett disagreed that there is a
risk of retaining older faculty mem
bers who are unable to teach well.
"People don't stay on just for the
hell of it."he added.
Barnett said that Stanford
should develop a program to help
its faculty make career decisions.
While mentorship is emphasized
among junior faculty, "we forget
about it for senior faculty," he said.
Harnett will teach a course dur
ing the spring quarter on aging,
combining undergraduates and in
dividuals enrolled in the continuing
studies program.
The end of mandatory retire
ment could also be affecting the
current faculty housing crunch.
"To the degree that our faculty stay
in the area because it's such a nice
place to live, [mandatory retire
ment! ' ias an impact there," Gillam
said.
