# Baseball shines in three-game sweep of Sun Devils
## Pitching holds ASU offense in check as hitting explodes in conference-opening series 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
In an outstanding Pacific 10
Conference-opening series for No.
6 Stanford, the Cardinal got a cou
ple of stellar pitching performances,
a few well-timed home runs and the
brunt of its offensive production
from some unheralded spots in the
lineup to sweep Arizona State, 11-1,
6-5 and 11-8.
While a sweep always looms
large, it takes on even greater im

portance this season as only one se
ries against each Pac-10 team will
count toward conference standings.
"The sweep's real big," said ju
nior left-fielder Nick Day. "Every
game counts in the league now. Ari
zona State doesn't get another
chance at us this year. It puts us up
three games on them already and
they're going to be one of the best
teams in the Pac-10."
Although the three games had
very distinct personalities, all had
the same result — a Stanford win.

In Friday night's 11-1 win,
sophomore Jason Young (5-1, 2.04
ERA) turned in one of the best
showings Stanford (15-6, 3-0 Pae
-10) has ever seen on the mound.
Arizona State (19-8,0-3) came into
the game batting .366 as a team.
However, Young allowed only one
run on six hits while striking out 16
Sun Devils, the third-best total in
Stanford history.
"I felt like I had just about every
thing tonight," Young said. "I felt
like my fastball was there the whole

night and I was able to mix it all up."
His partner behind the plate
agreed.
"I can't really say enough about
his performance tonight," junior
catcher Damien Alvarado said.
"He had his curveball working
today and the past couple of outings
he hasn't had it. [The Sun Devils]
were off balance all night."
While the season is still young,
the right-hander has already begun
to establish himself as one of the top
pitchers in the Pac-10, if not the na

tion. In 53 innings, he has struck out
64 batters while only allowing 31
hits. Opponents are hitting only
.172 against Young, who has four
complete games.
His performance has been so
dominating at times that some have
begun to compare him to some of
Stanford's great pitchers of the past,
such as 1998 National Player of the
Year Jeff Austin.
"In terms of the mental ap
proach, Jeff might have been a little
further along because he was a ju
nior," said Alvarado, who caught
for Austin last year. "But in terms
of physical stuff, Jason's as good, if
not better."
Friday's game was also signifi
cant because it marked the re-emer
gence of the powerful Cardinal of
fense. Junior first baseman John
Gall, senior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang and junior center
fielder Edmund Muth each had
home runs in the blowout win.
"We've been struggling, but we
got a couple of big innings and three
home runs," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "But the key was the
pitching. [Young] pitched fantas
tic."
The Cardinal's 6-5, 10-inning
win Saturday afternoon made up
for whatever drama Friday's
blowout lacked.
Arizona State struck first, taking
a 1-0 lead off of sophomore Justin
Wayne (2-1. 5.31) in the top of the
first. However, an RBI sacrifice fly
from Gall and an RBI single from
Alvarado gave the Cardinal a 2-1
lead.
As Wayne cruised through the
next two innings, striking out five
batters in a row. the bottom of the
lineup went to work to extend Stan
ford's lead.
Alvarado, who was 7 for 14 on
the weekend, followed two Cardi

nal groundouts in the bottom of the
third inning with a two-out single.
After Muth was hit by a pitch. Day
launched a three-run home run to'
deep left-center field, his first of the
year, to give Stanford a command
ing 5-1 cushion.
Wayne continued to sail along;
until he gave up a single and a walk
to start the eighth inning. Marquess
brought in senior Tony Cogan to re :
place Wayne, but he could not
the rally. A sacrifice fly and a wil'd"
pitch allowed the Sun Devils to.

-10) has ever seen on the mound.
Arizona State (19-8,0-3) came into
