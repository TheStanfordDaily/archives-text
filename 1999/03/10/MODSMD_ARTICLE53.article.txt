# No.5 Card sets sights on tough road ahead
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Alter decisively beating three of
the best teams in the West within the
last month. No. 5 Stanford might be
content to rest on its laurels heading
into the brunt of its tough Pacific 10
Conference schedule.
However, consistent with its na
tional reputation, the Cardinal will
head to the heartland to face No. 10
Texas (16-6) and Oklahoma (11-X),
two traditional baseball powers, be
fore stopping off in Tucson for a con
ference series against Arizona (17-K)
to complete its spring break trip.
Stanford has always scheduled dif
ficult nonconference opponents,
however head coach Mark Marquess
said it is even more important to con
centrate on strengthening the sched
ule now.
With the reorganization of the
Pac-10, Stanford will no longer be
able to face other conference oppo
nents such as Arizona, Arizona State
and UCLA twice a year as it once did.
So, to increase the Cardinal's level of
competition. Marquess has added

teams like Texas this year. No. 7
Miami next year and No. 2 Florida
State the year after that.
"That's why [players] come here,"
he said. "Sometimes it may burn us
on a given year because if we're not as
strong we'll get beat up. But [a tough
schedule] is what our players want.
They are here to play the very best."

■ March 2(1-22: Stanford (15-ft. 1(1
Pacific 10 Conference) at No. 10
Texas (16-6). RADIO: K7.SI) (90.1
FM).

Last weekend the Cardinal swept
No. 17 Arizona State, the 199K
NCAA runner-up, and earlier Stan
ford (15-6,3-0 Pac-10) took two out of
three games from both USC, the de
fending national champion, and No.
16 Cal-State Fullerton.
Having established itself as the
team to beat in the Pac-10, Stanford
will seek to continue its winning ways
after a two-week break for Dead
Week and finals.
The Cardinal will first travel to
Austin. Texas, for a three-game se

rics against the Longhorns, then to
Norman, Okla., for a game against
the Sooners and finally to Tucson,
Ariz., for another three-game set.
Texas should provide the sternest
test for Stanford. The Longhorns are
always a strong presence in the Big 12
Conference and this year is no differ
ent.
Texas swept USC at home in the
first week of the season, and al
though swept by Miami when they
traveled to South Florida two week
ends ago, the Longhorns rebounded
by winning its last four, including
three last weekend at Kansas.
The Longhorns should also be a
little fresher than Stanford as Texas
will play five games in the next 12
days.
Freshman first baseman Jeff On
tiveros leads an otherwise experi
enced Texas attack. The in-state re
cruit leads the team with a .373 aver
age and five home runs.
Six other Longhorns are hatting
above .3(X) as well. Sophomore short
stop Jason Moore leads the team with
nine doubles and 24 RHIs to go along
with a healthv .338 average.

Oklahoma is not as talented as it
has been in the past. However two se
niors, Casey Bookout and Bobby
Walters, have had outstanding starts
to the season.
Bookout, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound
first baseman, is leading the team
with a .453 average, four home runs,
23 RBIs and a .781 slugging percent
age.
Walters, a right-handed outfield
er. might not be tearing up the oppo
sition like Bookout, but his early .4(K)
average and four stolen bases are not
too shabby.
The Arizona series might not be as
exciting for Stanford, as it is used to
traveling to Tucson every year. How
ever, this conference series is the
most important on the Cardinal's
spring break tour.
Though Stanford started out
quickly with its three-game sweep of
Arizona State, there is no room for a
letdown. In the ultra-competitive
Pac-10, no team is out of the chase for
the conference title.
The Wildcats started out the sea
son very well, winning 14 straight to
climb into the Baseball America
rankings. However, as Arizona has
begun to face tougher competition, it
has lost six of the last eight and
dropped out of view from the nation
al scene.
Arizona had a lot to replace from
last year's 33-23 team — the Wildcat's
lost seven starters, its two top pitchers
and its top reliever.
The lone returning starter, short
stop Keoni Deßeene, is a good foun
dation to build on. though.
Deßenne batted .349 and led Ari
zona with 68 runs last year on his way
to earning Freshman All-America
honors. The sophomore kept busy in
the summer starting at second base
next to Stanford junior John Gall oij-
Team USA.
Marquess said he plans to use the
trip to give some inexperienced pitch
ers more time on the mound. Long
outings from sophomore pitchers
Jason Young and Justin Wayne have
limited the amount of time others,
such as sophomore Brad Drew and
freshman J.D. Willcox, have seen.
Since the games against Texas and
Oklahoma do not count against Stan
ford's conference standings, they
offer Marquess a perfect opportunity
to give his young talent experience'
against quality opponents before
they have to face the opponents that
really matter.
