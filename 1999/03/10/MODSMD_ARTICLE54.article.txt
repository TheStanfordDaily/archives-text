## 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Stanford once again proved that its track success is
no lluke this weekend as the Cardinal captured a sec
ond-place trophy for the second straight year at the
NCAA Indoor Championships in Indianapolis.
Amassing 46.5 points, second only to the 65 of
perennial champion Arkansas, Stanford relied on a
balance of outstanding efforts on and off the track to
outdistance next-best Clemson by 18.5 points in the
two-day meet.

MEN'S TRACK
■ Saturday: Stanford placed second at the NCAA Cham
pionships.
■ IWarch 27-28: Stanford hosts Stanford Invitational.

■ " Last year, we kind of stumbled into second place at
indoor nationals," said Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna. "This was one of the better national meet
performances that we've ever had. It was very reward
ing."
On Friday, Stanford jumped to an early advantage
as Brad Hauser repeated as the indoor national cham
pion in the 5,(X)0 meters, and brother Brent tailed him
in second place.
With the competitors tightly packed with a mile to
go, senior Jason Balkman seized the lead momentari

ly. The pack reacted immediately. Arkansas' Sean
Kaley threw in a 58-second quarter mile in an attempt
to break the race open.
The Hausers held firm. Chasing Kaley through a
four-minute, seven-second final mile, the duo cap
tured the lead when Kaley, weary and wobbling, could
not hold on to the pace.
Brad and Brent Hauser handily defeated the re
mainder of the field, finishing in times of 13:52.79 and
13:53.44. respectively, and grabbing 18 team points in
the process. Their nearest competitor was more than
five seconds behind.
Balkman finished fifth in 13:59.19 to add another
four points for the Cardinal, while senior Nathan Nut
ter was 12th in 14:17.68.
Stanford garnered another four points in the dis
tance medley relay, as Michael Stember's stellar 2:53
1,200-meter split aided teammates Jeff Allen, Mark
Hassell and Jonathon Riley to a fifth-place finish in
9:36.99. a Stanford all-time best.
Saturday's competition heated up as Stember, who
had the fastest time in the mile preliminary heats at
3:58.87. broke the four-minute barrier for the second
time in two days with a fifth-place finish at 3:59.39.
Stanford was also the beneficiary of an outstanding
pole vault performance by Toby Stevenson. Stevenson
cleared all of his heights up to 17 feet. 10 1/2 inches in
his first attempts and had several good tries at 18-2 be-

fore settling for 4.5 team points as
he tied with Fresno State's Jim
Davis for fourth overall.
Adam Connolly came through
big on Saturday in the 35-pound
weight toss. Struggling in seventh
place before his final two attempts,
Connolly stepped up to throw the
weight a distance of 70-5, good
enough for sixth against one of the
best fields the weight throw has
ever seen. His throw was four feet
better than the performance he
gave last year to take fourth in the
event.
The Hausers returned to action
Saturday, as they joined Jonathon
Riley in the 3,000-meter race. Riley
had already run 4:05 in the mile
preliminary heats and a 4:03 1,600
to cap the distance medley relay.
Brad Hauser cruised to a fifth
place time of 7:58.13 and Riley

dove across the line for an extra
team point as he was eighth in a
personal best 7:58.52. Brent
Hauser, who fell early in the race
after a collision with another run
ner, struggled and finished 17th in
8:18.04.
Arkansas used first- and second
place finishes in the triple and high
jump, respectively, and a wealth of
strong performances in the dis
tance races to capture the title.
Arkansas has taken the indoor
championship home for 15 of the
last 16 years.
"We had a good team pres
ence," said Brad Hauser. "A cou
ple of things didn't go our way, but
a lot of things did. I'm happy with
the way we came together as a
taam."
Stanford, which has used the in
door season primarily as a tool for
outdoor preparation, will now have
a chance to rest before opening the
outdoor season on March 27 and 28
at the Stanford Invitational.
