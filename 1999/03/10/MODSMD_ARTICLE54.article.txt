NCAA Indoor Championships in Indianapolis.

■ " Last year, we kind of stumbled into second place at
indoor nationals," said Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna. "This was one of the better national meet
performances that we've ever had. It was very reward
ing."
On Friday, Stanford jumped to an early advantage
as Brad Hauser repeated as the indoor national cham
pion in the 5,(X)0 meters, and brother Brent tailed him
in second place.
With the competitors tightly packed with a mile to
go, senior Jason Balkman seized the lead momentari

ly. The pack reacted immediately. Arkansas' Sean
Kaley threw in a 58-second quarter mile in an attempt
to break the race open.
The Hausers held firm. Chasing Kaley through a
four-minute, seven-second final mile, the duo cap
tured the lead when Kaley, weary and wobbling, could
not hold on to the pace.
Brad and Brent Hauser handily defeated the re
mainder of the field, finishing in times of 13:52.79 and
13:53.44. respectively, and grabbing 18 team points in
the process. Their nearest competitor was more than
five seconds behind.
Balkman finished fifth in 13:59.19 to add another
four points for the Cardinal, while senior Nathan Nut
ter was 12th in 14:17.68.
Stanford garnered another four points in the dis
tance medley relay, as Michael Stember's stellar 2:53
1,200-meter split aided teammates Jeff Allen, Mark
Hassell and Jonathon Riley to a fifth-place finish in
9:36.99. a Stanford all-time best.
Saturday's competition heated up as Stember, who
had the fastest time in the mile preliminary heats at
3:58.87. broke the four-minute barrier for the second
time in two days with a fifth-place finish at 3:59.39.
Stanford was also the beneficiary of an outstanding
pole vault performance by Toby Stevenson. Stevenson
cleared all of his heights up to 17 feet. 10 1/2 inches in
his first attempts and had several good tries at 18-2 be-
