INDIANAPOLIS — The Stanford women's traek
team brought two All-America honors home from this
weekend's NCAA Indoor Track and Field Champi
onships held at the RCA Dome.
Redshirt sophomore Sally Glynn and sophomore
Julia Stamps both earned their fourth All-America
awards, with Glynn finishing seventh in the mile and
Stamps finishing eighth in the 3,000-meter run.
Glynn, after a fifth-place finish at the cross country
championships in November, continued to show evi
dence of her steady ascendancy to the top rung of mid
dle-distance talent.
Coming into the event with the ninth-best time in the
nation after racing the mile just once this season, Glynn
lopked great in the prelims on Friday.
><After staying off the lead through nearly the entire
race, Glynn sprinted from fifth place to first in the final
200 meters.
"I was a little nervous with about 400,200 [meters] to
go," said Glynn. "I was sitting back in fifth. It was
crowded. Yeah, [I was] a little nervous, but I've been
really working on my speed lately and so I was hoping
it would be there on the last 150."
Advancing to the final with the best time of the pre
lims (four minutes, 44.88 seconds), Glynn was primed
for a strong showing.
' Unfortunately, her speed wasn't enough to outkick
the entire field again on Saturday. Finishing in a season
best 4:43.41, Glynn, along with the entire field, was up
staged by freshmen Kate Vermeulen of West Virginia.
Vermeulen clocked in at 4:39.07.
Stamps, along with teammate Courtney Adams,
went into the 3,000 meter run with high hopes. While
Stamps was looking for her first individual title, Adams
was looking for her first All-America honor.
Stamps' tactic of leading the race early with Adams
close behind ended up hurting both of them in the long
run. After leading for most of the first nine laps. Stamps
was passed by Carrie Tollefson of Villanova.
While Stamps hung on until a half-mile to go. it was
clear that setting the pace early had tired her as she held
on for an eighth-place finish in 9:26.27.
The eight-time Ail-American Tollefson's time of
9:15.05 was the best in the country this season. Adams
finished 15th.
The Cardinal now looks to the outdoor season
where it hopes to send a larger contingent to the
NCAAs with help from distance runners Mary Cobb
and Sarna Renfro as well as heptathlete Tracye Lawyer
and pole-vaulter Melissa Feinstein.
'Head coach Vin Lananna feels the team earned
valuable experience this weekend that will help in the
outdoor season, the season which Lananna puts a much
bigger emphasis on.
"For the women, [the NCAA indoor champi
onships] is more of an individual thing and 1 think that
it's really tough to come into a situation where you are
waiting around to run and it's not a team thing," Lanan
na said.
"I think they competed well. It's very good competi
tion. Sally made incremental steps. I think it's great that
Courtney is here at the NCAAs and we're just going
from there."
