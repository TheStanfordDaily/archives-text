# UMass, Pac-10s on horizon
## 
### Ramona Shelburne Staff writer 
For most Stanford students, the next two weeks —
Dead Week and Finals Week — are a time for study,
where all other cares take a back seat to academic con
cerns.
Members of the No. 15 Stanford women's gymnas
tics team (8-3 overall. 4-2 Pacific 10 Conference) do not
have such a luxury.
In addition to handling all of their academic respon
sibilities, the Cardinal gymnasts will compete both this
Friday night at home against Massachusetts (9-4 over
all) and then travel to Corvallis, Ore., for the Pacific 10
Conference Championships on March 20th.

And although the schedule may seem daunting, the
situation is nothing new to the returning members from
last season's squad who won the first-ever conference
title in school history.
"This down week was helpful for us to get healthier
and to get caught up academically," said Stanford head
coach Mark Cook. "It's a definite disadvantage to have
Pac-lOs after finals week although we did win them last
year when we were fatigued."
But before the Cardinal can start thinking about a
second-consecutive Pac-10 crown, it must first focus in
on defeating the Minutewomen who come to town
boasting two 1998 Northeast Regional individual

champions — Mandy Mosby and Jill Fisher.
Although the Minute women have some solid indi
vidual performers, the Cardinal has more overall talent
and depth and should make quick work of the Minute
women. But considering that two of Stanford's three
loses this year have come to unranked opponents, the
Cardinal needs to be careful not to overlook the Min
utewomen.
After Friday night's meet against UMass, the Cardi
nal will begin preparations for conference champi
onships.
Besides the possibility of repeating as Pac-10 cham
pions. the meet will provide Stanford with an opportu
nity to avenge two of its three losses on the season. Al
though Stanford has defeated perennial conference
powerhouses like No. 7 Arizona State, No. 17 UCLA
and No. 13 Oregon State this year, its two conference
losses have come at the hands of the unranked Wash
ington and Arizona squads.
The conference championship will also provide a
stage for individual C ardinal gymnasts to shine. Sopho
more Jen Exaltation is currently ranked 10th national
ly and second in the Pac-10 (9.8562) on the balance
beam. Exaltacion is also the Cardinal's best hope in the
all-around competition (38.8250) where she is ranked
third in the Pac-10.
Senior Amy Murakami has excelled for the Cardi
nal all year on the uneven parallel bars and is currently
ranked fourth in the Pac-10 (9.8375). Murakami had
won four consecutive uneven bar competitions before
losing Feb. 26th in Arizona.
Also, sophomore Jenny Wilson looks to be Stan
ford's best hope in the vaulting competition. Wilson is
currently ranked 25th nationally and third in the Pac-10
on the vault with a 9.8062 average.
