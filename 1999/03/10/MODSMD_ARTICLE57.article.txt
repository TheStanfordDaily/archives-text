Three Stanford wrestlers were left standing after
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships and are
headed to Penn State March 19-21 to compete in the
NCAA tournament.

WRESTLING
■ March 18-20: NCAA Championships, 11 a.m., Penn
State.

"The tournament is huge," said junior captain Zach
Zimmerer, a qualifier at 133 pounds. "There is a lot of
hype and all the best wrestlers in the country are
there."
Joining Zimmerer are fellow captain senior Beau
Weiner (157) and junior Rudy Ruiz (125). All three
wrestled well and captured second place at Pac-lOs to
qualify for nationals.
The most surprising member of the group is Ruiz,
who entered the Pac-lOs with a 13-13 record and was
unseeded in a tough weight bracket that included three
nationally ranked wrestlers. Despite being a national

qualifier last season, Ruiz was not projected to be in
the finals.
However, Ruiz surprised everyone with his highest
finish of the season and looks forward to another shot
at nationals. His success against ranked opponents and
experience gained this season should quell lingering
doubts about his possible success.
"Last year, 1 felt a bit out my league on the mat and
just lucky to win a couple of matches," Ruiz said. "This
year, I've finally beaten some ranked opponents and I
feel like a serious contender for Ail-American hon
ors."
"Rudy looked great at Pac-lOs and knocked off
guys with very good chances at being All-Americans,"
Zimmerer said. "People will know who they are
wrestling when they draw him."
Like Ruiz, Weiner entered this year's Pac-lOs un
seeded and was able to upset No. 17 Darryl Christian
of Oregon and No. 20 Eric Jorgensen of Oregon State
on his way to the finals. Weiner finishes his career with
four top-five finishes at Pac-lOs and looks ahead to his
second trip to the national tournament.

Junior Rudy Ruiz, who entered last weekend's Pac-10s unseeded, finished in second place.
"Beau has the added incentive
of this being his final year to do well
at nationals," Ruiz said. "With the
intensity he continues to show on
the mat, I am sure he'll put forth a
performance he'll be proud of."
Weiner looked solid in the final
stretch of the year, winning the All-
California Invitational on Feb. 6
and finishing with a 22-7 record.
Weiner is an outside contender for
All-America honors, but if he
shows the consistency and intensity
he had in the last part of the season,
he will be on the minds of the op
position.
Zimmerer enters this year's na
tionals with his best shot at becom
ing an All American by placing in

the top eight. Zimmerer is a three
time qualifier and his experience at
the national level will be a factor
this time around.
"The first time at nationals, the
whole thing is pretty overwhelm
ing," Zimmerer said. "If you are
not used to seeing wrestling on the
national level it is pretty easy to get
distracted."
Zimmerer finished the season
with 22-5 record and ranked 16th
nationally. He has looked impres
sive all year, finishing first in two
tournaments, and has shown the
veteran poise and experience
needed to compete well at nation
als.
"I feel a lot more at home when
I go to nationals, but the butterflies
will always be there, but overall, I
feel really confident this year and I
am ready," Zimmerer said.
