Three Stanford wrestlers were left standing after
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships and are
headed to Penn State March 19-21 to compete in the
NCAA tournament.

■ March 18-20: NCAA Championships, 11 a.m., Penn
State.

"The tournament is huge," said junior captain Zach
Zimmerer, a qualifier at 133 pounds. "There is a lot of
hype and all the best wrestlers in the country are
there."
Joining Zimmerer are fellow captain senior Beau
Weiner (157) and junior Rudy Ruiz (125). All three
wrestled well and captured second place at Pac-lOs to
qualify for nationals.
The most surprising member of the group is Ruiz,
who entered the Pac-lOs with a 13-13 record and was
unseeded in a tough weight bracket that included three
nationally ranked wrestlers. Despite being a national

qualifier last season, Ruiz was not projected to be in
the finals.
However, Ruiz surprised everyone with his highest
finish of the season and looks forward to another shot
at nationals. His success against ranked opponents and
experience gained this season should quell lingering
doubts about his possible success.
"Last year, 1 felt a bit out my league on the mat and
just lucky to win a couple of matches," Ruiz said. "This
year, I've finally beaten some ranked opponents and I
feel like a serious contender for Ail-American hon
ors."
"Rudy looked great at Pac-lOs and knocked off
guys with very good chances at being All-Americans,"
Zimmerer said. "People will know who they are
wrestling when they draw him."
Like Ruiz, Weiner entered this year's Pac-lOs un
seeded and was able to upset No. 17 Darryl Christian
of Oregon and No. 20 Eric Jorgensen of Oregon State
on his way to the finals. Weiner finishes his career with
four top-five finishes at Pac-lOs and looks ahead to his
second trip to the national tournament.
