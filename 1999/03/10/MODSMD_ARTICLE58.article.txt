# Women falter in 10-8 loss
## 
### Jeff Cooper Editorial staff 
Led Zeppelin's "Custard Pie"
was blaring out of the speakers
above New Maloney Field Sunday
afternoon as the Stanford women's
lacrosse team took the field against
Duquesne.
Sixty minutes later, though, an
other Led Zeppelin great —
"When the Levee Breaks" —
might have been more appropriate.
The Lady Dukes (1-0) used a
nine-goal second half, including six
unanswered goals at the close of
the game, to storm back against the
Cardinal (3-2, 3-1 Western
Women's Lacrosse League) and
secure a 10-8 victory after falling
behind 6-1 at halftime.
"Obviously, we had a major
mental breakdown," said Stanford
head coach Heidi Connor. "We
just mentally shut down after estab
lishing a comfortable lead in the
first half and never really came out
to play the second half with the
same intensity."
The Cardinal looked as com
fortable as it has all season in the
first half, despite slow offense dur
ing the first 20 minutes. The Stan
ford defense smothered the
Duquesne offense up and down t he
field, pursuing the Lady Dukes
both in transition and near the goal.
With six minutes, 30 seconds left
in the half, Stanford had ground
ahead to a 2-1 lead, but Duquesne
seemed very much still in the game,
as the Cardinal was unable to find
good shots against a tenacious
Lady Duke defense.
With junior Hedy Born's goal at
6:10 widening the lead to 3-1,
though, the floodgates opened for
Stanford. In the next six minutes,
the Cardinal poured in three more
goals, from senior co-captain Alex
is Patrizio, sophomore Katharine
Barnes and senior co-captain
Carey Jones.
Jones' goal in particular show

cased Stanford's domination of the
transition game; with 12 seconds
left in the half, the women put on a
passing clinic, with junior Christina
Gilyutin and sophomore Kate
Reilly working the ball upfield to
freshman Caroline Osterwise, who
dumped it off to Jones for the assist.
The second half was a different
story, though.
The Lady Dukes played a far
cleaner game in the second than
they had in the first, slipping cuts
behind the Stanford defense and
effectively isolating attackers
against Tuerk.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ Sunday: Duquesne (1-0) 10, Stan
ford (3-2, 3-1 Western Women's
Lacrosse League) 8.
■ Saturday: Stanford vs. Holy
Cross, 1 p.m.. New Maloney Field.

"I think they definitely raised
their intensity, but I don't think
that's what won the game for
them," said Barnes. "1 definitely
think it was our lack of intensity
that allowed them to win."
The dam began to break for the
Cardinal with 15:36 remaining,
when the Lady Dukes Meghan
Hungate drilled a running goal past
Tuerk to cut the Stanford lead to 7-
3. Over the next 10 minutes,
Duquesne added six more goals de
spite a brilliant goal by Stanford
freshman Jenny Silverman, to take
a 9-8 lead. That 10 minutes includ
ed four goals in two and a half min :
utes.
Stanford's defensive intensity,
low to start the half, fell off com
pletely by the end. and the final
blow — a Hungate goal off a foul at
1:34 — demoralized the Cardinal.
The stagnant offense failed to push
through the energized Duquesne
defenders and the game ended be
fore a Barnes shot could enter the
net.
"I think we reallv need to learn

how to play 60 minutes of lacrosse,
how to keep up the intensity," said
Silverman.
The difference between Sun
day's loss and Saturday's 1 6-0 drub
bing of St. Mary's (0-3) at New
Maloney was radical.
"We're sort of struggling with
some hot and cold issues right now
— going from not much competi
tion to having to step it up," said
Connor. "We had two easy games
in a row against Santa Clara and St.
Mary's. [ Those games] were blow
outs, truly not the type of prepara
tion you need for the tough
games."
Osterwise agreed. "It's hard not
to play down to some other teams'
level," she said. "We need to play
with as much intensity as we had in
the first half, and hold it for 60 min
utes, not just 30."
The Lady Dukes are only the
first of a tough series of non-league
games for Stanford. The Cardinal
will go up against Holy Cross Sat
urday and Johns Hopkins March
19. both at home.
For Holy Cross, the Stanford
game will conclude a spring break
trip in which the Crusaders play
UC-Davis, California, the Cardinal
and Marist in the span of four days
from March 9-13. Holy Cross went
5-10 last year and finished last in
the Patriot League, but it defeated
UC-Davis at the Aggies' home
field last year, 8-4.
In that same trip, the Crusaders
also trounced UCLA 17-8 and beat
UC-Santa Barbara 12-9. For Holy
Cross head coach Paul Ramsey, the
win over the Gauchos was especial
ly sweet; Ramsey coached UC-
Santa Barbara for three seasons
from 1990 to 1992. In his time there,
he piled up a 46-7 record and led
the team to two Western Women's
Lacrosse League championships in
1991 and 1992.
Patriot League 1998 Rookie of
the Year Jen Amendola will help
lead the attack for Holy Cross, as
will senior Molly Buckley, who had
25 goals in 15 games last season.
The Johns Hopkins game will be
particularly interesting to evaluate

the women in a national context.
Johns Hopkins, a school known for
over a century as a men's lacrosse
powerhouse, is beginning its first Di
vision I season ever, but it'll be well
prepared to face the Cardinal. The
Blue Jays made it to the Division 111
national quarterfinals last year and
went 3-1 against Division I schools
in the season.
