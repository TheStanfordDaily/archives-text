## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
After sweeping through the weekend with two wins,
the Stanford women's water polo team secured its No. 2
national ranking and set the stage for success in the second
half of its season.
In Saturday's Big Splash match against the California
Golden Bears. Stanford took control in the first minute of
play and dominated the entire game, in spite of Cal's
home-pool advantage.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: No. 2 Stanford (11-2, 4-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) 4, California (2-1,2-1) 2.
■ Sunday: Stanford 14, Pacific (1 -2,0-2) 2.
■ March 20: Stanford vs. San Jose State, 12 p.m.,
deGuerre Pool.

"Our goal was to establish our defense and our coun
terattack early in the game," said Stanford head coach
John Tanner. "They have an explosive offense with good
shooters and a good counter attack. But by slowing down
their offense we were able to diffuse a lot of the energy of
the crowd."
Although Cal is usually charged up for its games
against the Cardinal, the Bears were never able to gain
momentum — or the lead — during the match.
"We expected them to come out playing hard because
they're always emotionally charged at the beginning of
our games," said sophomore Hilary Gallogly. "But we
outplayed them from the start. We took control in the first
minute and that killed their buoyancy. Emotionally, we
controlled the game from then on."
With a goal in each quarter, Stanford led Cal 2-0 at half
time. In the third quarter, Cal closed the lead with an early
goal, but the Cardinal answered with two goals of its own
and outscored the Bears 2-1 in the period.

"They scored a goal, but we answered right back," Tan
ner said. "That's critical for us to get back our two-point
lead. With a 4-1 lead at the end of the third quarter, we
were in a comfortable position."
Cal's defense was able to hold the Cardinal scoreless in
the final period, but Stanford still came away with a 4-2
win.
"We had a really intense counterattack all four quar
ters, especially at the end. That really killed them." Gallo
gly said.
Heading into the game, Stanford and Cal were tied for
the No. 2 spot in the national rankings. However, the Car
dinal victory should give it the lone claim to that rank.
Although the score remained low, Stanford's goals
were evenly distributed between sophomores Gallogly,
Anne-Marie Keenan, Kris Koblik and freshman Margie
Dingeldein.
Senior goalie Heather Crary had an outstanding game
for the Cardinal, notching 10 saves in the match and lead
ing her team's solid defensive effort.
"Heather played great in the goal." Tanner said. "She
made a couple of saves when we were down on 5-on-6.
And at one point she made a save when we were down 4-
on-6. That was a critical point in maintaining our compo
sure and keeping their offense in check."
The all-around defensive effort by the Cardinal was in
strumental in shutting down Cal's typically aggressive and
formidable offense.
"Our defense worked really well. We were denying
their shooters scoring opportunities," Gallogly said.
And Stanford's tight defense forced Cal into making
critical mistakes which cost them many potential goals.
"Our defense frustrated them into throwing up low
percentage shots," Tanner said.
The Cardinal's impressive showing on Saturday puts
Stanford at 2-1 in head-to-head competition with its Bay
Area rival. On Feb. 28. the Cardinal defeated Cal 5-3 in
the semifinal match of the UC-Santa Barbara tourna
ment. One week earlier, Stanford fell to Cal in a 6-3 deci
sion in the semifinal game of the UC-San Diego tourna

ment.
After Saturday's highly charged match, Stanford trav
eled to Pacific for another Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation game. In spile of the fact that the Cardinal put in such
an intense performance against Cal, Stanford still had
enough energy to down the Tigers 14-2.
"UOP had only played two games [this season] so they
weren't really prepared," Tanner said. "They have a cou
ple of really good shooters and they'll get better. They just
haven't played that many games."
The Cardinal offense was led by sophomore Dani Bell,
who scored four goals. Senior Lindsay Tam, junior Elissa

Keszler. sophomore Kelly Shouey and Dingeldein added
two points apiece. Koblik and freshman Kate Pettit each
contributed one goal.
Crary held the Tigers scoreless in the first half of play
and tallied four saves. Sophomore goalie Alii Henry took
over in the second half, allowing just one goal in each of
the remaining periods. Henry also collected five saves dur
ing the match to help close the 14-2 decision.
This weekend's performance improves Stanford's
record to 11 -2 overall and 4-0 in the MPSF.
The Cardinal continues its season with a home game
against San Jose State at noon March 20.
