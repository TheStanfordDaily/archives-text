# Philosopher Nehamas explores beauty, reason

Is beauty an individual or a collective no
tion?
This was one of the many questions ex
plored by philosopher Alexander Nehamas
on Monday in the final Presidential lecture of
winter quarter, "The Sleep of Reason Pro
duces Monsters."
Yesterday Nehamas followed up on his
lecture with an open discussion at Pigott Hall
as well as a book-signing at the Stanford
Bookstore.
Nehamas holds professorships in humani
ties, philosophy and comparative literature
at Princeton University and is also the chair
of the school's Council of the Humanities.
His publications include books on Plato,
Socrates and Nietzsche.
Asst. Philosophy Prof. Lanier Anderson
introduced Nehamas to a crowd of students,
faculty and members of the public. "Ne
hamas reminds us that there is something
valuable about the life we have chosen pro
fessionally as a life, not just a way to make a
living."

Nehamas' Monday lecture explored the
relationship between reason, rationality and
imagination, using Goya's painting, "The
Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters," as a
metaphor.
In the painting the artist — representing
reason — is asleep and around him goblins
and monsters are leering about, symbolizing
imagination. The only "calm" influence is a
lynx, an image of rationality, that stares
straight ahead and is unaware of the chaos
behind him.
Nehamas argued, "The sleeping artist and
the watching lynx are in the end one and the
same." He said the sleep of reason leads to a
lack of imagination and that ideally the lynx
would close his eyes and the artist would
awaken.
This action would allow a synthesis of rea
son and imagination. "It is only when [reason
and imagination] work together that either
one is awake," Nehamas explained.
"Reason and imagination apart produce
monsters. Together they create beauty," Ne
hamas noted.

Philosopher Alexander Nehamas spoke to a full audience at the Law School at this
quarter's last presidential lecture.
For Nehamas beauty involves
finding something aesthetically ap
pealing. a judgment that cannot be
explained. Unlike Kant's notion of
a universal beauty, Nehamas ar
gued that beauty and aesthetics can
only be based on personal assess
ment.
Still. Nehamas explained that al
though beauty ideals are specific to
a particular person, the hope is that
a community of people will find
similar aesthetic appeal in a com
mon context.
I o illustrate his point, he used a
variety of examples from popular
culture, including the novel "Magic
Mountain" by Thomas Mann and
characters on the television shows
"Frasier" and "Ally Mcßeal."
Finally, Nehamas emphasized
the idea that through judging a
work of art. an individual has the
hope to lind something more within
the piece. Nehamas called the indi
vidual's assessment "a guess, a sus
picion, a dim awareness that there is
more in the work ... to learn."
Such hope for greater insight
comes from the combination of
aesthetics that comprise an individ
ual.
"The promise of happiness is
happiness itself," Nehamas con
cluded.
