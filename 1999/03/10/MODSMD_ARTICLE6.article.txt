Is beauty an individual or a collective no
tion?
This was one of the many questions ex
plored by philosopher Alexander Nehamas
on Monday in the final Presidential lecture of
winter quarter, "The Sleep of Reason Pro
duces Monsters."
Yesterday Nehamas followed up on his
lecture with an open discussion at Pigott Hall
as well as a book-signing at the Stanford
Bookstore.
Nehamas holds professorships in humani
ties, philosophy and comparative literature
at Princeton University and is also the chair
of the school's Council of the Humanities.
His publications include books on Plato,
Socrates and Nietzsche.
Asst. Philosophy Prof. Lanier Anderson
introduced Nehamas to a crowd of students,
faculty and members of the public. "Ne
hamas reminds us that there is something
valuable about the life we have chosen pro
fessionally as a life, not just a way to make a
living."

Nehamas' Monday lecture explored the
relationship between reason, rationality and
imagination, using Goya's painting, "The
Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters," as a
metaphor.
In the painting the artist — representing
reason — is asleep and around him goblins
and monsters are leering about, symbolizing
imagination. The only "calm" influence is a
lynx, an image of rationality, that stares
straight ahead and is unaware of the chaos
behind him.
Nehamas argued, "The sleeping artist and
the watching lynx are in the end one and the
same." He said the sleep of reason leads to a
lack of imagination and that ideally the lynx
would close his eyes and the artist would
awaken.
This action would allow a synthesis of rea
son and imagination. "It is only when [reason
and imagination] work together that either
one is awake," Nehamas explained.
"Reason and imagination apart produce
monsters. Together they create beauty," Ne
hamas noted.
