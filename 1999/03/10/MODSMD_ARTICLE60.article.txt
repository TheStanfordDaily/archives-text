# Crary's success blossoms from roots on the Farm
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
Senior Heather Crary is a part of
the Stanford tradition of excellence in
more ways than one.
Crary grew up just miles away
from campus. She's been to almost
every football game since she was
seven years old. Her grandfather,
Sherman Crary, played football for

the Cardinal in 1929. Now, as a senior
co-captain of the Stanford women's
water polo team, Crary represents
the best Stanford has to offer in the
way of athletics, academics and most
of all — leadership.
"1 always felt like [Stanford] was
my school and 1 belonged here,"
Crary said. "I wanted to go to Stan
ford, wherever it was, and it just hap
pened to be near home."

Now Crary is filling her role as a
successful scholar-athlete and wear
ing the Cardinal colors with pride.
"She loves playing polo, she loves
Stanford athletics and she just exudes
pride in her role," said Stanford head
coach John Tanner. From Crary "you
get the sense that it's an honor to be a
part of the Stanford tradition."
Crary is so happy with life and
sports at Stanford that she gave up

the chance to play with the U.S.
Women's National team to finish out
her senior year.
"I was on the [national] team for
about five days," Crary said. "But 1
would have had to miss my senior
yean 1 just wanted to move on and
[playing with the U.S. team] didn't fit
in with my schedule."
But more importantly, the Na
tional team couldn't take the place of
the Stanford squad in Crary's heart.
"That team is nothing compared
to the Stanford team," Crary said. "I
get great friendships and people I re
ally like to be with all the time. The
National team was more like a job. If
I'm going to spend this much time
doing something, it has to be fun."
Crary said her New Year's resolu
tion every year is to "make sure I'm
always having fun." But that's not to
say that having fun interferes with
Crary's dedication to winning.
"I love to win, but the main part is
the team and I'd do anything for this
team. It's about being able to share
both victories and losses with your
team. The games are only fun be
cause of who you're playing with and
this is the best team I've ever been
on."
Crary contributes quite a bit in
and out of the water toward making
her team so good.
"I'm a more silent, strong, 'back
bone in the water' type of captain.
[My teammates] know they can look
to me because I've always been that
reliable person in the background."

Her calm, solid and consistent atti
tude and performance provide a
locus of confidence and stability for
the team.
"People admire Heather's calm
ness," Tanner said. "She's not some
body who leads cheers or is very
vocal. But when she says something
her words are carefully chosen."
And the message seems to be get
ting across because Crary has defi
nitely instilled her teammates with
confidence and admiration.
"Heather is solid as a rock," said
senior Nicole Glazer. "It's especially
fitting she's the goalie because she's
the last line of defense. She's always
back there to support you, both in
and out of the water."
Crary also works hard to create an
open atmosphere on the deck.
"We have a lot of distinct person
alities on this team," Crary said.
"And 1 think its important to have an
open arena where you can act the way
you want to act and say what you
want to say."
For Crary, that also translates into
doing what you want to do in life, no
matter what anyone else says.
"There's no reason to suffer
through something you don't like just
because someone wants you to or be
cause you think you should," Crary
said. "If you're not enjoying some
thing and it's not making you happy,
you should find what you love."
And in whatever she chooses to do
in the future, there's no doubt that
Crary will be a success.

"Heather is good at everything
she does," Tanner said. "She's suc
cessful in everything she sets out to
do."
But Crary's most successful role is
the one she fills as a dependable
friend and leader for the people in her
life.
"She'll always be a person that
others strive to be like because she ex
cels in all areas," Glazer said. "I tell
her she's my hero, and 1 think that's
true of a lot of people."
Besides being a hero for her team
mates, there's one particular legacy
Crary will leave the team with that
sums up her love of fun and her dedi
cation to excellence — the freshman
initiation synchronized swimming
routine performed during the men's
Big Splash match against Cal.
Crary though up the stunt her
sophomore year and it has been a tra
dition ever since.
"I hope it continues because of
what it stands for," Crary said. "It's
the initiation onto the team. It's the
first thing that really gets the fresh
men to be a part of the team and of
what's going on. But there's also the
fun aspect of it."
Crary will leave the program with
some perspective of her own.
"I'm going to miss spending so
much time with people I love so
much. After these four years. I know
just what dedication, hard work and
an awesome group of people can ac
complish. And I hope wherever I go I
can always have something like that."
