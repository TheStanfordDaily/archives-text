■ Wednesday: Stanford placed 10th at the
Southwestern Invitational.

Both teams will be in action over spring
break as the crucial part of the golf season and
the run toward the NCAA championships
begin.
Coming off a strong sixth-place showing at
the Arizona Invitational on Feb. 22-24 with
help from sophomore Hilary Homeyer's 10th
place finish, the Cardinal and second-year head
coach Caroline O'Connor are primed for a suc
cessful spring season. Currently ranked seventh
in the nation, the team is looking to improve on

last season's school-record-tying fourth-place
finish at the NCAA championships.
Over the break, the squad will travel to the
Kaneohe Klipper Golf Club on the Hawaiian is
land of Oahu, where the women will compete in
the Rainbow Wahine Invitational hosted by
Hawaii from March 23-25.
The Cardinal has high hopes for the upcom
ing season, but will face a series of tough chal
lenges. Contenders for the top ranking include
perennial favorites No. 1 Arizona and No. 8
Arizona State. The Sun Devil squad is high
lighted by Grace Park, the reigning United
States Golf Association Women's Amateur
Champion.
Other top teams include IJSC, which fea
tures defending NCAA Champion Jennifer
Rosales, and Duke, led by Jenny ( hausiriporn,
runner up for the IJSGA Women's Open title.
The Stanford team is anchored by Homeyer
and fellow sophomore All-American
Stephanie Keever, both ranked among the top
individuals in the nation at the start of the year.

The pair have traded off between the No. 1 and
No. 2 spots on the team during the early season
and look to lead the Cardinal to a strong show
ing as the year continues.
Like Homeyer, Keever has started the year
off strong with a fifth-place finish at the
SMI J /OSIJ Regional Challenge in early Feb
ruary and a tie for 14th in Arizona.
Rounding out the Cardinal lineup are
sophomores Jessica Belskis and Lauren
Robertson and juniors Jae Jean Ro. Michelle
Sperry and Julie Dunn.
The men's golf team will use the break to
tune up for the spring slate of tournaments.
From March 22-23 the Cardinal will travel to
l urlock. Calif, for the Stevinson Ranch Invita
tional followed by a March 29 trip to Coto de
Caza for the Anteater Invitational hosted by
UC-Irvine.
Entering coach Wallv Goodwin's 12th sea
son on the Farm, the team is looking to recap
ture the form that won the Cardinal an NCAA
championship in 1994.

The Cardinal is fresh off a lOth-place finish
at the Cleveland Golf Southwestern Intercolle
giate played March 1 and 2 in Westlake Village,
Calif. The low Stanford score for the tourna
ment was posted by senior Joel Kribel who fired
a three-under-par 210 to finish fourth.
The team is led by Kribel, a two-time first
team All American who began the season
ranked fifth nationally and has fallen to ninth.
Having competed as an amateur in the Mas
ters and the U.S. Open, America's two most
prestigious professional tournaments, Kribel
is regarded as one of the nation's top colle
giates. He also captured the individual
medalist honor during the stroke-play por
tion of the 1998 Men's U.S. Amateur Cham
pionships
Looking to build on Kribel's leadership and
experience, the team also features sophomore
Jimmy Lee, who finished in a tie for 18th at the
Southwestern, along with juniors Dusty Brett
and Tylar Lunke and sophomore Eric
Dahlberg.
