ming team wowed home fans this
past Saturday at deGuerre Pool.
The seven-woman team swept
the Western Regional Champi
onship meet against California, tak
ing top honors in al! four events and
the top two spots in trio and duet.
The trio of Shannon Montague,
Paige Freiheit and Lindsey Wiggin
ton took first place, with teammates
Emi Kanayama, Julie Enos and
Kristi Wright finishing second. In the
duet event, Wigginton and Vanessa
Shaw took first place and Montague
and Freiheit paired up to take sec
ond. Shaw also showed her grace and
technique by wowing the crowd with
her solo performance.
The highlight of the meet though,
was the •seven-woman team routine.
Swimming to a theme of Herculean
triumph, the Cardinal demonstrated
why it is the reigning national cham
pion.
The routine opened with senior
Kanayama being thrown out of the
water while junior Enos was simulta
neously lifted out. From there on, the
routine was non-stop action. Several
lifts were performed with Enos being
thrown out of the water, and sopho
more Montague also being lifted.
The intricate choreography and
long underwater sequences drew
choruses of oohs and ahs from the au
dience throughout the five-minute
routine.
Stanford synchro alumni Megan
Fix and Amy Markezich, both now
students at the Medical School, were

impressed.
"This is the best routine I have
ever seen Stanford put together,"
said Fix.
Markezich agreed. "Their techni
cal skill has improved so much in the
last year,"
One week from now, this squad
will face a much tougher audience
and much tougher competition. The
Cardinal will head south to the
NCAA tournament in San Diego
from March 18-20. There, it will meet
up with 13-time national champion
Ohio State to vie for its second
NCAA title.
With only one loss to the unde
feated Buckeyes, the Cardinal re
main optimistic about its chances.
"We've been working really hard
all season," said team captain Shaw.
"We know that Ohio [State] is going
to be a tough team to beat, but we're
confident that we have a good shot at
bringing home another champi
onship."
Stanford will swim all six of its rou
tines in hopes of bringing home an
other NCAA title.
Preliminary and semifinal compe
titions will be held on the March 18
and 19. Finals for all four events will
be held on March 20.
