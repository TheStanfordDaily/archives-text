more Alex Kim became the eighth
Cardinal doubles team this decade
to win the Pacific Coast Doubles
Championship this past weekend in

La Jolla, Calif. Abramsand Kim join
the elite names to win the tourna
ment over its 110-year history.
The Abrams / Kim duo was un
seeded entering the tournament and
their route to the finals was a diffi
cult one. In the semifinals, they were
forced to play their teammates, se
nior Ryan Wolters and freshman
K.J. Hippensteel — currently the
No. 5 doubles team in the nation.

MEN'S TENNIS
■ Friday-Sunday: Junior Geoff
Abrams and sophomore Alex Kim
won first place at the Pacific Coast
Doubles Championship.
■ March 24: Stanford vs. BYIJ, 11
a.m., Taube Tennis Stadium.

They defeated Wolters and Hip
pensteel 6-3.2-6,7-5 and went on to
beat USC's Roanan Kukal and
Glenn Mitchabati 6-3, 7-5 in the fi
nals. Kukal is the Trojans' top dou
bles player and Mitchabati was once
a top professional and Davis Cup
player for Canada.
"Each round in the tournament
we improved," Kim said. "Starting
in the quarterfinals we really put it
together and played the best dou
bles we ever have as a team. Geoff
was really active at the net and we
both returned well, which was really
the key throughout."
"It was nice for Alex and me to put
everything together for consecutive
matches," Abrams said. "The
coaches have been working with me
to be more active at the net on
Alex's serve to take some pressure
off, and we really saw the benefits of
this in the later rounds."
Both Kim and Abrams said that
they wished they were in separate

halves of the draw as teammates
Wolters and Hippensteel so they
could have met in the finals. Wolters
and Hippensteel played very solid
doubles throughout despite being
narrowly defeated in the semifinals.
It appeared the two Cardinal teams
were the strongest in the tourna
ment and it would have been a more
fitting matchup in the finals.
"You never like to play your
teammates," Wolters said. "Of
course we would have rather played
a round later, but at least they then
went on to win it. They played good
doubles and deserved it."
Wolters. who has been a winner,
finalist and semifinalist in La Jolla,
went on to say that the entire week
end was a success because it was a re
laxing atmosphere and each team
played at least two matches. They
were thus able to work on many
parts of their game.
The other two Cardinal doubles
teams were sophomores Scotty
Scott and Ali Ansari and juniors
David Hauser and Vijay Sekhon.
Ansari and Scott were defeated in
the quarterfinals of the consolation
round by the No. 1 seed in the tour
nament. Hauser and Sekhon won
their first-round match before being
beaten by UCLA's top doubles
team in the second round.
"Scotty and I played okay, but we
had some trouble on the big points,"
Ansari said. "We were right there in
every game, it was just a matter of
closing out. We did learn more
about how to control the points and
play aggressively."
Hauser and Sekhon were playing
together for the first time this season
and they also viewed the weekend as

a positive learning experience.
"It was just good to get match ex
perience and learn how to play to
gether." Hausersaid. "The match ex
perience showed us what things we
need to work on."
Both head coach Dick Gould and
assistant John Whitlinger were ex
tremely pleased with the Cardinal's

weekend. They said that it came at a
good time because the Cardinal
needed to work on its doubles game.
They also said they saw improvement
in each of the four Cardinal teams.
"We achieved our goal and came
out better doubles players than we
went in," Gould said. "I am happy for
Geoff and Alex. My only wish would
have been if they could have played
Ryan and K.J. in the finals. Now we
hope to build on our performance for
the second half of our season."
