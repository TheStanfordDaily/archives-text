The fifth-ranked Stanford women's tennis team re
bounded from its recent loss to No. 4 California with
two solid wins over the Arizona schools last weekend.
Second-ranked Marissa Irvin, who plays at the top
singles spot for the Cardinal, sat out Friday's match
against No. 24 Arizona with a stomach muscle pull.
As such, the Cardinal was led by junior captain and
veteran starTeryn Ashley. Ashley did not disappoint,
powering past Wildcat Lindsay Blau in three tough
sets, 6-1,4-6, 6-2.

■ Saturday: Stanford 6, No. 12 Arizona State (4-4,1-4) 3.
■ March 23: Stanford vs. Northwestern (6-3), 1:30 p.m.,

While freshman Gabby Lastra struggled against
Arizona's Monique Allegre and eventually succumbed
4-6, 6-4. 6-4 at the No. 2 position, the rest of the Stan
ford squad defeated their respective opponents to
clinch the dual match for the Cardinal.
Freshmen Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko Tokuda and
junior Jennifer Heiser all won in straight sets. Then
sophomore Sarah Pestieau fought past Arizona's Carly
Stringer, 7-5,6-7,7-6. Pestieau's win secured victory for

the Cardinal, and the women went on to take two out of
three doubles matches for a 7-2 dual match win.
Saturday's match with 12th-ranked Arizona State
was more dramatic.
Irvin was back in action, but her persistent stomach
injury hampered her serving motion, and she was thus
forced to rely on her powerful ground game.
Her opponent was 78th-ranked Allison Bradshaw, a
player with whom Irvin shared a history. Along with
Irvin. Bradshaw had been one of Southern California's
top junior players. Nonetheless, Irvin held a 10-0 record
against the San Diego, Calif., native.
"We have a long history." Irvin said. "It's always a
little more exciting when you know the player."
Irvin was determined to maintain her perfect record
against Bradshaw despite her injury. She came through
easily, pounding service return winners in a solid 6-2.6-
1 victory.
"My stomach made it so that I wasn't serving hard
at all. and my serve is usually a big part of my game,"
Irvin said. "I haven't practiced in a week, but I'm real
ly happy that the other parts of my game came
through."
When Ashley, Lastra and Heiser also scored
straight-set triumphs, it seemed as if the Cardinal was
headed toward an easy dual-match win over the Sun
Devils.
Tokuda and Kalvaria, however, found themselves
playing inspired opponents.
