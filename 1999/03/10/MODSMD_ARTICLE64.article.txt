### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
The fifth-ranked Stanford women's tennis team re
bounded from its recent loss to No. 4 California with
two solid wins over the Arizona schools last weekend.
Second-ranked Marissa Irvin, who plays at the top
singles spot for the Cardinal, sat out Friday's match
against No. 24 Arizona with a stomach muscle pull.
As such, the Cardinal was led by junior captain and
veteran starTeryn Ashley. Ashley did not disappoint,
powering past Wildcat Lindsay Blau in three tough
sets, 6-1,4-6, 6-2.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Friday: No. 5 Stanford (13-2,5-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
7. No. 24 Arizona (4-6,0-4) 2.
■ Saturday: Stanford 6, No. 12 Arizona State (4-4,1-4) 3.
■ March 23: Stanford vs. Northwestern (6-3), 1:30 p.m.,
Taube Tennis Stadium.

While freshman Gabby Lastra struggled against
Arizona's Monique Allegre and eventually succumbed
4-6, 6-4. 6-4 at the No. 2 position, the rest of the Stan
ford squad defeated their respective opponents to
clinch the dual match for the Cardinal.
Freshmen Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko Tokuda and
junior Jennifer Heiser all won in straight sets. Then
sophomore Sarah Pestieau fought past Arizona's Carly
Stringer, 7-5,6-7,7-6. Pestieau's win secured victory for

the Cardinal, and the women went on to take two out of
three doubles matches for a 7-2 dual match win.
Saturday's match with 12th-ranked Arizona State
was more dramatic.
Irvin was back in action, but her persistent stomach
injury hampered her serving motion, and she was thus
forced to rely on her powerful ground game.
Her opponent was 78th-ranked Allison Bradshaw, a
player with whom Irvin shared a history. Along with
Irvin. Bradshaw had been one of Southern California's
top junior players. Nonetheless, Irvin held a 10-0 record
against the San Diego, Calif., native.
"We have a long history." Irvin said. "It's always a
little more exciting when you know the player."
Irvin was determined to maintain her perfect record
against Bradshaw despite her injury. She came through
easily, pounding service return winners in a solid 6-2.6-
1 victory.
"My stomach made it so that I wasn't serving hard
at all. and my serve is usually a big part of my game,"
Irvin said. "I haven't practiced in a week, but I'm real
ly happy that the other parts of my game came
through."
When Ashley, Lastra and Heiser also scored
straight-set triumphs, it seemed as if the Cardinal was
headed toward an easy dual-match win over the Sun
Devils.
Tokuda and Kalvaria, however, found themselves
playing inspired opponents.

Freshman Gabby Lastra hits a strong backhand return. She was unable, however, to win her match Fri
day.
Faye DeVera, are diminutive play
ers and rely on consistency, speed
and wits, rather than power, to win
their matches. As a result, the
Tokuda-DeVera match featured
countless long-lasting rallies and
several spectacular retrievals.
Tokuda played with gutsy ag
gression toward the end. but DeV
era had an answer for every tactic
she tried, and the Sun Devil took
the three-set match, 3-6,6-2,6-4.
"I'm disappointed to see Keiko
lose," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan. "But she did every

thing she could. The other girl just
had one of those days."
Kalvaria's three-set encounter
with Arizona State's Kerry Giardi
no was equally dramatic.
Both women's games are built
around their powerful forehands,
but their match wasn't decided by
forehand winners. Instead, it was
decided by serves and nerves.
Kalvaria's serve abandoned her
as the match progressed, and she
often double-faulted at key mo
ments.
Moreover, an aggressive Giardi
no often pounced on Kalvaria's sec
ond serves, striking flat forehand
returns that immediately sent
Kalvaria scrambling. Giardino

eventually took the match, 5-7, 7-5,
6-4.
"Lauren has just temporarily
lost confidence in her serve," Bren
nan said. "She served fine against
Arizona, so we thought she was
over this problem." ✓
Brennan is certain that Kalvaria
will overcome her serving woes
soon, however, and is impressed
with the rest of the freshman's
game.
"Giardino played really well,"
he said. "Lauren has nothing to be
ashamed of. She played great after
she served, but the serve just killed
her."
Fortunately, the Cardinal's top
doubles duo of Ashlev and Irvin

toppled Arizona State's Bradshaw /
Katy Propstra to secure a Stanford
victory.
The teams split the remaining
two doubles matches, and Stanford
emerged with a 6-3 triumph.
"I'm very happy to have gotten
through this weekend," Brennan
said.
The team will now enjoy a long
rest from match play. Its next dual
match will be March 23 against
Northwestern.
"Now we have a chance to go
back to the basics and work on
some things that break down during
competition," Brennan said. "And
hopefully, Lauren will forget about
her serve."
