# Sailing takes 7th at Mclntyre
## As the wind blows 
### Meghan O'Connor 
The Stanford Sailing team had
ideal weather, a generous sea breeze
and strong competition for this week
end's Jeremy Mclntyre Team Race
Invitational held at the Stanford Sail
ing Center on Redwood Creek, but
what it didn't have was a whole lot of
experience.

SAILING
■ Friday-Sunday: Stanford won sev
enth place at the Jeremy Mclntyre
Team Race Invitational.

The team competed against nine
others representing each of the nine
different districts across the country,
making this the first year the regatta
has been fully national. The regatta
was dedicated to IW4 Stanford grad
uate Jeremy Mclntyre, an All-Amer
ican sailor for Stanford who died
tragically in January. Stanford fin
ished seventh, beating Tulane, West
ern Washington and Northwestern.
"I was not disappointed," said
Stanford head coach Steve Bourdow.
"We're still a little inexperienced to
this new discipline of sailing."
Bourdow referred to the team
racing format used in this regatta as
opposed to fleet racing. In team rac
ing, each team sails three boats and
whichever team finishes with the low
est number of points wins, as op
posed to fleet racing where everyone
races against each other. Without last
year's All-Americans John Meifde,
Dan Zimbaldi and Steve Kleha, who
were team racing national champions
two years ago, this year's team has
had to pick up the slack.
"Our three starters in team racing
last year had sailed together for three
years. They ran like clockwork, we've
only had a couple of weeks," said one
of this year's starting skippers, sopho
more Heather Porter.
Although the new format was
frustrating, the team was able to use

the regatta as a learning experience.
'it was tough competition," said
Porter's crew, junior Katie Gregg.
"We learned a lot by watching the
other teams. It was good to see where
we stood and where to go from here."
Bourdow was pleased with the
progress of his new team racers.
"It's a long process of learning,
we're one-third of the way there," he
said.
Bourdow is hoping that with more
practice, the team's racing on the
East Coast over spring break will
produce better results.
"The team's not full of rock stars
like last year so we'll have to adjust."
he said. "But our three people will be
solid and on a good day they should
be able to take on some of the
tougher teams."
Bourdow looks to Porter, junior
Tyler Doyle and co-captain Taylor
Robinson to lead the team this
spring. He is also anticipating the re
turn of sophomore Jeff Condon and
junior Anika Leerssen, both of
whom stopped out this quarter.
A co-ed team that is predomi
nantly female is rare, but Bourdow is
confident in the women. He specu
lates that the women's team will
dominate in the district this spring.
Porter is hoping the team will make it
to the top three in nationals.
Bourdow also has his eye on na
tionals in either fleet racing or team
racing. To do so, the team would have
to finish in the top two of the district.
Tough competitors will include
Hawaii, IJSCand Santa Barbara, but
Bourdow says they are beatable and
is especially intent on catching
Hawaii and Santa Barbara.
For now. much of the team's focus
is on learning and gaining experience
with team racing.
"We're on a pretty steep learning
curve," said Ciregg. "If we continue
to build that up. we will be able to
hold our own with a lot more of the
teams."
