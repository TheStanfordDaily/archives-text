# Softball (55) runs away from pack

### Gabby Duno Contributing writer 
With the flu epidemic nearly erad
icated on campus, the Stanford soft
hall team has its own version of spring
fever to spread.
In the best performance of the sea
son, the No. 9 Cardinal captured the
championship at the Cal State-Fuller
ton Easton Showcase Tournament in
Fullerton, Calif, this past Sunday.
In going a perfect 6-0 on the week
end, Stanford overpowered its oppo
nents, scoring 55 runs in three days.
Furthermore, the Cardinal proved its
defensive superiority, holding its op
ponents to a combined two runs in six
games.
The spring fever began Friday
thanks to freshmen Robin Walker
and Jessica Mendoza. Walker hit a
two-out RBI double in the sixth in
ning to help Stanford to its final 14-1
victory over Pacific. Two innings be
fore. Mendoza showed that batting
practice does pay off. hitting her third
home run of the year. More impor
tantly, Mendoza's homer was the
Cardinal's ninth of the year, breaking
its previous school record of eight set
last year.
Perhaps the fever was due to se

nior pitcher Marcy Crouch, who
seemed already contagious from her
first career perfect game against
South Carolina last weekend. Pitch
ing a perfect game is what all pitchers
aspire to do, but pitching two in a row
seems almost unfathomable.

Amazingly, Crouch threw her sec
ond career perfect game against
Auburn Friday night, retiring 30 bat
ters in her last two games. Fellow se
nior Shane Anderson batted in six
runs in two swings. The third base
man had six RBIs off two home runs,
one of them a grand slam in the top of
the fifth.
Saturday, the sickness continued
to spread.
In the first game of the day, the
Cardinal blanketed Northwestern
15-1 before defeating Illinois State
14-0. Against Northwestern, Crouch
hit her first home run of the year.

Sophomore Jenni Shideler and Men
doza joined in the fun, belting out
their second and fifth home runs re
spectively.
The Cardinal again showed no
mercy against Illinois State. Mendoza
went deep for the second time on the
day. Three Cardinal players filed suit
—junior Lauren Gellman, freshmen
Sarah Beeson and Christina Chao hit
their first, fourth and third home runs
of the season, respectively.
On the last day of the tournament,
with a perfect record behind the Car
dinal, Stanford's motor kept running.
Against host Cal State-Fullerton,
Stanford rallied to a 4-0 victory be
hind the .500 batting of Beeson and
junior Kellie Wiginton. Beeson went
1-for-2onthe day with a two-RBI sin
gle in the first to start the offense for
Stanford. Wiginton followed, going
2-for-4 to secure the Cardinal win.
Last but not least, Portland State
stepped up to the plate.
Stanford gave the Vikings no
chance as senior pitcher Becky
Blevins quieted her opponents ef
forts, throwing a no hitter with five
strikeouts in seven innings. Walker
and senior Jenny Foyle both went 2-
for-3 on the day to jump start the
scoring for the Cardinal. The Cardi-

nal ended the title game and its
thrilling weekend in a 9-0 victory.
"We are finally putting it all to
gether." said head coach John
Rittman. "The older players' leader
ship has been there all along, but now
there is a strong confidence in the
younger players."
Before playing, the Cardinal's
goal was to score 50 runs on the week
end. Not only did the Cardinal sur
pass the goal of 50, but the team also
hit 11 home runs, crushing last sea
son's home run total in just three
days.
Interestingly, fellow Pacific 10
Conference teams Washington and
Oregon witnessed the Cardinal's suc
cess. The Cardinal proved that its
wins were not due to a lack of good
competition, as No. 4 Washington fell
to Illinois St. 3-2 and Northwestern
beat Oregon 3-0.
With the contagious effects of
softball spring fever, the Cardinal
players are looking forward to two
weeks off, but lamenting the fact that
they are not ready to cool off just yet.
"This gives us momentum head
ing into conference play, "Rittman
said. "But by no means are we satis
fied. Our expectations are very high
for this season."
