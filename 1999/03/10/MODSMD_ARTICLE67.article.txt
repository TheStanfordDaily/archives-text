# Volleyball bounces back against Lakers
## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
After Friday night's exhibition game loss to the Ari
zona Wildcats, the No. 14 Stanford men's volleyball
team (5-8) devised an ambitious goal for the rest of the
season: to go undefeated in its remaining 10 matches.
A rather bold endeavor for any struggling team —
especially for a team that just lost its fifth game in a row.
The Cardinal returned to the court for its first test
with these new expectations against the Mercyhurst
College Lakers (6-9) on Sunday The match was not an
accurate assessment of its ability to fulfill its lofty goals
of defeating the remaining teams on its schedule.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Friday: Arizona (19-4) def. No. 14 Stanford (5-8), 14-16
15-7,15-8,16-14.
■ Saturday: Stanford def. Mercyhurst (6-9), 15-2, 15-12
15-3.

The fledgling Mercyhurst College volleyball pro
gram is in just its third year of competition at the varsi
ty level.
"We're a new program" said Mercyhurst head coach
Craig Davie. "This was our first road trip west this year
to play some of the better teams in the nation."
The Lakers compete in the Midwest Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association, where the teams are not as com
petitive as the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation vet
erans of collegiate volleyball such as UCLA, Hawaii
and Stanford. Although the Cardinal earned a 15-2. 15-
12, 15-3 victory over the Lakers, the play on Sunday
does not indicate much improvement in the consistency
and mental toughness problems that have been appar
ent in its recent losses.
"1 gave us a B-minus for the afternoon," said Stan
ford head coach Ruben Nieves.
After resting two of its usual starters, junior outside
hitters Gabe Gardner and Josh Palacios in Friday's ex
hibition match, the Cardinal brought all of its most pow
erful players to the court on Sunday. This personnel

helped Stanford earn a .481 hitting percentage in the
first set and a 15-2 game-one win. Mercyhust recorded a
.071 percentage in this frame.
In game two, consistency problems plagued both
teams. The Stanford offense fell to a .154 hitting per
centage. The Lakers, however, jumped to a 5-0 lead be
fore they became rattled on a disputed call. Mercyhust
senior outside hitter Adam Tokas received a yellow
card. Tokas lost his dispute and eventually received a
red card and the Lakers lost all of the momentum they
had established at the start of game two.
The Cardinal recaptured its execution style of game
one and tied the set at 12 before winning the next three
points to capture game two.
Although the Stanford defense remained focused
throughout game three, its attacking let up its level of in
tensity. Mercyhurst recorded a .447 hitting percentage
in this frame, while Stanford fell to .234. A more capa
ble team could have capitalized on the Cardinal's de
creased intensity.
The Cardinal's strong serving talents, however, were
one of the staples of the match. Sophomore setter Josh
Lukens ended game three with the team's ninth ace of
the match.
"We needed to beat up on a weaker team, before we
can start beating up on the better teams," Gardner said.
"This was the start of a long winning streak."
Perhaps Stanford's Friday night opponent, the Ari
zona Wildcats, was even more obscure than Mercyhurst
within the ranks of collegiate volleyball. Arizona (19-4)
was only the second club team that the Cardinal has
faced in exhibition games this season. Arizona recov
ered from faltering in the first game to win 14-16,15-7,
15-8,16-14.
It's unusual for a team to seek a win, yet approach a
match without starting its most experienced players. Al
though the Cardinal hoped to snap its losing streak, that
ambition was not the foremost goal of the Stanford
coaching staff. Stanford sacrificed the skills of Gardner
and Palacios to allow freshman outside hitters Marcus
Skacel and Larry Witt the opportunity to assume start-
