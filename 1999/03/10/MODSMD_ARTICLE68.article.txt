■ Saturday: No. 11 Stanford
placed second in New Mexico
Invitational

Two weeks ago, the Cardinal
traveled to Santa Barbara to
compete in the UC-Santa Bar
bara Invitational. Since it was
facing UCSB, a team it had
beaten twice before, and New
Mexico, a team ranked 20th na
tionally, it approached the meet
as a chance to develop its skills
and try a few new routines.
In some cases, it went for eas
ier vaults, or in freshman Bran-
don Berkenbile's case, it added a
twist on the landing. But even with
those adjustments, the Cardinal fin
ished in second place in the vault,
trailing behind UCSB by 15-hun
dredths of a point. Stanford ended up
losing the match to New Mexico by
two-tenths of a point, its closest mar
gin of defeat since a loss to Brigham
Young earlier in the season.

After losing by such a small mar
gin to a lower-ranked team, the Car
dinal did not take the New Mexico
Invitational lightly.
Besides facing New Mexico
again, it was up against an Okla
homa team that was ranked sixth na
tionally. The Sooners were coming
off a dramatic victory over rival Ne
braska where Todd Bishop scored
the first perfect 10 in school history.
Once they have competed against
a team, Stanford's gymnasts know
what to expect and have a much eas

ier time. The first time the Cardinal
compete against a team, Stanford has
a 2-3 record, but in second meetings,
Stanford has a 3-1 record.
This season the Cardinal has
dominated Air Force. In its first
meeting, at the BYU Invitational,
Stanford beat Air Force by almost 10
points and in their second meeting by
almost nine points.
Even though the Cardinal beat
Air Force by more than four points in
Saturday's meet, its usual dominance
was absent.

Despite the lack of that domi
nance, there were some strong indi
vidual performances. Stanford se
nior co-captain Jason Katsampes
continued his phenomenal season,
placing second in the all-around
competition while Berkenbile cap
tured the floor exercise title.
But strong individual perfor
mances were not enough to top Ok
lahoma, which finished with a final
score of 223.875.
The Cardinal will have another
chance for revenge next week when

the Sooners come to Stanford for the
final match of the regular season.
Again, the Cardinal will have to
demonstrate marked improvement
if it hopes to upset the Sooners. who
have not lost in more than a month.
But the Cardinal will not only
have the advantage of the second
meeting but will also be at home,
where it has a 5-1 record. This win is
essential for the Cardinal because it
is a precursor for the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation champi
onship on March 26.
