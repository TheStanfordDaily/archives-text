Eric Tribbett qualified in epee and captain Tim Chang
and Junior World Champion Felix Reichling qualified in
foil. Sophomore Will Chang and freshman Dave Lavalle
also qualified in the sabre event.
The Cardinal (7-1) has shown itself to be quite a con
tender for the NCAA title, losing only one meet to Notre
Dame. Earlier in the season, the team showed a solid per
formance by beating four-time NCAA champion Penn
State.
" This year's team is much more experienced and has
more depth," Tim Chang said. "We had a great recruiting
year and we're looking forward to doing our best at

NCAAs."
Even with this weekend's victory in the Western Re
gional, the Cardinal remains relaxed about its NCAA ap

"Coach is constantly reminding us to have fun while we
fence," said Hong, a first time NCAA qualifier. "We're all
just aiming to continue performing at the level we've been
competing at all season."
Chang, the team's captain for the last three years, is es
pecially proud of this year's team.
"We work well together. We motivate each other and
we're great friends," he said. "I am excited to finish off the
season with these guys. This is an amazingly solid team."
