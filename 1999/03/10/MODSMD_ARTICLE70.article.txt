# Swimming powers to Pac-10 title
## 
### Rebecca Rettig Editorial staff 
It came down to the last second — literally. It
wasn't about just beating out cross-bay rival
California; it was about preserving tradition, a
namesake, and a 17-year-long winning streak,
the longest in Pacific 10 Conference history for
any sport.
And in the last second, the No. 1 Stanford
swimmers proved not only that they deserved
their ranking, but also the intensity and strength
of their team.
This past weekend, the Cardinal competed in
the Pac-10 Championships at the Belmont Plaza
Pool in Long Beach, Calif. Unlike past years
when the men have romped all other West
Coast competition, the men trailed for the first
two days of the three-day competition, but dis
played their swimming prowess to hold off Cal
and finally win the meet, extending their streak
to 18 years.
"I don't think that we thought we were going
to lose, but it was a dogfight from the begin
ning," said senior co-captain Justin Ewers. "We
kept looking one session ahead. After the first
day, we were kind of caught off guard by how
well Cal did and we just didn't have enough guys
in scoring position on the first night [Thursday]
to do anything about Cal taking a big lead."
Cal won three of the first day's five events.
Cal's 200-yard freestyle relay touched out de
fending champion Stanford by .05 seconds for
Cal's first-ever conference title in the event. The
Golden Bears went on to place a man in the top
three in the finals of every race. Cal went one
two in the finals of the 200-yard individual med
ley, with Stanford sophomore Rob Canales
coming in just under one second behind to fin
ish third (1 minute, 48.02 seconds).
In the last event of the day, Stanford rallied
to retain its title in the 4(X) medley relay, much
like it did during the last day of the meet. The
team of seniors Tate Blahnik, Ewers, Dod
Wales and sophomore Anthony Robinson
clocked a time of 3:11.01 to gain its 12th title in
15 years. Yet at the end of day one, Cal threat
ened Stanford's streak with a 53-point lead.
"Our team was confident going into the
meet," said head coach Skip Kenney. "We
didn't get ready for that first day because we had
won our dual meets against these teams. Cal did
a great job. They came really well prepared."
Cal's threats continued through the second

day of competition, but the Cardinal fared a lit
tle better. Stanford started off the day by win
ning the 200 medley relay by a little over two
seconds, its 11th title in the event.
Stanford had three individual winners to
Cal's one, narrowing the Bears' lead. Three se
niors dominated the 100 butterfly; Cardinal co
captain Wales outswam Arizona State's Fran
cisco Sanchez by three-tenths of a second to pull
out a victory.
Stanford's highlight of the day came in the
100 backstroke where three Stanford seniors
swept the event. Ewers captured his first Pac-10
individual title with a time of 47.62, trailed by se
nior Dan Schultz at 48.00 and returning 200-
meter backstroke NCAA champion Blahnik
(48.21).
Robinson also gained his first individual Pac
-10 title in the 100 breaststroke, clocking 54.56,
nearly half a second better than second-place
USC sophomore Slawek Richter.

At the end of the second day, the Bears' pres
ence still loomed frighteningly over Stanford.
Looking at the third day, if the points were
added up exactly accordingly to the seeds, the
Cardinal was projected to lose to the Bears by
nine points.
But then it came down to the fateful day and
Stanford swimming did what it does best — give
everything to pull out a victory in the end.
"By the last night, we had a meeting where
we knew what everyone needed to do," Ewers
said. "Everything made a difference; the inten
sity built with the excitement of what we could
do."
Stanford had already won two meets in the
last event of the competition this year alone —
against Texas and USC.
In the mile, two Cardinal swimmers raced
each other to finish second and third. Sopho
more Jeremy Kane went 15:09.31 to put fresh
man Reid Gustin in third with a time of 15:09.47.
Blahnik came full circle in his swimming ca
reer by pulling off another Pac-10 individual
title in his best event, the 200 backstroke, the
same event he won at the competition his fresh

man year (1:42.46). Schultz switched places
from the previous day's backstroke event to fin
ish second (1:44.02), just barely ahead of Cal's
Gordon Kozulj (1:44.08).
Stanford did not place anyone in the top
three for the next event, 100 freestyle, where
ASU's Sanchez set a new Pac-10 meet record in
42.86. The Cardinal came back in the 200
breaststroke with Blake Holden's third-place
finish.
Stanford inched even closer in the 200 but
terfly when sophomores Steven Brown and
Messner placed second and third, respectively.
And then it was time for the Cardinal swim
mers to show their depth and their talent. The
diving scores were added in, taking into account
junior Mark Michelin's fourth-place finish in
the one-meter diving competition, bringing
Stanford to a two-point lead over its cross-bay
rival.
"We got it down to the last relay which was
our dream and our hope," Kenney said. "We
have a very outstanding... 400 free relay team,
but Cal had four guys who were shaved and we
only had two so the team and I were a little wor
ried."
Ewers took out the first leg of the 4(X)
freestyle relay strong, touching the wall eight
tenths of a second ahead of the Cal swimmer; ju
nior co-captain Glenn Counts swam a personal
best split of 42.99, still ahead of the Bears' relay
by approximately one second. Third-leg Mess
ner swam against Cal's best sprinter, Bart
Kizierowski, whom Messner held off for three
lengths of his 100, leaving Stanford trailing by
two-tenths of a second. Wales stepped up, un
shaved and untapered, catching the Cal anchor
on the first length and never letting go, eventu
ally bringing the Stanford relay team a victory
with a time of 2:53.87, six-tenths of a second
faster than Cal's team, pulling the Cardinal
ahead by eight points to win the meet.
This year's Pac-10s were not just another
notch in the belt for the team or for Kenney.
"I've never been as proud, never felt such a
sense of pride," Kenney said. "Number one
[win] was special, but this win is equal to num
ber one. We felt like we've been through a war
together for three days."
"It was more special because it was harder to
win," Ewers added. "Every year is special, but
this is the first time we have had so many un
shaved, unrested guys. We just left everything in
the pool."
