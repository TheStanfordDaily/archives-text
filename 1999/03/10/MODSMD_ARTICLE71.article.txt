# Swimmers ready to battle Lady Bulldogs at NCAAs

The most dominant team of the "90s in women's col
legiate swimming and diving will be playing a new role
this year — that of the underdog.
Stanford head coach Richard Quick's squads have
garnered six NCAA championship trophies in the past
nine years. Now, the second-ranked Cardinal is looking
to put the icing on the cake by snatching its seventh title
of the decade from the mouths of the favored Georgia
Lady Bulldogs.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ March 18-20: NCAA Championships, 11 a.m., Athens,
Ga.

The Bulldogs will enjoy home-pool advantage during
the three-day trials and finals meet, which takes place
March 18-20 in Athens, Ga. But after a strong finish to
the dual-meet season and an impressive victory at the
Pacific 10 championships, Stanford has begun to enjoy
its new role.
"We're really kind of excited to be the underdog,"
said Stanford senior co-captain Chantal Rawn. "It's a
good position to be coming from. It takes some of the
pressure off."
The Cardinal was beaten badly by Georgia early in
the dual-meet season, but the team that the Bulldogs
faced in January has reasserted itself as a dominant force
of late.
A stinging defeat to Pac-10 rival Arizona followed
shortly after the Georgia loss. In the middle of its dual
meet season, Stanford was a team worn down by injury
and illness. Its two dual-meet losses were the most of any
Quick-coached Cardinal team, and a difficult schedule
threatened to push that number even higher.
But Stanford rode out the rocky times and emerged a
stronger team. Still suffering from illness, the Cardinal
knocked off USC and California, teams that had sud
denly become contenders for both the Pac-10 and
NCAA crowns.
Then, what was predicted to be a four-way scrap for
the conference title proved to be another cakewalk for

Stanford. For the Cardinal, not only did the victory mark
its 13th straight season of Pac-10 dominance, it gave the
team an inertial push for NCA As.
Winning the Pac-10 title "was a great confidence
booster," Rawn said. "Now everyone is healthy. We're
all in the same place [rest wise], and we're all really fo
cusing on the task at hand."
The task at hand, however, could be a difficult one.
Georgia boasts a deep and talented lineup. The Lady
Bulldogs have had more swimmers qualify for NCAAs

than any other team this year.
Georgia is led by American record-holder Kristy
Kowal, the reigning NCAA breaststroke champ. Kowal,
a junior, is trailed closely by her freshman teammate
Ashley Roby. Together, Kowal and Roby represent an
unparalleled breaststroking duo.
Other strong swimmers for Georgia include back
stroker Amanda Adkins and sprint freestylers Stefanie
Williams and Courtney Shealy. The Bulldogs will also
bring a strong diving contingent to Athens.

Another hurdle Stanford will have to overcome at the
NCAAs is a difficult Southern Methodist team. The
Cardinal narrowly defeated the Mustangs in February,
but SMU remains a force behind star swimmer Martina
Moracova. A returning NCAA champ in three events,
Moracova looks to come away with three more individ
ual victories this year. Moracova is a versatile swimmer
who has the ability to contend for nearly a half dozen in-

dividual titles, but she will most likc
ly compete in the individual medley
and freestyle events.
SMU's other big threat is senior
baekstroker Lia < )herstar. A peren
nial NCAA finalist, Oberstar could
be trouble for the Cardinal's star
hackstrokers Catherine Fox and
Misty I lyman.
Fox and I lyman will lead a Stan
ford squad that will bring a total of 13
swimmers to Athens, second only to
the I <ady Bulldogs. An accomplished
group of divers will likely join the
swimmers as well. The diving squad
will compete with other schools for
slots to NCAAs this weekend.
Flyman comes into the meet as
the reigning NCAA Swimmer of the
Year. Her three victories at last
year's championships were matched

only by Moracova. After a stellar
Pac-10 meet, the sophomore looks
to recapture titles in the 1(H)- and
2(X)-yard butterfly events and the
200-yard backstroke. Alongside
I lyman will be freshman Shelly Rip
ple, who has exceeded expectations
in the 200 backstroke and butterfly
events.
Fox, a junior, has found success in
Georgia before. As a member of the
l l )% Olympic squad, she captured
two gold medals as a member of the
400-meter freestyle and medley re
lays. Now she aims to build on her
performance at last year's NCAAs,
where she won two individual events
and set an American and NCAA
record in the 1 (K)-yard backstroke.
Another key competitor for the
Cardinal is senior co-captain Elin
Austevoll. Stanford's all-time fastest
brcaststroker, Austevoll is coming
off a career-best performance at
Pac-lOs. With momentum on her

side, Austevoll looks to challenge
Georgia's Kowal in the 1(H)- and 200-
yard breaststroke events.
Austevoll will be joined in the
100-yard breastroke bv freshman
standout Whitney Leatherwood.
Early in the season, Leatherwood
surprised everyone by smashing the
automatic NCAA qualifying time
for the 1(H) in a dual-meet. Her swim
still ranks among the fastest in the
nation this season.
The Cardinal will also be well
represented in the freestyle events.
Competing in the sprint freestyles
will be juniors Siobhan Cropper,
Gabriel Rose and Fox. senior Emily
Smith and freshman Sylvia
Bereknyei. The distance and middle
distance events will be handled by
Rose and freshman Jessica Fosehi.
Both the swimming and diving
squads will travel to Georgia early
next week to acclimatize for the
meet.
