# Kenney experience guides Wales and No.1 Stanford
## 
### Rebecca Rettig Editorial staff 
I )<>d Wales was born to be a swimmer. I lead coach of
the No. 1 Stanford swim team. Skip Kenney is well aware
ol this fact. And the path that led Kenney to Wales is one
ol inspiration and a development of mutual trust and re
spect.
In I%!S. Kenney sat al the Belmont Plaza Pool in
Long Beach. Calif., as a lifeguard during the Olympic
I rials. Kenney watched the competition and thought to
himself. "Wow! I his is really neat. I'm going to be a
swimming coach."
Although this is not a common thought when watch
ing athletic prowess the average spectator wants to be
an athlete rather than a coach — it was one of the best
things to happen to the world of swimming. Kenney has
gone on to coach two( )lympic teams as well as one of the
best collegiate swim teams in history.
In I ong Beach, the fateful day of the 100-meter but
terfly is where Kenney and the Wales family first crossed
paths. Ross Wales, l)od's father, swam the 100 fly and
qualified for the Olympics, eventually becoming

the bronze medalist in the event.
Alter Kenney's decision to coach, he approached
Don Gambril, then the head coach of the Phillips 66
Long Beach Aquatic Club and the Long Beach State
team, and became his assistant. At this time, Ross Wales
was on military assignment close to Kenney's club and
Kenney got not only to watch him swim, but also to help
him swim.
Gambril was then offered the job to coach the team at
Harvard when, at the same time, the elder Wales was
transferred to a station in Boston and decided to train at
I larvard. Gambril made a decision at this point that was
lucky and fateful for Kenney and the Wales family: he
took Kenney with him as an assistant to Boston.
In Boston, Gambril spent much of his time recruiting
and working on other things outside of the pool, leaving
much of the hands-on coaching to Kenney. In this way,
Kenney directly coached Ross Wales for nearly three
years.
In 1977 in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dod was born to Ross
and his wife J.J., also a competitive swimmer. Kenney,
who was coaching a nearby club team, came to the hos
pital to congratulate the Wales, wish them well and

check out the newborn swimmer. It took only three years
to get the new Wales to take to the water.
"He was three (when he learned how to swim]." J.J.
Wales said. "He was playing with a friend in the shallow
end and figured out that he could keep his head up 011 his
own. That's where it all began."
Dod kept on swimming, and five years later, he was
swimming competitively on a summer team. By age nine,
he swam year-round. Yet despite the strong family swim
ming background, Dod was not confined to the water.
Both Dod and his mother emphasize the lack of pres
sure from his parents. The Wales parents wanted Dod to
be happy, to excel at what he liked the best and accepted
and felt a certain parental pride no matter what Dod did.
"I never felt pressure to swim," Dod said. "My par
ents were very encouraging, but I played a lot of differ
ent sports."
"Dod played a lot of soccer and tennis," J.J. Wales
said. "He also was a natural golfer. But he chose swim
ming because he had a natural feel for it."
Once in high school at St. Xavier's in Cincinnati,
Wales began swimming exclusively. Besides his natural
feel for swimming, he also had a natural feel for his fa
ther's event: the KM) butterfly. Even though Dod ex
celled at the event his father was known for, "there hasn't
been pressure to achieve," lie said. "I put pressure 011
myself. It is important to make my dad proud, hut any
pleasure that my parents get from me swimming is an
added bonus."
The pressure in high school came from a different
source besides his father's swimming success. Former
Stanford swimming standout and Olympian Joe Hude
pohl also swam in Cincinnati. Hudcpohl was a senior, a
swimmer planning on coming to Stanford to swim for
Kenney, when Wales was a freshman.
"The pressure [in high school] came from the media
wanting me to live up to what Joe did. I was compared to
Joe rather than my father," Wales said.
But despite this indirect pressure, Hudcpohl was a
role model for Wales. Throughout high school. Wales
continued swimming his natural event as well as finding
a groove in the 1 (K) freestyle. But at the end of high
school, Wales had lost his feel for the 1 (K) fly, one year be
fore 1996 Olympic Trials.
At the same time, Kenney had moved from Cincin
nati and had been building the Stanford swim team into
a known powerhouse for close to 15 years. He knew that
he wanted Wales on his team.
Although Wales looked at a number of different
schools, he finally narrowed it down to Michigan, anoth
er college known for its stellar swimming program, and
Stanford.
It was clear to both Wales and his parents, though,
t hat Stanford was the right place for a number of reasons,
including Kenney's presence as coach and Wales' desire
to go to a "first-rate school," something his parents found
very attractive.
"Stanford is everything that every mother and father
would want in a college experience," J.J. Wales said.

On Kenney's recruiting home visit, Kenney told
Wales that he was the kind of athlete that he wanted to
build a team around — not only for his swimming, hut
also for his leadership skills.
"It really meant a lot to me that Skip wanted me for
who I was and for other reasons besides swimming,"
Wales said.
"A great athlete is someone who makes other people
around them better by what they say and what they do
and I thought that Dod had both qualities," Kenney said.
"Dod was exactly like his father: quiet, but determined
and goal- and success-oriented. I knew the quality of a
young man that he was and that he would be a great
leader on the team."
"Dod was very positively influenced by seeing the
kind of friendship between swimmer and coach that
Dod's father and Skip had and he really like that," J.J.
Wales remembers.
Once he got to Stanford, Dod had some major adjust
ments he had to make. He was not used to the kind of in
tensity that Kenney expected from his team. Wales' high
school team and club team had let him put into swim
ming what he wanted to put in, but Kenney expected
more.
"I felt like for the first time. I was trying to please Skip
and my dad. I wasn't swimming for myself," Wales said.
That same year, Wales went to the Olympic Trials,
not to swim the butterfly, but rather the 1 (K) freestyle. He
came in 25th and was devastated.
"Dod losing his feel in the fly led to a lot of self doubts
about his swimming accomplishments," J.J. Wales said.
But Dod found his groove again by "learning how to
bring his self-confidence back. He made a bigger and big
ger commitment to being, what he calls, 'patient and per
sistent.' "
"I reevaluated everything and made smaller, more
feasible goals," Wales said.
"As talented as Dod is, it took two years for that to
come out." Kenney observed. "But it really is a blessing
in disguise: he is building perfectly for the 2000
[Olympic] Games."
But before the younger Wales leaves his own name on
the international world of swimming, he is looking to "go
faster than anyone's gone before" in the United States in
the 1 (K) fly.
Wales is looking not only to break Stanford swimmer
Pablo Morales' American record (46.25), but also to
shatter the NCAA and U.S. Open Records that Lars
Frolander, a Swede, set last year at NCAAs with a time
of 45.5.
And with Dod clocking an unshaved and slightly ta
pered time of 46.6 for a victory at this past weekend's Pa
cific 10 Conference Championships, it looks that with
some rest before NCAAs, he maybe able to reach his
goal.
After all the crossing of paths between the Wales fam
ily and Kenney, Dod has found his own personal path
and developed it with support from his parents, Kenney
and himself.

Stanford head coach Skip Kinney has known star swimmer Dod Wales since birth.
I )<>d Wales was born to be a swimmer. I lead coach of
the No. 1 Stanford swim team. Skip Kenney is well aware
ol this fact. And the path that led Kenney to Wales is one
ol inspiration and a development of mutual trust and re
spect.
In I%!S. Kenney sat al the Belmont Plaza Pool in
Long Beach. Calif., as a lifeguard during the Olympic
I rials. Kenney watched the competition and thought to
himself. "Wow! I his is really neat. I'm going to be a
swimming coach."
Although this is not a common thought when watch
ing athletic prowess the average spectator wants to be
an athlete rather than a coach — it was one of the best
things to happen to the world of swimming. Kenney has
gone on to coach two( )lympic teams as well as one of the
best collegiate swim teams in history.
In I ong Beach, the fateful day of the 100-meter but
terfly is where Kenney and the Wales family first crossed
paths. Ross Wales, l)od's father, swam the 100 fly and
qualified for the Olympics, eventually becoming

the bronze medalist in the event.
Alter Kenney's decision to coach, he approached
Don Gambril, then the head coach of the Phillips 66
Long Beach Aquatic Club and the Long Beach State
team, and became his assistant. At this time, Ross Wales
was on military assignment close to Kenney's club and
Kenney got not only to watch him swim, but also to help
him swim.
Gambril was then offered the job to coach the team at
Harvard when, at the same time, the elder Wales was
transferred to a station in Boston and decided to train at
I larvard. Gambril made a decision at this point that was
lucky and fateful for Kenney and the Wales family: he
took Kenney with him as an assistant to Boston.
In Boston, Gambril spent much of his time recruiting
and working on other things outside of the pool, leaving
much of the hands-on coaching to Kenney. In this way,
Kenney directly coached Ross Wales for nearly three
years.
In 1977 in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dod was born to Ross
and his wife J.J., also a competitive swimmer. Kenney,
who was coaching a nearby club team, came to the hos
pital to congratulate the Wales, wish them well and

check out the newborn swimmer. It took only three years
to get the new Wales to take to the water.
"He was three (when he learned how to swim]." J.J.
Wales said. "He was playing with a friend in the shallow
end and figured out that he could keep his head up 011 his
own. That's where it all began."
Dod kept on swimming, and five years later, he was
swimming competitively on a summer team. By age nine,
he swam year-round. Yet despite the strong family swim
ming background, Dod was not confined to the water.
Both Dod and his mother emphasize the lack of pres
sure from his parents. The Wales parents wanted Dod to
be happy, to excel at what he liked the best and accepted
and felt a certain parental pride no matter what Dod did.
"I never felt pressure to swim," Dod said. "My par
ents were very encouraging, but I played a lot of differ
ent sports."
"Dod played a lot of soccer and tennis," J.J. Wales
said. "He also was a natural golfer. But he chose swim
ming because he had a natural feel for it."
Once in high school at St. Xavier's in Cincinnati,
Wales began swimming exclusively. Besides his natural
feel for swimming, he also had a natural feel for his fa
ther's event: the KM) butterfly. Even though Dod ex
celled at the event his father was known for, "there hasn't
been pressure to achieve," lie said. "I put pressure 011
myself. It is important to make my dad proud, hut any
pleasure that my parents get from me swimming is an
added bonus."
The pressure in high school came from a different
source besides his father's swimming success. Former
Stanford swimming standout and Olympian Joe Hude
pohl also swam in Cincinnati. Hudcpohl was a senior, a
swimmer planning on coming to Stanford to swim for
Kenney, when Wales was a freshman.
"The pressure [in high school] came from the media
wanting me to live up to what Joe did. I was compared to
Joe rather than my father," Wales said.
But despite this indirect pressure, Hudcpohl was a
role model for Wales. Throughout high school. Wales
continued swimming his natural event as well as finding
a groove in the 1 (K) freestyle. But at the end of high
school, Wales had lost his feel for the 1 (K) fly, one year be
fore 1996 Olympic Trials.
At the same time, Kenney had moved from Cincin
nati and had been building the Stanford swim team into
a known powerhouse for close to 15 years. He knew that
he wanted Wales on his team.
Although Wales looked at a number of different
schools, he finally narrowed it down to Michigan, anoth
er college known for its stellar swimming program, and
Stanford.
It was clear to both Wales and his parents, though,
t hat Stanford was the right place for a number of reasons,
including Kenney's presence as coach and Wales' desire
to go to a "first-rate school," something his parents found
very attractive.
"Stanford is everything that every mother and father
would want in a college experience," J.J. Wales said.

On Kenney's recruiting home visit, Kenney told
Wales that he was the kind of athlete that he wanted to
build a team around — not only for his swimming, hut
also for his leadership skills.
"It really meant a lot to me that Skip wanted me for
who I was and for other reasons besides swimming,"
Wales said.
"A great athlete is someone who makes other people
around them better by what they say and what they do
and I thought that Dod had both qualities," Kenney said.
"Dod was exactly like his father: quiet, but determined
and goal- and success-oriented. I knew the quality of a
young man that he was and that he would be a great
leader on the team."
"Dod was very positively influenced by seeing the
kind of friendship between swimmer and coach that
Dod's father and Skip had and he really like that," J.J.
Wales remembers.
Once he got to Stanford, Dod had some major adjust
ments he had to make. He was not used to the kind of in
tensity that Kenney expected from his team. Wales' high
school team and club team had let him put into swim
ming what he wanted to put in, but Kenney expected
more.
"I felt like for the first time. I was trying to please Skip
and my dad. I wasn't swimming for myself," Wales said.
That same year, Wales went to the Olympic Trials,
not to swim the butterfly, but rather the 1 (K) freestyle. He
came in 25th and was devastated.
"Dod losing his feel in the fly led to a lot of self doubts
about his swimming accomplishments," J.J. Wales said.
But Dod found his groove again by "learning how to
bring his self-confidence back. He made a bigger and big
ger commitment to being, what he calls, 'patient and per
sistent.' "
"I reevaluated everything and made smaller, more
feasible goals," Wales said.
"As talented as Dod is, it took two years for that to
come out." Kenney observed. "But it really is a blessing
in disguise: he is building perfectly for the 2000
[Olympic] Games."
But before the younger Wales leaves his own name on
the international world of swimming, he is looking to "go
faster than anyone's gone before" in the United States in
the 1 (K) fly.
Wales is looking not only to break Stanford swimmer
Pablo Morales' American record (46.25), but also to
shatter the NCAA and U.S. Open Records that Lars
Frolander, a Swede, set last year at NCAAs with a time
of 45.5.
And with Dod clocking an unshaved and slightly ta
pered time of 46.6 for a victory at this past weekend's Pa
cific 10 Conference Championships, it looks that with
some rest before NCAAs, he maybe able to reach his
goal.
After all the crossing of paths between the Wales fam
ily and Kenney, Dod has found his own personal path
and developed it with support from his parents, Kenney
and himself.
