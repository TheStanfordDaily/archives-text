## CORIOLAMEST 'Coriolanus' at the Berkeley Playhouse 
### 
/ow showing at the Berkeley Playhouse is
/£/ Shakespeare's last tragedy, "Coriolanus."
€ ' r The play is directed by Don Weingust and
presented by the UC-Berkeley Center for Theater
Arts. It is set in the fifth century 8.C., when Rome was
a mere city-state fighting for survival. Caius Martius
Coriolanus is a valiant Roman warrior unable to
move from the battlefield to the senate until his mil
itary exploits finally win him a political post. His
inability to curry the proletariat's favor leads to his
banishment, after which he offers his services to
Rome's arch-nemesis, Tullus Auffidius. He then
launches a vicious attack on Rome that reaches the
very gates of the city. On the night of the final attack
his father, mother and wife beg him to have pity on
his homeland. He relents, only to be executed by
Auffidius.
The Playhouse's production of "Coriolanus"
reminds one overwhelmingly of a high school play.
Lacking even an impresario's whimsical recasting of

the play as, for example,
"Coriolanus in Wonderland," or
"Coriolanus: An American
President" or even Coriolanus as
a post-punk rock star, this pro-

I r ' *
duction is Shakespeare qua Shakespeare in the worst
way. Without the bells and whistles of some whiz
bang conceit, the play is simply actors on a stage.
Here, this is a bad thing: the quality of acting vacil
lates between pathos and bathos, and the tragedy of
hubris-as-hamartia fails to engage.
Nadia Mahdi's rendition of Volumnia serves as an
illustration: she is central to the play as Coriolanus's
war-mongering mother; her deft machinations on
her son's filial piety are particularly compelling when
read against the long march of Shakespeare's "moth
erless" plays. Yet Mahdi's foam-flecked rhetorical out
rage, moving enough in Act I, is difficult to dial up
when an emotional climax arrives in Act V. We are
given the same sobs, the same jerky gestures of rage.
This rechauffe performance does little to stir the
audience's pity and compassion.
Kahan Behbehani's Coriolanus is stronger for the
duration of the play, though one suspects we have the
character's intrinsic iconicity to thank for that.

Indeed, when the
play calls on Beh
behani to stop acting
with a poker face his
performance
descends into a
deplorable sentimen
talism.

Meanwhile, the smaller parts are taken up with
varying degrees of success. Jack Powell does a good
turn as Menenius Agrippa, Weary Old Man, while
Russell Wardlow ably plays Cominius, Likable
Senator. But Coriolanus' wife Virgilia (Rachel
Christopherson) is rendered as pious and snivelling
as possible, which badly undermines the supplication
scene in the final act.
Amateurish though it might be, there is an ele
mental pleasure in simply hearing Shakespeare spo
ken out loud. Though the performance lacks in set
design and acting, such lines as "Name not thou god,
thy boy of tears!" almost recover the evening.
