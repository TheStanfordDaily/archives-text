world premiere of "Legacy"
Oy exposes audiences to the increas
ingly aging population of the
United States. Staged by the San Jose
Repertory Theatre, the play makes you think
hard about your grandparents and what
they've had to go through during the 20th
century. Five actors are able to present, most
ly with confidence and exuberance, a wide
sampling of the characters and personas that
have defined the modern era.
"Legacy" is based on Stud Terkel's book
"Coming of Age," which Turkel dedicated to
"those old ones who still do battle with drag
ons." Indeed, the men and women of a certain
age presented in this production are far from
withered and gray — the first musical num
ber vehemently decries the sedate use of a
rocking chair.

engaging stage presence. She also clearly has a
flexible voice — her career includes a stint in
a professional folk singing group — and she
makes you feel her emotions and tension
vividly.
The Sobrato Auditorium, where all perfor
mances are held, has an intimate feel to it.
The orchestra section enables viewers to see
the full range of passionate expression dis
played in the play — as well as hear the
glossed-over errors.
Carleton Carpenter, Yolande Bavan, David
Rogers and a sparkling Joan Roberts round
out the quintet behind the play's laughter and
tears. Two of the musical numbers, one of
them being the finale, are a bit shaky and too
inchoate to understand. But I enjoyed the
times when two or three people presented
their own perspectives on the same issue in a
bounce-back-and-forth format.
The production is not perfect, although
some of the show's shortcomings are mitigat
ed by the performers' ages. Several of them
had Broadway careers during the 1940s and
19505, so their real ages are not far from the
\ ages of the characters they presume to play.
