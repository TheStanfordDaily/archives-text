## THE
						ART OF THE URO Seven Projects at the Stanford Art Gallery 
### 
d /ow on display at the Stanford Art Gallery is "There and Back: Seven
/§/ URO Projects." The exhibit features works by Stanford seniors Alison
t-S ? Cheeseman, Sarah Duffy, Dan King, Geoffrey Koops, Colleen
McGarry, Tanea Richardson and Uma Sanghvi. The major creative arts grants,
administered through the Office of Undergraduate Research Opportunities,
allow students the resources and time to pursue creative endeavours by cover
ing summer living expenses, travel costs and materials.
Recendy, Intermission caught up with a few of the artists to discuss their pro
jects.
During the summer of his sophomore year, Dan King received his first grant
from the URO. "That summer I spent photographing along the Pacific Coast.
The project was a chronicle of a road trip," which traced a path between the
deserts and the developments of Baja, Mexico. In applying for a second grant,
King hoped to continue photographing but this time in an urban milieu.
"I was inspired by the work of Aaron Siskind, who started out taking straight
documentary photographs of the Lower East Side [in New York City]. During
the '50s, he became interested in the Abstract Expressionist painters and began
shooting more abstract compositions of graffiti and other detritus of the city."
With Siskind's work as a starting point, King spent the summer photographing
in New York.
After a year in Ireland, studio art major Colleen McGarry spent the summer
studying at the New York Studio School while gathering images for her URO
project in painting. "I worked from memory, mostly," McGarry said. "While in
New York, I kept notes of my experiences while recording images through pho
tography." Once back in California, McGarry worked from her notes to compose

her paintings. "I liked the idea of the project being a bicoastal thing," she
explained.
"I would definitely encourage people to pursue grant opportunities,"
McGarry said. She explained that the URO grant taught her "first, how to get a
grant; second, how to use the money; and third, how to fulfill my obligations to
the grant-giver."
Thanks to her URO grant, Alison Cheeseman spent the summer in Berlin,
working part-time at the Berlinische Galerie while pursuing a project in pho
tography. Cheeseman described the city as "a dynamic place right now, as the
government moves in and reunification continues." In this period of intensive
reconstruction, Cheeseman found herself struck by the relationship between
"construction sites, which were actively being modified and reconstructed, jux
taposed against the abandoned and forgotten spaces."
A recurrent image in her work is that of damaged, abandoned statues. She
described visiting Schlosscharlottenburg and finding a bevy of statues gathered
together in a side yard. "They were bombing casualities of the war, now marked
for restoration or simply being stored. They fascinated me as visual objects and
also for their liminal position between the buildings and the people I was pho
tographing."
"There and Back" is on display at the Stanford Art Gallery until March 19.
Admission is free. The Gallery is open Tuesday — Friday, 10-5, Saturday —
Sunday 1-5.
