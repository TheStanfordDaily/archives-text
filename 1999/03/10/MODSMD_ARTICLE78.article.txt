ZlS way since the horrid "Joe's

about the latest, "200 Cigarettes," but it's one of
those cute movies that can't help but be funny.
It's New Year's Eve in 1981, history's final year

AIDS). Our 16 friends in New York's East Village are looking for love, alco
hol and a wildly good time so they won't feel like they've wasted another
year.
One can get lost pretty easily with so many characters bouncing around,
so each person is given a uniquely outrageous set of problems, and the actors
do a great job of making their personalities stand out. Here's a sampling:
Kevin (Paul Rudd) has just been dumped by Ellie (Janeane Garofalo), so
he's wandering around town with his good friend Lucy (Courtney Love). As
they get progressively more drunk, Kevin and Lucy contemplate emotionless
sex. Meanwhile, Ellie rants with superb bitchiness to a sketchy cab driver
(Dave Chappelle).
Val (Christina Ricci) and Stephie (Gaby Hoffmann) are a pair of dolled
up girls with wacky Long Island accents who missed the last train back to
Ronkonkoma. Now they have nothing better to do than hang out with Tom
(Casey Affleck) and Dave (Guillermo Diaz) in New York's fresh punk scene.
My favorite duo is Jack (Jay Mohr) and Cindy (Kate Hudson). He popped
her cherry the night before, and now she's stuck to him with naive glue. Jack
seems to have issues with love, but the real problem is that Cindy is extreme
ly accident-prone — she causes hilarious scenes in every bar and restaurant
they visit.
The emotional content of this movie leans toward the tacky side, and it
often feels geared toward women. This isn't much of a surprise since the two
filmmakers are female. Still, you have to give credit to director Risa Bramon

Garcia and writer Shana
Larsen for their clever
pacing and expert pre
sentation of New York
City. Plus, you've got
Elvis Costello as the spe
cial consultant on '80s
music, so you can't go
wrong with the sound
i track.
