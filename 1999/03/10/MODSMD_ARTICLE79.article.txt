						GRATUITOUS MOVIE
## Patron saint of mediocre directing reels off '8MM'

(( MM" tries very, very hard to be dirty and shock
\) ing. It's about the undergound porn industry
U and the producers and consumers of snuff films.
There's lots of sex and violence and blood and dimly lit
warehouses.
But despite all its efforts, "BMM" is actually just another
crime movie. A private investigator (in this permutation,
Nicholas Cage) is hired to investigate a mystery, and ends up

with a black eye — and more than he bargained for! His life falls to pieces — until he
makes a breakthrough that leads to justice! He has a friend — who is murdered! He
tries to quit smoking— but can't!
This genre can work when given a clever plot ("The Usual Suspects") or innova
tive filming ("Seven") or Kevin Spacey ("LA. Confidential"). But "BMM" is at best a
really watered down version of "Seven." I think the blame here lies with the director,
Joel Schumacher ("The Incredible Shrinking Woman").
Schumacher is a hack. Of course, I will always personally hate him for ruining the
"Batman" movies—he replaced Tim Burton after the wonderfully dark "Batman
Returns" and made those two ugly movies where everyone wears fluorescent prima
ry colors and tights. While his movies are usually not boring, keeping someone's
attention through formula-tested suspense is easy. Capturing real feelings is hard.
Schumacher tries and tries in "BMM" but has no feel for the rhythms of drama.
Part of the blame must also go to Andrew Kevin Walker, the screenwriter ("Seven,"
"The Game"). Walker is very good at creating disturbing, mindlessly adolescent plot
twists. With "BMM," however, he appears to have entered college. The script takes
itself very seriously and deals with themes such as the voyeuristic relationship
between audiences and violent movies. I have not seen such a subtle and thought
provoking concept since "Sliver." The brooding intellectualism reaches its peak when
the villain holds Cage at knifepoint but instead of killing him, talks for a while about
his motives. Dr. Evil, anyone?
"BMM" does have some good points. Joaquin Phoenix ("Return to Paradise")
solidifies his position among the best actors of our generation as Max California, a
secretly intelligent cashier at a sex shop. He reads "In Cold Blood," but hides the book
in the binding of a trashy porn novel. He uses the word "patina." Phoenix steals the
screen from Cage, who appears to have turned the levels down on his acting machine
for this film. Cage's performance is still solid, even without an accent, facial ticks or
alcoholism to work with.
Vou will enjoy "BMM" if you see it. And I suppose making a movie about snuff |
films is original, at least for the '90s (see David Cronenberg's "Videodrome," 1983).
But that doesn't mean Joel Schumacher is a good person. |
