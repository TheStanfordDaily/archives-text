## TEENAGERS INVADE HOLLYWOOD! The 						rise and rise of the '90s teen film 
### Rito Treviño Senior staff writer 
wo months ago, a movie called "Varsity Blues" opened and immediately took the top spot
in a box office that had previously been dominated by middle-aged actors like Robin
y S Williams ("Patch Adams"), Susan Sarandon ("Stepmom") and John Travolta ( A Civil
Action"). The new movie starred Jon Voight, but the real draw was the pack of seven good-looking
teen-agers led by poster-boy James Van Der Beek.
"Varsity Blues" controlled theaters for two weeks, only to be taken out by another teen movie,
"She's All That." Hollywood has pounded out a teen movie every week since, including "Simply
Irresistible," "Blast From the Past," "Jawbreaker" and most recently, "Cruel

Intentions." This week "The Rage: Carrie 2" and "Wing Commander" will join
the list, and the movies promise to keep coming at least through April.
What's up with all these teen flicks? Why do they always seem to star somebody
from "Dawson's Creek?" And what sort of people are watching them?
Well, the answer to the last question goes without saying. The teen movies are
being watched by teen-agers, and if you've been to your local multiplex recent
ly, you've probably noticed that there are enough of them to gather
Hollywood's attention. According to a 1998 study by ACNielsen Entertainment
Data, Inc., nearly half the U.S. population of 13 to 24-year-olds are frequent or
heavy film-goers.
Tom Borys, chief operating officer of ACNielsen EDI, said in a press release,
"The motion picture industry has long struggled with accurately measuring
the elusive teen-age audience. These frequent or heavy film-goers go to the
movies at least once a month and drive a significant portion of all ticket sales."
Leonardo DiCaprio is starting to look like an old-timer in this teen market.
Magazines like YM and Teen People have already written features about those

who might replace him. What's more
frightening is that teen-agers are taking

every medium by storm. Pop artists like 17-year-old Britney
Spears are consistently in Billboard's Top 10 Singles list, and
television shows Iike"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" keep popping
up in prime time. Back in 1995, when teen movies began to
explode, Vanity Fair called us a " 'Lolita' culture." Given the
current craze, that might be an understatement.
Teen Movies Part One: John Hughes
The last time we saw the rule of teen movies was the early
'80s. That's when names like Corey Haim, John Cusack and
Molly Ringwald became the center of attention.
Director John Hughes has always had an interesting motto:
"When you grow up, your heart dies — but you can make
bales of currency preying on the emotions of young impres
sionable boys and girls by making teen movies."
Hughes defined a generation with his teen comedies of the
'80s, including "Sixteen Candles," "The Breakfast Club,"
"Pretty in Pink," "Weird Science" and "Ferris Bueller's Day
Off."
That was also a period marked by wacky party movies like
"Porky's," "Revenge of the Nerds" and "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High." Nor can we forget the huge slew of slasher
movies, from "A Nightmare on Elm Street" to "The Evil
Dead" to all eight "Friday the 13th" movies.

But the mass-audience appeal of teen movies died at the
turn of the decade. Movies just got dumber. While "Weekend at
Bernie's" and "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" were high

lights of 1989, in 1991 and 1992 the genre had been reduced to the slapstick of "Encino Man" and
"Wayne's World." A mere seven years ago, such elderly entertainers as Fauly Shore and Mike Myers
were stealing the MTV generation spotlight.

This is not to say that there weren't a few groundbreaking movies
sprinkled through the early '90s. "House Party" may not have
been the most well-received movie of its time, but it proved that
not all teen movies have to take place in Hughes' midwestern sub
urbia. "Dazed and Confused" made the '70s look interesting
again, and "School Ties" gave us an early look at Brendan Fraser,
Chris O'Donnell, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
Meanwhile, teen-age television was slowly gaining momentum.
"Saved By the Bell" picked up a big following, and Aaron Spelling
hit the jackpot with "Beverly Hills 90210."
Teen Movies II: The Return — "Clueless" & "Scream"
The turning point for this decade's teen movies arrived midway
through 1995, when a picture called "Clueless" hit the big screen.

"Fast Times at Ridgemont High," this movie was a bit smarter than its pre
decessors. It used the plot of Jane Austen's "Emma" for romantic laughs,
cleverly mocked California teen culture and starred a band of attractive
high-schoolers. The movie was praised by critics and earned $20 million
in video rentals — proving its staying power.
Alicia Silverstone, the star of "Clueless," became a quick success. According
to TV Weekly, she negotiated a $10 million, three-year production deal
while filming "Clueless," making her one of Hollywood's highest-paid
actresses at a mere 18 years of age. Silverstone now owns a production
company called First Kiss.
Movie producers learned a few things from "Clueless." First, cashing in on
Jane Austen was a reality. Second, the teenie-boppers who were unaware
that they were learning English literature were delivering lots of cash.
According to the Internet Movie Database, "Clueless" easily made four
times as much money as the following year's "Emma" starring Gwyneth
Paltrow. Finally, everyone realized that a pouty teen-age blonde was good
for much more than just Aerosmith videos on MTV. Silverstone was bring
ing in people from all age groups.
In 1996, teen movies went to the next level with Wes Craven's "Scream."
People came in to see TV stars Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox, and
they came out loving Skeet Ulrich and Rose McGowan. Thanks to Kevin

Williamson's first script — an homage to the slasher films of the late '70s and
early '80s — and Craven's masterful ability to frighten audiences, the withering
face.

According to the Salt Lake City Tribune, Craven wrote and directed the
original "A Nightmare on Elm Street" for $1.2 million. The movie went
on to earn $26 million at the box office. Check out the Internet Movie
Database, and you'll see that "Scream," with a modest budget of $15 mil
lion, picked up a cool $103 million from audiences. The following year's
sequel, "Scream 2," is only two places behind on the all-time box office
list.
Teen movies had come back ... big-time.

Teen Movies Forever and Ever...
"Clueless" wasn't the only
interesting teen movie to come
out in 1995. "Empire Records,"
which turned us on to Liv
Tyler, Brendan Sexton 111,
Renee Zellweger and Ethan
Embry, came out that fall. So
did "Hackers," which featured
current sellers Angelina Jolie
and Matthew Lillard.

using young faces and TV
personalities; no matter how
awful these movies looked,
they still managed to bring
in a slight profit. Old series
began to rise out of their
horror movie graves, result
ing in "Halloween: H20,"
"Bride of Chucky" and
"Children of the Com V."
The "give a teen-age '90s
update to an old book"
theme wouldn't die either.
"William Shakespeare's

Romeo + Juliet," starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, was a
natural spawn of the movement. "She's All That" adapted George
Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion." Choderos de Laclos' "Les Liaisons
Dangereuses" is now called "Cruel Intentions." And at the end of
March, "10 Things 1 Hate About You" will redefine Shakespeare's "The
Taming of the Shrew."
Is this new stream of teen movies a good thing for society? Even the
new stars are skeptical." 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' and 'Pretty in Pink'
are an entire generation's encyclopedia of feelings, but our generation
has dick for movies," Freddie Prinze, Jr. told "Movieline."
Well, if dick is what we have, dick is what we're going to keep on
getting, because distributors aren't letting up any time soon. Look for
Wes Craven's "Scream 3" this December.

The success of "Scream 2" and"I
Know What You Did Last Summer" caused an all-out horror movie frenzy in 1998. You couldn't
quite call these "B-movies" anymore; flicks like "Urban Legend," "Disturbing Behavior" and"The
Faculty" were costing an average of $15 million. Producers had discovered a working formula by
