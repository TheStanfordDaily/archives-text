# THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS
## MUSIC REVIEWS Cornelius FM, CM remixes (Matador) 
### 
Cornelius' "Fantasma" now. You are
sti " rea< *i n g this rey i ew - Why? Didn't I just
tell you to go buy Cornelius? Don't you
understand? Me critic, you leader. You go buy
"Fantasma" now.
You're still here! Why are you reading this idiotic
review while your next favorite album waits for you
out there right now? Listen, by now you could've
gone to the store, bought the CD and be lying on
your bed, gurgling with pleasure to the best album
of 1998.
Cornelius is meant to be "The Japanese Beck."
This is because, like Beck, he understands what
makes music great without paying much attention
to what genre it belongs to. He makes pop music in
every possible way.
In "Fantasma" he distilled the best of grunge,
Motown, old school hip-hop, bleep-bleep noises
and whatever other kind of sound you can think of
and mixed it all together. The result was strange and
fantastic and pop in the best possible sense. (And
you are still reading this review. Why won't you lis
ten?)
Now "Fantasma" has been remixed. And while
artists such as Money Mark, High Llamas, Damon
Albarn and U.N.K.L.E. were remixing Cornelius,
Cornelius re-mixed some of its own songs in return.
FM is the remix of Fantasma; CM is Cornelius
remixing the remixers.
"FM" is perhaps the better buy. It's like listening
to "Fantasma" for the first time all over again.
Damon Albarn makes "Star Fruits Surf Rider" glide
over some violins, bleeps, cheesy drums and a voice
emerging from interstellar spaces. Konishi Yasuharu
(of' Pizzicato Five") transforms "Count 5,6,7,8" into
a cross between Billy Idol and an aerobics workout
soundtrack. Buffalo Daughter softens "New Music
Machine" into a mellow blend of stripped-down
guitars and drums, unleashing the original's fury in
time for the

chorus.
"CM" also has some fine moments. "Maybe I'm
Dead" by Money Mark becomes a chaotic jumble of

joy, and I've been singing the chorus in my head for
the past 48 hours. The Pastels and The High Llamas
also do well in Cornelius' hands.
(Yes, both the remix albums are good. But buy
"Fantasma.")
(Where my prose has failed, violence will succeed.
I'm through with flowery adjectives and awarding
albums stars. I am going to Wal-Mart to buy a gun.
Please listen to "Fantasma." Or else the shooting
begins.)
