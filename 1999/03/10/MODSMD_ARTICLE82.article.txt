# The 						Peechees
## Life (Kill Rock Stars) 
### 
akland's punk rock gods The Peechees have
f/yj come out with another fast-paced album
titled "Life." This 18-track full-length com
bines all of the band's singles and compilation tracks
between 1994 and 1998 onto one CD and offers the
same punk loveliness that fans have come to expect
from them.
As always, Chris Appelgren's simultaneously
whiny, sexy and screaming vocals are backed by
Molly Neuman's appropriately paced smashing
drums, Rop Vasquez's fast-moving deep bass and
Carlos Canedo's distorted guitar. So why do I feel
like there's something missing?
This album just does not have the same loose,
fun-loving feel of some of the band's previous

albums. "Do the Math"
and "Games People Flay,"
two of The Peechees previ
ously released albums, had
this appeal — one that I
have come to love. These
I previous albums proved
I much more melodic, har-
I monious and adventurous,
—112 whereas "Life" tends to
/ showcase The Peechees'
I rudimentary talents, proba
j bly due to the fact that many
J of these tracks are from their
I early singles. What's missing
112 from "Life" is The Peechees'
more experimental and enter
taining facets.

This is not to say that the album comes

without its finer qualities. There are moments of
bliss among the more mundane parts. "New
Moscow Woman" and the band's version of the
Drags' "Well Worth Talkin' About" remind me why
1 like The Peechees: not strictly standard punk rock,

but punk with imagination. "Grease," a track from
the band's first single, is another fantastic sample of
Peechees du jour. This album, while not one of The
Peechees' best, definitely deserves a listen.
