# Jim O'Rourke
## Eureka (Drag City) 
### 
Zim O'Rourke has become quite a celebrity in
the past few years, both as a musician and a
producer / re-mixer. In recent projects he has
'd Tortoise and Microstoria and collaborated
with Sonic Youth on their SYR series. He also
worked with David Grubbs on their final Gastr del
Sol albums. Though he has gained the reputation for
producing a specific post-rock electronic sound,
O'Rourke's new solo album, "Eureka," leans more
towards his acoustic side. The opening track to
"Eureka," titled "Prelude to 110 or 220 / Women of
the World," is an eight-minute folk song repeating
the same phrase urging women to "take over." It fea
tures rich layers of sounds, with acoustic guitar,
strings, organs and bells.
The first track is characteristic of the rest of the
album, which includes more of the same light, folky
music with varied instruments, ranging from
French horns and trumpets to synths. Some of the
tracks are upbeat pop tunes — catchy in an easy lis
tening sort of way and reminiscent of bands like the
Sea and Cake — while others, like "Something Big,"
reminded me of lounge acts. There is also a lot of
soft, solo acoustic work, nicest in the title song,
which begins with O'Rourke's guitar and fades out
nine minutes later in a wash of trumpets, synths and
electronic beeping.
With an array of accomplished back-up musi
cians — Bob Weston of Shellac on trumpet, free jazz
star Ken Vandermark on sax and Rob Mazurek from
Isotope 217 on cornet, for instance — the album is
tightly produced and sounds great. Perhaps the
strength of his back-up band and O'Rourke's own
guitar skills explain why instrumental pieces like
"Please Patronize our Sponsors" are most successful.
Aside from an occasional foray into the cheesier side
of easy listening, heard in the awful saxophone in
"Through the night softly," on the whole, "Eureka" is
pleasant and pretty. Its sound, while both introspec
tive and lively, is a refreshing change from the heavy,
avant-noodling coming from most post-rock musi
cians' studios today. — Jeannie Kim
