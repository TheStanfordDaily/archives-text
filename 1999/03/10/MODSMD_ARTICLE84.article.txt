## Up A Tree (Sub Pop Records) 
### 
S* is Looper: Stuart David (also
known for his work with folk-pop
Zs group Belle & Sebastian), Karn David
and Ronnie Black. Looper Looper Looper. The
group had its first show at The Art School in
Glasgow, winter 1997. It was a full audio-visual
experience with videos, live music, moving sculp-

tures

and photograph projections. But Looper also
makes records. "Up A Tree" is its first full-length
album and is out this month on Sub Pop Records.
The CD is a mere 39 minutes long. The open
ing and closing songs sport a nostalgic tree
house / playground theme — the crackle-pop of a
turntable needle on old vinyl joins keyboard,
beats and children shouting. In between these
songs the sound varies from track to track, alter
nating between sung and spoken word vocals.
Looper does not, however, sacrifice its overall style
(drawn from a mix of elements, most notably pop
guitar, bouncy keyboard noises and narratives) or
fall victim to the fuzzy-mouthed monster of inco
herency. Nonetheless, there are some numbers
that stand out as noticably freaky musical
moments.
"Columbo's Car" is especially interesting. This
song starts off with smoky sounds as a match is
struck and notes are slapped out of an upright
bass. Over a background of jazz saxophone, Stuart
calmly begins his story. Midway through, the

music speeds up and takes a turn towards funk,
but the narrative of an unsolved crime continues
with the same softness of voice. The tempo slows
down again as the song ends with the lonely image
of Columbo driving off into the night.
"The Ballad of Ray Suzuki" is another out
standing track. It features voice samples from
some guy named Ray Suzuki and a happy little
blend of noises. Upbeat! On this song Looper cap
tures the bright energy of Saturday morning car
toons like Speed Racer while feeding in lightly

drum&bass beats; kiddie techno!
"Up A Tree" has a refreshingly friendly style
coupled with the intimate feel of spoken word.
Overall, the project is enjoyable and quite ,

beautiful. But I'm hella stingy, and I withhold
half a star since Looper exceeds its "nostalgic,

artsy, kitschy use of turntable needle noise"

quota.
