## The 						Ablist (Asphodel Records) 
### 
Ob Swift's album "The Ablist" proves to
the world that turntablism is a legiti
t/ mate form of music. Swift, part of the
turntable crew The X-Ecutioners, has come up
with a musical exploration that is both a technical
marvel and a wonder to listen to. Using the
turntables to spin beats and perform musical

scratches, Swift's wizardry is visible on the very
first track, "Dope on plastic." Using the super-fast
crab scratch — pioneered by the local turntable
crew The Invisibl Skratch Piklz — Swift lays down
beats that any music fan would be proud of. The
next track "What would you do?" shows off Swift's
ability to innovate by scratching the sound of a
gunshot.
From here the album expands, showing off
every aspect of turntablism. Certain tracks are
either solo performances or battles against other
well-known turntablists like Doctor Butcher and
Dan "The Automator" Nakamura, known from
the Dr. Octagon project. Other tracks get more
complicated: "All that scratching is making me
rich" introduces the listener to the Dujeous? Band,
complete with horns, guitar, bass and drums and
featuring Swift as the frontman. On this track
Swift battles every instrument in turn, showing
the more musical aspects of the record scratch.
Underground emcees like Pharaohe Monc make
appearances, most notably on "Turntablists
Anthem," a reprise of the song

from the X-Ecutioners' full
length album "X-Pressions"
(also on Asphodel Records).
I The lyrics to the song praise
i each X-Ecutioner in turn,

which is a welcome
change from the dis-

tressing self-promo
tion of mainstream
hip hop.
Although the

feedback for the X-
Ecutioners album
was mixed, Swift
shows with "The
Ablist" that he
was not to

blame. Whereas "X-Pressions" was more of a tech
nical venture that overlooked musicality at times,
"The Ablist" is a very artistic endeavor. By relying
heavily on production and post-production work,
Swift has created a much smoother product, an
album which one can listen to without stopping
to skip tracks. The only forgettable part of the
album is Swift's uninteresting attempt at rhyming
on "I'm Leaving." Regardless, this album shows
what turntables are and should be: musical
instruments worthy of respect and admiration.
