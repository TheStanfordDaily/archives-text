# The 						Roots
## Things Fall Apart (MCA) 
### 
/"T* » ts fourth album to date, the Roots
comes up with yet another creative
v masterpiece. For the last six years, the
Roots has released three albums highlighted by
"Illadelph Halflife" and "Organix." With each suc
cessive endeavor the Roots incorporates a new
creative style into its sound, and its latest, "Things
Fall Apart," does no less. Hailing from West
Philadelphia, the Roots is comprised of Raazel,
?uestlove [sic], Kamal, Malik Band the heart of
the group, Black Thought. With the superior yet
underrated production of Grand Negaz and a few
tracks by DJ Jazzy Jeff, the Roots sounds sharper
than ever.
Many hip hop albums suffer from inconsistent
sounds and styles as a result of an overkill of guest
artists. More like soundtracks or compilations, the
styles of different rappers often clash with one
another within a single album. However, this is
not the case on "Things Fall Apart," as the voice of
Black Thought meshes perfectly with guest artists
Common and Mos Def on "Act Too" — a testi
mony to the love of hip hop — as well as on
"Double Trouble." The most notable guest —
Erykah Badu — appears on the first single, the
spiritual "You Got Me." On this track, Badu not
only sings the R&B hook but raps as well, as Black
Thought describes his meeting with her:
"Somebody told me that this planet was
small / We use to live in the same building on the
same floor/And never meet before until I'm
overseas on tour and peeped this Ethiopian queen
from Philly takin classes abroad.... She said she
loved my show in Paris at Allese Momar / And
that I stepped off stage and took a piece of her
heart / We knew from the start that Things Fall
Apart, intend to shatter."
The album begins with the tracks "Table of
Contents" and"The Next Movement," with Black
Thought and Malik B rapping over a transient,
fluctuating beat. The Roots shows its versatility on
"Without a Doubt," a cover of Schooly D's
"Saturday Night." Lifting a line from W.B. Yeats'
"The Second Coming" — also the title of a
Chinua Achebe novel — the album is ironically
titled "Things Fall Apart," when in reality, every
thing seemingly comes together for the Roots.
This album epitomizes hip hop at its finest.
