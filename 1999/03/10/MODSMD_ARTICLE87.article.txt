## "DAYS" NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN Spielberg's name brings documentary to forefront 
### 
Last Days" is not an easy film
Ls/ to watch. It shows, quite graphi
? * caily, archival footage of the final
moments of the Hitler regime in Hungary. We
see tortured Jews and gruesome killings within
the concentration camp walls.

But what makes this documen
tary particularly worth watching
are the present-day effects of the
Holocaust on five survivors and
a doctor who worked under the
Nazis at Auschwitz.

producer, and his organization (the Survivors
of the Shoah Visual History Foundation) is cur
rently trying to compile 50,000 taped inter
views of survivors like Rep. Tom Lantos and
Renee Firestone, a teacher. Spielbergs magic
touch subtly permeates the movie. It is most
apparent when the conclusion approaches and
the five stories must draw to a close.
Lantos (D-Calif.) is the only congressman in
U.S. history to have survived the Holocaust. He
currently represents much of the Bay Area,
including San Mateo, South San Francisco and
the western part of San Francisco. Lantos is a
shining example of how many Jews, shattered
by the war, have been able to come to terms
with their experiences and achieve great things.
In addition to his political life, Lantos is mar
ried to a fellow Floiocaust survivor and has
more than a dozen grandchildren to keep his
hope alive.
Renee Firestone now works as a teacher at
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles
and attempts to educate Americans about the
horrors of the Holocaust. She brings a sense of
determination to the film, a belief that the
Nazis could not wear her down or conquer her
soul.
Overall, the film maintains a decent balance.
To counter the Jews' story, Nazi doctor Hans
Munch is given some time in the film to explain
his side. Munch was acquitted during the
Nuremberg trials because of his "life-saving"
experiments that delayed the gassing of count
less Jews. But to this day, Munch remains vague
when confronted about his hand in the exter
mination of Jews at Auschwitz.
"The Last Days" is a compelling tale that
should be required viewing for high school stu
dents studying World War 11. Spielberg wisely
lets the people move their own stories rather
than forcing the drama with a heavy hand.
Hans Zimmer's touching score reflects the tal
ent he has shown in both comical ("The Lion
King") and serious scores ("The Prince of
Egypt" and"The Thin Red Line,* both nomi
nated for Oscars). While a painful pill to swal
low, "The Last Days" largely avoids melodrama
through its use of real-life footage and achingly
sincere stories.
