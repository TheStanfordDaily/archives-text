# SEXUAL PERVERSITY IN MANHATTAN
## Polished Witherspoon the object of "Cruel Intentions" 
### 
Intentions" isn't what I'd call a terrific
v /y~) movie, but I think Stanford students will find
it strangely — perversely? — entertaining.
One of my buddies couldn't help but notice that it was his for-

mer Communication Department classmate,
Reese Witherspoon, who unbuttons her shirt
naughtily in the previews.
"Cruel" is an update of Choderlos de
Laclos' novel "Dangerous Liaisons." Sure, the
characters are 20 years younger, but I've been
told that vacationing teenagers may be soci
ety's last comparable leisure class. The film

Cruel Intentions

I K 1

follows the book pretty well: boy meets girl, boy bets to have sex
with his step-sister if he can get the girl, boy corrupts more
innocents in between and boy ends up in tragedy because he
realizes that he has emotions.
Staying true f o the plot is both a good thing and a bad thing.
It's good because "Dangerous Liaisons" is a successful story; the
1988 film won 3 Academy Awards. It also flips the coin of teen
flicks for a bit. Instead of the usual spoiled, idiot California
kids, we have spoiled, crusty Manhattan kids.
But it's bad because the book has a complicated plot, and it's
tough to translate all that into something that will entertain 16-
year-olds. Can we buy into Sebastian Valmont (Ryan
Phillippe), a boy who hasn't graduated from preparatory
school but drives a classic Jaguar convertible, manipulates
women as if they were toys and seems to have no parents?
Of course, character development isn't the reason people are
flocking to see "Cruel Intentions." What the movie lacks in con
vincing plot, it more than makes up for in hot young — er, tal
ented — actresses and actors.
Take Witherspoon, who plays Annette Hargrove, the object
of Valmont's desires. She's supposed to be an adamant virgin,
which makes the guys appreciate the gratuitous leg shots and
bathing suit scene all the more.
Phillippe appeals to the women in the audience by letting
out his emotional side and crying in a few scenes. Since
Valmont alternates between sexual predator and tragic wreck,
he could easily look stupid, but Phillippe handles the character
very well.
Many will agree that Sarah Michelle Gellar takes the cake in
this flick. As Kathryn, Valmont's scheming sister, Gellar is won
derfully wicked. Given her good-girl TV stereotype, she shocks
the audience more than anyone else. By now you've

probably heard about the

scene where she lewdly
tongue-kisses fellow WB

starlet Selma Blair.
If you're a fan of
Gellar or Phillippe,

- r r _ ,
don't even think
about not seeing this
movie. The rest of

you may have a hard
time with it, so I rec
ommend watching
