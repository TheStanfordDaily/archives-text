was com P letel y innocent, honestly. Miss
112 W Sass was researching a paper when she
112. 112 stumbled across a Web site entitled
"Entrapment alerts." Always willing to indulge her
curiosity, she read on. The site was a bulletin board
for men to post warnings about crackdowns on
"tearooms," bathrooms where men meet to have
several types of anonymous sex. Miss Sass scrolled a
little further. Listings for London, Hong Kong, New
York whizzed by. Then, a listing caught her eye:
Palo Alto, California (December 1, 1997)
Stanford University
"A guy with a clipboard was lurking in the tea
room in the basement of the Poli Sci Building today.
He placed a vign reading "Inspection in Progress"
outside the bathroom and seemed to be taking note
of who was leaving. He was not dressed in any sort
of law enforcement uniform but was wearing an
official-looking name tag which I could not read. Be
cautious!"
Now, up until this point, Miss Sass' suspicions
had not been concretely confirmed. She had heard
about the "tearooms" on campus before. She had
even had a few faces pointed out and dubbed bath
room frequenters. So, for the benefit of her readers,
she decided to investigate and ended up interview
ing a Stanford senior involved in the "tearoom"
scene. For discretion's sake, we'll call him Seth.
Roxy Sass: When did you first start hooking up
in bathrooms/
Setht The first time was at the beginning of this
quarter. But IVe been aware of it for a long time.
When you go to the bathrooms, there is a hush â€”
people are doing stuff, and they stop. There are just
too many people sitting quietly in the stalls.
RS: So what was your first time like 112
S: I went in one of the stalls that has a hole in the
wall. There was someone in the next stall, and he
waited a minute to see if I was going to the bath
room or if I was there for sketch. The hole was
drilled with a metal drill and is positioned so you
Can see the other person'* crotch but not their fece.
He started playing with himself, and 1 followed suit
Then 1 knelt down and got a hand job. That was
pretty much it, that time.
RS: You knelt down? 1 thought that was what
the drilled hole was fin.
S: The hole is too small to put your penis
through. It's just so you can look at their lap. There
are glory holes, but with this one you'd have to be
under-endowed and not afraid of getting cut to put
your penis in it.
[As a side note, Miss Sass hears that the University
has started putting stainless steel plates over these
holes, and somehow the holes keep reappearing.
Someone either has a very resilient drill or a deadly
pelvic thrust.]
it. "vij
RS* Okay, back to the hooking up. How do you
know what is going to happen?
S: It's kind of tricky, because it's always silent. But
there is a subtle code. For instance, if they like what
they see or want to touch you they'll put their hasKl
under the stall divider. Sometimes if they want
something, they'll stick their penis right under.
RS: But what is the appeal? Some might wonder

about the safe sex issues it raises, and others would
wonder if your sex life is maladjusted.
S: Well, part of the whole appeal is it's a safe kind
of sex. You really call the shots, so it can be as safe as
you make it. Unlike a regular hookup where once
you've started you keep going, if you think some
thing looks weird you just stop. And a lot of the
time you're just jacking off yourself anyway, but you
still get the rush of it actually being kinky and
underground. It's really more of a replacement for
masturbation than sex. The kind of erotic appeal
there is different than when you're with someone
you care about. It's more about getting off, and
you're not expecting anything more than an
orgasm. Why should I go home and masturbate
when someone can do the work for me?
RS: Fair enough. When does all this action take
place?
S: Most of it happens during the day. It's really
between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m., during the week, and
people are going in and out of the bathroom the
whole time. It's not this late night thing. I was in one
bathroom from 3:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. today, and there
were three people in there all doing stuff. Ifs rare
that there isn't something going on.
RS: That's sort of surprising, first that it's hap
pening during the day and second that it's happen
ing a lot.
$: Once you get into the scene, you're surprised
how many people are doing it And it's nice that
during the day, if I'm having a shitty day in class, I
know I can get off.
R& Then how do you determine if the guy in the
next stall is someone you wouldn't mind having
"<do the work," as you put itf
S: You can tell how old or gross someone is from
their hands (that you can see through the little
hole), and when you walk in, you can set through
the crack in the stall door and get a feel whether it's
an old guy or a college kid. Plus, some bathrooms
have mostly old men and some mostly students.
Actually, it's kind of interesting how it sort of
becomes a cult of penis. We spend all our time see*
irtg anything but the penis and judging people on
that. But if someone doesn't look good in general
and their penis is OK, it could be liberating for
them,
US: Do you ever tee anyone around campus and
wonder if you've hooked up with themf
Jfc If it waa good or they're really well endowed,
rn look at their shoes and wonder if 111 see them
around on campus. But ! never have.
