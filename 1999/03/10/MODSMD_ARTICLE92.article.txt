Well, howdy folks, I reckon that y'all
might be looking for a restaurant with a
fun atmosphere and some fine grub.
We were not sure what to expect
when we walked into "The Rio Grande,"

Rio Grande
228 Castro St.
Mountain View
★ ★ ★

a country western-style restaurant in Mountain View, but we
were pleasantly surprised by one of the most festive settings of
any restaurant in the Stanford area. Located 15 minutes south of
campus off of El Camino on Castro Street in downtown
Mountain View, "The Rio Grande" is a bar and grill that stays
true to its theme.
While the entire restaurant is draped in country-style motifs,
the most eye-catching feature is the realistic backdrop painting
of the sun setting over the Texas landscape. The restaurant is set
up in a somewhat odd matter above the dance floor. There are
three dining levels that ascend mm aecreuje in size similar to an
athletic arena.
The first floor is dominated by the large bar and is perhaps
the most festive due to its proximity to the dance floor. The top
level, where we were seated, provides a somewhat more reserved
and calmer dining experience.
When we looked over the third floor banister all that we
could see was the Texan horizon, but from the bottom level the
dance floor was visible. For a couple of city kids like us, eating at
"Rio Grande" on a Tuesday night replete with country western
dancing lessons was an exciting change of pace. For those of you
more experienced or courageous, perhaps the Friday and
Saturday live band is more up your ally.
Overall the food was tasty, but be prepared for a heavy meal.
"Light" is not a word on the "Rio Grande" menu. Main courses
range from traditional western dishes like ribs and steaks to
more exotic trappings like skewered quail and baked stuff trout.
The hearty helpings provided in the side dishes offered more
staples of Texan dining. Due to the limited selection of appetiz
ers, we decided to opt for a main dish with sides. Adrien had the
grilled rib-eye with horseradish cream. While it was a juicy, fill
ing steak, be prepared to cut away the excess fat that is charac
teristic of rib-eyes.
Feeling like "Rio" was a "beer and burger joint," David opted
for the cheddar burger with all the fixings. Growing up eating
great meat in Chicago, David had high standards for his red
meat, and while his burger was a very good burger, it didn't
compare to the burgers back home.
For our sides, we decided to try the hushpuppies and onion
rings. After trying to order the cornbread and being unable to
because the restaurant was out, David selected what he was told
by the waiter was the most similar item to cornbread. Though
authentic in its taste, David was disappointed by the hushpup
pies' excessive spiciness and saltiness. The onion rings, on the
other hand, were phenomenaL Covered in a thick batter, these
huge rings were the best either of us had ever eaten.
We wrapped up our meal with a butterscotch brownie with
Bourbon pecan ice cream and coffee. The dessert was quite
good, with a soft texture provided by the mixture of the brown
ie and ice cream. Though the coffee was served almost immedi
ately after we had ordered it, it was room temperature. Needless
to say, this concluded our dinner on a bad note.
Overall the food was tasty and the atmosphere upbeat. We
two-stepped our way out of the restaurant feeling like Texas
natives.
