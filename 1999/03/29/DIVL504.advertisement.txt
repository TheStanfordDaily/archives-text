The differences in behavior
between the sexes has made
possible our survival as a species,
while adding groat dimension to
our everyday interactions. But
these differences include some
rigid rules of behavior - ones that
can be personally limiting and
socially divisive.
Socialization
From the minute we're born we
get strong messages about what's
expected of us based on our gen
der. They come from our families,
our peers, the media - indeed,
from the entire culture. For exam
ple, men are usually encouraged
to focus on competition, achieve
ment, and career-building; deep
emotional connections are sec
ondary. For women, the reverse is
often true.
We're rewarded when we con
form to gender expectations, and
disapproved of when we don't.
These responses become inter
nalized. We feel we're doing
something wrong when we don't
conform. We are taught that:
■ It's not masculine to express
the full range of emotions (so
men learn to suppress them);
it's okay to show anger, but
not the more vulnerable emo
tions (e.g., sadness, fear, hurt)
■ When women express anger
it's considered unfeminine
and makes others uncomfor
table (so women suppress it),
but it's okay for them to
express feelings of depen
dency and vulnerability
■ For men, power and self-worth

roles were rarely challenged just a
generation ago.
come through achievement and
winning, so winning is extreme
ly important (they have diffi
culty admitting failure or defeat)
■ Physical appearance is extreme
ly important for women,
resulting in self-consciousness,
shame for being "imperfect,"
and emulation of ultra-thin
media icons
■ It's not respectable for women
to have sexual power, know
ledge or experience (so they
may use alcohol or other
drugs to freely express their
sexuality)
We are often socialized to believe
that men are superior to women -
smarter, more important, and
more valuable. And that "mascu
line" traits like competition and
being on top are more valuable
than "feminine" traits, such as
cooperation and connection. The
result is "sexism" and inequality.
Limiting Ourselves
Both men and women are limited
by stereotyped gender roles and
rules. For example, man-to-man
communication is often superficial
and "macho" (real emotions are
not expressed). And women are
more reluctant to speak up in class,
sacrificing opportunities to learn.
Our socialized behavior causes
misunderstandings and disap
pointment. For example, some
women seek partners who are
always strong and in control, but
are disappointed when those men
aren't able to show vulnerability.
On the other hand, some men are
attracted to women who are sub
missive, but an' disappointed when
their partners seem uninteresting.
Teasing and belittling comments
toward the opposite sex feel
demeaning and hurt. Men some
times refer to women as sexual
objects or parts, or see women as
either "good girls" or "tramps."
Although these patterns often
make women feel uncomfortable
and unsafe, they usually don't
speak up.
What to Do
To minimize sex role stereotypes:
■ Discuss these issues in a
mixed gender group
■ Try out behaviors and talents
that are not stereotypic to
your gender
■ Challenge sex role stereo
types and inequalities
■ Don't put up with language
or actions that are demeaning
■ Give the opposite sex the
same consideration as you'd
give a much-loved sister or
brother (respect their views
and values, which may differ
from your own)
