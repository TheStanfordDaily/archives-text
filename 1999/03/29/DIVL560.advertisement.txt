SENIORS WILL BE GRADUATING
INTO DEBT.
Under the Army's
Loan Repayment
program, you could get
out from under with a
three-year enlistment.
Each year you serve

your indebtedness by one
third or $1,500, which
ever amount is greater,
up to a $65,000 limit.
The offer applies to Perkins Ix>ans, Stafford l>oans,
and certain other federally insured loans, which are not
