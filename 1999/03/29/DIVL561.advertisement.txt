Egg Donor Needed!
We are a happy and loving couple who has
recently discovered that we are unable to have
a child on our own. So, we're looking for a
compassionate woman to help us have a baby
as an egg donor. We're hoping for someone
who is bright, healthy, between s'4"and 5'9",
with blonde or brown hair. We'd be delighted
to find a woman with some Scandinavian
background. Thanks in advance for your kind
consideration.
