Earthquake rocks India
NEW DELHI, India (AP) — A severe earth
quake struck India's Himalayan foothills early yes
terday, killing 47 people and shaking a broad stretch
of northern India, news reports and officials said.
India's seismological department measured the
quake at a magnitude of 6.8, which it described as
powertul enough to be "severe and damaging." It
lasted close to 40 seconds.
Ihe epicenter was in a remote area of the
Kumaon hills in the state of Uttar Pradesh, about 75
miles east of the city of Dehra Dun and 185 miles
frojm New Delhi.
B. M. Vohra, the commissioner of Dehra Dun
district, told The Associated Press that 32 people
died at Chamoli. Sixty-two houses also were
destroyed.
Another 15 people were killed in nearby
Rudraprayag, Press Trust of India news agency said.
The death toll was likely to rise as reports came in
from remote villages.
Vohra said 10 medical teams and two helicopters
had left for the area to aid earthquake victims.
Today's quake was felt in major northern cities of
Varanasi, Kanpur and Chandigarh.
About 25 minutes after the quake, a series of
aftershocks rumbled across the landscape.
A major earthquake hit the nearby Uttar Kashi
area in 1990, killing hundreds of people.
Workers exposed to toxic metal
TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — During the last five
decades, the U.S. government risked the lives of
thousands of workers by knowingly allowing them to
be exposed to dangerous levels of beryllium, a metal
critical to the military. The Blade reported yester
day.
Numerous government, scientific and industry
reports showed beryllium put workers in extreme
danger, and hundreds of workers exposed to the
metal's dust have contracted beryllium disease, an
incurable and sometimes fatal lung illness. The
Blade reported.
Some workers at private weapons plants in Ohio
and Pennsylvania were exposed to levels of berylli
um dust 1 (K) times federal safety limits, the newspa
per said, citing government records.
Dr. Peter Infante, director of standards review for
the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminis
tration, said the government has failed to protect
workers.
" These are all deaths and disease that could have
been prevented," Infante said. "That's the sad thing
about it."
Beryllium is a gray metal lighter than aluminum
yet six times stiffer than steel. It is vital to the oper
ation of missiles, jet planes and nuclear weapons.
It is not clear how many people have contracted
the disease.
Researchers cite an estimated 1,200 cases and
hundreds of deaths nationwide but say many other
cases are misdiagnosed or undetected.
Attempts by safety regulators to protect workers
from beryllium have been scuttled by defense and
industry officials, The Blade said.
President Carter's defense and energy secretaries
helped kill one safety plan in the 19705.
They feared cutting off beryllium supplies for
weapons would "significantly and adversely affect
our national defense," U.S. Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger wrote to two Cabinet members at the
time.
Fewer Americans are on welfare
WASHINGTON (AP) —Tens of thousands of
Americans have lost welfare benefits, not because
they are working and escaping poverty, but because
they have broken tough new rules.

From state to state, the power to punish is being
wielded quite differently. A 50-state Associated
Press survey found that in some states it rarely is
used, but in others it accounts for half the people
who are leaving welfare.
"It was never like that before," said Sharon Ped
ersen of Denison. lowa, who was dropped from wel
fare last month.
Meanwhile, the time limits expected to end gov
ernment aid for millions of poor people have had lit
tle effect in the 13 states where the clock has run out.
Time limits and penalties, together with work
requirements, were the pillars of the 19% welfare
overhaul. Under the old system, Americans got help
as long as they were poor enough, and states severe
ly were restricted in cutting off checks.
States now are allowed — even encouraged — to
cut assistance for anyone who does not follow their
rules. Even if they do cooperate, people can get help
for only five years — less time in the 22 states with
shorter time limits.
Since 1994, the number of Americans on welfare
has dropped 44 percent, due partly to the strong
economy, but also to states' aggressive punishments.
States punish people not only for failing to partic
ipate in work programs but also for mundane offens
es.
Experts believe those punished fall into two
groups: people already working or supporting them
selves who choose not to follow rules and those with
lives so off-balance they cannot keep it together and
cooperate.
" There's a danger that they simply disappear, and
the ability to work with them and help address prob
lems gets lost," said Mark Greenberg of the Center
for Law and Social Policy.
In many cases, states are giving extensions to peo
ple who try to play by the rules. States also are
exempting many from time limits altogether because
they face tough problems.
Sisters compete for championship
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) — Talk about close
sisters.
Tennis star Venus Williams beat kid sister Serena
in the final of the Lipton Championships yesterday,
but she needed three sets to do it. Venus took eight
of the final nine points and won 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.
It was the first all-sister final in 115 years.
When Serena's forehand landed wide on match
point, there was no show of jubilation from Venus,
or even a smile.
The sisters walked slowly to the net to exchange
high-fives, and then Venus, 18, put her arm around
Serena, 17, as they walked off the court.
Their father, Richard Williams, watched most of
the match from the stands, occasionally holding up
signs for the crowd. One read: "Welcome to the
Williams show."
Venus won $265,000 for her second consecutive
Lipton title. Serena's 16-match winning streak
ended, and she settled for $132,000.
The sisters looked tense throughout the match
but wore broad smiles during the trophy ceremony.
"It's so great Serena is doing so well." Venus said.
"It's so exciting. We're really happy."
Venus dominated the first set, with Serena rarely
able to hit a ball beyond her sister's reach. Serena
was inconsistent from the baseline throughout the
match and had a whopping 66 unforced errors, to 41
for Venus.
"Venus played a great match." Serena said. "It
was very exciting. I'm glad I was able to come back
from the first-set deficit and make it more interest
ing for the crowd."
Venus now leads the sibling rivalry 3-0.
According to the W'TA Tour, the only other all-sis
ter women's final took place at Wimbledon in 1884,
when Maud Watson beat her older sister. Lilian.

rules. Even if they do cooperate, people can get help
for only five years — less time in the 22 states with
shorter time limits.
Since 1994, the number of Americans on welfare
has dropped 44 percent, due partly to the strong
economy, but also to states' aggressive punishments.
States punish people not only for failing to partic
ipate in work programs but also for mundane offens
es.
Experts believe those punished fall into two
groups: people already working or supporting them
selves who choose not to follow rules and those with
lives so off-balance they cannot keep it together and
cooperate.
" There's a danger that they simply disappear, and
the ability to work with them and help address prob
lems gets lost," said Mark Greenberg of the Center
for Law and Social Policy.
In many cases, states are giving extensions to peo
ple who try to play by the rules. States also are
exempting many from time limits altogether because
they face tough problems.
Sisters compete for championship
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) — Talk about close
sisters.
Tennis star Venus Williams beat kid sister Serena
in the final of the Lipton Championships yesterday,
but she needed three sets to do it. Venus took eight
of the final nine points and won 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.
It was the first all-sister final in 115 years.
When Serena's forehand landed wide on match
point, there was no show of jubilation from Venus,
or even a smile.
The sisters walked slowly to the net to exchange
high-fives, and then Venus, 18, put her arm around
Serena, 17, as they walked off the court.
Their father, Richard Williams, watched most of
the match from the stands, occasionally holding up
signs for the crowd. One read: "Welcome to the
Williams show."
Venus won $265,000 for her second consecutive
Lipton title. Serena's 16-match winning streak
ended, and she settled for $132,000.
The sisters looked tense throughout the match
but wore broad smiles during the trophy ceremony.
"It's so great Serena is doing so well." Venus said.
"It's so exciting. We're really happy."
Venus dominated the first set, with Serena rarely
able to hit a ball beyond her sister's reach. Serena
was inconsistent from the baseline throughout the
match and had a whopping 66 unforced errors, to 41
for Venus.
"Venus played a great match." Serena said. "It
was very exciting. I'm glad I was able to come back
from the first-set deficit and make it more interest
ing for the crowd."
Venus now leads the sibling rivalry 3-0.
According to the W'TA Tour, the only other all-sis
ter women's final took place at Wimbledon in 1884,
when Maud Watson beat her older sister. Lilian.
