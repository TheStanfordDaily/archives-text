BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
(AP) — NATO ordered up more
firepower yesterday for its assault
against Serb forces, racing against
time to smash Serb military units
and head off what it called "geno
cide" against Kosovo Albanians.
Thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees, telling tales of systematic
Serb brutality, tied into neighboring
Albania and Macedonia. Officials
in both countries pleaded for
international help to prevent a
humanitarian crisis, and Albania
called for NATO ground troops to
enter Kosovo — something NA TO
says it has no plans to do.
Violence in Kosovo has
increased sharply since foreign
observers left the province and
NATO began its airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, which is dominated by
Serbs. NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea said in Brussels that the
airstrikes were no excuse for Serbs
to slaughter Kosovo Albanians.
For its part, Yugoslavia's gov
ernment-controlled news media
said yesterday that Kosovo Albani
ans were attacking Serb security
forces and civilians. Ethnic Albani
ans far outnumber Serbs in Kosovo,
a Yugoslav province.
NATO promised to broaden
attacks on Serb ground forces in
Kosovo, despite the downing of a
U.S. stealth bomber Saturday night.
"We have to recognize that we
are now on the brink of a major
humanitarian disaster ... the likes
of which we have not seen in
Europe since the closing days of
World War II," said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea.
"Genocide is starting here,"
German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said in a television inter
view with station ZDF.
In Belgrade, thousands of defi
ant Serbs attended an anti-NATO
outdoor concert despite air raid
sirens that signaled continuing mis

sile attacks.
Another siren sounded in the
late afternoon in Belgrade, Nis and
Kragujevac, signaling the start of
the fifth straight night of bombing
and missile raids
More missiles fired yesterday
afternoon at a military airport at
Podgorica, capital of the Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro, hit a MiCi

21 jet fighter and an army vehicle, a
Yugoslav army source said.
Three F-117A stealth fighters
and four other fighter jets took off
from the NATO air base in Aviano,
Italy, just after dark.
Protests against the airstrikes
also continued, with 7,(HK) demon
strators in Sydney, Australia,
marching on the U.S. consulate.
