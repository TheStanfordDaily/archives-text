# Russia negotiates with IMF
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Only minor differences remain
between Russia and the International Monetary Fund
over a new loan package, a Russian official said after
talks yesterday with the visiting IMF chief.
But IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus was
less sanguine about negotiations for the aid that
Moscow badly wants hut the IMF has been reluctant to
approve.
Russia's top negotiator with the fund. First Deputy
Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, said there were just
"millimeters" of disagreement left, including differ
ences over Russia's policy on its influential energy
monopolies, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
Maslyukov said Camdessus' scheduled meetings
today would be decisive. He is to meet with President
Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the
head of natural gas monopoly Gazprom, Rem
Vyakhirev and the head of Russia's electricity giant
Unified Energy Systems, Anatoly Chubais.
Camdessus, when he heard of Maslyukov's com
ments, laughed and said he would have to ask
Maslyukov how he defined "millimeter."
"My wish is to reach this agreement as soon as pos
sible," Camdessus said on Russia's NTV television

early today.
But he said there were still gaps in understanding,
including over Russia's ehronic problems with collect
ing taxes.
Maslyukov said he and the IMF chief discussed rev
enues for this month, which "could have been better,"
the Interfax news agency quoted Maslyukov as saying.
According to preliminary estimates, the government
will have taken in $1.3 billion in revenues in March
instead of the $l.ft billion targeted. Maslyukov said.
Primakov had been scheduled to meet with
Camdessus in Washington last week.
The Russian prime minister canceled the trip in
midair after learning that NATO airstrikes on
Yugoslavia were imminent. Russia staunchly opposes
the attacks.
Camdessus then agreed to come to Moscow. The
IMF chief, who arrived Saturday, said on NTV that the
talks had not been affected by the rilt between Russia
and the West over the bombings.
Russia is seeking about $<X billion from the IMF,
largely to avoid defaulting on huge foreign debts. But
the IMF is demanding that Russia first come up with a
viable plan to revive its shattered economy.
