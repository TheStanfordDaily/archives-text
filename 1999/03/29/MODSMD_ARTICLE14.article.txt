GRENOBLE, France (AP)-
French police began the grim task
yesterday of identifying the
remains of at least 40 people who
died in an inferno in the Mont
Blanc tunnel. Firefighters said the
death toll could still rise.
Police investigators were able
to enter the tunnel yesterday
morning after firefighters worked
through the night to reduce tem
peratures by spraying water
throughout the blackened road
way.
Most of the victims remain
inside, where all but a few died in
their vehicles. Authorities warned
that the process of retrieving the
dead would be slower than expect
ed because of the risk the seven
mile tunnel's heat-damaged ceiling
could fall in.
Yesterday, two bodies were
retrieved from the tunnel, which

links France and Italy under West
ern Europe's highest peak.
Of the 40 bodies found in the
tunnel, only five have been identi
fied, according to Gwenaelle Le
Slao, a spokeswoman for the
regional government of the Haute-
Savoie area. "The process is par
ticularly difficult because some of
the bodies have been reduced to
ashes," she said.
Families of the victims arrived
near the tunnel's entrance in Cha
monix and in the Alps city of
Annecy, where crisis centers have
been set up. Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin was expected to survey the
site of the disaster Monday.
The fire broke out Wednesday
in a Belgian truck carrying flour
and margarine through the tunnel,
and raged until Friday afternoon,
when dozens of firefighters from
France, Italy and Switzerland

managed to control the blaze.
Tunnel officials, police and lire
fighters have been reluctant to talk
about what might have led to the
inferno. Investigators have not
been able to examine the entire
tunnel, but will spend the next few
days combing through the wreck
age.
French judicial authorities have
opened an investigation, and say
criminal charges may eventually
be brought.
Firefighters who emerged after
working for hours in the tunnel
were often unable to speak about
what they had seen. All were
offered psychological counseling.
The tunnel near the French
Alpine resort of Chamonix serves
as a major trucking route. It is
expected to be closed for weeks.
Local politicians are calling for
the roadway to close permanently.
