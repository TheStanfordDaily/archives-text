U.S. News rankings
cannot address needs
of all future students

WHAT ARE THE ingredi
ents of academic quality in
university graduate pro
grams?
If your source is U.S. News and
World Report's rankings for 20(H), a
law school's academic quality is 40
percent reputation, 25 percent stu
dent selectivity, 20 percent job place
ment success and 15 percent faculty
resources. A business school's quality
is made up of 40 percent reputation,
35 percent job placement success and
25 percent student selectivity.
Of course, every student would like
to think that she is part of an academ
ic program of the highest caliber.
But rankings such as those done by
U.S. News are inevitably arbitrary
with regard to how "academic quali
ty" is defined and measured.
Choosing a graduate program is an
important and difficult decision.
Every prospective student has his or
her own needs in mind when selecting
a school — one student may be con
fined with landing a high-fraying-jab
after graduation, another may place a
high priority on faculty members with
particular areas of specialty.
By creating its rankings using fixed
proportions for "reputation," "selec
tivity," "placement success," etc., U.S.
News assumes that these various
qualities are of equal importance to
all prospective applicants.
The magazine has found a way to
capitalize on the need for information

in a fast-paced, ratings-obsessed soci
ety. But when it comes to choosing
academic programs, students don't
need superlatives; they need to know
which programs will serve their indi
vidual academic needs.
Stanford has a strong history of
protesting the U.S. News rankings.
University President Gerhard
Casper has refused to fill out surveys
for the magazine for several years and
has even pondered removing Stan
ford from consideration in the annual
rankings process. In April of 1997,
Casper launched a Web site where
statistics about Stanford's students
and its programs could be found. He
encouraged other universities to do
the same to create a free source of
information where prospective stu
dents eould objectively compare uni
versities based on data, not on rank
ings.
Casper received support from Law
School Dean Paul Brest, who said
that he would also urge U.S. News to
discontinue its rankings of law
schools.
Additionally, a student group
called the Forget U.S. News Coalition
urged students at other universities to
protest the magazine's rankings sys
tem. mmmmfmmmm
With upcoming leadership changes
at the Law School (where Prof. Kath
leen Sullivan will replace Brest in the
fall) and the Business School (where
Dean Michael Spence is stepping
down), we hope that this history of
resistance to commercial rankings of
university programs will continue.
The ingredients of academic quali
ty are not, and do not have to be, the
same for all students.
