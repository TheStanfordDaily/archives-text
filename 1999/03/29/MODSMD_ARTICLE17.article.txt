Questioning Hoover's ties to George W. Bush

Stanford's affiliation with the Hoover
Institution is again involving the Universi
ty in national politics. This time the candi
date is Texas Clov. George W. Bush, not
Ronald Reagan. Bush's advisors have
been drawn from around the country. The
New York Times noted, "hut there is a
particularly heavy representation from the
Hoover Institution." The Times featured
four Hoover-Stanford participants, includ
ing former Hoover Fellow (hv courtesy)
and University Provost Condoleezza Rice.
When questions were asked during the
Reagan administration about the wisdom
of close relations between a politically
active think tank and a university, then-
President Donald Kennedy proposed get
ting closer to Hoover, not divorcing it.
Gerhard Casper's position is that "Hoover
is of, and not at. Stanford."
Questions raised in 1983 occur again
with even greater urgency. Most impor
tantly, what is such an institution doing
here? What are the costs, not just the ben
efits, of continuing and deepening rela
tions with Iloover?

The Hoover Institution has traditional
ly been oriented toward Europe, and its
Latin American program was cut back
sharply.
1 have been paying a great deal of
attention to U.S.-Mexican relations, which
I view as a prime concern for the United
States.
1 helped initiate two programs in Mexi
co, both linking Stanford to the University
of the Americas in Puebla (UDLA).
The first takes a group of Hooverites to
UDLA each year, and the second is the
Stanford campus at UDLA.
While Hoover was thus turning its
attention to Mexico, the Republican Party
was looking to Texas Gov. George W.
Bush as its probable Republican candi
date.
His special interest in neighboring
Mexico has coincided with that now evi
dent at Hoover.
A number of Hoover fellows have gone
to Austin. Texas for talks with him.
There may not be a complete meeting
of minds, since Hoover is the intellectual
home of those promoting a flat tax. a rad
ical proposal which Bush has not favored
publicly.
In any case, there is widespread conjec
ture that, should Bush become president,
Hooverites will figure prominently in his

administration.
Mexico is naturally interested. There
was a front-page interview with Bush in El
Norte of Monterrey.
The same newspaper reproduced the
next day the important New York Times
article on the seminars which have been
organized for the Governor to bring him
up to speed on international and econom
ic issues.
The story stated: "Participants have
been chosen from all over the United
States, but there is a particularly heavy
representation from the Hoover Institu
tion."
Among the Hoover people named are
economists Martin Anderson and Michael
Boskin and. heading Bush's foreign policy
staff. Condoleezza Rice.
The Mexican government is following
the Bush candidacy very carefully.
President Ernesto Zedillo hosted a din
ner for American investors in which he
assured them that his government would
give them every encouragement.
This hospitality may not be encouraged
by many Mexicans, notably by those of the
left-wing PRD.
This group is led by Cuauhtemoc Car
denas, the son of Lazaro Cardenas, who is
the hero of Mexican critics of U.S. capital
ism.

The question of the Mexican border is
crucial. There are several main issues.
I he tirst is the maquiladoras, low-cost
Mexican plants which American manufac
turers use and which do not respect U.S.
labor or sanitation standards.
Republican populist candidate Patrick
Buchanan is harshly critical of them since
they undermine the bargaining power of
American workers. Bush seems to have
avoided the issue.
Then there is the issue of illegal immi
gration. Politically this is a complex issue.
In general, the Republicans whom
Buchanan detests do not take a hard line
on this since it is a source of cheap labor.
The Democrats fear losing the votes of
Mexican Americans. Mexicans would love
to have free unlimited migration into the
United States.
Any objection to this is damned as
racism. Both American parties are walk
ing on this tightrope.
What is Bush's policy about this?
These are all precise questions which
generalities about good relations with
Mexico do not answer.
1 hope the Hoover trio will answer
them.
