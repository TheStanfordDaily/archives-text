## Can you ever go home again? 
### 
Mari Webel

PARTICULARLY
at times when col
lege students have
the chance to flee home
ward. someone inevitably
says something like, "Well,
you know, they say you can
never go home again."

II" you are from the inner reaches of the
nation — the gray area that exists east of
Nevada and west of New York City's subur
ban sprawl — the coastal members of our
community who know little of that glorious,
terrible place we call the Midwest will won
der why you left California at all. They might
also be curious as to why you failed to opt for
the closer, more attractive alternative of a
warm vacation in SoCal or Mexico.
But as for home, folks, this Spring Break,
I did it, and I'd like to debunk the myth. You
can go IJDtnv again,
pared for some weird stuff.
Should you deign to visit your high school
or any school you've attended in the past,
you will find the student body shorter, peppi
er, somehow inexplicably puppy-dog cuter
and dressed far more trendy than you were
when you were there. Your teachers will
look a little more human — like you—and
school buses might seem like some strange
feat of transportation. The cars in the park
ing lot will be different. There will be more
gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles regardless
of your proximity to off-roading territory,
and the little brothers and sisters of your
friends will go careening past you on any
given street.
A favorite park, restaurant or store will be
missing from your local landscape, and you
will find that it has been replaced by the lat
est part of the McDonalds / Starbucks /

Blockbuster craze which seems to be taking
over the world.
You will speak a different language than
nearly everyone around you. You will recog
nize accents that you never knew existed.
You will want to make references to things
you have heard and studied that no one else
will understand. Tom Stoppard is not just a
screenwriter for "Shakespeare in Love," and
you will know that. Your parents will not
understand why you have to give as much
time to your old friends from high school —
if there are any survivors from the breach we
suffered the summer before freshman
year — and why you appear to keep strange
hours. You will need your parents' car.
Desperately.
People will approach you somewhere
between familiar child and foreign adult, and
they will not know how to respond to you.
'ufpin dov^ilUikely^rum^'n'/the
face of a sense of propriety and the natural
order of things (namely that "Ph.D." does
not equal job) which doesn't quite make
sense.
Of course, problems which arise from
departures apply more often than not to
anyone who really left home, regardless of
distance. You who have separated your
selves somehow but retained some sense of
place or "homeness" which is difficult to
describe. This sense of place is one of the
most efficient devices to temper the self-cen
teredness and academic snobbery that we
are allowed, if not encouraged, to have while
in college.
I have heard fellow students complain
about the Stanford Bubble from which light
cannot escape and into which little informa
tion of the outside world may penetrate, and

going home makes its existence plainly
apparent.
So, home: love it or hate it? After battling
over use of a vehicle with my mother this
morning, and knowing that in 45 minutes I'll
have to sit down and be civil at lunch with
both of my parents, I'll get back to you. I
kind of feel like it's the emotional equivalent
of the proverbial yearly check-up. One has to
have some baseline by which to gauge the
rest of the year and some way to center the
whirlwind of college.
Perhaps being home is more a shock to
our young systems because it is the real
world.
If so, then it's a shock that we need more
than we probably realize. When parents
threaten to move away from our ancestral
stomping grounds, there is a sense of indig
nation seldom found elsewhere. Not only is it
twto<jre were*irom, but it gives us a sense of
identity in an environment which, through
the selectivity of admissions, can produce a
homogenized population of sorts. People
know you, for better or worse.
While I shiver in the Midwest and look
out to the bare branches and slate-gray sky of
late winter, anything remotely tropical looks
attractive.
It is by coming home that I remember
why college is important, and why it is also
wholly unnecessary. The details of distin
guishing between the two are best left
unsaid, but think about it.
Use the answers to figure out who you
have been and who you are becoming.

Spring Break.
