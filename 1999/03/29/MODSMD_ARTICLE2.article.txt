## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Jeremy Smith, former financial
manager of La Casa Italiana, has re
ceived 30 days in jail, two years of
probation and 150 hours of commu
nity service for stealing more than
$20,(XX) of house funds last year.
Smith, who pleaded no contest to
felony charges, will serve out the jail
time through weekend work pro
grams at Elm wood Jail in Milpitas.
At his sentencing hearing on
March 11. he showed up with a check
for $23,877. the amount he owed in
restitution to La Casa Italiana, ac
cording to Neal Kimball of the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's of
fice, who was the prosecutor at the
hearing.
Neither Smith nor his attorney,
William Campbell of the public de
fender's office, could be reached for
comment. Smith transferred to an
other school after leaving Stanford
and currently lives in Mountain
View.
Laurette Beeson, the assistant di
rector of student management at
Residential Education's Row office,
said the money had not yet made its
way to her office. When it does ar
rive, some will be given to the house,
but the rest will be given back to resi
dents of the house from winter and
spring quarter last year and fall quar
ter this year, Beeson said.
Kimball said the prompt return of
the money "surprised everyone" and
"motivated the court" to lighten
Smith's punishment. 1 he statute
punishment for Smith's offense is 16
months to three years instate prison,
but Kimball said "a young guy in
[Smith's] position" would always be
likely to receive probation of some

sort.
I lowever. the 30 days Smith re
ceived are a condition of his proba
tion and, according to Kimball, the
court might have made him spend
that time continuously in the county
jail rather than in weekend work pro
grams.
Smith stole the money over the
course of winter and spring quarters
of the 1997-1998 academic year. He
was supposed to remain financial
manager through fall quarter of this
year but unexpectedly left Stanford.
His successor, Amanda Hardin,
noted some irregularities, and when
Smith refused to turn over the house
records to Student Management.
Beeson became suspicious and alert
ed police.
The money Smith took came out
of the house's reserve, money held
over from previous quarters to cover
expenses at the beginning of the new
year, and the theft left the house tem
porarily penniless and in debt.
Beeson said Bardin. who has since
graduated, was "incredibly responsi
ble" about putting the house finances
back in order, and added that Bardin
had originally run against Smith for
financial manager last year.
Smith was the first prosecuted
case of theft by a financial manager
that Beeson knew of. She added that
since the case began she has "set in
place a number of programs, and ex
pectations for financial managers, to
ensure this never happens again."
The new measures include pro
hibiting house accounts from having
ATM cards that can be used for with
drawals; requiring managers to write
policies on refunds, surpluses and
whether house checks require two
signatures; using a bookkeeping
computer program called Quick
books, designed to make reporting
and keeping track of money easier; a
mandatory internal audit every
quarter by some resident other than
the financial manager; and audits of
random houses throughout the year
by Beeson's own office.
According to Beeson, several of
these measures were already being
contemplated before the theft be
came known, but that the case "has
helped a lot in terms of raising peo
ple's consciousness," and that there
had been no complaints about the
new requirements.
She added that financial man
agers were often happy to have some
oversight, and that the measures
were designed to cut down on unin
tentional mismanagement as well as
outright fraud.
