## What's wrong with bad writing

SI'BMI 1 A POORLY written under
graduate essay and fail a class. Sub
mit a poorly written article for an
academic review and win a prize.
So goes the logic of the journal Philoso
phy and Literature, which bestows awards
pome of the country's top scholars as
fnfrt of its Bad Writing Contest, an annual
indictment of the academic world's head
long plunge into incoherence. An example
Irom this year's winner, UC-Berkeley pro
lessor and noted cultural critic Judith But
ler: " 1 he insights into the contingent pos
sibility of structure inaugurate a renewed
conception of hegemony."
Ot course, "winners" such as Butler
don't see their writing as bad but as intel
lectually demanding. And they don't view
thp-il" writing as a source of parody but as a
legitimate vehicle for certain political or
ideological agendas. But in their impas
sioned attempts to reshape society, these
practitioners of poor prose have not only
provided us with unintended comedy but
also failed to live up to a writer's most
basic promise: to communicate

something — anything — that readers can
use in their lives.
In a piece in The New York Times,
Butler defended her writing, claiming that
potentially obscure language is sometimes
necessary to question prevailing power
structures and their often oppressive
stances.
Language that can avoid the "common
sense" of received "truths" can, in her
words, "help point the way to a more
socially just world."
The belief in language's power to shape
our perceptions — and thus our percep
tions of the truth — is hardly new. It stems
from Butler and her colleagues' intellectu
al predecessors, a group of European
philosophers like Derrida, Sartre and Fou
cault, who themselves used difficult lan
guage to get at difficult problems.
It seems somewhat foolish, then, to
argue that language does not lie near the
heart of any society's composition, or that
to manipulate language is not to manipu
late the ways in which a society functions.
But this argument does not bolster the
"bad" writers' claims that their peculiar

brand of complicated writing is any more
powerful or persuasive than simpler lan
guage.
Indeed, some of our most radical
thinkers have used rhetorical simplicity to
incite social change. In the writings of
Martin Luther King Jr. and Thomas Jef
ferson, to name but a couple, one receives
the tools to understand and combat injus
tice without the esoteric jargon.
In fact, the presence of effective social
activist writing that does not employ the
tricks of academic debate seems to contra
dict one of the "bad" writers' most strenu
ous defenses.
They argue that because their compli
cated writing often concerns such contro
versial matters as feminism, ethnic and
queer studies and Marxism, attacks on
their scholarly techniques are really veiled
attacks on their politics.
However, if writers such as King and
Jefferson are admired and those like But
ler are ridiculed, despite their similar
stands on social equality, does it not mean
that a significant reason behind their dif
ferent receptions is indeed their styles?

It seems a great failure on the intellec
tual critics' behalf to argue the impossibil
ity of believing in similar political agendas
without upholding the same rhetorical
methods.
However, the greatest failure of the
"bad" writers is their incomprehensibility.
On one level, their complexity does not
engender any longed-for sense of commu
nity but creates two factions: those who
understand and those who don't. It is no
wonder that the wave of anti-intellectual
ism reaches so high in this country. After
all. we do not like what we cannot com
prehend.
Moreover, their incomprehensibility
does not seem to be the correct weapon to
combat, as Butler would say, "hegemony."
A super-structure of advertising, media
and pop culture, which professes the won
ders of dumb consumerism, dominates all
forms of dialogue in today's world, and to
try to tear it down with the feeble arrows
of obscure vocabularies and inane gram
matical structures is not just silly but
shameful.
Practitioners of bad writing do not even

seem to want to combat "hegemony."
With their intellectual factions of academ
ic gibberish, they, like drug addicts or
cultists, want to hide from the oppressive
forces of society, hoping that either their
miniscule acts of rebellion will affect some
change or that all the confining pressures
will miraculously disappear, and they can
re-emerge victorious.
We know that language is powerful;
however, we now know that not all forms
of language are effective. If obscure lan
guage were all that was needed to create
Utopia, then late 20th-century literature
would have already brought us out of the
darkness. Unfortunately it has not, and so
the intellectual and the academic must rec
ognize this failure and alter their
approaches.
The task of the intellectual can no
longer be the profession of linguistic
abstractions but the communication of
that which is immediate, palpable and real.
