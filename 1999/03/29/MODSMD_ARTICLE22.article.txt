According to the latest rankings of grad
uate schools from U.S. News and World
Report released this past weekend. Stan
ford's graduate schools all retained their
positions in the top 10, with only small
shifts upward or downward.
I he Graduate School of Business re
tained its No. 1 position from last year, a po
sition it shared with Harvard last year,
which has dropped to No. 2 in this year's
rankings. Hie Law School also retained its
number two slot from last year, alongside
Harvard, with Yale occupying the top posi
tion. The School of Engineering remained
rooted to its traditional second spot, be
hind MI 1.1 he School of Medicine, howev
er, dropped one place to 10th overall, tying
with UCLA and the University of Michi
gan. 1 he School of Education moved up

one place to third, behind Harvard and Co
lumbia.
Aside from these rankings in major
graduate programs, Stanford also per
formed very well in other specialty areas,
topping the list for doctoral programs in bi
ology. computer science, economics,
physics and psychology and taking second
place for programs in English, history,
chemistry and mathematics.
The annual rankings, published first in
1987 and annually since 1990, are deter
mined using criteria such as academic rep
utation, the caliber of students that a pro
gram attracts — measured using average
grade point averages and test scores of en
tering classes — and how much money a
university spends on a program.
However, according to US News, some
changes were made in its methodology this
year.
For instance, in the law school rankings,

the measure of how much money a univer
sity spends on a school was adjusted to ac
count for different costs of living in differ
ent regions. For business schools, the mea
sure of total pay for graduates now includes
any signing bonus as well as base salary. In
medicine, more schools are now included
in the magazine's separate ranking for the
top primary care schools to reflect an in
creased emphasis on teaching primary care
physicians.
U.S. News claims the annual rankings
are helpful to students choosing a graduate
school because, among other reasons, they
are "based on accepted measures of acade
mic quality," but the rankings have been
criticized by many administrators in acade
mia.
Stanford President Gerhard Casper has
in the past criticized the magazine's rank
ings, saying "much about these rankings...
is utterly misleading."
