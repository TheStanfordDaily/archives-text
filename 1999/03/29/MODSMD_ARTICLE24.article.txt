# Korean conference explores 'han'

Stanford played host over Spring
Break to the 13th annual Korean-Ameri
can Student Conference, the largest stu
dent ethnic convention in America, with
almost 6(H) delegates from more than 100
schools.
The three-day conference, organized
by 30 students from Stanford and UC-
Berkeley, began at the Crowne Plaza
Hotel in Foster City, with the final day's
events taking place at Stanford.
The theme of this year's conference
was "Empowering the Han." Han is a
complicated Korean term, meaning many
things: a racial sense of incompleteness, a
history of oppression, and personal woe.
John Lim, a Stanford sophomore and
public liaison for the conference, ex
pressed it succinctly: "silent discontent."
The conference explored many issues
stemming from the han, from the 1992
Los Angeles riots to Koreans' "model mi
nority" status to the position of Korean-
American churches.
The purpose of the conference, Lim
said, was to understand the Korean

American's role in America, to overcome
the han in order to participate in democ
racy and integrate into society and to
learn "what parts of your race contribute
and what parts hold you back."
The convention consisted of cultural
performances and discussions. Among
the performances were Korean tradition
al acts, as well as cross-cultural pieces em
phasizing the intersection of Korean and
American art forms.
Many notable public figures spoke at
the conference including film director
Chris Chan Lee, Berkeley mayor Shirley
Dean, Palo Alto mayor Gary Fazzino and
UC-Berkeley Prof. Elaine Kim.
For many of the students, however, the
most moving speaker was Yoon Shim
Kim, a former "comfort woman," from
Korea. Speaking through a translator, she
told her story: how she was kidnapped at
the age of 13 and forced into sexual slav
ery for the Japanese military, and how she
was ostracized by her mother and her
community when she managed to survive
and return home.
Yoon Shim Kim "told a touching,
beautiful story," said Angela Ser, a junior

from the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. "Her sadness is what hit
you."
The closing speech was given outdoors
in the inner quad by Angela Oh, a mem
ber of the advisory board to President
Clinton's initiative on race.
She summed up many of the confer
ence's main themes. She demanded that
Korean Americans accept both sides of
their cultures and not shrink back into
Korean-dominated environments. "To
succeed, you must look beyond the Kore
an-American community," she said " The
greatest honor is bringing yourself where
people don't know who you are."
When asked what they had gained
from the conference, students talked
about the Korean-American identity.
Ser said, "I have a lot more knowledge
about the Korean-American community,
about how we are perceived and how we
are different from that." Liin agreed,
"Korean Americans come from two dif
ferent worlds; identity as Americans and
as Koreans .... Rather than go to 100
percent to the American [or the Korean],
one must go towards both cultures."
