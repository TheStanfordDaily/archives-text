fort. A second-place finish.
After two days of close competi
tion, the Georgia Lady Bulldogs
pulled away from the Stanford
women's swimming and diving teams
to capture the 1999 NCAA champi
onship trophy in Athens, Ga on

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ March 18-20: No. 2 Stanford fin
ished second at NCAA Champi
onships.

The championship was the Bull
dog's first, and dozens of red-clad
fans came to cheer the home team on
at the Gabrielsen Natatorium as No.
1 Georgia clinched victory on the
final night of competition.
"They got that ball rolling and it

just picked up steam," Stanford coach
Richard Quick said of the Bulldogs.
"They had a great performance. We
scored 19 more points than in the
championships last year when we
won. I was thrilled with our team's
performance. Georgia was just too
much today."
The meet remained close through
out the first two days of competition.
No. 2 Stanford trailed Georgia by a
mere 11.5 points going into the day
three finals, hut an inspired perfor
mance by the Bulldogs put the title
out of reach. The final score stood at
Georgia 504.5, Stanford 441.
The meet marked the 11th
straight NCAA championship in
which Stanford has placed in the lop
two. The Cardinal has never placed
lower than third in the IS years that
the NCAAs have been held.
"it was a really close meet," said
senior Emily Smith. "We just didn't
have enough in the end. Georgia

swam incredibly well."
Facing a larger Georgia team, the
Cardinal came through with numer
ous spectacular swims and clutch

dives. Like the final outcome of the
meet, however, even record-setting

performances weren't always
enough. Stanford junior Catherine

Fox, for example, broke the Ameri
can record in the l(X)-yard backstroke
only to be touched out by Canadian
bom California senior Marylyn Chi
ang.
"Shelly and I were just trying to do

everything we could [to help the team
close the gap on the Bulldogs]," Fox
said. "We went in there and gave it
our best shot."
Fox came away with more than
the American record, however. The

sprinting star defended her title in the
50-yard freestyle and was a member
of the first-place 8(X)-vard freestyle
relay.
Along with Fox. Stanford sopho
more and 1998 NCAA Swimmer of
the Year Misty Hyman exemplified
the Cardinal's meet. Despite a career
best time in the 200-yard butterfly
and an outstanding performance in
the 200-vard backstroke, Hyman
placed second in both events.
"I'm ecstatic," Hyman said. "I re
ally didn't expect to go nearly that
fast, especially with swimming the 2(X)
back minutes before."
Hyman also reclaimed her title in
the 100-yard butterfly and swam in all
three of Stanford's first-place relay
teams. After only two years, she has
already become among the most dec
orated NCAA swimmers in history
with nine NCAA titles to her name.
Another success story of the meet
was senior co-captain Elin
Austevoll's swan song performances
in the 1 (X)- and 200-yard breaststroke.
In what was likely her last competi
tive meet, Austevoll obliterated her
career-bests in both events. In the
200. she had the misfortune of swim
ming against Georgia's American
record-holder Kristv Kowal, who
lowered her own American record in
the event by 1.40 seconds. Austevoll
hung tenaciously just behind Kowal
throughout the race and finished in
2:09.99. The time dropped
Austevoll's own Stanford record by
more than a second.
"My goal was to get under 2:10,
and I did it bv one one-hundredth of a

second," Austevoll said. "It's a little
bittersweet because it's my last [colle
giate] race, but I'm really, really
happy with my time."
Other Stanford finalists were
swimmers Shelly Ripple and
Gabrielle Rose and diver Kim Pow
ers. Ripple, a freshman, turned in a

remarkable race in the 100-yard
backstroke to capture fourth place.
Rose was a finalist in both the 200-
yard freestyle and individual medley,
placing eighth in both events. Powers
replicated her placement from last
year with sixth-place finishes in both
the three-meter and platform.
