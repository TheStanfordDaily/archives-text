NORFOLK, Va. — With 12
NCAA tournament appearances, six
Final Fours and two national champi
onships, the Stanford Cardinal is a
postseason powerhouse used to play
ing at home for the first two rounds.
This year, the Cardinal did not domi
nate opponents, finishing third in the
Pacific 10 Conference and finding it
self as a No. 7 seed in the tournament.
Stanford (18-12) was sent packing
to Norfolk. Va„ to play No. 10 seed
ed Maine (24-6) in the first round, on
a road trip that was disastrous from
start to finish.

from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. with a worn

runners-up in the America East Con

Senior Regan Freuen drives to the hoop in Jordanesque fashion in
Stanford's March 12 first-round 60-58 loss to Maine.
Simply put, the game was ugly.
Stanford shot only 29 percent from
the field, with its starters going 9 for
40. Sophomore center Carolyn Moos
was 0 for 6 for the game, her only
points coming in the last minute off of
two free throws.
After scoring the first two points,
the Cardinal allowed Maine to go on
an 8-orun. a period that saw the Black
Bears began to stifle Stanford with an
elementary 3-2 zone. Maine continu
ally collapsed on Moos, never allow
ing the 6-foot-6 center to get into an
offensive rhythm. Stanford tried un
successfully throughout the game to
pass the ball into the post, hut the ball
seemed to either find its way into the
hands of a Maine player or out of
bounds off the hands of Stanford
players.
"We're not versatile enough in sit
uations and we can't play a lot of dif

ferent looks. I don't know [if] we're a
good passing team." said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "This is not a
championship team. We're not a
great team. We've been able to find
ways to win.
As poorly as the Cardinal was
playing, Maine wasn't much better,
and the Cardinal found itself down by
only four, 30-26, going into the'locker
room.
The Cardinal continued to look
mentally out of it in the second half.
The only bright spot for Stanford was
freshman guard Lindsey Yamasaki.
Coming off the bench, Yamasaki led
all players with 24 points, making 6 of
11 from behind the three-point arc.
She was able to keep the Cardinal in
it for most of the game, but Stanford
was never able to take the lead, only
tying the score three times in the sec
ond half.
"We needed four Lindseys out
there," said VanDerveer.
Except for Yamasaki, the Cardi
nal trulv did not have anv offense.

making only one two-point field goal
in the second half. However, Stan
ford found itself still in the game with
less than a minute to go as Moos tied
the game at 58 on two free throws. On
the defensive end, Yamasaki fouled
center Martina Tinklova, who pro
ceeded to make both free throws.
With 16 ticks on the clock, Flores
led the Cardinal down the floor, dish
ing it off to Yamasaki at the top of the
key. She was unable to find an open
shot, and as time wound down, she
passed it over to senior Regan
Freuen. The 6-1 guard finally found
an open look on the right baseline,
but there were to be no storybook
endings as the ball clattered off the
rim and into the hands of a Maine
player.
"1 was very disappointed we didn't
do a better job," VanDerveer said.
"We just fell short in a lot of areas. We
didn't do a good enough job re
bounding, we struggled with our
perimeter shooting and defensively
we had a hard time.'"
