# Gonzaga ends men's dream season in second round
## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
SEATI'LE — No one would have ever imagined that
it would end like this.
The magic ran out on the Stanford men's basketball
team in the second round of the NCAA Tournament in

Seattle, and the Cardinal lost an S2-74 shocker to l()th
seeded Gonzaga.
Heading into the season, expectations were sky-high.
And why not? Arthur Lee appeared on the cover of
Sports Illustrated, and the publication proclaimed "Stan
ford is No. 1
And no one could argue, considering Stanford re

turned its entire team from last year's Final Four run.
The main problem was that from day one, it was obvi
ous this was not the same team.
The many differences had been apparent all season
long. But they were most obvious and detrimental in the
national limelight. And in the tournament's win-or-go
home format, that meant a bitter defeat for Stanford.

MEN S BASKETBALL
■ March 13: No. 10 seed Gonzaga (28-7) 82, No. 2 seed
Stanford (26-7) 74.

First off, the Cardinal was crushed by injuries through
out the season. Junior forward Ryan Mendez took a red
shirt year with a knee injury—the same sharpshooter who
came off the bench countless times in last year's memo
rable run through the tournament. His touch was evident
in the first-round game against College of Charleston.
With Stanford down late, Mendez hit a pair of huge threes
to lift the Cardinal to a thrilling win. But along with sopho
more Jason Collins, Mendez spent the tourney on the
bench in street clothes, wondering with the rest of us what
might have been.
Second, last year's team blew people out of the water
early. They came out of the locker room smoking and
never looked back. There was no fear, no hesitation in
that squad — see the Final Four game against Kentucky
and the Cardinal's 18-5 early lead for evidence. This sea
son. however, Stanford found itself battling from behind
in just about every game.
It happened again against Gonzaga. The Bulldogs
were up 13 points less than nine minutes into the game.
But Stanford did a great job battling back. The Cardi
nal climbed to within four points at the half on a phenom
enal basket by Peter Sauer as time expired. Stanford had
weathered its own first-half storm with awesome play
from junior forward Mark Madsen, and appeared ready to
settle in and burst Gonzaga's bubble.
And a comeback looked even more likely when the
Cardinal knotted the score at 49 early in the second peri
od. But the Zags shocked everyone in a Cardinal jersey by
doing something better than any opponent had all season
— answering each and every comeback effort.

The Cardinal had only three possessions with a chance
to take the lead in the second half and trailed for 39 min
utes, four seconds of the 40 minutes. Each time Stanford
had a chance to get the lead in the second half, Gonzaga
stepped up.
Most memorably, senior point guard Matt Santangelo
jumped out of a Kris Weems straitjacket in the corner and
zapped the Cardinal with a shocking three.
But the proverbial nail in the coffin came with just over
two minutes left on the game clock. With nine ticks on the

Stanford had far too much charac
ter and heart to go quietly into the

Seattle night. Weems and Lee hit big
threes in the final pair of minutes.
And the Zags missed free throws —
just not enough.
As the buzzer sounded and Key
Arena erupted, several things were
clear.
First of all. Gonzaga was for real.
The term Cinderella did not apply to
the Bulldogs. Its quick, mobile big
men gave the Cardinal fits, and its

guard play was nothing short of spec
tacular.
Of course, it certainly didn't hurt
that the Zags were playing across the
state from their Spokane campus in
front of a hometown crowd.
"I was hoping Minnesota would
beat them, 1 really was," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said in ref
erence to the Bulldogs' first-round
game. "They have skilled basketball
players. [I knew that] they are capa
ble of beating a lot of people."
But what was hardest to swallow
was the realization that the careers of
the five members of Stanford's senior
class were over.
Peter Sauer formed a huddle at
half court with Lee and Weems. He
didn't want to let go just yet. There
was time for one last memory — al
beit a painful one.
"I really can't believe this is all
over now." Sauer said in the locker
room after the game. "What makes
this all so fun is the relationships with
those guys.
"The good times on the road trips,
the chemistry we had off the court
and all the times we hung out... that
is what I will always remember. It
seems impossible that 1 just took that
jersey off for the last time."
The five seniors — Lee, Weems,
Sauer. Tim Young and Mark Seaton
— look Stanford to the Sweet Six
teen and the Final Four and captured
a first-ever Pacific 10 Conference
championship.
Those memories will last a life
time for Stanford fans, coaches and
players alike. It was a cruel twist of
fate that the fivesome had to go out
on a sour note, after such magical and
inspiring careers. But the good times
outshine the bad by so far that the
Gonzaga loss will fade into the world
of the forgotten before too long.
" These kids are simply incredi
ble." said assistant coach Blaine Tay
lor "I've never been around a more
caring, intelligent and special group.
Obviously we'd like to keep playing
some more, but that's not what I 11 re
member about this year. Words can't
