# Swimmers lose win streak, title to Auburn

INDIANAPOLIS — The Stan
ford men's swimming team experi

enced something this past weekend
that it has not felt in a long time —
being second best. Since November
of 1997, the beginning of last year's
season, Stanford had been unde

feated in all meets: the team
recorded a perfect dual-meet sea
son, went on to win both the Pacific
10 Conference and NCAA champi
onships, remained unbeaten this

season in dual meets and then ex
tended the longest winning streak
in Pac-1() history for any sport by
winning the conference champi
onship this year.
But at the March 25-27 1999

MEN'S SWIMMING

ished second at NCAA Champi
onships.

ing Championships, the defending
national champion Cardinal's two
year long perfect record was bro
ken by Auburn University with a
final score of 467.5 to Stanford's
414.5.
Stanford knew going into the
meet, held at the Indiana Universi
ty / Purdue University Natatorium
in Indianapolis, that it was going to
be a "dog fight" the whole way
through, but entered the national
championships with the confidence
that it could defend its title in the
end.
Three teams in the last few years
have consistently battled it out for
the national swimming title — the
Auburn Tigers, the Texas Long
horns and Stanford. Last year
though, the Cardinal ran away with
the NCAA title, winning by the see
ond-largest margin of victory ever
(599 to second-place Auburn's
394.5). Yet the team was conscious

of its three near-losses this season
as well as the fierce competition it
experienced at Pac- l()s where Stan
ford trailed for two days before
pulling out a victory. The Cardinal
also recognized the high caliber of
the Auburn and Texas teams.
Much of the reason for the battle
in the first place was due not only to
Auburn's talent, but also the
Tigers' numbers. Auburn qualified
17 individuals for the champi
onship competition: Stanford, only
13. For this reason, Auburn had a
deeper reservoir of bodies, giving it
more opportunities to score and
giving the Tiger swimmers less
relay swims apiece, conserving
their energy. The extra energy and
the numbers helped Auburn pull
out its win. Last year, Stanford
brought 16 swimmers and won the
event.
Auburn began its victory run at
the beginning of the three-day
competition. In the very first event
of the entire weekend, the prelimi
naries of the 200-yard freestyle
relay, the Tigers set new NCAA,
meet, pool and U.S. Open records
with a time of 1 minute, 16.50 sec
onds, breaking the records that
Stanford set at last year's NCAAs
by .26 seconds.
Stanford's relay of sophomore
Anthony Robinson, senior co-cap
tains Dod Wales and Justin Ewers
and junior co-captain Glenn

Counts came in second in the event.
The only other top-two finish that
Stanford had the first night was in
the other relay — the 400 medley
(senior Dan Schultz, Robinson,
Ewers, Wales) — in which the Car
dinal again finished second to the
Tigers.
"It just goes to show that you
have to be ready the first day of the
meet," said Stanford head coach
Skip Kenney. "We swam a two-day
meet [instead of swimming strong
throughout the entire meet] and
just couldn't finish [Auburn] off."
Due to the strength of Auburn
and the lack of top-eight finishers
for Stanford (only two in addition
to the relays), Stanford (114.5
points) not only found itself behind
Auburn (173), but also the Long
horns (132). Yet the Cardinal did
not even consider conceding at this
point; the team's confidence and
morale remained high.
"Spirits have been really high all
week," said senior Tate Blahnik.
"We just stayed positive and fo
cused and concentrated on picking
up points."
Auburn did not make the battle
any easier on the second day of the
meet, but Stanford came out much
stronger than it did the first day.
The Cardinal picked up another
second in a relay (200 medley).
In the 100-yard backstroke the
Cardinal had three seniors in the
final of the event. Schultz placed
second. Ewers third and Blahnik
tied for sixth. Schultz was not seed
ed to perform so well, but he gained
his runner-up status only an hour
away from his hometown. Overall,
the three senior 100 backstrokers
gained nearly 40 points for the Car
dinal.
But the true highlight of the day
came in the 100-yard butterfly. In
the preliminaries of the event,
Wales swam a time of 46.36 to clock
the fastest time in the nation this
year and gain a first seed for that
evening's finals. According to Ken
ney, Wales had been on track all
season to break 46 seconds and
Olympian Pablo Morales' Ameri
can record in the event.

Stanford overcame a sub-par first day of swimming to secure sec
ond place behind Auburn in the NCAA Championships this week
end, the team's 19th straight top-four finish.
He did both while placing first
in the finals. He eclipsed Morales'
record of 46.26 with a time of
45.89. Wales' father, Ross, placed
first in the same event for Prince
ton at the 1967 NCAA Champi
onships.
"I swam like I knew I was capa
ble of," Dod said. "I was fortunate
to put four good laps together."
With Wales' win and the back
strokers' victories, as well as two
other final finishes for Stanford —
sophomore Steven Brown placed
fifth in the 400 individual medley
(3:47.51) and Robinson gained the
same place in the 100 breaststroke
(54.44) — Stanford (297) was both
able to pass Texas (283) for second
place and close the gap on Auburn
(341.5).
The Cardinal still found itself
struggling to win the battle on the
third day. In the mile swim (1,650
yards), the first event of the final
day, Stanford had two swimmers
(sophomore Jeremy Kane and
freshman Reid Gustin) seeded to
place within the top eight and score
points, but instead senior Matt
O'Mara. unseeded in the event for
Stanford, placed the highest of the
Cardinal milers at 19th (15:21.43).
Arizona junior Rvk Neethling's
win in this event with a time
14:35.58 gave him his third person
al win of this meet, a feat he ac
complished last year as well with
individual titles in both the 500 and
the 200 freestvles. This feat of win

ning three events two years in a
row is something only seven others
have done in swimming history.
After the disappointing mile,
Stanford pulled out a another high
light. Senior Tate Blahnik, who
pulled an upset last year over
USC's defending 200 backstroke
champion Lenny Krayzelburg,
won the 2(H) back to hold onto his
crown (1:41.41) after having swam
in the 100 back, the 500 freestyle
and on a number of relays.
The last event of the entire
weekend, the 400 freestyle relay,
ended the three days just as they
had started. r ftf?r*same Auburn
relay team that began the meet
with a record-setting win finished
the NCAAs off with a victory, seal
ing Auburn's new title as the 1999
champions. In the finals. Auburn
clocked a time of 2:50.90, which set
NCAA, meet, pool, and U.S. Open
records, breaking Texas' 1994 time
of 2:51.07.
In the relay, Stanford placed
second, making the Cardinal the
runner-up to the Tigers and keep
ing the Longhorns in their place at
third. Being second was a first for
the Cardinal, yet Kenney still felt
an enormous sense of pride at the
effort and performance of his
team.
"I am very, very proud of our
team," he said. "I have so much re
spect for Auburn. They are not
only a class act, but they swam like
champs. We just ran out of bodies;
we ran out of swims; we ran out of
opportunities [to score]. Our guys
never folded: they never quit try
ing."

to the relays), Stanford (114.5
points) not only found itself behind
Auburn (173), but also the Long
horns (132). Yet the Cardinal did
not even consider conceding at this
point; the team's confidence and
morale remained high.
"Spirits have been really high all
week," said senior Tate Blahnik.
"We just stayed positive and fo
cused and concentrated on picking
up points."
Auburn did not make the battle
any easier on the second day of the
meet, but Stanford came out much
stronger than it did the first day.
The Cardinal picked up another
second in a relay (200 medley).
In the 100-yard backstroke the
Cardinal had three seniors in the
final of the event. Schultz placed
second. Ewers third and Blahnik
tied for sixth. Schultz was not seed
ed to perform so well, but he gained
his runner-up status only an hour
away from his hometown. Overall,
the three senior 100 backstrokers
gained nearly 40 points for the Car
dinal.
But the true highlight of the day
came in the 100-yard butterfly. In
the preliminaries of the event,
Wales swam a time of 46.36 to clock
the fastest time in the nation this
year and gain a first seed for that
evening's finals. According to Ken
ney, Wales had been on track all
season to break 46 seconds and
Olympian Pablo Morales' Ameri
can record in the event.

Stanford overcame a sub-par first day of swimming to secure sec
ond place behind Auburn in the NCAA Championships this week
end, the team's 19th straight top-four finish.
He did both while placing first
in the finals. He eclipsed Morales'
record of 46.26 with a time of
45.89. Wales' father, Ross, placed
first in the same event for Prince
ton at the 1967 NCAA Champi
onships.
"I swam like I knew I was capa
ble of," Dod said. "I was fortunate
to put four good laps together."
With Wales' win and the back
strokers' victories, as well as two
other final finishes for Stanford —
sophomore Steven Brown placed
fifth in the 400 individual medley
(3:47.51) and Robinson gained the
same place in the 100 breaststroke
(54.44) — Stanford (297) was both
able to pass Texas (283) for second
place and close the gap on Auburn
(341.5).
The Cardinal still found itself
struggling to win the battle on the
third day. In the mile swim (1,650
yards), the first event of the final
day, Stanford had two swimmers
(sophomore Jeremy Kane and
freshman Reid Gustin) seeded to
place within the top eight and score
points, but instead senior Matt
O'Mara. unseeded in the event for
Stanford, placed the highest of the
Cardinal milers at 19th (15:21.43).
Arizona junior Rvk Neethling's
win in this event with a time
14:35.58 gave him his third person
al win of this meet, a feat he ac
complished last year as well with
individual titles in both the 500 and
the 200 freestvles. This feat of win

ning three events two years in a
row is something only seven others
have done in swimming history.
After the disappointing mile,
Stanford pulled out a another high
light. Senior Tate Blahnik, who
pulled an upset last year over
USC's defending 200 backstroke
champion Lenny Krayzelburg,
won the 2(H) back to hold onto his
crown (1:41.41) after having swam
in the 100 back, the 500 freestyle
and on a number of relays.
The last event of the entire
weekend, the 400 freestyle relay,
ended the three days just as they
had started. r ftf?r*same Auburn
relay team that began the meet
with a record-setting win finished
the NCAAs off with a victory, seal
ing Auburn's new title as the 1999
champions. In the finals. Auburn
clocked a time of 2:50.90, which set
NCAA, meet, pool, and U.S. Open
records, breaking Texas' 1994 time
of 2:51.07.
In the relay, Stanford placed
second, making the Cardinal the
runner-up to the Tigers and keep
ing the Longhorns in their place at
third. Being second was a first for
the Cardinal, yet Kenney still felt
an enormous sense of pride at the
effort and performance of his
team.
"I am very, very proud of our
team," he said. "I have so much re
spect for Auburn. They are not
only a class act, but they swam like
champs. We just ran out of bodies;
we ran out of swims; we ran out of
opportunities [to score]. Our guys
never folded: they never quit try
ing."
INDIANAPOLIS — The Stan
ford men's swimming team experi

enced something this past weekend
that it has not felt in a long time —
being second best. Since November
of 1997, the beginning of last year's
season, Stanford had been unde

feated in all meets: the team
recorded a perfect dual-meet sea
son, went on to win both the Pacific
10 Conference and NCAA champi
onships, remained unbeaten this

season in dual meets and then ex
tended the longest winning streak
in Pac-1() history for any sport by
winning the conference champi
onship this year.
But at the March 25-27 1999

MEN'S SWIMMING

onships.

ing Championships, the defending
national champion Cardinal's two
year long perfect record was bro
ken by Auburn University with a
final score of 467.5 to Stanford's
414.5.
Stanford knew going into the
meet, held at the Indiana Universi
ty / Purdue University Natatorium
in Indianapolis, that it was going to
be a "dog fight" the whole way
through, but entered the national
championships with the confidence
that it could defend its title in the
end.
Three teams in the last few years
have consistently battled it out for
the national swimming title — the
Auburn Tigers, the Texas Long
horns and Stanford. Last year
though, the Cardinal ran away with
the NCAA title, winning by the see
ond-largest margin of victory ever
(599 to second-place Auburn's
394.5). Yet the team was conscious

of its three near-losses this season
as well as the fierce competition it
experienced at Pac- l()s where Stan
ford trailed for two days before
pulling out a victory. The Cardinal
also recognized the high caliber of
the Auburn and Texas teams.
Much of the reason for the battle
in the first place was due not only to
Auburn's talent, but also the
Tigers' numbers. Auburn qualified
17 individuals for the champi
onship competition: Stanford, only
13. For this reason, Auburn had a
deeper reservoir of bodies, giving it
more opportunities to score and
giving the Tiger swimmers less
relay swims apiece, conserving
their energy. The extra energy and
the numbers helped Auburn pull
out its win. Last year, Stanford
brought 16 swimmers and won the
event.
Auburn began its victory run at
the beginning of the three-day
competition. In the very first event
of the entire weekend, the prelimi
naries of the 200-yard freestyle
relay, the Tigers set new NCAA,
meet, pool and U.S. Open records
with a time of 1 minute, 16.50 sec
onds, breaking the records that
Stanford set at last year's NCAAs
by .26 seconds.
Stanford's relay of sophomore
Anthony Robinson, senior co-cap
tains Dod Wales and Justin Ewers
and junior co-captain Glenn

Counts came in second in the event.
The only other top-two finish that
Stanford had the first night was in
the other relay — the 400 medley
(senior Dan Schultz, Robinson,
Ewers, Wales) — in which the Car
dinal again finished second to the
Tigers.
"It just goes to show that you
have to be ready the first day of the
meet," said Stanford head coach
Skip Kenney. "We swam a two-day
meet [instead of swimming strong
throughout the entire meet] and
just couldn't finish [Auburn] off."
Due to the strength of Auburn
and the lack of top-eight finishers
for Stanford (only two in addition
to the relays), Stanford (114.5
points) not only found itself behind
Auburn (173), but also the Long
horns (132). Yet the Cardinal did
not even consider conceding at this
point; the team's confidence and
morale remained high.
"Spirits have been really high all
week," said senior Tate Blahnik.
"We just stayed positive and fo
cused and concentrated on picking
up points."
Auburn did not make the battle
any easier on the second day of the
meet, but Stanford came out much
stronger than it did the first day.
The Cardinal picked up another
second in a relay (200 medley).
In the 100-yard backstroke the
Cardinal had three seniors in the
final of the event. Schultz placed
second. Ewers third and Blahnik
tied for sixth. Schultz was not seed
ed to perform so well, but he gained
his runner-up status only an hour

the three senior 100 backstrokers
gained nearly 40 points for the Car
dinal.
But the true highlight of the day
came in the 100-yard butterfly. In
the preliminaries of the event,
Wales swam a time of 46.36 to clock
the fastest time in the nation this

evening's finals. According to Ken
