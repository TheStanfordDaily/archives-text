# Wales family makes father-son swimming history
## Cardinal senior Dod follows dad in taking NCAA 100 fly title 
### Rebecca Rettig Editorial staff 
INDIANAPOLIS — If you
looked at the results board 32 years
ago, it would have read the same
thing: 100 butterfly, first place,
Wales.
On the second day of the 1999
NCAA Men's Swimming and Div
ing Championships in Indianapolis.
Stanford senior co-captain Dod
Wales won the 1(H) butterfly in 45.89
seconds, the same event his father,
Ross Wales, won for Princeton in
1967 at the NCAA Championships
held at Michigatl State with a time of
50.26.
This is the first time in the history
of NCAA swimming that father and
son have won the same event at the
national meet. The NCAA not only
recognized this amazing feat, hut
also asked Ross Wales to present the
awards to the top eight finalists in the
1(K) fly, shaking his eldest son's hand
and handing him the national cham
pion medal with tears in his eves.
"My dad's usually not an ex
tremely emotional person." Dod
Wales said. "My mom takes care of
that for all four of us in the family."
"I'm not emotional except when
it comes to my family, especially my
boys," Ross Wales added. " This has
been a long time coming [for Dod]."
Ross Wales and his wife, J.J., as
well as Dod's younger brother,
Craig, and a handful of aunts, uncles
and cousins all attended the compe
tition. Craig, a butterflyer on the
Princeton swim team. Hew in from
New Jersey to see Dod compete.
"It meant a lot to have my family,
my brother here. It really touched
me that they took a couple moments
to explain that [my dad] won this
too," Dod Wales said. "It has been
fun to swim fly because it reminded
me of him. It's fun to please him and
make him proud and I think that
swimming fly is the easiest way to do
that."

Dod's mother also swam compet
itively. but never up to the level that
Ross did. After securing his butterfly
crown. Ross Wales went on to train
and qualified for the 1 968 Olympics
in the same event. The Olympic Tri
als were held at the Belmont PI a/a
Pool in Long Beach where the Pacif
ic 10 Conference championships are
consistently held. The pool is also
the site where Stanford head coach
Skip kennev and Ross Wales met
when Ross was training and Kennev
was first coaching. Ross Wales'
Olympic attempt was successful: he
came home bearing the bronze in
the 100 fly.
But even though Ross has had
much success. Dod's swimming
achievements are almost as exciting
and satisfying. Yet it is not swimming
alone that makes Ross proud of
Dod: it is the kind of person that Dod
is that is the most gratifying.
" The best way that [Dod] makes
me proud is hv being himself. That
makes me about as proud as I can
imagine," Ross said. "The fact that
he is an outstanding swimmer is an
added blessing and the combination
of the two is indescribable."
The admiration between father
and son is mutual and Ross is one of
Dod's two greatest role models and
teachers. The other is Pablo
Morales, an Olympian and former
Stanford swimmer and assistant
coach.
Ross, even after his swimming ca
reer was over, still remained in
volved in the sport. He was president
of USA Swimming and is currently
the vice president of FIN A, the
world governing swimming body.
So. as Dod was growing up. he not
only competed from the age of eight,
but also went to many important
competitions.
In 1984. Dod attended the
Olympic Trials with his father. That
year the Trials were held at the same
pool where this year's NCA As were
held — the Indiana University / Pur

due University Natatorium. This
was one of the first times that the
younger Wales saw Morales swim
and a year when the swimming great
made the U.S. Olympic Team.
Last year. Morales became an as
sistant coach to the Stanford team
and made being highly successful in
the 1 (K) fly more than just a possibili
ty for Wales.
"When Pablo Morales became an
assistant coach, I really learned how
to swim the KM) butterfly, both men
tally and with the physical stroke,"
Dod Wales said. "He was more of a
teacher than my dad was."
Yet Dod's victory is not only his
torical in the fact of the father-son
win, but also in the record books.
With his time of 45.89, Dod broke
Morales' American record 46.26, set
in 1986. And.in addition leaving his
mark twice in history, Wales clocked
the fastest time in the nation, break
ing the fastest time he swam at Pac
10s early in March of 46.66.
"About a year ago, I set the goal
of breaking Pablo's record," Dod
said. "I felt that I put too much pres
sure on myself in the last month. In

the prelims, I was a little too emo
tional, 1 wanted it a little too had. I
was out of rhythm. This evening, I
swam like 1 knew I was capable and
I was fortunate to put four good laps
together."
Though this was something that
Ross always thought was possible
when Dod was "an eight year-old
and had the perfect stroke," it wasn't
necessarily something that Dod al
ways considered. In fact, during his
senior year in high school at St.
Xavier's in Cincinnati, although the
younger Wales had always had a nat
ural talent for the butterfly, it didn't
feel right to him anymore. So. Wales
stopped swimming fly and concen
trated on his sprinting. Only during
his junior year at Stanford did Dod
resume his fly — it just seemed to
feel right again.
This past weekend, it was more
right than it ever has been in so many
ways — for Dod Wales' family, for
NCAA swimming history and for
the nation.
"This was the goal for the year."
Wales said. "I'm glad it's in the
books now."

together."
Though this was something that
Ross always thought was possible
when Dod was "an eight year-old
and had the perfect stroke," it wasn't
necessarily something that Dod al
ways considered. In fact, during his
senior year in high school at St.
Xavier's in Cincinnati, although the
younger Wales had always had a nat
ural talent for the butterfly, it didn't
feel right to him anymore. So. Wales
stopped swimming fly and concen
trated on his sprinting. Only during
his junior year at Stanford did Dod
resume his fly — it just seemed to
feel right again.
This past weekend, it was more
right than it ever has been in so many
ways — for Dod Wales' family, for
NCAA swimming history and for
the nation.
"This was the goal for the year."
Wales said. "I'm glad it's in the
books now."
