# Few surprises in upset
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
NORFOLK, Va. — There are
tournament upsets that come out
of the blue, losses that wreak
havoc on travel plans and tourna
ment pools. Such an upset was No.
1 seed Stanford falling to 16 seed
Harvard in last year's first round,
and such a loss was the men's
team's fall to (ion/aga March 13.
And then there are losses like
the one the women suffered
March 12: an upset maybe, but not
an unforeseen one.
A loss to an experienced Maine
team that starts three seniors and
two juniors. A loss to a team with
one of the strongest inside players
in the country, America East Con
ference Player of the Year Jamie
Cassidy. A loss 3,(XX) miles from
friendly Maples Pavilion, in an

arena filled with Maine fans.
In other words, if the word
"Stanford" was not printed on the
jerseys of the losers, the upset
might not be so surprising at all.
"It was a great accomplishment
for [our] team to even be in the
tournament. It's not a champi
onship team," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "They weren't
an underdog, and they're not
ready to be anything but an under
dog."
The two consecutive tourna
ment losses were "totally different
situations," VanDerveer said.
"This is a legitimate first-round
loss."
Last spring, national scoring
leader Allison Feaster and Ivy
League champion Harvard
stunned Stanford 71-67 after team
leaders Vanessa Nygaard and
Kristin Folkl went down the previ

ous week with knee injuries.
"Last year our team went
through an emotional week and
[the loss] was the end result," said
senior Regan Freuen, who scored
19 points last year against Harvard
and 13 on 4-of-13 shooting this
year against Maine. "This year, we
were all healthy."
Healthy, but young. Stanford's
team is composed primarily of
freshmen and sophomores, includ
ing freshman Lindsey Yamasaki,
who paced the team with 24 points
against Maine. Fellow freshman
Bethany Donaphin was Stanford's
only inside presence, contributing
10 rebounds.
With this youth came the lack
of versatility that doomed the Car
dinal, according to VanDerveer.
"At this level you either have to
be more versatile, or really good at
what you do," she said. "[Against
Maine] it came down to having to
make a choice between people
who could help us offensively or
defensively. Bethany did well de
fensively but not scoring, and
Milena [Flores] was aggressive but
had a lot of turnovers.
"A side of me is really proud of
these kids for being in the tourna
ment, and a side of me is disap
pointed," said VanDerveer.
"When you have a chance to tie it
and go to overtime and you give up
an offensive rebound, that's not
good."
Thanks to its youth, most of
Stanford's team will be present
next year to avenge the Maine
loss, an opportunity last year's five
seniors didn't have after the Har
vard loss. Next year's team will be
more experienced, losing only
Freuen. and VanDerveer expects
greater versatility with age.
"We've depended on a lot of
offseason improvement," she said.
"Players on our team are going to
have to challenge themselves in

ford's March 12 loss to Maine. Eighteen of her points came on 6-

the offseason."
Specifically, VanDerveer is
hoping for more bulk from
Donaphin, a greater vertical leap
from center Carolyn Moos, and
more scoring from center Cori En
ghusen and forward Sarah Dim
son.
But next year's team will have
its infusion of youth as well, in the
form of point guard Jamie Carey, a
third-team Street & Smith's All-
American from Thornton, Colo.
"Carey runs a half-court of
fense and can shoot threes," said
VanDerveer, who likened the in
coming point guard to former
Stanford great Jamila Wideman.
With the addition of Carey,
VanDerveer hopes to again em
phasize a half-court offense, a lack
of which caused the team prob
lems against slower, steadier
Maine.
"I don't think our team is a
good passing team.... Maine did
a good job of passing the ball,"
said VanDerveer. "The offense
they run used to be the offense we
ran."
A potential setback for next
year is already looming in the sta
tus of Yamasaki. She has knee
surgery planned for the offseason,
and could spend up to six months
out of action, according to Van-
Derveer.
If Yamasaki is in shape to play
a sport in the fall, she may opt for
volleyball, at which she was a two
time Oregon player of the year in
high school. If so, she wouldn't
join the basketball team until Jan
uary.
But if all goes according to
VanDerveer's plan, a Stanford
team with more experience, a few
additions and only one subtraction
will be taking the court next
March.
And with two upsets to avenge,
it'll need all the experience it can
get.
