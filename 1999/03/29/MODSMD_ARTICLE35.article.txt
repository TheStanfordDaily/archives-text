The 8-4, 12-4 and 12-11 wins kept
Stanford (20-8 overall) atop the Pae
-10 standings with a perfect 6-0
record.
The Cardinal has been able to
take an early hold on the Pac-10 race
because its offense has finally come
alive.
Spurred by the success of some
previously unheralded batters, Stan
ford is hitting .378 in Pac-10 plav.
In the sweep of the 20th-ranked
Sun Devils, junior catcher Damien
Alvarado, junior shortstop Eric
Bruntlett, junior left-fielder Nick

Day and junior second baseman Jeff
Rizzo took the main stage.
Against the unranked Wildcats,
these four, along with sophomore
center-fielder Billy Jacobson. again
led the way.
Jacobson had been a defensive re
placement for much of the season,
but he was given the chance to start in
the Texas series and has made the
most of it. Against Arizona, Jacob
son went 7 for 14 , including going 3
for 5 out of the leadoff spot in yester
day's victory.
Alvarado is batting .448 in Pac-10
play, Bruntlett and Rizzo are both
hitting .440 and Day is at .370.
Except for giving up 11 runs yes
terday.the Cardinal pitching staff
was again a strength. Friday's starter,
sophomore Jason Young, and Satur
day's starter, sophomore Justin
Wayne, had similarly solid lines.
Both went six innings, striking out six
while allowing only two earned runs.
The successive Pac-10 sweeps
have put the Cardinal in a prime spot.
I leading into a grueling five straight
weekends of Pac-10 play, Stanford
lias put significant distance between
it and its top challengers.
Both Arizona State and Arizona
can still make waves in the confer
ence race, but they already start at
least three games behind the Cardi
nal with, at most. 18 games left.
The three-game series against the
Longhorns in Austin. Texas, and the
one game against Oklahoma were
much less important for the Cardinal
than the series against Arizona, a
Pac-10 opponent.
However, the games did help
show the Cardinal how it stacks up to
top talent from outside the West.
Stanford did lose two of three to
the Longhorns. But both of their loss
es came by one run, 9-8 in the open
ing game March 20 and 4-3 in the
March 22's rubber match.
