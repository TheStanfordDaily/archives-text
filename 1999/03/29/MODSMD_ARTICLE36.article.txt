■ March 18-20: Stanford finished
first at NCAA Championships.

Fight as they might, the Buckeyes
just couldn't outperform the Cardi
nal. The seven-woman team lived up
to its reputation for outstanding tal
ent. ending its season with its first
ever gold-medal finish in the team
event over OSU.
Senior captain Vanessa .Shaw
rounded out the first-place finishes
for Stanford by taking top honors in
both solo and in figures. Shaw, now a
four-time Ail-American, also took
home the prestigious high-point
award, given to the swimmer who
earns the highest number of points at
the championship meet.
In the duet and trio competitions,
the Buckeyes showed that they are
still a strong opponent, taking first
place in both. Shaw and freshman
Lindsev Wigginton took second in

duet, while teammates Paige Freilicit
and Shannon Montague took third.
Wigginton teamed up with Frei
heit and Montague to take home sec
ond-place in the trio. Senior Emi
Kanayama, junior Julie Enos and
sophomore Kristi Wright took third.
This victory is especially sweet for
the seven-woman team which has en
dured an emotionally rough season.
With the departure of
sophomore Laura Yund. the team
was left with only seven people out of
a necessary eight. In the team event,
each person less than the required
eight puts the team at an automatic
half-point deficit. So for the Cardinal
to beat OSU in the team event was
especially challenging.
To top off the NCAA title, all
seven Stanford swimmers also made
the All-American team. However.
Kanayama. who is studying in the
United States on a student visa, is in
eligible because she is not a U.S. citi
zen. Enos was also awarded with an
Academic All-American award for
her outstanding performance both in
the water and in the classroom.
After its first NCAA champi
onship last year which ended the
reign of 13-time national champions
OSU. the team had shirts printed that
said. "Talk about a Revolution." It
seems that with this second NCAA
title and a team of six All-Americans,
the Cardinal is on its way to setting its
own place in synchro history.
