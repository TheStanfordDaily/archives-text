# Madsen leads the way as Cardinal holds off pesky Braves
## Hoops survives Alcorn State

SEA TILE — For the first twenty
minutes of its game against Alcorn
State March 11, the Stanford men's
basketball team looked like a well
oiled postseason machine, geared up
lor a repeat run to the Final Four.
A nauseating 15 minutes later, the
final Four was the furthest thing
from the minds of the Cardinal play
ers: survival was the first priority.
With four minutes, 11 seconds re
maining in the game, Braves forward
Karl Jones hit a spinning fadeaway
baseline jumper over Peter Sauer to
tie the game at 55 and cap a furious
run that stole every ounce of the mo
mentum from the favored Cardinal.
At that point, Stanford (26-6) was
swooning with the very real possibili
ty of a terrible first-round exit from

the NCAA Tournament. The
Braves (23-7) were making all the big
shots and the Cardinal couldn't buy a
defensive stop.
But then Stanford hit the postsea
son panic button — the very same
trigger of turnarounds that bailed it
out of countless urgent situations
during last year's run to San Antonio.
Kris Weems, who had been stone
cold from the field all afternoon,
somehow found the confidence to
slash into the lane, elevate from the
left elbow and bury an eight-foot
leaning jumper.
That was the spark that re-lit Stan
ford's fire, and the Cardinal made 10
of 11 free throws down the stretch to
escape with a 69-57 victory.
"We get to move on," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery, un
derscoring the cut and dry bottom
line in the tournament — all you have

to do is win.
"They were a little tentative com
ing out to start the game, and we were
able to jump on them quickly,"
Montgomery added. "When they
came back on us we got a little tenta
tive. I lowever. if you can get the ball
in | Arthur Lee's] hands at the line at
the end of the game you are in pretty
good shape."
Lee was a perfect 6 of 6 from the
free-throw line in the final 2:3H, icing
the win.
But Lee is expected to be clutch at
the line. Alter all, the senior guard hit
an N( A A record 35 straight from the
line in last year's Big Dance.
It was Mark Madsen who provid
ed the pleasant surprise, nailing all
nine of his freebies — not bad for a
player that made under 6() percent
from the line in the regular season.
Mad Dog, who led Stanford with

23 points and 13 rebounds, also had a
part in the two most spectacular plays
of the evening. The first, a resounding
alley-oop slam off a Kris Weems
entry pass, put Stanford up by 14 with
two and a half minutes to go in the
first half.
The second was equally dazzling
— and far more important. With just
under two minutes remaining in the
game and Stanford up by only five,
Madsen caught the ball on the left
side of the lane. As he elevated to
ward the rim the Mad Dog was ham
mered by Marcus Fleming, but some
how managed to keep his eye on the
basket.
With his body parallel to the hard
wood floor at Key Arena, Madsen
sent his up-and-under layup home off
the glass and stomped to the free
throw line to complete the three
point play.
