# Zags' hero could have been a Cardinal

SI A l l I F. — Matt Santangelo
didn't have to he at (Jonzaga.
While the Bulldogs missed out on
the NCAA tournament last year,
Santangelo could have been charg
ing his way to the Final Four. He
could have played basketball for
Stanford.
Mm then Arthur Fee visited
Palo Alto.

Back when the two were still
high-school seniors, then-Cardinal
assistant coach Jeff Jackson was in
terested in bringing either one to
the Farm to study behind team su
perstar Brevin Knight.
His solution on deciding which
of the two to offer a scholarship
was simple enough: tell them both
that the first one to commit to Mike
Montgomery's program would get
it.
He might not have known it at

the time, but Santangelo, now a
reelshiit junior, had the inside
track. Fee was going to Arizona.
1 le was going to be a Wildcat. But
Santangelo decided not to let this
ultimatum rush his decision.
"I was recruited by Stanford
coming out of high school," he said.
"They offered myself and another
guard a scholarship and said who
ever committed first would get the
scholarship. I hadn't visited any
other school. It was really early in

the process and I wasn't ready to
make a decision."
Lee left Los Angeles to visit the
Farm and never looked hack to the
Tucson desert.
He decided the academic oppor
tunity at Stanford far was too much
to pass up. and his visit cleared up
some misconceptions about the
school.
"This is the first time I've heard
of [Santangelo] since then," Lee
said. "I didn't even care about
Stanford then. I thought I was
going to Arizona. [ The ultimatum]
didn't hurry me up or make me try

to make my decision any faster.
"I knew that Stanford was a re
ally good school academically and
once I got up here I liked the guys.
The guvs weren't nerds. Brevin was
instrumental, and |former ( 'ardinal
forward] Darren Allaway was in
strumental."
And with that decision, Santan

gelo was left out in the cold.
By the time Santangelo decided
he was ready to commit to a school,
he was left to choose between Gon
zaga, Northwestern and Rice.
But things have worked out
more than well enough for the
Portland native.
Joining Gonzaga has allowed
him to build a personal relationship
with the Bulldogs' most famous
alumnus,-point guard John Stock
ton of the NBA's Utah Jazz.
"He works out with us all fall,
playing pick-up with us," Santange
lo said. "But these last two years
we've been doing a lot of individual
work. Three days a week we go
through my shot routine. I'm glad
to say he's my friend and I hope
he'd say the same thing.
"But it's not all shooting. A lot
of what he teaches is what he does
with his shoulder on the penetra
tion. It's the little tricks he has, like
what to do with your center of bal
ance and gravity."
And when Gonzaga defeated
Santa Clara in the championship
game of the West Coast Confer
ence Tournament to earn its first
NCAA berth since 1995, a message
of congratulations from Stockton
awaited for Santangelo on his an
swering machine.
Despite this success, some might
think he'd kick himself for missing
the opportunity to play at a Pac-1()
school that made it to overtime of
the national semifinal last spring.
But he hasn't looked back.
"It never crossed my mind," he
said. "My recruiting process went
the way it was supposed to. 1 have
not had any regrets the last two
years."
The recruiting process wasn't
the only thing to go right for him.
The Bulldogs dominated Min
nesota during the first round of the
tournament before knocking the
Cardinal out in the second.
And after getting past Florida in
the West Regional semifinal, San
tangelo and company came within
one play of doing what most never
even considered possible: making it
to the Final Four.
