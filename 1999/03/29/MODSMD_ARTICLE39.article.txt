In the March 22 issue of Pennsyl
vania's The Daily Pennsylvanian, an
article previewing Penn and Stan
ford's upcoming women's lacrosse
match predicted, " The Cardinal will
be hard pressed to [beat Pennj in
Philadelphia, as lacrosse teams from
the West tend to be much weaker
than teams from the East." With an
8-7 win over Penn that evening, the
Stanford women (6-4) proved the
paper wrong.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ March 19: Johns Hopkins (4-1) 14,
Stanford 8.
■ March 22: Stanford 8, Pennsylva
nia (0-3)8.
■ March 24: Cornell (5-0) 20, Stan
ford 5.
■ Saturday: Stanford 12, Denver (5-
6)8.

"It was the best lacrosse I've seen
our team play yet. It was an amazing
turnaround," head coach Heidi Con
nor said in reference to last year's 19-
8 loss to the Quakers (0-3). Goals for
the Cardinal came from sophomore
Katherine Barnes (three), freshmen
Liz Britt and Sara Lev (two each) and
senior co-captain Carey Jones (one).
Barnes secured the win with six sec
onds remaining with her third goal.

"It felt great," said Barnes. "But it
shouldn't have come down to a last
minute goal. We deserved and
earned the win. It was more about the
game that everybody played, not just
the last goal."
Connor noted the tremendous
team effort as well. "Defensively, our
team played incredibly," Connor
said, highlighting the solid and con
sistent play of freshman Patti Zettler.
Things did not go as smoothly on
March 24, however, for Stanford's
match up with Cornell (5-0). The
Cardinal rounded out their East
Coast tour with a 20-5 loss to Cornell
at Villanova. "We knew they would
be a tough team," Jones said. "We
played with them, but we were tenta
tive. We were afraid to play up to
their level."
Cornell's three quick goals within
the first four minutes made for a frus
trating start to the game. "We were
never able to get the momentum
going," Connor said. "We couldn't
take the pressure. They were very
athletic and fast and played with a
style we haven't come up against
yet."
In the offensive effort for the Car
dinal, freshman Caroline Osterwise
chipped in two goals while Barnes,
Jones and sophomore Kate Reilly
each contributed one.
The women started off their
spring break with a 14-8 loss at home
against John Hopkins (4-1) on
March 19. "Even though this game
was ... a loss, I am so proud of these
girls," said Connor. "They played
tough and truly came out the better
team, in effort and sportsmanship."
Jones chipped in three goals in the
losing effort, while senior co-captain
Alexis Patrizo and junior Gabby
Duno each had two and Lev rounded
out the scoring with one.
"We look at this game as another
building block in laying the founda
tion for a great team in the years to
come," said Connor.
Overall the women were satisfied
with their performance against the
East Coast teams. "Our goal was to
beat Penn," Jones said. "The teams
in the West are not good enough
competition for us; it was great to
have to raise our level."
