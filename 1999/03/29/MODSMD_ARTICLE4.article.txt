## Board cites pressures of online sellers 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
Faced with increased competition
from online booksellers, the non
profit Stanford Bookstore will likely
turn to an outside, for-profit book
selling chain — such as Barnes &
Noble or Follett Corp. — to run its
six stores beginning next fall.
The change would likely result in
an increased availability of used text
books and an online book ordering
system for the Bookstore.
The board of directors of the non
profit store, which operates separate

ly from the University, voted unani
mously on March 18 to review pro
posals from outside for-profit retail
ers. The hoard oversees operations of
the main store in White Plaza, branch
locations on campus and in Palo Alto,
as well as Tresidder Express, the on
campus convenience store.
"It has become clear to the board
that changes in the retail book indus

cult for independently managed
stores to continue to provide high
quality service at optimal prices,"
said History Prof. David Kennedy,
the board's chair, in a written state
ment.
He said he expects the Bookstore
to accept a bid from an outside retail
er, but that it is not "a done deal by

any means." Kennedy also said the
board was "very reluctant" to consid
er the possibility of having a third
party operate the store, and that he
felt a "sense of sadness" at the Book
store. founded in 1897. likely losing
its independent status.
"We have total sales of $42-44
million. As recently as two to three
years ago sales were at $55 million."
explained Kennedy, citing direct
sales of computers and a decrease in
popularity of Apple computer prod
ucts. which the Bookstore stocked
heavily, as other factors contributing
to decreased sales.
But, "that doesn't mean our bot
tom line has changed proportional
ly." said Kennedy, calling the Book
store a "very healthy business."
Still, he said the 14-member
board, which consists of volunteers
