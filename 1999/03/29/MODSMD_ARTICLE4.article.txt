# Bookstore likely to join chain
## Board cites pressures of online sellers 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
Faced with increased competition
from online booksellers, the non
profit Stanford Bookstore will likely
turn to an outside, for-profit book
selling chain — such as Barnes &
Noble or Follett Corp. — to run its
six stores beginning next fall.
The change would likely result in
an increased availability of used text
books and an online book ordering
system for the Bookstore.
The board of directors of the non
profit store, which operates separate

ly from the University, voted unani
mously on March 18 to review pro
posals from outside for-profit retail
ers. The hoard oversees operations of
the main store in White Plaza, branch
locations on campus and in Palo Alto,
as well as Tresidder Express, the on
campus convenience store.
"It has become clear to the board
that changes in the retail book indus

try will make it more and more diffi
cult for independently managed
stores to continue to provide high
quality service at optimal prices,"
said History Prof. David Kennedy,
the board's chair, in a written state
ment.
He said he expects the Bookstore
to accept a bid from an outside retail
er, but that it is not "a done deal by

any means." Kennedy also said the
board was "very reluctant" to consid
er the possibility of having a third
party operate the store, and that he
felt a "sense of sadness" at the Book
store. founded in 1897. likely losing
its independent status.
"We have total sales of $42-44
million. As recently as two to three
years ago sales were at $55 million."
explained Kennedy, citing direct
sales of computers and a decrease in
popularity of Apple computer prod
ucts. which the Bookstore stocked
heavily, as other factors contributing
to decreased sales.
But, "that doesn't mean our bot
tom line has changed proportional
ly." said Kennedy, calling the Book
store a "very healthy business."
Still, he said the 14-member
board, which consists of volunteers

from the Stanford community, acted
to "make sure the Bookstore is the
healthiest and best we can provide."
Stanford's Chief Financial Offi
cer. Mariann Byerwalter, approved
the board's recommendation.
"They convinced us they face in
creased competition from online
sales," said Byerwalter, saying the
decision was made in the "best inter
est of the Stanford Bookstore and
the Stanford community it serves."
She emphasized that the Book
store was not for sale, as it will re

Ken nedy said that typical
arrangements made when an outside
company manages a campus store
involve the company paying 10% of
adjusted sales to the university in
order to lease the store.
Bverwalter said that she, the

board and current management of
the store have entered "preliminary
negotiations" with "a few significant,
reputable firms."
Kennedy called Barnes & Noble
and Follett Corp. the two strongest
contenders to take over the stores
due to their size and experience
managing collegiate bookstores.
Barnes & Noble manages stores at
Harvard. MIT and Yale, among oth
ers while Follett'soperations include
stores at UC-Berkeley and Notre
Dame.
"This kind of consolidation is
happening all over the country,"
Kennedy said.
He said the board is in the process
of sending requests for proposals to
Barnes & Nobles and Follett and ex
pects a response from the companies
within the next few weeks.
"When we finally get down to the
task of negotiations ... we will work
to try to get the best terms for the
University and the community,"
Kennedv said.

He said he expects the chain re
tailers to create and maintain an on
line book ordering system for stu
dents, and that the size of the chain
retailer will allow more used text
books to be sold in the store.
Kennedy said the board expects
that a new operator would retain
most of the 270 people currently em
ployed by the Bookstore.
"The board is committed to as
suring that employees' interests are
well represented in this process,
said Kennedy in his statement.
But he declined to answer
whether or not employees or repre
sentatives of employees would be di
rectly involved in any negotiations,
saying the board has not discussed
the issue.
He said that every effort will be
made to keep the Bookstore's rebate
program intact and commit the oper
ator to the "lowest textbook prices
possible" but said there was "no
guarantee" what would occur in the
negotiations.
