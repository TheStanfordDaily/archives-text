### Mo Eger 
While many Stanford students
took off this past week and spent their
vacations relaxing in the warm sun
and recuperating from a long winter
quarter, the Stanford women's water
polo team braved the Bay Area and
Southern California rains and
brought home three wins for the Car
dinal.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ March 2(1: No. 2 Stanford (13-2.6-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
12, No. 10 San Jose State (11-13,1-5)
1.
■ March 25: Stanford 9, No. 11 Long
Beach State (11-11, 3-4) 5.
■ Friday: Stanford 6, No. 6 San Diego
State (15-10,2-4)2.
In the first match of the week, the

No. 2 Cardinal (14-2, 7-0 MPSF) im
proved its Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation league record by beating
the No. 10 San Jose Spartans (10-14.
1-6) 12-1 at deGuerre Pool. Fresh
man Margie Dingeldein scored three
times for the Cardinal, helping to en
sure the Spartan's defeat.
"We were nervous to play a game
the day after finals week," said junior
Elissa Keszler. "But we just came
right out, took it to them, and never
let down. We did everything we set
out to do."
After a tough week of training, the
team traveled on Thursday to South
ern California to play No. 11 Long
Beach State (10-11,2-4). Van trouble,
delayed flights, horrible traffic and
heavy rains made getting to the Long
Beach pool a day-long affair. "It was
really hectic," said senior Nicole
Glazer. "We basically got to the pool
just in time to do a quick warm up."

The day's mishaps may have
caused some "twilight zone" mo
ments during the game, but the Car
dinal got ahead and maintained its
lead throughout and sealed the win 9-
5.
"They scored a couple lucky shots
and we didn't let that get to us at all,"
said captain Tam. Crary registered six
saves and sophomores Dani Bell,
Anne-Marie Keenan and freshman
Dingeldein each scored twice for the
Cardinal. Other goals came from
sophomores Kelly Shouey, Hillary
Gallogly, and Kris Kobliek.
Friday the Cardinal traveled to
San Diego to face No. 6 San Diego
State (16-10, 3-4). The oddly shaped
San Diego State pool is only 20 yards
across instead of the regulation 25,
and this gave the Aztecs a definite ad
vantage. In fact, No. 3 California fell
to the Aztecs at this pool the week be
fore.
