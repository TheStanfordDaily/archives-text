# Hua will face trial in China soon
## Researcher's family unaware of specifics 
### Jeanette Perez 
Hua Di. a researcher at the Stanford Center
for International Security and Cooperation, will
soon be put on trial after being arrested and de
tained in China for more than a year, according
to Stanford officials.
John Lewis, a colleague of Hua at the center,
has learned from Hua's family that the trial
could start as soon as the end of this month.
However, the family still does not know the
exact charges against him.
Hua, 63, works on northeast Asian peace and
cooperation issues, but Lewis and others believe
that the charges are unrelated to either his work
at Stanford or his published writings. The
charges may have to do with unknown actions

taken by Hua in a third country, according to
Lewis.
Lewis, Stanford Provost Condoleeza Rice,
and U.S. Secretary of Stale Madeleine Albright
have all made efforts on Hua's behalf to have
him released. Lewis has made repeated trips to
China to help 1 lua and Albright made an appeal
for his release and also asked the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing to take up the case.
"It is difficult for us to comment further or
pursue action because we do not know the na
ture of the charges related to a third country,"
Lewis said in a written statement. "Hua's family
has thanked us for working to release Hua but
said there is nothing more we can do to help."
Hua's quick release is also crucial because
shortly before his arrest he was being treated for
a rare kind of male breast cancer. When Hua
originally left for China to attend a family
memorial service, he was to return to the United
States to receive chemotherapy. However, ho
was arrested on the trip.

Hua was originally arrested in January 1998.
The reason the trial has been delayed lor so long
may be because of a jurisdictional dispute be
tween two district courts in China, according to
Lewis. All the information Lewis and the family
have about the case comes from a Chinese
court-appointed lawyer who met with Hua in
prison.
"Our plea is that the trial, which we are told
will occur soon, be open, fair and just," Lewis
said. He believes it is possible the trial will be
public with charges specified. Hua is currently
being held at Beijing's Dahongmen Prison.
Hua originally came to Stanford in 1989 after
a warrant was put out for his arrest for denounc
ing the political crackdown preceding the
Tiananmen Square killings.
He has researched military strategies and
missiles in China and in the United States. Hua
and Lewis have been doing research at the cen
ter on proliferation of nuclear weapons and bal
listic missiles.
