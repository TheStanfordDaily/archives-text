Santa Clara County Superior
Court has ruled in favor of the Uni
versity's decision to suspend Psychia
try Prof. Adolf Pfefferbaum for three
years, but has prevented Stanford
from levying a $2(),(XK) fine against
him.
Stanford sought to suspend and
fine Pfefferbaum after he stepped
down from his research position at
the Veteran's Affairs Palo Alto
Health Care System in IW6.
Pfefferbaum chose to retire from
the VA hospital because of working
conditions that existed there. He

claimed that his rights of free acade
mic expression and dissent — rights
guaranteed under the University's
Statement on Policy on Academic
Freedom and Grievance Procedures
— were being violated.
Pfefferbaum intended to continue
his work as a faculty member of the
School of Medicine, but by retiring
from the VA hospital Stanford
claimed that he had retired from his
tenured faculty position as well.
Stanford said this was an abdica
tion of his academic duties, and Pres
ident Casper initially sought Pfeffer
baum's dismissal. He changed his
mind upon the University Advisory
Hoard's recommendation to fine and
suspend Pfefferbaurn instead.
Their decision was made after a
year-and-a-half of investigation in
which they found insufficient evi
dence to support Pfefferbaum's
charges that the VA administration
had interfered with his academic du
ties.
President Casper approved of the
i tiling and told the San Jose Mercury
News, "The court's decision vindi
cates fully my position, which is that
even a tenured member of the faculty
can't walk awav from the task he has
undertaken to perform."
The suspension of Pfefferbaum's
tenured contract is the most serious
action taken against a tenured faculty
member since English Prof. H. Bruce
franklin, an avowed Maoist, was
tired in 1972 for encouraging anti-

Vietnam War violence on campus.
Pfefferbaurn, who is now em
ployed at SRI International in Menlo
Park, disagreed with the judge's rul
ing, and said that he will consider an
appeal.
Pfefferbaurn is a nationally recog
nized schizophrenia researcher and
was one of the most highly funded
professors at the Medical School
prior to his retirement.
He had been the principal re
searcher in a $1 million federally
funded schizophrenia study but lost
the appointment after his retirement
from the VA hospital. A judge later
ordered his reinstatement in the posi
tion even while he is suspended.
Before retiring from the VA hos
pital, Pfefferbaurn earned $148,5(X).
Stanford will pay him $22,795 during
his suspension and will restore his
salary when he is reinstated to the
University.
Pfefferbaum's suspension began
last September and will continue
until 2(X)1.
