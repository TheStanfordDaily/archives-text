New Course:
CL 360 Philosophy of Language and Hermeneutics: Davidson and Gadamer
(W, 2:15 pm - 5:05 pm, 250-252 a)
Discussion of the interesting convergence between analytic and non-analytic philosophy. Donald
Davidson has become famous among analytic philosophers for such off-beat views as "most of
our beliefs must be true", and "there is no such thing as an untranslatable language, nor an
incommensurable conceptual scheme". His handling of the concepts of meaning and truth is
often compared to that of Hans-Georg Gadamer, who takes his inspiration from the historicism
of Hegel and Heidegger and whose hermeneutics centers around the idea of "fusion of horizons".
The seminar will spend time on primary texts and then turn to his secondary literature.
