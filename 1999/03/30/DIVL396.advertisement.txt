PRIVACY
Amitai Etzioni will speak about his new book The Limits of Privacy at
The Goldman School of Public Policy, Living Room
University of California- Berkeley
2607 Hearst Avenue
Friday, April 2 at 1:00 PM
This presentation is FREE and open to the public.
The Limits of Privacy speaks to all who care about the moral, legal and policy
issues raised by the tension between privacy and the common good, especially
with regard to public health and safety The books explores five specific,
current, hot issues:
MEDICAL PRIVACY: Now the enemy of privacy is not Big
Brother but Big Bucks, those corporations that make a profit selling
information about your records. What is to be done?
MEGAN'S LAWS: Far from being unfair to sex offenders, they do
not protect children enough. Etzioni outlines a whole new approach
to pedophiles.
HIV TESTING OF INFANTS: Every day infants die unnecessarily
because most states have not yet adopted the needed testing.
BIOMETRICS: Your face and hand are about to become your 100%
reliable, unforgible ID card. Anonymity will be gone, but the gains to
the public will be immense.
HYPER-PKIVACY; New encryption programs allow communica
tions to be completely private, of great value to pedophiles, terror
ists, and drug lords. What is to be done?
The book closes with a call for a new legal conception of privacy, based on the
Fourth Amendment.
Amitai Etzioni has served as the president of the American Sociological
Association; White House senior adviser; and professor at Berkeley, Columbia,
Harvard, and George Washington University. His book The Spirit of
Community was widely acclaimed.
Available at your local bookstore, and from 1-800-245-7460.
"A must-read for everyone who values privacy, community and
rationality." — Alan M. Dershowitz
