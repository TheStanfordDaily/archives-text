# Res Ed, students try to address eating disorders
## 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
During a recent lecture for a bioethics class, eating
disorder expert and Psychiatry Prof. Regina Casper
asked students, "How many of you know someone
who has had an eating disorder?" In a lecture hall of
300. almost every hand went up. illustrating the aware
ness of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa on cam
pus.
Though there seems to be a consensus over the ur
gency of addressing bulimia on campus, the Office of
Residential Education recently encountered mixed
student reactions surrounding its attempts to address
this issue in two residences, one on the Row and one in
Suites.
Using a public letter
The most controversial method Res Ed has em
ployed to address eating disorders is publicly posting a
letter. Staff members have used a letter when trying to
help someone whose identity they do not know; this in
cident typically occurs when maintenance staff reports
finding vomit in residence restrooms.
Residence Dean Patricia Brandt recently respond
ed to a such an incident in a small Row house by plac
ing a handwritten note in the bathroom where the
vomit was found, explaining the evidence that prompt
ed her concern and offering private help to the suffer
er. When maintenance staff reported evidence of bu
limia in Suites, a residence assistant sent residents a
mass e-mail that was similar in content to the letter
posted by Brandt.
Some members of the Stanford community ques
tion this letter and e-mail strategy.
"Policies that draw attention to a person struggling
with eating issues only tend to make the person
worse â€” more secretive, less likely to ask for help and
possibly less likely to accept help,'" said sophomore
Antonia Welch of the Body Image, Food and Self Es
teem group.
Robin Apple, staff psychologist in the Department
of Psychiatry, offered more specific advice about these
types of situations.
"Bulimia is such a shame-induced, private behavior
that finding the note would trigger intense feelings,"
Apple explained. " The person may feel embarrassed,
ashamed and conspicuous even though the note
doesn't identify him or her."
As an alternative solution Apple suggested calling
a house meeting to establish an empathic group envi
ronment and, without naming names, explain and dis
cuss the situation. She explained that if residents
deemed throwing up in the bathroom unacceptable
behavior, the bulimic student would lose an outlet for
his or her harmful feelings and become more motivat
ed to seek help.
