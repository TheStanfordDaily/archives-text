# Res Ed, students try to address eating disorders
## 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
During a recent lecture for a bioethics class, eating
disorder expert and Psychiatry Prof. Regina Casper
asked students, "How many of you know someone
who has had an eating disorder?" In a lecture hall of
300. almost every hand went up. illustrating the aware
ness of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa on cam
pus.
Though there seems to be a consensus over the ur
gency of addressing bulimia on campus, the Office of
Residential Education recently encountered mixed
student reactions surrounding its attempts to address
this issue in two residences, one on the Row and one in
Suites.
Using a public letter
The most controversial method Res Ed has em
ployed to address eating disorders is publicly posting a
letter. Staff members have used a letter when trying to
help someone whose identity they do not know; this in
cident typically occurs when maintenance staff reports
finding vomit in residence restrooms.
Residence Dean Patricia Brandt recently respond
ed to a such an incident in a small Row house by plac
ing a handwritten note in the bathroom where the
vomit was found, explaining the evidence that prompt
ed her concern and offering private help to the suffer
er. When maintenance staff reported evidence of bu
limia in Suites, a residence assistant sent residents a
mass e-mail that was similar in content to the letter
posted by Brandt.
Some members of the Stanford community ques
tion this letter and e-mail strategy.
"Policies that draw attention to a person struggling
with eating issues only tend to make the person
worse — more secretive, less likely to ask for help and
possibly less likely to accept help,'" said sophomore
Antonia Welch of the Body Image, Food and Self Es
teem group.
Robin Apple, staff psychologist in the Department
of Psychiatry, offered more specific advice about these
types of situations.
"Bulimia is such a shame-induced, private behavior
that finding the note would trigger intense feelings,"
Apple explained. " The person may feel embarrassed,
ashamed and conspicuous even though the note
doesn't identify him or her."
As an alternative solution Apple suggested calling
a house meeting to establish an empathic group envi
ronment and, without naming names, explain and dis
cuss the situation. She explained that if residents
deemed throwing up in the bathroom unacceptable
behavior, the bulimic student would lose an outlet for
his or her harmful feelings and become more motivat
ed to seek help.
Dealing with limited options
A combination of factors can
make posting a letter, though not
ideal, the only option, according to
Brandt.
In the case of the small Row
house, she said its si/e precluded
the creation of more personal fo
rums. such as hall meetings, to dis
cuss the issue.
And because in both Suites and
ilie Row house the resident assis
tants diil not know who needed help,
a private intervention — Res Ed's
preferred method of addressing bu
limia was not possible either.
In the past Res Ed responded to
reported eating disorders by invit
ing a person, usually a Counseling
and Psychological Services repre
sentative. to talk about eating dis

orders to house residents. Brandt
said, however, that residence deans
try not to use this method now; Res
Ed staff found that the person suf
fering from the eating disorder usu
ally avoids the talk.
No one claims that the letter ap
proach is perfect. "It's very easy for
people in a house to organize and
identify around the person who has
an eating disorder; I don't think
that that's helpful to the person or
the community," Brandt said. "It's
my opinion that that should be left
to the person and the profession
als."
But by using a public letter. Res
Ed staff, according to Brandt,
hopes to encourage the person suf
fering from an eating disorder to
seek out private, professional help.
Intervention should be a private af
fair best handled by the person and
professionals, she said.
"| I he letter] might not be the
perfect strategy," Brandt said, "but

if you're very concerned about
someone, you might take a risk to
reach out to them if the alternative
is doing nothing."
Donnovan Somera, a communi
ty health specialist at Cowell, con
curred.
"1 agree that maybe posting up
the letter wasn't the best thing, but
sometimes it takes drastic mea
sures to find the person who needs
help," Somera explained. "You
have to break the silence."
An anonymous house resident
also agreed that, given the situa
tion, the letter was the only avail
able option, even though it did spur
discussion in the house.
"I had been totally unaware of
the situation," the resident ex
plained. "I talked to my drawmates
about it, because I was concerned."
Other campus resources
Though usinga letter has attracted
much attention, it is just one of many

approaches employed by Res Ed to
address eating disorders.
Eating disorders are currently
dealt with on a subjective, case-by
case basis.
If the bulimic student or a con
cerned friend asks for help, R As typ
ically refer the bulimic student to
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices. CAPS then either provides 10
free weekly sessions or, if the student
needs more help, refers him or her to
other health professionals.
Interventions are also discussed at
weekly meetings for the residence
deans, where a CAPS liaison is pre
sent to provide additional insight into
the problem.
"We |the residence deans] have a
lot of experience among us," Brandt
said.
RAs learn about general health
resources and options available to
students during a three-hour presen
tation given by Cowell Student
Health Services before freshman Ori

entation. During the sessions Cowell
staff members discuss wellness issues
and campus health resources with
RAs. Any additional instruction in
dealing with eating disorders is only
given at the request of a group.
Though Stanford employs a vari
ety of methods to address eating dis
orders, some critics say current Uni
versity resources allocated toward
the problem are not enough and
those that do exist are not effectively
utilized.
"I would like to see a commitment
on the part of Res Ed to provide more
and continued discussion [about eat
ing disorders] with residence staff,"
said Angela Amarillas, student pro
ject and health library coordinator at
Cowell. "This is an issue we all deal
with."
Inspired by a lunch with Casper,
Somera is currently working with
sophomore Jill DiGiovanni, health
intern at the Women's Center, to as
sess the need for eating disorder re

sources and create a "common clear
inghouse" for them on campus.
Eating disorders are wide
spread
Somera sees eating disorders as
the number one problem on campus,
along with alcohol.
According to Casper, while about
0.4 percent of female adolescents and
college students suffer from anorexia,
3 to 4 percent suffer from bulimia.
Additionally 30 to 40 percent suffer
from some kind of disordered eating.
Brandt said she typically has three
to four cases of eating disorders on
the Row reported to her every year,
but this number surely does not re
flect the total number of Row resi
dents suffering from eating disorders.
"People who don't look like
they're having a problem are thinking
about what to eat and what not to
eat," Somera said. "People don't get
diagnosed until they are too far
gone."

a private intervention — Res Ed's
preferred method of addressing bu
limia was not possible either.
In the past Res Ed responded to
reported eating disorders by invit
ing a person, usually a Counseling
and Psychological Services repre
sentative. to talk about eating dis

orders to house residents. Brandt
said, however, that residence deans
try not to use this method now; Res
Ed staff found that the person suf
fering from the eating disorder usu
ally avoids the talk.
No one claims that the letter ap
proach is perfect. "It's very easy for
people in a house to organize and
identify around the person who has
an eating disorder; I don't think
that that's helpful to the person or
the community," Brandt said. "It's
my opinion that that should be left
to the person and the profession
als."
But by using a public letter. Res
Ed staff, according to Brandt,
hopes to encourage the person suf
fering from an eating disorder to
seek out private, professional help.
Intervention should be a private af
fair best handled by the person and
professionals, she said.
"| I he letter] might not be the
perfect strategy," Brandt said, "but

if you're very concerned about
someone, you might take a risk to
reach out to them if the alternative
is doing nothing."
Donnovan Somera, a communi
ty health specialist at Cowell, con
curred.
"1 agree that maybe posting up
the letter wasn't the best thing, but
sometimes it takes drastic mea
sures to find the person who needs
help," Somera explained. "You
have to break the silence."
An anonymous house resident
also agreed that, given the situa
tion, the letter was the only avail
able option, even though it did spur
discussion in the house.
"I had been totally unaware of
the situation," the resident ex
plained. "I talked to my drawmates
about it, because I was concerned."
Other campus resources
Though usinga letter has attracted
much attention, it is just one of many

approaches employed by Res Ed to
address eating disorders.
Eating disorders are currently
dealt with on a subjective, case-by
case basis.
If the bulimic student or a con
cerned friend asks for help, R As typ
ically refer the bulimic student to
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices. CAPS then either provides 10
free weekly sessions or, if the student
needs more help, refers him or her to
other health professionals.
Interventions are also discussed at
weekly meetings for the residence
deans, where a CAPS liaison is pre
sent to provide additional insight into
the problem.
"We |the residence deans] have a
lot of experience among us," Brandt
said.
RAs learn about general health
resources and options available to
students during a three-hour presen
tation given by Cowell Student
Health Services before freshman Ori

entation. During the sessions Cowell
staff members discuss wellness issues
and campus health resources with
RAs. Any additional instruction in
dealing with eating disorders is only
given at the request of a group.
Though Stanford employs a vari
ety of methods to address eating dis
orders, some critics say current Uni
versity resources allocated toward
the problem are not enough and
those that do exist are not effectively
utilized.
"I would like to see a commitment
on the part of Res Ed to provide more
and continued discussion [about eat
ing disorders] with residence staff,"
said Angela Amarillas, student pro
ject and health library coordinator at
Cowell. "This is an issue we all deal
with."
Inspired by a lunch with Casper,
Somera is currently working with
sophomore Jill DiGiovanni, health
intern at the Women's Center, to as
sess the need for eating disorder re

sources and create a "common clear
inghouse" for them on campus.
Eating disorders are wide
spread
Somera sees eating disorders as
the number one problem on campus,
along with alcohol.
According to Casper, while about
0.4 percent of female adolescents and
college students suffer from anorexia,
3 to 4 percent suffer from bulimia.
Additionally 30 to 40 percent suffer
from some kind of disordered eating.
Brandt said she typically has three
to four cases of eating disorders on
the Row reported to her every year,
but this number surely does not re
flect the total number of Row resi
dents suffering from eating disorders.
"People who don't look like
they're having a problem are thinking
about what to eat and what not to
eat," Somera said. "People don't get
diagnosed until they are too far
gone."
