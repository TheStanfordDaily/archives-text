BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
— Ground-attack jets took off for
Kosovo yesterday as part of
NATO's expanded attacks on the
Serb forces carrying out a
"scorched earth policy" in the sepa
ratist province.
While tens of thousands of eth
nic Albanian refugees flooded
neighboring countries, specialized
A-10 "Warthog" planes were spot
ted taking off from Aviano Air
Base in northern Italy. The A-10 is
a low- and slow-flying tank-killer
aircraft that could be used to strike
Serb ground forces.
Air raid sirens blared yesterday

evening in Belgrade, the Yugoslav
capital, and two detonations shook
Pancevo, six miles to the north,
marking the beginning of a sixth
night of bombing.
As new atrocities were reported
in Kosovo, Russia's prime minister
announced he was going to the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade on a
peace deal, and rallies for and
against the airstrikes took place in
London, New York, Prague and
other cities.
NATO spokesman Air Com
modore David Wilby said the latest
air attacks targeted Serb and
Yugoslav units involved in atroci

ties in Kosovo, a province in Serbia,
the main republic in Yugoslavia.
"There are indications genocide
is unfolding in Kosovo," said James
P. Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, citing reports of sum
mary executions and people being
forced from their homes at gun
point.
Wilby said NATO had received
reports that Fehmi Agani, an ethnic
Albanian negotiator at recent
peace talks in France, was "execut
ed" on Sunday.
Four other prominent ethnic
Albanians were also reported exe
cuted, NATO said.
