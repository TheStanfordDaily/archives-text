## Editorial Evaluation criteria 
### 
The Daily will use these
guidelines when making
special-fee endorsments

THE ASSU'S SPRING General
Election is fast approaching
and students will soon be vot
ing on whether to fund each of the 39
student groups seeking special fees.
I his year, The Daily will rate each
group on a five-point scale. I"his will
be one composite rating that incorpo
rates an assessment of the group's
effectiveness and its value.
Among the factors that will be con
sidered in assessing effectiveness are
whether the group met last year's stat
ed goals, whether it budgeted appro
priately to achieve those goals and
whether it has a clear sense of the
constituency it serves. We will also
consider whether its programs or pub
lications are consistent with its under
standing ol its constituency, whether
this year's budget and programming
reflect lessons learned during the past
year and whether plans for the
upcoming year appear realistic.
By the term "value," we refer to
the benefit the fee group offers to the
paying constituency, its fiscal efficien
cy and the extent to which it serves a
campus need that would otherwise go
unmet.
Our endorsement process aims to
serve as a quality control mechanism.
Students place their faith and their
dollars in the hands of groups each
year, but most do not have the time to
follow up each year on whether the
group fulfills the goals outlined each
year in the Elections Handbook. The

Daily endeavors to aid the Stanford
community in evaluating whether or
not the groups have fulfilled their
stated missions.
The Daily Editorial Board plans to
meet with representatives from each
group before the election. TTie group
representatives will prepare a seven
minute presentation, followed by an
eight minute question-and-answer
session. At least four of the board's
members will meet with each group;
the entire board will discuss each spe
cial-fee application and make a rec
ommendation.
The Board will make recommen
dations on all groups whether or not
individual groups choose to meet with
us.
Sometimes these endorsements are
controversial, but making them is still
an important part of The Daily's mis
sion.
The special fee endorsement pro
cess is not a popularity contest, nor is
it a judgment about any group's
intrinsic worth. It is merely a judg
ment as to whether the group should
be funded through the special-fee
process.
Ideally, the recommendations will
help students think more clearly and
critically about student groups before
they vote.
However, these endorsements are
not meant to take the place of stu
dents thinking for themselves. We
encourage all voters to read the Elec
tions Handbook when it is distributed
on April 7.
ITie Daily welcomes responses to
its endorsements and will publish
them on a space-available basis dur
ing election week.
