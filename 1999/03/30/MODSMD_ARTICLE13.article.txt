Manley and Rebholz were off
1 thought my eyes deceived irie today
when I read tlie online Daily. I saw that
Political Science Prof. John Manley and
English Prof. Emeritus Ronald Rebholz
have gone high tech with the same tired
argument I read in the print version on
campus over 10 years ago. Not content to
outgrow the Reagan administration, they
consistently employ Seinfeld logic to make
their point -the Hoover Institution is
again involving the University in national
politics -yada, yada, yada — beware the
Borg (er. Hoover Institution).
I heirs is a thinly disguised logic that, on
the face ol it. elevates academia and illus
trious Stanlord University above partisan
politics. On closer examination, and with
the benelit ot a little history, we continue
to see they just don't like conservative par
tisanship (I est we forget, ii takes two sides
to be partisan). I doubt either professor, in
his heart ol hearts, would be as animated in
refusal ol a presidential library for Presi
dent Clinton as they were the Reagan
Presidential Library. What a shame to turn
on such a significant academic resource
simply because ol a dillerence of views.
Nevertheless, Manley and Rebholz con
tinue to amuse me. I relished the diversity
of thought I encountered as an undergrad
uate. and I encourage Professors Manley

and Rebholz to engage the Hoover Institu
tion on fact and logic, not its right to hold
divergent opinions from the two of you.
This is disingenuous. Better yet, go out and
find your own presidential candidate!

All views should be examined
I read the letter from English Prof.
Emeritus Ronald Rebholz and Political
Science Prof. John Manley printed in yes
terday's Daily. Should Stanford's financial
and organizational support be limited only
to researchers with particular viewpoints?
Should we only accept historical docu
ments and speakers on campus if they
meet a "bias" litmus test? Who could pos
sibly decide what is biased without a bias of
their own?
Research, like war, is not complete or
honest without a true analysis of all view
points. Studying the work of your oppo
nent can only bolster your defense. If it
does not. perhaps you should change your
mind. Does any honest researcher or schol
ar believe that Stanford's Political Science
Department is better off not having the
Reagan Library's wealth of documents on
campus? Stanford's ultimate protection
against views we disagree with is the truth

itself, not intolerance for those who have
yet to find the truth for themselves.

Professors urge change
As environmental scientists, we find
ourselves increasingly troubled by the
claims and activities of corporations who
are members of the Global Climate Coali
tion. This deceptively-named organization
has spent millions of dollars in lobbying
and advertising against the ratification of
the Kyoto Protocol, and it has deliberately
misinformed the public about the over
whelming scientific consensus regarding
global warming. That consensus includes
over 2,(MX) scientists who have participated
in the work of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, and another
2.4(H) who have supported its conclusions.
We are not only scientists; we are mem
bers of a university faculty, in an institution
that has made a strong record in taking
investment responsibility seriously. We
think it is time for Stanford and its trustees
to begin the kind of dialog with firms in
which it invests that it has undertaken in
the past. Texaco, Exxon, General Motors
and Mobil are among the member firms of
the GCC in which Stanford is believed to

hold stock.
In the 1980s Stanford declined to take
the path of "blanket" divestiture from cor
porations doing business in South Africa.
Instead, University officers and trustees
engaged in some thoughtful discussions
with corporations, in an effort to change
behavior. Sometimes it worked. Some
times it failed, in which case the University
withheld its votes or voted proxies against
management. In a few instances it eventu
ally divested.
That same strategy, we think, would be
productive here. A number of corpora
tions, including British Petroleum, Shell,
Toyota and BMW, have decided to take
quite a different path and to achieve com
petitive advantage through efficiency
improvements designed to reduce emis
sions.
We think that Stanford could take the
lead in turning other companies in the
same direction — and we urge the trustees
to begin now.
