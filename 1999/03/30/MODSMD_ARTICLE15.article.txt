# Sprinkle cool patience
## Atiba Pertilla A
						mix of feelings about Res Ed 
### 
I DIDN'T actually
attend the meeting last
spring where the
incoming crop of resident
assistants were encouraged
to repeat, mantra-like, "I
am Res Ed," but it's
become clear to me ewer

the course of this year that for many people,
the linkage between a master key and sub
servience to the powers that be of Old Union
306 has already been firmly established.
Many friends have a virulent reaction to
the mention of Residential Education; one
ex-roommate goes into flashbacks whenever
"EANABs" are mentioned and starts bab
bling about his freshman RA, a descendant
of Carry Nation, thrusting sodas upon him
whenever he tried to get drunk. When I told
a friend from back home I was going to be an
RA, she asked me how I was going to cope
with more than 10 people hanging out in
someone's room. I expressed confusion and
she enlightened me about the process of
required party registration at her small col
lege in the Northeast. Things could be much
worse here after all.
As they are, however, I find myself wor
rying that too many students see Res Ed as a
monolith bent on aggrandizing its power to
decide the fate of hapless Draw groups. Most
of us, in fact, don't need someone looking
over our shoulders at every moment, ready
to correct us before we err. II nothing else,
living independently should teach us that we
can do stupid things and live with the conse
quences.
At the same time, I wonder whether some
within Res Ed fail to recognize the validity of
students' concerns when it comes time to
make momentous decisions. If the Universi

ty is going to put students in charge of their
money, their meals and their living space, it
also ought to be willing to respond to their
reasoned arguments about the meaning of
the communities they create.
I remember my inbox filling with e-mails
last winter quarter from people protesting
the housing decisions that had just been
made. The most apparent emotion was
despair, grounded in the fear that in attempt
ing to balance the goals of several groups the
administration had effectively compared the
quantities of students involved rather than
the substance of the arguments being made.
By this logic, if bO students could be accom
modated and stopped threatening to sue the
University, it was all for the best, even if it
meant dissolving another community of the
same number of students.
For all the official rhetoric invoking the
need for students to learn to "weave togeth
er" their academic and social priorities, such
moments serve to undermine student will
ingness to trust the administration if deci
sions can be made without addressing, in
specific terms, how these decisions will fur
ther the University's goals. The despair of
those e-mails reflects the possibly idealist
hope that enough protesting could actually
make a difference; the failure to address such
issues encourages students to opt out of their
community.
One online survey I was asked to fill out
last year asked a number of questions on my
feelings about Stanford in general and the
dormitories in particular. I mentally applaud
ed whoever it was that had thought to send it
out until I got to the final page, which asked
if I knew what the Stanford Fund was,
whether I had contributed to it in the past
and whether I would do so in the future.

I found myself thinking that maybe the
surveys were meant to determine a poll-test
ed system of Stanford residential life guaran
teed to maximize student satisfaction and
increase the moribund alumni giving rate —
the Dick Morris-ing of University policy, if
you will. I found myself feeling not so much
a participant in Stanford's future but rather a
guinea pig being tested to determine which
diet of seminars, grants and tutors would
prove most stimulating.
I had been operating under the assump
tion that the most important lesson of dorm
life was how to survive once you've left it
behind. For many of us, our years in college
will be the only time in our lives when we are
part of a community of equals, when what
matters most are not the goals imposed by an
outside authority but rather those that come
about through people acting in locus ami
cuss. An RA's remonstrance sometimes isn't
about you —it may be about that person
down the hall too busy studying for a
midterm to yell at you for blasting video
games. It's about learning to live with each
other while we still know our neighbors by
name.
My moment of clarity as I stared at the
Netscape Web page was disappointing, but it
leads me to the depressing conclusion that
perhaps, after all, the only irrevocable state
ment the University understands is the dollar
and that the power of the purse will have to
be my way of expressing my present feelings
towards Stanford, since they don't seem all
that important at the moment.

Atiba Pertilla, a senior majoring in history,
would like to thank the Academy, the Spice
Girls and Guys and the people of Rio de
Janeiro for their support.
