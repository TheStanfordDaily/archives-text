## Women falter, end fourth in Pac-10 championships 
### Ramona Shelburne Staff writer 
Amy Murakami just isn't ready
to end her collegiate gymnastics ca
reer.
A senior and one of the most
decorated gymnasts in Stanford his
tory, Murakami has rewritten the
Cardinal record books over the past
three weeks while pacing the No. 9
Stanford women's gymnastics team
(10-3,5-2 Pacific 10 Conference) to
record-breaking victories over
Massachusetts on March 12th
(197.275-193.150) and California
(197.200-192.200) last Friday night.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ March 2(1: No. 9 Stanford tied for
4th with 195.00 at the Pacific lOCon
ference Championships.
■ Friday: N0.9 Stanford 197.2(H).
California 192.2(H).

Before the Cardinal's March
12th meet against IJ Mass, no Stan
ford gymnast had ever recorded a
perfect score of 10.0.
After last Friday's meet against
California (6-15. 0-7 Pac-10), there
were six perfect l()s listed in the
Stanford record books, and Mu
rakami owned four of them.


Josh Haner— Daily
Freshman Kristin Jensen scored a 9.975 on the uneven bars this
weekend in the No. 9 women's gymnastic team's victory over cross
bay rival California.
But despite posting record break
ing individual and team scores
against UMass and Cal, the Cardinal
can not help but look back on its
Spring Break with a tinge of disap
pointment as it finished in a tie for
fourth place at the Pac-10 Champi
onships held on March 20th in Cor
vallis. Ore. UCLA won the champi
onship (197.775) and host Oregon
State finished second (197.400)
while Arizona State ended the meet
in third with a 196.025.
Coming into the conference
championships, the Cardinal
seemed poised to make a serious run
at a second-consecutive conference
crown.

Although Stanford had lost con
ference matches to No. 23 Washing
ton and unranked Arizona this sea
son, it had also knocked off its three
most dangerous conference rivals,
N0.7 Arizona State, No. 10 Oregon
State and No. 12 UCLA.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, a
good regular season doesn't earn
any conference championships in
collegiate gymnastics.
"I think the team wanted to win
too badly. We focused a bit too much
on winning [the meet] and not
enough on our routines," said sec
ond-year Stanford head coach Mark
Cook. "It was a situation where the
rehearsal went well but when the
lights went on and the curtains went
up, we had some execution prob
lems."
Perhaps it was the pressure of try

ing to repeat as conference champi
ons, or the sense of urgency in know
ing that it only had two meets left in
which to post scores that would en
sure an automatic NCAA Regional
berth, but the Cardinal looked to be
a far different team at the confer
ence championships than in its im
pressive victories over UMass and
Cal.
And if it was the pressure that
caused the Cardinal to falter in Cor
vallis, it should come as no surprise
that it was senior co-captain Mu
rakami who kept the Cardinal on
pace.
Using her experiences over the
last four years to her advantage, Mu
rakami finished fourth in the all
around competition (39.450) and
second in both the uneven bars com
petition (9.950) and in the floor exer

cise (9.950).
Besides Murakami, Stanford
freshman Katy Herbert stood out
for the Cardinal. At the conference
championships, Herbert turned in
the best performance of her young
career en route to a 12th-place finish
in the all-around competition
(38.675) and fourth- and eighth
place finishes in the balance beam
(9.9(H)) and the uneven parallel bars
(9.575) respectively.
Although the fourth-place finish
was disappointing for the team, los
ing the Pac-10 crown does not mark
the end of the Cardinal season.
"Winning Pac-lOs was just anoth
er goal. We have other goals, and as
long as we come away from Pac-lOs
learning from that experience, that's
good for our team," Cook said.
If Cook meant winning its next

meet against Cal with an impressive
197.2(H) team score and taking the
top three spots in everylapparatus
the next week against Cal, it's fairly
safe to say that the Cardinal learned
from its experience at the confer
ence championships.
Adding to the three perfect scores
earned in the UMass meet, with Mu
rakami earning one on the uneven
bars and one in the floor exercise —
in addition to one by senior Tracey
Kohl in the floor exercise — Stanford
tallied three more 10s against Cal.
Murakami was again perfect on the
bars and floor exercise, and this time
junior Sarah Harding decided to join
the party with a perfect routine in the
floor exercise.
The Cardinal next returns to ac
tion on April l()th at NCAA Re
gionals.
