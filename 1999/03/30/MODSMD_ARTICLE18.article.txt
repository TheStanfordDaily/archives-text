The Cardinal exploded out of the
blocks this weekend for a superb
start to the 1999 track and field sea
son at the Stanford Invitational held
at Cobb Track and Angell Field.
In what head coach Vin Lananna
described as the best opening perfor
mance his Stanford squad has ever
produced, five Cardinal athletes
grabbed NCAA automatic qualify
ing marks and three more met provi
sional standards in their events.
The meet, attended by not only
the NCAA's top collegiate competi

an imposing lead with 8(H) meters to
go and stringing out the pack.
Weldon and Riley were patient

lap. Riley swung around a visibly
straining Rogers with 1(H) meters to
go. bringing Portland's Todd Davis
along for the ride.
Davis battled Riley down the
stretch, with Davis edging Riley at
the line. 13:4<KÂ»4 to 13:49.25, and
Weldon holding on for eighth in a
personal lust and N( 'AA provision
