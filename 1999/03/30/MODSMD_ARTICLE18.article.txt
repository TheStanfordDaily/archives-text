# Men burn up track

### Ben Allen Staff writer 
The Cardinal exploded out of the
blocks this weekend for a superb
start to the 1999 track and field sea
son at the Stanford Invitational held
at Cobb Track and Angell Field.
In what head coach Vin Lananna
described as the best opening perfor
mance his Stanford squad has ever
produced, five Cardinal athletes
grabbed NCAA automatic qualify
ing marks and three more met provi
sional standards in their events.
The meet, attended by not only
the NCAA's top collegiate competi
tion but alst) by many of the nation's
finest post-collegiate and profession
al athletes, lived up to the expecta
tions of greatness for which it is
renowned.
Hammer thrower Adam ("onnol-
Iv was the first to post an NC 'A A pro
visional mark for the Cardinal on
Saturday. His winning toss of 216
feet, nine inches was a good 11 feet
further than his nearest competitor,
and teammate Mark Ganek also
qualified provisionally with a throw
of 199-7, good enough for third.
Jeff Allen was impressive in the

400-meter hurdles, cruising to a sec
ond-place time of 52.00 seconds to
capture second place in a swirling
wind.
Saturday night's distance carnival
was the sight of a host of the nation's
top performances. In the 5.000 me
ters. senior Jon Weldon and sopho
more Jonathon Riley, who was run
ning unattached, glided through
much of the race in a tight pack led by
Nike's Nick Rogers. Rogers made a
strong move late in the race, taking
an imposing lead with 8(H) meters to
go and stringing out the pack.
Weldon and Riley were patient
and held strong. Blasting the final
lap. Riley swung around a visibly
straining Rogers with 1(H) meters to
go. bringing Portland's Todd Davis
along for the ride.
Davis battled Riley down the
stretch, with Davis edging Riley at
the line. 13:4<K»4 to 13:49.25, and
Weldon holding on for eighth in a
personal lust and N( 'AA provision
al mark of 13:55.21.
Because Riley ran unattached,
however, his mark does not qualify
him for the NCAA meet but does
meet the entrance standard for the
USA Track and Field Champi
onships.
"The S,(XX) was a great race for
both Jonathon Riley and Jon Wel
don," Lananna said. "Weldon set a
big PR [personal record] and Riley
met the USA I F standard, which was
our goal. I'm not worried about him
getting an NCAA qualifying mark.
He'll run a lot faster than that."
Immediately following the S,(XX)
was a hotly contested l().(XX)-meter
race in which 13 of the competitors
ducked under the NCAA automatic
qualifying standard.
Led by junior Brad Hauser, last
year's NCAA champion at the dis

tance, a pack of four Stanford runners
including Brent Hauser, Nathan Nut
ter and Jason Balkman worked to
gether to set a blistering pace which
few hut the Stanford crew could man
age.
"I did not want them to run that
hard, which I don't think they really
did," said Lananna of his 1(),(XX)-
meter men. "I just wanted them to
keep together and not lose touch with
each other."
Brad and Brent Hauser traded off
lap-leading duties until the final 4(X)
meters, when it was every man for
himself. Balkman surged with 3(X)
meters to go and appeared to be in
control until Brad Hauser pushed
past him in the final turn.
Coming down the homestretch.
Wake Forest's Nolan Swanson ap
peared seemingly out of nowhere.

gathered a head of steam and lunged
past the Stanford crew to take first
place honors in a nation-leading
28:31.51, just bettering Brad Hauser's
2831.82.
Balkman was third at 28:32.21
with Brent Hauser fourth in 28:35.07
and Nutter in seventh at 28:41.41.
Toby Stevenson's efforts on Sun
day were equally impressive as he
showed dominance in his pole vault
win.
Soaring over IX-2, Stevenson best
ed his nearest competitor by four
inches and qualified automatically for
the national meet in his event.
"Toby's performance was excep
tional," Lananna said. "He's always
been a money man for us."
The Cardinal will now gear up for
the Johnny Mathis Invitational meet
to at San Francisco State on April 3.
