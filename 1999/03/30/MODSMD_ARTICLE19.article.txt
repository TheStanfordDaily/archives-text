# Stars back for Card in women's opener
## 
### Barry Coooper Staff writer 
What better place to welcome in the season of new beginnings than at
Stanford's Cobb Track and Angell Field. The Stanford track facility wel
comed the start of the outdoor season this past weekend by hosting the
Stanford Invitational, the first of four home meets this season. The com
fortable spring weather provided a nearly perfect setting for outstanding
performances from some of the top female athletes in the country.
While not dominating the All-American-filled field, the Cardinal cer
tainly did not disappoint the hometown fans.
In the spirit of the season, several perennial powerhouses returned after
long breaks from competition to give the Cardinal a boost of depth as well
as morale. Perhaps most sorely missed during her break was multiple All
American Sarna Renfro. Renfro a fifth-year senior, missed the track sea
son last year due to injury.
After this past weekend's 12th-place finish in the K).(MK) meters with a
NCAA provisionally qualifying time of 34 minutes. 57 seconds, it appears
the team will be able to depend upon her to challenge for the K).(HM)- and
5,000-meter Pacific 10 titles that she earned in 1997. Joining Renfro in
breaking the provisional qualifying mark was teammate Linn Schulte-
Sasse with her 17th place time of 35:26.
Also returning from a two-year track hiatus was senior captain Mary
Cobb. Although Cobb ran cross country in the fall, she had not raced for
the Cardinal on the track since the 1997 season. The runner up in the 5.000
at that year's NCAAs. Cobb has recovered from her injuries, but was
plagued with illness this weekend.
Despite the sickness, Cobb was able
to open up her season with a 9:48
3,000-meter run, nine seconds off
the provisional mark. Teammates
Elena Villarreal and Laura Turner
also clocked in under 10 minutes to
finish in the top 25.
Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na was pleased with the way the duo
of veteran distance runners, Renfro
and Cobb, opened their season and
glad to have them back in leadership
positions.
"1 think all of the distance run
ners see them as their leaders,"
Lananna said. "They have been to
the nationals and have been success
ful at the national level, and I think
that whenever you have leadership
that you can point towards as having
had demonstrated measurable suc
cess. I think it certainly bodes well
for all of the other athletes."
Rounding out the distance
events was Sally Glynn in the 5,000-
meter run. With her fifth-place fin
ish in a provisional time of 16:22,
Glynn looks to gain her third All-
America honor this year after earn
ing one in cross country and indoor
track.
Tracye Lawyer, the runner-up at
last year's heptathlon, made her
own reappearance of sorts. After
having a late start to the indoor sea
son this past winter due to a knee in
jury stemming from soccer in the
tail. Lawyer appeared ready to
make a run at a national title by
competing strong in several events.
Her jump of live feet, eight 1 / 2
inches was good enough for a victo
ry in the high jump, while her efforts

in the long jump earned her a sixth
place finish behind teammates Tara
Oettinger (fifth) and Julie Tinker,
who finished second with a jump of
18" 10.5".
Lawyer also teamed up with
Robyn Woolfolk, the seventh place
finisher in the 100-meter hurdles:
Jayna Smith, the third-place finisher
in the 400-meters; and Danielle

Spurlock. to anchor the Cardinal to
a fourth-place finish in the 4xloo
meter relay.
Later on Sunday afternoon,
Smith and Spurlock teamed with
Wilsa Charles and LaShawndra
Pace for the final event of the meet,
the 4x4(X) meter relay. Their time of
3:49.10 was good enough to edge
Cal's team for third place.
