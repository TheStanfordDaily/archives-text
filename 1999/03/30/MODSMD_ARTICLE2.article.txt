## San Mateo man could be notorious "Oscar" 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
Yesterday morning the Stanford Police
Department arrested the man they allege
pestered, sexually harassed and threatened
countless campus females during four
years of prank calls.
Simon Posada, a 28-year-old San Mateo
resident, was charged with 17 counts of
electronic eavesdropping and two counts
of felony terrorist threats. Posada faces a
maximum of one year in prison and a
$10,000 line for each count.

Police suspect Posada is the notorious
prank caller previously known to the Stan
ford community simply as "Oscar." Police
said Posada may have also harassed
women at San Jose State. Posada has no
known connection to Stanford.
"This is an important breakthrough to
us because this individual has been harass
ing Stanford students for years," said Chief
of Police Marvin Harrington.
Served an initial search warrant on
March 16, Posada turned himself in to the
police yesterday. Arresting Officer Allen
James commented that Posada responded

with "shock and then almost relief."
"He told me that he realized he had a
problem and that he was unable to stop,"
James said at a press conference yesterday
afternoon.
The Stanford Police have been attempt
ing to determine Oscar's identity for the
past several years. More than 400 phone
harassment cases have been reported to
the department since 1995, and police esti
mate that number represents less than 20
percent of the number of Stanford women
