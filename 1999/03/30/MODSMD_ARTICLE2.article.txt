# Alleged prank caller arrested
## San Mateo man could be notorious "Oscar" 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
Yesterday morning the Stanford Police
Department arrested the man they allege
pestered, sexually harassed and threatened
countless campus females during four
years of prank calls.
Simon Posada, a 28-year-old San Mateo
resident, was charged with 17 counts of
electronic eavesdropping and two counts
of felony terrorist threats. Posada faces a
maximum of one year in prison and a
$10,000 line for each count.

Police suspect Posada is the notorious
prank caller previously known to the Stan
ford community simply as "Oscar." Police
said Posada may have also harassed
women at San Jose State. Posada has no
known connection to Stanford.
"This is an important breakthrough to
us because this individual has been harass
ing Stanford students for years," said Chief
of Police Marvin Harrington.
Served an initial search warrant on
March 16, Posada turned himself in to the
police yesterday. Arresting Officer Allen
James commented that Posada responded

with "shock and then almost relief."
"He told me that he realized he had a
problem and that he was unable to stop,"
James said at a press conference yesterday
afternoon.
The Stanford Police have been attempt
ing to determine Oscar's identity for the
past several years. More than 400 phone
harassment cases have been reported to
the department since 1995, and police esti
mate that number represents less than 20
percent of the number of Stanford women


Posada
who received calls from Oscar.
The break in the case came
through the increased technological
capability of the department, which
enabled it to determine the pattern
of the calls Oscar was making.
The prank caller had been hard
to capture, because he typically did
not call women repeated times. Re
cently, however, he targeted a list
of former residents from an un
named campus dormitory. Oscar
was calling those students in the
order they were listed on a dorm
list. The police department was
able to predict who his next victims
would be and trace the calls from
those numbers.
"He had specifically targeted a

group of ex-residents from one of
our dormitories.... It was just a
matter of trying to get one step
ahead of him," James said.
James said that the case was im
portant to the department because
of the psychological effect his calls
had on his victims. The prank caller
made threats against the safety of
several victims, although no one, to
the department's knowledge, was
physically harmed.
"Some of these girls were really
traumatized ... some of them so
much so that they left the school,"
he said.
Among the evidence collected
under the March search warrant
were audio and video tapes Posada
had made of his own calls in addi
tion to computer files which con
tained saved information from stu
dents' Web pages. He was gathering

personal information about stu
dents via their Web pages.
For this reason, Harrington cau
tioned students about revealing ex
tensive personal information on
Web pages. He intends to speak to
deans of University schools in
which students are required to
make Web pages as part of their
classes.
"I'm concerned that students
don't reveal too much personal in
formation," he said.
Harrington and James were
pleased that students reported the
incidents, which led to the arrest and
urged students to report similar inci
dents in the future.
"We have and will pursue every
complaint," Harrington said. "We
take this kind of thing very serious
ly"
Freshman Kristen Jensen had

been contacted this year by Oscar.
She said, when she received the call,
she thought that it was someone jok
ing around but then felt more scared
when she realized it was the notori
ous caller.
"I thought that Stanford was a re
ally safe campus, and it was scary to
know that someone was doing that
here," Jensen said. She said she
knew other women who had also
been contacted.
Harrington and James wanted to
reassure students that their safety
was secure.
"We want this to get out to the
victims so that they are not con
stantly looking over their shoulders.
... Some of them are still very
frightened," James said.
Posada has no previous record.
He is being held on a bond of
$2(X),(XX).
