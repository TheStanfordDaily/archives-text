All American. It has such a nice
ring to it.
At the NCAA Wrestling Cham
pionships held at Penn State, March
18-20, senior Beau Weiner (157 lbs.)
became the 10th wrestler in Stan
ford history to gain All-American
honors by placing seventh. Weiner
became the seventh All-American
wrestler under head coach Chris
Horpel.
"This means so much for our pro
gram," Horpel said. "Producing
Pac-10 champions and All-Ameri
cans is my indicator that we are com
peting at the highest levels. It will
help our younger athletes believe in
their potential to achieve the same
honor and it will help a lot with re
cruiting."
Weiner entered the tournament
riding a second-place finish at the
Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships and boosting a record of 22-
7. He was unseeded in the national
tournament and had a long road
ahead of him.
"I had a good feeling going into
this year's nationals," Weiner said.
"I felt strong the whole tournament
and all the hard work this year real
ly paid off."
In the first round, Weiner
squared off against Penn's Yoshi

Nakamura, who was seeded l()th.
Weiner was able to pull off the upset
in a 3-2 decision to advance. The sec
ond round pitted Weiner against
Jimmy Arias of Oklahoma State,
who was seeded seventh. In a dra
matic finish, Weiner won 3-1 in sud
den-death overtime to advance to
the quarterfinals.
"It still amazes me that Beau
came into the Pac-l()s unseeded but
made the finals," Horpel said. "He
then went into the NCAA's unseed
ed and came away with All-Ameri
can honors and he did it with wins
over big-time wrestling programs
like Oklahoma State, lowa and
lowa State."
In the quarters. Weiner met his
match in second-seeded Chad Kraft
of Minnesota, who went on to place
fifth. Despite all his effort, Weiner
was not able to overcome Kraft and
fell 4-1.
Weiner bounced back in the con
solation bracket to defeat David
Maldanado of lowa State by techni
cal fall 18-3 in 5 minutes, 48 seconds,
reaching Ail-American status by
being one of the top eight placers.
"Beau's match against Maldana
do was simply amazing," said junior
Zach Zimmerer, a qualifier at 133.
"He wrestled solid through the
whole tournament and was able to
ride the momentum he had going
from Pac-lOs."

Weiner fell 6-5 in the consolation
quarters to 1 lth-seeded Chris Ayres
of Lehigh. Ayres went on to finish
sixth.
Weiner, however, was able to
bounce back in the seventh-place
match to overcome sixth-seeded
Jamie Heidt of lowa 8-6.
Although fellow qualifiers Zim
merer and junior Rudy Ruiz (125)
wrestled well, they came up short in
close matches and were unable to
place.
"1 went in with high hopes and
low expectations," Horpel said. "I
knew all three had the potential to
bring home Ail-American honors
and at the same time 1 knew it was
possible that all three could have
bad tournaments."
Ruiz went 1-2 in the tournament
to close out a good year. He lost to
eventual fifth-place finisher Leroy
Vega of Minnesota 8-3 in the open
ing round, but was able to bounce
back and defeat Kevin Black of Wis
consin 2-1. In his final match, Ruiz
came up short against Eric Sluyter of
East Stroudsburg 6-4.
"Zach was very close to breaking
into the top eight and Rudy wrestled
tough," Horpel said. "The truth is, a
wrestler must win the close matches
if one is to be an All American."
