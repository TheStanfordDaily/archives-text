# Streaking No. 7 Cardinal falls to Washington once, UCLA twice over break
## Pac-10 brings Softball down to earth 
### Gabby Duno Contributing writer 
Stanford began Pacific 10 Conference play a little shaky — perhaps prov
ing the adage that what goes up most come down.
Taking the title at a tournament can have many great effects. In the last
two weeks since coming home with the Cal State-Fullerton Easton Showcase
Championship, the Cardinal softball team has pulled together some extra
ordinary feats. With just under eight weeks gone in the regular season, this
may be the best softball team Stanford has ever had.
Freshman outfielder Jessica Mendoza has not only impressed her peers
at Stanford (26-7, 1-3 Pac-10) and in the conference, but also in the nation.
After her incredible performance at the Fullerton tournament, Mendoza
was named Pac-10 Player of the Week. Just days later, the native of Camar
illo, Calif., received an even greater accolade, becoming the first softball
player in Stanford history to receive National Player of the Week honors for
the week of March 2-8.

As of that week, Mendoza was leading the team in batting average (.500),
hits (3<S). runs (26). doubles (8). triples (2), home runs (6) and slugging per
centage (.895). Just behind Mendoza in many of these categories was fellow
freshman Sarah Beeson. She was second on the team in batting (.412). RBI
(25). home runs (5) and doubles (6).
As if that wasn't enough, pitcher Marcy Crouch's recent performances
have earned her some deserving recognition. Having never thrown a perfect
game in three years at Stanford, the senior tallied her third perfect game of
the season in a sweep over Portland State on March 23. Crouch and fellow
senior pitcher Becky Blevins form one of the most formidable pairings of
pitchers in the nation. Collectively the two have dominated the competition.
Stanford's opponents have been unable to record many hits against
Crouch and Blevins, but the Cardinal has posted some impressive offensive
numbers as well. During the break, those numbers were tested as the team
began a grueling schedule, playing five teams in eight days.
Starting off at home, Stanford took two wins from Santa Clara in a dou
bleheader. In the first game, the Cardinal out-hit its opponents 10-1 en route
to a 9-1 victory. In the second game, Stanford capitalized on five Bronco er
rors to take the win 13-3.
Portland State suffered a similar fate, losing both games of its double
header games against the Cardinal. Having suffered a no-hit loss courtesy of
Blevins at the Fullerton tournament, the Vikings were outmatched 1-0 by
Crouch's perfect game in nine innings. Freshman Sarah Beeson's RBI single
scored catcher Kellie Wiginton for the winning run in the bottom of the
ninth. In game tv\o. Crouch allowed six hits and no runs, and Beeson again
provided the offense with a three-run homer in the seventh to seal the game.
Before beginning the Pac-10 season, Stanford handed Ohio University its
sixth and seventh straight losses. At the Stanford Softball Complex, the Car
dinal set a school record with 21 runs in its first game of the doubleheader. In
that game, Stanford scored a school-record-setting 19 runs in the second. Not
surprisingly, Beeson and Mendoza were the offensive stars of the game,
going a combined 6 for 7 with six RBIs.

In the second game, Stanford scored three runs in the fifth inning to take
the game 4-0 from the Bobcats. Freshman Robin Walker provided two key
hits in the game in the first and fifth innings to give the C ardinal the win. With
the combined 8.2 innings that Crouch threw in the doubleheader she upped
her streak of consecutive scoreless innings to 43.
Unfortunately tor the Cardinal, the winning streak continued for just one
more game as the Cardinal opened up the Pac-10 season with a 4-1 win in

Senior pitcher Marcy Crouch throws in her third perfect game this
season. Over Spring Break, the softball team won seven of its 10
games.
