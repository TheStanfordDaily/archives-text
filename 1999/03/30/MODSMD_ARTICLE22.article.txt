# Tennis thrillingly triumphs thrice
## 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
The No. 4 men's tennis team (11-
1, 5-0 Pacific 10 Conference) had
three solid wins over the break, which
is perhaps just what it needed as it
heads into its toughest weekend of
the season against UCLA and USC
this Friday. The Cardinal had wins
over BYU, Arizona and Arizona
State, but it struggled once again in
doubles play, which has been its
weakness all year.
On March 24 the Cardinal had a
convincing 7-0 victory over BYU at
the Taube Family Tennis Center.
The only match it had any difficulty in
was the No. 1 doubles in which senior
Ryan Wolters and freshman K.J.
Hippensteel were defeated 8-4.

"BYU was an above average
team, and we hadn't played a dual
mateh in close to four weeks, so I was
pleased with our play," head coach
Dick Gould said. "We got on top
early with the doubles point and
never gave them a chance to get back
in it in the singles."
ITie Cardinal wanted to use its
B YU victory as a tuneup for its week
end in Arizona, which are notorious
ly tough matches. Arizona has a feisty
squad and always seems to play well
in the altitude of its home air. Ari
zona State defeated No. 1 UCLA at
home earlier in the year and had two
extremely close losses to a tough
(JSC team as well. The Cardinal re
sponded well both days.
On Friday against Arizona, Stan
ford finally played solid doubles and
won all three matches to take that
point. It then went on to win five of
the six singles matches to win the
match 6-1.
"Arizona is not an easy place to
play, especially for a young team like
us," said sophomore Scotty Scott.
"We responded well, though, and it
was really nice to play the kind of

doubles we know we are capable of."
Assistant coach John Whitlinger
agreed.
"Everybody came to play and had
a pretty routine day against Ari
zona," he said. " They have given us a
little trouble in the past, but we never
gave them a chance."
It was a different story the next
day against Arizona State. This was a
match that could have gone either

way, as the Cardinal was down 3-2 be
fore junior Geoff Abrams and senior
Ryan Wolters pulled out two clutch
singles wins to give the Cardinal a 4-3
victory. In the Arizona State match
the Cardinal was once again plagued
by its inconsistent doubles play. It lost
all three of its doubles matches and
was thus forced to win at least four
singles matches for the victory.
"It is a bit frustrating, because I

thought we were making progress in
the doubles," Gould said. "We really
got schooled in all three of our dou
bles matches against Arizona State
and that set us back to square one
again. I was very pleased with the way
the guys battled back in the singles,
though."

Over Spring Break, the Stanford men's tennis team added three victories to their bright season. Fresh
man K.J. Hippensteel and his doubles partner Ryan Wolters were the only players to have difficulty dur
ing the past week's matches.
sophomores Ali Ansari and Alex
Kim both played very solid matches
to give the Cardinal a 2-1 lead. Then
the Cardinal suffered a bit of a set
back as Hippensteel lost his first sin
gles match of the season. When Scott
soon followed with a loss the Cardi
nal was suddenlv down 3-2 with two

matches still going. At the No. 1 sin
gles spot Wolters had won the first set
but was down 4-1 in the second. In
the No. 2 singles match Abrams had
lost the first set 6-4 but was up 4-2 in
the second.
Wolters played brilliant tennis
and took five straight games to win
his match in straight sets. 7-6.6-4.
When Wolters' match ended.
Abrams was about to begin his third
and deciding set. Abrams knew that

his match was the decider. He too
stepped up to handily win the third
set 6-2 to give the Cardinal its victory.
"This was a case of our experi
enced players stepping up and being
leaders when they need to." Gould
said. "Wolters once again had three
impressive wins over the break and
he continues to show why he is the
leader of our team. Geoff and Alex
both had solid matches as well. Our
experience really paved the way."
