# Card beats Northwestern, UNLV
## Women serve wins 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
The fifth-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (15-2 overall,
5-1 Pacific 10 Conference) scored
two solid wins last week, fostering
confidence among the players that
should come in handy as the Cardi
nal meets some of its toughest oppo
nents in upcoming weeks.
"I'm glad we won these two
matches," junior Teryn Ashley said.
"We had a long break before we
played them and it gave us time to
regroup mentally."
Apparently, the break served the
Cardinal well, as Stanford easily
stopped Northwestern, 7-2, on
March 23 and then overwhelmed
UNLV, 7-1, on March 25.
The Cardinal had no trouble
taming the Wildcats, although the
Northwestern women did manage
some singles victories.
At the No. 1 singles spot. fresh

man Marissa Irvin, ranked second in
the nation, powered past North
western's Katherine Nasser, 6-2,6-0.
Irvin's recent injuries are healing,
and she is also looking forward to
challenging for the nation's top
ranking later this season.

The University of San Diego's
Zuzana Lesenarova no longer has
the strangle-hold over the No. 1
ranking that she enjoyed during the
fall and most of the winter. In the lat
est rankings, Irvin trailed Lesenaro
va by a mere 3.71 points according to
the two players' respective point
per-match averages.
