# White-McCarty's fall inspires final victory
## Purdue sparks tourney 
### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
Coming into Sunday's champi
onship game of the NCAA women's
basketball tournament in San Jose,
all eyes were ready to watch Ten
nessee's Chamique Holdsclaw domi
nate as she had from day one. This
was to be the year the Lady Vols were
expected to win their fourth-straight
title, leaving all other teams dead in
their tracks.
All of a sudden the dream was
gone and Holdsclaw's squad didn't
even make it to the Final Four as
Duke upset the Vols, setting up a
Duke-Purdue matchup in the final. A
part of the spark was gone, and all
eyes began to search for a new star, a
player who could lead her team to the
most coveted piece of wood in sports.
That spark was almost completely
out, as the Blue Devils and Boiler
makers combined for a NCAA
record-low 40 points in the first half.
Yawns began to creep around the
San Jose Arena. It looked as if there
was to be no miracles, no heroes, no
inspiration for all the young fans who
watched with eyes the size of the bas
ketballs.
Then Stephanie White-McCarty,

one of the Boilermakers captains
along with Ukari Figgs, stepped up,
or rather, fell down. The Academic
Ail-American of the Year (bragging
an impressive 3.58 GPA), was
knocked to the ground as she took a
jumper in the lane. As she struggled
to get up, the Blue Devils banked in a
three, cutting Purdue's lead to five.
When she finally made it to the
bench with the help of her team
mates, her face a contorted mask of
pain and frustration, a shimmer
seemed to ripple throughout the Pur
due team. The quiet composure that
had been the trademark of these
Boilers was traded in for fired up
looks and yells of enthusiasm.
"We're going to win this for you,"
teammate Katie Douglas said.
Each Boilermaker finally found
the fire that had been so lacking, and
as White-McCarty watched from the
bench, her team went on a 13-0 run,
burying the Blue Devils behind a bar
rage of blocks, steals, post-ups and
jumpers.
It's not often that a player can lead
from the bench, but White-McCarty
did more than that â€” she inspired.
She made the crowd remember
why college hoops will always reign
supreme over professional ball. Her

team came together because that's
what you do when you've lived with,
eaten with and played with someone
for four years.
With all the trades in today's
sports, its easy to forget who plays for
what team, but Purdue reminded all
disillusioned fans that in this land of
milk and honey, it's not always about
the money. The team that had spent
the year in Tennessee's shadow final
ly emerged, and as the buzzer sound
ed. White-McCarty was able to for
get about the pain long enough to
jump out of her seat and celebrate the
Boilermakers final proof that they
were the top team in the nation.
After the game, White-McCarty
joined her teammates around the
basket, and as cheers of "Steph!"
shattered all ears, she struggled up
the ladder, a smile covering the pain
of a severely sprained ankle. Pure joy
could be seen on all faces of team
mates, and when she finally cut off
her piece of the net, the Purdue
crowd erupted in cheers.
Purdue finally had its first champi
onship, and the Final Four had a new
star to place among the great ones, a
player who had been more than a
leader. White-McCarty had inspired
greatness.
