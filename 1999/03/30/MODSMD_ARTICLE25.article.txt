# Gym's win barely enough

The No. 11 men's gymnastics
team kept its season alive with a
third-place finish in Saturday's
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Championship. The Cardinal closed
the meet in a dead heat with No. 9
Brigham Young but trailed both
No. 7 Oklahoma and No. 5 Nebras
ka. Both Nebraska and Oklahoma
scored 228.775 to finish in a tie for
first place.
Since only the top five teams
from each conference advance to
the NCAA Regionals, a top-five
finish was crucial if the Cardinal
hoped to continue its season and se
cure a spot in Regionals.
But. if the Cardinal hopes to ad
vance past the BYU-hosted Re
gional, it must secure a top-three
finish come April 10. Stanford can
finish behind two teams (most like
ly Nebraska and Oklahoma) but
must beat BYU and the other com
petitor (likely California) in order
to qualify for the national competi
tion.
Stanford coaches are planning
routines that are as difficult as possi
ble so long as its gymnasts are able
to perfect them all. Landing the rou
tines will be crucial if the Cardinal
hopes to accomplish what it has

been unable to do all season — top
BYU.
Saturday's MPSF championship
was a good start for the Cardinal, al
though it could have performed bet
ter.
"Team wise, we expected to do a
little better," said sophomore Ricar
do Andrade. "There was definitely
room for improvement."

MEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Saturday: No. 11 Stanford (11-7)
tied for 3rd, 224.275, Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation Championships.

Stanford senior co-captain Jason
Katsampes experienced a drop off
his usually stellar performances and
competed in just five competitions,
failing to qualify for the all-around
category. But despite faltering in
the ring competition, earning just an
8.1, he performed superbfy on the
pommel horse — finishing first in
the preliminary individual competi
tion and second in the individual fi
nals.
The other co-captain, Scott
Finkelstein, performed well in indi
vidual competition, placing third on
the horse and fifth on the floor. Ju
nior Craig Nesbitt advanced to the
finals in the vault competition and
finished seventh overall.
Nebraska gymnast Jason Hard

abura captured the all-around title
with a 57.875 score. For Oklahoma
it was senior captain Todd Bishop
who led the way, turning in a 9.925
score to win the horizontal bar com
petition. BYU gymnast Courtney
Bramwell turned in a show-stop
ping performance on the still rings,
nailing a 9.95 score.
Stanford's score of 224.275 is its
second highest overall of the season,
trailing only the season high it set
two weeks ago when it hosted Okla
homa.
In that match, the Cardinal
watched an early lead disappear in
the final event as the Sooners ended
up taking the match 225.225-224.65.
Stanford led from the beginning and
held the lead going into the final
event. However, to Stanford's im
mense frustration, the Sooners went
on to secure its highest score of the
evening on the parallel bars and
ended up overtaking the Cardinal.
Bishop, an Ail-American, was
the star of the show, capturing three
out of the six individual titles — the
parallel bars, the pommel horse and
the horizontal bars.
The Cardinal has performed
poorly in both dual-matches it has
competed in this season. With this
latest loss in its final home game of
the season, Stanford's record fell to
11-7.
