# Depleted volleyball rolls
## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
The Isth-ranked Stanford men's
volleyball team (8-8 overall. 6-8
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) has a way of making things in
teresting.
Over spring break, the Cardinal
competed in two matches against
San Diego State (1-13,0-12) and one
game against IJC-San Diego (3-16,
0-13), the two teams with the worst
records in the Pacific Division of the
MPSF. As expected, the Cardinal
rolled to victories in all three match
es.
What was not expected, howev
er. was that the Cardinal would earn
such wins without its usual arsenal of
talented attackers. Junior Ail-
American outside hitter Gabe
Gardner, junior Robin Lamb and
freshman Larry Witt were absent
during the past week's games and
their status is in question
March 20. the departure of the
three players did not affect the Car
dinal as it rolled to its fourth consec
utive victory in a 15-5, 16-14, 15-4
win over the San Diego State
Aztecs.
"We played our best volleyball of
the week against San Diego State,"
said sophomore setter Josh Lukens.
"There was a lot of confusion at the

start of the week because nobody
knew how to react, but a lot of the
stress has been alleviated."
A slow start and an inability to
sideout have been the two most
problematic aspects of Stanford's
play so far this year. Stanford over
came an initial slow start behind
sophomore middle blocker Dan
Zhang's .800 hitting percentage in
the first frame.
"()ur sideout game was good and
we prevented them from getting into
the first game," Lukens said.

Stanford's momentum did not
continue into the second game, in
which the Cardinal had to overcome
a 14- 1 ) deficit. Stanford's hilling per
centage fell from its game one mark
of .517 to .220. The Aztecs surren
dered three service errors on game
point, enabling the Cardinal to stay

competitive in game two.
The play of Stanford freshman
outside hitter Marcus Skacel and se
nior outside hitter Patrick Klein
helped the Cardinal overcome this
deficit and dominate game three. In
his third start in a row for the Cardi
nal. Skacel recorded a .474 hitting
percentage, the highest among
Stanford's attackers. Klein, who has
one of the top-20 kills average
among all players in the NCAA, tal
lied 21 kills in the win. The senior
also contributed 12 digs to record
his sixth double-double of the sea
son.
Klein's double-double perfor
mance was the norm of the week
end.
In the March 24 16-14. 15-10, 14-
17, 15-12 victory over the Aztecs,
Klein recorded a career-high .423
hitting percentage, as well as a ca
reer-high 43 kills, to capture his fifth
double-double of the season.
The 7-15.15-12.15-5,15-8 victory
over the UC-San Diego Tritons
March 23 was another total team ef
fort. after the squad established its
composure.
"It was the first time we played
with the new lineup and our nerves
affected us at the start," Palacios
said.
Klein recorded yet another dou
ble-double with 2 C ) kills and 10 dins.
