Law Students for Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Equality, unveiled The
Solomon Project, an online resource
that uses the latest Internet sound

campus.
The Web site is a "culmination of
a group effort that has been going on
for the past two years," said the Web
site's designer Derek Roberti, a first

law student and co-chair of Out Law.

and relays the latest progress and in

see his or her voting record. Visitors
can then copy and send a letter en
couraging representatives to support
the repeal of the Solomon Amend

own office non-discrimination poli
