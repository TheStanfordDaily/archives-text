# Out Law unveils online project to fight Solomon Amendment
## 
### Vlada Teper Contributing writer 
On March 17 OutLaw, Stanford
Law Students for Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Equality, unveiled The
Solomon Project, an online resource
that uses the latest Internet sound
and animation technology to pro
mote the repeal of the 19% Solomon
Amendment. The amendment de
nies federal funding to schools that
bar the military from recruiting on
campus.
The Web site is a "culmination of
a group effort that has been going on
for the past two years," said the Web
site's designer Derek Roberti, a first

law student and co-chair of Out Law.
" This is the first time I've seen some
thing like this for a political cause,"
said Roberti.
The Web site provides access to
background information about the
Solomon Amendment, allows visi
tors to write letters to representatives
and relays the latest progress and in
formation regarding the efforts to re
peal the act.
Through the "Start a Campaign"
link, visitors can select a representa
tive from their own home area and
see his or her voting record. Visitors
can then copy and send a letter en
couraging representatives to support
the repeal of the Solomon Amend

ment.
"I had to take data and put it in a
format that was usable. In other re
spects it was pretty straight forward."
said Quang Tue Nguyen, a volunteer
who helped design the database.
Second-year law student Liz
Lester provided the research for the
database. Just before Christmas she
went looking for voting records. "I
gave ratings to representatives based
on four issues: whether they had their
own office non-discrimination poli
cies, how they voted on the employ
ment non-discrimination act, how
thev had voted on the Hate-Crimes
Prevention Act. and their response to
President Clinton's executive order
regarding prevention of discrimina
tion in Federal agencies that was
eventually defeated in the House of
Representatives," said Lester.
Looking at representatives'
records, a Web site visitor can decide
which representatives to send letters
to. Then visitors can copy a template
letter to Microsoft Word, print it out
and mail it to the provided address.
Representative Barney Frank (ID-
Mass), who spoke to Stanford stu
dents in October, provided much in
spiration for action. "Barney basical
ly gave a call to arms," said second
year law student Allen Drexel, the
former head of Out Law. "We hope
that the Web site will prove a catalyst
for students and others across the
country dedicated to repealing the
Solomon Amendment."
The 1996 Solomon Amendment is
designed to compel schools to accom
modate military recruiters even
though the military's "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell" employment practices vi

olate the nondiscrimination policies
of some law schools. It withholds fed
eral funding, including work-study
grants and Perkins loans, from any
academic institution that prohibits
military recruiting on campus.
"It is an ironic situation in which
you have the financially needy stu
dents getting punished and progres
sive students not able to participate in
public interest work," said Drexel.
Representative Tom Campbell
(R-Calif.) and Frank have proposed
legislation to repeal the portion of the
amendment that denies financial aid
to schools that bar military recruiting
on campus.
Already "The Web site has
opened up a lot of avenues of com
munication with students in other law
schools that are organizing around
Solomon," said Roberti, who has
been corresponding with students at
the University of Vermont lawschool
and others.
The Web site is also constantly up
dated and soon will feature an e-mail
card link, similar to an Internet greet
ing card program.
