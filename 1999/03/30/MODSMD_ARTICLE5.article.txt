# Flasher strikes; police suspect link to earlier Rains incident
## 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
A female student was startled by a flasher while
walking near Rinconada at about 9:15 p.m. on March
23.
The victim told police that the flasher, who wore
pants with t he groin area removed, exposed himself as
he passed her, avoiding eye contact. No words were
exchanged. The victim then ran to her car and locked
the door. She reported the incident to police four min
utes later, after the suspect was out of sight.
The flasher was described as a white male in his
mid-40s. He was 6 feet tall, with a medium build and
dark hair.
Though there had not been any flashing incidents
in the Wilbur Hall area for several months, the police
are investigating a link to another indecent exposure
incident that occurred last December at Rains Hous
es.
The suspects in both incidents were reported as
white males in their mid-40s. Also both suspects wore
glasses, a blue jacket and black spandex pants. Both
incidents occurred around the same time of night.
"We can't be sure, but it looks pretty similar,"
Stanford Police Lt. Densil Bandy said.
No arrests have been made in the case.
Stanford police usually respond to indecent expo
sure cases by writing a full alert and distributing it to
the patrol division, which then keeps an eye out for
the suspect.
"In the past, we have done some directed patrol ac
tivities, where we worked an area where we were get
ting hit for indecent exposure," Bandy said.
Stanford police typically investigate four to five
flashing cases a year. There have been a total of two
flashing incidents reported this year. The number is
consistent with previous norms for this time of year.
Former Stanford Police Chief Raoul Niemeyer
speculated that victims only report one out of five in
decent exposures. He warned students not to make
contact with someone who is indecently exposing him
or herself.
"Go somewhere safe and report it," Bandy said.
