## Not your usual late-night fare 
### Murtaza Alimohamed Contributing writer 
It was alter 2 a.m. on March 12,
the Friday of Dead Week, when
viewers of the student-run SCBN
channel found something entirely
new playing on Stanford TV:
pornography.
According to SCBN station man
ager Katie Tipson. a sophomore.
SCBN probably will not repeat such
screenings in the future. "Pornogr
pahy was not appropriate, and we're
not going to do it again," she said.
At an hour when SCBN was ac
cepting requests for screenings,
some students called in and request

ed pornographic movies. Tipson ex
plained that SCBN runs shows
based on student requests, and. ,
when some students requested
pornography, the station obliged.
"We are a student station, and a
lot of what we show is by student re
quest. That was our justification,"

Tipson said. She also explained that,
owing to the nature of the film, she
decided to screen the pornographic
film late at night when fewer viewers
could be expected.
However that didn't happen.
Tipson said. "More people watched
than we expected. A lot of people
took offense, and some people com
plained to the University," she said.
Tipson admitted that the deci
sion to run the film was probably
wrong. "There are limits, and
there's no reason to cross [them],"
she said, adding "we have to consid
er every bod v who could be watch
