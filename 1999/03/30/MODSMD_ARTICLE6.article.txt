# SCBN rethinks decision to air pornography
## Not your usual late-night fare 
### Murtaza Alimohamed Contributing writer 
It was alter 2 a.m. on March 12,
the Friday of Dead Week, when
viewers of the student-run SCBN
channel found something entirely
new playing on Stanford TV:
pornography.
According to SCBN station man
ager Katie Tipson. a sophomore.
SCBN probably will not repeat such
screenings in the future. "Pornogr
pahy was not appropriate, and we're
not going to do it again," she said.
At an hour when SCBN was ac
cepting requests for screenings,
some students called in and request

ed pornographic movies. Tipson ex
plained that SCBN runs shows
based on student requests, and. ,
when some students requested
pornography, the station obliged.
"We are a student station, and a
lot of what we show is by student re
quest. That was our justification,"

Tipson said. She also explained that,
owing to the nature of the film, she
decided to screen the pornographic
film late at night when fewer viewers
could be expected.
However that didn't happen.
Tipson said. "More people watched
than we expected. A lot of people
took offense, and some people com
plained to the University," she said.
Tipson admitted that the deci
sion to run the film was probably
wrong. "There are limits, and
there's no reason to cross [them],"
she said, adding "we have to consid
er every bod v who could be watch


Sarah Martin — Daily
ing us."
According to sophomore Melissa
Luke, SCBN's public relations direc
tor, the lack of prior warning to the
public about the film also caught
viewers off guard. "It probably
wasn't appropriate, and it was shown
without people knowing about it,"
she said.

Tipson stated the decision to air
pornography was hers alone. "1 re
ceived the request and decided to
run it," she said. "The board did not
know about this." According to Tip
son, when the matter reached
SCBN's board of directors, its mem
bers agreed that the film probably
shouldn't have aired.
Some students were appalled at
SCBN's decision to air pornography.
"It crosses the degree of moral re
sponsibility you would expect," ju

nior Rita Ng said. "It reflects badly
upon our I Jniversity when things like
that happen."
Sophomore Lamont Tang also
echoed similar sentiments. "Porn is
not an appropriate educational or
entertainment public broadcast," he
said. "11 [people) want to see porn
they should go rent it and view it pri
vately."
As a consequence of the airing
and the subsequent backlash, the
SCBN board is exploring the adop

tion of previously nonexistent guide
lines regarding, appropriate screen
ing material, Tipson said. "Our goal
is to serve the audience, and we have
to consider everybody who could be
watching us."
However Tipson clarified that
any guidelines the board adopts will
not act as restrictions. "[The guide
lines] are not a matter of restricting
what we show but just giving us a
sense of direction as to what is ap
propriate and what isn't," she said.
