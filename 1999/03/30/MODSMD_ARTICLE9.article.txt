Court will rule on student fees
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court
agreed yesterday to decide whether public universi
ties can use mandatory student activity fees to subsi
dize campus groups that pursue political goals.
The justices said they will review rulings that
barred the University of Wisconsin from dipping into
activity fees it collects from every student to finance
such groups. Advocates for gay-rights organizations
say limiting subsidies will hurt "disfavored groups"
nationwide.
A decision is expected next year.
A federal trial judge and an appeals court ruled
that the subsidies unlawfully force some students to
subsidize views they find objectionable and thereby
violate free-speech rights.
