THIS YEAR A LOT OF COLLEGE
SENIORS WILL BE GRADUATING
INTO DEBT.
Under the Army's
Loan Repayment
program, you could get
out from under with a
three-year enlistment.
Each year you serve
on active duty reduces
your indebtedness by one
third or $1,500, which
ever amount is greater,
up to a $65,000 limit.
The offer applies to Perkins Loans, Stafford Loans,
and certain other federally insured loans, which are not
in default.
And debt relief is just one of the many benefits
you'll earn from the Army. Ask your Army Recruiter.

ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AND DEVELOPMENT
How do global environmental problems affect
developing countries? What is the relationship
between environmental degradation, poverty, and
population? Why do the perspectives of developing
countries in the South differ from the industrial
nations of the North, and what can be done to
reconcile environmental concerns with the
amelioration of poverty?
