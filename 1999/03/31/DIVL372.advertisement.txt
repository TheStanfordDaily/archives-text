In response to student feedback, assignments to the new Freshman/Sophomore College
will be made through the Draw, not through a separate application process as earlier
indicated. You will simply need to obtain a "priority" for the Draw.
Three information sessions will be held. Come hear more:
• April sth, 6:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. — Branner Lounge
• April 7th, 6:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. — Casa Zapata Lounge
• April 14th, 6:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. — Eucalipto Lounge
Here are some answers to the questions you have asked about the
Freshman/Sophomore College:
The Freshman/Sophomore College is a residence for approximately 90 freshmen and 90 sophomores who are interested in broad
intellectual exploration of the liberal arts and sciences. As the residential complement to Stanford Introductory Studies (SIS), the
College connects residential life with the mentoring and academic activities offered through SIS courses. Programs will include:
on-location seminars which begin or conclude with dinner, oral communication workshops, study groups organized around common
courses, and faculty presentations of scholarship and research over dinner at the Dean's house, located across the street from the College.
The Freshman/Sophomore is NOT Sophomore College. Sophomore College (also an SIS program) is a three-week program which takes
place before school starts, while the College is a year-long residential experience.
The College is NOT a "sophomore SLE". The College focuses on helping students navigate the University's resources in supporting stu
dents' academic exploration. There will be some courses taught on-location, but they will be open to all freshmen and sophomores and
are not required of each resident (though they will be given priority in signing-up for the class).
The atmosphere of the College will be like that of places where other freshmen and sophomores live: energetic and lively. The College
will be based in Schiff and Adams Houses; upper-class students will live in Potter and Robinson. The usual social and
cultural activities which occur in other houses will, of course, take place in the College as well.
