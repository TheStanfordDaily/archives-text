# Flung from the white towers
## FARM grants send groups to adventure 
### Carleen Pino 
Kayaking down Cannery Row
and whitewater rafting on the
Kern River are examples of some
of the adventures freshmen stu
dents will enjoy this quarter — all
courtesy of the Undergraduate
Advising Center.
The Freshman Advising, Re
sources and Mentoring Program
provided grant opportunities for
participating groups to pursue in
terests outside the classroom. The
program, funded through the
Provost's Office, advertised grants
averaging $300, but would not
specify the amounts awarded.
Four groups won grants out of the
10 that applied.
The FARM Program involves
17 advising groups from West La
gunita, Otero and Rinconada.
Each advising group, consisting of
six to eight advisees, a faculty advi
sor, an academic advisor and a
graduate mentor, brainstormed
ideas, incorporating personal in
terests with academic endeavors
for grant proposals,
"Four Undergraduate Advising
Center staff members reviewed
the proposals and ensured that
each met the outlined criteria,"
FARM coordinator Maia Young
said. "The committee evaluated
each proposal according to acade
mic potential, preparation, cre
ativity and the quality of writing,
giving greater weight to academic
potential and preparation."
One successful project integrat
ed Steinbeck's "Cannery Row"
with actual kayaking in Monterey
and Canary 13ay.
Another recipient group,
proposing a trip to see jazz musi
cian Jack Dejohnette perform at

Yoshi's jazz club in Oakland, sim
ply stated, "We wish to be inspired.
We ask nothing less than to be
moved. Hung (if briefly) from the
white towers of Academia and into
the blue chords of Jazz."
"We were really surprised when
we found out about the grant
award. We're thrilled to be going
to Yoshi's this Sunday," group
member Nivi Kumar said. "We're
seeing an afternoon performance
at the Jazz House. Often the per
formers talk to the visitors about
the show. We're all looking for
ward to going. For most of us, this
will be the first jazz performance
we've seen."

"We knew we had a good pro
posal but there we also knew there
were other groups applying as
well," said Nicholas Lopez, a mem
ber of an advising group that re
ceived a grant to explore different
research fields through a Whitewa
ter rafting and hiking trip.
Rejected proposals included
taking trips to "The Price is Right"
and investing in the stock market.
Students strove to adhere to the
purpose of the FARM Program as
they chose their topics. Another
recipient group chose to explore
the beat movement through litera
ture and to experience it by taking
a walking tour of the Literary

North Beach in San Francisco
where the movement flourished.
"We discussed a lot of different
ideas before deciding on one," said
Annie Chan, a member of the beat
movement group. "We knew that
this idea integrated education and
entertainment. This project was
something we were all interested
in doing and something we knew
we could do."
The proposals surpassed expec
tations of the FARM staff. "I hope
that next year's students will look
to these proposals as examples and
that [the proposals] will give future
students incentives to apply,"
Young said.
