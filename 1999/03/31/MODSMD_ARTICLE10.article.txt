BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic insisted yesterday that NATO attacks stop before he
moves toward peace, declaring his forces ready to fight "to the
very end." NATO answered with new resolve to wreck his mili
tary with a relentless air assault.
More than six hours of talks with Russia's prime minister
yielded a statement by Milosevic that he was willing to rein in a
harsh campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and resume
peace talks if the NATO strikes stopped.
His proposal was rejected by NATO leaders including Presi
dent Clinton, who warned that atrocities against ethnic Albanians
would weaken Serbia's claim to the separatist province and
increase NATO's determination to destroy Milosevic's army.
"We will see that his military will be seriously diminished, key
military infrastructure destroyed, the prospect for international
support for Serbia's claim to Kosovo increasingly jeopardized,"
Clinton said, adding that the allies "must remain steady and
determined."
NATO officials said the number of ethnic Albanians who have
fled Kosovo in the last six days has grown to 118,(MX), and Pec, a
city of 100,000 in western Kosovo, has been "almost totally
destroyed."
Kosovo Albanians kept up their exodus by foot, car and cart,
pouring across the border and overwhelming Albania, one of the
world's poorest countries. The cries of babies echoed in the air,
and their parents looked exhausted. Many were close to tears.
At least eight elderly refugees, exhausted by the journey, died
in a hospital Tuesday in Kukes, Albania. One woman had deep
scratches on her knees, suggesting that she was dragged or
crawled at one point during her flee to safety.
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who met with

Milosevic in Belgrade, said upon his arrival later in Bonn, Ger
many, that the Yugoslav leader was ready for renewed negotia
tions if NATO stops the bombing.
He said Milosevic wants the talks to include "the interests of
all groups in Kosovo" — a reference to the Serb minority in
Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
A statement from Milosevic's office read on state-run televi
sion said: "To open the space for negotiations, (NATO) aggres
sion on Yugoslavia has to stop immediately."
The Pentagon ordered five B-l bombers and additional air
defense-jamming planes and refueling tankers to Europe for
intensified airstrikes.
In Bonn, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the current
president of the European Union, called Milosevic's offer unac
ceptable. He specifically rejected the condition that NATO stop
its attacks first.
"The signal that the international community expects is the
withdrawal of Yugoslav military and paramilitary units from
KosoVo," Schroeder said.
In his statement, Milosevic also called for NATO troops in
neighboring Macedonia to be removed and a halt in alleged
NATO support for the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic
Albanian rebels fighting for independence.
"We are ready to defend our country to the very end. It is not
the first time Yugoslavia has had to defend itself and its right to
sovereignty and territorial integrity and national pride," Milose
vic said.
Reports of mass killings and forced removals by Serb forces,
with entire villages being burned and cities cleared of ethnic
Albanians, have increased since NATO forces began the bomb
ing and missile campaign last Wednesday.
