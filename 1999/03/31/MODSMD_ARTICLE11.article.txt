# Philip Morris to pay $81 million
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — In the
biggest liability verdict ever against the
tobacco industry, a jury ordered Philip
Morris to pay $81 million yesterday to the
family of a man who died of lung cancer
after smoking Marlboros for four decades.
The victory by the wife and children of
Jesse Williams was the second major hit
against Philip Morris this year. A San Fran
cisco jury awarded $51.5 million last month
to a Marlboro smoker who has inoperable
lung cancer.
The jury, which found Williams and the

company to be equally negligent, awarded
$1.6 million in compensatory damages and
$79.5 million in punitive damages.
Although no smoking liability verdict
against the tobacco industry has survived
on appeal. Wall Street analysts had been
watching the Portland case closely to see if
huge damage awards against Big Tobacco
were now a trend.
The Williams family, who sought $101
million, alleged the company knew its
cigarettes could cause cancer.
Testimony portrayed Williams, a for

mer janitor with the Portland school sys
tem, as a three-pack-a-day Marlboro
smoker who believed the manufacturer
wouldn't sell a harmful product.
Philip Morris attorney Walter Cofer
said he will appeal. He noted the tobacco
industry has a 40-year history of prevailing
in such cases.
"If you look at this verdict, it was not
supported by the evidence," Cofer said.
Cofer said Williams was aware that
smoking could harm his health and had
been warned by doctors and his family.
