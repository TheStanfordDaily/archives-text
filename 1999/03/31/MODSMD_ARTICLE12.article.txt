Casa embezzler trial
raises questions about
Row accountability

WHEN JEREMY SMITH
pleaded no contest to
felony charges and
returned more than $23,000 in stolen
funds, the fiscal problems that start
ed last year for La Casa Italiana
were finally resolved. The former
financial manager had admitted
guilt, and everything seemed to be
very much in order.
However, we feel that residents of
La Casa Italiana and the rest of the
Row would commit a grave mistake
if they simply returned to life as it
was before the embezzlement scan
dal. The fact that house financial
managers can seriously abuse their
power has been proven, and admin
istrators, Row residents and espe
cially financial managers should be
acutely aware that it could easily
happen again.
We applaud the measures taken
by Laurette Beeson, the assistant
director of student management at
Residential Education's Row office.
From now on, house accounts are
prohibited from being accessible by
ATM cards to make withdrawals,
managers are required to have
refund and surplus policies, random
audits will be conducted and the use
of Intuit's Quickbooks will be stan
dardized to keep house financial
records in order.
However, the discrepancy that
allowed Smith to take such a large
sum of money from house funds has
si ill not been addressed.
Smith stole money from La Casa

Italiana's reserve, the funds that the
house keeps from previous quarters
to meet expenses at the beginning of
each school year. Row houses must
take great care not to amass huge
surpluses that are so easily suscepti
ble to a devious financial manager
and also have the potential to be
mismanaged even by a scrupulous
person.
In addition, residents should not
hesitate to ask about surpluses at the
end of the year and should know
their houses' refund policies. After
all, the funds in question come
directly from the pockets of Row
residents.
Smith's case brings up troubling
questions that extend well beyond
the finances of one Row house.
When a student placed in a position
of power commits such an egregious
act against those in his house, the
University's policy of treating stu
dents like adults is called into ques
tion and not without justification.
When students are allowed to
manage their own funds and abuse
that power as Smith did, the credi
bility of not just Row financial man
agers but students in general is jeop
ardized. Currently, Stanford stu
dents pay their own bills, govern
themselves to a large extent and
manage most of their own lives. We
believe that students' conduct
demonstrates that they deserve
these rights, but fear that incidents
like the Smith case can undermine
this evidence.
If Row houses want to retain the
power to manage themselves and
reinforce the legitimacy of their right
to do so, everyone involved, from
administrators to residents, must do
their part.
