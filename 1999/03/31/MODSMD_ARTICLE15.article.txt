# Breathing Lessons
## April Van Scherpe Saving yourself for love 
### 
IN THE MATTER of
fact, llth-grade way
that my high school
English class was taught to
appreciate Robert Brown
ing, feelings were simple to
organize. Highlighting our
way through "The Last

Duchess," we pegged the narrator as a
stingy, manipulative, detestable old man.
After all. why had his little wife, the duchess
of the title, suffered disdain and neglect at his
hands? Excessive happiness. "She had a
heart / how shall I say / too soon made
glad/she liked whate'er she looked on, and
her looks went everywhere." Class, who
could resent someone for glowing with
delight? Take out a sheet of paper, despise
the Duke and martyr the Duchess. Very
easy.
Nowadays, 1 find the poem less straight
forward. Neglect and abuse are irreconcil
able. But walking down dorm hallways and
darting through 10 minutes to the hour
crowds and curling up on the couch for dorm
movies, it becomes possible to understand
how other people's broad-grinned, tight
squeezing, deliciouslv effusive personalities
could be hurtful to the ones they love.
It became clear to me a few weeks ago,
when a beach walk with a male friend took a
turn from basic, toe-mediated sand squishing
to a crestfallen conversation threaded with
tears. The valve-turner behind the water
works was his girlfriend. They enjoyed each
other's company immensely — had captivat
ing midnight conversations, the same
favorite pizza toppings and all of the other
hallmarks of a decent college romance —
but he complained that she forever exuded
affection to positively everyone. She danced.

hugged, caressed, whispered, massaged,
wrestled, divulged her innermost thoughts —
all of these to him and to others alike, male
or female, it didn't matter whom. And he
was upset.
At a glance, the issue seems like one of
jealous control, or perhaps a post office-style
vendetta against smiley people who enjoy
life and friendship. But when the hallmate
nuzzling at your loved one's neck is indeed
the Pinnacle of Platonica, the feeling that
pools in your stomach is less green than yel
low. How wonderful to have so many close
friends, indeed, how lucky to know so many
outlets for goodwill and human relation.
How heart-swelling to have another
person — better yet. several other people —
remind you of your love for life. But at the
end of the day, if you treat everyone with
glee and adoration, how else will you treat
the one you love? If your hugs and your kiss
es and your swapped secrets are public
domain, how will your special someone
know who she or he is? If you give
yourself — your mind, your body, your
deepest thoughts, your tender touches —
away to everyone, what is left to give?
To discuss limiting one's self is tricky
ground, and the word "possession" has
crossed the mind of many a reader by now.
Where does one draw the line between activ
ities interior to a love relationship and those
permissible on the exterior? The whole
proposition draws a shiver at the prospect of
unhealthy control. But in truth, however
much designating the details sounds icky
most people have a concept of what is and is
not appropriate for friends and lovers.
What's out for friends? Sex? Probably.
Touching? Perhaps. Low whispers? The
standards vary. Illuminating specific actions

becomes absurd.
The impetus behind looking at what's for
beer buddies and what's for bed buddies isn't
about monitoring, anyway. It's about main
taining intimacy. Being very close to other
people in mind comes from opening yourself
up to them, revealing some part of yourself
you don't reveal to many others because it is
face-flushingly personal, linked closely to
your emotions and so to the way you see the
world, to your private thoughts. Intimacy
with a partner means recognizing in one
another the wondrous phenomenon of
being. It is characteristic of the process that
bonding in this way involves becoming vul
nerable; people often do not emotionally
bond with everyone. Rare is it to find some
one who will match and understand you well
enough to undertake the endeavor.
When you see your loved one loving
other people, some of the strands of exclu
sive intimacy appear to unwind. To be sure,
your partner is not with you because she or
he cannot find closeness anywhere else but
because you are that unique match. The
inward intimacy, though, is expressed
through the outward — touches, kisses, mas
sages, secrets. To show your love, show your
intimacy.
As for Browning, the Duchess adored
everyone and the Duke felt no love. "She
smiled, no doubt, whene'er I passed her, but
who passed without much the same smile?"
Forget high school English, and try some
modern radio advice instead. "Nobody
knows it. but you've got a secret smile, and
vou use it onlv for me."

April Van Scherpe is a junior who is cur
rently undeclared.
