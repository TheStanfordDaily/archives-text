Bookstore should be academic
It's pathetic that this campus might end
up with a Barnes Noble bookstore. How
ridiculous to bring in a monolithic, for-profit
national chain, whose selection is standard
and only quasi-academic, and plop it right in
the middle of our "non-profit" academic
institution. What a waste of space and
resources.
Books are what the academic life is about.
It you want to make Stanford an academic
place, give it an academic bookstore whose
first and foremost goal is to offer the esoter
ic texts that characterize American academic
life. And offer them to as many people as
possible. Stanford undergraduates are bliss
fully anti-intellectual enough already.
Fhe last thing we need is a Barnes &
Noble which puts watered-down. New York
Times bestseller list titles on big displays in
the front and slicks a new translation of Kant
on the back shelves. I'his isn't just an aes
thetic question. The bookstore reflects the
health of the intellectual heart of the campus.
Right now, those old arteries are clogged,
and the culprit is Stanford's corporate glut
tony.
II Stanford were a real university and not
a company doing university-like stuff, we'd
have a student co-operative bookstore like
Harvard and Yale. But we don't, and I'm not
sure why.
I'll bet it's two things. One, the adminis
tration's values are disgustingly Wall Street.
That's something every student mumbles
about (and it's another important conversa
tion entirely).

Second, the administration is incompe
tent. The Stanford Bookstore has had Don
ald Kennedy and Gerhard Casper's hands
tied behind their backs for years. I'm sure
this school has enough money and lawyers to
have thrown the current owners out of that
place years ago. But they couldn't get their
stuff together, and they wouldn't make a
campaign out of it. because fundamentally
they're scared of allowing anything but the
homogenizing effects of big-business free
marketism to run the campus resources.
But the administration's incompetence is
dehumanizing, and it doesn't take a cultural
critic to note that most Stanford students
have gone through hell and back dealing
with the current Stanford Bookstore. It's not
just that they jack up prices and do shady
things like sometimes mark the downstairs
textbooks higher than the upstairs books or
offer phantom "rebates" or blame professors
when they fail to stock textbooks. It's also
that the current bookstore looks just like
your local shopping mall.
I didn't go to college to live in a shopping
mall. I came to get a perspective outside of
the suburban wasteland in which 1 grew up,
which probably means I shouldn't have come
to Stanford in the first place. But in that case,
on behalf of one who came from the land of
shopping malls, take my word that that cul
ture is indeed a pathetic one. In deciding
what to do with our bookstore, we would be
idiots to let in a Barnes & Noble; we should
be running from that world and pointing our
compass toward academic integrity.

1 am writing this letter to protest against
the article about the situation in Yugoslavia
and especially about the "funny" illustration
about Serbian people in the Opinions sec
tion of the newspaper.
This cartoon is a direct punch in the face
for all of us from Yugoslavia who are study
ing here at Stanford. People are dying in
Yugoslavia, both Serbs and Albanians. This
is happening because the American govern
ment and media ignore history and do not
want to really get to know the situation in
that region. The same mentality of reck
lesness and showing off is found in the illus
tration about the "Serbian reasons for fight
ing over Kosovo" which was published on
Monday.
Since March 24, we have been in constant
fear for our families back in Yugoslavia.
They have been bombed non-stop for the
past seven days. It is not true that just mili
tary targets have been hit. Among the civil
ian targets that have been hit are more than
50 schools, a number of kindergartens and
universities, the monasteries of Cetinje and
Gracanica and a number of civilian plants
and villages without any military function.
NATO does not want to admit that, and
CNN does not cover this in its reports.
The sad thing is that The Daily does not
cover it either and does not want to put the
least effort toward discovering the truth.
The truth is everywhere, just do not ignore
it. I admit it takes guts to put the truth in the
newspapers, when all the major agencies are
ignoring and twisting it as it suits political

interests.
I regard this University as one of the top
schools in this country and one that pro
duces the intellectual cream of American
society. Therefore, all the institutions of the
University, including The Daily, should aim
to educate the student population not only
in certain fields of interest but also in broad
knowledge and awareness of the economy,
politics and position of the U.S. in the world
as well as the events and crises throughout
the world.
The effort of The Daily to present the
political situation to the average Stanford
student is obvious and deserves respect.
However, there is one important thing that
is lacking in these reports and that is objec
tivity, which should be of utmost importance
to every journalist in the world. The reports
of The Daily are polarized, especially in the
cases of unjust war actions of NA TO against
little countries such as Libya, Iraq, Sudan,
Afghanistan, a number of South American
countries, Bosnian Serbs and now my home
country of Yugoslavia.
The Daily should not forget, however,
that as a newspaper it is also responsible for
revealing the truth to the public, no matter
how hard and painful it is to reach it. As for
the Serbian students here at Stanford, we
are going to try to organize a lecture about
the history of the Serbs and Albanians in
Kosovo and do our best to present the ori
gins of the crisis. The date of the lecture will
be announced this week.
