Q: How does a laser printer work? And why is the
paper warm when it conies out?
A: Almost 18 years ago, my family bought our first per
sonal computer: an IBM PC desktop machine with a
monochrome monitor, external tape drive (the kind
that records data on the same cassette tapes that you put
in a Walkman) and a dot matrix printer whose grinding
and whining sounds would send the dog into fits.
The exposed mechanism and the routine service we
had to perform on that printer meant that it was very
clear how the printer worked. It simply pushed pins in a
specific sequence through an inked ribbon and onto the
paper. This simple mechanism was noisy and had a res
olution that was limited by the size of the pins in the
printer head. Although dot matrix printers are still in
occasional use for printing on carbon copy forms today,
for the most part, they have been replaced by more ele
gant laser printers.
So how does a laser printer produce such high quali
ty printing so quickly? I polled a group of my friends,
and 1 came up with answers like: "a high power laser
burns the image onto the paper" and "there are a few
really fast monkeys inside the printer that paint dots
wherever a laser points." Not convinced that my
friends' answers were the whole story. I decided to do
some research of my own.
Assuming that the process was some kind of patent
ed magic, 1 didn't think I'd find much. But it turns out
that laser printers are actually very simple. Here's how
they work:
Printing commands from the computer are transmit
ted to the printer in a language called Post Script. Fonts
or typefaces that are specified in the document are also
loaded into the printer's memory.
This data is then processed by the printer into light
signals and motion control signals for aiming light onto
the paper. This process is called raster image processing
or RlPing.
Then the true magic begins. A laser beam (or in
some cases an array of light emitting diodes) is aimed at
a rotating drum using a polygonal mirror. The beam
shines on the drum one dot at a time. The laser is on
where dots will appear and off where there will be white

space. The rotating drum is coated with a material with
a negative electrostatic charge, and its light sensitivity
causes it to change to a positive charge when the laser
shines on it.
Toner, a fine powder containing magnetic particles,
is drawn from the toner cartridge to another roller that
has a magnet inside it. This roller is in contact with the
rotating drum, and negatively charged toner particles
are attracted to the positively charged areas on the
drum as it and the roller rotate. This latent image on the
drum is now ready to be printed on paper.
The paper is pulled from the tray and passes between
the drum and a wire that is positively charged. The
charge on the wire attracts the negatively charged toner
particles away from the drum and onto the paper. At
this point the image is on the paper and is almost ready
to be in your hands.
Finally, the paper passes through two rollers that are
heated to about 150 degrees Celsius (302 degrees
Farenheit). This bonds and cures the toner to the paper
so it doesn't fall off when you pull it out of the printer.
It also explains why the paper is warm when it comes
out.
