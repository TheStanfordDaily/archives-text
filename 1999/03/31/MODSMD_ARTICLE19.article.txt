# Bacteria inspire new way to enhance drugs
## 
### Joanne Wu Editorial staff 
Bacteria, one of the most primi
tive organisms on earth, is powerful
enough to kill us, yet also resourceful
enough to teach us some medical
strategies.
In a recent discovery. Stanford
researchers have found that a tech
nique used by bacteria to destroy
other microorganisms can potential
ly be used to enhance the effective
ness and diminish the side effects of
many different drugs, especially
those used to treat immunosuppres
sion, anti-inflammation and hyper
tension. Their studies were pub
lished in the March 2 issue of Pro
ceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences.
In conventional drug develop
ment, the design of the drug itself,
which only contacts a small region of
the target protein, is manipulated in
an attempt to increase its affinity for
the target protein.
"Using the traditional approach
to make a drug, one starts with a lead
molecule and tinkers with the struc
ture to hopefully improve its binding
to the target protein." said Asst.
Chemistry Prof, and research team
member Tom Wandless. "This
approach doesn't sound very satisfy
ing, but it's been enormously suc
cessful — just look at the success of
the pharmaceutical industry. How
ever, our strategy presents another
way to achieve the same goal —
improved binding."
The new method incorporates
the special abilities of a unique
group of proteins that naturally
occur in the body, which the
researchers have named "presenting
proteins." A ligand can be used to
connect presenting proteins to the
drug, creating a much larger inter

face area that can complement the
target protein. This magnifies the
possibilities of contact. In this way,
the drug is attached much more
tightly to the target, enhancing its
effects on the target.
"Think of the drug molecule as a
pea and the proteins as mattresses.
Put a pea on a mattress [the target
protein] by itself and it doesn't have
much effect. But attach the pea to
another mattress [the presenting
protein] and put the two on the orig
inal mattress and they have a much
bigger impact," said Dr. Gerald
Crabtree, associate investigator at
the Howard Hughes Medical Institu
tion.
Also, this high affinity increases
specificity, since the drug with a pre
senting protein will be much less
likely to complement a non-target
cell of the body, which has a differ
ent shape. Thus, this new method
also decreases the chances of side
effects.
The idea of using presenting pro
teins as an enhancement for drugs
arose from the research of postdoc
toral fellow Roger Briesewitz, pri
mary author of the paper.
In his studies, Briesewitz discov
ered that alterations in shape which
influence complementarity between
a drug and its target occur in the
interface between the presenting
protein and the target protein, rather
than the expected change in shape
between the target and the drug
itself.
Thus, Briesewitz uncovered the
major role presenting proteins play
in improving a drug's interaction
with its target.
In nature, the soil bacteria
Cyclosporeae was clever enough to
use this presenting protein technique
to destroy microorganisms with
which it competed for resources and

space. Cyclosporeae produce a pep
tide called cyclosporin in conjunc
tion with a cellular protein called
cyclophilin, which works in a way
similar to the presenting proteins.
This cyclophilin-cyclosporin com
plex matches the shape of cal
cineurin, a protein found in microor
ganisms that is essential for main
taining the microorganisms' growth.
By releasing the cyclosporin
cyclophilin complex into its environ
ment, Cyclosporeae can prevent the
development of other competitive
microorganisms.
Crabtree explained the enhance
ment effect of cyclophilin: "There is
no native interaction between
cyclosporin and calcineurin, but
when presented by cyclophilin, there
is a million-fold increase in specifici
ty and affinity. This natural example
shows how good the presenting pro
teins can be, and I think we can
achieve something close to it."
"We have only seen a factor of
three [in increased affinity], but we
would like to think that nature has a
significant head start on us," Wand
less said.
Crabtree added, "For the target
we tested, we had a significant
increase in affinity — much higher
than anyone else has gotten before
in a protein-protein interaction, and
we don't know yet what the upper
limit will be."
Calcineurin is also present in
humans, where it helps activate T
cells which are responsible for reject
ing organ transplants. Therefore,
cyclosporin can be used not only by
bacteria to destroy other microbes
but may also be used by doctors to
prevent transplant rejections.
In future research, the group will
focus on several goals that will
enhance the understanding of pre
senting proteins.
