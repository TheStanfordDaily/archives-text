The Class of 2(XJ3 has been se
lected.
There are 2,205 lucky high
school students who will find a
thick package in their mailbox this
week, the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions reported yesterday. Of
17,917 total applicants, only 2,688,
including 483 Early Decision appli
cants, were offered spots in the
Class of 2(K)3.
"With a 15 percent admit rate,
this was another highly selective
year in the history of Stanford ad
mission," said Robert Kinnally,
dean of undergraduate admissions
and financial aid.
Last year, Stanford accepted

2,455 students for a 13 percent
admit rate and experienced a 12
percent increase in applications.
This year the total number of appli
cations decreased 5 percent.
Kinnally offered one theory for
the decrease: "It's a function of the
consolidation of the two rounds of
Early Decision. People who would
have applied Early Decision II did
three things: they migrated to the
first round, they applied to the reg
ular round or dropped out of the
application pool."
Kinnally, however, sees the
slight decrease in applicants in a
positive light, 'it was a great oppor
tunity to have a little more leeway

in the regular round."
According to Kinnally, there
aren't enough superlatives to de
scribe Stanford's newest class.
In what has become a tradition
al statistic to describe admitted
classes, s;iid Kinnally, a majority of
the students of the Class of 2003
boast a straight "A" record from
high school.
More than two-thirds of them
have above a 700 on both math and
verbal sections on the SAT.
"The class we have admitted is
among the most academically tal
ented on record, and they have dis
tinguished themselves in many
ways. As a group, these students
demonstrate remarkable intellec

tual energy and a profound love of
learning," Kinnally said.
The admitted students followed
a recent demographic trend: a de
clining number of students from
California.
Only 35 percent of the newest
admitted students come from Cali
fornia. compared with 37 percent
for the Class of 2002 and 44 percent
for the current undergraduate stu
dent body as a whole.
Other states with a high repre
sentation in the admitted class in
clude Texas (7.5 percent). New
York (4.1 percent) and Washing
ton (3.K percent).
The admitted class's ethnic and
cultural diversity remained consis
tent with recent years.
Kinnally adds, "As a group, they
are highly motivated and have al
ready made important contribu

tions to their schools and commu
nities. We were struck by their
commitment to research and their
genuine altruism.
"They will add much to life at
Stanford."
Admit Weekend takes place the
weekend of April 22 through 24.
Admitted students will have the
opportunity to visit the campus and
meet with faculty members and
students as in years past.
Despite sending out notification
letters today, the Office of Under
graduate Admissions takes no
break. The office is already plan
ning for next year's crop of appli
cants, Kinnally said.
"Right away we start travel
ling," he said. "While hosting
admit student receptions, we begin
to host meetings for high school ju
niors."
