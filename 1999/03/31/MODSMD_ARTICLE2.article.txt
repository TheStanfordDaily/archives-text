The Class of 2(XJ3 has been se
lected.
There are 2,205 lucky high
school students who will find a
thick package in their mailbox this
week, the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions reported yesterday. Of
17,917 total applicants, only 2,688,
including 483 Early Decision appli
cants, were offered spots in the
Class of 2(K)3.
"With a 15 percent admit rate,
this was another highly selective
year in the history of Stanford ad
mission," said Robert Kinnally,
dean of undergraduate admissions
and financial aid.
Last year, Stanford accepted

2,455 students for a 13 percent
admit rate and experienced a 12
percent increase in applications.
This year the total number of appli
cations decreased 5 percent.
Kinnally offered one theory for
the decrease: "It's a function of the
consolidation of the two rounds of
Early Decision. People who would
have applied Early Decision II did
three things: they migrated to the
first round, they applied to the reg
ular round or dropped out of the
application pool."
Kinnally, however, sees the
slight decrease in applicants in a
positive light, 'it was a great oppor
tunity to have a little more leeway
