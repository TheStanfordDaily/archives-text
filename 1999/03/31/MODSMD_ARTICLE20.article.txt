## Three depart; team loses talent as turmoil ensues Volleyball loses All-American Gardner 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
The persistent struggles oi the Stanford men's vol
leyball program were intensified over spring break by
the departure of three players from the lineup.
On Mareh 19, Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves
removed two players, junior All-American outside
hitter Gabe Gardner and junior outside hitter Robin
Lamb, from the team.
The next day, freshman outside hitter Larry Witt
left the gym during practice and has not yet rejoined
the squad.
The coaching staff decided that the presence of
Gardner and Lamb would affect the team's ability to
realize its goals for the remainder of the season.
"The team has been through a lot of turmoil this
season," Nieves said. "It reached a point where we
needed to start a new season and approach the season
with those players who would be fully sa'isfied with
the team concept and the goals of the program."
Although Nieves made a permanent decision to re
move Gardner and Lamb from the team, it is possible
that Witt could rejoin the team if he expresses this de
sire.
"When Larry walked out of the gym. he made his
decision in a very unique, high-stress situation and so
I would keep that in mind [if he wanted to change his
decision]," Nieves said.
At the start of the 1998-99 season, the Stanford
men's volleyball team was a bastion of experienced
talent at the outside hitter position. With two All-
Americans and eight other players with some experi
ence at that spot, it appeared that few schools could
rival Stanford's possible combinations of players at
this position.
After junior All-American Andy Witt's Feb. (-> de
cision to leave the team for "personal reasons," his ab
sence created the first void in the backbone of the
Stanford offense. The recent departures of these

three outside hitters further increases the season's
turmoil.
Gardner, a transfer student from USC, competed
•in his first season in a Cardinal uniform this year. De
spite being bothered by a stress fracture, Gardner has
established the fourth-highest kill average in the
NCAA.
Lamb, a transfer student from Vanderbilt, has rou
tinely entered matches off the bench at critical points.
Larry Witt recently switched from the setter to the
outside hitter position and showed promise in this
new role.
"I don't know how [the loss of these players] will affect
the team." said sophomore setter Josh Lukens. "We've
lost a lot of talent."
At this point, it is unclear if these changes have im
proved the team dynamics of the Cardinal, which has
just recently established a .500 overall record. Stan
ford earned three decisive victories without these
players last week, but the Cardinal competed against
two teams who have yet to earn an Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation victory.
"It was good that we had the three matches against
the San Diego schools to work out the kinks in the
new lineup." freshman outside hitter Marcus Skacel
said.
With only six regular season matches left, it re
mains to be seen whether the loss of this talent will af
fect the struggling Cardinal in any way.
The decision "created more respect for the coach
ing staff, but I think [the changes] could go both
ways," Skacel said.
Only if the entire team supports these changes will
they improve Stanford's team goal of reaching the
MPSF Championships. One player did express a be
lief that the entire team did not support Nieves' deci
sion. Tonight's game against the Pacific Tigers will be
a barometer of whether these changes have affected
the overall team performance of the 12 remaining
Cardinal players.
