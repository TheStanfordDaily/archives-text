# Playoff hopes on the line

### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
The individual career-best performances of some
members of the 15th-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team (8-8,6-8 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) was a
bit contagious last week.
In a March 24 matchup against the San Diego State
Aztecs, senior outside hitter Patrick Klein posted a per
sonal best in number of kills and earned a career high .423
hitting percentage despite having a 101 degree fever earli
er in the day. Three other Cardinal attackers, junior out
side hitter Josh Palacios, sophomore middle blocker Brett
Youngberg and freshman outside hitter Marcus Skacel,
also all earned personal bests in kills.
Last week's performance is the type of collective team
effort that the Cardinal must replicate to be successful

when it takes on a much more formidable opponent
tonight, the 12th-ranked Pacific Tigers (10-8, 7-7) at the
Spanos Sports Center in Stockton.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Today: No. 15 Stanford (8-8, 6-8 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) at No. 12 Pacific University (10-8, 7-
7), 7 p.m.

Stanford and Pacific are both at similar points in their
seasons. The two teams had comparable preparation last
week for tonights match: Pacific also defeated the Aztecs
and earned a 15-9,16-4,15-8 decision. Because both teams
are members of the Pacific Division of the MPSF, Pacific
and Stanford have faced the same opponents so far this
season. Pacific has wins over the top-ranked Long Beach
State 49ers and the lOth-ranked USC Trojans, two teams
who defeated the Cardinal handily earlier in the season.
The most significant similarity between the two teams
is that they are both trying to attain one of the last spots in
the MPSF Championships that begin on April 24th.
"Tonight's game will have a big bearing on which of
these teams will advance to the tournament," said Stan
ford head coach Ruben Nieves. "Most likely, one of us will
qualify."
Only the top three teams in each division, along with
the remaining two teams with the strongest records will
compete in the tournament. Pacific and USC are current
ly tied for third in the Pacific Division. Stanford, however,
is the closest challenger with one less conference win.
With only five conference games remaining on its sched
ule, the Cardinal must be more focused than ever to con
tinue into postseason competition.
"At this point, we don't know how many wins it will
take [to make it to the MPSF tournament]," Nieves said.
"Finishing with 11 wins should get us in, with 10 wins we
are a maybe, and with nine wins it's doubtful."
Stanford faces some obstacles in its pursuit for a per
fect record for the remainder of the season. Pacific has put
itself in a competitive position in the MPSF behind the at
tacking skills of outside hitter Tim Gerlach. As of March
17, Gerlach's .579 hitting percentage was an NCAA best.
Another factor in tonight's game will be Stanford's ability
to adjust to the departure of three Cardinal attackers, ju
nior All-American Gabe Gardner, junior Robin Lamb
and freshman Larrv Witt.
