# Junior sets new American record
## Fox leaves swim pack in her wake 
### Chad Morse Contributing writer 
Catherine Fox is standing behind
her starting block. Her competition,
seven lank women cast in the classic
backstroker's mold, are stretching
their long legs and arms. Common
sense would suggest that the Stan
ford junior does not belong among
this company, that hers-foot-5 frame
should have been naturally selected
against this type of race long ago.
The swimmers slide into water.
Alter a pause and a sterile beep, the
pool is suddenly alive with kinetic en
ergy. At 50 yards, the outcome of the
race has been decided. With power
ful strokes and seamless technique.
Fox has put herself nearly a body
length in front of her nearest com
petitor. Twenty-seven seconds later,
she powers into the wall and shoots a
quick glance at the clock. 52.47.
Smiles, hugs and a new American
record in the KX)-yard backstroke
greet her at the finish.
That was Friday morning, the sec
ond day of preliminary heats for the
1999 NCAA women's swimming and
diving championships. Fresh off her
third consecutive national title in the
50-yard freestyle on Thursday
evening, life was smiling on Cather
ine Fox.
But not even newly crowned
American record-holders are ex
empt from competing in finals. Seven
hours after her recording-setting per
formance, Catherine headed back to
Georgia's Gabrielsen Natatorium to
do it all over again. This time when
she eyed the clock after her race,
however, her look was one of shock
and disappointment. Despite record
ing the third-best time of her career,
she was touched out for the title by
California senior Marylyn Chiang.
"I was concentrating too much on
other swimmers during that race,"
Fox concedes. "My best races are
when I'm not thinking about anyone
else. In prelims. I was on. I was in my
mode."
The race came to exemplify the

Cardinal's NCAA struggle. Despite
an incredible team effort, Stanford
fell to a charged Georgia squad.
With a new American record and
two more national titles under her
belt (she now has eight). Fox is choos
ing to focus on the positives on the
Georgia meet. Her buoyant attitude
extends beyond the swimming deck,
however, as she basks in her days at
Stanford.
"I'm just really excited and happy
with my situation right now." Fox
says. "This team is an amazing group
of women. I absolutely love being a
part of them. I'm excited for the team
and everything to come. It's kind of
sad that I've only got a year left, but
the future looks good."
Last year was a different story for
Fox. Despite a team NCAA title and
two individual titles, nearly 12 yeartf
of swimming were starting to take*
their toll. *
"I was really struggling with swim
ming and a lot things last year.
Sophomore blues, I guess." she adds
with a laugh.
At the peak of her career. Fox
turned her back on swimming and
took a summer off, something she
hadn't done in years.
"I stayed in the area and worked.
It was great. I did some different
things. I did some message therapy,
which was fantastic. It was so nice to
have some time off."
By fall. Fox was rejuvenated. Her
passion for the sport regained its
strength and continues to do so.
"Swimming is an entirely different
sport." she says with a touch of rever
ence. "Now. I feel like I have a much
greater understanding of the water.
You definitely have to use the water
to your advantage and not the other
way around. And when your stroke is
right on. it's the greatest feeling."
Fox's stroke was definitely right
on at the Olympic trials in 1996. She
placed fifth in the 100-meter
freestyle, earning her a slot on the
400-meter freestyle relay. The
events that transpired in Atlanta a
few months later she will never for
get.
"It's the 1996 Olympics. I'm sit
ting with [Stanford alumna] Jenny
Thompson and Km just scared. I'm
the total rookie of the group. I'm
thinking to myself, 'There's no way
I'm going to be able to walk out that
door by myself.' I'm so glad the oth
ers were there, because I don't know
if I would have made it."
"So, 1 walked out that door. As
soon as they saw our USA warmups,
35-40,000 people stood up and
cheered. It was deafening. I was like
'Oh my gosh.."
Like the true competitor she is.
Fox used her frazzled nerves to her
advantage and swam her heart out.
Team USA cruised to victory and
Fox picked up one of two gold
medals that she brought home as
souvenirs. She was only 18 at the
time.
Although she doesn't have tens of
thousands of fans cheering for her at
every meet, she does have one that
catches almost all her races.
"I have two rats. Jack and Tom.
Jack's a boy, Tom is not," Fox says
matter-of-factly of her small com
panions. "They're like little dogs.
Tom's like me. She doesn't sit still.
She can crawl anywhere, jump any
where. ... She doesn't come on the
trips."
Jack, however, is a regular at
Stanford swim meets. When the
squad has to travel, he's often put
lovingly in his owner's pocket. Jack
even made the long journey to Geor
gia, where Stanford parents took
turns holding him throughout the
competition.
With her graceful technique, blaz
ing speed and easy demeanor. Fox is
sure to win many more races and
friendships in her remaining year at
Stanford. Keep an eye out for her in
the future. You might even catch a
glimpse of Jack perched high in the
stands.
