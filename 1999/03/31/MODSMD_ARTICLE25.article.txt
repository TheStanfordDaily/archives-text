# Polo readies for Guachos
## 
### Mo Eger 
Undefeated in league, the No. 2
women's water polo team (14-2, 7-0
MPSF) will try to maintain its record
at 4 p.m. today in a home game
against the No. 12 UC-Santa Barbara
Gauchos (7-9,1-4).
As the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championship nears
(April 9-10), each league game is cru
cial not only for seeding in the up
coming tournament but for improv
ing upon specific offenses and defens
es in a game situation. The Cardinal
faced the Gauchos in early February
in its second game of the season at the
UC-San Diego Arena Invitational
(Feb. 13) winning 6-1. Still, February
is a long time passed and both teams
have developed and improved over
these last two months.
Similar to the Cardinal offense,
the (iauchos have a number of strong
players who can score from the two

meter position. There are four play
ers who could pose problems in terms
of matchups. Fortunately, the Stan
ford team has many versatile players
that can handle themselves if dragged
unexpectedly into hole-set. Hole de
fenders senior Nicole Glazer and
sophomores Anne-Marie Keenan
and Hillary Gallogly will he expected
to keep tabs on these potential
threats.
The Gauchos play "good team de
fense and are able to keep games
close," said head coach John Tanner.
"They also have a strong goalie. We'll
need to be efficient with our scoring
opportunities to win this game."
The Gaucho team is quick and has
good movement on both offense and
defense, so the Cardinal will look to
respond with plenty of strong drives
and counterattacks of its own. Stan
ford is incredibly fast and this will be
an area where the Cardinal should
pose a threat for the Gauchos. Speed

from freshman Margie Dingeldein
and junior Elissa Keszler should cre
ate a number of scoring opportunities
for the Cardinal.
While Tanner believes that every
thing looks pretty good going into
this game, he admits that the team
might be too concerned with Satur
day's game against No. 1 USC. That
game is "the big showdown before
the MPSF championship," Tanner
said.
Therefore the Cardinal's main
challenge will be to not look too far
ahead to this weekend and to play
with concentration, intensity and skill
to beat UC-Santa Barbara today.
"It is important for us mentally to
come out strong and play hard in
every game," said senior captain
Lindsay Tam. "Yes, we are looking
towards USC but today is significant
as well. I think we play well on the
road but it is always cool to play be
fore a home crowd," Tam said.
