# Alleged prank caller may have used Stanford Web sites as info

Technological developments that im
prove people's lives often have risks as well.
The recent arrest of San Mateo resident
Simon Posada, allegedly the telephone ha
rasser "Oscar," revealed the sorts of dan
gers that can arise from posting personal in
formation on the Web.
Students often create Web sites to facili
tate access to their personal information by
friends and relatives, as well as potential

employers. Posada, however, allegedly used
Web site information to harass his victims.
Police discovered saved copies of students'
Web sites, which included personal infor
mation, on Posada's home computer.
Stanford police officer Allen James, the
arresting officer in the Posada case, stressed
the importance of being aware of the risks
taken upon creation of a Web site. "You
have to ask yourself a few basic questions
such as whether or not your provided infor
mation can put you in a risk, and whether
someone could use the information you are

providing in a negative
way. Then you have to
make an individual deci
sion."

Students who create Web sites often
choose to focus on the benefits that a Web
site affords. "The ability to have people who
are my friends share my life through the In
ternet is definitely worth the slight risk that
a stalker would use my Web page," said
freshman Elizabeth Aab. "I never felt that


Posada
having a Web site was putting me in
danger. Because honestly, who is
going to look at my Web site?"
Yet the incidence rates for differ
ent violations of computer security
have been increasing drastically in
recent years. Incidents of "hacking"
and other invasions of campus com
puters have risen from virtually
none in September 1995 to 240 in
March 1998. As a result, Stanford
designated April 1998 "Computer
Security Month" and tried to edu
cate students about the security
risks involved with computer tech
nology.
Some professors have also decid
ed that more education is necessary
on the topic of computer security.

Brad Osgood, director of the Sci
ence, Math and Engineering Core
and a professor for the SME: Light
track devotes one lecture to the issue
of "Keeping Information Secure"
before the students design and cre
ate their own personal Web pages.
"You can make a Web site, and
people do it all the time for courses,
but you can also protect it by making
it be available to only certain people
by having passwords. Then it's a
question of keeping the password se
cret — that is where encryption
comes in," said Osgood.
While Computer Science Prof.
Patrick Young required a Web site
formation as part of the curriculum
for CSIOS, it did not necessarily have
to be posted on the Internet. "We
could put our Web site on a disk and
give it to the professor so that only he
and the TAs would be the ones see

ing it," said freshman Anna Kirbv.
Personal Web sites, of course, are
not the only sources that can reveal
personal information. "There are
other ways that stalkers can access
information," said Aab.
James noted, "It is correct that
the information is out there. But pro
viding information through Web
sites increases your risk that some
one will get that information and use
it. People involved in the 'Oscar'
case, for example, will rethink their
Web site information."
SME: Light teaching assistant
Ton Sistos follows this advise by se
lecting only certain information for
his Web site. "Anything that I put on
my Web site is information that 1 feel
comfortable with being publicly
available," said Sistos, who will be
leading the SME Web site creation
project.
