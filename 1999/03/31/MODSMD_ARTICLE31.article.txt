# Foundations tackle kids' health care
## 
### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
The David and Lucile Packard
Foundations have recently ex
pressed interest in improving chil
dren's health care in the Bay Area
by considering the idea of present
ing UCSF Stanford Health Care
and its two affiliated medical
schools with money to improve
children's health care programs.
Both the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation and the Lucile
Packard Foundation for Children's
Health asked USHC to devise a
proposal to expand and develop
state-of-the-art pediatric care and
research programs.
Each of the four hospitals in the
USHC system — UCSF Medical
Center and UCSF Mount Zion in
San Francisco, the Stanford Med
ical Center and the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital in
Palo Alto — is being consulted by

officials at USHC in the develop
ment of a proposal to submit to the
foundations.
The proposal first will be given
to the Lucile Packard Foundation
for Children's Health, which will
decide if it is going to enter a
fundraising campaign with USHC.
The David and Lucile Packard
Foundation will then decide if it is
going to match the amount raised
from the fundraising campaign
with a grant.
The Lucile Packard Foundation
for Children's Health raises money
for the Children's Hospital. Its pur
pose is to identify and address the
leading health care needs of the
Bay Area's children.
"Our mission is to advance the
health status of children in North
ern California," said Stephen
Peeps, president of the Lucile
Packard Foundation for Children's
Health.
The Packard Foundation is a

separate organization and is the na
tion's third-largest nonprofit group
with an endowment of $9 billion.
Officials at the hospitals are in
the preliminary stages of creating
their wish lists. One of their ideas is
to build a children's hospital in San
Francisco. There has been no hos
pital devoted specifically to pedi
atrics in San Francisco since the
Children's Hospital merged with
the California Pacific Medical Cen
ter in 1991, making San Francisco
one of the few major cities in the
United States not to have a chil
dren's hospital.
"The facilities at UCSF are very
taxed and very crowded at present.
We need additional space, as well
as equipment and facilities de
signed with kids in mind," said
Larry Shapiro, chairman of pedi
atrics at UC-San Francisco.
The money would also be used
to finance a range of pediatric spe
cialties such as accidents and in

juries, asthma, birth defects, car
diac health, cancer, chronic illness,
mental health, neurobiology and
neurosurgery. Programs in these
areas could focus on basic research
as well as treatment and prevention
efforts,
"We would like to have a better
sense of how to influence the
health care of children in Northern
California," said Shapiro.
The money could be used to pay
for 20 additional endowed faculty
members at the medical schools of
UC-San Francisco and Stanford.
Lucile Packard Foundation offi
cials expect the proposals from the
hospitals to be submitted to them
by the end of the year because they
hold their last board meeting in
December. This is when they will
decide whether or not to coordi
nate a fundraising campaign with
USHC. The decision would be
made by the end of the calendar
year.
