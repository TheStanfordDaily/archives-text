# County revamps planning process
## Board decides to add 'community plan' to current general use permit 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
The next generation of Stanford
development will be governed by a
thorough "community plan," in addi
tion to a general use permit, the
Santa Clara County Board of Super
visors decided yesterday.
The board also defined the
process that will develop the new
general use permit and community
plan over the next 18 months to two
years, establishing a "Community
Resource Group" of 12 to 16 local
citizens to advise county planners on
Stanford land-use issues.
"The general use permit will be
used to implement the policies in the
community plan," said Santa Clara
County Supervisor Joe Simitian. The
new community plan "will provide
greater clarity and specificity than
with only a general use permit" in re
gards to future development, open
space and mitigation.
"But many of the hard decisions
are yet to come," he said.
According to Larry Horton, Uni
versity director of community and
government relations, "We will try to
make the new arrangement tailored
to meet the needs of the University,
taking community views into ac
count. We can do that and still be
good neighbors."
. Denice Dade, Santa Clara Coun
ty legislative advocate for the Com
mittee for Green Foothills, criticized
the county for allowing Stanford to
draft its own plan for approval by the
county, saying that the arrangement
"compromises objectivity." The
group feels that an independent con
sultant should draft the plan.
Horton noted that "there are very
few entities in the entire state that can
be compared to Stanford," in terms
of large non-profit private landown

ers. Most large private landowners
have similar arrangements, he said.
The committee is "optimistic, but
tentative" about the process.
"We asked for more clarity early
on" in terms of direction from the
Board of Supervisors, Dade said,
"but there's a mechanism in place
that can be used to create good plan
ning."
All sides agreed that final docu
ments should include conservation of
open space.
Since 1%2, Stanford develop
ment has been governed by one of a
succession of general use permits, ac
cording to Simitian. The permit pro
vides a cap on building square
footage, parking spaces, and other
development on the Stanford central
campus and sharply restricts devel
opment in the foothills. But it allows
Stanford considerable leeway for de
velopment within those constraints.
The new community plan will be
written to "achieve a zoning level of
specificity in designating land uses on
the campus," according to a county
planning memo. For example, the
designation of "University Lands-
Campus" in the current use permit
may be broken down into designa
tions for academic buildings, student
residences, single family housing and
other uses.
The community plan will not in
clude specifics included in full zoning
regulations, such as property-line set
backs and density restrictions. The
plan will address housing, traffic,
noise and safety, as well as open
space'.
The approved process also calls
for "regional cooperation" on the
plan from the Cities of Palo Alto and
Menlo Park, the Towns of Woodside
and Portola Valley and San Mateo
County, the other governments with
jurisdiction over Stanford lands.
