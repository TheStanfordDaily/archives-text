# UCSF-Stanford Health to lay off 2,000 workers
## 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
In response to a first quarter operating
loss of $10.7 million and prospects of contin
uing budgetary shortfalls, UCSF-Stanford
Health Care announced a plan Monday to
eliminate 2,(KK) jobs.
Cutbacks will be made in two rounds. In
the first round 1,250 positions will be elimi
nated and 725 positions will be eliminated in
the second. All cuts will be completed by late
August. As many as 800 workers will be laid
off, while other positions will be eliminated
through attrition.
The reductions in workforce are part of
USHC's plan to trim $170 million from its
operating budget and reach a balanced bud

get by the beginning of the 2(HM) fiscal year.
Administrative employees will be most
directly affected by the layoffs. I'SHC plans
to cut 40 percent of employees in central ad
ministrative services. Hospital support staff
will be cut by 28 percent.
Lassiter said that the reductions should
not dramatically affect the quality of patient
care. Doctors will not be affected, and Las
siter said "in the first set of reductions there
is no need to layoff nurses" — provided that
nurses are willing to be reassigned or receive
new shifts.
The current plan calls for a 9 percent re
duction in the number of employees who
provide direct patient care. The number of

employees who provide diagnostic
services, such as lab technicians,
will he cut by K percent.
Harry Adams, chief negotiator
lor the Service Employees Interna
tional Union, Local 715 disagreed.
Adams told the Palo Alto Daily,
"the layoffs will have a significant
impact on the quality of care and
patient services and no one can
dress it up and say it doesn't."
The elimination in positions
should lower the employee-per-oc
cupied-bed ratio at I )SHC' to levels
comparable to those at other hospi
tals. Prior to cutbacks at IJSI l( \ the
ratio was IV. IJSHC spokesman
Mike Lassiter said that IJSHC is
now targeting a ratio of 6.5 employ
ees per occupied bed.
IJSHC attributes the budget
shortfall to decreasing governmen
tal reimbursement for Medi-Cal
and Medicare patients in addition

to rising drug and supply costs.
IJSHC finances are further
strained by the low rates paid by
HMOs.
In a press release, Peter Van
Etten, the chief executive officer of
IJSHC, said that the one-year-old
merger of UC-San Francisco and
Stanford hospitals did not con
tribute to the budget shortfall and
the need for layoffs.
Van Etten said the merger actu
ally saved jobs.
"The merger of UCSF and Stan
ford hospitals," Van Etten said,
"affords us the ability to make sig
nificant infrastructure cuts that will
shield against larger reductions in
patient care service areas than
would have otherwise been neces
sary."
The total cuts of $170 million in
IJSHC's budget will be made
through workforce reductions of
$112 million. An additional $58
million will be saved by reducing
drug and supply costs and through
other cost-cutting measures.
