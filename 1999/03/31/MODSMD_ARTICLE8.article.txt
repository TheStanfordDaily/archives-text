FOR THE RECORD
An article in yesterday's Daily mistakenly said that "when main
tenance staff reported evidence of bulimia in Suites, a resident
assistant sent residents a mass e-mail." No such e-mail was sent.
In fact, Lisa Webb, residence dean for the suites, wrote a letter
that was distributed by RAs to each Suite. The Daily regrets the
error
