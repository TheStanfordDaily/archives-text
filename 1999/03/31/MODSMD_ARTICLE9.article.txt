Nuclear facilities not secure
WASHINGTON (AP) — Three of the
government's 12 nuclear weapons facilities,
including the weapons laboratory at Los
Alamos, received a less than satisfactory
security rating for last year, the Energy
Department disclosed yesterday.
A report sent to Congress said the Los
Alamos National Laboratory, the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
and a department transportation facility
continued to demonstrate shortcomings in
security.
The three facilities received a
"marginal" security evaluation as opposed
to "satisfactory" for the other nine facili
ties, according to the report, which was
released after classified portions were
deleted.
Los Alamos has been the focus of a
three-year espionage investigation stem
ming from concerns that top-secret war
head material at the facility may have fall
en into Chinese hands during the 1980s.
The report to Congress also expressed
concern about the difficulty of protecting
secrets in an era of the Internet. New
guidelines are being developed to evaluate
the impact on security because of the
"voluminous" data available through "the
vast array of ... DOE Web sites," the
report said.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said
he planned to use an extra $8 million he has
requested from Congress for security to
create better "fire walls" and intrusion
detection devices in the department's clas
sified and unclassified computer systems.
In releasing the unclassified version of
the report, Richardson said that while a
"marginal" rating indicates some security
shortcomings, nuclear materials and sensi
tive information continue to be protected.
"The report projects that all facilities
will reach an overall satisfactory rating in
1999 if the present corrective actions
already underway continue.

Computer virus spreads
NEW YORK (AP) —Several muta
tions of the fast-moving computer virus
called Melissa surfaced yesterday.
But researchers said none of these new
forms seems to be as effective as the origi
nal in clogging e-mail systems.
And an executive of a small software
company in Cambridge, Mass., said he had
found clues linking the virus to a still
unidentified writer who uses the computer
handle "VicodinES."
Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap
Software, a firm that makes operating sys
tems and software tools, said he thinks the
virus writer distributed it using an account
stolen from America Online 15 months
ago.
Melissa showed up last Friday and
spread rapidly around the world on Mon
day like a malicious chain letter.
It caused affected computers to fire off
dozens of infected e-mail messages to
friends and colleagues and swamped e-mail
systems.
While there have been no reports of
permanent damage from the virus, it dis
rupted the operations of thousands of com
panies and government agencies whose
employees were temporarily unable to con
duct business through e-mail communica
tion.
The virus arrives to its victims disguised
as an e-mail from a friend, with a note in
the subject line saying that an important
document is attached.
The attachment is a document in
Microsoft's Word format that lists Internet
pornography sites.
Once the user opens that file, the virus
digs into the user's address book and sends
infected documents to the first 50 address
es.
The danger of all the Melissa variants is
that virus writers will find them on the
Internet, correct the bugs and distribute
them further.
