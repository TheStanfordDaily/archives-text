"Lydia, I am to you, as a sparrow adoring the sky;
Lydia, you arc as the moon reflecting upon the water, which is my soul;
Lydia, you are the queen of queens of beauty, the Empress of my love,
and you preside over the splendidness of my feelings for you,
like the morning sun on the most glorious day
of the most beautiful and splendid season, which is love ...
"Raul Espana to his future wile on the night he proposed marriage, 1949,
from Empress of the Splendid Season
