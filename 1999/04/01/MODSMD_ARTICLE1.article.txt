# Farm bids farewell to Montgomery
## Why, God, why? 
### 
When Mike Montgomery came
to Stanford, people told him he
wouldn't he able to win at this
school.
All of a sudden winning at Stan
ford looks as easy as winning an
NBA title with Michael Jordan on
vour team.

CJood luck Monty, you just trad
ed your boulder in for and even
bigger one, and this hill's a lot
steeper. Start pushing.
I lie NBA's version of Wile E.
Coyote known more commonly
as the Los Angeles Clippers — just
took away the best thing about
Stanford basketball.
I'm not too worried about us.
mind you. Montgomery has built a
great program here. I'm confident
that the tradition will continue.
Hut I grew up in Los Angeles. I
know the evils that the Clippers are
capable of.
They're a lot like Lennv from

"Of Mice and Men." Lenny let his
affection for pet rabbits go over
hoard, eventually breaking their
necks.
The Clippers often get overex
cited with promising new players,
eventually breaking their spirits,
their games, their will to play ...
Monty's a sitting duck.
He wants a challenge? He just
got the world's biggest jigsaw puz
zle. and no one's bothered to tell
him that no two pieces will ever fit
together.
I'd say he just stepped onto the
deck of the Titanic, but at least the
Titanic was a pretty good thing be
fore the iceberg got in its way.
I 'd like to believe he can turn the
Clippers around, finally make them
a winning team. He's got the abili
ty. but if you're involved in profes
sional basketball in Los Angeles
and you don't work for the Lakers,
you're pretty much nailing your
fool to the floor before the race
even starts.
I could just imagine how excited
Stanford players must have been
when they heard they might gel a
chance to play for Montgomery
again. After hearing who he's with,
they must be avoiding him like they
owe him money.
