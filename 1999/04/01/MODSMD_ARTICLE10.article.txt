Herbert Hoover, the 31st Pres
ident of the United States and a
millionaire businessman, failed his
first entrance exam to Stanford.
But that didn't stop him from
coming back.
The University's only alumnus
to reach the White House took the
exam again and returned in time
to be part of Stanford's first four
year class, the "Pioneers" of 1895.
In the next 73 years, Hoover made
his way from class treasurer to
Secretary of Commerce for Presi
dents Harding and Coolidge and
succeeded the latter as president.
From when he first lived at

Encina Hull until his death in
1%4, he privately funded the edu
cations of a few Stanford students
and donated hundreds of thou
sands of dollars in money and
books to his alma mater, which he
once called "the best place in the
world."
The quiet student who rarely
spoke, according to his peers, was
actually determined and hard
working. Raised as an orphan who
struggled to meet payments, the
future president would deliver
laundry, do janitorial work and
clean up after horses to make his
way through school.
"There were some wild guvs in
the first Stanford four-year class."
but Hoover wasn't one of them,
said Cissie Dorc Hill. Exhibits ( o
ordinator at the Hoover Institu
tion. "You can contrast Hoover
because he was so hard-working.
He did not fit into that part of the

college environment at all."
Despite his reserved nature.
Hoover's ingenious money-mak
ing schemes paid off. He graduat
ed with a degree in geology, did
engineering and surveying work in
Australia and China and was a di
rector of 18 mining and financial
companies.
Grateful to Stanford for his
success, he made plans to build a
student union and helped create
the Food Research Institute, sup
ported the Graduate School of
Business and the Stanford Med
ical School when they were still
forming their foundations and be
came a member of the Stanford
Board of Trustees. He invested so
much effort and money for the stu
dents because, he said to them,
"the future of men will be in your
hands."

Hoover focused many of his ef
forts on young people. During
World Wars 1 and 11. he worked to
save starving families, especially
young children, in Europe.
As the head of the United States
Food Administration, he rallied
the nation to go through "meatless
days" so starving children in the
war-torn Belgium and Russia
could eat.
Even when the United States
struggled through the Great De
pression, Hoover maintained an
optimistic attitude with a leader
ship style that was blunt and even
tactless, but always in control.
"He acquired the habit of com
mand," said History Prof. David
Kennedy. "I le was used to being an
authority, being listened to, giving

orders and having them carried
out. He was an extremely success
ful businessman, was one of the
two most powerful Cabinet mem
bers, then became President of the
United States. Life taught him to
have confidence in himself."
During his career, Hoover
showed great confidence in Stan
ford. Anonymously donating
money even before he became a
millionaire. Hoover continually re
turned to the campus, building the
home on San Juan Hill that is still
the University president's resi
dence. and launching his 192K pres
idential campaign from there.
"He was always trying to make
the place bigger and better,"
Kennedy said.
"I think he understood probably
with greater clarity than any
[other] people did that this place
had the potential to become a great
university."
