in the past century. Stories will be

Herbert Hoover, the 31st Pres
ident of the United States and a
millionaire businessman, failed his
first entrance exam to Stanford.
But that didn't stop him from
coming back.
The University's only alumnus
to reach the White House took the
exam again and returned in time
to be part of Stanford's first four
year class, the "Pioneers" of 1895.
In the next 73 years, Hoover made
his way from class treasurer to
Secretary of Commerce for Presi
dents Harding and Coolidge and
succeeded the latter as president.
From when he first lived at

Encina Hull until his death in
1%4, he privately funded the edu
cations of a few Stanford students
and donated hundreds of thou
sands of dollars in money and
books to his alma mater, which he
once called "the best place in the
world."
The quiet student who rarely
spoke, according to his peers, was
actually determined and hard
working. Raised as an orphan who
struggled to meet payments, the
future president would deliver
laundry, do janitorial work and
clean up after horses to make his
way through school.
"There were some wild guvs in
the first Stanford four-year class."
but Hoover wasn't one of them,
said Cissie Dorc Hill. Exhibits ( o
ordinator at the Hoover Institu
tion. "You can contrast Hoover
because he was so hard-working.
He did not fit into that part of the

college environment at all."
Despite his reserved nature.
Hoover's ingenious money-mak
ing schemes paid off. He graduat
ed with a degree in geology, did
engineering and surveying work in
Australia and China and was a di
rector of 18 mining and financial
companies.
Grateful to Stanford for his
success, he made plans to build a
student union and helped create
the Food Research Institute, sup
ported the Graduate School of
Business and the Stanford Med
ical School when they were still
forming their foundations and be
came a member of the Stanford
Board of Trustees. He invested so
much effort and money for the stu
dents because, he said to them,
"the future of men will be in your
hands."
