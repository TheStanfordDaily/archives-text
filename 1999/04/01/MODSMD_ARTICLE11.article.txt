# Science across the lines
## New lab aimed at interdisciplinary biology research 
### Josephine Lau 
Throughout the scientific world,
the major trend at the moment is to
ward interdisciplinary work, and
Stanford is hoping to enlist its physi
cists. chemists and engineers in re
search on biological systems in a new
initiative known as Project Bio X.
The plan is for a 2(X),(KX)-square
foot lab in which 50 Stanford scien
tists would work.
The future envisioned for Project
Bio X lies far beyond that of an ordi
nary lab: proponents believe that it
will change the way science is done.
This initiative will allow professors of
different disciplines who might other
wise never even meet to exchange
ideas about their work.

Physics Prof. Steven Chu. a Nobel
laureate, said that his best work grew
out of "accidental interactions" —
from chance lunchtime conversations
with science students of other depart
ments to random lab seating arrange
ments — which have all influenced
the direction and progress of his re
search.
At these crossroads of science,
physicists and computer scientists
might collaborate to devise a ma

chine mimicking the human mind.
Biologists might be helped by their
colleagues in computer science in
handling data for the Human
Genome Project. Engineers and
physicians might create new imaging
equipment and improved sensors in
cooperation.
Chu and Biochemistry Prof.
James Spudich. two of the program's
major proponents, have themselves
been crossing disciplines for more
than a decade. Chu gained from Spu
dich and other biochemists the
knowledge he needed to investigate
the physical properties of DN A poly
mers. Spudich. meanwhile, learned
from Chu the physics he required to
understand the mechanics of the mo
torlike molecules behind muscle con
tractions.
According to Chu. therefore, in
terdisciplinary collaboration is al
ready occurring, but. like that be
tween Spudich and himself, has re
mained largely scattered and is the
product of personal initiative.
"You seek out people in other
fields because thev possess specific
knowledge that you need for your re
search." said Chu.
He hopes that Project Bio X will
facilitate and increase the number of
these often fruitful collaborations. In
C 'hu's opinion, more and more scien
tists are becoming interested in inter
disciplinary research as the fields of
biology, medicine, physics and engi
neering increasingly overlap. He
foresees that the initiative will bring
together scientists already working in
this new "interphase."
"Maybe a new field of science will
emerge from this project." Chu said.

Chu also sees the benefits of this
research diffusing to the students of
Stanford through possible research
opportunities, seminars and classes.
He believes that when students get
involved with Project Bio X, it will
open their eyes to what they would
not normally have exposure to in tra
ditional disciplines.
Chu and Spudich began discussing
the creation of an interdisciplinary
program with their colleagues a year
ago. Last July, they approached
Dean of Research Charles Kruger
and other administrators with the
possibility of establishing a formal
laboratory. A planning committee
has been working at weekly meetings
ever since to turn this into a reality.
Details regarding Project Bio X. such
as its costs and where its building w ill
be located, remain to be worked out,
although fundraising for the project is
anticipated to start soon.
As a measure of his enthusiasm
for the project, Kruger compared it to
the development of "radio electron
ics" by Frederick Terman, who was
dean of engineering in the years after
World War 11. Terman's work built
the foundation for Silicon Valley and
helped exalt Stanford's prestige.
Chu said that the crossing of scien
tific disciplines is not a mere "whim of
fashion," but will remain an influen
tial trend in scientific development.
Of the future of the project itself, Chu
said, "1 hope it will last forever."
