# Science across the lines
## New lab aimed at interdisciplinary biology research 
### Josephine Lau 
Throughout the scientific world,
the major trend at the moment is to
ward interdisciplinary work, and
Stanford is hoping to enlist its physi
cists. chemists and engineers in re
search on biological systems in a new
initiative known as Project Bio X.
The plan is for a 2(X),(KX)-square
foot lab in which 50 Stanford scien
tists would work.
The future envisioned for Project
Bio X lies far beyond that of an ordi
nary lab: proponents believe that it
will change the way science is done.
This initiative will allow professors of
different disciplines who might other
wise never even meet to exchange
ideas about their work.

Physics Prof. Steven Chu. a Nobel
laureate, said that his best work grew
out of "accidental interactions" —
from chance lunchtime conversations
with science students of other depart
ments to random lab seating arrange
ments — which have all influenced
the direction and progress of his re
search.
At these crossroads of science,
physicists and computer scientists
might collaborate to devise a ma

chine mimicking the human mind.
Biologists might be helped by their
colleagues in computer science in
handling data for the Human
Genome Project. Engineers and
physicians might create new imaging
equipment and improved sensors in
cooperation.
