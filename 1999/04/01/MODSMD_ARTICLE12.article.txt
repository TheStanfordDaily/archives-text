# Feds help in hacker case
## Physics computers targeted 
### Corinne Yates Contributing writer 
The Stanford Police recently combined efforts with
the FBI in an attempt to catch a hacker who has been
breaking into University machines.
According to the Palo Alto Daily News, the suspect,
whom authorities believe is located in Southern Califor
nia, has, as of March 18, broken into at least eight dif
ferent University machines, including one at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center and another at the High
Energy Physics Laboratory.
The story also said that "campus authorities" have
been monitoring the hacker and have removed all sensi
tive data from his or her reach, although fixing the secu
rity leaks used in this case has cost Stanford around
$1 (),()()().
Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy said that Stanford's
decision to talk to the FBI does
not in itself make the case par
ticularly serious.
"We went to the FBI because
they have a lot of expertise in
the area of computer crime,"
Bandy explained.
He also emphasized that the
FBI has superior resources and
a different set of rules than
those under which local investi
gations operate.
Bandy refused to release any
more detailed information
while the investigation remains
active.
Stephen Hansen from the
campus computer security of
fice refused to comment upon or
even confirm the existence of
investigation.
