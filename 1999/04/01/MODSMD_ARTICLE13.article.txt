Next week, Palo Alto police will begin issuing $55 tick
ets to pedestrians caught committing traffic violations in
downtown Palo Alto.
Traffic safety has long been a priority for members of
the Palo Alto City Council, according to Sgt. Doug Keith,
but it is only recently that they have decided to focus specif
ically on the subject of pedestrian safety and violations.
Given this new emphasis, city police conducted a three
hour study of traffic in the downtown area on University
Avenue where most of the accidents involving pedestrians
occur. Keith did not have exact figures about the accident
rate.
The traffic survey was an attempt to deduce whether
the high incidence of accidents was a result of engineering,
including such items as poorly timed lights and unclear
traffic signs, vehicular violations or pedestrian violations.
The study established that engineering was not part of
the problem. Instead, officers observed about 275 pedes
trian violations in the three hours, including walking
against red lights and mid-block jaywalking, which in
creased the potential for accidents substantially.
In response, police began issuing warnings and distrib
uting brochures to educate Palo Alto pedestrians about
the danger of their actions and the likelihood that such ac
tions would result in tickets in the future. In addition, po
lice contacted local media to inform residents of the prob
lem and newly implemented solution.
Regarding proper engineering and education, Keith
said "if those two things don't work, then we follow up with
enforcement."
Despite their willingness to enforce the laws governing
