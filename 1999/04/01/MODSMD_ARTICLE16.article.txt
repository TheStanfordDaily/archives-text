# Field trip to the Promised Land
## Geophysics students study earthquakes and ruins in Israel

Students in Geophysics S()Q study
earthquakes, and Stanford is usually
a fine place to study earthquakes up
close. Hut since this sophomore sem
inar focuses on earthquakes' effect
on ancient ruins, the students had to
go a little further: all the way to Israel
and Jordan this Spring Break on a
field trip.
The seminar, taught by Geo
physics Prof. Amos Nur, consisted of
two parts: live two-hour lectures dur
ing winter quarter and the field trip
from March 17 to 2K.
"The goal [of the trip] was to pro-
Vide a field experience to illustrate
the material covered in the seminar,"
iiid Charles Junkerman, associate
cjean of continuing studies and sum
mer session.

According to sophomore Sarah
Meyer, the trip did just that.
"It was amazing," she said. "In
class we talked about the sites we'd
be visiting, and then we visited them.
A few of the sites the professor hadn't
even been to before, and so we were
actually looking for evidence of
earthquakes for the first time —
cracks in walls and fallen columns."
Nur said the group "visited about
a do/en sites where earthquakes, ar
chaeology and history are combined
in an interesting way. We explored
around and looked around for evi
dence of earthquakes."
The focus of the class was deter
mining why so many archaeological
ruins exist in the Eastern Mediter
ranean and whether or not these
ruins might be due to historic and
prehistoric earthquakes.
First, the class flew to Tel Aviv
and then spent a few nights in

Jerusalem, according to Dean of
Earth Sciences Franklin Orr. Then
they left for a site along the Dead Sea
and then for Jericho. The class also
visited the ruined city of Fetra, in Jor
dan, where one of the "Indiana Jones
and the Lxist Crusade" scenes was
filmed.
"Fetra was my favorite place,"
Meyer said. "It's an ancient city built
under red cliffs. It was very mysteri
ous, and the most exotic [of the places
visited], sort of unearthly."
Sophomore Sarah Trainer said
that the trip combined intellectual ex
perience with fun.
"This was a wonderful opportuni
ty," she said. "It turned out to be a
great group of people and it was great
to see all of the places."
Sophomore Alison Iwerks
agreed.
"We went to so many different
places," she said. "It was great. In

classes, you usually learn a lot but you
don't get to actually see what you're
learning except in pictures and such."
The group consisted of 15 under
graduates, two teaching assistants,
Nur, Orr, Junkerman and Helen
Bing, a private donor who funded
much of the trip.
In addition to the private dona
tions, the Continuing Studies and the
School of Earth Sciences contributed
some funds. Also, students each had
to put in $400 of their own money.
Some of the students in the group
are considering majors in geology
and related fields, while others ex
pressed more of a personal interest.
Junkerman, who called the expe
rience "one of the most remarkable
trips I've ever been on," said that
much of the success of the trip was
due to the dedication of both Nur and
the students in the seminar.
"In my mind what characterized
the trip more than field research was
teaching," he said. "There was teach
ing everywhere we could huddle to
gether — on top of Mt. Nebo where
Moses saw the Promised Land, under
an arch in the aqueduct that Herod
built across the beach to his coastal
capital, Caesarea, and in the moun
tains on the border of Lebanon."
Orr said that the group dynamics
were essential to the trip.
"1 think the students were having
just as much fun as I," he said. "I real
ly appreciated their enthusiasm.
These kids were up and had breakfast
and were ready to go by 6:30 in the
morning, hours that they'd never
even heard of before."
It is possible that the seminar
and the opportunity to go to the East
ern Mediterranean — will be offered
again in the future, Orr said.
"I think it's very likely," he said,
"although we'll always have prob
lems with how we're going to support
it all. But it was very successful, and
it's definitely something that will be
considered."

the geophysics seminar visited Susita, an archaelogical site in Israel during their spring break travels.
The fallen columns at Susita are evidence of earthquake damage, which the seminar was focused on.
