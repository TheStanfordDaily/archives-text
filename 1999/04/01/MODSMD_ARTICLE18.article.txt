## Four police officers may get 25 years in prison for Diallo shooting NY cops charged 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Four
white police officers were charged
with murder yesterday for killing an
unarmed African immigrant in a
hail of 41 bullets — a shooting that
has led to months of protests and a
painful examination of police tactics
and race relations.
Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean
Carroll. Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy pleaded innocent
in a Bronx courtroom to second
degree murder. They could get 25
years to life in prison on the murder
charges.
Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old
street vendor from Guinea with no
criminal record, was shot 19 times
Feh. 4 in his vestibule by members
of an elite street-crime unit looking
for a rape suspect. Through their
lawyers, the officers have said they
thought Diallo had a gun.
The slaying has frayed Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's already strained
relationship with the black commu
nity, and many have accused him of
failing to understand the depth of
New Yorkers' anger.
Giuliani said yesterday: "We
should allow the criminal justice
system to now operate."
Judge John P. Collins set bail at

$1 ()(),()()() for each officer, even
though District Attorney Robert
Johnson had asked that they be
held without bail. The officers left
the courthouse together shortly
after the arraignment.
Johnson told the judge: "On
Feb. 4 in the vestibule in his own
building. Amadou Diallo stood
blameless, unarmed and defense
less when 19 of 41 shots were fired
at him, struck him and killed him.
... These four defendants intended
to take his life."
The officers were immediately
suspended from their jobs.
Marvyn Romberg, Carroll's
lawyer, called the intentional mur
der count "ludicrous."
"What's the district attorney say
ing? That they had nothing to do
that night but roll up on an individ
ual and attempt to kill him because
he's black?" the lawyer asked.
In the two months since Diallo
was killed. 1,203 people have been
arrested in demonstrations over
Diallo's death, the alleged police
torture of 1 laitian immigrant Abner
Louiina in 1997 and the perception
that law-abiding minorities are rou
tinely humiliated by police stop
and-search tactics.
