# Airstrike costs concern Pentagon
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Prolonged and intense NATO airstrikes in
Yugoslavia could cost the United States billions of dollars, putting more
pressure on a $270 billion Pentagon budget already stretched thin unless
Congress provides new money.
Using the lour-day Operation Desert Fox in December in Iraq as a
guide, congressional and outside economists estimate the Pentagon could
spend several hundred million dollars a week over regular U.S. defense
costs.
NATO has said airstrikes could continue for weeks to degrade the
Yugoslav military's ability to attack independence-minded ethnic Albani
ans in Kosovo.
"The longer it goes on and as more aircraft are destroyed and as more
munitions are consumed, the costs are going to come up," said Steven Kosi
ak of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.
Most extra defense costs will come from replacing missiles launched and
bombs dropped on Serb military targets. The 7,300 U.S. troops and 210
warplanes there already are paid for.
Aircraft refueling and maintenance also drive costs above peacetime
training levels.
In the cases of Iraq and Yugoslavia, most airstrikes are conducted by
U.S. troops and aircraft already in the region with only some added air
power, so potential transportation costs for ships, troops, military gear and
weapons are not a big additional factor.
"The real budget question in the wake of an operation is how much do
you need to rebuild your stock of munitions," said Steve Daggett of the
Congressional Research Service.
Precision bombs come fairly cheap — about $40,(XX) each, mostly for the
laser guidance system attached to 500- to 2,000-pound iron "dumb bombs,"
Daggett said.
But Navy Tomahawk and Air Force cruise missiles can average $1 mil
lion apiece, which can raise the airstrike tally quickly since the Pentagon
uses the weapons more often these days because they can be fired from afar
without putting pilots at risk.
The Pentagon has put the extra cost of the cruise-missile strikes in Iraq
at $2(i() million, although outside analysts estimate the tab is closer to $S(X)
million.
Extra defense spending for NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia, which so far

have not relied as much on cruise missiles, will most likely be cheaper each
week than the four-day Iraqi operation, say congressional and independent
budget analysts.
In the first week of the NATO airstrikes alone, more than 100 sea- and
air-launched cruise missiles were used. In the same period, 400 NATO air
craft Hew more than 1,700 sorties.
Pentagon accountants could discount the munitions costs, however.
In Desert Fox, the Navy fired 330 Tomahawks, but assigned the extra
cost at just $123.8 million because there's no plan to replace them all. The
Navy has more than 2,(XM) Tomahawks. The Navy also spent $9.1 million on
laser-guided bombs.
The Air Force launched about 90 cruise missiles in Desert Fox, pegging
the price at $51.5 million.
