### Matt Frahmm Staff writer 
Dan Monson, the man who led Gonzaga's
men's basketball team to an unexpected run into
the NCAA Tournament's Elite Eight this year, is
the frontrunner to replace departing Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery, according to Athletic
Director Ted Leland.
"We feel that Dan Monson would be a great
asset to the Stanford athletic family," Leland said

in a statement released yesterday. "You can
never hope to replace the things Mike Mont
gomery has accomplished at this school, but I
think coach Monson has deinsonstrated his capa
bilities at Gonzaga."
In a suq->risc move, the ( ardinal is also looking
to Fresno State coach Jerry Tarktanian to possi
bly fill the void. Tarktanian is infamous for his
problems with NCAA violations both in his cur
rent position and in his stint at lINLV, where he
led the Running Rebels to the 199() national title.

Tarktanian "is the kind of man that knows
what it takes to win and is more than willing to do
it." Leland said.
The NCAA is already looking into possible
recruiting infractions.
"It's not that any wrongdoing has gone on
yet." N( A A representative Matt Foley said. "It's
just with a man like Tarktanian. you want to get
the earliest possible jump on the paperwork."
