## Editorial SCBN's bad call 
### 
Dead Week decision
to show pornography
exhibited poor taste

BY NOW, MOST students and
faculty have become aware,
either directly or indirectly,
that the student-run SCBN aired
pornography between the hours of 2
a.m. and 6 a.m. on March 12, the Fri
day of Dead Week.
The decision to air television
material of this nature was a deci
sion made in poor taste and was a
serious error in judgement on the
part of SCBN managers.
There is a standard of appropri
ateness that must be maintained by
all organizations that have the
potential of reaching large groups of
people, particularly in an environ
ment such as Stanford.
The airing of pornography on the
student television network reflects
badly upon the University as a
whole.
Highly controversial and poten
tially inflamatory material such as
pornography carries with it the pos
sibility of relgiously, morally or
socially offending groups of stu
dents.
All students should be given
every opportunity to feel basically
comfortable in a center of academia
such as this.
According to Assistant Director
for Communication Services Mau
reen Trimm of Student Communica
tion Services, SCBN is accessible in
every academic and administrative
building on campus. It is also avail
able on the Row, in Escondido Vil
lage and in all student residences,
including Resident Fellow apart
ments, where children have access to
the channel.
Just because SCBN is a student
network or because it is in a closed

environment such as Stanford
doesn't give station personnel the
discretion to air whatever they
please.
The material was run at an hour
when the station was accepting stu
dent requests. Following student
demand for pornography, the station
obliged.
If students were to "request"
racist or prejudicial material, would
the station "oblige" them too? Is
there a line drawn between "appro
priate" and "inappropriate" televi
sion material for SCBN?
Does SCBN have pornography on
hand in the event that students
might ask for it, such as in this case?
There is a possibility that this
decision was made in an attempt to
garner increased student popularity
for the television network. It is
important to remind SCBN that if
that was the case, tactics such as this
have no place on the Stanford cam
pus.
In response to their actions, how
ever, station administrators have
expressed their apologies for their
actions.
Further, they have decided to
explore the adoption of guidelines to
aid in determining appropriate sta
tion material.
We strongly encourage the station
to continue its efforts at redeeming
itself in the eyes of the University
community. And there is nothing to
suggest that the station will ever air
similar programming again.
In the end, however, the final ver
dict remains the hands of students.
As the 1999 ASSU General Election
rapidly approaches, voters will soon
be able to make decisions regarding
whether to fund applying special-fee
groups.
SCBN will have to be ultimately
responsible for its actions in the eyes
of voters in the upcoming election
and beyond.
