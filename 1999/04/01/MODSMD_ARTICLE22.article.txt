Corporate bookstore debate continues

1 second Erik Campano's opinions in his
letter printed yesterday on the Stanford
Bookstore.
It is already a second-rate academic
bookstore, made even sadder by the fact
that it is the only option available. I still
make special trips to the University of
Chicago co-op bookstore, a knowledgeably
staffed store with an extremely deep selec
tion in most disciplines (perhaps University
President Gerhard Casper misses his Chica
go days for that reason). Harvard students
have any number of options. Berkeley stu
dents have Moe's and Cody's, among oth
ers. Pick the smallest college town in the
Midwest and you will invariably find a good
campus store and sonic great local book
shops.
Now Stanford will have its very own
Barnes & Noble, a glossy, faux-bookstore
with a shallow selection chosen by some
body at corporate headquarters. The conso

lation, I suppose, is that it will continue to
stock a world class selection of sweatshirts.

Erik Campano's tirade yesterday against
Barnes & Noble, the Stanford Bookstore
and the University its a whole was both dis
gusting and simple-minded.
To begin with, some people, in fact many
people, would enjoy a Barnes & Noble on
campus, because they offer different "non
intellectual" books. And although they may
be a for-profit organization, they often offer
selections at prices far less than our book
store.
Secondly, Campano complains about
how we are not like Harvard and Yale in the
organization of our Bookstore. Yes, we may
be different, but why is that so bad? I knOw
I personally came to this school exactly

because it wasn't Harvard or Yale. If you
really are this passionate about bookstores,
transfer as soon as possible.
I do agree that our bookstore's prices are
often inflated, yet blaming our administra
tion and firing off insult after insult is simply
low-class and disrespectful. Rather than
weak attacks, why not give personal sugges
tions directly to University President Ger
hard Casper?
Finally, (ampano's argument shows the
sign of a bitter student who loathes both his
school and, it seems, most things else that
are "non-academic." Don't you think that
maybe students at this school might like the
distractions that keep their minds off aca
demic rigor? We are not "anti-intellectual"
students in our decisions to forego discus
sions of Plato and quantum mechanics, we
are just humans enjoying human interac
tion.
So please, Erik Campano, when you find

flaws in the system, don't just throw attacks
in all directions. Look at all sides â€” aca
demic and non-academic, have a little
school pride and concentrate on building up
rather than just tearing down. If you want to
be surrounded by more "Kant translations,"
go hang out in Green library.

I read Erik Campano's letter and I want
ed to clarify something that he said. The fact
is that the Harvard bookstore (which is also
MlT's bookstore) is run by a division of
Barnes & Noble, that runs many college
bookstores. In fact, this is exactly the kind of
relationship that the Stanford Bookstore is
looking to secure.
