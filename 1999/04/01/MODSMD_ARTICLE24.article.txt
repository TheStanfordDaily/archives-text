# From the trenches
## I think we need to talk

AMONC'i Stanford
students, there are
conventional top
ics of conversation: the
Draw, classes, whom to
take to Screw Your Room
mate, dining hall offerings,
etc. Discussions of these

subjects are overheard at Tresidder, in
between classes, in dorm hallways. But these
topics, while important to our lives, are also
easy and safe.
But what about the more difficult sub
jects, the darker side of campus life, of our
campus life? Seemingly taboo, certain topics
are rarely broached. If they are mentioned,
they are only heard as whispers.
Depression never seems to be discussed
directly. Students talk around it. When a stu
dent notices that a friend has seemed partic
ularly down, he tends to chalk it up to that
difficult computer science program and the
recent lack of sunshine. And maybe, hope
fully, he is right.
But what if classes and weather cannot
explain away the despondent mood? It
seems like we have a hard time accepting
this possibility. Because the student, like all
of us, does not want to believe that a friend
might be seriously depressed, he is unlikely
to ask the friend whether his problems are
more serious than a passing bad mood. But
while these feelings are understandable,
they do not justify his. or our. silence.
Most students have heard of "Take Back
the Night" or have seen afterschool specials

about date rape. We may have read stories
about assaults at other college campuses.
But how many of us have discussed sexual
assault on our own campus? Yes, here at
Stanford. No one wants to believe that sexu
al assault could happen here. But simply
because we wish that it didn't happen does
not mean that we should deny its existence.
Recently, I heard the story of a student
who was embarrassed that she had sex with
someone and intimated to friends that she
was raped. Lying about rape is appalling. In
actuality, she didn't lie about the rape; the
"story" was what was fabricated and passed
around as gossip. Unfortunately, the non
fictional reality of her date rape is much
more horrifying and much less likely to be
discussed. It seems that even in gossip we
cannot admit to the possibility of sexual
assault at Stanford.
Similarly, we shy away from truly talking
about "drunk hook-ups." inebriated intima
cies ranging from a kiss to intercourse. We
seem to regard these encounters as tolerable
a normal part of college life. And maybe
they are. But even if they are a regular
aspect of a college social scene, are these
hook-ups acceptable to us? Is someone,
male or female, being taken advantage of?
And if so. is our silence condoning this
behavior?
We might hear murmurs of conversations
about eating disorders, hushed voices at the
dinner table as people size up the meals on
others' plates. No one seems to have a prob
lem discussing the presumed eating disor

ders of people whom we don't know well:
that girl in our class, a dormmate with whom
we aren't close, a distant acquaintance or a
celebrity. But what happens when we sus
pect a close friend of being anorexic or
bulimic? Students rarely bring up the subject
with close friends. Why? Maybe we fear
offending the friend, making a false accusa
tion or pushing the friend away. We find
some reason to justify our silence. We may
even start to make excuses for our friend's
eating habits: she doesn't like the dorm
food, she's been sick and unable to eat nor
mally. Everything is OK.
We all wish that Stanford was a Utopia, a
place devoid of maladies like depression,
sexual assault and eating disorders. And it's
easy to act as if Stanford were such a place.
It's easy to engage in conversations about
safe subjects.
But let's challenge ourselves to broach
seemingly taboo topics, at least with our
close friends. They will appreciate our open
ness. our willingness to go beyond the sur
face level. Delving deeper will allow us to
know one another more intimately. It will
forge closer friendships. And hopefully,
talking about things like depression, sexual
assault and eating disorders will ease the dif
ficulties for those who have suffered.
Let's start truly talking.
