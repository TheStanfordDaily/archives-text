## Childproofing Amsterdam, or good clean fun

Lauren Oster

THh FRONT DOOR of The Flying
Pig. my youth hostel in downtown
Amsterdam, warns ambitious back
packers that there are to be "NO
WEAPONS/NO HARDDRUGS
[sic]/NO DEALERS/NO JUNKS" on
the premises. "JUNKS" is unclear in this
context — Asian boats? Heroin, plural? —
but the sign radiates responsibility. I check
in at the front desk, noting that the recep
tionist looks to be an upstanding guv. and
hide my dorkv tourist suitcase under a bed
in the basement.
So far. so good: I grab my camera and a
ratty notebook. The fact-finding mission
may now begin in earnest.
Some travelers are drawn to Amsterdam
by its laissez-faire attitude toward recre
ational drugs and prostitution. Others con
gregate outside McDonald's and snap pic
tures. daring each other to go inside and
order a "Royale with Cheese". Still others
grab ratty notebooks and write columns
about their meaningful experiences with
foreigners.
Drugs. Quentin Tarantino. History. Ha.
My goal is verv different, and it is of dire

importance. My younger sister is to be pass
ing through Amsterdam in June during her
"1 just graduated from high school and will
now take Europe by storm" tour. No neu
rotic elder sibling worthy of the name would
allow her to do so without visiting the city in
person and assuring herself that good clean
fun reigned supreme. I am that neurotic
elder sibling, and 1 take it upon myself to
scour every last canal and leave no hookah
unturned in pursuit of tourist traps that will
preserve dear Emily's innocence. The spirit
of overprotection does not move me often:
when it does, and when it so happens that 1
have already booked a flight to Holland for
Spring Break, things get ugly.
The bar at The Flying Pig that plays reg
gae and scary Dutch techno-reggae, despite
the occasional lyrical reference to pot,
meets with my approval. Dutch techno, in
turn, is rendered harmless by virtue of its
unintelligibility. The adjoining cafe is a
raised platform littered with pillows, and it
is vaguely warm. It is peaceful, even womb
like. and 1 am on the verge of approving The
Pig altogether when, after milliseconds of
careful scrutiny, I realize that the bar and

speakers and receptionist and cafe and plat
form are all composed
of / using / selling / discussing drugs. Well,
shit.
The streets of Amsterdam are swarming
with ecstatic partygoers by midnight, and
their healthy exuberance fills me with hope;
1 slough off my Pig-induced lethargy and
follow a throng to a nightclub. All is well
until my nose is confronted with the torso of
a Dutch bouncer; it is Gay Night, and my
heterosexuality has been detected. I deny
any acquaintance with my date, but it is to
no avail; though Emily is traveling with a
girl, I doubt she will have better luck here. 1
bid the folk farewell and scowl at my date.
It is getting late, and 1 have been so con
sumed by my preemptive chaperone duties
that 1 have neglected to eat. 1 assume that a
city famed for its marijuana consumption
would teem with late night eateries; not so.
By the time I locate a wurst vendor near the
Centraal Station, I am beginning to fear that
I will have to hire someone in the Red Light
District to cook me dinner. The wurst ven
dor is sympathetic to my needs, though he
does not appear to vend anything 1 am capa

ble of eating. I return to the hostel with two
hot dog buns and the bitter taste of defeat in
my mouth. What if — not that Emily would
be awake that late, of course, but WHAT IF
— she were to wander the Red Light Dis
trict at 3 a.m. and could only nourish her
still-growing bones with hot dog buns? My
mission, 1 begin to realize, must end in fail
ure.
It must be acknowledged that my sister
will undoubtedly do whatever she likes in
Amsterdam and that she has been known to
avoid activities simply because I endorse
them. This Hurry of concern for her welfare
abroad, moreover, is representative of how
little I know of her interests and how little 1
know of her relative maturity. In searching
the city for sites and events that she would
enjoy, I find that 1 must either project my
own value system onto her or treat her like
a baby; neither impression is accurate, and
both are making my Spring Break far sappi
er than I had hoped it would be.
Why, cruel Amsterdam? Why must you
mock my attempts to suss you out and take
care of my sister?
Amsterdam does not respond. A man in

a hoodie tries to sell me cocaine and ecsta
sy, adding insult to injury; not only am I an
incompetent eldest child, but I have been
mistaken for a raver. 1 feel like JUNKS and
my only consolation lies in the knowledge
that, judging by past experiences, 1 will have
learned and grown by the conclusion of my
anecdote.
Emily is to be a freshman at Stanford in
the fall, and 1 have a hard time reminding
myself that I should neither goad her into
mimicking my college experience nor insult
her judgment by attempting to supervise
her freshman year. Sifting through this city
and trying to think like my sister has made
me painfully aware of the fact that I have no
idea how she thinks; it would be more use
ful for me to shut up and listen to her some
time than it is to try to childproof Amster
dam.
In an immediate sense, it is most useful
to shut up and enjoy my vacation.
