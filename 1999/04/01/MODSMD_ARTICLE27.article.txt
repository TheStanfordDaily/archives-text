The Cardinal seemed to come out
stronger for the second half with
sophomore Kelly Shouey drawing
and then scoring a four-meter
penalty shot. Unfortunately Din
geldein earned her third kickout
and was ejected from the game
early in the quarter. Koblik's shoul
der pain was enough for head coach
John Tanner to pull her from the
match, but losing two starters only
seemed to intensify the Cardinal
game. Shouey drew and scored an
other four-meter, bringing the score

to 5-3.
Santa Barbara scored its fourth
goal when sophomore Anne-Marie
Keenan earned her first kickout. but
the Cardinal got back its two-goal
lead with 2K seconds left in quarter.
Sophomore Hilary Gallogly
brought the score to 6-4 with a beau
tiful lob shot from down low.
Santa Barbara's final goal of the
game came in the fourth quarter
when a redirected shot made it past
Crary. The last goal scored came
from Shouey. her third of the game,
a backhand from the two-meter po
sition.
The game was definitely physical
with kickoutsand four-meters creat

ing most of the scoring opportunities
for both teams. Gauchogoalie Kate
lyn Henry had six saves and Crary
had eight.
"Just like we expected, (the Gau
che)] defense was strong and there
were many possessions where we
generated nothing," Tanner said.
"We played with a lot more emotion
the second half and overall I think
our passing and communication was
good."
The Gauchos "came out much
stronger than we expected but we
pulled it together by the end. Santa
Barbara is a great team and it hurt us
when we lost Margie and Kris early
in the game," Bell said.
