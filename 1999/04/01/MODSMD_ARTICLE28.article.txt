# Cardinal to begin homestand against Washington State

They finally are on the other
side of a difficult 14-game stretch
that included stops in Austin,
Texas, Oklahoma City, Okla.. and
Tucson, Ariz., during Spring
Break. And even if this is not ex
actly anyone's idea of a relaxing
Spring Break, the rewards that
Stanford's baseball players reaped
were plentiful.
The third-ranked Cardinal was
able to remain the Pacific 10 Con
ference's lone member in the top
10. Also, by sweeping three games
against Arizona last weekend,
Stanford has sprinted out to a 6-0

start in conference play, its best
since 1985.

■ Today: No. 3 Stanford (20-8. 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. Washing
ton State (16-9, 1-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference), 6 p.m.. Sunken Diamond.

But there are still concerns on
the mind of Stanford head coach
Murk Marquess, namely all the tin
kering he had to do with the lineup.
"I was forced to," Marquess
said. Junior center fielder Edmund
Muth "had viral meningitis and
never really was on the trip. (Se
nior third baseman Josh] Hochge
sang pulled a hamstring and missed

the Oklahoma game and was limit
ed, so we played some new people.
"We played [sophomore out
fielder] Billy Jacobson, who played
six of the seven games and did well.
We played [freshman] Andy
Topham for Hochgesang at third
base and he did a good job. So I was
forced to do some things and I
think that will help us over the long
haul."
That long haul begins tonight
with a three-game home series
against conference rival Washing
ton State (16-9, 1-2 Pac-10). The
Cardinal (20-8) will most likely be
without the services of Muth, who
