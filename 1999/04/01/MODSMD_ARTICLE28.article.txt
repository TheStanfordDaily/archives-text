# Cardinal to begin homestand against Washington State
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
They finally are on the other
side of a difficult 14-game stretch
that included stops in Austin,
Texas, Oklahoma City, Okla.. and
Tucson, Ariz., during Spring
Break. And even if this is not ex
actly anyone's idea of a relaxing
Spring Break, the rewards that
Stanford's baseball players reaped
were plentiful.
The third-ranked Cardinal was
able to remain the Pacific 10 Con
ference's lone member in the top
10. Also, by sweeping three games
against Arizona last weekend,
Stanford has sprinted out to a 6-0

start in conference play, its best
since 1985.

■ Today: No. 3 Stanford (20-8. 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. Washing
ton State (16-9, 1-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference), 6 p.m.. Sunken Diamond.

But there are still concerns on
the mind of Stanford head coach
Murk Marquess, namely all the tin
kering he had to do with the lineup.
"I was forced to," Marquess
said. Junior center fielder Edmund
Muth "had viral meningitis and
never really was on the trip. (Se
nior third baseman Josh] Hochge
sang pulled a hamstring and missed

the Oklahoma game and was limit
ed, so we played some new people.
"We played [sophomore out
fielder] Billy Jacobson, who played
six of the seven games and did well.
We played [freshman] Andy
Topham for Hochgesang at third
base and he did a good job. So I was
forced to do some things and I
think that will help us over the long
haul."
That long haul begins tonight
with a three-game home series
against conference rival Washing
ton State (16-9, 1-2 Pac-10). The
Cardinal (20-8) will most likely be
without the services of Muth, who

only started practicing yesterday
and may not be expected back until
next week, according to Marquess.
But the Pac-10 stops for no one,
something that Marquess is well
aware of.
"It's a great start — I'd rather be
6-0 than 0-6," Marquess said. "Hut
I also realize you can go through a
bad phase and if you don't play
well on a given weekend, you usu
ally get beaten. We've got a lot of
tough games coming up, and
you've got injuries and you've got
guys not playing well, but that's
part of it. To date, we've responded
very well."
Indeed, if last weekend is any in
dication, Stanford has started to hit
its stride despite the injuries. Last
weekend, the Cardinal rattled out

48 hits and scored 32 runs in its
sweep of Arizona. After hitting
under .3(H) as a team, Stanford has
stepped it up to .378 in conference
play.
The increased production has
come from some of the more un
heralded hitters, including Jeff
Rizzo.
The junior second baseman hit
.417 in the Arizona series with four
KB Is and two runs scored to go
along with two doubles and a
triple. Jacobson, who had been
mainly a defensive replacement
this season, hit .S(H) for the series
while providing a spark out of the
leadoff spot.
As for Washington State, it
hopes to make the postseason for
the first time since 1990. The
Cougars began conference play
last weekend, in which they
dropped two out of three games to
use.

Still, the Cougars pack a power
ful offensive punch. In last week
end's series, freshman third base
man Jeron Gates, sophomore right
fielder Jason Grove and junior in
fielder Ray Hattenburg combined
to hit .451 with three home runs, 17
RBIs and 12 runs scored. Still, they
remain a bit of a mystery team to
the Cardinal.
"This is the first time we've real
ly played Washington State," Mar
quess said. "This is different from
anyone we played. We know some
thing about Fullerton, we know
something about Santa Clara, we
know something about our teams.
Even though they are our confer
ence opponents, it's the first time
we've played them in a long time."
The mystery, however, will end
tonight as the Cardinal settles in
for its first home game in four
weeks — top-10 ranking and Pac
-10 lead intact.
