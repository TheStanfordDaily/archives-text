## 
### Gabby Duno Contributing writer 
After a disappointing beginning
to the Pacific 10 Conference sea
son, the No. 9 Stanford softball
team is looking to bounce back.
The team is holding on to a
strong 26-7 overall record, but fell
to 1-3 in the Pac-10 this weekend
after defeats at Washington and
UCLA. Though the Cardinal had
hoped to fair better, it belongs to a
conference with extremely strong
competition.

SOFTBALL
■ Today: No. 9 Stanford (26-7) vs.
Utah State (7-15). I p.m.. Stanford
Softball Complex.

Currently, eight Pac-10 teams
are ranked in the top 15. Undefeat
ed UCLA heads the field with the
No. 1 ranking followed by No. 2
Arizona, No. 4 Washington, No. ft
Arizona State, Stanford, No. 12
Oregon State, No. 13 Oregon and
No. 14 California. Needless to say,
this is the best conference in all of
Softball.
Still, the Cardinal is intent on
establishing itself as a threat to its
Pac-10 rivals. With that. Stanford
begins a slew of home games be
fore it heads back out on the road.
Today, the team starts a double
header against Utah State (7-15).
Though a non-conference game,
head coach John Rittman sees
today's competition ;is a chance to
"get back to our winning ways."
The Aggies head to Stanford for
the first of five road trip games.
Though not ranked in the top 25.
the Aggies certainly pose a formi
dable threat.
They have won five of their last
seven games and have not been
shut out in eight contests. Addi
tionally. junior first baseman
Sandy Millard is enjoying a nine
game hitting streak in which she

has hit .411 with two RBIs, two
homeruns, two doubles and eight
runs. Senior Emily Wilson-Piatt
and freshman Tiffany Pugmire
have hit successfully in four and
five games, respectively.
Of late, Utah State has been col
lecting victories with endurance —
outlasting its opponents in the final
innings. As of last week, Aggie
players have scored 24 runs after
the fourth inning. Offensively, se
nior Tammy Alacantar leads the
pack in hits. In Utah State's victo
ries, Alacantar has hit .500, posted
13 RBIs and nine runs. When the
team has lost, Alacantar has been
held to a .362 average.
"They have a couple of really
good hitters." Rittman said. "We
take every opponent seriously and
these are two games that we need
to win."
Stanford realizes the impor
tance of capitalizing on its home
field advantage. Currently, the
Cardinal is 10-1 at home, 2-3 on the
road and 14-3 in neutral territory.
Keeping with that, it should domi
nate today's opponent but must
play a consistent game.
"If we go out there and play our
game, 1 think we should do fine."
Rittman said.
Playing "our game" has many
connotations, but the offensive
power supplied by this year's team
has been exemplary. The team
boasts a .324 average collectively
and has seven players batting over
.300.
Additionally, the pitching duo
of seniors Becky Blevins and
Marcy Crouch has left opponents
scared. To this point, they have a
combined 1.08 ERA and have al
lowed an average of 1.3 runs per
game.
After the game against the Ag
gies. Stanford looks forward to its
next Pac-10 competition. The Car
dinal will host Cal in a doublehead
er this Saturday beginning at 1 p.m.
