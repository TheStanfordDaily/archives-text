conference yesterday, Stanford's
graduate population and the NBA

association.
"With our common goals of high
er pay and better working conditions,
we feel this is an ideal match." coun
cil member I larris Shapiro said.
Players' Union head Patrick
Ewing agreed.
"We understand the plight of the
working student," he said. "Living on
a teaching stipend is a lot like making
the league minimum. Sometimes it's
hard to make ends meet."
Council member Robert Rudnit
sky added that the students and play
ers look forward to negotiating a new
contract for all union members with
Commisioner David Stern. Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice.

"We've gone one-on-one with
them before, and we're looking for
ward to bringing the 'skill/.' of
Barkley and Shai| into the game," he
said. "We feel that we've been getting
garbage time in the lab, and we want
to take them downtown."
University officials had mixed
feelings.
"We wish the graduate students
hadn't taken this drastic step. We
aren't making money as it is." Rice
said.
Rice alluded to the possibility of a
lockout to keep salaries in check until
administrators can negotiate a more
lucrative pay-per-view contract for
Faculty Senate meetings.
Casper agreed. "We need new
revenue streams il graduate students
salaries are to begin an upward spi
ral."
He also mentioned plans for skv
boxes in Kresge and Annenberg Au
ditoriums. to be completed by the fall
of 2(XK). Full-quarter leases and 10-
lecturc package deals will be avail
able, he said.
"Someone has to pay the students'
new salaries," he said.
Stanford itself was heavily criti
cized last year bv other universities
for starting the latest round of gradu
ate student demands with its signing
of top theoretical physics doctoral
candidate Anfernee Oppenheimer
to a guaranteed seven-year, $150,000
deal including housing in "lavish"
Crothers Memorial Mall.
