# Sailing faces tough competition over break
## 
### Jeff Cooper Editorial staff 
Rather than relaxing in the sun
or drifting around tropical beaches,
the No. 16 Cardinal sailing team
took advantage of its Spring Break
to get some tough East Coast com
petition under its belt. Last week
end, the coed team faced harsh At
lantic weather and top-2() competi
tion to place sixth in the E. Aaron
Szambecki Team Race Intersec
tional at Old Dominion.

SAILING
■ Last week: No. 16 Stanford com
piled a 4-10 record in the E. Aaron
Szambecki Team Race at Old Do
minion.

The Cardinal sailors faced sev
eral hurdles in the Szambecki race:
20 to 25-knot winds, precipitation
ranging from rain to sleet to snow,
unfamiliar classes of boats and an
unfamiliar team racing format. Do

spite the obstacles, the team fin
ished with a 4-10 record for the
weekend.
"We were improving vastly the
whole weekend, even it our record
didn't show it," said junior Katie
Gregg.
The majority of the team's com
petitions are in a fleet racing for
mat, where each boat races against
every other boat. The Szambecki
race was run in a three-on-three
team racing format, where teams of
three boats compete as a unit.
The race featured a number of
traditional sailing powerhouses; all
eight teams represented were
ranked in the top 20 nationally. No.
2 College of Charleston came in
first overall for the weekend, with a
14-3 record.
The Spring Break schedule
poses a challenge to the team, as
multiple races are run on the same
weekend. From March 20-21, for
example, the team sent a coed
group to the Truxton IJmstead re
gatta in Annapolis, as well as a
women's group to the St. Mary's
College Intersectional.
"We're stretching our team
pretty thin to cover these races,"
sa id head coach Steve Bourdow.
Similarly, the team that compet
ed at Old Dominion was depleted
by the women's President's Cup
race at Boston University this past
weekend. The women's team
placed third overall in that meet,

winning the A division and taking
third in the B division.
The thin lineup and new format
led to some early problems for the
Cardinal sailors at the Szambecki
race.
"We had some trouble getting
off the line," Gregg said. "So we
were playing catch-up from the be
ginning in some of the races. But
once we did that, we had some top
live finishes."
Among the positives for the
Cardinal this break were the re
turns of sophomore Jeff Condon
and junior Anika Leersen, two of
the team's top sailors.
"We've been in rebuilding and

learning mode for a while," said
head coach Steve Bourdow. "A lot
of times we go back [to the East
Coast] a little unsure of what our
goals should be and what we should
expect. The advantage the New
England and Mid-Atlantic schools
have is that they can sail against
each other more often without hav
ing to travel too far."
More than anything else, the
team was grateful for the continu
ing experience in hectic and unfa
miliar conditions.
"It was crazy and windy and
snowing on us," said junior Caro
line Sumpf. "We definitely learned
a hell of a lot this weekend."
