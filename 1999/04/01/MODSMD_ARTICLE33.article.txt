For the second consecutive year,
three of the 30 recipients of a pres
tigious scholarship for immigrants
and first-generation Americans are
students at Stanford School of
Medicine.
Constance Chen, Salmaan Ke
shavjee and Rafael Vargas were
chosen from a pool of 1,215 appli
cants from 410 schools to receive
Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships,
which will get each ol them hall tu
ition and $40,000 over two years.
Soros Fellows are chosen for
their academic excellence, stellar
accomplishments in their fields of
study and commitment to Ameri
can values, as demonstrated
through activities in support of
human rights, personal liberty and
responsible citizenship, according

to the Paul and Daisy Soros foun
dation, which gives out the award.
"It is truly an honor and a privi
lege to have been selected for this,
and to meet other fellows who re
ceived the award," said Keshavjee.
Keshavjee was born in Nairobi,
Kenya, and moved to Canada with
his parents where he was raised. In
1991 lie began graduate work at
Harvard, where he received a mas
ter's in tropical public health in
1993, another in Middle Eastern
studies in 1995 and a doctorate in
anthropology and Middle Eastern
studies in 1998.
He came to Stanford Medical
School from Harvard, where he is
currently in his second year of work
toward an M.D. in Internal Medi
cine.
In 1995, after a summer working
in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with the In

ternational Center for Diarrheal
Disease Research, Keshavjee went
to the former Soviet republic of
Tajikistan, where he served as a
volunteer social researcher with
the Aga Khan Foundation. That
foundation was the major distribu
tor of pharmaceuticals in the coun
try's easternmost province.
He used his experiences in
Tajikistan as research for his disser
tation, "The Political Economy of
Health and Social Change in Post-
Soviet Tajikistan." He also devel
oped and taught an anthropology
course at Stanford on health, dis
ease and global social change.
Sharing in the enthusiasm of the
honor, Chen said that she is "de
lighted to receive the funding from
the fellowship."
"Fellowships, such as this one,
always open new vistas for students

to continue producing good work."
Chen was born in Columbus,
Ohio, to Taiwanese parents. She
received her bachelor's in history
from Harvard in 1990. A year later
the New Press published her book.
" The Sex Side of Life: Mary Ware
Dennett's Pioneering Battle lot
Birth Control."
However, despite a promising
career as an author and journalist,
Chen began training in medicine.
She is now in the second year of the
M.D. program at the Stanford
Medical School.
Last summer, Chen did research
in China for a study of the physical
and emotional costs of impersonal
care provided to girls in orphan
ages. She hopes to pursue cross
cultural research and writing that
will build on her training in public
health, medicine and anthropolo

gy, as well as her writing experi
ence. She also hopes to work to
ward a doctoral degree in medical
anthropology.
The third recipient, Rafael Var
gas. is a native of Marelia, Mexico,
whose family migrated to the Cen
tral Valley of California, and his
goal is to provide medical care for a
variety of underserved and disad
vantaged populations.
Vargas came to Stanford Med
ical School after a stint as a substi
tute high school and middle school
teacher in Central California
schools with large immigrant and
farm worker populations. He com
pleted undergraduate work at UC-
Davis and received his bachelor's
in biology in 1997.
He has contributed his skills to
the betterment of immigrant and
farmer worker populations, a pop

ulation he is familiar with as a child
of agricultural laborers in the Cen
tral Valley.
Vargas is no stranger to hard
work himself, having worked more
than 40 hours per week to pay his
college costs and taking jobs as an
intern in a family practice clinic
that served minority communities
and as a live-in personal attendant
for a quadriplegic.
Vargas is very active in commu
nity organizations and developed
an interactive program for an Ad
ventures in Science project to dis
courage drug use among middle
school students in Davis.
Last summer, Vargas experi
enced first-hand his goal of provid
ing medical care for underserved
populations, working as a live-in
health practitioner at a camp for
children of migrant farm workers.
