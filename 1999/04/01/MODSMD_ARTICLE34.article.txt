Stanford athletes may be facing
greater competition, as a recent
court case has called into question
the National ( ollcgiatc Athletic As
sociation's initial eligibility require
ments.
The NCAA was granted a slay
I uesday in a Philadelphia federal
appeals court. The court reversed a
district court ruling that found the
association's academic initial-eligi
bility requirements were discrimi
natory against African American
student athletes.
Therefore, the association's ini
tial-eligibility rules remain in effect
but only temporarily.
In l l )%, the N( AA's Proposition

-16 was implemented, requiring ath
letes to have a certain CIPA in com
bination with a standardized test
score in order to be eligible to com
pete in college athletics.
Athletes with a core GPA of 2.5
and higher can score as low as an <S2()
on the SATs. If an athlete's C iPA is
2.0., the lowest average the NCAA
allows, his or her SAT score must be
;it least 1010.
Earlier this year, four African-
American student-athletes chal
lenged the N( 'AA's initial-eligibility
standards, and on March <S Judge
Donald I- Buckwalter ruled in favor
of the athletes.
According to Susan Burk. direc
tor of student services for the Stan
ford Athletic Department, neither
the original March ruling nor Tues

day's stay has a great affect on the
University.
She said that the main way it af
fects the school is that if NCAA's
initial-eligibility standards are low
ered. other colleges have the poten
tial to sign athletes that before
would not have qualified. This
would heighten the competition lor
Stanford with other universities.
According to yesterday's Chroni
ele of Higher Education, the
NCAA's initial-eligibility guidelines
"were designed to ensure that col
leges and universities in Division I of
the NCAA recruited only those ath
letes with a realistic chance of earn
ing a degree."
Because the NCAA has authori
ty over college athletic programs,
which receive federal funds. Buck

waiter also ruled that the association
is subject to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1%4.
The stay gives the NCAA time to
adjust their eligibility standards, and
according to the Chronicle of High
er Education, it is considering three
basic alternatives to Proposition lb.
"Two options would lower the
minimum SAT requirement, while
the third would do away with the
cutoff score altogether and allow for
a full extension of the sliding scale,"
the publication reported.
The University supports Proposi
tion lbs academic requirements, as
"Stanford has always promoted the
most stringent academic creden
tials," Burk said. "We're supportive
of things that bring up the academic
credentials of all students."
