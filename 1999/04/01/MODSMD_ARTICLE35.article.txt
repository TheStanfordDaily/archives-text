# Aero-astro prof Roberts, 69, dies
## Served 15-year stint at NASA-Ames 
### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
Friends and family gathered on
March 14 to say goodbye to
Leonard Roberts, a retired re
search professor in the Aeronautics
and Astronautics Department.
Roberts succumbed to the degener
ative disease cerebellar atrophy on
March 6 in his home in Los Gatos.
He was 69.
Roberts enjoyed an extensive
and celebrated career. Before join
ing the Stanford faculty, he was the
director of aeronautics and flight
systems during a 15-year stint at the
NASA Ames Research Center at
Moffett Field in Mountain View.
"He was very competent, both
as an aerodynamicist and as a man
ager of the entire aerodynamics
program at Ames," said longtime
friend and associate Richard Shev
ell, an emeritus professor of aero
nautics and astronautics, in a press
release.
When Roberts retired from
NASA in 1983. he came to Stanford
to direct the Joint Institute for
Aeronautics while supervising
graduate students in the depart
ment and continuing his research.
Roberts was a specialist in the
area of vortices, swirls of air that
large airliners leave in their wake.
These swirls can be dangerous to
smaller airliners that follow them.
His research on these vortices pro

vided a theoretical basis for the
rules that air traffic controllers now
employ to guide the distribution of
planes in the air.
At Stanford, he developed
methods for controlling delta-wing
aircraft. His approach, blowing air
across the leading edge of the wing,
allowed designers to eliminate
many mechanical moving parts.
This approach was so successful
that the military is currently incor
porating his design into the con
struction of its new fighter planes,
according to Arthur Bryson, a fel
low emeritus professor of aeronau
tics and astronautics.
"He was a man of small stature
physically," Bryson said in the press
release, "but of large stature intel
lectually."
Roberts, who was born in Wales
in 1929. received his doctorate in
1955 from Manchester University
in England. After teaching math
ematics at MIT for two years, he
joined NASA's Langley Research
Center in Virginia where he be
came head of the mathematical
physics branch.
Roberts received a NASA Dis
tinguished Service Medal in 1976.
was elected a Stanford-Sloan Fel
low and Fellow of the American In
stitute for Aeronautics and Astro
nautics.
He is survived by his wife Bar
bara, two sons. Mark and Peter, and
five grandchildren.
