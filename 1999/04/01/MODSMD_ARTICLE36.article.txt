## Nobel laureate Osheroff fields questions from high schoolers 
### Jamilla Coleman 
Physics Prof. Douglas Os
heroffs latest "experiment" may
have been altered at the hands of
high school students from Ocean
Lakes High School.
The "experiment" began about
four months ago when be began an
an e-mail exchange with students at
the Virginia Reach, Va., magnet
high school to answer their ques
tions about physics.
But for some time, his high
school pen pals have seemed more
concerned with him as a Nobel
Laureate than as a physics profes
sor.
Osheroff received the Nobel
Prize alone with two of his col

leagues in 1996 for discovering
that, at extremely low tempera
tures. a rare form of helium be
comes a superfluid with unusual
properties.
The e-mail exchange started
when he spoke at a physics collo
quium at Old Dominion Universi
ty. in Norfolk. Va.. last year. After
the speech. Ocean Lakes physics
teacher Jim Cook introduced him
to one of his students, Natalie Sim
mons.
Later, along with an e-mailed
thank-you note. Simmons suggest
ed to Osheroff the idea of an ongo
ing correspondence. Now, amid his
busy schedule, he communicates
with the Ocean Lake students once
a week.

Deeming communication skills
"absolutely essential" in any career
field, Osheroff wants to maintain a
dialogue with the students. He
added that many university profes
sors would like to "adopt" a high
school class to aid the teacher in
providing answers to questions that
students might raise but which
their textbooks do not consider.
Osheroff said that one of the
first questions he received at the
beginning of the correspondence
asked how receiving the Nobel
Prize has changed his life. Inquiries
such as, "Do physics icons have
pets, and if so, are any of them
named Albert?" have compelled
him to post his own physics-orient
ed questions for the students to an

swer. And yes, he and his wife have
owned many pets, including a talk
ing parrot named Albert. Osheroff
insisted that the parrot was not
named after Einstein, but rather
after Albert, an alligator featured
in the "Pogo" comic strip.
Despite a shift from his original
goal of mentorship. Osheroff be
lieves his exchanges are still effec
tive.
"I go around the world trying to
prove that Nobel physicists are
human beings," he said.
Along with questions he sends
the students e-mails about his life
and work, as well as photos of trav
els with his wife. "We [physicists]
are not that different from their
own parents."
