# Coach leaves, joins Clippers
## 
### Jonathan Acres Senior staff writer 
Monty has left the building.
The Los Angeles Clippers, off to
one of the worst starts in NBA his
tory, fired head coach Chris Ford
yesterday and replaced him with
Stanford men's basketball coach
Mike Montgomery.
"Everyone told Mike that he
couldn't win at Stanford, and he
proved them wrong," Clippers Vice
President for Basketball Opera
tions Elgin Baylor said at a press
conference. "We think he'll prove
them wrong here, too."
The announcement was made at
a press conference in the Clippers
current home, the Los Angeles
Sports Arena. Montgomery said he
was excited about what many view
as an unenviable job.
"It's a big task, for sure," Mont
gomery said. "But I think I'm
ready. There's some talent on this
team, and I think I can win with it."
Montgomery, who in 16 years
took Stanford from conference
whipping boy to national power
house, takes over a Clippers team
that is 3-26 on the year. The fran
chise, which moves into the new
Staples Center in Los Angeles next
season, is a perennial basement
dweller. He will be 011 the bench
tonight in Dallas for the Clippers'
game with the Mavericks.
He plans to immediately shake
up the team, benching former Pacif
ic 10 Conference rivals Derrick
Martin and Pooh Richardson of
UCLA and Lamond Murray of
California. "Also, we're hoping to
sign Dion Cross and Rich Jackson

soon," he said.
Basketball analysts who praise
the coach's work at Stanford ques
tion whether Montgomery can pull
off a repeat performance in L.A.
"Granted, the Clippers don't
have Stanford's academic reputa
tion or basketball tradition," Mont
gomery said. "They don't have
much funding or really any support
ive fans."
He paused.
"We are moving into a new
arena next year, though."
Stanford administrators and cur
rent and former players mourned
the decision.
"We're really, really going to
miss him," Athletics Director Ted
Leland said. "He's a wonderful
man. I guess I just thought he was
smarter than this."
"Playing for someone else just
won't be the same," said junior for
ward Mark Madsen, the lone
starter returning to next year's
team. "Of course, I hope he doesn't
draft me next year. You'd have to
be crazy to go to the Clippers."
Former Cardinal standout
Brevin Knight, now the point guard
for the Cleveland Cavaliers, was
visibly shaken by the news.
"Damn," he said. "At least he could
have held out for the Warriors."
The Clippers, for their part, will
have to deal with the changes that
Montgomery will bring.
"This is a turning point for our
franchise," Baylor said. "We used
to just ruin great players. Now,
we'll probably be ruining a great
coach."
