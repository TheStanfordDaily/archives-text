## PREMIER OF STANFORD PLAYWRIGHT'S 'SBF 'SBF: Single Black Female' by Lisa B. Thompson 
### 
/^Z^ ayArea
Lnative
and
Stanford doctor
lal candidate Lisa
B. Thompson
premiered her
new play, "SBF:
Single Black
Female," on
March 11 at Theater
Rhinoceros.

Inspired by her dissertation, "Show and Tell:
Representations of Black Middle Class Sexuality in
Contemporary African American Narrative and
Performance," "SBF" was developed in workshops
with famed poet Cherrie Moraga.
The partnership with Moraga was not a stretch
for Thompson. A poet herself, Thompson's work
has appeared in"The Black Arts Quarterly,"
"Enigma," "Hastings Women's Law Journal" and
more recently in "Catch the Fire: A Cross-
Generational Anthology of Contemporary African-
American Poetry." She first became interested in
writing at a young age when she discovered the exis
tence of a Black Poetry section at her local library.
Thompson spent her undergraduate years at
UCLA studying English and avoiding anything the
atrical in an attempt to pursue a more scholarly
route. Looking back, however, Thompson said, "If
there is something in you, it will emerge at some
point." For Thompson, that "something" was the
ater.
After a two-month stint in law school,
Thompson heeded the urging of a former professor
who encouraged her to follow her passion: she left
law school to pursue a master's degree in African
American studies at UCLA. While working at
UCLA, Thompson started to write again, develop
ing and maturing her writing voice. It was during

this period that Thompson wrote her first theatrical
piece, a one-woman show entitled "Dreadtime
Stories: One Sista's Hair." She enjoyed the freedom
and control that writing and performing her own
pieces gave her and decided to pursue theater fur
ther. Soon after, Thompson came to Stanford for
her doctoral degree and had the opportunity to
work with Cherrie Moraga in the Drama
Department. Moraga, impressed by Thompson's
"Monroe," encouraged her to work with the

Brava! theater for women in various writing
workshops. It was there that Thompson first read '
"SBF" as a work-in-progress at Braval's Women in

the Arts Showcase. The piece garnered the atten
tion of Theater Rhinoceros' Artistic Director,

Adele Prandini.

Traditionally known as the premier gay and '
lesbian theater in the Bay Area, Theater Rhino

took on Thompson's "SBF" as a departure
from its usual genre. Although themes of

bisexuality are woven throughout the play,
Rhino's Associate Artistic Director Doug
Holsclaw commented that it is "more

straight than usual" for the theater. Theater
Rhino prides itself on being artist-based the
ater, driven by what has talent and merit,

rather than what panders to audience pref
erences. "We do not operate from a place
of fear," said Holsclaw about the potential
reaction to "SBF." "We want to broaden
our audience's horizons for a more '90s

feel."

Directed by Colman Domingo, "SBF"

focuses on the lives of two single black

females, played by Comika Griffin and Tia

Hunnicutt. One is a college professor at

a prestigious university, the other is a

director of marketing in a Silicon

Valley firm. As professional black

women, both must deal with the

"Shenequa Bonita" stereotype on the one hand and
the stereotypical "black bitch," typified by Anita
Hill, on the other. Told through rapid-fire comic
vignettes, the play explores gay and straight rela
tionships, friendships, racism, pain, heartache, sex,
love and shopping, both exploring and poking fun
at the cultural identity of the black middle class.
Despite its comedic nuances, "SBF" provides a vivid
and thoughtful portrait of diverse black women in
their efforts to navigate the urban world.

"I want to shed light on black women
and validate us and say, 'Look at us

smart black women. Aren't we
amazing?' " Thompson explained.
"We are frequently portrayed with-

out the depth, soul and humanity

that we deserve." Single, black mid-

dle-class women, according to
Thompson, are often unable to find a

place in mainstream society. It is
v for this reason that Thompson

strives to illustrate the necessity
of self-love, acceptance and

strong bonds between black

women, as well as within the black

community at large.

"SBF" is running
until April 10 at
Theater Rhinoceros;
for tickets and reser
vations, call (415)
861-5079.
