# THE 						DO RIGHT NOVEL IS DOING ALL RIGHT
## 'A Do Right Man' by Omar Tyree 
### 
Terry McMillan's novel "Waiting to
\JJyif Exhale" (Simon and Schuster) was published
v in 1992, McMillan challenged those who crit
icized her portrayals of black men to write their own
novels. Six years later, Omar Tyree has done just that with
"A Do Right Man" (Simon and Schuster).
Tyree is a poet, journalist and author. His previous
books include "Flyy Girl," "Capital City: The Chronicles
of a D.C. Underworld" and "Battle Zone: The Struggle to
Survive the American Institution." "A Do Right Man,"
Tyree's fourth and latest novel, takes the reader on an
intimate journey into the male point of view.
Meet Bobby Dallas. He's a communication major at
Howard University, concentrating on radio broadcasting
with a minor in love. He's got big dreams of producing
radio shows, maybe even having his own syndicated talk
show one day. He also has big dreams of romance with
the right woman, a black woman who is intelligent, tal
ented and sexy. Lucky in academics, he finds himself
unlucky in love. Dallas classifies himself as "a nice guy"
and "a perfect gentleman from Greensboro, North
Carolina." The women he meets classify him as "just a
good friend."
Although Tyree makes the male-female relationship
the primary focus of his novel, he also draws attention to
Bobby Dallas' development toward manhood. Tyree
stresses the role of family, an element frequently left out
of or de-emphasized in literature about African-
American males. Bobby doesn't have any drug problems,
he's not raising any kids and he comes from a stable fam

ily background. His only problems are the competitive
ness he and his brother Brad share, his mediocre grades
at Howard University, his pipe dream of being a radio
producer and his bad luck with women.
"Do Right" follows Dallas after graduation from city to
city as he learns the ins and outs of public radio. Of
Dallas' two goals, radio proves easiest for him to achieve,
but both his career and love life go through many ups and
downs. With support from his family and help and advice
from his friends and business associates, he is able to
climb the shaky ladder of radio broadcasting to success
and make a name for himself. Romantic happiness, how
ever, continues to elude him.
Through his various relationships with women, rang
ing from the purely platonic to the explicitly sexual,
Dallas realizes that being a do right man takes more than
a college degree, economic security and good looks. It
also takes heart and risk. Juxtaposed against his romantic
relationships are his many male friendships with bosses,
mentors and associates. These friendships challenge
Dallas to form his identity. They give him insight not only
into economic and social matters but matters of the heart
as well.
Bobby Dallas says that the perfect metaphor for his life
is a roller coaster because of the many ups and downs and
sharp turns he encounters. A roller coaster is also the per
fect metaphor for this book. "A Do Right Man" is a ride
full of humor, insight and occasional poignancy.
