# THEATER/INTERVIEW
## PRE-MILLENNIUM TENSION 'RENT' at the Golden Gate Theatre 
### 
supposed to be the "Hair" of the '90s, a time capsule with a few
112 neat songs that brought rock to Broadway. "Rent" had an inspiring
tSf message of love and survival amidst greed and death when it pre
miered off-Broadway in 1996. But now, the East Village has become fully gen
trified. Massive inroads have been made against AIDS. Flannel shirts and yeah,
heroin, are so pass£. And with its Urban Outfitters sweaters and minimalist,
junk-strewn set, "Rent" is beginning to look sort of dated. It scares me that this
might come to represent the '90s.
Additionally, a musical is always a risky proposition, for it multiplies all the
demands of a stage play — character, plot, setting, etc. — with the need for
catchy tunes and some kind of link between the two. FYI: I usually hate them.
And "Rent" needs a lot of revision, which it would have undoubtedly received
had its creator, Jonathan Larson, not suddenly died the night after its last dress

rehearsal.
Still, "Rent" is a stirring night at the theater, more specifically the Golden
Gate Theatre in San Francisco. The anthemic. refrain of "No day but today" is
impossibly affecting. I don't know why, but the few times that it recurs are sim
ply emotionally overwhelming. Each repetition is a perfect moment — the
alignment of lyrical passion and a gorgeous melody. Even if what it urges is
simple ("There's only us/There's only this/No other road /No other
way / No day but today"), it makes no sense to argue against it or even intel
lectualize it at all. And if it inspires you to forsake your fears about the future
and become a filmmaker or whatever, so much the better for everyone.
See, you can't help but be of two minds about the thing. "Rent" dares to be
cynically aware of the shallow depths of mid-'9os culture while still stirring you
to "Give in to Love." The character of Mark, an aspiring filmmaker, while not
really central to the plot, is represen
tative of this dynamic He's always
urging people to feel their own emo
tions and raising a cry for "La Vie
Bohfcme"; meanwhile, he's detached
through his voyeuristic filmmaking
as well as being single and alone
amongst his HIV-positive friends,
Anthony Rapp became famous on
Broadway for his portrayal of this
character. In this production, Trey
Bllett maintains Rapp's distinctive
neurotic whine while adding an
innocent aspect to the character that
I found rather touching. It makes his
dilemma that much more under*
standable, a product of his youth
rather than just his timing.
Actually, as dated as it might be,
the most successful parts of "Rent"
are the timeless ones: the tragic
courtship of Roger and Mimi, the
early death of the angelic Angel, the
pained and lonely fear of "Will I?"
Though the jokes about cell phones
and Newt Gingrich's lesbian sister
might not have much more of a shelf
life, "No day but today* will provoke
tears and applause well past the
Y2Ks.
