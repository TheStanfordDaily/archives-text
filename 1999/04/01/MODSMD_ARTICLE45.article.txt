# TOO MUCH MONKEY BUSINESS
## Dave Davies talks to Intermission about playing guitar in the Kinks and John Lennon's ghost and calls Pete Townshend a thief! Interview by Soren Johnson

112 e ma ) or bands from the first British Invasion,
f/yj the Kinks were by far the most enigmatic.
\ / Although they started out as proto-punks, doing
wild, super-charged R&B, by the end of the decade, they
were quietly singing the praises of "little shops, china cups
and virginity." Then, of course, as the '70s began, their
next big hit was about a transvestite ("Lola").
These wild shifts largely followed the mood swings of
the Kinks' lead singer and primary songwriter, Ray
Davies. However, like so many other of their contempo
raries, the Kinks relied on a secondary singer and writer,
Ray's younger brother, Dave. Some of Dave's best songs,
such as "Death Of A Clown" and "Trust Your Heart,"
stand out as highlights of the Kinks' catalog. Further,
Dave was the group's lead guitarist, and his pioneering
use of distortion on their first hit, "You Really Got Me,"
changed the vocabulary of rock V roll.
Although the Kinks have recorded for four decades,
Dave has maintained an intermittent solo career through
the years. During the '60s, a number of Dave's songs, such
as "Lincoln County" and "Suzannah's Still Alive," were
released as singles. At the beginning of the '80s, Dave also
produced three full solo albums.
Dave has now released an appropriately idiosyncratic
anthology entitled "Unfinished Business: Dave Davies
Kronikles, 1963-1998." The two-disc set charts his best
songs and performances with the Kinks, highlights from
his '80s albums and re-recordings of his '60s solo singles,

which are currently tied up in legal knots. The compila
tion also contains a new song titled "Unfinished
Business."
Dave and his band are currently touring to promote
the new anthology. They are appearing tomorrow at San
Jose's Cactus Club and Saturday at Slim's in San
Francisco.
Intermission: What is the story behind the song
"Unfinished Business?"
Dave Davies: For some years, since my early 20s,
I've been interested in psychic phenomenon, spiritual
ism and the afterworld. I've also had a number of psy
chic experiences throughout my early years. I got
together with an old, dear friend of mine, Dr. Richard
Lawrence, a psychic researcher in England, in March
1996 at a restaurant in London when Richard sensed
the presence of John Lennon, and immediately, I heard
his voice and started writing down "Unfinished
Business." It's not really channeling, it's more like a
three-way psychic communion. It lasted on and off for
about two weeks. After the initial contact, I started to
realize things about my own unfinished business, like
what I wanted to do and, in a global sense, how every
one has their own unfinished business. The song sort
of grew out of those feelings and that experience.
Within three weeks, I had the song finished and mas
tered. It all tied in with the anthology I have been try
ing to put together for the last five years, which had
been tied up for various reasons. Thus, it all fit togeth
er with my unfinished plans and dreams, and hence the
compilation is named after the song — it's an album of
unfinished business.
I: How well did you know John Lennon?
DD: I knew him very little in the early days. In those
days, we would hang out after hours in clubs and such.
Musically, I didn't know him very well. We did a few
shows with the Beatles. I spoke with him on a few occa
sions — a few drunken occasions in night clubs. I did
n't know him particularly that well. However, I was a
great admirer of his work; he was the soul of the
Beatles.
I: The Kinks' early work obviously owes a great deal
to heavy R&B. How did you first get turned on to that
kind of music when you were a British teen-ageri
DD: I always loved music. My house was full of
music. Ray and I were the youngest of eight. We had six
older sisters who brought home different types of
music: Glenn Miller, Fats Domino, Elvis. I started to
really get interested in the guitar from listening to

Duane Eddy and Big Bill Broonzy. My brother-in-law,
who was an accomplished guitarist, introduced me to
Broonzy and Django Reinhardt, and I fell in love with
the guitar.
I: How did you learn to play?
DD: Picking up lines and things. A few chords here
and there. I tried to copy it mostly by ear.
I: How supportive were your parents?
DD: Fortunately, my parents were very supportive
of me taking up the guitar. A lot of my friends at school
had a tremendous amount of academic work to do, but
I think because we were a poor, working-class family,
my parents saw the guitar as something for me to do. I
was a pretty wild kid.
I: In your mind, which Kinks album stands out
most from the '60s?
DD: I always thought "Arthur" was a really special
case. 1 always loved that record. I thought we were real
ly set on our path when we did that album. I really
enjoyed it just as a musician. Overall, I thought it was
an exceptional piece of work. It wasn't really well
received in England although it eventually caught on in
America. I was just so into music — I've always loved
good songs. That's why I liked Buddy Holly the same
way I liked Duane Eddy and Eddie Cochran.
I: I hear a lot of Chuck Berry in your work.
DD: Oh absolutely. I'm sure credit has been given to
Chuck Berry by now. He's probably inspired more
musicians of my era than anybody else. Lyrically, I'm
sure that Dylan was influenced by him, with his flow
ing lyrics and observations. Plus, he's such a great gui
tarist. I think everybody uses his guitar playing.

I: Were you influenced by

Bo Diddley?
DD: Yeah, but in a

different way. We

were influenced by i

all of these people.
