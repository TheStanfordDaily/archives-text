# TOO MUCH MONKEY BUSINESS
## Dave Davies talks to Intermission about playing guitar in the Kinks and John Lennon's ghost and calls Pete Townshend a thief! Interview by Soren Johnson 
### 
112 e ma ) or bands from the first British Invasion,
f/yj the Kinks were by far the most enigmatic.
\ / Although they started out as proto-punks, doing
wild, super-charged R&B, by the end of the decade, they
were quietly singing the praises of "little shops, china cups
and virginity." Then, of course, as the '70s began, their
next big hit was about a transvestite ("Lola").
These wild shifts largely followed the mood swings of
the Kinks' lead singer and primary songwriter, Ray
Davies. However, like so many other of their contempo
raries, the Kinks relied on a secondary singer and writer,
Ray's younger brother, Dave. Some of Dave's best songs,
such as "Death Of A Clown" and "Trust Your Heart,"
stand out as highlights of the Kinks' catalog. Further,
Dave was the group's lead guitarist, and his pioneering
use of distortion on their first hit, "You Really Got Me,"
changed the vocabulary of rock V roll.
Although the Kinks have recorded for four decades,
Dave has maintained an intermittent solo career through
the years. During the '60s, a number of Dave's songs, such
as "Lincoln County" and "Suzannah's Still Alive," were
released as singles. At the beginning of the '80s, Dave also
produced three full solo albums.
Dave has now released an appropriately idiosyncratic
anthology entitled "Unfinished Business: Dave Davies
Kronikles, 1963-1998." The two-disc set charts his best
songs and performances with the Kinks, highlights from
his '80s albums and re-recordings of his '60s solo singles,

which are currently tied up in legal knots. The compila
tion also contains a new song titled "Unfinished
Business."
Dave and his band are currently touring to promote
the new anthology. They are appearing tomorrow at San
Jose's Cactus Club and Saturday at Slim's in San
Francisco.
Intermission: What is the story behind the song
"Unfinished Business?"
Dave Davies: For some years, since my early 20s,
I've been interested in psychic phenomenon, spiritual
ism and the afterworld. I've also had a number of psy
chic experiences throughout my early years. I got
together with an old, dear friend of mine, Dr. Richard
Lawrence, a psychic researcher in England, in March
1996 at a restaurant in London when Richard sensed
the presence of John Lennon, and immediately, I heard
his voice and started writing down "Unfinished
Business." It's not really channeling, it's more like a
three-way psychic communion. It lasted on and off for
about two weeks. After the initial contact, I started to
realize things about my own unfinished business, like
what I wanted to do and, in a global sense, how every
one has their own unfinished business. The song sort
of grew out of those feelings and that experience.
Within three weeks, I had the song finished and mas
tered. It all tied in with the anthology I have been try
ing to put together for the last five years, which had
been tied up for various reasons. Thus, it all fit togeth
er with my unfinished plans and dreams, and hence the
compilation is named after the song — it's an album of
unfinished business.
I: How well did you know John Lennon?
DD: I knew him very little in the early days. In those
days, we would hang out after hours in clubs and such.
Musically, I didn't know him very well. We did a few
shows with the Beatles. I spoke with him on a few occa
sions — a few drunken occasions in night clubs. I did
n't know him particularly that well. However, I was a
great admirer of his work; he was the soul of the
Beatles.
I: The Kinks' early work obviously owes a great deal
to heavy R&B. How did you first get turned on to that
kind of music when you were a British teen-ageri
DD: I always loved music. My house was full of
music. Ray and I were the youngest of eight. We had six
older sisters who brought home different types of
music: Glenn Miller, Fats Domino, Elvis. I started to
really get interested in the guitar from listening to

Duane Eddy and Big Bill Broonzy. My brother-in-law,
who was an accomplished guitarist, introduced me to
Broonzy and Django Reinhardt, and I fell in love with
the guitar.
I: How did you learn to play?
DD: Picking up lines and things. A few chords here
and there. I tried to copy it mostly by ear.
I: How supportive were your parents?
DD: Fortunately, my parents were very supportive
of me taking up the guitar. A lot of my friends at school
had a tremendous amount of academic work to do, but
I think because we were a poor, working-class family,
my parents saw the guitar as something for me to do. I
was a pretty wild kid.
I: In your mind, which Kinks album stands out
most from the '60s?
DD: I always thought "Arthur" was a really special
case. 1 always loved that record. I thought we were real
ly set on our path when we did that album. I really
enjoyed it just as a musician. Overall, I thought it was
an exceptional piece of work. It wasn't really well
received in England although it eventually caught on in
America. I was just so into music — I've always loved
good songs. That's why I liked Buddy Holly the same
way I liked Duane Eddy and Eddie Cochran.
I: I hear a lot of Chuck Berry in your work.
DD: Oh absolutely. I'm sure credit has been given to
Chuck Berry by now. He's probably inspired more
musicians of my era than anybody else. Lyrically, I'm
sure that Dylan was influenced by him, with his flow
ing lyrics and observations. Plus, he's such a great gui
tarist. I think everybody uses his guitar playing.

I: Were you influenced by

Bo Diddley?
DD: Yeah, but in a

different way. We

were influenced by i

all of these people.

Diddley, Muddy

Waters particu-

larly, Big Bill

Broonzy as

t i on e d .'
John Lee

Hooker was a
big influence.


We were hungry for that kind of music. We wanted music that
was more soulful and interesting. We didn't really like jazz that
much, although I liked Reinhardt. We wanted something we
could sink out teeth into, something we could do ourselves. We
could copy it easier.
I: Getting back to "Arthur," how did you react when, shortly
afterwards, the Who released their own rock opera, "Tommy?"
DD: Although I respect their work, I think that they tried to
copy our music and what we were doing. I still would challenge
Pete Townshend to tell us what "Tommy" is about — I'm sure
that he doesn't even know. I think that when they realized that
we had a rock opera album, they thought maybe they should do
that as well. I don't want to take anything away from the Who.
They're a great band, and they've done tremendous work.
However, I believe they took "Tommy" from "Arthur," which is a
bit sad for us since it took a lot of attention away from our work.
I: The sound behind "You Really Got Me" has been credited
with inventing the power chord, which has led to heavy metal,
hard rock and punli Which bands have best captured the sound
and the spirit of the early Kinks?
DD: I think definitely bands like the Clash and the Jam. In a
slightly different way, bands like the Black Crowes, although it's
very American, very scruffy sounding. I see our influence lots of
different ways. Everything is derivative of something after all. We
were trying to emulate blues musicians.
I: How did you react to punk when it emerged in England in
1977?
DD: I loved it. I felt it put things back to the way they should
be. It was aggressive. In the mid-'70s, that was a really bleak peri
od from 1970 to 1976, pop and rock music was generally a bit
limp, too drug-oriented. You would get a lot of American bands
dressing up and smoking pot. There were a lot of weird things
going on in music at the time, and punk was a shot in the arm
even though it may or may not have been contrived. Someone
had to contrive it at any rate.

I: What did you think of the British new wave which followed
punki
DD: I liked Graham Parker. He was great. Elvis Costello was
interesting. Squeeze was supposed to be a mixture of the Beatles,
the Kinks and the new wave. They were a little more risque than
the Beatles — more like what the Kinks would do. It was an
interesting period, but I wasn't a particularly huge fan. Joe
Jackson was very good; he had a nice jazz flavor. Have you seen
that movie "200 Cigarettes"? It's got a lot of humor and pathos.
I just thought of it because Elvis Costello plays a necrophiliac in
the movie.
I: What contemporary music excites you today? Who is push
ing the envelopel
DD: I really like Beck. He's very talented and has an interest
ing sense of humor. I think humor is very important. Having
said that, I really like Rage Against The Machine. They have a
nice, dirty sound. I think Korn is good. There's a lot of good
music out there. I kind of like this wave of guitar-based rock with
some synths mixed in as well.
I: So what did you think of your brother's book, "X-Ray"?
DD: I thought it was amusing and very typical of Ray to want
so dearly to speak the truth, but he couldn't do it and turned it
into a third-person fantasy. I was kind of relieved because I want
ed my book, "Kink," to be more of a document. I tried to keep it
humorous and clear up a few misunderstandings about our past.
I: What is the current state of the Kinks?
DD: We've got a lot of re-issue albums coming out. I could
certainly see us doing another album and some shows. Right
now, I've got a great young band I'm touring with for my anthol
ogy. We might do a new album with new material this year.

released as singles. At the beginning of the '80s, Dave also
produced three full solo albums.
Dave has now released an appropriately idiosyncratic
anthology entitled "Unfinished Business: Dave Davies
Kronikles, 1963-1998." The two-disc set charts his best
songs and performances with the Kinks, highlights from
his '80s albums and re-recordings of his '60s solo singles,

which are currently tied up in legal knots. The compila
tion also contains a new song titled "Unfinished
Business."
Dave and his band are currently touring to promote
the new anthology. They are appearing tomorrow at San
Jose's Cactus Club and Saturday at Slim's in San
Francisco.
Intermission: What is the story behind the song
"Unfinished Business?"
Dave Davies: For some years, since my early 20s,
I've been interested in psychic phenomenon, spiritual
ism and the afterworld. I've also had a number of psy
chic experiences throughout my early years. I got
together with an old, dear friend of mine, Dr. Richard
Lawrence, a psychic researcher in England, in March
1996 at a restaurant in London when Richard sensed
the presence of John Lennon, and immediately, I heard
his voice and started writing down "Unfinished
Business." It's not really channeling, it's more like a
three-way psychic communion. It lasted on and off for
about two weeks. After the initial contact, I started to
realize things about my own unfinished business, like
what I wanted to do and, in a global sense, how every
one has their own unfinished business. The song sort
of grew out of those feelings and that experience.
Within three weeks, I had the song finished and mas
tered. It all tied in with the anthology I have been try
ing to put together for the last five years, which had
been tied up for various reasons. Thus, it all fit togeth
er with my unfinished plans and dreams, and hence the
compilation is named after the song — it's an album of
unfinished business.
I: How well did you know John Lennon?
DD: I knew him very little in the early days. In those
days, we would hang out after hours in clubs and such.
Musically, I didn't know him very well. We did a few
shows with the Beatles. I spoke with him on a few occa
sions — a few drunken occasions in night clubs. I did
n't know him particularly that well. However, I was a
great admirer of his work; he was the soul of the
Beatles.
I: The Kinks' early work obviously owes a great deal
to heavy R&B. How did you first get turned on to that
kind of music when you were a British teen-ageri
DD: I always loved music. My house was full of
music. Ray and I were the youngest of eight. We had six
older sisters who brought home different types of
music: Glenn Miller, Fats Domino, Elvis. I started to
really get interested in the guitar from listening to

Duane Eddy and Big Bill Broonzy. My brother-in-law,
who was an accomplished guitarist, introduced me to
Broonzy and Django Reinhardt, and I fell in love with
the guitar.
I: How did you learn to play?
DD: Picking up lines and things. A few chords here
and there. I tried to copy it mostly by ear.
I: How supportive were your parents?
DD: Fortunately, my parents were very supportive
of me taking up the guitar. A lot of my friends at school
had a tremendous amount of academic work to do, but
I think because we were a poor, working-class family,
my parents saw the guitar as something for me to do. I
was a pretty wild kid.
I: In your mind, which Kinks album stands out
most from the '60s?
DD: I always thought "Arthur" was a really special
case. 1 always loved that record. I thought we were real
ly set on our path when we did that album. I really
enjoyed it just as a musician. Overall, I thought it was
an exceptional piece of work. It wasn't really well
received in England although it eventually caught on in
America. I was just so into music — I've always loved
good songs. That's why I liked Buddy Holly the same
way I liked Duane Eddy and Eddie Cochran.
I: I hear a lot of Chuck Berry in your work.
DD: Oh absolutely. I'm sure credit has been given to
Chuck Berry by now. He's probably inspired more
musicians of my era than anybody else. Lyrically, I'm
sure that Dylan was influenced by him, with his flow
ing lyrics and observations. Plus, he's such a great gui
tarist. I think everybody uses his guitar playing.

I: Were you influenced by

Bo Diddley?
DD: Yeah, but in a

different way. We

were influenced by i

all of these people.

We were hungry for that kind of music. We wanted music that
was more soulful and interesting. We didn't really like jazz that
much, although I liked Reinhardt. We wanted something we
could sink out teeth into, something we could do ourselves. We
could copy it easier.
I: Getting back to "Arthur," how did you react when, shortly
afterwards, the Who released their own rock opera, "Tommy?"
DD: Although I respect their work, I think that they tried to
copy our music and what we were doing. I still would challenge
Pete Townshend to tell us what "Tommy" is about — I'm sure
that he doesn't even know. I think that when they realized that
we had a rock opera album, they thought maybe they should do
that as well. I don't want to take anything away from the Who.
They're a great band, and they've done tremendous work.
However, I believe they took "Tommy" from "Arthur," which is a
bit sad for us since it took a lot of attention away from our work.
I: The sound behind "You Really Got Me" has been credited
with inventing the power chord, which has led to heavy metal,
hard rock and punli Which bands have best captured the sound
and the spirit of the early Kinks?
DD: I think definitely bands like the Clash and the Jam. In a
slightly different way, bands like the Black Crowes, although it's
very American, very scruffy sounding. I see our influence lots of
different ways. Everything is derivative of something after all. We
were trying to emulate blues musicians.
I: How did you react to punk when it emerged in England in
1977?
DD: I loved it. I felt it put things back to the way they should
be. It was aggressive. In the mid-'70s, that was a really bleak peri
od from 1970 to 1976, pop and rock music was generally a bit
limp, too drug-oriented. You would get a lot of American bands
dressing up and smoking pot. There were a lot of weird things
going on in music at the time, and punk was a shot in the arm
even though it may or may not have been contrived. Someone
had to contrive it at any rate.

I: What did you think of the British new wave which followed
punki
DD: I liked Graham Parker. He was great. Elvis Costello was
interesting. Squeeze was supposed to be a mixture of the Beatles,
the Kinks and the new wave. They were a little more risque than
the Beatles — more like what the Kinks would do. It was an
interesting period, but I wasn't a particularly huge fan. Joe
Jackson was very good; he had a nice jazz flavor. Have you seen
that movie "200 Cigarettes"? It's got a lot of humor and pathos.
I just thought of it because Elvis Costello plays a necrophiliac in
the movie.
I: What contemporary music excites you today? Who is push
ing the envelopel
DD: I really like Beck. He's very talented and has an interest
ing sense of humor. I think humor is very important. Having
said that, I really like Rage Against The Machine. They have a
nice, dirty sound. I think Korn is good. There's a lot of good
music out there. I kind of like this wave of guitar-based rock with
some synths mixed in as well.
I: So what did you think of your brother's book, "X-Ray"?
DD: I thought it was amusing and very typical of Ray to want
so dearly to speak the truth, but he couldn't do it and turned it
into a third-person fantasy. I was kind of relieved because I want
ed my book, "Kink," to be more of a document. I tried to keep it
humorous and clear up a few misunderstandings about our past.
I: What is the current state of the Kinks?
DD: We've got a lot of re-issue albums coming out. I could
certainly see us doing another album and some shows. Right
now, I've got a great young band I'm touring with for my anthol
ogy. We might do a new album with new material this year.

112 e ma ) or bands from the first British Invasion,
f/yj the Kinks were by far the most enigmatic.
\ / Although they started out as proto-punks, doing
wild, super-charged R&B, by the end of the decade, they
were quietly singing the praises of "little shops, china cups
and virginity." Then, of course, as the '70s began, their
next big hit was about a transvestite ("Lola").
These wild shifts largely followed the mood swings of
the Kinks' lead singer and primary songwriter, Ray
Davies. However, like so many other of their contempo
raries, the Kinks relied on a secondary singer and writer,
Ray's younger brother, Dave. Some of Dave's best songs,
such as "Death Of A Clown" and "Trust Your Heart,"
stand out as highlights of the Kinks' catalog. Further,
Dave was the group's lead guitarist, and his pioneering
use of distortion on their first hit, "You Really Got Me,"
changed the vocabulary of rock V roll.
Although the Kinks have recorded for four decades,
Dave has maintained an intermittent solo career through
the years. During the '60s, a number of Dave's songs, such
as "Lincoln County" and "Suzannah's Still Alive," were
released as singles. At the beginning of the '80s, Dave also
produced three full solo albums.
Dave has now released an appropriately idiosyncratic
anthology entitled "Unfinished Business: Dave Davies
