# COVER STORY
## "Do Re Mi Lo Fi No No No": Sebadoh finds a new drummer and, oh yeah, cohesion.

ntropy. The law of diminishing returns. Things fall apart. A
lot of cool people over time have discovered how delightful
fragments can be. Unfinished masterpieces like the Beach
Boys' "Smile" have twofold appeal: you can enjoy what bits did sur
vive and fantasize about what the final shape would have been.
In the '90s, a few brilliant rock artists discovered that such acci
dents of history did not necessarily have to be that accidental. On the
forefront has always been Sebadoh, who rely on a few principles of
planned accidents. Perhaps the most distinctive has been its "10-fi"
(short for "low-fidelity") recording style. At its best, 10-fi sounds like
a magical but distant radio transmission or a well-worn bootleg:
music for people who love music. Lo-fi is a wanking critic's term, but
it does get the idea across of the freedom to express music outside of
expensive 1024-track digital studios.
That freedom approaches another of Sebadoh's principles:
democracy. But before we get to that, 10-fi does beg the question (as
with so many of rock's radical style shifts), what can we possibly do
next? You can't sift through the fragments forever, can you? What
does a band do after 10 years of 10-fi? Sebadoh fortunately has sup
plied a correct answer for us in its new album, "The Sebadoh": cohe
sion.

"No hazing has happened." But he still does know his place in a
band with such a fervent and enduring following:
"I had like seven different songs I wanted to put on the record,
but then I was like, wait a minute. 1 better not do that. It's not a
good idea." So the world will apparently have to wait to feel the full
force of the Russ Pollard Lo-Fi Explosion. Or will it? "I'm going to
make sure that Barlow only gets one on the next, and I'm going to
get eight." And the fans? "I would get lynched." Smart lad. While
they're not 'N Sync or anything, being in Sebadoh does have its
perks: "When 1 first saw that we were travelling in a bus, I was like,
whoa, totally blown away. I'm going to ride in that? Wow." His
excitement is just so darn infectious, you can't help but be enthusi
astic.
On a more serious note, joining Sebadoh has meant that he is
now able to do just music full-time. Though the culmination of a
long-running desire, adjusting to being a rock star (well, kind of)
has been weird for him: "At first, you're like, what do I do, what do
I do? You feel like, 'I should have a job.' But then when you figure
out how to manage your time — figure out how to do the things
you really want to do, and consider that your job, that is totally grat
ifying — especially when you've been so pent up and pissed off for
the past three years because you're not able to do that."

So back to democracy, which has been a dominant principle in
Sebadoh since its genesis in the late '80s. This fact has generally been
traced to Lou Barlow's stint as bassist in the dictatorially structured
Dinosaur Jr. In any case, despite the heaps of (justified) praise for
Barlow's songs, Sebadoh albums have always, whatever the line-up,
featured a roughly equal number of contributions from its members.
The current line-up consists of Barlow on guitar, Jason Loewenstein
(who has been on board since "III" in 1991) and newcomer Russ
Pollard on drums.
But the truth is that Sebadoh's democracy, though always charm
ing, has not produced the most coherent of albums. In the past,
albums were more like sprawling compilations of solo efforts.
"Bubble and Scrape" (1993) for example, contained brilliant songs
from all three members, but without really much connection in the
sound. The liner notes revealed that Loewenstein did the guitar, bass,
drum and vocal parts on his songs, with Barlow only contributing
with another guitar part on one song.
Barlow's tracks, on the other hand, just featured himself on guitar
and vocals, with the others doing the rest of the chores; it seems that
he has always been the strongest proponent of the democratic sys
tem. When the press was calling for more of his songs on Sebadoh

While not Phish, Sebadoh does have its own following, and it has
been around for quite some time. Still, in this decade, there is
always contention about credibility, selling out, indie, blah blah
blah. Though Sebadoh has never really seen MTV rotation (occa
sional "120 Minutes" spots notwithstanding), a project Barlow was
in with his friend John Davis, called Folk Implosion, had a rather
sizable hit in 1995 with "Natural One" from the "Kids" soundtrack.
The possibility of mainstream success thus raised, sessions for the
following Sebadoh record, "Harmacy," released in 19%, were a bit
tense. For this album, the band attempted to concentrate more fully
on the creative side of things:
"The way that record turned out really had the least to do with
outside forces of any of our..Loewenstein pauses. "Well, not any
of our records, but there was a little bit of tension around us dur
ing 'Harmacy,' just because the hype of 'Natural One' was getting
some notoriety — people were being conscious of their peers in the
industry. The people at Sub Pop (Sebadoh's label) I'm sure had
some pressure to turn that opportunity into some kind of gold
mine. It's kind of unrealistic, you know. I think what we learned
from that was that we take care of business a lot better when we're
not interrupted. So we make sure that that happens, you know? I
think we would have made more clearer-sounding records if we had

albums, Barlow told everyone they should just accept the albums for
what they were or make mix tapes of their favorite songs. That sort
of anti-rock star behavior makes him even more enduring, of
course, but it also suggests the strength of the bonds in the band.
For his part, Loewenstein has been very appreciative of the band's
unique dynamic. "I never expected [Barlow] to stick up for me like
that. I do know that he enjoys playing all sorts of music. He enjoys
accompanying me on my material as well, and for the most part
always has."
These days, the democratic aspect has taken a new turn towards
increasing collaboration. Though Barlow and Loewenstein each
have an equal number of songs on the new album, "The Sebadoh"
seems less schizophrenic than previous efforts.
"I feel like I'm writing better stuff," Loewenstein said. "But I'm
also really open to letting people help me change around things
completely. Barlow really likes to contribute. I think the only thing
that would have bummed him out before was that I might have sort
of been inhibiting his ability to contribute. You know, it was more
like, 'Don't tell me what to do.' I think at this point I'm really just
trying to get more people to help. It's bigger than the sum of its
parts."

just applied ourselves before."
The death of 10-fi, then? It's not that "The Sebadoh" is slick. It does
have a meatier production sound than before. The addition of Pollard
probably helps in this regard as well. He's very steady and harder than
were Eric Gaffney or Bob Fay, his predecessors. One can't help but
notice the kick that he adds to an already very peppy Barlow compo
sition like "Flame." On first listen, the intro sounds like the Stone
Roses. As a first single, it's a perfect choice and has gotten decent
amounts of exposure. I was rather surprised to hear it at Popscene,
the weekly Britpop night at the Ritch Street Club in San Francisco.
Suede, Pulp, Blur — and Sebadoh?
Oh, why not? Especially in 1999. Rock has to fight for anything it
can get, now that everyone has gotten into a froth declaring it dead
once again. All right, I'm off the soapbox, but I guess talking to
Loewenstein made me painfully aware how much things have
changed. In the '80s, you could still make that distinction. But now?
"I think it made more sense back then," said Loewenstein, who has
seen all of this nonsense happen before. "Although it's really funny,
Barlow's been bringing up lately that Eric Gaffney once said to him
that he thought it was insanely ridiculous to classify music by what
label it came out on. That makes a lot of sense to me — there are just
so many different kinds of music out there. Indie rock definitely has

Part of this new cohesion might also result from the addition of
Pollard on drums. The previous drummer, Bob Fay, contributed
instrumentals that were oblique and charming for what they were,
but did nothing to really sew the fabric of the albums together.
Pollard only has one song on "The Sebadoh," called "Break Free,"
and well, it fits right in, sounding rather a lot like Barlow or even
Guided by Voices.
Ah, the burning question. Is Russ Pollard related to Bob Pollard
of Guided by Voices?
"No," he said.
Damn.
"We've been lying about that, saying he's my dad or my uncle."
Ah, those indie-rock pranks. Expect only the truth from this hard
hitting publication.
Indie-rock lineage or not, Pollard is relatively young (24) and has
known Loewenstein for a few years (they both live in Louisville,
Kent.). That must help, but still, what is it like joining a band with
so much history? "Oh, it's so good. It's great. Everything is, you
know — it's hard to answer that sort of question without sounding
like an idiot. I love it! Everything is great!"
Apparently Barlow and Loewenstein have been easy on the boy:

to do with a sound now, at least as far as a term goes. In general, it's a
pretty unusable word. Back in the day, it really meant only that it
came out on an independent label."
And next?
Though Sebadoh is still on Sub Pop, "The Sebadoh" has also
received help in distribution and promotion from Sire. "We're going
to try it as an experiment," Loewenstein said. One more album is due
for Sub Pop, but it's not supposed to be new material. It was original
ly supposed to be a compilation, but now the band seems to be lean
ing more towards a live album.
Don't expect "Sebadoh Comes Alive" or anything like that. The
band still isn't into "over-produced stuff." It might even feature audi
ence recordings, because as Loewenstein says, "Sometimes a really
shitty audience tape has a lot of character, depending on all the vari
ables: where the guy's standing and what kind of a night we're having.
It could sound way better than a digital board tape off the mixer and
stuff. It could have a lot more character."
And isn't that the most important thing?

ing more towards a live album.
Don't expect "Sebadoh Comes Alive" or anything like that. The
band still isn't into "over-produced stuff." It might even feature audi
ence recordings, because as Loewenstein says, "Sometimes a really
shitty audience tape has a lot of character, depending on all the vari
ables: where the guy's standing and what kind of a night we're having.
It could sound way better than a digital board tape off the mixer and
stuff. It could have a lot more character."
And isn't that the most important thing?

ntropy. The law of diminishing returns. Things fall apart. A
lot of cool people over time have discovered how delightful
fragments can be. Unfinished masterpieces like the Beach
Boys' "Smile" have twofold appeal: you can enjoy what bits did sur
vive and fantasize about what the final shape would have been.
In the '90s, a few brilliant rock artists discovered that such acci
dents of history did not necessarily have to be that accidental. On the
forefront has always been Sebadoh, who rely on a few principles of
planned accidents. Perhaps the most distinctive has been its "10-fi"
(short for "low-fidelity") recording style. At its best, 10-fi sounds like
a magical but distant radio transmission or a well-worn bootleg:
music for people who love music. Lo-fi is a wanking critic's term, but
it does get the idea across of the freedom to express music outside of
expensive 1024-track digital studios.
That freedom approaches another of Sebadoh's principles:
democracy. But before we get to that, 10-fi does beg the question (as
with so many of rock's radical style shifts), what can we possibly do
next? You can't sift through the fragments forever, can you? What
does a band do after 10 years of 10-fi? Sebadoh fortunately has sup
plied a correct answer for us in its new album, "The Sebadoh": cohe
sion.

"No hazing has happened." But he still does know his place in a
band with such a fervent and enduring following:
"I had like seven different songs I wanted to put on the record,
but then I was like, wait a minute. 1 better not do that. It's not a
good idea." So the world will apparently have to wait to feel the full
force of the Russ Pollard Lo-Fi Explosion. Or will it? "I'm going to
make sure that Barlow only gets one on the next, and I'm going to
get eight." And the fans? "I would get lynched." Smart lad. While
they're not 'N Sync or anything, being in Sebadoh does have its
perks: "When 1 first saw that we were travelling in a bus, I was like,
whoa, totally blown away. I'm going to ride in that? Wow." His
excitement is just so darn infectious, you can't help but be enthusi
astic.
On a more serious note, joining Sebadoh has meant that he is
now able to do just music full-time. Though the culmination of a
long-running desire, adjusting to being a rock star (well, kind of)
has been weird for him: "At first, you're like, what do I do, what do
I do? You feel like, 'I should have a job.' But then when you figure
out how to manage your time — figure out how to do the things
you really want to do, and consider that your job, that is totally grat
ifying — especially when you've been so pent up and pissed off for
the past three years because you're not able to do that."

So back to democracy, which has been a dominant principle in
Sebadoh since its genesis in the late '80s. This fact has generally been
traced to Lou Barlow's stint as bassist in the dictatorially structured
Dinosaur Jr. In any case, despite the heaps of (justified) praise for
Barlow's songs, Sebadoh albums have always, whatever the line-up,
featured a roughly equal number of contributions from its members.
The current line-up consists of Barlow on guitar, Jason Loewenstein
(who has been on board since "III" in 1991) and newcomer Russ
Pollard on drums.
But the truth is that Sebadoh's democracy, though always charm
ing, has not produced the most coherent of albums. In the past,
albums were more like sprawling compilations of solo efforts.
"Bubble and Scrape" (1993) for example, contained brilliant songs
from all three members, but without really much connection in the
sound. The liner notes revealed that Loewenstein did the guitar, bass,
drum and vocal parts on his songs, with Barlow only contributing
with another guitar part on one song.
Barlow's tracks, on the other hand, just featured himself on guitar
and vocals, with the others doing the rest of the chores; it seems that
he has always been the strongest proponent of the democratic sys
tem. When the press was calling for more of his songs on Sebadoh

While not Phish, Sebadoh does have its own following, and it has
been around for quite some time. Still, in this decade, there is
always contention about credibility, selling out, indie, blah blah
blah. Though Sebadoh has never really seen MTV rotation (occa
sional "120 Minutes" spots notwithstanding), a project Barlow was
in with his friend John Davis, called Folk Implosion, had a rather
sizable hit in 1995 with "Natural One" from the "Kids" soundtrack.
The possibility of mainstream success thus raised, sessions for the
following Sebadoh record, "Harmacy," released in 19%, were a bit
tense. For this album, the band attempted to concentrate more fully
on the creative side of things:
"The way that record turned out really had the least to do with
outside forces of any of our..Loewenstein pauses. "Well, not any
of our records, but there was a little bit of tension around us dur
ing 'Harmacy,' just because the hype of 'Natural One' was getting
some notoriety — people were being conscious of their peers in the
industry. The people at Sub Pop (Sebadoh's label) I'm sure had
some pressure to turn that opportunity into some kind of gold
mine. It's kind of unrealistic, you know. I think what we learned
from that was that we take care of business a lot better when we're
not interrupted. So we make sure that that happens, you know? I
think we would have made more clearer-sounding records if we had

albums, Barlow told everyone they should just accept the albums for
what they were or make mix tapes of their favorite songs. That sort
of anti-rock star behavior makes him even more enduring, of
course, but it also suggests the strength of the bonds in the band.
For his part, Loewenstein has been very appreciative of the band's
unique dynamic. "I never expected [Barlow] to stick up for me like
that. I do know that he enjoys playing all sorts of music. He enjoys
accompanying me on my material as well, and for the most part
always has."
These days, the democratic aspect has taken a new turn towards
increasing collaboration. Though Barlow and Loewenstein each
have an equal number of songs on the new album, "The Sebadoh"
seems less schizophrenic than previous efforts.
"I feel like I'm writing better stuff," Loewenstein said. "But I'm
also really open to letting people help me change around things
completely. Barlow really likes to contribute. I think the only thing
that would have bummed him out before was that I might have sort
of been inhibiting his ability to contribute. You know, it was more
like, 'Don't tell me what to do.' I think at this point I'm really just
trying to get more people to help. It's bigger than the sum of its
parts."

just applied ourselves before."
The death of 10-fi, then? It's not that "The Sebadoh" is slick. It does
have a meatier production sound than before. The addition of Pollard
probably helps in this regard as well. He's very steady and harder than
were Eric Gaffney or Bob Fay, his predecessors. One can't help but
notice the kick that he adds to an already very peppy Barlow compo
sition like "Flame." On first listen, the intro sounds like the Stone
Roses. As a first single, it's a perfect choice and has gotten decent
amounts of exposure. I was rather surprised to hear it at Popscene,
the weekly Britpop night at the Ritch Street Club in San Francisco.
Suede, Pulp, Blur — and Sebadoh?
Oh, why not? Especially in 1999. Rock has to fight for anything it
can get, now that everyone has gotten into a froth declaring it dead
once again. All right, I'm off the soapbox, but I guess talking to
Loewenstein made me painfully aware how much things have
changed. In the '80s, you could still make that distinction. But now?
"I think it made more sense back then," said Loewenstein, who has
seen all of this nonsense happen before. "Although it's really funny,
Barlow's been bringing up lately that Eric Gaffney once said to him
that he thought it was insanely ridiculous to classify music by what
label it came out on. That makes a lot of sense to me — there are just
so many different kinds of music out there. Indie rock definitely has

Part of this new cohesion might also result from the addition of
Pollard on drums. The previous drummer, Bob Fay, contributed
instrumentals that were oblique and charming for what they were,
but did nothing to really sew the fabric of the albums together.
Pollard only has one song on "The Sebadoh," called "Break Free,"
and well, it fits right in, sounding rather a lot like Barlow or even
Guided by Voices.
Ah, the burning question. Is Russ Pollard related to Bob Pollard
of Guided by Voices?
"No," he said.
Damn.
"We've been lying about that, saying he's my dad or my uncle."
Ah, those indie-rock pranks. Expect only the truth from this hard
hitting publication.
Indie-rock lineage or not, Pollard is relatively young (24) and has
known Loewenstein for a few years (they both live in Louisville,
Kent.). That must help, but still, what is it like joining a band with
so much history? "Oh, it's so good. It's great. Everything is, you
know — it's hard to answer that sort of question without sounding
like an idiot. I love it! Everything is great!"
Apparently Barlow and Loewenstein have been easy on the boy:

to do with a sound now, at least as far as a term goes. In general, it's a
pretty unusable word. Back in the day, it really meant only that it
came out on an independent label."
And next?
Though Sebadoh is still on Sub Pop, "The Sebadoh" has also
received help in distribution and promotion from Sire. "We're going
to try it as an experiment," Loewenstein said. One more album is due
for Sub Pop, but it's not supposed to be new material. It was original
ly supposed to be a compilation, but now the band seems to be lean
ing more towards a live album.
Don't expect "Sebadoh Comes Alive" or anything like that. The

ence recordings, because as Loewenstein says, "Sometimes a really
