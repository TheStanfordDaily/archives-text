## A 						'DEEP' WELL OF TEARS Pfeiffer's latest has its moments 
### 
Deep End of the Ocean," star-
OXf ring Michelle Pfeiffer and
Whoopi Goldberg, sometimes
plays too heavily with the heart. It makes you

consider what it would be like
both to lose a child and then
to have that child return years
later. It's tough on the family;
it's tough on the kidnapped
victim; it's tough on the task
force assigned to the crime. It
can even be tough on the
audience when they must
endure moments of long-

winded and weepy
melodrama.

Pfeiffer has to cry a
lot as Beth Cappa-

Dora, the mother who
unwittingly leaves

her two young chil
dren alone at a

class reunion. I
understand

that she had
to check

into the
hotel and
that she
was tired
of hearing
her kids
complain
about the
oppres-

sive Chicago heat, but this lapse of judgment
appears unlikely given her character.
Nonetheless, Beth must carry the weight bf
knowing that she is essentially at fault for los
ing young Ben, and Vincent has the shame of
realizing that he let go of his younger brother's
hand against mommy's orders.
Goldberg plays a lesbian head police detec
tive who offers some comedy and plenty of
consoling to Beth. Goldberg's character, Candy
Bliss, never really develops beyond the fact that
she works hard. But we pull for her to get a
break and find Ben.
The film naturally progresses to the point
when Ben returns, though now he is named
Sam Karras (Ryan Merriman). Sam is rather
unemotional when it comes to his real
family — all he knows is that he truly loves his
father, George (John Kapelos). Vincent, now
grown up, has a perpetual scowl on his face, as
he never feels loved by his parents and
Ben / Sam.
Will the Cappadora family reunite? Will
Whoopi ever leave the workplace? Will Pat, the
father, show any emotion? These questions and
more are answered during the short-but-feels
long "Deep End," based on a Jacquelyn
Mitchard novel. Despite Pfeiffer's quality per
formance, the heavy-handedness of the film
becomes overwhelming and ultimately hurts its
authenticity. Check out the far superior
"Ransom" instead.
