# 'FORCES' GONE AWRY
## Bullock and Afflect can't save this drowning movie 
### 
o rces Nature" quickly becomes too ridicu
lous to believe. Only those who can com
pletely suspend rationality and comprehen
sion will be able to stomach what may turn out to be the
most sadly misguided romantic comedy of the year.

As the depressed and unloved
Sarah, Sandra Bullock finds her
self in another movie outside of
the action genre that brought her
fame ("Speed"). This time her
love interest is Ben (Ben Affleck,
"Armageddon").
Sadly, Sarah and Ben have to

journey to Savannah, Ga., without the use of a plane. You
see, the plane was shut down because of a bizarre incident
with a flock of birds. So, the twosome hitches a ride with a
stranger so that Ben can make it to his wedding, and Sarah
can meet her ex-husband.

Ben is getting married to Bridget (Maura Tierney), a
really caring person who spends the whole movie wonder
ing aloud where her beloved Ben is. Tierney is good as the
Doting Wife, but she was given a far better version of the
role in "Liar, Liar" as Jim Carrey's spouse.
I would not be surprised if you, the intelligent reader,
could guess how many foolish antics Ben and Sarah go
through on their way from New York to Georgia. But here
is a sampling anyway: there's a strip show, a chance meet
ing with Ben's Best Man at a roadside hotel and a drawn
out act in which Ben pretends to be a respectable doctor.
I really got angry at director Bronwen Hughes and writer
Marc Lawrence for manipulating the audience. Given the
acting talent, "Forces of Nature" should have been a roman
tic comedy of relaxed inhibitions and cleverly solved prob
lems. Instead, plot holes, inane dialogue and poor music
plague the movie from start to finish.
