# DANCE, LOVE, LIGHT AND SHADOW
## 'Tango' brings dance film to Argentina 
### 
of the blue and overnight, it seems, ballroom and social dance have
ffyj swept Stanford. The Viennese Ball was packed, swing's the thing and
the line to get into dance classes earlier this week started forming at 6
p.m. the night before. "Will the madness ever end?" you ask. Not if the film
industry has its way.
Over the past few years, movies have embraced dance like never before.
Unlike the great musicals of the '50s, which used song and dance to tell their
stories, the new dance film is the drama of the dance and the dancers, the ago
nies and ecstasies that go into preparing an exhilarating performance.
Australia did it with "Strictly Ballroom." Japan did it with "Shall We Dance"
Hollywood tried to do it with "Dance with Me." And now Argentina has
adopted the formula, with "Tango," nominated last month for a Best Foreign
Picture Oscar.
"Tango" centers around the creation, rehearsal and production of a tango
show in Buenos Aires. The show is the creative spawn of Mario Suarez
(Miguel Angel Sola), one of the country's most famous tango artists and an
occasional filmmaker. As the film opens, in the first of a handful of provoca
tive self-reflective scenes, Mario narrates from his own screenplay as the cam
era shows us his visions in real-time. From an aerial landscape of Buenos
Aires, we are drawn into Mario's apartment where, tired and seemingly spent
from a leg injury, he lies down to rest only to have a jealous nightmare about
his recently estranged wife, and a tango she dances with her new lover.
Within the nightmare, Mario is driven to murder Laura, a move which fore
shadows tlic violence and passion of the dancers and their chosen form of
artistic expression.
After this initial introduction, the film centers exclusively on the backstage
drama of the show's production. Before the audition for the lead dancers,
Mario is approached by one of the chief financiers of the show, a mafia boss,
who asks Mario to allow his young mistress Elena (Mia Maestro) an audition.

It is clear that Elena, young, beautiful and a phenomenal dancer, would have
made her mark on Mario even without such fortunate connections.

What follows is a narration of romance and its
trappings: desire, jealousy, love, passion, confusion
and frustration. The inevitable relationship between
Mario and Elena is told most eloquently by the fan
tastic dance sequences, which show off not only the
difficulty of the dance and the artistry of the dancers
but the complexity and thought behind the artistic
process itself. Indeed, "Tango" is at its best when it

acknowledges the sanctity of the artistic vision and the precariousness of the
viewer's interpretation, constantly referred to by the film's incorporation of
dance, mutli-media, and historical-political references to Argentina's revolu
tionary past.
The script wanders off-track only during a dinner scene between the two
lovers. Attempting a discussion of why older men develop relationships with
younger women, the script falls into cliche, at least for an American audience
that is confronted with this theme far too often. This scene, with its tired dia
logue, seems an unwelcome aberration from the sexy, lyrical dance scenes and
seamlessness of the homage-plot prior to it.
Still, "Tango" is a realistic look at a blossoming love affair and a dramatic
take on the significance of art in the modern world. Although it didn't win the
Oscar, "Tango" proves that film can be a medium for art as well as entertain
ment, that such entertainment needs no script to carry a rich and powerful
weight and that movies tell not only the love stories between people but also
those between artists and their crafts.
