/;i Rice has been
secretly provid
ing advice to De
mocratic presi
dential candi
date Mill Bradley
while publicly
declaring her
support for Re
publican presi

dential hopeful and Texas (iov.
George \V. Mush. I he Daily has
learned.
A source with intimate knowl
edge of Rice's work provided The
Daily with copies ol telephone
records that show calls made from
Rice's office to Bradley's campaign
headquarters in New Ilampshire.
Rice's calls were always made
after ft p.m.. and the source said
Rice was overheard seyeral times
speaking quietly about Pastern Eu
rope at 10 p.m. to "someone she
called Senator.' "
RicC was unavailable for com
ment.
Bradley appealed at a press con
ference on national television and
stated. "I did not talk international
relations with that y\oman. Con
doleezza Rice." while wagging his
finger at the cameras.
Bush's oil ice released a state
ment declaring that the telephone

records must have been falsified
and calling the accusations the
work of a **vast anti-international
relations conspiracy."
Bush could not be reached for
comment, but his press secretary
stated that the governor will stand
by Rice as one of his top advisors.
The source who provided the
telephone records was unable to
suggest a possible motive for Rice's

infidelity to the Bush campaign.
But the source did state that
Rice was once overheard muttering
to herself, "Those Republicans
never spell my name right. It's two
z's! Why can't anyone ever get it
right?"
University President Gerhard
Casper expressed shock at the rev
elations. "I can't believe [Condi]
would do such a thing," he said in a

phone interview from the private
sauna in his office. "This makes me
wonder whether she's been doing
work for Harvard on the sly as
well."
It is still unclear whether Rice
may be subject to any sanctions for
her transgressions. The Faculty
Senate will convene an emergency
session tomorrow evening to dis
cuss the matter.
