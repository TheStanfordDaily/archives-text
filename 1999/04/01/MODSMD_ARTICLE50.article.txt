# ODE TO THE SUDDEN AND GRISLY DEATH OF 'WING COMMANDER'
## Just how bad can a movie be 
### 
{ \ t/s- i n g Commander" may be the worst movie I have ever

seen. Why? Oh, let me count the ways.
Reason #1: Freddie Prinze Jr. as Christopher Blair. Note to
Hollywood: please, please, please, for the love of all that is sacred,

do not give Prinze another starring role. He manages to screw up
every climactic scene in the entire movie. He can't do excitement,
he can't do sorrow, he can't do anger — in fact, the only thing he

can do is alternate between furrowing and raising his eyebrows.
Reason #2: Matthew Lillard as Todd "Maniac" Marshall.

"Scream" aside, this man should not get another role. Ever. In
"Wing," Marshall plays the same hyperactive adolescent

character he played in "Scream," but his cartoonish gri
maces are woefully inappropriate here. Sometimes I won-

/ r r r *
dered if his character was supposed to be drunk during the
entire movie. Sometimes I wondered if I was drunk when I

agreed to see this movie.

Reason #3: The writers. This was one of the most unintention
ally funny movies I have ever seen, next to "The Last Action Hero"

(although the jury's still out on whether that was unintentional).
The scene in which Blair saves the universe made the audience
laugh out loud. In this case, laughter is not a good sign. Another
winning moment belonged to David Suchet's ("Executive
Decision," "Bad Boys") character, Sansky. When Sansky tries to

give the job of saving the universe to Blair, Blair tells him he
doesn't have the faith in himself necessary to succeed. Sansky
replies: "It's not about faith. It's about genetics." Clearly, sur-

vival of the fittest does not apply in all

script-editing.

Reason #4: The plot. Chris Roberts,

who directed the movie, his debut after
a career in computer games, chose a
plot that may soon overtake the "love

story" as the most frequently
abused formula in cinema: the

"save-the-universe story." He should have stuck to computer
games, where the viewer might actually care about "making
the jump point" at the right speed and angle. After the fourth
jump point, the entire theater didn't give a damn that he made
the next one, even if it did save the world. (Oh no! I gave away
the ending!)

Sure, I gave the movie half of a star. jUrgen Prochnow
("Replacement Killers," "The English Patient") and Suchet
saved it from a zero with their chemistry. The two usually
play bad guys, and it was definitely fun to watch them go at
each other as good guys on the same side.

On the whole, though, this movie is a definite
miss. Give me your $7.50, and I will beat you over
the head with a stick; you will still have a better

time than you would have had watching this
movie.
