# TOO MANY 'DATES'
## The 						mockumentary format gets annoying 
### 
ff/Tk 0 Dates" is one tricky movie. The
opening credits begin innocently
enough, but soon thereafter a
bizarre monologue informs us that the film is
going to be a showcase for Myles Berkowitz,
writer, director and actor extraordinaire. Other
than a handful of cleverly inserted famous peo
ple, including actress Tia Carrere and

Hollywood veteran Robert McKee, this pseudo-documentary is a
wasted effort.
The premise — following a single guy around for 20 dates —
sounds promising enough, and we have seen it work in main
stream fare like "EdTV." Myles even displays moments of wit
while conveying insights about dating, in particular the self
absorbed dating scene of Los Angeles.
But he falters when trying to prove that his amateurish talents
are more than they appear to be. The clumsily inserted talks with
Myles' agent (Richard Arlook) and his love interest (Elisabeth
Wagner) usually fall flat and wind up interrupting the flow of the
thin plot. The few scenes that work involve Myles' financing pro
ducer, Elie. Elie gradually falls into debt as his filmmaker-to-be
stubbornly refuses to accept his advice that the movie needs big
breasted, beautiful female stars in order to succeed.
.The constant berating of Myles by his family and friends
makes it hard for the audience to want him to find his girlfriend
by the end of the 20th date. Myles isn't a likable guy, and he cer
tainly doesn't have the good looks or charm to compensate for
his shortcomings. In addition, the way he randomly propositions
women for dates right off the street, in front of a camera, auto
matically defuses any verity in "20 Dates."
Is Myles intentionally trying to show that his attempts to
reveal "true love" are no less realistic than other postmodern
romances like "Sleepless in Seattle?" I'm not really sure what
Myles is saying, other than the fact that almost any movie can get
funded nowadays as long as you have the right connections. A
clever idea can't hurt either but an annoying personality defi
nitely can.
