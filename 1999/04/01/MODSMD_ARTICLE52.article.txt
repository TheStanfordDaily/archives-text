"Mother, what are you doing?"
"Whistling."
"Whistling?"
"Yes, it's what I do when I'm afraid."
Let's get the necessary details out of the
way: Anna Leonowens is the protagonist of
"The King and I," an animated film based
on a Rogers and Hammerstein musical by
the same name. So it's no surprise when
she bursts into song, namely, "Whistle A
Happy 'Toon," after uttering the above
quote. The film is set in 1863, and the King
of Siam has sent for an English governess
(Anna) to educate his children in Western
ways. There's an evil Prime Minister,
Kralahome, and a bumbling sidekick,
Master Litde, to complicate matter, as well
as a mess of cute royal children for the
audience to bring close to their hearts.
After a clash of ideals and traditions,
mixed with some villainy and danger, they
all (the important characters at least) live
happily ever after. The cast includes
Miranda Richardson and Christiane Noll
as Anna, lan Richardson as the King and
Darrell Hammond as Master Little.
The musical and the original movie
have gone down in history as successful
and well-liked, winning numerous Tony
and Academy awards. In comparison, this
animated version, although technically
adequate — the singers were on tune, the
pictures were brightly colored and the

movie theatre in
which I watched
it has a great
sound system —
was unimpres
sive. I left the
screening empty

of emotion, as I suspect did the gangs of
chaperoned children that exited the theatre
along with me. Which brings me so neatly
to the (more obviously) opinionated por
tion of this review. It's an awful pun, but
"the King and I" is excruciatingly two
dimensional. Flat.
"The King and I" has all the pre
approved elements of an "animated clas
sic": good guys, bad guys, a few spunky
characters, a couple of innocents and a
translucent plot. So what? It's what the kids
like, right?
No, it's what they've been given. There's
no need to complicate things, necessarily.
The formula could benefit from, say, a lit
tle creativity or perhaps some accuracy —
what's usually known as "the truth."
Cultural and ethnic inaccuracies aside, the
movie does make a point of promoting
important ideas like tolerance and some
sort of equality — solid Platonic ideals. I
just didn't FEEL A GODDAMN THING. I
can't even muster the energy to make fun
of it or make some complaint about possi
ble racist or misogynistic overtones ... "et
cetera, et cetera."
