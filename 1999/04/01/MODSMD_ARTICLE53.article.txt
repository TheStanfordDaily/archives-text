## THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS Various Artists Drinking From Puddles (Kill Rock Stars) 
### 
rinking From Puddles" is a com
[fyM) pilation of live tracks from
Brandon Lieberman's influential
punk radio show on Portland's KBOO. Spanning
16 years of performances, "Drinking From
Puddles" provides a handy guide to the past two
decades of punk music.
Like any good punk compilation, the 22 tracks
can be divided into the three styles that define the
genre: straight-up loud punk, angry acoustic bal
lads and unlistenable tripe.
"Drinking From Puddles" is most successful in
the First category. The Murder City Devils comes
out swinging on the manic, Iggy Pop-esque
"Dance Flail Music" while Dead Moon's
"Graveyard" shows why Fred Cole is such a punk
legend. Soul Junk goes a bit more pop on "Sweet
To My Soul," which sounds like a bizarre hybrid
of Sublime and Rage Against the Machine.
However, the compilation's highlights are the
infectious "You're My Only One" by Cadallaca
(featuring Corin Tucker of Sleater-Kinney) and
the goof-punk "Mr. Magazine Man" by Flazel.
The only misstep in this bunch is "Song For Lon
Mabon" by Crackerbash, which is nothing more
than screaming for screaming's sake.
The ballads are more of a mixed bag. It's
always great to hear from Kristen Hersh and
Elliott Smith, but "Butch" by the Geraldine
Fibbers and Gilly Ann Flanner's "Outta Money"
are excruciating. Cat Power's somnambulant ren
dition of Pavement's "We Dance" is tedious and
unnecessary considering all of her excellent orig
inal material. There are a few outstanding tracks,
though. Come's "Hurricane" is wonderfully
intense, as is Madigan's beautiful punk-on-a
cello "Snowfell Summer." The best of all is
lefferey Lee Pierce's overwhelming "Lucky Jim,"
which sounds like a voice wailing from the end of
the world.
As for the unlistenable tripe, well, it's just that.
Prolapse's "Cacophany #A" is endurable, if only
for the singer's lilting Scottish accent, but it's
hard to imagine anybody sitting through any of
the three spoken-word pieces. Nicole Panter's
description of her sex life, "Fuck," can only be
described as "shocking," and it's downright

painful to listen to the pleasure in Pleasant
Gehman's voice as she enjoys the "irony" of her
description of Disneyland (always a difficult tar
get for irony).
The other main problem with "Drinking From
Puddles" is the sound quality. All of the tracks
sound as if they were recorded off of the radio,
and a few actually sound as if they were phoned
in. However, this doesn't detract much from
most of the performances, which are pretty raw
anyway. All in all, the album is a good sampler
and does an excellent job of showing the
strengths and weaknesses of the contemporary
punk scene.
