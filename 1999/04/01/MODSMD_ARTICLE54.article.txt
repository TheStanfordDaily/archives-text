## Push Comes to Love (Drag City) 
### 
the audience is a double-edged
L>y sword. On one hand, if future genera
tions redeem your work, you can have
the satisfaction of having been right when every
one thought you were wrong. On the other,
everyone thinks you're crap now and might think
so forever.
Why the lofty beginning? Well, Stephen Prina
is an artist. I'd hesitate to say visual artist, but the
press release I've got here says he does installa
tion pieces. Whatever. "Push Comes to Love"
(Drag City) ain't art, though it does have a cool
cover: 16 monochrome images in a grid, all but
one of animals about to fuck, with the other con
sisting of two beefy human males arm-wrestling.
Clever. The big tease on this album is that the
first song, "Cums for Shove," is great. It's a loopy
pop song full of great puns about pushing,
pulling, coming, cumming and homes within
homes. The lyrics aren't explicitly nasty — they
work in that classic Hayes-code way of coding
sexuality in rampant imagery like "the roll of alu
minum foil." And the words are wonderfully sup
ported by a minimalistic mix of whistling synths
and funky guitars.
But every other song on the disc pretty much
bites. A lot of them start off with great promise.
"This is Not It,"for example, starts off with,
again, a cool funky riff of electric piano and gui
tar and a good line: "The place where I / Should
have been / Is paradise / On earth." Yet the song
quickly falls apart because that 10-second cool
bit is repeated endlessly for the rest of the song.
No joke. About two minutes in, there's some lyric
variation, but that's about it.
And some songs don't even hold 10 seconds of
interest. "Community" features Mr. Prina croon
ing out a list of different names of grouping ani
mals, e.g. "A brood of domestic / Or game
birds / A cast of hawks or falcons / A cete of bad
gers / A covert of coots" and on and on forever,
with the only accompaniment being an uninter
esting acoustic riff over and over again. The
sound gets more interesting on some tracks but
only to the point in which you imagine that if
Urban Outfitters decorated waiting rooms, this
would be the Muzak that would be played. This
could all be intentional, but if that is true, why?
WHY?
