J J*" here seems to be an inherent mania in
& e harsh digital sound of drum-n
-bass's most recent off-shoot, "drill-n
-bass," and Jega, aka Dylan Nathan, has harnessed
its chaotic power while also revealing its softer
side. This is not to say that "Spectrum," Jega's lat
est release, which has finally made it to the States
(the album was originally released last year in the
U.K. on Planet u Records), ever gives up its inten
sity. Instead it incorporates the extreme elements
of digital drum-n-bass with more soundscape
like electronics. This debut album successfully
combines these elements and makes for an inter
esting head journey.
The album's uniqueness makes it difficult to
place the record in any single category; however
its various sounds resemble the likes of
Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Autechre and u-ziq.
Its diverse style can appeal to the listener's abra
sive sensibilities while also making room for
calmer moods. Jega utilizes elements of drum-n
-bass, breakbeat, jazz, and ambient to create a lay
ered mixture of experimental electronica that
propels you into mayhem and then lets you rest
on its more mellow textured beats. The tracks
contain a percussive intensity that is simultane
ously rhythmic and abstract. A constant shift
between the calm and the jarring occurs with an
elegance that appears to lack pretension and
nears accessibility.
Although this album isn't exactly danceable, it
is filled with pulsating beats. The drill and bass
brutality is limited to only a few songs, in tracks
like "Intron.ix," which contains jungle breaks
along with warped basslines and dark distant
beats, or "Pitbull," which swallows its listener
with its digital bass. Layered ambient sounds on
the lighter tracks like "Nia" or "Kid Sista" lead
one into a more mysterious groove while still
holding on to the digital-sounding beats.
For those who appreciate the more experi
mental side of electronica, "Spectrum" is well
worth checking out. Expect Jega to strike you
with some beautifully brutal beats just before
and after it probes at you with a more intricate
mellow sound.
