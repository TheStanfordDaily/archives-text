### 
he Wu-Tang Clan hasn't exactly been
CSm producing stellar material lately. In
1998, Method Man's sophomore effort
"Tical 2000: Judgment Day" as well as RZA's solo
debut "RZA Presents Bobby Digital In Stereo" left
a great deal to be desired substantively. They also
left many questions unanswered concerning the
future of this once seemingly indestructible hip
hop dynasty. So it is with good timing that the
Wu-Tang Clan releases "Wu-Chronicles," a solid
compilation of various solo cuts, B-sides and col
laborations that remind disillusioned fans of the
group's impressive resume of oddly appealing

melodies.
"Wu-Chronicles" includes some of the best
Wu collaborations, including Method Man's duet
with Notorious 8.1.G., "The What," and
Raekwon's guest spot on Cocoa Brovaz's effec
tively sparse "Black Trump." 01' Dirty Bastard's
appearance on Tha Alkaholik's "Hip Hop
Drunkies" highlights the curiously infectious
sound that arises when the Wu-Tang sound is
crossed with other distinctive flavors. In addi
tion, "Wu-Chronicles" highlights some of the
strongest posse cuts, such as "Wu-Gambinos,"
from Raekwon's acclaimed 1995 album, "Only
Built 4 Cuban Linx," soundtrack cuts like "Semi-
Automatic: Full Metal Rap Jacket" (from "High
School High"), and B-sides such as the RZA mix
of Genius' "Cold World" featuring D'Angelo.
However, "Wu-Chronicles" falters when it
highlights various lesser-known Wu-Tang affili
ates. Unworthy and unproven artists such as
Killarmy and Shyheim unjustifiably hide behind
the Wu-Tang moniker. Enthusiasts have consis
tently been disappointed by these MCs' projects,
as they have come to expect much more from the
Wu-Tang title. Moreover, these second-rate Wu
artists are responsible in large part for discredit
ing the Wu-Tang name in the minds of fans and
critics alike.
Although "Wu-Chronicles" lacks any cohesive
theme, it is overall a worthwhile compilation. It
points to several weak points in the Wu-Tang
armor, but the record's preponderance accentu
ates the charisma of the peculiarly lovable collec
tive that is the Wu-Tang Clan.
