# Badawi
## Heretic of Ether (Asphodel Records) 
### 
n 1997 Badawi — otherwise known as
112 *Y) Raz Mesinai, master dubber and per
tAS cussionist and one half of Sub Dub
(Instinct Records / Asphodel Records) —
brought us a fun, danceable fusion of dub, hip
hop and reggae with "Jerusalem Under Fire," his
second album on ROIR Records. However
"Heretic of Ether," Badawi's latest, is nothing like
his previous album; instead this follow-up is a
bland mix of cello, violin and dub that makes one
want to fall asleep. Badawi, whose name means
"Bedouin" or "desert dweller," claims that we
were "living in an easy-listening age" when he
released his debut, "Badawi Presents the Bedouin
Sound Clash"; yet his newest album sounds eeri
ly like elevator music.
Nothing resembling a beat exists from the
opening "Intro" up until 50 seconds into track
two, at which point the album picks up a bit.
However this second track, "Tired Soldiers,"
doesn't benefit too much from having this beat,
as Badawi keeps the same beat throughout the
rest of the song. But his fifth track, "Enter the
Heretic," might be the best song on the CD.
Badawi's skill on percussion instruments is unde
niably present in this piece, and the song is fun
and upbeat. Many of the other tracks on this CD
suffer from Mesinai's new addition of string
instruments in his music; while this offers a sense
of depth to his sound, the songs sound over
loaded.
But what's glaringly missing from Badawi's

repertoire is his sampling — the reggae and hip
hop tools that used to give his music a modern
edge to counterbalance his more traditional
instruments. All the samples on "Heretic of
Ether" are his own, and none of them take the
dusty feel off of this album. Unfortunately, this
CD will be relegated to the "study music" section
of my music collection.
