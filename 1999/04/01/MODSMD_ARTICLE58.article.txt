# TOM PETTY AT THE FILLMORE
## March 16, 1999

om Petty is a rock 'n' roll god. How many singer-songwriters have been around for
CSM more than 25 years and continue to make relevant music? Not too many. Petty was
writing great songs before the Beatles broke up, and he endures in the age of Puff
Daddy and Third Eye Blind. In preparation for a tour to support its highly anticipated album
"Echo" (Warner Bros, April 12), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers played seven shows at San
Francisco's Fillmore from March 7-16. Petty has always been known as a great songwriter, but
a live Heartbreakers show, except among hardcore fans, is never as big a deal as a concert by
the Rolling Stones. However, Petty proved just as viable a performer as he is a songsmith at the
final show of the Fillmore engagement. The entire band was playing hard for both the audi
ence and the cameras, which were rolling for an upcoming Petty television special.
Opener Bo Diddley set the stage with a solid set of his jump-blues style rock songs. Later, he
sat in with the Heartbreakers and stole the show with his onstage antics. Besides the Diddley
appearance, highlights of the Petty set included the intense rocker "Runnin' Down a Dream,"
during which longtime Petty guitarist Mike Campbell played a solo that had the crowd scream
ing for more. Campbell managed to bust out some impressive fills and lead play during most
of the songs of the two-hour-plus set. During a short mid-set string of acoustic songs, the
Heartbreakers played a few bluegrass standards with beautiful harmonies and Campbell on
mandolin. The lights went down, and a spotlight shone on Petty as he played solo for the soft,
sweet ballad "Angel Dream" to the delight of the 1,200-capacity crowd. Some crowd favorites
were the classic "Breakdown," with its catchy hook and memorable chorus, as well as the

"Wildflo'wers" (1994) hits, "You Don't Know How It Feels" and

"You Wrecked Me." New tunes such as- "Swingin' " and

"Room at the Top of the World" were also an exciting pre
view of the upcoming album.
As for the players, Benmont Tench's piano was amazing,
as would be expected from the man Petty called "the best
damn piano player in rock 'n' roll." Howie Epstein's bass
playing was pretty standard, but his harmony vocals to
Petty's lead melodies gave the songs the signature sound the

Heartbreakers are famous for. Steve Maroni's drums were
crisp and clean on the whole, and at times his tempo and

volume changes gave the group a good dynamic that
translated to the crowd's excitement. All-purpose band
member Scott Thurston contributed the key harmonica
chops on such songs as "You Don't Know How It Feels"
and "Last Dance With Mary Jane," as well as guitar, bass

and piano on various other songs.
And then there was Petty himself. This is a 50-year
old man playing songs he wrote as a kid and songs he
wrote last week with the same intensity and fire as
someone half his age. He arrived onstage in true rock
'n' roll fashion with a huge coat-tailed jacket and cow
boy cap, ready to play the show of his life. Petty's voice
was at times just as sweet and restrained as on his
dozen studio albums, but he also had the ability to
belt out the vocals in songs like the final encore, Van
Morrison's rock anthem "Gloria." His excitement
seemed to match the crowd's, and Petty didn't ever

want to leave the stage; midway through the show, he
said, "If you're planning on being home early, you better
call home, 'cause we gonna be here a long time!"

When they left the ballroom shortly after midnight, every
one who was present knew they had been treated to a good,
old-fashioned rock 'n' roll concert. They also knew they'd be

buying "Echo" the day it comes out.
