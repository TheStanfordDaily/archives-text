# Stanford considers joining nationwide movement
## Corporate bookstores aim for college profits 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
If Stanford follows through on
the recently announced possibility
of running the Stanford Bookstore
on a for-profit basis, the store will
join a growing number of its coun
terparts at campuses such as Yale,
Harvard, UC-Berkeley and the
University of Chicago, all of which
have made the same change in re
cent years.
The Stanford Bookstore is now.
and has been since 1897, an inde
pendent nonprofit corporation.
Bookstores at many other cam
puses have come under control of
large corporate booksellers within
the past few years, due to such var

ions factors as business lost to on
line booksellers, inexplicable dips
in sales and financial inability to
maintain bookstore buildings.
The Stanford Bookstore's
board of directors, faced with simi
lar difficulties, voted on March IS
to explore this option, reviewing
proposals from retailers such as
Barnes & Noble and Follet Man
agement Systems, a British group.
Realizing the gravity of such a
move, the board has also contacted
several universities that have faced
similar changes. History Prof.
David Kennedy, the board's chair,
said that university officials and
faculty whom he contacted seemed
very happy with the moves.
"The responses were largely

consistent... all the university of
ficials whom we spoke with report
ed that their bookstores are doing
at least as well, and sometimes bet
ter, than they were under universi
ty ownership," Kennedy said.
It was generally the case at these
universities, Kennedy added, that
when a company such as Barnes &
Noble takes over a store, the im
mense amount of capital at the dis
posal of the corporation allows the
bookstore to stock a larger selec
tion of books, often at lower prices.
They were also able to spread over
head costs over several stores,
manage human resource issues at a
corporate level and apply efficien
cy-oriented corporate expertise
unknown to the former managers,
Kennedy said.
Students, managers and super
visors at campus bookstores who
find themselves newly employed
by corporate giants mostly concur
with the board's findings.
David Sullivan, general manag
er of "The Coop," Harvard's on
campus bookstore, emphasized
that, "everything has been working
very well" since Barnes & Noble
leased the store from the universi
ty two years ago.
"The university was unable to
bring the building up to 1990s stan
dards and sales were falling off."
Sullivan said.
"Barnes & Noble has been able
to totally renovate the building, in
stall a new computer system to
keep track of sales and inventory
and increase the selection of books

by almost two and a half times.
We've also installed a lot more
seating and a large cafe."
Student response has also been
positive. "Barnes & Noble spent a
lot of time and money making sure
students would like it," Sullivan
said.
"It's really been a win-win situa
tion," he concluded.
Doug Feenhy, a student and su
pervisor at UC-Berkeley's book
store. has also noticed a positive
sheen since their takeover by Fol
let.
"The store is being run much
more efficiently now. Sales have
picked up, it's easier for students to
find and buy books, and generally,
there's more of a store atmosphere
and less of a university office at
mosphere," Feenhy said.
"Also, they've introduced big
business tactics like exciting pro
motions and 20-percent-off sales
where the bookstore loses money,
but the sale entices more busi
ness."
