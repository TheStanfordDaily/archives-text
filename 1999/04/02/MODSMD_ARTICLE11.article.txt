Potential benefits of
corporatized bookstore
must be considered

IT WOULD BE easy to dismiss
the notion of a national chain
taking over the Stanford Book
store as a sell-out — one more way
for the University to save a buck by
plastering a corporate logo on a red
tile roof.
But allowing Barnes & Noble or
Follet Management Systems to run
the currently independent Book
store is a possibility that defies
stereotypical corporatization trends
and one that should be carefully
considered.
The Bookstore's board of direc
tors said last month that it is consid
ering selling the non-profit store to a
for-profit company. Increased com
petition from online vendors and
slow sales of Apple computer prod
ucts— which the Bookstore stocks
heavily — have lowered revenue
and forced the move.
The announcement was met with
criticism from some students, who
say that an outside vendor could
make (he store shallow, corporate
and less academic. A veritable Wal-
Mart in place of a beloved mom
and-pop store.
The Bookstore, however, is far
from beloved. It has a history of
financial scandal highlighted by the
loss of more than $2 million in the
stock market in 1991 and revelations
in 1992 of lavish perks for employees
that included a vacation home and
the use of several automobiles.
Today, the store continues often to
price books higher than their sug
gested retail values.
Further, reaction from other
schools whose bookstores have been
sold to Barnes & Noble or Follet
reveals that for-profit booksellers

arc far from evil. Students at Har
vard and UC-Berkeley, whose
schools have turned to outside ven
dors in recent years, have largely
praised the new operations as cheap
er and more convenient for students.
Large corporations enjoy distinct
advantages in commerce over their
smaller competitors. They can stock
more books and sell them at lower
prices — great benefits, especially to
student shoppers on limited budgets.
Those corporations are also able
to keep up with advancements in
technology such as online book-buy
ing. There may soon be a day when
most students buy textbooks from
their dorm rooms, a service that the
Bookstore has been unable to pro
vide, and that trend could force the
non-profit group out of business.
Evidence from other schools also
suggests that for-profit bookstores
have been able to maintain the same,
and often provide a better, student
friendly atmosphere in the store.
Given the options of a steadily
drowning independent Bookstore or
a for-profit body with more
resources and lower prices, we vote
for the outsider. But we realize that
there aren't any offers on the table
yet, and there are other choices as
well.
The Bookstore could opt not to
sell and instead reinvent itself,
investing in technology and pledging
to be straightforward with its prices,
avoiding the "rebate" system alto
gether. In doing so, it could wipe
away memories of the
scandals and prove that non-profit,
independent groups can survive in
an era of rapidly advancing technol
ogy-
If this can't happen, however,
then we encourage the board of
directors to seriously consider sell
ing to Barnes & Noble or Follet, a
case of corporatization that could
help the University and its students.
