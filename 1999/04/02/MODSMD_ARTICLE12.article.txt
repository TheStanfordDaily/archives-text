Pornography edit skewed
I'm writing in response to the outrage
that has erupted over SCBN's airing of sex
ually explicit material two Fridays ago.
There has now been both a news column
and an editorial condemnation of what has
been termed an "inappropriate act," and it
seems fair that the other side of the argu
ment be voiced before the issue fades back
into moral obscurity.
Isn't it just a little obvious to condemn
SC'BN for airing pornography?
It's as if the entire Stanford community
has had a knee-jerk reaction to something
that we've all been very much ingrained
with: that pornography is bad. Members of
the Stanford community were "shocked,"
"outraged" and "extremely offended" that
SCBN would so blatantly demonstrate such
"obviously pwr taste "
Here's a wake up call, Stanford. SCBN
was taken off the air for a full day after the
incident occurred, and when the station
finally returned to its regular programming,
you know what was on the air? "Basic
Instinct," a movie that we have all, by social
consensus, approved for our SCBN line-up.
No more pornography, thank god, but
instead we became privy to some spectacu
lar views of naked famous people, not to
mention depictions of rape and murder as
well.
But it wasn't pornography, because
pornography is real, right?
This morning, I woke up and turned on
CNN, where I was suddenly and unexpect
edly confronted with images of dead Kosovo

Albanians. Real, dead people, shot to death
by other real people with real guns recorded
for the camera by real reporters and sent
back to the United States to be viewed by a
country with a real distorted sense for
"appropriate" content. I felt a little sick to
my stomach, but at least CNN didn't show
any Serbs having sex.
I'll quote the editorial: "Highly contro
versial and potentially inflammatory materi
al such as pornography carries with it the
possibility of religiously, morally or socially
offending groups of students. All students
should be given the opportunity to feel basi
cally comfortable in a center of academia
such as this."
Excuse me? If SCBN's pornography was
controversial in content, then yesterday's
editorial was equally controversial in the
manner it addressed that content. Pornogra
phy might have offended students, but for
The Daily to claim the right to decide what
is and is not in "poor taste" is equally con
troversial. And if you are truly serious about
wanting to be someplace where you can feel
"basically comfortable" from the darkly
threatening jaws of depicted sexuality, try
grade school.
We live in a world torn by hate, violence,
murder and abuse, and here's the Stanford
student body condemning the act of sex. The
message that this sends out: Feel free to do
it, just don't tell anyone about it. Don't talk
about it in public. And for god's sake, don't
broadcast it!
I have a recommendation for everybody
who found themselves sickened that Friday
morning by the "poor taste" and "bad judg
ment" exercised by the open-minded folks

down at SCBN: next time, try changing the
channel.

Edit missed crucial points
I'm sorry. Daily editors, but you missed a
few valid points in yesterday's criticism of
SCBN's decision to air pornography during
Dead Week.
First, television gives us the wonderful
opportunity to change the channel, or better
yet, turn it off. No one was forced to watch
the program, and those who did CHOSE to
do so. Second, at 2 a.m., any "faculty kids"
that were awake watching television have
other problems that need to be addressed. It
is doubtful that any children viewed the pro
gram. And lastly, you sometimes print
sludge that could easily be as insulting as
pornography, so leave SCBN alone and get
off your moral high horse.

Serb letter had strong bias
Vladimir Stojanovic's letter in Wednes
day's Daily equates NATO retaliation with
Serbia's unprovoked aggression against
innocent civilians. This is like saying Adolf
Hitler and Franklin Roosevelt were equally
responsible for the killings during World
War 11. Stojanovic tells us we are stupid:
"the American government and media

ignore history and do not really get to know
the situation."
In fact, Slobodan Milosevic is scared to
let the world know or see what is happening.
That is why Serb forces threatened our
media and the Serbian government expelled
them from Kosovo. It strains credulity that
the most aggressive media in the world is
presenting a pack of lies: "CNN does not
cover [attacks against Serbia]." In fact, I
have seen negative reporting on CNN about
the Kosovo Liberation Army. But prior to
Serbia's attack, this was a tiny organization
whose misdeeds against Serb troops paled in
comparison with what is happening to tens
of thousands of innocents in Kosovo today.
The United States has nothing to gain
and much to lose from fighting this war. Ser
bia is carrying out this war for completely
selfish reasons: to amass territory and exact
revenge for a battle lost 600 years ago.
Should we kill the ancestors of slave owners
for things that happened only 1(X) years ago?
When do we stop hating? Further, this is
NOT the first time Serbia has tried to exter
minate its own people. I attended a talk
years ago by a top Bosnian government offi
cial who I believe was later murdered. I had
plenty of facts years ago to despise Serbia
for destroying tens of thousands of innocent
lives.
Serbs can tell themselves they are the vic
tims. The Japanese still tell themselves they
were victims of World War 11, but that
doesn't make it so. War is hell, but not all
participants are morally equal.
