## Alden Clarke Living the good life at Yahoo! 
### 
rUE STORY that
follows belongs to a
Silicon Valley soft
ware engineer. He wishes to
remain anonymous.
In the Spring of 1997, I
graduated from Stanford
and signed with Yahoo!

This year I'm taking some courses through
the Stanford Instructional Television Net
work while working full-time on the Yahoo!
Web portal — making it more powerful,
more intuitive and more alluring. On the
main page, just above the field in which users
enter their queries, there's a link called
"Yahoo! Clubs," a system of virtual commu
nities that allows people from literally all
over the globe to share their ideas, interests
and experiences. I thought it up. 1 imple
mented it. And now millions use it.
As a senior, I was terrified by the prospect
of leaving my single in Lantana and exiting
Sweet Hall for the last time. Hut now I'm
earning $6.S,(XK) each year and working for a
thriving company in one of the most exciting
and challenging high-tech environments the
world has ever known: Silicon Valley.
This isn't CS 108, kids.
This is real.
I do something, and it makes life better
for millions of people in 2K countries. Stan
ford was great, but it was about theory.
Yahoo! is about changing the world. Now
my work really matters.
Many seniors fear that life after college,
when you live in an apartment, not a dormi
tory, will lack community. It's just not true.
At Yahoo! I'm part of a team of engineers
bound together by timid demeanor, lower
back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.

When each team member's personal wealth
depends on the success of the company, as it
does here with our stock options, a sense of
community more profound than any I've
ever experienced develops. We work 90-
hour weeks together. We go bowling togeth
er.
Consider my team's last big project.
When we were two weeks from deadline
with a month of work remaining, my manag
er Jeff surprised us all with embroidered
company T-shirts boldly emblazoned with
the slogan, "Seize the Day." I hardly need to
tell you that we finished the project two days
ahead of schedule and celebrated at Spago's
on the company expense account. It's a
shame we don't have any female co-workers,
because they would have livened up the
party, but it was crazy anyway. Akesh got so
drunk that he smiled at the waitress. It was
awesome.
At Stanford I wore clothes from The Gap
and rode a $300 bicycle. Now I wear Armani
and drive a BMW Z3. Women still find me
predictable, closed-minded and utterly un
sexy, even with the hot car. Fortunately I've
got some cash, which I used to order
Natasha, a great lady and my future bride.
She arrived just two weeks ago from Kaza
khstan, courtesy of an extremely reputable
service. Needless to say, she's gorgeous and
has — just as they promised — bigger
breasts and a smaller waist than the Belarus
sian that my co-worker Steve ordered last
month.
It's true: the grind of the 90-hour weeks
has made it difficult for me to muster up an
erection for my bride-to-be, but I've found
some great Viagra deals on the Web using
the search engine 1 helped design.

NAtasha can cook and clean, but just
between you and me, she's not the brightest
kid on the block. That's why I put out an ad
offering $50,(XX) for the best egg money can
buy: the egg of a Stanford woman taller than
5 feet 10 inches, with an SAT score over 1400
and no family history of major medical prob
lems.
It isn't just the dating life that gets better.
At Stanford I was embarrassed to use cliched
terms like "information super-highway,"
"paradigm," "vertical organization" and
"distributed system," but in the corporate
world they're more persuasive than modus
ponens. I've left Stanford, but I haven't
stopped learning. In college, for example, 1
didn't know anything about purchasing sys
tems. Nothing! Since working on Yahoo!'s
online commerce initiative, I've become a
purchasing systems expert with vast knowl
edge of supply chain optimization techniques
and consumer buying dynamics.
Some people say that I now lead a shad
ow life, toiling day after empty day for no
grander purpose than fattening the pockets
of Yahoo! shareholders.
Some say that having traded the power
and beauty of my youth for the security of
stock options and a modest salary makes me
a coward. Some say that all my rhetoric
about enjoying the challenges of software
design is a vapor of lies that hides just how
bland, ghastly and anemic my existence real
ly is.
I tell myself that I'm shaping the future
and earning a good wage.
