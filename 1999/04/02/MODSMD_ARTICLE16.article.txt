## Mark Silver Just say no? I don't think so 
### 
JUSI SAY NO. Dare to keep kids off
drugs. I his is your brain on drugs.
We've all heard the tired slogans; the
empty words that exhort us to stay away
from evil pharmaceuticals. Years of health
class and visits from Officer Bowserman
have gradually drilled into us the message
that drugs are "baaad," that only "baaad"
kids do them. No high-achieving, ambitious
young Stanford student would ever think of
sabotaging his or her future career by devel
oping a serious heroin habit.
But is casual experimentation with drugs
really so bad? Let's take a closer look before
we answer that question.
First off, most drugs are illegal. The gov
ernment makes laws, and we're supposed to
follow them. If you use drugs, you may be
punished — severely if you've got any crack
(but a little bit of coke is okay) — by fine or
incarceration. People who believe in the rule
of law shouldn't use illegal substances. They
also shouldn't drink alcohol under the age of
21 or drive over the speed limit or, in many
states, engage in such unlawful and abom
inable practices as oral sex. Law-abiding citi-

Zens must he true to their principles in all
areas of legality, and don't you dare violate
the Honor Code either.
So, assuming that you have no fear of gov
ernment retribution or that you live in an
anarchical state of nature, what are the possi
ble effects of using drugs? Biology tells us
that drug use can lead to brain damage,
memory loss, debilitating addictions, fatal
overdoses, etc., etc. But since we all know
that biology is just another form of govern
ment propaganda, similar to religion and
economics, we'll ignore what biology has to
say. We won't be taken in that easily.
Instead, let's turn to the social sciences, a
much more reliable data source about sub
stance use. Psychologists Jonathan Shedler
and Jack Block have concluded that com
pared to both those who frequently use drugs
and those who totally abstain. "The experi
menters ... were the most outgoing, straight
forward, cheerful, charming and poised of
the three groups."
Drug experimentation, when it's not done
frequently, seems to be correlated with
healthier and happier individuals. And since

we all know that in the social sciences, corre
lation always implies causation, we can con
clude that experimenting with drugs will
make you happier.
Of course, the researchers above were
studying adolescents, but since we spent our
time in high school working way too hard, we
can assume that our social and emotional
development has been neglected. Technical
ly, we're all still adolescents. If you don't
believe me, go to Flicks.
Sadly, many individuals who experiment
with drugs eventually get into trouble. If
experimentation is healthy, why does this
happen?
To answer that question, I'd like to
employ an analogy involving a cheeseburger,
what I call the Cheeseburger Analogy. It
goes something like this: A cheeseburger by
itself is not all that bad for you. Fat, choles
terol and vegetarians aside, for most of us.
eating one cheeseburger will not do us in.
The magnitude of the personal destruction
wrought by eating a cheeseburger is related
to the individual who eats it. Some athlete
crazy enough to train for the Olympics who

sneaks a Big Mac won't suffer too much.
1 lowever. a large, obese couch potato who is
enjoying his fourth Double-Double had bet
ter forgo animal-style on the next one.
The sweet, simple logic of the Cheese
burger Analogy easily applies to drug exper
imentation. The dangers of drugs are,
according to me, directly related to the kind
of person who uses them. With this powerful
theory in mind, let's briefly identify some
people whi.) should never ever use drugs.
Depressed people need to stay away from
drug experimentation. If you're depressed,
you might think that using drugs will make
you feel better. While this may turn out to be
true in the short run, depression-induced
drug use can only end in tragedy. Besides,
your depression is probably stemming from
some hidden cause such as latent sexual frus
tration. which you can alleviate without the
use of drugs. Well, maybe not on this cam
pus.
Annoying people also need to resist the
temptation to use drugs. Contrary to what
you may believe, if you are annoying, using
drugs will onlv make you more annoying.

Anyone who's watched an annoying person
get high (for relieving the symptoms of glau
coma) knows this common-sense logic, and
now we've effectively eliminated half of the
student population.
People who only care about their CPA
shouldn't use drugs. Doing drugs will not
boost your GPA. unlike majoring in history.
Really happy people don't need to exper
iment with drugs. Why ruin a good thing?
Keep floating on that cloud as long as possi
ble, and try not to screw it up.
So my friends, for the 10 of you who are
left, examine yourselves. If you like breaking
the law and consider yourself a reasonably
healthy and content individual, think about
what those social scientists have to say.
As Bob Marley would say. "Emancipate
yourself from mental slavery, none but our
selves can free our minds."
But don't blame me if you get arrested.
