# Federal bill could up research costs
## 
### Jad Fakhry Contributing writer 
Stanford researchers are con
cerned that recently proposed feder
al legislation could profoundly effect
Stanford's research ability.
A hill proposed hy the Office of
Management and Budget would
change laws governing the release of
raw data from universities receiving
federal research funding, requiring
the data to be made available to the
public under the Freedom of Infor
mation Act.
Geoffrey Grant, associate vice
president for research administra
tion, explained his concern about the
proposed legislation. "While the ac
tual language of the proposal itself
may sound innocuous, it raises seri
ous questions critical to the research
community," he said.
Grant has advised the Office of
Management and Budget to delay
the legislation until it can be studied
further and understood.
Communication Prof. Ted (ilass
er noted the legislation puts the I Jni
versity in an awkward position be
cause it "undermines proprietary in
formation and property rights on in
formation."
He explained that if the hill be
came law, Stanford would be caught
in the middle of a legal and ethical
quagmire. While the University is an
advocate of the Freedom of Informa
tion Act, the proposed legislation
goes beyond that Act and jeopar
dizes sensitive research data, patents
and confidentiality agreements.
The concerns listed hy Grant in a
letter written to Congress about the
bill are the ambiguity and costs of dis

tributing data, the intellectual prop
erty ramifications, the effects 011
Stanford's relationship with research
done for private industries and pa
tient confidentiality.
Grant also noted, "We are con
cerned that the proposed revisions
may deter young scientists from en
tering certain fields or conducting
certain kinds of research because of
concern that their research might be
targeted for premature data release
or scrutiny hy those opposed to the
research."
Law Prof. John Donohue ad
dressed the controversy surrounding
the proposed legislation, lie said,
" There are definitely risks involved."
He noted that if a professor pub
lished a paper with federal support,
he could "envision professors spend
ingtimeand money providing data to
other people." I le explained that the
proposed legislation would burden
the researcher with the immense
costs of disseminating raw data.
To solve this problem, Donohue
proposed that "the federal govern
ment eliminate the costs to the re
searcher hy distributing data to the
public."
Glasser said the legislation de
fines raw data in a general and vague
manner. This vagueness is one rea
son the University is protesting the
legislation.
However, Donohue noted that
the legislation will probably not lie
passed in its current form. I le warned
that Washington should he cautious
at this stage. "I can see why people
would want to make data public, but
there is a danger in crude legislation
enacting the dissemination of data to
the public."
