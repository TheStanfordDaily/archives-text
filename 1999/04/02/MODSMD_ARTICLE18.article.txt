# Earthquakes, expansion and controversy
## Bookstore has long and varied past 
### Bo Zhang 
A hundred and two years ago. a
group of professors on the Farm
were disturbed to see their students
trekking 40niiles to San Francisco to
buy textbooks. With the help of
then-llniversity President David
Starr Jordan, they borrowed $Ixooo
and started a nonprofit book busi
ness.
That was the birth of the Stanford
Bookstore.
()ver the years it has moved from
one place to another, survived earth
quakes in 1 90 band 1989, introduced
daily commodities and gym clothes
to its shelves and finally developed
into the biggest college bookstore in
the I Jnited States.
The early history of the Hook
store was a mere triumph. In 1948 it
grew from ;i small store to a $6 mil
lion business. In 1970 the sales were
$3 million, with $120,000 going back
to students in discount. In 1981, it
opened its first branch in downtown
Palo Alto.
In 1990. the Bookstore spent $2.5
million on renovation and expan

sion. It utilized its two basement
floors and carried 225.000 titles,
which for the first time made it the
biggest college bookstore in the
country.
The fast expansion, however.

didn't bring the
Bookstore ex
pected revenues.
In 1991 the book
store reportedly
lost close to $2
million in the
stock market.

During the Bookstore's 1989-90
fiscal year, the store's controller
Patrick McDonald invested several
million dollars of the store's reserve
funds in what a director called
"rather speculative" stocks without
the knowledge of the store's general
manager or board of directors.
Alter McDonald was forced to
resign, the store sold off millions of
dollars worth of stocks at substantial
losses.
The incident drew the attention
of the California Attorney Gener
al's Office, which conducted an in
vestigation into whether the Book

store had broken state laws govern
ing nonprofit corporations.
The California Corporation
Code permits nonprofit corpora
tions to invest a portion of their
funds in the stock market, but says
they are supposed to "avoid specula
tion."
In 1992, another big scandal blew
up. Eldon Speed and Philip Chiara
monte, the Stanford Bookstore's top
two managers, were reported to
have high-end automobiles, a vaca
tion home, a Holiday Rambler
motor home, a hot tub and a sailboat
all paid for by the Bookstore.
Investigation began and eight
managers were discovered to be dri
ving autos owned by the nonprofit
business. In 1993, the store's legal
and accounting costs reached
$900,000 as the state's investigation
went on. The store sold the focus of
the scandal, a Twain Harte vacation
home, to private owners for
$385, (KX).
The Bookstore elected a new
board and changed management,
trying to rebuild its shattered image
and finances.

"Our job was to hire new mange -
ment and to clean the mess," said
History Prof. David Kennedy, the
board's chair.
Kennedy said the board has done
a good job and contributed to the
store's development. Hut the rising
competition from online booksellers
has put the store's prosperity and
survival at risk in the last year and a
half, Kennedy said.
The board is currently consider
ing another management change,
possibly bringing in a national book
chain. Kennedy emphasized that the
issue is not decided, "but we hope to
make decision before the end of this
quarter."
"Our assumption is that chain op
eration will cut costs and bring bene
fits to the store."
Asked about whether the poten
tial management change will affect
students' benefits, he said he
couldn't predict the future.
"But if we do introduce some
outside manangement," he said,
"we'll do our very best in our con
tracts to make it best serve the inter
est of the Stanford communitv."
