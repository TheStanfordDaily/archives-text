Unfortunately, the team hit a
speed bump this past weekend and
suffered three conference losses to
Washington and UCLA. Before
these losses, the team was enjoying
an extraordinary 15-game win streak
that dated back to Feb. 28.
In a doubleheader yesterday
against Utah State, Stanford was
looking to begin another streak and
return to its winning ways.
The Cardinal put on a clinic in the
games against the Aggies (7-IS). In
the first game Stanford spread out the
offense seoring two runs in the
first, second and fifth inning on route
to a h-2 victory. Stanford's offensive
powerhouses, freshmen Jessica Men
doza and Sarah Hceson, recorded a
combined three hits and two RHIs.
Pitcher Marcy Crouch and third base
man Shane Anderson each added

KB Is of their own.
Crouch also outpitched Utah
State pitchers Kelly Martina and
Candee Howden. In seven innings,
the senior allowed just seven hits and
two runs.
In game two. Stanford's offense
really came alive. After scoring eight
runs in the first inning, the team went
on to a 16-0 victory in five innings.
Kellie Wiginton, Michelle Schneider,
lieeson, Robin Walker. Christina
Chao and Jennie Foyle all collected
hits in the first to bring home eight

runs. Despite having been sick. Men
do/a stepped up offensively to lead
the team. Slie tallied live KBls and hit
a grand slam in the fourth to record
her seventh home run of the season.
Senior pitcher Hecky Hlevins allowed
just one hit and no runs in four in
nings. I o top it off. freshman Susan
Winkelman ended the game by strik
ing out Utah State's leading hitter,
Tammy Alacantar, in her first ap
pearance on the mound for the Car
dinal this season.
Most importantly, the squad was

looking to win these non-conference
games to help prepare it for its home
stand against rival California (27-8,0-
3) tomorrow.
"We were definitely looking for
momentum to carry us into the game
against Cal," said senior Michelle
Schneider.
Currently, the Cardinal holds a 1-
3 record in Pac-10 play, but has the
opportunity to improve to .500 in its
Pac-10 home opener against Cal to
morrow. Presently, there are eight
Pac-10 teams ranked in the top 15.

The Golden Bears are the next team
behind the Cardinal at No. 14.
"They are a very capable team
with some good pitching, power hit
ters and speed." said head coach John
Rittman, "If we play to our capabili
ties, we should do well."
Stanford's capabilities should put
the Golden Bears in their place.
Seven players are averaging above
.300 in hitting. After today's game,
Mendoza is stepping up to the plate
with an incredible .500 average. Col
lectively, the team is hitting .325 and

has held its opponents to under .2(X).
"Our defense is usually pretty
good," Schneider said, "so we are
glad that we did a better job offen
sively in the second game against
Utah State to carry us into Saturday's
game."
The pitching duo of Marcy Crouch
and Becky Blevins continues to be
one of the most lethal in the Pac-10.
Crouch has already pitched three
perfect games this season and boasts
an impressive 1.27 ERA.
