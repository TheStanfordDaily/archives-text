## Fac Sen approves split in Anthro grad program 
### kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
The Faculty Senate gave gradu
ate degree granting authority to
each hall of the split Anthropology
Department and discussed imple
mentation of the Introduction to the
Humanities program at its first
spring quarter meeting yesterday.
In a near-unanimous vote, the
Senate voted to allow the Depart
ment of Anthropological Sciences
and the Department of Cultural and
Social Anthropology to nominate
candidates for master's and doctor
al degrees beginning next fall.
Both of the departments
emerged from the division of the
Anthropology department in the
fall of IWB. The Committee on
Graduate Studies concluded that
each department offered appropri
ately specialized curricula and that
students could be expected to be
prepared for the specialized work
required in their degree programs.
The majority of the meeting was
devoted to reviewing the implemen
tation of the I-Hum program. The
Committee on Undergraduate

Studies found two areas that will
continue to need special attention in
the future.
The first problematic area is the
linkage of Area One courses with
Writing and Critical Thinking
courses. The second is that fall quar
ter courses, which are interdiscipli
nary, have difficulties in develop
ment and recruitment.
"The Area One leadership, the
deans and the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies all need to
think of ways of expanding the po
tential pool of instructors for these
courses and of encouraging human
ities departments to find their own
interdisciplinary partners," said
German Prof. Orrin Robinson 111,
chair of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies.
Elam conjectured that the re
cruitment trouble in fall quarter is
not due to a lack of interest on be
half of faculty to teach the pro
gram's courses but to its lack of time
to do so with the teaching of regular
classes and introductory seminars.
He added that the second and third
quarter sequence allows faculty
members to teach material in their

areas of expertise to a greater ex
tent.
In 19%, the Faculty Senate
passed legislation requiring the
Area One program to oversee the
transition from the Cultures, Ideas
and Values Program to the new I-
Hum program.
The decision to make the transi
tion stemmed from a perceived
need to focus on fewer texts and to
study them more closely, the need
to involve a broader range of facul
ty and departments in the program,
the desirability of the better integra
tion of works from outside the
Western cannon and the impor
tance of greater uniformity of intel
lectual standards and academic ex
pectations.
Two-thirds of the freshman class
currently participates in the I-Hum
program, and next year the entire
class will be enrolled in it. The Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
thus requested the Area One pro
gram to assess its implementation so
it could see how the program could
be improved.
"We feel that we've been effec
tive so far in implementing man
dates from the Senate," said Assoc.
Drama Prof. Harry Flam, director
of the Area ()ne program.
Other topics discussed at the
meeting were the status of graduate
housing and the need to revamp
both the curriculum and the facili
ties at the Medical School.
Provost Condoleezza Rice dis

cussed how the graduate student
housing crisis is being addressed.
Next year graduate students'
salaries will he increased by 7 per
cent to address the increase in cost of
living in the area. The University will
also provide an additional 250 subsi
dized units of off-campus housing.
Clinical Pharmacology Prof.
Kenneth Melmon also addressed
the issue of a need to overhaul the
curriculum at the Medical School
and to update its facilities if Stanford
hopes to reverse the trend of accept
ed students not matriculating.
