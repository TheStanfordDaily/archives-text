BASEBALL ""*
■ Yesterday: No. 3 Stanford (21-8,7-0 Pacific 10
Conference) 9, Washington State (16-10,1-3) 3.
■ Tonight: Stanford vs. Washington State,7 p.m.
Sunken Diamond.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Washington State, 1
p.m. Sunken Diamond.
Not exactly a well-maintained rivalry, to
say the least.
Hut with the reformed Pac-10 in its first
season, they met again last night at Sunken
Diamond for the opener of a three-game set
between the two schools.
It was the No. 3 Cardinal who made up for
lost time, pounding out 16 hits and cruising to
an easy 9-3 victory against an overwhelmed
Washington State squad.
The Cardinal (21-8, 7-0 Pac-10) staked
starter Jason Young to a quick 6-1 lead
through the first three innings and never
looked back.
The only suspense that remained after the
sixth inning was whether or not the Cardinal
would add one more run and secure the fans
a 2-for-l deal at a local pizzeria if it broke
into double figures in runs.
"We've done that lately," Marquess said
of his team's hitting. "We're starting to hit
the ball better."

Last night provided a glimpse of how bal
anced Stanford's hitting could really be. The
first eight hitters in the order had at least one
hit.
Leading the way was sophomore right
fielder Joe Borchard, who went 2 for 4 with
three RBIs, two of those coming in the top of
the sixth inning on his fifth home run of the
season.
Perhaps most encouraging, however, was
the performance of John Gall.
The junior first baseman, who has strug
gled at the plate this season, went 2 for 2 with
three walks and two runs scored. Finally re
covered from and early-season injury. Gall is
hoping this performance is the beginning of a
trend.
"The first four weeks of the season. I had
a broken finger," Gall said, pointing to his
left index finger. "But now, I'm seeing the
ball better. In the last three weeks, I've felt
very good."
Although he did not display quite the
same sharpness he had in February, Young
still dazzled the Cougars (16-10, 1-3). In
seven innings of work, he amassed 12 strike
outs and allowed two runs to improve his
record to 6-1, his first decision since in over a
month.
"He was around the plate," Marquess
said. "Even though he allowed [four] walks,
he was still around the plate. He wasn't real
ly wild and I thought his command was bet
ter.
"It's the best it's been since finals, so that
pleases me."
As for the team itself, it has taken early
command of the Pac-10 race, going unbeaten
through its first seven games.
While I)SC has finally woken up from its
underachieving stupor to jump out to a 7-2
start in conference, the Trojans still have to

come up to Sunken Diamond in two weeks —
a place where conference opponents have
had no luck whatsoever, going 0-4 against the
Cardinal in Pac-10 games played in the com
plex.
"I think there are lour really solid teams in
the Pac-l() this year," Gall said. "There's us,
USC, Washington and Arizona State and it
just happens tohe thisyearthat we have USC
and Arizona State at home, which is a big ad

vantage for us."
But for the time being. Stanford will set its
sights on the final two games of this series.
Sophomore right-hander Justin Wayne
(3-1, 5.69 ERA) gets the start for tonight's
game.
The series will conclude tomorrow after
noon with freshman right-hander Brian
Sager (2-0, 4.00 ERA) taking the mound for
the Cardinal.
