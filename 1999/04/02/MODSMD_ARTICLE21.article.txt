The fifth-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (15-2, 5-1 Pa
cific 10 Conference) faces two of its

toughest Pac-10 opponents this
weekend at the Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium.
The Cardinal will battle sixth
ranked IJC'LA today at noon and
then take on No. 11 USCat 1:30 p.m.

tomorrow.
"These are two of our last home
matches," said head coach Frank
Brennan, "and they're really strong
teams."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
most of the squad is finally healthy
and injury-free, although junior and
veteran star Teryn Ashley, ranked
fourth in the nation, is still suffering
from developing tendinitis in her
knee. Freshman Marissa Irvin, Stan
ford's top singles player, has recov
ered from her injuries, however.
"They're healing," she said. "I'm
playing well and I'm not worried
about injuries right now."

Pacific 10 Conference vs. No. 6
UCLA (14-3, 2-1), 12 p.m. Taube
Family Tennis Stadium.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. No. 11
USC (14-5. 3-0). 1:30 p.m. Taube
Family Tennis Stadium.
Brennan is also pleased that his
talented young squad is beginning to
understand the subtleties of colle
giate dual-match play.
"We're in a pretty good place
right now," he said. "When you have
four freshmen on the team, you have
a lot to learn, but they're learning
fast. Also, I'm learning about them
and getting to be a better coach."
The Bruins (14-3, 2-1) will be led
by Cristina Popescu, ranked 11th in
the nation, and the sixth-ranked
doubles tandem of Annica Cooper
and Amanda Basica.
"I've played both Popescu and

Cooper before," lrvin said. "I beat
them both but they were tough
matches, so I'm going to have to be
focused."
Like UCLA, USC also sports a
strong team. The Women of Troy
(14-5, 3-0) are led by No. 19 Ditta
Huber.
The Stanford women seem readv

lor the challenge. Freshmen Gabby
Lastra, Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko
Tokuda have all played well in re
cent matches, and should serve the
Cardinal well at the No. 3, 4 and 6
singles spots, respectively.
Junior Jennifer Heiser, compet
ing at the No. 5 singles position, has
posted several impressive wins late
ly. Against UNLV March 25, Heiser
crushed her opponent,6-1,6-1. Heis
er is now ranked (S4th in the nation
and boasts a 20-7 record.

"Jennifer has been playing excel
lent tennis," Ashley said. "She was
awesome against UNLV."
Irvin has courted a lot of atten
tion during her stellar freshman
campaign. While compiling a 29-2
record, Irvin has quickly leapt to the
No. 2 ranking in the nation. Her im
pressive rise in the ranks has incited
speculation about whether or not
Irvin will win the NCAA champi
onships and capture the nation's top
ranking.

"It is a goal," Irvin said, "but it's
not the most important thing. I real
ly just want to feel like I'm playing
well and do the best that I can. If I do
that, I think that the ranking is defi
nitely attainable."
Brennan has been pleased with
Irvin's play, but he doesn't want to
burden her with unnecessary pres
sure.
"Irvin's been doing a great job,"
he said. "It is nice to have a real big
gun at the No. 1 spot."
