# Hot rivalry
## Lacrosse looks for revenge 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
Besides defending the tradition
of the Axe and earning bragging
rights, the Stanford women's
lacrosse team (6-4, 3-1 Western

Women's Lacrosse League) needs a
victory over California tomorrow to
give it the edge in its race for first
place of the WWLL.
Currently UC-Davis, Cal (6-5,3-
1) and Stanford are all tied for first
with one loss each and as they move

into the second half of their season,
the Stanford women are focusing on
tourney time.
"Every game counts now to how
we are placed in playoffs," said head
coach Heidi Connor. "So this game
is huge."
Connor said that the traditional
rivalry alone is strong enough to
make for a good game because of
the emotional intensity generated.
Minds set on a first-place finish can
only help the effort. Because Cal is
the only other Division I team in the
league, it is sure to reciprocate with
tough competition.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford (6-4, 3-1
Western Women's Lacrosse
League) vs. California (6-5, 3-1). 1
p.m. New Maloney Field.
In the teams' first encounter this
season, Cal scored in the last two
minutes to tie the game and again in
the last 40 seconds to clinch the 10-9
victory. "It was our first game of the
season and it was pouring rain," said
Connor. "That first game was not
representative of who our team is."
Connor is confident, after a suc
cessful spring break tour to the East,
that the team now has what it takes
to come out on top. After beating
Holy Cross. Denver and Pennsylva
nia. a team that beat Stanford 19-8
last year. Stanford has shown
tremendous improvement and has
proven that it has what it takes to
play up with the tougher competi
tion.
