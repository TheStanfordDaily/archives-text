## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
Coming back to earn a win after facing a seemingly in
surmountable deficit has been one element ol the 15th
ranked Stanford men's volleyball team s (8-9,6-9 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) struggling season. This
tenacious spirit was apparent in January when the Car
dinal fought back for five-game victories over two high
ly ranked opponents. Hawaii and Loyola Marymount.
Wednesday night. Stanford was on the opposite end
of such a turnaround. After dropping the first two games,
the No. 12 Pacific Tigers (11-8, 8-7) battled back to win
their eighth conference match.
"I give Pacific a lot of credit," said Stanford head

coach Ruben Nieves. "We had put ourselves in a position
to win the match, but Pacific turned its game around."

The Cardinal's sideout problems did not affect the
outcome of the first two games. Once Pacific stepped up
its own caliber of play, however, the Tigers capitalized on
Stanford's sporadic level of intensity.

Between games two and three, the Tigers made the
most significant improvements in their defense. They
had 24 total team blocks to the Cardinal's eight. Thirteen
of these blocks occurred in games three and four, the
games which Pacific won by 15-8 and 15-6 decisions.
With Pacific's increased level of intensity, the Cardi
nal's sideout problems became very costly. The final
game typifies this scenario. The Tigers broke away from
a 12-12 tie to win three consecutive points — and the
match.
"We didn't sideout as consistently as we could have,"
Nieves said. "Pacific won because our sideout game
dropped considerably in games three, four and five."
Earlier in the match, the Tigers did not punish Stan
ford for these same errors.

After jumping out to an early lead, the Cardinal al
lowed the Tigers to accumulate a string of six unan
swered points to tie the score at 13 in the first frame.
Stanford was able to hold on to a 15-13 game-one win.
Despite the Cardinal's best overall team performance in
game two. these same errors were apparent in the second
frame. Although Stanford bolted out to another quick
lead, the Tigers battled back to maintain a competitive
position by tying the score at eight points a piece.
Although the Cardinal suffered a brutal loss at a crit
ical point in the season, many strong individual efforts in
dicate that the Stanford has adjusted well from recent
changes in the lineup.
