# Squaring off with No. 1
## Men's tennis takes on top-ranked Bruins 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
The No. 4 men's tennis team (11-1, 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference) begins its most im
portant weekend of the year thus far with a
match this afternoon at No. 1 IJCLA. The
Cardinal will then take on an almost equal
ly tough No. 10IJSC Trojan (14-2,2-I)team
tomorrow.
"It's always a dog fight down there." said
head coach Dick Gould. "I believe we've
only beaten UCLA fewer than 10 times
there in my 30 or so years of coaching. SC is
also playing tremendous tennis of late, so
both matches will be a true test for all of the
guys."
UCLA (16-1, 2-1) established itself as
the team to beat in February when it defeat
ed Illinois in the finals of the Team Indoor
Championship. The Bruins' only loss came
in early March when it fell at Arizona State
4-3. It has five players that made the top MX)
national rankings in singles and all three of
doubles teams are ranked in the top 30.
"It's always fun going down there to play
the Bruins and Trojans." said senior leader
Ryan Wolters. "They both get great fan
support and it almost has an NCAA feel to
it. I think we are where we need to be as a
team at this point in the season, though. We
know the main goal is still the NCAAs in
May. but the four matches against the L.A.
schools will be huge for rankings."
Wolters is currently the No. 3 singles

player in the nation and will go up against
UCLA's top player, Jane-Noel Grinda,
who is No. 8 in the nation and defeated
Wolters earlier in the year. This rematch
will clearly be one the key matches of the
weekend.

■ Today: No. 4 Stanford (11-1,5-0 Pacific 10

But perhaps a bigger key will be how the
Cardinal's three doubles teams handle the
weekend. Doubles has clearly been the Car
dinal's weakness thus far and it knows both
UCLA and USC have strong doubles
squads.
"We worked on doubles a lot this week
in practice," said sophomore Alex Kim.
"We weren't too satisfied over the break
with our doubles but I think we are a little
more confident now. We know the entire
weekend will be filled with a lot of ups and
downs, and we just have to stay focused in
doubles and singles."
The Cardinal knows that both matches
will be a good test for its younger players.
The team has not had very many extremely
tough and pressure-filled matches thus far,
and a weekend like this can show what kind
of character a team has. Against Arizona
State, the experienced Cardinal players

seemed to lift their level when they needed
to, and the Cardinal hopes to see some of
the same thing from its younger guys.
"This weekend will be a true test of how
good we are and whether we can perform
when we need to," said sophomore Ali
Ansari. "It will be a packed house both days,
and it really comes down to who wants it
more and who stays focused on the big
points. It will be great for us younger guys to
experience this kind of intense atmosphere
before the NCAAs."
Ansari and sophomore Scotty Scott are
essentially playing in their first year since
they were not in the starting lineup of last
year's championship squad. Freshman K.J.
Hippensteel, currently the No. 13 singles
player in the nation, is also trying to gain as
much experience as he can before May.
Thus far Hippensteel has seemed to learn
rather quickly, as he suffered only his first
singles loss of the season last weekend
against Arizona Sate. His duel match record
is now 11-1.
Hippensteel and the entire Cardinal
squad know they need to be at their best to
get one or possibly two victories out the
weekend. They also cannot afford to have a
letdown on Saturday against the Trojans.
"In some ways Sunday's match is just as
tough," Wolters said. "After an emotional
match on Friday it is sometimes hard to re
group for the next day. Both days will be
very important but also very fun if we come
to play."
