Editor's note: In IV6H, Andy Warhol
made tlw oft-quoted statement, "In
the future, everyone will he famous
for 15 minutes. " With that in mind,
in addition to the idea that everyone
has a story to tell, this article is part of
a series about various members of
the Stanford community. Interview
subjects are picked at random from
the Stanford Directory.
Kalpana Kotaga got tired of
picking aluminum cans out of the
garbage in eighth grade. She was
frustrated by students at her
Cincinnati school who ignored
their responsibility to the environ
ment.
"1 wanted them to start to un
derstand that putting [cans] in the
recycle bin shouldn't be something
to think about, especially when it's
right next to the trash." the senior
Okada resident said.
She started and directed an envi
ronmental organization, called
One Earth. One People, which has
grown to include more than 100
public and private schools in
Cincinnati.
"It's given kids a different sense
of the world, a greater sense of

stewardship," she said. The stu
dent-run organization creates
major Earth Day celebrations, pro
vides curriculum for teachers and
tackles issues such as water use and
protection of endangered species.
After graduating from Stanford

in June, Kota
ga, a double
major in earth
systems and
economics, in
tends to help
grassroots or
ganizations.
"There is a

public interest
in protecting clean water and the
environment," she said. "When
large corporations have money to
spend to push policy makers, you
have to exercise the democracy
muscle."
She plans to eventually work
with environmental policy "to cre
ate a more sustainable society."
"I hope 1 will have had some im
pact with the way American society
treats the natural world," Kotaga
said, envisioning her tuture.
In addition to her concern for
the environment. Kotaga also has
strong convictions about the im
portance of good health.

She tries to maintain her own
well-being by spending time out
doors. "Even if it's driving to Half
Moon Bay and spending a few
hours on the beach, being outdoors
recharges me."
Bharat Natayam dance, a tradi
tional South Asian art form, also
energizes Kotaga. She began learn
ing dance when she was four. "It's a
major part of my life. It walks that
line between South Asian and
American and fuses the two."
As an ethnic theme associate in
Okada, Kotaga became aware of
other students neglecting their
health. "As a person at some level
responsible for the community in
the dorm. I watch out for their
health."
"It's hard to be healthy," she
said. She finds that Stanford "is not
conducive to developing all aspects
of yourself... . It's really important
that students recognize the whole
ness of selves."
"You know how students are at
the eighth and ninth week of the
quarter — not sleeping, not eating
properly, haven't been outside,"
she said. "It's not unique to Stan
ford ... academics force us to em
phasize the intellectual and the
other stuff i»ets left out."

Kotaga is not alone in her family
with her concern for the health of

others around her.
1 ler parents are
both doctors at the
University of
Cincinnati Med
ical Center and
Children's Hospi
tal, and they in
spire her with
their "love of their
profession."

"I can find a lot of heroes in my
family in the last generations," Ko
taga said. "My parents have made
life better in Cincinnati."
She calls her mother, a neona
tologist, "a rebel," because "she's a
small, brown woman, and every
day she interacts with white men.
She hasn't bowed to society pres
sures. ... She needed to make her
own rules to make herself happy,
and she has made her own path."
She respects her father, a kidney
specialist, because "lie's just as
much a feminist as [my mom] is. It's
hard for men to work for equal
partnership, even today."
Kotaga feels fortunate that "My
parents always supported me, even
when my direction was non-tradi
tional," she said.
