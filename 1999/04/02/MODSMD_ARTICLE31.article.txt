# Battling for the top spot
## No. 2 women's water polo faces No. 1 USC 
### Mo Eger 
When the top two teams in any
sport meet, an exciting game is pret
ty much guaranteed. And when the
second-ranked team hosts the top
ranked team, chances are that an
upset could very well occur.
An upset is what the No. 2 Stan
ford women's water polo team (15-
2, <S-() Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) is aiming for when it takes
on the No. I USC Trojans (18-1,6-
I) tomorrow at noon. Assuming
I JSC beats the No. 10 San Jose State
Spartans today, Stanford, the only
undefeated team in the conference,
will most likely be playing for the
MPSF regular-season title and top
seed in the upcoming MPSF Tour
nament (April 9-11).
USC does have the experience
of beating the ('ardinal once before.
The Stanford team fell in the finals
of the UC-Santa Barbara Invita
tional 7-4.
The Trojans have a "big advan
tage in front-court offense," said
head coach John Tanner. "They
have four really skilled shooters and
two two-meter players who are very
strong and effective."
The USC team is very capable
both on the perimeter and from

hole-set. The Cardinal will need to
play heads-up defense to keep USC
from scoring. Not losing concentra
tion and giving the Trojans any easy
open shots will be crucial.
USC is "also very good on 6-on
-5 power plays as well as 5-on-6 dis
advantages," Tanner added. "If we
can convert at the same rate on 6-
on-.S advantages, then we have a
good chance of winning the game."
If this game is as physical as their

last meeting, both Stanford and
USC should get a number of ejec
tions and man-up advantages. The
Stanford team must capitalize on
each opportunity and put away the
shots that will come from these
kickouts. Stanford will look to
sophomores Kelly Shouey, Dani
Bell and freshman Kate Pettit at the
two-meter position to turn the Tro
jan defense and draw these kick
outs.
Sophomores Kris Koblik and
Anne-Marie Keenan, both left
handed and great shots, will prove

important in running the Cardi
nal's 6-on-5 plays from the six-po
sition.
(JSC's outside shooters could
pose a challenge for Stanford and
the Cardinal defense must be top
notch when down a player. The
Stanford cage is well protected with
senior goalie Heather Crary, but
the team has to play tight on IJSC
and treat Crary as a last line of de
fense.
"If we can raise the tempo of the
game and make them uncomfort
able, then we can win the game,"
said Tanner.
No one doubts that IJSC is a
strong team, but no one should
think that Stanford isn't very capa
ble of upsetting the Trojans and
taking the MPSF regular-season
title.
The Cardinal has already
claimed a victory of this magnitude
by upsetting then-No. 1 UCLA in
its season opener at deGuerre pool
(Feb. 6).
The Cardinal has been prepar
ing for this game since its loss in
February and knows what it must
do to beat the Trojans.
The Cardinal has the ability, de
sire — and the home pool advan
tage.
