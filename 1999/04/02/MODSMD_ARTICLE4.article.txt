# Legal Dept. gets itself out of red
## 
### Keith Proctor 
Over the last five years, Stanford's
legal department has managed to
pull itself out of financial trouble, a
success that the department's head
attributes to a creative way of con
tracting out its work.
After being appointed as general
counsel in 1993. Michael Roster dis
covered a legal department $350,(HK)
in the red out of a $N. 5 million bud
get. Yet simply cutting personnel
would also cut the department's abil
ity to provide top-notch legal service.
"If to reduce the budget required
laying off two or three people, it
would have been painful to pick two
or three, and we still would not have
achieved the efficiency we were
looking for," said Roster, Stanford
Class of '67. "The real goal was effec
tive solutions."
To meet the challenge, the legal
department issued bids in 1994 to
outside law firms to handle the Uni
versity's legal problems. The chosen
firms work with Roster's department
to address Stanford's legal concerns.
In the first year, the new system

led to SSIK).(KK) in savings, said Ros
ter. Much of this was due to an inno
vative way of dealing with outside
firms, leading to less litigation.
The legal department's approach
to active engagement with outside

lawyers was rev
olutionary, ae
cording to Ros
ter. Usually,
when a client
employs numer
ous groups of
lawyers, the dif
ferent firms com
municate with one

another through the client. At Stan
ford's legal department, walls have
been torn down and different firms
share the department's office space.
"1 forced them to become partners."
Roster said, "Five years ago that
would have been very unusual."
Yet the issue was not merely find
ing and integrating outside expertise.
Roster's engagement with outside
firms went along with a tactic to re
duce eostlv litigation in the future bv


Roster
ditching hourly billing for flat fees per
case. Law firms, in order to maximize
profits, responded by seeking quick
resolutions, and not drawn-out trials.
Roster noted that under former
conflict resolution, with hourly billing
rates, lawyers hired by opposing sides
fostered confrontational engage
ments, with one side threatening to
sue the other â€” an approach Roster
does not see as constructive. "We

needed to see lawyers as problem
solvers."
Roster estimated that under this
new practice, disputes may common
ly be resolved in one to two weeks.
"Companies will pay a very high price
for this kind of service."
The trend does not stop at Stan
ford. According to Roster, more in
stitutions across the board pursue
outside-and-inside-counsel coopera
tion. "Today it's in the front. Virtual
ly all general counsels are thinking
'how do I improve my relationship
with outside law firms?'"
