Bucking the national trend, the
percentage of minority students at
the Stanford School of Law has re
mained constant over time.
Many universities are struggling
to attract more ethnic students.
The Law School however, is not
seeking to increase its percentage
of minority students. It is continu
ing its "commitment to a diverse
student population," said Law
School Dean Brest.
Race and ethnicity are signifi
cant. but only one of the deciding
factors in accepting students, said
Dean Brest. He added the Law
School looks for "diversity across a
whole range of criteria."

The Law School therefore dif
fers from universities such as Dart
mouth and Duke which place eth
nicity at the forefront of the re
cruiting process.
While racial problems have not
proven to be a great problem at the
Law School, incidents still do
occur, Brest said. Earlier this year
an anonymous racially charged e
mail was sent to students in the
class of professor Kendall Thomas,
who is black. Law School adminis
trators immediately condemned
the e-mail, while defending the
right of the e-mail's author to voice
his or her opinion.
"The administration needs to
make clear that we are a welcoming
environment," said Dean Brest.

The percentage of minority stu
dents enrolled in the Law School as
of October 1. 1998 is 32 percent.
"While we fluctuate from year
to year the enrollment of minority
students is not really going up."
Brest said.
At the moment efforts are being
made to maintain, rather than in
crease, the diversity of the Law
School. Student groups voice the
needs of minority, and keep their
presence felt in the Law School.
"1 think the Law School is doing
the best they can, there are only so
many things the Law School can do
to encourage to minorities — you
can only make them feel so wel
come," said Win Hwangbo, the
treasurer of the Asian Pacific Is

lander Law Student's Association.
"It should be a priority for ad
mission officers to recruit top mi
nority students from around the
country. . . enrollment figures
should better reflect the composi
tion of the population." said the
treasurer of the Stanford Latino
Law Students Association, Nadia
Bermudez.
Controversy has surrounded the
Law School in recent months as the
February departure of law profes
sor Linda Mabry. who is black, fu
eled charges that the Law School
lacks faculty diversity.
Law School administrators have
emphasized the commitment of the
school to achieving a diverse facul
ty and student body.
