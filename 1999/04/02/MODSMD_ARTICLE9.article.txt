## Serbs capture three U.S. soldiers 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
United States branded as an illegal
abduction the capture of three Army
soldiers near the Macedonian-
Yugoslav border. President Clinton
said yesterday that he holds
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo
sevic responsible and warned him to
"make no mistake" and release them
immediately.
Yugoslavia said the soldiers were
invaders and would face criminal
trial before a military court today.
The announcement added a new and
unsettling element to the expanding
Balkan conflict.
Mixed with images of Kosovar
Albanian refugees fleeing from

apparent Yugoslav "ethnic cleans
ing" operations were television pic
tures apparently from Pristina, the
Kosovar provincial capital, showing
the three American soldiers in cap
tivity. They bore facial cuts and
bruises.
NATO airstrikes, meanwhile,
continued across a broad spectrum
of targets, and Clinton pledged to see
the Yugoslav mission through
despite the hazards.
"The United States takes care of
its own," Clinton said to emotional
applause from service members
gathered at Norfolk Naval Base in
Virginia. "President Milosevic
should make no mistake: We will

hold him and his government
responsible for their safety and their
well-being."
The Pentagon backed away from
its initial assertion that the soldiers
had not crossed into Yugoslav terri
tory. But the Clinton administration
maintained that the capture of the
soldiers was illegal.
"There was absolutely no basis
for them to be taken." Clinton said.
"There is no basis for them to be
held. There is certainly no basis for
them to be tried."
Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister
Vuk Draskovic told The Associated
Press that the soldiers, who were
caught yesterday, would be treated

"with the full respect of all interna
tional conventions concerning pris
oners of war."
The Pentagon identified the three
as Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24,
of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christo
pher J. Stone, 25. of Smiths Creek,
Mich.; and Spe. Steven M. Gonzales,
21, of Huntsville, Texas.
Draskovic said the wounds clear
ly visible on one soldier resulted
from his "trying to light physically
before being arrested." But U.S. offi
cials voiced concern.
"We have a long memory about
these kinds of things." U.S. Army
Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO com
mander, said.
