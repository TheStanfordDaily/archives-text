CS 17 —ELEMENTARY HYGIENE FOR CS MAJORS
Lather. Rinse. Repeat. 1 unit.
HIUM 3 — MEDIOCRE WORKS
Having covered great works of literature in the previous 2 quar
ters, now consider these still "important" texts. Readings
include Stephen Crane, Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cressida,"
Anna Deveare Smith, "The Bridges of Madison County," the
entire output of the Beat generation, as well as almost any novel
written by a Frenchman this century. (4 units)
COMPARATIVE LITERATURE 256 — EPISTEMOLO6Y OF FILTH
Western culture has been founded on the separation of the
(oppressive, misogynist, capitalist) self from the Other. This
seminar will examine the segregation of the unclean. What is
the semiotic function of bathrooms, especially those that are
gender-segregated? What does post-colonial theory teach us
about lack of hygiene as a building block for emerging Third
World societies? The applications of postmodern theory to
glory-holes and the extensive subculture of diaper-wearers. A
field trip to the fraternity Tow and the co-ops. Readings include
Freud, Rabelais, Jean Genet and "Everybody Poops." (5 units)
FRENCH 174 —FRENCH PRONUNCIATION FOR SLE STUDENTS
AND COMP LIT MAJORS
It frequently happens that when trying to impress your fellow
intellectuals, you inadvertently mispronounce a simple French
name or term like "Baudelaire" or "joie de vivre." This class will
provide you with necessary skills for interacting with SLE
majors or the Eurotrash grad students who sit outside of the
CoHo smoking Dunhills. Topics covered: obscure French intel
lectuals, deconstruction jargon, macking, wines. (4units)
COMPARATIVE LITERATURE 160 —BOLIVIAN LESBIAN WRITERS
WITH SPEECH IMPEDIMENTS AND EATIN6 DISORDERS
This class will explore the under-represented sub-group of
world art. Since no real books, short stories or poems have ever
been written by these remarkable women, the professor of the
course invited her close friends (who fit the characteristics) over
to her house for a cocktail party where she encouraged them to
write original works of poetry and prose. The results can be
found in her sometimes shocking and always entertaining
course reader. Some works remain unfinished (as some guests
got drunk, were double parked or had to leave the party early).
(3-5 units)
