# ARTISTIC BODIES
## Body piercings, tattoos grow more common 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
Public defender Ellenor Frutt of ABC's "The Prac
tice" sports twelve piercings in her left ear and one in
her right. Since the fourth season of "The X-Files,"
strait-laced FBI agent Dana Scully has had a tattoo of
a snake eating its own tail on her lower back.
From models selling Volkswagens and Hershey bars
to television characters and now. college students,
"body art" — tattoos, piercings, branding, and even
"sewing" of the skin — has moved out of the fringe
and into the mainstream.
A recent survey of IS American universities and
one Australian university conducted by Walter He
witt and Judith Grief, nurses at Rutgers University,
has found that body art crosses racial and gender lines.
According to the report in the Chronicle of Higher
Education, students in all disciplines, from fine arts to
engineering, said they had tattoos or piercings other
than in the ear. More than half of these students had a
grade point average of 3.0 or higher.
Not impervious to trends, more Stanford students
than ever are also getting pierced and tattooed, ac
cording to Cowell staff physician John Dorman.
"There are two categories of people [with body
art]. Some come in with infections and problems and
others simply come in for other services and happen to
have them [piercings and tattoos]. We are seeing in
creasing numbers in both groups," he said.
Dorman added that, generally speaking, a majority
of these patients are women and younger students.
Piercer Paul Stoll of Body Manipulations in San
Francisco said most of his clients are college students
but disagreed about the likelihood of piercing mem
bers of particular demographic groups.
"We used to be able to say who comes in to get
what done, but now. it seems to be standard," Stoll
said. "Piercing is mainstream and everybody gets
them."
"A lot of people have piercings and tattoos, espe
cially the Chinese tattoos," said junior Keziah Robin
son who has two tattoos, a nose ring and six ear carti
lage piercings. "The middle-class has so appropriated
this art form that it has lost some of its political mes
sage."
"You assume they [mainstream people] are getting

their ears pierced, but a lot of those
folks are getting the piercings you
don't see." said Stoll.
Dorman said he has not seen any
genital rings but admitted he would
probably not see them unless there
were problems.
Strictly ornamental value aside,
some students who own loss visible,
more unusual piercings cite illicit ex
citement as an reason for piercing
sensitive parts of their anatomy.

"I listen to Matchbox 20. All my
clothes are from the (iAPand Eddie
Bauer. I'm completely preppy. But
behind the scenes, there's a badness
about me. That's the fun of pierc
ings," said a Stanford senior who
does not wish lobe named because of
upcoming job interviews.
She has six earrings, a tongue ring,
a nipple ring and ;i horizontal clitoral
hood ring.
According to this senior, she has
never had any infections from her
piercings, except for some routine
swelling in her nipple and tenderness
in her clitoral hood.
While most fans of body art denv

that their piercings and tattoos are
painful, others may wonder why they
would "mutilate" their bodies.
Tattoo artist Paco Diet/ of
Graven Image Tattoo in Redwood
C ity. who tattoos the Stanford varsity
swim team, said body art is initially a
rite of passage for some.
"At first, people see their friends
with a design," said Diet/. "They
think It looks cool.' Then, once you
cross the boundary, their second and
third are more individual."
Junior Jean Mali, who has a five
inch-long color tattoo of a koi fish
with Buddhist characters that are tal
ismans against evil, said that she first

learned about tattoos from a friend
whose father had five or six of them.
"I thought it was a beautiful art
form," Mali said. She considered her
options for about a year and finally
decided on her current design and
placement, on her outer left thigh.
"I caught the piercing bug," said
the senior with the multitude of pierc
ings. "As I'm progressing, I just want
to see how hardcore I can be."
The same senior added that a sec
ondary reason for her clitoral hood
ring is a sexual one.
"Some guys are not knowledge
able about the clitoris. For them, it
[the ring] is a 'right here guys' kind of

sign," she said.
Robinson got her first piercing to
rebel against her preparatory high
school.
"I was looking for something dif
ferent. so I grasped onto the alterna
tive scene," she said.
()f course, enthusiasts cite myriad
other reasons for body art.
"People get them because they
broke up with someone, they [sym
bolically] want their body back, lash
ion. or because they want others to
think something of them." Stoll said.
"I got my nipple ring mostly for
sensation." said sophomore Josh
Samuels. "It feels nifty!"

Despite the prevalence of pierc
ings and tattoos on campus, students
still felt they are inappropriate for
formal events or meetings with older,
more conservative people.
"I don't wear my rings to places
where I want to impress people," said
Robinson. "I didn't wear any of these
rings to my Merril Lynch interview."
According to the oft-pierced se
nior. "among older people, nipple
and genital rings are still sketchy.
People think you're a very sexual per
son."
"But to me. they appeal to my
sense of humor and my sense of ad
venture," she said.
