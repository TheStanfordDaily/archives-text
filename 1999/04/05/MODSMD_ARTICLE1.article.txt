# ARTISTIC BODIES
## Body piercings, tattoos grow more common 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
Public defender Ellenor Frutt of ABC's "The Prac
tice" sports twelve piercings in her left ear and one in
her right. Since the fourth season of "The X-Files,"
strait-laced FBI agent Dana Scully has had a tattoo of
a snake eating its own tail on her lower back.
From models selling Volkswagens and Hershey bars
to television characters and now. college students,
"body art" — tattoos, piercings, branding, and even
"sewing" of the skin — has moved out of the fringe
and into the mainstream.
A recent survey of IS American universities and
one Australian university conducted by Walter He
witt and Judith Grief, nurses at Rutgers University,
has found that body art crosses racial and gender lines.
According to the report in the Chronicle of Higher
Education, students in all disciplines, from fine arts to
engineering, said they had tattoos or piercings other
than in the ear. More than half of these students had a
grade point average of 3.0 or higher.
Not impervious to trends, more Stanford students
than ever are also getting pierced and tattooed, ac
cording to Cowell staff physician John Dorman.
"There are two categories of people [with body
art]. Some come in with infections and problems and
others simply come in for other services and happen to
have them [piercings and tattoos]. We are seeing in
creasing numbers in both groups," he said.
Dorman added that, generally speaking, a majority
of these patients are women and younger students.
Piercer Paul Stoll of Body Manipulations in San
Francisco said most of his clients are college students
but disagreed about the likelihood of piercing mem
bers of particular demographic groups.
"We used to be able to say who comes in to get
what done, but now. it seems to be standard," Stoll
said. "Piercing is mainstream and everybody gets
them."
"A lot of people have piercings and tattoos, espe
cially the Chinese tattoos," said junior Keziah Robin
son who has two tattoos, a nose ring and six ear carti
lage piercings. "The middle-class has so appropriated
this art form that it has lost some of its political mes
sage."
"You assume they [mainstream people] are getting
