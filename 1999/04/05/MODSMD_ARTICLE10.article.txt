WASHINGTON (AP) â€” GOP presidential hopeful
Pat Buchanan is accusing the Clinton administration of
feeding China's trade surplus rather than paying atten
tion to "clear and ominous" signs of Chinese aggression
towards Taiwan.
Buchanan, in remarks prepared for delivery today at
San Francisco's Commonwealth Club, a nonpartisan
public affairs forum, described the president's C hina
trade policy as a "demonstrable failure." He accused
U.S. officials of turning a blind eye to human rights vio
lations in China.
"For Americans there must always be some things
still greater in the hierarchy of values than the bottom
line of a balance sheet," Buchanan said. "It's time to put
country before commerce and let America be America
again."
China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, visits Washing
ton this week. One topic under discussion is Beijing's
application to enter the World Trade Organization.
"What the president ought to tell Mr. Zhu Rongji
when he gets here is, 'Sir, you double-crossed us and
we're gonna suspend (China's normal trade status) for
one year, and we're gonna impose on you the same taxes
on your goods entering our country as you impose on
our goods entering yours,'" Buchanan said yesterday on
"Fox News Sunday."
Buchanan said the United States easily could drop
China as a trade partner, because less than 2 percent of
its exports went to China last year. Beijing, he said, crafts
its trade policies to augment state power.
He also charged that China steadily has increased the
number of missiles it targets against Taiwan, boosted its
forces and mock test-fired missiles at U.S. forces on Oki
nawa, Japan, and in South Korea.
"China is now clearly preparing for another crisis to
force Taiwan back to the 'embrace of the Motherland'
and intends to use the threat of a missile blockade if Tai
wan resists," Buchanan said.

He predicted China would put every U.S. warship
and base "between the Asian coast and Guam" at risk if
American forces intervene.
Buchanan urged Congress to impose taxes on
imports from China; suspend China's "most favored
nation" status until it improves its human rights record;
veto loans to China by the World Bank or the Asian
Development Bank; and contest attempts to admit
China into the WTO.
