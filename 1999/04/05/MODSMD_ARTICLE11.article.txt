BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — NATO warplanes
and missiles attacked an army headquarters, oil refiner
ies and other targets in and around Belgrade yesterday,
while Yugoslav forces drove towards Kosovo's western
mountains where ethnic Albanian guerrillas were
preparing a last stand.
Relief (lights, meanwhile, began an airlift to carry
some refugees to European countries as aid agencies and
Western nations struggled to help the more than 300,(M)
people forced out of Kosovo and now overwhelming the
Serbian province's neighbors.
With mounting reports of mass killings and other
atrocities in a campaign by Serb forces to rid Kosovo of
ethnic Albanians, NATO officials again blamed poor
weather for limiting the effectiveness of the air attacks.
But clearing skies ewer Belgrade and other parts of
northern Serbia — the main republic in Yugoslavia —
allowed attacks on the Yugoslav First Army headquar
ters in the capital, along with petroleum tanks, an ammu
nition plant and highway bridges elsewhere, Air Com
modore David Wilbv said at NATO headquarters in
Brussels.
Wilby also said the Yugoslav military was shifting
forces in Kosovo to the southwest, where the rebel Koso
vo Liberation Army was regrouping for what appeared
to be a last stand.
"This is the last area where the (rebels) will be able to
mount a serious resistance," Wilby said of the mountain
ous region near the Albanian border.
The Tan jug state news agency said NATO attacks
yesterday afternoon hit unspecified targets near Klina,
27 miles west of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital.
It also reported NA TO missiles hit an oil refinery at
Pancevo, northeast of Belgrade, killing two workers and
injuring four, while a 73-year-old woman died and seven
people were injured in an attack on Cacak, an industrial
town 50 miles south of the capital.
In the capital's New Belgrade area, across the Sava
River from downtown, civil defense officials said a ther
mal heating plant was attacked, along with the police
academy in the Banjica suburb. Flames lit the clear,
moonlit night with a huge orange glow.

Those attacks came a few hours after NATO
airstrikes Saturday night destroyed the Freedom Bridge
across the Danube River at Novi Sad, Serbia's second
largest city, where another bridge was wrecked last
week. Both were major arteries between Belgrade and
Yugoslavia's northern agricultural and industrial region.
Yesterday, boats transported people across the
Danube in Novi Sad, which now only has one bridge left
over the river, south of the downtown.
British military spokesman Doug Henderson told
reporters yesterday that the NATO attacks were "cut
ting deep into the Serbian war machine."
But Vladimir Jovanovic, the Yugoslav ambassador to
the United Nations, maintained Belgrade's defiant
stance toward the NATO campaign.
"It only increases our resolve in defending our coun
try." he said on the U.S. television program "Fox News
Sunday."
The alliance launched air attacks on March 24 to try
to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
accept a peace plan for the southern Serbian province
that would include NATO peacekeeping troops on the
ground.
Since then, the campaign by Yugoslav security forces
to rid Kosovo its majority ethnic Albanians has over
whelmed Albania, Macedonia and Yugoslavia's other
republic, Montenegro, with refugees.
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said allied nations
were offering to take in some refugees temporarily and
provided the following figures — Germany (40,(MX)
refugees), the United States (2(),(KK)), Turkey (20,(XX)),
Norway (6,(XX)), Greece (S,(KK)) and Canada (S,(XX)).
"We are going to try very hard to share the burden"
in dealing with the refugee problem, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said on NBC's "Meet the
Press." She said some refugees may be airlifted out of
the region.
NATO also agreed to use the nearly 12,(KX) NATO
troops now deployed in Macedonia in any way to assist
in the humanitarian effort. Those troops originally were
deployed to implement the Kosovo peace plan if it were
accepted by both sides.

Kosovo refugees reach for food distributed at a field where more than 25,000 ethnic Albanians are
camped by the Yugoslav-Macedonian border. Refugees have arrived in Macedonia by the thousands,
causing chaos in the border area.
