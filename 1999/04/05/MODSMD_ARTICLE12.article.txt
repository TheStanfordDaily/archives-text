U.S. to recognize Cold War vets
WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a different kind of
conflict, a 46-year face-down between adversaries with
enough weapons to destroy the world but never willing
to use them against each other. Its end brought no
peace treaty, no parade of heroes.
But the Cold War was a war, the United States won,
and the victors were ignored. Army veteran Mark Vogl
insisted.
So Vogl began a letter-writing, signature-gathering
crusade in 1994 from his Bay Shore home on New
York's Long Island to get recognition for the men and
women who served.
Today, his efforts are being rewarded.
The Defense Department will begin taking applica
tions from those who served during the Cold War for a
"Cold War Recognition Certificate."
"All members of the armed forces and federal gov
ernment civilian personnel who faithfully served the
United States during the Cold War era" are eligible, a
Pentagon Web site said.
It also specifies the dates of the Cold War era: Sept.
2,1945, the date Japan surrendered after World War 11,
to Dec. 26, 1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as
the Soviet president and the Soviet Union was disband
ed.
An estimated 22 million people meet the eligibility
requirements. An application letter with a document
proving service during the period is enough to show the
applicant served honorably, the Pentagon Web site
said.
The certificate is symbolic. No financial reward is
involved.
But Vogl, 43, said it goes a long way toward showing
the role of those who fought to keep the protagonists at
bay as the United States and the Soviet Union raced to
pump up their nuclear arsenals.

IRA protests Irish peace plan
DUBLIN. Ireland (AP) — In drum-thumping East
er ceremonies, Irish Republican Army supporters yes
terday criticized the latest peace initiative for Northern
Ireland, which requires a commitment from the IRA to
disarm.
The annual rallies in more than 30 locations came
three days after the British and Irish prime ministers,
Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, put forward a compro
mise for achieving a new Protestant-Catholic govern
ment for Northern Ireland, centerpiece of last year's
peace accord.
The two leaders proposed that the IRA's Sinn Fein
party be given its two allotted government posts one
month before the IRA disposed of some weaponry.
They were seeking to reconcile the IRA's refusal to
disarm at all with Protestant politicians' refusal to share
power alongside Sinn Fein unless disarmament began
first, a dilemma that has blocked formation of the 12-
meniber government for the past year.
The would-be Protestant leader of the government,
David Trimble, welcomed the compromise.
But Sinn Fein politicians in speech after speech yes
terday criticized the prime ministers' agreement that
Sinn Fein eligibility for office should depend on IRA
actions.
Speaking in the Dublin cemetery where the execut
ed leaders of an Easter 1916 rebellion against British
rule are buried, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the
IRA felt under no obligation to disarm, and considered
the disarmament demands a provocation.
Adams called on the British army and Northern Ire
land police to publish a joint schedule of troop with
drawals and barracks closures.
Blair and Ahern pledged such a withdrawal would
be done at the same time as the IRA's first act of disar
mament.

Small group marks King's death
MEMPHIS, Term. (AP) — One year after 4,000
marchers stretched six blocks to mark the 30th anniver
sary of the death of Martin Luther King Jr.. a scant 15
showed up yesterday to remember the slain civil rights
leader.
The 31st anniversary rally, sponsored by the Mem
phis chapter of the NAACP youth council, featured
chants, songs and speeches. The group stood under the
balcony of The Lorraine Motel, where King was assas
sinated in 1%8.
"Society can be reborn again if we can stop violence
and stop the hate," said 15-year-old Aren Cowan, the
council's vice president, in one speech. She noted this
was the first year the anniversary has fallen on an East
er Sunday.
The motel is now the site of the National Civil Rights
Museum, where many visitors were unaware of the
day's significance as they wandered upon the afternoon
rally.
Kim Peters, a teacher from Fredericksburg, Va.. said
King is among the famous black Americans her classes
discuss during February's black history month.
The low-key rally was a stark contrast to the 30th
anniversary, when thousands of marchers, led by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and Memphis Mayor W.W. 1 leren
ton, sang "We Shall Overcome" and other standards
from the civil rights movement and carried pictures of
King and signs saying, "Remember the Man and the
Message."
Elsewhere in Memphis, several multiracial commu
nity worship services yesterday remembered King's life
and death while celebrating Easter.
King was slain in Memphis while helping organize a
strike by city sanitation workers. He was standing on
the balcony of The Lorraine when he was felled by a
single rifle slug.

Companies limit New Year's parties
CLEVELAND (AP) — Save the champagne for
another occasion. This New Year's Eve is going to be
dry for thousands of workers pulling Y2K duty.
Fears that the Year 2(XX) computer bug will create
havoc has caused companies nationwide to limit —
even forbid — vacation time at the end of the year.
Some of the bans are just a couple days or so. Others
will last months. Technicians, utility workers, bankers,
city employees, emergency personnel and financial con
sultants are among those who'll be shelving their party
hats and noisemakers come Dec. 31.
The blackout periods have some workers grousing,
but others-are taking the situation in stride.
Willie Kennedy had hoped to toast the new year in
the Caribbean warmth of Aruba. He and his wife,
Shawn, had planned the island trip for years.
Instead, Kennedy, a computer technician for the
Cleveland-based bank KeyCorp, will watch the calen
dar turn at his desk while his wife celebrates at home
with their two pre-teen sons.
"We thought it'd be nice to sit on a warm beach
while Cleveland is freezing. Now it's out of the ques
tion." savs Kennedy, who is in charge of making sure
the computer system doesn't crash in any of KeyCorp's
%() branches. The bank has told about a fourth of its
workers they will have New Year's Eve duty.
The Y2K concern involves computers designed to
recognize only the last two digits of a year, so that 2(XX)
could be misread as 19(X). Some predict widespread
problems such as power outages, communication and
transportation disruptions, lost documents and crippled
automatic tellers.
"During that time frame, my heart is going to be rac
ing so fast with excitement. This is the biggest New
Year's Eve of a lifetime and the biggest for my career,"
Kennedy said.
