Police initiative to target
jaywalkers is a poor
attempt to ease traffic

Palo Alto's recently announced
crackdown on jaywalking
approaches the absurd.
In dealing with congestion that is
indisputably present in downtown
Palo Alto, punishing jaywalkers with
harsh fines is an inadequate, misdi
rected solution. Palo Alto seems
reluctant to impinge on the vehicles of
its tax-paying citizens and thus pro
vides an inherently biased solution.
Iliis is not to say that the Palo Alto
police do not deal with cars and do
not do their jobs admirably â€” they
do. However, strictly enforcing an
unfairly stiff penalty for a minor
infraction seems to us a prejudiced
course of action.
After studying traffic patterns for
three hours, the Palo Alto Police
Department concluded that jaywalk
ing was the source of numerous acci
dents.
Operating on the logic that a mere
three hours of observing downtown
traffic could lead to a reasonable con
clusion, the police deduced that engi
neering (such as poorly-timed traffic
lights and unclear signs) was not a
problem.
It is impossible to dismiss the prob
lems with forming policy based on this
ill-conceived, extremely limited
experiment that could not possibly
represent the actual overall traffic sit
uation on University Avenue.
Engineering was exonerated as a
traffic problem only by ignoring the

fact that many of the confusing streets
in question are only one-way, that the
area streets in general are ill
equipped to handle the volume of
traffic they receive and that parking is
extremely scarce.
Additionally, this measure seems to
ignore the fact that the traffic volume
in downtown Palo Alto, both in terms
of pedestrians and automobiles, is
some of the heaviest in the region.
Cracking down on walkers in such a
crowded area is almost as ridiculous
as trying to curb jaywalking violations
in New York City.
In order to deal with the conges
tion problem effectively, Palo Alto
has no choice but to change those
engineering features that limit access
to University Avenue; namely, the
pronounced lack of adequate parking
and the ill-conceived network of
streets adjacent to the thoroughfare.
The proposed method of enforce
ment, a $55 fine, is also well beyond
reason.
The institutions of the city of Palo
Alto seem always to choose the
wrong target to attack when address
ing city issues. When Palo Alto
homeless were in dispute with local
merchants, the city council adopted
an unnecessarily harsh policy toward
transients that was a thinly-veiled
attempt to make life for them as dif
ficult as possible rather than provide
solutions via adequate social ser
vices.
Finally, the availability of Palo Alto
police officers to handle such petty
infractions as jaywalking would seem
to testify that Palo Alto has no serious
crimes that require the attention of
law enforcement.
