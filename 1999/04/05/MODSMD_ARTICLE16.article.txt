Riding my bike
like a madwoman
through White
Plaza this past Friday,
dodging the early crop of
ProFro's and their expec
tant parents, a smattering
of words in pastel side-
U« 'TV. b

walk chalk caught my eye. lo my knowl
edge, this is the third installment in a pre
sumably unlimited series of philosophical
comments — in a very loosely constructed
form — by some anonymous member of
the University community. Signed with a
symbol resembling a hieroglyphic eye and
the word "Ashen," this past message
appeared to be a plea by the artist to let his
or her work remain, to not erase it willingly
and leave its destruction to the elements.
My first reaction upon seeing this poet of
the pavement's work was"I wonder how
they sneak out here and write this without
anyone noticing?" and then "1 wonder if
anyone has tried to find out who it is?"
Because 1 can use this space as my personal
soapbox, 1 want to say to whoever is sneak
ing out and writing short installments of
thoughtful (if not somewhat esoteric) com
mentary where it can be publicly accessible:
don't stop.
Like the little, weird graffiti-bird labels
that have been cropping up in the History
Corner, this sidewalk writing could be con
sidering tagging and therefore not accept
able to the University's clean campus poli
cy. It also could complicate matters of free
expression on campus — who's to say that
anyone should be able to inscribe anything
upon a public space, unregulated and

uncensored? There is certainly potential for
insult and injury, and if necessary, I am sure
that the lumbering beast of University
bureaucracy would awaken from hiberna
tion and dispense a reasonable verdict.
Questions of free expression have the
power to force us as a community to recon
sider how we fit in collectively with Ameri
can ideals of constitutionally guaranteed
free speech.
That considered, my feelings on this par
ticular form of expression are simple. I love
what this person is trying to say. 1 love that
someone is trying to speak in a medium that
has been reserved for party announcements
and online book sales. 1 love that someone
is brave and humble enough to present pri
vate thoughts to a mass audience.
Anonymity does not necessarily have at its
core shame or cowardice but rather in some
cases a desire to break apart our need for
associative authorship — putting a face
with the name and the thought, so to speak.
Although it relies on a high standard of per
sonal judgment and discriminating thought,
anonymous expression could be for the
author a self-imposed test of intellectual
resolve. Having only oneself to face, while
knowing that a large audience greets your
work daily, is intimidating if not paralyzing.
But then, anonymity makes it easier than,
say, writing a really bad column for The
Daily and sitting down to the critical reader
base at lunch.
Here, the message is all the more potent
because you, the sidewalk poet, are no one,
and therefore everywhere. Perhaps egotism
or artistic spontaneity first induced you to
take chalk to asphalt and compose, but per-

haps it was a quiet sense of activism. Did
you recognize some disparity in the
thoughts of your fellow students and their
complacent manifestations? Is it the result
of some random upper-level studio art class
that no one else has heard about? Is this
your way of setting things on their head, or
is it just a fun thing to do on a Sunday night
while all the frosh are at Flicks?
It is a fortunate thing that what I would
like to believe is a quiet activism has been
inserted into our lives with such a freshly
persistent voice. It provides something that
some people would call "deep" in a sort of
hazy sense.
But real depth, not just saying something
impressive though painfully superficial in
section, is tough to come by. It is careful
thought; a compulsion to work through an
intellectual problem that you are not obli
gated to address, whether in the intricacies
of biophysics research done outside of class
or the desire to trace the genealogy of Vic
torian thought about human origins. It can
be anything because it is your own, and it
can be a fearsome and unforgiving taskmas
ter within a generally regimented intellectu
al space.
I spoke to a history professor once who
said research and writing were almost
addictive — it had become a pursuit that he
could not live without. That force within
everyday life, above anything else, is some
thing I dream about having. With or with
out the pretensions implicit in academia, to
seek passion and become dedicated to it.
