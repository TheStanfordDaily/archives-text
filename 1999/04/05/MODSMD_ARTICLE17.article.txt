Bookstore editorial mistaken
The naivete displayed by the editor of
The Daily when writing in support of "cor
poratizing" the Bookstore is a disservice
to the Stanford community and the stu
dents it serves. The editor makes refer
ence to a history of "financial scandal"
including losses of $2 million in the stock
market of Bookstore reserves. Yes. a for
mer controller made unauthorized invest
ments in the stock market, but it was the
Bookstore Board's decision to hastily sell
off the issues that incurred the loss. If the
stocks in such "speculative" companies as
Hewlett Packard and 3-Com had been
held, they would have earned the Book
store millions in profit. In fact, despite the
unfortunate stock loss, the Stanford Book
store has an outstanding financial history!
As to the scandal about elaborate perks
paid to previous management, the editor
again only need look at the facts to learn
that the perks were compensation to
retain the Bookstore's management team.
Furthermore, The Daily did not report
that the investigations concluded there
was no evidence of wrong doing by man
agement. Indeed, forensic auditors, legal
investigators and a Santa Clara County

judge lauded the Bookstore and its man
agement team for its exemplary integrity
and service to Stanford! Let us focus on
today's issue!
Who on the campus understands the
real impact of turning over the Bookstore
to a for-profit outsider? I ask students to
please use common sense in pondering
these questions.
Are the outside corporations in busi
ness to retain earnings from the Stanford
Bookstore for the benefit of Stanford?
Where do you suppose the profits they
earn on the business will go? How do
these corporations make their return from
the major investment they will make to
take over and run the Stanford Book
store? From lowering prices and improv
ing service? In fact, studies show that
prices rise and services diminish when an
outsider takes over a campus store. (Why
do you suppose Duke just decided NO T to
outsource their stores after studying the
proposition for over a year?)
And as to the positive comments the
editor attributes to institutions who have
outsourced their store, studies show that
such comments come from those who
make the decision to outsource, not from
the institutions' students and faculty. Be
wary about a decision to sell off your

Bookstore. I believe it is a move to try and
vindicate a Board who rarely has given
proper oversight to its operation. Leasing
the store is more palatable to them than
embarrassment of overseeing what is
becoming a poorly operated store. For
example, did you know the Business
School contracted with the USC Book
store to handle their text materials
because of the poor performance of the
Bookstore?
This is what you should do:
1. Direct the Bookstore Board to clean
up its act and direct the operation of an
efficient store that is an academic resource
to the University, and not sell off your
Bookstore!
2. Deny the University financial office
the millions of dollars (I estimate upwards
of $30 million over 5 years) they will
receive from selling Bookstore assets and
leasing the store. Those resources, in large
measure, come out of your pocket and you
should benefit from them directly.
3. Understand this decision for what it
is. It is about face saving and money, not
about what is best for you and for Stan
ford's academic reputation!

Store shouldn't be sold
I'm hoping you can shed light on one
unexamined (at least in your pages) aspect of
the Bookstore-privatization issue. In your
Friday editorial, you write: "ITie Bookstore's
board of directors said last month that it is
considering selling the non-profit store to a
for-profit company." Hut in articles pub
lished last week, you suggest that the Book
store will merely be bringing in an outside
concern to run its operations.
The distinction is an important one. I am
not opposed to a contract with an outside
vendor to run the Bookstore, much like Bon
Appetit has a concession to provide food at
Tresidder or Reliable has a concession for
laundry machines in campus dormitories.
But if the Bookstore is indeed contem
plating selling itself to an outside, for-profit
concern, I must strenuously object. The Uni
versity should not be in the business of selling
White Plaza real estate to any outside entity,
and I fear the slippery slope on which Stan
ford sets its foot when it sells — and remem
ber, a sale is forever — a central part of its
campus to Barnes & Noble or anyone else
who is not the University.
