# Where we are
## Defending the evil corporate empire 
###

HOW HAS THE most disparaging,
insulting remark one can make
become not an attack on one's
moral worth or one's momma but on one's
ties to corporate America?
Last week, when the Bookstore
announced that it would consider inviting
corporations such as Barnes & Noble to
take over its operations, there arose cries
of betrayal. The thought that our precious,
though far from beloved. Bookstore could
surrender its independence to the filthy
claws of a Corporation seemed to send a
collective shiver up the campus' spine, as if
the new beauty technician installed behind
the Clinique counter would be none other
than Slobodan Milosevic.
Even though this transfer of power
appears to benefit everyone involved —
the Bookstore would be given financial
relief, the students better selection and
prices — the mere association with any
thing corporate would seemingly soil our
otherwise, ahem, untainted University.
Indeed, align yourself with a corporate
partner, and be prepared to face the scorn
of your peers.
Although post-graduation corporate
"jobs bring with them above-average
salaries, they also bring immediate con
iempt, for there seems to be a tacit under
standing on this campus that those who
pursue such positions have somehow

"sold-out," neglecting their education and
ethics to pursue monetary success. In fact,
whenever someone writing a letter to the
editor wants to be particularly nasty about
a Daily article, there inevitably comes the
comment that the targeted writer should
go join an investment bank or consulting
firm and thus cease to be human.
The modern theological quandary then
becomes: is the Corporation the incarna
tion of the devil?
While many think this and have excel
lent reasons for believing so, stamping cor
porate America with such an all-encom
passing label is too easy a solution — a
solution that both slights those who work
for corporations and undermines corpo
rate critics' own goals of a more just world.
I do not wish, however, to be the
staunch defender of the corporate world,
for this is a world that challenges most of
our cherished beliefs about independence.
Relying on a "bottom-line" mentality in
which profits must prevail, the corporation
has come, in many ways, to elevate greed
as the ultimate good and place the human
element in a peripheral, if not subordinate,
position.
Sometimes this dehumanizing effect
takes on tragicomic proportions. In the
March issue of Continental Airlines' in
flight magazine, the company's CEO
boasts that its employees are so well

regarded that — are you sitting down? —
one or two times a year they are treated to
a pizza lunch. Oh, the benevolence! (And
this is when the company's profits total in
the hundreds of millions of dollars.)
Moreover, corporate America's popu
lation of the country with countless adver
tisements (soon to be seen on the uniforms
of professional baseball players) threatens
to dim the already dimming light of Amer
ican intellectualism.
If all we think about is buy, buy, buy
and all we crave is more, more, more, then
it becomes quite difficult to contemplate,
let alone push toward, such social goals as
improved education and health care sys
tems. Of course, corporations also exert so
much influence in government that even if
we were to strive for such goals, "big busi
ness" could prevent them from being real
ized if they did not coincide with their
own.
It seems only reasonable to character
ize the Corporation as the Enemy. And
yet, while this characterization might hold
on the macroscopic level, it cannot and
should not apply to the microscopic
level — that is, to the people who work as
part of a corporation.
When one ridicules another for work
ing for a corporation, one is implicitly
questioning the other's integrity. This cri
tique assumes that a corporate employee

cannot hold true to any sort of intellectual
or ethical principles; that the non-profit,
academic world is the fitting place for
noble work.
And yet it is difficult for me to see how
the scientists engaged in serious research
at pharmaceutical or telecommunications
companies are inherently different than
their academic counterparts.
Or that the businessmen and women
who study production lines will show fun
damentally less enthusiasm or passion for
their work than professors who study eco
nomics or engineering.
Or that the assembly-line or factory
workers (also part of the Corporation)
who work long hours to provide for their
families possess less courage or communal
sympathy than social workers or environ
mental advocates.
A person does not automatically lose
his or her self by signing on with a corpo
rate employer, and to make blanket con
demnations of those who do seems to me
to be the ultimate form of snobbery.
Indeed, those who "go corporate" do,
believe it or not, lead fulfilling lives out
side of their jobs. They volunteer, raise
healthy families, participate in the arts and
maintain a whole host of other "worthy"
activities.
It might be valuable to know that T.S.
Eliot worked eight years as a clerk for

Lloyd's Bank of London before writing
"The Waste Land," and American poet
Wallace Stevens worked as an executive of
the Hartford Accident and Indemnity
Company, composing verse on the side.
In fact, to change the way corporations
function, it is necessary to look at this indi
vidual level. For all corporations are not
the same, and the differences arise chiefly
from their people.
If one wants the corporate world to be
more socially responsible or environmen
tally conscious, then it could be more help
ful to join a corporation and change it
from within than merely sneer at it from
the outside. Activists who believe that crit
icizing the corporate world enough will
somehow make it disappear seem to be
incredibly naive.
The corporate system is entrenched, for
better or worse, and stapling 95 theses out
side of Bill Gates' door is not going to
bring cataclysmic change.
If we want corporations as a whole to
take an active part in improving our world,
then an individual, internal and involved
reformation needs to be enacted.

English, reports that his mother works for a
corporation, and he don't want nothing had
said about his momma.
