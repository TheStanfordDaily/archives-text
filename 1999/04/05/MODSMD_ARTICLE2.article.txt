Avaz International Dance Theatre, a South
ern California-based group, gave a sold-out per
formance in Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday.
The show, which was organized by Stanford's
Persian Student Association in commemora
tion of the Iranian New Year, attracted mem
bers of both the Stanford and the Bay Area
communities.
Sophomores Sheila Naghshineh and Nima
Safabakhsh opened the performance with
greetings in both Farsi and English, and ex
plained the history and significance of Norooz,
the Iranian New Year marked by the first day of
spring.
Then, Anthony Shay, Avaz founder and
artistic director, and his company took the stage,
performing dances and songs from different re
gions of Iran. The performances included tribal
folk, classical and urban dances.
"Dance is an aspect of other kinds of move

ment. The way people move, if they have loose
clothing or tight clothingâ€”all of that has a deep
impact on what the dances look like," Shay ex
plained. "So the dances have a certain uniformi
ty; yet they have certain differences."
Audiences reacted enthusiastically, often
singing and clapping along with the performers.
"I7ie show was awesome. I've heard Persian
music before because I have Persian friends, but
I had no idea it was so varied in its costumes,
dances and instruments," said junior Luke
Avila after the performance.
Shay started Avaz in 1976 after becoming in
terested in Persian culture through college
friends. Since its founding, Avaz has traveled
nationally and internationally, presenting the
dances, music, costumes and customs of differ
ent countries, including Hungary, Croatia,
Greece, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Avaz's mission is to preserve and perform
the traditional dances and music of different cul-
