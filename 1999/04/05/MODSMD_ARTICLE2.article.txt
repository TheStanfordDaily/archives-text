Avaz International Dance Theatre, a South
ern California-based group, gave a sold-out per
formance in Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday.
The show, which was organized by Stanford's
Persian Student Association in commemora
tion of the Iranian New Year, attracted mem
bers of both the Stanford and the Bay Area
communities.
Sophomores Sheila Naghshineh and Nima
Safabakhsh opened the performance with
greetings in both Farsi and English, and ex
plained the history and significance of Norooz,
the Iranian New Year marked by the first day of
spring.
Then, Anthony Shay, Avaz founder and
artistic director, and his company took the stage,
performing dances and songs from different re
gions of Iran. The performances included tribal
folk, classical and urban dances.
"Dance is an aspect of other kinds of move

ment. The way people move, if they have loose
clothing or tight clothingâ€”all of that has a deep
impact on what the dances look like," Shay ex
plained. "So the dances have a certain uniformi
ty; yet they have certain differences."
Audiences reacted enthusiastically, often
singing and clapping along with the performers.
"I7ie show was awesome. I've heard Persian
music before because I have Persian friends, but
I had no idea it was so varied in its costumes,
dances and instruments," said junior Luke
Avila after the performance.
Shay started Avaz in 1976 after becoming in
terested in Persian culture through college
friends. Since its founding, Avaz has traveled
nationally and internationally, presenting the
dances, music, costumes and customs of differ
ent countries, including Hungary, Croatia,
Greece, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Avaz's mission is to preserve and perform
the traditional dances and music of different cul-
tures and to educate audiences about
these art forms and the societies they
represent.
"I love dance and music and
thought that it would be the best way
to introduce non-Iranians to Iranian
culture. After the Iranian revolution,
it became imperative to show Iran in
a positive light," Shay said.
Shay has traveled to the Middle
East several times to research the
dances he choreographs and per
forms. He finds information by going
to the sites where the dances are per
formed. looking at archival films and
reading books. His new dances come
not only from Iran but from border
ing regions, such as Russia, that have
large Persian populations.
Shay has also learned some of the
dances performed bv Avaz through
people in the United States who have

come from different parts of the Per
sian world.
"We have people from every
where in our audience and they'll
often come up and ask 'Why didn't
you perform any dances from my
area?' Our dance from Bojnurd was
taught to us by a taxi driver who
asked me after a performance," Shay
recounted yesterday."He showed
me the dances in the costumes and I
filmed him. And from that film
footage we made the dance we did
today."
According to Shay, performances
have great emotional appeal.
"For the older members of the au
diences, we are a source of enormous
nostalgia and for the younger mem
bers, we are sometimes a revelation
and a source of pride," Shay said.
"We find this over and over in school
settings, where often children don't
know the traditions ... and it be
comes a way for them to reinvest in
their culture and their heritage."
