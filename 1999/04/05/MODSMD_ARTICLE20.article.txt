## Men's tennis splits against L.A. schools Team falls to Bruins, beats USC 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
The No. 4 men's tennis team went down to Los
Angeles last weekend to take on the No. 1 UCLA
Bruins and No. 10 USC Trojans and its results were
precisely as expected: a split. The Cardinal lost to
the top-ranked Bruins Friday 5-2 and came back
strongly to defeat USC 6-1 Saturday.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Friday: No. 1 UCLA (18-1,4-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) 5, No. 4 Stanford (12-2,5-1) 2.

■ Saturday: Stanford 6, No. 10 USC (15-

It was the Cardinal's (12-2, 5-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) most difficult weekend of the year thus far,
and the team was pleased to get out with a win. The
5-2 loss to UCLA (17-1. 3-1) on Friday was a much
closer match than the score indicates as several
matches could have swung either way. The team
was not overly discouraged, however, as it came
back to play solid tennis in its convincing win over
the Trojans (15-3, 4-2) the next day.
"Any time you can go down there and split, it's
fine," said assistant coach John Whitlinger. "We
saw that UCLA is a very good team, but definitely
a team we can beat. Saturday's match against USC
was a very important one for us because we needed
the win to remain one of the top five teams in the
nation."
With the win against the Trojans the Cardinal al
most assured itself a position to host one of the
NCAA regionals in May. Now it would almost take
a complete collapse for the Cardinal to have to go
on the road for regionals.
Senior Ryan Wolters also looked at the weekend
in a positive light. Wolters, currently the No. 3 sin
gles player in the nation, was defeated on Friday by
UCLA's Jean-Noel Grinda (No. 8 nationally), but
came back to play a great match against USC. He
was one of several Cardinal players who had a
chance to win but ended up losing close matches
against the Bruins.
"The UCLA match was one that easily could
have ended up 5-2 the other way," Wolters said. "I
had a set point in the second, Geoff [Abrams] had
one in the first, and Alex's [Kim] match was also a
close one. So, we shouldn't be too discouraged, we
should be excited to play them at home in a couple
of weeks."
Against the Bruins the Cardinal's doubles play
came back to hurt it once again. Wolters and fresh
man K.J. Hippensteel were defeated at the No. 1
spot. Abrams and Kim then won at No. 2 doubles,
so the point came down to sophomores Scotty Scott
and Ali Ansari in their No. 3 match. Ansari and
Scott, who have been struggling all year to find a
consistent level of play, had a 6-4 lead before losing
five out of the last six games to lose 9-7. That was big
not only for the point but also for momentum head
ing into the singles.
Despite his consecutive losses in doubles, how
ever, Ansari did a good job of coming back strong in
his singles.
In addition to Ansari, once
again freshman K.J. Hippensteel
continued to show his lack of ex
perience will not get in the way of
his play. Hippensteel is the 13th
ranked player in the nation and
played tremendous tennis all
weekend to handily win both of his
singles matches and improve his
dual match record to 13-1.
Friday lie beat UCLA's fresh
man Zack Fleisman, who came
into this year as the No. 2 junior
player in the nation. Then Satur
day Hippensteel turned around
and beat USC's Roman Kukal 6-2,
6-0. Kukal is a tough player and
had beaten Hippensteel earlier in
the year. Hippensteel dominated
Kukal right from the start and
never let up.
"I seem to gain a little more
confidence with each match," Hip
pensteel said. "I just want to be
come as comfortable out there as I
can by the time NCAAs arrive in
May."
In fact, the entire Cardinal
squad is aware that while these
Pac-1() matches are important, it
essentially comes down to how
ready the team is to play in May.
"'['his weekend was important
for us because we saw where we
stand and what we can work on as
the season approaches its end,"
Kim said.
"It was nice to see our guys can
come back strong after a setback
against UCLA. I think we know
we are as good as anyone right
now, we just need to keep getting
better in doubles and each work
on a few little things in our singles
play."
