## Card sweeps WSU in three-game series

An hour-long power outage. Wind gusts of up to 45
mph. A driving rainstorm that swept through during
the ninth inning.

■ Friday: No. 3 Stanford (23-8,9-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
6, Washington State (16-12,1-5) 5.

■ Saturday: Stanford 9, Washington State 0,

And that was just Saturday's game.
But amidst the apocalyptic chaos was the third
ranked Stanford baseball team (23-8) standing tall
and completing a sweep of Washington State to run its
Pacific 10 Conference record to 9-0. Not that the play
ers were oblivious to the elements.
"It was 'Twilight Zone' weather, I would say," said
senior third baseman Josh Hochgesang. "I don't know
what's going on. There was wind like a hurricane and
all of a sudden, the sun goes away and it starts raining.
It's really weird."
Saturday's 9-0 victory, which capped off Stanford's
best conference start in school history, had many he
roes. Hochgesang's two home runs led a late offensive
barrage that broke open a 1-0 game and gave him the
team lead in homers with eight. Sophomore designat
ed hitter Joe Borchard drove in two runs and had two
hits to extend his hitting streak to 11 games, the
longest by a Stanford player this season.
But perhaps the most remarkable performance
turned in was by freshman right-hander Brian Sager.
