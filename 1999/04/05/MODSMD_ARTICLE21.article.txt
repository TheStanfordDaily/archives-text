An hour-long power outage. Wind gusts of up to 45
mph. A driving rainstorm that swept through during
the ninth inning.

BASEBALL

■ Friday: No. 3 Stanford (23-8,9-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
6, Washington State (16-12,1-5) 5.

■ Saturday: Stanford 9, Washington State 0,

And that was just Saturday's game.
But amidst the apocalyptic chaos was the third
ranked Stanford baseball team (23-8) standing tall
and completing a sweep of Washington State to run its
Pacific 10 Conference record to 9-0. Not that the play
ers were oblivious to the elements.
"It was 'Twilight Zone' weather, I would say," said
senior third baseman Josh Hochgesang. "I don't know
what's going on. There was wind like a hurricane and
all of a sudden, the sun goes away and it starts raining.
It's really weird."
Saturday's 9-0 victory, which capped off Stanford's
best conference start in school history, had many he
roes. Hochgesang's two home runs led a late offensive
barrage that broke open a 1-0 game and gave him the
team lead in homers with eight. Sophomore designat
ed hitter Joe Borchard drove in two runs and had two
hits to extend his hitting streak to 11 games, the
longest by a Stanford player this season.
But perhaps the most remarkable performance
turned in was by freshman right-hander Brian Sager.

Freshman Brian Sager throws a pitch during Saturday's shutout victory over Washington State.
P itching
with an air
cast on his
right shin —

the leg he uses to push off the mound on his de
livery to the plate — Sager settled down after a
shaky first two innings to pitch a complete-game
three-hitter and run his record to 3-0.
From the wind-whipped start to the rain
swept end, Sager had full command of his off
speed pitches, especially his slider, and baffled
the Washington State (16-12, 1-5) batters to the
tune of 1 1 strikeouts, a career high. The right
hander did not give up a hit after the fourth in
ning and retired the final 13 batters he faced, six
by strikeout.
"I've had a little trouble with my right shin."
Sager said. "It was a stress reaction where the
muscle starts tearing away from the bone. But I
came out today and my leg felt great so I got a
good base under me. Also, my slider was a great
pitch for me against left-handed hitters. 1 hadn't
been doing too well with left-handed hitters, so
they tried to stack their lineup with lefties, but I
think I dealt with them pretty well."
Stanford was holding on to a 1-0 lead in the

third inning when Sunken Diamond was hit by
the campus-wide power outage. Because the
scoreboard was now staring blankly at the field,
people in the stands and press box had to rely on
the umpire for balls and strikes and the number
of outs in an inning.
With no power in the press box, KZSU
broadcaster Rebecca Roberts called a couple of
innings over the phone until she received an
emergency generator to power her equipment.
Meanwhile, public address announcer Will
Flemming was relegated to using a bullhorn in
the stands to announce the score and between
inning giveaways.
The power returned in the bottom of the sixth
inning and coincidentally, Stanford's bats came
to life. Hochgesang led off the inning with his
112 irst home run of the game, a blast that was car
ried even further by the wind that was whipping
out to left field. Two more runs scored in that in
ning on.a triple by sophomore center fielder
Billy Jacobson. In the seventh, Hochgesang
turned a curveball into his second wind-swept
blast to left field, a two-run job that made the
score 6-0.
"You can't keep a good man down, so I just

kept working hard," Hochgesang said. "Today, I
just got a hold of a couple and the wind helped
me a little, especially with the second one."
While Saturday's game had adverse elements
surrounding it, Friday's game had adversity that
was more immediate to the Cardinal as the
Cougars jumped out leads of 3-0 and 5-3. But
Stanford pushed across three runs in the bottom
of the seventh against three Washington State
pitchers to escape with the 6-5 victory. Sopho
more right-hander Austin Coose (3-0) picked up
the win in relief of starter Justin Wayne.
The Cardinal first tied the game in the sixth
inning on a titanic three-run blast to right field
by Borchard that went about 400 feet. The
clutch two-out home run was his second homer
in as many nights. After Washington State re
gained the lead in the next inning on a two-out
single off Coose, senior left-hander Tony Cogan
came on to pitch the final two innings for his
sixth save of the season.
Stanford returns to action tonight with a
game at San Jose State, which will serve as a
tune-up before the Cardinal takes its unbeaten
Pac-10 mark up to Washington next weekend
for a three-game series.
