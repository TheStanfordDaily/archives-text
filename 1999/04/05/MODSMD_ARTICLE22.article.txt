### Mo Eger Contributing writer 
Things didn't go as well as the
women's water polo team had
hoped this weekend. The No. 2
Cardinal (15-3, 8-1 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) lost to the
top-ranked USC Trojans (20-1, 8-
1) 5-3 on Saturday. It wasn't the
upset that the Cardinal had been
aiming for, and the teams both fin
ish the regular season with 8-1
records. Though the teams go into
next weekend's MPSF Tourna
ment with a tied record, USC will
remain the No. 1 seed bccause of
its victory against Stanford.

of its man-up advantages either.
" The game was disappointing,
but our defense was really good,"
said senior captain and goalie
Heather Crary. "USC's 6 on 5 is
their main thing, so it was great
that we shut those down. And we
did have plenty of 6 on ss. Our
problem was that we didn't execute
when we had to."
Even though the game was frus
trating, Stanford wasn't about to
give up. "Our shots kept hitting the
bar and weren't going but we never
stopped shooting, which is good."
Crary added. "But if we had scored
more in the beginning, 1 think our
momentum would have really got
going and we could have main-
