### Mo Eger Contributing writer 
Things didn't go as well as the
women's water polo team had
hoped this weekend. The No. 2
Cardinal (15-3, 8-1 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) lost to the
top-ranked USC Trojans (20-1, 8-
1) 5-3 on Saturday. It wasn't the
upset that the Cardinal had been
aiming for, and the teams both fin
ish the regular season with 8-1
records. Though the teams go into
next weekend's MPSF Tourna
ment with a tied record, USC will
remain the No. 1 seed bccause of
its victory against Stanford.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO

■ Saturday: No. I USC (20-1, 8-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
5, No. 2 Stanford (15-3,8-1) 3.

As expected, Saturday's match
was indeed physical and the Cardi
nal drew two four-meter penalty
shots and nine USC ejections. Un
fortunately, the Stanford team
failed to score on any of the nine 6-
on-5 advantages or the last four
meter penalty shot.

"We didn't score any of our
man-up opportunities and that was
huge factor in the outcome of the
game," said senior captain Lindsay
Tam. "We tried a lot of six-to-one
[cross-pool] passes, and though the
wind didn't help us any. our pass
ing wasn't there."
USC drew two four-meter
penalty shots as well as four Cardi
nal ejections. USC converted on
the penalties, but didn't score any
of its man-up advantages either.
" The game was disappointing,
but our defense was really good,"
said senior captain and goalie
Heather Crary. "USC's 6 on 5 is
their main thing, so it was great
that we shut those down. And we
did have plenty of 6 on ss. Our
problem was that we didn't execute
when we had to."
Even though the game was frus
trating, Stanford wasn't about to
give up. "Our shots kept hitting the
bar and weren't going but we never
stopped shooting, which is good."
Crary added. "But if we had scored
more in the beginning, 1 think our
momentum would have really got
going and we could have main-

tained our lead."
Stanford sophomore Anne-
Marie Keenan scored the first goal
of the game on a counterattack set
up by Crary. USC's Selah Mapes
tied the score before the end of the
first quarter.
Stanford's second and last lead
of the game came when freshman
Margie Dingeldein scored an in
credible high-corner shot from the
perimeter early in the second quar
ter. Dingeldein leads the Cardinal
team in scoring, this goal her 24th
of the season.
Trojan Nina Wengst scored
IJSC "s second goal on a counterat
tack and Aniko Pelle, USC's top
scoring player, drew a four-meter
penalty shot against the Cardinal.

She scored the shot and gave USC
its first lead of the game.
Going into the second half
ahead, USC's Wengst and Pelle
both scored two more goals in the
third quarter. The Cardinal failed
to improve its own score until the
last quarter when sophomore Dani
Bell scored a four-meter penalty
shot. The Cardinal drew another
penalty-shot with just over a
minute remaining in the game hut
failed to convert the opportunity
into a goal.
The Cardinal was 0 for 9 on 6-
on-5 advantages and 1 for 2 on
four-meter shots. Clearly Stan
ford's offense was working in terms
of creating the scoring opportuni
ties by drawing the kickouts. It was
the second half of the equation that
Stanford could not carry out and
this will be the area it must improve
upon before this weekend's MPSF

Tournament at UCLA.
USC did not score any of its lour
6-on-5 advantages either, demon
strating the Cardinal's excellent de
fense. Three-time Ail-American
Crary had an outstanding game
with nine saves.
Crary was pleased with the
team's defense as well as her own
and felt that she had improved
upon certain aspects of her game
since the last time these two teams
had played in February.
"The last time we played USC
they took a lot of skip shots. I've
been working on those in practice
and blocked their attempts this
game," said Crary.
Even with this loss, the Cardinal
is optimistic the MFSF Tourna
ment next weekend in Los Angeles
and the possibility of meeting USC
in the finals. Stanford will be the
No. 2 seed.
