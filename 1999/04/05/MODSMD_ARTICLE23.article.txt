single of her own to bring home
Wiginton and Schneider for the

outfielder Pauline Duenas singled

scored Duenas, but it wasn't until
designated hitter Holly Yost hit to an
open gap in center field that the
Bears took the lead 4-2.
Stanford would also respond.
Sophomore Jenni Shideler hit a solo
home run in the filth to close the gap
at 4-3. With two outs in the bottom of
the seventh and two Cardinal players

deep line drive to right field. Which
was cut at the fence by Duenas to end
the game.
The next Pac-1() conference
games for the Cardinal come April
10-11 when No. 12 Oregon State and
No. 13 Oregon visit for a double
header apiece.
"We really want to take four next
weekend because we need to to start
getting the Pac-1() wins," Beeson
said. "If we keep playing well, we
should be able to do that."
First up, though, Stanford travels
to Sacramento State tomorrow.
