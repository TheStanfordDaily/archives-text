# Tennis cruises to two home wins
## Women sweep games 
### 
The fifth-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team overwhelmed
both No. 6 UCLA and No. 10 USC
this weekend to bring its dual match
record to 17-2 overall and 6-1 in the
Pacific-10 Conference.
Against the Bruins (14-4.2-2 Pac
-10) on Friday, the Cardinal brought
its best game to the court, clinching
the match by taking five of six singles
victories.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Friday: No. 5 Stanford (17-2, 6-1
Pacific 10 Conference) 7, No. 6
UCLA (14-5,2-3)1.

■ Saturday: Stanford 5, No. 10 USC
(14-7)1.

Junior captain Teryn Ashley was
the lone loser, succumbing to Aman
da Basica, 6-3,6-3.
"It was just one of the fluke days,"
Ashley said, adding that the develop
ing tendinitis in her knee is "pretty
much better."
The star of the day was freshman

Lauren Kalvaria, who battled
through three thrilling sets to con
quer UCLA's Brandi Freudenberg
and secure the victory for the Cardi
nal.
After a rough start to the season
due to injuries and a lack of confi
dence. Kalvaria has rebounded in re
cent weeks and posted several im
pressive victories. Kalvaria's new
found confidence is exemplified by
her ability to cut down the number of
double-faults she serves in a match, a
problem that has plagued her in the
past.
"I definitely feel more confident
before 1 step on the court,'" Kalvaria
said after her 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 win. "The
serve is not a problem, and a tough
match like this makes me feel really
good about how I'm playing."
While Friday's victory over the
Bruins was exciting, Saturday's dual
match against USC (14-7) was more
dramatic as the women were forced
to play through a windstorm. The
swirling wind wreaked havoc on ser
vice tosses and tested all players'
mental games. Often during a point,
a player had to make an abrupt last
minute technique adjustment in
order to simply make contact with
the ball.
"The wind was just ridiculous
today," said Ashley, who powered
through her match against Trojan
Wkara Warkentin, 6-3, 6-2. "The
wind just neutralizes all your shots.
My game plan was to have a high
first-serve percentage and play
down the middle."
Junior Jennifer Heiser, who
stopped USC's Veronica Safarova,
6-4, 6-3, also expressed frustration
with the wind.
"Everyone knows it's frustrat
ing." she said, "but you can't get
frustrated before your opponent
does. 1 knew she had to deal with
just as much wind as I did. Some
breaks go your way, some go her
way. I just focused on getting the
ball in play."
Like Friday's match, the Stanford
women again took five of six singles
matches to secure the victory. Dou
bles was canceled because of the
windy conditions.
Normally, such a victory would
seem a mundane win, but the singles
loss was suffered by the nation's sec
ond-ranked player and freshman
star Marissa Irvin.
Her conqueror was hard-hitting
Ditta Huber, ranked 19th in the na
tion. Both players' games were ham
pered by the wind. Nonetheless, the
third set featured dramatic rallies
and stunning winners by both play
ers.
Irvin, known for her power, was
herself often overpowered by
Huber's Hat and accurate forehand.
The match, however, couldn't have
been closer. On match point,
Huber's forehand passing shot
slapped the netcord and leapt over
Irvin's racket.
Huber was ecstatic after her 7-5,
4-6, 6-4 win, while Irvin was not
pleased that her 23-match winning
streak was snapped. But head coach
Frank Brennan was not overly dis
appointed by the loss.
"I try to be philosophical about
it,"he said. "Maybe it takes a little
pressure off of Irvin going into the
rest of the season"
"I'm very happy with the wins,"
Brennan said.

Freshman Marissa Irvin returns a backhand in this weekend's competition. Although only a freshman, Irvin has distinguished herself as one
of the strongest players in the NCAA.
