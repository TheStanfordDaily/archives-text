The 15th-ranked Stanford men's
volleyball team (9-9, 7-9 Mountain

the Cardinal is trying to reestablish it
self within the MPSF in its last match
es to realize its post-season playoff
ambitions.

■ Sunday: No. 15 Stanford (9-9, 7-9
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) def. UC-San Diego (4-19, 0-
16) 15-7,15-3,15-5.

A win in yesterday's match
against the UC-San Diego Tritons
(4-19,0-16) was the only possible out
come to keep these chances alive.
The Cardinal, however, did more
than just rebound from its devastat
ing five-game loss to Pacific last
week. Stanford outperformed, out
shone and outplayed the Tritons in
every possible area. Stanford at
tained its most decisive victory of the
season in just over one hour.
The Cardinal cruised to a 15-7,15-
3,15-5 victory over San Diego, which
has yet to earn a conference win in 16
MPSF matches. Although UC-San
Diego held short leads in games one
and three, the Tritons were never
able to string together enough points
to threaten the Cardinal. Stanford's
dominance was evident in its 11-
point run at the start of game two.
This overwhelming victory indi
cates an improvement in the Cardi
nal's play and composure from the
last time these two teams met over
Spring Break, which was a closer,
four-game Cardinal win.
"Everyone was a little unsure of
ourselves the last time we played,"
said sophomore middle blocker
Brett Youngberg. "We hadn't played
in the new rotation for that long. We
lost the first game, but once we got
into the rotation, we won the next

three games. [Yesterday] our game
improved and 1 don't think that the
Tritons were playing as well as they
could have."
Although the Tritons might not
have been playing at their optimum
level, the Cardinal, with postseason
playoff opportunities on the line, did
not downplay the significance of this
game.
Stanford sophomore middle
blocker Dan Zhang executed one of
his best career performances. Zhang
recorded a perfect hitting percent
age, tallying nine kills.
"Offensively, I couldn't ask for
anything more from Dan," said Stan
ford head coach Ruben Nieves. "I
thought it was one of his greatest
matches."
Senior outside hitter Patrick
Klein and freshman outside hitter
Marcus Skacel also contributed to
the Cardinal's attacking game. Klein
led all players on the court with 13
kills. Skacel recorded eight kills in the
win.
"We executed pretty well,"
Nieves said. "UCSD is the type of op
ponent that is going to give us the op
portunity to score points. But we still
need to convert and make the most of
these opportunities. We did a good
job of that on the court today."
Although the Cardinal attackers
did not seem to have any problems
racking up points, San Diego record
ed an ineffective .024 team hitting
percentage and only scored 15 points
the entire match. Stanford consis
tently served to the backbone of the
San Diego offense, sophomores
Donald Chen and Raffi Mitilian, and
prevented them from being offensive
threats. Both members of the Tri
tons' traditional scoring tandem
recorded .negative hitting percent
ages in the loss.
Even when not serving to these
players, Stanford was still able to
score effectively. The Cardinal
recorded five aces, two of which were
served by junior outside hitter Josh
Palacios.
