What role does education plav in Asia's cultural her
itage? Over the next two weeks, the Stanford communi
ty can gain insight at EAST House.
Residents of the house, the East Asian Studies acade
mic theme residence, will launch their annual EAS T Fest
speaker series today with a focus on schooling.
Scholars from Stanford and other prestigious institu
tions will lecture on topics such as Confucian and Daoist
approaches to education and girls' and women's educa
tion in India.
The series will present a "wide spectrum of speakers
concerning cultural issues from ancient to modern and
from musical to martial," said senior Kelly Price, an acad
emic theme associate at EAST House.
This year's festival theme promises to engage a wide
range of students. "Education creates cultural differences
between the East and the West." explained Price.
According to Ari Borrell, EAST resident fellow, the

series will explore "different aspects and issues in educa
tion in modern and pre-modern Asia."
Education. Borrell added, is "central to Asian civiliza
tion and culture" and provides "a deeper understanding
of culture as a whole."
Asst. History Prof. Ellen Neskar. also an EAS I resi
dent fellow, explained that the series selects "topics that
students could relate to" and tries "to introduce people to
subjects and approaches that they couldn't take in class.
It gives a "different window on Asian culture," she added.
Eventually, the program will culminate in a perfor
mance night at Cubberley Auditorium. Over the course
of that evening, participants will have the chance to taste
Asian cuisine and enjoy cultural performances, including
the Stanford Taiko, Beijing opera. Japanese traditional
music, Korean drumming and martial arts.
EAST Fest gets "every single member of the dorm in
volved." Neskar said. During the year, Neskar's upper
class residents explore the cultural, political, economic,
and historical aspects of Asian cultures with a focus on
Korea, Japan, and China.
"People are enthusiastic. Some come with no back
ground in Asia" Price explained.
EAST House and EAST Fest "provide students with
opportunities to explore the Asian culture," Borrell
added.
