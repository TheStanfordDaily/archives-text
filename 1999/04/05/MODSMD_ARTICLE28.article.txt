## Stanford to end techie programs

In a startling turn of events, Stanford has decided to end all techie classes at the
University. Citing the need to "control nerds on campus," University President Gerhard
( asper and Those Who Hold The Real Power At This University have decided to terminate
the Departments of Computer Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and all engineering
departments as well as any department that involves numbers.
Administrators, especially those involved in the application screening process, sounded
alarms of pure excitement. Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya and his pro
tege Robert Kinnally argued that ridding Stanford of techies would keep the University on
top of the academic world well into the 21st century. Kinnally told The Daily, "Computers
are a joke. In the 21st century, only the cool people will survive. That's why the Admissions
Office has adopted a new policy. We will be automatically admitting all prospective male
students who (a) had sex by the age of 15 or (b) were shaving before the fifth grade.
Women will be admitted purely on the basis of (a) breast size or (b) how many marshmal
lows they can hold in their mouth and while clearly enunciating the words "chubby bunny."
A prominent human sexuality professor reminisced, "In terms of the penis, the compar
ison of the 'techie' and the 'fuzzy' was most comparable to that of the Reebok Pump and
the gerbil. I know that this seems strange, but which would you rather shove up...
An Art History Prof, interrupted with his thoughts. "In terms of film history, some argue
that Scarlett O'Hara was a techie and Rhett Butler a fuzzy, but I always believed that the
debate was first hallucinated — excuse me — elucidated with Orson Wells' masterpiece
'Citizen Cocaine' — I mean Kane (nervous giggle). But the debate was never fully broached
until 'Pot Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (girlish laughter). I'm sorry, that would be 'One
Flew Over the Crack Whore's Breast.' (long pause, some tears) I don't do drugs. Really, I
don't, (in a breathy whisper) Do you have any crack?"
The Daily looked for many techies to gage their reactions, but none were found. It seems
that the techies, who represented only a small majority of students on campus, high-tailed
it out of here when they learned that their departments were terminated. Gone are the
computer geeks in Sweet Hall. Gone are the lab rat dorks from the Mudd Chemistry
Building. Gone are the pre-meds with their bumpers stickers that read "I Bent Over for P-
Chem."
Techies — like the annoying little brother that all of us wanted to kill and one or two of
us actually did without our parents or the police actually figuring it out, or that disgusting
case of chigger bugs — you will be missed.
