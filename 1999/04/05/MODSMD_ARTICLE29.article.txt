# TECHIES ANONYMOUS

Listen up techies: have we got a cure for
you. As proud, unabashed fuzzies, we real
ize that not everyone can be as socially
savvy as us. Therefore, we have dedicated
this week's column to aiding the poor,
unfortunate science, math and engineer
ing majors at Stanford who aresocially
retarded, foul-smelling and all-around
pathetic. After intense research and con
sultation with the local San Jose chapter of
Alcoholics' Anonymous (it's big!), we pre
sent to you hope for a better life. Ladies
and gentlemen of the computer, here are
your 12 steps:
ONE
We admitted we were powerless over the
computer — that our lives have become
unmanageable.
TWO
We came to believe that a Power greater
than ourselves could restore us to sanity
and maybe even help us get laid.

THREE
We decided to brush our
teeth, comb our hair,
change our clothes, take
showers daily, clip our toe
nails, change our under
wear and maybe even shave
once in a while.
FOUR
We made a searching and
fearless inventory of our
selves and discovered that
our refrigerators were poor
ly stocked. We decided to

■/ — —
visit Ernie's Liquor to pick up the
necessary supplies to lighten up.

FIVE
We admitted to God, to ourselves and to
another human being the exact nature of
our wrongs. We would no longer spank
our monkeys while our roommates were
in our rooms. Our bookmarked Internet
porn sites were a thing of the past. The ani
mals were finally safe from our tempta
tions.
SIX
Six is for Sex. Without our computers.
SEVEN
We humbly asked God to remove our
shortcomings. We got penile enlargement
surgeries and were finally ready to pick up
our 10 free condoms at Cowell. Don't
worry, there are instructions on the back.
EIGHT
We made a list of all the persons we had
harmed and became willing to make
amends to them all. In fact, we even decid
ed to talk to people.

NINE
We used a typewriter without using spell
check and hand-wrote a letter to friends.
Or acquaintances, in our case. Family will
do in dire situations.
TEN
We decided that we wanted to become ele-

mentary school teachers.
ELEVEN
We prayed to stop the shivers
and shakings of withdrawal.
We knew that evil box called
a computer was a thing of the
past. We wiped away the tears
because our kindergarteners
were calling after us for
band-aids.

TWELVE
Having had spiritual awaken-

ings as a result of these steps, we tried to
carry this message to other techies and to
practice these principles in all our affairs.
Hallelujah! Free at last!
