# Electricity shuts down
## Campus loses power; weather, wind to blame 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
A majority of the campus lost
electrical power for several hours
Saturday afternoon during a sudden
spate of wacky weather that included
55 mph winds and a brief hailstorm.
According to Pacific Gas & Elec
tric spokesman Jonathan Franks, the
power outage was related to a mo
mentary break in PCi&E's Menlo
substation which caused an interrup
tion in the power supply for the LJni
versity-operated Stanford substa
tion.
"In essence, Stanford's substation
and the equipment there should have
reacted to it by noting the momen
tary outage and turning itself off and
back on again," Franks said. In that
case, he said, the power on campus
would only have been out for a few
seconds.
Stanford officials in charge of the
substation were not available for
comment. The University generates
much of its own power at the Cardi
nal Cogen power plant on campus,
but is not immune to external power
problems.
The outage affected almost every
one on campus, as lights, cordless
phones and computers remained off
for much of the afternoon.
Students in dorm rooms watched
helplessly as their computers sudden

ly shut down, causing some to lose
materials they had been working on
at the time.
Senior Jaime Chapman was
preparing a graduate school applica
tion on her computer.
"I had to submit two essays, and I
was revising the second when the
power went out. That essay had been
entirely erased, and I had to rewrite it
and rush to Fed Exit that night,"
Chapman said.
The power outage affected Stan
ford athletic events as well.
The baseball team was playing a
game against Washington State at
Sunken Diamond when the power
went out in the third inning, forcing
teams and fans to watch the umpire
for the count on pitches.
A student broadcasting the game
on KZSU radio used a telephone for
several innings, while the public ad
dress announcer took to a bullhorn to
declare the score.
Softball and lacrosse games and a
tennis match were also occurring on
campus during the outage, which
forced these events to continue with
out functioning scoreboards as well.
According to the National
Weather Service, the stormy weather
was caused by a fairly normal spring
storm system that usually tracks to
the north and east of the Bay Area,
dumping snow on the Sierras.
However, this time, the cold,
stormy weather from the back end of
the system hit the Bay Area, causing
gale-force wind gusts throughout the
region, as well as scattered reports of
hail and snow flurries.

According to Franks, the winds in
the storm were especially problemat
ic for P( i&E because of their direc
tion.
"It was a north wind, which is out
of the ordinary, and when you have a
heavy wind coming from a direction
out of the norm, a lot of branches and

trees that aren't normally exposed to
the wind can get knocked down,"
Franks said.
Franks reported that about XB,(HX)
customers throughout the PG&E
service area lost power from the
storm on Saturday, with about I.\(XM)
of those in the Hav Area.
