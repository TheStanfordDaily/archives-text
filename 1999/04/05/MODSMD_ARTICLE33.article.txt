# Women's lacrosse team avenges earlier loss to Cal
## 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
When it was said. "Do unto others
as you would have others do unto
you," the California women's
lacrosse team should have been lis
tening.
In Stanford's first encounter with
California (6-6, 3-2 Western
Women's Lacrosse League) this sea

son, Stanford (7-4,4-1) lost 10-9 in the
last 40 seconds, so on Saturday the
Cardinal decided to show the Bears
what losing feels like by notching an
11-10 victory with 40 seconds to go.
Except this time, to make it that much
more exciting, the Cardinal waited
until sudden-death double-overtime
to pull off the win.
The Stanford fans certainly got
what they came for — a rollercoaster

of a game — as the score seemed to
be in constant fluctuation. In the first
half, Stanford was up 4-2, but it trailed
7-5 by halftime as Cal scored four
goals in two minutes. The Cardinal
was able to muster a comeback and
battle Cal to a 9-9 tie as the game
clock ran out. In the first three minute
overtime, Cal scored and when the
three minutes were up, the game was
over — or was it?

In women's lacrosse, the first over
time consists of two three-minute
halves.
The disappointed Stanford fans
got up, hut as they began to file out of
the stands, the second half of the
overtime period went on. Relieved
fans resumed their seats just in time to
see senior co-captain Alexis Pa
trizio's goal again tie the game, this
time sending it into sudden-death
overtime.
The first three-minute sudden
death overtime was scoreless; it
wasn't until the second three-minute
sudden-death period that sophomore
Katharine Barnes chipped in her
heroic goal.
"We're ecstatic," said head coach
Heidi Connor. " This is a big win in
more ways than one, mostly because
it plays largely into our place in the
playoffs. Now hopefully we'll be the
No. 1 seed and that is the place to
be."
Cal was the only team in the
Women's Western Lacrosse League

that beat Stanford in the first half of
the season, so with its win, Stanford
has put itself in a good position to
clinch the top spot in the tournament.
"We fought a good mental battle
and didn't let Cal get the best of us
mentally or physically, which in the
past has been a problem when we
played Cal," Patrizio said. "Our
bench stepped up when we needed
them to, every player stepped up and
gave it everything they had."

Connor agreed, praising the team
as a whole.
"Certain people stuck out," said
Connor, citing Barnes' game winning
goal, junior Hedy Bom's goal that
launched them into overtime and the
incredible play of Patrizio. "But
everyone gave 110 percent. You
don't win unless you play as a team."

Goals for Stanford went to
Barnes. Born, freshmen Sara Lev and
Caroline Osterwise (two each), and
Patrizio, sophomore Kate Reilley
and freshman Liz Britt (one each).
Much of the team, however, felt
the win was bittersweet.
"I'm glad we pulled it off," said
Barnes. "But I am disappointed be
cause we are a much stronger team
than Cal. We performed better on the
East Coast and we should have had a
more satisfying win."
Patrizio agreed.
"In the first half we weren't really
playing our game, and it took us a
while to get into any sort of rhythm.
Cal was outhustling us, and we
looked nervous and jittery," she said.
"I don't think this game was exem
plary of all we are capable of. Howev
er. at the beginning of the season we
might have let a game like this slip
through our fingers, and time and ex
perience has shown us how to see it
through to the end, and to win the
game."
