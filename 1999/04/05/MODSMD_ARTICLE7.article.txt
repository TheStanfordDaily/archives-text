# Law prevents satellite launch
## Defense bill restricts help from Russia 
### Mills Schenck 
In the Durand building, home to
the Stanford Department of Aero
nautics and Astronautics, sits a
two-foot wide, 40-pound hexago
nal satellite built by Stanford grad
uate students at a cost of $50,000.
Thanks to recent federal legisla
tion, it is not going to space soon.
A satellite named SAPPHIRE,
part of the small satellite develop
ment project at Stanford's Space
Systems Development Laboratory,
is grounded due to the provisions
of President Clinton's 1999 defense
bill.
The bill prohibits SAPPHIRE,
which stands for Stanford Audio

Phonic Photographic Infra Red
Experiment, from accepting an
offer for a free launch and technical
help from the Moscow Bauman
State Technical University in Rus
sia.
Since the bill classifies such
equipment as "munitions," SAP
PHIRE will join a fleet of almost
one hundred satellites effectively
grounded by the government.
First of several SQUIRT
Satellite Quick Research Testbed
projects at Stanford, SAP
PI II RE will offer students a unique
educational experience.
Robert Twiggs, director of the
Space Systems Development Lab,
said these projects are "training
students by giving them the oppor
tunity to go through the entire life
cycle of a satellite from its initial
design to the end of its use."
SAPPHIRE has three "pay
loads," or objectives. It would
transmit images to Earth with a dig
ital black and white camera, use a

voice synthesizer to transmit mes
sages through the satellite and test
a kind of infra-red sensor that has
never before been used in space.
Unfortunately, the satellite's
launch troubles are now a serious
problem for the 10-member SAP
PHIRE team that will be unable to
complete its lab experience.
Michael Swartwout, a graduate
student member of the SAP
PHIRE team, told the Palo Alto
Daily News, "At some point I got
kind of resigned to this and realized
that I better focus on finishing my
degree instead of the launch."
Defense policies changed in re
sponse to the discovery of a 19%
Chinese rocket that was carrying a
satellite built by Loral Space and
Communications of Palo Alto.
Investigators said that a report
on the rocket's crash by U.S. satel
lite industry officials may have con
tained information about guidance
systems that could benefit China's
long-range missile program.

In response, this year's defense
bill placed increased scrutiny on
the exports of satellite technology,
transferring responsibility for
satellite exports to the State De
partment from the Commerce De
partment.
For now, the SAPPHIRE re
mains in its home in the Durand
building, and designers have
turned to the Internet for publicity.
Their launch options humorously
include building their own rocket
and holding a bake sale to get fund
ing.
The nest SQUIRT project, ti
tled "OPAL" for Orbital Picosatel
lite Automated Launcher, is sched
uled to launch on a U.S. military
rocket in September.
Although the SAPPHIRE re
mains grounded, Twiggs is hopelul.
"We are still looking for a place to
launch," he said. "If we had
$50(),()()()to$2 million, I'm sure that
we could launch within six
months."
