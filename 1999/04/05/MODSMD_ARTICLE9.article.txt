## Alleged bombers will face trial under Scottish law Bombing suspects handed over 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) —Arab
dignitaries headed to Libya yester
day to witness the handover of two
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bomb
ing, a further sign their promised
extradition is on track.
A delegation led by Ahmed Ben
Heli, the Arab League's assistant
secretary-general, flew yesterday to
Tunisia, where delegation members
were then driven to the Libyan cap
ital, Tripoli.
Representatives from six Arab
countries also were to attend the
handover, Ben Heli said.
'it is good news for the
Libyans — indeed, for all Arabs —
that this quandary is finally over,"
Ben Heli told The Associated Press
before leaving Cairo, site of the
League's headquarters.
The move followed reports that
the chief U.N. legal counsel, Hans
Corell, had left for Europe on Fri
day on his way to Libya to arrange
the handover. The suspects, Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi, are to be tried under

Scottish law in the Netherlands.
The Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of
the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people — most
ly Americans and Britons — on the
air and the ground. The two
Libyans, allegedly former intelli
gence agents, were suspected of
planting a suitcase bomb on the
plane.
Ben Heli said he would represent
the League's secretary-general.
Esmat Abdel-Meguid, who could
not make the trip because of other
commitments.
The Algerian diplomat said the
Libyan government also has invited
foreign ministers of six Arab coun
tries that formed a contact group set
up by the League in 1992 to help
negotiate an end to the crisis with
the United States and Britain.
Mohammed Zaki Abu Amer, an
Egyptian foreign minister's envoy,
left with Ben Heli to represent
Egypt. Other countries expected to
send high-ranking officials were
Syria, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria

and Mauritania.
Arab diplomats in Cairo said
Libya also has asked South Africa
and the Organization of African
Unity to send representatives.
After a decade of insistence that
Fhimah. 42, and al-Megrahi. 46, be
extradited to the United States or
Britain for trial, the United States
agreed in August to a trial in the
Netherlands. Libya said last month
it would turn the men over on or
before tomorrow.
Terms of the deal call for the
U.N. Security Council to suspend
sanctions imposed in 1992, including
an air embargo, as soon as the sus
pects arrive in the Netherlands.
Arab diplomats said Saturday
that Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi has ordered the passports
of the two suspects returned to
them.
In Libya, secrecy has surrounded
the operation and officials contacted
by telephone have refused to
divulge details about the much
anticipated handover.
