# Grad students to get raise, more housing units
## 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
New measures designed to alle
viate the housing crisis facing grad
uate students were announced by
Provost Condoleezza Rice at last
Thursday's Faculty Senate meet
ing.
The plans include a 7 percent in
crease in the minimum graduate
student salary. This will hopefully
allow students to cope with skyrock
eting costs of living that greatly ex
ceed the national inflation rate. The
salary increase will take effect this
September. This raise follows an 8
percent increase in 1998. The cost to
University general funds, according
to Rice, will be about $2.3 million.
The raise will apply only to Uni
versity teaching assistants and re
search assistants receiving mini
mum salaries. Graduate students
with grants, fellowships and salaries
above the minimum will not be af
fected.
The University's plan will also
produce another 250 units of subsi
dized off-campus housing by rent
ing local units and re-renting them
to graduate students below market
value. These 250 units will be added
to the 250 already rented last sum
mer, bringing the total number of
subsidized off-campus housing
units to 500. This part of the plan
will allow Stanford to house 3,900
graduate students, or 51 percent of
the graduate student population, by
this September at a cost of $4.5 mil
lion.
The University is also scouting
sites for new graduate student hous
ing at Moffett Field, Rice said, and
will begin construction this sum

mer.
In addition, the University plans
to produce 4(SO new spaces in Es
condido Village, an area already
thick with graduate students. Half
of these spaces, if all goes according
to plan, will he available by the fall
of 2(XX). the other half by early 2001.
Graduate Student Council mem
ber Harris Shapiro, a doctoral stu
dent in physics, said that while the
changes do not completely alleviate
the problems facing graduate stu
dents. the measures "send a strong
message to the graduate population
that the University is willing to de
vote serious resources towards fix
ing a very serious problem."
"We are very encouraged by
these decisions. While they do not
solve the housing crisis, they
demonstrate the University's con
tinuing commitment to addressing
this problem seriously in the long
term," said Graduate Student
Council member Robert Rudnit
skv, a doctoral candidate in applied
physics.
Rice indicated that additional
actions might be taken after the
May housing lottery if there is still
an unmet demand for graduate stu
dent housing.
"Despite the fact that this is ob
viously an expensive program for
the University, I think that we all
feel that it is money well spent, be
cause it's very important to us to
continue to recruit and matriculate
the best graduate students," Rice
said at the Faculty Senate meeting.
Rudnitsky said the University,
particularly Rice and University
President Gerhard Casper "de


Maggie Wetdner â€” Daily
serve enormous credit for addressing
the graduate housing problem ag
gressively." He said the administra
tion worked closely with graduate
student representatives to find ways
to address the housing crisis.
Associate Dean of Graduate Pol
icy Thomas Wasow, not present at
Thursday's meeting, seconded
Rice's comment. "Stanford's gradu
ate programs have to compete with
some of the best in the world, and our
lack of housing could put us at a com
petitive disadvantage and become a
serious impediment to attracting and
admitting the brightest students," he
said. " This is our principal motiva
tion in making these changes."

These changes are the result of
what Wasow called a "dramatic in
crease in off-campus housing prices,
coupled with a dramatic decrease in
availability."
This situation reached "crisis pro
portions" last year when numerous
student demonstrations erupted, in
cluding a group of graduate students
spending a night in the Quad.
These most recent changes are
the last in a series which began last
year with the reconfiguration of al
ready existing on-campus housing,
including converting single occupan
cy rooms into double occupancy
rooms. According to Wasow. these
changes were "not entirely popular."
Since then. Wasow said, the Uni
versity administration has been
scrambling at "top speed" trying to
plan, finance and build new housing.
