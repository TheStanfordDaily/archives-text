## Kosovars prepare for a fight 
### 
KRUMA. Albania (AP) — As
the rebel captain sipped his break
fast brandy, a constant stream of
young men came to his table to
pledge their services to the Koso
vo Liberation Army.
Most of the new volunteers —
the majority barely out of their
teens — were full of zeal but short
on military experience.
The scene clearly shows the
potential imbalance as the ethnic
Albanian separatists try to
regroup and expand. There is little
doubt they have the deep support
of the people being terrorized and
expelled by Yugoslav force. Rut
there are questions about their
ability to seriously challenge the
better-equipped and better
trained Serbs.
"It will be a long war. We
always knew that," said the cap
tain, who refused to give his name
in accordance with KLA policy.
"Rut we will win. Throughout his
tory, it has been shown that you
cannot defeat an entire, united
people."
Rut modern conflict also

requires expensive military mus
cle. KLA leaders refuse to give
details about the extent of their
arsenal or the number of their
fighters. Light arms and some
grenade launchers have been seen
passing through Kruma, a key
staging ground for the KLA in the
razor-edged mountains of north
ern Albania.
Much more serious weapons
would be needed to match the
tanks, cannons and warplanes of
the Yugoslav armed forces, many
military analysts say. In nearly a
year of conflict, the KLA never
managed to control a large part of
strategic territory in Kosovo.
So far. ethnic Albanian emigres
have been the main backers of the
KLA. providing money and arms.
Now the KLA fighters are hoping
for a much bigger benefactor: The
United States and its NATO
allies.
"We certainly want support
from the Americans," said the
captain, who said he served four
years in the Yugoslav army. "Rut
if we don't get it. we will still fight

alone."
Important battles could be
coming soon that could offer signs
to the KLA's resilience and the
level of possible U.S.-led military
backing.
NATO spokesman Rritish Air
Commodore David Wilby said
Sunday there are indications Serb
forces are moving toward remain
ing KLA strongholds in south
western Kosovo near the Albani
an border.
The Serbs could also be head
ing directly into the face of a
mounting U.S. military presence
in Albania.
A force including 24 Apache
attack helicopters and 2,000
troops is being prepared to "tight
en the noose around" Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic,
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Racon said Sunday. It could take a
week to 10 days to dispatch the
helicopters if NATO leaders
approve the request.
Meanwhile, the KLA is order
ing all ethnic Albanian men from
Kosovo to arms.
