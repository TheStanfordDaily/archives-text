# NATO airstrikes persist
## Kosovar Albanians to be airlifted out of Balkans 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — NA TO missiles
and aircraft blasted Serbian targets inside Yugoslavia
for a 13th straight day while the allies readied an airlift
for about 1(X),(XK) ethnic Albanian refugees inside
Kosovo.
Serb targets reportedly struck yesterday as the
weather cleared over Yugoslavia included roads,
bridges, fuel depots, an air force structure, army bar
racks and a TV relay tower. Serbian TV showed build
ings in flames.
Amid a new wave of NATO airstrikes late Sunday
and early yesterday in Belgrade, Pristina and other
Yugoslav cities, the United States signaled an escala
tion of firepower to halt Serb attacks on Kosovo's
Albanian majority.
Washington agreed to send 24 attack helicopters,
2,(HX) troops and a missile launching system to Albania
to give NATO the ability to directly attack Serb troops
and tanks in Kosovo, a southern province of Serbia that
has been under siege from Yugoslav forces for 13
months.
NATO leaders, who met yesterday, must approve
use of the weapons.
Deploying Apaches helicopters and support troops
in Albania would mark a substantial escalation of the
NATO campaign to try to force Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to agree to a U.S.-backed peace
deal and an autonomy pact with the Kosovo Albanians.
The low-flying helicopters would operate in hostile
territory, with accompanying troops deployed close to
the conflict.
The refugee crisis, meanwhile, was swelling to epic
proportions.
The IJ.N. refugee agency estimated that more than
350,000 ethnic Albanians have poured into neighboring
states from Kosovo so far, bringing stories of terror and
forced expulsions at the hands of Serbian troops and
allied paramilitary forces.
The human tide has overwhelmed Albania, Mace
donia and Montenegro.
As of today, 226,(XX) refugees had arrived in Alba
nia, 120,(XX) in Macedonia and 35,000 in Montenegro,
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
NATO on Sunday announced plans by most of its
member states to temporarily take in tens of thousands
of refugees to ease the pressure on Yugoslavia's neigh
bors.
Germany was to take the largest share - 40,(XX), and
the United States agreed to take 20,(XX).
Airlifts were to begin yesterday, but chaos was caus
ing delays.
In one small illustration of the massive challenge,
the United Nations reported one crossing point into
Macedonia, Jazince, having a single registration table
to process an influx of thousands.
NATO agreed to use its nearly 12,(XX) troops now
deployed in Macedonia to assist in the humanitarian
effort.
Those troops originally were to implement an elu

sive Kosovo peace agreement between ethnic Albani
ans and the Yugoslav government.
Prime Minister Tony Blair renewed his pledge that
Britain would not send troops in to fight a ground war.
"There is no question of NATO ground forces being
sent in unless it is to police an agreed political settle
ment," Blair wrote in today's edition of The Sun,
Britain's largest selling daily tabloid.
In Belgrade, air raid sirens sounded Sunday night to
signal the onset of airstrikes.
The independent Beta news agency reported a pow
erful explosion in the Belgrade area around midnight.
More than 20 explosions during a half-hour span were
heard around Pristina, where NATO planes later tar
geted an oil depot, it said.
Six missiles targeted the Slatina airport just west of
Pristina, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
NATO planes hit two suburbs of the capital —
Rakovica to the south and Surcin to the northwest —
the Belgrade crisis center said.
A stone quarry was targeted in a populated area of
Rakovica, while a missile struck near Belgrade's airport
near Surcin, causing minor damage to the main termi
nal, Tanjug reported.
Three powerful explosions early yesterday also
rocked Zemun, a northwestern district of the capital.
Studio B radio said one of the targets was an air force
command building.
Near the town of Kragujevac, 40 miles south of Bel
grade, a huge fire was blazing after a fuel depot was hit,
Tanjug said.
One missile hit a bridge on the Ibar River, and a TV
relay tower was also targeted, state media said. Both
ends of a railway tunnel in the Ibar River valley were
also targeted, effectively cutting the line.
Four explosions were heard yesterday in the greater
Nis area, 125 miles south of Belgrade, Beta reported,
three of which hit the command building of the
Yugoslav Third Army.
Another of the targets was later identified as a mili
tary barracks in the center of the city, Politika TV
reported.
Earlier, state-run media said NATO planes targeted
an army barracks in the town of Raska. about 1(X) miles
south of Belgrade. Beta reported 11 men were injured,
two seriously, when the barracks were hit.
Tanjug also reported that anti-aircraft fire was heard
Sunday in Novi Sad, the nation's second-largest city,
followed by an explosion.
In Podgorica, Montenegro, sources in the pro-West
ern government said a large column of Serbian military
vehicles including tanks, trucks and other armored
vehicles was seen Sunday moving south of Belgrade on
a highway that would take it to either Montenegro or
Kosovo.
The report on the armored column moving south
ward comes amid fears Milosevic may be planning a
military coup in Montenegro to oust his pro-Western
foe. President Milo Djukanovic.
