# Kenyan traditions spark controversy

KANYIJTO. Kenya (AP)
From wife inheritance to expensive
funeral rites, traditions that have
bound a west Kenyan culture for
generations are under attack.
But many members of the Luo,
the third-largest ethnic group in
Kenya, refuse to turn away from
their history.
"According to how we see it, we
cannot erode our culture," said Jane
Osege. a resident of Kanyuto.
A group of Luo leaders sparked
the controversy recently when they
condemned funeral rituals that soak

up large amounts of cash that could
be better spent on alleviating prob
lems of impoverished Kenyans.
The leaders also suggested
changes in the custom of a dead
man's wife being "inherited" by a
male relative as an additional wife.
The practice is blamed for helping
speed the spread of AIDS through
the community.
The debate made its way into the
national press, with academics and
politicians trading verbal blows with
those defending traditional culture.
In an open letter, Court of

Appeals Judge Richard Kwach. a
Luo traditionalist, harshly criticized
the leadership group, calling it a col
lection of "self-styled intellectuals
and elites" with little connection to
the average Luo.
But it is in places like Kanyuto, a
grassy village of 160 families three
miles from Kenya's third-largest
city, Kisumu, where the battle over
traditions will be won or lost.
Wife inheritance is blamed for
spreading AIDS from widows to
their new husbands and their other
wives. Nearly one of every four peo

pie in the Kisumu area is infected
with HIV, and about 9 percent of
Kenya's 29 million people are HlV
positive.
Jane Osege argues wife inheri
tance slows the spread of AIDS by
keeping women in stable relation
ships.
"If this culture is gone, it will
encourage prostitution, because a
woman cannot go without a man."
she said.
She said perhaps infected wid
ows could be inherited by men
already infected with the virus.
