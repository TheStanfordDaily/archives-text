# U.S. firms leave Russia

MOSCOW (AP) — Punkin' Donuts has
taken its Boston Cremes back to Boston.
Pizza Hut, unable to capture a large slice of
the Russian market, has closed its Moscow
restaurants. And Ben and Jerry's ice cream
operation melted away on the rocky road of
Russian capitalism.
Many of America's best known brands
streamed into Russia during the early 19905,
drawn to one of the world's largest untapped
markets.
But Russia's notoriously difficult business
climate combined with last year's financial
blowout has sent dozens packing, and prompt
ed others to lay off staff and scale back expan
sion plans.
"The worst case scenarios of what could
have happened in a long, cold Russian winter
have not played themselves out," said Scott
Blacklin, president of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Moscow.
"But if we get to the summer and there is
no significant improvement, then I think we
could see deeper disillusionment, which could
lead to a serious bleeding of the American
presence," he added.
The Americans are by far the largest for
eign investors in Russia, with more than S(H)
U.S. firms operating here. Their activity

peaked in 19% and 1997 as Russia's financial
markets soared and the economy hinted at
growth after years of depression.
But since the economic crisis struck last
August, about 50 members of the American
Chamber of Commerce have left the country.
Financial services were the hardest hit, and
those leaving tended to be smaller firms.
Larger companies that have already invested
big sums in Russia are still trying to weather
the storm.
Under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
the political climate has stabilized.
Still, critics say the government still hasn't
come up with a coherent plan to reverse the
economic decline.
In a survey of Chamber of Commerce
members, almost two-thirds said they have
suffered "significant losses" due to the crisis
and more than half said they have laid off
workers.
American food franchises have been
among the most high-profile entries into the
Russian market, and their mixed fortunes
demonstrate both the risk and potential of
doing business in Russia.
When Dunkin' Donuts announced it's
withdrawal earlier this month, it cited sales
that swooned 50 percent after the crisis.
