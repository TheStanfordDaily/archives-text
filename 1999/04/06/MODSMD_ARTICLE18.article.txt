Daily editor reflects
on trials and tribulations
of entering job market

I'M SURE EVERY senior is
familiar with the experience: You
run into a friend you haven't
seen since freshman year, and one of
the first things that comes up in con
versation is, "So, what are you doing
after graduation?"
My response — one which I'm
sure some seniors can relate to — is,
"I'm not sure yet."
For someone who has spent the
past 20 years following a well-beaten
path — grade school leading to mid
dle school leading to high school, col
lege applications leading to
Stanford —it actually feels exhila
rating to veer from the norm. I have
no immediate plans for graduate
school and still haven't gone to a sin
gle job interview.
But I shouldn't make myself out to
be more of a rebel than I really am. I
have a summer job that will keep me
employed through September, and
one job interview scheduled for late
May. And I finally registered for the
Career Development Center's on
campus recruiting program last
week.
Still, this rough sketch of my post
graduate plans is a far cry from
spring quarter in my senior year of
high school, when I knew that I'd be
spending the next four years at Stan
ford.

And it is exactly this uncertainty
and the endless range of possibilities
that is so exciting. For the first time
in my life, 1 feel as if the future is in
my hands, and there is nothing I feel
obligated to do.
I don't have to read four chapters
of an obscure text by Thursday or
write a 10-page paper on the signifi
cance of Congressional gridlock by
Friday.
1 could get a mindless temping job
in New York, or any major city for
that matter, and spend my evenings
and weekends taking in the city's cul
tural resources.
1 could go live with a generous
friend, bumming food and shelter
from him or her while doing free
lance writing.
I could get a one-way ticket to
anywhere in the world and be forced
to use my own resourcefulness and
wits to survive in a foreign location.
Some might say that I am merely
exhibiting a ridiculous naivete about
"the real world" and what it takes to
survive in it. But so be it. I want to
experience the highs and the lows of
a life unfettered by midterms, prob
lem sets and finals.
After a high-strung life of school,
exams and "expectations," it would
not be uncharacteristic of me to
change my mind and decide that the
comfort and stability of a future job
are worthwhile.
But for now, I'm going to enjoy
the adventure of unemployment.
