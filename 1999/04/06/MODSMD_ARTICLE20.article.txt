## Elements of a 'news'paper 
### 
Atiba Pertilla

I READ THE New
York Times two dif
ferent ways: in the first
place, as the source of
some of the best national
and international news
analysis I can put my
hands on with ease; and.

secondarily, as my hometown paper, with
articles that always provide me with new
opportunities to exercise my distaste for
Rudy Ciiuliani.
Last week while researching another col
umn, I came across a quote that seemed to
sum up exactly the point I was trying to
make, and cheered. Hut then 1 re-read it,
realizing that the name sounded familiar
and finally pinning it down as a guy from my
high school who was in the year below mine.
"Small world," I thought, and filed that bit
of trivial serendipity away for future refer
ence.
Hut I've come to realize that such
moments occur much too often for coinci
dence; I've seen familiar names in just about
every section of my favorite paper, from
"National" to "Arts & Leisure." As I tried
to explain to a Californian, it can be discon
certing to see your acquaintances' lives laid
bare — for example, a letter from an old
teacher bilked out of her savings by a mutu
al fund — on the pages of the national paper
of record.
Maybe this shouldn't be such a surprise:
in most parts of America there is bound to
be an elite, and that group is bound to share
some opinions. Hut as a consequence, it
seems, such papers — not only The Times, I

suspect, hut many others — too often reflect
the concerns of a small, tight clique of peo
ple. Probably one of my favorite ads is the
one that occasionally appears in The Times'
Sunday magazine asking people "con
cerned" about their future savings to give
Capital & Co. a ring, $3 to 4 million being
the minimum initial investment required.
Moreover, because of The Times' reputa
tion, the tacit assumption is that what
appears on its pages is unimpeachable truth.
One article last month noted that college
students may be "welcoming" the imposi
tion of greater supervision by university
administrators. This may well be true, but
the only evidence offered was a look at pro
grams at seven or eight colleges, most in the
Northeast, and a few interviews, including
some opposed to the author's point of view.
All the same, the impression we're meant
to come away with is that students are clam
oring for more attention, and most of the let
ters to the editor in response took that asser
tion as given even if they disagreed with the
supposed trend. The beauty of the power of
such elite institutions is their ability to intro
duce issues of parochial (and probably, in
this case, parental) concern into the general
cultural awareness and present them in
terms of universal interest. As one old jour
nalism joke puts it, a piece about police bru
tality usually means that the city editor got a
parking ticket the day before.
And there are other moments (I'm sure
anthropologists have a great term for it)
when writers, presumably speaking to a het
erogeneous readership, explicitly emphasize
their elite status. I'm thinking of Katie

Roiphe's recent Op-Ed piece that began, "I
remember the butter pats that covered the
soaring ceiling of my freshman dining hall
" Kudos if you knew she's talking about
Harvard right off the bat, though she clues
the rest of the nation in three paragraphs
later. The thrill for the elite reader, I assume,
lies in those intervening sentences, when he
knows exactly where Roiphe is talking
about before the hoi polloi.
Often, then, the open newspaper has all
the informative value of a sun reflector,
bouncing back into the eyes of we, the elite
audience, an idealized vision of how the
world ought to be. And in all likelihood,
more of the same lies ahead as our fellow
students move on to take their positions in
the business pages or the theater reviews or
the society columns.
I have to admit that Noam Chomsky has
probably described this entire process much
better than I ever could. In writing this piece
I have been committing the same sin I con
demn, assuming that my experience is rec
ognizable and, indeed, paradigmatic for
everyone I address. My object is to point out
the degree to which our "news" is being
shaped in accordance with what we want to
hear.
For my part, I promise never to write a
column for this or any other publication that
begins, "I remember the screams at mid
night "
