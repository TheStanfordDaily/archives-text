Daily is always so right
I want to retract what I said in my recent
letter about the dangers of corporatization
of the Bookstore. Friday's Daily editorial
on the issue really changed my mind. Your
editorial was, as you suggested, "carefully
considered" in ways my letter wasn't.
I think you were right on target when
you said, "Large corporations ... can stock
more books and sell them at lower prices"
than, for example, a student co-operative or
used bookstore. You're so right. How could
an independent bookstore, whose mission
was to sell used books at break-even profit
and just split returns back to the communi
ty. ever ease our financial burdens more
than, say. a national shopping mall chain?
What with library taxes so high, we might as
well do away with libraries, too and just give
everybody a voucher to spend at Barnes &
Noble. I hope that idea is clever, but could
you let me know for sure?
Moreover, thank you for pointing out
the important fact that I missed, that "Stu
dents at Harvard and IJ(' Berkeley, whose
schools have turned to outside vendors in
recent years, have largely praised the new
operations as cheaper and more convenient
for students." I should have remembered
before I wrote my letter that recently a
friend at Harvard told me he prefers the
new Barnes & Noble in Harvard Square
because, "not only is it cheaper than the
Harvard Co-op. but new books are so much
shinier than used ones." I myself totally for
got about the shiny book issue.
Finallv, as a symbolic systems major I

want to express my admiration of The
Daily's intricate logic when you said,
"There may soon be a day when most stu
dents buy textbooks from their dorm
rooms, a service that the Bookstore has
been unable to provide, and that trend
could force the non-profit group out of busi
ness." Wow, I never thought that a non
profit used bookstore might be more expen
sive than, say, Amazon.com, what with the
non-profit trying not to make a profit and
all. Moreover, it costs so much for those
stores to order books in bulk. And, man, I
totally ignored a basic assumption here, that
we have an obligation to keep for-profit
bookstores in business.
Thanks for being there as a resource
when I start questioning the trenchant rea
soning with which the administration makes
its decisions. Next time, I'll make sure to
more "carefully consider" the altruistic
intentions of big corporations that the Uni
versity might contract with, like Barnes &
Noble. Nike and all those folks down at the
Stanford Shopping Center.

Porn stirred needed dialogue
The first time I read the Free Sexx col
umn in The Daily's Intermission section I
was thoroughly shocked. In the past few
weeks, equally shocking articles describing
anal sex, public sex and fetishes have
appeared in this same column. The Free
Sexx column is certainly as disturbing as the

pornography aired on SCBN. Both the Free
Sexx column and SCBN's programming
have served a similar purpose: The Daily
shocks and entertains, while SCBN enter
tains and shocks but also educates.
Following the airing of "Conquest" by
SCBN. I had numerous conversations with
students both male and female throughout
campus. I can with great certainty say that in
most dormitories and houses throughout
campus, both males and females were
watching. Curious viewers watched because
the programming was rebellious — in such
an apolitical campus, students felt a perhaps
misplaced sense of freedom. We as students
would never rally against war like our par
ents did; in fact, politics are discussed at
Stanford with minimal frequency.
This aside, a great number of my friends
had never seen pornography before. Most
failed to understand its sexual appeal and
were curious as to why this multi-billion dol
lar industry survives. Initially curious and
embarrassed giggles emerged from some,
leading eventually to greater discussion.
Several people I know had just finished a
gender studies course that analyzed the
effects that pornography has on society.
Questions such as the role of pornography
in the degradation of women were brought
to light, and they were given a forum in an
intimate comfortable setting amongst
friends. I think that the airing of pornogra
phy on SCBN truly did enhance campus dis
cussion. Hooray SCBN!
It is in poor taste of The Daily to hypo
critically reprimand the actions of SCBN.
SCBN had never planned to make porn
part of its typical programming. Instead,

after numerous requests by the campus
community, the station decided to air the
programming once. SCBN deserves our
respect and understanding. The students
that run the station are volunteers and often
carry hefty academic loads on top of numer
ous other extracurricular activities. Once
again, hooray SCBN!
1 only hope that SCBN will he more sup
portive of free speech when someone
attempts to censure The Daily than our stu
dent paper has been of our television sta
tion.

SCBN provides useful service
I am a casual viewer of SCBN. Although
1 do not condone the recent gaffe by the sta
tion, I still find it to be a valuable resource.
Stanford's isolated location makes it dif
ficult for students not endowed with cars to
go see a movie or other entertainment. And
the need for a study break doesn't always
come when Blockbuster is open.
SCBN's Teleflicks movies are a welcome
alternative. Sure, the picture isn't perfect,
but it's nice to be able to enjoy a good film
with friends anytime, right in our lounge or
rooms.
That's a service 1 appreciate, and I trust
other students will join me in continuing to
support SCBN.
