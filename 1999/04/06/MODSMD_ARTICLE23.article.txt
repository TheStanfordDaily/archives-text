## Balanced budget? Not until you count all the costs 
### 
THE DAILY STORY that ran last
Friday on the budget savings
allegedly achieved by Stanford's
legal ottice doubtless reports general
counsel Michael Roster's claims accurate
ly, but the claims themselves deserve
much closer scrutiny. Roster stated that
contracting with external law firms to han
dle the University's legal affairs has res
cued the legal office from debt.
In the lirst place, Roster's assertion that
he rescued a budget that had been"in the
red." portraying himself as an architect of
fiscal turnaround, sidesteps some funda
mentals ol budget-making in a service cen
ter like the legal office. A balanced budget
in the corporate setting means that the
firm has revenues as great as. or greater
than, its expenses — that is. what it is paid
for goods and services equals or exceeds
its costs of labor, materials and capital.
But things aren't quite that simple in a
non-profit activity like the legal office.
That office's direct expenses consist of
the contractual costs of the outside attor
neys. plus the salaries paid to the handful
of survivors of the outsourcing effort. The

revenues come in the form of charges to
certain other units in the University that
require legal services (academic depart
ments don't pay), and from a direct budget
allocation. The claims that the budget was
"in the red" in the past, or that it is "in the
black" today, depend on the charge-out
policy in effect and on the size of the direct
allocation. Unless complete budget figures
are portrayed for both periods, both
claims are empty.
A much more serious problem is pre
sented by some other costs — costs that
are both undisclosed and not discussed in
Roster's statements to The Daily. These
are what an environmental economist
would call "external costs" — external
because they fall outside the legal office
budget. Two kinds of these are especially
important. First, much of the legal office
effort is properly invested in defending the
University against lawsuits and keeping its
faculty teaching and doing research
instead of testifying. University President
Gerhard Casper indicated the vital nature
of this function when he devoted much of
his last address to the Academic Council

to his understandable distress over being
called, again and again, for testimony in
depositions. His complaint is one with
which I am fully sympathetic.
When 1 was University president I
thought it was the legal office's job to keep
me out of court and out of depositions,
and it delivered: 1 had to enter a deposi
tion room only once in the 12 years of my
presidency, and that was relatively brief
and painless. Recently I got such a call,
and it gave me a glimpse into one of the
hidden costs of the legal office's outsourc
ing. At various times as my role in the case
developed, 1 was contacted by two differ
ent lawyers from the replacement firms.
Neither knew much about University pro
cesses. and it appeared that they hadn't
talked much to one another. I spent more
time than 1 wanted calling the attention of
one to what I had been told by the other,
or explaining how universities do things.
That kind of lost time, and the internal
inefficiency it creates, represent only one
of the external costs. Another — and it
may have been a silent contributor to
Casper's annoyance — flows from how

Stanford's lawyers decide whether and
when to settle. Roster asserts that his new
practices have led to faster closure of
cases, and he may well be right. But the
budget numbers are undisclosed, and set
tlement costs are not even mentioned. In
the l l M)s Stanford's settlement rule was:
settle early and cheaply if it's not a winner,
and otherwise hang tough. I have the
impression that present policy differs.
As long as settlement costs are unstat
ed, they constitute a hanging externality
that challenges any claim of fiscal good
health bv the legal office. In addition to its
direct costs, willingness to settle delivers a
positive incentive to other litigants. In the
past the message was discouraging: non-
Stanford attorneys have told me that in
those days they were reluctant to advise
their clients to sue the University because
they know that "Stanford just doesn't roll
over."
One aspect of this kind of external cost
is especially insidious: the price is likely to
be paid not by those who are around when
it is levied but by those who will come
later. Thus in the first few vears of his

presidency, Casper may have benefited
from the earlier policy; conversely, his suc
cessors may pay the price of too much
acquiescence now. Like over-consumption
of natural resources or subtle environmen
tal degradation, such policies carry an
intergenerational penalty.
Of course, in this case we do not know
the actual costs of the internal ineffi
ciencies imposed by outside representa
tion or the deferred costs of the present
settlement policy. But 1 do know this, from
my research interest in the design of envi
ronmental policies: hidden or external
costs should be incorporated into financial
accounts where possible and at least rec
ognized when they cannot be measured
with precision.
To pretend that they do not exist
deludes the outside world and makes for
bad policy. As for the direct costs of set
tlement. those can and should be incorpo
rated and disclosed.
