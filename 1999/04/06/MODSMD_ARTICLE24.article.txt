## Dominant in SF Women thunder at Open 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
The Stanford women's track
team could have been a billboard
for the U.S. Postal Service this past
weekend at the Johnny Mathis In
vitational held at Ram Stadium in
San Francisco. Neither rain, nor
sleet, nor hail stopped the team
from delivering some fine perfor
mances.

WOMEN'S TRACK
■ Friday-Saturday: Stanford won
four individual event titles in the
Johnny Mathis Invitational.

Tops among the Cardinal
women was junior Maureen
Onyeagbako. Fortunate to com
pete in her best event in the Friday
sunshine, Onyeagbako won the
hammer throw with a toss of 180
feet, four inches.
Her metric conversion of 54.%
meters left her just shy of the
NCAA provisional qualifying
mark of 55.(X) meters. With this im
provement of more than three feet
from her previous personal best set
last week at the Stanford Invita
tional, it looks increasingly likely
that she will make the trip to the
NCAAs in Boise, Idaho.
"It seems like I'm having a
steady progression.... I have a lot
more in me, so once I put every
thing together it will get there,"
said Onyeagbako.
Second to Onyeagbako in the
hammer was junior teammate
Maggie Isaac with a Pacific 10 Con
ference qualifying mark of 165-04.
Isaac also competed in Friday's
only other event, the discus, where
she was bested for second place by
junior teammate Cassie Romuld.
Saturday the throwers picked
up where they left off with a 1-2-3
finish in the shot put by Romuld,
Onyeagbako and Isaac. Romuld's
winning throw of 44-11 was her sec
ond Pac-10 qualifying mark this
season.
Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na was pleased with the throwing
squad's early success.
"1 think our throwers did a won
derful job," said Lananna. "I think
that despite the crummy conditions
it allowed us an opportunity for our
throwers to compete.
"In events that are very technical
in nature, the more times you can
practice your event, the better off
you do and that's why we went to
the meet," Lananna said.
"The meet was an opportunity
for our throwers to practice the
technique that they've been work
ing on all winter and into the first

part of the spring."
Under the guidance of weights
and throws coach Robert Weir, the
Cardinal squad of throwers has im
proved tremendously and looks to
reach even greater heights this sea
son.
"I think there is still kind of a
ways to go. but the throwers are def
initely becoming a force." Onyeag
bako said. "We definitely have a
presence when we go to the other
meets."
The competition also served as
an opportunity for Stanford's
jumpers to get down their steps in a
low-key but harsh-weather environ
ment on Saturday. Senior Tara Oet
tinger jumped to victories in the
long and triple jumps, qualifying for
Pac-lOs in the latter event with a

mark of 3N-1 1/2. On her coat tails
was freshman teammate Shannon
Overly, finishing second in both
events.
The ("ardinal competed in only a
few track events hut had good show
ings in those races.
In the 1,500 meters. LaShawndra
Face, sophomore Elena Villarreal
and freshmen Maurica Carlucci and
Laura Turner took the fourth
through seventh-place spots in
times ranging from 4:41.84 to
4:48.37.
Had the conditions been better,
Pace, a senior captain who sees most
of her action in the form of the 400
and 800 meters, might have dipped
below the Pac-10 qualifying time of
4:40.14.
" The times weren't excellent, but

the tactics were good," said Pace.
The only other events on the
track for the Stanford women were
the 100-meter hurdles and the 400-
meter dash.
Freshman Robyn Woolfolk took
third in the former while senior
Cynthia Morman grabbed the
three-spot in the latter for the Car
dinal.
Despite the weather. Lananna
was satisfied with the outcome.
"The last two weeks and proba
bly even next week will be impor
tant weeks for us to do our training
and work hard," Lananna said.
"That's really what we're putting
our attention on. We're not really
worried about performances. We're
worried about being prepared for
the end of the season."
