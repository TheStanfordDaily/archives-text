## Dominant in SF Women thunder at Open 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
The Stanford women's track
team could have been a billboard
for the U.S. Postal Service this past
weekend at the Johnny Mathis In
vitational held at Ram Stadium in
San Francisco. Neither rain, nor
sleet, nor hail stopped the team
from delivering some fine perfor
mances.

WOMEN'S TRACK
â–  Friday-Saturday: Stanford won
four individual event titles in the
Johnny Mathis Invitational.

Tops among the Cardinal
women was junior Maureen
Onyeagbako. Fortunate to com
pete in her best event in the Friday
sunshine, Onyeagbako won the
hammer throw with a toss of 180
feet, four inches.
Her metric conversion of 54.%
meters left her just shy of the
NCAA provisional qualifying
mark of 55.(X) meters. With this im
provement of more than three feet
from her previous personal best set
last week at the Stanford Invita
tional, it looks increasingly likely
that she will make the trip to the
NCAAs in Boise, Idaho.
"It seems like I'm having a
steady progression.... I have a lot
more in me, so once I put every
thing together it will get there,"
said Onyeagbako.
Second to Onyeagbako in the
hammer was junior teammate
Maggie Isaac with a Pacific 10 Con
ference qualifying mark of 165-04.
Isaac also competed in Friday's
only other event, the discus, where
she was bested for second place by
junior teammate Cassie Romuld.
Saturday the throwers picked
up where they left off with a 1-2-3
finish in the shot put by Romuld,
Onyeagbako and Isaac. Romuld's
winning throw of 44-11 was her sec
ond Pac-10 qualifying mark this
season.
