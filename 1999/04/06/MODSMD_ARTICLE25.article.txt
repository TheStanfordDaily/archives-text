ference.

SOFTBALL
■ Today: No. 9 Stanford (29-8) at Sacramen
to State (17-15), 3 p.m.

With eight Pac-10 teams ranked in the top
15, this Stanford squad has a tough task ahead
of itself. At home this weekend, the Cardinal
(29-8, 2-4 Pac-10) will host both No. 12 Ore
gon State and No. 13 Oregon for double
headers. The games against the Beavers and
the Ducks may hold the fate to the Cardinal's
success in the Pac-10. After the weekend,
Stanford's record could be as good as 6-4 or as
p<x)r as 2-8.
First up for the Cardinal, though, is a tough
nonconference doubleheader on the road.
The team will travel to Sacramento today for
a matchup against the 17-15 Hornets of

Sacramento State.
This is the second time this season that
these two teams have squared off — and this
time, Stanford is looking for revenge. Sacra
mento State stole one from the Cardinal ear
lier when the two squads battled it out at the
Campbell / Cartier Classic on Feb. 20. The
Cardinal lost the game 4-1 after allowing the
Hornets to score runs in the first, third, fourth
and sixth innings.
Though Sacramento State is not ranked,
this is a game that Stanford should not take
lightly. Having already lost to the Hornets is
reason enough, but currently, Sacramento
State is riding a three-game winning streak
with three straight victories over Cal State-
Northridge (16-18).
Hornet players Andrea Becker and Julie
Gustafson are hitting at an impressive .500 av
erage, while Jenny O'Leary, who hit a home
run against the Cardinal in the last game, is
batting .357.
Four other Sacramento State players also
boast an average above .300. Collectively, the
team is holding its opponents to a weak .226
average.

Senior pitcher Marcy Crouch will be an integral part of Stanford's plans for their up
coming five-game week. The Cardinal zeroes in on Sacramento State in Sacramento
today at 3 p.m.
Stanford, though, has an impres
sive offensive lineup of its own. As a
team, the Cardinal boasts a .324 aver
age and is limiting its opponents to a
mere .162. Freshman Jessica Men
do/a and junior Kellie Wiginton cur
rently lead the team with .491 and
.412 averages, respectively. But Stan
lord knows that it can count on other
players to provide the needed runs.
First baseman Sarah Beeson, in
fieldcr Robin Walker, infielder

Michelle Schneider and
infielder / outfielder Jenni Foyle
have also all been hitting consistently
this season. All four are over the .300
mark.
Importantly, Stanford's pitching
gives it a clear advantage over the
competition. Seniors Marey Crouch
and Becky Blevins continue to im
press, holding a combined ERA of
1.02.
The Hornets combined ERA is
1.91, but Sacramento State has man
aged to tag a 2.25 ERA against op
posing pitchers, while Stanford's op
ponents hold a 5.92 ERA.
