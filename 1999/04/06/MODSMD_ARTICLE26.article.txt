# Weather gives women fits
## Golfers 10th in Arizona; men finish today at Western 
### Ben Jones Contributing writer 
I n golf, it is not always about beat
ing the course or the competition,
but also beating the elements. The
Stanford women's golf team found
out how tough such a task can be this
weekend as the squad traveled to
Tempe, Ariz., for the PING/Ari
zona State Invitational.

GOLF
■ Thursday-Saturday: No. 8 Stan
ford women finished 10th at the
PING / Arizona State Invitational.
■ Yesterday-Today: No. 23 Stanford
men at Western Intercollegiate at
Pasatiempo Golf Course.

High winds and unseasonably
cold temperatures wreaked havoc
with players during the first two days
of play on the par-72, 6,090 yard
Karsten Course as no golfer in the
17-team field broke par. Improved
conditions the final day brought
scores down, but the deficit was too
much for the eighth-ranked Cardinal
to overcome.

Stanford finished 10th in the team
competition as the host Arizona
State Sun Devils captured the crown
with a total score of plus-20 (884).
Duke finished in second place, 20
strokes behind the Sun Devils, as
Arizona, Texas Christian and Tulsa
rounded out the top-five.
Grace Park of Arizona State took
home the individual medalist trophy
with a three-over-par 219.
The difficult conditions gave the
Cardinal problems in the first two
rounds as the team posted scores of
319 and 313. Stanford rebounded the
last day, firing a 305 to finish at 937.
Stephanie Keever continued her
strong play for the Cardinal, leading
the team with her 15th-place finish.
Following an opening-round 79,
Keever improved to scores of 76 and
74 on the last two days to card a plus
-13 229.
Also playing well for Stanford
was Julie Dunn, who carded rounds
of 75 in each of the final two rounds
to finish at 233, just out of the top 30.
Rounding out the Cardinal scores
were Jae Jean Ro at 238, Hilary
Homever at 239and Michelle Sperry
at 247.'

Playing as an individual medalist,
Jessica Belskis tallied three straight
rounds of 79 to end up in a tie for
49th.
While the women played this
weekend, the Stanford men's golf
team finish up today in Santa Cruz,
Calif., for the Western Intercolle
giate at Pasatiempo Golf Course.
The field of IK teams played 36
holes on the 6,483 yard, par-71 lay
out yesterday followed by an 18-hole
final round today.
Coming off of their win at the
Anteater Invitational in Coto de
Caza, Calif., last week, the men look
to make another strong showing.
The victory, which was the team's
first since the 1995-1996 season, ele
vated the Cardinal three spots in the
rankings to No. 23.
The team is led by senior Joel Kri
bel, who captured the individual title
at the Anteater last week as well.
The three-time All-American
mewed up two places in the rankings
to sixth and looks to continue his
strong play.
Last week, Kribel was named this
year's Dave Williams Award recipi
ent for his brilliant career record.
