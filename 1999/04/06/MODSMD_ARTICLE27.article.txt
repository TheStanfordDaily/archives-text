# Card out for win
## 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
The fifth-ranked Stanford women's tennis team (17-2,6-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) has one word on its mind today: revenge. The last time the Cardi
nal faced No. 4 California (13-2,8-0), in late February, it suffered a narrow
5-4 loss, its first to the Bears since 1993.
The women travel to Berkeley today seeking vindication.
"We know they're beatable," said junior Jennifer Heiser. "We all feel
that we should have won the last time."
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan believes that his team has matured
since the loss. Freshmen talents Gabby Lastra, Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko
Tokuda are settling into the mindset necessary to play solid collegiate ten
nis week in and week out.

■ Today: No. 5 Stanford (13-2,6-1 Pacific 10 Conference) at No. 4 California
(13-2,8-0), 1:30 p.m.

"Our young team is getting older by the minute," Brennan said.
The three freshmen, all of whom suffered singles losses against the Bears,
have been playing well in recent weeks. Lastra, Kalvaria and Tokuda all
posted victories against No. 6 UCLA and No. 10 USC last weekend.
"I'm definitely starting to feel good about my tennis," said Kalvaria, who
has been fighting injury and a lack of confidence for much of this season.
Unlike Cal, Stanford has clobbered its last six opponents in dual-match
play. The Bears, on the other hand, have suffered recent losses to No. 12
Pepperdine and the University of San Diego.
"They have lost a few matches lately," said junior captain and All-Amer
ican Teryn Ashley. "But we have to be ready. You know they're going to be
excited and it's going to be tough because it's at Berkeley."
The Cardinal, however, will arrive at Cal prepared. The team is finally in
jury-free, and the women have the focus necessary to not allow a single
match slip away.
Like the last Cal-Stanford encounter, today's dual match could be decid
ed by the doubles if victory is not secured during singles play. In February,
the Bears won two of three doubles matches, including a come-from-behind
triumph at the No. 3 spot, to clinch the victory.
"They can play amazing doubles," Ashley said. "We just have to jump
out to a quick start in singles and then follow through in doubles. They're

at vengeance today at Cal. The Cardinal's February loss to Cal is its
only Pac-10 blemish.
