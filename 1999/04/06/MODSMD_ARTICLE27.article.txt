# Card out for win
## 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
The fifth-ranked Stanford women's tennis team (17-2,6-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) has one word on its mind today: revenge. The last time the Cardi
nal faced No. 4 California (13-2,8-0), in late February, it suffered a narrow
5-4 loss, its first to the Bears since 1993.
The women travel to Berkeley today seeking vindication.
"We know they're beatable," said junior Jennifer Heiser. "We all feel
that we should have won the last time."
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan believes that his team has matured
since the loss. Freshmen talents Gabby Lastra, Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko
Tokuda are settling into the mindset necessary to play solid collegiate ten
nis week in and week out.

■ Today: No. 5 Stanford (13-2,6-1 Pacific 10 Conference) at No. 4 California
(13-2,8-0), 1:30 p.m.

"Our young team is getting older by the minute," Brennan said.
The three freshmen, all of whom suffered singles losses against the Bears,
have been playing well in recent weeks. Lastra, Kalvaria and Tokuda all
posted victories against No. 6 UCLA and No. 10 USC last weekend.
"I'm definitely starting to feel good about my tennis," said Kalvaria, who
has been fighting injury and a lack of confidence for much of this season.
Unlike Cal, Stanford has clobbered its last six opponents in dual-match
play. The Bears, on the other hand, have suffered recent losses to No. 12
Pepperdine and the University of San Diego.
"They have lost a few matches lately," said junior captain and All-Amer
ican Teryn Ashley. "But we have to be ready. You know they're going to be
excited and it's going to be tough because it's at Berkeley."
The Cardinal, however, will arrive at Cal prepared. The team is finally in
jury-free, and the women have the focus necessary to not allow a single
match slip away.
Like the last Cal-Stanford encounter, today's dual match could be decid
ed by the doubles if victory is not secured during singles play. In February,
the Bears won two of three doubles matches, including a come-from-behind
triumph at the No. 3 spot, to clinch the victory.
"They can play amazing doubles," Ashley said. "We just have to jump
out to a quick start in singles and then follow through in doubles. They're

definitely a mental team, especially
against us."
The Cardinal will be led by the
nation's second-ranked tandem of
Ashley and freshman Marissa lrvin.
Kalvaria and Lastra will team up at
the No. 2 spot and the duo of Toku
da and Heiser will compete at No. 3.
Of course, the Bears boast de
fending NCAA doubles champions
Amanda Augustus and Amy
Jensen.
In singles play, the Cardinal will
be led by lrvin and Ashley, both of
whom had a rough past weekend.
On Friday, Ashley fell to
UCLA's Amanda Basica in straight
sets, while lrvin saw her 23-match

win streak snapped by USC's Ditta
Huber on Saturday. Both players,
however, feel that they're still at the
top of their games, attributing their
respective losses to off-days.
Brennan is confident that lrvin
and Ashley, along with the rest of
the team, are near peak form.
"I think we're ready and I think
we're healthy," he said. "It's going to
be a war."
The women are somewhat disap
pointed that they have no more
home matches for the rest of the sea
son, but they are looking forward to
heading to Cal and beating the
Bears on their home turf.
"The fact that it's there doesn't
matter," said senior Marisa
MacLennan. "They came into our
home and beat us. We're ready to
come into theirs and beat them."
