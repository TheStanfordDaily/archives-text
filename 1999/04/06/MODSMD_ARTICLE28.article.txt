David Duval. The list of Dave
Williams Award winners reads like
a who's who of professional golf's
elite young players. The next name
on that list is Stanford's own Joel
Kribel.
On April 1, Kribel, a three-time
AU-American, joined Woods as
the second Cardinal recipient of
the prestigious award in the last
four years.
The senior economics major
from Pleasanton, Calif., has starred
on the links for the Cardinal the
past four years, amassing six career
tournament victories, including a
win at last week's Anteater Invita
tional in Coto de Ca/.a. Calif., while
leading Stanford to the team title.
The win was Kribel's first of the
season, improving on five previous
second-place finishes earlier this
season.
Currently ranked sixth in the
collegiate world, Kribel has totaled
seven top-five finishes in nine tour

naments this year.
His scoring average for the sea
son has been a Cardinal-record
70.35 over 26 tournament rounds,
bettering Tiger Woods' 70.9 aver
age in 19%.
In addition to his impressive
collegiate career. Kribel has also
made his mark as one of the na
tion's best amateur golfers. His
play has earned him invitations to
the Masters and the U.S. Open, the
nation's two most prestigious pro
fessional tournaments.
Kribel's other accolades include
the individual medalist trophy in
the stroke play prelude to the 199N
United States Golf Association
Amateur Championship and a sec
ond-place finish in the Northeast
Amateur.
The award is named for Dave
Williams, former golf coach at the
University of Houston, who won
16 NCAA championships in his 36-
year tenure. Now in its seventh
year of existence, it is based tin an
individual's accomplishments over
a college career in academics, ath
letics and community service.
