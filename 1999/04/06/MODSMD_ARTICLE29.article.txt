## Tennis faces Cal 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
The No. 4 men's tennis team
takes on California today at 1:30
p.m. at the Taube Family Tennis
Stadium. It is a Pacific 10 Confer
ence match that the Cardinal can
not afford to take for granted as the
Bears have a young but feisty team
which always comes ready to play
against its rival.

MEN'S TENNIS
â–  Today: No. 4 Stanford (13-2. fi-1
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. California
(7-7. 1-5) at Taube Tennis Center.
1:30 p.m.

The Cardinal (13-2. 6-1 Pac-10)
is coming off of its toughest week
end of the year down in Los Ange
les as it gained a split by losing to
No. 1 UCLA and beating No. 10
USC. The Cardinal knows it must
fire back up to avoid any kind of let
down against Cal (7-7.1-5).
"Cal might not be a top-15 team,
but they definitely have some tough
players," said senior leader Ryan
Wolters. "They took the doubles
point from us at their place and
even though we won all six singles
matches, a few of them were close.
It will be a good match for us to im
prove on some of things we have
been working on. Hut we can't af
ford to take them lightly."
The Bears are coming off of a

good weekend despite losing to
both IJCLA and USC. Cal played a
solid match against the tup-ranked
Bruins. It lost that match 6-1 but
there were several three-set match
es that could have swung either
way. It then lost a close match to the
Trojans, who were probably ex
pecting to blow the Bears out.
"We have to be ready to play,"
said assistant coach John
Whitlinger. "Cal is coming off a
strong weekend where they proved
they can play the best teams closely.
Also, they always seem to play us a
little tougher. It is one of those
matches where you have to throw
the rankings and records out and
just come ready to play tennis. I ex
pect our guys to be ready."
Cal's No. 2 singles player,
Adrien Barnes, has been playing
especially well of late. Barnes won
both of his matches over the week
end in Los Angeles and he will most
likely be playing junior Geoff
Abrams. That could be a key
matchup, but perhaps the doubles
will be even more important for the
Cardinal.
The team has been struggling all
season to find its groove in doubles,
and today's match will be another
good opportunity to work on this
weakness. The Cardinal knows it
cannot afford to continually lose
the doubles point and put itself in
