# Med School barely escapes probation
## 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
The national agency that accredits American
medical schools has narrowly voted not to place
the School of Medicine on probation. A recent
study found the poor quality and condition of
Stanford's teaching facilities unacceptable, ac
cording to a letter the agency sent to President
Casper.
Accreditation by the national agency, the Li
aison Committee on Medical Education, is an
eligibility requirement for institutions seeking
federal funds. Accreditation is also necessary if
an institution's graduates are to be eligible to
take the United States Medical Licensing Ex
amination. a test one must pass to practice med
icine in the U.S.
The agency's letter to Casper included spe
cific condemnations of outdated lecture halls

and teaching laboratories. The agency also had
harsh criticism for the Medical School's library,
which only has air conditioning in those areas
used by librarians, no bathrooms and a subpar
computer system.
Michael Ennen. a third-year medical stu
dent. said conditions in the library are so bad
that "on any given Saturday there are just as
many Stanford medical students in the UC-San
Francisco medical library as there are in Stan
ford's. That many people drive up."
Administrators recognize that a problem ex
ists at the school. At a recent Faculty Senate
meeting, the medical school's senior associate
dean for education and student affairs, Phyllis
Gardner, deplored the "abysmal state of our ed
ucational infrastructure - library, classrooms,
and information technology." Casper has also

A survey performed by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education found the facilities at Stanford Medical Center unacceptable. Left, the
inside of Lane Library, which lacks air conditioning. Center, the exterior of the Med School. Right, a computer station at the library
said the medical school's teaching fa
cilities should he updated.
The LCME's harsh stance have
been influenced by a petition signed
by 99 percent of the student body call
ing for a greater attention to the qual
ity of teaching facilities.
Ennen and another student, Jean
Drouin, organized the petition last
fall-and sent it to the LCME. In their
cover letter, the students "encour
aged [the LCME] to remain steadfast
in [its] requirements for Stanford's
accreditation," Ennen said.
According to Ennen, the "same
[facilities] problems had been cited in
[accreditation] surveys since 1983.

For 14 years the school blew them
off."
Clinical Pharmacology Prof. Ken
neth Melmon, head of the medical
school Faculty Senate, attempted to
explain why the school did not act to
improve facilities following the
LCME's earlier complaints.
"I think first of all in the early days
of critique people didn't necessarily
agree with the critique so they consid
ered it much less important than they
consider it now. There were respons
es to it; maybe they were whole
hearted, maybe they were half heart
ed, but there were responses. There
was a lot of incomplete communica
tion on both sides," Melmon said.
While Director of Medical School
Admissions Gabriel Garcia noted
that the "clinical facilities are out

standing," Medical School Dean Eu
gene Bauer conceded that "other re
sources need to be brought to bear to
upgrade our more didactic teaching
facilities."
"We've been actively engaged in
investigating the various options that
are available to us for dealing with
these problems. The scope of solu
tions that we're talking about are at a
minimum of $40 million, possibly $40
to $60 million," Bauer said.
At the recent Faculty Senate
meeting in which these issues were
discussed, Melmon pointed out that
Stanford, unlike other medical
schools, had made no large invest
ment in its teaching facilities since its
move to the Palo Alto campus in
1959. A continued emphasis on build
ing facilities for disease research

rather than teaching has created the
current situation.
"It is far easier to get federal funds
to underwrite research costs as op
posed to teaching costs," Melmon
added.
"Nowhere did the LCME say any
thing about the quality of the educa
tional experience or deficiencies re
lated to content of educational expe
rience," Bauer said. He stressed the
opportunities for one-on-one interac
tion between faculty and students
working together on experiments at a
premier research institution.
"This is not a situation in which
one can position research priorities
versus educational priorities," Bauer
said.
Ennen, however, disagreed. "At
the end of the day, that just doesn't

wash. You don't go and study in
someone's research lab. As some ab
stract theoretical concept it's true. In
day-to-day reality, research and edu
cational space are not equivalent," he
said.
"Most students would say that the
teachers are fantastic," Ennen con
tinued. "But the facilities are crip
pling their ability to be innovative in
the teaching techniques that they use.
The physical space not only doesn't
promote [such endeavors], it actually
detracts from them."
While Ennen said that he would
be the first to admit that "the decision
to attend a certain medical school is
multifactorial, many prospective stu
dents had astutely honed in on the
disparity between Stanford's reputa
tion and stature and the state of its fa

cilities."
Ennen and Garcia also differed on
the effect that an LCME decision to
put the medical school on probation
would have on recruitment eltorts.
Ennen thought it would be "com
pletely devastating," while Garcia
thought it would have "a minor effect
on those people who were wavering
between us and another school."
Regardless of the hypothetical
consequences of probation, there
now seems to be a galvanized consen
sus among both administrators and
students to overhaul teaching facili
ties.
" This is something that clearly has
to be done. This is something that will
be done. This is something that the
LCME has mandated will be done,"
