## 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
The Stanford men made the
most of a practice opportunity at
the low-key Johnny Mathis Open
in San Francisco last weekend as
they captured titles in three events
and posted quality marks in a num
ber of others.
Challenged by competition
from area schools, including San
Francisco State, Chabot and Butte
Colleges, and a number of post-col
legians representing Great Britain
and the Farm Team, Stanford used
the meet as an early season
warniup and gauge for future
meets.
The Cardinal was led by the 1-2-
3 high-jump finish of freshman
Michael Ponikvar, who cleared six
feet, eight inches, sophomore Todd

Beyerlein (6-6) and Sophomore
Kay Bergstrom (6-4). Freshman
Darryl Meigs finished fifth for
Stanford at 6-3.

MEW'S TRACK
■ Friday-Saturday: Stanford won
three individual event titles at the
Johnny Mathis Invitational.

Another high point came for the
Cardinal on the track as freshman
upstart Evan Kelty rati away from
the field in the 200-meter dash to
win the event in a time of 22.13 sec
onds. almost half a second better
than his nearest competitor.
The Stanford 1,600-meter relay
team was also tops at the meet in
3:23.13.
The hurdlers showed signs of
life as well for the Cardinal as ju
nior Reggie Fears placed third in

the 400-meter hurdles at 58. 16 and
teammate Michael Harte was third
in the 110-meter blitz over the bar
riers in 14.39 seconds. Harte was
also eighth in the 100 meters in
11.12 seconds.
Other strong performances in
cluded freshman Chris Sprague's
third-place finish in the shotput at
52 feet. 103/4 inches, a fourth-place
showing by fellow frosh Ryan
Meuse in the 800 meters (1:56.15)
and redshirt freshman Jamey Clif
ford's third-place effort in the
1,500-meter run (4:02.36).
The Mathis meet provided Stan
ford's decathletes with a good op
portunity to gather experience in a
number of events.
Capitalizing on this opportunity
was senior Josh Gleason, who
placed third in the javelin (173-7)
and fourth in the pole vault (12-11

3/4) while adding a 13th-placc lin
ish in the discus (126-5) and a solid
15.25-second showing in the 110-
meter hurdles to his day's work.
C hase Wimberly, another se
nior multi-event competitor lor the
Cardinal, was equally impressive.
His mark of 12-11 3/4 equaled
(ileason's showing in the pole
vault, but Wimberly was awarded
fifth place based upon number of
attempts. He was eighth in the
javelin at 145-10. 14th in the 110
hurdles (16.66) and rounded out
the day with a toss of 99-10 in the
discus for 20th overall.
The decathletes will have their
chance to shine at the April 15-16
A/usa Pacific Multi-Events meet.
The rest of the Stanford squad will
now gear up for the first Oregon
Relays at Oregon's storied Hay
ward Field on April 10.
