# Debaters stand out in East Coast tournaments

For the past two weekends, the
Stanford Debate Society has
proven that Stanford debate re
mains a force to be reckoned with.
As most Stanford students were
relaxing during Spring Break,
Stanford debaters were competing
in the annual National Parliamen
tary Debate Association's national
competition in San Diego. Debate
partners Matt Spence and David
(iamage, both juniors, were indi
vidually awarded the fourth and
sixth best speaker awards, making
them the highest-ranked speaking
team at the tournament. Seniors
Erik Benson and Apu Sengupta
also performed well, reaching the
second-round elimination.
" This was the best performance
as a team" at this tournament com
pared to other years, said C iamage,
the team captain.
Unlike many East Coast tourna
ments that Stanford attends, the
national competition had a broader
geographic range of competing
schools. According to Spence,
"There were definite regional dif
ferences and it was interesting see
ing different styles of debate."
The weekend after nationals,
the debaters ventured to a tourna
ment at Princeton University.
First-year debaters Laura Brown
and Amer Ahmed ranked in ninth

place, with
Ahmed re
ceiving the
second
place
speaker
award.
Ahmed, a

freshman, is currently ranked as
the top first-year debater in North
America.
At that tournament, (iamage
was elected to the executive board
of the American Parliamentary
Debate Association as a member
at-large. (iamage's responsibilities
will include training American de
baters to compete overseas and
overseeing the publication of the
association's magazine.
"It's the first time a western
state has been represented," Ciam
age said. "It's really good for us as
a school."
Spence agreed. "It is an amazing
accomplishment," he said. "(Gam
age] is going to represent Stanford
well and improve Stanford's pres
ence" on the national scene.
The success of the debate team
does not come without sacrifice,
however. When travelling to East
Coast weekend events, "your life is
on hold," according to sophomore
Mariam Ali, a second-year de
bater. Students leave late on
Thursday and return to school late
on Sunday evenings, often getting

little sleep. Travelling with large
groups can also be stressful. Gam
age recalled an episode in January
when half the team ended up in
Providence and half in Boston. "It
can get crazy," he said.
Despite what Ali describes as
the "see-saw" nature of debate,
where emotions range from "de
pressed to happy to scared," all
members said they believe the hard
work pays off. Ali said that debat
ing "improves your analytic skills
and forces you to think quickly on
your feet," skills which she believes
will he important in future careers.
Spence participates in debate
"not only to compete, but to see the
country and see the world."
Recently, debaters have trav
eled to the Philippines and the
United Kingdom and next year will
go to World Championships in
Sydney, Australia. They have
taken trips around the East Coast
and last weekend saw a Broadway
show during their last tournament.
Members said they see a bright
future for Stanford debate. Gam
age said, "We are cohesive as a pro
gram, with larger breadth and lots
of strong novices."
Spence thinks recent successes
bode well for the future of the
team, and points out that the team
is always looking for new members.
"A lot of people are intimidated,
but the team is really accessible."
