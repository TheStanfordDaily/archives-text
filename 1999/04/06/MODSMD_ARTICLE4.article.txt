Depending on how generous
students feel during the upcoming
spring elections. ASSU special fees
might double next year.
This year, 39 student groups will
be on the ballot for special-fee re
quests. a 40 percent increase over
the number of special-fee requests
students voted on last year. If all the
special-fee items pass. ASSI' finan
cial manager Matt (iarlinghousc es
timates that undergraduate stu
dents will pay $1% and graduate
students $75 next year.
Last year. 2<S groups applied for
funding, and all but the I Jndergrad
uate Weenie Roast were approved.
The 27 groups received a combined
total of $937,892, which broke down

to $105 per undergraduate student
and $37 per graduate student.
Not everyone is pleased with the
large increase in special funding re
quests. "I. like many others, am se
riously concerned about the signifi
cant increase in student fees," said
Maren Norton, president of the
ASSIJ. "1 encourage student
groups to explore all possible av
enues for funding. Aside from spe
cial fees, student groups should take
the initiative to find other funding
options—including, but not limit
ed to. the Stanford Fund Partner
ship. University departments, vari
ous University administrative of
fices and local businesses."
Groups as diverse as Model
United Nations and Stanford
