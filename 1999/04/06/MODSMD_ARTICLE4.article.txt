## 
### Brittney Jensen Contributing writer 
Depending on how generous
students feel during the upcoming
spring elections. ASSU special fees
might double next year.
This year, 39 student groups will
be on the ballot for special-fee re
quests. a 40 percent increase over
the number of special-fee requests
students voted on last year. If all the
special-fee items pass. ASSI' finan
cial manager Matt (iarlinghousc es
timates that undergraduate stu
dents will pay $1% and graduate
students $75 next year.
Last year. 2<S groups applied for
funding, and all but the I Jndergrad
uate Weenie Roast were approved.
The 27 groups received a combined
total of $937,892, which broke down

to $105 per undergraduate student
and $37 per graduate student.
Not everyone is pleased with the
large increase in special funding re
quests. "I. like many others, am se
riously concerned about the signifi
cant increase in student fees," said
Maren Norton, president of the
ASSIJ. "1 encourage student
groups to explore all possible av
enues for funding. Aside from spe
cial fees, student groups should take
the initiative to find other funding
options—including, but not limit
ed to. the Stanford Fund Partner
ship. University departments, vari
ous University administrative of
fices and local businesses."
Groups as diverse as Model
United Nations and Stanford

Chamber Chorale are applying for
the first time.
"Some groups are applying for
the first time due to the fact they are
new groups," said Malia Villegas,
co-chair of the appropriations com
mittee for special fees. "Other
groups have increased in si/e and
programming."
To be placed on the ballot for the
first time, a group must get a peti
tion signed by 15 percent of its tar
geted student population, equiva
lent to 983 signatures for undergrad
uate funding and 1,089 for graduate
funding. Alternatively, groups may
get 10 percent of students' signa
tures plus approval by the ASSU
Senate.
Returning groups, which include
Stanford in Government, SPOON,
the Chaparral and Mind's Eye Lit
erary Magazine, can be placed on
the ballot without a petition if the

requested amount hasn't increased
over 11.6 percent.
Since 1995, when the Common
Sense Fees Reform was passed in an
ASSU election, the overwhelming
majority of special-fee requests
have won approval. Before the re
form, groups solicited funding from
the entire student population.
Under the current system groups
can request funding from under
graduate students, graduate stu
dents, or both.
In 1994, amidst the controversy
that inspired the reform, only 17 of
36 groups on the ballot received spe
cial-fee funding. In 1995, 23 of 29
candidates were approved. A total
of $1 ,(X)9,465.40 was given to 30 out
of 31 applying groups in 1997. That
year started a trend of almost all the
groups receiving funding.
Groups must receive a majority
of affirmative votes in the Spring
General Elections to obtain fund
ing. In addition, 15 percent of the
eligible voters must vote on that
item.
