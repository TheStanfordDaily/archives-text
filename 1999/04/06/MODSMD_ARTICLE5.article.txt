"If you're not counted, you don't
count," emphasized the U.S. Census
Bureau Director Ken Prewitt during
a speech yesterday at Bishop Audi
torium.
Prewitt, the man appointed to
count every person in the United
States, explained the government's
preparation for the upcoming census
in a speech titled "Census 2(XX) â€”
Does It Matter Who is Counted?"
Prewitt is the inaugural speaker in
the Donald E. Nickelson Distin
guished Lecture Series, hosted by
the Stanford Institute for the Quanti
tative Study of Society. He ad
dressed the heated issue of differen
tial undercount, in which millions of
people are excluded from the census

because they are difficult to find or
are unwilling to cooperate with the
Census Bureau. The census is one of
the most intense issues in politics
today, Prewitt said, because differen
tial undercount affects racial minori
ties, how much money the govern
ment allocates to groups and parti
san power.
"The statistical system is at the
heart of the battle, because a lot of
arguments are about power and
money, [and] also respect and recog
nition." Prewitt said. "Who counts?
Who is present and who is visible?
We spent a lot of time talking to those
[ minority] groups who are desperate
ly concerned about how well they're
going to be represented in the census
2(KX). Some urban American Indians
said {minorities are facing] 'statistical

extinction.' To not appear in the ( "en
sus means you're not there."
According to Prewitt. the Census
Bureau discovered the gravity of dif
ferential undercount in the 1940 cen
sus. That year, more 18- to 24-year
oltl black males enlisted or were
drafted than the Bureau believed ex
isted. Even Thomas Jefferson, who
conducted the first national census in
1790. noticed the visible problem of
undercount, Prewitt said. Although
the count was 3.9 million, Jefferson
told his European colleagues that at
least one million more Americans
existed. In the colonial period, Jef
ferson wanted other countries to see
the I 'nitedStatesasa stable, growing
nation. Today, Prewitt said, different
groups and people want to be seen
and have power. Undercount re
mains a problem for the Census Bu
reau. he said.
"You have got to find 275 million
people and attach them to 275 mil
lion addresses on April 1," Prewitt
said. "There is no way, with whatev
er apparatus we put in place, that we
can find those people and attach
them to those addresses on a certain

date. You think that's socially unjust
because it malapportions power, it
malapportions resources, and it
abuses the whole politics of identity,
[but] there's always going to be an
undercount."
Introduced as "one of ours," Pre
witt received his doctorate in politi
cal science at Stanford in 1963. He
later became president of the Social
Science Research Council, taught
for 15 years at the University of
Chicago, then became director of
the National Opinion Research
Center (NORC).
