### Virginia Yang Contributing writer 
Sidney Droll, professor emeritus
of theoretical physics at the Stan
ford University Linear Accelerator
Center and a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institute, has been named
one of the four members of a spe
cial panel of the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board.
At the request of President Clin
ton. this panel is charged with in
vestigating the security and coun
terintelligence threat to the De
partment of Energy's weapons labs.
"The Board is to address the na
ture of the present counterintelli
gence security threat, the way in
which it has evolved over the last
two decades and the steps we have
taken to counter it. as well as to rec
ommend any additional steps that
may be needed," Clinton said in a
press release last month.
Clinton convened the advisory

panel after sus
picions that
China stole nu
clear weapons
designs from the
United States. A
recent develop
ment centered
around Wen Ho
Lee, a Chinese-

American computer scientist born
in Taiwan who was fired from the
Los Alamos National Laboratory
in New Mexico for violation ol se
curity rules. Investigations conclud
ed that he may have helped China
obtain American nuclear technolo
gy-
"This is an important problem
and a matter involving national se
curity, and we will do our best to un
derstand the situation and address
the issues," said Drell.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Scott Sagan said it was "appropri
ate to have a high-level committee

to look at this issue and to examine
the various aspects. There needs to
be a balance between openness and
sharing of scientific information
with national security issues."
Drell has been a professor at
Stanford since 1956 and is one of
the founding faculty members of
SLAC. He has been a professor at
SLAC since 1963 and served as
deputy director until his retirement
last year.
Drell also formerly served as
chairman of the University of Cali
fornia President's Council on the
National Laboratories. Drell has
been involved in advising the gov
ernment on arms control issues
since the 1960s and has been a
member of the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board since
1993, when he was appointed by
President Clinton.
Drell emphasized that "serving
on the panel is an outside involve
ment and the Stanford Linear Ac

celerator Center has nothing to do
with it. The work done at the Cen
ter is all open to the public."
The three other members of the
special panel are all renowned spe
cialists. Ann Caracristi, former
deputy director of the National Se
curity Agency, currently serves on
the Board of Visitors of the Joint
Military Intelligence College and as
a consultant to the National Securi
ty Agency. Stephen Fried
man is a successful businessman
and has served as chairman of
Goldman Sachs & Co. He is cur
rently a senior principal of Marsh &
McLennan Capital Inc.
Heading the panel is former
Senator Warren Rudman.
The advisory panel has been di
rected to report to President Clin
ton within the next 60 days. Drell
said that "it is best to see how the
problem develops" and would not
comment further until the board
has completed its investigation .
