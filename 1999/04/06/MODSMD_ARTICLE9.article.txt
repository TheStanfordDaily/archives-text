# IFC, fraternities gear up for dry Rush
## 
### Jad Fakhry Contributing writer 
Fraternities conducting Rush
Week have a heightened sense of
awareness about the importance ol
dry rushes due to an incident involv
ing the Phi Delta Theta fraternity
last year.
Rush, which began yesterday,
has historically been dry. Last year,
the Phi Dell fraternity was placed
on probation for serving alcohol
during a Rush event. It then violat
ed that probation in the fall, leading
the University to evict the Phi Delts
from their house and revoke the fra
ternity's charter.
To promote a sense of whole
some enthusiasm about Rush, the
Interfraternity Council set up an
all-fraternity barbecue on Saturday
at Wilbur field. IFC President

Mike Martinez said, "It's some
thing different that we had in order
for Rushees to meet fraternity
brothers and get to know other
R ushees."
Martinez also said that last year's
Phi Dell incident will have an effect
on the fraternities' efforts to ensure
that Rush Week is dry and runs
smoothly. "I believe chapters will
take that into consideration, as well
as the fact that dry Rush will always
be stressed."
Martinez believes that a dry Rush
adds to a fraternity's reputation,
rather than reducing it. "Chapters
will try to represent the fraternity in
the way they want to be seen."
Tim Fisher, IFC vice president
for recruitment, said. "We're em
phasizing dry Rush and safety to the
chapters." I Ic also echoed Martinez,
explaining that' Rush Week has al

ways been dry. "We're trying not to
sound preachy, but the rules are
there for reasons. Every fraternity
knows the [reasons]." He added that
safety is the main concern in keeping
Rush dry.
Collin Hathaway, president of
Sigma Chi, has planned several
events for Rush Week, all of which
are dry. 1 le explained that the no-al
cohol policy is enforced strictly at
Sigma Chi. "I think people have
taken it seriously since Phi Delt," he
said.
"I understand the premise be
hind dry Rushes, and 1 don't think
[alcohol) would contribute to the
Rush process."
Michael Wilson, president of Phi
Kappa Psi. has set up an elaborate
Rush week. The chapter is having a
Games Night, Texas Barbecue,
Monte Carlo Night, and Swank

Night. Alcohol will not be an issue at
these events, Wilson said. "We don't
need alcohol to attract Rushees.
That's not what we're about."
Wilson added that enforcing dry
Rush has never been a problem. He
is confident that Rush Week will be
a success and Phi Kappa Psi will eas
ily fill its spots. "We are looking to
strengthen the chapter this year," he
said.
Farzad Alemi, a rushing fresh
man, said. "I don't think alcohol
should be necessary to have fun, and
its absence shouldn't keep people
from enjoying Rush Week."
Freshman Milo Lochbaum pro
posed another viewpoint: "1 think
Rush should reflect frat life at Stan
ford. I mean, we should be able to
get rip-roaring drunk and have some
fun."
