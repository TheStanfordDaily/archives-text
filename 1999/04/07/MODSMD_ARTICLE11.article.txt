## Mexican governor in hiding 
### 
MEXICO CJTY (AP) â€”A for
mer state governor under investiga
tion for alleged ties to drug traffick
ers said in a letter published yester
day he has gone into hiding to
escape politically motivated perse
cution.
Mario Villanueva. whose six-year
term in Quintana Roo State ended
Monday, has failed to appear for
questioning by prosecutors since a
12-hour interrogation by Mexico's
anti-drug czar last month, and did
not attend his successor's inaugura
tion Monday night.
"Harassed by an investigation
aimed at incriminating me at any
cost with the trafficking and use of
drugs ... I have abandoned my turf
to avoid being jailed." Villanueva
wrote in a letter sent to Mexico City
newspapers.

His lawyer. Juan Collado, con
firmed Villanueva had written the
letter, the daily Reforma said. The
former governor did not reveal his
whereabouts.
Villanueva, who has not been
charged with any crime, said he
expected the attorney general's
office to charge him with "launder
ing drug money, illegal enrichment,
tax evasion and who knows what
else."
He claimed the accusations he
worked with drug traffickers are
"absurd and ridiculous," saying that
as governor he had no opportunity to
protect drug traffickers from federal
authorities. The attorney general's
office had no comment yesterday.
Villanueva's successor, Joaquin
Hendricks Diaz, said yesterday that
the attorney general's office had

every right to investigate the former
governor and that the new state
administration would cooperate by
providing information about the
case, the government news agency
Notimex reported.
Villanueva claims he is being per
secuted because he opposed efforts
by national leaders of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party to
control Quintana Roo's state gov
ernment.
The investigation of Villanueva
has been an embarrassment to the
PRI. The party's president, Jose
Gonzalez Fernandez, said Villanue
va could be expelled if he is found to
have drug links.
U.S. authorities, including the
Drug Enforcement Administration,
have joined Mexican police in the
search for Villanueva.
