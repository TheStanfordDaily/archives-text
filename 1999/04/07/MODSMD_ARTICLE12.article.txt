# Truce called in honor of Easter rejected by NATO
## Milosevic declares cease-fire 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AF) â€” Yugoslav Presi
dent Slobodan Milosevic declared a unilateral cease-fire
yesterday in his campaign to crush rebels in Kosovo, say
ing he wanted to honor the Orthodox Easter holiday this
weekend. Western leaders called the move a sham and
pledged to press ahead with airstrikes.
Moments after the cease-fire took effect at X p.m. (11
a.m. PST), air-raid sirens wailed in Belgrade, heralding
new NATO attacks.
At least six explosions could be heard late yesterday
in the direction of the Batajnica military airport just
north of Belgrade and tracer rounds from anti-aircraft
were seen in the night sky.
Yugoslav television stations reported further attacks
last night at Uzice, 75 miles southwest of Belgrade, and
in Cacak, an industrial town 55 miles to the south, where
U.S. officials say a munitions plant is located.
The Yugoslav cease-fire declaration was clearly
aimed at staving off further NATO attacks and at pre
senting Milosevic's government as a champion of peace.
President Clinton and NATO insisted that half-mea

sures would not end the NATO air campaign that began
March 24, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office
said Milosevic's announced truce "doesn't go nearly far
enough."
A rebel spokesman also rejected the cease-fire, which
was announced on Belgrade television stations, and said
the only way the group would agree to a truce would be
if NATO troops enforced it.
On the refugee front, NATO nations and others
rushed in tons of aid yesterday for the 4(X),0()0 ethnic
Albanians who have been driven out of Kosovo and into
poor neighboring states.
In its statement, the Yugoslav leadership said the ces
sation of hostilities against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army in advance of Sunday's Orthodox
Easter was a "gesture of good will."
Neither the cease-fire declaration nor statements
from Yugoslav officials said anything about holding fire
against NATO forces, which mounted their most inten
sive strikes of the two-week-old air campaign late Mon
day and earlv yesterdav.
