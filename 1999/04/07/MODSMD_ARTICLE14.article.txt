Recent grad housing
decision shows a
committed university

UNIVERSITY PROVOST
Condoleezza Rice and other
administrators have made
good on their promise to help the
graduate student housing crisis.
Rice announced at last week's
Faculty Senate meeting that plans
are slated to increase the minimum
graduate student salary by 7 percent.
They also intend to find more
units of off-campus subsidized hous
ing for graduate students, in addition
to plans already implemented or in
progress, to alleviate the University's
graduate housing problem.
The University administration
should be lauded for its concerted
effort at finding solutions to a situa
tion that has long been a source of
tension between graduate students
and administrators.
These feelings in part led to the
graduate student housing sleep-out
on the Quad last May.
The salary increase, totaling
approximately $2.3 million of Uni
versity general funds, comes in addi
tion to an S percent raise last year.
'ITie 2.50 new off-campus housing
units join 250 other units already
rented and 480 new spaces in Eseon
dido Village.
Implementing this plan will allow
more graduate students to be housed
on or near campus at below market
rate.
The salary increase should help
those who are forced to contend with
the exorbitance of the local housing
market.
And while the plans presented are
not an all-encompassing solution to a
large problem, they are definitely a
step in the right direction.

Rice's announcement makes it
clear that the administration gen
uinely cares about the needs and
concerns of its graduate students.
Further, this response comes as an
encouragement to the student body
as a whole, because it shows how stu
dents can have a direct role in affect
ing tangible and influential change.
Because University-wide funds
will be used to make these plans pos
sible, it is especially important that
undergraduates realize the impor
tance of this decision.
Graduate students play an
extremely important role at Stan
ford.
From serving as teaching assis
tants in undergraduate classes to
researchers in laboratories all over
campus, they help foster and perpet
uate what makes Stanford the center
of academia that it is.
Housing difficulties have long
deterred top prospective graduate
students from choosing Stanford — a
situation that neither administrators
nor students want.
This decision, consistent with the
idea of Stanford being a "world-class
institution," shows that the adminis
tration is concerned about the caliber
of treatment of its graduate students.
A year ago, we stated in an edito
rial that the University "needs to
fundamentally change the way it
approaches the graduate housing cri
sis."
We criticized the University's
actions, or lack thereof, in response
to the problem.
These recent plans prove that the
University has changed its ways, and
there is no sign that the change will
end anytime soon.
We applaud Rice and the adminis
trators for their commitment to their
students and encourage them to con
tinue their efforts in the months and
years ahead.
