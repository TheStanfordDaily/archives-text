# Breathing Lessons
## The
						anatomy of our grief 
### 
April van Scherpe

First, you will
be born. You will
cry and wail and
squirm — and sleep, if
your parents are lucky.
Eventually, you will learn
to listen, and listening will
teach you that you can
expect to grow and to die.

Somewhere between the two, you will learn
to lose.
Hopefully, life will let you take it slowly,
so that only after you have lost your best
lunch box and your keys and your dry
cleaning slip and three $20 bills and most
games of chess you have played will you
lose a person.
You will be struck suddenly with it,
"blindside[d|," in Mary Schmich's words,
by the news "at 4 p.m. on some idle rues
day."
You will watch time, for a split second,
stand completely still.
You will collapse promptly. It will hap
pen when the first small sliver of a glacial
revelation melts in. You will collapse next
to the phone, or on the bus or, if your life is
cued well, in the darkness of a torrent of
rain. You might even throw up in the
kitchen sink.
You will pace a little, eyes stained like
pomegranates and vision oddly hlurrv. or
you will sit motionless in the corner of
some dimly lit room watching dust particles
fall through a shaft of light. You will rock
yourself into exhaustion at 5 a.m. and wake
up seven hours later in 16 moments of bliss
ful ignorance. Then you will realize that the
thickly deceiving dream was instead a
chaos that, 1,200 minutes ago, changed

your life forever. You will obsessively
count everything. And you will he unable
to go back to sleep.
You will panic. You will wrench words
from your mouth compulsively, as if chant
ing "I'm so sorry" or "I'his is not happen
ing" casts some reversing spell. You will
grasp at any shards of anger because they
are more manageable than fear, but you
will feel clenching in your throat and not
your fists. You will feel hot tears salivating
like liquid iron down your nose. You will
feel sobs that take up your whole face in
their coming. You will feel hands squeez
ing your shoulders more often than usual.
You will feel your bed grow fluffy with
Kleenex.
You will feel nothing. You will feel
numb. You will watch the day pass like it is
the span of a year. Birds will head south
ward slowly, as through a sky made of glue,
and you will notice such details intently,
like an unimpressed movie critic notices
microphones dip into a scene — silently
and from a distance. You will be prompted
to play basketball in the rain. Heinous wind
will strafe over your face and the basketball
will slap tiny rows of muddy dots across
your T-shirt. It is possible that, as the ball
taps away from a dejected puddle, you will
notice the sound of a wet basketball in the
afternoon: pain, pain, pain, pain.
You will be reminded of your lost per
son by everything and everyone. From far
away, you will hear advice resonating
through you like you are the vacant apart
ment or the box about to be filled with
mementos. Mostly you will hear "time
heals all wounds" or "your hurt will fade
over time." You will smile briefly at the bit

ter sarcasm in your head: Hey, that's it.
Maybe my feelings can die! Sign me up!
You will wonder quizzically when the last
time that you smiled was.
"Dammit" will encompass your senti
ments perfectly. You will scream it and
shout it and bawl it and darkly enjoy the
way that it bounces off of hallways. You
will wait for people to leave so that you can
be alone with the damned unfairness. You
will wonder if, somewhere, your loved one
knows you are doing this.
You will come to realize that losing your
loved ones is hard and not having them is
terrible and thinking about them is harder
still, but the prospect of forgetting is horrif
ic. Something underneath your rib cage will
groan a little at the thought that one day
you won't recall enough to hurt anymore.
You will move from a stage of wanting
never to forget anything to desperately
wanting to forget everything to forgetting
some things to wishing you could remem
ber anything at all.
You will start to come around. You will
stop counting days. You will discover with
patient satisfaction that although there was
a time when you couldn't remember the
smell of your favorite person without chok
ing up. that time is not now. You will open
the bottle of cologne in your top dresser
drawer, smell it and sit quietly for a
moment. •
You will dust yourself off and remember
in the vaguest way what some person long
ago told you about time. You will realize
that life can improve you in your grief.
