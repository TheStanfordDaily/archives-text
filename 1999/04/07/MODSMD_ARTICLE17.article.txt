Bookstore is not for sale
Several stories and letters in The Daily
have recently suggested that the Stanford
Bookstore is "for sale." That is emphati
cally not the case.
The Stanford University Bookstore is
not for sale.
What is true is that the Bookstore's
Directors are currently examining the pos
sibility of entering into a management
agreement with an outside contractor.

'Piercing 9 got offensive
I am hoping that mine is one of many
notes you will receive regarding your arti
cle from Monday, "Body Piercings, Tat
toos Grow More Common."
I am astounded that you would publish
the article in such an expository way.
In a time when awful crimes against
women are occurring with scary frequency
— the recent Yosemite murders of three
innocent women and Christina Williams'
brutal murder in Monterey County — and
with so many predators at large, how
could you expose Keziah Robinson by
quoting every word she uttered (apparent
ly without thinking seriously before
hand)?
I am personally an extremely open
minded person, but as we live in a world

where added caution has become such an
important part of life, I am offended by
your lack of sensitivity.
1 could go on writing, but 1 hope to
have gotten my point across.
I remain in disbelief and anger —
another displeased reader.

It's hot in here!
I enjoyed your recent article exposing
the desperate need for upgraded medical
classroom and library space.
One minor correction: The only air
conditioning in the library is for the rare
books and archives. Believe me, the Lane
Library staff do not experience anything
as luxurious as air-conditioning.
We did finally bring in portable units
last summer when we were unable to open
any windows due to a painting project in
the central courtyard.
Even with these blowers, my cubicle
registered over 1 (K) degrees on several
occasions!
We are all looking forward to upgraded
facilities so we can better serve our medi
cal students and the Stanford community
at large.
Thanks for the press on this important
issue.
