# The 						Present Tense
## Defining and defying Kosovo's gray zone

THE FIRST TIME I was introduced
to the Holocaust as a concrete
occurrence. I was in my Sunday
school classroom. My teacher showed us a
documentary about the liberation of the
concentration camps.
1 he image of bulldozers churning the
mountains of tangled, stripped human
corpses plays over and over in my mind.
The aftermath of the apocalypse is cap
tured in that moment, written in the indeli
ble ink of horrified, violated passion. Few
third-graders can see the theoretical opti
mism behind the release of the emaciated.
They see the gray skin, pointy cheekbones,
sunken eyes.
Government-sponsored extermination
does not bounce lightly off of a child's
character. For several years, I would go to
bed only to dream of Nazis. Nazis in the
schoolyard, my backyard, my home. Chas
ing me everywhere and, what was worse,
chasing my family. We buried ourselves in
the sandbox and hid ourselves in our
neighbors' basements. 1 always woke up
just as they caught up to us with their guns
and their needles full of poison.

"Never again." I swore to myself. And
my classmates, my teachers, my newspa
pers. my government, my country swore
the same.
"History repeats itself," we said. "But
now that we know, we will be ready. This
time we will bomb the railroad tracks."
Today, in Kosovo, genocide sneaks for
ward once again. For the past two weeks,
headlines have leapt out at us in a united,
fiery scream. Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic has implemented a policy of
"cleansing" Kosovo of the ethnic Albani
ans who comprise 90 percent of its 2 mil
lion inhabitants. According to various
Western agencies, between 300,(XX) and
315,(KM) people have fled the province. Ser
bian authorities are using passenger trains
to transport thousands more to the Mace
donian border.
Eyewitness accounts are horrifying the
world. One man told Human Rights
Watch: "There were about KM) of us on the
bus. packed in. There were soldiers on the
sides of the road and armored personnel
carriers parked all around as well. Some of
the soldiers started pointing at people:

'You, you and you. get off the bus.' They
took them about 10 to 15 meters away, out
of sight. We heard shooting. They were all
young boys.... When we drove past, I saw
blood on the road. There were soldiers all
around."
I have agonized over how to understand
Kosovo.
"Why don't you write a column about
how genocide is unacceptable, no matter
what?" my father suggested. Yes ... but.
no, I said, it no longer seems so simple.
Because 1 have begun to grasp the twisted
tragic history that has been transcribed
during my own lifetime, and it has made
me distrust my government's motivations.
While I once knew Uncle Sam to be the
liberator of concentration camps, I now
understand him to be the perpetrator of
great crimes against humanity.
U.S. involvement in the Central Ameri
can civil wars in the fight against "commu
nism" killed 80.000 Salvadorans and
2()0.(KX) Guatemalans. As we stood wring
ing our hands because there was "no solu
tion," 500,000 people died in Bosnia. Our
starvation of the people of Iraq "to oust

Saddam" is an ongoing campaign which
has already claimed the lives of more than
a million Iraqi children. And Rwanda, as
recent reports have indicated, was more
than a tragic genocide that left half a mil
lion dead. It was a politically expedient
decision.
"The Americans were interested in sav
ing money, the Belgians were interested in
saving face and the French were interested
in saving their ally, the genocidal govern
ment." said Alison Des Forges, the author
of a study on the Rwandan genocide. "All
of that took priority over saving lives."
"Liberty and justice for all" in Kosovo
tastes sourly ironic in the context of this
history. The recent bombings have had
dual agendas. After failing to persuade him
at the negotiating table, NATO wants
Milosevic out of power. But it also wants to
have a favorable global standing when it
celebrates its 50th anniversary next year.
The dual effects of the bombings have
been the solidification of Milosevic's posi
tion in Serbia and the acceleration of the
process of ethnic cleansing.
In Kosovo, people are being loaded into

freight trains (Germany, 1941), pulled off
buses and shot (El Salvador, 1982), pushed
off their lands in a thousand-mile forced
march (United States of America, Trail of
, Tears, 1838) and purposefully denied food
and medicine (Iraq, 1999). We must inter
vene on their behalf.
Genocide is unacceptable, no matter
what.
But we must take care with our political
motivations and our methodology. In our
fight for human rights we have napalmed
Central America, starved Iraq and over
looked Rwanda.
As Jean-Baptiste Kayigambe,
spokesman for a Tutsi survivors' associa
tion in Rwanda, asks: "Why didn't any
body help us? What made our case differ
ent from that of Kosovo today, apart from
the fact that our dead were black and not
white like the Albanian victims? We were
Africa's Kosovo, and the world turned its
eyes away."
And we must ask ourselves why.
