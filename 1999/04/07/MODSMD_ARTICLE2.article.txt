# New affiliation
## Groups added to Haas 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
The Hans Center selected six
new organi/ntions to join its 34 af
filiated student service groups.
The six groups, which were cho
sen out of 10 applicants, are the
EPA Charter School Science En
richment Program. Henry's Place.
Stanford Advocates for Children.
SAT Succcss. Women and Youth
Supporting Each ()ther and Young
at Heart.
The affiliated groups receive ac
cess to the Haas resources, includ
ing advisers, and become part of the
service learning community, ac
cording to Mark Delucehi. a stu
dent service officer at the center.
Affiliated groups also get help

with the logistical details of running
a organization — a mailbox, file
space, desk space, meeting rooms,
and use of a photocopier and fax
machine.
Jackie Schmidt-Posner, assistant
director for student development,
said. "It's hard to run a groupout of
your dorm room alone. Groups be
come part of a community of like
minded people with opportunities
such as workshops, training, activi
ties and allocated places they can
work."
The addition of the new groups
builds their contact with the center,
and the peer advisers who work
with potential volunteers can better
recommend these groups to stu
dents.
Sophomore Alexis Kaminski.

director of Stanford Advocates for
Children, said her group works to
"educate the Stanford population
about new pieces of legislation af
fecting children." She said affilia
tion is important, because it offers
"a great support network, and it's a
really great feeling to be part of a
large community."
"We can learn a lot from other
groups: they can share what they've
learned with u5.... Peer advisers
can give advice on how to be
stronger and more efficient," she
said.
Sophomore Alan Teo, co-presi
dent of SAT Success, an organiza
tion that prepares college bound
students for the SA T, terms affilia
tion a "mutual benefit."
"The Haas Center is really well
known as the focal point of commu
nity service projects," and it is "use
ful for us to have someone on the
Haas Center staff act as a mentor
directly," he said.
The process of affiliation is orga
nized by the House Unifying
Board, which consists of five se
niors who have experience in vari
ous aspects of the center.
"We know both sides. We make

sure the groups are responsible and
offer public service education for
Stanford students, and there is a
need being addressed," senior
Edith Wu of HUB said.
The student-run affiliation
process is an example of the unique
role students play at the center.
"Haas is on the forefront of public
service on college campuses. We're
really lucky." Wu said.
"The cool thing is that the Haas
provides student groups entirely
run by students... which is a really
great learning experience."
The process begins with an ap
plication that asks for description

of the group's mission, goals and
structure and a letter of support
from their community partner, "so
we know there is a strong relation
ship with the community and the
group cares about it," said Deluc
chi.
"It also asks why they want to be
affiliated. What can you con
tribute? How can you better fulfill
our mission as a center? How can
we build a stronger community
here?" Delucchi added.
Then the groups are interviewed
by a member of HUB, a staff per
son and a member of an affiliated
group.
