### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
The Hans Center selected six
new organi/ntions to join its 34 af
filiated student service groups.
The six groups, which were cho
sen out of 10 applicants, are the
EPA Charter School Science En
richment Program. Henry's Place.
Stanford Advocates for Children.
SAT Succcss. Women and Youth
Supporting Each ()ther and Young
at Heart.
The affiliated groups receive ac
cess to the Haas resources, includ

service learning community, ac

Affiliated groups also get help

with the logistical details of running
a organization â€” a mailbox, file
space, desk space, meeting rooms,
and use of a photocopier and fax
machine.
Jackie Schmidt-Posner, assistant
director for student development,

and the peer advisers who work
with potential volunteers can better
recommend these groups to stu
dents.

"a great support network, and it's a
really great feeling to be part of a
large community."
"We can learn a lot from other
groups: they can share what they've
learned with u5.... Peer advisers
can give advice on how to be
stronger and more efficient," she
said.
