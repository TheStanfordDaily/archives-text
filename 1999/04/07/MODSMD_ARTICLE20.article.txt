## Study raises new hopes for weight control Mouse gene alters activity and appetite 
### Ryan Chuang Contributing writer 
Ever wish for a better weight
loss method?
For many years, researchers
have tried to find genes that con
trol weight to answer that question.
Understanding of how such genes
work could lead to therapies that
combat diseases such as obesity.
Scientists in Dr. Gregory Barsh's
lab in the Genetics Department
recently located one such gene,
mahogany, in mice.
Researchers from Barsh's lab, in
collaboration with Biochemistry
Prof. Ronald Davis and scientists
from the Dana Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston, found that mice
lacking a functional mahogany
gene eat and exercise more than
normal.
"The mutation interferes with
both metabolism and feeding
behavior," Barsh said. "Sometimes
the mice gain weight and some
times they lose a little bit of weight,
depending on whether overeating
is greater than increased activity."
Currently, researchers are
unsure whether the overeating
causes the mice's increased activity,
whether the greater activity causes
excessive eating or even if the two
behaviors are related at all.
"It may be that they [overeating
and increased activity] just happen
separately but concurrently,"

Barsh said.
The problem of understanding
mahogany's role gets even more
complicated when considering the
mouse mahogany gene's human
relation.
The predicted protein encoded
by the mahogany gene is made up
1,428 amino acids.
One part of this protein — the
extracellular domain — is 93 per
cent identical to the human protein
attractin, whose discovery was
reported last September by Dr.
Jonathan Duke-Cohan and col
leagues in the Schlossman lab at
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.
In humans, attractin helps
spread monocytes that later
become the focus point for nonpro
liferating T lymphocytes clustering,
an essential reaction from the
body's defense system.
Researchers had little reason at
first to suspect any relation
between the mouse mahogany and
human attractin proteins.
Activated T cells in humans pro
duce the attractin proteins which
circulate freely within human
blood, while mahogany protein
appears to be anchored within the
membrane of mouse cells.
However. further study
revealed that there are actually two
forms of the human attractin pro
tein — the aforementioned circu
lating protein and a second mem
brane-bound form nearlv identical

to the mouse mahogany protein.
This unexpected similarity
caused the researchers to look for
the connection between the mouse
mahogany protein, which they had
linked to weight control, and the
human attractin protein, which the
Boston group had connected with
the immune system.
"We have been working togeth
er with Jonathan Duke-Cohan's
group to try and understand the
possible connection between regu
lation of body weight and immune
function," Barsh said.
Many different mice tissues,
including pigment cells of the skin
and the hypothalamus in the brain,
express the mahogany protein.
The large mahogany protein is a
single transmembrane-domain pro
tein and has an external portion
which is characteristic of a protein
receptor.
The receptor part can bind pass
ing molecules and then start a sig
nal cascade to transmit information
inside a cell.
Researchers in the Barsh lab
believe that the mahogany protein
may help another mouse protein,
agouti, bind to the cell surface.
Mutations in agouti mostly
cause changes in hair color of mice,
but rare types of agouti mutations,
such as lethal yellow, cause a multi
tude of effects, including a yellow
coat color, increased growth rate,
immune defects and huge obesity

in these special mutant mice.
A mutation in the mahogany
gene can suppress the effects of the
lethal yellow allele of the agouti
gene on pigmentation and body
weight.
Currently, the Barsh team
believes that the natural mahogany
protein teams up with another hor
mone receptor to send signals into
the cell because the portion of the
mahogany protein protruding into
the cell seems too short to effec

tively transmit information on its
own. The hormone
receptor to which mahogany
appears to bind in mice seems to be
the same receptor that attractin
binds in order to police interactions
between cells of the immune sys
tem.
However, the researchers are
still unsure about how the abnor
mal mahogany protein in mice is
causing the appetite and activity
abnormalities.

Barsh cautions that the
mahogany protein is only one of
many players in an extremely com
plex molecular dance and that
many of the complicated interac
tions have yet to be discovered.
Much more study is needed in
this subject, but it is not hard to
imagine that some people who suf
fer from obesity may have muta
tions in the mahogany-like
attractin gene or other weight-con
trol genes.

The mouse on the right lacks the mahogany gene, leading to excessive eating and exercising, which
can cause either weight gain or loss. The mouse on the left is normal.
