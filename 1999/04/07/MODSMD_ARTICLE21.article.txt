# Studying the path of sperm after a vasectomy
## Bug uncovers truth of the 'tying of the tubes' 
### Garth Patil Contributing writer 
(J: When a man has a vasectomy do
doctors literally "tie" his tubes, or is
that just a figure of speech * And
after the vasectomy, where do the
sperm go when he ejaculates?
A: Another sexual health question?
Folks, there's more to science
than just sex.
For those of you who aren't quite
up to speed yet. let's start off with
definitions. When ejaculation occurs,
sperm that is produced in the testes
and stored in the epididymis Hows
through the vas deferens to the
prostate, where it is mixed with an
alkaline fluid and then discharged
from the body through the urethra.
A vasectomy is a surgical proce
dure where the vas deferens is cut
and then closed to prohibit sperm
produced in the testes from entering
the prostate and leaving the body
through the penis during ejaculation.
More than S(X),(MX) vasectomy
procedures are done each year in the
United States alone. Vasectomy is a
simple, safe surgical procedure for
permanent male fertility control.
The procedure usually takes about
15 to 20 minutes. Since the proce
dure simply interrupts the delivery of
sperm, it does not change hormonal
function â€” leaving sexual drive and
potency unaffected.
A vasectomy leaves the patient
unchanged except for the fact that
the sperm cord (vas) is blocked. The
level of male hormones remains the
same and all sexual characteristics
remain the same. The patient's abili
ty to have an erection is also com
pletely unchanged.
There are various methods for
the actual closure of the vas tubes
once they have been cut. In the ear
lier days of the procedure the scro
tum was opened, the vas tubes were
cut and then a clamp or suture was
placed on the open ends to seal
them.
While there is no procedure

where the vas tubes are literally just
tied, the action of stitching the cut
ends is probably where the phrase
"he's had his tubes tied" came
from.
More recent procedures are less
invasive and don't require the scro
tum to be opened beyond a minor
hole. The no-scalpel vasectomy uses
a small puncture wound done with a
sharp instrument under local anes
thesia to make the skin incision. The
vas deferens is cut and then cauter
ized. The energy used to cauterize
the vas tube itself is electrical
cautery. In some cases the cautery
can also be done with a laser. A laser
simply uses light energy to create

heat and do the same thing that the
electrical energy would do.
Since the function of the testes is
unaffected by a vasectomy, they con
tinue to produce sperm. But there is
nowhere for the sperm to go. right?
The vas deferens is severed so that
sperm can no longer pass into the
prostate, but production itself is
unaffected by vasectomy. What hap
pens to the sperm is the same thing
that happens to a man who hasn't
had a vasectomy. Without regular
ejaculation, because of sexual inac
tivity or vasectomy, the sperm that
are stored in the epididymis eventu
ally die and are absorbed into the
bloodstream.
