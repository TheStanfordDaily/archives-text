## Trying to overcome the effects of jet lag 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
A week after arriving hack at
Stanford following Spring Break
in London, I woke up to total
darkness. I reached for my alarm
clock — 4 a.m. Again.
Flying west across eight time
zones can be a real nightmare. I
don't have as much trouble going
east, where the time is one hour
later for each zone crossed. One
very long day, a good night's
sleep, then it's back to normal.
But flying back to Stanford invari
ably means a full week of early
morning awakenings and after
noons spent stumbling about like
a bleary-eyed sleepwalker.
It doesn't take a genius to fig
ure out that human beings were
not designed to travel half the
globe in less than half a day. It all
comes down to what researchers
call our circadian rhythms — our
body clocks — that regulate pat
terns like sleeping and eating.
The rhythms of the human
body clock are not fully known,
according to a recent article in
The Lancet. But the light/dark
cycle and times of eating are defi
nitely part of that rhythm, among
other factors.
So when you cross more than
three time zones, your internal
rhythm is off balance. If you're
staying at your destination for a
short time (less than three days),
researchers recommend that you
try to maintain your normal
rhythm. But if you're staying
longer, you will have to adjust,
and that's when you start experi
encing the symptoms of jet lag.
These include fatigue, inability
to sleep at the new bedtime, irri
tability, loss of concentration and

some gastrointestinal disorders
like indigestion or loss of appetite.
Research on jet lag shows that
most people experience worse
symptoms when they travel cast. I
guess that puts me in the minority.
But what explains such a discrep
ancy?
According to Assoc. Psychiatry
Prof. Dale Edgar at the Sleep Dis
orders and Research Center, it
comes down to individual factors
or what he calls the "genetically
hardwired properties of the
human circadian clock."
But he says the majority of
people find it easier to travel west
because they're not trying to sleep
when their body clock is in
"awake" mode. "It may simply be
possible to reset the human clock
easier by phase delay (westward
travel) than by phase advance
(eastward travel)," Edgar said.
"Travelling from San Francisco
to New York, for example, if we
arrive at 11 p.m., the locals are
going to bed. but our clock thinks
it is still 8 p.m. At the hours of 7 to
9 p.m. the human circadian clock's
wake-up alarm is ringing quite
loud, making it difficult for all but
the very sleep-deprived to fall
asleep at these times."
The problems associated with
jet lag can have tangible impacts.
Because of my jet lag, 1 had an
awkward start to spring quarter. 1
was getting lots of reading done
(after all, what else is there to do
at 4 a.m.), but my professors were
beginning to wonder why I'd sud
denly become tired and clumsy.
People travelling for business or
sports competitions also find that
they can't perform at their peak.
Researchers arc looking for
ways to "cure" jet lag by treating
its symptoms. A controversial new

practice is the taking of melatonin
supplements. Melatonin is a hor
mone produced by the pineal
gland, which is located in the cen
ter of the head. Roughly the size
of a pea, the gland is thought to be
central to the maintenance of cir
cadian rhythms.
Melatonin release in the body
is triggered by darkness but inhib
ited by light. Taking a melatonin
supplement is supposed to help
your body adapt faster to the new
time zone.
But research findings about the
benefits of melatonin are inconsis
tent. Edgar said that a National
Institues of Health counsel issued
a public advisory stating that too
little is known about the effects of
melatonin to justify widespread
use.
"I do not recommend its use at
this time, because I am not con
vinced that there are adequate
safety data available," Edgar said.
"With this said, several of my
friends have performed elegant
studies of melatonin, and I am
convinced the hormone can sys
tematically influence the human
circadian clock. However, the
benefits are generally modest
when compared to non-pharma
cological techniques like getting
or avoiding bright light at the
appropriate times of day."
Most of the advice about beat
ing jet lag is of the tried and true
variety.
That means trying to adjust
your body to the new time zone a
few days before you go. On the
flight, you should try to eat and
sleep according to the time of
your destination, drink lots of
water and bypass the free alcohol,
which only adds to the dehydrat
ing effects of flying.
