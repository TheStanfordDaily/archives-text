## Doubles start winning trend Cardinal defeat of Golden Bears boosts confidence 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
The No. 4 men's tennis team

bounced back from its toughest
weekend of the year by handily de
feating the California Golden
Bears (6-8, 1-6 Pacific 10 Confer-

ence) 6-1 yesterday afternoon at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
The Cardinal (13-2, 4-1) finally
put its doubles play together by

winning all three of its matches to
take the doubles point and went on
to win five out of its six singles
matches as well.
It was precisely the kind of con
fidence-building match the Cardi
nal needed as it now heads into a
weekend where it will play both
Arizona and Arizona State.

■ Yesterday: No. 3 Stanford (13-2,4-
1 Pacific 10 Conference) 6, Califor
nia (6-8,1-6) 1.

"It was a nice solid effort by
everyone," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "Our doubles
picked it up nicely and after that we
didn't let up at all in the singles."
The Cardinal tried a different
doubles lineup in the match as ju
nior David Hauser replaced sopho
more Ali Ansari to play at the No.
3 doubles spot with sophomore
Scotty Scott.
In addition, the No. 1 and No. 2
teams switched places in the lineup.
Both changes seemed to work to
the Cardinal's advantage.
Hauser stepped in very nicely as
he and Scott defeated David Tzou
and Chris Louis of Cal, 8-3.
Hauser served extremely well
and was able to make his returns
and first volleys. He shook off his
nerves of playing in the stadium for
the first time and did everything
the coaches asked of him.
"1 was proud of David [Hauser]
today," said Stanford assistant
coach John Whitlinger. "It's not
easy to just step in the lineup and
perform the way he did. The key
was his serving and first volleys. He
did both very well which was nice
to see."
Junior Geoff Abrams and
sophomore Alex Kim stepped in at
the No. 1 doubles spot and defeat
ed Adrien Barnes and Chris Santo
zo, 8-5. Since Abrams and Kim
have been winning consistently at
the No. 2 doubles spot and because
the Cardinal lost the doubles point
to Cal last time, Gould figured a lit
tle change could not hurt.
Senior Ryan Wolters and fresh
man K.J. Hippensteel, currently
the sth-ranked doubles team in the
nation, played at the No. 2 spot and
defeated Cal's team of Kintz and

the No. 2 position, and his doubles match (with sophomore partner Alex Kim), in the No. 1 position.
Demetric, 9-7. Wolters and Hip
pensteel came out a little slowly hut
played well in the big points toward
the end.
Wolters also came out a hit slow
ly in his No. 1 singles match against
( al's Barnes. Barnes has been play
ing great tennis of late and came
out on lire to win the first set 6-4.
That set may have been just the
wakeup call Wolters needed, as he
raised his play to a completely new
level the next two sets and won
them both 6-1.
"Ryan [Wolters] was a bit flat at
the start and Barnes played like a
true No. I in the first set," Gould

said. "Ryan showed how tough of a
player he is by not letting it get him
down and instead using it to fire
him up for the next two sets. He
showed why he is our leader."
In addition to Wolters, Abrams
continued to play exceptional ten
nis.
Abrams beat Cal's No. 2 player
Chris Santozo 6-2, 6-2 in a match
where he was in complete control
from start to finish.
Abrams has been playing ex
tremely tough tennis for the Cardi
nal over the last month.
The only loss the Cardinal suf
fered was at the No. 6 singles spot
where Ansari was defeated. De
spite his loss, however, Ansari is
coming off a strong weekend of sin
gles and both coaches still have

complete confidence in him.
"Everyone has off days,"
Whitlinger said. "I am not worried
at all about Ali [AnsariJ at our No.
6 spot. He has been very consistent
all year and I know he will continue
to be as the season approaches its
end."
The Berkeley match was a per
fect opportunity for the Cardinal to
fiddle around with its doubles line
up and work on a few minor areas
of its singles play.
It would have been an easy
match to take lightly, especially
after a physically and emotionally
exhausting weekend in Los Ange
les.
Instead, the Cardinal played
with intensity and never let the
Bears have a chance.
