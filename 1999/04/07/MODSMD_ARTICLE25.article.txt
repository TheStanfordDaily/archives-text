# Homeyer and Keever in friendly competition
## 
### Ben Jones Contributing writer 
It all began at the Women's
Western Amateur. Their hotel
rooms were next door to each
other, and their families ate dinner
together. The next thing they knew
it was the end of the week, and they
were the only players left in the
hotel, set to square off in the tour
nament's final match.
For Stanford sophomores
Stephanie Keever and Hilary
Homeyer, the meeting was just the
beginning of a friendship that
would bring them to be next-door
neighbors again this year and at the
center of Stanford women's golf.
The duo has led the Cardinal to
eighth place in the national colle
giate golf rankings and looks to
make a strong showing as the team
prepares for the upcoming NCAA
Regionals and Championships.
The sophomore sensations
come from different backgrounds,
but their paths to Stanford have
been similar.
Playing in many of the same ju
nior golf tournaments growing up,
they knew of each other's abilities
before coming to the Farm. The
pair even went on a recruiting trip
to Duke at the same time along
with current sophomore teammate
Jessica Belskis.
Keever hails from the bright
lights of Las Vegas. Nev. A four
time all-state selection, she

amassed an impressive amateur
record that includes a trip to the
United States Golf Association
Women's Amateur Championship.
Homeyer on the other hand is
from Edina, Minn., a state where
Keever says, "golf is huge." Her
amateur golf record is equally stel
lar, punctuated by a win at the Min
nesota State Championship and a
trip to the round of 16 at the
Women's Amateur.
Each player has already had a
taste of golfs ultimate trophy, the
USGA Women's Open. Keever
qualified for the prestigious tourna
ment in 19% and remembers the
enormity of the event.
"1 usually never get nervous on
the course," she said, "and standing
on the first tee I had to remind my
self to breathe."
Homeyer, not to be outdone,
qualified for the tournament the
next year as the youngest player in
the field. She too remembers being
nervous and recalls an incident on
the putting green where she ended
up between LPGA superstars
Laura Davies and Annika Soren
stam and found herself in awe of
the whole situation.
Despite their numerous success
es and battle for the top spot on the
Cardinal squad, there is not a hint
of animosity between the pair ei

petition." Keever said, noting the
very similar abilities of both players.
The two are often paired together in
practice but draw strength from the
rivalry. "We feed off of each other."
Both Keever and Homeyer point
to the strength of not only their
friendship but the bond between all
the teammates.
"We all get along so well off the
course." Keever said, contrasting
the Stanford squad to others across

the nation who do not share the
same camaraderie.
The bond between the group ex
tends off the course as well.
"It was nice being able to talk to
gether about things like CIV and
writing class that have nothing do
with golf," Homeyer said.
The players both commented on
the team atmosphere speaking of
numerous team jokes and an infa
mous quote book which lists the ab
sentminded comments made by
team members.
Their recruiting class, which in
cludes teammates Lauren Robert
son and Belskis, has a unique oppor
tunity to spend four years together
comprising such a large part of the
team.
"We're looking forward to a
great four years together," Homeyer
said.
Those four years began with a
bang for both players last season.
Keever earned second team All-
America honors after finishing the
season with six top-10 and 11 top-15
finishes. She led the Cardinal with a
74.38 stroke average and was award
ed second team All Pacific 10 Con
ference honors on the basis of her
13th place finish in the Pac-10
Championships.
Homeyer enjoyed an equally suc
cessful freshman year, tallying a sec
ond best stroke average for Stanford
of 74.75 and garnering honorable
mention All-America recognition
with five top-10's and seven top-25's.
She did Keever one up, winning
first-team all Pac-10 accolades with
her tie for seventh place at six-over
par 222.
Both athletes' strong play has
carried over this year as well. After
returning from November arthro

scopic knee surgery that left her "not
MX) percent in the fall," Keever has
run up an impressive spring record.
Thus far, her accomplishments in
clude top-10 finishes at the
SMU/OSU Regional Challenge
Feb. 8-10 and the Rainbow/Wahine
Invitational played March 23-25.
Keever's play has boosted her to No.
8 in the national rankings.
Homeyer has also performed
solidly in the spring season. Ranked
18th in the nation, her record in
cludes several top-15 performances.
Despite their success, both play
ers realize that both they, and the
team, can play at a higher level.
"We aren't playing near our po
tential." Keever said. "11 we are
going to play well at nationals, the
whole team must put it together
every round."
Looking ahead past this year's
NCAA Championships and their
time at Stanford, both Homeyer and
Keever recognize the possibility of
professional golf careers. While
Keever, a sociology major, lists such
an accomplishment as her number
one priority, Homeyer is more hesi
tant, noting the rigors of week-in
week-out travel and play on the
LPGA tour. The economics and psy
chology major is keeping her options
open but is definitely not ruling out a
future in golf.
Given the way the two have per
formed this season and the potential
for success in their final two years,
the future looks bright for Keever
and Homeyer as well as Stanford
women's golf.
And.for good measure, it was
Keever that ended up winning the
Western Amateur final where the
two first met. Hut she insists that it
was a tinht match.

carried over this year as well. After
returning from November arthro

scopic knee surgery that left her "not
MX) percent in the fall," Keever has
run up an impressive spring record.
Thus far, her accomplishments in
clude top-10 finishes at the
SMU/OSU Regional Challenge
Feb. 8-10 and the Rainbow/Wahine
Invitational played March 23-25.
Keever's play has boosted her to No.
8 in the national rankings.
Homeyer has also performed
solidly in the spring season. Ranked
18th in the nation, her record in
cludes several top-15 performances.
Despite their success, both play
ers realize that both they, and the
team, can play at a higher level.
"We aren't playing near our po
tential." Keever said. "11 we are
going to play well at nationals, the
whole team must put it together
every round."
Looking ahead past this year's
NCAA Championships and their
time at Stanford, both Homeyer and
Keever recognize the possibility of
professional golf careers. While
Keever, a sociology major, lists such
an accomplishment as her number
one priority, Homeyer is more hesi
tant, noting the rigors of week-in
week-out travel and play on the
LPGA tour. The economics and psy
chology major is keeping her options
open but is definitely not ruling out a
future in golf.
Given the way the two have per
formed this season and the potential
for success in their final two years,
the future looks bright for Keever
and Homeyer as well as Stanford
women's golf.
And.for good measure, it was
Keever that ended up winning the
Western Amateur final where the
two first met. Hut she insists that it
was a tinht match.
