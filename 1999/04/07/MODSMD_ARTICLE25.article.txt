# Homeyer and Keever in friendly competition
## 
### Ben Jones Contributing writer 
It all began at the Women's
Western Amateur. Their hotel
rooms were next door to each
other, and their families ate dinner
together. The next thing they knew
it was the end of the week, and they
were the only players left in the
hotel, set to square off in the tour
nament's final match.
For Stanford sophomores
Stephanie Keever and Hilary
Homeyer, the meeting was just the
beginning of a friendship that
would bring them to be next-door
neighbors again this year and at the
center of Stanford women's golf.
The duo has led the Cardinal to
eighth place in the national colle
giate golf rankings and looks to
make a strong showing as the team
prepares for the upcoming NCAA
Regionals and Championships.
The sophomore sensations
come from different backgrounds,
but their paths to Stanford have
been similar.
Playing in many of the same ju
nior golf tournaments growing up,
they knew of each other's abilities
before coming to the Farm. The
pair even went on a recruiting trip
to Duke at the same time along
with current sophomore teammate
Jessica Belskis.
Keever hails from the bright
lights of Las Vegas. Nev. A four
time all-state selection, she

amassed an impressive amateur
record that includes a trip to the
United States Golf Association
Women's Amateur Championship.
Homeyer on the other hand is
from Edina, Minn., a state where
Keever says, "golf is huge." Her
amateur golf record is equally stel
lar, punctuated by a win at the Min
nesota State Championship and a
trip to the round of 16 at the
Women's Amateur.
Each player has already had a
taste of golfs ultimate trophy, the
USGA Women's Open. Keever
qualified for the prestigious tourna
ment in 19% and remembers the
enormity of the event.
"1 usually never get nervous on
the course," she said, "and standing
on the first tee I had to remind my
self to breathe."
Homeyer, not to be outdone,
qualified for the tournament the
next year as the youngest player in
the field. She too remembers being
nervous and recalls an incident on
the putting green where she ended
up between LPGA superstars
Laura Davies and Annika Soren
stam and found herself in awe of
the whole situation.
Despite their numerous success
es and battle for the top spot on the
Cardinal squad, there is not a hint
of animosity between the pair ei
ther on the course or off.
