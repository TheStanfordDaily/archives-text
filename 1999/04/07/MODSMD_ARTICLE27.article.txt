# Ruggers into Sweet 16
## Women could repeat as champs

Women's Rugby
The Cardinal earned a berth in
this year's Sweet 16 as it was domi
nant from start to finish last week
end's play.
On Saturday, Stanford faced
Oregon State, defeating the Beavers
27-0. Although Stanford was playing
into the wind in the first half, the
team kept a fired-up Beaver squad
without a goal. With the wind at its
back in the second half, the Cardinal
scored all its points, running over a
tired Oregon State team.
Stanford played Chico State on
Sunday, a team that was out for
blood after the Cardinal had taken
the teams' regular season contest.
Chico State was able to go up 5-3 on
a try, and Stanford was down for the
first time this season in league play.
After early mental lapses, the
Cardinal took over, finishing the
game strong with a 33-10 victory.
Men's and Women's Ultimate
Both the men's and women's
teams played at The April Fool's
Tournament on April 3-4, an open
contest mainly for non-collegiate
squads.
The men tacked up two victories,
taking the rug out from under Hum
bolt State and Santa Cruz B. The
wins were important for a Cardinal
team that is as inexperienced as it is
talented.
"We're a young team," said se
nior Omer Atesmen. "It is inipor
tant that our younger players devel
op before Nationals because their
play is critical to the team's success."
For the women, Santa Cruz was
the only other college team, and the
Banana Slugs were easily disposed
of before the Cardinal faced the
Heat Baggettes, a non-collegiate

team that went on to handily win the
tournament.
"Overall, we're feeling good
about the season but have been
threatened enough to know that
we're going to have to work hard to
get where we want to go." said se
nior Mary Hunt Martin.
Men's Rugby
Sunday saw heartbreak for the
Cardinal, as it lost to Oregon State in
overtime, 38-22.
The conditions were classically
destructive, with rain turning the
field into a muddy slop usually re
served for pig sties. Stanford and
Oregon State went back and forth
throughout the game, with the score
tied at 17 as the clock stopped.

Oregon State came out strong in
overtime, breaking the back of the
Cardinal and taking away a chance
for Stanford to go to the Sweet 16.
Equestrian
The Stanford equestrian team
spent the weekend at UC-Davis,
competing for a chance to go to Na
tionals. After the hooves were at rest
and the dust cleared, only Cardinal
sophomore Bonnie Cole remained
standing.
Cole won in the Open Flats divi
sion, over a field that included some
of the best riders in the country.
While Cole's teammates may not be
packing their bags also, there were
many other solid rides throughout
the team.
