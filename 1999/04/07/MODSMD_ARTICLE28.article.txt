# Questions arise over Cowell
## 
### Michael Robert Fainelli 
()n a Saturday morning early last
month, senior Erica (Jielow woke up
experiencing chest pains and diffi
culty breathing. A doctor at Cowell
Student Health Center diagnosed
her with sore muscles and sent her
home; (iielow telephoned another
("owe 11 doctor in the evening and re
ceived the same diagnosis. I'wodays
later on a second visit to Cowell, a
doctor X-rayed her chest and discov
ered a collapsed lung, at which point
(Jielow was hospitalized for surgery.
Although this story is true. Uni
versity officials insist that Cowell
typically provides quality service.
Cowell Director Ira Friedman
said that the clinic provides excellent
care to the Stanford community. He
said there is no pattern of poor med
ical treatment, and when students do
complain he said "we look into each
instance individually, thoroughly
and confidentially."
Members of the Cowell medical
staff said that they listen carefully to
each ill student who comes into the
clinic. ( arolyn Fox, a nurse practi
tioner and assistant director for
medical affairs, said she always tries
to ascertain if her patient is satisfied.
"This is my diagnosis, this is your
treatment plan, are you comfortable
with this?" she asks each patient at
the end of a consultation.
Still, rumors of Gielow's col
lapsed lung have sent ripples of un
ease about the quality of care at
Cowell through the student body,
marring the already spotted reputa
tion of the clinic.

A Reputation Under Fire
There is little doubt that Cowell
Student I lealth Center is a common
target of barbs and snickers among
the Stanford community.
The clinic, which is the first stop
for students seeking non-emergency
medical treatment, was lampooned
in last fall's "Gaieties," in a skit por
traying an overzealous nurse. With
great vehemence, she insisted to a
moribund-looking patient, "You
have a cold! You're not fooling any
one."
Friedman's office regularly con
ducts surveys of the student body in
order to gauge satisfaction with the
variety of health services offered by
Cowell. Though he won't disclose
the numerical results. Friedman said
"students rate their satisfaction very
highly."
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya praises Friedman
for his sensitivity to student con
cerns. Montoya asserts that in his
own rapport with the undergraduate
body "Cowell does not come up in a
consistent way" when students voice
their grievances.
Some students criticize Cowell
for stinginess, saying that doctors are
reluctant to prescribe expensive
medical treatment, including x-rays
and referrals.
Danny Jacobs, who had to revisit
Cowell twice after a stress fracture
was misdiagnosed as a sprained
ankle, said he believes that doctors
at Cowell opt for less expensive tests
and procedures.
Not so. according to James Gam

ble, a doctor at Cowell. He said it is
easier for doctors at Cowell to order
tests than at any other HMOs he has
worked for."I spare no cost to do
what is right for the medical situa
tion." he said.
Praise from students
Many students are ready to laud
the service at the clinic. "I've heard a
lot of bad things about Cowell, but
from my personal experience, I have
no complaints whatsoever," said Jon
Mires, a sophomore.
While playing basketball last
March, he knocked heads with an
other player and went to Cowell for
six stitches. "1 was really pleased
with the care there. I barely even
have a scar from what appeared to
be a pretty deep cut."
Kyle Harrison, a student at the
Medical School, brings his expertise
when he visits Cowell as a patient.
"For the most part they provide
good care," he said of the staff that
treated him for back injury. A grad
uate of the University of Arkansas,
he said that many other student
health centers in the United States
also catch flak from the student
body. In his experience, Cowell is
"on par with student health clinics
[at other universities], though they
have a bad reputation."
Friedman agreed that Cowell
stands evenly with similar medical
institutions. "The numbers of com
plaints we get from students is simi
lar to the numbers at other compara
ble clinics, both student health and
general primary care clinics," he
said.
