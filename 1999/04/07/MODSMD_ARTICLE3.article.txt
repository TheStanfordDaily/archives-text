Sean Lucy was unanimously ap
proved as the new ASSU associate fi
nancial manager at last night's senate
meeting.
Lucy "demonstrated superior skill
and qualification for the position,"
according to the bill that nominated
him.
In his years at Stanford, Lucy
served as a 1999 co-editor in chief of
the Stanford Chaparral, 1998 projects
director and internal auditor at SSE
and the 1997 Theta Xi Rush chair
man.
Financial Manager Matt Garling
house, ASSU President Maren Nor
ton. Undergraduate Senator David
Searle and Graduate Senator John
Mills formed the committee that se
lected Lucy.
They conducted "extensive cam
pus-wide advertising, then inter
viewed qualified candidates," ac

cording to tl 'j hill. Four candidates
made it to the second round of inter
views. two to the final round.
In addition to interviews, candi
dates had to submit a resume and
complete a detailed application.
Lucy was selected after extensive
debate, as he "stood out far and

above the other candidates," Gar
linghouse said.
Lucy's involvement with the
Chaparral gave him experience with
ASSU banking, and his work with
SSE projects made him extremely
qualified for the position, according
to Searle.
At the end of the quarter the sen
ate will vote to approve him to take
over as financial manager for the
1 999-2000 school year, and Lucy will
replace Matt Garlinghouse in late
June, the end of this fiscal year.
In addition to Lucy's nomination,
the senate discussed a hill that en
courages the University to alter its
investment policies.
A bill titled "To Support the Ef
forts of the Advisory Panel on In
vestment Responsibility" sparked a
great deal of debate, but it eventual
ly passed by a two-thirds majority.
The proposal was written in re
sponse to a petition signed by more
than S(X) students, which called for
socially responsible investment of
Stanford's endowment.
The bill has three provisions. The
first is that "the ASSU Senate sup
ports the Advisory Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility on their adop
tion of the Policy on Shareholder
Resolutions Addressing Global Cli
mate Change." This policy was "pre
pared in an effort to inform Trustees
on investment responsibility issues,"
according to the bill.
Discussion of the issues around
socially responsible investing has
been sparked in part by Stanford's
investment in several companies
that are members of the Global Cli
mate Coalition. This is a group that,
according to the petitioners, funds a
misinformation campaign about
global warming.
The second provision "calls upon
the Stanford University Board of
Trustees to adopt the APIR's rec
ommended proposal and to facilitate
Stanford Management Company
consideration of social responsibility
in investment decisions."
The last provision is that the
ASSU encourages the Subcommit
tee on Investment Responsibility to
"have confidence in the APIR as a
representative of the Stanford com
munity."
