Barbara Allen Babcock, the first
woman to receive tenure at Stanford
I .aw School, has been named one of
the American Bar Association's
Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of
Achievement Award winners.
Babcock, along with four others,
will receive the award on Aug. Sin
Atlanta at a luncheon held in con
junction with the association's annu
al meeting.
"I was hoping that I would win it
someday; hut with these things you
don't know, because it's not some
thing you apply for. I don't know if
that's immodest, hut I was wishing
for it," Babcock said.
Her work has focused in large
part on the equality and progression
of women in the legal profession and
civil issues related to the criminally
accused.
"She's one of the sharpest voices
out there explaining why the work
defense lawyers do is a critical part
of our legal life," Assoc. Law Prof.
George Fisher said.
Before coming to Stanford in
1972, Babcock worked as a staff at
torney and director of the Public De
fender Service for the District of Co
lumbia. Once at Stanford she co
founded Equal Rights Advocates in
San Francisco, a group that was
started as a teaching law firm for
women.
It"was really the beginning of the
renewed women's legal movement,"
Babcock said.
The students of the firm worked
on actual cases lor an entire semes
ter, then presented simulations of

the cases to their class, putting them
on the cutting edge of what was then
"the newly evolving field of sex dis
crimination," according to Babcock.
Babcock also served as assistant
attorney general of the Civil Divi
sion of the U.S. Justice Department
from 1977 to 1979, while on leave
from Stanford.
"When I was at the Justice De
partment ... one of my jobs was to
identify women for judgeships."
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg "was one of those women.
She'd been passed over before, and I
worked to put her on the D.C. cir
cuit, which was the big stepping
stone to the Supreme Court," said
Babcock, illustrating part of the rea
son she won the Brent Award.
Babcock is currently working on
a biography of Clara Shortridge
Foltz, the first female lawyer on the
West Coast. Foltz, as Babcock put it,
"invented the publie defender" and.
among other notable achievements,
won a court case forcing Hastings
Law School in San Francisco to
admit women.
"She worked to help other
women, which is something that I've
tried to do from the beginning really.
That's what attracted me to her."
Babcock said of Foltz. In addition to
having written various law review
articles, Babcock is also the author
of two widely used casebooks.
Stanford colleagues Deborah
Rhode and Lisa Lindelef, with the
help of letters written by others from
across the nation, organized Bab
cock's nomination for the award.
"It's terrific that she's being rec
ognized for the leader she's been....

She's just been a tremendous inspi
ration for generations of law stu
dents," Law School Dean Paul Brest
said.
The Brent Award was estab
lished in 1991 by the American Bar
Association Commission on
Women in the Profession and has
been given annually since. It seeks to
recognize accomplished female
lawyers who have, according to the
commission, "not only achieved pro
fessional excellence, but have also
actively assisted in advancing oppor
tunities for other women lawyers."
The Commission on Women in
the Profession was founded to "se
cure the full and equal participation
of women in the ABA, the legal pro
fession and the justice system." First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton be
came the commission's first chair in
1987.
The award given by the commis
sion is named for Margaret Brent,
the first female lawyer of the United
States. Brent arrived in the Colonies
in 1638 and was involved in more
than 124 court cases over the next
eight years.
In 1648 she petitioned for female
citizen participation in the Maryland
assembly and was denied, beginning
a long historical fight by women for
equality in the legal profession.
Past recipients of the Margaret
Brent award include Bader Gins
burg. former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jor
dan (D-Tex.), Lani Guinier, Anita
Hill, former U.S. Rep. Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo.), Attorney
General Janet Reno and NAACP
Legal Defense and Education 112 und
Director Elaine Jones.
