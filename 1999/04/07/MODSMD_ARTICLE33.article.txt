With the confirmation of se
nior Sean Lucy as the new ASSU
financial manager at last night's
senate meeting. Matt Garling
house must say goodbye to the
position he has enjoyed for the
past year.

Garlinghouse, the current ASSU financial manag
er and CEO of Stanford Student Enterprises, has
three remaining months in his job as director of 200
employees and an organization with more than $8 mil
lion in total assets.
Garlinghouse reports a relatively calm year and, as
stocks are doing well, will leave the ASSU with a larg
er budget than when he took office. "Luckily we
haven't had a lot of problems," he said.
Memorable changes under his tenure include the
implementation of a new accounting system to solve
the year 2000 problem, the buying of a new digital,
$30,000 projector for Sunday Flicks and the creation
of a Stanford Store catalog which will soon be re

leased.
Included in his duties are overseeing SSE's
nesses. including Sunday Flicks, the Stanford Store
and the Stanford Directory; controlling the banking
and funding of the ASSU and managing the ASSU en
dowment.
Garlinghouse is saddest to leave his co-workers.
"What I have enjoyed most about my job are the bril
liant, fantastic people," he said.
ASSU President Maren Norton noted Garling
house's widespread involvement in the Stanford com
munity. "What made his Stanford experience was the
student groups he worked in.... His whole career was
spent in student activism, that's what motivates him,"
Norton said.
Before serving as financial manager Garlinghouse
ran the Stanford Directory and Sunday Flicks and
photo-edited for The Daily.
Garlinghouse, who plans to travel over the summer
and look for a job next fall, said the largest challenge
of being financial manager is the job's time frame. "It
is a one year position, and there is a tremendous
amount to learn," he said. "As soon as you get the
hang of it, you leave."
