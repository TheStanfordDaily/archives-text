## 
### Joe Cavanaugh Editorial staff 
Tom Wolfe, acclaimed author and
journalist made the first public ap
pearance of his spring stay at Stan
ford yesterday.
Clad in a blue blazer and cream
colored sweater-vest — a departure
from his signature white suit
Wolfe spoke for about 25 minutes in
Communication Prof. Ted Glaser's
journalistic ethics class, (Communica
tion 131.
The author of such acclaimed
novels as ' The Bonfire of the Vani
ties." "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid
lest," " The Right Stuff" and. most
recently. "A Man in Full" spoke
about journalistic accuracy and prob
lems encountered through the ethical

pursuits of writing.
Wolfe is spending the quarter as a
visiting scholar in the Communica
tion Department. Wolfe is on cam
pus to research his next hook.
The two main focuses of the short
speech were the accuracy he strived
for in"The Right Stuff" and"The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid lest." He
criticized the fictionalization of "The
Right Stuff" by Hollywood after he
sought to tell the true story of the as
tronauts battling for time in space in
the early years of NASA.
Swiping back his unkempt hair,
the man in white also commented on
the accuracy he tried to achieve in the
story of Ken Kesey and the Merry
Pranksters in"The Electric Kool-
Aid Acid lest," which brought the
hippie movement of Haight-Ash-

burv to the forefront of American
popular culture.
Wolfe recounted one of greatest
accuracy problems he encountered
while telling the tale of a the
Prankster's exploits. In a particularly
sensitive instance of the sexual as
sault and rape of a woman at a joint
party of the Pranksters and the Hell's
Angels, Wolfe decided against telling
the story using names instead of re
vealing the prominent people in
volved in the incident.
Upon Kesey's initial reading of
the novel, he criticized Wolfe for
being too nice and not treating the
issue more seriously. He complained
that Wolfe had glossed over the rape
and should have been more up front
about the actual details of the in
stance.
