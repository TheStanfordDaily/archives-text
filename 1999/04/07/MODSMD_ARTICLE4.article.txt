# On its way to students, consitutional amendment may reform ASSU, GSC
## 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
When students cast their votes
in the ASSU spring general elec
tion next week, one of the most im
portant decisions they will make is
whether to vote for or against the
constitutional amendment that
would create separate legislative
bodies for undergraduate and grad
uate students.
The amendment, titled "An

ASSU for all Students; Effective
Advocacy & Improved Program
ming." was written with the goal of
creating a student government that
would more effectively address
both undergraduate and graduate
student issues.
Possible changes
Under the amendment, the
ASSU would be of a 15-
member undergraduate Senate and
a 15-member Graduate Student
Council. This new GSC would as
sume a role beyond that filled by the
current GSC, which informally co
ordinates and represents graduate
concerns at Stanford. The new
council "would represent graduate
students in the same capacity that
the Undergraduate Senate serves its
population, but its structure would
be much more open and flexible."
The summary of the amendment
outlines the three main features of
the 43-page amendment.
The first is that the "proposal al
lows graduate and undergraduate
students to represent themselves in
the way that works best for each,"
according to the summary.
I he formation of an executive
committee allows the second fea
ture of the amendment: the facilita
tion of cooperation between the two
bodies.
I lie ASSIJ president and vice
president would be members of the
executive committee, along with the
ASSIJ financial manager and sever
al others.
This committee would coordi
nate the two bodies, making sure
that they "stay tied together and
don't go their separate ways," said
(iraduate Senator David Robinson,
chair of the ASSU's Administration
and Rules ( ommittee.
The executive committee would
also determine what issues are rele
vant for both bodies, calling joint
meetings when appropriate and
"fostering informal collaboration
between bodies."
I he president and vice president
would be members of both the un
dergraduate senate and the (»S(
T he third main aspect of the
amendment is its provision for "fair
use of programming resources."
Currently undergraduates pay 44
percent of the general lees, and
graduate students pay 56 percent,
according to ASSIJ Financial Man
ager Matt Garlinghouse.

Most of the fees, however, go to
support undergraduate program
ming. If the amendment passes,
graduate student fees would go to
support graduate student activities
only.
A new idea
The idea for the reorganization
of the ASSU "spontaneously arose
in a number of different places, in
response to a number of different
things." Robinson said.
There was some talk of restruc
turing over the summer and slightly
more in the fall, but it was at the start
of winter quarter that the idea
began to seriously take shape, ac
cording to Robinson.
ASSU President Maren Norton,
a senior; Vice President Santos
Marroquin, a junior; Senate Chair
Adam Weiss, a junior; Deputy Sen
ate Chair Mike Levin, a junior:
Robinson; (JSC Chair Harris
Shapiro, a doctoral student in
physics; and graduate senators
Hunter Tart and John Mills were
some of the people who originally
discussed the idea of creating the
amendment.
However it didn't take long for
"a lot of other people [to get) in
volved. including just about all ac
tive C iS(' people and a lot of current
and former senators and presi
dents." Robinson said.
CiSC matures
The GSC has done a great deal
for graduate students, and the
ASSU has done very little, Robin
son said. This year several social
events have been organized by the
GSC, and graduate students would
like to see more of them.
"This is a rich environment for
different types of people, but there
aren't opportunities [for grad stu
dents! to meet them." Robinson
said.
Graduate students and under
graduate students are in very differ
ent situations at Stanford; as Robin
son put it. graduate students are. in a
sense, employees of the University,

whereas undergraduates are eus
tomers. Graduate students face
problems that the ASSU neglects,
such as housing, stipends, taxes and
health care. A GSC written into the
constitution and given autonomy
could he better equipped to address
such problems.

'There is no doubt in my
mind that we did not send
the best amendment to the
students for their vote.'
— David Searle

Currently there is little commu
nication between the GSC and the
ASSU. The amendment allows for
joint meetings and joint commit
tees, and supporters of the bill feel
that those, in conjunction with the
executive committee, will facilitate
and promote cooperation.
"Undergraduates have been im
pressed with what the GSC is doing.
There are features of the GSC that
could work for undergrads as well,"
Robinson said.
Raising concerns
Three senators voted against
placing the amendment on the elec
tion ballot: senior David Searle, in
dustrial engineering doctoral stu
dent David Hutton and sophomore
Malia Villegas. During the debate
that preceded the vote, Searle
voiced his opposition, bringing up
concerns shared by Villegas.
Searle's major concerns were
that there were "no constitutional
provisions for joint meetings to ad
dress campus wide issues [causing] a
permanent dissection of the ASSU,
the inadequacies of allocating
money using a consensus of present
graduates — not only elected repre
sentatives. but in fact any graduate
present at the meeting — and too
loose a structure for the GSC (no
quorum, committees or provisions
for removal of officers)."'
After Searle voiced his opinions,
several senators, including Searle,

"sat down at three separate meet
ings to review and amend the pro
posed bylaws for both the GSC and
the ASSU at large," Searle said.
"We made substantial changes that
will effect how the GSC operates
next year if the voters approve the
amendment."
Those bylaws are not included in
the amendment and would not be
written into the constitution.
The following changes were
made to accommodate Searle's con
cerns:
• In the joint bylaws, at least one
joint meeting a quarter between the
two bodies will be mandated.
• When standing committees of
the Undergraduate Senate meet to
discuss campus-wide issues, at least
one GSC representative must be
present.
• A two-thirds vote, and not con
sensus, can override the decision of
the GSC Chair over how to conduct
a meeting.
• In the event that consensus
breaks down, the GSC fall-back vot
ing mechanism will be a vote among
voting members.
• One-third of voting GSC mem
bers must be present at any meeting
at which a consensus funding alloca
tion is made and any representatives
of an organization present at GSC
meetings shall not be included in
consensus
Searle still has some reserva
tions. "Although the Association
and GSC bylaws have been changed
to give more legitimacy and ac
countability to the GSC, if it be
comes an integral separate body
within the ASSU, it is important to
remember that such changes are
merely incorporated in the bylaws
[and not the Constitution] and could
therefore be changed by the GSC at
its very first meeting next year," he
said.
Though he still has some specific
concerns, in general he feels "this
amendment will accomplish two
noble and worthwhile objectives for
graduate students."
"However, there is no doubt in
my mind that we did not send the
best amendment possible to the stu

dents for their vote. True, graduate
students will come out winners in
the short run."
"But by voting yes, graduates are
running the risk that their ASSU
fees will be allocated in an informal
and haphazard fashion in coming
years. We could have avoided all of
this by making the constitutional
amendment more concrete and
structured, and not simply the by
laws."
(irad concerns
Last night graduate student
Kaleb Michaud hosted a meeting of
graduate students to discuss the pro
posed amendment and explain how
it would affect graduate students.
Nearly 30 graduate students at
tended, representing groups includ
ing the Black Graduate Student As
sociation and the Graduate
Women's Network.
Michaud explained how in giving
the GSC jurisdiction over graduate
student general fees, more money
will be available for student groups,
encouraging and increasing gradu
ate student activism.
However, some people ex
pressed concern that with new stu
dent groups forming, existing
groups would receive less money.
There was also concern that the
graduate student population
doesn't know enough about the ex
isting GSC to be able to make an in
formed decision about creating an
official graduate council.
The last time the ASSU under
went significant reorganization was
three years ago. One president re
placed the system of four presidents,
and the number of senators was
changed to 15 undergraduates and
15 graduates, all of whom have a
vote.
The ASSU expanded to include
graduate students in the late 19405.
In the late 1960s there was a com
mittee called the Graduate Student
Association, the main focus of
which was organizing social activi
ties. At no point in Stanford history
have graduate students had a sepa
rate legislative body.
When students cast their votes
in the ASSU spring general elec
tion next week, one of the most im
portant decisions they will make is
whether to vote for or against the
constitutional amendment that
would create separate legislative
bodies for undergraduate and grad
uate students.

tomers. Graduate students face
problems that the ASSU neglects,
such as housing, stipends, taxes and
health care. A GSC written into the
constitution and given autonomy
could he better equipped to address
such problems.

'There is no doubt in my
mind that we did not send
the best amendment to the
students for their vote.'
— David Searle

Currently there is little commu
nication between the GSC and the
ASSU. The amendment allows for
joint meetings and joint commit
tees, and supporters of the bill feel
that those, in conjunction with the
executive committee, will facilitate
and promote cooperation.
"Undergraduates have been im
pressed with what the GSC is doing.
There are features of the GSC that
could work for undergrads as well,"
Robinson said.
Raising concerns
Three senators voted against
placing the amendment on the elec
tion ballot: senior David Searle, in
dustrial engineering doctoral stu
dent David Hutton and sophomore
Malia Villegas. During the debate
that preceded the vote, Searle
voiced his opposition, bringing up
concerns shared by Villegas.
Searle's major concerns were
that there were "no constitutional
provisions for joint meetings to ad
dress campus wide issues [causing] a
permanent dissection of the ASSU,
the inadequacies of allocating
money using a consensus of present
graduates — not only elected repre
sentatives. but in fact any graduate
present at the meeting — and too
loose a structure for the GSC (no
quorum, committees or provisions
for removal of officers)."'
After Searle voiced his opinions,
several senators, including Searle,

"sat down at three separate meet
ings to review and amend the pro
posed bylaws for both the GSC and
the ASSU at large," Searle said.
"We made substantial changes that
will effect how the GSC operates
next year if the voters approve the
amendment."
Those bylaws are not included in
the amendment and would not be
written into the constitution.
The following changes were
made to accommodate Searle's con
cerns:
• In the joint bylaws, at least one
joint meeting a quarter between the
two bodies will be mandated.
• When standing committees of
the Undergraduate Senate meet to
discuss campus-wide issues, at least
one GSC representative must be
present.
• A two-thirds vote, and not con
sensus, can override the decision of
the GSC Chair over how to conduct
a meeting.
• In the event that consensus
breaks down, the GSC fall-back vot
ing mechanism will be a vote among
voting members.
• One-third of voting GSC mem
bers must be present at any meeting
at which a consensus funding alloca
tion is made and any representatives
of an organization present at GSC
meetings shall not be included in
consensus
Searle still has some reserva
tions. "Although the Association
and GSC bylaws have been changed
to give more legitimacy and ac
countability to the GSC, if it be
comes an integral separate body
within the ASSU, it is important to
remember that such changes are
merely incorporated in the bylaws
[and not the Constitution] and could
therefore be changed by the GSC at
its very first meeting next year," he
said.
Though he still has some specific
concerns, in general he feels "this
amendment will accomplish two
noble and worthwhile objectives for
graduate students."
"However, there is no doubt in
my mind that we did not send the
best amendment possible to the stu

dents for their vote. True, graduate
students will come out winners in
the short run."
"But by voting yes, graduates are
running the risk that their ASSU
fees will be allocated in an informal
and haphazard fashion in coming
years. We could have avoided all of
this by making the constitutional
amendment more concrete and
structured, and not simply the by
laws."
(irad concerns
Last night graduate student
Kaleb Michaud hosted a meeting of
graduate students to discuss the pro
posed amendment and explain how
it would affect graduate students.
Nearly 30 graduate students at
tended, representing groups includ
ing the Black Graduate Student As
sociation and the Graduate
Women's Network.
Michaud explained how in giving
the GSC jurisdiction over graduate
student general fees, more money
will be available for student groups,
encouraging and increasing gradu
ate student activism.
However, some people ex
pressed concern that with new stu
dent groups forming, existing
groups would receive less money.
There was also concern that the
graduate student population
doesn't know enough about the ex
isting GSC to be able to make an in
formed decision about creating an
official graduate council.
The last time the ASSU under
went significant reorganization was
three years ago. One president re
placed the system of four presidents,
and the number of senators was
changed to 15 undergraduates and
15 graduates, all of whom have a
vote.
The ASSU expanded to include
graduate students in the late 19405.
In the late 1960s there was a com
mittee called the Graduate Student
Association, the main focus of
which was organizing social activi
ties. At no point in Stanford history
have graduate students had a sepa
rate legislative body.
When students cast their votes
in the ASSU spring general elec
tion next week, one of the most im
portant decisions they will make is
whether to vote for or against the
constitutional amendment that
would create separate legislative
bodies for undergraduate and grad
uate students.
The amendment, titled "An

ASSU for all Students; Effective
Advocacy & Improved Program
ming." was written with the goal of
creating a student government that
would more effectively address
both undergraduate and graduate
student issues.
Possible changes
Under the amendment, the
ASSU would be of a 15-
member undergraduate Senate and
a 15-member Graduate Student
Council. This new GSC would as
sume a role beyond that filled by the
current GSC, which informally co
ordinates and represents graduate
concerns at Stanford. The new
council "would represent graduate
students in the same capacity that
the Undergraduate Senate serves its
population, but its structure would
be much more open and flexible."
The summary of the amendment
outlines the three main features of
the 43-page amendment.
The first is that the "proposal al
lows graduate and undergraduate
students to represent themselves in
the way that works best for each,"
according to the summary.
I he formation of an executive
committee allows the second fea
ture of the amendment: the facilita
tion of cooperation between the two
bodies.
I lie ASSIJ president and vice
president would be members of the
executive committee, along with the
ASSIJ financial manager and sever
al others.
This committee would coordi
nate the two bodies, making sure
that they "stay tied together and
don't go their separate ways," said
(iraduate Senator David Robinson,
chair of the ASSU's Administration
and Rules ( ommittee.
The executive committee would
also determine what issues are rele
vant for both bodies, calling joint
meetings when appropriate and
"fostering informal collaboration
between bodies."
I he president and vice president
would be members of both the un
dergraduate senate and the (»S(
T he third main aspect of the
amendment is its provision for "fair
use of programming resources."
Currently undergraduates pay 44
percent of the general lees, and
graduate students pay 56 percent,
according to ASSIJ Financial Man
ager Matt Garlinghouse.

Most of the fees, however, go to
support undergraduate program
ming. If the amendment passes,
graduate student fees would go to
support graduate student activities
only.
A new idea
The idea for the reorganization
of the ASSU "spontaneously arose
in a number of different places, in
response to a number of different
things." Robinson said.
There was some talk of restruc
turing over the summer and slightly
more in the fall, but it was at the start
of winter quarter that the idea
began to seriously take shape, ac
cording to Robinson.
ASSU President Maren Norton,
a senior; Vice President Santos
Marroquin, a junior; Senate Chair
Adam Weiss, a junior; Deputy Sen
ate Chair Mike Levin, a junior:
Robinson; (JSC Chair Harris
Shapiro, a doctoral student in
physics; and graduate senators
Hunter Tart and John Mills were
some of the people who originally
discussed the idea of creating the
amendment.
However it didn't take long for
"a lot of other people [to get) in
volved. including just about all ac
tive C iS(' people and a lot of current
and former senators and presi
dents." Robinson said.
CiSC matures
The GSC has done a great deal
for graduate students, and the
ASSU has done very little, Robin
son said. This year several social
events have been organized by the
GSC, and graduate students would
like to see more of them.
"This is a rich environment for
different types of people, but there
aren't opportunities [for grad stu
dents! to meet them." Robinson
said.
Graduate students and under
graduate students are in very differ
ent situations at Stanford; as Robin
son put it. graduate students are. in a
sense, employees of the University,

whereas undergraduates are eus
tomers. Graduate students face
problems that the ASSU neglects,
such as housing, stipends, taxes and
health care. A GSC written into the
constitution and given autonomy
could he better equipped to address
such problems.
