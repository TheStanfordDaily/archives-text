# Rising gas prices jump 50 cents in five weeks
## 
### Jennifer Godwin Staff writer 
This might not be the quarter to
take that road trip you've been plan
ning — gas prices have increased
dramatically in the Bay Area and
around the country.
California's supply of reforumu
lated gasoline has been affected by
three recent explosions or fires at
three key Northern California re
fineries. While the Exxon plant in
Martinez is now functioning, the
other two remain crippled. Mean
while the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has decided to
reduce production by about 2 million
barrels a day.
Esther Jenkins, who staffs the
Campus Service Texaco station, and
is the owner's daughter, said that she
has seen rates rise "about 50 cents in
the last five weeks per type" ol gaso
line.
"The refineries have a way to go.
There are a lot of safety issues to be
addressed," Jenkins said.
Along El Camino gas prices range
from $1.65 to $1.79 for regular, while
at one station in East Palo Alto, reg
ular costs $1.59 per gallon. Accord
ing to a report by the American Au
tomobile Association, average gaso

line prices have jumped almost 11
percent nationally in the past two
weeks.
The rising prices may catch up
with the university administration in
the coming months, but according to
Vice Provost for Facilities, Chris
Christofferson, "The price rise hasn't
caught up to us yet."
Stanford buys gasoline in bulk
and has its own service station for the

University Fleet. Christofferson
adds that the price of gas is just one of
many variables calculated into the
Facilities charge for services.
Most students aren't overly con
cerned with the situation, junior El
liot Mandel said, "It's not really that
big a deal. It's just a normal market
fluctuation. Prices go down, and then

something pushes them back up. In
this case it was apparently an OPEC
meeting. It's an expected change."
Senior James Chung is more
upset about the situation. "It sucks,"
he said. "It's ridiculous. I use 'plus'
because 'supreme' is just outra
geous."
"(ias is 19 cents in Texas," said se

to drive less."
"I'm trying to make my friends

drive more," Chung quipped.
Ridesharing is an option for
some, but not for many, students
who commute to Stanford.
"It's awful. I have to use 92 octane
on this car, and it's almost $2.(X)a gal
lon. I'm a commuter student — I live
in San Carlos, and it really increases
the cost of education," said Jim
Niemiec, a first year law and business
student.
He added, "I went to L.A. for the
holiday, and it's almost getting
cheaper to fly than to drive. You can
get $K() round plane trip tickets, and
it's about $50 for gas."

Other students appreciate the
comparatively low cost of gas in the
United States.
Yesterday was the first day fresh
man Ravi Faiia ever put gas in a car
in the I Jnited States.
"I just got this,"he said, gesturing
at his Honda. "But in Britain I know
it's more expensive, with all the
taxes. So I appreciate the American
prices."
Most European countries have
high gasoline taxes to encourage
lower consumption and fund public
transportation and alternative ener
gies.
