# Rising gas prices jump 50 cents in five weeks

This might not be the quarter to
take that road trip you've been plan
ning — gas prices have increased
dramatically in the Bay Area and
around the country.
California's supply of reforumu
lated gasoline has been affected by
three recent explosions or fires at
three key Northern California re
fineries. While the Exxon plant in
Martinez is now functioning, the
other two remain crippled. Mean
while the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has decided to
reduce production by about 2 million
barrels a day.
Esther Jenkins, who staffs the
Campus Service Texaco station, and
is the owner's daughter, said that she
has seen rates rise "about 50 cents in
the last five weeks per type" ol gaso
line.
"The refineries have a way to go.
There are a lot of safety issues to be
addressed," Jenkins said.
Along El Camino gas prices range
from $1.65 to $1.79 for regular, while
at one station in East Palo Alto, reg
ular costs $1.59 per gallon. Accord
ing to a report by the American Au
tomobile Association, average gaso

line prices have jumped almost 11
percent nationally in the past two
weeks.
The rising prices may catch up
with the university administration in
the coming months, but according to
Vice Provost for Facilities, Chris
Christofferson, "The price rise hasn't
caught up to us yet."
Stanford buys gasoline in bulk
and has its own service station for the

University Fleet. Christofferson
adds that the price of gas is just one of
many variables calculated into the
Facilities charge for services.
Most students aren't overly con
cerned with the situation, junior El
liot Mandel said, "It's not really that
big a deal. It's just a normal market
fluctuation. Prices go down, and then

Medical Center employees Lynn Frederico and Eric Huffman fill up
at the Texico station at the corner of Campus Drive and Serra Street.
Due to local refinery fires and climbing oil prices, the Stanford com
munity is paying 50 cents more for a gallon of gasoline than it did five
weeks ago.
