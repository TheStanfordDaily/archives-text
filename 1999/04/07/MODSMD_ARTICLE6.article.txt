Stanford staff posit ions will soon conic with
an extra perk.
Starting Sept. 1, Stanford will provide finan
cial assistance to staff members who wish to
pursue an undergraduate or graduate degree
at an accredited institution, according to Tina
Kass. associate vice president of the Office of
Human Resources. .
Full-time and part-time staff members who
have been working for at least one year will be
eligible for the new Staff Tuition Reimburse
ment Program. Full-time staff members will be
eligible for up to $2.(HK) per fiscal year for tu
ition and registration fees at a university or col
lege. Part-time staff members will be eligible
for a prorated amount.
Kass said staff positions cover all areas of
Stanford, including various offices, laborato

lies, SI-AC. Housing and Dining Services and
libraries, hut she didn't know who would make
use of the program.
"There were some employees in the Con
troller's Office who talked about getting an
MBA degree a couple of years ago," Kass said.
"But it's hard to tell exactly who will take ad
vantage of the program at this point."
Currently staff benefit from the Staff Train
ing Assistance Program, which provides $2(K)
each quarter to cover job-related courses,
workshops and seminars. Unlike SI AP the
new program will provide assistance for any
field staff members are interested in.
"I think it's great. If they are going to reim
burse you for tuition, use it or lose it." said
Miquel Fernandez, porter monitor at Green
Library. "Any help with tuition is welcome
with anybody. 1 have no objection to that."
