chance to win loads of COOI prizes like
an iMac or a DVD player! You can also
earn money for your school-the top
three colleges that bring in the most
pairs of jeans will win cash for their
school's scholarship fund.
Free Levi's" Original Spin jeans
to the first 105 people who donate to the
jean pool with a used pair. Everyone is
welcome.
