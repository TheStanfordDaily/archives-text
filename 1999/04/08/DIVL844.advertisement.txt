PLAYBOY
is coming to
Stanford
Attention female student body! Ever fantasized about being pictured in the number one
men's magazine in the world? Now's your chance to turn fantasy into reality.
Representatives from PLAYBOY magazine are coming to Stanford to interview and
photograph female students for its fall 1999 pictorial, "The Women of the Pac Ten."
Thousands of coeds have tried out for PLAYBOY since it began its college conference
pictorials 22 years ago. Many have gone on to become PLAYBOY Playmates, models
and actresses. Even more have become doctors, lawyers, scientists, professors, business
and government professionals, wives and moms. Who knows what the future holds for
you? Of course, you could always dig out your issue and relive your glory days.
To arrange an interview, candidates should send a recent full-figure photo in a two-piece
swimsuit (or less) plus a head-and-shoulders shot to Playboy's home office in Chicago. Polaroids,
snapshots or slides are OK. Candidates should also supply the following information:
1: Year In School 2: Course of Study 3: Sports/Activities
4: Date of Birth 5: Height, Weight & Measurements
Candidates must be at least 18 years of age and registered as a full- or part-time stvdent at
a Pac Ten university. Clear copies of identification-one verifying enrollment in school and
a photo ID that shows date of birth-must be included. All photos become
property of Playboy and cannot be returned.
Interviews at STANFORD will be held on
MONDAY, IVAAYIO AND TUESDAY, MAY 11.
Playboy will contact candidates to provide the location where the Playboy Photo Team will hold interviews.
