# Resolution decries polluters
## Stanford asked to use investment power to combat global warming 
### Susan Finlayson 
The ASSU Senate unanimously voted
on Tuesday to supporTTrpolicy recommen
dation of the Advisorv Panel on Invest

ment Responsibility regarding global
warming issues and Stanford investments.
Ozone Action, a national organization
that works for awareness of global warm
ing issues and includes a student group at
Stanford, held a press conference yester
day to express support of the ASSIJ's ac
tion.
The APIR policy, officially titled the
"Policy Recommendation on Investment
Responsibility and Global Climate
( hange," calls for Stanford to use the clout
of its endowment to encourage account
ability among the companies in which in it
invests, especially member companies of

the Global Climate Coalition, a Washing
ton. D.C.-based nonprofit organization.
The GCC has spent millions of dollars
on research to show that global warming is
less of a problem than commonly sup
posed. Recently, it has poured money into
opposing U.S. Senate ratification of the
Kyoto Protocol, a measure that would
commit the United States to decreasing
greenhouse gas emissions.
Professors and students at Stanford, as
well as various national coalitions repre
sented on campus, blame the GCC for de-

liberately misinforming the public
about global warming.
Stanford reportedly has invest
ments in GCC members General
Motors, Exxon, Mobil and Texaco.
The APIR policy focuses on urging
companies to "take positive actions
on global climate change," said
Aimee Christensen, a law student
and author of the APIR recommen
dation. It also urges the University to
engage in dialogue with these compa
nies and alert them to Stanford's dis
approval of their actions.
While Stanford's divestment of
funds from these companies "is an
option and we're willing to take it,"
Christensen said, "divestment is not
an effective t<x)l for getting corpora
tions to make change because you
lose a voice — any sort of leverage —

when you are no longer a sharehold
er."
Stanford has a history in issues of
responsible investment, most no
tably during the 1980s when it be
eame the first university to use in
vestment clout to discourage corpo
rate support of South Africa's racist
regime.
According to Donald Kennedy,
the University's president at the time,
Stanford undertook a strategy of dis
cussion, proxy voting and, in a few
cases, divestment to influence corpo
rations.
The APIR recommendation re
flects a similar strategy. Kennedy ex
pressed optimism in corporate trends
towards environmental responsibili
ty-
Kennedy said, "the objective in
my mind is that we can persuade
these companies that it is more pro
ductive for them, and in the long run
more profitable, to abandon the ex

pensive lobbying campaign against
the scientific consensus and join the
number of Fortune S(X) companies
that have decided instead to encour
age early action."
Petitions advocating similar Uni
versity action were signed by more
than 900 students and 14 professors,
including Profs. Stephen Schneider,
Paul Ehrlich and Kennedy, who to
gether wrote an independent letter to
the San Francisco Chronicle and The
Stanford Daily calling for University
action.
University action is also advocat
ed by various student groups, includ
ing student representatives of the na
tional nonprofit organizations
GreenCorp and Ozone Action
This Sunday, the APIR will pre
sent the recommendation to Special
Committee on Investment Responsi
bility, a subcommittee of the Univer
sity's Board of Trustees, for ap
proval.
