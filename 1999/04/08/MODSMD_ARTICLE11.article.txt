Five people escape North Korea
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Five people, including a South
Korean prisoner of war. have arrived in Seoul alter escaping famine
stricken North Korea, officials said yesterday.
One of the escapees, Sohn Jae-sool. 67. then an army private, was
captured by Chinese troops during the 1950-53 Korean War, accord
ing to a news release from the National Intelligence Service.
Sohn was later sent to a coal mine in northern North Korea where
he was forced to work until he managed to escape to a third country
in October with his wife Eo Hong Nye, 64. and 30-vear-old daughter
Soon-sil, the agency said.
The three entered South Korea recently, it said.
In unrelated defections, two other North Koreans also have arrived
in Seoul from a third country where thcv had lived in hiding after Hoe
ing the communist state between 1995 and 1997. the agency said.
The agency identified one of them as a 37-year-old former North
Korean army captain but gave no further details.
The agency usually uses the term " third country" to avoid naming
China, which is required by treaty with North Korea to return defec
tors to their homeland.
The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the capi
talist South in 1945. They are technically still at war as the Korean War
ended with an armistice, not a formal peace treaty. China fought on
North Korea's side in the Korean War.
Seoul says more than 40.000 South Korean prisoners of war were
not returned at the end of the war, but the North claims that all south
ern POWs went home in 1953.
So far, six South Korean POWs have escaped the North and
arrived in South Korea.
Global financial crisis may continue
WASHINGTON (AP) — The World Bank predicted yesterday
the global financial crisis may last longer than expected despite recent
signs of recovery in Asia and Brazil.
The bank, in a report assessing worldwide financial conditions,
expressed concern about the possibility of protectionist trade policies
if the U.S. economy falters, European markets fail to revive and
Japan's recession deepens.
''Although there have been some encouraging signs of late with
respect to recovery in Asia and in Brazil, we view this crisis as not over
yet and we anticipate it will be more protracted and deeper than
previously expected, said Uri Dadush, a senior bank official.
He said the bank wanted to warn against complacency as
economies in Asia, where the crisis began 21 months ago, start to
bounce back.
In Brazil, where the crisis spread late last year, stock markets are
surging, the currency is stronger, inflation is lessening and investors
are returning.
Dadush said the world economic growth ''has become extremely
dependent on domestic demand in the United States," including a
surging stock market. He described this dependence as ''not a healthy
situation."
The bank predicted that growth in the world's gross domestic prod
uct would rise by 1.8 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in 1998. A 2.4
percent growth rate was forecast for 2000.
The report said average growth rate in developing countries will be
1.5 percent in 1999. the lowest since 1982. and down from 1.9 percent
in 1998 and 4.8 percent in 1997. The bank predicted a 3.6 percent
increase in 2000.
