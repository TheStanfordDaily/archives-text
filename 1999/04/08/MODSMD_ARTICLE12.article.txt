# Refugee crisis invokes criticism of NATO

BLACE, Macedonia (AP) — Macedonian
authorities early yesterday emptied a border
enclave where tens of thousands of Kosovo
refugees had been trapped for days, taking some
to NATO tent camps and shipping thousands of
others off to Albania.
Aid workers expressed strong concern that
the refugees had not been told where they were
going, and that aid organizations had not been
informed beforehand of plans for the mass trans
port.
Macedonia, flooded with more than 130.000
refugees since the NATO bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia began two weeks ago, has
said it can take in only about 20.0(H) of the
arrivals, and wants the rest quickly shipped off to
third countries.
The move to swiftly empty the teeming Blace
encampment overnight came against a backdrop
of growing tensions between Western aid and
alliance officials and authorities in Macedonia, a
former Yugoslav republic.
On Tuesday, Macedonia's prime minister.
Ljubco Georgievski, sharply criticized NATO,
saying the alliance had been "completely irre
sponsible" to ignore warnings that airstrikes on
Yugoslavia could trigger a humanitarian disaster.
The United Nations and other Western aid
agencies, for their part, have accused Macedonia
of using bureaucratic delays to slow the influx of
both refugees and aid.
Aid workers were sharply critical of the han
dling of the Blace evacuation, saying refugees
were hustled away without being told where they
were bound, and families in some instances were
separated.
"These buses arrived unannounced with no
forewarning and no information about their des
tinations." said Paul Stromberg. a spokesman for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
"We talked to a girl this morning who found
her father was in Turkey, her mother was in
another transit center, her brother at another
crossing point...lt is the kind of thing we are
going to find more and more," he said.
Aid workers did not even know where the
refugees had been taken until midday, when
Macedonian officials announced that about
10.000 of them had been transported to Albania
and another 25,000 were taken to NATO-run

tent camps inside Macedonia.
In the Albanian town of Korea, close to the
point where the refugees crossed over, refugees
gathered on a soccer field and were being given
bread and milk by local people.
All that remained today at the Blace site was
a giant, smoldering pit. with garbage fires burn
ing and tons of muddy clothing and plastic sheet
ing strewn about.
Filthy, primitive conditions in the camp had
led to an outbreak of illness and some deaths in
recent days. The refugees' sufferings at Blace fol
lowed their forced expulsion from homes in
Kosovo by Serbian troops and police, and what
was for many an arduous trek on foot to the bor
der.
Those who made it into Macedonia said they
believed people on the Yugoslav side of the bor
der at Blace — where a line of waiting cars

stretched for about six miles — had been pushed
back into Kosovo.
"People saw them being turned back," said
Rronn Qena. 20. a Kosovar painter who arrived l

Western aid agencies, meanwhile, were look
ing into reports that Macedonia was forcing?
Kosovo Albanians to leave the country in
Western-organized airlift. Flights to Norway and
Turkey that began Monday have so far carried
out only a few thousand of the refugees.
Macedonia fears the flood of refugees will
destabilize its own ethnic balance.
