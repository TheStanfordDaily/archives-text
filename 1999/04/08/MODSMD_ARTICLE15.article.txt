: The Medical School's
teaching facilities are
ftn dire need of change

IN THE PANTHEON of gradu
ate schools, Stanford has a solid
position. The graduate schools
of business, law, engineering, educa
tion and other fields consistently
rank among the best in the country,
and almost any degree program with
the Stanford moniker attached com
mands immediate respect. However,
the dilapidated teaching facilities at
the School of Medicine are an
embarrassment to our hallowed
name.
. Despite unquestioned excellence
tin terms of its research facilities, the
Medical School suffers from anti
quated teaching and library build
ings that date from the 19505. A Uni
versity that attends so carefully to
both its reputation and its appear
ance should not allow this problem
to tester any longer.
On Monday, the Liaison Commit
tee on Medical Education, the
national board that accredits medi
cal schools, deemed the Medical
School's teaching facilities "unac
ceptable." At an institution such as
Stanford, even a rating of "average"
should inspire the administration to
pursue renovations.
Lane Library is currently home to
shameful tales of ancient computers,
no air conditioning and a noticeable
absence of bathrooms. Constructed
in 1959, the Medical School's lecture

halls fail to incorporate many of the
educational advances of the last 40
years. This is abominable.
The problems with the Medical
School are perhaps most acute in
terms of information technology.
Stanford Hospital and the Medical
School form an epicenter of cutting
edge research into the use of com
puters in medicine. To train future
doctors without comparable tech
nology is inexcusable.
Although we understand the lim
its on construction at Stanford
imposed by the general use plan, we
find it an unconvincing excuse for
the decades of neglect that parts of
the school have suffered. With fund
ing available from concerned alumni
and other sources, we believe that
the University has an obligation to
enact change as expediently as it
can.
We commend the efforts of the
Medical School students who have
helped bring this issue to the fore
front. The consensus that has been
established between students and
faculty about renovation should not
be wasted; we exhort the University
to take advantage of it.
The Stanford name is something
that we are all proud to associate
ourselves with. To have it attached
to such sub-par facilities threatens
the tremendous reverence that it
inspires and the powerful reputation
it carries. We urge the University to
work with the students and faculty at
the Medical School to rectify this as
soon as possible and remove this
University blemish.
