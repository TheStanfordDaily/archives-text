SPRING QUARTER
beckons: warm
weather, a lighter
class load and ... Rush. To
rush or not to rush is the
inevitable question.
If you've read your 1999
Greek Prospectus (and I

know you have), you've probably gleaned a
few impressions of Stanford's Greek organi
zations. The words "unique," "dynamic"
and "lifelong friendships" seem to pop up
everywhere. Groups promise bonding, for
mats and as much fun as you can handle. All
you need to do is come ready to rush.
Upperclass Greeks have been planning
Rush for months: writing skits, practicing
songs, hiring hypnotists and engaging in
some requisite bonding. Freshmen and non
affiliated sophomores, they want you. So do
you want them?
By this point in the school year, you've
probably been to your fair share of bumpin'
Greek grinds. Through this experience, you
may now be able to distinguish the Deke
House from the SAE House. Furthermore,
you've probably begun to form opinions of
the various groups. Likely these opinions
have some basis in the stereotypes that tend
to pervade this campus (and are perpetuat
ed by resident assistants) — Fraternity X
requires its members to wear polo shirts,
khakis and belts at all times; Sorority Y is
home to the short skirt-wearing sluts; Fra
ternity Z laces beers with ecstasy. Such
stereotypes are interesting, yes. But are they
accurate?
Let's be honest. While one or two mem

hers might fit the bill, it's impossible to make
a generalization that's accurate for all 70
individuals who belong to an organization.
So while using a stereotype might be easier
than getting to know everyone in a Greek
organization, it's a major cop out.
So where does Rush come in? Rush is
more than just a way to teach ex-public
school students the Greek alphabet; it's a
way to move past stereotypes and really get
to know Stanford's sororities and fraterni
ties. And most importantly, rushing doesn't
require pledging; it's simply a chance to
learn more.
So you might be wondering: if 1 rush
what am 1 in for? Lacking a Y chromosome,
I can really only speak for the ladies. The
section on Sorority Rush in the infamous
Greek Prospectus explains the process in
detail, so I'll just mention a few highlights.
Be prepared for clapping, singing and skits.
Don't be afraid, you won't have to partic
ipate; it's all for your viewing and listening
pleasure.
Be ready for the conversation in which
you have to fire off where you live on cam
pus, where you're from and what you like to
do in your free time — all in less than five
minutes. You might be overwhelmed by the
number of sororities you visit and the num
ber of smiling women you meet. But don't
worry, you won't be tested on each sorori
ty's official colors or corresponding symbol
(hint: often a cute animal).
Does this Rush process require any
preparation? Contrary to popular belief,
you do not need to run up your charge card
buying four new diva outfits (and I really

stress this point). Think of the possible
tragedy of falling flat on your face in your
brand new 5- inch platforms at the Sheraton
Hotel. The best preparation is, as cliched as
it sounds, to be comfortable and simply be
yourself.
Another piece of advice: rushing does
not equate with popularity. When you join a
Greek organization, you don't receive mem
bership into the elusive "cool kids club."
Joining won't make you a new person. You
shouldn't go into the process with expecta
tions of coming out the BMOC or campus
social queen.
What rushing will mean is meeting hun
dreds of new people, even if you don't
remember anyone's name — much like Ori
entation week. Joining can mean making
dynamic, lifelong friendships with unique
people of all different classes.
So just rush — everyone's invited, and in
being closed-minded, you may pass up an
opportunity to meet new people, enjoy free
food or have a hypnotist make you act like
your favorite farm animal.
Don't give up your best opportunity to
learn about Greek life at Stanford — infor
mation is power. And as the Theta Xi's
(a.k.a. TaXis) say in their section of the
Greek Prospectus, "Come out and rush; it
sure beats hours of surfing for porn on the
Web."

Erin Bouchier is a junior majoring in political
science. While she failed to make it all the way
through Rush, she's Greek by blood. Sorority
