Management ability is most important for Bookstore

-1 have read with interest the many edito
rials. letters and artieles regarding the
change in operations at the Stanford Book
store. Not only have the San Jose Mercury
News, Palo Alto Daily and others missed
some extremely salient points hut they,
along with The Daily, have bought the
"spin" that the current management has
foisted on the media and the public.
The entire question of the ability to man
age the Bookstore has been overlooked.
As a former supervisor / manager, 1 was
in a position to view the management oper
ations from an inside perspective. The prob
lems lacing the bookstore cannot be solved
by companies such as Amazon.com. Stu
dents still come to the Bookstore as a matter
of convenience and. to some extent, as part
of a 102-year-old tradition. However, the
services the Bookstore provides students,
faculty and staff have diminished over the
years. They have fallen to the current
regime's notion that profit is more impor
tant than customer service.
It is also a management team that was
blind to a former manager whose depart
ment "lost" hundreds of thousands of dol
lars every year. This manager seemed to
operate in an environment of total control
and no responsibility, year after year. This
manager also was in charge of the "custom
publishing" division of the Bookstore. This
division lost major accounts to other
sources, including USC. Course materials
are. quite often, not available to students

during the "rush" at the beginning of the
quarter. There are, however, complete logo
outfits, Stanford embossed evcrythings and
even an in-house Clinque department avail
able to fill student's real requirements.
Percentages of profit are extremely high
in clothing and the like. Profit margins in the
book market are very slim. Year-end "prof
its" for the non-profit bookstore were the
driving force to try and out-market the local
shopping venues.
The entire middle-management group
that was employed by the Bookstore around
the time I was hired has left the company.
Each person, hired for their expertise in
their given departments, left of their own
accord. The "rank and file" employees have
left in droves. The feeling was (and is) that
the Bookstore was headed for a disaster.
The management next hired a "store
manager." Phis man was wonderful. He
tried to uplift the morale of the staff and
upgrade the quality of service to Bookstore
customers. Unfortunately, this outstanding
leader was thwarted at every turn and.
although he works for the Bookstore, he is
no longer the store manager.
While profits plummeted there were
major expenditures in the human resources
department. "Upper management" still
seemed to feel they deserved their exorbi
tant salaries while telling some employees
they should be "glad" for a seven-cent-an
hour raise.
The human resources department chas

tised an employee who brought warranted
sexual harassment charges against a depart
ment manager. Although this individual was
terminated, the other employee was told,
"You know, because of this, we have lost a
good employee."
A new, "improved" computer system
was bought (at considerable expense) to
replace a patchwork, customized existing
system which included register operations,
inventory, shipping, receiving, ordering and
internal communications programs. It
crashed while trying to make transactions at
the cashier's stations. It did not "allow" text
books to be received and so they sat in the
warehouse. "General merchandise," howev
er, was not affected so students could stay
warm in their $60 sweatshirts.
A current buyer / manager told me that
he feels that they (the Bookstore staff) have
been "sold down the river." I believe he is
right.
This is a management team that pushed
highly competent managers out of the com
pany in order to stave off the inevitable
financial collapse that they are currently
experiencing.
They let a manager with a 17-and-a-half
year career with the Bookstore slowly be
"forced" out of the company in the name of
cost saving measures. Yet these same deci
sion-makers kept their own jobs secure until
now.
The problem I have with the current
management, other than my moral indigna

tion about how these people treated the
Bookstore staff, is that they will undoubted
ly parachute out of the burning wreckage. It
doesn't seem quite fair.
I have never met Eldon Speed, but I have
heard wonderful stories about him from
many of the "old-timers" at the Bookstore.
The "scandal" is that no one seems to
acknowledge that the matter did not even go
to trial. ITie judge ruled that there was no
evidence to call for such charges.
Maybe I do not understand the problem.
You run a highly successful university book
store, make a profit, treat your employees
with dignity, respect and share the "perks"
of running a highly successful operation with
them.
I would have liked to work under the
leadership of Speed. I am sure 1 would have
learned a great deal from him. May he be
successful in all that he attempts.
My sadness for what is happening to the
Stanford Bookstore and its 102-year-old tra
dition is tempered by my anger for those
who are responsible. I hope they are satis
fied with the upheaval they have caused. I
think they must be held accountable, not
only morally but also fiscally. They should
not be allowed to captain the ship without
accepting the responsibility for its sinking.
Stop the "spin" and own up to your fail
ing.
