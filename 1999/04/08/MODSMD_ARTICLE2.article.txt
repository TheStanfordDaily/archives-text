April 15: A date that strikes fear into the hearts and
wallets of taxpayers everywhere. Fortunately, the
Graduate Student Council is aiding students by pro
viding tax information and free tax-preparation soft
ware.
"Graduate students have exceptionally complicat
ed taxes for such exceptionally little incomes," said
chemistry doctoral student Chris Stromberg, the pro
gram's organizer. "Students especially are subject to
hundreds of different laws. The GSC has tried to make
tax time easier by organizing information in a way that
takes a little stress out of the process."
The comprehensive GSC Web site contains down
loadable tax forms links to federal agencies and arti
cles about taxes, including a number of sites that
specifically answer student questions. For those who
are waiting until the last minute to do their taxes, when

the main downloadable sites on the Internet will be
too crowded to use, the GSC has also set up down
loadable forms on their own site as a backup.
Moreover, the (JSC has set up a small library in the
ASSIJ office in Tresidder with common forms and
help books donated by various publishers. There are
also binders with all California tax forms, even the
most obscure. The ASSIJ has granted students the use
of their photocopier for free copying of necessary
forms.
In addition to organizing the library, the GSC co
sponsored a tax seminar that will be broadcast on
SCBN on April 12 at 9 p.m. and April 13 at 8 p.m.
Also, for the first time, graduate students now have
the opportunity to receive free software packages to
make tax season a bit easier this year. The GSC and In
tuit will distribute 50() copies of the software-maker's
Turbo Tax Deluxe and Turbo Tax State programs to
