## You should care because you're a Stanford student

YOU WOKE UP
yesterday morn
ing to campaign
fliers plastered across
campus. At dinner this
week, chances are you will
meet a potential ASSU
President, ASSU Senator
or class president as they

make the rounds meeting people and solicit
ing votes. Class presidents and senatorial
candidates will engulf White Pla/a, handing
out goodies and informational material as
you and I go to and from our classes. All this
activity begs the questions: why should 1
care, and what will these people really do for
me?
I thought about spending all S.(MX) char

acters of this column enumerating the pro
jects the ASSU has done this year as well as
the tasks it manages annually. Maybe a para
graph on the new Online Course Guide and
another on the Midnight Express Mar
guerite. Reporting on Midnight Breakfast
and the expansion of SURE Escort might be
interesting as well. Possibly, the Dining
Report and the Student Group Survey, the
new constituency program and the program
ming that the Frosh Council and Graduate
Students Council each put on this year. And
then perhaps, the most important things the
ASSU does — allocating more than
$SXX).(XX) of your money to student groups
each year and appointing students to Uni
versity committees.
But I think the answer to the "why should

I care" question is much more fundamental
than that. Whether you know what the
ASSU does or doesn't do, the answer is very
simple: ASSU stands for the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University. It's not just a
random person with an office in Tresidder
who calls her or himself a president, or 30
senators who meet together on Tuesday
nights or the countless people who manage
and staff the various SSE business projects.
The ASSU is you and me. We are the
Associated Students of Stanford University.
Those who serve as elected representatives
of the ASSU represent each one of us as
they voice opinions on our behalf. They
stand in our stead as they allocate funds to
student groups, act on issues of importance
to us and present our concerns to adminis

trators at all levels of the University. Person
ally, granting someone the authority to act in
my name is not a responsibility that I give
away lightly.
Likewise, each person who carries with
him or her the title of ASSU Senator has the
duty to represent his or her constituency
(each one of us) to the best of his or her abil
ity. In order for them to do so, they rely on
the input of the student body and must be
willing to solicit such opinions.
Ask yourself if anyone has ever asked
your opinion. If not, why? Your insights
deserve to be part of the collective the
ASSU senators and president claim to rep
resent when they speak for students. It is
your responsibility to make sure that hap
pens by voting for those people who will

honestly entice you to participate and ask
you to share your thoughts with them. It is
impossible for them to do so unless you take
the time to pay attention this week to figure
out who you trust will listen to students and
properly represent you and your peers to the
rest of the University, as well as the outsjde
community.
This year the elections are more than
candidates and special fees; a constitutional
amendment is on the ballot that will pro
foundly affect each one of us. Undergradu
ates should take the time to learn about the
amendment and vote because it is ,an
attempt to make the ASSU a representative
of all students — graduate and undergradu
