# Campus viewpoint
## Split ASSU is just common sense 
### 
Maurizio Battaglia

Historically, there has never been effec
tive representation for graduate stu
dents at Stanford. In part, this is the
result of the fragmented nature of the graduate
population. However, much of the difficulty lies
in a student governmental structure that was
designed around the needs of undergraduates.
The results of these years of neglect have
been catastrophic. As the cost of the local hous
ing market spiraled out of control, the Universi
ty claimed that there wasn't any real housing
problem, despite hundreds of graduate students
being kicked off campus in each year's housing
lottery. Graduate stipend levels, stretched thin
bv skyrocketing rents and increasing health care
costs, dipped farther below the poverty line in a
county whose median annual income is nearly
$50,000 for a single person. Taken together,
these trends raised serious doubts about the
future of Stanford's reputation as a top-tier
research institution.
The development of the Graduate Student
Council has allowed these issues to be
addressed for the first time with a structure that
works far better for graduate students. A list of

the GSC's accomplishments demonstrates how
effective it has become.
One year ago, the GSC organized a survey
that gathered the first comprehensive data on
the graduate housing situation. The results of
the survey revealed a population deeply fearful
of being kicked off campus into a housing mar
ket almost no one could afford.
Thanks to the survey, as well as the campout
in the Main Quad organized shortly afterwards,
the University recognized the seriousness of the
situation and moved quickly to take strong
actions in response. The short-term response
was to increase graduate stipends by 8 percent
and to rent 250 off-campus spaces to graduate
students at below-market rates. The long-term
response was to commit to the construction of
4SO new on-campus spaces for graduate stu
dents, at a projected cost of $66 million. Univer
sity Provost Condoleezza Rice recently
announced an additional 7 percent increase in
the minimum graduate stipend and the procure
ment of 250 more subsidized spaces.
Lacking the extensive staff and programming
infrastructure of undergraduate Residential

Education, many graduate students find them
selves isolated with no outlets for social activity.
The GSC has worked to organize events, and
services to improve their quality of life. These
include the first Graduate Student Nights at
Flicks and the Coffee House and a Thanksgiv
ing dinner for graduate students, which provid
ed more than 6(H) graduate students who,had
nowhere else to go with a dinner in a family
environment. In addition, the GSC spearheaded
the creation of a tax information center'and
convinced Intuit to donate 500 copies of Tutbo-
Tax and MacinTax to provide help for graduate
students struggling with taxes.
Since the start of its trial funding program
this past January, the GSC has provided fuftds
for more graduate student organizations than
ever seem to have applied for ASSU Program
Board funding. GSC crafts its funding proce
dures to the needs and schedules of the gradu
ate population. The result has been the funding
of events that probably never would have
received ASSU support. , i

Over the past three years the Graduate
Student Council has managed to do more
on behalf of the graduate student body
than the rest of student government at
Stanford ever has. The most obvious proof
of this is in sheer numbers. GSC-organized
and sponsored events, whether they are
social or political in nature, regularly
attract hundreds or thousands of graduate
students.
The fact of the matter is that the ASSU
Senate does manage to provide the under
graduate population with desired services.
Predominantly undergraduate groups reg
ularly receive Board funding and are regu
larly placed on the ballot for special fees.
Matters affecting the undergraduate popu
lation are addressed. However the ASSU
Senate, in its decades of existence, has
never been able to achieve anything
remotely similar on behalf of the majority
of the students at Stanford: graduate stu
dents.

I he amendment on this spring's ASSU
election ballot recognizes this fact, reorga
nizing the ASSU to best meet the needs
and address the concerns of all of its con
stituents.
I'd acknowledge that different struc
tures are better suited for one population
or the other only says that they have dif
ferent needs. After all. what fraction of the
undergraduate population is concerned
about time-to-degree, stipends and health
care premiums for spouses? Why should
undergraduate representatives be forced
to sit on legislative bodies where issues are
discussed that do not affect their con
stituents?
The upcoming constitutional amend
ment recognizes all of these facts. It just
makes sense. To do anything else would be
to ignore literally decades of historical
fact, and condemn over half of the Stan
ford student body to continued suffering in
silence.
