WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Tuesday: No. 5 Stanford (18-
2,7-1 Pacific 10 Conference) 5,
No. 4 California (13-2,. 8-0 Pac
-10)1.

The Stanford women ap
proached the match with
extra motivation considering
Cal had defeated them in a
close match in late February.
"It was fabulous. We came
to play this time," said assis
tant coach Lele Forood. "We
were very good all the way
down the line. Everyone's
starting to play their best ten
nis."
Freshmen Marissa Irvin
agreed.
"We all wanted to avenge
that loss and beat them on
their home courts," she said.
"They were obnoxious when
they beat us. They wrote 'We
came, we saw, we con
quered,' all over the women's
tennis office. But we just
went there, beat them, and
we didn't make a big deal out
of it."
Irvin, the nation's second
ranked player, showed no
signs of weakness after last
weekend's shocking loss to
USC's Ditta Huber. In fact,
the defeat, which snapped
Irvin's 23-match win streak,
seemed to further strengthen
her mental game.
Against Cal's Amanda
Augustus, Irvin was at her
best from the start, conceding
only one game to the nation's
28th-ranked player. The last
time Augustus and Irvin
played, Irvin prevailed after
three tight sets.
"It was a new day," she
said. "I wanted to come back
and show her that I was tough
and I concentrated on every
point."
Equally impressive was
Ashley's 6-0, 6-1 rout over
Cal's Amy Jensen.
Ashley, ranked fifth in the
nation, was also recovering
from a tough weekend during
which she was beaten by
UCLA's Amanda Basica in
straight sets. She rebounded
strongly against Jensen, over
whelming last year's NCAA
doubles champion with her
formidable first serve and
powerful ground strokes.
"I played one of the best
matches I've played all year,"
Ashley said. "Marissa and I
set the tone by getting off the
court really quickly."
At the No. 4 singles posi
tion, freshman Lauren
Kalvaria stopped Cal's high
est ranked player, No. 17
Anita Kurimay, to earn one
of the best wins of her colle
giate career. Kurimay, who
won the ITA Regional
Championships in November
and boasts a victory over
Irvin, was dismantled by
Kalvaria in two easy sets. 6-2.
6-3.
"It was definitely the best
win of my season," Kalvaria
said. "I knew that if I played
my game and kept mentally
tough, I could beat her. This is
a big confidence-boost, be
cause I've come through in
my last few matches — some
