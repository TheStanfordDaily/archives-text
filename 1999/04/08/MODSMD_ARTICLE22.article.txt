4 California 5-1.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Tuesday: No. 5 Stanford (18-
2,7-1 Pacific 10 Conference) 5,
No. 4 California (13-2,. 8-0 Pac
-10)1.

The Stanford women ap
proached the match with
extra motivation considering
Cal had defeated them in a
close match in late February.
"It was fabulous. We came
to play this time," said assis
tant coach Lele Forood. "We
were very good all the way
down the line. Everyone's
starting to play their best ten
nis."
Freshmen Marissa Irvin
agreed.
"We all wanted to avenge
that loss and beat them on
their home courts," she said.
"They were obnoxious when
they beat us. They wrote 'We
came, we saw, we con
quered,' all over the women's
tennis office. But we just
went there, beat them, and
we didn't make a big deal out
of it."
Irvin, the nation's second
ranked player, showed no
signs of weakness after last
weekend's shocking loss to
USC's Ditta Huber. In fact,
the defeat, which snapped
Irvin's 23-match win streak,
seemed to further strengthen
her mental game.
Against Cal's Amanda
Augustus, Irvin was at her
best from the start, conceding
only one game to the nation's
28th-ranked player. The last
time Augustus and Irvin
played, Irvin prevailed after
three tight sets.
"It was a new day," she
said. "I wanted to come back
and show her that I was tough
and I concentrated on every
point."
Equally impressive was
Ashley's 6-0, 6-1 rout over
Cal's Amy Jensen.
Ashley, ranked fifth in the
nation, was also recovering
from a tough weekend during
which she was beaten by
UCLA's Amanda Basica in
straight sets. She rebounded
strongly against Jensen, over
whelming last year's NCAA
doubles champion with her
formidable first serve and
powerful ground strokes.
"I played one of the best
matches I've played all year,"
Ashley said. "Marissa and I
set the tone by getting off the
court really quickly."
At the No. 4 singles posi
tion, freshman Lauren
Kalvaria stopped Cal's high
est ranked player, No. 17
Anita Kurimay, to earn one
of the best wins of her colle
giate career. Kurimay, who
won the ITA Regional
Championships in November
and boasts a victory over
Irvin, was dismantled by
Kalvaria in two easy sets. 6-2.
6-3.
"It was definitely the best
win of my season," Kalvaria
said. "I knew that if I played
my game and kept mentally
tough, I could beat her. This is
a big confidence-boost, be
cause I've come through in
my last few matches — some
tough ones, some easy ones."
Freshmen Gabby Lastra and
Keiko Tokuda rolled to victory in
their respective matches. During
the Cardinal's previous meeting
with the Bears, Lastra and Tokuda
were both beaten. This time, the
freshmen displayed a maturity that
has grown out of their newfound fa
miliarity with the subtleties of dual
match competition at the collegiate
level.
Lastra upended Cal's Francesca
La'O, 6-4, 7-5, for her fourth
straight victory, while Tokuda
struggled initially against Cat's
Karoline Borgerson but then
cruised to a 7-5,6-3 win.
"I was down 0-4 in the first set,"
Lastra said, "but she got tight and I
got into my groove."
Forood was impressed by the
freshmen's mature performance.

"We had to remind the freshmen
that this was Cal," she said. "We re
minded them about the rivalry."
Irvin also didn't want to make a
habit out of losing to Cal.
"It was exciting to have the pres
sure on us freshmen," she said.
After all, before last February, Cal
hadn't beaten the Cardinal since
1993.
Junior Jennifer Heiser, playing
at the No. 5 singles spot, was the
only Stanford player to suffer a loss,
falling to Cal's Claire Curran in
three dramatic sets, 6-4,3-6,6-4.
Because Stanford clinched the
dual-match victory in singles play,
doubles was canceled. Kalvaria and
Ashley are fighting injury and
didn't want to aggravate the prob
lems with unnecessary doubles
competition.
"We beat Cal in singles without
having to play any doubles," Ash
ley said. "We're playing awesome
tennis. The team is coming together
mentally."
