# Gym looks to overcome history at West Regionals
## 
### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
Ever since the 1995 NCAA
Championships, the men's gym
nastics team has turned in progres
sively worse efforts season after
season. After winning three out of
four national championships be
tween 1992 and 1995. Stanford has
had increasingly unproductive
seasons.
In IWfi, the Cardinal finished

third and in 1997, it fell to a sixth
place standing. Last season Stan
ford appeared to hit rock bottom
when it finished the season with a
2-IN record and failed to qualify
for the NCAA Regionals.
This season however, a new
young, talented head coach, Sadao
Hamada, has engineered a dra
matic turnaround of a once stag
nating team.
While Stanford will not likely
capture another national champi

onship this season, but with a few
strong performances in the Re
gional competition the No. 12 Car
dinal will be in place to earn a cov
eted berth at the NCAA Champi
onships.
The Regionals, which will be
hosted by the Brigham Young
Cougars Saturday in Frovo, Utah,
will feature some of the most diffi
cult competitors that Stanford has
met this season. Both No. 5 Ne
braska and No. 7 Oklahoma fin

ished ahead of the Cardinal in the
March 26 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championship meet,
and Oklahoma had already
topped Stanford two weeks before
in the last regular match of the sea
son.
Stanford has also had tremen
dous difficulty in matchups with
the No. 11 Cougars this season. In
their first meeting, BYU easily
beat Stanford by a score of 222.95-
213.60. The next time they faced
each other, BYU squeaked past
Stanford by 15-hundredths of a
point — Stanford's narrowest
margin of defeat this season.
Its third loss against the
Cougars came a week later in the
UCLA Invitational. Although
Stanford did not lose again to
BYU in their last meeting, the
MPSF championship, the two
teams were head to head all night
and finished in a tie.
Though the Cardinal has been
unable to top the Cougars, the two
teams have become increasingly
competitive, mirroring the in
creasing level of confidence
among Stanford gymnasts.
Rather than dampening the ri
valry. Saturday's competition will
only further stoke the competi
tiveness between the two teams.
Since Nebraska and Oklahoma
will likely capture the top two po
sitions, only one of the remaining
three teams — BYU. Stanford and
California — will have the oppor
tunity to advance to the national
championships.
The teams that finish in fourth
and fifth place will go home
empty-handed.
Since California has a 1-10
record against the other teams this
season, in all probability it will be
the Cougars and the Cardinals
duking it out, both striving to keep
their seasons alive.
However, for the Cardinal to

overlook California or underesti
mate its ability would prove to be
a costly mistake. Although the de
fending national and two-time de
fending West Regional champions
have faltered this season — post
ing a 10-12 record — with a couple
of good breaks Cal can easily fin
ish ahead of either Stanford or
BYU.
But even though the Bears
have played very competitively
with BYU and Stanford and
topped the Cardinal earlier this
season, it will take a monumental
upset for the Bears to finish ahead
of either team which will be nec
essary in order for it to qualify for
the NCAA Championships.
Since the Cardinal cannot hope
to affect the other teams, it must
focus on improving its own perfor
mance to remain in the match and
hope for a few lucky breaks to en
sure a third-place finish.
"We are concerning ourselves
with our own routines," said se
nior co-captain Scott Finkelstein.
"We have to maintain our focus
and concentration on ourselves in J
order to be competitive."
Crucial to a victory will be the ;
performances of veterans such as ,
Finkelstein and junior co-captain '
Jason Katsampes.
Katsampes has been Stanford's •;
best all-around gymnast this sea- *
son and should turn in an excellent '*
performance in the all-around and
the pommel horse competitions, $
an area in which he ranks second -
in the Region.
In order to improve its concen- «
tration, the team has been working;
out twice a day for the past two
weeks. •;
"We need to keep our energy
high," Finkelstein said. "Our goal
will be to start on a real high note
and keep that energy level high
throughout the remainder of the
competition."
