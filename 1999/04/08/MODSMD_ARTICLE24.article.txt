# Women look to overcome Saturday's shaky victory against California
## Lacrosse ready for Bronco blowout 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
Last-second goals, an ever
changing score and double-sudden
death-overtime gave audiences a
thriller of a game last Saturday as
the Stanford women's lacrosse
team battled California to an 11-10
victory. But if fans are looking for a
repeat performance today as the
women travel to Santa Clara to face
the Broncos, they better go else
where.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ Today: Stanford (7-4.4-1 Western
Women's Lacrosse League) at Santa
Clara. 1 p.m.

In their first encounter on March
4, the Cardinal held the Broncos
scoreless for the first half as they
gave themselves a 15-0 lead, the
game ended 18-3. Head coach
Heidi Connor isn't expecting much
more competition in this game.
"I expect that this Thursday's
game against Santa Clara will be
very similar." Connor said. "I think
that we are the much stronger team,
and we will come out on top."
Although a blowout win may
seem to be a waste of time to a team
of Stanford's caliber, with her eyes
on playing well in postseason play,
Connor is hoping that the team will
be able to benefit from the game re
gardless of the score.
"It will be a great opportunity to
work on the things that we didn't
execute against Cal." Connor said,
such as "our transition defense,
transition offense and converting
from our set offense."
Despite Stanford's exciting win
over Cal, the team for the most part
was not pleased with its level of
play.
"For most of the game we were
sluggish," Connor said. "But it's
hard to come off a trip and know
how you're going to play."

Ideally the team would like to
bring its level of play back to where
it was over Spring Break on the
East Coast. Wins over such East
Coast teams' as Penn and Holy
Cross gave women confidence that
they can play up to the level of
tougher competition. But as senior
co-captain Alexis Patrizio ex
plained. it will have to make an ad
justment.
"East Coast teams play a differ
ent kind of game, and we played
amazingly well against Penn." Pa
trizio said. "Cal plays a completely
different kind of game. We showed
that we are able to adapt to differ
ent styles and to take control of the
game and make the other teams

play 'our style." "
'We showed that we are
able to adapt to different
styles and take control of
the game.'

As well as raising their play back
to where il was over spring break,
the women are also hoping to work
on playing as a team. Connor
doesn't point to any heroes that she
is counting on to carry the squad,
but rather believes that contribu
tions from the whole team are nec
essary to win a game.

In the first game against Santa
Clara, Connor was pleased by the
eontribution of the whole team,
and she is hoping for a similar per
formance on Thursday. "We will be
counting on every single player on
our team to make this win count."
A win against Santa Clara would
put the Cardinal that much closer to
its goal of finishing first in the
Women's Western Lacrosse
League, putting it in a good position
for the conference tournament.
Connor expects that the women will
face their toughest competition on
April 17 when they play UC-Davis.
Davis, like Stanford, has only had
one loss this season. Earlier this sea
son Stanford beat Davis 10-2.
