# Sailing sixth in Team Race, heads to the Bay

Fierce Atlantic coast conditions
and competition combined to chal
lenge the 14th-ranked Stanford sail
ing team in the Aaron Szambecki
Team Race hosted by Old Dominion
in Norfolk, Va., on March 27-28.
The coed Cardinal squad fought
to overcome both the unfamiliar
team-racing format and East Coast
storms to finish sixth in the strong
eight-team field. No. 4 College of
Charleston won the race. Stanford
was the only West Coast team to
compete, beating eighth-ranked
Georgetown and 17th-ranked Uni
versity of Rhode Island.
Stanford was surprised by strong
winds, which gusted up to 25 knots,
and two- to three-foot waves. Ac
cording to senior co-captain Taylor
Robinson, the team is used to practic
ing and competing in more flatwater

conditions with only slight breezes.
Additionally, the team format of
the race differed from the fleet-racing
format in which the Cardinal usually
excels. Under the team-racing for
mat, which is more frequently seen in
East Coast competition, each school
fields three boats. As a team, these
three boats race against the three
boats of competing schools in rota
tion.

ished sixth at the Aaron Szambecki
Team Race.
■ Saturday-Sunday: No. 14 Stanford
at the St. Francis Yacht Club Inter
sectional in San Francisco.

According to Robinson, the harsh
weather for Stanford's 10 Saturday
races and four Sunday races left the

squad drained. "By the end of the
day, we were really tired," Robinson
said. "Everyone was."
However, Robinson also noted
that with the high level of competi
tion in the race and unfamiliar for
mat, the team was pleased by its per
formance. "We were actually pretty
happy with it," she said. "We're not as
good at team racing."
The Cardinal women's team trav
eled to Boston's Charles River on
April 3, where it placed third overall
in the President's Cup. As the top
seeded team on the West Coast, the
women joined the elite field of 12
teams that competed in the regatta.
Host school Boston University, the
No. 2 team in the nation, won the re
gatta. The sixth-ranked Tufts Univer
sity women finished second.
Junior skipper Anika Leerssen
and sophomore Alexis Krikovich
turned in an impressive first-place fin

ish in the A Division. Their placing,
combined with the third-place finish
of junior skipper Sally Madsen and
junior Allie Bell, was enough to place
the Stanford women ahead of nine
other teams in the strong field.
Leerssen's return to the Cardinal
squad after a winter quarter break
makes her success especially promis
ing for the team later in the season.
"We were very happy with our
performance," Leerssen said, "espe
cially since [Krikovich and IJ are just
getting back together in the boat."
The regatta was limited to one day
of competition, short of the usual two
days of racing, due to stormy weather.
According to Leerssen, Saturday's
conditions were reasonably breezy,
with winds around 15 knots. Howev
er, forecasts of rain, hail and snow
threatened to interrupt round-robin
competition on Sunday. As a result,
final places were given after the 18

races completed on Saturday.
On Saturday and Sunday, the en
tire Cardinal squad will compete on
San Francisco Bay in the St. Francis
Yacht Cluh Intersectional.
The coed race is an important
check lor the team, as it is the last rac
ing regatta before the district champi
onship. in which two teams will quali
fy for the national championship
race. Robinson predicts that condi
tions should be similar to those in the
district race, which will be held May
1 -3 in Monterey.
Stanford's main challengers for
national qualifying spots, including
USC, UC-Santa Barbara and 1 fawaii.
will be competing at the Intersection
al.
"It's pretty much a practice run for
the district championships." Robin
son said. "We're hoping to be in the
top two. because that indicates we'll
likely be going to nationals."
