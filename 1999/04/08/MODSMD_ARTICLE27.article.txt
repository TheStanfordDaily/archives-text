# Accomodating 'hearts'
## Program provides housing for families of patients at children's hospital 
### Ilya Beylin 
Providing a place to stay for less well-off
parents whose children are patients at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, the Ho
tels With a Heart Program continues into its
second year of helping to allay costs for these
families.
Started in 1997 by Erin Champion, who
now heads the program as its housing pro
grams manager. Hotels With a Heart selects
and houses families who would be burdened
to pay the costs of a stay in the pricey sur
rounds of Palo Alto, but who must accompa
ny their children to the hospital.
"Our first year was excellent," said Cham
pion. "Two hundred families were placed at
no charge, and it was not necessary to turn

anyone away."
The families that are helped by the pro
gram are chosen on two main criteria: their
financial status and their home's location.
They are chosen from among the families left
unhoused by the Ronald McDonald pro
gram, and the program prefers to take those
families that live more than 50 miles away.
"The families selected are financially lim
ited and are turned away the Ronald Mc-
Donald." Champion said.
"If they live more than 50 miles away, that
is also a consideration, but we do make ex
ceptions for families that don't necessarily
live that far away," she said.
After being chosen by the program, the
families are then distributed among the ho
tels that volunteer for the program.

The Hotels With a Heart organization it
self focuses its energies on appropriating
more donations by approaching hotels and
gathering donations.
Some of the biggest room donors are Pa
cific Hotels, a hotel chain that has eight of its
hotels participating in the program, and the
Cardinal Hotel on Hamilton and Emerson
Streets in Palo Alto, which is the single
biggest donor of complimentary lodging.
A further development started by Hotels
With a Heart is the Host Home Program,
which has the same lodging question as its
focus.
Host Home aims to provide the same ser
vice but through the private volunteering of
local homeowners.
Relying on these homeowners, the pro

gram also relies on donations which are used
partly to provide the volunteers with reim
bursement of up to $10 a day. ' •
ALZA Corporations, a locally based
pharmaceutical company, has donated over
$45,(XX) to be used by the program, but the
program is still looking for volunteers. ,*
"We're hoping to engage more Spani?vh
speaking churches, because most of our fam
ilies speak Spanish primarily," Champion
said. <•!
"The need is unbelievable. Without this
[program] people would be sleeping in hos
pital halls and cars. When they come to us. all
the resources available to them have been
exhausted," Champion said.
