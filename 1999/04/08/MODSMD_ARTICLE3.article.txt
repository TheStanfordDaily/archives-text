With their platform focusing on
"experience, dedication and vi
sion." sophomore Mike Levin and
doctoral student John Mills hope
to assume the positions of ASSU
president and vice president, re
spectively.
The two bring a great deal of
experience to the campaign. In his
two years of involvement with the
ASSLI, Levin has risen to the posi
tion of senate deputy chair.
In that role he works on pro
jects within the senate and, togeth
er with the senate chair, compiles

candidates for ASSU president and vice president, respectively.
and prepares for senate
meetings.
In addition Levin works with the
10 freshman associate senators.
. 'Mills won his senate seat unex
pectedly thanks to write-in votes
from friends but accepted the seat,
us it was "an opportunity to do
something rewarding."
Mills is also a member of the
(iraduate Student Council and was
involved this year in planning the
ASMIJ's Dead Week Midnight
Breakfast.
• 'The team's vision centers
nrotmd "balancing the stuff [in the
ASSUJ that works now with new
creative ideas. We want to make a

real effort to listen to the students,"
Levin said.
One of their new projects,
termed "Recycle Your Cycle," will
organize the donation of unwanted
bikes of graduating students. The
ASSU will have the bikes stored by
the Stanford police over the sum
mer, fixed up by a student mechan
ic, and sold to students in the fall for
$50 or less.
Another new idea, the "Lighted
Corridor Project," will work to
ward providing more lighted paths
for students to travel at night. Signs
will be put on lamp posts directing
students to well-lit paths. In addi
tion they will work to increase the
lighting in areas of campus that are
too dark at night.
Levin and Mills want to contin
ue to improve dining quality and

service. Levin and the senate asso
ciates conducted a survey of about
S(X) students this year, asking about
several aspects of campus dining.
"There is not enough student
input on what types of food they
serve and what kinds of facilities
there are," Levin said. "We want to
open up these decisions to the stu
dents and then present their an
swers to the appropriate people in
the University."
Continued improvement of the
online course guide is also one of
their plans. "We hope to expand
and publicize it more," Levin said.
In addition. Levin and the sen
ate associates have been working
on the online Draw guide, a Web
site that will have a listing of all
Stanford residences, ratings of
their food, rooms, cleanliness and

comments from residents.
This site should be on the Web
in time for this year's draw, but
Levin and Mills plan to continue
improving it next year.
Levin also mentioned plans to
extend the nighttime hours of the
basketball courts, as students are
often kicked off and threatened
with arrest by campus police.
Mills, as a graduate student,
hopes to facilitate the GSC's efforts
to address issues specific to gradu
ate students such as dental care
through Cowell and health care op
tions for spouses and children.
In addition Mills wants the
ASSU to take a more active role in
planning graduate student social
events.
He and Levin pointed out the
relatively small amount of interac

tion that undergraduates and grad
uate students have and want to in
crease it if they are elected.
Levin and Mills both see having
a graduate student in the office of
vice president as a great asset.
"Having an undergraduate presi
dent and graduate vice president is
the clearest way to represent the
two populations," Levin said.
It is the first time since the single
presidency was reinstituted three
years ago that a graduate student
has run for either position.
"This has been a long time com
ing," said Mills. "It's good lor grad
uate students and fully legitimizes
the ASSU."
Levin and Mills were two of the
authors of the amendment to form
separate graduate and undergradu
ate senates in the ASSU. They see

the amendment as "complemen
tary to what we want to do," Levin
said.
Mills said that a graduate stu
dent as vice president along with
the amendment would "bring
[graduate students] more fully
under the ASSU umbrella. We're
really reaching out to everyone on
campus."
"We're not here to serve our
selves, we're here to serve others,"
Levin said. "The most important
thing is being passionate about
what you're doing. We're doing
this, because it's what we believe
in."
Mills defined the dedication part
of their campaign as his and Levin's
commitment to "maintain and
strengthen what's already been es
tablished this past year."
