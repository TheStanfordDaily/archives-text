## THE
						LAST TEMPTATION OF MUSICALS! Ram's Head production of' Jesus Christ Superstar 
### 
f~~yQ «nce it was first released in 1970, controversy has surrounded Andrew :lr
C Lloyd Weber and Tun Rice's rock opera, "Jesus Christ Superstar." The
hit musical, which portrays the last seven days of Christ's life through
the perspective of Judas, has been criticized and protested against by those who
consider it irreverent In Argentina, one theater that dared to present the musi-

cal was actually burned down!
Though Ram's Head expects to avoid such violent reactions this
weekend, its production of "Superstar" promises to be explosive. Instead
of the usual 1970s take on the musical, Ram's Head has chosen to set the
show in "a pre-apocalyptic era," said producer Molly McKew, a senior.
"This show is done a lot differently than 'JCS' is normally done," said
director Dale Stahl, a sophomore. The Ram's Head production will fea-

ture "a modern, futuristic world, a pretty violent, oppressive culture," Stahl
added, creating an aura that he called 'Very sleek." McKew described the cos
tuming, sets and lighting as all having a "rock concert-ish" feel. Freshman John
Medina, who plays Herod, said this production of "ICS" will be "like experienc
ing a club."
If you haven't yet heard the high energy music of "Superstar," you are in for a
treat As sophomore Yoav Schlesinger, who plays Judas, said, the musical has "no
boring parts." Because it is a rock opera, "Superstar" has no spoken lines, which
keeps the show tight and fast-paced. Songs are simultaneously passionate and
hip. Choreography amplifies the passion of the music.

But more than its sleek surface, human emotion and human relationships are
the focus of this version of "Jesus Christ Superstar"
"This show is very much about people rather than religion. We've tried to
bring out those aspects for a show more relevant to the 1990s than the 19705,
Stahl said. Ram's Head chose to fully develop the implied relationship between

Jesus and Mary Magdalene, a relationship that has been one ot the
key issues in the protests against "Superstar" Also, look for a new,
very '90s flavor in John Medina's characterization of Herod.
The talented and dedicated cast of "Superstar" has the capacity to
pull off a clean, fabulous show. Senior Nathan Reed, a member of
Everyday People, shines in the title role of Jesus, as does Schlesinger
as Judas. Junior Rebecca Hanover beautifully portrays the role of

Mary Magdalene. Other lead performers include junior Scott Redly as Pontius
Pilate, sophomore John Medina as Herod, sophomore Galen Davis as Caiaphas
and senior John Knag as Annus.
Reed acknowledged that some people might be offended by the show. "Don't
come expecting robes and the Bible," he said. Actor Bill Hanson, a sophomore,
added, "This production raises questions for debate and challenges faith." I know
that the Stanford audience is up for the challenge. And from what I saw in
rehearsal on Saturday, this production is guaranteed to be a hit
