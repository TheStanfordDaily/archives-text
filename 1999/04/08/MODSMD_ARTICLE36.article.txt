# SIZZLING DANCE FOR A COOL CITY
## 'Forever Tango' comes to SF 
### 
orever Tango" is a jubilant
piece of work. A fantastic
combination of racy dancing,
sharp technique and humor, the production
is set to Lisandor Adrover's arrangement of
sorrowful and sensuous music.
The origins of tango are suprisingly suspi
cious. This form of music originated in the
brothels of early 19th-century Argentina. A
product of the new immigrants' anguish,
tango was a combination of African slave
drums, Argentinean flatland music and
Indian rhythms mixed with the Spanish
colonists' style and Latin roots. The purpose
of the tango was to act out the interaction
between the prostitute and her pimp.
Luis Bravo's troupe portrays this abrasive
relationship between a woman and a man
with skill. The men are the epitome of
"machito" — they appear wary, unable to
crack a smile. Meanwhile the female sexpots
smile loosely and use their bodies with
absolute abandon. In particular, two dancers
stood out. Hector Mayoral scowled as hard as
he could, but the audience could tell that it
was a huge effort for him not to show how
much he was enjoying himself. Every time he
would start to smile, he would over-compen
sate by putting on a grimace that would scare
his own mother. Though all of the females
were impressive with their flashy footwork,
Karina Piazza caught my eye. She was not
only stunning, but her ballet-trained foot
work brought an extra polish to her dancing.
She made each step precise and at the same
time elegant. Though less flamboyant than
some of the other dancers; the result was ele-

gant and stylish.
Each couple
had its own par
ticular style, some
humorous, others
deeply pained and
exotic. The couple
Luis Castro and

Claudia Mendoza was particularly amusing.
They danced several pieces together such as
"Luis 'machito' Castro," where the dance
served as a dialogue between the two people
and Castro dragged Mendoza like a Raggedy
Ann doll through different positions.
The music was a strange brew of solo
accordion, virtuoso violin and the singing of
a man who much resembled an Argentinean
Julio Iglesias. But somehow it all worked. The
violin solo was an anguished cadenza of
string crossings and difficult staccato phras
es, all done with flair and panache. In addi
tion, the music director on the accordion was
mesmerizing. He compressed and expanded
the accordion with an array of facial contor
tions. Carlos Morel, the Argentinean Iglesias,
sang well, interspersing his songs with a dia
logue in Spanish that I wish I understood.
The mood was distinct from anything I've
ever seen in a dance medium.
In total, this production is worth the price
and effort it takes to make a trip up to San
Francisco. A magical, almost heady combina
tion of sight, sex and sound leaves the audi
ence hot and bothered — and ready to set
the streets on fire....
