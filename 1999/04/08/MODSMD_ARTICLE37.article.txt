# 18 LETTERS' A LAME, LAME, LAME OPERA

l This was the predominant reaction to "Ravenshead," the one-

man opera at the Berkeley Repertory Theater that closed

Sunday. If you missed it, don't worry:

those who saw "Ravenshead"

probably wished they'd

missed it, too. During

inter-

mis
sion,
th e

stage man-

ager had to flash

the lights five times
(instead of the usual two)

before people begrudgingly
dawdled back to their seats
for the rest of the perfor
mance.
Based on the true story of
Donald Crowhust (whom
the Richard Ravenshead

character is based on), the
premise is this: a British
man sets sail around the

world in 1968, goes crazy
somewhere in the middle
of the Atlantic and steps
off his boat into the ocean

on Day 243.
Now there's a one-man opera!
Apparently, this was the thought of Rinde Eckert, who wrote and starred
in the one-man fiasco.
One of the many problems with "Ravenshead" is that it lacks passionate
interaction between characters since it's a solo show. Even the term "opera"
is misleading, because most of the show is one man talking aloud to him-

self in a manner that could be mistaken for screaming at the front row
of the audience.
Most of the play consists of Ravenshead's constant screaming and pop-

ping out of trap doors in the middle of the stage. Historians know
Ravenshead went crazy during his voyage because of logbooks found
aboard. However, during the show, we are never sure what sanity he has
left to lose. Presumably the 10-minute sequence in which Eckert yells at

his transistor radio is the staging of his mental descent. Then what do we

make of his sanity during the rest of the play? It's hard to care if the
hero reaches his downfall when it seems as though he's already been

there for two hours.
It often seemed as though the librettist (and Eckert as well) didn't
have enough inspiration for an entire opera because he used different

permutations of the same words over and over again. A frequent, though

irritating, combination was: "Ravenshead. 17 letters. 17. A prime number.
Ravens. Head." Eckert would do well to stick to just singing, where he has
an amazing vocal range. His talent, as well as that of the Paul Dresher
Ensemble, which accompanied him, would have been better served else
where. Perhaps in private.
While the Berkeley Rep usually offers wonderful reasons to head to
Berkeley, "Ravenshead" was not one of them. If you missed it, you can eas
ily emulate the experience by singing to yourself in the shower.
Over and over again.
