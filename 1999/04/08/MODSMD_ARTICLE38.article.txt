Though we realized that we were putting
our patriotism into question, we were not
deterred from trying the Cuban restaurant, La
Bodeguita del Medio. Located near campus on
exciting California Avenue, this restaurant
offers traditional Cuban dishes in a relaxing
Caribbean environment. La Bodeguita del
Medio is the sister restaurant of the one locat
ed in Havana, Cuba. Similar to its famed com
panion, our local version offers a sociable envi
ronment for eating and drinking.
We found "La Bodeguita del Medio" to be

among the most appropriately decorated
restaurants in the area. Upon entering, the vis r
itor sees the full length of the bar, which wraps
the diner in a feeling of social camaraderie. The
enclosed dining room has a much more serene
feel to it. Its walls are decorated with Cuban
advertisements and other pictures from the
restaurant's homeland. We had the unexpected
pleasure of dining under the watchful eye of
Santiago from"The Old Man and the Sea." The
combination of the washed-yellow sponged
walls with the stone-washed wooden beams on
the ceiling gave the effect of dining in a true
Havana hotel.
We were kindly greeted at the door and seat
ed at a super-comfortable bench table. Our
waitress quickly recommended the house spe
cialty drink, the Mojito, which is made of citrus
rum, real leaves of mint, sugar, fresh citrus
juice and a splash a soda. We sipped these and
a couple more of these tasty cocktails until our
appetizers were served. Adrien had a delicious
thin-cut seared ahi tuna with wasabi cream and
mango salsa. The wasabi cream and soft mango
texture truly brought out the best taste in the
tuna. David opted for the traditional Cuban
fare of tasty but spicy plantain chips and salsa.
We washed down the hors d'oeuvres with two
oyster shooters. These spicy shots included
rum, worscheter sauce, flakes of horseradish

and, for an added bonus, a raw oyster at the
bottom. While we were slightly apprehensive
before taking the shots, we found them very
tasty.
As for our main dishes, David enjoyed the
seared seabass with a black bean salsa. It was
accompanied with uniquely sweet and salty
sweet potato fries and a variety of tender veg
etables. Adrien decided to try the steak and
tiger prawn combination referred to in some
circles as Tierra y Mar. The large prawns were
wrapped up in the thinly sliced skirt steak and
served with a number of different vegetables
including carrots and zucchini. The meal was
also served with exquisite tomato mashed
potatoes. We finished our meal with a rich
coconut and hot banana flan and a cup of
sweat Cuban coffee.
Rather than let our article drag on like one
of Fidel's speeches, we simply recommend that
you try La Bodeguita del Medio for yourself.
Quick Notes:
Distance: 5 minutes
Parking: At your own risk
Ambiance: Relaxed
liquor: Full bar, interesting
variety of Cuban cocktails
Service: Very good
