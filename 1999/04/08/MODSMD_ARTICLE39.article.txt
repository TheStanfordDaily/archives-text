# COVER STORY
## Father of a play Protean Stanford Prof. Carl Djerassi gives birth to 'An Immaculate Misconception' 
### Joshua Robin Contributing Writer 
wind howling outside, Carl Djerassi, Stanford chemistry
C\y professor and internationally renowned scientist, talked
ethics from his penthouse high above San Francisco's
Russian Hill. A 360-degree city view worthy of an issue of National
Geographic surrounded him and his guests. Prized art and painted
poem fragments covered almost every inch of the apartment walls.
The topic was ethics of reproduction and Djerassi, eyes focused on
his guests, was answering the question "Where does life begin?"
"I'm not a person who trivializes life at all," Djerassi said. "I see fer
tilization and life as two separate components. An embryo cannot live
outside of the human body. It cannot live on its own."
It was a student's dream — sitting in a San Francisco penthouse,
gawking at views of the city from a point higher than the top of the Bay
Bridge and debating scientific ethics with the man who first synthesized
the birth control pill.
The talk went on for 20 minutes before its first lull.
"You are going to write something about my play, aren't you?"
Djerassi asked, a wry smile wrinkling under his gray beard.
But Djerassi's first play, "An Immaculate Misconception," lay subtly
in the background of the entire discussion. "Misconception," appearing
at the Eureka Theater in the Embarcadero area of San Francisco, is
essentially a story of scientific and reproductive ethics, topics Djerassi
has made central to his life. His controversial work on the pill earned
him the 1973 National Medal of Science and forever changed the
world's sexual culture.
"Misconception," Djerassi's debut as a playwright, is based on the
latter portions of his 1997 novel "Menachem's Seed." It tells the story of
Melanie Laidlaw, a reproduction scientist who discovers ICSI (intracy
toplasmic sperm injection), a procedure whereby the formation of a
human embryo takes place outside of a woman's body, under a micro
scope: a single sperm is snared by a tiny needle and then injected
through the flexible outer membrane of an egg.

In actuality, ICSI has been a scientific procedure for a decade and&JP
been especially important in treating male infertility. Nearly 10,000
ICSI babies have been born since it was discovered. The debate over the
procedure has been limited mostly to academia, though recently it has
crept closer to the mainstream. Andrew Niccols' 1997 science
film "Gattaca" extrapolated ICSI technology into a "Brave New World"
dystopia.
ICSI is more than just another form of in vitro fertilization: it
bypasses nature's sperm selection process. Normally, millions of swim
ming sperm compete to be the single one that will fertilize an egg. In
ICSI, that selection is done by a scientist who literally picks the single
sperm to be thrust into an egg at the plunge of the doctor's pipette.
Improving technology will soon allow scientists to predetermine
mutations and diseases from the smallest of samples, perhaps even
from a single sperm. If that became the case, ICSI scientists and their
patients would be able to pick and choose the sperm and egg to be used
in the fertilization process based on which carry markings of genetic
problems and which don't.
Djerassi's play raises the ethical stakes by making Laidlaw, a scientist
and widow in her late 30s, play both doctor and patient by using her
own ova in the ICSI experiment and then implanting eggs in her
uterus.
Yet another ethical dilemma: Laidlaw tries going to a sperm bank
where she can use anonymous sperm for the experiment, but dislikes
the impersonality of the process. She has also fallen in love with an
Israeli nuclear engineer, Menachem Dvir, whom she meets at a science
congress in Europe. Even though Dvir is married and has become infer
tile in an accidental exposure to radiation (meaning he has a severely
depleted — but not empty — sperm count), the two have an affair and,
post-coitus, Melanie cops a used condom from their night together
without his knowing and preserves it in dry ice.
Melanie is blinded by her feelings for Dvir and ignores the fact that
his sperm is unhealthy and could lead to a deformed child, potentially
giving humanity a terrible impression of the world's first ICSI baby.
Back in the lab, she uses one of his few feeble sperm as the male por
tion of ICSI's maiden voyage, disregarding the advice of her partner in
the experiment, infertility specialist Felix Frankenthaler. Incensed and
mercilessly hungry for his own prestige, Frankenthaler decides to

respond with extreme measures — yet another moral dilemma for the
audience to ponder.
Djerassi said that he intends for "An Immaculate Misconception" to
encourage the whole of society to argue about ethical issues that, he
said, are all too often left to the very doctors whose discoveries are in
debate and who stand to reap abundant rewards from their experi
ments' success.
"I want to make the viewers aware of the issues," Djerassi said. 1
don't want them to run out of the

theater to coffee or to bed. I want
them to stay in the theater and
argue."

"I want to smuggle what I con
sider important scientific issues
... into the mind of people," he
said.

Unfortunately, much of the
acting in the San Francisco pro
duction of "Misconception,"
especially that of Laidlaw

(Denise Balthrop Cassidy) and
Frankenthaler (Paul Sulzman), is

flat and forced. As a result, either

audiences will tire of the play entire
ly — and the issues that go along with

it — or, weary only of the acting, will
perhaps turn to their neighbor for conver-

I r — o
sation on the ethical questions the play creates.
But not all of the acting is flawed. Dvir is played well by Peter Vilkin,
who perfected Dvir's Israeli accent and manly Sabra demeanor. Zack
Kenney, playing Adam (of course the name of the first ICSI human
being), is superb. Though the role is cut out of the play s other produc
tions currently running in Europe, Kenney enhances the Bay areas ver
sion.
"An Immaculate Misconception" is an impressive beginning for a

new playwright who began writing fiction at 62 and, now, at 75, drama.
The story and dialogue are for the most part engaging and vivid,
although it does drag on at times, especially after the intermission. It
could be condensed into a one-act play without losing much.
Djerassi admits that the play's humor is at times corny, but many of
the lines are indeed funny, reminiscent of Woody Allen or the short sto
ries of Jonathan Wilson. "Misconception" also gracefully explains the
complicated science to theatergoers who might not be familiar with
reproductive chemistry or

interested in learning
about it on a Friday night.
The San Francisco pro
duction, by the Eureka and
Djerassi's son Dale, is tech
nologically impressive. The
audience reads e-mail mes
sages from the characters

and viewers watch an ICSI
fertilization on an over
sized, circular screen — an
interesting, if slightly discon-

certing, experience.

Djerassi clearly relishes

"Misconception's" success at

home and abroad. Each new

question about the play jolts him

upright in his chair or sends him to a

bursting scrapbook in which he keeps reviews and mementos. His
study — lined with books and with a postcard view of the Bay — is also
decorated with placards from the play.
It is questionable whether Djerassi's play will succeed in provoking
debate on a large scale. During some of the play's slower sections, I dis
cussed reproductive ethics with my guest at the play. The need for wide
spread awareness is there. "An Immaculate Misconception" alludes to
important issues concerning all of humanity.
