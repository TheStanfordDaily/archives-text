Presidential candidate
David Lampson and run
ning mate Owen Ellickson
were disqualified from the
ASSU presidential race yes
terday when ASSU Elec-

tions Commissioner Jason Kang discovered
that Lampson is not a registered student.
Lampson's departure means that sopho
more Michael Levin will be the only presiden
tial candidate with his name on the ballot.
However, junior Adam Weiss, the senate
chair, has begun a write-in campaign for the
presidency with running mate junior Jonathan
Lotz.
Both the ASSU Constitution and Universi
ty policy require that all student leadership po
sitions be held by registered students. Kang ex
pressed regret in ruling Lampson's candidacy
ineligible.
"It is unfortunate that he is not running,
and it is unfortunate that there are not as
many candidates this year. It is always nice
when there is more choice for the student
hodv," he said.
Levin was also disappointed to hear of
Lampson and Owen's disqualification.
"They're funny. They would've brought a
unique campaign. The more the merrier," he
said.
Levin stated that Lampson's removal from
the race will change nothing in his own cam
paign.
Kang said that, upon hearing of his dis
qualification, Lampson said that he did not
read the election rules carefully enough.
Lampson could not be reached for comment.
Lampson's slate was sponsored by the
Hammer and Coffin society, which publishes
the Stanford Chaparral, on a platform entitled,
" Twin Mountains of Pure Freedom."
His proposals included a McDonald's in
Tresidder, a Pizza Hut in Roble with free pizza
after 3 p.m. and a 24-hour Marguerite system.
