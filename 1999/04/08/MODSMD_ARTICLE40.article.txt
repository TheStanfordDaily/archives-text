## THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS Crust Brothers Marquee Mark (Telemomo Records) 
### 
was the kind of night that usually ends
112 Win disaster: a one-off charity concert by a
€. poorly rehearsed "super group" doing
nothing but covers. But somehow the Crust
Brothers — consisting of the Seattle post-punk
group Silkworm and Stephen Malkmus of
Pavement — managed to pull off one of the most
exciting and interesting concerts of recent years.
I'ortunately the show was recorded and is now
available as an "official bootleg" directly from the
Silkworm Web site (http://www.cnw.com/
~elephant/skwm/).
A quick glance at the set list shows that this was
anything but your standard night of bar band cov
ers. The first five songs are all from Bob Dylan and
The Band's "The Basement Tapes," which is possi
bly his best work and certainly his most unusual.
The show starts with a bang. Someone mutters
"born to choogle" (a reference to Credence
Clearwater Revival's famous "choogling" style), and
the band launches into a raucous "Coin' To
Acapulco." While Dylan's version is a wailing, hope
less dirge, the Crust Brothers completely refashions
it into a wide-eyed swamp rocker. It shouldn't
work, but it does, thanks largely to Malkmus' sinu
ous guitar riff and the ecstasy of the vocals.
The other "Basement Tapes" songs work nearly
as well, though they stumble a bit on "Lo and
Behold" and "You Ain't Coin' Nowhere." "Yazoo
Street Scandal" is particularly good — loud, fast
and even scarier than The Band's original version.
After the band's five-song foray into "The
Basement Tapes" the Crust Brothers returns to
more standard territory, doing covers of bands like
the Byrds, the Rolling Stones and, yes, Credence at
the same high level of intensity. They even "cover"
a Silkworm song by having Malkmus sing "Never
Met a Man I Didn't Like."
"Heard It Through the Grapevine" is magnifi
cent, as is "Feel a Whole Lot Better." The cover of
the Rolling Stones' "Bitch" doesn't quite work, but
it's still a good time. The highlight, however, is the

finale. After the inevitable request for "Free Bird,"
the band obliges the audience with a lovely cover of
Lynrd Skynrd's "Tuesday's Gone," which segues
into a hard-rocking version of the "Basement
Tapes" song "Please, Mrs. Henry." It's a transcen
dent rock 'n' roll moment.
"Marquee Mark" is certainly not for everyone.
The Crust Brothers is sloppy as hell, the singing is
ragged and the songs sound like they were

rehearsed five minutes before the show.
But with its party atmosphere and raw
intensity, it's one of the few live albums
able to convey the feeling of one of
those nights when, with enough beer
and volume, a mediocre bar band trans
forms itself for a moment into the best
band in the world.
