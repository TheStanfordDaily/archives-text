## New Dawning Time (Subpop / Naughty Panther) 
### 
/"T\ a title like "New Dawning Time," I
(JJr/jf sort of expected Gardener's debut
v album to be reminiscent of the psyche
delic era. But Gardener's members hail from such
Washington state bands as Screaming Trees and
Seaweed, so ... it's rather reminiscent of the grunge
era as well. I can't quite decide which era wins out.
But the mere presence of a sitar is kind of
appalling.
It's an interesting idea, though, to combine the
two. I hate to use the term provided for me by the
press release, but "shack rock" fits rather well.
Between the eclectic arrangements and slightly lo
fi production, it sounds like some sort of weekend
jam party by an obscure Love cover band from
Seattle. Does that make any sense and / or sound
appealing?
"New Dawning Time" is not bad, but it certain
ly does not live up to the ambitious Utopian rock
which the title promises. The thick atmosphere of
guitars, flutes and mellotron brings warmth and
familiarity to decent midtempo pop songs like
"Tamed" and "Backseat," while adding complexity
to the recovery-and-survival paean that's titled,
um, "Struggle with Sickness." Meanwhile, rockers
like "Outside Looking In"and "(You Wear The)
Raincoat" could be great, but they sound too mud
dled and need much stronger drums.
Also alternately pleasing and frustrating are
Aaron Stauffer's lead vocals. He is a casualty of the
early '90s with his quavering, scratchy moans and
screams. He sounds like bad grunge karaoke on
some songs. On a few lovely moments, though, he
adopts a cool nasal drawl that's reminiscent of
Dylan-via-Grant Lee Buffalo, yet somehow rather
original as well. Oh well, maybe in another five
years.
