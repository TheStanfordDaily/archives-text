# Make-Up
## I Want Some (K Records) 
### 
/T\ D.C.'s Make-Up is the mod
ern punk gospel machine. lames Canty,
v Steve Gamboa, Michelle Mae and lan
"the Spiv" Svenonius churn out records faster than
I can hear you say "Yeah," and they incessantly tour
all over the world (the band is in Sweden as I write
this). For the last four years or so the Make-Up has
been feeding the masses with its tight recipe of
style-saturated gospel-funk-psych-rock in a bap
tismal spectacle that borders on performance art.
The band's latest release, "I Want Some," collects
more than 70 minutes of music from the Make
up's countless vinyl 7-inch singles onto one slick
looking CD and a beautiful double gatefold LP.
Spanning its career to date, this album includes
some of the band's best work, such as tracks from
its earliest singles which have been long out of
print. These early songs display the Make-Up at its
finest: raw and minimal, yet chaotic, urgent and
unrestrained. On the bass-driven "Trans-Pleasant
Express," Svenonius plays sexy and pants into the
mic over an infectiously rhythmic groove: "Come
on and take a walk with me / Yeh-Yeh Get me on
your leash / I'll swear I'm easy to feed."
You may remember the Make-Up's members
from their old bands (in the early '90s the boys
were in the legendary punk outfit Nation of Ulysses
and bassist Mae was in the punky-garagey
Frumpies) and wonder to yourself, what happened?
How did these formidable punk-rockers turn into
skinny ascot-wearing sissies? And unlike the Nation
of Ulysses' fiercely anti-retro, anti-rock *n' roll
dogma, the Make-Up's neo-retro aesthetic borrows
heavily from such circa-'6os heroes as Love's
Arthur Lee and French New Wave film director
Jean Luc Godard. Maybe it's just that rock 'n' roll's
recently alleged "death" — along with the surge of
"post-rock" bands on college airwaves — doesn't
leave this band with much room for that now-pass 6
"anti-rock" stance, anyway. So, the Make-Up has
taken it upon itself to energize the present by reviv
ing the "holy ghosts" of past.
Other album highlights include the band's ren
dition of the old gospel standard "Wade in the
Water" and the frenetically psychotic "Untouchable
Sound" as well as "Walking on the Dune" — a love
song that chants sweetly: "U. R. my intended." And

Svenonius — whom Sassy magazine once
crowned the "Sassiest Boy in America" —
gets even more over-the-top in the album's
more recently recorded opening tracks, with
his hoarse trademark scream (d)evolving
into a melange of ecstatic begging, obnox
ious squeals and a lot of heavy breathing.
Such overblown theatrics are exactly what
make the Make-Up so simultaneously
annoying and entertaining. The band's
name says it all; this is mythologized — and
occasionally hilarious — fiction-music
delivered with devout sincerity.
