## Square Root of Negative One (Asphodel Records) 
### 
A /ew York futurists, artists and
/§/ sound designers We have been at
r the forefront of the experimental
electronica movement, and its latest release
shows that the group is still extending its
boundaries. "Square Root of Negative One,"
We's second release on the Asphodel label,
combines the intricacies of the jungle break
beat with layered atmospherics that seem to
grab hold of the body and entangle the
mind with awe.
The group, comprised of DJ Olive, Lloop
and Once 11, puts forth an album that is
almost as dynamic as its individual tracks.
There are some heavy-hitting floor movers,
along with some dub-influenced mellower
tracks and some more ambient-based songs
that together reveal We's experimental,
artistic side while still showing an apprecia
tion for danceable beats.
"12_Diablos" and "Back and Forth" —
two of the more interesting drum and bass
tracks 1 have heard in a while — most defi
nitely hit a nerve and will quite literally
make you want to get up and move. Both
songs have manic hard-hitting beats and
some great bass elements, some of them
sunken deep inside the song, others crunch
ing away at the forefront. But the thing that
separates these tracks from the grips of
more straightforward drum and bass is their
ability to maintain a "get-up-and-dance"
rhythm while never letting go of their elab
orate complexity.
As electronic music continues down the
road of popularity, We's "Square Root of
Negative One" succeeds in forcing the genre
in a new direction and pushing experimen
tal drum and bass to new levels.
