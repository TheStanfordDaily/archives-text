# THIS WEEK'S MINI REVIEWS
## Velocette Fourfold Remedy (Beggar's Banquet) 
### 
s~T\ i elocette is the newest "next big thing from
Cq/yT England," having hit critical paydirt with
£/ its 1997 debut single, "Get Yourself
Together." The band — featuring ex-members of
London's northern-soul-pop combo Comet
Gain — has now completed its first album,
"Fourfold Remedy," which is full of flowing vocals,
chiming guitars and lush backgrounds.
Unfortunately, the music is terminally bland. Not a
single hook is to be found, and Sarah Bleach, the
group's lead singer, utterly fails to bite into any of
the lyrics. Thus, she drifts along like a ghost, leav
ing the listener to wonder if this whole affair was
just one bad dream.
