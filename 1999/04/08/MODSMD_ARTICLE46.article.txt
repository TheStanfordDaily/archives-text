s jyr he cover of Versus' new EP, "Afterglow" is
CXf a black-and-white photo of three kids
C— * holding dixie cups. Yawn. The back
cover, though, consists of a spectacular mushroom
cloud saturated in red and orange. Like the covers
which hold it, "Afterglow" seems, on the surface,
like a bland reformulation of post-Pavement indie.
Something happens after the third or fourth time
you listen to it, though, that's rather surprising: the
slow-to-loud climaxes somehow no longer seem
inevitable. I don't know how they did it, but this
whole EP is a subtle tour de force.
