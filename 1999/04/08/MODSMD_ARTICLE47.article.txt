# The
						Queers
## Later Days and Setter Lays (Lookout! Records) 
### 
op-punk masters The Queers has been
/ doing its thing since 1982, and although
its recent sound has leaned more
towards the pop than the punk, especially after the
band's move to the So-Cal label Hopeless Records,
along comes "Later Days and Better Lays," the
band's latest offering, which finds The Queers back
on Lookout Records. As a compilation of demo
versions and unreleased songs, there's a lot of stuff
here that can be found in alternate forms on vari
ous old Queers albums, but there are also rare
tracks like a Screeching Weasel cover and a Joe
Queer duet with MTX frontman Dr. Frank that will
make this CD worth buying for both old and new
fans. With material from "Love Songs for the
Retarded" all the way to new songs from the "Don't
Back Down" sessions, this solid record traces the
musical evolution of The Queers, which proves
once again that it is indeed a solid band.
