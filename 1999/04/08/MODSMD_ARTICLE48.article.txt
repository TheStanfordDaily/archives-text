ff/J much acting talent, you get conflict
ing messages or egos, as in"The
Thin Red Line" or "Batman and Robin."
Fortunately, the idea behind "EDtv" is loud
and clear (as well as pertinent): Fame and
money, when in excess, can ultimately be
more disheartening than uplifting. Director

Ron Howard has unleashed another spectacular festival celebrating American
culture and all the various underlying idiosyncrasies that make it so unique.
Howard started out over a decade ago with "Splash" and "Cocoon," but he has
matured as a director, releasing such polished hits as "The Paper" and "Apollo
13." Technically speaking, "EDtv" has few flaws.
Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) is just your typical guy — he comes
from the deep South with a history of troubled family relations and relative
poverty. Now he has set up camp in San Francisco as a video store clerk. Not
exactly the American idea of a national hero.
But wait, the spin doctors on cable can make anyone look interesting. All they
really have to do is sit back and watch, as one viewer astutely points out. Among
the media magnates are Cynthia (Ellen Degeneres) and her power-tripping boss,
Dr. Whitaker (Rob Reiner). Eventually Dr. Whitaker starts taking credit for
Cynthia's idea to follow a guy around 24 hours a day, and he even has the audac
ity to explain to Cynthia that he will make all the decisions regarding Ed's TV
program since he drives a big car, and she drives a little one.
The main force behind the show's ratings is Ed's love interest, Shari (Jenna
Elfman, TV's Dharma on "Dharma and Greg"). Most people — 71 percent to be

exact — think that Ed should dump her. Heck, among them is

probably Ed's dim-witted brother, Ray (Woody Harrelson), who
had been going out with Shari until she found out, via the TV

show, that Ray was seeing other

women. Ed gets involved

with supermodel Jill
(Elizabeth Hurley), and the
two share a climactic evening
at Jill's home with thousands

of fans outside screaming for
and against what was about to

ensue on cable television.
More involving was the on
going saga between Ed's mom,

stepfather and father.
Jeanette (Sally Kirkland,

long-known for "Days of

Our Lives") left Hank
(Dennis Hopper) years

ago in the wake of a
scandalous affair, and
she married A 1 (Martin
► Landau). Ed is as help
less to figure out this

mess as we are, and
that's part of the inge
nuity behind focusing
on a wide-eyed guy
like Ed.
Adam Goldberg and

Steve Martin make brief

appearances, but it's McConaughey and Reiner who steal the show.
McConaughey is one of today's most talented rising stars, having shown his
mettle in "A Time to Kill" and "Contact."
While not quite "The Truman Show" and definitely not MTV's "The Real
World," this latest entry into our obsession with TV certainly makes you wonder
if such a program could eventually hit the airwaves in the future.
