# AGELESS HUMOR ...
## 'The Out-of-Towners' has its moments 
### 
Oiit-of-Towners" is
pretty dull if you're
under 18, cute if
you're at least 20 and most likely
hilarious if you're over 45.
Henry (Steve Martin) and Nancy
(Goldie Hawn) Clark face the prob
lems and crises of our parents' gen-

eration, They say a tearful good-bye to the last kid leav
ing the nest; Henry, an advertising exec, must go up
against younger people when he loses his job and inter
views for a new one, and Nancy and Henry's sex life has
fizzled.
Enter the funny stuff: Nancy and Henry end up solv
ing most of these problems when they embark on the
trip from hell, leaving their comfortable home in Ohio
and trekking to New York City for Henry's job inter
view. Nancy and Henry are awkward and somewhat
silly Midwesterners to begin with, but thrust into The
Big Apple, things are bound to go especially awry.
The Clarks wreak havoc on a rental car, manage to
get themselves robbed, get down and dirty on the
Tavern On the Green and make enemies with Mersault,
the manager of a posh hotel — played to over-the-top
snobbish perfection by John Cleese ("Monty Python,"
"A Fish Called Wanda"). Along the way, Henry and
Nancy rediscover each other as love interests and learn
to "suck the marrow out of life" — Nancy's not too ter
ribly original life motto.
If the mid-life crisis themes and episodic plot feel
clichid, ifs probably because the movie is a remake.
'The Out-of-Towners" is based on Neil Simon's screen
play for the 1970 version of the film, which starred Jack
lemmon and Sandy Dennis. The most humorous parts
of the film are those that feel the most spontaneous,
such as Nancy's seduction of a younger man right in
front of her husband's eyes, Nancy and Henry partici
pating in a therapy group for sexual deviants and a
voyeur's dream come true: seeing Cleese's upright and
uptight character indulging in fur and high heels. The
actors can be given much of the credit for these
moments, with their senses of timing and their lack of
fear of humiliating themselves.
This split in the film — a mix of old and cliched
story elements and moments of fresh humor —is
reflected in the film's music. Composed by Marc
Shaiman, who has worked on big band arrangements
with Harry Connick Jr. and scored numerous films, the
music has two totally different characters. One is a
snazzy big band sound, appropriate for all those wacky
New York moments, and the other is a generic,
Hallmark commercial sound that is heard during semi
serious moments in which the audience is exposed to
the ups and downs of the Clarks' marriage.
Incongruities in the film's texture aside, there are
some truly funny moments in"The Out-of-Tbwners,"
moments that people of almost any age can enjoy.
