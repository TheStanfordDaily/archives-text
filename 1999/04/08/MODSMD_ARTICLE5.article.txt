# Weiss and Lotz start write-in candidacy
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Juniors Adam Weiss and Jonathan Lotz
announced yesterday their decision to run for
ASSU president and vice president, respec
tively. They will pursue the positions through
what Weiss terms an "aggressive" write-in
campaign.
They are now the only declared competi
tion against the ticket of sophomore Michael
Levin and genetics doctoral student John
Mills.
The slate of David Lampson and Owen El
lickson was disqualified yesterday, leaving
Levin and Mills alone on the ballot.
Weiss said that there were two primary
reasons for why he and Lotz decided to enter
the race at such a late stage.
"We have just realized that we would have
the time to commit to the job, which we didn't
feel originally," Weiss said. "We also want this
election to be a strong competition of ideas,
not a simple formality. Th : s is not to say tbat
our ideas are better but that they are differ
ent."
Weiss is currently senate chair and Lotz is
on the ASSU presidential cabinet.
Lotz felt that their late entry into the race
would not hinder their ability to play influen
tial roles in the election. "I think we can make
a huge impact," Lotz said. "We've been talk
ing to people and informing them of our entry,
and people seem excited about what we're
doing. We're doing something novel by being
write-ins."
In addition to talking to students, Weiss is
posting campaign fliers and participating in
the upcoming presidential debate.
"We're definitely running to win," Weiss
said.
' Weiss insisted that their entrance
into the race was not influenced by
Lampson and Ellickson's disqualifi
cation.
* "[Lampson's] exit happened at
the same time that we entered, so it
didn't play a part in our decision to
join the race," Weiss said. "They
were simultaneous actions."

Weiss said Lampson and Ellick
son's departure will not cause any ad
justment to their ideas or platform
for the campaign.
"Since we entered when they left,
our ideas haven't changed," he said.
"We're in this race for the competi
tion."
Levin and Mills similarly said they
felt no need to alter their original
campaign plans in face of Weiss' can
didacy.
"We've had a plan and a platform

since we started, and we're not going
to change anything based on this,"
Mills said.
Levin felt that Weiss' addition to
the race would serve to make it a bet
ter one.
"Competition is a good thing, be
cause it makes you care more and
work harder. [President Maren Nor
ton] has showed us this year how im
portant this role is. Students really
deserve a choice in this race — more
than one option," he said.
