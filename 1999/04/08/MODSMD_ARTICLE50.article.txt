# TO DEATH ROW COMES THE UNFORGIVEN
## Quality performances can't save 'True Crime' 
### 
by and starring Clint Eastwood, "True Crime" can't decide
/ whether it wants to be a character-driven drama or a crime thriller.
Beginning with its first scene, the film makes an attempt at both.
Eastwood's character, Steve Everett, propositions a young female journalist

and colleague less than half his age. Feeling uncomfortable, she stumbles

away to her drunken death in a car accident, made predictable by appro-

priate music cues and dramatic shots of the slippery road ahead.
Several scenes of clumsy exposition then establish that Eastwood is a
reporter whose life as a reformed alcoholic has not led him to reform his
adulterous ways. Paying little attention to his wife and daughter, he pur-

sues young women with awkward abandon.
Everett is assigned to cover the execution that the aforementioned dead
colleague was supposed to attend. He proceeds to frustrate his superior;

(played with amusing sarcasm by James Woods and Dennis Leary) and turn
a straightforward human interest "sidebar" about the prisoner, Frank

Beachum (Isaiah Washington), into a personal crusade to prove the

man's innocence.
First a disclaimer. This is not a film about
the complexities of the death penalty. We
just don't believe that this man is guilty. He is

too noble, too dignified and too
unflappable in insisting his inno
cence. We are also privy to an unam-

biguous dream that indicates he really
did just go out for A-l sauce. The death

penalty may be morally suspect or

morally justified, but in this case it just

appears inappropriate. "
Ultimately, "True Crime" tries to be

too many things. Sometimes the film is a character
study, with Eastwood's Everett shining in fleshed-out
complexity. He may at any moment be most con-

cerned about his own best interests or those of the

prisoner; his romantic conquests or his fami-

ly; his profession or some glorified ideal of
what he could have been.

At other times "Crime" drops all nuance

and subtlety in favor of tension-filled, whodunit antics. It is at these
points where the film enters a world where randomly placed and
stylistically photographed pieces of jewelry can lead characters to

"ah-ha" moments, and ticking clocks impose fateful time lim-

its. The prisoner and his family live more in this side of

the film, though both Washington and Lisa Gay

Hamilton as his wife turn in moving perfor-

mances.

"True Crime" succeeds in its moments
of well-executed tension. But while the
film promises to be both a nuanced
character study and a suspenseful
murder mystery, ultimately it doesn't
commit fully enough to either one.
