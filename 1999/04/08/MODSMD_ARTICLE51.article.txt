# AND LET THERE BE JULIA
## Laughter heals in 'God Said, 'HA!' ' 
### 
od Said, 'HA!' " is one of
v—the most unexpected
delights of the year. Julia
Sweeney's last movie was the historic bomb
"It's Pat," which grossed only $60,822 (not
a typo). Who would have guessed that she
could revive her career with a sparse, one
woman show about her and her brother's
bouts with cancer? Probably + he same peo
ple who gussed that a Holocaust comedy
could work.
Of course, Roberto Benigni now has a
Best Actor Oscar, and Julia Sweeney has
made a surprisingly poignant film. The
movie centers around how life changes
under crisis. When Julia's brother, Mike,
contracted cancer, he and their worried
parents moved into her new Los Angeles
home. By the time Julia discovered that she
too had cancer, she was finding herself liv
ing out a second adolescence. She would Ue
to her parents about cigarette stains and
plan to fool around with her boyfriend
"when mom and dad are out."
The monologue which describes these
tribulations was a hit on Broadway, and
now Sweeney, with the help of director
Quentin Tarantino (who makes a brief
appearance at the end), has turned the
show into an intimate movie. The film
essentially chronicles one of her perfor
mances using a sparse set with little more
than a couch and a table. Julia delivers her
story with the style of a stand-up comedi
an, jumping from episode to episode in
loosely chronological order.
The approach can feel somewhat seat-

tered and
disorga
nized. At
its best,
however,
her tales
are both

ing and hilarious. Her brother, for example,
playfully accused her of trying to steal "the
cancer spotlight" from him. Throughout
the film, Julia's performance reveals that
sometimes the only way to deal with our
darkest moments is with humor.
Indeed, the humor can be very, very
dark. One of the film's funniest moments is
when Julia describes Mike's reaction to the
shunt inserted into his forehead so that he
could avoid additional spinal taps. The
doctors tell Mike that people love their
shunts, so once the shunt is inserted
through his skull, Mike periodically
declares, "I love my shunt!"
Julia deserves credit for not glamorizing
cancer as she plainly details how the disease
ravaged their bodies — including their
vomiting episodes, the scar tissue that built
up along Mike's spine, the numerous injec
tions they received and her reaction to the
removal of her reproductive organs. The
story is no joke, although joking may have
been the only way the Sweeneys could find
their humanity throughout the ordeal.
"God Said, 'HA!' " is a moving testament to
their struggle.
