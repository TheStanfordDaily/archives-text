# FUMBLING TOWARD INANITY
## Nothing to corrupt in 'The Corrupter' 
### 
Wahlberg is the same in every movie. It's what the

The Corruptor
Chow Yun-Fat
Mark Wahlberg

audience expects. The same
goes for Chow Yun-Fat
("Woo yuet dik goo si").
"The Corrupter" attempts to take unre
alistic action stars and place them in a
poorly disguised police drama. Advertised
as a fast-paced, vaguely "Lethal
Weaponesque" action movie, "Corruptor"

has plenty of violence and little else. The violence is

interspersed with a lot of melodramatic filler that

tries desperately to portray

the hardships associated

with law enforcement.
Chow plays a tough and

street-smart cop

who has moral di
lemmas about his

job. That is to
say, he's on the

take and he
doesn't like it.

To make matters

worse, he has an

inexperienced and
idealistic new part-

ner — enter Marky

Mark. Together they

forge an unlikely friendship which leads them through a predictable
series of events culminating in a disappointing conclusion.
While Chow is charismatic and has good stage presence, the rest of
the movie tends to be pretty mediocre. Action fans will be sorely dis
appointed with this film as a whole. If you see it at all, wait until it
comes out on video.
