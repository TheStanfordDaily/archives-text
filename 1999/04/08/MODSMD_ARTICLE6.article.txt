The results are in. The Harry
Truman Scholarship Foundation se
lected 79 juniors across the United
States to receive Truman Scholar
ships. Junior Matthew Spence was
one of the 79, as Stanford's only re
cipient of the coveted scholarship.
Spence will receive $3(),(XX) for
graduate school tuition from the

scholarship, which is awarded to stu
dents who have demonstrated a
strong leadership ability and com
mitment to public service.
According to Spence's profes
sors, the award did not come as a
complete surprise.
"We're delighted that [Spence]
has been awarded a Truman Schol


Matthew Spence
arship and some of us — his faculty
— have always believed that
[Spence] would be an applicant for
the Truman Scholarship," said Coit
Blacker, deputy director of the Insti
tute for International Studies. "I
have every confidence that [Spence]
will make effective use of his Tru
man Scholarship both intellectually
and to reinforce his commitment to
public service."
Although Spence has devoted
the majority of his time at Stanford

to the debate team, research and stu
dent government, he says his most
memorable Stanford experience
stems from Sophomore College.
Spence both participated and served
as a Sophomore Assistant in the
summer program for second-year
students.
"I loved Sophomore College,"
said Spence. "I think S A-ing was one
of the best experiences I've had. I
made such good friends while teach
ing about American foreign policy. I
realized that I do like to teach."
Spence plans to use the scholar
ship to study international policy.
He wants to develop a conference

that will bring student leaders from
Russia and the United States togeth
er to study leadership.
"I'll be going to Moscow this
summer to work on this conference
and my thesis," said Spence. "I want
to work with Russia, because it's an
amazing region of the world where
what we do will affect foreign policy
in the next 50 years."
Spence traces his interest in pub
lic service to his family history.
"My mother is a first-generation
American. My grandmother is from
Norway," he said. "She came over
after the Nazis took over. Her Eng
lish was poor, yet she still was an ac

tive member of her community. She
taught me to look back at what
you've been given."
Following that example of public
service, Spence spent last summer
serving as an intern for the National
Security Council.
His job involved writing memos
and aiding President Clinton's
speech-writing staff.
"Working for the National Secu
rity Council was the most meaning
ful public service experience I've
had," Spence said. "It really con
vinced me that you can't ignore
what's going on in Russia or Eastern
Europe."
