song off that album, "You're All I
Need to C Jet By," won best song, and
Crystal McCreary, Class of -C W. was

"I was so happy when I found out
about the awards because we put a
lot of work into the album, and I'm
glad someone recognized it," said

sophomore Amy Lee, an alto with
Everyday People.
Critically acclaimed since its re

Best of Collegiate A Cappella."
" This song had an incredible
arrangement by | former group mem

song. When you sing it you really get
into the feel of it," Lee said.
McCreary was also a 1996 nomi

fering on the Everyday People
album, "wail."
"Crystal is an amazing person
whose voice is very soothing with a

such feeling," Lee said.
