# Sororites begin rush activities
## Chapters expect high turnout 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
Sorority Rush begins today, and
Stanford's five sororities are seeing
increased numbers of potential
members.

According to Andrea Constanti
nides, the Inter Sorority Council's
Rush chair, "as of Wednesday's ori
entation night we had 181 rushees,
up from 177 last year, and we're still
expecting more girls."
This year is the first year two
sororities have been housed, and
Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha
Theta have been preparing for Rush
in their houses rather than in various
meeting places this year. Ellie Mertz,
resident assistant in the Theta house,
commented that having a house has
made preparing for Rush easier and
more fun. The remaining three
sororities, Chi Omega, Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi, are

unhoused.
Stanford lost a sorority this year
when Delta Gamma closed in Janu
ary due to a lack of new pledges.
Constantinides commented, "with
losing the Delta Gamma chapter, it is
hard to keep up the positive spirit,
but we are happy to see that many
girls are still interested in Greek
life."
Rush is a four-day long event
starting with Friday night's open
house, where women will have the
opportunity to meet the members of
all five sororities. On Saturday and
Sunday chosen rushees attend invi
tational parties, where they will learn
more about the sororities through
skits and songs performed by current
sorority members. Finally, on Mon
day sororities conduct their final
evaluations of potential members
during formal events, called Prefer
ence, hosted at the Sheraton Hotel in
Palo Alto.
After attending Preference, the
women will hear whether they re
ceived a bid on Tuesday; if they ac
cept their bid, they will begin pledg
ing with their new sorority.
Constantinides and the ISC guide
the rushees through every step of the
Rush process. Each rushee is as
signed to a Rush counselor, who will
be available for advice and support.
