Clinton to push healthcare rights
WASHINGTON (AF) —Prodding Congress to pass a "patients
bill of rights," President Clinton will use a Philadelphia pep rally today
to extend new health care protections to federal workers.
The president will also announce a new "Internet petition," where
computer users can register their support for new regulations that
would mandate that HMOs and other managed care plans provide the
same benefits to all covered patients.
Figures that Clinton intends to release show that a package of sev
eral new benefits for 9 million federal employees will cost less than
$10 per person each year.
One of the new provisions requires health plans to release a host of
information about how they pay doctors, customer satisfaction and
the quality of doctors and hospitals.
The other requires plans to let patients stay with their doctors for
90 days, even if the doctor is dropped from the network, if they are in
the middle of a treatment or pregnancy.
Clinton has already extended the same provisions to patients in
Medicare and Medicaid.
The most controversial — and most expensive — provision that
Democrats are pushing would give patients the right to sue health
plans and collect damages when they withhold treatment.
An equally contentious provision that would require health plans
to pay for "medically necessary" care, as determined by doctors. Clin
ton doesn't have the power to unilaterally extend either of those pro
visions to the federal workforce.
But the administration already has required that health plans cov
ering government workers pay for reasonable emergency room trips
and allow patients to see specialists outside the network if needed and
obstetricians-gynecologists without a referral.
'Melissa' menace appears in court
FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) —The man accused of spreading the so
called "Melissa" computer virus appeared in court for the first time
Thursday, answering the judge's questions with a nod of the head or
"Yes, sir."
The judge advised David L. Smith, 30, of the charges against him
and informed him of his rights.
"You are charged with some serious offenses," Judge John A. Ric
ciardi said.
Smith, a former computer programmer, was arrested last week and
charged with originating Melissa from his New Jersey apartment.
Authorities say the virus, which clogged e-mail accounts and shut
down computer networks worldwide, was named after a topless
dancer in Florida.
He is charged with interruption of public communications, con
spiracy and theft of computer service. The maximum penalty for the
offense is 40 years in prison.
He remains free on $100,000 bail.
Davis outlines college service plan
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday he
wants to require community service for all students at state colleges
and universities.
"One of the ethics of the World War II generation was a sense of
obligation to the future, and an appreciation for what they inherited.
That is getting away from us," Davis said.
"I will come up with a plan that will require every college student,
as a condition of graduation, to provide some public service," he said.
The requirement would apply at all University of California, Cali
fornia State University and community college campuses, he said.
It wasn't clear whether Davis would present his plan to the heads
of the three college systems, or when or how he would implement it.
Nor did he say what kind of community service he envisioned.
One senior at California State-Sacramento's student union on
Thursday said it would instill the value of volunteerism in young
adults. "I think it's a good idea because I think a lot of the time at aca
demic institutions we are separated from the community," said
Natasha Clark, a social-work major.
