# Serbs declare end to ethnic violence
## U.S., NATO unconvinced; bombing to continue

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
(AP) â€” Yugoslavia urged refugees
to return home yesterday, declaring
"peace has prevailed in Kosovo"
and saying its 14-month war against
ethnic Albanian separatists was
over. But Western officials feared
those same refugees would be used
as human shields against NATO
attacks.
As the United States pledged
that NATO will press ahead with
the bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia, a former Cypriot presi
dent arrived in Belgrade to try to
win freedom for three captured
U.S. soldiers. His task could prove
difficult: A hard-line Serbian vice
premier ruled out any release as
long as the NATO bombardment
continued.
On the 16th day of the U.S.-led
air assault, hopes for the prisoners'
release were mixed with concern
over thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees whose fate was unknown a
day after Yugoslavia sealed off its
borders and stopped their flight out
of Kosovo.
The Yugoslav government,
which says it is observing a unilater
al cease-fire in Kosovo since Tues
day for Orthodox Easter, claimed
the refugees were voluntarily head
ing back to their homes in the
province.
Shortly after 10 p.m., air-raid
sirens sounded in Belgrade.
Spyros Kyprianou, currently the
speaker of the Cypriot parliament,
said he planned to meet Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on
Friday and that the Americans
might be freed during the long
Orthodox Easter weekend. He
called on NATO to reciprocate with
a cease-fire over the holiday, some
thing the alliance has refused.
Vice Premier jVojislavi Seselj,
leader Of the influential Serbian
Radical Party, told reporters yester
day that releasing the Americans
was "out of the question."
U.S. State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said
only an unconditional release would
be acceptable.
"Any attempt to use this as a
bargaining chip is both illegal and
immoral," Rubin said.
President Clinton insisted that
NATO can still win in Kosovo with
out sending in ground troops, and
expressed hope yesterday that the
three servicemen would be freed.
Although NATO arranged for
safe passage for Kyprianou's flight,
alliance warplanes and missiles
struck before dawn yesterday in
Belgrade and against government

troops in Kosovo.
NATO warned that Yugoslavia's
state-run radio and television net
work could be one of its next tar
gets.
In a statement yesterday, Milose
vic's government claimed that
"peace has prevailed in Kosovo,"
and said its security forces had
"ended the offensive, anti-terrorist
activities" against the ethnic Alba
nian Kosovo Liberation Army,
which has been fighting for inde
pendence.
"The Yugoslav government once

again calls on all citizens of Kosovo
not to leave their country, to live in
harmony and cooperation, and in
that way resist the bombs that kill
regardless of nationality," the state
ment said.
Nearly a million ethnic Albani
ans have lied or were driven out of
Kosovo since the NATO bombing
campaign began March 24.
Those reaching refuge in neigh
boring states have described a sys
tematic campaign of terror by Serb
troops and police against ethnic
Albanians, who made up 90 percent

of the Serbian province's prewar
population of 2 million people.
NATO allies have dismissed
Yugoslavia's claims of a unilateral
ceasefire, saying the bombing cam
paign will continue until Milosevic
allows the return of all refugees,
withdraws all troops and accepts a
peace plan for Kosovo.
NATO, meanwhile, claimed it
was not responsible for the
widespread damage in Kosovo's
capital of Pristina and blamed Serb
forces for gutting the heart of the
once-bustling citv.

A group of refugees enter Montenegro from Kosovo yesterday as they emerge from woods where they
have been hiding since the start of NATO air strikes two weeks ago. Montenegro has taken in 35,000
of the one million Kosovar refugees in the region.
