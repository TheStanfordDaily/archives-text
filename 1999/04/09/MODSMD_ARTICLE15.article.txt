# Clinton, Zhu discuss nuclear spy, campaign finance charges
## President talks with Chinese premier 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Chi
nese Premier Zhu Rongji promised
President Clinton yesterday to
cooperate in investigations of
alleged nuclear-weapons spying
and illegal campaign contributions
by Beijing "no matter who it may
involve."
But he ridiculed the suggestion
of Chinese meddling in U.S. politics
and denied the espionage charge.
Side by side with Clinton at a 91-
minute news conference, Zhu also
rejected U.S. charges of human
rights abuses in China as "unfair"
and an intrusion in its internal
affairs.
At a windup news conference,
they claimed important progress on
the contentious issue of trade, even
though they failed to agree on a
deal that would have cleared the
way for China's entry into the
World Trade Organization — a
longstanding Chinese goal.
In what he said was "a very
solemn statement," Zhu said he and
President Jiang Zemin had no
knowledge of suspicions that China
stole nuclear warhead designs from
U.S. labs in the 1980s.
Zhu also mocked allegations
that China funneled $3(K),(XX) to
Clinton's re-election campaign in
19% in hopes of currying favor.
Even so, he said China would

cooperate with the U.S. investiga
tions.
The sharpest exchange came on
human rights. The State Depart
ment in February said China's
human rights record "deteriorated
sharply" last year with a crackdown

on political dissent and restrictions
on religion and other freedoms.
Zhu denounced a U.S. resolu
tion at a U.N. forum criticizing
C hina's record. "1 not only regard
that as unfair hut also take it as an
interference in China's internal

affairs," he said. Zhu said the Chi
nese "enjoy unprecedented exten
sive democratic and political
rights."
Yet. he said, "I concede there is
room for improvement in human
rights conditions in China."
