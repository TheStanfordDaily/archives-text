# Virus hits Malaysia

### 
KUALA LUMPUR. Malaysia
(AP) — A tropical virus that has
killed dozens of people in Malaysia
is the first of its kind and virologists
are stumped as to how it spreads, an
American health official said yester
day.
Nine scientists from the United
States and other experts from Aus
tralia, Taiwan and Japan arrived in
Malaysia several weeks ago to help
the Southeast Asian country deter
mine the nature of the virus believed
to be spreading from pigs to humans.
The outbreak has killed 90 people.
"This is a new, previously unrec
ognized virus found in humans,"
Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the
U.S. Centers of Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta told The
Associated Press by telephone.
"This virus has never been seen
before."
The scientists have been tramp
ing through pig pens and farming
communities where the deadly virus
first appeared, wearing gloves,
gowns and battery-operated respira
tors while visiting the worst-hit
areas.
"We don't know if it's highly
infectious. We don't know how peo
ple are being infected," Skinner said.
"It doesn't appear, right now. that
this is being transmitted from person
to person, but we're still not going to
rule that out."
Government health experts ini

tially said the outbreak began with
the deaths of 15 people last October
who succumbed to the Japanese
encephalitis virus, which is transmit
ted by the Cttlex mosquito. These
findings were confirmed by World
Health Organization officials from
Japan who came to help investigate.
But in late February, the number
of deaths among villagers and farm
ers in the hog-rearing district of
Bukit Pelandok in central Negeri
Sembilan jumped dramatically,
prompting health officials to seek
further help.
About 70 people died in a month,
including pig farmers who received a
vaccine for the Japanese encephalitis
virus.
Malaysian virologists flew to the
United States on March 17 with
samples. Lab analyses quickly
proved that the virus wasn't
Japanese encephalitis. Instead, it
resembled a very rare Hendra virus,
first detected in Australia in 1994.
Symptoms are the same for both
viruses — high fever, aches, eventu
al coma and death.
The CDC finding plunged
Malaysia into further confusion. Pig
farmers deserted their homes after
police cordoned off their villages. To
curb the outbreak, soldiers dressed
like astronauts swept through a half
dozen pig-farming districts in an
attempt to slaughter a targeted 1
million pigs.
