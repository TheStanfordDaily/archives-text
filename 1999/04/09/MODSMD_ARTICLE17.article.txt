VOTERS IN ASSU elections
are not overwhelmed with
information to aid them in
their polling-place decisions. Aside
from the Elections Handbook and
the occasional presidential debate,
few forums exist for campaign dis
course, and the entire electoral pro
cess is thus dangerously close to
falling into a popularity contest
based on catchy slogans and well
placed posters.
The Daily tries to help the process
by printing, in its news pages, pro
files of presidential candidates and a
pre-election round-up of senate can
didates, special fee seekers, pro
posed constitutional amendments
and class presidential slates. That
coverage aims to present major elec
tion issues in a concise format.
There is another side to The
Daily's election service to the Stan
ford community, one that is entirely
separate from the news pages and
that annually creates as much con
troversy as anything we print.
This weekend, the paper's editori
al board — consisting of the editor in
chief, a managing editor, the opin
ions editors, staff members at large
and a community member — will
meet with all declared candidates for
ASSU president, supporters of the
proposed constitutional amendment
and the bulk of the groups seeking
special fees (those who choose to
meet with us).
The board will listen to a presen
tation from each slate or group and
ask questions. After 16 hours of
meetings over three days — and
countless more scrutinizing several
hundred pages of candidate state
ments, amendment text and group

budget proposals — the board will
vote to endorse a presidential slate,
recommend a yes or no vote on the
amendment and rank each special
fee group on a five-point scale.
Endorsements, which will run
before the election next week, will
not represent snap decisions based
on candidates' smiles or fee groups'
posters. They will be well
researched, thoughtfully considered
and thoroughly debated.
They will also be extremely
important. An ASSU election, by
nature, comes at a time when course
work begins to pick up and activities
kick into full swing. Stanford stu
dents are, for the most part, too busy
to personally scrutinize every fee
request or candidate resume.
By printing its endorsements —
and more importantly, the rationale
behind them — the editorial board is
able to share the fruits of its long
research process with a community
that often does not have the time to
undertake a similar task.
We choose to endorse not because
we believe we make better decisions
than anyone else on the Stanford
campus, but because we believe it is
necessary for a newspaper in a
democracy to educate itself and its
readers as fully as possible on elec
toral issues.
By publishing our endorsement
criteria and the reasoning behind
our decisions, we offer a guideline
for voting, a reference frame in
which students can root their deci
sions.
Voting is ultimately a personal
choice, and we do not pretend to be
dictating what the best choice is for
every voter. But by offering our
well-researched opinions and show
ing how we arrived at them, we
believe that we help the system.
The ballot issues are too impor
tant to be decided on popularity
alone.
