## Celebrate Founders' Day and Stanford 
### 
THIS SUNDAY IS a
special day on the
Stanford Campus,
continuing a tradition that
was started in 1891. It's the
one day of the year on
which the entire Stanford
community has the oppor-

tunity to come together as one to commem
orate the founding of Stanford University
and to honor Jane and Leland Stanford. In
1891, Senator Stanford established
Founders' Day (then referred to as "Memo
rial Day") in honor of Leland Jr.'s birthday.
After Senator Stanford's death, the focus of
the celebration shifted to honor Senator
and Mrs. Stanford.
While the content and date of Founders'
Day celebrations have changed over the
years, some things remain constant, notably
the spirit, time to reflect and sense of com
munity generated on this day for partici
pants and spectators.
This year's Founders' Day celebration
has something for everyone. From 10 a.m.
to 12 noon, the Mausoleum will be open to
the public. This is the only day of the year
when you can see the interior of the Mau
soleum, which serves as the final resting
place of the Stanford family. At 10:45 a.m.,
the formal Founders' Day program begins
with a brief ceremony in front of the Mau

soleum. including the laying of a wreath and
a performance by Talisman, the 1997
national college a cappella champions.
After the Mausoleum ceremony, a proces
sion of students, faculty, administrators,
members of the Board of Trustees, histori
cal society members and the Stanford fami
ly's original horse-drawn carriage will pro
ceed to Memorial Church on Palm Drive.
The Memorial Church Ceremony will
begin promptly at 11:45 a.m., featuring
speeches by President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice. The ceremony
will also highlight speeches by junior
Meghann Evershed and second-year law
student Lori Vincere. Evershed and Vin
cere were selected by a student committee
from a very competitive field of students
who participated in a Founders' Day speech
competition. Founders' Day will conclude
with a Quad celebration beginning at 12:45
p.m., featuring an old-fashioned family pic
nic and entertainment provided by the
Stanford Jazz Band. All of these events are
free and open to the public.
Students especially should take advan
tage of this day to learn more about the
founding of the University from which they
will graduate and the people whose name
the University bears. 1 know 1 have learned
a great about Stanford because of my
involvement with Founders' Day. For

instance, I was interested to learn in review
ing the student speeches the reason why the
University's roof tiles are red: Jane Stanford
knew that Leland Jr. was up in heaven look
ing down and, therefore, would be able to
locate his university easily because of its dis
tinctive red roofs.
Founders' Day will also provide students
the opportunity to meet and mingle with
faculty, staff, trustees and alumni through
out the day. The University feels so strong
ly about the importance of Founders' Day
that it now schedules its Board of Trustees
meeting the day after Founders' Day to
facilitate trustee involvement. It's the type
of day that should almost be a rite of pas
sage for all Stanford students.
Stanford University is a special place
made up of bright, wonderful, diverse and
engaging people. Its history is rich, interest
ing, funny and inspiring. All of us associated
with Stanford know how fortunate we are
to be a part of this special place and its his
tory. Founders' Day allows us to
unabashedly show our affinity for Stanford,
learn more about Stanford and celebratc
being part of Stanford. See you at the Mau
soleum on Sunday!
