U.S. can learn from mistakes
While Jocelyn Wiener's column on the
situation in Kosovo in last Wenesday's
Daily quite rightly considers and appreci
ates the complexities of political action,
especially regarding international politics,
it belies modern intellectualism's near com
plete unification with cynicism, a cynicism
which often liberally ignores its own inter
nal contradictions. There exists a tacit
assumption that the mounting of damning
evidence constitutes an argument in and of
itself, though often without examining how
these individual cases might conflict with
the purported larger argument.
Wiener places the United States in its
facile no-win situation. On the one hand,
the United States is criticized for inaction
("we have ... over-looked Rwanda" and
"we stood wringing our hands [with
Bosnia]") and simultaneously criticized for
action ("involvement in the Central Amer
ican civil wars").
Could the United States truly have
escaped criticism for its involvement in
Bosnia or Rwanda as "imperialistic"? It
most certainly did not. Can the United
States' presence in Central America be
considered unilaterally as a malicious polit
ical act, a situation in which the U.S. gov
ernment acted in no way out of a concern
for human rights, both foreign and domes
tic? Though its understanding of what that
means and how to do it now seems hope
lessly anachronistic, we can surely expect
no more of our current situation.
Which situation is preferable, the toler

ante of Kosovo's previous situation of
oppression and human rights violations or
bombings which result in"the solidification
of Milosevic ... and the acceleration of the
process of ethnic cleansing"? The answer is
that neither could ever be preferred, but
the decision as to action or inaction
remains. The challenge of thoughtful dis
course isn't to point to the failures of a
series of situations which were all a priori
without a largely positive result possible,
but to examine these historical situations in
light of the successes and failures of deci
sions which have been made drastically dif
ferently. Is it really that intolerable from a
historico-intellectual position that the Unit
ed States learned some small lesson from
Rwanda or must it repeat its inaction which
resulted in half a million dead in order to
prove the absolute equality of its interna
tional policy?

Questioning global warming
Ozone Action, a Washington, D.C- based
environmental group, has been leading an
effort to have colleges such as Stanford and
Harvard curtail their investments in those
companies that it contends are opposing the
implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. At
Stanford that organization has been attempt
ing to incite students to demand that the Uni
versity Board of Trustees use their influence
to change the actions of these corporations.
The position of these activists demon
strates a cavalier disregard for Kyoto's eco

nomic consequences. Under the treaty, the
firms concerned would pay much higher
taxes and would have to cut sales, lay off
workers and boost prices to customers. Some
firms would either be driven out of business
entirely or have to leave the country. This
troubles those corporations. What does not
seem to trouble those recommending such
drastic measures is that, according to the for
mer head of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), the UN group of
experts on global warming, Kyoto would
have no measurable impact on climate!
Kyoto is a bad treaty. It exempts most of
the world's developing countries, including
China and India, both of which are increas
ing their use of fossil fuels at an accelerating
rate. By the year 2020, China alone will pro
duce more greenhouse gases than Europe or
the United States. Even if the industrialized
countries did abide by the treaty's quotas,
third world increases in carbon dioxide
would swamp their cutbacks.
According to the U.S. Department of
Energy, the impact of Kyoto would be "dev
astating" on industries heavily dependent on
energy. In fact, the department's researchers
forecast that the aluminum industry —an
industry vital to national defense — would
leave the country entirely for places like
Brazil or South Korea, which are exempt.
Moreover, the aim of the protocol is
flawed. Economists who have studied the
effect of a possible global warming conclude
that it would be very modest. Estimates of
the consequences on the United States range
from a loss to a gain of about 1 percent of
GDP. Note as well that most people prefer a
warmer to a colder world. Where do they go

when they retire?
Global warming might even have signifi
cant health benefits. Doctors often recom
mend that sick people move to more clement
climates for their health. They usually don't
have Duluth in mind. My own research
shows that the warming being predicted
would reduce deaths in the United States by
about 40,000. British researchers have found
that a 3 degree Celsius warming — the top of
the range being predicted for the end of the
next century — would cut mortality in Eng
land and Wales by about 17,500 annually.
On the other hand, according to almost all
economic studies, including those cited by
the IPCC, Kyoto would reduce GDP by
about 3-percent. Researchers have calculat
ed that, during the first 5 years after the
treaty went into effect, the United States
would lose between 1 to 1.6 million jobs.
Wholesale energy prices would soar 77 per
cent; the cost of electricity to the consumer
would rise by 36 percent. WEFA, a research
organization, concludes that meeting the
Kyoto goal would be a "daunting task,"
requiring the near doubling of energy and
electricity prices. At the pump, gasoline
prices would rise by 65 cents per gallon. The
Kyoto Protocol, if implemented, would
mean much higher prices for American con
sumers and lower incomes. And for what? It
would have no effect on climate! No wonder
the companies on the firing line oppose this
harmful treaty. Students and faculty should
beware of being taken in by symbolic actions
with real adverse consequences.
