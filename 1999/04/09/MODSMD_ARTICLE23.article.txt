# Bringing it all back home
## Mark Silver To rush or not to rush: is that the question? 
### 
SPRING IS IN the air, and with this joy
ous season comes a decision of
paramount importance for many a
young college male. This decision can deter
mine one's life course and can even serve as
a rite of passage from adolescence to man
hood. No, I'm not talking about a vision
quest or a Bar Mit/vah. I'm talking about the
far more arduous task of joining a fraternity.
I know that so far I seem to be excluding
the other half of the human species, but my
lack of female status prevents me from trying
to shed any light on the trials and tribulations
of sorority Rush. Sorry sisters, but read on
and you might comprehend the inner work
ings of the mind of that guy you grinded
(ground?) with at your last frat party.
Having been a pledge and active member
of a fraternity for almost a year now, I will
attempt to bring an insider's view to this
whole frat thing, drawing both from interac
tions with my fellow brethren and from
observations of other fine organizations.
There are three typical positions fresh
man males will take regarding fraternity
rush, and each one is equally valid.
First, we have the gung-ho frat boy

wannabe, who from his first screening of
"Animal House" (or maybe "Revenge of the
Nerds") has known that he desires a place in
some proud fraternal order. He probably
already has a fraternity already picked out
and is just waiting for a bid. This one needs
no further encouragement and doesn't need
to read any further.
Second, we have the anti-establishment,
anti-Mason, probablv-going-to-draw-into-
Synergy pseudo-hippie, who scoffs at any
trappings of order and Structure while
munching his fakin' bacon. This type has
made up his mind long ago and can also stop
reading.
Third, and finally, we have the majority of
those freshman guys who are pretty ambiva
lent about rushing, who are unsure whether
or not a fraternity would be right for them.
With all of you in mind, let's address some
reasons you might have for joining a fraterni
ty, keeping in mind that these are only a few
of the many possible arguments.
1.1 have no friends, and am willing to pay
for some.
This is a fairly plausible reason, but not
one that is likely to result in overall satisfac

tion. Paying your dues every quarter does
not automatically mean that all brothers will
like you. Chances are that by hanging out
and having fun with your fellow brothers,
you will eventually become good friends with
many of them and acquire a bunch of fond
memories. However, you should not rely on
them to be your sole source of friendship,
because as we all know, money cannot buy
you love. Work on your interpersonal skills,
make a good friend or two and rush when
you're happy and secure enough to try some
thing new without the fear of rejection hov
ering over you.
2.1 will meet and hook up with many girls.
Oddly enough, this seems to be the major
factor, conscious or not. behind many deci
sions to rush. Although exaggerated by
movies and television, this argument does
seem to have some validity for many, though
not nearly all, of the fraternities here at Stan
ford. Keep in mind, however, that many of
the females you will meet and possibly hook
up with are of the over-made-up, meaning
less-conversation variety. You don't really
need to join a fraternity to find these
women â€” instead, just walk to White Plaza.

loudly proclaim that you play water polo and
watch them come running.
3.1 enjoy participating in a system of Uni
versity-sanctioned ethnic and racial segrega
tion.
From my own observations. I can honest
ly say that Stanford doesn't really seem to
suffer as much from this problem as other
colleges. The only segregation I've noticed is
voluntary, without any active discrimination,
and seems to be relatively harmless. Many
people might say that I'm wrong, but hey, I
just haven't noticed it. Most well-known fra
ternities here seem to be generally accepting
and open to all kinds of people.
4.1 enjoy being hazed.
Come on. fraternities don't haze here. It
goes against University policy.
5. I will be able to sublimate my homo
erotic impulses.
No. I am not saying that all frat brothers
are gay. Hut with all the ritual nudity, nipple
twisting and ass-slapping that goes on in
many fraternities, this may be an outlet for
some of your otherwise stilled homosexual
tendencies.
6.1 will enjoy easy and frequent access to

alcohol and other such pleasurable sub
stances.
No duh. But if you really have a problem
with such access now, I have to say that
you're pretty pathetic.
7. I am looking to have a lot of fun and
make some good friendships and meet
enough cool guys in some fraternity that I
will probably feel comfortable becoming a
brother.
Bingo. Your time in a fraternity may or
may not be life-changing, but I pretty much
guarantee you that you'll have some great
times. That's the nature of most fraternities.
Of course, if you don't get a bid from the
fraternity you want, this is all pointless. In
that case, spend your money on some hot
new wheels or take guitar lessons and learn
how to play "She Talks to Angels." Both of
the above are sure bets for getting those
ladies.
Happy rushing.
