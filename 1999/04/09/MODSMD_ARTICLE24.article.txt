sorts for the distance medley, where
All-Americans Mary Cobb and
Sally Glynn will join two of the 800
relay runners.
Several individual track events
will also be contested including the
3,000-meter run, 200-meter dash and
100-meter hurdles. All-Americans
Sarna Renfro and Julia Stamps are
the favorites in the 3,000 along with
Colorado's Heather Burroughs.
While the race will be Stamps' sea
son debut, it will be Renfro's second
opportunity to get in some racing ex
perience after a long lay off.
"We feel like one of the things
with Sarna as well as Marv Cobb is

that they have missed so much run
ning that every opportunity they can
get will be something that we'll try to
give them." Lananna said. "Sarna
didn't compete all last spring and
didn't have eligibility in the fall and
winter and Mary didn't compete last
year (in track)."
In the 200, both Smith and Spur
lock will likely compete while Wool
folk will square off against heptath
letes Lawyer and Julie Tinker in the
100 hurdles.
All field events will be contested
on an individual basis. The entire
Cardinal throwing squad will be
making the trip as well as jumper
Tara Oettinger. Oettinger, disc
thrower Summer Pierson and ham
mer thrower Maureen Onyeagbako
are all on the verge of posting na
tional qualifying marks.
