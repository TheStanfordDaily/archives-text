# No. 2 Card readies for Huskies
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Perfection. It feels so sweet — yet
it can be so fleeting.
No. 2 Stanford (23-8.9-0 Pacific 10
Conference) has gotten off to its best
conference start ever, sweeping its
first three Pae-10 series. The Cardinal
is hitting a blistering .363 in Pac-10
play and the young Stanford staff is
holding conference opponents to
only 3.18 runs a game. On the field, it
seems like everything is going the
Cardinal's way.
How long can this surprising run
continue?

"We're very pleased with our
start," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We've found ways to win a lot
of close games. But, starting this
weekend, it's going to get very
tough."
The tough stretch begins this
weekend as Stanford travels to Seat
tle to take on No. 25 Washington (17-
9, 6-3 Pac-10). A week from now.

USC, surging after a dismal start,
comes to Palo Alto for a three-game
set. Then, the Cardinal goes to Berke
ley to face Cal, always eager to play
spoiler to Stanford's success.
Even with this daunting schedule
staring Stanford in the face, it would
be fun to imagine the Cardinal romp
ing unscathed through the revamped
Pac-10.
However, Coach Marquess and
the Cardinal do not live in such a fan
tasy world. Just winning two of three
at Husky Ballpark this weekend
"would be huge," Marquess said.
"What some people don't realize
is that, if you don't play well on a
weekend, you can be swept by any
team in our conference," Marquess
said. "And, even if you play well and
you face a hot team, you can get
beat."
The Huskies, who have lost two of
their last three, are not exactly hot,
but they do have the great equalizer
in baseball: good pitching.
Junior Jeff Heaverlo (5-1, 2.86
ERA), scheduled to throw tonight, is
probably one of the best pitchers in
college baseball. Mixing a live fastball
with a hard-breaking slider, the right
hander has recorded 68 strikeouts
and allowed only 47 hits in just under
57 innings of work.
"He's tough," Marquess said.
"He'll be one of the better, if not the
best, pitcher we'll face this year. II
he's really on, he's tough to beat, just
like if [Stanford sophomore Jason)
Young is on, he's tough to beat."

dominating.
In 70 innings, he has struck out 87
while allowing only 50 hits. He has
thrown four complete games and op
posing batters are hitting a measly
.202 against him.
"We expected him to have a good
year, but we didn't expect him to
pitch as well as he has to date," Mar
quess said. "We wouldn't expect that
type of performance out of anyone.
"But he's very talented and has
great stuff. It was just a matter of
throwing strikes and getting confi
dence. Obviously, he's done that."
Freshman Brian Sager (3-0, 3.00

ERA), scheduled to start Sunday for
the Cardinal, has also begun to make
a name for himself. The 6-foot-5,215
pound, right-hander broke out Satur
day against Washington State, pitch
ing a three-hit, 12 strikeout complete
game which earned him Pac-10 Pitch
er of the Week honors.
To continue their stellar seasons,
Young and Sager, as well as the rest
of the Stanford staff, would do well to
watch out for Washington catcher
Dominic Woody. Though this is the
junior's first year in the starting line
up, he is putting up All-American
numbers.
Batting in the third hole. Woody is
hitting .402 with 12 home runs and 40
RBIs, all team-leading marks.
While Woody has been carrying

the load for the Huskies, Stanford's
production has been spread through
out the lineup.
Juniors Damien Alvarado (.345,3
HR, 22 RBI), Nick Day (.313,4 HR,
24 RBI) and Jeff Rizzo (.342, 2 HR,
27 RBI) have been consistently pro
ductive and sophomore center fielder
Billy Jacobson (.349, 1 HR, 8 RBI)
has filled in admirably for junior Ed
mund Muth, who has been sidelined
with meningitis.
"The nice thing about the success
we've had is that it hasn't been be
cause of the success of just two or
three guys, it's been a real team ef
fort," Marquess said. "But, at the
same time, I know it's going to have
to continue because it's just going to
get tougher as we go."
