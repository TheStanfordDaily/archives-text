# No. 2 Card readies for Huskies

### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Perfection. It feels so sweet — yet
it can be so fleeting.
No. 2 Stanford (23-8.9-0 Pacific 10
Conference) has gotten off to its best
conference start ever, sweeping its
first three Pae-10 series. The Cardinal
is hitting a blistering .363 in Pac-10
play and the young Stanford staff is
holding conference opponents to
only 3.18 runs a game. On the field, it
seems like everything is going the
Cardinal's way.
How long can this surprising run
continue?

"We're very pleased with our
start," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We've found ways to win a lot
of close games. But, starting this
weekend, it's going to get very
tough."
The tough stretch begins this
weekend as Stanford travels to Seat
tle to take on No. 25 Washington (17-
9, 6-3 Pac-10). A week from now.

USC, surging after a dismal start,
comes to Palo Alto for a three-game
set. Then, the Cardinal goes to Berke
ley to face Cal, always eager to play
spoiler to Stanford's success.
Even with this daunting schedule
staring Stanford in the face, it would
be fun to imagine the Cardinal romp
ing unscathed through the revamped
Pac-10.
However, Coach Marquess and
the Cardinal do not live in such a fan
tasy world. Just winning two of three
at Husky Ballpark this weekend
"would be huge," Marquess said.
"What some people don't realize
is that, if you don't play well on a
weekend, you can be swept by any
team in our conference," Marquess
said. "And, even if you play well and
you face a hot team, you can get
beat."
The Huskies, who have lost two of
their last three, are not exactly hot,
but they do have the great equalizer
in baseball: good pitching.
Junior Jeff Heaverlo (5-1, 2.86
ERA), scheduled to throw tonight, is
probably one of the best pitchers in
college baseball. Mixing a live fastball
with a hard-breaking slider, the right
hander has recorded 68 strikeouts
and allowed only 47 hits in just under
57 innings of work.
"He's tough," Marquess said.
"He'll be one of the better, if not the
best, pitcher we'll face this year. II
he's really on, he's tough to beat, just
like if [Stanford sophomore Jason)
Young is on, he's tough to beat."

Tonight I luskv fans will get to lind
out just how tough Young — who
usually warms up to Jimi I lendrix
is as he tries to put Washington bat
ters in a purple haze.
The tall, confident right-hander
has himself emerged as one of the

best pilchcrs in the nation, lie fore the
season began. Young (6-1. 2.70
ERA) was not even penciled in as
Stanford's top starter. I lowevor.after
improving his control, he has been
