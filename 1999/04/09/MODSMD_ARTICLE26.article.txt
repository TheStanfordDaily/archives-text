## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
All eight teams in the conference
are nationally ranked in the top 15.
The team in the cellar of the con
ference is No. 7 in the country.

And the No. 8 Stanford softball
team (30-9, 2-4 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) finds itself smack in the middle
of this race.
This weekend the Cardinal will
host No. 12 Oregon (29-10,4-2) and
No. 13 Oregon State (27-12, 2-4).

trying to gain ground in the Pac-10
conference standings.
"With the insanely difficult Pac
10,every game is crucial," said senior
Marcv ( vouch. "We must beat the
()regon teams to finish in the top of
the conference."
Currently, the Cardinal finds it
self fifth in the conference, but it has
already taken the notoriously diffi
cult road trip to top-ranked IJCI.A
and No. 4 Washington. Solid play on
this trip earned Stanford one victory,
and the Cardinal split at home
against No. 14 California the follow
ing weekend.

Bl Tomorrow: No. 8 Stanford (30-9,
2-4 Pacific 10 Conference) vs. No. 13

Stanford Softball ('omplex.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. No. 12 ()re

Of crucial importance to the Car
dinal this weekend will be capitaliz
ing on its home-field advantage.
"After splitting with Cal at home
last weekend, winning at home (this
weekend] is very important," said
Stanford head coach John Kittman.
"The conference and the road are so
tough that you want to take care <>l
home field advantage."
Standing in the way of a sweep are
two solid Oreuon teams.

Saturday brings the OS II Heavers
to the diamond, a team led by its
strong pitching staff. Junior Tarrah
Beyster( 16-7) holds a 1.21 ILKA and
freshman Crystal Draper (11-5) is
right behind with a 1.52 .
At the plate, Beyster tops the
charts for the Beavers as well, and
leads the team in home runs (eight)
and is second in KB Is (19).
OSU's momentum was snapped
last weekend as Oregon swept the
Beavers in two close games 6-5 ami
Id.
While the Beavers rely on their
pitching, the Ducks have ;i potent of
fensive threat. Freshman ealchei
Missy Coe is cruising through her
first year with a team leading batting
average of .430. nine home runs. 12
doubles and 37 runs scored. The
powerful squad has blasted a total of
4<S home runs and has a .505 slugging
percentage.
Oregon senior Katie \lackey is
also a threat from the plate and her
performance two weeks ago against
Arizona and Arizona State earned
her National Fastpitch Coaches As
sociation National Player of the
Week. In the two games, she batted
.714 (5 for 7) with two homers and
five RBls.
Though strong from the plate, the
()regon pitching staff finds itself last
in the Pac-10 with a 2.(K) ERA and

has allowed 110 runs.
In comparison to the Ducks, the
Cardinal pitching duo of Crouch
(17-4) and senior Becky Blevins (13-
5) have compiled a 1.14 ERA and al
lowed only 48 runs.
Blevins, who had been injured for
the past three weeks, is making a
strong comeback and will pitch this
weekend.
"Becky is getting her rhythm
back and pitched well at Sacramento
State [on Tuesday]," Rittman said.
Along with Blevins, the health of
freshman Jessica Mendoza is im
proving as well. Mendoza's recovery
from mononucleosis is critical to the
Cardinal as she is batting a team high
.491, and leads the team in home
runs (7), hits (53) and RBIs (42). She
is also atop the Pac-10 standings in
batting average and second is slug
ging percentage (.824).
The key for the Cardinal this
weekend will be putting together
two complete, solid games. The
team has had a tendency to let down
its play in the second game of the
doubleheaders. This is evidenced by
losses in the second game of all three
split doubleheaders this season.
"If we want to finish in the top
half of the Pac-10, we need to main
tain the intensity of the first game
through a complete 14 innings,"
Crouch said.
Rittman elaborated on this point.
"In the second game we have had
a couple of innings of not executing,
and this is costing us against good
teams," Rittman said. "Down the
stretch preparing for the postseason
and regionals we need to overcome
that."
