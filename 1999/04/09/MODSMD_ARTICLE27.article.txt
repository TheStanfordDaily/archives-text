# Volleyball prepares for Slugs

Finally, a team that actually lives
up to its name.
The I JC-Santa C ruz Banana Slugs
(4-14), who face the 15th-ranked
Stanford men's volleyball team (9-9)
tonight, fulfills many of the connota
tions that a slug might conjure.
With seven losses in their last eight
games, and only four wins the entire
season, Santa (Yuz's season has been
rather sluggish to say the least.
The Cardinal expect a level of
competition that lags considerably
behind the usual Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation teams that Stan
ford battles. Unlike the Cardinal,
which competes in the N( A As most
competitive division, the Banana
Slugs are one of only three Division
111 teams Stanford plays this season.
With no volleyball scholarships and a
gym that has a maximum occupancy

of only 3(X). the Santa Cruz athletic
environment pales in comparison to
that of Stanford.
"This game should give us a good
break and keep us competitive with
out being too exhaustive," said
sophomore middle blocker Dan
Zhang.

matchup against Stanford is one such
game. Against MPSF teams, the dis
parity between the Slugs and the
MPSF schools is obvious: Santa Cruz
has lost three-game decisions to Pa
cific. UCLA. USC and UC-San

Diego.
Perhaps another reason the Ba
nana Slugs have lined up these non
conference matches is to legitimize
themselves within theMPSK In2(XX).
the MPSF will expand to allow two
new teams into the conference. Santa
('ruz is one of the teams looking t( i till
one of these slots.
Although the Slugs seek an even
tual invitation to the elite club of
MPSF' schools. Stanford is struggling
to attain one of the Inst spots in this
year's MPSF Tournament that be
gins April 24. Tonight' game will not
affect the Cardinal's postseason am
bitions. but will be an opportunity to
mix up the Stanford lineup and exe
cute new plays in a match situation.
One Stanford adjustment will
occur at the setter position. Al
