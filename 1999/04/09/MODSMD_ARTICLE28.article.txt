# Volunteer Narayanan lives a life of constant motion

Senior Divya Narayanan dislikes apathy.
"Not just in regards to service," she said, "but in re
gard to life, like people who say 'whatever.' I don't like
the word 'whatever.'"
Narayanan, who is majoring in biology and minoring
in English, has been serving her community her entire
life. Currently she is a tutor coordinator for
Ravenswood Reads, a program that helps elementary
school kids in East Palo Alto improve their reading
skills.
"It's really more similar to teaching than tutoring,"
she said. "We had a mixer recently with some of the
teachers... and they told us We don't always say it, but
we can see some progress.'"
Narayanan has also helped coordinate the Stanford
Community Carnival for children from East Palo Alto
and volunteered as a Cowell HIV counselor. As a fresh
man, she and her friends founded Sahali, a South Asian
women's organization.
She and her parents moved to the United States from

India when she was four years old. Her father is a fi
nance professor at the University of Michigan's busi
ness school, while her mother is a computer program
mer for her local county government.
Narayanan feels that her passion for community ser
vice comes from her parents. In high school, she and her
mother visited nursing homes, painting the women's
nails and leading book club discussions. •
"We don't celebrate a lot of holidays — American
ones — so we'd do Meals on Wheels. That's when no
one wants to work, so we'd do it," she said.
Community service "was integrated into family life
and spending time together.... When Igo back [home),
my mom usually signs me up for something," she said.
Narayanan intends to take a year off and teach biol
ogy before going to medical school.
She is currently interested in reproductive health,
but "you don't find out about a lot of fields until you get
in med school," she said.
Narayanan is happy with what she has accomplished
in her time at Stanford.
"I am proud of [knowing that] there are people here
who I've affected in some way," she said.
