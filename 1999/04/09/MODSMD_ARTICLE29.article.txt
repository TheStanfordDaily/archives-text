# Internship programs at overseas campuses grow
## 
### Keith Proctor 
Due to the success of internship
programs at Stanford's Berlin and
Kyoto centers, the Overseas Studies
Program is attempting to expand in
ternship opportunities at other
overseas centers.
The program has encountered
difficulties finding internships at
some overseas locations, however,
slowing the process at some centers
and prompting a possible revision in
Berlin.
According to Russell Berman,
director ofOSP, internships provide
"added cultural interaction as a way
to explore potential career paths
and to get a leg up on the job inter
view process."
OSP has two well-established in
ternship programs, in Kyoto and in
Berlin. Kyoto's Stanford Center for
Technology and Innovation re
quires students to work as interns in
corporations or research labs fol
lowing a quarter of study. The
Berlin program, 15 years and more
than S(H) interns after its inception,
has what Berman refers to as the
"full gamut" of opportunities to at
tract students of all fields.
"Ever since high school, when I
read about the establishment of the
SCTI program. I had wanted to at

tend Stanford," said Helena Yan,
class of '94, who enrolled in the
Kyoto program in 1993. Yan, a com
puter science major, joined the Ora
cle Corporation immediately after
graduation.
"Because of [the internships']
popularity and effectiveness, we've
begun to explore similar opportuni
ties in other places," Berman said.
"We're trying to institutionalize in
ternships."
The process, Berman admitted,
is not easy and requires "consider
able resources." Aside from logisti
cal on-site difficulties, such as sup
plying overseas staffs, OSP also
deals with local problems overseas,
often attributed to limited job op
portunities for native workers. High
unemployment and strict labor
laws, particularly in the case of the
Santiago program, limit the ability
of students to find work.
"We're trying to work it out,"
said Berman, "but in some countries
the opportunities don't exist."
Berman conceded that the
Puebla program is still too young to
consider adding an internship pro
gram. but he pointed out that in
ternship possibilities have devel
oped in Florence, Moscow and Paris
— though these opportunities are
not as extensive as Kyoto's or

Berlin's.
But Berlin's success is not closed
to criticism, and OSP is currently
considering revisions to the pro
gram. The revisions, possibly to be
instituted for the 2000-01 year,
would require students to begin
their internships during spring quar
ter at the latest.
Currently, students may study in
Berlin and then take advantage of
internships during the summer
months. While this possible revision
would require students to stop out
during part of the school year for
their internships, Berman believes
the internship program might be
come more successful.
"Summer internships are harder
to get and not as high of quality as we
would like them to be," Berman
said. Because many internships cur
rently take place in the summer
months, Berman noted students
often find it difficult to obtain a qual
ity experience when their employers
are away for summer vacation.
Berman stressed that this change
by OSP would not require students
to give up summer internships, only
that they begin them during the
school year. "A student might start
an internship during April and then
end it in June or maybe in Septem
ber — it's their choice."
