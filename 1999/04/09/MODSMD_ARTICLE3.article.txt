# Overseas Studies pioneers online class spanning three continents

Engineering classes are shown on television.
Human Biology problem sets are turned in via the
Web. But the latest department to benefit from new
technology is a somewhat unexpected recipient: Com
parative Literature.
Last quarter, the Overseas Studies Program part
nered with the Stanford Learning Lab in the creation
and execution of a new Web-based course, "Compar
ative Literature 92: Literary Institutions."
Twenty-two students from five overseas campuses
— Paris, Oxford, Berlin. Santiago and Florence — par
ticipated in the class led by Russell Berman, professor
of German Studies and director of OSP.
"We have been working to add flexibility to student
planning, because a student's distance from campus
can cause difficulties. With multi-site courses, student
dispersion can be an advantage that can in turn be built
into the curriculum," Berman said.
Students post responses to their assigned reading in
an online forum and join in weekly online chat sessions
to discuss class material. The Learning Lab developed
the software, which some freshmen Area One courses
also use for online forums. In an attempt to personal
ize the communication, postings include a small pass
port photo next to the student's name.
The overall reaction to the course was positive, ac
cording to Berman.

"We learned a lot about the potential and the
strength of multi-site classes," he said. "It helped us to
rethink how students learn from one another so that
we can continue to improve."
Although Berman reported few difficulties involv
ing the students in conversation, the online discussion
system still has some kinks.
Jennifer Lay Shvu, a junior who took the "Literary
Institutions" course from Oxford, told the Stanford
Report that participating in the online chat rushed her
thought process.
"It's jarring having 20 people trying to comment on
everyone else's comments. Ideas become obsolete
very quickly in a chat. Once you're finished typing out
what you wanted to say, the conversation has moved
on to a new topic," Shyu said.
"I wish that the professor would home in on one
idea and be careful not to go off with others. It's very
exclusionary, especially when the rest of us are still
pondering on the original question." she said.
Unlike students in typical literature classes, the stu
dents focused their discussions on how a work pertains
specifically to cultural topics. They then explored
these topics through observation and research in their
overseas environments.
Berman explained, "This is a different kind of
course. It is not meant for a class where students are
just led through the material."
The second half of the course in
cluded group research encouraging
students to explore and compare
their host country's public libraries,
schools, theaters and television.
Beyond working on line, stu
dents meet regularly at their re
spective centers to speak with oth
ers about the class.

Both a literature and a religious
studies multi-site course will be of
fered next winter.
OSP also intends to offer the
multi-site experience to students
participating from the Stanford
campus.
They hope to recruit some of
last quarter's participants to act as
mentors for future classes.
OSP is currently accepting ap
plications to study abroad for next
winter. The deadline is April 6.
