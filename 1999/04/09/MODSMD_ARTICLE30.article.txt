# Search for LGBCC full-time director shifts into high gear
## 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
With the April 30 application deadline approach
ing, the search for a full-time director at the Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual Community Center is accelerating.
Led by Assoc. Dean of Students Morris Graves, the
search spans the United States with job postings ap
pearing in the Journal of Higher Education and on e
mail lists throughout the country.
"We already have more than 20 or 25 applications.
It's going well," LGBCC Interim Director Nana How
ton said. "Lots of very qualified people are applying,
and I think we'll have a lot more by the deadline."
The incoming applications will be read by the
search committee for the new director.
On May 10 candidate finalists will be brought to
campus to participate in community forums and to
meet with administrators. The forums will coincide
with Stanford's Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian Awareness
Days.
"We want student participation in the selection
process. The forums serve as a sort of open-ended in
terview with candidates," said Zack Allen, a graduate
student in Latin American Studies and search com
mittee member. "That way candidates can understand
the needs of the community here."
According to Allen, the committee is following a
fast-paced timeline so the new director will be chosen
by the end of the quarter.
The search committee, which will meet weekly dur
ing the selection process, has eight members and re
ports to Graves. John Reuling, director of information
technology at the Medical School, serves as the com
mittee's chair.
Members include Howton; Asst. English Prof.
Sharon Holland; Assoc. Dean of Religious Life Mau
rice Charles; Cathy Levinson, president of the Gay
and Lesbian Alumni Association; and Nancy Harris,

administrative associate for the Dean of Students Of
fice.
The ASSU Nominations Commission, in charge of
nominating students to committees, chose Allen and
Micah Carvalho, a senior in biology and anthropology,
to serve as student representatives on the committee.
The full-time director's administrative tasks will in
clude creating new programs while evaluating existing
ones, helping to develop administration policies, writ
ing grant proposals and fundraising.
The director will also be responsible for promoting
the needs of Stanford's lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgendered community.
According to Allen, the director can also serve as a
source of "institutional memory," making sure pro
jects and momentum are continued when student vol
unteers graduate or leave.
"Lots of internal issues of race, gender and class in
equality have been voiced. Someone in a director po
sition could help facilitate discussion processes,"
Allen added. The new director "can help build bridges
across race, class, gender and sexual-identity lines."
Though previous requests for a full-time director
had been denied because of the administration's bud
get concerns, the Dean of Students Office converted
both the LGBCC and Women's Center part-time di
rector positions to full-time, permanent directors in
response to student demands for the positions.
The decision was catalyzed by former LGBCC
part-time Director Gwendolyn Dean's sudden resig
nation last November. The additional funding for the
positions will come from the Dean of Students Office.
"Montoya and Wais did a good job of reviewing
their budget in a time of budget cuts to support the
gay, lesbian and bisexual community," Allen said.
"The administration is sending a message of support.
They recognize our concerns, and they're doing what
they can in an administrative capacity to address
them."
