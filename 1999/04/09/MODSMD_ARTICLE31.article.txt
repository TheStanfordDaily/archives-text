### Mo Eger Contributing writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
water polo team (15-3, 8-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) begins
play for its first-ever league champi
onship title this morning when it
takes on No. 15 Pacific (6-14. 0-9) at
IJCLA's Sunset Recreation Center.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Today-Sunday: No. 2 Stanford (15-
3,8-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) at MPSF Tournament, UCLA
Sunset Recreation Center.

The Tigers arc ranked 10th in the
MPSF and should be an easy win for
the Cardinal, who ended the regular
season tied with top-ranked IJSC
(20-1,8-1).
"()ur goal is to win the conference
championship, said assistant coach
Susan Ortwein. "We have to go out
hard, no matter who we are playing,
and plav good fundamental water
polo to start off the weekend right."
There are two brackets of five

teams in the tournament, and each
team will play the other four regard
less of wins or losses. Besides Pacific,
the Cardinal is scheduled to play UC-
Santa Barbara, San Diego State, and
the California Bears. The other
bracket includes top-ranked USC,
UCLA, Hawaii, Long Beach State
and San Jose State.
Stanford played the No. 8 Gau
chos (9-11, 3-6) last week at
deGuerre and won a close match 7-5.
Similar to the Cardinal offense, the
Gauchos have a number of strong
players who score from the two
meter position. This could pose
matchup problems, but the Cardinal
has effectively handled this in two
previous games. Regardless, the Car
dinal's versatility on defense will be
necessary to win this game.
Saturday the Cardinal is sched
uled to play sixth-ranked San Diego
State (17-10,3-6). The last meeting of
these two teams was at the A/tec's
odd-shaped home pool and the effec
tiveness of Stanford's counterattack

was lessened by its smaller dimensions.
Yet the Cardinal already has two wins
this year in games against the Aztecs
and will gain another as long as Stan-

ford plays good defense on drives and counters and then makes effective use
of its own scoring opportunities.
The Cardinal should go into its evening game against No. 3 Cal (IN-4,7-2)
having already accumulated three wins in the tournament. In early March, the
Cardinal beat the Bears at Berkeley. The score was a close 4-2 but the Cardi
nal had maintained complete control of "The Big Game."
"We did a good job last time of stopping their offense," Ortwein said. "It
will be important to be more offensive oriented in this game."
Assuming the top two teams make it to the finals, and with USC right down
the street, Sunday's championship match will give USC the closest thing to a
home-pool advantage that any team but UCLA itself will have in the tourna
ment. Stanford's downfall in last Saturday's game was not scoring any of its
nine 6-on-5 advantages. The Cardinal has been working on its man-up plays
all this week as a result.
"USC's pressure threw us off," Ortwein said. "But we are fully capable of
executing our 6-on-5 plays."
The physical nature of these teams' last two meetings makes it pretty easy
to predict a good number of kickouts (20 second ejections) for both teams.
Stanford will try to get as many people open in front of the cage as it can and
make it hard for three time All-American USC goalie Bernice Orwig to see.
