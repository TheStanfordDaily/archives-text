WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Today-Sunday: No. 2 Stanford (15-
3,8-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) at MPSF Tournament, UCLA
Sunset Recreation Center.

The Tigers arc ranked 10th in the
MPSF and should be an easy win for
the Cardinal, who ended the regular
season tied with top-ranked IJSC
(20-1,8-1).
"()ur goal is to win the conference
championship, said assistant coach
Susan Ortwein. "We have to go out
hard, no matter who we are playing,
and plav good fundamental water
polo to start off the weekend right."
There are two brackets of five

teams in the tournament, and each
team will play the other four regard
less of wins or losses. Besides Pacific,
the Cardinal is scheduled to play UC-
Santa Barbara, San Diego State, and
the California Bears. The other
bracket includes top-ranked USC,
UCLA, Hawaii, Long Beach State
and San Jose State.
Stanford played the No. 8 Gau
chos (9-11, 3-6) last week at
deGuerre and won a close match 7-5.
Similar to the Cardinal offense, the
Gauchos have a number of strong
players who score from the two
meter position. This could pose
matchup problems, but the Cardinal
has effectively handled this in two
previous games. Regardless, the Car
dinal's versatility on defense will be
necessary to win this game.
Saturday the Cardinal is sched
uled to play sixth-ranked San Diego
State (17-10,3-6). The last meeting of
these two teams was at the A/tec's
odd-shaped home pool and the effec
tiveness of Stanford's counterattack
