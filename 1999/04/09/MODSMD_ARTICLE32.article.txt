## 
### Jake Willens Contributing writer 
The ninth-ranked Stanford men's
tennis team begins a very important
weekend today at 1:30 p.m. when it
takes on a dangerous No. 12 Arizona
State team (12-4,4-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) at the Taube Family Tennis
Stadium. The Cardinal (13-2, 4-1)
will then play an equally important
match against Arizona (7-9, 2-7) to
morrow at noon.

MEN'S TENNIS
■ Today: No. 9 Stanford (13-2, 4-1
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. No. 12 Ari
zona State (12-2, 4-1), 1:30 p.m.,
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Arizona
(7-9, 2-7), noon, Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium.

The team knows that it will have
to be at its best to beat an Arizona
State team that it narrowly defeated
a couple of weeks ago. Arizona State
dominated the Cardinal in doubles,
handily winning all three matches,
and then had the Cardinal down 3-2
before senior Ryan Wolters and
Geoff Abrams came back to win
their singles matches for a 4-3 victo
ry.
Arizona State is very close to
being a top 10 team as it showed ear
lier in the season when it handed
top-ranked UCLA its only loss of
the year. Today's match should be a
good test for the Cardinal to see how

much improvement it has made in its
doubles play.
Arizona State "had us down at
their place and we were fortunate to
pull that one out," said head coach
Dick Gould. "They have three tough
doubles team that blew us out last
time, and so it will be an opportunity
to see how much improvement we
have made in that area. They also
have good depth, they fight hard.
We'll have our work cut out for us."
This weekend may be even more
important because the Cardinal re
cently dropped from No. 4 to No. 9 in
the national rankings. Although the
rankings only mean so much and can
be a little erratic, the Cardinal knows
it needs to have some big wins to es
tablish itself as one of the teams that
will host a regional in May.
"After seeing the recent rankings
and looking at how difficult our final
five matches are, I think we realized
we can't afford to let any matches
slip away," said sophomore Scotty
Scott. "I think we will be really fired
up to play today and hopefully the
results will show."
Scott and freshman K.J. Hippen
steel, were defeated in their last sin
gles matches against Arizona State.
Both said that will provide extra mo
tivation for today's match. Scott lost
to Matt dinger 7-5, 6-3, and Hip
pensteel suffered his only duel
match loss against Jeff Williams.
"I am going to try to do a few
things differently and make some
adjustments," Scott said. "I think my
game matches up well against him

and now I know more about what 1
need to do to find his weaknesses.'
Hippensteel said he feels more
confident with his game now than he
did last month. The freshman has
moved up to No. 13 in the nation in
singles and he and Wolters are No. 5
in doubles.
He has been playing extremely
tough tennis and leads the Cardinal
in winning percentage with a 14-1
dual-match record.
The Cardinal knows that it can

not afford to have any kind of let
down tomorrow against Arizona. It
beat Arizona 6-1 last month, but a
few of the matches were very close.
"Sometimes it is tough to re
bound on Saturday after a tough
match on Friday, but we absolutely
can't afford that," said sophomore
Alex Kim. "Arizona is the kind of
team that will beat you if you don't
come ready to play, and at this point
in the season every match is cru
cial."
