Stanford men's and women's
crew are off to key races against
top-ranked teams this weekend.
The men's team will be racing
against Michigan and Wisconsin in
Madison, Wis. tomorrow. The
Stanford team, currently ranked
19th, eagerly awaits competing
against eighth-ranked Wisconsin.

CREW
■ Tomorrow: No. 19 Stanford men at
Madison, Wisconsin.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford women at
Pullman, Wash.

Senior co-captain Nate Matter
said that the coming race is one of
the team's more exciting races of
the year because it offers a chance
to race a nationally-recognized
crew that they think they are com
petitive with.
"It is our best chance to make a
statement and earn respect on a na
tional level," Matter said.
Over spring break, Stanford had
a strong showing at the San Diego
Regatta. It finished seventh and
was narrowly defeated by Wiscon
sin.
Junior crew member Will Smith
described the meet as "promising

good things for the year to come"
partly due to the clear defeat over
the always-close competitor Ore
gon State.
The women's team will head
north to Pullman, Wash, to race
Washington State, Kansas State,
and Gonzaga today and tomorrow.
Their primary focus is on defeating
Washington State, to whom thcv
lost last year.
"There has been lots of im
provement since the San Diego
Regatta with the team's start and
sprint," York said "We hope to see
how much we've improved since
then."
Stanford has encountered
rough weather the last two times it
has gone to Pullman, and that has
slowed down the team times.
" The team has prepared for the
worst (weather)," said senior co
captain Katie Sears. "We have a
good chance if we pull together and
put our minds to it."
The men's and women's teams
will have both varsity and novice
boats competing while on the road.
The men and women will have the
Varsity 8 (composed of eight row
ers and a coxswain) and Novice 8
boats racing this weekend. The
women will add a Varsity 4 boat to
the water so more women can get
more competitive experience.
