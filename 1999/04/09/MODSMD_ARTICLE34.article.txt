WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
â–  Tomorrow-Sunday: No. N Stanford
(8-4) at NCAA West Regionals.

When the Stanford women's
gymnastics team went to the NCAA
Regionals last year there was little
doubt that the Cardinal had the tal
ent to win the Regional and advance
to Nationals. But what they had in
talent, they lacked in experience and
the 1998 Pacific 10 Conference
Champions failed to qualify for the
national tournament.
And so. as the eighth-ranked Car
dinal travels to Louisiana to compete
in tomorrow's NCAA Regional
Tournament, it will have more than
just talent on its side. A year older
and wiser, this year's Stanford squad
will look to build on lessons learned
from last season's Regionals experi
ence as well as those of the 1998-99
season.
"This year our whole team has
more confidence," said junior co
captain Kim Young. "We're not

going out to try and impress anybody,
we're just going to go out there and
focus on our routines and hopefully
the outcome will take care of itself."
I'his Saturday's meet pits the No.
8 Cardinal (8-4) against fifth-ranked
Louisiana State (11-6), No. 21 Ken
tucky (9-12), Central Michigan (19-
3), Auburn (2-19) and Ball State (16-
12). In order to advance to the na
tional tournament to be held April
22-24 in Salt Lake City, Utah, the
Cardinal will have to be one of the
top two teams at the Regional tour
nament. Although LSU is ranked
ahead of the Cardinal, none of the
other four teams seems to pose a for
midable threat to Stanford's chances.
Saturday's meet also marks the
Cardinal's first action since its March
26 197.200-192.2(H) victory over Cali
fornia. Against the Golden Bears,
Stanford rebounded from a disap
pointing fourth-place finish at the
conference championships a week
earlier to post its second-highest
team total of the year. Cardinal se
