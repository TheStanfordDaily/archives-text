WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
â–  Tomorrow-Sunday: No. N Stanford
(8-4) at NCAA West Regionals.

When the Stanford women's
gymnastics team went to the NCAA
Regionals last year there was little
doubt that the Cardinal had the tal
ent to win the Regional and advance
to Nationals. But what they had in
talent, they lacked in experience and
the 1998 Pacific 10 Conference
Champions failed to qualify for the
national tournament.
And so. as the eighth-ranked Car
dinal travels to Louisiana to compete
in tomorrow's NCAA Regional
Tournament, it will have more than
just talent on its side. A year older
and wiser, this year's Stanford squad
will look to build on lessons learned
from last season's Regionals experi
ence as well as those of the 1998-99
season.
"This year our whole team has
more confidence," said junior co
captain Kim Young. "We're not

going out to try and impress anybody,
we're just going to go out there and
focus on our routines and hopefully
the outcome will take care of itself."
I'his Saturday's meet pits the No.
8 Cardinal (8-4) against fifth-ranked
Louisiana State (11-6), No. 21 Ken
tucky (9-12), Central Michigan (19-
3), Auburn (2-19) and Ball State (16-
12). In order to advance to the na
tional tournament to be held April
22-24 in Salt Lake City, Utah, the
Cardinal will have to be one of the
top two teams at the Regional tour
nament. Although LSU is ranked
ahead of the Cardinal, none of the
other four teams seems to pose a for
midable threat to Stanford's chances.
Saturday's meet also marks the
Cardinal's first action since its March
26 197.200-192.2(H) victory over Cali
fornia. Against the Golden Bears,
Stanford rebounded from a disap
pointing fourth-place finish at the
conference championships a week
earlier to post its second-highest
team total of the year. Cardinal se
nior Amy Murakami continued her
stellar season while recording perfect
lOson the uneven parallel bars and in
the floor exercise. Junior Sarah
Harding also landed a perfect routine
in the floor exercise.
On Saturday, Stanford will look to
build around Murakami, who has
been the most consistent Cardinal
gymnast this season.
Murakami is currently ranked
fourth in the nation on the uneven
bars and seventh in the floor exercise.
Murakami's main competition in

the lltx>r exercise will most likely
come from Central Michigan's
Nicole Liphardt, who is ranked
fourth nationally in that event.
Aside from Liphardt, teammates
Harding and senior Tracey Kohl will
vie with Murakami for the win in the
tloor exercise.
Murakami also looks to be Stan
ford's best hope in the uneven bars
competition.
Auburn's Sarah Wentworth en
ters the meet ranked 11th in the na
tion on that event while LSU's Kim

Descalopoulis is ranked 15th.
In the balance beam competition,
Stanford will look for a high score
from sophomore Jen Exaltacion,
who is ranked 11th in that event.
Exaltacion set a school record on
the balance beam with a 9.975
against Arizona State on Feb. 19.
LSU boasts two gymnasts ranked
among the nation's top 10 in that
event. Stacey Wegener is ranked
fifth and teammate Sarah Went
worth is ranked seventh.
