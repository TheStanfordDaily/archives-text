# Stanford on the blocks in Oregon relays
## Tall order for men's track 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Saturday's weather forecast for
Eugene, Ore.: mostly cloudy, high
of 52 degrees, low of 37. Heavy
showers likely.
Looks like there's only one
place to keep warm at Oregon this
weekend: the Hayward Relays,
where there is a 100 percent chance
of hot track and field action.
Stanford is set to collide with
track superpowers Colorado and
Minnesota as well as Pacific 10
Conference rivals Oregon and
Washington State at legendary
Hayward Field in the first-ever
staging of the meet.
Stanford will send a full comple
ment of athletes to compete in to
morrow's meet, which will be high
lighted by outstanding competition
in the field events and a host of
relay races to test the depth of each
squad.
"All of our throwers are poised
to do well," said Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna.
"The high jump and pole vault
fields are also very strong," he said.
"The competition will be there —
good teams are coming — the only
difficulty could be with the weath
er."
The Cardinal throwing contin
gent will consist of Ail-American
Adam Connolly and Mark Ganek
in the hammer throw, with Ganek

joining Jeff McCarty and Chris
Sprague in the discus. Sprague and
George Curts will both throw the
shot.
Defending national champion
Toby Stevenson will challenge last
year's Pac-10 conference champion
Piotr Buciarski of Oregon in the
pole vault, and Stanford's Todd
Beyerlein and Michael Ponikvar
will battle reigning conference
champ Kyley Johnson of Oregon in
the high jump.

MEN'S TRACK
■ Today-Tomorrow: Stanford at
Oregon Relays, Hayward Field,
Oregon.

Other open event contestants
will include freshman force Evan
Kelty, who will compete against
Super Bowl star Tim Dwight (com
peting for Iowa) in the 200-meter
dash, Chad Wassink in the javelin,
and a steeple chase crew of Don
Kennedy and Jamey Gifford.
A couple of Cardinal athletes to
keep an eye on are hurdlers
Michael Harte and Jeff Allen.
Harte posted a solid time of 14.39
seconds in the 110 hurdles at last
week's Johnny Mathis Open, and
Allen is returning from shin prob
lems to the form which earned him
a spot in the 400 hurdles at the
NCAA championship meet two
years ago.

"Both Michael and Jeff will
have a big impact on the team this
year," Lananna said.
"They've both already qualified
for Pac-lOs, where I expect they
will both reach the finals and score
points for us."
Lananna expects solid outings
from both hurdlers in their respec
tive fortes this weekend, including
possible NCAA-meet qualifying
marks.
Relay races will include the 100-
meters realy, 4(X) relay, 800 relay
and the distance medley relay,
which is comprised of 1,200-meter,
400-meter, 800-meter and 1,600-
meter legs.
The Hayward Relays will fea
ture only one distance race aside
from the medley relay, the steeple
chase, as many top-caliber runners
are preparing for next week's Mt.
San Antonio College meet.
Nevertheless, the Eugene at
mosphere, which has earned the
city the nickname "Tracktown,
USA," will likely prove conducive
to top performances in all of the
scheduled events.
"It's always exciting to compete
at Hayward Field, because there
are a lot of knowledgeable track
fans who come out to watch,"
Lananna said.
"The Oregon coaches have re
ally done a good job putting the
meet together. Now we just have to
hope for good weather."
