The fifth-ranked Stanford women's tennis team (18-2,
4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) will try to maintain its momen
tum as it heads to Arizona this weekend.
The Cardinal will play Arizona (7-10, 3-2) today and
No. 11 Arizona State (11-5,3-2) tomorrow.
The women are inspired and confident after disman
tling seventh-ranked rival California Tuesday. Assistant
coach Lele Forood insists that her squad will build on that
confidence rather than suffer a letdown after the big win.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Today: No. 5 Stanford (18-2,4-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
at Arizona (7-10,3-2), 1:30 p.m.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford at No. 11 Arizona State (11-5, 3-
2), 11:00 a.m.

"It's not hard to keep the intensity when you're on the
road," she said. "We'll realize what we're there to do."
The last time the Cardinal faced Arizona in early
March, Stanford posted a solid 7-2 victory. This time, vic
tory may come even easier, as every player on the Stan
ford team is healthy and playing excellent tennis. Also,
Arizona has slipped dramatically in the latest team rank
ings.
The Wildcats are now ranked a dismal 56th after hav
ing been ranked in the top 30 for much of the season.
Arizona State, on the other hand, may pose a legiti
mate challenge. In the last match between the Sun Devils
and the Cardinal, the Cardinal managed a close 6-3 tri
umph.
Freshman Allison Bradshaw, who competes at the No.
1 singles position for the Sun Devils, currently enjoys her
highest ever collegiate ranking at No. 30.
Of course, Stanford's second-ranked Marissa Irvin is
prepared for Bradshaw, whom she dominated in junior
competition. Irvin routed Bradshaw, 6-1,6-2, in their sole
match at the collegiate level.
"We have a long history," Irvin said. "It's always a lit

tie more exciting when you know the player."
Bradshaw and teammate Katy Propstra are ranked
20th in the nation in doubles, but Stanford's No. 2 duo of
Irvin and junior Teryn Ashley should be able to quell that
threat.
All the Stanford women feel that they are playing
some of their best tennis right now. Irvin boasts a 31-3
record, while the team's other freshmen starters, Lauren
Kalvaria, Gabby Lastra and Keiko Tokuda, have won
their most recent singles matches.
Junior captain and All-American Ashley is also on top
of her game. Ashley crushed Cal's Amy Jensen, 6-0,6-1,
on Tuesday.
"Everyone's playing really well," Ashley said. "We
handled them last time, and we should be able to handle
them again."
