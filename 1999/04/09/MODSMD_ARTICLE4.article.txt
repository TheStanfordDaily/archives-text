### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Juniors Adam Weiss and
Jonathan Lotz, recently declared
write-in candidates for the ASSII
presidential election, focus their
platform on redefining the ASSITs
vision and addressing student group
needs.
Weiss and Lotz's fliers went up
yesterday morning, and they have
been actively campaigning to inform
students of their candidacy.


Caroline Conway â€” Daily
Juniors Adam Weiss and Jonathan Lotz are candidates for ASSU
president and vice president, respectively.
Weiss is senate chair this year, was
a senator last year and is the Interfra
ternity Council Vice President of Fi
nance. Lotz is on the ASSU Presi
dential Cabinet, the Stanford Judicial
Panel and the Stanford Committee
on Public Events.
Weiss and Lotz's platform focuses
on three main areas that they believe
essential to the ASSU's role: student
populations and diversity, student
space and internal reform.
Weiss describes their vision as one
in which the ASSU is an "advocate of
the students" and diversity is reflect
ed, not concerning just race, but rang
ing from "ethnic minorities to Greeks
to grads to undergrads, to advocacy
groups." Student group dynamics is a
significant focus that falls under this
umbrella vision.
The ASSU "can be a mechanism
for forging personal and inter-group
relationships," Weiss said. "Many is
sues that are taboo on this campus we
want to bring to the forefront to see if
we can foster discussions among
groups on these topics."
Weiss cites tenure reform as an ex
ample of an issue that can garner stu
dent group involvement, although he
emphasizes that he does not want all
the groups to conform to one stance.
"We see our office as a point of
convergence," Weiss said. "We want
to reach out to groups that don't
think they have a part in an issue like
the tenure process. They may not
want to protest it, depending on their
views, and we are not putting forth a
specific viewpoint. What we want is
to have a variety of student voices in
volved."
Weiss and Lotz want to meet with
student group leaders on a regular
basis to provide support for their
causes.
"I can see us sitting down within

the first couple of days and asking stu
dent leaders, 'What can we do for
you?' and then working on those is
sues," Weiss said. "I think this is what
separates our campaign from others.
We are encouraging groups to partic
ipate in the ASSU, and the burden is
on us to prove to these groups that
there is ASSU advocacy. There is a
sense of reciprocity there."
Lotz's past work in securing Frost
Amphitheater as a more available
venue for student events is an exam
ple of what Weiss and Lotz hope to
address for student space.
"Frost is a great resource that
often can't be used by students since
renting facilities is so expensive,"
Lotz said. "What we would like to do
is form a special fee for Frost or for
the groups that use Frost. Also, we
could divide costs. If we rented a
dressing room for the whole year and
then divided that cost among all the
groups that used it throughout that
time, it would be considerably less ex
pensive."
Lotz has worked with Stanford
Events Director Lois Wagner to con
sider these possibilities and is in con
tact with Vice Provost for Institution
al Planning Geoff Cox about the mat
ter. Weiss said that other issues of stu
dent space that they wish to address
are student groups that do not have
meeting places, housing for addition
al fraternities and sororities, the cre
ation of a day-care for students with
children and the implementation of a
more effective student union that
both undergraduates and graduates
can use.
Weiss and Lotz plan to implement
their student space ideas by maintain
ing a direct and healthy relationship
with the administration.
Current ASSU President Maren
Norton and Vice President Santos
Marroquin "have developed a really
long-lasting relationship with the ad
ministration, and we want to keep
those up," Weiss said. "We want to

be sitting down with the administra
tion and not having heated but mean
ingful discussions about issues that
can yield success."
Weiss and Lotz also want to im
prove the current funding process for
student groups as a part of internal re
form.
"As senate chair, I've experienced
the dissatisfaction that student
groups face by confusing and convo
luted banking procedures," Weiss
said. "It pains me when groups can
achieve their goals, because they
missed a funding deadline."
Weiss said they hope to develop
closer coordination with the program
board, the appropriations committee
and student groups in order to devel
op "contacts at every level." Weiss
also emphasized that he wanted to
keep both undergraduate and gradu
ate issues at hand, because the ASSU
represents "all students' concerns."
Weiss and Lotz said that their con
siderable experience in the ASSU
and working with the administration
should facilitate the enactment of
their proposals.
"We're going after issues that we
know we can change effectively and
quickly due to the experience that we
have working with students and the
administration," Lotz said.
In an effort to create student in
volvement in the ASSU from the be
ginning, Weiss and Lotz are starting a
"get out the vote" campaign, which
includes posters that will not endorse
anyone but will simply encourage
students to vote next week.
"For every dollar that we spend
on our campaign, a quarter will go to
the 'get out the vote' campaign,"
Weiss said.
Weiss and Lotz are optimistic
about this year's election, particular
ly due to the level of experience pre
sent in all its candidates.
"All of the candidates are experi
enced, which is an asset to the Stan
ford community," Weiss said.
