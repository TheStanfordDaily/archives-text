### Jed Rose Contributing writer 
Stanford Law School students
planning to enter business or politics
will be better prepared for their fields
thanks to a new $3.2 million grant.
The gift from the James Irvine
Foundation will fund a new program
— the Initiative in Law, Business and
Public Policy — at the Law School.
The grant will also give money to
the Center for Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity and will fund a
new institute to bring artists to cam
pus.
"Our past grants to Stanford have
helped the University focus internal
ly on the increasing diversity of its
student body. This new grant aims
beyond the campus, to build stronger
links with diverse communities
across the state," said Bob Shireman,
the foundation's program director
for higher education, in a press re
lease.
Law School Dean Paul Brest will
oversee the program and the accom
panying expansion of curricular of
ferings, including internships, for the
academic year and the summer.
Brest said he was thrilled about
the grant.

"My hope is that this is going to
allow Stanford to do something ex
traordinary that will provide a model
for law schools elsewhere in the
country," he said.
Brest emphasized that the prima
ry intent of the program is to com
bine public policy and business into

the core curricu
lum for the Law
School by funding
three new posi
tions over the next
three years.
The grant also
gives money to the
Institute for Di
versity in Califor-

nia Arts, which will use the money to
bring artists to Stanford. Artists will
live at Stanford for one quarter and
receive a stipend and resources to de
velop new works. Students will have
the opportunity to serve as appren
tices to the visiting artists and attend
teaching activities led by the visiting
artists.
"I've been at Stanford for 26
years, [and] this is a wonderful mo
ment for the arts here," Drama Prof.
Charles Lyons said in a press release.
The third recipient of the grant is
the Center for Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity. The center
will use the money to assist in estab
lishing partnerships between Stan
ford and various leaders in the Bay


Brest
Area community.
The center will also start a new
Public Policy and Leadership Sum
mer Institute for undergraduates in
tending on majoring or minoring in
( SRH. Fifteen students will be select
ed to participate in the two-week res
idence-based program that takes
place just before the start of the au
tumn quarter.
The center will also start a new
summer internship program that

will give undergraduates an oppor
tunity for hands-on experience in
public policy or similar exposure
through a nonprofit governmental
agency offering public service in
ternships.
History Prof, and C-CSRE Direc
tor AI Camarillo said, "The grant
funds will allow the C-CSRE to
launch a new Community-University
Partnership project that will bring to
gether Stanford faculty and leaders
from local Bay Area communities to
address issues of urgent concern fac
ing many ethnically diverse, low-in
come neighborh(H>ds."
