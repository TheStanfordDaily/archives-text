The model space shuttle and airplane that sit on engi
neering Prof. Elisabeth Pate-Cornell's desk are signs of
both her life's work and her soaring career path.
On Feb. 8, Pate-Cornell was appointed to the Burt
and Deedee McMurtry Professorship, becoming the first
woman in Stanford engineering history to hold an en
dowed chair.
A professor who says she prides herself on "two chil
dren. a house, a dog and my marriage," Pate-Cornell also
works with NASA on unmanned space missions in its Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. In addition to this latest "first,"
Pate-Cornell was both the first woman elected to the Na
tional Academy of Engineering and Stanford's first fe
male engineering department chair, taking over the De
partment of Industrial Engineering and Engineering
Management in September 1997.
Pate-Cornell says she is "extremely grateful" for the
professorship she received, but she attributes being a pi
oneer to more than her hard work.

"A woman in the past named Mrs. Flugge-Lotz, who
was never elected to the Academy, should have been the
first woman elected," Pate-Cornell said. "I'm delighted
that I am [the first female elected], because I worked long
and hard, but it's in part that times have changed. She was
someone [for whom] the time had not come, let's say."
The School of Engineering now has five tenured
women on its faculty, a change that Pate-Cornell says
makes "a much better environment."
After arriving from France in 1971 with a master's de
gree, Pate-Cornell got another master's from Stanford in
operations research in 1972 and a doctorate in engineer
ing-economic systems in 1978. She later did engineering
work for the Air Force Science Board and United Air
lines and worked with NASA to study the reliability and
management of systems.
"Elisabeth just plows through and gets things done,"
said Industrial Engineering Prof. Robert Sutton, who has
worked with Pate-Cornell for 15 years. "The amount of
other things she's getting done while
making department chair, the
amount of research, the amount of
other responsibility she has [with]
the National Academy of Engineer
ing, where she's always flying back
[and forth], and she's got two kids â€”
it's unbelievable how much stuff she
gets done."
F-ven during this interview, Pat -

the ringing of the phone and high
pitched wail of the fax machine. Be

project with students and United

Airlines.
The Hurt and Dee Dee McMurtry
Professorship will help pay for some
of that research and for Pat6-Cor
nell's salary.
Burt McMurtry, who got his doc
torate in electrical engineering from
Stanford in 1962, and his wife
Dee Dee endowed the chair in 1986.
Their donations reaffirm a "very
strong, synergistic, intellectual and
financial relationship" between
Stanford and the community, Sutton
said.
currently teaches a
graduate course on engineering risk
analysis. She also runs an additional
project course for interested students
with United Airlines and the U.S.
Coast Guard.
Pate-Cornell calls the endowed
professorship an "unexpected, de
lightful surprise."
"It just happens," she said. "You
work hard, and it happens to you.
[Those are] the best things in life."
