The model space shuttle and airplane that sit on engi
neering Prof. Elisabeth Pate-Cornell's desk are signs of
both her life's work and her soaring career path.
On Feb. 8, Pate-Cornell was appointed to the Burt
and Deedee McMurtry Professorship, becoming the first
woman in Stanford engineering history to hold an en
dowed chair.
A professor who says she prides herself on "two chil
dren. a house, a dog and my marriage," Pate-Cornell also
works with NASA on unmanned space missions in its Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. In addition to this latest "first,"
Pate-Cornell was both the first woman elected to the Na
tional Academy of Engineering and Stanford's first fe
male engineering department chair, taking over the De
partment of Industrial Engineering and Engineering
Management in September 1997.
Pate-Cornell says she is "extremely grateful" for the
professorship she received, but she attributes being a pi
oneer to more than her hard work.

"A woman in the past named Mrs. Flugge-Lotz, who
was never elected to the Academy, should have been the
first woman elected," Pate-Cornell said. "I'm delighted
that I am [the first female elected], because I worked long
and hard, but it's in part that times have changed. She was
someone [for whom] the time had not come, let's say."
The School of Engineering now has five tenured
women on its faculty, a change that Pate-Cornell says
makes "a much better environment."
After arriving from France in 1971 with a master's de
gree, Pate-Cornell got another master's from Stanford in
operations research in 1972 and a doctorate in engineer
ing-economic systems in 1978. She later did engineering
work for the Air Force Science Board and United Air
lines and worked with NASA to study the reliability and
management of systems.
"Elisabeth just plows through and gets things done,"
said Industrial Engineering Prof. Robert Sutton, who has
worked with Pate-Cornell for 15 years. "The amount of
