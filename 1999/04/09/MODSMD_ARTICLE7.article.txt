# 'Sleep' Prof. Dement publishes new book
## 
### Anuj Gupta Staff writer 
A longtime Stanford professor
and researcher has released a new
book that appears to have all the
makings of a "sleeper" hit.
Sleep disorder expert and Psy
chiatry Prof. William Dement, who
teaches the popular Human Biolo
gy 11: "Sleep and Dreams,"
likened his work, "The Promise of
Sleep," to "an introductory text
book on sleep for the American
public."
Dement's book, which has been
featured in recent weeks on "Good
Morning America"and in USA
Today, has often appeared in on

line bookseller Amazon.corn's top
20 bestseller list since its release
last month.
Dement said he feels that, other
than at Stanford, there is virtually
no education on sleep "at the 3,300
colleges and universities and the
126 medical schools in this coun
try."
With his book. Dement said he
hopes to emphasize the impor
tance of sleep disorders, which
have been grossly underrated by
most Americans.
"[The book] is sort of an intro
duction to this huge third of our
lives that our educational system
completely ignores as if it were
simple and there were very little to

know,"he said.
According to Dement, there are
at least 88 "specific diagnosable,
treatable sleep disorders," which
people can fall victim to.
"Almost nobody knows they
exist, except people feel the symp
toms," Dement said.
The disorders range from com
mon difficulties such as snoring and
insomnia to potentially fatal ail
ments, such as obstructive sleep
apnea, in which victims stop
breathing while asleep.
Dement pointed to obstructive
sleep apnea as the most dangerous,
major sleep disorder that the public
must be made aware of.
"In my conservative estimate,
50,000 people will die unnecessari
ly in the coming year," from such
disorders, Dement said.
However, in the introduction to
the book, Dement reveals what he
believes is the biggest danger:
"After all the research I've done on
sleep problems over the past four
decades, my most significant find
ing is that ignorance is the worst
sleep disorder of them all," he
writes.
Dement said he kept the lan
guage of the book clear and un
complicated with the average
American in mind.
"It's written so that almost any
one can absorb it and understand
it," Dement said. "I was really writ
ing it for 'Joe Six-pack."'
The book is divided into four
main sections, each dealing with a
different element of sleep. In the
first, called "The Fundamentals of
Sleep," Dement attempts to ex
plain normal sleep, the concept of
sleep debt, the biological clock and
circadian rhythms of sleep.
The second section, called
"When Sleep Fails," details many
sleep disorders and the treatments
available for each.
In the third, "When Sleep
Works," Dement writes about the
benefits of sleep and gives readers
a "quick tour" of sleep science.
Here, he writes, "Sleep bolsters
us in countless ways, augmenting
our feelings of happiness and vital

ity and enhancing the crucial quali
ties of mind — pleasure, motiva
tion, memory and thought — that
we need to reach our potential for
creativity, productivity and learn
ing."
The book's final section is called
"The Principles of Healthy Sleep,"
and in it Dement offers detailed ad
vice on sleep to readers, including a
final chapter that lays out a three
week "Sleep Camp" regimen to im
prove sleep and reduce tiredness.
Dement has been at Stanford
for 36 years and in 1970 founded
the world's first center on sleep dis
orders here.
That same year, he began teach
ing "Sleep and Dreams," and it has
been one of the University's most
popular classes ever since, with
nearly 400 students enrolling when
it was offered last quarter.
Dement estimates that he has
taught more than 15,000 students in
"Sleep and Dreams," and in the
book's acknowledgments he writes
that students have made his job
"much more fun than work."
In 1990, Dement was appointed
to head a congressional commis
sion called the National Commit
tee on Sleep Disorders Research.
After more than a year of study, the
committee recommended that
Congress approve funding for a
major national public awareness
campaign on the dangers of sleep
disorders.
Much to Dement's disappoint
ment, Congress did not allocate
any funds for such a campaign. He
said he warned legislators that "the
national sleep debt is far more dan
gerous than the national monetary
debt."
"I said they'd solve the mone
tary problem before they solved
the sleep debt, and I've been
proved right: they eliminated the
budget deficit," Dement said.
Dement said his experience with
Congress was a major motivational
factor in deciding to write the book.
"Having failed in Congress, I
decided that I had to do it by my
self," he said.
