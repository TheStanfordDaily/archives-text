### Anuj Gupta Staff writer 
A longtime Stanford professor
and researcher has released a new
book that appears to have all the
makings of a "sleeper" hit.
Sleep disorder expert and Psy
chiatry Prof. William Dement, who
teaches the popular Human Biolo
gy 11: "Sleep and Dreams,"
likened his work, "The Promise of
Sleep," to "an introductory text
book on sleep for the American
public."
Dement's book, which has been
featured in recent weeks on "Good
Morning America"and in USA
Today, has often appeared in on

line bookseller Amazon.corn's top
20 bestseller list since its release
last month.
Dement said he feels that, other
than at Stanford, there is virtually
no education on sleep "at the 3,300
colleges and universities and the
126 medical schools in this coun
try."
With his book. Dement said he
hopes to emphasize the impor
tance of sleep disorders, which
have been grossly underrated by
most Americans.
"[The book] is sort of an intro
duction to this huge third of our
lives that our educational system
completely ignores as if it were
simple and there were very little to

know,"he said.
According to Dement, there are
at least 88 "specific diagnosable,
treatable sleep disorders," which
people can fall victim to.
