Just about everyone has a
stomach problem at some
time or another. Fortunately,
many of the symptoms can
be treated with self-care. Here
are six common troubles, and what
you can do about them.
1. Heartburn 8 Indigestion
Description: Heartburn (dys
pepsia) results from stomach
acids backing up into the eso
phagus, which connects the
mouth to the stomach. Indiges
tion is that hard-to-describe upset
feeling in your stomach.
Causes: Alcohol, caffeine, nicotine,
chocolate, citrus, tomato, pepper
mint, fried and fatty foods, over
eating, stress, some medications,
and being overweight.
Self-Care: Avoid or moderate
your use of the above, and eat
smaller meals more frequently.
For heartburn, do not lie down for
four hours after eating, and raise
the head of your bed 4-6 inches.
Try an over-the-counter neutral
izing antacid (e.g., generic Maalox
or Mylanta), or an acid reducer
(e.g., Pepcid, Tagamet, or Zantac).
Seek Medical Advice: If it doesn't
respond to self-help, persists more
than two weeks, or if you have
significant pain or weight loss.
Call 724-CARE (724-2273) and
press 4.
2. Vomiting
Causes: Viruses, bacteria, food poi
soning, alcohol, stress, pregnancy.
Self-Care: Let your stomach rest.
Don't eat or drink until you feel
better (2 to 4 hours). Then start
with tiny sips of clear non-carbon
ated fluids (e.g.: flat ginger-ale or
7-Up, or Gatorade) for another few

infrequent stools.
Causes: Insufficient water and

tables, prunes), diet (e.g.: too much
rice, cheese), lack of exercise,
occasionally medications (e.g.,
prescription pain and cough
medicine).
Self-Care: Increase fluids and
fiber.
Watch for: Severe pain or rectal
bleeding.
Seek Medical Advice: If consti
pation persists despite self-care.
6. Gas
Causes: Specific foods (e.g. beans,
cabbage), too much fiber, car
bonated beverages, chewing gum.
Self-Care: Avoid the above; try
products with simethicone (e.g.,
Mylicon, Gas-X).
