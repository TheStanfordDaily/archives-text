Yesterday's Founder's Day
celebration drew members of the
Stanford community to com
memorate the founding of the
University and the legacy of the
Stanford family.
"Today we honor all three
members of the Stanford found
ing family, and we thank those
whose noble self-sacrifice gave
us the foundation of this fine uni

Gerhard Casper said at the
Founder's Day ceremony held in
Memorial Church.
Provost Condoleezza Rice,
the featured speaker of the day,
offered her "Reflections of a
Provost."
"It has been a wonderful six
years; there is no place like Stan
ford University because of the
people here," Rice said.
She shared her vision of edu

it is like to be human and said
that the educated person is privi

are enriching and humbling.

when they've remembered that
knowledge has no national
boundaries and when they pro
vide protective space for the
transforming experience that is
higher education," Rice said.

fords have sufficiently con

by providing students with the
opportunity for this transform
ing experience.
Lori Vincere, a second year
law student, and junior Meghann
Evershed also offered presenta
tions. Both won contests held on
the undergraduate and graduate
levels to select speakers for the
occasion.
"Today we honor the Stan
fords for their vision, their pas
sion and their lives," Vincere
said.
"We prove our own principles
to the world by becoming
founders of other great new
worlds. We are the pioneers of
