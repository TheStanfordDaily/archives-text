## ENDORSEMENTS Editorial A 						poor foundation 
### 
We do not endorse the
proposal for a separate
graduate student body

After scrutinizing pages of
material and deliberating for
hours, we strongly encourage stu
dents to vote against the constitutional
amendment on the ASSIJ election ballot.
The bill calls for a split of the ASSU Sen
ate into undergraduate and graduate com
ponents: the ASSIJ Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council.
In its current form, the amendment pro
vides little constitutional protection for the
GSC. As opposed to the current system
that governs the ASSU Senate, an indepen
dent GSC would be governed by internal
bylaws, which lack the strong foundation
and permanence that constitutional regula-

tions provide.
The proposed system allows
for both the creation and destruc
tion of bylaws at any time based
solely on the two-thirds vote of
those GSC members present.
Further, we continue to be

troubled by the fact that the primary
method of decision-making within the GSC
would be a consensus majority. While this
system may be effective with the GSC's cur
rent make-up, who is to say that it will con
tinue to be the best way of governing the
GSC in the future? We cannot design a sys
tem of government that is so highly depen
dent on agreement between the GSC's
members during a given year, even if such
agreement exists today.
Proponents of the amendment argue
that different governing rules for the under
graduate body and the GSC are necessary
because the needs of the two student groups
are different. Many say that graduate stu
dents just don't have time to run their gov
erning body the way undergraduates do.
No one will dispute that Stanford stu
dents are all busy people, whether at the
graduate or undergraduate level. Clearly,
the schedules of undergraduates and gradu
ate students are markedly different. But
government cannot be run on the basis of
when people think it is "convenient." In

order to be effective and taken seriously,
government must adhere to strict guidelines
and force its members to make sacrifices so
that participation is a privilege, not a right.
A split like this one has the potential of
being very effective, because it allows each
group to focus on matters specific to its
respective constituents. But such a split
needs to be done in an even manner. A
graduate student body should be held to the
same standards as the undergraduate body.
Perhaps there is a new system of student
government yet to be implemented that
would combine the strong points of both
types of government. Should such a split
later be suggested, it might appease both
undergraduates and graduates while still
applying a consistent standard across the
board.
We recognize and appreciate the work
of the GSC members this year. They have

worked tirelessly at making the
University a better place for grad
uate students by lobbying for
more graduate housing and plan
ning a Thanksgiving dinner for
students who wouldn't otherwise
have been able to enjoy a holiday

meal.
But the dedication of this year's mem
bers is no indication of what future group
members will be like. The constitutional
amendment only requires that an indepen
dent GSC hold "regular" meetings â€” a
term that could be construed as once a
month or once a year. Though this year's
GSC members are a committed group that
has accomplished a lot, the amendment
depends on future members of the GSC
having the same level of commitment,
something that cannot be guaranteed.
While an independent GSC's accom
plishments in the next school year would
undoubtedly provide benefits for its con
stituents, we feel that further constitutional
safeguards will protect the GSC's long-term
viability.
We agree that a change in the ASSU
Senate's current structure would have tan
gible positive effects for the campus, but we
disagree with the current proposal and
encourage further refinement of the
amendment during the coming vear.
