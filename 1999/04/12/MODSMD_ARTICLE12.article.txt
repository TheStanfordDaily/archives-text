There are many
strong points in
the amendment

Although there are defi
nite structural and procedural
weaknesses to the proposed con
stitutional amendment as it stands, a leg
islative split in the ASSU will still greatly
enhance the body's effectiveness in
addressing graduate student concerns.
The Graduate Student Council has thus
far proven itself to be much more produc
tive than a combined ASSU Senate in han
dling issues such as graduate student hous
ing.
Centralizing the GSC under the ASSU
executive office and alongside an under
graduate senate will contribute greatly to
the GSC's future effectiveness by enhanc
ing its official status and giving it a steady
source of financial and administrative
resources. It is in the interest of students to
support this group because, for example,
separate senates will be able to focus their
full attention on issues of interest to their
respective populations.
An argument that has been raised

against the amendment states that there
would be fewer constitutional safeguards
on the GSC than on the Undergraduate
Senate.
However this argument anticipates sce
narios that may not occur for a number of
years, while the immediate benefits of the
amendment come from matters of some
urgency. Rejecting the amendment and
approving a revised version in a year is an
unacceptable option to students concerned
with meeting basic needs such as housing
and health care. Further, any operational
difficulties that the GSC may face can be
revised in the future through changes in
bylaws or even constitutional modifica
tions.
In the worst case, the future govern
ment is unlikely to be less effective than
the current one and is probably worth the
risk given the potential benefits of the new
system.
The need for a legislative body that rep
resents graduate student needs is undeni
able, and reform should not be delayed by
political disagreements. Serving student
needs should be the first priority of every
voter, and passage of this amendment is
key to meeting that goal.
