## Making the best of what's around

I EXPECTED spring
to be here by now.
This week was sup
posed to be all about get
ting to the beach before
the workload got too
heavy and working on the
first bit of the sun-kissed
glow which makes tempo-

£?
rary Californians the envy of the rest of the
world, but the weather isn't cooperating. So
contemplation of the suntan will have to he
postponed, foregone in favor of ... the
ASSU elections.
It's sort of a popularity contest, a sloga
neering match, right? It's the democratic
process at work; it's our means, as a student
body, to influence who the ASSU is and
what it does. Perhaps I will betray my rela
tive lack of knowledge about the activities
of the ASSU by not specifically enumerat
ing them just now, but I doubt that in doing
so, I will be in the minority on campus.
Our annual opportunity to vote presents
us collectively with an interesting dilemma.
Better to "go to the polls" relatively unin
formed or not at all?
Of course we all have our own little
favorites for special fees. I think I find out
more about the extracurricular possibilities
that we've both created and have carried on
from past generations in the week that all of
the pleas for money are plastered all over
White Plaza than during the rest of the year.
No one's going to shortchange the multi
tude of student groups in dire need of stu
dent body support, and that is in itself a very
important part of participating in the cre
ation of our lives on campus.

Apart from the money, though, and in
terms of candidates available for class pres
ident, ASSU president and vice president
and the plethora of potential senators, what
we as a voting population are really giving
to the democratic process is possibility.
YVe afford those who want to participate
in student government the chance to do so.
We are as fickle as a given target population
could possibly be. We rely upon clever slo
gans and eye-catching flyers to assign a
value, any little spark of recognition, to a
given prospective senator. (Remember "No
man can like Nauman Khan"? or "Seek him
you do. Find him you have. Steve Yoda"?)
Well. then.
I would venture to say that we have a
fairly indiscriminate way of voting, but that
it's the nature of the game.
We are impressed with proposed innova
tions for campus life but know that what is
really important to have done takes time.
Enthusiasm brought to the job, as well as
versatility and creativity, are more impor
tant than a concrete plan for serious
changes.
Change requires consensus, and if there
were a visible index for "plays well with oth
ers," would that we could just go by that.
Cool names always lend the candidate some
advantage, but apart from the occasional
rogue candidate campaigning on a platform
of more cheese in the dining halls and free
jacuzzis for all Row houses, the issues that
concern us are mostly the same from year to
year.
And this is as it should be — we aren't a
homogenous population but are a similar
cohort of people. We operate within the

same guidelines of the administration and
have fairly similar schedules (very little to
do before 9 a.m. and far more after 9 p.m.).
We experiment with the same things, have
the same constructed peak stress time and
mostly sleep in the exact same no-good
without-an-egg-crate dorm beds. It's per
fectly reasonable.
Approaching our similarities in such a
way would suggest that the outcome of a
vote is almost predetermined, but this
extends beyond simply deciding whether or
not it's worthwhile to vote.
I do not want to encourage voter apathy,
but emphasize that our elections be viewed
with a critical eye. They are a training run
for active voting in local and national elec
tions. Reactions to candidates we may
vaguely recognize belong to the same breed
of knee-jerk responses that electioneers
count on in their relentless grooming of the
politicians that we come to know through
sound bites and carefully orchestrated pub
lic appearances.
It's very important that we recognize
this. Taking ourselves too seriously is a dan
gerous thing — we lose perspective.
Taking seriously the power inherent in
the experience of engaging in our populist
political process is altogether necessary.
We have to get used to the practice of
voting, of recognizing our own individual
investment in the democratic process, in
order to make a contribution to the govern
ment we have been given and the lives we
will lead.
