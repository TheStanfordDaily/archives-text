Combating global warming

As a student involved in the campaign
for Socially Responsible Investment, I take
offense at Thomas Gale Moore's statement
that Stanford students have been "incited"
to speak out against global warming. Our
campaign and the recent ASSU resolution
passed on the issue do not call for hasty
action on the Kyoto Protocol but rather
show student support for the idea that the
investment of Stanford's endowment
should ethically coincide with what we are
taught in the classroom.
How can we be taught by our professors
that global warming is a serious problem
requiring thoughtful action and then fail to
voice support when the University's invest
ment strategy has the potential to effect
change on this very issue?
The policy supports positive steps
toward mitigating global warming, while
urging corporations to stop funding the
Global Climate Coalition's misinformation
campaign about their direct impact on cli
mate change.
Moore's argument that Stanford stu
dents ought to keep quiet about important
issues such as global warming because

"China alone will produce more green
house gases than Europe or the United
States" by 2020 begs us to answer the ques
tion of who has produced the most green
house gases for the last half-century?
The Kyoto Protocol has not been rati
fied by the United States because of the
GCC's $13 million campaign of misinfor
mation.
The resolution adopted by the ASSU
shows that students support the position
that global warming is a problem and Stan
ford must review its investment strategy to
make sure that our endowment is not being
used to exacerbate problems in the world
that we are being trained in the classroom
to combat.
I, along with the over 800 students who
signed the petition on global warming, urge
the Subcommittee on Investment Policy to
adopt the investment responsibility resolu
tion.
We must be active to ensure that the
Stanford's investment policies coincide with
the goals and ethical guidelines the Univer
sity is built upon.
