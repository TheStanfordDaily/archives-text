## ASSU promises 'more mud sports' 
### 
David Stein

I HAVE NEVER been one to shy away
from my civic responsibilities, so when
ASSU President Marcn Norton charged
us with evaluating the Senate candidates in
this week's election, I took the challenge seri
ously. Alter all. if I were to err in selecting
my representatives, then the ASSU's role as
a meaningful advocate of my voice, my needs
and my livelihood would be in grave danger.
I could not take that risk.
So I sat down with my ASSU Elections
Handbook, relying on the candidates' state
ments to guide me through this democratic
morass. With so many qualified competitors
deliberating such complex problems, it
quickly became clear that making sense of
this political contest would prove forbidding,
and yet, the investigation had to be carried
out. For there are important issues at stake
â€” issues that we, the Associated Students of
Stanford University, need to consider.

For example, the candidates this year are
not afraid to tackle the big problems. Sopho
more John Fu wants to "fight for a Post
Office Task Force to make picking up pack
ages a less traumatic experience" while
junior Stephen Han implores us, "Don't you
wish the parking metermaids would go
away?" My confidence in the power of stu
dent government swells when I know there
are undergraduate senators willing to take on
the psychologically terrifying U.S. Postal Ser
vice, as well as make parking in fire zones an
act free from criminal prosecution. No obsta
cle is too imposing for Fu and Han.
Or for freshman Ada Chen, who believes
that "educational policy, safety and the qual
ity of student life" need to be addressed.
Thank heaven visionaries like Chen exist
who do not complicate their politics with the
messy specifics of practical and tangible
agendas.

However, there are also those who will
not forget about the details of campus life.
Sophomore Shannon "the Cannon" Carney
points out that Stanford still yearns for
improvements "like fewer boring statistics
lectures. More mud sports. [And] Definitely
fewer bean-and-pesto dishes." Can one Sen
ator make a difference in all this madness?
"Believe or not," Carney contends, "the
ASSU can actually make a difference in
some of these things," although she regret
tably adds that it "can't improve your sex
life." No one can say that "the Cannon"
doesn't know her limits.
Aside from their stands on the issues, the
candidates' personal qualities need also be
scrutinized. For unabashed enthusiasm, we
shouldn't go any further than freshman
Rebecca Jovin, who relates this bit of per
sonal history: "I'm so obsessed with politics
that I'm a PoliSci major and was student

body president in high school for four years
... Bueno? Hell, yeah!!!" The English lan
guage cannot even contain Jovin's exuber
ance, as she must lapse into another tongue
to express her commitment to the student
body.
But for undying duty to student represen
tation, how can anyone surpass freshman
David Pan? "With over 10 years of student
government as background," Pan raises
"experience" to a different level. And yet,
the question remains: Is someone who began
his political career around the age of 8 too
entrenched in the system to respond to his
constituents' needs, or will his role as a career
politician allow him to bring the insights he
earned in elementary school to our pressing
concerns?
Luckily, the candidates did not rely on the
handbook for introducing themselves but
summed up their campaigns with the help of

descriptive fliers. Sophomore Aimer Khan
uses a picture of " The Waterboy" Adam
Sandler on his posters, while junior Kristy
Wilson, taking advantage of her last name's
similarity to the name of a famous sporting
goods company, employs the picture of a ten
nis ball. The cleverness of these advertise
ments is far beyond me, as I never could have
thought to suggest one's effectiveness as a
student leader with images of a yellow, fuzzy
ball and a mentally handicapped football
player.
Please take it upon yourselves, though, to
look at the handbook. But I must warn you
that despite its claim of providing a "face to
the names" on the fliers, the guide does not
include any pictures.

David Stein reminds any candidates wishing
to write angry letters that they were the ones
who wrote their handbook statements, not he.
