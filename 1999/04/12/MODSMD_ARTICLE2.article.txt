### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
Ben Stein, pop icon and host of Comedy Central's
"Win Ben Stein's Money," modestly entered a noisy,
packed Kresge Auditorium last Friday afternoon to
speak about "What's More Important than Money."
As Stein addressed the Stanford community, wear
ing a gray suit set off by a bright orange tie and Sim
ple-brand sneakers, he paraphrased his "former stu
dent" Ferris Bueller, saying "Life goes by pretty fast.
If you don't slow down, you might miss it."
Stein urged students to appreciate the slower mo
ments of life, explaining that "doing nothing is a won
derful thing." Students, Stein said, will not remember
their lectures.
"You'll remember lying in the sun, playing
bridge — does anyone play bridge anymore? — and
sitting around watching TV in your dorm room," he
said.
He described a balmy night at UC-Santa Cruz, lay-

the sky, as one of the happiest mo
ments of his life.
"A few nights ago. my son and I
were just watching TV. And he just
lay with his head across my very
large stomach and started asking
me what my life was like when 1
worked for Nixon." said Stein, who
served as a speech writer to Presi
dent Nixon at the age of 27. "And I
thought, this is much, much better
than anything I ever did when I was
accomplishing what could be seen
as big things."
Stein also focused on appreciat
ing the many things both he and
Stanford students have in life. He
cited the people of Kosovo as a sign
that luck, not any kind o! superiori
ty, accounts for differences in privi
lege.
"The really rich person is the

person who is in love with what he
has. The poor person is the person
who always wants more," Stein
said. "I wasted so much of my life
eaten up with envy. What an in
credible waste of human life."
After delivering his prepared
speech. Stein spent about 20 min
utes answering audience questions.
He described aspects ol his life in
cluding the first thing he does after
getting up in the morning and the
status ol his relationship with al
leged "archnemesis" and F.mmy
Award rival Alex Irebek. host of
television's "Jeopardy!".

a "jack of all trades and master of
them all," Stein graduated as vale
dictorian of Yale Law School, prac
ticed trial law and was a professor at
IJC -Santa C'ru/ and Pepperdine
University. In the \X()s he became
famous for his monotonous eco
nomics lecture in the IWb film
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off." That

scene. Stein said, was completely
ad-libbed.
Stein said he became an actor by
chance. When in Los Angeles
working as a screenwriter, a close
friend, who worked with John
I lughes, asked Stein if he wanted to
be in a few movies.
"The first one was one that
passed without much notice called
' The Wild Life' and the second one
was 'Ferris Bueller,' and that was
the godsend of my life!" he joked.
Audiences reacted to the speech
enthusiastically.
"I liked the message a lot."
freshman Pete Belknap said. "You
hear a lot about how everyone at
Stanford is going to make a lot of
money, hut you don't hear that
that's not the most important
thing."

close. Stein thanked the audience
