## Banana Slugs pose no problem Volleyball cruises over Santa Cruz 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
There's one thing the 15th
ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team can be sure of: the rest of its
matches are going to be a lot more
challenging than its last game
against the UC-Santa Cruz Ba
nana Slugs.

■ Friday: No. 15 Stanford (10-9)
def. UC-Santa Cruz. (4-15) 15-2,
15-6,15-4.

It would have been conceiv
able for Stanford (10-9) to over
look this game against the strug
gling Banana Slugs (4-15).
UC- Santa Cruz has not beaten
Stanford since 1981. The Slugs
have lost eight of their last nine
matches and are not members of
the elite club of Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation volleyball
schools.
More importantly, Friday's
game could not affect the Cardi
nal's conference record. With

three important MPSF matches
on this week's schedule. Stanford
has been focusing on these more
critical games to maintain its post
season ambitions.
But the Cardinal did not waste
any time defeating this sub-par
opponent.
"We have played a much
tougher schedule than Santa Cruz
this year." said sophomore out
side-hitter Curtis Graham. "We
were more prepared to play at a
higher level than they were."
In a game very similar to its
rout of UC-San Diego last week.
Stanford cruised to a 15-2, 15-6,
15-4 victory. This sub-par level of
competition differs significantly
from what the Cardinal can ex
pect from Pacific, UCLA and UC-
Irvine this week.
"Playing Santa Cruz was in
tended to be a tune-up for next
week, but they weren't as tough as
we were expecting." Graham said.
"I am not sure how productive
this match was in terms of prepa
ration for our next opponents."
