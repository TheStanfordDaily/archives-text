# Card sweeps away Arizona, ASU
## 
### Jake Widens Staff writer 
The No. 9 men's tennis team
(15-2, 8-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
showed it is just as tough to beat as
any team in the nation this week
end by dominating both Arizona
State and Arizona by scores of 6-1
and 6-0, respectively, at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium. It was a
very important weekend for the
Cardinal, as it now has momentum
heading into its toughest week of
the year with matches against Pep
perdine, USC and No. 1 UCLA.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday: No. 9 Stanford (15-2, Pa
cific lOConferenceB-1 )def. Arizona
(13-3,5-2), 6-1.

■ Friday: Stanford def. No. 14 Ari
zona State (13-3.5-2), 6-0.

The Friday afternoon match
against Arizona State (13-3, 5-2)
had potential to be a dangerous
one for the Cardinal as the Sun
Devils are close to the top 10 and
last month had the Cardinal down
3-2 in Tempe, Ariz., with two
matches to go. The Sun Devils also
handed the top-ranked Bruins
their only loss of the season and
have a particularly tough doubles
squad.
The Cardinal set the tone for the
weekend early on Friday by win
ning two of the three doubles
matches to take the doubles point.

It then used that momentum to
win five of its six singles matches,
even though several of them were
very close.
"I am very pleased with where
we are right now," said head coach
Dick Gould. "First off, it looks like
we have all our guys healthy going
into the final part of our season.
Secondly, all of our guys came
through and really raised their
level of play in both matches.
These were two tough matches and
we never even gave either team an
opening."
After being swept in doubles in
Tempe last month, the Cardinal re
bounded against the Sun Devils
and showed its doubles are on the
rise. Senior Ryan Wolters and
freshman K.J. Hippensteel played
well at the No. 2 spot and were first
off the court with their 9-7 win.
Then, sophomore Alex Kim and
junior Geoff Abrams came back
from a slow start to reach a
tiebreaker and give the Cardinal
the doubles point with a 9-8 victo
ry-
"lt was nice to put our doubles
together against [Arizona State],"
Wolters said. "They came in here
really fired up and expecting to
take us down to the wire like last
time, but we never let that oppor
tunity arise."
By far the biggest and most ex
citing match of the weekend was
sophomore Ali Ansari's duel with


Joanna Hiatt — Daily
Junior David Hauser leaps to deliver a backhand return in a Cardinal
victory over the weekend. The Cardinal was able to handle Arizona
and ASU at Taube Family Tennis Center.
Tim Hammond at the No. 6 singles
spot. Ansari lost the first set 6-3 and
was down 2-1 early in the seeond.
At this point in the match close
to 30 of his brothers from the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity migrated
over to cheer him on.
Hammond complained numer
ous times and even yelled out to the
crowd in disgust, but the umpire
was unable to do anything because
all cheering was done in legal man
ner.
Ansari, signaling and pumping
his fist toward the crowd on nearly
every big point, came back and
took the second set 6-4. Going into

the third set it appeared as if Ansari
had all the momentum and Ham
mond was discouraged. But Ham
mond was able to block out the
crowd and make a huge run to take
a 5-1 lead. Over the course of the
remainder of the set, Ansari faced
eight match points and simply re
fused to give up. He broke serve at
5-6 to send the match into a
tiebreaker and won 7-4 in the
breaker.
"I have never in my life played
behind a crowd as good as that," he
said. "I give almost all the credit of
my win to the guys from SAE who
stayed with me and never gave up.
I consider that one of the biggest
wins of my career due to the crowd
circumstances and what a win like
this will do to my confidence."

Over the course of Ansari's dra
matic victory the Cardinal closed
out the rest of its singles matches to
take the 6-1 win.
After the match, all of the play
ers were aware that they could not
afford to let their win get in the way
of Saturday's task.
On Saturday against Arizona
(7-10,2-7), all singles matches were
played first due to the rain. But the
Cardinal rendered the possibility
of doubles play moot by sweeping
through every position to win 6-0.
"The weekend was great."
Wolterssaid. "Now the kcv is for us
to use that confidence and momen
tum to stay sharp and intense this
week. This is our final week of
duel-match play and we need to
end strongly."
