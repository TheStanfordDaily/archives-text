### Jake Widens Staff writer 
The No. 9 men's tennis team
(15-2, 8-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
showed it is just as tough to beat as
any team in the nation this week
end by dominating both Arizona
State and Arizona by scores of 6-1
and 6-0, respectively, at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium. It was a
very important weekend for the
Cardinal, as it now has momentum
heading into its toughest week of
the year with matches against Pep
perdine, USC and No. 1 UCLA.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday: No. 9 Stanford (15-2, Pa
cific lOConferenceB-1 )def. Arizona
(13-3,5-2), 6-1.

■ Friday: Stanford def. No. 14 Ari
zona State (13-3.5-2), 6-0.

The Friday afternoon match
against Arizona State (13-3, 5-2)
had potential to be a dangerous
one for the Cardinal as the Sun
Devils are close to the top 10 and
last month had the Cardinal down
3-2 in Tempe, Ariz., with two
matches to go. The Sun Devils also
handed the top-ranked Bruins
their only loss of the season and
have a particularly tough doubles
squad.
The Cardinal set the tone for the
weekend early on Friday by win
ning two of the three doubles
matches to take the doubles point.

It then used that momentum to
win five of its six singles matches,
even though several of them were
very close.
"I am very pleased with where
we are right now," said head coach
Dick Gould. "First off, it looks like
we have all our guys healthy going
into the final part of our season.
Secondly, all of our guys came
through and really raised their
level of play in both matches.
These were two tough matches and
we never even gave either team an
opening."
After being swept in doubles in
Tempe last month, the Cardinal re
bounded against the Sun Devils
and showed its doubles are on the
rise. Senior Ryan Wolters and
freshman K.J. Hippensteel played
well at the No. 2 spot and were first
off the court with their 9-7 win.
Then, sophomore Alex Kim and
junior Geoff Abrams came back
from a slow start to reach a
tiebreaker and give the Cardinal
the doubles point with a 9-8 victo
ry-
"lt was nice to put our doubles
together against [Arizona State],"
Wolters said. "They came in here
really fired up and expecting to
take us down to the wire like last
time, but we never let that oppor
tunity arise."
By far the biggest and most ex
citing match of the weekend was
sophomore Ali Ansari's duel with


Joanna Hiatt — Daily
Junior David Hauser leaps to deliver a backhand return in a Cardinal
victory over the weekend. The Cardinal was able to handle Arizona
and ASU at Taube Family Tennis Center.
