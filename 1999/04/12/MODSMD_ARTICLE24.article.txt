### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
Freshman Marissa Irvin, the na
tion's second-ranked player, lost
for the second time in four matches
on Saturday, but the fifth-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team (20-
2, 6-0 Pacific 10 Conference) was
still able to manage a narrow 5-4
victorv over No. 11 Arizona State
(11-7.3-4).

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday: No. 5 Stanford (20-2,6-
0 Pacific Ten Conference) def. No.
11 Arizona State (11-7,3-4), 5-4.

■ Friday: Stanford def. Arizona (7-
12,3-9), 6-0.

"It was nerve-wracking," said
junior captain and All-American
Teryn Ashley. "It was really tight.
A lot of matches went to three
sets."
Ashley, ranked fifth in the na
tion, was one of only two Stanford
players to win her match in straight
sets. Ashley upended Sun Devil
Katy Propstra 7-5,6-2.

"l was down 5-3 in the first set,"
she said, "but I looked around and
saw that everyone else was in trou
ble, so I tried to put together a few
good points, and it worked."
At the No. 3 singles spot, fresh
man Gabby Lastra emerged victo
rious after her opponent. Sun Devil
Karin Palme, retired with an injury
after Lastra jumped out to a 7-6, 2-
0 lead.
Every other singles match
proved to be a dramatic contest.
Irvin faced ASU's Allison Brad
shaw. the only other freshman in
the country ranked in the top 30.
Irvin and Bradshaw had faced each
other many times in national junior
competition, but Bradshaw had
never managed to defeat the Cardi
nal star.
This time, the match had a dif
ferent ending.
Bradshaw came out firing, and
her solid play, along with a few
close line calls, aggravated Irvin.
The match, however, couldn't have
been closer. Bradshaw edged Irvin,
7-6 (4), 7-5.
"Allison can play some great
tennis," freshman Lauren Kalvaria

said. "She hits the ball really hard
and she came out there and didn't
miss."
The other singles matches all
went the distance. At the No. 4
spot. Kalvaria struggled past Faye
DeVera 6-7.6-2, 6-2.
Junior Jennifer Heiser earned a
4-6, 6-1, 6-3 triumph over Alison
Nash at the No. 5 spot.
Freshman Keiko Tokuda suc
cumbed to Sun Devil Celena Mc-
Coury at the No. 6 singles position
6-3, 2-6, 6-2 leaving the Cardinal
with an unreliable 4-2 lead after
singles plav.
The Sun Devils were persistent
and soon made the situation even
more precarious. The Cardinal's
perfect Pac-10 record was put in
jeopardy.
The No. 1 doubles match was an
exciting one. Bradshaw and Prop
stra teamed up to conquer the na
tion's second-ranked duo of Ash
ley and Irvin 9-7.
In the meantime. Tokuda and
Heiser fell to Sun Devils DeVera
and Palme 8-1.
After ASU took the No. 1 and
No. 3 doubles matches, the pres

sure fell on the Cardinal's No. 2
tandem of Lastra and Kalvaria.
The freshmen squad showed ex
cellent form and maturity in secur
ing the victory for Stanford, over
powering ASU's Nash / McCoury,
8-4.
"We can't always rely on Maris
sa to win." Kalvaria said. "It came
down to our doubles, and it felt
great to be able to win in that situa
tion."
Ashley agreed.
"Lauren and Gabby came
through big for us in the end," she
said. "They'll remember this and
use it in the future."
On Friday, the Cardinal
trounced Arizona 6-0 in an easy
victory.
Ashley said the easy victory
against the Wildcats may have
made the women careless in their
approach to Saturday's match with
Arizona State.
"It was really windy and elevat
ed so the balls flew at Arizona," she
said. "Maybe we then got relaxed
against Arizona State because the
conditions were so much better
there."
