## Huge wins over Cal, CU-Boulder, Colorado College spark weekend wins 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
Despite the rainy weather at
UC-Davis' Western States'
lacrosse tournament this weekend
and playing fields with grass that
was too slick and too long, the Stan
ford women's lacrosse team was
able to put together some of their
best playing all season and came
away with the Division I Western
States' title.
On their path to the champi
onships, the women took down
Randolf-Macon 11-2, followed by
Colorado 9-4 and finally the most
rewarding of all victories, Califor
nia 16-3; and that was just Saturday.
"We played phenomanally on
Saturday," said junior Hedy Born.
"It was a long day, but we stayed
mentally focused and prevailed.
We showed that we were the better
team."

The team's play on Saturday ad
vanced them to the semifinal game
against UC-Davis which Stanford
won 5-3. Finally, the Cardinal bat
tled Colorado College for the
championship and won 10-4.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE

â–  Sunday: Stanford won the UC-
Davis Western States' Tournament
in Division I.

" Last year we didn't do so well,"
Born said, "so it is exciting to come
out and win it all this year."
Although the team was thrilled
to come home as champions, ar
guably the biggest victory of the
weekend was their huge win over
Cal.
"The win against Cal felt the
best." said head coach Heidi Con
nor. "'As my assistant coach said -
we played like a top-2() ranked
team that game. It was spectacular!

In particular, freshman Caroline
Osterwise and sophomore Kate
Reilly were on the money."
Connor is referring to Osterwise
firing a perfect shooting percentage
and Riley shooting 75 percent in
the tournament.
"We finally showed Cal what
we're capable of," Osterwise said.
"We really stepped up our level of
play rather than letting them play
with us the whole time."
The victory over Cal was partic
ularly rewarding because the
women were still seeking revenge
from a 10-9 loss earlier in the sea
son. Although the Cardinal was
able to redeem itself last weekend
with an 11-10 win in double-sud
den-death overtime, the women
were not satisfied.
"The win over Cal was really ex
citing because we have had a men
tal block against them." said Born.
"We proved we could overcome

it."
The adrenaline from the Cal
game could only have helped the
Cardinal fight the dreary weather
and work its way to the top.
"The most exciting part about
the weekend was seeing that the
team continues to improve. You
get to a point in the season where
you are supposed to peak, then you
wonder how long you can hold onto
that," Connor said. "Well, we con
tinue to improve."
Another big accomplishment of
the weekend for the team seems to
be getting over their post spring
break slump.
During the slump in which the
women did not believe they were
playing as well as they did on the
East Coast.
"There was a big difference in
how we played this weekend," Os
terwise said. "We played with a lot
more confidence, things were

working well for us. Our transition
game and fast break on offense re
ally came together for us for the
first time this season."
Osterwise led the team with 12
goals and sophomore Katharine
Barnes had 10 goals.
Born had 9 goals, senior co-cap
tain Carey Jones and Reillv had 4
goals each and senior co-captain
Alexis Patrizio, freshmen Liz Britt
and Sara Lev each posted 2 goals.
Senior Stephanie Tuerk had an
exceptional weekend in net with a
64 percent save ratio, while junior
Christina Gilyutin. freshmen Jenny
Silverman and Emily Rodriguez
led the team on defense.
"On the whole it was a team ef
fort," said Connor
The team picked a great week
end to play to their potential. The
tournament was not only physically
draining, but somewhat of a mental
challenge as well.

"It was hard to play Davis in a
tournament game knowing full well
that we are travelling back up there
to play them in a league game that
will determine whether we go into
playoffs as the number one seed or
not," Connor said. "These games
against Cal and Davis are always so
emotionally grounded. It is tough
to go out there and play without
thinking about all the history be
tween these three teams and the ri
valries."
After these confidence-buliding
wins, the next challenge on the
road ahead for the Cardinal women
will be their important league game
with Davis.
"We need to beat them decisive
ly to show we're the No. 1 team in
our league," said Tuerk. "We
would like to win the [Women's
Western Lacrosse League] final
four decisively and show that we're
the team in the West to beat."
