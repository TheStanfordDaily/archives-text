After Friday night's series open
er against No. 25 Washington, sec
ond-ranked Stanford no longer had
to worry about protecting its perfect
Pacific 10 Conference record.
Following its 3-2 loss to All-
American pitcher Jeff Heaverlo and
the Huskies, the Cardinal's worry
shifted to simply winning a game
and making it out of Seattle with its
Pac-10 lead still intact.
However, after scrapping togeth
er stunning, come-from-behind vic
tories both Saturday and Sunday af
ternoon. Stanford (25-9, 11-1 Pac
-10) won the series and kept its slim
lead over USC, who comes to
Sunken Diamond lor a crucial three

"I'm really proud of the way we
played," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "It was a big series
for us and a big series for them and
coming away with two wins was
huge. We'll take them any way we
can get them."
The Cardinal was outplayed dur
um much of the final two games. But.

bolstered by Washington's pitching
and fielding mistakes, Stanford was
able to come back and take both
contests.
Sunday's 13-10 victory was espe
cially important.
Stanford cruised through the first
three innings, stringing singles to
gether and riding the solid pitching
of freshman Brian Sager (3-0, 3.60
ERA) u> an early 3-olead.
However, by the fourth inning.
Sager proved ineffective. He gave
up a walk and three straight singles
to tie the game at three.
Relievers Mike Wodnicki and
J.D. Willcox. both freshmen, could
not stop the Huskies, either. Wod
nicki (2-0.4.39 ERA) faced five bat
ters, giving up two walks and two
singles, splitting the Huskies a 5-3

lead. Willcox (1-0, 3.95 ERA),
though otherwise effective, gave up
a costly three-run home run. giving
the Huskies an 8-3 lead going into
the eighth inning.
Then, in the top of the eighth
after being quieted for much of the
game, the Cardinal offense finally
began to show how dangerous it
could be if it was given any help.
Aided by three hit batters and
two walks, Stanford broke out for 10
runs in the last two innings. Junior
second baseman Jeff Rizzo (.341. 4
HR, 36 RBIs) drove in six of those
runs, seven in the game and nine in
the series.
His ninth-inning grand slam was
the Cardinal's first since senior third
