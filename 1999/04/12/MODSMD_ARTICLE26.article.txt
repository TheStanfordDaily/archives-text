### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
After Friday night's series open
er against No. 25 Washington, sec
ond-ranked Stanford no longer had
to worry about protecting its perfect
Pacific 10 Conference record.
Following its 3-2 loss to All-
American pitcher Jeff Heaverlo and
the Huskies, the Cardinal's worry
shifted to simply winning a game
and making it out of Seattle with its
Pac-10 lead still intact.
However, after scrapping togeth
er stunning, come-from-behind vic
tories both Saturday and Sunday af
ternoon. Stanford (25-9, 11-1 Pac
-10) won the series and kept its slim
lead over USC, who comes to
Sunken Diamond lor a crucial three

game set this weekend

"I'm really proud of the way we
played," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "It was a big series
for us and a big series for them and
coming away with two wins was
huge. We'll take them any way we
can get them."
The Cardinal was outplayed dur
um much of the final two games. But.

bolstered by Washington's pitching
and fielding mistakes, Stanford was
able to come back and take both
contests.
Sunday's 13-10 victory was espe
cially important.
Stanford cruised through the first
three innings, stringing singles to
gether and riding the solid pitching
of freshman Brian Sager (3-0, 3.60
ERA) u> an early 3-olead.
However, by the fourth inning.
Sager proved ineffective. He gave
up a walk and three straight singles
to tie the game at three.
Relievers Mike Wodnicki and
J.D. Willcox. both freshmen, could
not stop the Huskies, either. Wod
nicki (2-0.4.39 ERA) faced five bat
ters, giving up two walks and two
singles, splitting the Huskies a 5-3

lead. Willcox (1-0, 3.95 ERA),
though otherwise effective, gave up
a costly three-run home run. giving
the Huskies an 8-3 lead going into
the eighth inning.
Then, in the top of the eighth
after being quieted for much of the
game, the Cardinal offense finally
began to show how dangerous it
could be if it was given any help.
Aided by three hit batters and
two walks, Stanford broke out for 10
runs in the last two innings. Junior
second baseman Jeff Rizzo (.341. 4
HR, 36 RBIs) drove in six of those
runs, seven in the game and nine in
the series.
His ninth-inning grand slam was
the Cardinal's first since senior third
baseman Josh 1 lochgesang's in the
1997 College World Series and his
seven KB Is were the most in a single
game for any Cardinal in the 1990'5.
The personnel moves Marquess
made at the end of the game indicat
ed how important he felt it was for
Stanford to win the final game of the
series.
Desperate to get speed on the
basepaths, Marquess even used
Jason Young, the staff ace, as a
pinch-runner and outfielder in the
ninth inning. Young replaced junior
catcher Damien Alvarado at second
base and came around to score the
go-ahead run four batters later.
The victory moved Stanford
three games ahead of Washington
and Arizona State in the conference

standings and at least ;i game in front
of second-place USC. The Trojans'
game against Cal was rained out
Sunday and rescheduled for this af
ternoon. If they lose to ( al. they will
drop two behind.
Saturday's 7-4. 11-inning Stan
ford win was no less dramatic.
In the top of the seventh inning,
junior first baseman John Gall's
bloop double to center field caught
three Washington fielders off guard,
allowing two runners to come
around and tie the score at four.
With senior Tony Cogan holding
the Huskies at bay. allowing only
one hit in three innings of work, the
game moved to extra innings when
the Cardinal made its move.
Pinch-hitter Stephen Chan, who
had only one hit in 13 previous at
bats, singled and moved to second
on a sacrifice bunt from Eric
Hruntlett. Then, sophomore center

fielder Hilly Jacobson doubled down
the left-field line to score the win
ning run.
Rizzo's following two-run homer
added extra insurance but Jacobson
had already done the damage.
Friday's matchup was a classic
pitcher's duel. Heaverloand Young,
two of the most dominating pitchers
in college baseball, put up similarly
impressive lines.
Young (6-2. 2.65 ERA) gave up
only six hits and two earned runs, in
an eight-inning complete-game ef
fort. Though he struck out 12.
Young was undone by a sloppy third
inning featuring an error by junior
first baseman John Gall and
Young's own wild pitch, both of
which allowed runs to score.
Heaverlo (6-1,2.85 ERA) was no
less impressive, picking up the win
after pitching seven innings of six-hit
ball.
