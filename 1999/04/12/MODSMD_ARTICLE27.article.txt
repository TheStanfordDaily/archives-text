World-renowned anthropologist
Clifford Geertz drew a nearly capaci
ty crowd at Kresge Auditorium Fri
day as part of a two-day conference
celebrating the s()th anniversaries of
anthropology at Stanford and of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
Geertz discussed the role of inten
sive. highly focused study in today's
rapidly changing mass society. In
donesia. one of his areas of research,
is such a wildly diverse country that
in-depth ethnography is necessary in
order to properly understand its frag
mented culture.
"Change itself constructs its sub
ject," he said. "A country is what hap
pens to it."
Geertz began by discussing an
thropology in the context of the new
Cultural and Social Anthropology
Department. He said he felt that the
recent devotion of a separate depart
ment of anthropology to cultural
studies is a necessary step in the con
tinually changing world of the social

sciences.
He then turned to Indonesia and
discussed the condition of politics, re
ligion and race in that country. The
vast upheavals and changes there, he
said, made work challenging lor an
thropologists, such as himself, who
have been studying the local culture
for decades.
"One wants to say both 'Forget
everything I said before' and. like
Churchill, i was not always wrong,' "
Geertz said.
A San Francisco native. Geertz is
quite possibly the most accomplished
anthropologist of this century.
A staunch proponent of ethnogra
phy, the intense and in-depth study of
a single culture, he has used the tech
niques of interpretive anthropology
to conduct extensive research in
North Africa and Southeast Asia. He
holds 13 honorary degrees and has
written 17 books that have been
translated into 15 different lan
guages.
He was introduced by Assoc. Cul
tural and Social Anthropology Prof.
Carol Delanev.

"Clifford Geertz," she said, "was
my inspiration to become an anthro
pologist." In 1975 a friend offered her
a copy of one of Geertz's papers on
religion, and she was so impressed
that she decided to follow in his foot
steps.
Geertz was asked to speak in
order to show the importance of an
thropology in current events, De
laney said. In addition to his address,
the conference included three panel
discussions over the weekend about
various current anthropological is
sues.
The Friday audience included a
number of students. Junior Joelle
Lozach. an anthropology major, and
sophomore Anita Lillie, a biology
major, sat in the front row. Both are
or soon will be reading Geertz's work
in their classes and said they felt that
the lecture was an opportunity not to
be missed.
Besides, explained Lozach, who
will be reading Geertz in an anthro
pological theory course, "he's the
only person we're studying that's not
dead."
