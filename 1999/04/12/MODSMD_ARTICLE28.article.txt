Stanford's annual celebration of women and their
role in the campus community, Herstory '99, will hold
its opening ceremonies tonight, kicking off a three

achievements as well as the efforts of men and women

portunity," said sophomore Nam Hee Kim, who
helped organize Herstory this year.

celebrate and organize events, including the Women's
Center, the Women's Coalition, Stanford Women in
Engineering and the ASSIJ.

er different organizations on campus," Kim said.
"We reach out to every group on campus we can
think of and ask them to put on an event." junior Kelly
Vaughan added.
Vaughan said the main focus of Herstory was not
only celebration but gaining attention for women's
achievements.
"The group wants to increase visibility and bring at
tention to what women on this campus and in the com
munity are doing," she said, "I think this is a great
chance to see what women have been doing. Also, you
meet a lot of people who are really active in the com
munity themselves."
One of the focal events will be the keynote address
by Rebecca Walker, contributing editor to News Mag
azine and author of "To Be Real: Telling the Truth and
Changing the Face of Feminism."

an said. "We work with the [ASSU] Speakers Bureau
and try to figure out what will work with our budgets,
and we look for whoever seems really exciting. Walk
er turned out to he the hest choice."
Those involved with orchestrating the celebration
said they expect a great deal of campus involvement.
According to Kim. about 1.000 people from the Uni
versity and the Bay Area usually participate in the
events.
"From events I've been to in the past, turnout was
very good," Vaughan added. "We really hope every
one will come. For me. when I was a freshman, Her
story was this wonderful two-week celebration, and I
want to pass that on to other students."
