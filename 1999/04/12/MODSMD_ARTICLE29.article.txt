It's my favorite time of year, time to pick

my new best friends! Time for me to have

the right to tell freshman girls if they're

:00l enough to hang out with me! In

order to assure the right group of sis-

ters / admirers / slaves, I have prepared

for many moons.

NOVEMBER: Study Freshman Face

Book, looking for hot girls to fill out our

next year's stellar pledge class. Uh-oh, all the

girls are not that cute in their pictures! But that's

actually good, if I hang out with ugly girls then I'll

look hot! Decide the fat skanky girl with the hottie athelete
brother is the new ideal pledge.

JANUARY: Survey the fraternities, make sure we get the resident hoochies of the good hous
es. Have the best house's No. 1 pledge (he's so hot!) star the girls he wants in our Face Book. If
we get them to join, he'll come to our parties!
MARCH: Skit practice time! Uh oh, 1 heard Kappa has a really good disco number! We're
doomed! I'll start practicing my break dancing moves three times a day. My best friend Cindy
and I shop for hours for each day's outfit and buy lots of body glitter.
RUSH!!!!
DAY 1: I find my rush crush — her name's Laura! She's so cute! Her cheekbones are awesome!
She told me that all the freshmen in her dormitory sweat after me! She's going to get her hair
cut just like mine!
DAY 2: Cindy and I both want to preference Laura. We get in a big fight. She tells me I was a
snap bid. I tell her she was a legacy. She says she doesn't have an older sister. I say, "that's what
you think, big-booty whore!"
DAY 3: : Laura gets dropped from our house! Our president says we can't just pick girls for
how attractive they are — then we'd be superficial! So we pick girls according to if wc like their
major. Laura's CS — she's out. But her shoes were so cute! I can't believe Laura got dropped! I
hate my sisters. They're not my real friends. I'm so through with them. I'll go hang out with
all my friends from the freshman dormitory whom I stopped talking to after I found out hat I
was cooler than them during last year's Rush.
PREFERENCE: Cindy lights a candle and says an inspirational poem. She really is my best
friend! Plus she's going to set me up with her hot boyfriend's roommate for his next formal!
The girl I pref keeps asking me about community service. She's so out. I still tell her we all love
her, |fid she should for sure put our sorority as her first choice. Then when she doesn't get a bid
she'll cry and tell boys that we were her first choice but we negged her. Then we'll be exclusive,
as well as hot.
BID NIGHT: Hot boys, puffy paint, lite beer! Rush was so worth it. Our pledges are soooo
cute, I love them all, except for the fat girl who hooked up with my ex-boyfriend, I hate her.
She's for sure not my little sis.
