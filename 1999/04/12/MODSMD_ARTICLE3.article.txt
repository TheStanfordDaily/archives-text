## Election 'oversight' may be unconstitutional 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
The lack of advance publicity by the ASSU of the pos
sible new constitutional amendment, "An ASSU For All
Students," may be in violation of Article VII of the
ASSU Constitution. In addition, as the full text of the
amendment is not published in the printed ASSU Elec
tions Handbook, the absence of explicit directions in the
printed version to find the amendment's full text on the
Web violates the ASSU's bylaws.
Amendment supporters contend that the online
handbook containing the amendment and a personal
Web site with a copy satisfy the constitution's require
ment that the amendment be made available at least
seven days before the election, despite the inconsisten
cies between the two versions of the handbook and no

publicity until today that the of
ficial site contained the amend
ment text.
The amendment, which
would create a separate Gradu
ate Student Council and under
graduate ASSU Senate, is pre
sented in its entirety—4l pages
— on the the online version of
the Elections Handbook, which
was made available to students
on April 7, exactly a week in ad
vance of the election.
An advertisement publiciz
ing the election and its dates, as
well as the election handbook's
Web address was published in

The Daily on that same day. However, the advertisement
did not explicitly include "the title of the proposed
amendment... and a statement explaining how to obtain
a copy of the text of the amendment," as the constitution
dictates in the absence of the full text of the amendment
in the printed handbook.
The last line of a Feb. 9 article in The Daily did include
the personal Web address of one of the amendment's au
thors containing the text of the proposed amendment.
However, the article predated the amendment's ap
proval by the Senate on Feb. 23. and thus cannot be con
sidered publicity of the official text of the amendment.
David Robinson, a graduate student senator and an
author of the amendment, noted that "There were no
changes to the text of the amendment," between the ini
tial Feb. 9 news coverage and the election Apr. 14-15.
In any case, according to the bylaws, the ASSU Elec
tions Commission is charged with "proper notification"
of the electorate.
"I've heard some talk about [the amendment] but not
that much." sophomore Sasha Benjamin said. "The
ASSIJ hasn't publicized it enough."
The printed version of the Elections Handbook was
distributed to students on April 9.
This version includes a statement in favor of the
amendment, titled "Constitutional Amendment," but
did not include the title of the
amendment, the name of the state
ment's sponsor or the Web address
at which the lull text of the amend
ment can be accessed, as the consti
tution requires.
This was due to a layout error, ac
cording to Elections Commissioner
Jason Kang, i» junior.
The absence of these elements
also contradicts the bylaws, which
specify that statements must be pro
vided for "each ballot measure," and
that "statements shall consist 0f...
the title of the ballot measure, the
text of the ballot measure, the name
of the sponsors in favor and opposed
(if any) to the ballot measure."
The online handbook contains
only the lull text of the amendment,
omitting the other required ele
ments.
"Mistakes do happen and we do
try to fix all mistakes," Kang said.
" This is not ideal, and we are submit
ting all errors for the insert. In the
same way that there are lavout errors

with the amendment, there is an
error in the junior presidency biogra
phies and with some other items."
According to Kang, an insert flier,
which will correct all errors in the
Elections Handbook, is being dis
tributed to students today. It will in
clude the amendment's Web page
address as well as identify Robinson
as the statement's author and spon
sor.
Past printed versions of elections
handbooks from 19% and 1997 have
included the full text of amend
ments. Kang said that the 41-page
length of this year's amendment
made its publication in the printed
handbook "impractical."
Senior David Searle, a senator
who voted against the amendment,
expressed concern over the amend
ment's presentation in the printed
handbook.
"The statement in the handbook
gives undergraduates a reason to
vote for the amendment, even
though it's not going to help under
graduates ... Searle said, "since
the amendment would be responsi
ble for their ASSU fees going up,
which the handbook does not allude

to."
"Neither of the handbooks say
anything of the amendment's poten
tial drawbacks," Searle said.
Kang insisted that no one ever
gave him an opposing statement.
Searle, however, said that "defi
nitely no one in the ASSU made a
concerted effort to find someone to
write an opposing statement," as the
bylaws require. "When you go to a
state election, an objective statement
of a voting issue is always present
ed."
Searle said the amendment's
"shortcomings" should have been
more publicized, since their impact
could be significant.
ASSU members are attempting
to rectify the error in the printed ver
sion by publicizing the amendment
more extensively. A debate concern
ing the merits and drawbacks of the
amendment will be held in Branner
Hall tonight at 7 p.m. Fliers and in
serts being distributed to students
today present the amendment's
sponsor and its Web address.
"I accept lull responsibility for the
layout errors in the handbook, and
I'm doing everything I can to rectify
that," Kangsaid.
A summary of the amendment is
on the ballot, and there is a link on
the ballot to the full text of the
amendment.

"It was an oversight." said senior
Maren Norton. ASSU president.
"We're trying to do everything in our
power to remedy the situation by
getting the word out and encourag
ing every student to read the amend
ment. I think it would have been nice
to have had an unbiased statement in
the handbook, but its a very compli
cated issue."
I he questionable constitulionali

ty of the amendment election's pub
licity could be brought to the Consti
tutional Council's attention bv any
student.
However, according to senior
Robert Windom, a council member,
i! the amendment passes, it could be
overturned after the election should
the lack of publicity of the amend
ment be deemed unconstitutional.
