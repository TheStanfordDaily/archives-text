## Election 'oversight' may be unconstitutional 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
The lack of advance publicity by the ASSU of the pos
sible new constitutional amendment, "An ASSU For All
Students," may be in violation of Article VII of the
ASSU Constitution. In addition, as the full text of the
amendment is not published in the printed ASSU Elec
tions Handbook, the absence of explicit directions in the
printed version to find the amendment's full text on the
Web violates the ASSU's bylaws.
Amendment supporters contend that the online
handbook containing the amendment and a personal
Web site with a copy satisfy the constitution's require
ment that the amendment be made available at least
seven days before the election, despite the inconsisten
cies between the two versions of the handbook and no

publicity until today that the of
ficial site contained the amend
ment text.
The amendment, which
would create a separate Gradu
ate Student Council and under
graduate ASSU Senate, is pre
sented in its entirety—4l pages
— on the the online version of
the Elections Handbook, which
was made available to students
on April 7, exactly a week in ad
vance of the election.
An advertisement publiciz
ing the election and its dates, as
well as the election handbook's
Web address was published in

did not explicitly include "the title of the proposed
amendment... and a statement explaining how to obtain
a copy of the text of the amendment," as the constitution
dictates in the absence of the full text of the amendment
in the printed handbook.
The last line of a Feb. 9 article in The Daily did include
the personal Web address of one of the amendment's au
thors containing the text of the proposed amendment.
However, the article predated the amendment's ap
proval by the Senate on Feb. 23. and thus cannot be con
sidered publicity of the official text of the amendment.
David Robinson, a graduate student senator and an
author of the amendment, noted that "There were no
changes to the text of the amendment," between the ini
tial Feb. 9 news coverage and the election Apr. 14-15.
In any case, according to the bylaws, the ASSU Elec
tions Commission is charged with "proper notification"
of the electorate.
"I've heard some talk about [the amendment] but not
that much." sophomore Sasha Benjamin said. "The
ASSIJ hasn't publicized it enough."
The printed version of the Elections Handbook was
distributed to students on April 9.
This version includes a statement in favor of the
amendment, titled "Constitutional Amendment," but
