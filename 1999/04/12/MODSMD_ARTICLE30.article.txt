# YOUR OFFICIAL FRAT RUSH GUIDE
## 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
We know that a lot of you guys have
concerns about the Rush process that is
currently going on. You're probably feeling
a little uncertain because of some rumors
that have been floating around. So we
decided to clear things up. Here it goes:
WHAT IS RUSH?
The American Heritage Dictionary
offers this definition: "the intensely plea
surable sensation experienced immediate
ly after use of a narcotic." Not too far off.
WHY JOIN A FRATERNITY?
Why not? For every babe there's a buck
et of bile, and you'll know the ins and outs
of each by Winter Quarter next year.
THEY SAID THAT THIS YEAR RUSH
WAS GOING TO BE DRY.
Shut up, kid.

WILL BEING
A FRAT
MEMBER
AFFECT MY
GRADES?
No! Of
course not.
You're only
going to be in
a tiny room
with four
other guys
spewing on
each other,
another hav
ing sex on
your bed, a
party down
stairs with the
stereo blast-

ing, and just when you

thought you were going to sleep, it's time
to jump in the freezing cold Claw naked at
five in morning. Come on, there's plenty of
time to crack open the books. Plus, grades
don't really matter anyway. Do they?

WHAT IF I DON'T DRINK?
Don't worry about it buddy. We have
alternative ways of making you throw up.
Go on, lick that toilet seat. That a boy.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN HOUSED AND UNHOUSED
FRATERNITIES?
In an unhoused fraternity you get to pay
a lot of money to hang out with friends.
For $300 a quarter you'll look like you have
a life. We'll even throw in pictures of you
with the boys to show your high school
buddies back home.
I AM A VEGETARIAN AND LACTOSE
INTOLERANT CAN YOU ACCOMMO
DATE M Y DIETARY NEEDS?
Yeah, sure. Whatever, kid.
DOES SIZE MATTER?
Yes, and you will be measured. The
results will be posted by name and picture
in all of the sororities.

WHAT'S A CIRCLE JERK?
A frat delicacy. A type of cookie, if you
will. Just ask a Sigma Chi.

HOW ABOUT THE ELEPHANT WALK?
Well, a Sigma Chi would probably be the
best expert here as well. We only offer this
advice: hold on tight but don't squeeze too
hard. OK?

WHAT'S THIS I
HEAR ABOUT
GOATS IN A BASE
MENT?
It's true. And
you'll be getting to
know them quite well.
You should know their
names too before bids
are handed out. Watch
out, they bite. And, oh,
by the way, that's not
milk!
WHAT'S A GOLDEN
SHOWER?
It's almost like a
warm ceremonial bap
tism but the water is

yellow. The pipes haven't been
changed in a while.

Have a great Rush, kiddos!


Alright boys, there she is. Which one of you Is first?
