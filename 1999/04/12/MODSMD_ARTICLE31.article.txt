# Fraternities to use new ploys to entice their prospectives
## 
### Bob Gates 
Stanford fraternities have witnessed a dramatic decline in new frat boys
in the past few years, so this year's Rush coordinators are coming up with
new and exciting strategies to entice prospective suckers who, the coordi
nators hope, will join a group of guys who "look just like them so that
they can walk around together in a big group and feel like they really don't
have small... uh . .. self-esteems."
These new strategies, to be implemented during Rush Week, will
include different nightly events than those that have been seen in past
years. Due to stringent, over-zealous police who actually keep their ears
warm by inserting their heads fully into their rectal cavities — even dur
ing summertime! — alcohol will not have the übiquitous presence that it
has enjoyed during past Rush events. Gone will be the traditional drink
puke-drink games of years past. Instead, new fraternity activities will
have a focus on arts and crafts. For example, prosectives will learn how
to iron on that extra horizontal chest stripe on their gray, long-sleeved T

shirts. Contests will include "How Many Pockets Can You Sew Onto Your
Cargo Pants?"
Viking dinners are also out the door this year. Cleaning services have
successfully lobbied the administration to ban these events in which fra
ternity prospects must eat without bending their elbows. Rush coordina
tors are particular ly sad to see this event go because, historically speaking,
it was only in the late 1980s, after countless starvation deaths in the pre
vious two centuries, that frat boys discovered the "feed the boy sitting
next to you" method which actually allowed all boys at a table to receive
some sustenance. Although many lives were saved and countless friend
ships forged, this method did create a great deal of mess on the floor, and
the cleaning services declared themselves "damn tired of it."
To replace the Viking Dinner, coordinators have designed a new activi
ty to further frat boy interaction in a cooperative manner. This year the
boys will form a huge circle, link hands and chant "A-ber-crom-bie A-ber
crom-bie."
Many frats will also be having movie nights. One fraternity which only

recently lost its house is very excited to be serving non-alcoholic koumiss,
a Mongolian version of fermented mare's milk. Another, stupider frat
looks forward to watching Chaplin movies in surround sound while
drinking non-alcoholic stallion's "milk."
But thankfully one thing will remain the same this year. This Daily
reporter dressed himself in black leather and chains and went undercov
er at a fraternity commonly called the "Pretty Boy Frat" to obtain the
truth. While sitting in a restroom stall pretending to do number 2,1 over
heard two frat boys together in the stall next to me. I also overheard two
frat boys in the same shower stall.
But I obtained the truth on my way out, my rear still tender from the
repeated pinching, when I heard a frat boy on the phone, urging a
prospective to come to his party, "It's going to be a lot of fun! We're going
to have Jolt on tap. I also just spoke with some chicks, and there are def
initely going to be some sluts there! And if you like Yahtzee, you'll get
some play, too."
Ahh, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
