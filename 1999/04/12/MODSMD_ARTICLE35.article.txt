Going into the final rotation at
the NCAA Regional Champi
onships Saturday, the eighth
ranked Stanford women's gymnas
tics team (9-4), must have felt a
sense of deja vu.
Last year at Regionals in Wash
ington. Stanford was one rotation
away from earning a hid to the na
tional tournament, but a disastrous
performance on the balance beam
landed it in third place, one spot
out of contention for a national bid.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Saturday: No. 7 Stanford placed
first with 194.675 at NCAA Region
al Four Championships at Louisana
State.

On Saturday at the Pete Mar
avieh Assembly Center on the
Louisiana State campus, the Cardi
nal again found the balance beam
as the last remaining obstacle
standing between it and the N( AA
championship tournament.
Same situation, different result.
Leading second-place Central
Michigan by .375 points and third
place LSI! by a full point going into
the last rotation, all the Cardinal
had to do was turn in a solid perfor
mance on the beam to advance to
the national tournament on April
22-24 at the University of Utah.
It did.
Although the 48.525 on the
beam was far from Stanford's best
score on the apparatus this year, ii
was enough to earn the Cardinal a
first-place finish (194.675) at the

Region Four tournament and an
automatic hid to the NCAA Cham
pionships.
No. 5 LSU finished in second
place, also earning a hid It) the na
tional tournament, with a strong
finish on the floor exercise
(49.400). LSI) finished only .075
points behind the Cardinal hut the
top-two finishers were guaranteed
bids to the national tournament.
Leading the way for the Cardi
nal was sophomore Jenny Wilson,
who finished in a tie for third in the
all-around competition with a
score of 38.975. Wilson also fin
ished fifth in the vault (9.775) and
sixth in the balance beam with a
9.775. Auburn's Sarah Wentworth
won the all-around competition
with a 39.150 and teammate Sarah
Balogach finished second with a
score of 39.000.
Stanford's only individual win
ner was freshman katy Herbert,
who finished first in the balance
beam with a 9.875.
Teammate Jen Exaltacion en
tered the Regional tournament
ranked 11th nationally on the bal
ance beam and ended up in third
place with a solid 9.850. Auburn's
Wentworth tied for first with Her
bert.
In the vault. Kent State's Jen
nifer Simmons took home first
place honors with a 9.875 and
teammate krissv Hoeferlin fin
ished second with a 9.825.
Besides winning the tourna
ment and advancing to nationals,
the most encouraging part of Satur
day's performance had to be the re
turn of junior All-American Laris
sa Fontaine, who finished third in
the vault with a 9.800. Fontaine has

been injured for most of the season
with a broken finger and her return
bodes well for the Cardinal's na
tional championship hopes as she is
probably Stanford's top threat in
the vault. Fontaine won the vault at
last year's national championships
on the way to the all-around title!
Senior co-captain Amy Mu
rakami led the way for the Cardinal
in the floor exercise and in the un
even parallel bars competition.
Murakami entered Saturday's
Regional ranked third nationally
on the bars and seventh on the
floor. She finished in third place on
the bars with a 9.825 behind LSU's
Beth Boudreax and Shanyn
MacEachern, who tied for first
with scores of 9.850.
Stanford freshmen katy Her
bert and kristin Jensen posted
scores of 9.775 and 9.725, respec
tively.
Murakami finished fourth on
the floor exercise with a score of
9.900.
Bowling Green's Murny
Oestreng won the competition
with a 9.950 and MacEachern
shared second-place honors along
with Central Michigan's Nicole
Liphardt with scores of 9.925.
Liphardt entered the competition
ranked fourth in the nation in the
floor exercise.
Stanford senior Tracey kohl
posted a solid score on the floor
with a 9.875 and junior Sarah Hard
ing scored a 9.850.

ranked 11th in the country in the
floor exercise.
The Cardinal will have two
weeks to prepare for the NCAA
championships.
