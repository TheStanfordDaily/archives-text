# ASSU hopefuls to square off
## 
### Brian Eule Senior staff writer 
Colorful flyers cram next to one
another in every hall, and banners
drape from the windows of multi
ple row houses. Catch phrases are
everywhere.
But, with the ASSIJ elections
only days away, there is some con
cern that the student body remains
uniformed about the issues and the
candidates and thus unmotivated
to vote.
While the ideas and issues be
hind some of the ASSU candidates
can be found on their Web sites and
in the election handbook, many
students remain in the dark.
In an attempt to promote in
formed voting, the two slates of
candidates for ASSU president and
vice president will engage in a de
bate intended to provide the stu
dent body with some idea of what
the candidates stand for and what
their respective backgrounds are.
The debate, to be held in the

Branner lounge at 7 p.m. tonight,
will be moderated by Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais.
"The ASSU is really the voice of
the students," said President
Maren Norton, who encouraged
students to attend. "As a student,
giving someone the opportunity to
speak on my behalf is not some
thing I take lightlv."

ASSU Presidential Debate

■ TONIGHT: Sophomore Mike
Levin against junior Adam Weiss,
Branner Lounge, 7 p.m.

Branner is "a fairly decent size
venue in the middle of campus, so a
lot of students are able to come,"
Norton added.
However, SCBN, Stanford's
student-run television network,
will not broadcast the event.
"Because there are only two
presidential slates this year and be
cause our cameras were reserved
by other shows in production in ad
vance of the debate's announce

ment, we will not cover it," SCBN's
Brian Karimzad said.
Instead, starting tonight at 10:30
p.m., SCBN will air taped state
ments by those candidates who
chose to participate in the station's
special electoral program.
"Although it is not nearly a full
representation of the candidates,
we feel it will help raise awareness
of the election and put a human
touch to the issues," Karimzad
said. "All candidates were in
formed of the event."
KZSU. Stanford's student-run
radio station at 90.1 FM, also does
not have plans to cover the debate.
The station will air a special ASSU
elections edition of its weekly news
program, "Inside Stanford,"
tonight at 6 p.m. in attempt to in
form and convince students that
this election is pertinent to them.
"We'll he having reports by our
staff on the selections from the
standpoint of the process and also
how involved students feel,"
KZSIJ news director Emily John
son said. "We've also invited the
candidates to come down to the sta
tion and present their positions."
In addition, the radio station
plans to run public service an
nouncements throughout the week
in an attempt to encourage stu
dents to vote and take part in the

ASSU election process.
Presidential write-in candidate
Adam Weiss, a junior, is concerned
about all this confusion and plans
to propose a solution to provide
more pressure on students to vote.
"We have proposed that every
candidate spend one fourth of his
budget on a 'Get Out the Vote'
campaign," Weiss said.
"I don't think we have enough
students in general who are picking
the ASSU leadership. I think the
ASSU does not give enough rea

son. There's just not enough stu
dents involved." he said.
Weiss' opponent, sophomore
Mike Levin, said while he already
spent more than 15 percent of his
budget he still believes getting out
the vote is a crucial issue.
"It's definitely a difficult thing to
get out your platform. You have to
hope that [the electorate] takes ini
tiative." Levin said.
"We go out and talk to people,
but there is only so much we can
do," he said.
