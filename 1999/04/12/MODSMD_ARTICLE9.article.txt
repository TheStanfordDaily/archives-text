BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
(AP) — Saying it showed restraint in
deference to the Orthodox Easter
holiday, NATO nonetheless ham
mered Serb targets in Kosovo yester
day. Western officials, meanwhile,
expressed growing alarm over
reports of atrocities in the province
and said a possible mass grave site
had been spotted.
In Belgium, NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea showed aerial pho
tographs of the site in Pusto Selo,
southwest of the Kosovo capital,
Pristina. He said from the air it
appeared the ground had been fresh
ly turned over and that the site

looked "somewhat similar" to aerial
shots of mass graves seen during the
•war in Bosnia.
"1 suspect... that we are going to
find more and more evidence of
mass graves, mass executions, some
pretty horrific stories," Defense Sec
retary William Cohen said on ABC's
"This Week."
Underscoring concerns about
conditions inside Kosovo, Western
officials say hundreds of thousands
of Kosovo Albanians are believed to
have tied or been driven from their
homes but unable to make their way
out of Kosovo.
About 4(X).(KK) people are hiding

in forests and mountains, terrified of
Serb forces, British Foreign Secre
tary Robin Cook said yesterday after
talking to an ethnic Albanian politi
cal leader in Kosovo.
Cook reported on the plight and
estimated numbers of ethnic Albani
ans in Kosovo after talking by tele
phone with Hashim Thaqi, a Kosovo
Liberation Army commander and
negotiator at peace talks in Ram
bouillet, France. He said NATO
holds Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic responsible for these "vic
tims of his ethnic cleansing."
British officials also said about
10(),00() ethnic Albanian men are

apparently missing. That estimate,
based on fewer than expected men
turning up among refugees crossing
into Macedonia and Albania,
revived speculation that the men had
either been massacred by Serbs,
joined the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army or were being held hostage.
Many of the refugees managing
to get across intermittently open bor
ders — some half a million, all told
— tell of their villages being burned
and emptied.
NATO says the bombing cam
paign, in its 19th day. will go on until
Milosevic withdraws Yugoslav and
Serb units sent to Kosovo.
