UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE ARE
PUTTING TOO MANY RETIREMENT DOLLARS.
Every year, a lot of people make a
huge mistake on their taxes.
They wind up sending Uncle Sam
money they could be saving for
retirement.
Fortunately, that 's a mistake you
can avoid with SRAs — tax-delerred
annuities from TIAA-CREF. SRAs not
only ease your current tax bite, they
offer an easy way to build retirement
income — especially lor the extras
that your pension and Social Security
benefits may not cover. Because your
contributions are made in pretax
dollars, you pay less in taxes now. And
since earnings on your SRAs are tax
deferred, your money works even
harder lor you.
Today, we offer other before- and
after-tax financial solutions, including
IRAs and mutual funds. They 're
backed by the same investment exper
tise, low expenses, and personal
service that have made TIAA-CREF
the choice of America's educational and
research community.
Why write off the chance for a
more rewarding retirement? Stop by
your benefits office or call us at
1 800 8*42-2776 and find out how
TIAA-CREF SRAs can help you enjoy
happier returns.
