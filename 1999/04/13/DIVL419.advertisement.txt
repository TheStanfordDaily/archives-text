$3.63 worth?
KZSU, your Stanford radio station, is asking you for money again: We want
you to vote YES on KZSU's special fee in this week's elections If our fee is
approved, each student will pay a (refundable) fee of $3.63 next year .us (not
$7.45 as erroneously stated in the Election Handbook). That's $1.21 per
quarter.
What can you get for $3.63 these days? At better fast-food joints, that'll get you a
cheeseburger and fries. At local theaters, that's about half the cost of getting in
the door. At the better coffee outlets, that might buy you a double latte with
biscotti on the side.
At KZSU, that'll get you Stanford Football, local bands, Stanford Women's
basketball, independent music, President Casper, jazz, Stanford Men's
basketball, world music, Stanford Women's Volleyball, rock, Stanford
Baseball, hip-hop, news, and, just incidentally, a chance to learn to be a disk
jockey, news reporter, broadcast engineer, or sportscaster. It will also get you
a station that has spent years getting ready for the next disaster, so you'll have
news and information during an emergency. During the earthquake of 1 c )89,
KZSU stayed on the air when big stations went down. During the flood last
year, KZSU brought ymi reports live from Stanford's Emergency Operations
Center. During the power failure last week, KZSU stayed on the air.
All we're asking you for is $3.63 next year. We honestly think it's the
best deal you'll get all year. Please vote YES on the KZSU special fee.
