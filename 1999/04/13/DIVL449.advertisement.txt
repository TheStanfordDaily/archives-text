If you're in search of a little direction, try voting in the ASSU election.
The ASSU President, Vice President and the Senate are all aiming to be campus
eaders. So if you don't have time to fight for your cause of choice on campus,
pick someone who will do it for you. They make a difference. So should you.
TAKE THE TIME. THINK ABOUT IT. MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
