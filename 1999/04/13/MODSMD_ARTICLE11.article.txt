## McDougal acquitted on one count; jury deadlocked on other two Whitewater case a mistrial 
### 
LITTLE ROCK. Ark. (AP) —
Susan McDougal thwarted Kenneth
Starr once again yesterday as a jury
acquitted her of obstructing the
independent counsel's Whitewater
inquiry and deadlocked on two
other charges, causing a mistrial.
"I'm still a little numb," a jubilant
McDougal said outside the court
house. "I've been indicted since
1993, and this is the first day I
haven't been indicted in years."
President Clinton was "pleased to
learn" that his former Whitewater
business partner was acquitted of
obstruction of justice, said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
"He wishes all the best for her and
her family."
McDougal's legal troubles may
not be over, however. Prosecutor
Mark Barrett said Starr anticipated
making a decision this week on
whether to seek a retrial of the two
criminal contempt charges stem
ming from her refusal to answer
grand jurv questions in 19% and
1998.
The jury deadlocked 7-5 in favor
of acquittal on the contempt counts.
Barrett said prosecutors would ask
the court for permission to interview
jurors about their reasoning. One
juror told reporters that McDougal's
state of mind — she said she feared
prosecutors — was the key to the
case.
The five-week trial featured an
unusual lineup of witnesses: three
grand jurors, three Whitewater pros
ecutors, another woman charged

with obstructing Starr's investigation
and videotaped testimony from
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
McDougal took the witness stand
in her own defense, answering some
of the same questions she refused to
address in front of the grand juries.
McDougal's lawyers attempted
to put Starr's tactics on trial, arguing
that her refusal to give grand jury
testimony was based on justifiable
fear that she would be charged with
perjury unless she falsely implicated
the president and first lady in wrong
doing.
After eight hours and 45 minutes
of deliberations, spread over three
days, the jurors sent out a note at
midday yesterday saying they were
"hopelessly deadlocked" on two
counts.
U.S. District Judge George
Howard Jr. polled the jurors, and
nine said it would be a waste of time
to continue deliberating. "I don't
believe in arm-twisting." Howard
said before declaring a mistrial on
those two counts and allowing the
jury to announce its verdict on
obstruction.
McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos
challenged prosecutors to try his
client again, saying, "They don't
have the guts to retry this case again
because now we know where the
bodies are buried."
Barrett said that if there is a retri
al on the two criminal contempt
counts, it's unlikely McDougal
would be allowed to again inject her
allegations that Starr wanted her to

lie.
McDougal's accusation was
allowed into the trial only as a
defense to the obstruction charge,
under which prosecutors were
required to show that McDougal
had acted with corrupt intent when
she refused to testify.
The jury was instructed not to
consider her allegation that prosecu
tors wanted her to lie in regard to the
contempt counts.
One of the jurors who wanted to
acquit McDougal on all three
counts, Michael Nance, insisted
Starr's office "was not on trial here,
only Mrs. McDougal."
"She honestly believed that she
could be held for a false statement"
and that explained why she didn't
talk, said Nance, who came close to
being thrown off the jury Friday
when he brought a law book to the
deliberations. Nance said he brought
in the book in an effort to get guid
ance on state of mind.
Howard concluded that Nance
hadn't been influenced by the law
book, which had belonged to a for
mer Arkansas Supreme Court jus
tice. John I. Purtle. who is acquaint
ed with the Clintons and the
McDougals. Purtle apparently left
the book behind when he sold his
house to Nance.
McDougal already had served 18
months in jail for civil contempt
based on her refusal to answer grand
jury questions. She also served two
months of a two-year term on four
felonv convictions in her 1996 trial.
