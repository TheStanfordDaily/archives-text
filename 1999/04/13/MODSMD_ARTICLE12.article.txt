BELGRADE. Yugoslavia (AP) — A new wave of
NATO attacks targeted Yugoslav fuel depots and heavy
industry yesterday, and an allied hit was blamed for turn
ing a Yugoslav passenger train into a heap of burning
wreckage. Serb officials said at least nine people aboard
the train were killed and 16 injured.
Even as the alliance expressed regret over loss of civil
ian life. NATO foreign ministers — meeting for the first
time since the nearly three-week-long air campaign
began — vowed to press ahead, saying the Kosovo crisis
"represents a fundamental challenge to the values of
democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
Yugoslavia's parliament, meanwhile, voted to join an
alliance with Russia and Belarus — an apparent move to
try to draw Russia into the conflict, although Russia has
said it will not get militarily involved.
Russia favors the idea of incorporating Yugoslavia
into the alliance that already includes it and Belarus, but
said membership wouldn't be instantaneous and any mil
itary aid wouldn't be automatically granted.
Yugoslavia denounced the "criminal attack" on the
passenger train. The alliance did not directly confirm the
hit. but acknowledged it had struck a rail bridge consid
ered an important military supply line and said the train
may have been on or near it at the time.
"Regrettably, we cannot exclude the possibility of
casualties in this instance," said a statement by the
Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe.
President Clinton expressed resolve yesterday to win
the air war against Yugoslavia and said President Slobo
dan Milosevic "should be under no illusions that we will
end it from weariness."
Despite bad weather, NATO struck Serb targets
including a fuel refinery, the principal airport in Kosovo
and the Balkans' biggest heavy-equipment factory.
The alliance says bombing will continue until Milose
vic withdraws his forces from Serbia's southern Kosovo
province and accepts foreign troops to enforce the peace.
In the latest wave of NA TO airstrikes:

•Flames leaped into the night sky over Pancevo, just
across the Danube from Belgrade, as fire engulfed one of
Yugoslavia's biggest oil refineries early yesterday.
•The factory that makes Yugo cars —housed in a
complex that also makes weapons — was hammered
again early yesterday after being badly damaged last
week, Tanjug said. The manager of the Zastava complex
in Kragujevac, 45 miles southwest of Belgrade, said dam
age totaled $1 billion.
•Serbia's second-largest city, Novi Sad, where two
major bridges were wrecked early on in the air cam
paign, was hit. Tanjug said a missile struck a residential
area Sunday evening, but NATO said there were sur
face-to-air missile production and storage facilities in the
area.
•A heating plant and the Balkans' biggest heavy
equipment factory were hit in the central Serbian town
of Krusevac, catching fire, Tanjug said. Serbian TV said
civilians were wounded, but reported no deaths.
•Pristina's Slatina airport, whose terminal was report
edly wrecked in weekend strikes, came under new
attack, Tanjug said. It said the region southeast of the
capital was also targeted, with cluster bombs dropped in
the southern municipality of Lipljani.
Along Yugoslavia's border with Albania, fighting
between Serb forces and Kosovo rebels was reportedly
intensifying. A dispatch carried by the state-run Tanjug
news agency claimed at least 150 rebels were killed in a
border clash. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
Meanwhile, Kosovo refugees crossing into neighbor
ing Macedonia and Albania continued to speak of Serb
atrocities. More than half a million ethnic Albanians
have tied or been driven out of the province, saying they
were terrorized by Serb forces.
Milosevic launched his crackdown on the separatist
minded Kosovo Liberation Army 14 months ago. Serb
forces are accused of killing and terrorizing ethnic Alba
nians, driving hundreds of thousands from their homes.
