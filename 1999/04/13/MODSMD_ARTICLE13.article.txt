Of two strong tickets,
Weiss-Lotz presidential
slate is strongest

Adam weiss and
Jonathan Lotz boast the
strongest ticket in this year's
ASSU presidential election. They
combine a proven track record with
realistic proposals for change.
In a race with significant experi
ence on both sides, Weiss has proven
his capacity for efficient government.
He has served effectively since fall
quarter as ASSU Senate Chair.
We believe that Weiss and Lotz can
effectively work with and expand the
model of ASSU executive govern
ment established by current ASSU
President Maren Norton and Vice
President Santos Marroquin, a model
which was lauded by both presidential
j slates.
| Specifically, we found that the
Weiss-Lotz ticket's plan for staying in
touch with the student body was one
of the most compelling reasons for
our endorsement of this ticket.
The two juniors propose to expand
the Norton-Marroquin paradigm by
working with student group leaders to
more effectively represent their con
stituents. We find this vision to be
both realistic and positive for Stan
ford students.
In terms of stated goals and slated
projects for the upcoming year, the
Weiss-Lotz ticket maintains an

impressive balance between tackling
difficult issues and enumerating real
istic goals. Choosing a controversial
topic such as tenure reform as a key
issue is without question a bold move,
while proposing to help rectify stu
dent space issues in reference to
Greek housing and meeting venues is
a more tangible goal.
Weiss and Lotz have also brought a
very timely issue to the forefront of
campus debate. There has been little
discussion in recent memory of pro
viding day care for students with chil
dren â€” Weiss and Lotz propose using
Bowman Alumni House, which will
soon be vacated by the Alumni Asso
ciation, for this purpose.
Another relevant issue that this
slate has addressed is the need for
internal ASSU reform, particularly
with regard to the complicated fund
ing process by which the ASSU sup
ports many student groups. We
believe that reforming that system is
necessary and that Weiss and Lotz are
qualified to spearhead the effort.
Finally, the Weiss-Lotz ticket
endeavors to utilize more of Tresidder
Memorial Union for students. We find
this goal to be another achievable,
desirable plan of action.
This ASSU election is shaping up
to be nothing if not unique.
Having thoughtfully considered
and debated the issues we feel are
most pertinent to the ASSU presiden
tial race, we urge you to write in a
vote for Adam Weiss and Jonathan
Lotz during this election week.
