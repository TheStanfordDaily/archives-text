# Sprinkle cool patience
## Atiba Pertilla Beware the Ides of April 
### 
IT'S THE MOST
wonderful time of the
year, at least at Stan
ford. Everyone seems
unreasonably happy, per
haps because we're con
vinced that the change in
qu»*rters must hera|d a

her as well, though nature
has refused to cooperate with our idealist
hopes thus far. Passing strangers, the peo
ple at the Post Office and, most of all. grad
uating seniors with jobs seem to smile more
often than usual, already looking forward
to the end of the quarter and better and
brighter things this summer.
Smiling hardest, however, are the candi
dates for this week's University-wide elec
tions. It took roughly 50 minutes of watch
ing the bulletin boards on my floor fill up
with flyers to destroy my preconceptions
about Stanford students and apathy.
Maybe it's not that we don't care about
anything — maybe it's that we don't care
unless the cause is really, really important,
like becoming an ASSU senator.
I don't find it hard to believe that serv
ing on the ASSU can be an important step

ping stone to a future career in politics. In
some Southern universities, student gov
ernments were once dominated by elec
toral machines that were important feeders
for men hoping to go into statewide and
even national politics. And, closer to home,
it gets pointed out ud nauseum that today's
ASSU presidents are following in the foot
steps of Senaton-Dianne Feinstein (D-
Calif.).
Hut year after year, 1 find myself won
dering whether our would-be representa
tives are in the race for the experience of
campaigning or the experience of legislat
ing. No small amount of energy goes into
conjuring up slogans and clever graphics,
even when the results turn out to be rather
regrettable. (Remember those skiing cows
some years back?) A brief scan of the
posters, unfortunately, reveals little about
exactly what the candidates hope to accom
plish once they've gained our votes, and
while it's comforting to read in the Elec
tions Handbook that more than half our
would-be senators served as class president
in high school, this knowledge gives me lit
tle confidence in their ability to administer
the $1.5 million that How into the ASSU's

coffers every year.
The problem, it seems, is accountability.
I'm sure many senate candidates intend to
make the most of their terms of office, to
"shake up" the system or "take care of
business," but the most exhilarating
moment of these budding politicians'
careers may come when they realize, based
on past experience, that they're not expect
ed to actually accomplish anything and that
they have little real responsibility to their
electorate to respond to its needs.
In some instances, this year has been a
refreshing change: I remember coming
back to campus late one night on a Caltrain
from San Francisco and discovering a Mid
night Marguerite waiting there rather than
the usual half-mile walk — a concrete
necessity that wouldn't have been possible
if not for the ASSU. A reminder that when
our representatives put their minds to it,
they really can improve the quality of life
on campus.
