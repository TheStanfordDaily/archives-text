Trust will make new GSC work
I am writing in response to yesterday's
Daily editorial, "A Poor Foundation."
There is a great deal of unnecessary con
cern, worry and suspicion regarding the pro
posed constitutional amendment. The Daily
wrote that the new ASSU would "lack the
strong foundation and permanence that
constitutional foundations provide" and
seemed distrustful of a form of government
which "is so highly dependent on agreement
between [its] members." The Daily criti
cized the amendements' proponents —
which include a number of extremely
respected, hard-working and dedicated stu
dents who serve on both the graduate sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council
simultaneously —of proposing a govern
ment which is "convenient."
What seems to be missing from The
Daily's viewpoint is some trust in the ASSU
and some faith in Stanford students to
watch over their elected officials. The
ASSU Senate and the GSC exist to serve
students, and no matter what kind of struc
ture exists, the only real way to hold student
leaders accountable is to pay attention and
use good old-fashioned peer pressure.
Obviously, if we choose leaders who have
bad intentions and impossible dispositions,
any kind of structure can fail. On the other
hand, if we choose elected officials who are
dedicated to improving life at Stanford,
then the wrong kind of government struc
ture — one which burdens its members with
unnecessary formality and bureaucracy —
will certainly waste time, money, energy
and ideas.

Hut, as this year's GSC has proven, if we
implement the right kind of structure, we
can set the stage for dedicated leaders to
create real change and real progress.
A solid foundation is indeed necessary,
and the dedicated graduate senators and
GSC members have worked night and day
for the past several months to ensure that
the amendment and bylaws will provide for
this foundation well. Stanford students
should not be skeptical but instead look for
ward to a new ASSU with less red tape and
more results.

Daily Editorial was inaccurate
Although yesterday's Daily editorial
attacking the proposed constitutional
amendment claimed that the Editorial
Board had "scrutiniz[ed] pages of material
and deliberated] for hours," the shoddy
reasoning and gross factual errors found
within it raise doubts that they even both
ered to read the current ASSU Constitu
tion, let alone the proposed changes to it.
The editorial claims, "The proposed sys
tem allows for both the creation and
destruction of bylaws at any time based
solely on the two-thirds vote of those GSC
members present."
Of course, it fails to note that this is
exactly the same procedure as the current
system: "The bylaws of the Association may
be amended at a regular meeting of the Sen
ate by a vote of two-thirds of the members

present and voting...The Daily must be
using a peculiar form of logic if a feature is
good under the current system, but trans
muted to "bad" when preserved in the
amendment.
After one clears away this and similar
misrepresentations, one sees that The Daily
has no real arguments against the amend
ment. Even the editorial admits as much.
"Perhaps there is a new system of govern
ment yet to be implemented that would
combine the strong points of both types of
government." And perhaps the moon will
fall out of the sky tomorrow. The Daily
gives no indication of what such a hypothe
sized system might be. contenting itself with
mouthing vague platitudes like "govern
ment must adhere to strict guidelines".
What do they mean by this? Who knows?
One would have thought that one of the
"strict guidelines" to which government
should adhere is that it should represent the
people it claims to serve. And even The
Daily concedes that the current system fails
to do so for the majority of students at Stan
ford.
The facts of the matter are this: the cur
rent system does not work for graduate stu
dents and never has worked. One can go
back over 30 years and see that graduate
issues have never been addressed within the
framework of the ASSU. Over the past
three years, the GSC has constructed the
first working graduate government in the
history of student government at Stanford.
All of The Daily's irresponsible and unethi
cal omissions cannot change this simple fact:
the GSC works for graduate students. The
Daily is reduced to arguing that the students

at Stanford should wait for the sake of wait
ing, while trying to argue that features that
are the same between the current and pro
posed new systems are somehow only bad
under the new one. This is the last, desper
ate cry of those who wish to kill a good idea
but have no legitimate reasons for doing so.
I encourage everyone who votes to ignore
The Daily's empty, meaningless ravings and
cast a vote in favor of "An ASSU For All
Students."

Daily's claims were irresponsible
The Daily's manipulation and invention
of facts in its attempts to defame the consti
tutional amendment yesterday were shock
ingly irresponsible and unethical. We will
try to undo the damage by explaining what
they have done.
Yesterday's front-page article accused
the ASSU of unconstitutional failure to
notify the public about the constitutional
amendment on the ASSU election ballot. If
The Daily had quoted the relevant section
of the ASSU Constitution, it would have
been extremely obvious to its readers that
all requirements of the constitution were
unambiguously met. The Daily's fabrication
of a front-page news article indicating oth
erwise was unambiguously dishonest.
The ASSU Constitution requires that
"the title of the proposed amendment, the
dates of the ratification election and a state
ment explaining how to obtain a copy of the
text of the amendment shall be published in
The Stanford Daily at least seven days prior
to the election." The amendment informa
tion was published in the Feb. 9 and 10
issues of The Daily, so the information has
been available for about two months. The
election dates were published in advance of
campaign week. The Daily was very aware
of these facts before going to print.
Yesterday's editorial claims that the pro
posed Graduate Student Council has "little
constitutional protection ... as opposed to
the current system that governs the ASSIJ
Senate." In fact, the constitutional structure
of the proposed GSC is almost identical to
the existing senate, with dozens of protec
tive mechanisms ranging from quorum
requirements to recall measures. Also con
trary to a claim by The Daily, the current
senate and the (ISC' would both be gov
erned by bylaws that extend the constitu
tional protections, and provisions to change
them are identical.
The Daily falsely asserted that the ASSU
bylaws "require" that the ASSU make "a
concerted effort to find someone to write an
opposing statement." This appears nowhere
in the bylaws. Furthermore, they attribute
the (JSC's consensus decision-making pro
cess to the amendment, which is irrelevant
and misleading. Both the amendment and
bylaws require majority or supermajority
votes among elected members when con
sensus breaks down.
We hope that the readers of The Daily
understand that the irresponsible and
unethical handling of this issue by The
Daily's editors makes them an unreliable
source of information. We encourage read
ers to instead read the online election hand
book at http://election.stanford.edu, which
contains the amendment text, read the sum
mary in the printed election handbook, read
supporting information on the GSC Web
site at http://assu.stanford.edu/grad/, or to
contact their ASSIi senators for more infor
mation. It is unfortunate that The Daily, by
far the most efficient means of mass com
munication on this campus, has so thor
oughly discredited itself.

Election flyers have no message
More than likely, you have noticed the
multitudinous campaign flyers throughout
the campus. I find these flyers to be a
tremendous eyesore and a great source of
litter on our campus. They are nonetheless
perhaps a necessary evil, as much of Stan
ford's apolitical student body would other
wise remain oblivious to the upcoming elec
tions without them.
My main gripe is with the content — or
lack thereof—of these flyers. Although
there are a few meaningful flyers out there,
the majority of them say little, if anything,
about a candidate or the candidate's views.
In particular, I would like to bring atten
tion to a flyer I found not only particularly

empty but also offensive. Its caption reads
"Mike Sloan knows how to take care of
business" and is followed by a picture of
somebody, presumably the candidate, uri
nating on a Cal license plate.
I don't know what "business" is sup
posed to denote here (indeed, that knowl
edge would take care of half my objection),
but I do know that I found this photograph
offensive and degrading both to myself and
to UC-Berkeley — a fine institution deserv
ing praise rather than this debasement.
I do not wish to imply that I am against
our rivalry with Cal, but I believe our rival
ry should remain pure and should be limit
ed to the spheres of athletics and, to a
greater degree, academics. At the least, this
rivalry is not the grounds for a campaign
slogan, nor is public urination. Perhaps
Sloan does not know any better, but whoev
er took the photograph should.
I urge all Stanford students to consult
their election handbook and to visit the
online election handbook to get a better
idea of what, if anything, each candidate
stands for.

Senate candidate's reply
I write this in response to David Stein's
column, which appeared in yesterday's
Daily. The aphorism "Don't just a book by
its cover" fittingly applies to the ASSU Sen
ate campaign — one must remember to
peruse a book before making any substan
tial judgements on its content.
Though critics remark that my ASSU
senate campaign can be visually reduced to
the image of a yellow tennis ball, there are
certain ideas and ideals underlying that eye
catching icon. I rely on the Wilson tennis
ball to differentiate my campaign from the
rest, as does every other campaigner, and
such identification is necessary on a campus
flooded with election posters. However, my
political platform is also available to any
one, and I believe my fundamental goals are
realistic, practical and grounded.
I have approached the elections hand
book candidate statement, the discussion on
KZSIJ and the Senator Day activities with a
serious attitude and with unique objectives
of how I will use the Senate position to truly
make a difference for students on campus. I
know that many other candidates share my
seriousness.

Role of GSC was overlooked
We'd like to point out a glaring omission
from The Daily's otherwise helpful April 7
editorial regarding recent plans announced
by the University to increase subsidized
graduate student housing and graduate stu
dent stipends.
Yes, the University has begun taking
steps to address the housing crisis graduate
students are confronting. But this belated
initiative didn't arise solely through admin
istrative will.
The editorial juxtaposes The Daily's own
suggestion regarding housing from a year
ago and University Provost Condoleezza
Rice's recent announcement but fails to
mention one of the most important stimuli
for an aggressive approach toward graduate

housing. The Graduate Student Council, a
group of concerned graduate students
which currently functions as an adjunct of
the ASSU, organized a massive survey of
graduate student opinions on housing last
spring and spearheaded the huge Campout
on the Quad housing rally last May to bring
attention to the issue.
Perhaps more importantly, the GSC fol
lowed up on its initial actions by continual
ly pursuing the subject with administrators,
by keeping graduate students informed of
housing options, by offering valuable input
in decisions regarding stipends, new on
campus housing and off-campus leased
units and by quelling community opposition
to new construction by prompting many
graduate students to attend town meetings
hosted by the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission.
Make no mistake about it. The GSC has
been the most forceful advocate for more
graduate housing over the last year, and its
efforts have strongly influenced the Univer
sity's plans to address the remaining hous
ing shortage. The Daily was correct to
praise the administration for making efforts
to address the problem. But, to be fair, we
should realize that there is little evidence
these efforts would have been taken with
out the persuasive leadership of the GSC.

Facilities not only part of learning
I am responding to the article "Med
School barely escapes probation" (April 6).
The quality of the outstanding basic sci
ence and clinical education at the School of
Medicine has been overshadowed by the
facilities debate. It needs to be broadcast
with clarity and emphasis: new facilities are
not equivalent to an outstanding medical
education.
And where are the radio, television and
newspaper interviews with seniors and
alumni? Alumni relate stories of the excel
lence of their medical education when com
pared to that of graduates of other medical
schools. These letters, personal correspon
dence and telephone calls are never report
ed because the news is "good."
When the medical library was built, it
reflected the attractiveness of open air.
Hooded light and courtyards of the golden
land of California. To me, this inherent
beauty and serenity remain. I love to read in
the library with an open door on a warm
summer afternoon, the sounds of birds, the
stillness surrounding the atrium.
The Fleischmann laboratories were
places where medical students conducted
experiments before curriculum reform
changed the paradigm and where students
of the era learned to perform the laborato
ry procedures they would carry out when
they became residents.
The "shining city on the hill" is where 1
strive to be when I teach and practice
medicine; the philosophy, ethics, motivation
and compassion of the people living in the
"city" outweigh its appearance.
Medical School Dean Eugene Bauer and
Senior Assoc. Dean Phyllis Gardner arc
leading the way to making the necessary
changes in the structure, functionality and
educational evolution of our School; state

of-the-art facilities will complement our
exemplary teachers and curriculum. Deni
grating what we have now is demeaning to
our dedicated faculty scientists and clini
cians, student colleagues and alumni, all of
whom contribute to and have created our
"shining city."

Health decisions not easily judged
As the thoracic surgeon who treated
Erica Gielow after she was admitted to the
Stanford University Hospital, 1 was dis
mayed at your April 7 article criticizing the
physicians at the Cowell Student Health
Center.
Primary care physicians see an enormous
number of people with a variety of symp
toms that are often musculoskeletal in
nature and of no medical significance.
Ms. Gielow had symptoms of musculo
skeletal and pleuritic pain when she first vis
ited the Health Center. Her physical exam
did not show any decreased breath sounds
on either side that would have been a sign of
a collapsed lung. A collapsed lung, or a
pneumothorax, is a very rare occurrence in
the general population and is therefore not
the first diagnosis for a young person with
chest pain.
Asked to come back if the pain persisted,
she returned appropriately to the Health
Center after a few days when a chest X-ray
was ordered and the collapse was seen.
When she arrived at the hospital, she had
some chest pain but was not in any danger.
Young people with a pneumothorax will
quite often describe a past experience of
fleeting chest pain that was almost certainly
a previous episode of a collapse that was
never treated. Ms. Gielow's pain continued
because she had a persistent air leak in her
lung that occurs in about a quarter of
patients. It is these patients that usually
require a relatively minor operation to
repair the leak.
I believe that it is difficult and often dan
gerous to judge any medical situation with
out interviewing the treating physician
involved. Subspecialists at Stanford who see
patients in consultation referred to them by
the primary care providers at Cowell know
well the consistently high quality of medical
care this excellent group provides to Stan
ford students. It is unfortunate that critical
articles like this one fall far of the truth and
irresponsibly misrepresent an outstanding
Health Center.

Kyoto Protocol should he passed
Thomas Moore's April 10 letter to the
editor is misleading in many regards. He
asserts the Kyoto Protocol is a "bad" treaty
and lists several "facts" to support his argu
ment. The majority of scientists and policy
analysts who have carefully and objectively
looked at the Kyoto Protocol have conclud
ed the opposite,
Moore contends the Kyoto Protocol will
lead to layoffs, businesses closing and "dev
astating" impacts on certain industries. This
is absolutely not true.
Moore quotes the Department of Ener

gy to support his assertion. The DOE is so
obviously biased against the Protocol that
most of their analyses are utter nonsense.
The DOE reports purposefully excluded
consideration of market based compliance
schemes such as emission trading, joint
implementation and the clean development
mechanism that the Kyoto Protocol
employs.
For every DOE report predicting eco
nomic catastrophe, there are an equal num
ber of reports suggesting the Protocol will
produce a net economic gain for the United
States by making our industries more effi
cient.
The Kyoto Protocol will also produce
new jobs in areas such as energy efficiency,
cleaner technologies and monitoring and
verification technologies. Moore's "facts"
are cherry-picked, worst-case-scenarios.
Moore also cites the former head of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change as suggesting that the Kyoto Proto
col will have no impact on global warming.
Moore's suggestion is ridiculous.
The Kyoto Protocol requires the world's
industrialized countries to reduce green
house gas emissions substantially over a
baseline scenario. This will reduce the
amount of greenhouse gases that accurnu*
late in the atmosphere. This will be an
important first step toward slowing climate
change. Interestingly, the logical conclusion
from Moore's arguments is that the Kyoto
Protocol does not go far enough!
While many people agree that the Kyoto
Protocol is not strong enough, it is an
important first step. Importantly, the Kyoto
Protocol begins to harness market forces
toward combating global warming.
But Moore's assertion that global warm
ing will produce health benefits is by far his
most preposterous argument. By suggesting
that a warmer world is a healthier world
because doctors often recommend that sick
people move to more clement climates, Mr.
Moore's obvious bias is apparent.
Almost every peer-reviewed article on
the subject suggests that a warmer world
will lead to more diseases, more infections
and more cancers.
The White House has suggested that
global warming will possibly lead to 10,000
more deaths annually in the United States.
Moore's research that global warming will
reduce deaths by 40,(XX) annually in the
United States is silly. Have Moore's findings
been published in a peer-reviewed, scientif
ic article?
Will the Kyoto Protocol solve global
warming without any costs? Probably not.
Some industries will be affected. Con
sumers may pay a few cents more per gallon
at the gas pump. However, the public and
the scientific community largely support
this treaty.
It is a fair, efficient, affordable and
responsible action. Perhaps that is why
more than 1 (X) nations have signed the
treaty, and thousands of scientists and
economists are calling for its adoption.
As the world's largest producer of green
house gases, the United States must objec
tively look at the Protocol and decide
whether or not to ratify it. Without U.S. rat
ification, the treaty will not go into effect.
In today's complicated world, there is no
need for people or companies that manipu
late a complex issue to their advantage.

ing shortage. The Daily was correct to
praise the administration for making efforts
to address the problem. But, to be fair, we
should realize that there is little evidence
these efforts would have been taken with
out the persuasive leadership of the GSC.

Facilities not only part of learning
I am responding to the article "Med
School barely escapes probation" (April 6).
The quality of the outstanding basic sci
ence and clinical education at the School of
Medicine has been overshadowed by the
facilities debate. It needs to be broadcast
with clarity and emphasis: new facilities are
not equivalent to an outstanding medical
education.
And where are the radio, television and
newspaper interviews with seniors and
alumni? Alumni relate stories of the excel
lence of their medical education when com
pared to that of graduates of other medical
schools. These letters, personal correspon
dence and telephone calls are never report
ed because the news is "good."
When the medical library was built, it
reflected the attractiveness of open air.
Hooded light and courtyards of the golden
land of California. To me, this inherent
beauty and serenity remain. I love to read in
the library with an open door on a warm
summer afternoon, the sounds of birds, the
stillness surrounding the atrium.
The Fleischmann laboratories were
places where medical students conducted
experiments before curriculum reform
changed the paradigm and where students
of the era learned to perform the laborato
ry procedures they would carry out when
they became residents.
The "shining city on the hill" is where 1
strive to be when I teach and practice
medicine; the philosophy, ethics, motivation
and compassion of the people living in the
"city" outweigh its appearance.
Medical School Dean Eugene Bauer and
Senior Assoc. Dean Phyllis Gardner arc

changes in the structure, functionality and
educational evolution of our School; state

our dedicated faculty scientists and clini
cians, student colleagues and alumni, all of
whom contribute to and have created our
"shining city."

Health decisions not easily judged
As the thoracic surgeon who treated
Erica Gielow after she was admitted to the
Stanford University Hospital, 1 was dis
mayed at your April 7 article criticizing the
physicians at the Cowell Student Health
Center.
Primary care physicians see an enormous
number of people with a variety of symp
toms that are often musculoskeletal in
nature and of no medical significance.
Ms. Gielow had symptoms of musculo
skeletal and pleuritic pain when she first vis
ited the Health Center. Her physical exam
did not show any decreased breath sounds
on either side that would have been a sign of
a collapsed lung. A collapsed lung, or a
pneumothorax, is a very rare occurrence in
the general population and is therefore not
the first diagnosis for a young person with
chest pain.
Asked to come back if the pain persisted,
she returned appropriately to the Health
Center after a few days when a chest X-ray
was ordered and the collapse was seen.
When she arrived at the hospital, she had
some chest pain but was not in any danger.
Young people with a pneumothorax will
quite often describe a past experience of
fleeting chest pain that was almost certainly
a previous episode of a collapse that was
never treated. Ms. Gielow's pain continued
because she had a persistent air leak in her
lung that occurs in about a quarter of
patients. It is these patients that usually
require a relatively minor operation to
repair the leak.
I believe that it is difficult and often dan
gerous to judge any medical situation with
out interviewing the treating physician
involved. Subspecialists at Stanford who see
patients in consultation referred to them by
the primary care providers at Cowell know
well the consistently high quality of medical
care this excellent group provides to Stan
ford students. It is unfortunate that critical
articles like this one fall far of the truth and
irresponsibly misrepresent an outstanding
Health Center.

Kyoto Protocol should he passed
Thomas Moore's April 10 letter to the
editor is misleading in many regards. He
asserts the Kyoto Protocol is a "bad" treaty
and lists several "facts" to support his argu
ment. The majority of scientists and policy
analysts who have carefully and objectively
looked at the Kyoto Protocol have conclud
ed the opposite,
Moore contends the Kyoto Protocol will
lead to layoffs, businesses closing and "dev
astating" impacts on certain industries. This
is absolutely not true.
Moore quotes the Department of Ener

gy to support his assertion. The DOE is so
obviously biased against the Protocol that
most of their analyses are utter nonsense.
The DOE reports purposefully excluded
consideration of market based compliance
schemes such as emission trading, joint
implementation and the clean development
mechanism that the Kyoto Protocol
employs.
For every DOE report predicting eco
nomic catastrophe, there are an equal num
ber of reports suggesting the Protocol will
produce a net economic gain for the United
States by making our industries more effi
cient.
The Kyoto Protocol will also produce
new jobs in areas such as energy efficiency,
cleaner technologies and monitoring and
verification technologies. Moore's "facts"
are cherry-picked, worst-case-scenarios.
Moore also cites the former head of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change as suggesting that the Kyoto Proto
col will have no impact on global warming.
Moore's suggestion is ridiculous.
The Kyoto Protocol requires the world's
industrialized countries to reduce green
house gas emissions substantially over a
baseline scenario. This will reduce the
amount of greenhouse gases that accurnu*
late in the atmosphere. This will be an
important first step toward slowing climate
change. Interestingly, the logical conclusion
from Moore's arguments is that the Kyoto
Protocol does not go far enough!
While many people agree that the Kyoto
Protocol is not strong enough, it is an
important first step. Importantly, the Kyoto
Protocol begins to harness market forces
toward combating global warming.
But Moore's assertion that global warm
ing will produce health benefits is by far his
most preposterous argument. By suggesting
that a warmer world is a healthier world
because doctors often recommend that sick
people move to more clement climates, Mr.
Moore's obvious bias is apparent.
Almost every peer-reviewed article on
the subject suggests that a warmer world
will lead to more diseases, more infections
and more cancers.
The White House has suggested that
global warming will possibly lead to 10,000
more deaths annually in the United States.
Moore's research that global warming will
reduce deaths by 40,(XX) annually in the
United States is silly. Have Moore's findings
been published in a peer-reviewed, scientif
ic article?
Will the Kyoto Protocol solve global
warming without any costs? Probably not.
Some industries will be affected. Con
sumers may pay a few cents more per gallon
at the gas pump. However, the public and
the scientific community largely support
this treaty.
It is a fair, efficient, affordable and
responsible action. Perhaps that is why
more than 1 (X) nations have signed the
treaty, and thousands of scientists and
economists are calling for its adoption.
As the world's largest producer of green
house gases, the United States must objec
tively look at the Protocol and decide
whether or not to ratify it. Without U.S. rat
ification, the treaty will not go into effect.
In today's complicated world, there is no
need for people or companies that manipu
late a complex issue to their advantage.

Trust will make new GSC work
I am writing in response to yesterday's
Daily editorial, "A Poor Foundation."
There is a great deal of unnecessary con
cern, worry and suspicion regarding the pro
posed constitutional amendment. The Daily
wrote that the new ASSU would "lack the
strong foundation and permanence that
constitutional foundations provide" and
seemed distrustful of a form of government
which "is so highly dependent on agreement
between [its] members." The Daily criti
cized the amendements' proponents —
which include a number of extremely
respected, hard-working and dedicated stu
dents who serve on both the graduate sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council
simultaneously —of proposing a govern
ment which is "convenient."
What seems to be missing from The
Daily's viewpoint is some trust in the ASSU
and some faith in Stanford students to
watch over their elected officials. The
ASSU Senate and the GSC exist to serve
students, and no matter what kind of struc
ture exists, the only real way to hold student
leaders accountable is to pay attention and
use good old-fashioned peer pressure.
Obviously, if we choose leaders who have
bad intentions and impossible dispositions,
any kind of structure can fail. On the other
hand, if we choose elected officials who are
dedicated to improving life at Stanford,
then the wrong kind of government struc
ture — one which burdens its members with
unnecessary formality and bureaucracy —
will certainly waste time, money, energy
and ideas.

Hut, as this year's GSC has proven, if we
implement the right kind of structure, we
can set the stage for dedicated leaders to
create real change and real progress.
A solid foundation is indeed necessary,
and the dedicated graduate senators and
GSC members have worked night and day
for the past several months to ensure that
the amendment and bylaws will provide for
this foundation well. Stanford students
should not be skeptical but instead look for
ward to a new ASSU with less red tape and
more results.

Daily Editorial was inaccurate
Although yesterday's Daily editorial
attacking the proposed constitutional
amendment claimed that the Editorial
Board had "scrutiniz[ed] pages of material
and deliberated] for hours," the shoddy
reasoning and gross factual errors found
within it raise doubts that they even both
ered to read the current ASSU Constitu
tion, let alone the proposed changes to it.
The editorial claims, "The proposed sys
tem allows for both the creation and
destruction of bylaws at any time based
solely on the two-thirds vote of those GSC
members present."
Of course, it fails to note that this is
exactly the same procedure as the current
system: "The bylaws of the Association may
be amended at a regular meeting of the Sen
ate by a vote of two-thirds of the members

present and voting...The Daily must be
using a peculiar form of logic if a feature is
good under the current system, but trans
muted to "bad" when preserved in the
amendment.
After one clears away this and similar
misrepresentations, one sees that The Daily
has no real arguments against the amend
ment. Even the editorial admits as much.
"Perhaps there is a new system of govern
ment yet to be implemented that would
combine the strong points of both types of
government." And perhaps the moon will
fall out of the sky tomorrow. The Daily
gives no indication of what such a hypothe
sized system might be. contenting itself with
mouthing vague platitudes like "govern
ment must adhere to strict guidelines".
What do they mean by this? Who knows?
One would have thought that one of the
"strict guidelines" to which government
should adhere is that it should represent the
people it claims to serve. And even The
Daily concedes that the current system fails
to do so for the majority of students at Stan
ford.
The facts of the matter are this: the cur
rent system does not work for graduate stu
dents and never has worked. One can go
back over 30 years and see that graduate
issues have never been addressed within the
framework of the ASSU. Over the past
three years, the GSC has constructed the
first working graduate government in the
history of student government at Stanford.
All of The Daily's irresponsible and unethi
cal omissions cannot change this simple fact:
the GSC works for graduate students. The
Daily is reduced to arguing that the students

at Stanford should wait for the sake of wait
ing, while trying to argue that features that
are the same between the current and pro
posed new systems are somehow only bad
under the new one. This is the last, desper
ate cry of those who wish to kill a good idea
but have no legitimate reasons for doing so.
I encourage everyone who votes to ignore
The Daily's empty, meaningless ravings and
cast a vote in favor of "An ASSU For All
Students."

Daily's claims were irresponsible
The Daily's manipulation and invention
of facts in its attempts to defame the consti
tutional amendment yesterday were shock
ingly irresponsible and unethical. We will
try to undo the damage by explaining what
they have done.
Yesterday's front-page article accused
the ASSU of unconstitutional failure to
notify the public about the constitutional
amendment on the ASSU election ballot. If
The Daily had quoted the relevant section
of the ASSU Constitution, it would have
been extremely obvious to its readers that
all requirements of the constitution were
unambiguously met. The Daily's fabrication
of a front-page news article indicating oth
erwise was unambiguously dishonest.
The ASSU Constitution requires that
"the title of the proposed amendment, the
dates of the ratification election and a state
ment explaining how to obtain a copy of the
text of the amendment shall be published in
The Stanford Daily at least seven days prior
to the election." The amendment informa
tion was published in the Feb. 9 and 10
issues of The Daily, so the information has
been available for about two months. The
election dates were published in advance of
campaign week. The Daily was very aware
of these facts before going to print.
Yesterday's editorial claims that the pro
posed Graduate Student Council has "little
constitutional protection ... as opposed to
the current system that governs the ASSIJ
Senate." In fact, the constitutional structure
of the proposed GSC is almost identical to
the existing senate, with dozens of protec
tive mechanisms ranging from quorum
requirements to recall measures. Also con
trary to a claim by The Daily, the current
senate and the (ISC' would both be gov
erned by bylaws that extend the constitu
tional protections, and provisions to change
them are identical.
The Daily falsely asserted that the ASSU
bylaws "require" that the ASSU make "a
concerted effort to find someone to write an
opposing statement." This appears nowhere
in the bylaws. Furthermore, they attribute
the (JSC's consensus decision-making pro
cess to the amendment, which is irrelevant
and misleading. Both the amendment and
bylaws require majority or supermajority
votes among elected members when con
sensus breaks down.
We hope that the readers of The Daily
understand that the irresponsible and
unethical handling of this issue by The
Daily's editors makes them an unreliable
source of information. We encourage read
ers to instead read the online election hand
book at http://election.stanford.edu, which
contains the amendment text, read the sum
mary in the printed election handbook, read
supporting information on the GSC Web
site at http://assu.stanford.edu/grad/, or to
contact their ASSIi senators for more infor
mation. It is unfortunate that The Daily, by
far the most efficient means of mass com
munication on this campus, has so thor
oughly discredited itself.

Election flyers have no message
More than likely, you have noticed the
multitudinous campaign flyers throughout
the campus. I find these flyers to be a
tremendous eyesore and a great source of
litter on our campus. They are nonetheless
perhaps a necessary evil, as much of Stan
ford's apolitical student body would other
wise remain oblivious to the upcoming elec
tions without them.
My main gripe is with the content — or
lack thereof—of these flyers. Although
there are a few meaningful flyers out there,
the majority of them say little, if anything,
about a candidate or the candidate's views.
In particular, I would like to bring atten
tion to a flyer I found not only particularly

empty but also offensive. Its caption reads
"Mike Sloan knows how to take care of
business" and is followed by a picture of
somebody, presumably the candidate, uri
nating on a Cal license plate.
I don't know what "business" is sup
posed to denote here (indeed, that knowl
edge would take care of half my objection),
but I do know that I found this photograph
offensive and degrading both to myself and
to UC-Berkeley — a fine institution deserv
ing praise rather than this debasement.
I do not wish to imply that I am against
our rivalry with Cal, but I believe our rival
ry should remain pure and should be limit
ed to the spheres of athletics and, to a
greater degree, academics. At the least, this
rivalry is not the grounds for a campaign
slogan, nor is public urination. Perhaps
Sloan does not know any better, but whoev
er took the photograph should.
I urge all Stanford students to consult
their election handbook and to visit the
online election handbook to get a better
idea of what, if anything, each candidate
stands for.

Senate candidate's reply
I write this in response to David Stein's
column, which appeared in yesterday's
Daily. The aphorism "Don't just a book by
its cover" fittingly applies to the ASSU Sen
ate campaign — one must remember to
peruse a book before making any substan
tial judgements on its content.
Though critics remark that my ASSU
senate campaign can be visually reduced to
the image of a yellow tennis ball, there are
certain ideas and ideals underlying that eye
catching icon. I rely on the Wilson tennis
ball to differentiate my campaign from the
rest, as does every other campaigner, and
such identification is necessary on a campus
flooded with election posters. However, my
political platform is also available to any
one, and I believe my fundamental goals are
realistic, practical and grounded.
I have approached the elections hand
book candidate statement, the discussion on
KZSIJ and the Senator Day activities with a
serious attitude and with unique objectives
of how I will use the Senate position to truly
make a difference for students on campus. I
know that many other candidates share my
seriousness.

Role of GSC was overlooked
We'd like to point out a glaring omission
from The Daily's otherwise helpful April 7
editorial regarding recent plans announced
by the University to increase subsidized
graduate student housing and graduate stu
dent stipends.
Yes, the University has begun taking
steps to address the housing crisis graduate
students are confronting. But this belated
initiative didn't arise solely through admin
istrative will.
The editorial juxtaposes The Daily's own
suggestion regarding housing from a year
ago and University Provost Condoleezza
Rice's recent announcement but fails to
mention one of the most important stimuli
for an aggressive approach toward graduate

housing. The Graduate Student Council, a
group of concerned graduate students
which currently functions as an adjunct of
the ASSU, organized a massive survey of
graduate student opinions on housing last
spring and spearheaded the huge Campout
on the Quad housing rally last May to bring
attention to the issue.
Perhaps more importantly, the GSC fol
lowed up on its initial actions by continual
ly pursuing the subject with administrators,
by keeping graduate students informed of
housing options, by offering valuable input
in decisions regarding stipends, new on
campus housing and off-campus leased
units and by quelling community opposition
to new construction by prompting many
graduate students to attend town meetings
hosted by the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission.
Make no mistake about it. The GSC has
been the most forceful advocate for more
graduate housing over the last year, and its
efforts have strongly influenced the Univer
sity's plans to address the remaining hous
ing shortage. The Daily was correct to
praise the administration for making efforts
to address the problem. But, to be fair, we
should realize that there is little evidence
these efforts would have been taken with
out the persuasive leadership of the GSC.

but have no legitimate reasons for doing so.

Daily's claims were irresponsible
The Daily's manipulation and invention
of facts in its attempts to defame the consti
tutional amendment yesterday were shock
ingly irresponsible and unethical. We will
try to undo the damage by explaining what
they have done.
Yesterday's front-page article accused
the ASSU of unconstitutional failure to
notify the public about the constitutional
amendment on the ASSU election ballot. If
The Daily had quoted the relevant section
of the ASSU Constitution, it would have
been extremely obvious to its readers that
all requirements of the constitution were
unambiguously met. The Daily's fabrication
of a front-page news article indicating oth
erwise was unambiguously dishonest.
The ASSU Constitution requires that
"the title of the proposed amendment, the
dates of the ratification election and a state
ment explaining how to obtain a copy of the
text of the amendment shall be published in
The Stanford Daily at least seven days prior
to the election." The amendment informa
tion was published in the Feb. 9 and 10
issues of The Daily, so the information has
been available for about two months. The
election dates were published in advance of
campaign week. The Daily was very aware
of these facts before going to print.
Yesterday's editorial claims that the pro
posed Graduate Student Council has "little
constitutional protection ... as opposed to
the current system that governs the ASSIJ
Senate." In fact, the constitutional structure
of the proposed GSC is almost identical to
the existing senate, with dozens of protec
tive mechanisms ranging from quorum
requirements to recall measures. Also con
trary to a claim by The Daily, the current
senate and the (ISC' would both be gov
erned by bylaws that extend the constitu
tional protections, and provisions to change
them are identical.
The Daily falsely asserted that the ASSU
bylaws "require" that the ASSU make "a
concerted effort to find someone to write an
opposing statement." This appears nowhere
in the bylaws. Furthermore, they attribute
the (JSC's consensus decision-making pro
cess to the amendment, which is irrelevant
and misleading. Both the amendment and
bylaws require majority or supermajority
votes among elected members when con
sensus breaks down.
We hope that the readers of The Daily
understand that the irresponsible and
unethical handling of this issue by The
Daily's editors makes them an unreliable
source of information. We encourage read
ers to instead read the online election hand
book at http://election.stanford.edu, which
contains the amendment text, read the sum
mary in the printed election handbook, read
supporting information on the GSC Web
site at http://assu.stanford.edu/grad/, or to
contact their ASSIi senators for more infor
mation. It is unfortunate that The Daily, by
far the most efficient means of mass com
munication on this campus, has so thor
oughly discredited itself.

Election flyers have no message
More than likely, you have noticed the
multitudinous campaign flyers throughout
the campus. I find these flyers to be a
tremendous eyesore and a great source of
litter on our campus. They are nonetheless
perhaps a necessary evil, as much of Stan
ford's apolitical student body would other
wise remain oblivious to the upcoming elec
tions without them.
My main gripe is with the content — or
lack thereof—of these flyers. Although
there are a few meaningful flyers out there,
the majority of them say little, if anything,
about a candidate or the candidate's views.
In particular, I would like to bring atten
tion to a flyer I found not only particularly

empty but also offensive. Its caption reads
"Mike Sloan knows how to take care of
business" and is followed by a picture of
somebody, presumably the candidate, uri
nating on a Cal license plate.
I don't know what "business" is sup
posed to denote here (indeed, that knowl
edge would take care of half my objection),
but I do know that I found this photograph
offensive and degrading both to myself and
to UC-Berkeley — a fine institution deserv
ing praise rather than this debasement.
I do not wish to imply that I am against
our rivalry with Cal, but I believe our rival
ry should remain pure and should be limit
ed to the spheres of athletics and, to a
greater degree, academics. At the least, this
rivalry is not the grounds for a campaign
slogan, nor is public urination. Perhaps
Sloan does not know any better, but whoev
er took the photograph should.
I urge all Stanford students to consult
their election handbook and to visit the
online election handbook to get a better
idea of what, if anything, each candidate
stands for.

Senate candidate's reply
I write this in response to David Stein's
column, which appeared in yesterday's
Daily. The aphorism "Don't just a book by
its cover" fittingly applies to the ASSU Sen
ate campaign — one must remember to
peruse a book before making any substan
tial judgements on its content.
Though critics remark that my ASSU
senate campaign can be visually reduced to
the image of a yellow tennis ball, there are
certain ideas and ideals underlying that eye
catching icon. I rely on the Wilson tennis
ball to differentiate my campaign from the
rest, as does every other campaigner, and
such identification is necessary on a campus
flooded with election posters. However, my
political platform is also available to any
one, and I believe my fundamental goals are
realistic, practical and grounded.
I have approached the elections hand
book candidate statement, the discussion on
KZSIJ and the Senator Day activities with a
serious attitude and with unique objectives
of how I will use the Senate position to truly
make a difference for students on campus. I
know that many other candidates share my
seriousness.

Role of GSC was overlooked
We'd like to point out a glaring omission
from The Daily's otherwise helpful April 7
editorial regarding recent plans announced
by the University to increase subsidized
graduate student housing and graduate stu
dent stipends.
Yes, the University has begun taking
steps to address the housing crisis graduate
students are confronting. But this belated
initiative didn't arise solely through admin
istrative will.
The editorial juxtaposes The Daily's own
suggestion regarding housing from a year
ago and University Provost Condoleezza
Rice's recent announcement but fails to
mention one of the most important stimuli
for an aggressive approach toward graduate

housing. The Graduate Student Council, a
group of concerned graduate students
which currently functions as an adjunct of
the ASSU, organized a massive survey of
graduate student opinions on housing last
spring and spearheaded the huge Campout
on the Quad housing rally last May to bring
attention to the issue.
Perhaps more importantly, the GSC fol
lowed up on its initial actions by continual
ly pursuing the subject with administrators,
by keeping graduate students informed of
housing options, by offering valuable input
in decisions regarding stipends, new on
campus housing and off-campus leased
units and by quelling community opposition
to new construction by prompting many
graduate students to attend town meetings
hosted by the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission.
Make no mistake about it. The GSC has
been the most forceful advocate for more
graduate housing over the last year, and its
efforts have strongly influenced the Univer
sity's plans to address the remaining hous
ing shortage. The Daily was correct to
praise the administration for making efforts
to address the problem. But, to be fair, we
should realize that there is little evidence
these efforts would have been taken with
out the persuasive leadership of the GSC.

Facilities not only part of learning
I am responding to the article "Med
School barely escapes probation" (April 6).
The quality of the outstanding basic sci
ence and clinical education at the School of
Medicine has been overshadowed by the
facilities debate. It needs to be broadcast
with clarity and emphasis: new facilities are
not equivalent to an outstanding medical
education.
And where are the radio, television and
newspaper interviews with seniors and
alumni? Alumni relate stories of the excel
lence of their medical education when com
pared to that of graduates of other medical
schools. These letters, personal correspon
dence and telephone calls are never report
ed because the news is "good."
When the medical library was built, it
reflected the attractiveness of open air.
Hooded light and courtyards of the golden
land of California. To me, this inherent
beauty and serenity remain. I love to read in
the library with an open door on a warm
summer afternoon, the sounds of birds, the
stillness surrounding the atrium.
The Fleischmann laboratories were
places where medical students conducted
experiments before curriculum reform
changed the paradigm and where students
of the era learned to perform the laborato
ry procedures they would carry out when
they became residents.
The "shining city on the hill" is where 1
strive to be when I teach and practice
medicine; the philosophy, ethics, motivation
and compassion of the people living in the
"city" outweigh its appearance.
Medical School Dean Eugene Bauer and
Senior Assoc. Dean Phyllis Gardner arc

changes in the structure, functionality and
educational evolution of our School; state

cians, student colleagues and alumni, all of
whom contribute to and have created our
"shining city."

Health decisions not easily judged
As the thoracic surgeon who treated
Erica Gielow after she was admitted to the
Stanford University Hospital, 1 was dis
mayed at your April 7 article criticizing the
physicians at the Cowell Student Health
Center.
Primary care physicians see an enormous
number of people with a variety of symp
toms that are often musculoskeletal in
nature and of no medical significance.
Ms. Gielow had symptoms of musculo
skeletal and pleuritic pain when she first vis
ited the Health Center. Her physical exam
did not show any decreased breath sounds
on either side that would have been a sign of
a collapsed lung. A collapsed lung, or a
pneumothorax, is a very rare occurrence in
the general population and is therefore not
the first diagnosis for a young person with
chest pain.
Asked to come back if the pain persisted,
she returned appropriately to the Health
Center after a few days when a chest X-ray
was ordered and the collapse was seen.
When she arrived at the hospital, she had
some chest pain but was not in any danger.
Young people with a pneumothorax will
quite often describe a past experience of
fleeting chest pain that was almost certainly
a previous episode of a collapse that was
never treated. Ms. Gielow's pain continued
because she had a persistent air leak in her
lung that occurs in about a quarter of
patients. It is these patients that usually
require a relatively minor operation to
repair the leak.
I believe that it is difficult and often dan
gerous to judge any medical situation with
out interviewing the treating physician
involved. Subspecialists at Stanford who see
patients in consultation referred to them by
the primary care providers at Cowell know
well the consistently high quality of medical
care this excellent group provides to Stan
ford students. It is unfortunate that critical
articles like this one fall far of the truth and
irresponsibly misrepresent an outstanding
Health Center.

Kyoto Protocol should he passed
Thomas Moore's April 10 letter to the
editor is misleading in many regards. He
asserts the Kyoto Protocol is a "bad" treaty
and lists several "facts" to support his argu
ment. The majority of scientists and policy
analysts who have carefully and objectively
looked at the Kyoto Protocol have conclud
ed the opposite,
Moore contends the Kyoto Protocol will
lead to layoffs, businesses closing and "dev
astating" impacts on certain industries. This
is absolutely not true.
Moore quotes the Department of Ener

gy to support his assertion. The DOE is so
obviously biased against the Protocol that
most of their analyses are utter nonsense.
The DOE reports purposefully excluded
consideration of market based compliance
schemes such as emission trading, joint
implementation and the clean development
mechanism that the Kyoto Protocol
employs.
For every DOE report predicting eco
nomic catastrophe, there are an equal num
ber of reports suggesting the Protocol will
produce a net economic gain for the United
States by making our industries more effi
cient.
The Kyoto Protocol will also produce
new jobs in areas such as energy efficiency,
cleaner technologies and monitoring and
verification technologies. Moore's "facts"
are cherry-picked, worst-case-scenarios.
Moore also cites the former head of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change as suggesting that the Kyoto Proto
col will have no impact on global warming.
Moore's suggestion is ridiculous.
The Kyoto Protocol requires the world's
industrialized countries to reduce green
house gas emissions substantially over a
baseline scenario. This will reduce the
amount of greenhouse gases that accurnu*
late in the atmosphere. This will be an
important first step toward slowing climate
change. Interestingly, the logical conclusion
from Moore's arguments is that the Kyoto
Protocol does not go far enough!
While many people agree that the Kyoto
Protocol is not strong enough, it is an
important first step. Importantly, the Kyoto
Protocol begins to harness market forces
toward combating global warming.
But Moore's assertion that global warm
ing will produce health benefits is by far his
most preposterous argument. By suggesting
that a warmer world is a healthier world
because doctors often recommend that sick
people move to more clement climates, Mr.
Moore's obvious bias is apparent.
Almost every peer-reviewed article on
the subject suggests that a warmer world
will lead to more diseases, more infections
and more cancers.
The White House has suggested that
global warming will possibly lead to 10,000
more deaths annually in the United States.
Moore's research that global warming will
reduce deaths by 40,(XX) annually in the
United States is silly. Have Moore's findings
been published in a peer-reviewed, scientif
ic article?
Will the Kyoto Protocol solve global
warming without any costs? Probably not.
Some industries will be affected. Con
sumers may pay a few cents more per gallon
at the gas pump. However, the public and
the scientific community largely support
this treaty.
It is a fair, efficient, affordable and
responsible action. Perhaps that is why
more than 1 (X) nations have signed the
treaty, and thousands of scientists and
economists are calling for its adoption.
As the world's largest producer of green
house gases, the United States must objec
tively look at the Protocol and decide
whether or not to ratify it. Without U.S. rat
ification, the treaty will not go into effect.
In today's complicated world, there is no
need for people or companies that manipu
late a complex issue to their advantage.

Trust will make new GSC work
I am writing in response to yesterday's
Daily editorial, "A Poor Foundation."
There is a great deal of unnecessary con
cern, worry and suspicion regarding the pro
posed constitutional amendment. The Daily
wrote that the new ASSU would "lack the
strong foundation and permanence that
constitutional foundations provide" and
seemed distrustful of a form of government
which "is so highly dependent on agreement
between [its] members." The Daily criti
cized the amendements' proponents —
which include a number of extremely
respected, hard-working and dedicated stu
dents who serve on both the graduate sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council
simultaneously —of proposing a govern
ment which is "convenient."
What seems to be missing from The
Daily's viewpoint is some trust in the ASSU
and some faith in Stanford students to
watch over their elected officials. The
ASSU Senate and the GSC exist to serve
students, and no matter what kind of struc
ture exists, the only real way to hold student
leaders accountable is to pay attention and
use good old-fashioned peer pressure.
Obviously, if we choose leaders who have
bad intentions and impossible dispositions,
any kind of structure can fail. On the other
hand, if we choose elected officials who are
dedicated to improving life at Stanford,
then the wrong kind of government struc
ture — one which burdens its members with
unnecessary formality and bureaucracy —
will certainly waste time, money, energy
and ideas.

Hut, as this year's GSC has proven, if we
implement the right kind of structure, we
can set the stage for dedicated leaders to
create real change and real progress.
A solid foundation is indeed necessary,
and the dedicated graduate senators and
GSC members have worked night and day
for the past several months to ensure that
the amendment and bylaws will provide for
this foundation well. Stanford students
should not be skeptical but instead look for
ward to a new ASSU with less red tape and
more results.

Daily Editorial was inaccurate
Although yesterday's Daily editorial
attacking the proposed constitutional
amendment claimed that the Editorial
Board had "scrutiniz[ed] pages of material
and deliberated] for hours," the shoddy
reasoning and gross factual errors found
within it raise doubts that they even both
ered to read the current ASSU Constitu
tion, let alone the proposed changes to it.
The editorial claims, "The proposed sys
tem allows for both the creation and
destruction of bylaws at any time based
solely on the two-thirds vote of those GSC
members present."
Of course, it fails to note that this is
exactly the same procedure as the current
system: "The bylaws of the Association may
be amended at a regular meeting of the Sen
ate by a vote of two-thirds of the members

present and voting...The Daily must be
using a peculiar form of logic if a feature is
good under the current system, but trans
muted to "bad" when preserved in the
amendment.
After one clears away this and similar
misrepresentations, one sees that The Daily
has no real arguments against the amend
ment. Even the editorial admits as much.
"Perhaps there is a new system of govern
ment yet to be implemented that would
combine the strong points of both types of
government." And perhaps the moon will
fall out of the sky tomorrow. The Daily
gives no indication of what such a hypothe
sized system might be. contenting itself with
mouthing vague platitudes like "govern
ment must adhere to strict guidelines".
What do they mean by this? Who knows?
One would have thought that one of the
"strict guidelines" to which government
should adhere is that it should represent the
people it claims to serve. And even The
Daily concedes that the current system fails
to do so for the majority of students at Stan
ford.
The facts of the matter are this: the cur
rent system does not work for graduate stu
dents and never has worked. One can go
back over 30 years and see that graduate
issues have never been addressed within the
framework of the ASSU. Over the past
three years, the GSC has constructed the
first working graduate government in the
history of student government at Stanford.
All of The Daily's irresponsible and unethi
cal omissions cannot change this simple fact:
the GSC works for graduate students. The
Daily is reduced to arguing that the students

at Stanford should wait for the sake of wait
ing, while trying to argue that features that
are the same between the current and pro
posed new systems are somehow only bad
under the new one. This is the last, desper
ate cry of those who wish to kill a good idea
but have no legitimate reasons for doing so.
I encourage everyone who votes to ignore
The Daily's empty, meaningless ravings and
cast a vote in favor of "An ASSU For All

Moore contends the Kyoto Protocol will
lead to layoffs, businesses closing and "dev
astating" impacts on certain industries. This
is absolutely not true.
Moore quotes the Department of Ener

gy to support his assertion. The DOE is so
obviously biased against the Protocol that
most of their analyses are utter nonsense.
The DOE reports purposefully excluded
consideration of market based compliance
schemes such as emission trading, joint
implementation and the clean development
mechanism that the Kyoto Protocol
employs.
For every DOE report predicting eco
nomic catastrophe, there are an equal num
ber of reports suggesting the Protocol will
produce a net economic gain for the United
States by making our industries more effi
cient.
The Kyoto Protocol will also produce
new jobs in areas such as energy efficiency,
cleaner technologies and monitoring and
verification technologies. Moore's "facts"
are cherry-picked, worst-case-scenarios.
Moore also cites the former head of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change as suggesting that the Kyoto Proto
col will have no impact on global warming.
Moore's suggestion is ridiculous.
The Kyoto Protocol requires the world's
industrialized countries to reduce green
house gas emissions substantially over a
baseline scenario. This will reduce the
amount of greenhouse gases that accurnu*
late in the atmosphere. This will be an
important first step toward slowing climate
change. Interestingly, the logical conclusion
from Moore's arguments is that the Kyoto
Protocol does not go far enough!
While many people agree that the Kyoto
Protocol is not strong enough, it is an
important first step. Importantly, the Kyoto
Protocol begins to harness market forces
toward combating global warming.
But Moore's assertion that global warm
ing will produce health benefits is by far his
most preposterous argument. By suggesting
that a warmer world is a healthier world
because doctors often recommend that sick
people move to more clement climates, Mr.
Moore's obvious bias is apparent.
Almost every peer-reviewed article on
the subject suggests that a warmer world
will lead to more diseases, more infections
and more cancers.
The White House has suggested that
global warming will possibly lead to 10,000
more deaths annually in the United States.
Moore's research that global warming will
reduce deaths by 40,(XX) annually in the
United States is silly. Have Moore's findings
been published in a peer-reviewed, scientif
ic article?
Will the Kyoto Protocol solve global
warming without any costs? Probably not.
Some industries will be affected. Con
sumers may pay a few cents more per gallon
at the gas pump. However, the public and
the scientific community largely support
this treaty.
It is a fair, efficient, affordable and
responsible action. Perhaps that is why
more than 1 (X) nations have signed the
treaty, and thousands of scientists and
economists are calling for its adoption.
As the world's largest producer of green
house gases, the United States must objec
tively look at the Protocol and decide
whether or not to ratify it. Without U.S. rat
ification, the treaty will not go into effect.
In today's complicated world, there is no
need for people or companies that manipu
late a complex issue to their advantage.
