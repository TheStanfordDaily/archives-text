Trust will make new GSC work
I am writing in response to yesterday's
Daily editorial, "A Poor Foundation."
There is a great deal of unnecessary con
cern, worry and suspicion regarding the pro
posed constitutional amendment. The Daily
wrote that the new ASSU would "lack the
strong foundation and permanence that
constitutional foundations provide" and
seemed distrustful of a form of government
which "is so highly dependent on agreement
between [its] members." The Daily criti
cized the amendements' proponents —
which include a number of extremely
respected, hard-working and dedicated stu
dents who serve on both the graduate sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council
simultaneously —of proposing a govern
ment which is "convenient."
What seems to be missing from The
Daily's viewpoint is some trust in the ASSU
and some faith in Stanford students to
watch over their elected officials. The
ASSU Senate and the GSC exist to serve
students, and no matter what kind of struc
ture exists, the only real way to hold student
leaders accountable is to pay attention and
use good old-fashioned peer pressure.
Obviously, if we choose leaders who have
bad intentions and impossible dispositions,
any kind of structure can fail. On the other
hand, if we choose elected officials who are
dedicated to improving life at Stanford,
then the wrong kind of government struc
ture — one which burdens its members with
unnecessary formality and bureaucracy —
will certainly waste time, money, energy
and ideas.

Hut, as this year's GSC has proven, if we
implement the right kind of structure, we
can set the stage for dedicated leaders to
create real change and real progress.
A solid foundation is indeed necessary,
and the dedicated graduate senators and
GSC members have worked night and day
for the past several months to ensure that
the amendment and bylaws will provide for
this foundation well. Stanford students
should not be skeptical but instead look for
ward to a new ASSU with less red tape and
more results.

Daily Editorial was inaccurate
Although yesterday's Daily editorial
attacking the proposed constitutional
amendment claimed that the Editorial
Board had "scrutiniz[ed] pages of material
and deliberated] for hours," the shoddy
reasoning and gross factual errors found
within it raise doubts that they even both
ered to read the current ASSU Constitu
tion, let alone the proposed changes to it.
The editorial claims, "The proposed sys
tem allows for both the creation and
destruction of bylaws at any time based
solely on the two-thirds vote of those GSC
members present."
Of course, it fails to note that this is
exactly the same procedure as the current
system: "The bylaws of the Association may
be amended at a regular meeting of the Sen
ate by a vote of two-thirds of the members

present and voting...The Daily must be
using a peculiar form of logic if a feature is
good under the current system, but trans
muted to "bad" when preserved in the
amendment.
After one clears away this and similar
misrepresentations, one sees that The Daily
has no real arguments against the amend
ment. Even the editorial admits as much.
"Perhaps there is a new system of govern
ment yet to be implemented that would
combine the strong points of both types of
government." And perhaps the moon will
fall out of the sky tomorrow. The Daily
gives no indication of what such a hypothe
sized system might be. contenting itself with
mouthing vague platitudes like "govern
ment must adhere to strict guidelines".
What do they mean by this? Who knows?
One would have thought that one of the
"strict guidelines" to which government
should adhere is that it should represent the
people it claims to serve. And even The
Daily concedes that the current system fails
to do so for the majority of students at Stan
ford.
The facts of the matter are this: the cur
rent system does not work for graduate stu
dents and never has worked. One can go
back over 30 years and see that graduate
issues have never been addressed within the
framework of the ASSU. Over the past
three years, the GSC has constructed the
first working graduate government in the
history of student government at Stanford.
All of The Daily's irresponsible and unethi
cal omissions cannot change this simple fact:
the GSC works for graduate students. The
Daily is reduced to arguing that the students

at Stanford should wait for the sake of wait
ing, while trying to argue that features that
are the same between the current and pro
posed new systems are somehow only bad
under the new one. This is the last, desper
ate cry of those who wish to kill a good idea
but have no legitimate reasons for doing so.
I encourage everyone who votes to ignore
The Daily's empty, meaningless ravings and
cast a vote in favor of "An ASSU For All
Students."

Daily's claims were irresponsible
The Daily's manipulation and invention
of facts in its attempts to defame the consti
tutional amendment yesterday were shock
ingly irresponsible and unethical. We will
try to undo the damage by explaining what
they have done.
Yesterday's front-page article accused
the ASSU of unconstitutional failure to
notify the public about the constitutional
amendment on the ASSU election ballot. If
The Daily had quoted the relevant section
of the ASSU Constitution, it would have
been extremely obvious to its readers that
all requirements of the constitution were
unambiguously met. The Daily's fabrication
of a front-page news article indicating oth
erwise was unambiguously dishonest.
The ASSU Constitution requires that
"the title of the proposed amendment, the
