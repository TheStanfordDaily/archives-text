# ENDORSEMENTS
## Special-fee requests 
### 
In an effort to make informed special-fee
endorsements, members of The Daily's Edi
torial Hoard spent numerous hours during
the past week reviewing the budgets and
ASSU Elections Handbook statements sub
mitted by student groups requesting special
fees to the ASSU. Whenever possible, the
members of the editorial board met with
representatives of each group and asked
them about the group's goals, its accom
plishments during the past year, plans for
expansion or improvement in the coming
academic year and how special-fee funds
woidd be spent.
Based on the submitted information and
interview discussions, the board reached a
unanimous endorsement decision for each
group. The board has tried to include as
much information about each group as pos
sible in the explanation of its endorsements.
But The Daily encourages all students to
obtain a copy of the ASSU Elections Hand
book and read each group's statement and
budget to reach their own conclusions.
AS NOTED IN the evaluation cri
teria editorial published on March
30, The Daily has rated each stu
dent group on a 1 to 5 scale that assesses
the group's effectiveness and its value.
In evaluating the groups, the editorial
board closely examined the achievements
of the fee groups during the past year and
the viability of the group's plans for the
upcoming year.
Student groups that are requesting a
special fee for the first time were evaluated
on their expected effectiveness and value
as set forth in their proposals and presenta
tions, as well as the viability of their plans
for the coming year.
Below is an explanation of the 1 to 5 rat
ing scale that was used as a composite score
for a group's effectiveness and value.
5 — Group successfully met all goals set
out during the previous year, has a strong
sense of its constituency and an overarch
ing vision for the organization. Group's
activities are a valuable component of stu
dent life on campus and fulfill a need that
would otherwise go unmet. Has a viable
plan of activities for the coming year and
has clear goals for improving on itself and
putting its funds to efficient and effective
use.
Returning Groups
Alternative $17,565.00
Spring Break (UO $2.68)
®®© 0 ©
Alternative Spring Break takes 130 students
along for what many regard as their most pow
erful experience at Stanford. With more students
applying than can be accommodated, the pro
gram is growing quickly and included 11 trips
this year.
New developments this year included a
Native Hawaiian issues trip and last year, sever
al students who had returned from the Chil
dren's Issues trip helped form Stanford Advo
cates for Children.
With sound financial management, the small
increase over last year's special fee that ASB
requests seems justified, especially in light of
extensive fundraising efforts at the Stanford
Fund, which may be reduced next year because
of competition from other groups.
Asian American $28,107.00
Students (UO $4.29)
Association
®©© 0 ©
The Asian American Students Association
serves as an umbrella organization for Asian
and Pacific Islander groups on campus, funding
12 of them. Through a wide variety of events, its
programming benefits both its own members
and the campus as a whole.
This year, AASA has worked hard to keep its
budget down — increasing its fee request from
1998-99 by less than 1 percent — and has
shown a good understanding of its constituancy
by excluding a graduate-student-focused group
from under its umbrella.
ASSU Legal $91,487.00
Counseling Office (B $6.78)
®©© © ©
The Legal Counseling Office provides an
invaluable service to students in need of legal
assistance who do not have the resources to
solicit assistance on their own from private attor
neys. Students can meet with professional attor
neys for answers to their legal questions and
advice on how to go about pursuing a legal
action. A campus without a Legal Counseling
Office would leave students with little or no on
campus resources for such assistance.

4 — Group has successfully fulfilled
almost all goals set during the previous
year and knows whom it is serving.
Group's activities are a valuable contri
bution to the Stanford community that
would be missed if absent. Group's plan
for the upcoming year is viable and
includes efforts to fulfill unmet goals and
use its funds effectively.
3 — Group has fulfilled many of its goals
and its plan for the upcoming year
reflects an effort to fulfill unmet goals
and achieve improvement. Group's activ
ities are a value to the Stanford commu
nity.
2 — Group has met few of the previous
year's goals. Plan for the upcoming year
does not clearly reflect effort to fulfill
unmet goals or does not seem viable.
Group's sense of its constituency is hazy
and its ability to effectively and efficient
ly use funds is unclear, even though the
group's activities could be of value to stu
dents.
I — Group has met no goals and has not
proven its value to the student popula
tion. Group's ability to use funds effec
tively and efficiently is questionable.
The individual fee group summaries
below aim to convey the group's accom
plishments during the year and its plans
for the coming year.
Annual cost per student is indicated in
parentheses under the group's gross fee
request amount. The per capita amounts
are taken directly from the ASSU Elec
tions Handbook. A "B" prior to the
amount indicates the fee will be assessed
to both undergraduate and graduate stu
dents; a "UO" indicates the fee will be
assessed to undergraduates only.
The Daily welcomes responses to its
endorsements from groups or students.
Letters will be published tomorrow and
Thursday on a space-available basis. Only
those letters received by 3 p.m. today will
be considered for publication tomorrow.
Letters for Thursday publication must be
received by 3 p.m. tomorrow.
Please submit letters via e-mail
addressed to letters@daily.stanford.edu.
ASSU Speakers $120,616.00
Bureau (B $8.94)
®®© 0 ©
So far this year the Speakers Bureau has
brought U.N. Ambassador nominee Richard
Holbrooke, Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Nor
man Mailer and former White House Press Sec
retary Dee Dee Myers.
Plans for the rest of the year include actor
Danny Glover. The Speakers Bureau has also
co-sponsored events with numerous other cam
pus groups, including the Women's Center,
OutLaw and the Black Community Services
Center.
Free lectures by world-renowned figures
provide the Stanford community a wonderful
opportunity to hear from a variety of thinkers.
The Speakers Bureau has done a good job
finding timely and relevant speakers for cam
pus.
Barrio $21,527.65
Assistance (UO $3.29)
®©© ® ©
This group's tutoring services are valuable to
both the community it serves and the students
participating, and the group has a solid financial
history.
However, the group's budgets for the last
several years have all come almost entirely from
its special fee, and this year's budget continues
the pattern. Efforts to seek outside funding
should be given more attention so that the orga
nization can reduce its dependence on support
from the student body.
Black $22,045.00
Student Union $(UO $3.37)
®©© 0 ©
The broad spectrum of programs offered by
the Black Student Union, an organization dedi
cated to promoting issues and concerns of
black students at Stanford, continue to benefit
Stanford and the surrounding community.
The BSU strongly serves its constituents by
funding Black Liberation Month, sponsoring
Kwanza celebrations and coordinating events
with local high school students.
The group has stepped up its efforts to raise
money through the Stanford Fund but continues
to rely on that revenue as its only funding source
outside of special fee.

Club Sports $155,067.00
(B $11.49)
(D © © © ©
The Club Sports program provides hundreds
of students the opportunity to be a part of 16 dif
ferent teams, including ice hockey and equestri
an. The program funds team equipment, facilities
rentals and maintenance and team travel. All
members also pay mandatory dues.
The increase in special-fee request is the
result of rising costs for equipment and facilities
rentals that the Club Sports program cannot
avoid. The umbrella organization maintains
strong oversight on the budgets of individual
teams, providing for a streamlined spending pro
posal.
International $9,110.28
Undergraduate (UO $1.39
Community
(D © © ® ©
The orientation for incoming international stu
dents is a much-needed sen/ice that gets no Uni
versity funding, and this is where much of the
group's special fee goes. The rest gives the stu
dent body a return on its investment in the form
of internationally themed programming held
throughout the year.
Given the group's significant expenses
(including feeding international students for the
several days they are on campus before Dining
Services opens), it keeps its costs remarkably
low.
KZSU $48,443
(B $7.45)
©©© © ©
KZSU serves many functions on campus,
broadcasting athletic events, offering a wide
range of music that isn't heard on commercial
radio stations and providing a training ground for
students interested in learning about radio
broadcasting.
KZSU has been successful at findng outside
sponsors to underwrite portions of its broadcasts
and has streamlined its budget substantially after
losing its special fee three years ago.
The station also serves as the official source
for University emergency information.
MEChA $31,075.00
(UO $4.74)
©©® © ©
MEChA continues to improve its organization
in serving the Chicano / Latino students on cam
pus. The group sponsors celebrations for El Dia
de Los Muertos, Cinco de Mayo and the Cesar
Chavez Commemoration, among other events.
An umbrella organization, MEChA has upped
its supervision over its member groups and
seems to have a growing understanding of the
students it serves. An 11.1 percent increase from
last year's fee request is high but not too con
cerning.
Mind's Eye $13,146.00
(UO $2.01)
®©© © ©
Stanford does not suffer from a lack of many
things, but artistic opportunities for students may
be one of them. The Mind's Eye is the only pub
lication of its kind at Stanford, and fills an other
wise gaping hole in Stanford cultural life.
This year, The Mind's Eye was able to
increase its circulation while continuing to be free
to Stanford students in dorm lounges and dining
halls. It featured a newly colorful cover and again
received far more student submissions than
could be printed.
The difficulty in selling advertisements for an
artistic publication represents much of the need
for the special fee.
Project Motivation $7,186.00
(UO $1.10)
®©© © ©
Project Motivation has the goal of encourag
ing underprivileged youth to pursue higher edu
cation.
Each year, they work with more than 1,400
high school students throughout California and
other western states. In the past, the organization
has worked in conjunction with the Office of
Undergraduate Admission and with the coordi
nators of Admit Weekend.
Known as Pro Mo, this organization's special
fee request is a bargain for the valuable service it
provides to the community. The group continues
to work at finding alternative sources of funding.
Perhaps the group might pursue other sources
of support, particularly on-campus, or work more
closely with other groups in augmenting its func
tion.
In its current form, Project Motivation is an
asset to the community and deserving of a spe
cial fee.
SCBN $21,909.00
(B $1.62)
®©© © ©
SCBN's programming is integral to the Stan
ford community, providing a forum for student
creative expression, free movie showings in the
form of Tele Flicks arid training for students inter
ested in learning about television production.
The station has used its funds wisely and effi
ciently to purchase capital equipment necessary
for smoother operations.
For next year, the station plans to purchase a
lighting system and a digital editing program and
pay a daily programmer — innovations which will
improve the quality of the station's shows and its
broadcast.

Stanford American $29,465.00
Indian Organization (UO $4.50)
® © © © ©
An umbrella group for Stanford's American
Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian com
munities, SAIO is most notable for sponsoring
the Stanford Powwow, which brings 35,000 peo
ple annually to Stanford. In addition, it coordi
nates a dozen groups that cater to all parts of the
SAIO community.
SAIO has continued in the past year to run a
tight budget and carefully add new events to its
existing agenda. Next year's budget includes
$15,000 in outside fundraising, one-third of the
group's total.
Stanford Axe $10,500.00
Committee (UO $3.37)
® © © ® ©
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded to
maintain the traditions of the University and its
Athletics Department. Part of its responsibilities
include annual Big Game Week activities and the
protection of the Axe when it is on campus.
The group relies entirely on its special fee for
operation but has made little effort at raising
funds on its own. It has turned down offers to be
funded and integrated into the Athletics Depart
ment. Axe Comm also receives funds for working
at Flicks but does not appear to have used these
funds to offset the special-fee cost. Further, the
group continues to be stuck on the issue of the
Bonfire at Lake Lagunita and should be working
harder to find something else. In short, the group
appears disorganized.
At this point, Stanford Axe Comm is not a wise
investment for the community as a whole, and it
may need a year to regroup.
Stanford Band $57,130.00
(LSJUMB) (UO $8.72)
® © © © ©
The Leland Stanford Junior (pause) Universi
ty Marching Band is a Stanford institution. With
out its special fee, it would have trouble even
existing, and there are few students on this cam
pus who do not derive some benefit from the
band at sporting events, campus rallies or par
ties.
Despite moving to a temporary home and
ever-increasing membership numbers, the Band
has admirably kept its expenses in check. The
Band is one of the most effective special-fee
groups on the ballot this year.
The Stanford $17,234.00
Chaparral (UO $2.63)
® © © 0 ©
Rapidly approaching its 100 th year, The Stan
ford Chaparral has been a part of campus life
since the beginning and is one of the oldest col
lege humor magazines in the region.
The Chappie has worked diligently at
improvement over the past year, increasing its
staff size and the number of quality issues pub
lished during the year. It has also made a con
certed effort at increasing advertising revenue to
decrease the amount which it relies on its special
fee. It will continue to make these improvements
and efforts at cutting costs over the coming year
and is a worthwhile investment for the Stanford
community.
Stanford $6,196.00
Community (UO $0.95)
Carnival
© © © 0 ©
Each year the Stanford Community Carnival
puts together a free day of fun and games for
local elementary school children. The Carnival
works hard to stretch its special-fee dollars get
ting discounts on booth rentals and donations of
food and prizes. The entertainment is provided
by Stanford students, from the dorm members
who staff the game booths to student teams and
groups who perform for the kids.
Community Carnival is conscious of the need
to make the Carnival attractive for kids while uti
lizing community funding sources and involving
dorms who wish to donate and volunteer at the
Carnival. It has also shown fiscal responsiblity
with a zero percent increase in its special fee
request.
Stanford Concert $63,557.00
Network (B $4.71)
© © © 0 ©
The Concert Network allowed the Stanford
community to see a diverse array of perfor
mances for severely reduced or free admission
rates. This year alone, the campus has witnessed
performances by blues legend John Lee Hooker,
Digital Underground and an upcoming live Love
Line show in Frost Ampitheater. Additionally, it
organized a Coffee House Live series with local
artists and has plans for White Plaza shows
throughout the rest of Spring Quarter.
The organization has built credibility with
event organizers and has shown initiative in
working toward a live show in Frost Ampitheater.
Stanford Film $32,855.00
Society (UO $5.02)
© © © © ©
This group has expanded significantly
through special fee funding in the last two years
and now has a strong presence on campus
through film screenings, speakers and work
shops, filling the void left by lack of an under
graduate film studies curriculum. Its operating
budget is quite large, though, with only a small
fraction not coming from special fees.
The group should reduce costs and I or seek

more outside funding rather than continuing to
rely on such generous contributions from the
student body.
Stanford in $22,608.00
Government (UO $3.45)
CD © © © ©
Stanford in Government provides resources
and services to students interested in public
policy and to the campus as a whole.
SIG continues to expand its services while
seeking external sources for fundraising. Only
one-quarter of SlG's total budget comes from its
special fee, and the amount being requested is
down from last year's request. Most of the spe
cial fee will go towards the organization's oper
ating budget.
Students can expect more from SIG without
additional cost. It continues to be a wise choice
for students.
Stanford Jazz $19,400.00
Orchestra (UO $2.96)
(D © © ® (D
The Jazz Orchestra has a solid program
which contributes significantly to the campus
artistic community, and it operates without sup
port from the Music Department. However, it
spends a significant portion of its funds on hir
ing outside musicians to play in its concerts.
The price of including these musicians is prob
ably disproportionate to the benefit offered to
audiences, and there is the further concern that
students who fund these guests through special
fees are still required to pay admission to the
concerts.
Stanford Project $4,615.00
on Nutrition (UO $0.70)
(SPOON)
(D (D (D © ©
SPOON tries to alleviate hunger in commu
nities around Stanford by collecting leftover
food from dorm dining halls and distributing it to
food shelters. Although a new Dining Services
policy this fall hindered the organization's ability
to pick up leftovers at University-operated din
ing halls, SPOON successfully negotiated with
Dining Services and resumed pick-ups winter
quarter. SPOON also sponsors a Hunger
Awareness Week during spring quarter and this
year will be having its first Hunger Awareness
Concert. It also helps other schools start similar
programs. This year's request increased by
only $5.
Stanford Solar $30,801.00
Car Project (UO $4.70)
® © © ® ©
The Stanford Solar Car Project has been
< > i i !
building solar vehicles and competing in races
around the world for almost 10 years. The stu
dent-run organization is in the process of con
structing a new car, the Third Degree Burner,
which will run in Sunrayce '99 this June.
The project has been very successful at
receiving donations of materials and resources
for its projects, which help defray some of the
special-fee costs. However, since more than 60
percent of its total budget is based on the spe
cial fee, the project is still highly dependent on
its special fee. Further, while the project may be
beneficial to its members, the portion of the
population that it serves is small.
Stanford Women's $25,788.00
Coalition (UO $3.94)
® © © ® ©
The Women's Coalition is a model umbrella
group, one with clearly set goals, a well-orga
nized budget and an excellent understanding of
purpose and constituency. It coordinates and
supports such groups as Herstory, Coalition
Against Sexual Assault and Womenspeak and
spends the bulk of its money bringing high
quality speakers to campus.
The group stands out for its fiscal vigilance,
having cut off a group last year for inefficiency,
and its willingness to take new groups — such
as Stanford Asian Women, previously funded
by AASA — under its wing.
Students for $8,079.71
Environmental (UO $1.23)
Action at Stanford (SEAS)
® © © © ©
SEAS lobbies for issues of environmental
justice, promoting campus awareness of topics
such as investment responsibility and environ
mental racism. In the past year, some of the
group's activities have involved production of
the Disorientation Guide and the Daily Planet
newsletter for dorm bathroom stalls. It provides
tours of East Palo Alto that show how close toxic
dump sites are to residences.
SEAS is requesting a modest fee to assist in
bringing speakers to campus and maintaining
its operations.
New Groups
Alternative $12,965.00
Medicine (U051.98)
© © © ® ©
Alternative Medicine is a new fee group
formed to design quarterly teaching series on
alternative medicine. Each of the series would
culminate in a workshop on some aspect of
alternative medicine led by a field professional.
While we believe there may be a niche for
such programming, the group ought to have a
trial program and explore other funding
