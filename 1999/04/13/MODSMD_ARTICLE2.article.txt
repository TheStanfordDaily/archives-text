The Women's Center presented
the inaugural Achievement in
Women's Leadership Awards at a
brunch held Sunday at the center.
The awards were designed to rec
ognize women leaders and women's
groups that have worked to raise
consciousness about women's issues,
empower women to action and bet
ter the quality of life for women on
campus.
"We're trying to get voices heard
through this," said Florence Nocar, a
sophomore and volunteer coordina
tor at the center. "A collection of
people like this lets you know that
there are others working just as hard
as you for the same causes, and it
gives you recognition and support."
About 50 people, including stu
dents and faculty, attended the

event, funded by Assoc. Dean of
Students Morris Graves's office and
the Women's Coalition. Students,
student organizations, faculty and
staff were honored.
Senior Cathy Rion received the
undergraduate leadership award.
She helped lobby the University for
a full-time director at the Women's
Center.
"Many people have worked on
this, but she wrote a lengthy propos
al to the administration outlining the
position and her recommenda
tions," Women's Center Director
Fabienne McPhail said. Before the
University allocated funding for a
full-time director earlier this year,
McPhail's position at the center was
half-time.
"It's amazing how far we've come

in the past four years, and I'm so
happy to have a center that has re
sources. At the same time I wish that
there would be more people who
could fight in a political way to cre
ate change. That's something that's
still missing. There are still things to
do," Rion said.
The graduate leadership award
went to Venus Opal Reese, a second
year drama graduate student, who
has worked with undergraduates to
encourage their interest in art.
Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and
Saheli, the South Asian women's
group on campus, received the
sorority and student group leader
ship awards, respectively.
"We don't do service thinking
we'll get awards, so when you [win
awards] it's an honor," said sopho
more Nicoli Richardson, a member
of AKA sorority.
Nadinne Cruz, associate director
of the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, won the staff award, while Asst.
Spanish and Portuguese Prof. Claire
Fox won the Junior Faculty Award.
The Senior Faculty Award went

to Assoc. Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Sheri Sheppard, along with
mechanical engineering doctoral
students Adela Ben-Yakar, Judy Se
gura and Catherine Rose.
"They initiated and wrote the
curriculum lor the first class in the
engineering department focusing on
women's perspectives," McPhail
said. Ben-Yakar. Segura and Rose
served on the organizing committee
for the mechanical engineering
graduate seminar with Sheppard.
A committee of students and
staff chose the 10 recipients from a
list of 30 nominees. Because the
awards are in their first year, there
were no established criteria forjudg
ing the nominees. This gave the
committee a chance to explore the
diversity of women's effect on cam
pus as well as the nature of being a
women's leader in that arena.
"Deciding the awards was a real
ly fun process, since we discussed at
length what determines a woman
leader, since the impact is so differ
ent," McPhail said. "What does it
take to be a leader? In a women's
community, it's about watching
older women and how they deal with
conflict and applying that to your
leadership style."
