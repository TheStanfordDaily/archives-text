The No. 2 Stanford women's

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
â–  Friday-Sunday: No. 2 Stanford
(18-5) finished fourth in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
Championships.
This was an unexpected finish
for the Cardinal, who entered the
tournament as the second seed.
The team started off the weekend
extremely well, beating No. 14 Pa
cific (6-18) 10-2 and No. 5 UC-
Santa Barbara (10-14) 8-1 on Fri
day and then going on to beat No.
8 San Diego State (19-12) 8-4 on
Saturday.
In the first three games, "no
one could really score on us," said
head coach John Tanner.
"Against San Diego State, the
score was 7-0 at half. We had com
plete control of game."
San Diego State is a solid team
and managed to upset No. 3 Cali
fornia last month. On Sunday, the
Cal team upset top-ranked USC in
the finals of the MPSF tourna
ment to take home its first-ever
conference title while proving that
any of the top four teams are ca
pable of taking home the national
title this May.
"It was disappointing," said
sophomore Kris Koblik. "But this

will fire us up for the rest of the
season."
The Cardinal will face these
same teams at National Qualifiers
in two weeks and then at Nation
als in May.
Stanford defeated the Golden
Bears the last two of the teams'
previous three meetings, but Sat
urday the Cardinal was unable to
continue that trend. The Bears
beat the Cardinal 5-3 in a very sta
tic game.
"Driving creates chaos and sets
up opportunities for shooters on
the perimeter as well in hole-set,"
said junior Elissa Keszler. "The
perimeter players weren't posing
a threat for the defense, so they
just dropped back on our hole
sets. Our offense played right into
their defense."
Sophomore Kelly Shouey
scored the first goal against the
Bears, but Cal returned with two
goals of its own in the first quarter
and held its lead for the duration
of the game.
The urgency of the Cardinal's
situation was not recognized until
the fourth quarter, and by then it
was too late to regain control of
the game.
Sophomores Anne-Marie
Keenan and Dani Bell also scored
for the Cardinal and senior cap
tain Heather Crary had an impres
sive seven saves.
The Cardinal regained its com
posure and came out hard for the
consolation finals against No. 4
UCLA on Sunday. The Bruins
scored two goals almost immedi
ately but sophomore Hilary Gal-
logly soon got Stanford on the
board and freshman Margie Din
geldein followed with three con
secutive goals to spot Stanford a 4-
2 lead. The Bruins tied the score at!
four and after sophomore Kris
Koblik tallied, UCLA returned,
with two more goals.
UCLA led 6-5 going into the
fourth quarter and Dingeldein
managed to score two of her shots
in the final two minutes, sending
the game into overtime.
The Cardinal was unable to
convert any of its scoring opportu
nities during the post-regulation
play and UCLA's final goal earned
the Bruins a third-place finish in
the tournament.
Crary managed an incredible 10
saves in this game alone, and Din-'
geldein's 11 goals throughout the
tournament, a bright spot for the
Cardinal, earned her a spot on the
MPSF All-Tournament First
Team.
The Cardinal takes on UC-
Davis in its final home game this
Friday at 4 p.m.
