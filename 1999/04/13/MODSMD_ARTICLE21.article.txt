The No. 9 men's tennis team will
try to build on the momentum it
gained from last weekend's sweep of
the Arizona schools when it takes on
Pepperdine this afternoon at the

Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
Today's match begins the most diffi
cult and important week of tennis
for the Cardinal thus far this season.
After today's match against Pep
perdine, the Cardinal (15-2) will
take on USC and UCLA over the
weekend. The team knows, howev

er, that it cannot afford to overlook
the No. 17 Waves (12-3).
"Pepperdine has consistently
been ranked between 10 and 15 all
year and they will come ready to
play," said head coach Dick Gould.
"This is a very tough match for us
and one that we have to come readv

for. They are about at the level of an
Arizona State or USC and that
means every match should he close."
The Cardinal comes into today's
match with a healthy lineup anda lot
of positive energy. All of the players
are pleased with how they are play
ing and where the team stands at this
point in the year.
