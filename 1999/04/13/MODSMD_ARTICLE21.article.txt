take on USC and UCLA over the

"Pepperdine has consistently
been ranked between 10 and 15 all
year and they will come ready to
play," said head coach Dick Gould.
"This is a very tough match for us
and one that we have to come readv

for. They are about at the level of an
Arizona State or USC and that
means every match should he close."

match with a healthy lineup anda lot
of positive energy. All of the players

for us to get sharper and gain more
confidence," said sophomore Scotty
Scott. "We know our ultimate goal is
to be at the top of our games in May
for [Nationals], hut each match
needs to be a stepping stone. This
will be a very important week of ten

the top teams in the nation."

for most of the season, but over the
last few matches it finally looks like
all three of its doubles teams are
coming together.
"Doubles are so important late in
the season because getting that
point just takes a little bit of pressure
off each singles match," senior Ryan
Wolters said. "Knowing you have to
win three singles as opposed to four
is a big difference. As for K.J. [Hip
pensteel) and myself, 1 think we are
back at the top of our games. We
started out really strong in the fall
and then went through a period
where we struggled a little hit. Late
ly we have been moving more and
being more aggressive at the net
which has helped our results."
In addition to Wolters and Hip
pensteel, junior Geoff Abrams and
sophomore Alex Kim have excelled
at the No. I spot.
Abrams and Kim were moved
from the No. 2 doubles team to the
top spot due to their consistently
strong play. They showed the ability
to come back late in a match this
past weekend against Arizona
State.
"The I Arizona State) match was
a big one for us because even though
we started off slowly we were able to
fight back and take the match,"
Abrams said.
"It is tough in doubles to be a
break down and have to battle back
but I think we are confident that we
are never out of any match."
