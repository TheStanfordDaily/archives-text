sophomore Stephanie Keever.

WOMEN'S GOLF
â–  Saturday-Sunday: No. 8 Stanford finshed second at the Peg Barnard Cali
fornia Collegiate tournament, Stanford Golf Course.
Keever captured the individual title at the Peg Barnard California Colle
giate tournament Saturday and Sunday at the Stanford Golf Course, leading
the Cardinal to a second-place finish.
Keever opened with a three-under-par 69 on the Cardinal's home eourse,
punctuated by a front-nine 33. The round gave her a one-stroke lead over
Oregon State's Kathleen Takaishi heading into the second round.
"On Saturday, I played the best 1 have all year," Keever said. "I hit it

great, and if a few eight-footers fell, could have shot really low."
Despite falling back to a final round 75, Keever held on for a two-stroke
victory over Takaishi and USC's Jennifer Rosales, one of the nation's top
players.
The home-course knowledge also paid off for sophomore Hilary Home
yer. who fired rounds of 75 and 72 to finish at 147 in fourth place.
Joining Keever and Homeyer on the leader board were Jae Jean Ro in a
tie for 12th at 156, Jessica Belskis in a tie for 30th at 159 and Julie Dunn in a
tie for 32nd at 160.
Playing as an individual medalist, Michelle Sperry carded rounds of 78
and 79 to finish tied for 20th. Teammate Lauren Robertson, also playing as
an individual, ended up tied for 38th, posting a two-round total of 162.
Stanford opened with a team score of 12-over-par 300 to take a six-stroke
lead over Saturday's play. As play began on Sunday, how
ever, the weather conditions took a turn for the worse ancl mad? liH a little
more difficult for the Cardinal.
"Saturday the course was in
great shape and we had really fa
vorable weather," Keever said.
"Sunday, the weather was not very
enjoyable. It poured on us for about
five holes, and the greens became a
lot slower and the fairways ex
tremely wet."
Posting a second-round 305 in
the rain, Stanford could not over
come the charge made by USC, who
claimed the team title.
The Trojan ladies fired a tourna
ment-low 291 on the second day,
bettering the Cardinal by 14 strokes
to finish at 599, six strokes ahead of
Stanford. USC had four players fin
ish in the top 10, all of whom posted
scores of 74 or lower on the final
day.
"USC just beat us today," Keev
er said on Sunday. "They had a great
final round and ours was just aver
age."
Despite losing the tournament
lead, the Stanford women are hope
ful as the season heats up in the com
ing weeks. Given the impressive
showing this week, Keever and the
Cardinal will be among the favorites
at the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships at the Stanford Golf
Course April 23-25.
"I am very excited," Keever said
after her win Sunday. "We will be
back in a week and a half for the
Pac-10 tourney. I think we are
readv."
