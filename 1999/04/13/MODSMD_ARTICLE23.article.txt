# Captain Ashley keeps her balance on way to the top
## 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
In the competitive and cutthroat
world of junior tennis, it's easy for
young players to lose track of what's
important and become obsessive
about their future tennis careers.
Often, top-ranked juniors attend
prestigious tennis academies rather
than normal schools, traveling
around the world to various tourna
ments while enduring the pressure of
equally obsessive parents.
Junior Tcrvn Ashley managed to
avoid such a lifestyle without sacrific
ing improvement in her game.
The lifestyle of the tennis phenom
leaves many girls psychologically im
mature and intellectually underde
veloped. Ashley, however, has her
head on straight.
"I definitely didn't first start play
ing tennis at a country club," she rec
ollects. "I played at this place in the
worst part of Boston because it was
close to my house. I had so much fun,
though. It was a really laid-back envi
ronment."
Ashley also enjoyed a comfort
able home environment, growing up
in Boston with her parents, younger
brother and sister.
"The whole family played sports
together," she says. "1 started tennis
when I was nine, and it came pretty
naturally tome."
Despite showing promise in the
sport, Ashley lived the life of a nor
mal teenager. She attended public
high school, never spending too
much time away from school in order
to participate in national tourna
ments.
Ashley began to make a notice
able impact on the national junior
tennis scene when she was 16. That
year, she fell to current teammate
Jennifer Heiser in the finals of the 16-
and-under Junior Nationals.
Still, she ignored any pressure to
allow her life to be consumed by her
tennis.
"My parents were supportive but
there was not a lot of pressure," Ash
ley remembers. "Sometimes, they

were almost too nice when I lost. But
they've really kept me grounded."
Ashley eventually ended up at
Stanford, where she couldn't be hap
pier. Ashley's game has developed
quickly under the California sun.
The 20-year-old played No. 6 sin
gles her freshman year, registering a
perfect 23-0 record in dual-match
play.
Her sophomore campaign was
even more impressive, as she ad
vanced to the Pacific 10 Conference
singles final and captured the conso
lation singles title at the 1998 Rolcx
National Individual Indoor Champi
onships.
Technically, Ashley's game is ma
ture and complete. Her strongest
weapons are her sizzling ground
strokes and powerful serve, but she
often surprises her opponents with
her variety and touch.
"I try and mix it up and change the
pace," she says.
Ashley's most unique weapon is
her running forehand, a shot that re
minds many onlookers of Pete Sam
pras' lethal forehand. Not surprising
ly, Ashley has looked up to Sampras
throughout her career.
"It's so cool when people say that
I'm the female Pete Sampras." Ash
ley says. "It's amazing for someone to
put you in that sense. He just has a lot
of class and works really hard."
Ashley cites her fitness and her
mental game as the weakest elements
of her tennis. A perfectionist. Ashley
remembers focusing on the negatives
during both practice and match-play
throughout her tennis career.
Her inability to forget about a
poor shot choice or a missed oppor
tunity has often cost her close match
es. Recently, however, she has
learned to focus on the positive and
remain in the moment.
Success has followed. Ashley
overcame Duke's Vanessa Webb,
the third-ranked player in the nation,
in three sets at the 1999 Rolex Indi
vidual Indoor Championships in
February, and she now boasts a 16-1
dual match record.
"The match against Webb was a

big step," Ashley recalls. "It was
more of a mental victory than any
thing else. I didn't get down on my
self. It was like a whole new concept."
The maturity and mental tenacity
that Ashley has demonstrated in re
cent months has come at the perfect
time. The Cardinal lost several top
ranked veterans last season and is
now rebuilding its program with
young talent. Ashley, the baby of the
team during her first two years, now
finds herself in the challenging posi
tion of captain, leader and role
model.
"I have to set an example now."
she says."I can't run away from the
workouts anymore."
While Ashley works very hard on
her tennis, she never loses sight of re
ality. She always remembers that the
world has a lot to offer and that suc
cess in tennis doesn't always translate
into success in life.
"I'm reallv focused, but I'm going
at my own pace," she says. "If 1 want
to eat chocolate, and it's going to
make me a little latter and slower. I 'm
still going to eat the chocolate any
way I'd love to turn pro after gradu
ation and have a successful career. If
it works out. great, but I won't be
heartbroken if it doesn't."
In the meantime, Ashley has her
sights set on the nation's top colle
giate honors. The Pac-10 Champi
onships and NCAA Championships
are looming, and Ashley hopes to
make a dent in both the individual
and team tournaments.
"I've never done well at the Na
tionals." she says. "But my recent run
through the Rolex Indoors proved to
me that I can string a lot of solid
matches together."
Ashley may not have taken the
conventional path expected of a ten
nis talent, secluding herself at an elite
tennis academy and practicing relent
lessly every day for hours, but her
level headedness has kept her enthu
siastic about the sport. Moreover, as
one of the nation's most promising
collegiate players, Ashley is at a point
in her career that several elite acade
my graduates can only envv.
