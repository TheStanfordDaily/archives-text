It is the most important match of the sea
son thus far for the 15th-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team (10-9,7-9 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation). The last game at
Burnham Pavilion for the Cardinal's three se
niors.
The timing couldn't have been better for
Cardinal fans seeking an exciting culmination
to the 1999 season.
"It's a do or die situation," said senior out
side hitter Patrick Klein.
Tonight's matchup against the 12th-ranked
Pacific Tigers (13-10, 9-9) promises to be a

thrilling game not only because of the post
season implications of the match, but also he

brother, senior Chris Griffith (4), ready themselves in the background.
this year Stanford seniors cannot
allow the emotion of the evening to
affect their preparation and concen
tration for the match.
"It hasn't really sunk in yet,"
Bart said. "I know I am going to
miss playing volleyball for Stan
ford."
Even though the Cardinal has
not secured its MPSF tournament
berth, Stanford must play with the
intensity and pressure of the single
elimination postseason tournament
environment.
"We have our backs against the
wall," Bart said.
"Everyone has been working
hard together because it could be
our last week of competition for the
year. There's nothing to hold back
at this point."
Stanford seeks perfection —
three wins in its final three matches
— to secure its spot in the MPSF
tournament.
But the Cardinal isn't the only
team with such goals.
The Tigers also have their sights
set on the MPSF tournament. After

dropping both of its matches against
No. 8 Hawaii last week, a win
tonight, in the Tigers' final game of
the season, could be enough to send
Pacific to the MPSF tournament for
only the third time in the school's
history.
With an experienced squad of
five returning starters, Pacific has
made significant improvements this
year from its 1998 record in which
the Tigers earned only four confer
ence wins. One such starter is
sophomore outside hitter Tim Ger
lach. who as of March 31, had
earned the highest hitting percent
age (.477) among all players in the
NCAA.
Klein, Barth and Griffith have
contributed greatly to the success of
this program. This year, Klein has
distinguished himself as the most
powerful attacker on the Stanford
squad. By tallying 336 kills, Klein
has earned a .281 hitting percent
age.
Injury has limited Bart's playing
time this season. He has recorded
202 career digs at middle blocker.
Recuperation from a shoulder
injury has affected the competition
of fifth-year senior Griffith, who has
recorded 31 career kills.
