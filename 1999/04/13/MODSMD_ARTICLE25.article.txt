## 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
The Cardinal fought through a Eugene,
()re.. chill and a light drizzle to produce top
marks this weekend at the inaugural Hay
ward Relays at Oregon.
A crowd of nearly 5,000 fans came out to
watch what turned into a Stanford vs. Ore
gun showdown on the track and a quality
crop of throwers and jumpers from around
the nation competing in the field events.
Stanford was led in the field by the ham
mer-throwing heroics of senior Adam Con
nolly, who captured first-place honors with
his toss of 228 feet, one inch. That mark pro
pelled him to the No. 3 spot in the nation and
bettered the national automatic standard by
more than six feet.
Stanford's Mark Ganek was third in the
event, improving his season best to 201-2, a
provisionally qualifying mark.
"Ganek is improving," Lananna said.

"Our throwers are in a heavy training peri
od right now. According to [throwing] coach
Robert Weir, he's going to throw a lot far
ther as the season progresses."
Other field highlights included Chad
Wassink completing three javelin throws
more than 2(X) feet and overcoming dismal
throwing conditions to place fifth overall at
204-1.
Toby Stevenson cleared the winning
height of 17-61/2 in the pole vault but was
relegated to second place behind Oregon's
Piotr Buciarski, who cleared the same
height with fewer attempts. Freshman
Michael Ponikvar faced the same situation
in the high jump, as he cleared the winning
height of 7-112 but took second-place honors
behind Marc Johannson of Minnesota.
On the track, the most exciting relay ac
tion of the day came in the 3,200-meter
relay. With many of Stanford's top middle
distance runners staying home to prepare
for next weekend's Mt. San Antonio Col

lege meet, Lananna pieced together a team
of freshmen Logan Taylor and Ryan
Meuse, sophomore Ryan Carroll and senior
Jake Maas to go head to head with top
notch squads from Oregon, Colorado, Min
nesota and Weber State.
Taylor led off with a split of 1 minute, 52
seconds and change, handing off to Meuse,
who replicated his efforts. When Carroll re
ceived the baton for the third leg, he blew
the race open with a 1:49.7 split, a major
breakthrough.
' Maas held off the Oregon squad as long
as possible over the final leg, but Oregon's
800-meter specialist Richard Girven
swooped past him in the homestretch and
captured the victory in 7:25.62 to Stanford's
7:26.13.
"That was the most exciting race of the
afternoon," said Lananna. "1 would never
have guessed that those guys would put to
gether a time of 7:26. The 4-by-800 was one
of the highlights of my coaching career."
