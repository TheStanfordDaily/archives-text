# Medley is top thrill for women
## 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
The first Hay ward Relays this past week
end at Oregon were blessed with coopera
tive weather, nearly 5,000 spirited fans, and
a sprinkling of fine performances by the
Stanford women's track and field team.
The highlight event for the Cardinal
women on the track was the distance med
ley relay. With senior Ail-American Mary
Cobb and junior All-American Sally Glynn
leading off and anchoring, respectively, the
Stanford squad looked poised to avenge a
15-second defeat in the 3,200-meter relay
that came earlier in the day at the hands of
Oregon. Yet. after strong showings in the
1,200-meter leg by Cobb, the 400-meter leg
by senior Cynthia Morman and in the 8(X)-
meter leg by freshman Colleen Flaherty, it
looked as if the hometown Ducks would get
the best of Stanford again. By the time
Glynn was handed the baton for the 1,6(X)-
meter anchor leg, Oregon All-American
Marie Davis was 15 meters in the lead.
With the crowd screaming for the leader,
Glvnn worked her wav to the front. After fi

nally catching Davis with one lap to go, the
two Ail-Americans ran neck and neck for
350 meters, but in the end Glynn pulled
away to give the Cardinal the win by nearly
a second, 11 minutes, 20.74 seconds to
11:21.71.
" The crowd was really fun and extreme
ly enthusiastic," said Glynn. "Though I'm
sure that they were rooting for Marie, the
crowd was generally supportive of great
competition."
The other exciting relay for the Cardinal
was the 4(X)-meter relay, not an event that
Stanford is known for. Yet with a strong
team made up of freshman Robyn Wool
folk, junior Wilsa Charles, senior Tracye
Lawyer and junior Jayna Smith, Stanford
put up a great fight against Washington
State. Though the team ended up second in
46.35 compared to WSU's 45.89, Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna was not disap
pointed.
"We ran 46.35, which is the best time
we've had in the 4-by-l in a long time," said
Lananna. "Our exchanges were pretty
good, but not great. I think that we'll run a
lot faster We were particularly pleased

with Jayna because she is not a true short
sprinter and yet she ran exceedingly well."
Both Smith and Charles came back after
the relay to compete in the 200-meter dash,
capturing third and fifth places, respectively.
The race capped a great day for the
sprinters.
"The 200 was into a headwind, yet
Jayna's time [of 24.7 0J was a [personal
record] for her," said Lananna. "We're just
trying to get a little short, explosive speed
work in for her so when she comes back in
the 400, she'll be able to get out quickly
enough and I think that's where we'll really
see the results."
The Cardinal also flexed its muscle off
the track where two throwers made provi
sional qualifying marks for NCAAs. Junior
Summer Pierson won the discus with a
throw of 179 feet, six inches, a mark that
should get her into the NCAA meet in
Boise, Idaho. In the weight throw, junior
Maureen Onyeagbako threw a provisional
mark of 181 feet to earn second place.
Cassie Romuld and Maggie Isaac both
put up Pacific 10 qualifying marks in taking
fourth and fifth places in the shotput.
