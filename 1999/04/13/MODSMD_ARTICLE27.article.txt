## 
### Cáitrín McKiernan 
This spring marks the first stage call for a new
student theatrical group.
Ihe Highlighters Traveling Theater Troupe
will hold its first organizational meeting Wednes
day at 5 p.m. in the Tresidder Union Cypress
Room.
Founded last fall, the group aims to promote
independent student theater projects by serving
as a liaison between different writers, actors, di
rectors and technical crews. It will fund between
three and nine productions per year to be per
formed on and off campus. •
I lighlighters co-founders, seniors Alice Hug
man and Avery Willis, hope the group will bring
together many different members of Stanford's
theater community.
With "the Drama Department, Ram's Head,
the Committee on Black Performing Arts, the
Asian Theater Project and improvisational
groups, everyone is their own entity," explained
Willis, herself a contributor to Drama Depart
ment productions. By contrast. Highlighters plan
to include a broader mix of participants.
The group will sponsor a range of productions,
the creators and participants of which will change
from show to show. ()nce a student does a show,
he or she becomes part of the group.
()ne of the main features of I lighlighters pro
ductions will be their ability to travel.

"Stanford has a long tradition of drama in the
community," Willis explained. "The Stanford
Repertoire Company in the 1970s is a good exam
ple. We want it to spread it out [into the commu
nity] again."
Performance venues might include local high
schools, retirement communities or even Golden
Gate Park.
The Highlighters also want to get involved in
the Drama Department's introductory classes,
freshman and sophomore seminars and small per
formances based on Area One Program's texts.
"Wc hope to find ways of putting drama into aca
demies as well as entertainment," Willis said.
During this year's Admit Weekend the High
lighters, in conjunction with Ram's Head, will
perform "Saturday Night Live," a showcase of
Stanford theater for prospective freshmen. The
show will include skits from Gaieties, Winter
One-Acts and "Jesus Christ Superstar."
Highlighters received a one-time grant from
Dean of Students Marc Wais. Wais said he gave
the grant in order to "strengthen the arts at Stan
ford ... because you can't have too much of a
good thing." A separate one-time grant came
from Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldivar.
According to Willis, the group will most likely
apply for ASSU funding next year.
Bugman and Willis hope the Highlighters will
bring out new talent. "Sometimes it is difficult for

those not [already] involved" to get involved,
Bugman said. "Also, they may feel bogged down
with work" and not have the time to audition.
In May the Highlighters will hold a Frosh
Drama Festival, a competition between the fresh
man dorms. Students will perform short mono
logues, excerpts from larger pieces or one-acts.
Members of the Drama Department, Ram's
Head Theatrical Society and the Creative Writing
Program will be asked to judge the competition.
The winners will have the opportunity to use
funds to produce their pieces as full-length plays.
The festival idea is modeled after a freshman
drama competition called "Cuppers" at Oxford,
where Bugman and Willis both studied last year.
It was "Cuppers" that brought the visions of
the two co-founders together. Bugman wanted to
start a similar contest at Stanford. Willis formed
the idea of the Highlighters during her sopho
more year, but did not really start it as a club.
Both have participated in campus theater and
have known each other since their first year at
Stanford. Bugman has acted in shows including
"Measure for Measure" and Ram's Head's up
coming "Antigone." She also directed a Winter
One-Act this year.
Willis has served as the Drama Department's
house manager since her freshman year and is
also currently its publicity assistant. She has par
ticipated in a number of shows, including "La
Bete" and "Ajax."
