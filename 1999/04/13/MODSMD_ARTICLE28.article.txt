# Conference explores Pushkin's work
## 
### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
A major six-tl;iv international
conference on author Alexander
Pushkin began yesterday and will
continue at Stanford until Saturday.
"Alexander Pushkin and Hu
manistic Study: Methodological
Assumptions, Issues of Translation,
East-West Dialogue" is sponsored
by several organizations, including
Stanford, the 1 Jniversity of Wiscon
sin and the Center for Pushkin
Studies.
Kenneth Pushkin, a descendant
of the Russian author, called the In
ternational Pushkin Bicentennial
Conference "the most significant

conference of its kind ever in
America."
He added that he hopes the con
vention will "bring a greater appre
ciation of Pushkin to the United
States."
The convention, which coincides
with the bicentennial of Pushkin's
birth in 1799, will be attended by
more than 100 of the world's most
prestigious Pushkin scholars. It will
explore how Pushkin's lyrical and
narrative poetry, prose works and
drama helped provide a literary
heritage for Russians.
Monica Cireenleaf, associate
professor of Slavic languages, said
that the convention would "prove
that Pushkin is still alive" after the

collapse of the Soviet Union. "His
works remain classics," she said.
Slavic Languages Prof. Lazar
Fleishman is one of the main rea
sons that the convention is being
held at Stanford. He is one the
world's premier Pushkin scholars
and helped organize the conven
tion.
Unfortunately for the general
public, for whom the convention is
free, most of the readings and lec
tures are in Russian. Kenneth
Pushkin, however, hopes to attract
a diverse audience.
The first speech of the confer
ence, given by David Bethea of the
I Jniversity of Wisconsin, was titled,
"How to Write a Biography of

Pushkin in a Post-Modern Age."
Although the language barrier
may prevent most visitors from en
joying all speeches of the confer
ence, they may be interested in an
exhibit of Mikhail Chemiakin's
drawings for Pushkin's "Mermaid"
in the lobby of the Hoover Tower
or a reading from Vikram Seth's
novel, "The Golden Gate." Seth
earned his master's in economics at
Stanford and his novel is heavily in
fluenced by Pushkin.
Darlene Reddaway, a doctoral
student in Slavic languages, ex
plained the importance of the con
vention by saying, "In Russian ele
mentary school, you learn this stuff
by heart."
