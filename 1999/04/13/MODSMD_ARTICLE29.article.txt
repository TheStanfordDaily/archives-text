SAILING
■ Saturday-Sunday: No. 14 Stanford
placed third at the St. Francis Inter
sectional.
Despite strong individual per
formances and a solid team show
ing, the race only made the No. 14
Cardinal sure of one thing: Hawaii
will be the one to chase.
"Hawaii is definitely going to be
a tough team on the team-racing
side," said Stanford head coach
Steve Hourdow. "If there's one
thing I learned this weekend, it's
that Hawaii is going to be tough.
They obviously have four very
strong teams."
The No. 13 Rainbow Wahine
showed their depth by capturing

both the No. 1 and 4 spots in the
coed-fleet race. Sixth-ranked USC
took second place. Stanford fol
lowed, finishing third in the 20-
team field.
The Cardinal was anchored by
the strong individual performance
of junior skipper Heather Porter.
Porter, with sophomore crewmem
ber Katie Gregg, turned in an im
pressive second-place finish in the
A Division.
"Heather had a very solid fin
ish," said Bourdow. "There was
some really good competition, and
that will help her later in the season
as we get into All-America run
nings."
The varsity competition was
rounded out by the seventh-place
performance of junior co-captain
Tyler Doyle and senior crew Caro
line Sumpl. Additionally, the Car
dinal fielded two successful junior
varsity teams. Their 1-2 finish at
tests to the depth of the Stanford
program.
'Hie Intersectional consisted of a
number of short course races — ap
proximately 15 to 20 minutes each

— over a two-day period. Despite
brief Sunday winds, conditions on
San Francisco Bay were unusually
calm. According to Doyle, strong,
shifting currents throughout the
weekend made for tricky sailing.
Besides providing conditions
similar to those expected for the
district dinghy championships on
Monterey Bay, the Intersectional
provided an opportunity for Bour
dow and the Stanford sailors to size
up their Pacific Coast competition.
According to senior co-captain
Taylor Robinson, the team hoped
for a second-place finish. Howev
er, its third-place fleet-racing finish
does give it an idea of the chal
lenges it will face against Hawaii
and USC next weekend at the dis
trict team-racing championships in
Monterey.
"We're the third or fourth team
in the district," said Bourdow. "If 1
had to rank it right now. that's how
I see it. So we have to have a good
day [to get a national berth] at the
district championship. We can do
it. But if the other teams have good
days, we may end up in third."
