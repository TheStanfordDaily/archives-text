# Candidates debate; election today
## 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
A crowd of fewer than 12 people
gathered last night at Branner Hall
to hear the ASSU election debate.
During the first half hour of the
evening — the time set aside for a
debate between presidential candi
date Mike Levin and Adam Weiss
— the two candidates mainly sum
marized their already-published
platforms.
Sophomore Levin outlined his
slate's focus as a greater emphasis
on student voice, unification be
tween the undergraduate and grad
uate communities, innovative pro
jects within the Stanford communi
ty and addressing issues specific to
the graduate community.
Both were asked to summarize
and rank their overall goals. Junior
Weiss categorized his objectives as
internal ASSU reform, creating
more student space on campus and

working towards greater accep
tance among diverse student
groups.
Both presidential candidates
promised greater efforts for student
outreach and representation. "We
will spend only half of our time in
the office. We will go to organiza
tions, to dorms," Weiss said. "We
are people people."
Levin pledged effective student
representation through the non-tra
ditional nature of his candidacy,
teaming an undergraduate presi
dential candidate with a graduate
vice presidential candidate.
"When we go into an administra
tive meeting, we are an undergradu
ate and graduate student. There is
no middleman; we represent all
14,000 students," he said.

Responding to the moderator's
prompt to discuss weaknesses with
in his platform, Weiss countered
Levin's statement.
"We are only two people. No
matter which two people you are
you don't represent everyone.
There is no possible way two candi
dates can have that outreach from
the beginning," he said.
Levin stated his platform has no
weaknesses.
Both Levin and Weiss support
the proposed constitutional amend
ment to split the ASSU into sepa
rate graduate and undergraduate
entities. The four presidential and
vice presidential candidates issued a
unanimous statement in support of
the amendment this week.
When questioned as to why the
student body seems poorly in
formed regarding the amendment,
the candidates cited a lack of stu
dent involvement.

"You have to take initiative as
students to read up. [ The amend
ment] has been publicized every
where," Levin said. Weiss added
that the 42-page amendment is un
derstandably "not too fun to read."
Following the presidential de
bate, seven members of the ASSU
debated the amendment, which will
be voted on in this week's general
ASSU elections.
Disagreement arose between se
nior David Searle and the other sen
ators. Searle was the only ASSU
senator to vote against the amend
ment.
Searle charged that the amend
ment would create "an unaccount
able graduate council that won't be
ready to allocate $ 160,(KX) in student
fees."
ASSU Vice President Santos
Marroquin responded to Searle by
saying that vetoes by the ASSU
president and financial manager

will check irresponsible spending.
Harris Shapiro, current chair of
the Graduate Student Council,
added that voting by consensus,
which requires unanimous approval
of all present representatives, will
ensure trustworthy money alloca
tions.
Shapiro, who has previously
served as a graduate senator in the
ASSU. advocates the amendment.
He said it will improve efficiency
within the ASSU and allow gradu
ate students to address important
quality of life issues within their
community.
KZSU also sponsored a radio de
bate for senate candidates last night.
Only four of the 52 candidates run
ning for ASSU Senate attended the
debate.
They were junior David Aru
lanantham, freshman Andrew
Blotky. freshman Jefferson R. Ep
pler and junior Kristy Wilson.
