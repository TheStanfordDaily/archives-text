# No. 2 baseball faces down powerful Bozied, Dons
## WCC-leading hitter will challenge Cardinal rotation

To find big numbers in college
baseball, it's best to look small, as
in small schools.

■ Today: No. 2 Stanford (25-9) vs.
San Francisco (14-20-1), 6 p.m.,
Sunken Diamond. RADIO: KZSIJ
(90.1 KM)

For example, take the San Fran
cisco Dons (14-20-1) and their star
Taggert Bozied, who come to
Sunken Diamond tonight to face
No. 2 Stanford. The Dons' sopho
more first baseman with the star
tling name has been putting up sim
ilarly startling numbers in the small
West Coast Conference, establish
ing himself as the league leader in
seven offensive categories.
Bozied's .429 batting average,
58 RBIs, 1.025 slugging percentage,
.540 on-base percentage and
NCAA-leading 22 home runs are
all amazing season-ending totals
but they are especially shocking
considering he's put up the num
bers in only 34 games.
Though many of Bozied's
bombs came in bunches — he had
four against Sonoma State and
three against Washington State
he has also been consistent, hitting

one in the season opener and con
tinuing throughout the season.
His present three-game stretch
without a home run ranks as
Bozied's longest drought this year.
However, like many of the num
bers that populate the top of the
NCAA rankings, Bozied's are sus
pect. Most of the players whose sta
tistics lead the NCAA are talented,
but play at small schools like
Delaware, Troy State or Illinois-
Chicago where they face over
matched competition.
Bozied's WCC competition is
similarly underwhelming. Though
the conference features the third
ranked Pepperdine Waves (31-4.
11 -3), it is not otherwise particular
ly strong.
No WCC team other than Pep
perdine and San Diego, which has
lost its last four, has a winning
record.
Either freshman left-hander
Mike Gosling (1-2, 6.20 ERA) or
sophomore left-hander Brad Drew
(1-3,4.% ERA) will probably draw
the starting assignment for Stan
ford against Bozied and the Dons.
Neither has been especially ef
fective of late. Gosling has given up
34 hits and 26 runs, only 17 of which
were earned, in just under 25 in
nings on the mound. Twelve of the
34 hits Gosling has given up have
been doubles.

Gosling and Drew have also
been erratic. They both have
walked almost a batter an inning.
If either starts, he will have to
show more control to be effective.
Though the Dons are fairly one-di
mensional, the Cardinal pitchers
must stay ahead of the San Francis
co batters, especially Bozied, to
take charge of the game.
Though none of the Cardinal
squad have put up numbers as
shocking as Bozied's, the team's of
fensive production has been im
pressive of late.
Facing the high-quality pitchers
of the Pacific 10 Conference, in
cluding Ail-American candidates
like Washington's Jeff Heaverlo
and I JSC's Barry Zito, the team has
quietly improved its offensive pro
duction since its early season lull.
Sophomore Joe Borchard has
been one of the biggest reasons for
Stanford's resurgence. Helped by a
recent 11-game hitting streak. Bor
chard is now hitting an impressive
.365 with six home runs and 28
RBIs.
Four other starters — sopho
more Billy Jacobson and juniors
Damien Alvarado, Jeff Rizzo, and
Nick Day — are now hitting over
.300, boosting the overall team av
erage up to .2%. more than 30
points higher than it was in early
March.
