Winning two out of four in one
weekend isn't bad. but it's not ex
actly what the Stanford softball
team (32-11, 4-6 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) had in mind.
After splitting a homestand
doubleheader against Sacramento
State last Tuesday, the Cardinal
was eager to win its next four
games. Though the No. 8 Cardinal
stood higher in the rankings than its
opponents — No. 13 Oregon State
(31-12.4-4) and No. 12 Oregon (30-
13. 5-5) — the ranking did not pro
duce the right wins. In a Pac-10
homestand at the Stanford Softball
Complex, the Cardinal dropped
both games of a doubleheader on
Saturday to the visiting Beavers be
fore coming back to sweep the
Ducks on Sunday.
In the first game, Oregon State
and Stanford stood in a scoreless tie
through the sixth inning. But in the
top of the seventh, with Beaver sec
ond baseman Brooke Rutschman
on base, designated player Court
ney Stewart found a gap in left field
to score Rutschman for the winning
run. Beaver pitcher Tarrah Beyster

blanked the Cardinal's offense, al
lowing just four hits and no runs in
l-O victory.
Senior Becky Blevins took the
mound for the Cardinal in the sec
ond game of the clay. Stanford out
hit the Beavers in the game 6-4 but
managed no runs as it suffered a 3-
0 loss. Though Blevins gave up only
four hits, Oregon State was able to
score three runs — two of which
came off a two-run homer by first
baseman Jenni Jodoin.

Realizing the importance of
their next two games and disap
pointed in their performance on
Saturday, the Stanford players and
coaches held a meeting before their
doubleheader against Oregon.
With rankings shifting and Pac-10
predictions changing everyday,
Stanford was finding itself a victim

to its surroundings.
"Our coach told us that it was
easy to sit and watch what was
going on around us," said junior
catcher Kellie Wiginton. "but that
we just needed to go out there and
play and worry about our team."
With Stanford falling to 30-11
and 2-6 in the Pac-10. the intent was
on winning. Though perhaps not
convincing as they might have
liked, Stanford edged out the
Ducks in both Sundav games 3-2
and 4-3.
In game one, Cardinal second
baseman Robin Walker provided
the offensive spark, going 2 for 4 on
the day with two runs scored. After
a hit by Wiginton allowed her to
cross the plate to take a 1-0 lead in
the second. Walker stepped up in
the sixth and hit a double off Ore
gon pitcher Connie McMurren.
She then scored for the second time
off a Marey Crouch single. Just two
outs later, right fielder Ramona
Shelbourne scored the winning run
after Wiginton lined a double to
center field.
In game two. Stanford's offense
got off to an early start. After just
three innings, the Cardinal led the
Ducks 4-0. Freshman Jessica Men

do/a, Stanford's offensive star this
season, drove in outfielder Jenni
Foyle and Wiginton with a double
in the first inning. The Cardinal
added two more runs in the third
thanks partially to errors hy Ore
gon second baseman Katie Mackey
and shortstop Holly Ray. Junior
Lauren Gellman pinch ran for Bee
son who reached base on Mackey's
error. Gellman later scored and
was followed by Walker, who
crossed the plate after Ray's error.
Oregon came back to score a
run in the next inning before tally
ing two more in the sixth. In the
seventh inning, with the score 4-3 in
favor of Stanford, Oregon placed
two runners in scoring position.
With one out. Crouch took over the
pitching duties from Blevins and
shut down the next two Oregon
batters.
"We were happy to come back
and win two on Sunday," Wiginton
said. "It's easy to get caught up in
the rankings and all. but we need to
focus on how we're playing."
The Cardinal returns to action
this Friday and Saturday when the
team travels to Arizona for double
headers against Arizona and Ari
zona State.
