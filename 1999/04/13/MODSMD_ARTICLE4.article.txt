# Palo Alto considers new bus plan
## 
### Kara Chalmers Contributing writer 
Palo Alto officials are discussing plans that may give Stanford students
more choices as they navigate their surrounding community.
Saturday the city government held a public meeting to discuss imple
menting a new community-based shuttle bus system that might relieve the
stress of driving and parking for students, staff and Palo Alto residents.
According to Jeffrey Tumlin, a consultant working for the city, there are
many different ways to approach the local bus plan.
The city might make improvements to the existing Valley Transit Au
thority bus system, facilitate an expansion of Stanford's Marguerite shuttle
system into Palo Alto or use some combination of both. Tumlin said the city
has not yet decided who will own or operate the bus line.
Although Stanford has been involved with the project since its beginning
in October 1998, the city and Stanford have not held formal discussions to de
termine what role the University might play. The Marguerite currently pro
vides free transportation around the Stanford campus and to the University
Medical Center, downtown Palo Alto, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter and California Avenue.
The proposed bus system would serve Palo Alto residential neighbor
hoods and commercial areas. Planners have not decided whether there will
be a fare or not.
"Right now we are figuring out where the bus system will work best and
what we recommend, then we will figure out the cost and the funding
sources," said Tumlin, a senior planner with Nelson / Nygaard. the consult
ing group hired by Palo Alto for the project.
At the Saturday meeting, the public and representatives of the planning
committee discussed the project. Nelson / Nygaard hopes to present a draft
plan to the Palo Alto Planning Commission and City Council this spring, ac
cording to Tumlin.
"The Marguerite is an excellent transit system, and it embodies many of
the qualities that the city would like to see in Palo Alto." Tumlin said. "Hut
we can't simply replicate the Marguerite; because it is very local, and it
doesn't make good regional connections to other cities."
In a survey done last fall by Stanford's Department of Parking and Trans
portation Services, 66 percent of resident students said they wanted expand
ed weekend Marguerite service, and 15 percent said they would like later

evening service for weekdays. Thirty percent of commuting students also
supported expanding weekend services, and 22 percent favored later
evening service. Ten percent of residents and 27 percent of commuters ex
pressed a desire for more frequent scheduling, rather than trips every 15 min
utes.
This year, ASSU President Maren Norton's push for expanded Mar
guerite hours led to the Midnight Express line, which runs from 8 p.m. to 2
a.m. on Friday and 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturdays between stops on campus and
downtown Palo Alto.
"I know that Stanford is committed to a free Marguerite and continued
expansion is welcome." Norton said. "1 am a proponent of any expansion of

public transportation in the area."
"Ideally, it would be a free ser
vice, which would be an added in
centive for people to take public
transportation rather than their own
cars," she added.
Tsitsi Jaji, a first-year doctoral
student in comparative literature,
said that if the new shuttles were
free, she would definitely support
the plan. "Otherwise, the expansion
would be overkill," she said.

"The Marguerite is very handy,"
senior Sacha Zadmehran said. How
ever, he added, "There is no need for
it to go any further into Palo Alto.
Palo Alto is small, and all the bars
are on this side of the city."
Susan Law, parking and transit
operations coordinator for Stan
ford's Parking and Transportation
Services Department, said students
seem toapp r eciate the Midnight Ex
press.
"The Midnight Express is doing
better and better every week," she
said. This past weekend, Law said
about 350 people, or 40 passengers

per hour, used the service.
" This is doing much better than
we thought it would," Law said.
Starting next Monday, three
changes in Marguerite lines will be
implemented, according to Law.
First, the B line will be rerouted
to include several stops at the Stock
Farm parking lot, near the Medical
School Office Building, where there
is C and Z parking for commuters.
It will take 7 minutes to reach
Tresidder from the Stock Farm lot
on the Marguerite, which is a lot
shorter than the time it takes people
to search for parking places closer to

campus. Law said.
Second, the Downtown Express
line, which now includes stops on
Serra Mall and at the Medical Cen
ter, will he rerouted to include the
Cantor Center, stops on Galvez
Street and Hoover Tower.
Third, the SLAC line will be
rerouted to include service to west
residences along Santa Theresa
Street, including Lagunita, Roble
and Governor's Corner.
Representatives of Transporta
tion Services will probably meet
with the Palo Alto Planning Com
mittee soon, according to Law.
