# Palo Alto considers new bus plan
## 
### Kara Chalmers Contributing writer 
Palo Alto officials are discussing plans that may give Stanford students
more choices as they navigate their surrounding community.
Saturday the city government held a public meeting to discuss imple
menting a new community-based shuttle bus system that might relieve the
stress of driving and parking for students, staff and Palo Alto residents.
According to Jeffrey Tumlin, a consultant working for the city, there are
many different ways to approach the local bus plan.
The city might make improvements to the existing Valley Transit Au
thority bus system, facilitate an expansion of Stanford's Marguerite shuttle
system into Palo Alto or use some combination of both. Tumlin said the city
has not yet decided who will own or operate the bus line.
Although Stanford has been involved with the project since its beginning
in October 1998, the city and Stanford have not held formal discussions to de
termine what role the University might play. The Marguerite currently pro
vides free transportation around the Stanford campus and to the University
Medical Center, downtown Palo Alto, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter and California Avenue.
The proposed bus system would serve Palo Alto residential neighbor
hoods and commercial areas. Planners have not decided whether there will
be a fare or not.
"Right now we are figuring out where the bus system will work best and
what we recommend, then we will figure out the cost and the funding
sources," said Tumlin, a senior planner with Nelson / Nygaard. the consult
ing group hired by Palo Alto for the project.
At the Saturday meeting, the public and representatives of the planning
committee discussed the project. Nelson / Nygaard hopes to present a draft
plan to the Palo Alto Planning Commission and City Council this spring, ac
cording to Tumlin.
"The Marguerite is an excellent transit system, and it embodies many of
the qualities that the city would like to see in Palo Alto." Tumlin said. "Hut
we can't simply replicate the Marguerite; because it is very local, and it
doesn't make good regional connections to other cities."
In a survey done last fall by Stanford's Department of Parking and Trans
portation Services, 66 percent of resident students said they wanted expand
ed weekend Marguerite service, and 15 percent said they would like later

evening service for weekdays. Thirty percent of commuting students also
supported expanding weekend services, and 22 percent favored later
evening service. Ten percent of residents and 27 percent of commuters ex
pressed a desire for more frequent scheduling, rather than trips every 15 min
utes.
This year, ASSU President Maren Norton's push for expanded Mar
guerite hours led to the Midnight Express line, which runs from 8 p.m. to 2
a.m. on Friday and 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturdays between stops on campus and
downtown Palo Alto.
"I know that Stanford is committed to a free Marguerite and continued
expansion is welcome." Norton said. "1 am a proponent of any expansion of
