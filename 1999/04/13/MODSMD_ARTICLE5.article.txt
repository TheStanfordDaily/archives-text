# Satisfying campus caffeine cravings
## Moon Bean's Cafe thrives 
### Fei Wu Contributing writer 
Ten months after its opening
last May, Moon Bean's Cafe has

drawn regular customers from stu
dents and staff and exceeded origi
nal sales projections, said cafe co
owner Jennie Reynolds yesterday.
Last spring, library officials au

thorized Moon Bean's Cafe to
open in front of Green Library.
The family-owned cafe also has
a branch in San Jose, but Reynolds
said the Stanford branch "probably
does four times as much business."
Reynolds said students make up
about 60 percent of the cafe's cus
tomers, while faculty and staff con
stitute the remaining 40 percent of
the patrons.
She added that the business has
also been hired to cater events on
campus.
Manager Bennet Allen said the
amount of business parallels stu
dents' academic schedules. "Dur
ing the summer, business drops
down to about a third, but during fi
nals week it's non-stop, constantly
busy here."
