# Satisfying campus caffeine cravings
## Moon Bean's Cafe thrives 
### Fei Wu Contributing writer 
Ten months after its opening
last May, Moon Bean's Cafe has

drawn regular customers from stu
dents and staff and exceeded origi
nal sales projections, said cafe co
owner Jennie Reynolds yesterday.
Last spring, library officials au

thorized Moon Bean's Cafe to
open in front of Green Library.
The family-owned cafe also has
a branch in San Jose, but Reynolds
said the Stanford branch "probably
does four times as much business."
Reynolds said students make up
about 60 percent of the cafe's cus
tomers, while faculty and staff con
stitute the remaining 40 percent of
the patrons.
She added that the business has
also been hired to cater events on
campus.
Manager Bennet Allen said the
amount of business parallels stu
dents' academic schedules. "Dur
ing the summer, business drops
down to about a third, but during fi
nals week it's non-stop, constantly
busy here."

15 workers, with two to three peo
ple working at a time.
"People come here and enjoy
the people. A lot of places you go,
[workers] are as stiff as a board,"
Allen said.
Allen believes the cafe does not
pose a threat to the Coffee House,
also located on campus.
"We don't feel the competitive
drive against any of the business
es," he said.
"We run it like a coffee shop
outside of campus. We do actually
keep things as low as we can,"
Allen said.
Freshman Tania Lombrozo,
who visits the cafe several times a
week, said, "I definitely think the
coffee has a better taste here. In
general, it's just easier to just stop
by casually between classes."
"And it's more vegan-friendly,"
she added.
"I went to the Co Ho last night
because that's more famous, but

this one 1 just discovered on my
own," said Tiana Desker, a
prospective freshman currently
visiting Stanford from Singapore.
"I guess you come [to Moon
Bean's] to eat and get a drink but
not really hang out. I guess this is
food, and [the Coffee House] is
someone's living room." Desker
said.
Reynolds said when the cafe
first opened, she devoted 60 to 70
hours each week at the business.
After promoting Allen to man
ager one month ago she is no able
to spend about 20 hours per week
overseeing operations on campus.
"He's our first person on salary.
That's a pretty big step for our
company," Reynolds said.
According to Allen, ideas for
future improvements include hir
ing musicians in the summer and
creating a study place for the stu
dents.
"We're always looking to offer
more products, but space is always
an issue. It's the first year of busi
ness, so we don't want to do too
much," Allen said.
