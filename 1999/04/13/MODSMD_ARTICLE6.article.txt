# Nagel studies breakfast

When University of Chicago
Physics Prof. Sidney Nagel sits down
for breakfast, he sees more than a
cup of coffee or a slice of toast with
honey. He sees evidence of the fun
damental forces of our universe at
work.
Nagel, who gave the annual
Robert Hofstadter Memorial lec
ture last night at the Science Quad's
Teaching Center, studies "Physics ;it
the Breakfast Table" â€” specifically
the mess left behind by many com
mon food products.
"I want to address the physics of
these messes," Nagel said.
He explained that he began these
physics experiments because he no

nomena, such as the physics behind
breakfast." He said that manv such

questions have been left unan
swered because of the immense
focus placed on quantum mechan
ics.
"There is a lot of physics in
breakfast that gives texture to our
lives," Nagel explained. He point
ed out that breakfast foods proved
elusive, in that their behavior is un
expected. As an example, he
demonstrated the unpredictability
of pouring honey with a spoon.
"Why is honey so messy com
pared with water?" Nagel asked.
To examine this phenomenon, he
showed pictures comparing honey
drops with water drops.
"These photos proved my very
naive intuition wrong," Nagel said.
He noted that the outcome was
much more complicated than he

expected. In coming to his conclu
sion, Nagel explained that he dilut
ed water with glycerol to examine
the characteristics of liquid drops.
Nagel added that the use of glyc
erol, "which gives McDonald's
shakes their je ne sais quoihelped
him discover that all drops behave
the same way.
"Through this experiment, I re
ally learned something about uni
versality in science," Nagel said.
Nagel moved on to the explo
ration of coffee stains. "Why are
coffee stains always ring-shaped,
and why is the coffee always on the
outer ring?"
Nagel illustrated the practical
uses of his work when he spoke of
an experiment inspired by his
study of coffee stains. "Re
searchers put DNA into coffee
drops, and realized that this elon
gated the DNA and made it easier
to sequence the DNA."
