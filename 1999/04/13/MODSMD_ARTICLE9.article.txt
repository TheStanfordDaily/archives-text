# Students win Goldwater prizes

Three students, all passionate about their re
spective work in science and engineering, were
awarded for their dedication last month when
they each received a Barry M. Goldwater Schol
arship.
Junior Jason Deng, junior Brian Milch and
sophomore Felicia Tarn will each receive $7,500
for school expenses to encourage them to pur
sue careers in mathematics, the natural sciences
or engineering.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Hans Andersen highlighted the importance of
the students' interests and research. "It is always
interesting to read all the applications," Ander
sen said.
The application process involved getting
three recommendations and writing an essay. In
her essay, Tam wrote about cosmology. "I've
been very interested in astronomy since eighth
grade," said Tam, a physics major. "Cosmology
... is a kind of answer of where we come from;
an explanation of how everything is."
Tam discussed "dark matter," which is found
inside superclusters of galaxies. Scientists are
puzzled by dark matter and its composition.
"A small fraction of the amount of dark mat
ter could be ordinary matter, but the rest is this
exotic matter that we don't know about," Tam

said. She added that scientists hope to learn
more about dark matter by studying the veloci
ty of galaxies in superclusters.
Milch, a symbolic systems major, discussed
the importance of learning more about a differ
ent area â€” language.
"I wrote about doing research in probabilis
tic models of how humans use language well
enough so we can get computers to understand
people talking," said Milch, who has been work
ing with Asst. Computer Science Prof. Daphne
Koller.
"My long-term goal is to apply probabilistic
techniques to language processing." Milch said.
Deng won his scholarship for his work study
ing thunderstorms. During his freshman and
sophomore years, Deng studied thunderstorm
activity using ground-based antennae with Elec
trical Engineering Prof. Umran Inan and gradu
ate student Steven Resing.
"The work involved analyzing data collected
from antennae located at Stanford University
and Palmer Station in Antarctica and compar
ing the data with information from satellites
from the National Weather Service," Deng said.
"We were able to conclude that ground
based monitoring of thunderstorm activity was
accurate enough to be a viable alternative to
satellite based-tracking," Deng said. This con
clusion could help cut costs on thunderstorm ac
tivity detection equipment in the future.

During the selection process, Andersen
worked with an internal selection committee
and Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldivar to nominate four students for
further competition on a national level. After
the final selection process, three Stanford stu
dents joined a list of 304 scholarship winners in
the United States.
" These are people who have well-defined in
terests. They are self-directed with a high sense
of understanding of what they want to accom
plish," Andersen said. "It was very hard to de
cide which four students should be nominated.
We had to judge which ones would be most com
petitive in a national competition."
Many of the scholarship winners were caught
off-guard. "I was on the phone with my brother
in Massachusetts, when I opened the envelope
and just began screaming," Tam said. "It is pret
ty exciting to get something like that when you
don't expect it," she said.
Milch was also somewhat surprised. "I am
happy that they thought that what I was inter
ested in was worthwhile and that I showed
promise," Milch said.
The three recipients are asked to send an an
nual letter to the Goldwater Foundation for the
next four years, describing the progress of their
work and studies. 1999 marks the 11th year the
Goldwater Foundation has supported outstand
ing undergraduate students in these fields.
