Trust Yourself,
Not the Daily
Dear Fellow Student,
In light of the Daily article Monday, we feel it appropriate to
address the constitutionality of the Amendment entitled An ASSU
For All Students. We believe the Elections Commission upheld
the spirit of the ASSU Constitution and continues to work in the
best interest of students. The student body should be given the
opportunity to vote yes or no based on the merits of the
Amendment itself, and should not be guided by unfounded accu
sations concocted by the Stanford Daily.We ask that you take the
time to visit http://election.stanford.edu and formulate your own
opinion as to whether or not you support the Amendment.
For complete text of the Constitutional Amendment, An ASSU For All Students, go to:
http://election.stanford.edu
Vote Wednesday, April 14th, and Thursday, April 15th!
