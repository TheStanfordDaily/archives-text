$1.21 worth?
KZSU, your Stanford radio station, is asking you for money again: We want
you to vote YES on KZSU's special fee in this week's elections. If our fee is
approved, each student will pay a (refundable) fee of $3.63 next year (not $7.45
as erroneously stated in the Election Handbook). That's $1.21 per quarter.
What can you get for $1.21 these days? At better fast-food joints, that'll get you a
very small hamburger. At the better coffee outlets, that might buy you a regular
coffee.
At KZSU, that'll get you punk, Stanford Football, local bands, Stanford
Women's basketball, country music, President Casper, jazz, Stanford Men's
basketball, gospel music, Stanford Women's Volleyball, blues, Stanford
Baseball, hip-hop, news, and, just incidentally, a chance to learn to be a disk
jockey, news reporter, broadcast engineer, or sportscaster. It will also get you
a station that has spent years getting ready for the next disaster, so you'll have
news and information during an emergency. During the earthquake of 1989,
KZSU stayed on the air when big stations went down. During the flood last
year, KZSU brought you reports live from Stanford's Emergency Operations
Center. During the power failure last week, KZSU stayed on the air.
All we're asking you for is $3.63 next year. We honestly think it's the
best deal you'll get all year. Please vote YES on the KZSU special fee.
