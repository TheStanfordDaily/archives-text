### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
Dean of Engineering John 1 lennessy was named Stanford's next provost
yesterday.
Hennessy will succeed current Provost Condoleezza Rice, who an
nounced last December that she planned to step down this summer. He will
begin July 1.
Hennessy is widely praised. "He's been a really superb dean." Rice said.
"He's very intellectually quick, has a wonderful sense of humor, and he
cares a lot about Stanford."
University President Gerhard Casper was enthusiastic as well. "1 have
had three years to observe John as dean, and I have found him to be an out
standing contributor to University endeavors," Casper said.

"John cares deeply about undergraduate education at the Engineering
School and his relationship to the broader curriculum. I'm sure he'll con
tinue that in his new role," Casper added.
Hennessy is excited about taking the job.
"Stanford's great strength is that it combines things as diverse as music
and engineering. 1 look forward to working on this spectrum of exciting pro
grams," he said.
He said he greatly respects the work that Rice has done while in office.
"What I really admire is that she's really improved the budget situation
while she still tried to do some innovative things."
Casper said that he is confident that "John and 1 will have the same close
working relationship I have had with Condi."
The choice of Hennessy marks at the end of a three month selection
process that began with the creation of a search committee composed of fac
ulty, staff and students.
The committee recommended a "short list" of candidates to C 'asper. who
then chose the 46-year-old engineer to become the University's second
highest ranking administrator.


"Stanford's great
strength is that it
combines things as
diverse as music
and engineering. I
look forward to
working on this
spectrum of exciting
programs."
