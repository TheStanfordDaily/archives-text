# John Hennessy chosen as next provost
## Dean of Engineering to follow Rice's footsteps 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
Dean of Engineering John 1 lennessy was named Stanford's next provost
yesterday.
Hennessy will succeed current Provost Condoleezza Rice, who an
nounced last December that she planned to step down this summer. He will
begin July 1.
Hennessy is widely praised. "He's been a really superb dean." Rice said.
"He's very intellectually quick, has a wonderful sense of humor, and he
cares a lot about Stanford."
University President Gerhard Casper was enthusiastic as well. "1 have
had three years to observe John as dean, and I have found him to be an out
standing contributor to University endeavors," Casper said.

"John cares deeply about undergraduate education at the Engineering
School and his relationship to the broader curriculum. I'm sure he'll con
tinue that in his new role," Casper added.
Hennessy is excited about taking the job.
"Stanford's great strength is that it combines things as diverse as music
and engineering. 1 look forward to working on this spectrum of exciting pro
grams," he said.
He said he greatly respects the work that Rice has done while in office.
"What I really admire is that she's really improved the budget situation
while she still tried to do some innovative things."
Casper said that he is confident that "John and 1 will have the same close
working relationship I have had with Condi."
The choice of Hennessy marks at the end of a three month selection
process that began with the creation of a search committee composed of fac
ulty, staff and students.
The committee recommended a "short list" of candidates to C 'asper. who
then chose the 46-year-old engineer to become the University's second
highest ranking administrator.


"Stanford's great
strength is that it
combines things as
diverse as music
and engineering. I
look forward to
working on this
spectrum of exciting
programs."

Experience
Hennessy cites both his years as a
teacher and as an administrator, as
well as his work in the private sector,
as preparation for the job of
provost. He said that as dean, he has
tried to encourage the departments
in engineering to emphasize teach
ing undergraduates, as well as "their
service role to the rest of the Uni
versity."
As dean he has continued to
teach and advise both undergradu
ate and graduate students, and h
has gained experience in manage
ment and fundraising.
"If you meet financial chal
lenges, you can achieve the ends
that faculty and students want to
achieve," Hennessy said. "When a
professor or a department chair has

a great idea, my first response is,
'How can we make this happen?' "
Hennessy has engaged in much
long-term planning for the School of
Engineering, resulting in a new
trend tov/ard bioengineering and
biomedical engineering, as well as
leading the school in offering tin
University's first all-online degree
program — a master's program in
electrical engineering.
His work on technology in the
classroom reflects both his own and
Casper's belief that technology will
change the processes of teaching
and learning. "My goal is to say,
'how do you think about using tech
nology to enhance the classroom ex
perience?' " Hennessy said.
Hennessy gained national
prominence with his breakthrough
development in simple computer
architecture called RISC, or re
duced instruction set computer. In
more recent years he has focused on

ways to use computer power for
problem solving in all different cir
cumstances, such as scientific simu
lations.
Hennessy arrived at Stanford's
Department of Electrical Engineer
ing in 1977. After becoming an asso
ciate professor in 1983, Hennessy
took some time off from teaching to
work in the private sector, founding
MIPS Computer Systems, now
MIPS Technologies. He became a
full professor in 1986 and later be
came chair of the Computer Science
Department. In 1996 Hennessy be
came dean of the School of Engi
neering.
According to Hennessy, this ex
perience helped him appreciate
"the importance of the people you
work with and the importance of
leadership, about being able to
achieve things that do justice to the
people on the front lines."
"I think of leaders as servants of

their constituents," he said.
Campus issues
In recent years the Provost Of
fice's has taken fire for issues such as
the promotion and tenure of women
and minorities. Hennessy, however,
said he is ready for the challenge.
"What we're going to have do is get
our tenure process so that it is
broadly understood," he said. He
added, however, that the problem
"won't be solved overnight."
Hennessy noted the need for ju
nior faculty to understand the
process and the need for good feed
back.
ASSU President Maren Norton,
who served on the search commit
tee, said that finding a person who
was committed to diversity issues
was a top priority to her personally.
Norton said that, earlier in the
year, students presented her with a

petition asking that the new provost
be sensitive and aware of diversity
issues.
Rice also noted Hennessy's sen
sitivity. "It's not the color of their
skin or gender that matters. It's a
matter of commitment," she said.
Hennessy is "highly committed to
women and minority issues on cam
pus," she added.
In the position of provost, Hen
nessy will also be involved in the
continuing development of under
graduate education, land and hous
ing issues, and the annual budget.
An engineer as provost
The appointment of an engineer
as University provost is somewhat
unprecedented, as the last three
have been social scientists. Rice is a
political scientist by training, spe
cializing in international relations.
Her predecessor was former Eco

nomics Prof. James Rosse. He and
his predecessor. Emeritus Psycholo
gy Prof. Albert Hastorf, served as
provosts under former University
President Donald Kennedy.
The only provost to come from
engineering in the last two decades
was interim provost Gerald Lieber
man, a statistics professor and an in
dustrial engineer, who served for
about 18 months during the transi
tion between University presidents
in 1992.
Norton said that because Stan
ford is strong in humanities and sci
ences, as well as engineering, it is
important to have top administra
tors who understand and represent
all aspects of the University.
"It was a difficult process —
there was such a talented group to
choose from: great teachers, great
people," Norton said. "Hennessy is
really committed to both graduate
and undergraduate education."
