Igniting fears of a widening conflict, Serb
forces pushed into northern Albania yes
terday, fought an hour-long skirmish
with Albanian troops, seized a border
hamlet and torched homes before with
drawing. Albanian officials and interna
tional observers said.
With Albania a major staging ground
lor NA TO forces, even yesterday's inci
dent — short-lived, small-scale, with no
reported casualties — brought a warning
from Washington that Yugoslavia would
make a grave mistake in expanding the
fighting.
In Belgrade, Yugoslav officials denied
any incursion into Albania. The chief of
the army information service, Col.
Milivoje Novkovic. said on state televi
sion that Yugoslavia's defense of its own
borders was "being fabricated as an
alleged invasion."
Albania, in turn, said the Serb push
into its territory would carry conse
quences. Sokol (ijoka. an Albanian For
eign Ministry official, said his country
would take necessary steps to defend
itself, "in close coordination with our
allies."
These days, that means NATO, which
has taken over Albania's airfields,
airspace and military infrastructure. In
coming weeks, a force of Apache attack
helicopters and thousands more allied
troops will be based in Albania.
White House spokesman Joe Lock
hart said Washington had received
"credible reports" of a Serb incursion, as
well as past instances of Serb forces
crossing the border or shelling Albanian
territory.
"If (Yugoslav) President (Slobodan)
Milosevic seeks to widen this war. it will
be a great mistake," he said.
The warning came as NATO moved
to more than double its air armada. In
Brussels. Belgium, the supreme allied
commander in Europe. U.S. Army (/icn.
Wesley Clark, said he had requestedt3oo
more U.S. aircraft as well as additional
air power from other NATO allies.
In Washington. President Clinton said
nearly three weeks of NATO airstrikes
are "diminishing and grinding down"
Milosevic's military capabilities.
I'lie Albania border clash, by the
account of international monitors watch
ing from nearby, began when about 50
Serb infantrymen advanced on lightly
manned Albanian border posts early ves
terdav afternoon.

Listening in on the Albanian border
police radio frequency, international
monitors say they heard police urgently
ask Albanian soldiers stationed a lew
miles away what to do. They were told to
stand and light, but soon reported they
were surrounded and retreating.
As the Yugoslav forces pushed
toward the hamlet of Kamenica (pro
nounced Kah-mah-NEE-tsali) -which
had already been shelled by the Serbs for
several days, driving oil most resi
dents — Albanian soldiers moved to
engage them.
After an exchange of fire — possibly
light artillery, according to the
monitors — the Serbs pulled back, but
not before torching several houses.
Artan Jakupi. a translator with the
Organization for Security and Coopera
tion in Europe, which monitors the bor
der area, watched from the village of
Bajram Curri. seven miles away, as a
cluster of houses burned in Kamenica,

including his own.
In the three weeks since NATO
began airstrikes aimed at forcing Milose
vic to |iull his forces out of Kosovo, agree
to a peace deal and end the mass expul
sions of ethnic Albanians, Yugoslavia
has scorned any compromise.
Yesterday, however, deputy Prime
Minister Vuk Draskovic hinted
Yugoslavia might find "certain precondi
tions for agreement," claiming the
alliance had "abandoned key goals
regarding Kosovo," including a NATO
led force in the province and "indepen
dent-like" status for the Kosovo Albani
ans.
NATO, meanwhile, said its bombard
ment of a passenger train in southern
Serbia on Monday was "an uncanny acci
dent." I lie alliance said the target was
the bridge the train was crossing.
Yugoslav officials said 10 people died
and Hi were hurt when the train was
struck bv NATO missiles.
