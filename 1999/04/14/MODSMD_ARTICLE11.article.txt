# Clinton urges Congress to continue Serb airstrikes

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Clinton pressed his case with Congress
yesterday for giving the air campaign
against Yugoslavia more time, saying it
had heavily damaged President Slobodan
Milosevic's military capacity and was now
being escalated "to the next level."
His presentation, and caution by top
congressional leaders, appeared to tem
porarily blunt an effort in both chambers
to force a quick vote on whether prepara
tions should be made for a ground war.
"I don't think we ought to speculate on
ground troops," said Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott. R-Miss. Senate
Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota said it was a decision that
could be made later. "We shouldn't have
this John Wayne mentality. We have to
understand this is going to take a long
time," he said.
But Congress could begin debating
paying for the war as early as next week.
Clinton said he would send an.emergency
spending bill to Capitol Hill within the
next few days. Pentagon spokesman Ken
neth Bacon estimated it would be $3 bil
lion to $4 billion.
Congressional officials said the figure
could run as high as $5 billion — cutting
sharply into the government's newfound
budget surplus.
A delegation of 30 or so House and
Senate members will go to the Balkans
this weekend to check out the situation
for themselves, congressional leaders

said.
Clinton met for 2 1/2 hours at the
White House with more than 50 House
and Senate members, many of whom
urged him to either use ground troops or
reposition them in Europe. Defense Sec
retary William Cohen, National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger and Gen. Henry
Shelton. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, later went to Capitol Hill to brief a
wider audience.
"Our campaign is diminishing and
grinding down Mr. Milosevic's military
capabilities," the president said in the
Rose Garden. "Now we are taking our
allied campaign to the next level, with
more aircraft in the region, with a British
carrier joining our IJSS Roosevelt and a
French carrier in the area."
Even lawmakers critical of Clinton's
conduct of the war voiced support for a
continuation of the ground campaign.
"We are there now for biitter for worse
and we have to support ourjj}ilitary peo
ple." said House Armed Services Com
mittee Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C.
"We're going to have to get in there and
put our money where our mouth is."
Meanwhile, NATO's military com
mander, Army Gen. Wesley Clark, said
he has requested about 3(H) more U.S. air
craft as well as more air power from
NATO allies. The Pentagon said Cohen
would approve the increase — the largest
single boost in manpower since the
bombing campaign began March 24.
