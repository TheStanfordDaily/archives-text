Committee, submitted prepared
remarks yesterday laying out his
rationale against renewing the Inde

I he officials, who spoke only on

condition of anonymity, said Starr
opposes renewing the law on sever
al grounds, including that it violates

attacks against the special prosecu
tors. the officials said.

Senate panel will offer Democrats
the first chance to question Starr
