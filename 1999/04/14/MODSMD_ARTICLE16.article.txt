1999 ASSU Election
gives all students a
valuable opportunity

Let's be honest here. You have a
lot of reasons not to vote in
this week's ASSU election.
Maybe you're cynical about the
ASSU, tired of electing representa
tives who promise to change the way
student government runs — to make
it work for you — and then watching
as the new year progresses and noth
ing seems to change. You're sick of
senators who don't show up for meet
ings and of meetings that don't seem
to accomplish anything.
Perhaps you're weary of the elec
tion process, of posters and slogans,
of senate debates that draw four can
didates and presidential debates that
don't attract more than a dozen spec
tators.
Most likely you're busy, maybe
even too busy to take a 10-minute
break from e-mail, lire up a Web
browser and vote. It's spring quarter,
and the week is sunny, and you have
better things to be doing with your
time than bothering with an institu
tion that never seems to affect you.
This is why you should bother.
You should vote because 36 spe

cial-fee groups are asking for your
money this year, more than a million
dollars worth, and you should take
care to ensure that your funds are
spent wisely.
You should vote because a pro
posed amendment to the ASSU Con
stitution would change how your stu
dent government operates. You
should study the issue, read the text
and decide if you think that change
would benefit you and your fellow
students.
You should vote because the
ASSU Senate does important, but
often not-so-glamorous, work that
affects you directly. It appropriates
funds to student groups, nominates
students to University committees
and lobbies the University on student
issues. You should take care in elect
ing representatives who can handle
these responsibilities.
Most of all, you should vote
because by doing so, you show the
University that you care. In a time
when students are calling for more
say in the ten tiring process and a per
manent seat on the Board of
Trustees, it is easy for administrators
to write off students who don't even
bother to turn out for their own elec
tions.
Empower yourself. Take the time
to vote today or tomorrow.
