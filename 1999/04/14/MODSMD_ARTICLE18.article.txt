# Breathing Lessons
## My Greek Rush adventures 
### 
April van Scherpe

The other day i
woke up screaming
and found myself
in a pool of rushees.
I told my friends that it
was an experiment. Far
from being the Mother
Ship shining a homeward

beacon, sororities were the enemy — perpet
uators of rampant sexism and the dominant
force behind ego disorders of young women
everywhere. I planned to strap 011 an air
mask, rappel into the cave and, amidst the
high-pitched screeching and leathery Hap
ping of wings, confirm the worst rumors
about the Greek system.
I told myself that it was an exercise in
building character. An admitted participant
in the smirks and howling at Soro-Frat
stereotypes ought to have a factual basis for
bias. I told myself to go in with an open mind.
I'd either get a glimpse at gender desecration
or — yeah right — I'd gel me some of those
tear-jerking "shared experiences." I told
myself that... wait... maybe just something
about the system would grab me and I'd be
sucked into sisterhood. I told myself not to
tell anyone how excited I was.
The excitement apparently did not per
vade the community. I rving to get a little
company in the Greek adventure was harder
than getting a frater ... uh, nevermind. In
response to the rush suggestion, imagine
incessant laughter, death looks and the
ambiguous "thanks, but I'd rather chop off
my arm."
Reluctance seemed justified after the first
day. Gaggles of nervous girls elbowed
through the five "parties." Standard fare was

chanting members, five-minute dorm-home
town-major conversations and a video with
lots of wardrobe coordination. The girls
stood too close in the roar of over-energetic
conversations and many left feeling shouting
at, passed around and underestimated, since
judgements based on chit-chat can only be
snap.
I debriefed with a I rat friend. He was
loathe to talk about each sorority's general
ized reputation, but I pointed out that soror
ities at large seemed to be living up to theirs.
When personalities run deeper than a once
over but momentary exchanges eliminate
candidates, superficial generalizations seem
to be the rule. How can organizations that
choose members based on outside impres
sions hope to be known as anything other
than shallow? And if first impressions are
making the cuts, can one group really claim
to be different than another? Doesn't the
power of sororities stem not from shared
beliefs hut merely from an "us versus them"
mentality?
I was disappointed.
As curiosity walked me up the Tresidder
stairs for call backs, I caught my reflection in
the windows. Four reflections, actually
one in each pane — all dressed and moving
the same way. Fitting.
Hut it became apparent 011 the second day
that some of the girls were friends and
enjoyed whatever connections they had with
their groups. I looked for an explanation,
scrutinized the skits and had longer conver
sations. Within each sorority, some girls
clicked with each other and rushees, and
some didn't. No one person was always a
bastion of hospitality or of intimidation. (Jet-

ting along was a function of which two peo
ple you put together. In short, the members
were real people with standard idiosyn
crasies and friendship patterns.
It is likely that, given the right circum
stances, almost any two people can become
emotionally close. Sororities rarely identify
an overarching theme that guides their group
or a philanthropy that dominates their inter
actions. So if not beliefs and not an activity,
what is left to unite this relatively random
collection of young women?
A strong commitment to sticking togeth
er.
Whether they arose from a desire to sur
pass others or a need to party, sororities have
morphed into a good recipe for bonding peo
ple. The formula is not flawless; the process
and intended results seem at odds with one
another. If you want a close group of friends,
superficial elimination fails severely. The
Cireek system, at least on the sorority side,
would greatly benefit from a reorganization
of how members are chosen — a new system
that treats prospective Greeks as whole peo
ple and not just bubbly socialites.
But I finally understand the pull. Sorori
ties create a constructed reality where the
motto is "we're in this together!" Sisters
endeavor to support each other and actively
cultivate camaraderie. Whatever Haws there
are in the blueprints, it's a gorgeous home
design.

April Van Scherpe ate $17 worth of Spring
Rush M&Ms. Maybe she should buy some
friends, because she won't have any after this
column.
