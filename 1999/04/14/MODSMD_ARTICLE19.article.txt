A holiday for Hoover
Stanford University is unique in that its
founder, Lcland Stanford, and its most illus
trious alumnus. Herbert Hoover, have been
targets of vilification.
The statuary group of the Stanford fami
ly, once the centerpiece of Memorial Court,
was demoted from one spot to another until
it was rescued from the University dump by
those of us who strive to be fair.
Meanwhile a bronze James B. Duke, the
benefactor (not the founder) of Duke Uni
versity, sits smugly smoking a very political
ly incorrect cigar in the main quad of the
University, basking in general respect.
Senator Stanford, an infinitely greater
man, was dismissed as a robber baron, and
his failure to hit the Golden Spike properly
added derision to hatred.
An American engineer, Henry Meiggs.
built the trans-Andean railroad, which goes
higher than any other standard-gauge rail
road in the world, a splendid feat that did
for Peru what the transcontinental railroad
did for the United States. Yet he too has
received the Stanford "robber baron" treat
ment. Men of achievement arouse the envy
of lesser men.
The Stanford administration has carried
out a brilliant public relations coup that is
beyond the means of scribblers of historical
justification.
It embellished Founders Day with an
impersonation of Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford by a charming couple, followed by a
free lunch. Well, there is no such thing as a
free lunch; the payment was gratitude to
Stanford's founders.

Herbert Hoover was one of America's
most noble presidents and also the most
self-made. His life was a tragedy. A Quaker
internationalist, he fought famine in war
torn Europe and later, as a pacifist, he
founded the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace. His presidency was
hit by the Depression, and he was shattered.
When I knew him he was an embittered old
man. ridiculed by faculty and students. The
I ioover lower was referred to as I toover's
last erection. He quit Stanford for West
Branch, lowa. The Hoover Institution,
which seems to have forgotten its original
mission, is generally viewed as the home of
right-wing, partisan economists.
The Hoover Institution's administration
should take a leaf from the I Jniversity. Cel
ebrate Herbert Hoover Day, with a charm
ing couple impersonating the Hoovers (Lou
Henry Hoover was a distinguished woman
in her own right), and after a ceremony
describing Hoover's work for peace, give
the assembly a free lunch. In the human
structure, the mind rests on the heart and
the heart on the stomach. It would be a win
win-win gesture.

Endorsement lacked information
We are concerned by The Daily's repre
sentation of the Barrio Assistance program
in yesterday's special-fee edition. Hardly
any information was given about our pro
gram. unlike most of the other endorse
ments. Because of the new campaign code

we arc unable to carry out many of the nor
mal campaign procedures, such as appear
ances at house meetings. Therefore we feel
it is a crucial part of The Daily's responsi
bility to the Stanford community to inform
them about the function of special-fee
groups.
Barrio Assistance is a literacy tutoring
program serving l X) Stanford students and
70 children from East Palo Alto and has
been in existence for 28 years. We are the
oldest student-run community service orga
nization on campus and thanks to the con
tinuing support of Stanford students, we
have maintained a solid base operation
while looking to outside funding for expan
sions and improvements to the program.
Three years ago we were able to increase
the program size by 60 percent, from 1(H)
people to 160, with no additional cost to
Stanford students. This continues to be true.
We are further disturbed by the seeming
misrepresentation of our finances in yester
day's Daily. The only significant change in
our special-fee budget, it is true, is the 3.70
percent drop in this year's budget. Howev
er, The Daily does not seem to realize that
we have drastically expanded the program
while continuing to request the same
amount of money. The endorsement reads,
"the group's budgets for the last several
years have all come almost entirely from its
special fee, and this year's budget continues
the pattern."
If The Daily would review the budgets
submitted by Barrio Assistance, they would
find that only 51 percent of our total budget,
including operations and capital improve
ments, comes from the Stanford communi

ty. Approximately $20,000 of a $41 ,(HK) bud
get comes from outside funding, specifically
Wells Fargo and the Stolsaftz Foundation.
The ASSIJ did not provide The Daily
with our grant budget, in addition to the
operating budget we submitted to the Spe
cial 112 ee Committee. All of our money for
books, computer software, summer support
salaries and other needed capital improve
ments comes from an outside source of
funding.
( ommunity service is an integral part of
student life here at Stanford. It offers Stan
ford students an opportunity to grow per
sonally by providing us with a chance to
expand our horizons, to develop communi
cation and leadership skills, to forge lasting
bonds with the outside community and is a
crucial complement lo our intellectual and
professional development. We are dis
turbed that Barrio Assistance has received a
lower rating than some organizations with
higher budgets and a much smaller target
community. Considering that we serve 90
members ol the Stanford community, have
reduced our budget significantly and that
both our members and your newspaper give
us high marks for the services we provide,
we feel that our endorsement was made
with inadequate information and does not
portray Barrio Assistance fairly.
We hope that The Daily will reassess its
position in light of this information.
Finally, we hope that Stanford students
will vote responsibly and support an organi
zation that not only benefits Stanford stu
dents but also looks outside our campus to
