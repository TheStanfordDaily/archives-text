A holiday for Hoover
Stanford University is unique in that its
founder, Lcland Stanford, and its most illus
trious alumnus. Herbert Hoover, have been
targets of vilification.
The statuary group of the Stanford fami
ly, once the centerpiece of Memorial Court,
was demoted from one spot to another until
it was rescued from the University dump by
those of us who strive to be fair.
Meanwhile a bronze James B. Duke, the
benefactor (not the founder) of Duke Uni
versity, sits smugly smoking a very political
ly incorrect cigar in the main quad of the
University, basking in general respect.
Senator Stanford, an infinitely greater
man, was dismissed as a robber baron, and
his failure to hit the Golden Spike properly
added derision to hatred.
An American engineer, Henry Meiggs.
built the trans-Andean railroad, which goes
higher than any other standard-gauge rail
road in the world, a splendid feat that did
for Peru what the transcontinental railroad
did for the United States. Yet he too has
received the Stanford "robber baron" treat
ment. Men of achievement arouse the envy
of lesser men.
The Stanford administration has carried
out a brilliant public relations coup that is
beyond the means of scribblers of historical
justification.
It embellished Founders Day with an
impersonation of Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford by a charming couple, followed by a
free lunch. Well, there is no such thing as a
free lunch; the payment was gratitude to
Stanford's founders.

Herbert Hoover was one of America's
most noble presidents and also the most
self-made. His life was a tragedy. A Quaker
internationalist, he fought famine in war
torn Europe and later, as a pacifist, he
founded the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace. His presidency was
hit by the Depression, and he was shattered.
When I knew him he was an embittered old
man. ridiculed by faculty and students. The
I ioover lower was referred to as I toover's
last erection. He quit Stanford for West
Branch, lowa. The Hoover Institution,
which seems to have forgotten its original
mission, is generally viewed as the home of
right-wing, partisan economists.
The Hoover Institution's administration
should take a leaf from the I Jniversity. Cel
ebrate Herbert Hoover Day, with a charm
ing couple impersonating the Hoovers (Lou
Henry Hoover was a distinguished woman
in her own right), and after a ceremony
describing Hoover's work for peace, give
the assembly a free lunch. In the human
structure, the mind rests on the heart and
the heart on the stomach. It would be a win
win-win gesture.

Endorsement lacked information
We are concerned by The Daily's repre
sentation of the Barrio Assistance program
in yesterday's special-fee edition. Hardly
any information was given about our pro
gram. unlike most of the other endorse
ments. Because of the new campaign code

we arc unable to carry out many of the nor
mal campaign procedures, such as appear
ances at house meetings. Therefore we feel
it is a crucial part of The Daily's responsi
bility to the Stanford community to inform
them about the function of special-fee
groups.
Barrio Assistance is a literacy tutoring
program serving l X) Stanford students and
70 children from East Palo Alto and has
been in existence for 28 years. We are the
oldest student-run community service orga
nization on campus and thanks to the con
tinuing support of Stanford students, we
have maintained a solid base operation
while looking to outside funding for expan
sions and improvements to the program.
Three years ago we were able to increase
the program size by 60 percent, from 1(H)
people to 160, with no additional cost to
Stanford students. This continues to be true.
We are further disturbed by the seeming
misrepresentation of our finances in yester
day's Daily. The only significant change in
our special-fee budget, it is true, is the 3.70
percent drop in this year's budget. Howev
er, The Daily does not seem to realize that
we have drastically expanded the program
while continuing to request the same
amount of money. The endorsement reads,
"the group's budgets for the last several
years have all come almost entirely from its
special fee, and this year's budget continues
the pattern."
If The Daily would review the budgets
submitted by Barrio Assistance, they would
find that only 51 percent of our total budget,
including operations and capital improve
ments, comes from the Stanford communi

ty. Approximately $20,000 of a $41 ,(HK) bud
get comes from outside funding, specifically
Wells Fargo and the Stolsaftz Foundation.
The ASSIJ did not provide The Daily
with our grant budget, in addition to the
operating budget we submitted to the Spe
cial 112 ee Committee. All of our money for
books, computer software, summer support
salaries and other needed capital improve
ments comes from an outside source of
funding.
( ommunity service is an integral part of
student life here at Stanford. It offers Stan
ford students an opportunity to grow per
sonally by providing us with a chance to
expand our horizons, to develop communi
cation and leadership skills, to forge lasting
bonds with the outside community and is a
crucial complement lo our intellectual and
professional development. We are dis
turbed that Barrio Assistance has received a
lower rating than some organizations with
higher budgets and a much smaller target
community. Considering that we serve 90
members ol the Stanford community, have
reduced our budget significantly and that
both our members and your newspaper give
us high marks for the services we provide,
we feel that our endorsement was made
with inadequate information and does not
portray Barrio Assistance fairly.
We hope that The Daily will reassess its
position in light of this information.
Finally, we hope that Stanford students
will vote responsibly and support an organi
zation that not only benefits Stanford stu
dents but also looks outside our campus to
the surrounding communities and addresses
our responsibility to working towards posi
tive social change.

El-Amin is no saint after all
For those of you not up to date, Khalid
Kl-Amin was arrested yesterday for posses
sion of marijuana. Yes, the same El-Amin
who orchestrated the University of Con
necticut's win over the Cardinal in Maples
Pavilion on Feb. 6. The very same man
whom the 6th Man Club taunted merciless
ly throughout the game.
For weeks after the game, countless let
ters filled The Daily, chastising the 6th Man
Club for berating "a responsible father and
a model citizen." The value of the club was
called into question again, as it had been
last year, following the UCLA and Arizona
games. The members of 6th Man received
e-mails reminding them of the purpose of
the club and suggesting that it focus on pos
itive comments that make players feel warm
and fuzzy inside. Many of us were disap
pointed to learn that a letter was sent to El-
Amin and the University of Connecticut
Athletic Department on behalf of 6th Man,
apologizing for teasing such a fine young
man and begging for their forgiveness.
College basketball players are big boys
and, with the possible exception of the Uni
versity of Arizona, they should be smart
enough to realize that they are responsible
for their actions, on and off the court. The
price of being stars is that their lives become
the focus of public scrutiny and often
ridicule. Those are the breaks.
Stanford students are a spirited bunch,
and if we show our spirit in creative uses of
the word "bastard," then so much the bet
ter. The remarkable athletes we hurl these
insults at can certainly take it — if they can't
then they can go home and smoke a bowl
until they feel better about themselves. Just
don't get caught.
I do not regret teasing El-Amin or any
other player. Remember, sticks and stones
can break your bones, but words and laser
pointers only bug you. Taunting signs and
chants are funny, and they are also part of
the game. The players know it, so should
everybody else. We should not have to
apologize for having lun and trying to help
our team. My only regret is that we put
away Jelani McCoy's five-foot bomber joint
before we had the chance to use it again.

'Kids' portrayal was incorrect
In yesterday's endorsements section of
The Daily, the evaluation of Kids with
Dreams was positive, but it did not give a
complete portrayal of our goals in applying
for ASSII special fees.
Doubts were raised as to whether or not
our service organization would become
dependent on special fees as a source of con
tinual funding. We would like to dispel those
doubts by clarifying our use of these fees.
We have planned a project involving
Stanford students to integrate technology
into the classroom to enhance our efforts in
working with developmentally disabled
children. Outside sources of funding have
already been sought, and earlier this year,
we received a grant from Hewlett Packard
for seven laptop computers to bring into the
schools we volunteer at. Unfortunately,
despite a year of fundraising efforts, we still
need funding to install teaching software.
The money we receive from ASSI) spe
cial fees will be used in our project's first
year of implementation. ()ur operating fees

have always been covered by a quarterly
budget, approved by the ASSU Senate, sep
arate from special fees. We want to clarify
again that we will not be applying continu
ally for special fees to cover our regular
operating expenses.
Our main purpose in asking for this
funding is to initiate a program that will
greatly improve Stanford volunteers' efforts
in helping disabled children in the class
room setting.

SEAS information incomplete
The endorsement for SEAS (Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford)
neglected to mention most of SEAS's activ
ities and gave us credit for some things we
didn't do.
This year, SEAS: filled Kresge Auditori
um twice, once for UFW co-founder
Dolores Huerta (in coalition with MEChA)
and once for Kevin Danaher, founder of
Global Exchange; livened up the Coffee
House with singer activist Casey Neill; led
dorm presentations about corporate
responsibility; co-sponsored the Grassroots
Organizing Weekend (GROW); supported
an East Palo Alto effort to prevent a
cement plant from entering their communi
ty; and presented proposals to and worked
with the Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility (APIR). SEAS also funds
and organizes the dorm environmental rep
resentatives.
SEAS has also worked with MEChA,
SLAC (Stanford Labor Action Coalition)
and the NAACP.
SEAS did not produce the Dis-Orienta
tion Guide. SEAS helped fund the Guide
and members contributed to it, but many
other folks made it happen. E-mail
diso@lorax.org to get your own copy. SEAS
also didn't provide Toxics Tours of East
Palo Alto. SEAS has gone on Toxics Tours,
but they are led by YUCA, a group of EPA
youth organizing against toxics in EPA.
That's what we've done (and not done).
You can make your own decision about
whether to vote for us.

Film Society makes correction
We want to thank The Daily for pointing
out some of the important contributions the
Stanford Film Society has made to the Stan
ford community; however, we would like to
correct some of The Daily's comments in
the ASSU endorsement section.
The Daily stated that only a small frac
tion of the SFS operating budget comes
from sources outside of special fees. That is
not entirely true.
In addition to the approximately $1,5(X)
that we receive from ticket sales from grad
uate students and the general public, we
also receive donations and financial help
from other groups on and off campus. This
year, outside donations to the United
Nations Film Association Film Festival
(held during fall quarter) amounted to
approximately $6,.5(H). Next year we expect
much more as both Ted Turner and Robert
Redlbrd will be involved with the event.
The Daily also suggested that we should
reduce our costs. Unfortunately many of
the costs of showing films on campus are
fixed, such as tech services fees, some film

rentals and advertising. We have, however,
been able to get many filmmakers to waive
their speaker's fees and / or film rental fees.
SFS only asks for $5.02 from undergrad
uates and in return offers students opportu
nities to make films through our film grants,
learn about filmmaking and discuss film
through our Undergraduate Film Work
shop, come to weekly film series, see films
in 35mm for free and meet and discuss films
with their creators.
When considering the SFS special fee,
please note that SFS helps other student
groups show films on campus. By co-spon
soring events with groups such as Hillel,
BSA, LGBCC and A3C, we have allowed
these groups to hold provocative film
events.
Because we have been getting special
fee funding, all of our events are free to
undergraduates; we would hate to have to
change this. When you vote for special fees,
remember the $7.50 you pay each time you
see a movie at a theater when you don't get
to discuss the film with its director after the
screening.

Tell us what was lacking
The efforts of The Daily's editorial
board to educate Stanford students about
the election prior to voting are admirable.
As the dominant communication medium
on the Stanford campus, The Daily is in a
unique position and wields considerable
influence through its endorsements. How
ever, by failing to clearly explain the ways in
which special-fee groups fall short of specif
ic criteria, The Daily performs a disservice
to the voting public by providing a judge
ment based upon incomplete knowledge
and understanding.
While the 4 rating that A ASA, the Asian
American Students Association, received in
The Daily endorsement is excellent, we
would like to point out the inadequacy of
this rating based on the fact that the Daily's
editorial board failed to point out any areas
in which AASA failed to meet the criteria
of the 5 rating.
If an organization is given a rating of less
than 5, there should be some explanation of
its shortcomings. However, based on The
Daily's comments regarding the AASA
Special Fee, there is absolutely no indica
tion of any failure to meet the endorsement
criteria. In fact the Daily editorial board
clearly emphasized the strength of the
AASA Special Fee by stating that "AASA
has worked hard to keep its budget down —
increasing its fee request from 1998-99 by
less than 1 percent — and has shown a good
understanding of its constituency by exclud
ing a graduate-student-focused group from
under its umbrella."
Furthermore, in accordance with The
Daily's explanation of its rating scale,
AASA and the 11 other groups under the
AASA special fee have successfully met all
goals for the previous year.
While many groups fill a unique role on
campus, this is especially true for AASA, as
well as the other ethnic community groups.
The Asian American cultural programming
funded by the AASA Special Fee con
tributes significantly to diversity at Stanford
and enriches the experience of the entire
student body.
AASA annually reviews all of its pro
grams, looking for areas of improvement
and is constantly searching for new ways to
serve the Stanford community. The AASA
special fee is re-evaluated annually to allow
for the expansion of existing programs and
the creation of new events such as this
year's voter registration drive during fall
quarter and the Asian American film series.

AASA's budget is consistently among the
most organized and streamlined, which is
reflected in the minimal increase of 0.85
percent in the amount of the special-fee
request.
By failing to clearly explain the reasons
for not fully endorsing the AASA Special
Fee, an ungrounded bias is being presented
to the voting public.
Along with the power of influencing vot
ers through endorsements. The Daily
should also fulfill its responsibility of edu
cating voters to make clearly informed
choices.

SSAE corrects errors
Have you ever been in a room and felt
that nobody was listening to you? Last Fri
day, I helped make the endorsement pre
sentation for the Stanford Society of Asian
American Engineers (SSAE) to the Stan
ford Daily. 1 preface this by noting that the
facts I refer to below were explicitly out
lined during the course of that presentation.
Printed materials were also left for The
Daily after that presentation that explicitly
outlined these facts. The factual and posi
tional inconsistencies in The Daily's final
endorsement for SSAE lead me to question
the validity of The Daily's endorsement of
organizations applying for special fees.
By far the most flagrant error is The
Daily's statement that "Many SSAE events
are not free to all Stanford students." We
were explicitly asked about this by the
endorsement board during our presenta
tion. As we pointed out, SSAE runs five
programs; four of these are totally free to all
Stanford students. How did The Daily man
age to construe one out of five as being
"many"?
The Daily also claims that SSAE
"includes many graduate students". But 80
percent of applicants to the Stanford Asia
Technology Initiative were undergraduates.
More than 90 percent of submissions to the
Corporate Guide and attendees at the
SSAE Corporate Night were undergradu
ates. One out of 12 SSAE officers is a grad
uate student. There are other misrepresen
tations, but 1 will restrict myself to noting
that these concerns were raised and
addressed during our endorsement presen
tation, and it remains a mystery to us how
The Daily obtained its information.
More saddening, at any rate, is the heavy
criticism we have received for our efforts to
secure funding this year. We expended a
huge amount of effort in securing funding to
minimize any future dependence upon spe
cial fees. Our proposed budget this year is
46 precent ($18,000) funded from outside
sources; this does not include equipment
donations and travel sponsorship for the
Stanford Asia Technology Initiative, which
have a present value of approximately
$10,(XX). Particularly for a new organization,
we believed that the success of our fundrais
ing effort would be construed as evidence of
fiscal and constitutional responsibility, par
ticularly in light of the criticisms leveled at
other organizations for failing to obtain out
side funding. The Daily, however, has cho
sen to criticize this effort by claiming that
we "rightfully should" have obtained this
funding.
We do not contest The Daily's right to
judge us in this fashion. We do question its
consistency, however, when The Daily
praises numerous organizations for having
sought outside funding, several of which are
funded by outside sources in a significantly
lower proportion than we are.
It is very disheartening to dedicate a big
part of yourself to something and then
watch it criticized on the basis of distorted
information and biased opinions. We hope

this letter clarifies some of our positions and
helps to call into question the standards by
which The Daily judges student organiza
tions petitioning for the ASSU special lee.

Candidate explains flyers
1 am writing in response to I imothy
Fisher's letter regarding the emptiness of
my campaign livers. You might be surprised
to learn that 1 agree with him.
I decided upon the design of my flyers
only after a painful period of careful consid
eration. I initially hoped to design a flyer
that would convey all of the thoughts and
feelings that provoked me to run for ASSU
Senate.
Unfortunately, such a flyer would never
be read.
Who would take the time to discover
that I want to force Residential Education
to justify its policies with position papers
which would be open to critique by the stu
dent body, thereby allowing the students to
influence the forms in which their education
is provided?
We, the students are buying our educa
tion from the University, and we are not
being given the service we deserve. I he cus
tomer IS always right. We are adults yet we
allow ourselves to be treated like kinder
garteners, told by our teachers what is best
for us.
The result of the student body's unwill
ingness to read such an informative flyer
leads to a situation in which the most that a
candidate can hope for is that students take
three seconds to glance at their flyer in
search of a cheap (very cheap) laugh. Thus
the "eyesore," which Fisher and I both
detest, is spawned.
Faced with this reality, I resolved to give
the student body that cheap laugh. Even
after 1 had made this resolution. I was
unsure of how to achieve that end. 1 tried to
get into the heads of the Stanford masses,
and I realized how little I know about the
people around me. I was unsure of what
they would find humorous.
This feeling of isolation is central to the
campaign of Romahlo Wilson. I mention
him because he was the only candidate with
the courage to compose a flyer that did try
to espouse his views and reasons for run
ning for the Senate. Consequently, he is the
only candidate, other than myself, for whom
I intend to vote in the Senatorial election.
If I admire his courage, why did I end up
with the flyer that is posted all over cam
pus? It was the 11th hour, and I was search
ing for something that would produce a
cheap laugh while also giving the student
body an idea of the spirit in which I am run
ning.
Flipping through my photo album, I
came across the photograph which graces
my flyers. It was taken at Big Game last
year. I thought it might provide the cheap
laugh for which I had been searching. I
think it has. As for the caption, "Mike Sloan
knows how to take care of business." it does
not refer to my abilities as a student, admin
istrator or representative of the student
body. Rather, it refers to the way in which I
live my life; without limits.
The picture illustrates this aspect of my
character, and I feel this quality is central to
good leadership.
The ASSU has been dominated for too
long by men and women who are a little too
aware of what they can and cannot do. As
for me, I have no idea what a ASSU senator
is and is not supposed to do. I know about
and care only for what 1 intend to do.

SEAS information incomplete
The endorsement for SEAS (Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford)
neglected to mention most of SEAS's activ
ities and gave us credit for some things we
didn't do.
This year, SEAS: filled Kresge Auditori
um twice, once for UFW co-founder
Dolores Huerta (in coalition with MEChA)
and once for Kevin Danaher, founder of
Global Exchange; livened up the Coffee
House with singer activist Casey Neill; led
dorm presentations about corporate
responsibility; co-sponsored the Grassroots
Organizing Weekend (GROW); supported
an East Palo Alto effort to prevent a
cement plant from entering their communi
ty; and presented proposals to and worked
with the Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility (APIR). SEAS also funds
and organizes the dorm environmental rep
resentatives.
SEAS has also worked with MEChA,
SLAC (Stanford Labor Action Coalition)
and the NAACP.
SEAS did not produce the Dis-Orienta
tion Guide. SEAS helped fund the Guide
and members contributed to it, but many
other folks made it happen. E-mail
diso@lorax.org to get your own copy. SEAS
also didn't provide Toxics Tours of East
Palo Alto. SEAS has gone on Toxics Tours,
but they are led by YUCA, a group of EPA
youth organizing against toxics in EPA.
That's what we've done (and not done).
You can make your own decision about

Film Society makes correction
We want to thank The Daily for pointing
out some of the important contributions the
Stanford Film Society has made to the Stan
ford community; however, we would like to
correct some of The Daily's comments in
the ASSU endorsement section.
The Daily stated that only a small frac
tion of the SFS operating budget comes
from sources outside of special fees. That is
not entirely true.
In addition to the approximately $1,5(X)
that we receive from ticket sales from grad
uate students and the general public, we
also receive donations and financial help
from other groups on and off campus. This
year, outside donations to the United
Nations Film Association Film Festival
(held during fall quarter) amounted to
approximately $6,.5(H). Next year we expect
much more as both Ted Turner and Robert
Redlbrd will be involved with the event.
The Daily also suggested that we should
reduce our costs. Unfortunately many of
the costs of showing films on campus are
fixed, such as tech services fees, some film

rentals and advertising. We have, however,
been able to get many filmmakers to waive
their speaker's fees and / or film rental fees.
SFS only asks for $5.02 from undergrad
uates and in return offers students opportu
nities to make films through our film grants,
learn about filmmaking and discuss film
through our Undergraduate Film Work
shop, come to weekly film series, see films
in 35mm for free and meet and discuss films
with their creators.
When considering the SFS special fee,
please note that SFS helps other student
groups show films on campus. By co-spon
soring events with groups such as Hillel,
BSA, LGBCC and A3C, we have allowed
these groups to hold provocative film
events.
Because we have been getting special
fee funding, all of our events are free to
undergraduates; we would hate to have to
change this. When you vote for special fees,
remember the $7.50 you pay each time you
see a movie at a theater when you don't get
to discuss the film with its director after the
screening.

Tell us what was lacking
The efforts of The Daily's editorial
board to educate Stanford students about
the election prior to voting are admirable.
As the dominant communication medium
on the Stanford campus, The Daily is in a
unique position and wields considerable
influence through its endorsements. How
ever, by failing to clearly explain the ways in
which special-fee groups fall short of specif
ic criteria, The Daily performs a disservice
to the voting public by providing a judge
ment based upon incomplete knowledge
and understanding.
While the 4 rating that A ASA, the Asian
American Students Association, received in
The Daily endorsement is excellent, we
would like to point out the inadequacy of
this rating based on the fact that the Daily's
editorial board failed to point out any areas
in which AASA failed to meet the criteria
of the 5 rating.
If an organization is given a rating of less
than 5, there should be some explanation of
its shortcomings. However, based on The
Daily's comments regarding the AASA
Special Fee, there is absolutely no indica
tion of any failure to meet the endorsement
criteria. In fact the Daily editorial board
clearly emphasized the strength of the
AASA Special Fee by stating that "AASA
has worked hard to keep its budget down —
increasing its fee request from 1998-99 by
less than 1 percent — and has shown a good
understanding of its constituency by exclud
ing a graduate-student-focused group from
under its umbrella."
Furthermore, in accordance with The
Daily's explanation of its rating scale,
AASA and the 11 other groups under the
AASA special fee have successfully met all
goals for the previous year.
While many groups fill a unique role on
campus, this is especially true for AASA, as
well as the other ethnic community groups.
The Asian American cultural programming
funded by the AASA Special Fee con
tributes significantly to diversity at Stanford
and enriches the experience of the entire
student body.
AASA annually reviews all of its pro
grams, looking for areas of improvement
and is constantly searching for new ways to
serve the Stanford community. The AASA
special fee is re-evaluated annually to allow
for the expansion of existing programs and
the creation of new events such as this
year's voter registration drive during fall
quarter and the Asian American film series.

AASA's budget is consistently among the
most organized and streamlined, which is
reflected in the minimal increase of 0.85
percent in the amount of the special-fee
request.
By failing to clearly explain the reasons
for not fully endorsing the AASA Special
Fee, an ungrounded bias is being presented
to the voting public.
Along with the power of influencing vot
ers through endorsements. The Daily
should also fulfill its responsibility of edu
cating voters to make clearly informed
choices.

SSAE corrects errors
Have you ever been in a room and felt
that nobody was listening to you? Last Fri
day, I helped make the endorsement pre
sentation for the Stanford Society of Asian
American Engineers (SSAE) to the Stan
ford Daily. 1 preface this by noting that the
facts I refer to below were explicitly out
lined during the course of that presentation.
Printed materials were also left for The
Daily after that presentation that explicitly
outlined these facts. The factual and posi
tional inconsistencies in The Daily's final
endorsement for SSAE lead me to question
the validity of The Daily's endorsement of
organizations applying for special fees.
By far the most flagrant error is The
Daily's statement that "Many SSAE events
are not free to all Stanford students." We
were explicitly asked about this by the
endorsement board during our presenta
tion. As we pointed out, SSAE runs five
programs; four of these are totally free to all
Stanford students. How did The Daily man
age to construe one out of five as being
"many"?
The Daily also claims that SSAE
"includes many graduate students". But 80
percent of applicants to the Stanford Asia
Technology Initiative were undergraduates.
More than 90 percent of submissions to the
Corporate Guide and attendees at the
SSAE Corporate Night were undergradu
ates. One out of 12 SSAE officers is a grad
uate student. There are other misrepresen
tations, but 1 will restrict myself to noting
that these concerns were raised and
addressed during our endorsement presen
tation, and it remains a mystery to us how
The Daily obtained its information.
More saddening, at any rate, is the heavy
criticism we have received for our efforts to
secure funding this year. We expended a
huge amount of effort in securing funding to
minimize any future dependence upon spe
cial fees. Our proposed budget this year is
46 precent ($18,000) funded from outside
sources; this does not include equipment
donations and travel sponsorship for the
Stanford Asia Technology Initiative, which
have a present value of approximately
$10,(XX). Particularly for a new organization,
we believed that the success of our fundrais
ing effort would be construed as evidence of
fiscal and constitutional responsibility, par
ticularly in light of the criticisms leveled at
other organizations for failing to obtain out
side funding. The Daily, however, has cho
sen to criticize this effort by claiming that
we "rightfully should" have obtained this
funding.
We do not contest The Daily's right to
judge us in this fashion. We do question its
consistency, however, when The Daily
praises numerous organizations for having
sought outside funding, several of which are
funded by outside sources in a significantly
lower proportion than we are.
It is very disheartening to dedicate a big
part of yourself to something and then
watch it criticized on the basis of distorted
information and biased opinions. We hope

this letter clarifies some of our positions and
helps to call into question the standards by
which The Daily judges student organiza
tions petitioning for the ASSU special lee.

Stanford Society of Asian American Engineers
Candidate explains flyers
1 am writing in response to I imothy
Fisher's letter regarding the emptiness of
my campaign livers. You might be surprised
to learn that 1 agree with him.
I decided upon the design of my flyers
only after a painful period of careful consid
eration. I initially hoped to design a flyer
that would convey all of the thoughts and
feelings that provoked me to run for ASSU
Senate.
Unfortunately, such a flyer would never
be read.
Who would take the time to discover
that I want to force Residential Education
to justify its policies with position papers
which would be open to critique by the stu
dent body, thereby allowing the students to
influence the forms in which their education
is provided?
We, the students are buying our educa
tion from the University, and we are not
being given the service we deserve. I he cus
tomer IS always right. We are adults yet we
allow ourselves to be treated like kinder
garteners, told by our teachers what is best
for us.
The result of the student body's unwill
ingness to read such an informative flyer
leads to a situation in which the most that a
candidate can hope for is that students take
three seconds to glance at their flyer in
search of a cheap (very cheap) laugh. Thus
the "eyesore," which Fisher and I both
detest, is spawned.
Faced with this reality, I resolved to give
the student body that cheap laugh. Even
after 1 had made this resolution. I was
unsure of how to achieve that end. 1 tried to
get into the heads of the Stanford masses,
and I realized how little I know about the
people around me. I was unsure of what
they would find humorous.
This feeling of isolation is central to the
campaign of Romahlo Wilson. I mention
him because he was the only candidate with
the courage to compose a flyer that did try
to espouse his views and reasons for run
ning for the Senate. Consequently, he is the
only candidate, other than myself, for whom
I intend to vote in the Senatorial election.
If I admire his courage, why did I end up
with the flyer that is posted all over cam
pus? It was the 11th hour, and I was search
ing for something that would produce a
cheap laugh while also giving the student
body an idea of the spirit in which I am run
ning.
Flipping through my photo album, I
came across the photograph which graces
my flyers. It was taken at Big Game last
year. I thought it might provide the cheap
laugh for which I had been searching. I
think it has. As for the caption, "Mike Sloan
knows how to take care of business." it does
not refer to my abilities as a student, admin
istrator or representative of the student
body. Rather, it refers to the way in which I
live my life; without limits.
The picture illustrates this aspect of my
character, and I feel this quality is central to
good leadership.
The ASSU has been dominated for too
long by men and women who are a little too
aware of what they can and cannot do. As
for me, I have no idea what a ASSU senator
is and is not supposed to do. I know about
and care only for what 1 intend to do.

A holiday for Hoover
Stanford University is unique in that its
founder, Lcland Stanford, and its most illus
trious alumnus. Herbert Hoover, have been
targets of vilification.
The statuary group of the Stanford fami
ly, once the centerpiece of Memorial Court,
was demoted from one spot to another until
it was rescued from the University dump by
those of us who strive to be fair.
Meanwhile a bronze James B. Duke, the
benefactor (not the founder) of Duke Uni
versity, sits smugly smoking a very political
ly incorrect cigar in the main quad of the
University, basking in general respect.
Senator Stanford, an infinitely greater
man, was dismissed as a robber baron, and
his failure to hit the Golden Spike properly
added derision to hatred.
An American engineer, Henry Meiggs.
built the trans-Andean railroad, which goes
higher than any other standard-gauge rail
road in the world, a splendid feat that did
for Peru what the transcontinental railroad
did for the United States. Yet he too has
received the Stanford "robber baron" treat
ment. Men of achievement arouse the envy
of lesser men.
The Stanford administration has carried
out a brilliant public relations coup that is
beyond the means of scribblers of historical
justification.
It embellished Founders Day with an
impersonation of Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford by a charming couple, followed by a
free lunch. Well, there is no such thing as a
free lunch; the payment was gratitude to
Stanford's founders.

Herbert Hoover was one of America's
most noble presidents and also the most
self-made. His life was a tragedy. A Quaker
internationalist, he fought famine in war
torn Europe and later, as a pacifist, he
founded the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace. His presidency was
hit by the Depression, and he was shattered.
When I knew him he was an embittered old
man. ridiculed by faculty and students. The
I ioover lower was referred to as I toover's
last erection. He quit Stanford for West
Branch, lowa. The Hoover Institution,
which seems to have forgotten its original
mission, is generally viewed as the home of
right-wing, partisan economists.
The Hoover Institution's administration
should take a leaf from the I Jniversity. Cel
ebrate Herbert Hoover Day, with a charm
ing couple impersonating the Hoovers (Lou
Henry Hoover was a distinguished woman
in her own right), and after a ceremony
describing Hoover's work for peace, give
the assembly a free lunch. In the human
structure, the mind rests on the heart and
the heart on the stomach. It would be a win
win-win gesture.

Endorsement lacked information
We are concerned by The Daily's repre
sentation of the Barrio Assistance program
in yesterday's special-fee edition. Hardly
any information was given about our pro
gram. unlike most of the other endorse
ments. Because of the new campaign code

we arc unable to carry out many of the nor
mal campaign procedures, such as appear
ances at house meetings. Therefore we feel
it is a crucial part of The Daily's responsi
bility to the Stanford community to inform
them about the function of special-fee
groups.
Barrio Assistance is a literacy tutoring
program serving l X) Stanford students and
70 children from East Palo Alto and has
been in existence for 28 years. We are the
oldest student-run community service orga
nization on campus and thanks to the con
tinuing support of Stanford students, we
have maintained a solid base operation
while looking to outside funding for expan
sions and improvements to the program.
Three years ago we were able to increase
the program size by 60 percent, from 1(H)
people to 160, with no additional cost to
Stanford students. This continues to be true.
We are further disturbed by the seeming
misrepresentation of our finances in yester
day's Daily. The only significant change in
our special-fee budget, it is true, is the 3.70
percent drop in this year's budget. Howev
er, The Daily does not seem to realize that
we have drastically expanded the program
while continuing to request the same
amount of money. The endorsement reads,
"the group's budgets for the last several
years have all come almost entirely from its
special fee, and this year's budget continues
the pattern."
If The Daily would review the budgets
submitted by Barrio Assistance, they would
find that only 51 percent of our total budget,
including operations and capital improve
ments, comes from the Stanford communi

ty. Approximately $20,000 of a $41 ,(HK) bud
get comes from outside funding, specifically
Wells Fargo and the Stolsaftz Foundation.
The ASSIJ did not provide The Daily
with our grant budget, in addition to the
operating budget we submitted to the Spe
cial 112 ee Committee. All of our money for
books, computer software, summer support
salaries and other needed capital improve
ments comes from an outside source of
funding.
( ommunity service is an integral part of
student life here at Stanford. It offers Stan
ford students an opportunity to grow per
sonally by providing us with a chance to
expand our horizons, to develop communi
cation and leadership skills, to forge lasting
bonds with the outside community and is a
crucial complement lo our intellectual and
professional development. We are dis
turbed that Barrio Assistance has received a
lower rating than some organizations with
higher budgets and a much smaller target
community. Considering that we serve 90
members ol the Stanford community, have
reduced our budget significantly and that
both our members and your newspaper give
us high marks for the services we provide,
we feel that our endorsement was made
with inadequate information and does not
portray Barrio Assistance fairly.
We hope that The Daily will reassess its
position in light of this information.
Finally, we hope that Stanford students
will vote responsibly and support an organi
zation that not only benefits Stanford stu
dents but also looks outside our campus to
the surrounding communities and addresses
our responsibility to working towards posi
tive social change.

El-Amin is no saint after all
For those of you not up to date, Khalid
Kl-Amin was arrested yesterday for posses
sion of marijuana. Yes, the same El-Amin
who orchestrated the University of Con
necticut's win over the Cardinal in Maples
Pavilion on Feb. 6. The very same man
whom the 6th Man Club taunted merciless
ly throughout the game.
For weeks after the game, countless let
ters filled The Daily, chastising the 6th Man
Club for berating "a responsible father and
a model citizen." The value of the club was
called into question again, as it had been
last year, following the UCLA and Arizona
games. The members of 6th Man received
e-mails reminding them of the purpose of
the club and suggesting that it focus on pos
itive comments that make players feel warm
and fuzzy inside. Many of us were disap
pointed to learn that a letter was sent to El-
Amin and the University of Connecticut
Athletic Department on behalf of 6th Man,
apologizing for teasing such a fine young
man and begging for their forgiveness.
College basketball players are big boys
and, with the possible exception of the Uni
versity of Arizona, they should be smart
enough to realize that they are responsible
for their actions, on and off the court. The
price of being stars is that their lives become
the focus of public scrutiny and often
ridicule. Those are the breaks.
Stanford students are a spirited bunch,
and if we show our spirit in creative uses of
the word "bastard," then so much the bet
ter. The remarkable athletes we hurl these
insults at can certainly take it — if they can't
then they can go home and smoke a bowl
until they feel better about themselves. Just
don't get caught.
I do not regret teasing El-Amin or any
other player. Remember, sticks and stones
can break your bones, but words and laser
pointers only bug you. Taunting signs and
chants are funny, and they are also part of
the game. The players know it, so should
everybody else. We should not have to
apologize for having lun and trying to help
our team. My only regret is that we put
away Jelani McCoy's five-foot bomber joint
before we had the chance to use it again.

'Kids' portrayal was incorrect
In yesterday's endorsements section of
The Daily, the evaluation of Kids with
Dreams was positive, but it did not give a
complete portrayal of our goals in applying
for ASSII special fees.
Doubts were raised as to whether or not
our service organization would become
dependent on special fees as a source of con
tinual funding. We would like to dispel those
doubts by clarifying our use of these fees.
We have planned a project involving
Stanford students to integrate technology
into the classroom to enhance our efforts in
working with developmentally disabled
children. Outside sources of funding have
already been sought, and earlier this year,
we received a grant from Hewlett Packard
for seven laptop computers to bring into the
schools we volunteer at. Unfortunately,
despite a year of fundraising efforts, we still
need funding to install teaching software.
The money we receive from ASSI) spe
cial fees will be used in our project's first
year of implementation. ()ur operating fees

have always been covered by a quarterly
budget, approved by the ASSU Senate, sep
arate from special fees. We want to clarify
again that we will not be applying continu
ally for special fees to cover our regular
operating expenses.
Our main purpose in asking for this
funding is to initiate a program that will
greatly improve Stanford volunteers' efforts
in helping disabled children in the class

sen to criticize this effort by claiming that
we "rightfully should" have obtained this
funding.
We do not contest The Daily's right to
judge us in this fashion. We do question its
consistency, however, when The Daily
praises numerous organizations for having
sought outside funding, several of which are
funded by outside sources in a significantly
lower proportion than we are.
It is very disheartening to dedicate a big
part of yourself to something and then
watch it criticized on the basis of distorted
information and biased opinions. We hope

this letter clarifies some of our positions and
helps to call into question the standards by
which The Daily judges student organiza
tions petitioning for the ASSU special lee.

Candidate explains flyers
1 am writing in response to I imothy
Fisher's letter regarding the emptiness of
my campaign livers. You might be surprised
to learn that 1 agree with him.
I decided upon the design of my flyers
only after a painful period of careful consid
eration. I initially hoped to design a flyer
that would convey all of the thoughts and
feelings that provoked me to run for ASSU
Senate.
Unfortunately, such a flyer would never
be read.
Who would take the time to discover
that I want to force Residential Education
to justify its policies with position papers
which would be open to critique by the stu
dent body, thereby allowing the students to
influence the forms in which their education
is provided?
We, the students are buying our educa
tion from the University, and we are not
being given the service we deserve. I he cus
tomer IS always right. We are adults yet we
allow ourselves to be treated like kinder
garteners, told by our teachers what is best
for us.
The result of the student body's unwill
ingness to read such an informative flyer
leads to a situation in which the most that a
candidate can hope for is that students take
three seconds to glance at their flyer in
search of a cheap (very cheap) laugh. Thus
the "eyesore," which Fisher and I both
detest, is spawned.
Faced with this reality, I resolved to give
the student body that cheap laugh. Even
after 1 had made this resolution. I was
unsure of how to achieve that end. 1 tried to
get into the heads of the Stanford masses,
and I realized how little I know about the
people around me. I was unsure of what
they would find humorous.
This feeling of isolation is central to the
campaign of Romahlo Wilson. I mention
him because he was the only candidate with
the courage to compose a flyer that did try
to espouse his views and reasons for run
ning for the Senate. Consequently, he is the
only candidate, other than myself, for whom
I intend to vote in the Senatorial election.
If I admire his courage, why did I end up
with the flyer that is posted all over cam
pus? It was the 11th hour, and I was search
ing for something that would produce a
cheap laugh while also giving the student
body an idea of the spirit in which I am run
ning.
Flipping through my photo album, I
came across the photograph which graces
my flyers. It was taken at Big Game last
year. I thought it might provide the cheap
laugh for which I had been searching. I
think it has. As for the caption, "Mike Sloan
knows how to take care of business." it does
not refer to my abilities as a student, admin
istrator or representative of the student
body. Rather, it refers to the way in which I
live my life; without limits.
The picture illustrates this aspect of my
character, and I feel this quality is central to
good leadership.
The ASSU has been dominated for too
long by men and women who are a little too
aware of what they can and cannot do. As
for me, I have no idea what a ASSU senator
is and is not supposed to do. I know about
and care only for what 1 intend to do.

A holiday for Hoover
Stanford University is unique in that its
founder, Lcland Stanford, and its most illus
trious alumnus. Herbert Hoover, have been
targets of vilification.
The statuary group of the Stanford fami
ly, once the centerpiece of Memorial Court,
was demoted from one spot to another until
it was rescued from the University dump by
those of us who strive to be fair.
Meanwhile a bronze James B. Duke, the
benefactor (not the founder) of Duke Uni
versity, sits smugly smoking a very political
ly incorrect cigar in the main quad of the
University, basking in general respect.
Senator Stanford, an infinitely greater
man, was dismissed as a robber baron, and
his failure to hit the Golden Spike properly
added derision to hatred.
An American engineer, Henry Meiggs.
built the trans-Andean railroad, which goes
higher than any other standard-gauge rail
road in the world, a splendid feat that did
for Peru what the transcontinental railroad
did for the United States. Yet he too has
received the Stanford "robber baron" treat
ment. Men of achievement arouse the envy
of lesser men.
The Stanford administration has carried
out a brilliant public relations coup that is
beyond the means of scribblers of historical
justification.
It embellished Founders Day with an
impersonation of Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford by a charming couple, followed by a
free lunch. Well, there is no such thing as a
free lunch; the payment was gratitude to
Stanford's founders.

Herbert Hoover was one of America's
most noble presidents and also the most
self-made. His life was a tragedy. A Quaker
internationalist, he fought famine in war
torn Europe and later, as a pacifist, he
founded the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace. His presidency was
hit by the Depression, and he was shattered.
When I knew him he was an embittered old
man. ridiculed by faculty and students. The
I ioover lower was referred to as I toover's
last erection. He quit Stanford for West
Branch, lowa. The Hoover Institution,
which seems to have forgotten its original
mission, is generally viewed as the home of
right-wing, partisan economists.
The Hoover Institution's administration
should take a leaf from the I Jniversity. Cel
ebrate Herbert Hoover Day, with a charm
ing couple impersonating the Hoovers (Lou
Henry Hoover was a distinguished woman
in her own right), and after a ceremony
describing Hoover's work for peace, give
the assembly a free lunch. In the human
structure, the mind rests on the heart and
the heart on the stomach. It would be a win
win-win gesture.

Endorsement lacked information
We are concerned by The Daily's repre
sentation of the Barrio Assistance program
in yesterday's special-fee edition. Hardly
any information was given about our pro
gram. unlike most of the other endorse
ments. Because of the new campaign code

we arc unable to carry out many of the nor
mal campaign procedures, such as appear
ances at house meetings. Therefore we feel
it is a crucial part of The Daily's responsi
bility to the Stanford community to inform
them about the function of special-fee
groups.
Barrio Assistance is a literacy tutoring
program serving l X) Stanford students and
70 children from East Palo Alto and has
been in existence for 28 years. We are the
oldest student-run community service orga
nization on campus and thanks to the con
tinuing support of Stanford students, we
have maintained a solid base operation
while looking to outside funding for expan
sions and improvements to the program.
Three years ago we were able to increase
the program size by 60 percent, from 1(H)
people to 160, with no additional cost to
Stanford students. This continues to be true.
We are further disturbed by the seeming
misrepresentation of our finances in yester
day's Daily. The only significant change in
our special-fee budget, it is true, is the 3.70
percent drop in this year's budget. Howev
er, The Daily does not seem to realize that
we have drastically expanded the program
while continuing to request the same
amount of money. The endorsement reads,
"the group's budgets for the last several
years have all come almost entirely from its
special fee, and this year's budget continues
the pattern."
If The Daily would review the budgets
submitted by Barrio Assistance, they would
find that only 51 percent of our total budget,
including operations and capital improve
ments, comes from the Stanford communi

ty. Approximately $20,000 of a $41 ,(HK) bud
get comes from outside funding, specifically
Wells Fargo and the Stolsaftz Foundation.
The ASSIJ did not provide The Daily
with our grant budget, in addition to the
operating budget we submitted to the Spe
cial 112 ee Committee. All of our money for
books, computer software, summer support
salaries and other needed capital improve
ments comes from an outside source of
funding.
( ommunity service is an integral part of
student life here at Stanford. It offers Stan
ford students an opportunity to grow per
sonally by providing us with a chance to
expand our horizons, to develop communi
cation and leadership skills, to forge lasting
bonds with the outside community and is a
crucial complement lo our intellectual and
professional development. We are dis
turbed that Barrio Assistance has received a
lower rating than some organizations with
higher budgets and a much smaller target
community. Considering that we serve 90
members ol the Stanford community, have
reduced our budget significantly and that
both our members and your newspaper give
us high marks for the services we provide,
we feel that our endorsement was made
with inadequate information and does not
portray Barrio Assistance fairly.
We hope that The Daily will reassess its
position in light of this information.
Finally, we hope that Stanford students
will vote responsibly and support an organi
zation that not only benefits Stanford stu
dents but also looks outside our campus to
the surrounding communities and addresses
our responsibility to working towards posi
tive social change.

El-Amin is no saint after all
For those of you not up to date, Khalid
Kl-Amin was arrested yesterday for posses
sion of marijuana. Yes, the same El-Amin
who orchestrated the University of Con
necticut's win over the Cardinal in Maples
Pavilion on Feb. 6. The very same man
whom the 6th Man Club taunted merciless
ly throughout the game.
For weeks after the game, countless let
ters filled The Daily, chastising the 6th Man
Club for berating "a responsible father and
a model citizen." The value of the club was
called into question again, as it had been
last year, following the UCLA and Arizona
games. The members of 6th Man received
e-mails reminding them of the purpose of
the club and suggesting that it focus on pos
itive comments that make players feel warm
and fuzzy inside. Many of us were disap
pointed to learn that a letter was sent to El-
Amin and the University of Connecticut
Athletic Department on behalf of 6th Man,
apologizing for teasing such a fine young
man and begging for their forgiveness.
College basketball players are big boys
and, with the possible exception of the Uni
versity of Arizona, they should be smart
enough to realize that they are responsible
for their actions, on and off the court. The
price of being stars is that their lives become
the focus of public scrutiny and often
ridicule. Those are the breaks.
Stanford students are a spirited bunch,
and if we show our spirit in creative uses of
the word "bastard," then so much the bet
ter. The remarkable athletes we hurl these
insults at can certainly take it — if they can't
then they can go home and smoke a bowl
until they feel better about themselves. Just
don't get caught.
I do not regret teasing El-Amin or any
other player. Remember, sticks and stones
can break your bones, but words and laser
pointers only bug you. Taunting signs and
chants are funny, and they are also part of
the game. The players know it, so should
everybody else. We should not have to
apologize for having lun and trying to help
our team. My only regret is that we put
away Jelani McCoy's five-foot bomber joint
before we had the chance to use it again.

'Kids' portrayal was incorrect
In yesterday's endorsements section of
The Daily, the evaluation of Kids with
Dreams was positive, but it did not give a
complete portrayal of our goals in applying
for ASSII special fees.
Doubts were raised as to whether or not
our service organization would become
dependent on special fees as a source of con
tinual funding. We would like to dispel those
doubts by clarifying our use of these fees.
We have planned a project involving
Stanford students to integrate technology
into the classroom to enhance our efforts in
working with developmentally disabled
children. Outside sources of funding have
already been sought, and earlier this year,
we received a grant from Hewlett Packard
for seven laptop computers to bring into the
schools we volunteer at. Unfortunately,
despite a year of fundraising efforts, we still
need funding to install teaching software.
The money we receive from ASSI) spe
cial fees will be used in our project's first
year of implementation. ()ur operating fees

have always been covered by a quarterly
budget, approved by the ASSU Senate, sep
arate from special fees. We want to clarify
again that we will not be applying continu
ally for special fees to cover our regular
operating expenses.
Our main purpose in asking for this
funding is to initiate a program that will
greatly improve Stanford volunteers' efforts
in helping disabled children in the class
room setting.

SEAS information incomplete
The endorsement for SEAS (Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford)
neglected to mention most of SEAS's activ
ities and gave us credit for some things we
didn't do.
This year, SEAS: filled Kresge Auditori
um twice, once for UFW co-founder
Dolores Huerta (in coalition with MEChA)
and once for Kevin Danaher, founder of
Global Exchange; livened up the Coffee
House with singer activist Casey Neill; led
dorm presentations about corporate
responsibility; co-sponsored the Grassroots
Organizing Weekend (GROW); supported
an East Palo Alto effort to prevent a
cement plant from entering their communi
ty; and presented proposals to and worked
with the Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility (APIR). SEAS also funds
and organizes the dorm environmental rep
resentatives.
SEAS has also worked with MEChA,
SLAC (Stanford Labor Action Coalition)
and the NAACP.
SEAS did not produce the Dis-Orienta
tion Guide. SEAS helped fund the Guide
and members contributed to it, but many
other folks made it happen. E-mail
diso@lorax.org to get your own copy. SEAS
also didn't provide Toxics Tours of East
Palo Alto. SEAS has gone on Toxics Tours,
but they are led by YUCA, a group of EPA
youth organizing against toxics in EPA.
That's what we've done (and not done).
You can make your own decision about
whether to vote for us.

Film Society makes correction
We want to thank The Daily for pointing
out some of the important contributions the
Stanford Film Society has made to the Stan
ford community; however, we would like to
correct some of The Daily's comments in
the ASSU endorsement section.
The Daily stated that only a small frac
tion of the SFS operating budget comes
from sources outside of special fees. That is
not entirely true.
In addition to the approximately $1,5(X)
that we receive from ticket sales from grad
uate students and the general public, we
also receive donations and financial help
from other groups on and off campus. This
year, outside donations to the United
Nations Film Association Film Festival
(held during fall quarter) amounted to
approximately $6,.5(H). Next year we expect
much more as both Ted Turner and Robert
Redlbrd will be involved with the event.
The Daily also suggested that we should
reduce our costs. Unfortunately many of
the costs of showing films on campus are
fixed, such as tech services fees, some film

rentals and advertising. We have, however,
been able to get many filmmakers to waive
their speaker's fees and / or film rental fees.
SFS only asks for $5.02 from undergrad
uates and in return offers students opportu
nities to make films through our film grants,
learn about filmmaking and discuss film
through our Undergraduate Film Work
shop, come to weekly film series, see films
in 35mm for free and meet and discuss films
with their creators.
When considering the SFS special fee,
please note that SFS helps other student
groups show films on campus. By co-spon
soring events with groups such as Hillel,
BSA, LGBCC and A3C, we have allowed
these groups to hold provocative film
events.
Because we have been getting special
fee funding, all of our events are free to
undergraduates; we would hate to have to
change this. When you vote for special fees,
remember the $7.50 you pay each time you
see a movie at a theater when you don't get
to discuss the film with its director after the
screening.

Tell us what was lacking
The efforts of The Daily's editorial
board to educate Stanford students about
the election prior to voting are admirable.
As the dominant communication medium
on the Stanford campus, The Daily is in a
unique position and wields considerable
influence through its endorsements. How
ever, by failing to clearly explain the ways in
which special-fee groups fall short of specif
ic criteria, The Daily performs a disservice
to the voting public by providing a judge
ment based upon incomplete knowledge
and understanding.
While the 4 rating that A ASA, the Asian
American Students Association, received in
The Daily endorsement is excellent, we
would like to point out the inadequacy of
this rating based on the fact that the Daily's
editorial board failed to point out any areas
in which AASA failed to meet the criteria
of the 5 rating.
If an organization is given a rating of less
than 5, there should be some explanation of
its shortcomings. However, based on The
Daily's comments regarding the AASA
Special Fee, there is absolutely no indica
tion of any failure to meet the endorsement
criteria. In fact the Daily editorial board
clearly emphasized the strength of the
AASA Special Fee by stating that "AASA
has worked hard to keep its budget down —
increasing its fee request from 1998-99 by
less than 1 percent — and has shown a good
understanding of its constituency by exclud
ing a graduate-student-focused group from
under its umbrella."
Furthermore, in accordance with The
Daily's explanation of its rating scale,
AASA and the 11 other groups under the
AASA special fee have successfully met all
goals for the previous year.
While many groups fill a unique role on
campus, this is especially true for AASA, as
well as the other ethnic community groups.
The Asian American cultural programming
funded by the AASA Special Fee con
tributes significantly to diversity at Stanford
and enriches the experience of the entire
student body.
AASA annually reviews all of its pro
grams, looking for areas of improvement
and is constantly searching for new ways to
serve the Stanford community. The AASA
special fee is re-evaluated annually to allow
for the expansion of existing programs and
the creation of new events such as this
year's voter registration drive during fall
quarter and the Asian American film series.

AASA's budget is consistently among the
most organized and streamlined, which is
reflected in the minimal increase of 0.85
percent in the amount of the special-fee
request.
By failing to clearly explain the reasons
for not fully endorsing the AASA Special
Fee, an ungrounded bias is being presented
to the voting public.
Along with the power of influencing vot
ers through endorsements. The Daily
should also fulfill its responsibility of edu
cating voters to make clearly informed
choices.

SSAE corrects errors
Have you ever been in a room and felt
that nobody was listening to you? Last Fri
day, I helped make the endorsement pre
sentation for the Stanford Society of Asian
American Engineers (SSAE) to the Stan
ford Daily. 1 preface this by noting that the
facts I refer to below were explicitly out
lined during the course of that presentation.
Printed materials were also left for The
Daily after that presentation that explicitly
outlined these facts. The factual and posi
tional inconsistencies in The Daily's final
endorsement for SSAE lead me to question
the validity of The Daily's endorsement of
organizations applying for special fees.
By far the most flagrant error is The
Daily's statement that "Many SSAE events
are not free to all Stanford students." We
were explicitly asked about this by the
endorsement board during our presenta
tion. As we pointed out, SSAE runs five
programs; four of these are totally free to all
Stanford students. How did The Daily man
age to construe one out of five as being
"many"?
The Daily also claims that SSAE
"includes many graduate students". But 80
percent of applicants to the Stanford Asia
Technology Initiative were undergraduates.
More than 90 percent of submissions to the
Corporate Guide and attendees at the
SSAE Corporate Night were undergradu
ates. One out of 12 SSAE officers is a grad
uate student. There are other misrepresen
tations, but 1 will restrict myself to noting
that these concerns were raised and
addressed during our endorsement presen
tation, and it remains a mystery to us how
The Daily obtained its information.
More saddening, at any rate, is the heavy
criticism we have received for our efforts to
secure funding this year. We expended a
huge amount of effort in securing funding to
minimize any future dependence upon spe
cial fees. Our proposed budget this year is
46 precent ($18,000) funded from outside
sources; this does not include equipment
donations and travel sponsorship for the
Stanford Asia Technology Initiative, which
have a present value of approximately
$10,(XX). Particularly for a new organization,
we believed that the success of our fundrais
ing effort would be construed as evidence of
fiscal and constitutional responsibility, par
ticularly in light of the criticisms leveled at
other organizations for failing to obtain out
side funding. The Daily, however, has cho
sen to criticize this effort by claiming that
we "rightfully should" have obtained this
funding.
We do not contest The Daily's right to
judge us in this fashion. We do question its
consistency, however, when The Daily
praises numerous organizations for having
sought outside funding, several of which are
funded by outside sources in a significantly
lower proportion than we are.
It is very disheartening to dedicate a big
part of yourself to something and then
watch it criticized on the basis of distorted
information and biased opinions. We hope

this letter clarifies some of our positions and
helps to call into question the standards by
which The Daily judges student organiza
tions petitioning for the ASSU special lee.

turbed that Barrio Assistance has received a
lower rating than some organizations with
higher budgets and a much smaller target
community. Considering that we serve 90
members ol the Stanford community, have
reduced our budget significantly and that
both our members and your newspaper give
us high marks for the services we provide,
we feel that our endorsement was made
with inadequate information and does not
portray Barrio Assistance fairly.
We hope that The Daily will reassess its
position in light of this information.
Finally, we hope that Stanford students
will vote responsibly and support an organi
zation that not only benefits Stanford stu
dents but also looks outside our campus to
the surrounding communities and addresses
our responsibility to working towards posi
tive social change.

El-Amin is no saint after all
For those of you not up to date, Khalid
Kl-Amin was arrested yesterday for posses
sion of marijuana. Yes, the same El-Amin
who orchestrated the University of Con
necticut's win over the Cardinal in Maples
Pavilion on Feb. 6. The very same man
whom the 6th Man Club taunted merciless
ly throughout the game.
For weeks after the game, countless let
ters filled The Daily, chastising the 6th Man
Club for berating "a responsible father and
a model citizen." The value of the club was
called into question again, as it had been
last year, following the UCLA and Arizona
games. The members of 6th Man received
e-mails reminding them of the purpose of
the club and suggesting that it focus on pos
itive comments that make players feel warm
and fuzzy inside. Many of us were disap
pointed to learn that a letter was sent to El-
Amin and the University of Connecticut
Athletic Department on behalf of 6th Man,
apologizing for teasing such a fine young
man and begging for their forgiveness.
College basketball players are big boys
and, with the possible exception of the Uni
versity of Arizona, they should be smart
enough to realize that they are responsible
for their actions, on and off the court. The
price of being stars is that their lives become
the focus of public scrutiny and often
ridicule. Those are the breaks.
Stanford students are a spirited bunch,
and if we show our spirit in creative uses of
the word "bastard," then so much the bet
ter. The remarkable athletes we hurl these
insults at can certainly take it — if they can't
then they can go home and smoke a bowl
until they feel better about themselves. Just
don't get caught.
I do not regret teasing El-Amin or any
other player. Remember, sticks and stones
can break your bones, but words and laser
pointers only bug you. Taunting signs and
chants are funny, and they are also part of
the game. The players know it, so should
everybody else. We should not have to
apologize for having lun and trying to help
our team. My only regret is that we put
away Jelani McCoy's five-foot bomber joint
before we had the chance to use it again.

'Kids' portrayal was incorrect
In yesterday's endorsements section of
The Daily, the evaluation of Kids with
Dreams was positive, but it did not give a
complete portrayal of our goals in applying
for ASSII special fees.
Doubts were raised as to whether or not
our service organization would become
dependent on special fees as a source of con
tinual funding. We would like to dispel those
doubts by clarifying our use of these fees.
We have planned a project involving
Stanford students to integrate technology
into the classroom to enhance our efforts in
working with developmentally disabled
children. Outside sources of funding have
already been sought, and earlier this year,
we received a grant from Hewlett Packard
for seven laptop computers to bring into the
schools we volunteer at. Unfortunately,
despite a year of fundraising efforts, we still
need funding to install teaching software.
The money we receive from ASSI) spe
cial fees will be used in our project's first
year of implementation. ()ur operating fees

have always been covered by a quarterly
budget, approved by the ASSU Senate, sep
arate from special fees. We want to clarify
again that we will not be applying continu
ally for special fees to cover our regular
operating expenses.
Our main purpose in asking for this
funding is to initiate a program that will
greatly improve Stanford volunteers' efforts
in helping disabled children in the class
room setting.

SEAS information incomplete
The endorsement for SEAS (Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford)
neglected to mention most of SEAS's activ
ities and gave us credit for some things we
didn't do.
This year, SEAS: filled Kresge Auditori
um twice, once for UFW co-founder
Dolores Huerta (in coalition with MEChA)
and once for Kevin Danaher, founder of
Global Exchange; livened up the Coffee
House with singer activist Casey Neill; led
dorm presentations about corporate
responsibility; co-sponsored the Grassroots
Organizing Weekend (GROW); supported
an East Palo Alto effort to prevent a
cement plant from entering their communi
ty; and presented proposals to and worked
with the Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility (APIR). SEAS also funds
and organizes the dorm environmental rep
resentatives.
SEAS has also worked with MEChA,
SLAC (Stanford Labor Action Coalition)
and the NAACP.
SEAS did not produce the Dis-Orienta
tion Guide. SEAS helped fund the Guide
and members contributed to it, but many
other folks made it happen. E-mail
diso@lorax.org to get your own copy. SEAS
also didn't provide Toxics Tours of East
Palo Alto. SEAS has gone on Toxics Tours,
but they are led by YUCA, a group of EPA
youth organizing against toxics in EPA.
That's what we've done (and not done).
You can make your own decision about
whether to vote for us.

Film Society makes correction
We want to thank The Daily for pointing
out some of the important contributions the
Stanford Film Society has made to the Stan
ford community; however, we would like to
correct some of The Daily's comments in
the ASSU endorsement section.
The Daily stated that only a small frac
tion of the SFS operating budget comes
from sources outside of special fees. That is
not entirely true.
In addition to the approximately $1,5(X)
that we receive from ticket sales from grad
uate students and the general public, we
also receive donations and financial help
from other groups on and off campus. This
year, outside donations to the United
Nations Film Association Film Festival
(held during fall quarter) amounted to
approximately $6,.5(H). Next year we expect
much more as both Ted Turner and Robert
Redlbrd will be involved with the event.
The Daily also suggested that we should
reduce our costs. Unfortunately many of
the costs of showing films on campus are
fixed, such as tech services fees, some film

rentals and advertising. We have, however,
been able to get many filmmakers to waive
their speaker's fees and / or film rental fees.
SFS only asks for $5.02 from undergrad
uates and in return offers students opportu
nities to make films through our film grants,
learn about filmmaking and discuss film
through our Undergraduate Film Work
shop, come to weekly film series, see films
in 35mm for free and meet and discuss films
with their creators.
When considering the SFS special fee,
please note that SFS helps other student
groups show films on campus. By co-spon
soring events with groups such as Hillel,
BSA, LGBCC and A3C, we have allowed
these groups to hold provocative film
events.
Because we have been getting special
fee funding, all of our events are free to
undergraduates; we would hate to have to
change this. When you vote for special fees,
remember the $7.50 you pay each time you
see a movie at a theater when you don't get
to discuss the film with its director after the
screening.

Tell us what was lacking
The efforts of The Daily's editorial
board to educate Stanford students about
the election prior to voting are admirable.
As the dominant communication medium
on the Stanford campus, The Daily is in a
unique position and wields considerable
influence through its endorsements. How
ever, by failing to clearly explain the ways in
which special-fee groups fall short of specif
ic criteria, The Daily performs a disservice
to the voting public by providing a judge
ment based upon incomplete knowledge
and understanding.
While the 4 rating that A ASA, the Asian
American Students Association, received in
The Daily endorsement is excellent, we
would like to point out the inadequacy of
this rating based on the fact that the Daily's
editorial board failed to point out any areas
in which AASA failed to meet the criteria
of the 5 rating.
If an organization is given a rating of less
than 5, there should be some explanation of
its shortcomings. However, based on The
Daily's comments regarding the AASA
Special Fee, there is absolutely no indica
tion of any failure to meet the endorsement
criteria. In fact the Daily editorial board
clearly emphasized the strength of the
AASA Special Fee by stating that "AASA
has worked hard to keep its budget down —
increasing its fee request from 1998-99 by
less than 1 percent — and has shown a good
understanding of its constituency by exclud
ing a graduate-student-focused group from
under its umbrella."
Furthermore, in accordance with The
Daily's explanation of its rating scale,
AASA and the 11 other groups under the
AASA special fee have successfully met all
goals for the previous year.
While many groups fill a unique role on
campus, this is especially true for AASA, as
well as the other ethnic community groups.
The Asian American cultural programming
funded by the AASA Special Fee con
tributes significantly to diversity at Stanford
and enriches the experience of the entire
student body.
AASA annually reviews all of its pro
grams, looking for areas of improvement
and is constantly searching for new ways to
serve the Stanford community. The AASA
special fee is re-evaluated annually to allow
for the expansion of existing programs and
the creation of new events such as this
year's voter registration drive during fall
quarter and the Asian American film series.

AASA's budget is consistently among the
most organized and streamlined, which is
reflected in the minimal increase of 0.85
percent in the amount of the special-fee
request.
By failing to clearly explain the reasons
for not fully endorsing the AASA Special
Fee, an ungrounded bias is being presented
to the voting public.
Along with the power of influencing vot
ers through endorsements. The Daily
should also fulfill its responsibility of edu
cating voters to make clearly informed
choices.

SSAE corrects errors
Have you ever been in a room and felt
that nobody was listening to you? Last Fri
day, I helped make the endorsement pre
sentation for the Stanford Society of Asian
American Engineers (SSAE) to the Stan
ford Daily. 1 preface this by noting that the
facts I refer to below were explicitly out
lined during the course of that presentation.
Printed materials were also left for The
Daily after that presentation that explicitly
outlined these facts. The factual and posi
tional inconsistencies in The Daily's final
endorsement for SSAE lead me to question
the validity of The Daily's endorsement of
organizations applying for special fees.
By far the most flagrant error is The
Daily's statement that "Many SSAE events
are not free to all Stanford students." We
were explicitly asked about this by the
endorsement board during our presenta
tion. As we pointed out, SSAE runs five
programs; four of these are totally free to all
Stanford students. How did The Daily man
age to construe one out of five as being
"many"?
The Daily also claims that SSAE
"includes many graduate students". But 80
percent of applicants to the Stanford Asia
Technology Initiative were undergraduates.
More than 90 percent of submissions to the
Corporate Guide and attendees at the
SSAE Corporate Night were undergradu
ates. One out of 12 SSAE officers is a grad
uate student. There are other misrepresen
tations, but 1 will restrict myself to noting
that these concerns were raised and
addressed during our endorsement presen
tation, and it remains a mystery to us how
The Daily obtained its information.
More saddening, at any rate, is the heavy
criticism we have received for our efforts to
secure funding this year. We expended a
huge amount of effort in securing funding to
minimize any future dependence upon spe
cial fees. Our proposed budget this year is
46 precent ($18,000) funded from outside
sources; this does not include equipment
donations and travel sponsorship for the
Stanford Asia Technology Initiative, which
have a present value of approximately
$10,(XX). Particularly for a new organization,
we believed that the success of our fundrais
ing effort would be construed as evidence of
fiscal and constitutional responsibility, par
ticularly in light of the criticisms leveled at
other organizations for failing to obtain out
side funding. The Daily, however, has cho
sen to criticize this effort by claiming that
we "rightfully should" have obtained this
funding.
We do not contest The Daily's right to
judge us in this fashion. We do question its
consistency, however, when The Daily
praises numerous organizations for having
sought outside funding, several of which are
funded by outside sources in a significantly
lower proportion than we are.
It is very disheartening to dedicate a big
part of yourself to something and then
watch it criticized on the basis of distorted
information and biased opinions. We hope

this letter clarifies some of our positions and
helps to call into question the standards by
which The Daily judges student organiza
tions petitioning for the ASSU special lee.

Candidate explains flyers
1 am writing in response to I imothy
Fisher's letter regarding the emptiness of
my campaign livers. You might be surprised
to learn that 1 agree with him.
I decided upon the design of my flyers
only after a painful period of careful consid
eration. I initially hoped to design a flyer
that would convey all of the thoughts and
feelings that provoked me to run for ASSU
Senate.
Unfortunately, such a flyer would never
be read.
Who would take the time to discover
that I want to force Residential Education
to justify its policies with position papers
which would be open to critique by the stu
dent body, thereby allowing the students to
influence the forms in which their education
is provided?
We, the students are buying our educa
tion from the University, and we are not
being given the service we deserve. I he cus
tomer IS always right. We are adults yet we
allow ourselves to be treated like kinder
garteners, told by our teachers what is best
for us.
The result of the student body's unwill
ingness to read such an informative flyer
leads to a situation in which the most that a
candidate can hope for is that students take
three seconds to glance at their flyer in
search of a cheap (very cheap) laugh. Thus
the "eyesore," which Fisher and I both
detest, is spawned.
Faced with this reality, I resolved to give
the student body that cheap laugh. Even
after 1 had made this resolution. I was
unsure of how to achieve that end. 1 tried to
get into the heads of the Stanford masses,
and I realized how little I know about the
people around me. I was unsure of what
they would find humorous.
This feeling of isolation is central to the
campaign of Romahlo Wilson. I mention
him because he was the only candidate with
the courage to compose a flyer that did try
to espouse his views and reasons for run
ning for the Senate. Consequently, he is the
only candidate, other than myself, for whom
I intend to vote in the Senatorial election.
If I admire his courage, why did I end up
with the flyer that is posted all over cam
pus? It was the 11th hour, and I was search
ing for something that would produce a
cheap laugh while also giving the student
body an idea of the spirit in which I am run
ning.
Flipping through my photo album, I
came across the photograph which graces
my flyers. It was taken at Big Game last
year. I thought it might provide the cheap
laugh for which I had been searching. I
think it has. As for the caption, "Mike Sloan
knows how to take care of business." it does
not refer to my abilities as a student, admin
istrator or representative of the student
body. Rather, it refers to the way in which I
live my life; without limits.
The picture illustrates this aspect of my
character, and I feel this quality is central to
good leadership.
The ASSU has been dominated for too
long by men and women who are a little too
aware of what they can and cannot do. As
for me, I have no idea what a ASSU senator
is and is not supposed to do. I know about
and care only for what 1 intend to do.
