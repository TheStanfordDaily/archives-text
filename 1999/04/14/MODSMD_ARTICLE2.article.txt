# Election rules frustrate candidates
## 
### Anuj Gupta Staff writer 
Students and student groups running in
the ASSU election have faced a stringent set
of rules and regulations during the past
week of campaigning that has drawn a
mixed reaction among candidates.
In particular criticism has centered on
flier restrictions and rules that have been
clarified or revoked in the middle of the
campaign.
"It would be better if the rules were a lit
tle more clear and explicit beforehand." said
freshman Kathy Huang, who is running on a
sophomore class president slate.
But sophomore Mike Levin, an ASSU
presidential candidate, said the aims of the
rules are reasonable.
"1 think what they've really tried to do is
clean up a lot of the nasty stuff that goes on
... and set the tone for all the candidates to
run fair, clean campaigns." Levin said.
All candidates running for office and stu
dent groups running for special fee approval
were expected to read the "Campaign Prac
tices Code," a detailed document that com
bines the elements of the ASSU Constitu
tion and Bylaws that deal with elections.
The code lists a series of specific regula
tions related to lliers and campaign materi
als. World Wide Web and e-mail campaign
ing, election day guidelines and campaign
spending limits.
As the elections hearings officer, sopho
more Katie Young enforces and interprets
the code. In the code's introduction she
writes, "I take this job very, very seriously.
Enfoicement will be swift and certain. My
goal is that in the end, [candidates] will feel
the election was run fairly."
According to Young, the penalties for vi
olations of any oft he campaign rules include
warnings, fines and possible disqualification
from the race.

Young has handled
all disputes and questions
and posts all her rulings
on a Web site for candi
dates to see. Rulings
begin to be enforced 24
hours after they are post
ed.
For example Young

had initially decided not to allow candidates
to campaign door-to-door in dormitories.
However, according to Levin. "A lot of
people complained that if you don't really
know enough people, you have to get out
door-to-door."
Thus Young reversed her initial decision
and opted to allow limited door-to-door
campaigning, though only between the
hours of noon and 10 p.m.
Such last-minute reversals and revisions
to rules have drawn fire from some candi
dates.
Huang complained that many rules have
been "decided ex post facto."
"(Young] doesn't know what we might
do in terms of campaigning," Huang said.
"A lot of rules she makes up are after some
thing has been done, and she decides that it
is not acceptable."
Huang pointed to the door-to-door rule
as an example of the several areas that "have
been totally neglected as far as being drawn
out" beforehand.
Young said Huang's criticism was inaccu
rate.
"When candidates have committed a vi
olation that is not explicit in the bylaws or
the Campaign Practices Code, there is no
penalty," she said. "I merely issue a ruling
that becomes effective within 24 hours.
Rules are not enforced retroactively."
Current ASSU Vice President Santos
Marroquin said it is the job of the hearings
officer to make rulings after violations have
been committed bv candidates.

"Stanford students are clever; they find
loopholes to get around certain rules, so
they don't break them," Marroquin said.
"[The Hearings (Officer] has to make rul
ings. because students don't get the ideas'*
behind the regulations, Marroquin added.
"It's a tough job to be the [officer] when
Stanford students are basically trying to
scam you."
Some candidates have also expressed a
sentiment that rules 011 placement of cam
paign fliers are too strict.
Sophomore Ethan Kurzweil. an ASSU
Senate candidate, said the new rules allow
fliers to only be placed where people can see
one big word, such as bollards and kiosks.
"It's making the campaign about who has
the best slogan, which is probably not the
way it should be." Kurzweil said.
Kur/weil said he believes that fliers
should be allowed to be placed in more
places that would allow for detailed exami
nation of a candidate's positions and plans.
"I think people should be able to distrib
ute their information a little more freely,
such as with fliers in bathroom stalls. Those
were the ones I read carefully last year." he
said.
Despite the criticisms, however, most
candidates seem to believe the rules are an
essential and generally positive part of the
campaign process.
Levin said that the sheer number of can
didates running necessitates restrictions on
flier placement. "As it is. we're at over 100
candidates including special fee groups.
With fliers everywhere we are definitely lit
tering the campus, and. if there were no
rules, it would just be totally out of hand," he
said.
Junior Adam Weiss, who is running for
ASSU president, said the restrictions have

said.
"We're not there yet. hut our ulti
mate goal ... is to ensure that the
campaign keeps the campus beauti
1111 and that candidates go out and in
teraet with the people that they want
to represent," Weiss added.
According to kur/weil. however,
campaign rules ought to be eased in

favor of an honor system campaign.
"I would hope that at Stanford
where you have the I lonorC ode and
the fundamental Standard, you
wouldn't need to make the rules a big
