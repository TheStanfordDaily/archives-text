## New and improved test tubes: artificial vesicles Zare's lab experiments with chemical reactions in lipid spheres 
### Matt Bell Contributing writer 
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare,
who is most lamous for discovering
evidence ol lossil life on a Martian
meteorite, is also investigating how
to make chemical reactions inside
artificial versions of tiny organic
containers called vesicles.
With enthusiasm, Zare said,
"We've made some new tools,"
although he cautioned that they are

only beginning to apply this tech
nique to problems in biology and
chemistry.
Naturally occuring vesicles are
cell-like enclosures that exist inside
other living cells. The surface of
each vesicle consists of the same
phospholipids that form the mem
branes of all cells. Although the
largest vesicles are the width of a
human hair, they can be 100 times
smaller. Vesicles are crucial to
many of the activities that keep

humans alive, including the release
of hormones, the breakdown of
infected and foreign material by
the immune system and the trans
mission of signals in the nervous
system.
Clyde Wilson, a chemistry grad
uate student working on the pro
ject, explained the artificial vesicles
that the lab created as, "lipid
spheres, just like cellular mem
branes. but eontain[ing| whatever
chemicals you put in them instead

of cellular contents, such as mito
chondria and nuclei."
Zare chose to perform chemical
reactions in artificial vesicles
because they offer an excellent way
of simulating the reactions that
occur in living cells. Ordinary test
tubes are often inadequate; the
reaction may proceed differently
depending on whether ii happens
inside a cell or in a test tube mil
lions of times larger. In addition, it
is often not feasible to perform
these reactions inside living cells,
since they contain manv other
chemicals that could disturb the
reaction being studied. Thus, an
artificial vesicle gives the best of
both worlds â€”it is both as con
trolled as a test tube and close to
the size of a real cell.
The vesicle-mixing process they
discovered is fairly straightforward.
1 irst, the vesicles are created sepa
rately through a ' process called
rotary evaporation that was adapt
ed for vesicle production by Zare's
lab. Then two vesicles are trans
ferred to the same location and
held in place using miniscule tubes
called holding pipettes. Next, two
small electrodes are used to zap the
vesicles with electric current. This
briefly disrupts the surfaces of the
vesicles, allowing the membrane to
reform into one large vesicle. The
joining process happens fast
enough that the contents of each
vesicle are transferred into the sin
gle large one.
This process was first tested
using fluorescent dyes. Two vesi
cles, each containing a separate
kind of dye, were fused. I he result
ing vesicle, as expected, contained
both dyes. Zare's team also sue

ccssfLilly observed a chemical reac
tion in a fused vesicle by placing a
different reactant in each original
vesicle.
Zare has many plans for extend
ing this new technique. First, he
wants to try fusing these artificial
vesicles with living cells. This
would give scientists a different
way of adding tiny amounts of
genes or drugs to individual cells,
which could lead to new methods
of treating diseases. In addition,
Zare's team is tackling the problem
of detecting the presence of a sin
gle reactant molecule in the artifi
cial vesicle. II this feat is achieved,
it will allow the team to study reac
tions with unparalleled precision.
I lie experiment, which com
bines knowledge from biology and
chemistry, typifies Zare's interdis

ciplinary approach to science. Zare
believes there is a constant danger
of compartmentalizing knowledge
in science; researchers tend to
focus only on knowledge within
their own field and ignore what's
being done in related fields. "Most
exciting problems don't come with
disciplinary labels on them," he
said.
Consequently, Zare has attract
ed members of his lab team from
diverse backgrounds. Will Parks,
an undergraduate biology major
working on the vesicle project,
said. "There are many different
people from different disciplines
here: physics, biology, biochem
istry."
Wilson added. "Everyone is so
motivated that it's hard not to be
excited about science all the time.l
