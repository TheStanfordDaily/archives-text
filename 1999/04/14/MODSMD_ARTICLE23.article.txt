# Bug unlocks the secret behind automatic gates

Q: How do the antoinatie gates around eam
l>iis work (like the ones behind the Quad and
behind the Bookstore), and i.s there any way to
triek them into opening?
A: I'm not sure it there are fundamental ethi
eal issues in revealing the scientific nature ol
the eampus' automatic gates if the intent of
the question is to find out liovv to deceive the
g;iles into opening even if you aren't sup
posed to have access. But I've always lived by
the philosophy that if there is a way to trick
the system or circumvent authority, then it is
my responsibility to execute it. In that spirit,
I'll gladly dispense the information but
remind people that il isn't my fault if you get
caught spinning donuts on the rosetta stone
of the Main Quad in your Trans Am at 3 a.m.
Everyone on campus has probably wit
nessed the subject of this week's question.
I he gates consist of a small box that has a slot
for a key card or tokens and a black-and
white striped bar that raises and lowers when
vehicles pass through. These barriers are
placed around Stanford to restrict vehicle
access to certain areas and buildings on cam
pus. Probably the most well known of these
gates is the one directly behind Memorial
Church along Duena Mall that prohibits cars
from entering the Quad and library portions
of campus.
If you've ever observed one of these gates
in action, you already know that they raise
when someone inserts a card or token in the
box, HI 11 they also automatically open when
a vehicle on the restricted access side of the
barrier pulls up to it.
Now. the explanation of the first activation
of the gate (by card or token) is obvious, but
the seemingly magical activation of the gate
from the other side is the mystery. If you look
closely on the ground, you'll see that the
pavement has been cut and modified, and
there is possibly something buried beneath
the surface of the road.
So, does it work bv detecting weight? Well
you can test this one out with a bunch of your
friends. It should only take about eight
friends standing closely together behind the
gate to generate a half-ton of force on the
sensor. Did it work? No? Need more friends?
Well, you could stack the entire football
team on the sensor and it still wouldn't raise
the gate.

Buried in the pavement is an inductor, or
a coil of wire with a current running through
it that produces magnetic field lines along the
core of the coil. When you drive over the
inductor with a car, its frame effectively acts
as another coil that interrupts the field of the
sensor coil and changes the voltage in that
coil. This phenomenon is known as mutual
inductance. When the coil beneath the road
detects that voltage change, it raises the gate.
Metal detectors that you might use to
search for treasure on the beach work in very
much the same way but are much more sensi
tive.
To fool these gates into opening when
you're on the other side, you don't need a car
to pull up to the gate on the other side and
then back up as you enter. You just need to
place some type of coil on the other side of
the gate. Figuring out what kind of coil to use
might take a little trial and error on your part,
but usually a bicycle frame or a long, heavy
duty extension cord coiled and plugged into
itself will work fine. Keep in mind that the
plane of the coil has to be parallel to the road
for it to work, which is why the gate doesn't
open when you ride your bicycle over the
sensor.
It's probably this easy-to-trick mechanism
that has prompted the University to start
installing something that I refer to as the
"Robo Bollard." a moving post that is acti
vated by a radio signal created by a garage
door opener-type device. This means that
vehicles must have a special radio to pass the
barrier regardless of which direction they are
going. Is there a way to trick those? Perhaps
another week. ...
