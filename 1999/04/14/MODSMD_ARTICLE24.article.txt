## U.S. trails in birth control choices 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
Seinfeld fans undoubtedly remember the "sponge-worthy"
episode in which Elaine buys a drugstore's entire stock of Today
sponges just as they are being taken off the market. She then
rations them out selectively due to her limited supply. "Sponge
worthiness." as Elaine defined it. may not have to be an issue soon,
as the sponge is making a comeback under a new manufacturer.
But the sponge is just one of several birth control methods peo
ple concerned with contraceptive choice are hoping will be intro
duced to the U.S. market. Others already available in Europe
include a handheld computer that tells a woman when she is fertile
so she can better measure the risk of pregnancy. European women
can also choose to surgically insert a hormone-releasing lUD that
prevents pregnancy for up to five years.
And according to a recent report by the Kaiser Family Foun
dation. a similar device that women could insert themselves— a
hormone-releasing vaginal ring good for one year — is being
developed by the Population Council, a New York based non
profit research organization.
James Trussell, a professor of economics and public policy at
Princeton University, said the United States lags behind Europe in
the variety of contraception available because of the tort climate in
this country.
"Lawsuits against the manufacturers of these products are very
expensive," Trussell said. "They don't want the legal liability."
But Margie Kelly, a public education officer at the Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy in New York, says there is some

tiling else going on.
"The power of the religious right is very strong in this country,"
Kelly said. "They don't make a distinction between contraception
and abortion, and so much of the progress [in contraceptive
choice] has been blocked. But theirs is clearly a religious position,
and it shouldn't be imposed on all Americans."
Kcllv also said there is a level of misinformation that needs to
be cleared up when it comes to contraception. One example is the
lack of knowledge about emergency contraception, called the
"morning-after pill." T here is a tendency to confuse it with RU4B6,
the controversial "abortion pill," available in France, Germany
and ( Tiina.
The morning-after pill is a high dose of the estrogens and pro
gestins found in some brands of the regular birth control pill. The
morning-after pill can actually be used up to 72 hours after inter
course has taken place. But women who want to use it should see
a doctor to get (lie correct dose of pills, plus anti-nausea medica
tion.
Unlike RU4Xfi, the morning-after pill can not disrupt an egg
that has already implanted itself in the uterus. There are no plans
to make RU4B6 available in the United States.
The last "unique" method of contraception to be approved by
the FDA was the female condom, which came on the market in
1993. But even if the range of contraceptive options were expand
ed. the most popular method for college-age students would likely
remain today's top choices — the pill and condoms.
Katie Caldwell, a junior who serves as co-director of the Sexu
al Health Peer Resource Center, agreed.
"For other methods like the diaphragm or cervical cap, a
woman has to have an exam, get fitted, then use spermicidal jelly."
Caldwell said. "It's a lot less convenient and requires a huge
amount of foresight."
At the SHPRC. a cheery room spotted with neon posters in the
basement of ( owell Student Health C 'enter, choosing a condom is
not unlike a trip to the candy store. All students are entitled to 10
free condoms per quarter — you just show your ID, grab a paper
bag anil pick from an assortment of colors, shapes and flavors.
According to Caldwell, most of the students who visit come for
the condoms. The most common inquiry about other methods
comes from women wanting to know more about the pill.
The SHPRC has information about all contraceptives; it also
sells the female condom. But last quarter, only two out of 345 vis
itors took one home with them.
"It's not super popular," Caldwell said. "It takes more practice,
and I've heard that it squeaks."
"I think we arc more [male] condom-centric because we're so
focused on disease prevention," she added. "We haven't grown up
in a free love era — we're the AIDS generation."
