## Four pitchers halt home-run leader 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
One of the nicest days of the year
brought students streaming out of
dorms yesterday to unwind and
soak in the warm spring afternoon
sun.
Sophomore Joe Borchard was
outside all afternoon as well, but not
to relax.

'We were just trying to give everybody some work on the
mound and it worked out well.'
— Mark Marquess

For much of the day, Borchard
was outfitted in full pads, taking
snaps in a competitive spring prac
tice with the Stanford football team.
Then, he walked a few steps from
the football practice field to Sunken
Diamond to play right field and bat
fifth for the second-ranked Cardi
nal.
Borchard went 3 for 4at the plate
to help second-ranked Stanford (26-
9) record a 7-3 win against San
Francisco (14-21-1).

"I was doing a little of this, a little
of that and everything in between,"
Borchard said. "I'm just keeping
busy, trying to fit everything in."
Borchard ended the 1998 foot
ball season as the second-string
quarterback behind junior Todd
Husak.
However, to have any chance of
increasing his playing time this fall.
Borchard was told he needed to at -
tend spring practice.
So this spring, with the blessing
of Stanford head baseball coach
Mark Marquess, himself a two
sport star when he attended Stan
ford. Borchard is balancing both
throughout April.
Borchard was only going to at
tend practice on non-game days.
However, after he injured his shoul
der diving against Washington State
a week and a half ago, he was unable
to throw and thus needed the extra
football practice today.
Borchard's grueling schedule did
not seem to greatly faze him.

Though he admitted he was "a little
fatigued" after the game and looked
tired on some defensive plays, he
was solid at the plate, helping the
middle of the Stanford lineup con
trol the game.
Senior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang, batting cleanup, Bor
chard and junior catcher Damien
Alvarado in the sixth spot, com
bined to go 9 for 10 on the night with

four doubles and four RBls.
Hochgesang and Alvarado were
especially effective. Hochgesang
reached base in all four of his trips to
the plate and Alvarado proceeded
to drive him in each time.
"It was good for us because we
need to rely on the middle of the
order more often," Borchard said.
"But we're a team and that's all it
comes down to. It's just good to see
different guys contributing."
The Cardinal also got contribu
tions from a variety of pitchers.
Four took the mound for Stanford
and each did a good job shutting
down San Francisco star Taggert
Bozied, who went 0 for 4.
Bozied entered the game with a
.419 average and an N('AA4eading
22 home runs.
"We were just trying to give
everybody some work on the
mound and it worked out well,"
Marquess said. "We got the guys we
wanted to see into the game."
Freshman left-hander Mike
Gosling, who was working on a
string of erratic outings, started on
the mound and pitched two score
less innings.
Gosling struck out two while al
lowing only one hit.
Freshman Mike Wodnicki fol
lowed but was not as successful. The
right-hander allowed two earned
runs in a little more than two in
nings.
However, freshman left-hander
Dan Rich and sophomore right
hander Austin Coose made sure the
Dons stayed out of the game.
Combined, they struck out five
while allowing only three hits in
the last four and two-thirds of an
inning.
