# Rizzo finally living his dream
## Time on bench lets junior mature, gain experience 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Junior second baseman Jeff Rizzo
came to Stanford like many freshman
baseball players. After being drafted
as a third baseman by the St. Louis
Cardinals in the fifth round of the
19% June Amateur Draft, Rizzo ar
rived at the Farm as a highly touted
infielder sure to excel at the college
level.
Two and a half years later, after
biding his time on the bench, Rizzo is
living up to his potential and living
out his dream.
Though he was hitting only .189
after the first 13 games, he has hit .404

in his last 21 contests to raise his aver
age to .341. He also has four home
runs and a team-leading 36 RBIs in
his first season with a regular starting
job.
"I can't say enough good things
about Jeff," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "He's playing a new
position and he's doing it well. He's
been our most consistent offensive
player all year and he's been coming
up with some big hits lately.
"He's had a fantastic year."
The road to success for the 6-foot,
185-pound Rizzo has been a rough
one at times.
He did not have to overcome a
major injury or personal trauma. But

he did have to sit in the dugout for
much of his first two seasons, watch
ing while classmates such as John
Gall and Edmund Muth, who were
not drafted at all. notched record-set
ting numbers.
Now, though, looking back on his
years at Stanford, Rizzo says his lime
away from the spotlight was good for
him. It may have been difficult, he
may have wanted more playing time,
but it was all for the best.
"Watching all those games and
watching how players from all those
different teams played the game was
all worth it,"he said.
"Once you get older and more
mature and more experienced in the

game, you begin to recognize that it is
just a game. Then, you can go out and
have fun."
However, baseball has not always
been so enjoyable for Rizzo, who was
a star at La Jolla High School in tal
ent-rich San Diego.
During his junior season with the
Vikings. Rizzo put up big numbers.
His summer performance with an
American Legion team was equally
impressive, bringing college re
cruiters and scouts to his door.
Despite all the interest, he said he
only really listened to one school —
Stanford. The opportunity to play for
a coach such as Marquess at a school
with the athletic tradition and acade
mic excellence of Stanford was too
much to pass up for Rizzo, who said
he comes from an academically ori
ented family.
When the Cardinal offered him a
scholarship. Rizzo committed early
— in October 1995, months before
the start of his senior season.
The possibility of being taken high
in the draft and playing major league
baseball still existed, though. When
La Jolla began its season the next
year, scouts who had heard of his
weighty junior-year numbers were
showing up often. Sometimes there
would be as many as 15 scouts a
game.
"It was tough to be in high school
and play in front of so many scouts."
he said. "I felt the pressure."
His production, though still good,
declined in his senior season and he
dropped to the fifth round in the
draft. "[Being drafted in the third
round) didn't measure up to what
Stanford had to offer me."
What Stanford had to offer Rizzo
was two vears of hard work and com
