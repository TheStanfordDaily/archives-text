## 
### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
The No. 12 men's gymnastics team
pulled off a stunning upset Saturday
in the West Regional competition to
earn a berth in the NCAA Champi
onships. Although it was unable to
beat either No. 5 Nebraska or No. 11
Brigham Young, it did manage to
outscore the Oklahoma Sooners, a
team that had beaten Stanford twice

this season.
The Cardinal's finish, third out of
five teams, was barely enough to
keep its season alive and ensured that
it would have a better season than last
year — a year in whieh it failed to
qualify for nationals. In order to ad
vance to the NCAA championships,
the team had to place among the top
three in Saturday's West Regional
competition. The meet, which also
featured No. 13 California, was host-

Ed by BYU.
Going into the match, Stanford
was aiming for an upset of the
Cougars — whom it has yet to beat
this season. The Cardinal figured the
Cougars were the main obstacle that
stood in its way to another NCAA
championship berth, not only be
cause they were the third-ranked
qualifiers, but also because in their
previous meeting, the two teams had
finished in a tie.

But it was Oklahoma that sur
prised everyone by turning in a dis
mal performance. The Sooners had
performed superbly throughout the
year and only slightly trailed Nebras
ka in its Regional-qualifying score,
taking second-place. Accordingly,
both BYU and Stanford attained a
monumental upset in finishing ahead
of the Sooners. Even so. the Cardinal
barely finished ahead of the Sooners,
completing the meet only .K points
ahead of Oklahoma.
Nevertheless, Nebraska could be
counted upon to compete at its lull
potential and consequently dominat
ed the match. Cornhusker gymnasts
captured the top two and tour out of
the top six positions in the all-around
competition. It also had none ol its
gymnasts finish lower than 17 in that
same competition. Nebraska also
captured the team title in the high
bars, vault and ring competitions and
finished second in every other event.
Overall, BYII gymnasts had a
very good night, taking first place in
the floor exercise and parallel bars,
and second place in the team score,
the vault and rings. In what is becom
ing a recurring theme. MYI I gymnast
Courtney Bramwell turned in vet an
other showstopping performance on

the rings, earning a season-high score
of 9.975.
For Stanford however, it was a
combination of the experienced
leadership of senior co-captain Jason
Katsampes, team effort and a few
lucky breaks that enabled the Cardi
nal to secure its third-place finish.
As expected, Katsampes turned
in another stellar performance, fin
ishing third in the all-around compe
tition behind Jason Hardabura and
Derek Leiter of Nebraska. He also
captured the pommel horse title with
a 9.825 score.
The Cardinal seems to thrive on
the pommel horse, where it has dom
inated this season.
This trend continued in the West
Regionals where the Cardinal not
only won the title, but won it con
vincingly.
The team had Katsampes finish
first, senior co-captain Scott Finkel
stcin second, freshman Adam
Merkenbile third and junior Craig
Neshitt sixth.
