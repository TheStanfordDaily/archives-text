# USHC layoffs opposed
## SF city leaders to consider resolution against Medical Center belt tightening 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
This week the San Francisco Board of Su
pervisors introduced a resolution to oppose
the planned layoff of 2.0(H) UCSF-Stanford
Health Care workers. If approved in a vote
next Monday, the resolution will also inves
tigate the financial situation of the corpora
tion.
IJSHC has no official comment on the in
troduction of the resolution, because it has
not yet been officially passed.
In March t JSHC" announced its intention
to lay off the workers in order to ameliorate
their financial situation. In the first quarter
of fiscal year 1999, the corporation suffered
losses of $10.7 million. Without the cuts it es
timates that it could suffer a loss of $134 mil
lion over the course of the year.
The cuts, according to USI IC. will have
to be made whether or not the board passes
the resolution in the coming weeks.
"These are extraordinarily painful deci
sions for all of us." USHC Chief Executive

Officei Peter Van Etten said ; n a press re
lease. "Hut we have no othe. choice. We
must find ways to continue to deliver high
quality care to meet 'he needs of o< pa
tients with fewer resources."
The board, which also opposed the merg
er that oecurred between UC-San Francisco
and Stanford Health Care last spring, is con
cerned about the quality of health care that
will be provided should these cuts occur.
"I think that care may be compromised."
Supervisor Sue Bierman said. "When you
lay off 2.000 people across the board in dif
ferent departments and services, you can't
help but lessen the standard of care."
The resolution was first introduced last
week in the Labor and Finance Committee.
It has been supported hy Board President
I'om Ammianoand Bierman among others.
" The problem is caused principally by in
adequate reimbursement from Medicare
and Medi-C'al." said Michael Lassiter of the
USHC News and Communications Office.
"We're really targeting administra
tive positions first, and only about 0
percent ol the total cuts should
come from patient care."
According to IJSIIC, the types
ol financial problems the corpora
tion is facing are similar to those
being felt all over the country in
other academic medical centers. In
addition to the lack of substantial
reimbursements, pharmaceutical
costs have increased as a propor
tion ol total spending.
I SlKaccording to I.assiter, is
lakmu a series of measures in order

to solve their budgeting problems.
I hey hope to correct the budget by
$170 million over the next two
years. I he immediate elimination
of 1.275 positions, including XOO
layoffs, will reduce the budget by
SI I- 1 million.
In addition 725 positions will be
eliminated in the coming months.
Nurses and other primary care po
sitions will not be affected in the
first round.
The other elements of the re
ductions include a $3N million de
crease in drug costs. I his will be
achieved through the use of gener
ic drugs where appropriate. The
additional $20 million M cutbacks
will be in miscellaneous expenses.

Although the resolution and the
board seemed to cite the merger as
a contributing factor to I JSH( "s fi
nancial problems, the corporation
said that the merger was not a fac
tor in the budgetary shortfall.
"The merger is helping in the so
lution and did not contribute to the
problem." Lassiter said. "The
merger allows us to take more of
the cuts in nonpatient care areas."
Forty percent of the total cuts
arc planned to come Irom adminis
trative positions.
Van F.tten. in a comment to the
Labor and Finance Committee,
said he could not guarantee that the
cutbacks would not affect patient
care.
