At this point the Cardinal was
down 3-1 and knew it had to win all
three of the remaining singles match
es. Hippensteel was down two match
points in the second set against Eny
Ghidirmic before battling back to
win the second set 7-5. Had he lost
that set. the match would have been
over.
Wolters and Abrams then came
through with close wins over Gullet
and Graph 7-5,7-5 and 7-6,6-1. Thus,
the match was all on Hippensteel's
shoulders as he entered his third set.
Hippensteel once again showed
the poise that one seldom sees in a
freshman by dominating the third set
6-3 to i>ive the Cardinal its victory.
