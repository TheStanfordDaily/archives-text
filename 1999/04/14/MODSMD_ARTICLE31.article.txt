### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
The seniors on the 15th-ranked Stanford men's volley
ball team — Patrick Klein, Jeremy Bart and Chris Griffith
— will remember last night's game for a very long time.
Not just because of the traditional Senior Night cere
mony that occurred before the match. Not just because it
was the seniors' final career matches at Burnham Pavil
ion.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Today: No 12. Pacific (14-10, 10-9 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) def. No. 15 Stanford (10-10, 7-10 ) 9-
15,6-15,15-7,15-6,23-21.

But rather because it was hardly the ideal way to cul
minate four years of dedication to the Stanford men's vol
leyball team.
The Cardinal (10-10, 7-10 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) was on its way to upsetting No. 12 Pacific (14-
10, 10-9 MPSF) and maintaining its postseason chances
before its once-solid lead slowly began to crumple. A scor
ing run in the third game propelled Pacific to battle back
from a two-game deficit and dash all of the Cardinal's
hopes of competing in the MPSF tournament. Although
the Cardinal was even with Pacific at 6-6, Stanford only
scored one more point for the rest of game three.
"Pacific scored six in a row on one server in game
three," said Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves. "In that
same game, we missed four serves. That was the most crit
ical point in the match."
What makes the loss even more stinging is that last
night's game was a near-exact repeat of the last time these
two teams met, March 31. In that matchup. Pacific pulled
off a victory after dropping the first two games at the
Spanos Sports Center in Stockton.
For a team that has faced so much adversity and inter
nal strife, the Cardinal's fifth-game efforts epitomized the
heart and dedication of not only the senior class, but the
entire Stanford squad. TTie Cardinal held four match
points and faced numerous Pacific match points in the
fifth, rally-scored game. In the end, however, Stanford er
rors. including five service errors in the fifth game proved
too costly. After trading points throughout the game. Pa
cific pulled off a 23-21 victory.
"I thought everyone came through big for the team
tonight," Klein said. "Losing games three and four took a
lot out of us, but I thought that we showed a lot of heart
and resilience to regroup for game five."

and a .449 hitting percentage for the evening.
"With Andric getting off to such a good start, we had
to change our game plan a bit." Nieves said, "He put
through one of the most impressive offensive perfor
mances ever in Burnham Pavilion."
Sophomore setter Josh Lukens, who had lew breaks
from action the entire evening, recorded 76 assists for the
Cardinal.
"Lukens ran the offense well." Nieves said. "We want
ed to back set Pacific because of the way that Audi ic was
playing."
