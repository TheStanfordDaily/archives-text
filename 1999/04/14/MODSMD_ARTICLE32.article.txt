# Sororities finish Rush process
## 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
Five sororities accepted 122 women
yesterday afternoon at the culmination of
this year's Rush events. This number rep
resents a nearly 12 percent increase over
last year's class, according to the Inter
sorority Council.
This increase comes despite a reduc
tion in the total number of sororities on
campus, with this year's closure of the
Delta Gamma's chapter at Stanford.
"On the whole 1 feel the process went
very smoothly, and I was pleased that
more women were interested in rushing
this year than last," ISC Rush Chair An
drea Constantinides said.
"It's exciting to see so many amazing
and diverse women interested in Greek
life," she said.
Both housed and unhoused sororities
completed a successful Rush, according
to ISC President Melissa Chud, a senior.

The two housed sororities, Delta Delta
Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta, will ex
ceed their University housing require
ments for next year, she said.
"It's great to see so many people inter
ested in Greek life," Chud said. "I'm es
pecially pleased to see the positive re
sponse to housed sororities."
Overall the girls seemed pleased with
their experience, although many com
mented that it had been stressful.
"I thought it was incredibly stressful,
because 1 really wanted to stay with my
friends," freshman Teri Thomason said.
"But I have no regrets, and I'm happy that
1 did it."
Sophomores and other upperclassman
who participated had a different perspec
tive on Rush. They cited the chance to be
involved in something new on campus as
one of the reasons they chose to partic
ipate.
The fact that several of the sororities
are housed and others are not contributed

to many of the girl's sorority preferences.
With Draw looming in the near future,
the preservation of potential Draw
groups influenced many of their deci
sions.
"We have a Draw group of eight, and
we didn't want to get split up," freshman
Emily Cadie said. "So we all preferred un
housed sororities."
Others said that housed sororities sim
plified the Draw system and were excited
about the prospect of living in a house.
"It eliminates all the hassles of Draw,"
said freshman Simona Chin, who received
a hid from Theta.
"The house gives you an opportunity
to be able to get to know your pledge class
on a more intimate basis," she said.
Sororities that are not a part of the
ISC, such as Kappa Delta Phi and Alpha
Kappa Alpha, do not participate in the
formal spring Rush.
They will hold their Rush events at a
later date.
