# Tyson explores geology through photography
## 
### Beth Robinowitz Contributing writer 
Photographer Boh Tyson, Class
of '6 C J. is using his geological train
ing to explore hidden intrigues of
the world by capturing them in
platinum-palladium contact prints.
After graduating with a bache
lor's in geology and working as an
engineering geologist for Bechtcl.
Tyson returned to Stanford and
earned his master's in fine arts in
1986.
Palo Alto's Gallery Europa,
which opened last June, will be dis
playing Tyson's prints until April
15. This is the gallery's first photog
raphy showing.
Tyson's works resemble black
and-white watercolor paintings
more than photographs.
The wide diversity of Tyson's
subject matter ranges from a boul

der in Kansas to a monastery in
Moscow, but all try to evoke mys
tery.
David Uimmelberger, who
owns Gallery Europa, attributes a
unique perceptive ability in Tyson
to his geological training.
Himmelberger spoke of the soft
and complex tonal range in Tyson's
pieces. "I'he whites sort of have a
grayish feel. They beckon you.
[ Tyson] says he knows he's success
ful when he sees the nose prints on
the glass." I limmelberger said.
Uimmelberger explained that
Tyson achieves intrigue not only
through his provocative subject
matter but also through his use of
the technique of platinum-palladi
um contact printing.
The platinum-palladium tech
nique, which lyson learned at
Stanford, was invented in the mid
19th eenturv and was one of the

main photographic processes until
World War I. when industrially
manufactured silver-based enlarg
ing papers became standard.
In platinum-palladium contact
printing, contact prints are created
from 8-by-10 inch negatives, made
with an 8-by-10-view camera,
through hand-sensitizing rag pa
pers with salts of palladium, plat
inum and light-sensitive iron.
For Tyson this process has yield
ed one-of-a-kind prints whose wide
tonal range, great depth of focus
and interesting subject matter pull
the viewer into close examination
of the subtleties he has created on
the parchment-like paper.
In 1981 Senior Lecturer Joel
Leivick began teaching the tech
nique at Stanford.
Leivick recalls that he taught the
palladium technique to Tyson's
class at the end of one week. Over

the following weekend Tyson used
up all of the chemicals purchased
for the technique in his enthusiastic
experimentation.
Leivick said that Tyson believed
that he had found his medium.
Due to Tyson's age and previous
work experience, Leivick said that
Tyson was already quite a mature
artist as a master's student.
Remembering Tyson as a stu
dent, Leivick described Tyson as
"like a ball of energy, very in
tense."
Leivick recalled Tyson's final
master of fine arts show as a rather
extraordinary juxtaposition of two
series of prints. One series, mainly
portraits, consisted of gigantic 4-
by-6-foot silver prints, the other of
4-by-5-inch platinum prints.
Leivick said Tyson's works at
Gallery Europa "show a kind of
concentrated observation, distilled

down to the powerful essence of
things."
Platinum-palladium printing is
still taught every fall quarter in
Leivick's class. Studio Art 172,
"Alternative Processes." Although

it is not exclusively taught at Stan
ford. teaching of this process at col
leges is uncommon.
The Tyson exhibit at Gallery
Europa, 611 Emerson St.. will be
open until tomorrow.
