## 
### Abhishek Bajoria Contributing writer 
This year Student Housing Ser
vices is planning to renovate live res
idences as part of a program to in
crease the number of houses accessi
ble to disabled students.
The construction will make Nar
nia living accessible and Enchanted
Broccoli Forest, Kappa Alpha and
Lambda Nu visiting accessible. As
part of the renovation, the Kimball
Hall elevator, which was supposed
to he installed in the dormitory last
summer, will be completed. The
construction will take place over the
summer and should not disrupt
school next year.
According to Diana Conklin.
manager of undergraduate housing
operations, the Kimball elevator
was delayed because of a "funding
issue." The elevator is being made
possible by a donation by William
Kimball, the dormitory's original
benefactor. The other renovations
are being financed by Student Hous
ing Services.
Karin Willison. a senior living in
Kimball, reacted positively to the
changes. "I think it's excellent." she
said.
Willison said that although she
was pleased with the changes. I lous

ing and Dining Services could antic
ipate and respond better to student
needs. For instance disabled stu
dents are currently unable to enter
Kimball without assistance, because
the remote controls designed to help
them open doors have not yet been
delivered. Conklin said the remote
controls have arrived at Housing
and Dining, but have not yet been
distributed due to a "communica
tions gap."
According to Conklin, the Dis
ability Resource Center and Hons
ing and Dining Services try to make
the campus as accessible as possible.
"Very often," Conklin said, "we
have to come back and do addition
al tailoring to meet individual stu
dent needs."
These latest improvements are
made possible through the 15-year
Capital Improvement Plan being
implemented by Housing and Din
ing Services. I his year, the seventh
year of the program, planned
changes were selected In ■'students,
resident fellows, the Disability Re
sources Center and my office," said
Rosa Gonzalez, head of disability
access at the Office of Multicultural
Development.
By its conclusion in 2007. the plan
will make most student residences ol
all types at least visiting accessible.

I his includes theme houses, sell
ops. co-ops. dormitories, Row hous
es and (ireek houses.
Renovations to Ipyon Hall, Chi
I beta C'lii and S.mma Chi are

Housing and Dinirlg has "already
begun planning for that." Gonzalez
said.
A designation of "living accessi
ble" encompasses all of the facilities
within the residence, including the
kitchen, computer duster, lounges,
