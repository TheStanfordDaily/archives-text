### Jad Fakhry Contributing writer 
St an lord's (iraduate School of Business has
seen a steady, three-vear increase in faculty hir
ing, but at the national level business schools
have experienced a 21 percent jump in hiring
this year.
A Chronicle of Higher Education report
cited the growth of new programs focusing on
specific industries at business schools nation
wide as a major contribution to the increase in
faculty hiring.

Business School administrators explained
Stanford's increases in hiring as a result of ex
panded authority to bring in new faculty mem
bers.
Business School Assoc. Academic Dean
Robert Flanagan said. "There has been an in
crease in hiring authorizations to faculty
groups in the past three years."
"An increase in hiring provides the oppor
tunity to improve the quality of our education
b\ gettinu the newest ideas into the school." he
added.
Margaret Neale, associate acade
mic dean at the Business School, ex
plained that the she and other admin
istrators are constantly searching for
exceptional faculty members. This
year two new professors have been
hired and three to five have been of
fered positions.
I he call for additional faculty re
ally depends on what the students
find engaging and what the market is
doing," Neale said.
She vikl student tuition is not af
fected by the increased search for fac
ulty members.
Flanagan added that an expanded
search does not always create a larger
faculty, as some offers are turned
down. "Some searches do not identi
fy a candidate who we want to hire.

and some offers we make are not ac
cepted most often because of unre
solvable dual career situations," he
said.
Flanagan noted that much hiring
is based on new industries such as the
Internet and telecommunications. "It
seems to be a fact of life that the best
ideas in most disciplines are devel
oped by the young."
According to Flanagan, the search
process is based on the "sum of needs
from various faculty areas." lie ex
plained. "Needs come from such fac
tors as the vitality of research in par
ticular areas, required and elective
teaching responsibilities in the vari
ous areas, and executive education
responsibilities in various areas."
First-year business student
Shcrice (iuillory said, "the Business
School could definitely do a better
job in bringing in more people from
inside the industry to teach new
trends in business." She added, " The

problem is. 110 matter how hard you
try. it is hard to get tenured faculty to
teach about the Internet lI'O indus
try since the life cycle of such indus
tries is so short."
Neale concurred. "New faculty
must meet the long term demands of
business students, so we don't exclu
sively hire based 011 a new business
trend," she said.
Dan Kapaport, a first-year busi
ness student, said "I believe that the
administration does a really excellent
job with recruiting faculty." He ex
plained that the Business School puts
major effort into recruiting top-notch
faculty. "The teachers we get are re
ally high caliber: they're just incredi
ble."
Kapaport pointed out that teach
ing is a high priority, because "busi
ness school students have really high
expectations." I le also said that most
students are satisfied with their busi
ness school education.
