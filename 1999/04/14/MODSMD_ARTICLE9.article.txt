### 
PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) — Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, who videotaped himself giving a
man a lethal injection and dared prosecutors
to stop his assisted-suicide campaign, was
sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison yester
day by a judge who told him: "Sir. consider
yourself stopped."
Kevorkian, who turns 71 next month,
grinned as he was led from the courtroom in
handcuffs, saying to a friend. "Justice?" He
said nothing when given the opportunity to
speak at his sentencing.
Judge Jessica Cooper refused to release
him on bail while he appeals his murder con
viction. saying she couldn't trust his promise
not to take part in any more suicides.
"That is what he believes his life mission
is." she said.
In addition to giving Kevorkian the sen
tence prosecutors asked for.the judge hand
ed him three to seven years for delivery ol a
controlled substance. I he sentences will run
concurrently, and Kevorkian will be eligible
for parole after six years and eight months, a
prosecutor said.
He could have gotten life in prison.
Defense attorney David Ciorosh said that
he was surprised by the judge's decision and
that he hopes it does not amount to a life

sentence for Kevorkian: "It would he a terri
ble tragedy to lose such a heroic figure in
American life."
Hie widow and brother of I homas Youk,
the 52-year-old I ou (iehrig's disease patient
whose videotaped death was shown on "60
Minutes" last fall, pleaded for leniency. Hut
Cooper was adamant as she lectured
Kevorkian.
"This trial was not about the political or
moral correctness of euthanasia." the judge
said. "It was about you. sir. It was about law
lessness. It was about disrespect for a society
that exists because of the strength of the
legal system."
"No one. sir. is above the law. No one,"
she continued. "You had the audacity to go
on national television, show the world what
you did and dare the legal system to stop
you. Well. sir. consider yourscll stopped."
Even so, she predicted the debate that
Kevorkian brought to the fore will continue
"long aftei this trial and your activities fade
from public meniorv."
Kevorkian injected Youk with lethal
chemicals on Sept. 17 at Youk's request.
Youk was in a wheelchair, could barely
move his arms or legs and was afraid of
choking to death on his own saliva.
