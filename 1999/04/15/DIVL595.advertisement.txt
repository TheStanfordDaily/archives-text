KOSOVO CRISIS TALK
• Are NATO attacks creating more instability in the Balkan
"powderkeg"?
• Will the Cold War reemerge with the new proposed union
of Russia, Yugoslavia, and Belarus?
• $3 billion dollars and 520,000 refugees later — has a
humanitarian mission turned into a humanitarian disaster?
• Should the US send ground troops to Kosovo? Will the war
in Yugoslavia be another Vietnam?
• Is the price of ceasing NATO operations and going back to
the negotiating table greater than the price of winning?
• What are the underlying roots to this tragedy?
• Should we be worried that the Russians have hinted at
intervening?
• Can a country unilaterally decide which conflicts deserve
attention and which do not?
