# Sophomore of '4th Dimension' bows out of race
## 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
Sophomore Sean Tolpinrud has
decided to bow out of the race for
ASSU junior class president after
confirming allegations that he
asked friends and acquaintances to
misrepresent their class standing so
they could vote for him.
Tolpinrud, who was a member
of.the "4th Dimension" slate —
which also includes sophomores
Winnie Yuan, Tess Malone and
Mike Hehman — expressed re
morse at his actions.
"1 am making this decision (to
step down] since I have violated a
campaigning rule and do not want
to jeopardize the eligibility of my
,slate," he said. "What I did was in
excusable, and I should not have
done it."
t 4 Tolpinrud added that the inci
pient should not cause the Stanford
community to view the other mem

hers of his slate in any negative re
gard.
"I acted on my own, and my ac
tions are in no way indicative of the
quality of my slate," he said. "My
sincerest apologies go out to
[Hehman, Malone and Yuan], our
supporters and the student body. 1
am truly sorry."
The election hearings officer,
sophomore Katie Young, said that
Tolpinrud will face no further con
sequences.
"After thorough consideration
of the situation, I have decided to
halt my formal investigation." she
said. "Sean's actions were clearly
unethical, and he is accepting re
sponsibility. I have no current
plans to schedule a hearing."
The controversy began with an
e-mail, sent to about 50 people,
that solicited votes in favor of 4th
Dimension, even from those who
;.were not sophomores.
•♦•»\The e-mail stated, "when you
"gef to the first page where it asks
what class you are currently in,
click 'sophomore' so that you can
vote for me even if you are not a
sophomore (they have absolutely
no way of finding out)."
In the case that Tolpinrud's e
mail had gone unnoticed by ASSIJ
officials, there would in fact have
been a way to check the legitimacy
of the votes, according to junior
Eric Albert, election technical spe
cialist.
""In accordance with the ASSIJ
" bylaws, we track identifying infor
mation for every vote that is cast,"
he said. "This information —which

will not be used except for verifying
a voter's eligibility and, if needed,
in the course of a hearings officer's
investigation — is stored until the
election has been certified and then
deleted."
"Satisfaction Guaranteed," the
opposing slate, which is made up of
sophomores Nathan Christensen.
Mike Kass, Danny Jacobs and
Brandon Maughan, issued a state
ment after the allegation was
made.
"This has been a good campaign
so far," the statement read. "We
have respect for the other slate... .
In the meanwhile we're focusing
on the election and getting out to
vote."
The election continues through
midnight tonight. Voting can be
