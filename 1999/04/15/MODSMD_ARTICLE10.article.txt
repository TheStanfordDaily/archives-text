## Republicans preparing to battle with Clinton House approves final budget 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Majority Republicans
whisked a final $1.74 trillion budget for fiscal 2(XX)
through the House yesterday, paving the way for year
long combat with President Clinton over tax cuts and
spending.
I he near party-line vote was 220-208. Senate approval
was expected by today, which Republicans hoped would
help them spotlight their tax-cut drive even as Americans
contend with today's deadline for filing income taxes.
The plan signals the issues the CiOP wants to highlight
in this year's run-up to the 2(XX) elections: a 10-year tax
cut totaling at least $778 billion; using Social Security's
enormous surpluses to reduce the national debt and
extra money for defense and schools.
"A new agenda for the new millennium," said House
Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich. R-Ohio, a

presidential hopeful. He added, "We ought to march into
the next century, the next millennium with our heads
held high."
Democrats said the measure used for tax cuts expect
ed federal surpluses that should instead be saved to pre
pare Medicare for the baby boomers' retirements and to
beef up other social programs.
Details aside, they said it would do little more than let
Republicans claims they were finishing the budget on
time, which Congress has achieved only once since mak
ing April 15 the legal deadline in 1987.
"This looks like we're making the trains run on time,
but in truth, down the tracks a train wreck awaits," said
Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, ranking Budget
Committee Democrat, referring to upcoming battles
with Clinton.
