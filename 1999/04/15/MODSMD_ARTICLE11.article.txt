# FBI warns of Serb terrorism

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
FBI has warned the U.S. military to
be alert for possible Serb-led terror
ist attacks inside the United States
after several churches received
"threats to kill" American soldiers,
according to a memo obtained by
The Associated Press.
FBI counterterrorism agents sent
out the memo last week after Ser
bian Orthodox churches in the
Sacramento, Milwaukee, Chicago
and Indianapolis areas received via
fax a Serb-language letter urging
Serbian Americans to respond vio
lently to NATO strikes on
Yugoslavia.
" The threat letter requested that

all Serbian nationalists living in
America take action against the
NATO decision to intervene in the
Serbian / Kosovo conflict by killing
as many American soldiers in the
United States as necessary to stop
the NATO attacks in Serbia,"
according to the FBI memo.
The memo was distributed to
military bases and other sensitive
federal installations, such as nuclear
weapons labs, through a special
electronic mail warning system, offi
cials said.
Dale Watson, the FBl's deputy
assistant director for counterterror
ism, declined to discuss the memo
but said the church letters aren't the

only Serb-related terrorism threats
being examined by FBI investiga
tors.
"As the war continues, we
receive a lot of threats in here. The
FBI looks into them," Watson said
yesterday in a telephone interview.
"This (letter) is not just an isolated
situation. We look at threats; we
take them all seriously."
Ihe FBI seldom issues the type
of memo sent to defense installa
tions.
The agency is investigating
whether there is any link between
the Yugoslav government in Bel
grade and the threats in the United
States, officials said.
