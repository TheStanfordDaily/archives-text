New provost faces
numerous issues that
must be dealt with

JOHN HENNESSY HAS a tough
job ahead of him. Currently the
dean of engineering, Hennessy
was named yesterday to replaee Uni
versity Provost Condoleezza Rice in
July.
Hennessy has received nothing but
praise from Rice, University President
Gerhard Casper and ASSU President
Maren Norton, who was part of the
search committee that nominated him.
We have no doubts that 112 lennessv is
fully capable of successfully carrying
out his duties and introducing further
improvements for the University.
And though we are sure he is well
aware of the particular issues he will
need to address as the University's
next provost, we would like to remind
him of the things we believe deserve
particular attention.
Regardless of whether or not the
U.S. Labor Department investigates
the University for possible violations
of affirmative action requirements, the
fact remains that the numbers of
minority and female faculty who have
tenure remain disproportionately and
dismally low.
Both Norton and Rice have noted
Hennessy's sensitivity to and aware
ness of diversity issues.
We hope that Hennessy will set
forth clear and specific goals and plans
for improving diversity among our fae

ultv. Failure to do so would he a blow
to the many faculty members and stu
dents to whom this is a crucial topic.
Graduate students on campus also
face difficulties, and Rice has proven
that such problems can be alleviated
by University action.
Iliough Rice has introduced initia
tives to increase affordable housing
options and stipends for graduate stu
dents, their problems are far from
solved and will continue to need mon
itoring by Hennessy.
In addition to graduate students,
junior faculty members face difficulties
finding affordable housing near cam
pus.
II housing problems continue to
make Stanford an unattractive place
for these two groups, the University's
teaching resources could suffer in the
long run.
Recent years have seen innovations
in undergraduate education, including
Stanford Introductory Studies and
Sophomore College.
We are sure that I lennessys experi
ence with teaching and advising under
graduates only bodes well for further
innovation in this area.
111 ere are a lot of issues that need to
be addressed. It is not enough to sim
ply pay lip service to them.
We hope to see concrete action and
efforts to create solutions in the areas
where improvement is necessary.
We have no reason to doubt that
Hennessy is capable of this, and we
look forward to the fresh ideas and
innovations he will bring to the
provost's office.
