## Self-righteous at Stanford

SO DO YOU hang
out in their room
much?
Oh no. That room only
engenders vapid conver
sation."
Really? It's true that the
room in question was

sometimes home to discussions of boys,
parties and shopping. The walls may have
hosted a Backstreet Boys poster or two.
And it's also true that late night debates
about Kantian ethics — the kind that you
read about in the pre-Farm guide
"Approaching Stanford" — rarely emanat
ed from within. But vapid?
Vapid seems a bit too strong, a bit t00...
shall we say ... self-righteous.
Snobbery, hypocrisy, self
righteousness— call it what you will
irrespective of terminology, it exists in var
ious forms. And unfortunately, it seems all
too common here.
Let's begin with so-called intellectual
self-righteousness. Some of Stanford's most
hallowed traditions rest on this smarter
than-thou theory: the perennial presump
tion that UC-Berkeley students are less
intelligent than their Peninsula counter
parts and the cheer "That's alright, that's
okay; you'll all work for us someday."
Doesn't that make us sound endearing? It's
a wonder that people stereotype Stan
fordites as snobs. Such traditions make
some of us feel a bit uncomfortable, but
they are embraced by the general populace
and rarely questioned.
Students also have been known to take
on this smarter-than-thou attitude with one

another. Case in point: as you eat dinner,
you discuss what classes you'll be taking this
quarter. You mention that you're enrolling
in the infamous EDGE (Ethics of Develop
ment in a Global Environment). Your din
ner companion smiles, almost knowingly,
and says with requisite sarcasm. "I see
you're taking your academics quite serious
ly."
The not-so-subtle implication is that
you've chosen the EDGE for an easy "A."
However, it may be that you see the EDGE
as a good opportunity to write a research
paper (well, probably not — but it is possi
ble). And simply because you haven't
booked four engineering classes for the
quarter, you're not any less of an academic
being.
Such subtle snobbery also extends to the
social realm. Let's take your typical Friday
night. After dinner, you engage in some
pre-going out prepping. Brushing your
teeth in the bathroom, you run into your
neighbor from down the hall, and he asks
about your evening plans. You respond that
you might check out the campus parties
(well, party on most nights, in the singular).
He rolls his eyes, gives a little laugh and says
"have fun"; he'll be heading to the City for
a Beat poetry reading. Guess he's too good
for the Greek scene. And he's not the only
one. Have you ever noticed certain fraterni
ty brothers who seem willing to go only to
their own frat's parties? Socially selective,
aren't they?
My favorite example of social snobbery
is displayed the morning after a night of
debauchery. Student A strolls into the din
ing hall for some brunch. Student B gives

his friend a condescending back pat and
gently asks, "Do you need some liquids?
Maybe some aspirin?" Student A, a bit
taken aback, asks incredulously, "Why? T,m
feeling fine." And B, in a parental tone,
retorts, "Well, you were a bit ridiculous last
night, don't you think?" Umm, actually Stu
dent A was far from "ridiculous," having
consumed only one watered-down cup of
Natural Light that was half-foam anyway.
And regardless of Student A's blood alco
hol level, he has no need for his peers to
turn into parents.
The point of highlighting Student B's
action shouldn't be taken as exonerating
drunkenness. The moral of the story is ttyat
one need not judge. Self-righteousness
makes us feel smarter, holier and simply
better than someone else.
But instead of seeing our actions as supe
rior, let's simply try to seem them as differ
ent. Choices don't always need to be ranked
from best to worst; one doesn't need to be
elevated above another.
Especially here at Stanford, decisions
don't need to be condemned simply
because they're not the ones you would
make.
So the room was home to vapidity.
Vapid? Well, if being vapid means watching
Melrose Place, celebrating Michael Jor
dan's ball skills (and his stunning good
looks) and busting out some MTV-quality
synchronized dance routines, sign me up.

ical science. She loves the residents of the
vapid room.
