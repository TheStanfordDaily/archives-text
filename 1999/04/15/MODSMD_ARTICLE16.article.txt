Axe Comm responds to endorsement
Before listing the reasons von should
support the Stanford Axe Committee spe
cial lee in the upcoming ASSU Election, I
would like to point out the entirely false
statements about the Axe Committee print
ed in The Daily special-fee Endorsements.
The Axe Committee has never been
offered to "be funded and integrated into
the Athletics Department." We have dis
cussed the issue of working more closely
with the Athletics Department, but the
Athletics Department has never offered to
fund the committee.
The committee is also not "stuck on the
issue of the Bonfire at Lake Lagunita."
While we continue to support discussion on
the possibility of once again having a Bon
fire, the Axe Committee is very focused on
finding a new and equally attractive Big
(iamc Rally site, promoting Big Game in
other ways such as the Big Game Count
down in White Pla/a and continuing our
traditional role at football games and other
sporting events.
We are far from "disorganized" as we
are currently planning our annual Frisbee
Golf Tournament and meeting with the
Office of Student Activities to find a new
rally site almost eight months before next
year's Big Game Rally is to take place.
The Axe Committee is stronger than
ever with a membership of more than 40
undergraduates dedicated to maintaining
the traditions of the University and sup
porting Stanford Athletics (not
"maintaining] ... its Athletics Depart
ment" as The Daily misprinted).

It would appear Fhe Daily did not do
enough research to make a correct and
informed endorsement of the Stanford Axe
Committee. Please keep this in mind when
you vote on today, and Beat Cal!

Weiss does not have good record
The Daily Editorial Board endorsement
of Adam Weiss for the ASSLJ presidency
has proven that The Daily does not care
about the candidates' track records as
ASSU officers. Presidential candidate
Weiss has failed to follow through on
almost all of the campaign promises he
made when he ran for the ASSU Senate last
year and the year before.
When Weiss ran for Senate two years
ago. his statement in the Elections Hand
book contained the following: "As an
ASSI J senator, I will: Demand that students
be actively involved in dining services com
mittees on cost-containment and quality
control. Draft legislation condemning the
administration lor its non-compliance with
federal law concerning the handicapped.
Require that the ASSU hold frequent pub
lic forums so that student concerns and sug
gestions can be addressed. Organize a
monthly newsletter detailing accomplish
ments and circulate financial statements to
students each quarter so that you know
your $6(X) ASSU fees are well-spent."
Weiss was elected to the Senate based on
that campaign statement. Since then, he has

not demanded that students be actively
involved in Dining Services committees on
cost containment and quality control.
Incidentally, Weiss's opponent in the
ASSU presidential election this year, Mike
Levin, is currently working on this very
issue by chairing the ASSU Task Force on
Dining Services. Weiss has not drafted any
legislation condemning the administration
for non-compliance with federal laws con
cerning the handicapped. The ASSU does
not hold frequent public forums so that stu
dent concerns and suggestions can be
addressed. There does not exist a monthly
newsletter detailing the ASSU's accom
plishments, and nobody has circulated
financial statements to students each quar
ter so that we know that our ASSU fees are
well spent.
A year ago, Weiss was elected to his sec
ond term in the ASSU Senate. His state
ment in the 1998 Elections Handbook con
tained the following: "Here is what I will do
next year as your ASSU Senator: Parking:
Look into the feasibility of less restrictive
parking permits. Facilities: Take action to
renovate athletic facilities currently in
unplayable conditions. Representation:
Hold office hours to hear student concerns
and pass a Senate resolution directing sena
tors to address them in a timely fashion.
Political Discourse: Bring all politically
active groups on campus into a union fos
tering more political awareness. Tuition:
Fight to keep tuition increases even more
modest though ASSU dialogue with the
Board of Trustees."
Once again, Weiss broke his campaign
promises. He did not hold the office hours

he promised (unlike ASSU President
Maren Norton and Vice President Santos
Marroquin). He neither passed, nor pro
posed, a Senate resolution directing sena
tors to address student concerns in a timely
fashion. There has been no ASSU dialogue
with the Board of Trustees regarding keep
ing tuition increases modest. I do not know
whether Weiss "looked into" making park
ing permits less restrictive, but this does not
seem to have happened during the past
year.
Candidates' past records of student
advocacy provide a preview of what we can
expect from them if we elect them again.
Weiss has broken most of the promises he
made when he ran for ASSU Senate last
year and the year before.
When going to the polls, Stanford stu
dents should base their votes on what can
didates say they will do in the future, but
also on what candidates have done in the
past.

Disappointed with amendment team
I was concerned when I found full-page
ads in the last two issues of The Daily advo
cating the proposed constitutional amend
ment. By my estimation, the cost of such
advertising is at least $1,6(X).
Is that money coming directly from the
undersigned supporters of the amendment
or from our student government? If the
answer is the latter — and 1 suspeet that is
the case — then this strikes me as an egre
gious misuse of our lunds. It would be com
parable to the governor of California spend
ing state money in support of a state ballot
proposition, which would clearly be illegal.
I was also disappointed to find a pro
amendment flyer under my door yesterday.
Such a campaign tactic is not allowed for
candidates and special-fee groups and justi
fiably so.
The same rules ought to apply to the pro
ponents of the constitutional amendment.

Kyoto Protocol isn't too costly
Much misinformation has been spread
regarding the science and costs of global
warming, including Thomas Moore's letter
to the editor. Moore's premise is that taking
steps to curb global warming under the
Kyoto Protocol will cost too much. He
could not be more wrong.
A growing number of prominent compa
nies including Boeing, BP Amoco, DuPont,
Enron, Lockheed Martin, Maytag, Shell,
Toyota and Weyerhauser recently joined
forces to address global warming.
These companies, whom Moore claims
have the most to lose under the Kyoto Pro
tocol, have signed onto the Pew Principles,
which stipulate that enough is known about
the science and environmental impacts of

global warming to take actions now to
address its consequences.
These companies are taking steps to
inventory and reduce their emissions volun
tarily. Why? Because they realize this is a
tremendous opportunity to make money by
investing in cleaner and more efficient pro
cesses and technologies.
The leadership of these companies
shows we can simultaneously curb global
warming and maintain a healthy, vibrant
economy. These industry leaders, whose
numbers are rapidly growing, are working
with Congress and the Clinton Administra
tion to address global climate chiinge. The
Senate has introduced a bipartisan resolu
tion to give credit to companies who take
steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emis
sions, and the Administration has proposed
a $5 billion industry partnership for
research and development and technology
commercialization.
In sharp contrast, the shrinking industry
membership of the Global Climate Coali
tion (including Exxon, Mobil, Texaco and
General Motors) has engaged in a cam
paign to block any industry or governmen
tal steps to curb global warming.
The GCC and its members continue to
spend millions of dollars to misinform the
public about growing global consensus on
the science and economics of global climate
change and the benefits of an early transi
tion to a cleaner and healthier future.
Taking steps to address global warming
makes business sense, now and in the long

run. As Moore says, "students and faculty
should beware of being taken in" by misin
formation and the very real consequences
of inaction.

Moore responds to criticism
Stanford students John Niles and Puneet
Sandhu contend that I was wrongheaded in
opposing the Kyoto Protocol. Niles quarrels
with my contention that warming might
have health benefits.
In answer to his question, yes, my
research has been published in a peer
reviewed journal. Economic Inquiry (July
1998) — the flagship publication of the
Western Economic Association — as "The
Health and Amenity Effects of Global
Warming." The other recent research sup
porting the mortality benefits of a warmer
world comes from scholars at the Climate
Research Unit of East Anglia University in
England, working under the sponsorship of
the United Kingdom's Department of Envi
ronment. A 4.5 degree Fahrenheit warmer
world, they find, would reduce deaths by 3
pcrcent in England and Wales. Niles asserts
that the Clinton Administration's Depart
ment of Energy is biased against Kyoto.
To put it mildly, this seems implausible;
the bias is likely to be in favor. Researchers
who have looked at the DOE research do
not find it "nonsense."

I know of no reputable study that shows
a gain from adopting the Protocol. Even the
Clinton administration, after making some
belabored assumptions to reduce the unde
niable burden, finds some costs.
On the other hand, I am aware of at least
four that show significant harm to the U.S.
economy, on the order of 3 percent of GDP.
In comparison, seven studies, carried out by
reputable economists, of the effects of busi
ness-as-usual including simply adjusting to a
warmer world range between a loss ol 1.5
percent and a gain of 1 percent of GDP,
rather modest numbers.
Niles describes as ridiculous my "sugges
tion" that the former head of the Intergov
ernmental Panel on Climate Change said
that Kyoto Protocol would have no signifi
cant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. It
is not my "suggestion"; Bert Bolin made the
assertion in Science magazine.
Yes, Niles is right. If you feel that global
warming is a real problem, then Kyoto is
inadequate, just a symbolic gesture. But if
the cost of meeting Kyoto is triple the cost
of doing nothing, under even the most pes
simistic scenario, then the cost of going
beyond Kyoto would be even more horren
dous in comparison to the meager benefit.
To stabilize greenhouse gas concentra
tions in the atmosphere might require not
only the cooperation of major Third World
countries but the slashing of emissions by 6()
to 70 percent, rather than the 5 percent
required of the industrial world under
Kyoto.

Such a program has never been costed;
but, if the 7 percent reduction by the Unit
ed States would cut GDP by 3 percent, then
a 70 percent reduction might cost the Unit
ed States 30 percent of our national income.
That outcome would make the great
depression of the 1930s look like a time; of
plenty. I
Sandhu's position appears to be that Che
United States produced the most green
house gases in the last 50 years and there
fore should cut its greenhouse gases even if
other countries refuse to do so.
Besides being ineffective in reducing any
warming potential, though perhaps satisfy
ing to Third World countries, his opinion
ignores a recent article in Science showing
that North America has absorbed more car
bon dioxide over recent years than it erqit
ted. I;
According to these Princeton University
researchers, Canada and the United Stales
add nothing on net to greenhouse gas con
centrations.
In summary, the proposed treaty is not
only costly but will accomplish nothing. It is
being touted as a first step towards increas
ingly costly efforts to reduce fossil fuel con
sumption, a recipe for disaster.
Almost all objective observers agree that
global warming would have benefits as well
as costs. The net effect would be small. We
should wait before we leap.
