Axe Comm responds to endorsement
Before listing the reasons von should
support the Stanford Axe Committee spe
cial lee in the upcoming ASSU Election, I
would like to point out the entirely false
statements about the Axe Committee print
ed in The Daily special-fee Endorsements.
The Axe Committee has never been
offered to "be funded and integrated into
the Athletics Department." We have dis
cussed the issue of working more closely
with the Athletics Department, but the
Athletics Department has never offered to
fund the committee.
The committee is also not "stuck on the
issue of the Bonfire at Lake Lagunita."
While we continue to support discussion on
the possibility of once again having a Bon
fire, the Axe Committee is very focused on
finding a new and equally attractive Big
(iamc Rally site, promoting Big Game in
other ways such as the Big Game Count
down in White Pla/a and continuing our
traditional role at football games and other
sporting events.
We are far from "disorganized" as we
are currently planning our annual Frisbee
Golf Tournament and meeting with the
Office of Student Activities to find a new
rally site almost eight months before next
year's Big Game Rally is to take place.
The Axe Committee is stronger than
ever with a membership of more than 40
undergraduates dedicated to maintaining
the traditions of the University and sup
porting Stanford Athletics (not
"maintaining] ... its Athletics Depart
ment" as The Daily misprinted).

It would appear Fhe Daily did not do
enough research to make a correct and
informed endorsement of the Stanford Axe
Committee. Please keep this in mind when
you vote on today, and Beat Cal!

Weiss does not have good record
The Daily Editorial Board endorsement
of Adam Weiss for the ASSLJ presidency
has proven that The Daily does not care
about the candidates' track records as
ASSU officers. Presidential candidate
Weiss has failed to follow through on
almost all of the campaign promises he
made when he ran for the ASSU Senate last
year and the year before.
When Weiss ran for Senate two years
ago. his statement in the Elections Hand
book contained the following: "As an
ASSI J senator, I will: Demand that students
be actively involved in dining services com
mittees on cost-containment and quality
control. Draft legislation condemning the
administration lor its non-compliance with
federal law concerning the handicapped.
Require that the ASSU hold frequent pub
lic forums so that student concerns and sug
gestions can be addressed. Organize a
monthly newsletter detailing accomplish
ments and circulate financial statements to
students each quarter so that you know
your $6(X) ASSU fees are well-spent."
Weiss was elected to the Senate based on
that campaign statement. Since then, he has

not demanded that students be actively
involved in Dining Services committees on
cost containment and quality control.
Incidentally, Weiss's opponent in the
ASSU presidential election this year, Mike
Levin, is currently working on this very
issue by chairing the ASSU Task Force on
Dining Services. Weiss has not drafted any
legislation condemning the administration
for non-compliance with federal laws con
cerning the handicapped. The ASSU does
not hold frequent public forums so that stu
dent concerns and suggestions can be
addressed. There does not exist a monthly
newsletter detailing the ASSU's accom
plishments, and nobody has circulated
financial statements to students each quar
ter so that we know that our ASSU fees are
well spent.
A year ago, Weiss was elected to his sec
ond term in the ASSU Senate. His state
ment in the 1998 Elections Handbook con
tained the following: "Here is what I will do
next year as your ASSU Senator: Parking:
Look into the feasibility of less restrictive
parking permits. Facilities: Take action to
renovate athletic facilities currently in
unplayable conditions. Representation:
Hold office hours to hear student concerns
and pass a Senate resolution directing sena
tors to address them in a timely fashion.
Political Discourse: Bring all politically
active groups on campus into a union fos
tering more political awareness. Tuition:
Fight to keep tuition increases even more
modest though ASSU dialogue with the
Board of Trustees."
Once again, Weiss broke his campaign
promises. He did not hold the office hours

he promised (unlike ASSU President
Maren Norton and Vice President Santos
Marroquin). He neither passed, nor pro
posed, a Senate resolution directing sena
tors to address student concerns in a timely
fashion. There has been no ASSU dialogue
with the Board of Trustees regarding keep
ing tuition increases modest. I do not know
whether Weiss "looked into" making park
ing permits less restrictive, but this does not
seem to have happened during the past
year.
Candidates' past records of student
advocacy provide a preview of what we can
expect from them if we elect them again.
Weiss has broken most of the promises he
made when he ran for ASSU Senate last
year and the year before.
When going to the polls, Stanford stu
dents should base their votes on what can
didates say they will do in the future, but
also on what candidates have done in the
past.

Disappointed with amendment team
I was concerned when I found full-page
ads in the last two issues of The Daily advo
cating the proposed constitutional amend
ment. By my estimation, the cost of such
advertising is at least $1,6(X).
Is that money coming directly from the
undersigned supporters of the amendment
or from our student government? If the
