# ENDORSEMENTS
## Special-fee requests 
### 
In an effort to make informed special-fee
endorsements, members of The Daily's edi
torial board spent numerous hours during
the past week reviewing the budgets and
ASSU Elections Handbook statements sub
mitted by student groups requesting special
fees to the ASSU. Whenever possible, the
members of the editorial board met with
representatives of each group and asked
them about the group's goals, its accom
plishments during the past year, plans for
expansion or improvement in the coming
academic year and how special-fee funds
would be spent.
Based on the submitted information and
interview discussions, the board reached a
unanimous endorsement decision for each
group. The board has tried to include as
much information about each group as pos
sible in the explanation of its endorsements.
But The Daily encourages all students to
obtain a copy of the ASSU Elections Hand
book and read each group's statement and
budget to reach their own conclusions.
AS NOTED IN the evaluation cri
teria editorial published on March
30, The Daily has rated each stu
dent group on a 1 to 5 scale that assesses
the group's effectiveness and its value.
In evaluating the groups, the editorial
board closely examined the achievements
of the fee groups during the past year and
,the viability of the group's plans for the
upcoming year.
Student groups that are requesting a
special fee for the first time were evaluated
on their expected effectiveness and value
as set forth in their proposals and presenta
tions, as well as the viability of their plans
for the coming year.
Below is an explanation of the 1 to 5 rat
ing scale that was used as a composite score
'for a group's effectiveness and value.
i
5 — Group successfully met all goals set
out during the previous year, has a strong
sense of its constituency and an overarch
ing vision for the organization. Group's
.activities are a valuable component of stu
dent life on campus and fulfill a need that
would otherwise go unmet. Has a viable
plan of activities for the coming year and
has clear goals for improving on itself and
putting its funds to efficient and effective

use.
4 — Group has successfully fulfilled
almost all goals set during the previous
year and knows whom it is serving.
Group's activities are a valuable contri
bution to the Stanford community that
would be missed if absent. Group's plan
for the upcoming year is viable and
includes efforts to fulfill unmet goals and
use its funds effectively.
3 — Group has fulfilled many of its goals
and its plan for the upcoming year
reflects an effort to fulfill unmet goals
and achieve improvement. Group's activ
ities are a value to the Stanford commu
nity.
2 — Group has met few of the previous
year's goals. Plan for the upcoming year
does not clearly reflect effort to fulfill
unmet goals or does not seem viable.
Group's sense of its constituency is hazy
and its ability to effectively and efficient
ly use funds is unclear, even though the
group's activities could be of value to stu
dents.
1 — Group has met no goals and has not
proven its value to the student popula
tion. Group's ability to use funds effec
tively and efficiently is questionable.
The individual fee group summaries
below aim to convey the group's accom
plishments during the year and its plans
for the coming year.
Annual cost per student is indicated in
parentheses under the group's gross fee
request amount.
The per capita amounts are taken
directly from the ASSU Elections Hand
book. A "B" prior to the amount indi
cates the fee will be assessed to both
undergraduate and graduate students; a
"UO M indicates the fee will be assessed to
undergraduates only.
The Daily welcomes responses to its
endorsements from groups or students.
Letters will be published tomorrow on a
space-available basis. Only those letters
received by 3 p.m. today will be consid
ered for publication tomorrow.
Please submit letters via e-mail
addressed to letters@daily.stanford.edu.

Note:
Through no fault of its own, the Stanford Chamber Chorale was excluded from yester
day's special-fee endorsements. The editorial hoard was mistakenly led to believe that tin
Chamber Chorale was not on the ballot. It is included in today 's endorsements.

Spring Break (UO $2.68)
■CD ® © © ©
4 Alternative Spring Break takes 130 students
along for what many regard as their most pow
erful experience at Stanford. With more students
applying than can be accommodated, the pro
gram is growing quickly and included 11 trips
this year. With sound financial management, the
small increase over last year's special fee that
ASB requests seems justified, especially in light
of fundraising efforts at the Stanford Fund.

shown a good understanding of its constituency
by excluding a graduate-student-focused group
from under its umbrella.

sight on the budgets of individual teams, provid
ing for a streamlined spending proposal.

International $9,110.28
Undergraduate (UO $1.39)
Community
® (D ® ® ©
The orientation for incoming international
students is a much-needed sen/ice that gets no

University funding, and this is where much of the
group s special fee goes. The rest goes to
internationally themed programming held
throughout the year. Given the group's expens
es, it keeps its costs remarkably low.

Stanford Axe $10,500.00
Committee (UO $3.37)
®©© © ©
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded to
maintain the traditions of the University and its
Athletics Department. Its responsibilities include-
Big Game Week and the protection of the Axe
when it is on campus. The group relies entirely
on its special fee for operation but has made lit
tle effort to raise its own funds. It has turned down
offers from the Athletics Department and is not
using funds for working at Flicks to defray costs.
The group continues to be stuck on the issue of
the Bonfire and appears badly disorganized.

Stanford Band $57,130.00
(LSJUMB) (UO $8.72)
©©© 0 ©
The Leland Stanford Junior (pause) Universi
ty Marching Band is a Stanford institution. With
out its special fee, it would have trouble existing,

games, campus rallies or parties. It has kept its
expenses in check and is one of the most effec
tive special-fee groups on the ballot this year.

community to see a diverse array of perfor
mances for severely reduced or free admission

©®© © ©
This group has expanded significantly
through special fee funding in the last two years

and services to students interested in public pol
icy and to the campus as a whole. SIG continues

last year's request. Most of the special fee will go
towards the organization's operating budget.

Stanford Jazz $19,400.00
Orchestra (UO $2.96)
©©© © ©
The Jazz Orchestra has a solid program
which contributes significantly to the campus
artistic community, operating without support

ties around Stanford by collecting leftover food
from dorm dining halls and distributing it to food

Car Project (UO $4.70)
(D (D © © ©
The Stanford Solar Car Project has been
building solar vehicles and competing in races
around the world for almost 10 years. The project
has been very successful at receiving donations
but more than 60 percent of its total budget is

be beneficial to its members, the portion of the
population that it serves is small.

group, one with clearly set goals, a well-orga
nized budget and an excellent understanding of

ity speakers to campus.

Illustrated (UO $6.60)
(D © © 0 ©
Cardinal Illustrated is a full-color sports mag
azine covering Stanford athletics. It provides

Kids With $9,929.12
Dreams (UO $1.52)
(D © © © ©
Kids With Dreams has established an
impressive program and has a solid plan for
expansion with the aid of the special fee. How
ever, while the group claims that its fee request

the expansion, some special fee money will also
go to operating costs that are likely to be con
sistent from year to year.

special fee.

Society of $21,425.00
Automotive (UO $3.27)
Engineers
©©© © ©
In a first-tier engineering university, a group
like Stanford Formula SAE makes sense. The
group's goal is to conceive, design and build a
formula-style racing vehicle that will compete
with cars built by other leading engineering uni
versities. The organization is open to all Stan
ford students, and is asking for a special fee to
finance the production of an inaugural Stanford
vehicle. Thereafter, Formula SAE would pursue
more corporate sponsorship.

increase their efforts. The special-fee monies
will be used for CD production costs and for
touring.

Society (UO $5.57)
(D © © ® ©
The Stanford Debate Society provides a
forum for students to learn and practice the art
of parliamentary debate and participate in
domestic and international tournaments. The
society leads a summer debate workshop for
high school students and hosts a public debate
series. While we support its continued growth,
the group's request of $30,000 seems exces
sive.

(D ® © © ©
Stanford Mock Trial aims to increase knowl
edge of the American legal system through par
ticipation in events held by the American Mock

SSAE has worthwhile goals: networking engi
neering students of Asian descent with corpora

this group receives significant corporate sup
port and should be able to continue in its cur
rent state without a special fee.
