## Shoving off Sailing goes to Champs 
### Becky Blanchard 
While many Stanford stu
dents take spring as an opportu
nity to relax after two quarters
of tough academic workloads
and numerous activities, for the
No. 15 Cardinal sailors, spring
quarter means gearing up for
district and national champi
onships after nearly a year of
training.
With three Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate Yacht Racing As
sociation championship regat
tas slated for the next three
weekends, the sailing team is
looking forward to plenty of ac
tion this quarter.
This year's district races —
especially the team race —
should prove to be more com
petitive than in years past, as
four coed teams from the Pacif
ic Coast district are currently
ranked in the top 20 by Sailing
World magazine. No. 6 USC re
ceived the top nod in the dis
trict, with district contender
Hawaii ranked l2th. The quick
ly improving Rainbow Wahiine
made their presence felt last
weekend with strong first- and
fourth-place finishes at the St.
Francis Intersectional. Stanford
and No. 15 UC-Santa Barbara
are the other nationally-ranked
teams.

■ Saturday-Sunday: No. 15 Stan
ford at the PCIYRA Team Race
Championships, Long Beach,
Calif.

Stanford head coach Steve
Bourdow predicts that USC,
Hawaii and Stanford will all be
tn contention for national
|>erths in this weekend's
pCIYRA Team Race Champi
onship at Long Beach, Calif.
Two teams will qualify for the
Intercollegiate Yacht Racing
Association / Ronstan Intercol
legiate Team Race Champi
onship at St. Petersburg, Fla. He
Relieves the Cardinal is capable
j>f upsetting either USC or
£lawaii for a berth.
r "We have to have a good day
at districts [for a national
berth]," Bourdow said. "We can
doit."
Stanford must also hold off
challenger UC-Santa Barbara,
though Bourdow notes that the
Gauchos' late-season perfor
mances show that the Cardinal
has the upper hand.
"Santa Barbara was fairly
weak [last weekend]," Bourdow
said. "You could definitely see
that they're not improving very
dramatically."
Stanford has struggled with
team racing this season, after
graduating an experienced
learn of sailors that included
John A. Meade
Jind Dan Zimbaldi.
• In team racing, a team of
three boats representing one
School races against three boats
l:rom another school. All
Schools at the regatta race each
bther, and the championship is
determined by a round-robin
tournament of these races.
Team racing focuses on cooper
ation and strategy, while some
what downplaying pure speed.
Although it has not been Stan
ford's strength this year, with a
fairly young coed squad, the
Cardinal is in the running to
gain district honors and nation
al team racing experience.
In women's competition, the
Cardinal returns a strong and
experienced group of sailors
who are expected to be success
ful in district and national competi
tion. The ninth-ranked Stanford
women, led by junior skippers
Anika Leerssen and Sally Madsen,
will compete in the PCIYRA
women's national qualifying race
April 24-25 at Hawaii. Qualifying
teams will advance to the ICYRA
National Women's Collegiate Sail
ing Championship May 26-28 at St.
Petersburg, Fla.
The Cardinal women are com
ing off a third-place finish in the
President's Cup earlier this month.
Leerssen and junior Alexis
Krivkovich took first-place honors
in A Division competition, despite
not having sailed together during
winter quarter. The duo's promis
ing return to competition should
help the Cardinal in its bid to top
last year's 12th-place finish in the
national championship.
