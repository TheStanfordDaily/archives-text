# Joss named dean of GSB
## Australian banker will replace Spence 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper has appointed Robert Joss,
whom he credited with "having the
wonderful quality of being both an
insider and an outsider," as the new
dean of the Graduate School of
Business.
On Sept. 1 Joss will succeed cur
rent Dean Michael Spence, who an
nounced last year he planned to re
sign effective Aug. 31.
Joss received an MBA at Stan
lord in 1967 and a doctorate in 1970
from Stanford's Business School.
Joss currently serves on the Business
School's advisory council, a group of
external business leaders who help
review and shape the school's poli
cies.
Outside of Stanford, he has
served as a deputy to the U.S. Trea
sury Department's assistant secre
tary for economic affairs; a vice

chairman, among other positions, at
Wells Fargo b;uik; and the chief ex
ecutive officer and managing direc
tor of Australia's Westpac Banking
Corporation, where he was "one of
the stars of Australian banking," ac
cording to Casper.

"In recent history,
the Stanford Gradu
ate School of Busi
ness has had great
deans â€” Ernie Ar
buckle. Arjay Miller.
Bob Jaekicke and
Mike Spence -
some recruited from
the academic world,
some from the busi
ness world," Casper
said.
Spence has led the
Business School since
1990, guiding it
through a period that
has seen construction
of new school facili

ties, as well as academic initiatives in
global management, entrepreneur
ship and information technology.
Joss caps not only a long line of
prestigious business school deans,
but also a string of administrators re
cently appointed by Casper: Dean of

Humanities and Sciences Malcolm
Beasley; Kathleen Sullivan, who will
soon take over as Law School dean;
and soon-to-be Provost John Hen
nessy.
"1 was not aware of being the
fourth such appointee until 1 got

here a few days ago
and was able to learn
some of the history,"
Joss said.
Casper said that
he has learned "ever
more" with each ap
pointment and
stressed that,
"Speaking from ex
perience, being a
dean is truly the
greatest manage
ment challenge."
"At Stanford, we
have more product
lines than any com
pany in the Silicon
Valley," he added.

Joss said that moving managerial
skills across the globe will be critical
ly important in achieving his ambi
tion of "making Stanford the leading
school of management in the world.
"I see capital and technology
moving freely across international

boundaries, but not management
skills," Joss said. "If we focus on and
leverage what resources we have, we
can take a great place and make it
better."
He emphasized that Stanford's
position in the middle of Silicon Val
ley leaves the University poised to
seize the changes in technology and
communication that will revolution
ize the business world.
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
Business School Prof. Charles Hol
loway chaired the dean's search
committee, which began its work in
September.
"In an era of increasing techno
logical challenge and global interde
pendence, I believe the University is
indeed fortunate to find someone
with [Joss'] combination of keen in
tellectual skills, mixed with his ex
tensive experience in the business
world, particularly in the interna
tional arena," Rice said.
According to Holloway, more
than 1(K) candidates from around the
world were considered, but Joss
stood out.
"The people who've worked with
him describe him as someone who is


Robert Joss
a rare and compassionate leader
manager," he said. "He's basically
an intellectual at heart and values
the concepts and ideas and research
focus that set Stanford's GSB
apart."
Holloway said that Joss had the
combination of practical leadership
experience in high-profile corpora
tions and passion for Stanford's
Business School that the committee
was looking for.
"He also has a special apprecia

tion of the importance of research
and the role of [doctoral] students,
since he was part of the process dur
ing his own doctoral studies. He un
derstands that they are the people
who are going to deliver the research
that is going to have an impact on the
business world," Holloway added.
Aside from his Stanford degrees,
Joss also holds a bachelor's in eco
nomics from the University of
Washington.
Joss and his wife, Betty Badger
Joss, look forward to returning to
California to spend more time with
their two children and two grand
children.
