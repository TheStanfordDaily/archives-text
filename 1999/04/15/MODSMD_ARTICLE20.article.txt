Lately the Stanford women's
lacrosse team (13-4, 5-1 Women's
Western Lacrosse League) has
been annihilating everyone in its
path to the playoffs, including UC-
Davis. But that doesn't mean the
women won't be playing their
hardest this weekend when the
team travels to Davis looking for its
third victory over the Aggies this
season.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ Saturday: Stanford (13-4, 5-1
Women's Western Lacrosse League)
at UC-Davis, 1 p.m.

Stanford beat Davis in a decisive
10-2 victory earlier this season, and

are always such mental challenges
that we can't assume we'll be able to
walk all over them," said senior co
captain Carey Jones. "We are defi

if we don't go out and play a confi
dent game there is always the possi
bility that it will be a really close
matchup."
