## California State Championship up next for Cardinal rowers 
### Monica Sergott 
The crew teams eagerly await the season's
turning point races at Saturday's California
State Championships.
The men and women will face squads
from all over California including UC-Davis,
California, UC-San Diego, USC. UC-Santa
Cruz, UC-Irivine, Orange Coast College,
Sacramento State, St. Mary's and Santa
Clara.
The regatta will consist of morning six
lane heats from which the top crews will
move on to the afternoon finals. A good fin
ish in the morning is essential for a lane with
good conditions in the finals. The meet is es
pecially significant because the crews will be
ranked for the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships, which will then determine an
NCAA birth.

A good performance from all the boats is
crucial this weekend for success later in the
season.

■ Saturday: Stanford at the California State
Championships, all day.

The long clay begins with a 6 a.m. depar
ture from the Stanford campus. After the
morning heat the teams will rest and refuel
for the early afternoon finals.
The No. 1 California crew is the main
competitor for the men. The men's team will
be sending its varsity four and novice eight to
Sacramento.
Junior Ryan Radecki said the team will be
focusing on "a better rhythm, an aggressive
start and a solid first 1,000 meters."

The crew hopes to defend last year's
championship title which it won by three
tenths of a second over California.
The men are bringing out a new lineup for
the race with the return of fifth-year veteran
Jason Marsh from surgery.
Junior Santosh Heinrich said the team has
been working hard this week due to last
weekend's finish in Madison, Wise.
"The boat has been feeling a lot better.
We want to show we can go fast and win,"
said Heinrich.
Senior co-captain Nate Matter said "we're
expecting Cal to send a fast boat."
Matter also explained the team is hoping
to better on last week's race in order to
bounce back in time for championship com
petition. "A good race would help us build
confidence toward Pac-lOs," said Matter.
The women's main focus is UC-Davis,

while California and USC look to have the
strongest boats. The Cardinal is seeking re
venge from its last duel regatta in which the
Aggies were victorious.
"We're seeking revenge and have re
arranged lineups to get ready for Davis," said
junior Anne-Caroline Gamier. "We have to
go out there and make the best of what we've
been training for over the past nine months."
The varsity eight, varsity four and novice
eight have been preparing with their usual
workout regimen this week.
"The team had a breakthrough last week
end," said senior co-captain Katie Sears. "By
staying relaxed we made the boat move well
and established a successful rhythm. We had
a revelation about how to row together.
"Our goal is to build on that this weekend,
by applying more power and racing strategy
this weekend."
