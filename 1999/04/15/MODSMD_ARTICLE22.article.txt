Look around campus. The sun is out. sunglasses
are the norm and classes are meeting outside all over
the Quad and Memorial Court. It is spring time. And
that means it's time for the Stanford men's golf team
to get down to business.

■ Saturday-Sunday: No. 25 Stanford at the Thunder
board / SAVANE Invitational, Tempe, Ariz.

This weekend, the Cardinal travels to Tempe,
Ariz., for the Tunderbird / SAVANE Invitational
hosted by Arizona State on Saturday and Sunday.
In this final tune-up before the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships April 26-28, Stanford looks to
continue its strong play.
Coming off a win at last week's Western Intercol
legiate in Santa Cruz, Calif., punctuated by senior
Joel Kribel's second-consecutive individual title,
Stanford looks to the tournament as a final chance to
get things in order before the real work begins.
The squad is led by Kribel, a three-time All-Amer
ican and recent Dave Williams Award winner, who
has played very well in the spring season, rising to No.
6 in the national rankings.
The recent events are a fitting end to Kribel's stel
lar collegiate career. Kribel has tallied seven individ
ual tournament titles as well as numerous amateur ac
colades including invitations in the prestigious Mas
ters and United States Open tournaments and the
medalist trophy in the stroke play portion of the 1998
United States Amateur tournament.
Jimmy Lee, Dusty Brett, Alex Aragon and Eric
Dahlberg round out the top five for the Cardinal. All

have shown evidence of strong play this year but must
be able to put it together for the stretch run.
The Stanford team is currently ranked 25th in the
most recent Mastercard Collegiate Golf Rankings
published April 14. Georgia currently leads the na
tional standings, having traded off the top spot with
UNLV and Clemson, who currently stand second and
third, respectively.
Perennial powers Georgia Tech and Oklahoma
State round out the top five. Houston, Texas, Arizona
State, South Carolina and Minnesota fall directly be
hind in the second tier of five.
Head coach Wally Goodwin looks to recapture the
form that won Stanford the national title in 1994 at
Stonebridge Country Club in McKinney, Texas.
Goodwin has coached two Pac-1() championship
teams, three individual conference champions and
seven Ail-Americans including Kribel and a fellow
named Tiger Woods.
