## Four presidential wannabees seek fictional upperclass office 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
Whether or not you're a fan of breakfast
meats, you may have noticed the number of
ASSU-like campaign posters that appeared yes
terday morning with the slogan "Mmmm
Bacon."
SeniorsToban Green, Mike Huijon, Kimber
ly Myers and Tanicia Perry have adopted the
slogan as a way to promote their "campaign" for
"fifth-year class presidents."
The group of four, who will all begin their
fifth year at Stanford in the fall, decided to run a
mock campaign to become presidents of their
forgotten "class."
Although they do not appear on the ballots,
and no such position exists, the group encour
aged students to write them in anywhere they
thought appropriate.

"We aren't really making fun of the ASSU,"
said Myers, who in spite of her slogan, is a vege
tarian. "But we aren't totally serious either."
The idea was born earlier this week when
Myers was inspired by another friend who dis
tributed mock posters, which Myers found
funny.
She enlisted three of her friends who had
plans to be on campus on the fall and didn't mind
having their names appear on posters through
out campus.
Myers has previous experience on the ASSU
financial staff, although the others have not
been involved with campus politics.
The four slate members said they hoped to
participate in senior class events again next year,
and they invited other fifth-year students on
campus to "tag along" with them.
"I want to make the most of my fifth year,"
said Perry in explanation of why the group de

cided to launch their campaign.
Since Myers came up with the idea, the group
has considered getting in contact with whichev
er slate wins the position of senior class presi
dent in order to coordinate events.
They also may try to obtain a list of all of the
fifth-year students on campus in order to plan
bonding activities.
However, Myers joked, "It might take us a lit
tle while to organize ourselves since we are fifth
years."
As for their platform, the four promised "lots
of fun," including a Band Shak party in the fall.
Their flier campaign, Myers admitted, was di
rectly contradictory to the election commis
sion's rules. t ,-
