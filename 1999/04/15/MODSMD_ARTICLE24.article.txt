'•!"There is a real lack of minority role models. You can
give the statistics, but they aren't necessarily visible," said
freshmen Nolan Cabrera, who spent the evening convers
ing with Civil Engineering Prof. James Leckie. Cabrera

noted that he has never had a minority professor.
"EI Di'a de Ids Profes" originally stems from Mexican
tradition as a day to acknowledge the accomplishments of
teachers and educators. It ;ilso serves as a continuation of
student panels, collectively called "Profes 101," held dur
ing winter quarter.
"Profes 101" targeted freshmen and sophomores. It
featured seniors from varied disciplines who worked
closely with (liicano / Latino faculty.
Along with "Di'a de Ids Profes," it was meant to famil
iarize students with both the academic resources and the
various faculty contributions to Stanford's Chicano / Lati
no community.
"Events like these let us see that there are people who
are willing to help, you just have to actively pursue them.
They can understand the issues that we face because they
have faced them also," Cabrera said.
