Jacques Derrida, considered by
many the world's most famous liv
ing philosopher, will speak tonight
at 6:30 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
As the first presidential lecturer
of spring quarter, Derrida will ad
dress "The University." Sepp
Gumbrecht, coordinator of the
Presidential Lecturers Series, ad
vises those who plan on attending
to arrive early, since "the response
to Derrida's visit has been enor
mous."
"No other event has been so
popular," Gumbrecht said. "When
we asked for suggestions earlier in
the year for people, the name that
consistently appeared ... was Der
rida."
The 200 passes for Derrida's dis
cussion, which will be held at the
Stanford Museum on Friday, ran
out cmi the first day.
While Gumbrecht believes this
was due to Derrida's appeal as a
philosopher, he also thinks it is be
cause this is Derrida's first visit to
Stanford.
"We are probably the only top
university where Derrida has never
talked at," Gumbrecht said.
Perhaps most closely associated
with the philosophical movement

of "deconstruction" by the mem
bers of the general public, Derri
da's name has appeared in more ci
tations in humanities journals than
nearly any other philosopher ex
cept Michel Foucault.
Derrida dismissed questions
about deconstruction as "mechani
cal."
"I am the father of two sons. I
am not the father of deconstruc
tion. Deconstruction is an orphan,"
he said.
Derrida also declined to answer
questions related to old slogans he
is associated with, such as "there is
nothing outside the text."
Born in 1930 in El-Biar, near Al
giers, Algeria, Derrida studied in
Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris
in the 19505. After teaching at the
Sorbonne from 1%0 to 1964, Der
rida taught at several American
universities, including Johns Hop
kins and Yale.
Derrida now serves as the Di
rector of Studies at the Ecole des
Hautes Etudes en Sciences So
ciales, Paris, and professor of hu
manities at UC-Irvine.
In an interview printed in
"Points ... Interviews, 1974-1994."
published by Stanford University
Press, Derrida said, "In Algeria, I
had begun, let's say, to 'get into' lit
erature and philosophy. I dreamed

of writing â€” and already models
were instrueting the dream, a cer
tain language governed it, and cer
tain figures and names. It's like cir
cumcision, you know, it begins be
fore you do."
Comparative Literature Prof.
Richard Rorty, who taught a
course on Heidegger and Derrida
last quarter, says in his book. "Con
tingency, Irony, and Solidarity"
that, "Derrida stands to Heidegger
as Heidegger to Nietzsche. Each is
the most intelligent reader, and
most devastating critic, of his re
spective predecessor. ... Derrida
continues to think about the prob
lem which came to obsess Heideg
ger: that of how to combine irony
and theorizing."
Rorty continues later in the
book, "So I take Derrida's impor
tance to lie in his having had the
courage to give up the attempt to
unite the private and the public, to
stop trying to bring together a
quest for private autonomy and an
attempt at public resonance and
utility."
"On the one side, Derrida has
many fans," Gumbrecht said.
"There are also those who don't
completely get his philosophy, so
they have a fascination with him
and his ideas. There is a sense of
mystique about him."
