# Freshman Kang leads homeless aid group
## Helping PA's street people 
### Deborah Roth 
Most Stanford students have long since given up try
ing to find anything to do on the streets of Palo Alto on
a weeknight, but Angela Kang and her volunteers spend
their time bringing comfort and companionship to
homeless people who have nowhere else to sleep.
Kang, a freshman who spent part of her life in Korea,
runs Night Outreach, a program to assist the homeless.
She started the program as a community service work
study. The Haas Center for Public Service put her in con
tact with Dona Smith-Powers, director of operations
and personnel at the Palo Alto Urban Ministry, who had
the vision for the program.
Since Kang started the program in fall quarter, she
has already assembled 20 volunteers. Clifford Chen, a ju
nior, is one of them.
"Angela poured so much energy into that," he said.
"She basically hasn't been studying this quarter, because
she went to Palo Alto every night."
Kang and her volunteers meet the homeless in order
to provide them with information about shelters, food
programs or medical assistance.
"Especially people who are new to the area depend
on this kind of assistance," Kang said.
The volunteers distribute granola bars, deodorant.
