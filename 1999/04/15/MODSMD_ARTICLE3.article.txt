# Freshman Kang leads homeless aid group
## Helping PA's street people 
### Deborah Roth 
Most Stanford students have long since given up try
ing to find anything to do on the streets of Palo Alto on
a weeknight, but Angela Kang and her volunteers spend
their time bringing comfort and companionship to
homeless people who have nowhere else to sleep.
Kang, a freshman who spent part of her life in Korea,
runs Night Outreach, a program to assist the homeless.
She started the program as a community service work
study. The Haas Center for Public Service put her in con
tact with Dona Smith-Powers, director of operations
and personnel at the Palo Alto Urban Ministry, who had
the vision for the program.
Since Kang started the program in fall quarter, she
has already assembled 20 volunteers. Clifford Chen, a ju
nior, is one of them.
"Angela poured so much energy into that," he said.
"She basically hasn't been studying this quarter, because
she went to Palo Alto every night."
Kang and her volunteers meet the homeless in order
to provide them with information about shelters, food
programs or medical assistance.
"Especially people who are new to the area depend
on this kind of assistance," Kang said.
The volunteers distribute granola bars, deodorant.
soap and other basic necessities to
make the life of those without shelter
easier. Vitamins and sleeping bags
are also on the list of Night Outreach,
but since the program depends on do
nations, many of the material needs
of the homeless are yet to be satisfied.
One of the goals of Night Out
reach is to improve the relationship
between the homeless, Stanford stu
dents, the police and the rest of the
Palo Alto community.
"Most importantly we just talk to
[the homeless]," Kang said. "Friend
ship is the most important thing they
need."
The relationship between the
helpers and the helped is highly reci
procal. Kang describes her gain from
volunteering as "incredible."
"They are such great people," she
said. "Talking to them really makes
you understand how necessary every
body is in our society."
"I definitely get more out of the
program than [the homeless] do,"
Chen said.

Chen, who started to volunteer
this quarter, points out that the pro
gram is a chance to get off campus
and to be confronted with problems
of the real world.
He said that the program is an op
portunity "to hang out with people
you wouldn't normally hangout with.
It adds perspective, because they are
a lot different."
Clifton Watt, a senior, said the
program also helps to change the
image that some homeless have of
Stanford students.
"Most of [the homeless] think that
Stanford students don't care about
them ... and are [only] concerned
about their studies and themselves,"
Watt said.
Night Outreach is always looking
for other people who don't match
that stereotype to help. Support does
not have to come in the form of time.
"Donations are very important for
us," Kang explained. "They can be
snacks, toiletries, first-aid materials
or drug / HIV prevention materials."
She also pointed out that majors in
human biology are eligible to receive
academic credit for their volunteer
ing.
