# THEATER/FILM
## WONDERFULLY TRAGIC, HORRIBLY TRUE 'Long Day's Journey Into Night' at ACT 
### 
S ugene O'Neill's epic tragedy "Long Day's Journey Into Night" has
been hailed by many as the greatest play ever written by an
American. Anyone who sees the American Conservatory Theater's
current production of the play may understand why.
Based on the crises in O'Neill's own family, "Journey" follows two brothers,
Edmund and Jamie, and their parents, Mary and James Tyrone, as they strug
gle to cope in the face of an almost unbelievable burden of suffering and guilt,
all in the space of a single day from sunrise to long past sunset.
The O'Neill family's biography reads like a modern, New England adapta-

tion of "Candide" — perhaps only Edgar Allen Poe among great American writers lived through more unac
countable misery.
James "Jamie" O'Neill Jr., at the age of 7, gave his infant brother Edmund measles. Edmund died, and in
the play Mary Tyrone can never truly forgive Jamie for Edmund's death. Three years after the real Edmund
died (in the play, O'Neill has switched his own and the dead baby's names), Eugene was born, and his moth
er was given morphine for the pain. She became addicted. Her sudden descent into a full relapse forms much
of the substance of the play.
There are other threads of tragedy — James Sr.'s stinginess and lost artistic integrity, James Jr.'s alcoholism
and so on — but they only serve to intensify the tragedy. "Long Day's Journey" is a private confession elevat
ed to the scale of Greek tragedy. O'Neill expressed it best in his dedication of the

play. He called it a "play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood ... with deep

pity and understanding and forgiveness for all the four haunted Tyrones."
l Marco Barricelli captures Jamie's self-destructive charm with an
112 unflagging vitality; the audience is held in the same mix of awe, amuse
ment and pity as Edmund himself is. Josef Sommer plays the ex-matinee
idol James Sr. with a very human moderation, avoiding the hammy
t excesses of, for example, Ralph Richardson in Sidney Lumet's film ver
sion.
Pamela Payton-Wright overcomes her vague resemblance to Katherine

Hepburn (who played Mary in the film version) by bringing a welcome dose
of bizarre comedy to the role. Yet whenever a moment required unmitigated

tragedy, Payton-Wright made the transition flawlessly, moving the audi

ence from laughter to tears with subtle control. The moment when
she breaks through her morphine haze to apologize to James — "I
i tried so hard! I tried so hard! Please believe — !" is worth the price
I of admission alone.

Despite the only weak link in the play, Jason Butler Harner's
less-than-stage-size take on Edmund, "Long Day's Journey Into
Night" is a well-needed reminder of what makes the theater spe
cial. There were moments of pure theatrical alchemy in this pro
duction, moments when the entire audience was held in silent
captivity (a very difficult thing to do in San Francisco, I have
, learned). Anyone who doubts that ACT can handle a large-scale
I tragedy needs to see this play.
