"School of Flesh" lives up to its lurid title with a rather banal and
uninvolving tale of a bizarre threesome.
Jacquot struck gold with two releases in America during the past
year; along with "Flesh," he scored with the entrance of "Seventh
Heaven" into the States. Admittedly, he does have an eye for bring
ing surreal and weird situations into a film without stretching the
imagination too far. But he falters when he tries to create meaning
by stringing these individual scenes together.
"Flesh" is about a bored middJe-aged woman who sets her sights
on a man roughly half her age. The twist is that she meets him in a
gay bar working as a bartender. She is a wealthy fashion designer
named Dominique (Isabelie Huppert). With Quentin (Vincent
Martinez), she participates in a fairly heated session of flirty
glances. Dominique's girlfriend Teresa (Danikle Dubroux) thinks
she should go after him — who cares that he might be gay and is
barely in his 20s.
Okay, you're thinking, the set-up isn't too bad. This is essential
ly a fusion of "How Stella Got Her Groove Back," "Chasing Amy"
arid "The Object of My Affection." But then the sluggish story
nearly collapses with contrivance aplenty.
First, we meet Chris, the transvestite friend who warns
Dominique that Quentin is immature and cares little about people's
feelings. Dominique doesn't care. Then there's Soukaz, the attorney
who warns Dominique that Quentin duped him for money and cheap,
though brief, thrills. Dominique still doesn't care.
Dominique and Quentin endure a series of trials to their rela
tionship, which is almost entirely built around very satisfying sex. Their
personalities clash, their outlooks on life differ and their age and eth
nicities are on the opposite poles. (He's a young, poor French Algerian;
she's an older, richer Frenchwoman.) Why is she so set on him?
Based on a Japanese novel by Yukio Mishima, "School of Flesh"
doesn't really get under the skin of any of its characters. The peo
ple seem thin and flimsy, without any real personality or nuance.
None of them change — either for the better or the worse — and
this only makes matters more stagnant. French cinema has been
known for its fiery and passionate tales, but this film lacks both the
fire and passion that gave French cinema its well-deserved status.
