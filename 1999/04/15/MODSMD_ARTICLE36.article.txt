# THE 						KISS OF DEATH
## A 						lukewarm hello for 'Goodbye Lover' 
### 
d yews flash: goodness is for suckers, happiness is
/// for the wealthy, and the only reason to go to
€Ly r church is to have sex with the organist. The
only genuine act of joy for the characters in "Goodbye
Lover" is sexual intercourse. This they pursue with reck
less abandon, passing the rest of their time trying to kill
each other for the sake of a few million dollars in life
insurance.
Patricia Arquette plays Sandra Dunmore, a nympho
maniac who goes to church, sells real estate and adores
"The Sound of Music." She is married to a speedily
unraveling alcoholic (Dermot Mulroney) and sleeps with

his elder brother Ben (Don
Johnson). Ben, tired of
Sandra's exhausting sexual
timetable, dumps her for a
sweet and clumsy intern at his
office (Mary-Louise Parker).
Sandra is furious, tells her hus
band everything, and together

they murder Ben, expecting
that Ben's life insurance will
pass automatically to them.
At this point the already
convoluted love quadrilater
al is combined with some

sort of pentagonal murder structure. By the end of the
movie the plot has twisted roughly five times, and three
more characters have been added: Rita Pompano (Ellen
DeGeneres), a hard-hearted cop assisted by her gullible
Mormon partner, Detective Crowley (Alex Rocco) and a
killer (Vincent DeGallo) who pursues murder both as a
profession and as a hobby.
The plot twists, sadly, are desperate measures and
don't complicate the film so much as muddle it. The
God-like Joel Coen ("Fargo," "Raising Arizona," "Barton
Fink"), who wrote one-third of the screenplay, shows
himself to be refreshingly flawed in this case. A good plot
twist should shock but at the same time make absolute
sense, like the realization that your parents must, at some
point in their lives, have had sex.
The plot twists of "Goodbye Lover," by contrast, sim
ply fall upwards out of nowhere and demand acceptance
without a single apology or explanation. Anything might
have happened in this movie. Different people might
have survived the killing spree, there might have been dif-

ferent sexual combinations, and it
would still have been exactly

the same movie.
The performances are

admittedly quite good. "
Patricia Arquette manages to
combine sweet and tender

naughtiness with a patho
logical desire for ven
geance. Don Johnson has
finally managed, at this

late stage in his career,
to put in a perfor
mance that is nearly as
impressive as his tan.

But all the actors struggle
with the fact that their char
acters are little more than
plot devices, behaving like j
wind-up toys designed to J
kill and be kooky with no I
real motivations or desires. J
The humor is similarly
automatic, a series of sexual
puns and pratfalls. The jokes
resemble the kind that vicars


Patricia Arquette gives
the killer's kiss.
crack in sermons, a matter of
protocol alone, with no sense of
purpose or direction other than
to distract the audience from an
underlying tedium.
Perhaps this is all too harsh.
The crowd of Berkeley students
with whom I watched the
movie roared with laughter and
even applauded the portrayal of
the uncynical members of soci
ety as gullible and foolish. But
then, the Berkeley students got
in for free. You might not find
such cheap humor as funny
when you've spent eight bucks
for it.
