tion of "The Taming of the Shrew," like so much
post-Nirvana blah, has tried to ride on the coat
tails of greatness, instead of creating its own.
Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) is one of the
most popular pieces of eye candy at Padua High
school, so captivating that boys drool over the

F strategically placed straps of her sundresses. Part of
her appeal, no doubt, is the "look but don't touch"
mystique: unlike the rest of hormonal teen-aged
America, the Stratford girls aren't allowed to date, by
k rule of their teenage-pregnancy obsessed ob I gyn
» father.

After being asked out by both the school hunk
Joey and the doting new kid Cameron, Bianca is
ready to take drastic measures to break out of her
chaste cage, including pouting and stomping her
I precious feet. But the outlook is favorable. If
Bianca's older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) dates, says
dad, Bianca can too.

The problem? Kat's as sweet as poison and

twice as lethal to the esteem of the fragile adolescent egos pop
ulating Padua High. Needless to say, her chances and desires of
finding a Romeo fast are as easy as writing a sonnet about your
worst enemy. So Cameron and his friend, an ousted member of
the future MBA club, strike a deal with desperate Joey: bribe
Patrick Verona, the school's reigning man-of-mystery (leather
pants included), to woo the shrew and free fair Bianca.
It doesn't take a Shakespeare

scholar to figure out how this teen-spirit soap
opera will end. Even if "10 Things" weren't

based on "Taming" it would be predictable.
Instead of infusing Padua's student body
with the shrewd and catty self-awareness that
has driven truly entertaining modernizations
like "Clueless," or the picture of confusing
painfulness which marks every adolescent's
high school years (to some extent), taken to the
extreme in the recent "Never Been

Kissed," "10 Things" just whines and
moans.
The only mildly fun part of "10
Things" is watching Julia Stiles groove
her way through the film like a spark

in a field of dry brush: she has quiet *
flair, ambitious drive and devouring
power. Too bad her performance reveals
her surroundings as a wasteland.
