# HATING TO LOVE LOS ANGELES
## Adrenaline + syringe = ‘Go’ 
### 
yrf lanky, impulsive British guy
\Vy named Simon (Desmond
Askew) walks into a Jewish
wedding in a Las Vegas hotel and casino. He
just lost all his cash, so he's in search of free
alcohol and a little fun.
He teases two drunk bridesmaids in an
elevator with a thickened Irish accent and
eventually ends up in their hotel room for a
little three-way action. But then he sets the
room on fire, and he and his friend Marcus
(Taye Diggs) must escape in a stolen sports
car before their situation worsens. They still
don't know how bad things can get.
That's your typical out-of-control scene
in "Go," the latest movie from "Swingers"
director / cinematographer Doug Liman.
It's a great combination of sharp situational
comedy, a weaving plot and true-to-life
teen-aged energy.
"Go" borrows heavily from Quentin
Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction"; it's pretty much
impossible to ignore comparisons to the
cult neo-classic. But that's not such a bad
thing, since every Tarantino-esque element

is delivered success
fully without signs
j of outright copycat
ting, and John
r August's script is
definitely very fresh.
The movie works
like a dark and
r twisted episode of
"Seinfeld" (actually,
that's a bad analo

gy, but I want
to lay off the
"Pulp Fic-

) tion" thing
for a sec
ond). We
meet our

Go
Jay Mohr
Scott Wolf
★★ ★ ★

Polley),Simon, Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack
(Jay Mohr) — at the beginning as Ronna
complains about being evicted for lack of
rent money. When they split up, we are
treated to parallel storylines in which the
characters get in way over their heads before
reconvening in an anti-climactic finish.
Do you remember the intensity of the
needle-into-the-heart scene of "Pulp
Fiction"? Well, it turns out that Liman is
very good at building up those scenes, so
that there are four or five points in the
movie where you can't help but cringe.
Liman also has a knack for depicting real
istic lifestyles. He's especially good at show
ing outsiders the true nature of the glamor
ized Los Angeles area, since he's a native
New Yorker himself. What he did for the
L.A. lounge scene in "Swingers" he does for
the teen-aged party scene in "Go." One of
the settings is a nicely shot underground
rave. Music by techno artist BT comple
ments much of the action, and the well-cast
actors give dead-on portrayals of the confu
sion and freedom that is youth.
"Go" should appeal to a lot of people, and
I'm not just talking about the teenie-bop
pers who will watch the movie for Scott
Wolf and Katie Holmes. Fans of "Swingers"
will certainly not be disappointed, and yes,
even the Tarantino crowd will get its fix.
