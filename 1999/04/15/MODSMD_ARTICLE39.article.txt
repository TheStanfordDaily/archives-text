# CALLING ALL REALITIES
## Lose yourself in 'The Matrix' 
### 
112 T question is not, "What is 'The
(S/ Matrix'?" Rather, it's "How is The
Matrix'?" And audiences across the
country have a $73 million answer: "The
Matrix" is good.
Never mind that "Matrix" doesn't have an
original bone in its special-effects-laden body.
The plot nabs elements from science

The Matrix
Keanu Reeves
Laurence Fishburne
★★ ★ ★

fiction / action movies like "Alien," "Terminator" and "Dark City." But the
way those things are laced together and sugar-coated with visual goodies by
filmmakers Larry and Andy Wachowski makes for a spectacular flick.
"Matrix" stars Keanu Reeves as a hacker-turned-hero named Neo and
Laurence Fishburne as his mysterious mentor, Morpheus. The remaining
members of Morpheus' small band of rebels sport similar cool-sounding
names like Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) and Tank
(Marcus Chong).
Their enemies are an artificially intelligent race of machines which assume
human form as Agents, led by the grinchish Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).
The baddies want to keep the human race enslaved, using a computer pro
gram called The Matrix as their instrument of power. Someone's got to save
the world, and it looks like Neo's going to have to be the one to do it.
There's no need for acting talent in a movie with this kind of a budget; the
casting people basically picked performers who look bad-ass in sunglasses.
When the movie is over you'll want to buy a pair of Ray-Bans and wear them
around at night.
The true key to this movie's success is the action. There are definitely a few
holes and forced points in the story line, but you're never given enough time
to think about them. When Neo is waiting to see a prophet called the Oracle,
for example, you're more interested in the bald kid who can bend spoons
with his mind than the prophecy itself. Later on you forget about the whole
prophecy thing as you're mesmerized by a fantastic gunfight scene in a mar
ble hallway.
When they're not using computer-generated images, the filmmakers rely
on a lot of slow-motion techniques. There are slow-motion jumps from
buildings, slow-motion bullet casings falling to the ground, slow-motion gun
poses — everything short of slow-motion salads and sandwiches. There's
also plenty of the "Gap effect" (so dubbed by my friends who noticed that
they use the technique heavily in Gap commercials), a neat trick in which a
100 or so evenly spaced Canon
still cameras give the effect of a
movie camera rotating quickly
around a suspended object.
The only action sequences
that irritated me were the hand
to-hand combat scenes. The
jumps, punches and blocks
appeared choreographed to look
like Mortal Kombat fights, and
the actors executed them rather
badly. That plus the "computer
whiz saves the world" theme
made me wonder whether the
Wachowski brothers should lay
off the video games.
In any case, "The Matrix" is
the betit action movie currently
in theaters. Whether you go to
have fun questioning reality or
to see Reeves in a role that actu
ally fits him, it's definitely worth
the price of a ticket.
