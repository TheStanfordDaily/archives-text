# Alum helps EPA teens write Web sites
## McCarthy hopes to involve youths in new 'communities’ 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
Lan McCarthy spent his young life in elite institu
tions. He attended Andover. a private hoarding school
in New England, and graduated from Stanford in 1991
with a self-designed major encompassing politics, phi
losophy, economics and history. Now McCarthy is
helping develop communities outside those institu
tions by working with teenagers in East Palo Alto.
The 30-year-old McCarthy said his experience with
Andover and Stanford led him "to think about what
constitutes a community."
Last year McCarthy and friend Matt King founded
Open Voice, an independent nonprofit startup that
trains East Palo Alto teens to develop Web sites.
Open Voice spun off from a program at Plugged In. a
group in East Palo Alto that teaches youth about tech
nology.
McCarthy said Open Voice's mission is to "empow
er teens across the country to express and develop
their voices by creating online communities."
" The new medium provides you with a way to cre
ate discussion space without usual relationships," Mc-
Carthy said. "The Net offers a new definition of com
munity, which is pretty irresistible."
Approximately a dozen EPA teens have been hired
to create content, host chats and respond to the more
than 1 (X).(XK) teens who visit the forums on America
Online and the Internet.
McCarthy admits that some people are surprised
that a Stanford graduate would be working with East
Palo Alto teenagers. He said the mindset in Silicon
Valley is: "Cash is king; what are you getting out of
this?"'
Yet he asserts that Open Voice is "not moving into
EPA to bring [the company] something" in return.
"If gold was found in East Palo Alto tomorrow and
everyone became millionaires, we'd still be here," Mc-
Carthy said. Some of their projects include developing
the first teen site on AOL France, a sports writers' site
with Steve Young and Sun Microsystems, and a new
site called Sportsdivas for high school women athletes.
Although the organization offers after-school tu
toring, McCarthy does not necessarily consider Open-
Voice a community service organization. Many groups
in EPA tell the community " 'We'll come and help
you."' he said. McCarthy characterizes this attitude as
"disastrous" and "condescending."
King said. "It all boils down to the individual teens."
He believes that the real world project-based learning.
