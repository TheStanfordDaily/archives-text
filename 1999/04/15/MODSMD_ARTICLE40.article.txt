n indie rock show can be hard on the legs. Let's face
Si it- The music may be tight, the punk spirit may be
riding high, but no matter the quality of the antics
onstage, planting your feet firmly on a two-foot square of
hardwood floor in a tiny club swarming with the local scen
esters and (the laws be damned) a none-too-healthy allowance
of cigarette smoke and craning your neck towards the stage for
a decent glimpse of the action for three or four straight hours
is downright exhausting. Much like the experience of a cross
country red-eye flight, you notice your shoulders stiffening as
the blood pools in your slowly swelling feet. By the time the
second or third band takes the stage, you yearn to jump up and
down a little or run in place; anything to get the circulation
going again — but look out! See the suspicious glances being
tossed your way by the hipster kids around you? They think
you're dancing. Dancing?! At an indie rock show?! Blasphemy!
No, best to just grit your teeth and keep on bobbing your head
as your shoes feel tighter and your feet begin to go numb....
These were the kinds of thoughts running through my head
at a recent show at San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill club. The
latest tour organized by seminal Olympia, Wash., indie record
label K had come to town, and kids from all around flocked to
see what their favorite new platters from the Dub Narcotic
Studios looked like in person. As always, they looked (and
sounded) fine, as Olympia icon Tae Won Yu delivered his
trademark love-rock gush with his current band the KG, and
performance artist Miranda July treated the audience to a
multimedia narrative of schizophrenic angst. Stirring stuff, to
be sure, but by the end of Miranda July's set, that inevitable
lust for motion once again nipped at my ankles.
Enter ICU. From the moment the roadies began setting the
gear up onstage, it was clear that this was not your typical
three-member rock band. In place of the usual drum kit, gui
tar stands and amps appeared a veritable junkyard of pop
musical gadgetry from the past 30 years — from garage-sale
synthesizers and turntables to an acoustic upright bass and a
theremin, a curious noisemaker whose appearance always calls
to mind images of a '50s B-movie Frankenstein's lab and the
expectation that at any moment, angry blue sparks will fly
from its shiny silver antennae. If the clutter onstage looked
novel in the context of the show, the sound that the group pro
duced once it launched into its opening piece,"Yopparai," was
almost shocking. Suddenly the club was enveloped in a churn
ing cacophony of speedy drum-n-bass rhythms, groovy bass
licks and cuts from the turntables, all topped off by spacy

synth noodlings. It was then that a most amazing
thing happened: as if on cue, the kids all

began ... to dance.
So who is this band that brings the
seductive sounds of electronica to

jaded, punk rock ears? ICU (pro
nounced "eekoo," as in the
Japanese verb "to go") consists of j

three members juggling a multi
tude of sounds: Michiko Swiggs
on keys and electronics, Aaron
Hartman on upright bass and
Kento Oiwa on turntables, gui
tar, theremin, etc., etc., etc. At
the center of both the group's
modus operandi and its histo
ry, however, stands Oiwa. His
seemingly effortless handling

of the disparate elements of ICU's music tempts one to think
that he's been doing this sort of thing forever. But it's been a
long road on the way to finding a project which promises to
change the way some audiences think about easy genre dis
tinctions such as "techno" and "punk."
Years ago, Oiwa attended the prestigious Keio University
near Tokyo. A member of the inaugural class at the school's
experimental, high-tech Fujisawa campus, he studied topics
such as city design and Internet technologies under the rubric
of environmental information studies. His career as a student
in Japan, however, left him unsatisfied.
"I lived in Florida [during high school]. I pretty much grew
up and experienced the hardships of late teen-aged life here in
the States, and I couldn't really stand being in Japan," Oiwa
said in an interview.
Scheming to return to America, Oiwa applied to Evergreen
State College near Olympia, Wash., and ditched his classes at
Keio in favor of part-time jobs which would fund his eventual
move across the Pacific. When he learned that he was accepted
to Evergreen, he happily informed his professors of his deci
sion to leave Keio. "I was the very first student to quit from the
new campus," Oiwa said with a laugh. "All the teachers got a
kick out of it. None of them tried to stop me; they knew what
I wanted to do."
At Evergreen, Oiwa found not only an academic philosophy
that matched his own pace but also fellow students and mem
bers of the nearby Olympia community who piqued his cre
ative interests. It was there that he first met bandmates
Hartman and Swiggs, who was then a student of experimental
animation. Soon after, Oiwa met Pat Maley of Yo Yo Records,
another famous Olympia indie label, and began helping out
with the first years of the now-renowned Yo Yo A Go Go inde
pendent music festival. It was a serendipitous collaboration for
someone who had "always made music" but was previously

unaware that Olympia was one of
the hot spots for independent

music in the country.
Indeed, for anyone who lis

tens to college radio or has
I a friend who made a hand
stapled, xeroxed 'zine in
high school, Olym-pia
represents a mecca for the
purity of punk, a bastion
of the D.I.Y. ["Do It

Yourself")

ethic.

Even

larger organs making a name for Olympia punk such as the K,
Yo Yo and Kill Rock Stars record labels have largely escaped
stigmatization as sell-out corporate entities by staying relatively
small and giving bands free creative reign over their music.
Oiwa, whose first band in Tokyo had covered Beatles songs "note
for note," found it no difficult task to form a string of transient,
rock-oriented bands that would play a backyard gig or two
before fading into utter forgettability.
As prominent as Olympia punk and indie rock have become,
however, these genres by no means constitute the whole of musi
cal activity just underground of that idyllic Northwestern town.
As Oiwa himself is quick to remind, the city has played host to
an annual Experimental Music Festival since 1995, a forum for
radical new music such as avant jazz and noise from around the
world. And now that hip hop has (thankfully) ditched the fixa
tion with the East Coast / West Coast dichotomy, Northwest hip
hop has come of age as a scene unto itself. As Oiwa attests, will
ingness to play with musical forms "has been around, and there
are people that have supported it, but [these other genres]

just never got out of Olympia media-wise. Music here is
a lot more open-minded than it seems [from] the

outside."
The sounds of ICU stand at the head of a

minor movement to change that one-dimen
sional perception. Back when the band's

current label, K, was founded in 1982 by
Calvin Johnson, the standard for the

label's "sound" was set by the mopey,
off-key pop of Johnson's band of the
time, Beat Happening. Recent years,

though, have seen an explosion of
musical diversity in the K catalog, I
including forays into hip hop and 112

electronica. Almost as if declaring
symbolically that "just plain punk" is
no longer good enough, even
Johnson himself has gotten into the

act with his current band The Dub I
Narcotic Sound System, a group that
injects the simplicity of punk with the
danceability of an ironic, faux funk
groove.

Given the circumstances, perhaps it
was only a matter of time before Oiwa

began punching buttons on a sampler, *
scratching a needle across the face of a record

or waving his hands at a theremin. He began 1
adding beats and electronics to his one-stand

bands' performances, and it wasn't long before a
couple gigs stretched into three or four, and before he
knew it ICU was born.

"For some reason, [ICU] just started clicking. It's weird, you
know, projects I did would play a few parties and end up disap
pearing, and this one seems to keep going.... We just did what
we wanted to do, and K asked to put out our records. We said
sure, and it's done well."
It is all too easy to identify the elements of electronica present
in ICU's music when istening to an ICU record or CD, especial
ly in contrast with the K Records logo lurking discreetly in a cor
ner of the sleeve. Indeed, the synthesizers, drum machines, the
loops and samples are all there. Yet there's an aural element of
chaotic warmth that sets ICU apart from the giants of the genre
such as Autechre and Squarepusher. It's a shading which is diffi
cult to account for at first, but ask Oiwa and he'll tell you it's
their rock 'n' roll souls shining through: "I think it's because we
don't really feel like we're doing techno music. When we're doing
it we have more of a sense that we're doing music like Can and
Faust and Neu!; that kind of '60s German stuff. I think a lot of
the rock feel of our music, feeds into that. How they did it,

putting rock music through this sort of I
like psychedelic, hippy genre."
Filtering rock music through the influ

ences of psychedelic culture and doing the *
same with the culture of current musical tech

nologies, however, are entirely different projects.
The fact that ICU works on record is a testament to

the tenacity of their approach to production, a sort of painstak
ing sleight of hand. For while the great mass of current elec
tronic music is written with the aid of computers, ICU makes do
with their own hands and some rudimentary tools. When you
hear a bassline on an ICU track, it isn't produced by Sound Forge
but by Flartman's nimble hands on a decidedly imprecise wood
en bass. Almost all of an ICU song's many samples aren't cued
through the convenient artifice of a sampler but are actually
spun by hand off Oiwa's turntables. And the whole process of
recording doesn't take place in a cutting-edge, digital studio but
in the same Dub Narcotic Studios that the label's punk bands
record in, a facility of conscientiously outdated mics, equal

izers, mixers and tape recorders extant from the '60s
and early '70s. What does this mean for a band like

ICU when it comes time to record? It's pretty
damn hard.

"Our recording process would take five
times longer than [other electronica artists],
you know? Because when they miss half a

beat, they can just use a mouse on a com
puter and move it, but we have to record

the whole thing again. It's kind of funny
that we're trying to record drum and
bass music on that equipment."

None of which is to say that ICU's
members are technophobes or dis
dain computers in the name of D.I.Y.
• idealism. On the contrary, Oiwa
would be the first to blurt out a wish
list of new equipment like samplers
and hard disk recorders that he would
invest in if he had the money. "I don't
believe that technology can actually be

a limitation. So this is a more indirect,
more inconvenient way [of recording
music]; getting more equipment can

only help us. Instead of getting taken over
by [technology], we still have access to that
old equipment, so we can still use that."

ICU may overhaul its cache of high-tech good
ies someday, but for now the band's tightrope

* walk between the tonal and rhythmic possibilities
open to it through electronics and the restrictions

placed on it by its modest resources has helped it find a
sound all their own. An ICU song parlays material limitations
into discoveries of innovative substitutes which ultimately
sound more interesting than high-tech productions. A percolat
ing locus of incredibly diverse influences and devices, it might
contain the sounds of coldly ticking and bleeping machines and
the soulful imperfection of reverberating wood, the giddiness of
a decadent guitar riff and the austerity of a hardcore hip-hop
beat or scratched samples of Sonic Youth records and Japanese
folk songs.
In short, an ICU song is a transaction between poles so dis
tant that the resulting conjunction is a tension whose only hope
for release is its invitation to the listener to move, to dance.
And what better place to dance to ICU than at a live show, at
a club like the Bottom of the Hill where you can see all the scen
ester stoics lured into an undulating abandon by the welcome
sights and sounds of something new. ICU recordings may be an
enjoyable listening experience, but it is when seeing them live
that you realize what truly sets this band apart from the mass of


OK RECORDS

electronica artists gaining in popularity today.
"With techno they're usually just guys and a
mixer. So in that sense I think we're more of a
rock band than techno... we move, and we fall
and make mistakes, make jokes, strings break; I
crack jokes while tuning strings —~ it's the same
thing as a punk band — there's nothing better
than seeing it live. You don't get that at a techno
show."
What in the studio creates such a headache
for the band lends a dose of delicious spectacle
to its live show. On one end of the stage, Swiggs
sways intently over a bank of keys and knobs
while on the other, Hartman hops madly as he
slaps at his bass. And in the middle is Oiwa,
somehow executing the impossible job of
simultaneously tending to, not two turntables
and a microphone, but two turntables, a guitar,
effects switches, a beat box, theremin and the
ever-present lit cigarette — and don't think it's
easy to smoke under such circumstances.
Relates Oiwa, "[One] evening, while we were
playing, my cigarette butt fell off onto my
record, and it melted right where I needed to
use it. It was this obscure record from the '60s I
found in a thrift shop. That was in Dallas on
tour, and from then on in every city we tried to
find this record. Finally, in Burbank, California,
we found this record, and it was like $30 and we
had to pay for it. Originally 1 got it for like 50
cents, but I guess we were just lucky to find it."
A dozen other shows on the same tour probably
went without a hitch, but such mishaps are pre
cisely what one half expects to occur while
watching ICU's onstage musical acrobatics, and
it is precisely this tension that makes their
shows so appealing.
With music as creative and complex as
ICU's, it's hard to say whether the band is more
techno or punk. It's even harder to say whether
ICU's ambiguity heralds a step towards experi
mentation in rock or towards a more person
able form of electronica, but no matter the
direction, as long as the stepping takes place on
the dance floor, it must be a good thing.
