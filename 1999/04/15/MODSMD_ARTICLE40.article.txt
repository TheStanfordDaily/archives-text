n indie rock show can be hard on the legs. Let's face
Si it- The music may be tight, the punk spirit may be
riding high, but no matter the quality of the antics
onstage, planting your feet firmly on a two-foot square of
hardwood floor in a tiny club swarming with the local scen
esters and (the laws be damned) a none-too-healthy allowance
of cigarette smoke and craning your neck towards the stage for
a decent glimpse of the action for three or four straight hours
is downright exhausting. Much like the experience of a cross
country red-eye flight, you notice your shoulders stiffening as
the blood pools in your slowly swelling feet. By the time the
second or third band takes the stage, you yearn to jump up and
down a little or run in place; anything to get the circulation
going again — but look out! See the suspicious glances being
tossed your way by the hipster kids around you? They think
you're dancing. Dancing?! At an indie rock show?! Blasphemy!
No, best to just grit your teeth and keep on bobbing your head
as your shoes feel tighter and your feet begin to go numb....
These were the kinds of thoughts running through my head
at a recent show at San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill club. The
latest tour organized by seminal Olympia, Wash., indie record
label K had come to town, and kids from all around flocked to
see what their favorite new platters from the Dub Narcotic
Studios looked like in person. As always, they looked (and
sounded) fine, as Olympia icon Tae Won Yu delivered his
trademark love-rock gush with his current band the KG, and
performance artist Miranda July treated the audience to a
multimedia narrative of schizophrenic angst. Stirring stuff, to
be sure, but by the end of Miranda July's set, that inevitable
lust for motion once again nipped at my ankles.
Enter ICU. From the moment the roadies began setting the
gear up onstage, it was clear that this was not your typical
three-member rock band. In place of the usual drum kit, gui
tar stands and amps appeared a veritable junkyard of pop
musical gadgetry from the past 30 years — from garage-sale
synthesizers and turntables to an acoustic upright bass and a
theremin, a curious noisemaker whose appearance always calls
to mind images of a '50s B-movie Frankenstein's lab and the
expectation that at any moment, angry blue sparks will fly
from its shiny silver antennae. If the clutter onstage looked
novel in the context of the show, the sound that the group pro
duced once it launched into its opening piece,"Yopparai," was
almost shocking. Suddenly the club was enveloped in a churn
ing cacophony of speedy drum-n-bass rhythms, groovy bass
licks and cuts from the turntables, all topped off by spacy

synth noodlings. It was then that a most amazing
thing happened: as if on cue, the kids all

began ... to dance.
So who is this band that brings the
seductive sounds of electronica to

jaded, punk rock ears? ICU (pro
nounced "eekoo," as in the
Japanese verb "to go") consists of j

three members juggling a multi
tude of sounds: Michiko Swiggs
on keys and electronics, Aaron
Hartman on upright bass and
Kento Oiwa on turntables, gui
tar, theremin, etc., etc., etc. At
the center of both the group's
modus operandi and its histo
ry, however, stands Oiwa. His
seemingly effortless handling

of the disparate elements of ICU's music tempts one to think
that he's been doing this sort of thing forever. But it's been a
long road on the way to finding a project which promises to
change the way some audiences think about easy genre dis
tinctions such as "techno" and "punk."
Years ago, Oiwa attended the prestigious Keio University
near Tokyo. A member of the inaugural class at the school's
experimental, high-tech Fujisawa campus, he studied topics
such as city design and Internet technologies under the rubric
of environmental information studies. His career as a student
in Japan, however, left him unsatisfied.
"I lived in Florida [during high school]. I pretty much grew
up and experienced the hardships of late teen-aged life here in
the States, and I couldn't really stand being in Japan," Oiwa
said in an interview.
Scheming to return to America, Oiwa applied to Evergreen
State College near Olympia, Wash., and ditched his classes at
Keio in favor of part-time jobs which would fund his eventual
move across the Pacific. When he learned that he was accepted
to Evergreen, he happily informed his professors of his deci
sion to leave Keio. "I was the very first student to quit from the
new campus," Oiwa said with a laugh. "All the teachers got a
kick out of it. None of them tried to stop me; they knew what
I wanted to do."
At Evergreen, Oiwa found not only an academic philosophy
that matched his own pace but also fellow students and mem
bers of the nearby Olympia community who piqued his cre
ative interests. It was there that he first met bandmates
Hartman and Swiggs, who was then a student of experimental
animation. Soon after, Oiwa met Pat Maley of Yo Yo Records,
another famous Olympia indie label, and began helping out
with the first years of the now-renowned Yo Yo A Go Go inde
pendent music festival. It was a serendipitous collaboration for
someone who had "always made music" but was previously

unaware that Olympia was one of
the hot spots for independent

music in the country.
Indeed, for anyone who lis

tens to college radio or has
I a friend who made a hand
stapled, xeroxed 'zine in
high school, Olym-pia
represents a mecca for the
purity of punk, a bastion
of the D.I.Y. ["Do It

Yourself")

ethic.
