## THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS Nas I Am (Columbia Records) 
### 
n hip hop lore, Nas is one of the few great
112 prophets. Following the release of his
IIS seminal 1994 debut "lllmatic," hip hop
enthusiasts bestowed this title upon Nas, deeming
him the second coming of hip hop's original god,
Rakim. Nas painted vivid pictures of life in Queens,
N.Y., with his unpolished flow and blunt lyrics,
staking his claim as the quintessential urban griot of
hip hop's new school. But his second offering, "It
Was Written," transformed Nasty Nas into Nas

Escobar, the Versace

wearing,
Cr is t a I -
sipping
mafia don,
md aimed

for wider com
mercial appeal at
the expense of
his credibility.

His latest record,
"I Am ..is an

r effort at reconcilia
tion between these
multiple identities, of
which he is acutely
aware: "As far as rap
go / It's only natural 1

explain / My plateau, and also / What defines my
name / First it was Nasty / But times have
changed / Ask me now, I'm the artist / But
Hardcore / My signs are pain."
Unfortunately,"! Am ..falls flat in its appeal to
both the traditional and commercial fan bases due
to extremely lackluster production. Trackmasters,
who handle most of the production, prove deserv
ing of the nickname "wackmasters," imparted upon
them by discriminating fans. If there is such thing as
a cliche in beat production, they employ just about
every one: overly complex syncopated beats and
dramatic orchestral samples, to name a couple. The
production sounds woefully manufactured, with
paper-thin beats better suited to 'N Sync or Brandy.
*n<e only bright moment comes from "Nas Is Like,"
where Nas spits lyrics over a rugged I)J Premier
beat. It is reminiscent of the "Illmatic" days,
reminding desirous listeners of what once was.
The critical lesson from"I Am ..." is the impor
tance of both lyrical and production excellence in
creating an effective album. Even though his themes
have changed through the years, Nas is still one of
the most gifted MCs in the game. If Nas were sup
ported by beat masters like Premier, Pete Rock and
Q-Tip (as he was on "Illmatic"), "I Am ..might
begin to approach "Illmatic" status. Yet Nas is over
whelmed by pitiful production and innocuous
cameos. Revered by admiring fans through thick
and thin, the prophet Nas is brought to his knees on
"I Am ..." in what will go down as 1999's greatest
disappointment.
