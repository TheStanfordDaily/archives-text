# Old Time Relijun
## Uterus and Fire (K Records) 
### 
Time Relijun makes ugly and brutal
ff/J music. The trio from Olympia, Wash., has
just released a new disc, lovingly entitled
"Uterus and Fire." At their best, the songs within are
loose and ragged. At their worst, they are arrogant,
pretentious exercises in sonic primitivism.
The rhythm section sounds like it had to pillage
the kitchen for instruments, the guitars seem to be
strung with telephone wires and Arrington de
Dionyso's vocals are an unholy cross between art
school exhibitionism and punk aggression. On
tracks like "Office Building," de Dionyso does his
best to sound menacing over a stilted rhythm, but
ultimately, lunatics blurting lyrics like "Hey Mr.
Devil / 1 got a shovel / Gonna dig you a hole / You
can make your home there / Hang up a picture of
your favorite movie star" only sound stupid and / or
silly.
"Uterus and Fire" represents the same wrong
headed notion which led Lou Reed to make his
techno anti-masterpiece, "Metal Machine Music."
Simply put, underground musicians sometimes feel
that the only way to be "true" to their "music" is by
making it as unlistenable as possible. The band
hides under an intellectual sheen of free jazz and
demonism, but ultimately its songs are uncon
scionable drek.
The tragedy is that if the group wasn't composed
of such poseurs, Old Time Relijun could probably
makes some decent music. A few of the tracks, such
as "Archaeopteryx Claw" and "Jail," display a credi
ble sense of organic rhythm, and de Dionyso could
sound compelling if he didn't avoid all traces of
structured melody.
As it stands, however, "Uterus and Fire" can't be
recommended to anyone except that small sub
group of people who take joy in pretending that
beauty is ugliness.
