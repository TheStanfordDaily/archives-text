# Trans Am
## Futureworld (Thrill Jockey) 
### 
D.C.'s Trans
Am has been mixing
fJ electronic experimenta
tion with driving indie rock for
years now, but with each subsequent
record the balance between the two
has been shifting farther and farther
away from rock and closer to pure
electronics. And as much as I do

really like this new concept album, I must admit, I
liked Trans Am better as a rock band.
It's clear that the group is being super tongue-in
cheek about its latest endeavor. By titling this latest
album "Futureworld" — at a time when everyone's
creaming on each other over who can create the
most technologically advanced sounds — and then
using Casio keyboards and cheez-ball electronic
drum beats on the record, the band gives a sarcastic
slap in the face to the entire genre of "electronica"
while proving that musical creativity has very little
to do with how advanced one's equipment is.
My hang-up is just that I like rock, and Trans Am
used to really rock. I like loud guitars. So 1 was a bit
disappointed to hear only three songs with notice
able guitars. These tracks were classic returns to
form: "City in Flames" and "Am Rhein," rock as hard
as anything on Trans Am's first album, and the clos
er, "Sad and Young," equals the beauty of the final
track of their second album, "Surrender to the
Night."
However, there are still several examples where
the new sound works quite well. In particular, the
title track — a perfectly dark, brooding keyboard
soundscape — evolves into a killer groove by the
song's end.
I should have said by now that the biggest sur
prise to long-time fans will be the very prominent
use of vocals on half the songs, which is definitely a
major change from their characteristically all
instrumental work of the past. The vocals fit the
Atari-game motif perfectly —as the singing is
purely of the cyber-robotic effects variety — but
they can get annoying fairly quickly. Fred Erskine of
June of 44 also makes a couple of nice appearances
on trumpet.
Overall, I heartily recommend this to most read
ers, as you've most likely never heard anything like
what this band accomplishes. And lastly, I have to
endorse them, if only because Trans Am has the
only left-handed drummer I've ever seen.
