# Mocket
## Pro Forma (Kill Rock Stars) 
### 
duo of Audrey Marrs and Matt
LSm Steinke (the permanent members of
Mocket) has teamed up with the ladies
in The Need to produce its third full-length release,
this time on Kill Rock Stars. Its sound is distinc
tively Mocket — sharply aggressive, with angst
filled vocals and a supersonic passion — yet "Pro
Forma" takes these elements and launches them
into an evolved state. With the percussive brilliance
of The Need's Rachel Carnes and Radio Tragedy
and the group's use of customized modulation sys
tems and added keyboards, Mocket propels itself
further into the realm of new-wave / post rock
with an accessibility and uniqueness that repre
sents the band's ability to harness the power of its
own creation.
The sound of Pro Forma differs from Mocket's
previous releases in that some of the more retro
sounding elements have been replaced by a more
rhythmic use of percussion, noise samples and
edgy beats. Both Marrs and Steinke's vocals are still
as striking as ever, but this time around they have
added distortions and manipulations, effecting an
even more dynamic presence in each of the tracks.
Mocket's incorporation of a variety of instruments
and sounds gives the record a much more layered
and complex feel. The shifts and changes within
each of the songs are striking, yet remarkably flaw
less and interesting.
All 13 tracks have their own complexities and
passion-filled angst, ranging from the eclectic
weirdness of "Monitress" to the eerie ambience and
electronic beats of "Bonecrusher." Every song
demands attention, and Mocket has without a
doubt pushed to itself to a new level once again.

Mocket will be performing live on the
Stanford campus on the evening of Friday,
April 23, at the Enchanted Broccoli Forest.
