/"Tyr'wsX. the Mountain Brothers indepen
dently released its five-song demo EP,
which by word of mouth and mix-tape
cameos alone achieved highly sought-after status.
Then came the Sprite emcee contest, in which the
trio won a nationwide radio spot. When the band
finally signed with Ruffhouse — the Sony label
responsible for the likes of Cypress Hill, Kriss Kross
and The Fugees — its fate seemed to be sealed: uni
versal distribution, guaranteed exposure — the
world of major labels.
But the group was reportedly forced to sit and
marinate while Ruffhouse concentrated on more
"viable" acts, and the MBs decided to cancel its
contract and go out on its own. The remarkable

result is "Self: Volume 1," a debut LP which does
something increasingly rare in the hip hop world,
where posthumously released, multi-disc and
remixed-to-death albums are the norm. "Self:
Volume 1" lives up to its full potential.
Members Peril-L, Styles and Chops share mic
duties equally, while Chops also doubles as the
group's DJ and producer. Peril maintains a lyrically
complex structure throughout the entire album,
while Styles always comes through with the killer,
killer punchlines ("I got your neck snappin' harder
than Barbara Eden granting wishes..Chops is as
recognizable for his swiftness on the cut as he is for
his booming vox — he may well have unseated Pete
