/"Tyr'wsX. the Mountain Brothers indepen
dently released its five-song demo EP,
which by word of mouth and mix-tape
cameos alone achieved highly sought-after status.
Then came the Sprite emcee contest, in which the
trio won a nationwide radio spot. When the band
finally signed with Ruffhouse — the Sony label
responsible for the likes of Cypress Hill, Kriss Kross
and The Fugees — its fate seemed to be sealed: uni
versal distribution, guaranteed exposure — the
world of major labels.
But the group was reportedly forced to sit and
marinate while Ruffhouse concentrated on more
"viable" acts, and the MBs decided to cancel its
contract and go out on its own. The remarkable

result is "Self: Volume 1," a debut LP which does
something increasingly rare in the hip hop world,
where posthumously released, multi-disc and
remixed-to-death albums are the norm. "Self:
Volume 1" lives up to its full potential.
Members Peril-L, Styles and Chops share mic
duties equally, while Chops also doubles as the
group's DJ and producer. Peril maintains a lyrically
complex structure throughout the entire album,
while Styles always comes through with the killer,
killer punchlines ("I got your neck snappin' harder
than Barbara Eden granting wishes..Chops is as
recognizable for his swiftness on the cut as he is for
his booming vox — he may well have unseated Pete

Rock as the world's finest emcee-DJ-produc
er. His beats, to borrow a phrase from fellow
Philadelphians The Roots, are on some
organic-type shit — noted for using no sam
pled music whatsoever. Chops plays or syn
thesizes and records all the music himself and
can be consistently counted on to provide a
fat bottom-end and many more complex lay
ers on top.
Few of the Mountain Brothers' contempo
raries can compare to the sheer lyrical and
musical energy of songs like "Galaxies,"
"Fluids" and "Whiplash." Even the lone sur
viving track from the EP "Paperchase" main
tains its freshness even though it was first
released almost three years ago. Additionally
the trio infuses its own brand of humor
throughout the album, going so far as to
include hilarious parodies of entire songs
(my personal favorite is the ass-up booty
bass "Oh-oh-oh").
Best of all, "Self: Volume 1" is proof of
what can be achieved without the interfering
hands of a major label. When news of the
Ruffhouse crash came, there was worry that
the Mountain Brothers would join the likes of
the Ras Kass demo and Supernatural as the
greatest hip hop never heard. This LP proves
those fears unfounded. Finally...
