L>y Tibet" begins like a
£ S soundtrack to a bad

dream. At
first it

leaves you wondering where the actual music is —
there are sounds of birds and children, computer
beeps, scratched records, annoying beeping sounds
and not much else. Eventually, though, the musicians
pick up their instruments and create a unique, folky
sound that emanates a psychedelic euphoria full of
acoustic guitar, strings, bells, harmonic voices and
experimental keyboard sounds. Unlike most artists
who claim to be working to free Tibet, Ghost inte
grates its political cause into virtually every song,
with song titles like "Lhasa Lhasa" and a very clear
depiction of the terrors that Tibetans are experienc
ing on the album cover. These Japanese musicians
deserve a good listen.
