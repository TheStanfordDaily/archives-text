yrf perfect city might sound like TOE2OOO,
\\y with the oceanic rhythm of traffic over
laying the incidental noise from boiler
rooms. If the elemental axes of the world are time
and space, the track "Pansy" maps onto the latter,
sketching a place that lacks a focal point and allows
the listener's gaze to range without direction.
Yoko Noge is the album's downfall: her nasal-

voiced chants enter to ruin several tracks.
TOE2ooo's forte is not the linearity of language
driven sound, and the unevenness of the album
leaves one lunging for the CD player's "skip" bar.
