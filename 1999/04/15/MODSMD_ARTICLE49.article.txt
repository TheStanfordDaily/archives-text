# The
						Delgados
## Peloton (Beggar's Banquet) 
### 
r^ 0 he Delgados' latest release, "Peloton," is a
L>y somewhat derivative collection of indie
rock. This Glasgow quartet has obviously
spent a fair share of its time listening to Pavement,
and with song titles like "The Weaker Argument
Defeats the Stronger," the band doesn't seem to be
hiding its roots.
Still, though their music is not brimming with
originality, the group has a loose, tuneful quality
which can be quite endearing. On tracks like
"Everything goes around the water" and "Pull the
wires from the walls," the band displays an impres
sive sense of texture and dynamics as well, suggesting
that its members' songwriting skills are developing.
Not exactly the stuff of revolutions, but "Peloton" is
no cause for shame either.
