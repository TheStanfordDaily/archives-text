[\_yjJ scorned: Somehow, we have all
heard a wince-worthy story or two
about penile mishap. But, urban legends aside,
what can really happen to that most prized of
male possessions? A lot.
The fact is, the external placement-of the
male genitalia makes them a prime target for
real damage. When Miss Sass says that she
actually knows boys who have suffered at the
errant teeth of man's best friend, she isn't fib
bing. And sometimes, even without outside
intervention, things can go wrong.
Ironically, the harder the penis is, the more
vulnerable it is to injury. During sex, you may
feel like the invincible Captain Libido, but
you're actually sticking your neck out, genital
ly speaking. So, dear boys, to keep you from
becoming one of the four million American
men who are impotent because of an injury
during sex or masturbation, here is a guide to
penile care and feeding. Cross your legs and
read on.
First, a little anatomy lesson. When it comes
to penises, what appears to be a solid rod is in
reality a pair of tluid-filled chambers — a
double-barreled shotgun of love. (Really, it's
more like a couple of long balloons, but I
thought you would appreciate the gun
metaphor.) When you're turned on, these
chambers or "erectile bodies" fill with blood,
and the elastic-like "tunica" that covers them
expands in length and width. When that hap
pens, presto, you're hard.
It doesn't take much imagination, then, to
see how things could get unfortunately com
plicated. Think of bending a fully-inflated
water balloon. The water has no place to go
and so it pops. Likewise, blood can get pushed
into one end of the erectile bodies and burst
through the tunica. This type of thing is called
a "penile fracture," and it can be recognized by
a horrible cracking sound and then swelling
and bruising. (You won't bleed externally,
since the blood will be caught between the
tunica and the skin.)
As if this wasn't bad enough, researchers
believe that injuries such as this lead to a con
dition called Peyronie's Disease. Basically, this
is when scar tissue (sometimes called fibrous
plaque, Heaven knows why) forms as a result
of stretching one of the erectile bodies. This
prevents the penis from expanding like it nor
mally would. So, like a balloon with tape on
one side, when you get hard you also get bent.
As the disease progresses, the penis gets
narrower and softer during erection, and the
curves can get so unwieldy as to justify the
word pretzel in association with them. Having
an erection also becomes a painful occasion, as
well as an embarrassing one aesthetically, and
not surprisingly the boy's sex life suffers right
along with his organ.
How to keep such calamities from befalling
your own little fellow? A few ounces of pre
vention, as follows:
1. Don't manhandle your manhood.
According to Miss Sass's source, a lot of hurt
results from men trying to get rid of an ill
timed erection. He says that it is not uncom

mon to shove a woody into a tight pair of
BVD's or slap it around to get it to behave.
Now, while it is doubtful that you're pistol
whipping yourself out of a frenzy, you proba
bly could be more gentle with yourself. Put a
book on your lap, grin and bear it.
2. Grease the machinery to keep it running
smoothly. Having sex without sufficient lubri
cant is not only the surest way to shred your
condom but will also give your penis more of
an opportunity to catch and bend in the worst
of ways. Use a good water-based lube like KY
or Astroglide to make sure all stays on the up
and up.
3. Clue in your girlfriend. When having sex
with the woman on top, it is altogether possi
ble (if you're doing it right) that she be over
taken by pleasure and start whipping her
pelvis about with abandon. What she may not
know is that she can bend your penis like that
or move out of position so that when you
thrust, you'll miss and bend it yourself. So,
inform her before sex, and you'll both be bet
ter off. Which brings us t0....
4. Don't suffer in silence. If a certain posi
tion always makes you twinge or something is
unusually uncomfortable, stop and switch.
And, naturally, go to the doctor ASAP if you
chance to hear any of those aforementioned
popping sounds or see any (unusual) swelling.
However, if you think you might already
have Peyronie's Disease, take heart. First off,
you're not alone. Urologists now see one or
two patients with worrisome, curved penises
each month, compared to two a year in the
19705. And secondly, there are quite a few
treatments to straighten you out. Oral med
ications like vitamin E and Potoba (a type of
vitamin B) will work to decrease those pesky
fibrous plaques. Surgery is always ail option,
and research on scar prevention continues
(for you pre-meds looking for jobs).
Of course, penises naturally sprout in all
colors and shapes, and some just happen to be
curvy. And a curvy, fully functioning tool is
nothing to worry about. In fact, given that a
lot of sex toys are made with a curve built in,
you could say that the shape is coveted by
some.
Miss Sass just wants to make sure that there
isn't a bend where you don't want one. In her
day, she has actually known someone who
managed to get his penis caught in the paper
shredder at work, and given the chunk that
was missing, she thinks he should have known
these things. And so should you.
