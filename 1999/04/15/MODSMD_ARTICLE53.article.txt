Hoping to discover a nice, romantic restaurant
for a date, we stumbled upon Gambradella's last
week. Located a block east of El Camino Real, this
Italian restaurant offers a variety of pasta and
meat dishes in a cozy environment. The dimly lit
restaurant has a long string of garlic and peppers
hanging from the ceiling, and the walls were cov
ered with empty bottles of wine. Though this
made for a quaint environment, the exterior of the
restaurant detracts greatly from the overall dining
experience. Stepping in a puddle in the poorly lit
parking lot did not get the evening started on the
right foot. Once we were finally seated at our win
dow table, we were treated with a view that looked
out upon the Cal trains. The whizzing trains' blar
ing horns did not complement the soft and easy
Italian background music in the restaurant.
Gambradella's is staffed with courteous waiters.
The overall service, however, is quite poor. The
menu does not provide the customer with a large
variety of Italian dishes but instead the chef con
centrates on cooking common pasta dishes and a
few Italian-style veal and chicken plates.
Our meal began with warm, home-baked
bread. Unfortunately, everything was downhill
after this auspicious beginning. Adrien selected
carpaccio, the house specialty appetizer. The meat
in this dish was rather salty and detracted from the
dish's overall delicateness.
David began his meal with a mixed green salad
with blue cheese, which was flavorful and refresh
ing, even though it arrived 10 minutes after
Adrien's appetizer. We understand the Italians
enjoy prolonging their dining experiences, but it
would have been nice for the two of us to eat our
courses contemporaneously.
For the main course, David had a corkscrew
pasta with tomato sauce and zucchini and large
chunks of tomatoes. Despite its spicy kick, the
corkscrew pasta was badly in need of some inspi
ration. Adrien had the penne pasta in a light cr£me
sauce with sausage. An unlikely paring of spicy
meat and cheese sauce, it appealed to Adrien's
sense of adventure. Excitement is only one criteria
on which to base one's pleasure with his food,
however, and Adrien's dish failed on most other
counts.
The cannolli for desert was cool and refreshing,
but it was not able to make amends for the previ
ous specious dishes we had been served. If you are
looking to take a date out for Italian close to cam
pus, keep looking. Gambradella's isn't the place.
