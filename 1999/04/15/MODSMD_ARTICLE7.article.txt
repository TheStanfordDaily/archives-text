# Conference looks beyond nationalism
## 
### Sylee Gore Staff writer 
The Ethics in Society Program
and the Center for International
Security and Arms Control are co
sponsoring a three-day conference
on "Cosmopolitanism and Nation
alism."
The conference kicks off
tonight with a keynote address by
Shashi Tharoor, director of com
munications and special projects at
the United Nations.
The conference is billed as a re
sponse to "a resurgence in appeals
to nationalism and ethnic differ
ence, appeals which threaten to
drown out the claims of our com

mon human identity."
These appeals raise the ques
tion of whether nationalism can be
made compatible with "a humane
world order."
Scholars, legal theorists and pol
icy activists drawn from around the
world will seek to address these is
sues in a series of talks and panels
focused on human rights, immigra
tion, cultural diversity, internation
al redistribution, intervention and
sovereignty.
Speakers include Martha Nuss
baum and Yael Tamir. Nussbaum,
affiliated with the Law School, the
Divinity School and the Depart
ment of Philosophy at the Universi
ty of Chicago, is scheduled to speak
on "Duties of Justice, Duties of
Mutual Aid: Cicero's Problematic
Legacy." She has written exten
sively on issues of international jus
tice and development.
Tamir is a professor of political
science at Tel Aviv University, as
well as being actively involved in Is
raeli politics. She is slated to discuss
" The Revolt of the Masses."
Fori Gruen, acting director of
the Ethics in Society Program, said
the conference is a culmination of a
year-long set of talks dealing with
international issues. Recent talks
include "Ethical Challenges of
Refugee Protection," given by
Sadako Ogata.
Gruen said the conference is a

chance to exercise "our policy of
putting theoretical questions in
context. Exploring issues of global
ism versus nationalism with respect
to political situations in, for in
stance, the Balkans, China or
Africa, allows us to examine the
usefulness of our strategies and
ideas."
The situation in Kosovo has
given these issues an immediacy,
and the conference program re
flects the recent turn of events. The
conference speakers will partic
ipate in an informal discussion fo
cused on the ethical issues raised by
NATO military action in Yu
goslavia during a lunch-time talk
on Friday.
The conference is funded by the
President's Program Funds in
honor of the 50th anniversary of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, along with support from the
Tanner Foundation.
