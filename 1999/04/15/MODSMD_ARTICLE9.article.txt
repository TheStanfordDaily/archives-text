# Junior medical faculty receive grants

### Wendy Marinaccio Contributing writer 
Two young scientists at the Medical School,
neurologist Thomas Rando and molecular phar
macologist Karlene Cimprich, will both get big
boosts to their research thanks to a pair of major
grants.
Rando, an assistant professor in the Neurology
Department, received the Paul Beeson Physician
Faculty Scholars in Aging Research Award. The
American Federation for Aging Research gives
out the $450,000 grant.
Rando said he will use his award to look at the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which mus
cles get weaker with age. He called the award
"very generous" and said it "gives an opportunity
to do several years' worth of work."
The goal of the award is to help physician sci
entists become leaders in research on aging, ac
cording to Stephanie Lederman, executive direc
tor of the American Federation for Aging Re
search. Applicants for the award are all junior
level physicians.
"What we look for essentially is people that are
working early in their careers to address clinically

significant research," Lederman said.
Rando said the award provides his lab with "an
opportunity to do a lot of background work in
aging." The award also "encourages people to go
into aging research, which is a relatively new area
in my lab."
Rando did preliminary research on muscle dis
eases over the past couple of years, and this work
formed the basis for his Beeson research proposal.
Lederman said between 50 and 60 applicants
applied and 11 doctors were chosen to receive the
award.
According to Lederman, since the number of
people over the age of 65 is rapidly increasing,
"We need physicians advancing research on aging
and training other people to do the same so we all
can live independently and productively."
Cimprich is an assistant professor of molecular
pharmacology. The Burroughs Wellcome Fund's
New Investigator Award will fund her research in
toxicology with $210,(XX)over three years. She will
study DNA damage checkpoints, which are parts
of cells that monitor and communicate if the cells
are damaged. To learn how cells respond to dam
age, she will add and remove different compo
nents of frog egg extracts in test tubes.

Cimprich could not be reached for comment,
but Helen Blau, professor and chair of the Molec
ular Pharmacology Department, explained Ciry
prich's work on cell-cycle control. Blau said Ciqi
prich will research how cells divide and what the
control mechanisms for division are. She will syn
thesize chemical compounds and look at "their
ability to correct the cell division that's gone wrong
in cancer cells," Blau said.
Universities can nominate two candidates each
year for the New Investigator Award. Blau and
Edward Holmes, senior associate dean for ire
search at the School of Medicine, recommended
Cimprich. ' ►"
According to Blau, Cimprich was nominated
because, '"She's exceptional, and she is doing
unique work at the interface of chemistry and bi
ology," a combination which "will allow her toilo
things no one has done before."
Blau said the award is a great honor. "W<£re
very happy, and we think she's very deserving."
she said. *
The application included a research plan, bad
get and previously published works by the candi
date. Cimprich was one of five researchers in the
country to receive the award.
