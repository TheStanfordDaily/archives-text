vision of the ideal university during a speech to an
overflowing crowd in Kresge Auditorium last night.
Derrida, who spoke as part of the University's Pres
idential Lectures Series, was introduced by Compara
tive Literature Prof. Richard Rorty. Rorty spoke
warmly of Derrida's work, describing him as "continu
ing the tradition of Parmenides and Plato" and extend
ing the work of modern philosophers I legel, Nietzsche,
Heidegger and Wittgenstein.
Rorty praised the vein of humor that runs through
Derrida's writings, as well as his deft use of double-en
tendres, puns and other plays on words. Rorty suggest
ed Derrida will inspire a future generation of philoso
phers to write prose that is "less pretentious, less prig
gish and more poetic" than those of the past.
Derrida began his talk by presenting his vision ofthe ideal
university. I Derrida said such a university would provide the
ultimate place for critical and decon
structive resistance.
He defined resistance as that
which "reflects, inverts and oppos

basis for such words as "profession"
and "professor."
Derrida said the act of professing
creates a linguistic promise.
Similarly, individuals whose work is
seen as a profession, such as lawyers,
doctors or professors, give "a declara
tion of responsibility to society."
Derrida closed by meditating on
the nature of possibilities and im
possibilities.
"I will leave you to imagine if the
impossible begins to happen," he
said. "Take your time, but be quick
about it because you do not know
what awaits you."
