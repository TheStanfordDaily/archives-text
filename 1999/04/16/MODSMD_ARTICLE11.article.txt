## U.S. pilot's error reportedly kills 75 refugees in Kosovo NATO admits to bombing mistake 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — NATO said
yesterday that one of its jets apparently
bombed refugees by mistake while attacking
what looked like a military convoy. It offered
an American F-16 pilot's vivid account of firing
on a convoy after seeing several villages set
ablaze by Yugoslav forces.
The pilot's tape-recorded description,
played for reporters in a briefing at NATO
headquarters, appeared to be an attempt to
clarify the circumstances of what Yugoslav
authorities are calling an alliance attack on
refugees that, according to the Yugoslavs, left
75 dead.
But to some degree, it only clouded the pic
ture: the pilot and NATO briefers gave an elab
orate explanation of an airstrike well to the
west and north of the site where the Yugoslavs
showed broken bodies, bloodied survivors and
burned tractors, which seemed to indicate that
NATO and the Yugoslavs were referring to dif
ferent events.
The pilot, whose name was not revealed,
said he was flying at an altitude of 15.000 feet
north of Djakovica, a major town in southwest
ern Kosovo, where the Serbian-led Yugoslav
army and special police units were moving
through a series of villages, setting them on fire

and driving out the people.
The pilot said he saw "three uniformly
shaped dark green vehicles" that looked like
troop-carrying vehicles.
"They come to a stop at the next house
down the road. 1 am convinced now that that's
(army and police) forces working their way
down toward Djakovica...."
He said he made several passes over the
vehicles to make sure they were military. "I roll
in on two passes to get a close look." the voice
on the tape said.
NATO issued a formal statement expressing
regret "over any harm to innocent civilians"
and acknowledging that "it appears that one of
its aircraft mistakenly dropped a bomb on a
civilian vehicle in a convoy yesterday."
The statement added: "Serb police or mili
tary vehicles may have been in or around the
convoy. NATO has no way of knowing the
number of casualties caused by the incident."
Serb television showed gruesome film
footage of carnage near the southern Kosovo
towns of Zreze and Mija. which are south of
Djakovica. and said the attacks were carried
out by NATO.
Reporters taken to sites south of Djakovica
vesterdav saw badly burned bodies and crushed

tractors along the road.
At the hospital in Prizren, six mangled bod
ies were laid out on a tile floor — three women,
one child, two men. Yugoslav officials said the
dead were all victims of a NATO attack on a
road clogged with civilians.
Refugees arriving in Albania told tales of
horror.
Dibran Asmani, 80. was riding in a tractor
convoy south of Djakovica, nearing Albania
after three days on the road, when the world
exploded in front of him. That was the last he
saw of his family.
"Suddenly, there was a big blast, and I start
ed running," the old man said in Albania. "All
I could think was. my God, NATO is bombing
us. I ran through the field like a mouse."
Like other refugees traveling in the convoy
attacked Wednesday, he said he heard aircraft,
and three bombs fell nearby. Two tractors tow
ing wagons jammed with people were blown
apart.
In expressing regret. NA TO said Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic bears the ulti
mate blame for any civilian casualties.
Italian Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani. speak
ing for NATO, said mistakes are inevitable in a
campaign as large as Operation Allied Force.
