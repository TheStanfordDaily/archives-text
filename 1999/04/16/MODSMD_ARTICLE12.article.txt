South Asia appeared closer to a
full-blown arms race after Pakistan
tested its second nuclear-capable
missile in two days yesterday,
upping the ante on its rival India.
The latest test was of the Sha
heen I, a surface-to-surface missile
with a range of 450 miles, consider
ably shorter than the Ghauri 11. test
ed by Pakistan the day before.
The Ghauri II was tested in
apparent response to India's test
flight of its Agni II missile on Sun
day. Each missile, with a range of
around 1.2(H) miles, can strike any
where in the other country's territo
ry.
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said
its series of missile tests was over
"for now" —'but that did little to
allay fears that the round of tests
had put the two countries firmly on
a spiral of missile one-upmanship.
That is what the international
community has been trying to avert
ever since the two neighbors explod-

Ed nuclear devices last year. India
and Pakistan have fought three wars
in the past 51 years and it is feared
that in a new confrontation they
could turn to nuclear weapons.
After Wednesday's test, both
countries moved to allay those fears.
Pakistan's foreign ministry issued a
statement explaining that the tests
"will help in maintaining a strategic
balance in South Asia."
India's Foreign Minister Jaswant
Singh said only: "There is no arms
race in South Asia."
The United States, which helped
start negotiations to ease tensions
between India and Pakistan after
their nuclear tests, expressed regret
Wednesday over both countries'
missile (lights.
But Pakistani Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tariq Altaf said criti
cism of the tests should be tempered
with "an understanding of our
defense requirements and the
requirement of ours for a minimum
deterrence."
