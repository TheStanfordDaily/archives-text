## Editorial A 						broken system 
### 
Student groups should
not have to depend
solely on special fees.

Another ASSU election has
passed, and once again stu
dents have voted to give 30
campus groups special-fee funding.
For those groups, now is the time
to relax, sigh and not worry about
campaigning for operating costs for
another year.
For six others, a long struggle to
find enough money to subsist is just
beginning.
Something seems wrong here.
While annual approval of student
group funding keeps these organiza
tions accountable to their con
stituents, it seems unfair that such
groups cannot rely on a guaranteed
source of funding â€” especially those
groups that serve particularly impor
tant roles, such as the campus radio
and television stations.
Every year, established student
groups must, in effect, campaign for
survival.
Most special-fee group representa
tives whom the Daily editorial board
interviewed during its endorsement
process stated that without special
fees, their organizations would be
unable to continue operations during
the next academic year.
This places the members of the stu
dent electorate in a difficult "either
or" situation: either vote to fund a
group or risk leaving the group with
out adequate funding to carry out its
services for the campus.
It is further frustrating to hear sev
eral groups tell stories of University
administrators encouraging them to
seek special fees as primary funding
sources.
Iliis is the great pitfall of the cur

rent special-fee system.
I'he more students shell out in fees
to support the groups that serve
them, the easier it is for the Universi
ty to deny those groups funding.
Some groups requesting special
fees clearly further the goals of vari
ous academic departments and
should be eligible to receive more
funding from these departments.
For example, "Mind's Eye," a jour
nal of expression, provides a forum
for students to present their literary
and visual creativity.
The English and Art Departments
provide minimal funding to the jour
nal's producers. These two depart
ments have a stake in the vibrancy of
the University's publication commu
nity and should do more to support
it. Even though "Mind's Eye" wel
comes submissions from all students
regardless of major, so too do the
English and Art Departments open
most of their courses to the campus
at large.
Similarly, if the University believes
that competitive teams in mock trial,
debate or solar car building can
increase the prestige of our school
and build student pride in its organi
zations, then it should fund the
expenses of these teams. This is no
different than funding the football or
basketball teams.
The question remains, however,
where such funding from the Univer
sity or its various academic depart
ments would come from. We con
stantly hear about how the Universi
ty is financially strapped.
Rut just as Stanford takes pride in
funding first-class teaching and
research, so must it take pride in
funding first-class student groups.
As long as the special-fee system
exists in its current form, however, it
will be all too easy for the University
to look the other way.
