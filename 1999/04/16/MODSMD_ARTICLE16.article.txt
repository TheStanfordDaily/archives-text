# Jar on a Hill
## Alden Clarke Tofu, nudity and being a Synner 
### 
The moment
your breath halts
and your eyes ador
ingly ignore every ray of
light but those flying non
stop from the rich and var
ied surfaces of the revel
ing, Frisbee-playing, aes-

thetically gifted, magic bean-buying folks
on the Synergy lawn, you understand the
promise of cooperative living.
At Synergy house, you will eat sweet
peas in the garden. You will consume fresh
baked bread loaded with more chocolate
than Hour five nights a week. In the co-ed
bathrooms you will hear women urinate as
you brush your teeth. You will eat extraor
dinarily delicious coffeecake made without
milk or eggs. You will live in a spacious
room with a fireplace, overlooking a wood
ed glen and a well-manicured lawn. You
will live in what is, by far, the most beautiful
and opulent residential mansion on campus.
You will live on a hill with a view.
You will change rooms each quarter, for
the sake of novelty and egalitarianism. In
doing so you will lose many of your posses
sions, thereby freeing yourself from the
oppressive chains of consumerism and
bringing your heart nearer to the enlight
ened. non-attachment doctrines of the East.
Just kidding; you will become an expert
mover.
You will participate in the so-called
"rooming meeting," the brutal, 12-hour
ordeal whose outcome determines who

lives in which room. You will despise the
most insidious, ineffectual, community
killing and wasteful form of government
man has ever known, a system called Con
sensus, whereby no decision is made with
out unanimous agreement. You will see the
same folks who righteously sing the praises
of community love, frugal living and social
justice lie and whine to win the most luxuri
ous rooms. You will see friendships die.
You will participate in the most vigorous
and multi-disciplinary intellectual discourse
at Stanford. You will thrive off of the cre
ative energy of the most artistically prolific
residence on campus. You will enjoy the
company of the most people who have
lived, long term, in tree houses.
You will he careful not to get any butter
in the jam jar, because some Synners do not
eat dairy. You will be careful not to get any
honey in the peanut butter jar. because
some folks here do not eat honey. You will
be careful not to use the elevator when
other people are looking. You will be care
ful not to throw anything recyclable away.
You will be careful.
You will give and receive numerous mas
sages. You will enjoy numerous film screen
ings via the video projection system. You
will both use and hear people using the
house nookie room, which has unfortunate
ly thin walls. You will question the fairness
of spending many hundreds of dollars of
house funds each year on tampons. You will
be met with bone-chilling, vitriolic cries of
no joke — "BUT WE BLEED!!"

You will participate in the most interest
ing and genuinely fun parties on campus.
You will see naked people decorated with
fluorescent war paint dance beneath black
lights. You will come to view a few Synners
as sisters and brothers. You will clean sinks,
floors, showers and toilets. You will cook
curry, potatoes, lentils and black beans.
You will learn that Synergy stopped
spiking the Halloween party punch-with
LSD in 1978. You will learn that Synergy
almost stopped spiking the Halloween
party punch with alcohol in 1998. You will
learn that Synergy is the Puritan Theme
House.
You will enjoy the free store, which is
where Synners put the stuff they don't want,
stuff that other folks might like. You will
see some people dress themselves exclu
sively from the free store. You will learn
that if you save your graduate student
stipend, you can reportedly live for 53 years
without working if you live more frugally
than you ever dreamed was possible. But ii
is possible. You will understand Thoreau's
economic theory and that spending three
hours making granola is infinitely more
rewarding than working three hours at a
computer job, driving to the store and buy
ing granola.
You will learn that no matter what, you
simply cannot simulate lobster with flour,
oats and tofu.
