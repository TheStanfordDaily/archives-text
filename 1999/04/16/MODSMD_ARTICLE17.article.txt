ASSU clarifies ad intent
In response to Jacob Eisenstein's letter
in yesterday's Daily, we would like to clar
ity the purpose of the full-page advertise
ment we ran in Tuesday and Wednesday's
issues of The Daily.
The advertisement was not in support
of the constitutional amendment on the
ASSIJ election ballot, as claimed by
Eisenstein. It was to encourage individual
students to decide for themselves whether
or not they support it.
While many of the authors of the
amendment did indeed sign the advertise

ment, it was also signed by those who do
not support the amendment, as well as
neutral parties.
We would like to thank all of those who
participated in the ASSIJ Election this
year, and if you have any comments on
how you think it could be improved for
next year, please do not hesitate to contact
us.

NAACP fee info correction
I would like to inform you ol an error
that occurred in your endorsement of the
NAACP Chapter of Stanford University
for special fees. You claimed that the
NAACI* would fund "over 75 percent" of
its budget through special fees, which is off
by at least 10 percent. The statement also
allows conjectures by those who read it
that the NAACP is funding almost its
entire budget through special fees, which
is completely incorrect. A reputable news
paper such as The Daily should at least
print the correct factual information.

Also, it would probably benefit both
the student body as well as any special-fee
groups if The Daily put out its endorse
ments at least a few days before the elec
tions (rather than a day before the actual
vote), so that any factually incorrect infor
mation could be corrected before students
vote. I sincerely hope these issues are
addressed and every attempt is made to
ensure all Daily reports are factually accu
rate.
