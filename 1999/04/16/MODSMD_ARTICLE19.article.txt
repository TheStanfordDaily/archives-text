# Bringing it all back home
## Mark Silver Epiphanies aren't written on the kiosk walls 
### 
FOR I HE PAST week I've walked
around campus, glaring at the ocean
of obnoxious fliers pasted up on
every wall, fountain and kiosk within a
five-mile radius. I've wondered why, for
most of the year, these walls, fountains
and kiosks remain mostly empty except
tor the offers for SAT tutor jobs and cheap
flights to Cancun.
What is it about these ridiculous elec
tions that gets so many people in a tizzy?
Are students really excited by all those
wonderful slogans? "Vote for Steve, you'll
all get laid." "Vote for me, my name is
vaguely similar to the name of an attrac
tive celebrity." Are these idiotic words
supposed to get my blood going about par
ticipating in the glorious democratic pro
cess?
But people do seem to care during this
one-week period, because I hear the cam
pus buzzing about the elections. Then peo
ple vote and forget about being political
until next year at this time, when the pret
ty-colored flyers are thrown in our faces
once again.
; Why do we forget? Because the elec

tions are for meaningless positions in
meaningless political bodies. 1 just went to
an ASSU Senate meeting. What's my
take? Over-inflated ego trips pretending
to "represent their constituents" by seek
ing to avoid any hint of controversy and
basically agreeing with most administra
tion policies and actions, then patting
themselves on the back for a job well
done. Yes, we did get the Marguerite on
the weekend, but from what I heard that
night, I'm beginning to suspect that
improvement had more to do with the
administration wanting to avoid building
more parking lots than any input from stu
dent "representatives."
Some people might say, "This guy is so
ignorant. The ASSU government has an
important role to play as the link between
the administration and the student body.
What a dumbass." Maybe they're right,
but why don't I know anything about that
role? I know what the federal government
does: Congress makes the laws, the Presi
dent executes the laws and the courts
interpret the laws. Why can't I retrieve the
same ready knowledge about my student

government? Maybe the phrase would go
something like this: The administration
makes the decisions, and the ASSU obeys
those decisions.
I did vote, though. I voted for people I
know and like, because it'll make them
feel good to have something important
looking on their resumes. Oh, and I voted
for Nikki Love, because she is the only
member of the Senate 1 know of who
seems genuinely and thoughtfully con
cerned about what we could do to improve
Stanford and who has the motivation and
work ethic to actually do something. I just
hope her talents don't go to waste in the
A-S-S-U.
So what about those other 51 weeks of
the year? Why are there so few fliers up
during those weeks? I've spent my time at
Stanford believing that, like at any college
campus, most students here are apathetic
and just want their degree and cozy job.
With some few notable exceptions, I
haven't seen any of the full-fledged, balls
out activism that ignited our campuses
decades ago.
Right, right, you might be saying, we've

heard this crap from you before. Peace,
love, blah, blah, blah. We're not having
any of it.
But listen, there's more to it now. This
week 1 met a girl who told me she wants to
start a revolution, to make the world a bet
ter place. Not "I want to travel before I
start law school" or "I want my 401k
plan," but "I want to start a revolution."
How many people have you met here who
have ever said something like that and
have meant it all the way?
That's what we need, more people who
want to shake things up, who want to
change the way the world works. Too
many of us go through our time here doing
our work, noses to the grindstone, without
questioning the underlying assumptions
behind the system we live in, without chal
lenging the orthodoxy of money and status
ingrained in us from our parents. Too
many of us spend our lives in this "ours is
not to question why, ours is but to do and
die" mindset, without trying to find some
deeper meaning, some greater purpose for
the lives we live. Think about it; 50 years
from now we'll all look back on the paths

we've taken, and we'll wonder if we've
done what's best for us. The question is
whether you want to look baek satisfied
that you tried everything there was to try,
did everything there was to do.
We are so damned privileged here; we
have the option of doing whatever we
want to do with our lives. Yes, follow your
dream, live for your passion.
Care about what you do.
Don't waste your lives doing what's
expected, following what seems to be the
logical next step. Jump oil' that cliff, step
out into the unknown. Get involved in
something that makes you care.
Otherwise, you'll just end your life in
an anticlimax, wondering what could have
been. As Bob Dylan would say, "He not
busy being born is busy dying."
The next time you complain about how
busy you are, think about what you're
busy doing.

Mark Silver is a sophomore who is current
ly undeclared. He promises to do better next
week.
