## 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
After two years of serving as executive director of
Hillel at Stanford, Rabbi Yoel Kahn has announced
that he will not be returning next year.
"I'm proud of what I've done here, but it's time to
move on." he said.
Though he describes his plans for next year as "up
in the air," he remarked. "I'm looking forward to
being home for dinner more." Kahn lives in San Fran
cisco with his 7-year-old son.
Hillel is actively searching for someone to lill the
spot that Kahn will leave vacant. A seven member
search committee is advertising for applicants.
The committee is currently taking applications and
interviewing candidates. Although the official dead
line was April 14. the committee extended it indefi
nitely, according to Bob Rosenzweig, president of
I lillel's Board of Directors.
"We have a couple of strong candidates, but it's al
ways more important to find the right person than to
fill the job," Rosen/weig said. "Coven that, we'd like
to fill the job as quickly as possible."
Rosen/weig said he hopes the search committee
will choose Kahn's successor by the
summer, although no definite
deadline has been set.
Described by Rosenzweig as a
"pretty visible job," the committee
is seeking to till the position with a
candidate who possesses a variety
of traits.
"With the knowledge that no
single person has all these traits,
we're seeking someone who can
manage a small but complex group
of people," he explained. "The di
rector needs to fundraise, be a
spokesperson, interact intellectual
ly and be a counselor."
Although the search for a new
director is national in scope, it is fo
cused on the West ('oast because of
the high costs associated with relo
cating to the Bay Area.
Rosenzweig attributed Kahn's
departure largely to personal cir
cumstances, some of which were
associated with the difficult com
mute from San Francisco to Stan
lord.
"His family life was suffering,"
Rosenzweig said.
Despite the stress Rosenzweig
described, Kahn described his feel
ings toward his work at Hillel as
"positive." While he inherited tra

ditions that existed before his ar
rival to campus two years ago, he
has also created new programs dur
ing his tenure.
According to Kahn, his regular
"dinners in the dorm" gave him
and other stall the opportunity to
meet undergraduates over dinner
in an informal setting. Hillel also
reached out to graduate students
through new events, such as Bar
Night.
"In the tradition of Jewish study
and learning." Kahn said he creat
ed informal educational opportuni
ties for students.
"He's been a strong intellectual
leader. He lit very well into this
community where intellectual
strength is important." Rosen
zweig said of Kahn.
Although Kahn will not be pre
sent. lie and his staff are already
planning next year's programs. He
cause 11 illd's staff is remaining to
gether, Kahn expects a smooth
transition in leadership.
Sophomore Josh Fried, who has
been involved with Hillel for two
years, described Kahn's impact on
the organization.
"The people before him left it in
shambles. Now. the organization
has really picked up some steam,"
Fried said. "I really think he's pro
vided some good leadership. I'm
sad to see him go."
