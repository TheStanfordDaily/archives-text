## Baseball begins important homestand against USC 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
This weekend's Pacific-10 Confer
ence series between second-ranked
Stanford (26-9, 11-1 Pac-10) and No.
24 USC (24-17, 10-2) has all the
drama of a spaghetti western.
Call it a Sunset Showdown at
Sunken Diamond.
The league-leading Cardinal, be
hind its confident ace Jason Young
(6-2, 2.65 ERA), will square off
against the second-place Trojans and
their much-traveled star pitcher, ju
nior Barry Zito (7-2,3.61 ERA) with
a slim, one-game lead at stake.
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess downplays the importance of
the series, as always.
"In reality it's no more important
than us taking the three games
against Arizona State, the three
games at Arizona or two out of three
at Seattle," he said. "It is a big week
end because we are playing for first
place, but we've got a lot of other

games to go."

However, these games are differ
ent. Whichever team manages to win
two of three will come away with
more than another series victory; it
will claim the Pac-10 lead. And. if
Stanford manages to do so, it will
have at least a commanding three
game cushion over USC with only
nine games left in conference play.
The action gets started tonight in
what could be a rollicking duel be
tween two of the best gunslingers in
the nation.
Zito, whose travels have led manv

to call him a hired gun, has pitched ex
ceptionally well in his premier Pac-10
season. Hie left-hander only enrolled
at USC, his third school in three
years, a month before the season
began. But Zito has adjusted quickly
to his new surroundings, striking out
16 baiters in each of his first two Pac
-10 starts and winning his last six
games
Young has been even better than
Zito this year, surprising everyone
but himself. The lanky right-hander
has thrown five complete games and
struck out W while holding opposing
batters to a measly .202 average.
In their matchup earlier this year
in Los Angeles. Young outdueled
Zito. striking out 10 en route to a
complete-game, four-hit victory.
I lowever, Zito will surely be out for
revenge and looking to start the series

Junior first baseman John Gall prepares to make a catch. Stanford begins a very important homestand
against USC today.
ton All-American Jeff Heaverlo,
tonight's game will also give Young
something to prove.
Young pitched a complete game
and outperformed Heaverlo for
much of the contest but did not come
away with the win.
"Being the Friday starter, you're
probably going to get a few less wins
because you're going to be matched
up against pretty good pitchers,"
Marquess said. "But, [Young's]
pitched great the last two weeks. 1
hope I can get the same type of per
formance out of hint this week."
The Cardinal could be confident
going into this three-game set. know
ing it took two of three from the Tro
jans in Los Angeles in a non-confer
ence series in late February.
However, at the time, USC was 5-

12. Since then the Trojans, who were
ranked No. 1 in the nation in the pre
season, have turned it around, post
ing a 19-5 record in their last 24 games
despite losing Ail-American catcher
Eric Munson to a broken hand.
"Even though they were under
.500 when we played them, we said,
'they're a good team — they're going
to be back.'" Marquess said.
" They've proven that. They're scor
ing runs and finding different ways to
win when they're not putting runs on
the board. That's what good teams
do."
With the loss of Munson. Colle
giate Baseball's Preseason Player of
the Year, the Trojans have had to
search for production from different
places.
However, senior right fielder
Greg Hanoian. senior utility man
Jason Lane and sophomore short
stop Seth Davidson have stepped up
to lead the Pac-10's second-best of

fense.
Lane, who also pitches, missed the
first eight games of the year with a
broken left thumb but has been ex
ceptional since. He is batting .352
with nine home runs and 37 RBIs.
The Stanford offense has been
similarly multi-faceted. Each game
and each series seems to bring a new
hero to the plate.
Sophomore center fielder Billy
Jacobson had received little playing
time before junior Edmund Muth
went out with meningitis over spring
break. Since then. Jacobson has not
relinquished his place in the lineup,
batting .356 in the leadoff spot.
The recent team-wide production
is promising for both squads as they
head into the crucial series.
Befitting an old-fashioned gun
fight to prove who is the best in the
West, Marquess and USC head
coach Mike Gillespie will surely hold
nothing back.
