## Baseball begins important homestand against USC 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
This weekend's Pacific-10 Confer
ence series between second-ranked
Stanford (26-9, 11-1 Pac-10) and No.
24 USC (24-17, 10-2) has all the
drama of a spaghetti western.
Call it a Sunset Showdown at
Sunken Diamond.
The league-leading Cardinal, be
hind its confident ace Jason Young
(6-2, 2.65 ERA), will square off
against the second-place Trojans and
their much-traveled star pitcher, ju
nior Barry Zito (7-2,3.61 ERA) with
a slim, one-game lead at stake.
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess downplays the importance of
the series, as always.
"In reality it's no more important
than us taking the three games
against Arizona State, the three
games at Arizona or two out of three
at Seattle," he said. "It is a big week
end because we are playing for first
place, but we've got a lot of other

games to go."

However, these games are differ
ent. Whichever team manages to win
two of three will come away with
more than another series victory; it
will claim the Pac-10 lead. And. if
Stanford manages to do so, it will
have at least a commanding three
game cushion over USC with only
nine games left in conference play.
The action gets started tonight in
what could be a rollicking duel be
tween two of the best gunslingers in
the nation.
Zito, whose travels have led manv

to call him a hired gun, has pitched ex
ceptionally well in his premier Pac-10
season. Hie left-hander only enrolled
at USC, his third school in three
years, a month before the season
began. But Zito has adjusted quickly
to his new surroundings, striking out
16 baiters in each of his first two Pac
-10 starts and winning his last six
games
Young has been even better than
Zito this year, surprising everyone
but himself. The lanky right-hander
has thrown five complete games and
struck out W while holding opposing
batters to a measly .202 average.
In their matchup earlier this year
in Los Angeles. Young outdueled
Zito. striking out 10 en route to a
complete-game, four-hit victory.
I lowever, Zito will surely be out for
revenge and looking to start the series
out right for the Trojans tonight
