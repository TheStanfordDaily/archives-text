# Volleyball readies for final matches
## Cardinal faces UCLA, UCI 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
For the first lime in a while, there's not much
pressure on the Stanford men's volleyball team.
Since conference competition kicked off
Jan. 23. the 15th-ranked Cardinal (10-10, 7-10
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) has been
practicing and competing with one central goal
in mind: the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Tournament, the culmination of the season
for the top teams in the MPSF.

the season against the I J( -Irvine Anteaters(l9-

"The motivation is there," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves. "But it's just a dif
ferent type of motivation then what we wanted.

lot of heart and a lot of pride, and there would
be no better way to end the season than with
two wins this weekend."
Because ( alifornia's volleyball team is not a
member of the NCAA, it would seem that Stan
lord lacks an opponent tospuran intense peren
nial rivalry.
Enter UCLA.
Each year, the Bruins, the winners of 17
NCAA Championships, are touted as one of
the top teams in the nation. Stanford, however,
has managed to defeat them even during some
of I JCI A's most impressive seasons. The Car
dinal has earned wins over UCLA on the last
three meetings between the teams, including
last year when the Bruins won the national
championship.
"This is by far one of the best rivalries in col
lege volleyball." Nieves said. "We have beaten
them some of the last couple of times that we
played, and they will most likely want to end
that streak against us this year."
The Bruins are off to yet another impressive
season. They are currently third in the Moun
tain Division and the nation and have clinched
a berth to the MPSF Tournament. UCLA has
enjoyed such a successful season due to the key
contributions of two players: junior Adam
Naeve and senior Danny Farmer. Naeve, a first
team All-American last season, currently has
the 11th highest hitting percentage (.443)

among all players in the NCAA.
Farmer, who is also the top receiver
on UCLA's football team, is ranked
just behind Naeve with a .436 hitting
percentage. The Cardinal will need to
contain the attacking ability of this
duo to continue its streak against the
Bruins.
"We are going to stick with what
we have been doing all year, but
make some adjustments for each
team," Nieves said. "UCLA likes to

feed to their quick-hitters."
Although the Bruins have already
clinched their playoff berth, the
Anteaters could attain their first
tournament berth with a win against
the Cardinal. Irvine has put itself
within striking distance of a tourna
ment berth with upset wins over then
top-ranked Long Beach State and
No. 7 Hawaii last week. Senior out
side hitter Donnie Rafter, who has
the ninth highest kill average in the
NCA A, has been key in this success.
Without the pressure of a playoff
berth on the line, Stanford will try to
end the collegiate careers of the Car

dinal's three seniors, Patrick Klein,
Jeremy Bart and Chris Griffith, with
wins.
"I'm excited for this weekend be
cause it's the last chance for me to
play with Pat, Jeremy and Chris,"
said outside hitter Josh Palacios.
Palacios, outside hitters Marcus
Skacel and Curtis Graham, middle
blockers Brett Youngberg and Dan
Zhang and setters Brad Griffith and
Josh Lukens have all beenkey con
tributors for the team this year. Wins
this weekend would end the year on a
positive note for these players who
will all play key roles next season.
