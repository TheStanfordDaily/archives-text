## Cardinal faces UCLA, UCI 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
For the first lime in a while, there's not much
pressure on the Stanford men's volleyball team.
Since conference competition kicked off
Jan. 23. the 15th-ranked Cardinal (10-10, 7-10
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) has been
practicing and competing with one central goal
in mind: the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Tournament, the culmination of the season
for the top teams in the MPSF.

(13-9, 13-5), 7 p.m.
■ SATURDAY: Stanford at I JC-lrvine (19-6,
10-7).
I his weekend, however. Stanford must find
new motivation for its last two games of the sea
son. I he Cardinal's heartbreaking five-game
loss to the Pacific Tigers Tuesday thwarted any
chance of Stanford continuing into postseason
competition for the seventh straight season.
But a game against third-ranked IJC'LA (13-
9, 13-5) today and Stanford's final matchup of
the season against the I J( -Irvine Anteaters(l9-
(\ 10-7) tomorrow should provide ample moti
vation for an exciting end to the 1999 season.
"The motivation is there," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves. "But it's just a dif
ferent type of motivation then what we wanted.

That endet] lor us on Tuesday. This team has a
lot of heart and a lot of pride, and there would
be no better way to end the season than with
two wins this weekend."
Because ( alifornia's volleyball team is not a
member of the NCAA, it would seem that Stan
lord lacks an opponent tospuran intense peren
nial rivalry.
Enter UCLA.
Each year, the Bruins, the winners of 17
NCAA Championships, are touted as one of
the top teams in the nation. Stanford, however,
has managed to defeat them even during some
of I JCI A's most impressive seasons. The Car
dinal has earned wins over UCLA on the last
three meetings between the teams, including
last year when the Bruins won the national
championship.
"This is by far one of the best rivalries in col
lege volleyball." Nieves said. "We have beaten
them some of the last couple of times that we
played, and they will most likely want to end
that streak against us this year."
The Bruins are off to yet another impressive
season. They are currently third in the Moun
tain Division and the nation and have clinched
a berth to the MPSF Tournament. UCLA has
enjoyed such a successful season due to the key
contributions of two players: junior Adam
Naeve and senior Danny Farmer. Naeve, a first
team All-American last season, currently has
the 11th highest hitting percentage (.443)
