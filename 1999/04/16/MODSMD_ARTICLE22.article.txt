### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
The fifth-ranked Stanford

ic 10 Conference) heads down to Los
Angeles today to face No. 14 USC

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Today: No 5 Stanford (20-2) at No.
14 USC (17-7,5-0).
■ Saturday: Stanford at No. 4 UCLA
(17-5,5-1).
"Last year, though, we lost to
UCLA," said junior captain and AII-
American Teryn Ashley. "But it's
time to key into our goal. We're play
ing our best tennis of the season right
now and these are our last matches.
It's time to go out with a bang."
While almost every player on the
team has been playing solid tennis in
recent weeks, the women are coming
off a difficult weekend during which
they topped Arizona and edged No.
11 Arizona State, 5-4.
"The match against Arizona State
was patchy here and there," Ashley
said. "But we did come through in the
end."
One player who struggled against
the Sun Devils was second-ranked

freshman Marissa Irvin, who, after
recording an impressive 23-match
win streak, lias lost two of her last
four.
Irvin fell to Arizona State's Alli
son Bradshaw on Saturday and was
toppled in three dramatic sets hv
USC's Ditta Huber, ranked 2()tli in
the nation, the previous weekend.
Irvin travels to Los Angeles with
vindication on her mind.
"Irvin hasn't internalized the
loss," Ashley said. "She has a healthy
ego and she's not going to get down
on herself. Everyone knows she's
better than that."
Ashley will also seek some re
venge if she faces UCLA's Amanda
Basica at the No. 2 singles position.
Basica captured their last en
counter. 6-3,6-3.
"I'm still 2-1 against her," Ashley
said. "But I do want to go out there
and win. If I play my game, I think I
should."
The Cardinal will be led by Ashley
and Irvin, but head coach Frank
Brennan counts on freshmen Gabby
Lastra, Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko
Tokuda to do some damage against
Stanford's Southern California ri
vals.
All three freshmen have demon
strated maturity and tremendous tal
ent in recent weeks. Lastra, Kalvaria
and Tokuda have pulled out some
upsets over higher-ranked competi-
