I'od ay the No. Omen's tennis team
begins its toughest and most impor
tant weekend of the year thus far
when il takesoll the No. 1311S( 'Tro
jans at 1:30 p.m. at the Tauhe Family
Tennis Stadium. The Cardinal will
not have much recovery time as it will
face the No. I UCLA Bruins tomor
row at noon.

■ Today: No.Stanford (17-2) (17-2.
6-1) vs. No. 13 USC (17-3, 4-3). 1:30
p.m.. Taube Tennis Center.
■ Saturday: Stanford vs. No. 1 UCLA
(20-1, 6-1), 12 p.m., Tauhe Tennis
Center.
" I his is as good as college tennis
gets," said Stanford head coach Dick
Gould. "We're ready to go and
healthy. If our guys can't get pumped
up for this one, I don't know when
they ever will. It should be a fun
crowd who will be ready for some
quality tennis."
The Cardinal (17-2,6-1 Pacific 10
Conference) defeated the Trojans
(17-3.4-3) early this year by a score of
6-1. but the match was much closer
than the score indicates. There were
several three-set matches and it easi
ly could have been a 4-3 match.
The Bruins (20-1, 6-1) suffered
their only loss earlier in the year at
Arizona State. Ever since then they
have been nearly unbeatable and

have asserted themselves as the team
to beat. The Cardinal was defeated
hv the Bruins 5-2, but this match was
closer than the score shows.

"The UCLA match was a good
one and could have swung either

Senior Ryan Wolters returns a backhand. Saturday, Wolters will
square off gainst UCLA's Jean-Noel Grinda, ranked ninth national-
way," -..tid Stanford assistant coach
John Whitlinger. "In these type of
high-intensity matches you pretty
much throw out records and rankings
and just see who comes more ready to
play l : \er since the early 11/7()sl l /7()s this
lias traditionally been a great week
end of college tennis. It is a g(x>d test
to see v here we stand right now."
I he Cardinal stands rather strong
right now and is almost assured to
host a regional for the N(7\As. Its
only two losses were to Illinois at the
Indoors by a score of 4-3 and the
Bruin loss.
Perhaps the most exciting and def
initely one of the more important
matchups of this weekend will be
when senior Ryan Wolters takes on
UCLA's Jean-Noel Grinda. Wolters
is currently the No. 4 singles player in
the nation and Grinda is ranked No
}). Grinda has already handed

Wolters two close losses this year,
one at an individual tournament in
Thousand Oaks and the other when
the two squared off in L.A.
"Grinda is a tough player."
Wolters said. "He is a big leftv with a
strong serve and a solid net game. I
know how he plays now and I know I
just need to do a few things different
ly. I need to concentrate on holding
serve and then look for a few break
point opportunities to carry me
through."
Clearly another key to the week
end will be the performance of the
Cardinal's doubles teams, l or most
of the year the Cardinal has been
forced to come back and win lour of
the six singles malchesafter losing the
doubles point.
"Last time we were a little down
against U( LA after we lost the dou
bles point." said sophomore Alex
Kim. "We needtotry toget that point
to alleviate pressure in the singles, but
even if we lose the point again we
need to yet over it."
