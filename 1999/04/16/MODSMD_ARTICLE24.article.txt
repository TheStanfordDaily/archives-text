MEN S TRACK
â–  This weekend: Stanford competes
in Mt. San Antonio College Relays
and Azusa Pacific Invitational.
Competing in one of the champi
onship events will he senior Adam
Connolly throwing the hammer. I lis
toss of 228 feet, one inch at last
week's Hayward Relays propelled
him to the No. 3 spot in the nation
and marked a personal best.
Junior Toby Stevenson will con
tinue his season-long pole vaulting
romp in the championship event,
and freshman Michael I'onikvar will
compete with the nation's best in the
high jump.
Leading the way for Stanford in
the distances will be a race-ready
group comprised of Brad and broth
er Brent Hauser and seniors Jason
Balkman and Nathan Nutter. Hav
ing already qualified for the NCAA
meet in the I (),(X H) meters at the Stan
ford Invitational, the group will try to
nail down qualifying marks in the
S,(XX) meters as well.
In the past, the Mt. SAC' meet has
been the site of tremendously fast
distance races and prolific amounts
of NCAA qualifying marks. But the
distance races do have pitfalls.
"The most difficult part about Mt.
SAC is putting yourself in a position
where you don't get in over your
head," said head coach Vin Lanan
na. "Our guys have been training
very hard-harder than they've ever
trained, and at a higher level.
"I don't know how to project
what they'll run this weekend. This
will be a big surprise forme," I.anan
na said. "We need to at least pick up
the NCAA standard."
Stanford will send a large group ot
middle distance runners, including
Jake Maas, Jon Weldon and Mark
Hassell to compete in the meet in
hopes of obtaining Pacific 1 ((Confer
ence and NCAA qualifying marks.
Noticeably absent from this
group will be junior Michael Stem
ber and sophomores Jonathon Riley
and Gabe Jennings, who Lananna
said will most likely redshirt this sea
son. Freshman middle-distance spe
cialist Jonathan Stevens will definite
ly exercise his redshirt option this
spring, according to Lananna.
Mount SAC will also give the Car
dinal a bit of a preview on the NCAA
meet, which will be held on June 2-5
in Boise. Idaho. Defendingchampion
and top-ranked Arkansas has en
tered a number of athletes in the field,
and I JSC \ who is tied with Stanford in
the No. 2 spot will make its case for a
top ranking. No. 4 Southern
Methodist will also attend.

All told. 37 colleges and eight for
eign nations will be represented.
Sprint superstars Ato Boldon and
Marion Jones are both scheduled to
compete.
Held in conjunction with Mt.
SAC's relays is the Azusa Pacific
Multi-Event meet. Stanford has sent
senior Josh Gleason. a perennial Pac
-10 scorer in the decathlon, to repre
sent the Cardinal.
Gleason has been hampered by a
groin strain suffered in late March,
but Lananna expects that the Azusa

meet will help him get back on track.
"Josh is in a gwxl enough position
to get a solid first decathlon of the
season under his belt." Lananna said.
"If he gets on a roll in the first couple
of events, he's going to do well."
Chase Wimberly. another senior
multi-event athlete, may also com
pete. Having steadily learned each of
the decathlon events over the dura
tion of his five-year Stanford career,
Wimberly has the potential to be a
factor in the Pac-1() meet as well, ac
cording to Lananna.
