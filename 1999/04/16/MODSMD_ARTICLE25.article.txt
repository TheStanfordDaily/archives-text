# There's something about Marcy

How many athletes wake up to run at 8 a.m.
every morning, by choice, during the off-season?
How many Softball players seek out extra con
ditioning with the baseball team during their off
season?
This fall, Stanford senior Marcy Crouch took it
upon herself to do this on top of the standard soft
ball fall training.
This amazing work ethic has led Crouch to be a
key player, not only in the circle but off the field as
well. What Crouch contributes to the Cardinal,
however, goes beyond her impressive pitching
and offensive statistics.
"Marcy is a great leader and works very hard."
said senior pitcher Becky Blevins. "When the peo
ple you look up to work hard, it drives you that
much more."
Her coach agrees.
"Marcy s work ethic and desire to win are sec
ond to none," said Stanford head coach John
Rittman. "She is definately a competitor. Every
time she steps into the circle or the box, Marcy is
all about winning."
The native of Huntington Beach, Cal. has been
one of the keys to the growth of the Stanford soft
ball program over the last three years.
When she signed with the Cardinal, Stanford
softball was in its first year as a varsity sport and
was not yet fully funded. However, Crouch was at
tracted by the academics of Stanford and the ap
peal of a building program, as well as the competi
tion of the Pac-10 and location close to home.
Through the summer before her senior year,
however. Crouch had her mind set on attending
Notre Dame.
But, "After my recruiting trip to Notre Dame,
1 didn't love it. I loved Stanford and it had every
thing to offer. I am very happy with the decision,"

she said.
Crouch has already left her mark in the Stan
ford books. Going into the 1999 season, she held
the highest lifetime batting average for a Cardinal
(.294) and, sharing the pitching duties all four
years with fellow senior Becky Blevins, Crouch
had compiled a lifetime 2.05 ERA.
This year she is pitching the best of her career,
as evidenced by the three perfect games she has al
ready recorded this season. Her ERA entering the
weekend is 0.72, and she has struck out 81 batters,
while only walking 29.
"Marcy is having an outstanding year in the cir
cle," Rittman said. "She has really blossomed at
this level and kept opposing hitters off balance all
year."
Her catcher, junior Kellie Wiginton, cites
Crouch's knowledge of the game and smart play
as key to her success.
"Marcy does a lot of thinking about what she
wants to throw, and it has been very effective,"
Wiginton said.
"My favorite thing about pitching is the game
within the game — the mental game of pitching,"
Crouch said. "Even if I am throwing poorly. I will
keep battling."
Crouch has always challenged herself on the
playing field. Growing up, her dad. Cary, had her
play on teams with older girls.
"When I was in second grade. 1 played with
fifth, sixth and seventh graders. 1 had no choice but
to get better and by fourth grade I made the All
Star team," Crouch said. "It helped me to always
play against kids who were better than me. I loved
it because it gave me something to work for. I saw
where I wanted to be."
Crouch not only leads by example, hut her
teammates take note that she often adopts the role
of a coach.
"She is like another coach for us on the field,"
said junior Lauren Gellman. "She knows every as

pect of the game so well, from fielding to hitting to
pitching, that she can help everyone improve."
Crouch credits her knowledge of the game to
her father who was her coach growing up on her
club team, the Southern California Outlaws.
"I would ride to games with my dad every
weekend, and we always discussed softball in the
car," Crouch said. "I learned the game and
learned to be like his assistant coach."
The Crouch tandem led the Outlaws to two na
tional championships, at the 12-and-underand 14-
and-under level, while the club finished second at
16 and under and fifth at 18 and under. Not only
was Crouch the team's ace, and shortstop when
not pitching, but she also hit third in the batting
order and was the virtual assistant coach.
"Before my dad would look to his assistant
coaches, he would look to me." Crouch said.
This success at the club level was matched by
incredible achievement at the high school level.
As the leader of the Marina High School softball
team. Crouch guided her squad to Division I CIF
championships her junior and senior year and was
named CIF player of the year both times.
In her spare time, between club and high
school softball, Crouch also excelled in volleyball
and soccer. Her Marina soccer teams, on which
she played sweeper and captained her junior and
senior year, won CIF during her sophomore, ju
nior and senior seasons. Crouch earned CIF de
fensive player of the year honors her final two
years.
These achievements in all three sports earned
Crouch the title of California Athlete of the Year
after her senior year in high school, and she was
named "the best three-sport athlete in Orange
County history" by the Los Angeles Times.
ITirough it all. Crouch has never lost sight of
team goals.
"She is truly the ultimate team player,"
Rittman said.
