### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
This weekend, the No. 10 Stanford soft
ball team (32-11,4-6 Pacific 10 Conference)
will head south to take on No. 3 Arizona (34-
8,6-4) and No. 7 Arizona State (31-13,2-8) in
two more heated conference matchups.
After dropping two home games to No.
13 Oregon State last Saturday, the Cardinal
rebounded to sweep No. 12 Oregon in two
close games on Sunday. Rather than
dwelling on the two losses, the team is feeling
positive about its rebound and new streak.
"We bounced back [against Oregon] and
it has given us new momentum," said junior
catcher Kellie Wiginton. "We are on our way
to peaking again."
Stanford will need to carry the momen
tum into the weekend in the desert as both

Arizona and ASIJ are having strong sea
sons.
Arizona is one of the perennial power
houses of college softball. having advanced
to the College' World Series 10years in a row.
Capturing the national title in 1991, 1993,
1994, 1996 and 1997, the Wildcats are
renowned for their powerful clubs and solid
pitching.
This season, however, the Arizona squad
boasts more speed than usual and is capital
izing on more of a short game than in the
years past. The Wildcats have stolen 90
bases, 29 more than second place No. 4
Washington.
"We will have to gear up and play good
defense and hopefully our pitchers will keep
them off-balance." Rittman said.
In.addition to the need to win and stay in
the Pac-10 race, the Cardinal has a second

motivation. In its fifth year as a varsity pro
gram, Stanford has never beaten the Wild
cats.

11.4-6 Pac-10 Conference) at No. 3 Arizona
(34-8, 6-4). 6 p.m. GAME 2— Stanford at
Arizona, 8 p.m.
■ Saturday: GAME I—Stanford at No. 7

2— Stanford at Arizona State, 8 p.m.
"Even though we seniors still have four
games with them, this is the last chance to go
and beat [Arizona] at their place," said se
nior pitcher Becky Blevins.
Trying to stop the Cardinal will be a Wild
cat team that is solid from the top of the line

up to the bottom. Sophomore Lauren Bauer
leads the team, batting .422. Sophomore
pitcher Becky Lemke (19-4) and freshman
Jennie Finch (15-4) have combined for a 1.64
ER.
But before Stanford faces the Wildcats, it
must take on No. 7 ASIJ today. Historically
in the shadow of its cross-state rival, ASU is
having a strong season.
"ASU probably has the best team they
have had in five or six years and they are
going to be very tough," Rittman said.
Four freshman top the offensive charts
for the Sun Devils, and freshman Nicole
Thompson leads the way batting .360. Two
of these freshman, Kristen Voak (18-6) and
Erica Beach (12-7), also anchor the squad
from the mound. Last weekend, Voak
hurled a one-hitter in ASU's 1-0 victory
against Washington. She also leads the con

ferencewith 199 strikeouts.
While ASIJ has been led by its rookies,
Stanford's season has seen a blend of young
talent and experience. All seven of the Car
dinal's seniors play a critical role, and four
freshman have made important contribu
tions as well.
Freshman Jessica Mendoza is batting a
team-leading .453 with eight home runs and
45 RBIs. Wiginton is second, batting .385.
while anchoring the Cardinal pitching squad
behind the plate. The squad alternates
Blevins (14-6) and senior Marcy Crouch (18-
5), who have combined for a 1.15 ERA.
Entering this weekend, the Cardinal has a
different mindset and confidence than ever
before.
"In years past, we'd go in thinking that
we'd be lucky to get one game. This weekend
we want to win four games," Wii>inton said.
