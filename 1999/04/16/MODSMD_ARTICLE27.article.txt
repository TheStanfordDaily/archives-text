WOMEN'S WATERPOLO
â–  Today: No 4 Stanford (18-5) vs. No. 8 UC-Davis (21-7),
4 p.m., be Guerre Pool.
This is the first year in a long history of Stanford-Davis
matches that the Cardinal has not played the Aggies until
this late in the season. Stanford expected to play the Ag
gies at the UC-Santa Barbara Invitational last February,
but UC-San Diego managed to beat the Aggies to play
Stanford in that round of the tournament.
The Davis team won its own conference title in the
Western Water Polo Association Championship and has
16 victories in its last 17 games, with that one loss a close
match against No. 3 IJCLA.
"Davis has been doing very well and has been ex
tremely consistent." said Stanford head coach John Tan
ner. "Today's game could be close and the Cardinal will
need to be very effective on defense and make good use of
scoring opportunities."
The match is the final home game for three seniors, co
captain Heather Crary. Co-captain Lindsay Tam, and
Nicole Cilazer.,

"It is sad that this is my last home game," Cilazer said.
"But I knew that this game would come. Nothing lasts for
ever and I'm just happy that I had so many amazing times
leading up to this over the past four years. I really couldn't
have asked for anything more from a team."
"The game will be really fun because it signifies the
past four years of playing polo in this pool," Crary said.
"For the seniors, it's like we've come full circle. I'm happy
about what we've accomplished, and now I'm ready to
move on."
These three seniors are members of the first class of
varsity water polo at Stanford and so much of the team's
growth, accomplishment and personality are due to these
senior's talent, leadership and creativity. Their presence
will surely be missed next year not only in the pool but in
the friendships that have added to the team's strength and
success over the years.
"I'm so excited for the seniors." said sophomore Hilary
Gallogly. "I know they'll be fired up for this game. Crarv
is going to block every shot, Tam is going to counter every
one in the pool, and no hole-set will be able to turn
Nicole."
But no pressure, seniors. The rest of the team will be
there to lend you a hand.
Immediately after the Davis game, the Stanford men's
water polo team will plav an exhibition game against the
Northern California portion of the U.S. National water
polo team.
Former Stanford four-time All-American and 1996
Olympian Wolf Wigo and former Cardinal All-Amer
icans Chris Aguilera and Layne Beaubian join six
other National team members in taking on the return
ing Stanford varsity.
Admission to the men's game is free.
