accent or wearing a bowtie. "It's a lot of acting," he said.
As in a real courtroom, there is a certain level of sub

watch a speech and say that's great, 10 out of 10, and
someone else can watch the same speech and give it six
out of 10," Keltner said.
Freshman Marin McDonald said she enjoys mock
trial because "it really combines all the best qualities of
public speaking. You have prepared speeches, im

Next year, the team hopes to send two teams to Na

We have a lot of talent on the team," Kelton said.

have some premeds and a physics major," Guarienti
said.
"I really feel that this is the newest and most promis
ing club on Stanford campus," McDonald said.
