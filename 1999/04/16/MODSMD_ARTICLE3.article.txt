# Fac Sen reviews task force proposal on grevances
## Changes may affect future tenure appeals 
### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
The majority of yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting was devoted to
the first of two discussions concern
ing revisions to the faculty griev
ance and faculty discipline proce
dures.
The faculty grievance proce
dure is most commonly consulted
when a member of the faculty
chooses to appeal a tenure deci
sion. However, these procedures
are consulted whenever a member
of the faculty makes a written re
quest for a review of a decision
made by a person or group of peo

ple acting in an official university
capacity.
Last fall. University President
Gerhard Casper announced the
formation of a faculty task force to
analyze and revise the current fac
ulty grievance procedure, which
was written in 11>75.l l >75.
This task force presented its
proposed revisions at yesterday's
meeting. The first of the recom
mendations was to rename the
Statement on Faculty Grievance
Procedures the Statement on Fac
ulty Appeal Procedures.
Under the new statement, the
current multi-leveled system of
grievance and appeal will be sim

plified. Initial appeals will he made
to the provost, who will receive a
recommendation from the Adviso
ry Board following a hearing. If the
appellant is dissatisfied with the
provost's decision, he or she will he
able to appeal to the president.
Under the new statement, how
ever, the president has discretion
whether to entertain the appeal.
"I have found these cases really
to be just incredibly time-consum
ing," Casper said.
The new statement also clarifies
timelines to reduce delays in the re
view process, creates a standing
board of fact-finders to gather in
formation concerning appeals, and
shortens and consolidates the cur
rent Statement and Standing rules
from two documents to one.
"Our effort was to produce a
document that's clearer, more eas
ily accessible and flexible. This is
the best we could produce," Histo
ry Prof. James Sheehan said.
The senate will vote whether to
approve the proposed revisions at
its next meeting.
Casper briefly spoke to the sen
ate about proposed housing devel
opments in faculty housing areas
south of Campus Drive. The Hous
ing Task Force has requested more
time to complete its analysis of the
housing proposals, and Casper has
granted it to them. His goal is to
make a decision on the proposals
by the end of the academic quarter.
The closing action of the meet
ing was the unanimous decision to
give the new Cultural and Social
Anthropology Department and
the Department of Anthropologi
cal Sciences authority to grant un
dergraduate degrees.
Until this year, the pair com
bined to constitute the AnthropoU
ogv Department.
