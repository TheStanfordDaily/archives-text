1 he best sometimes isn't good enough. Bringing
together the top collegiate track and field talent in
the country will no doubt breed great perfor

on Jones, will take the competition to another level.
This is the philosophy that the organizers of the
41st annual Mt. San Antonio College Relays have
followed to make their event the premier relay
meet on the West Coast.
I he first event of the weekend actually started
yesterday and will conclude today. Held at Azusa
Pacific, the heptathlon portion of the Mt. SAC
meet is the first opportunity this season for most
athletes to get a lull heptathlon under their belts.
Stanford's Tracye Lawyer, the runner-up at last
year's N( AAs. aims toget the task of qualifying for
nationals out of the way. In a grueling event such as
the heptathlon, it is important to do so because of
the limited meets that contest the event.

might be a little off, she'll make up for it in the areas
she on."

go up against a stacked field of collegiate athletes
and professionals. Both All-American athletes
missed last year's entire track season and have only
had two races to get their rhythm back this spring.
"The opportunity at Mt. SAC is too got id for us
to pass up whether they're ready or not," Lananna
said. "We need to just compete anyway. We are
going to be in a position where we hope that they'll
get a good provisional qualifier or an automatic
qualifier and we'll go from there."

man Caroline Annis. Annis will be making her sea
son debut after finishing 53rd at the lAAF World
