### Alice Brown Staff writer 
In an election characterized by
a record voter turnout, the consti
tutional amendment to create sep
arate undergraduate and graduate
senates passed by an overwhelm
ing majority.
A two-thirds majority was
needed for the amendment to
pass, and 57.6 percent of those vot
ing supported the measure.
54.4 percent of undergraduates
and 37.5 percent of graduate stu
dents voted in the election. Last
year. 31.7 percent of undergradu
ates and only 3.7 percent of gradu

ate students voted.
"I'm excited [about the amend
ment passing]." ASSU President
Maren Norton said. "The record
turnout of graduate students illus
trates that they saw there was a
way and a place for them in stu
dent government."
ASSU Vice President Santos
Marroquin was also "very happy
that the amendment passed and
that the student body came out to
support it."

authors of the amendment, each
said this is a positive event for all
Stanford students.
"I think it's a great day for grad
uate students and a good day for un
dergraduates, too," Robinson said.
Shapiro elaborated, saying, "For

graduate students this is a no-brain
cr. Phey finally have a government
of their own. For undergraduates,
this is a fairness issue. Their govern
ment will no longer he distracted hy
issues that don't affect them."
The amendment must now be
approved by University President
Gerhard Casper.
Robinson and mathematics doc
toral student Hunter lart anticipate

that the amendment will go into ef
fect sometime in May and at the be
ginning of the summer at the latest.
During this transitional period
Shapiro looks forward to "hammer
ing out the details and getting [the
amendment] off to a good start."
Undergraduates as well as grad
uates expressed their support for
the amendment.
"I think [the amendment pass

ing] is fantastic," freshman senate
associate Peter Stair said.
"It's great that the students were
able to research the amendment on
their own and come to their own
conclusions," he said.
This amendment was proposed
in early February and voted onto
the election ballot two weeks later.
"Welcome to the ASSU, gradu
ate students," Norton said.
