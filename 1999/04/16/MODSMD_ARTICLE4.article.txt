### Alice Brown Staff writer 
In an election characterized by
a record voter turnout, the consti
tutional amendment to create sep
arate undergraduate and graduate
senates passed by an overwhelm
ing majority.
A two-thirds majority was
needed for the amendment to
pass, and 57.6 percent of those vot
ing supported the measure.
54.4 percent of undergraduates
and 37.5 percent of graduate stu
dents voted in the election. Last
year. 31.7 percent of undergradu
ates and only 3.7 percent of gradu

ate students voted.
"I'm excited [about the amend
ment passing]." ASSU President
Maren Norton said. "The record
turnout of graduate students illus
trates that they saw there was a
way and a place for them in stu
dent government."
ASSU Vice President Santos
Marroquin was also "very happy
that the amendment passed and
that the student body came out to
support it."
