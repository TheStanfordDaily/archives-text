## 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
Mike Levin and John Mills cap
tured nearly 60 percent of the stu
dent vote in the spring general
election to become next year's
ASSU president and vice presi
dent.
Levin, a sophomore, and Mills,
a doctoral student in genetics, rep
resent the first winning slate that
includes a graduate student since
the ASSU returned to a single
president system three years ago.

"I am truly humbled and hon
ored that nearly 3.0(H) people voted
for us," Levin said after the results
were announced last night. "1 will
give my all to this job."
"Tonight is a huge night for the
graduate student population."
Mills said. "The vote totals tell me
that the graduate students had a
voice in this election and that they
want to be part of this community."
Although the pair was officially
unopposed on the ballot, juniors
Adam Weiss and Jonathan Lotz ran
a write-in campaign. I hev received
K. 16 percent of the vote.
"We were very thrilled about
how positive and competitive this
presidential race was," Weiss s;iid.
"We wish Levin and Mills well and
know that they are both excellent
candidates."

Weiss udded that they were moti
vated to run in order to increase
competition and discussion of issues.
I Ic and I ,ot/ believed the vote totals
would have been significantly differ
ent had they appeared on the ballot.
Close to 25 percent of the total
votes were cast for "none of the
above."
"I lopcfully next year we can ad
dress that group" of voters. Levin
said.
The combination of a graduate

student and an undergraduate as
leaders of the ASSIJ is especially sig
nificant because of the passage of
the constitutional amendment that
will divide the ASSIJ into an Under
graduate Senate and a Graduate
Student Council.
ASSIJ President Maren Norton
thought that Mills' status as a gradu
ate student would help ease the tran
sition to the new system.
"It's exciting that we just . ..
elected an underuraduate and a

graduate student to lead the ASSI J,"
Norton said. "I think that it shows
that this campus is really dedicated
and willing to working together."
Levin and Mills' platform fo
cused on improving the relations be
tween the undergraduate and gradu
ate community. The pair has specific
project ideas they hope to pursue, in
cluding efforts to make used bicycles
available to students, improving the
condition of lighted pathways and
improving the ASSU's Draw guide.
In the coming weeks, the pair
hopes to meet individually with each
of the newly elected senators to see
what their goals and ambitions are.

They also plan to talk extensively
witli Norton and current Vice Presi
dent Santos Marroquin to make the
transition from ongoing projects
successful.
"Maren and I don't believe in the
term lame duck,' " Marroquin said.
"We want to make sure that we fin
ish all of the projects we have been
working on.
