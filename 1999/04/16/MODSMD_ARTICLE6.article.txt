## Bridging women's differences 
### Anuj Gupta Staff writer 
As part of the month-long series of "Her Story" events
celebrating women 011 campus, the South Asian women's
group Saheli is sponsoring a discussion tonight titled "The
Creation of a Collective Women's Community."
The dinner event, which is open to men as well as
women, will be held at 5:30 p.m. at the Women's Center.
Saheli organizers have invited other campus women's
groups, including Sisters in Stanford from the black com
munity, Unidas from the Latina community and repre
sentatives from the Lesbian, Clay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center.
According to senior Sonia Das. a Saheli member who
is helping to organize the event, the discussion will center
011 three broad questions exploring the possibility of forg
ing a more integrated women's community at Stanford.
"First we'll ask, 'Should we do it?" We'll ask if a unified
women's community is a good thing and explore what it
represents," Das said.

Secondly, Das said, "We'll ask. 'Can we do it?' [We'll
ask] what are the obstacles, such as crossing boundaries of
religion, race and sexual orientation."
"If it is possible, then finally we must ask. 'How should
we go about creating a cohesive women's community?" "
Das said.
Senior Anita Fancholi, another Saheli member who is
organizing the event, said the creation of a unified com
munity is complicated by the differences in ethnicity, reli
gion and sexual orientation among women.
"In reality a lot of women branch off into different di
rections that more closely til their personal back
ground One of the things people always ask is, 'Are
these divisions hurting us or helping us?' " Pancholi said.
Das said the event will attempt to focus on the tensions
among women that such divisions provoke.
"There are tangible tensions between women ... of
different backgrounds and perspectives, and we want to
bring them forth with the positive intention of moving to-
wards something larger and more
collective." I )as said.
Both l);is and Pancholi agreed
that the definition of "a collective
women's community" is difficult to
pin down, because it refers to a broad

concept.
In such a community, Pancholi
said, "People would concentrate on
their similarities more than their dif
ferences and support each other in
the sense of giving each other what
they need."
Das said Saheli is not taking a de
finitive stance on whether there
should he such a community at Stan

ford.
"We're not pushing a certain
agenda, we just want to create a
forum for open and honest discus
sion," Das said.
Saheli, which currently consists of
approximately 30 South Asian
women who meet weekly, was found
ed in 1 c >% by a group of women, in
cluding Das and Pancholi.

Das said she believes tonight's dis
cussion tits in perfectly with the "rec
iprocal education" aspect of the Sa
heli mission statement.
"As part of reciprocal education,
while we're developing perspectives
within our own community, it's really
important for us to engage in dia
logues with other communities," Das
said.
