Alcohol can cause devastating
harm. It can be academic,
social, legal, or health-related. The
more you drink, the greater the
risks. And unfortunately, one
single incident can lead to
irreparable damage. This sheet is
about how you can help prevent
that harm from occurring to you,
and to those you care about.
Why Do You Drink?
Three out of four Stanford stu
dents drink lightly, or not at all.
This often involves a conscious
choice, but a lot of drinking also
results from unconscious moti
vations. Becoming aware of why
you drink helps you choose more
freely, and reduces your risk of
harm. Do you drink to:
■ Get a break from your daily
routine?
■ Destress from school work?
■ Reward yourself?
■ Feel less inhibited in social
situations?
■ Fit in with others while they
are drinking?
■ Express feelings that are
difficult to express when
you're sober?
■ Suppress painful feelings such
as shame, anger, sadness, or
loneliness?
When you use alcohol to repress
or deal with life's challenges, you
miss an opportunity to grow and
to develop effective coping skills.
Following are some alcohol
alternatives to try:
Proactive measures like buddy
systems anil designated drivers
were still decades away when
these Stanford students tapped a
keg in the hills.
■ Talking with close friends
■ Stress reduction techniques
■ Your favorite smoothie
■ Natural highs (we have a list
of over 200)
■ Professional help (when
necessary)
To Prevent Harm
Here are "alcohol first aid tips
to help you prevent harm from
too much drinking:
■ Always appoint a designated
driver who will not drink
■ Set up a buddy system, and
stay together (don't abandon
intoxicated friends or let them
wander away; make sure they
get home safely)
■ Take car keys awav from an
intoxicated person who is
about to drive
■ Call 9-911 for help if an
intoxicated person can't be
awakened (it's more impor
tant to save life than worry
about the cost, hassle and
embarrassment of an Emer
gency Room visit)
Concerned?
Are you worried that a friend's
(or your own) alcohol consump
tion is a problem? Has drinking
become automatic or excessive ?
Is there trouble with academics,
friends, accidents .or injuries, or
the University or police? Some
students with alcohol problems
can regain control by consciously
and deliberately planning ahead
to avoid alcohol-related conse
quences, but others can't without
professional help. To better
understand the seriousness of a
friend's (or vour own) drinking
pattern, see our web site quick
check list under "Resources,"
below.
Diverse Opinions
Opinions about alcohol vary
widely. They reflect differences in
values, perceptions of risk, and
personality. Some students are
concerned about "second-hand"
harm from others' drinking (noise,
mess, disruption). Other ques
tions: Should alcohol be at
parties? 1 low much? Who should
pay for it? What about servers'
liability?
Don't let alcohol disrupt vour
community. Educate yourself and
each other, and discuss these
issues openly.
