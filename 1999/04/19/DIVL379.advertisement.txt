WE'LL ERASE YOUR
COLLEGE LOAN*
If you're stuck with a student loan that's not
in default, the Army might pay it off.
If you qualify, we'll reduce your debt —up
to $65,000. Payment is either V3 of the
debt or $1,500 for each year of service,
whichever is greater. ,
You'll also have training in a choice
of skills and enough self-assurance
to last you the rest of your life.
Get all the details from your
Army Recruiter.
