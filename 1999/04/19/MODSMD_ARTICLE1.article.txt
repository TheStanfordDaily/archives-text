# Hospital gets HP donation
## 
### Amy Reeves Contributing writer 
* Stanford's Children's Hospital
will be getting more than a million
dollars' worth of new equipment
from the Hewlett-Packard Com
pany this year, making it the com
pany's biggest equipment dona
tion in 1999.
"We are delighted to have
Hewlett-Packard set a new stan
dard for the corporate communi
ty," said Stephen Peeps, president
.and CEO of the Lucile Packard
Foundation for Children's
Health, which raises funds for the
School of Medicine.
The company will donate a
combined total of $1.6 million in

machines to the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital at
Stanford and to its sister hospital
at UC-San Francisco. Stanford
will get more than $1.2 million of
the goods, which include 27 fetal
monitors and optical imaging
equipment for use in labor and de
livery.
"Our field sales representa
tives worked with both hospitals
to find the proper allocation," said
Terry Burns, the foundation's
co mm un ica t ions o ffi ce r.
The gift isn't entirely free, how
ever. Burns said that the donation
is a "recipient-enhanced gift,"
meaning that the hospitals will

contribute 20 percent of the equip
ment's cost, or $320,000.

Although Lucile Packard was
the wife of David Packard, co
founder of Hewlett-Packard, the
company and the hospital have op
erated independently since their
creations.

The company has helped the
hospital in the past, however.
When the hospital opened in 1991,
the company donated $1.9 million
in equipment.
According to Roy E. Verley,

Hewlett-Packard's director of cor
porate philanthropy, the company
donates over $60 million in equip
ment every year. But it doesn't ex
pect to make any single donation
bigger than this one this year.
