Daily opinions editor
reflects on experience
of 1999 ASSU election

THE ANNUAL ASSU General
Elections look a whole lot dif
ferent from the perspective of a
Daily opinions editor.
In addition to being an informed
voter like any other student on cam
pus, part of my job in conjunction
with the other members of The
Daily's editorial board was to inform.
Our annual endorsement process
aims to help students better under
stand some of the issues in the elec
tion in a fair and effective way.
To that end, we spent numerous
hours poring over candidate and
group statements, special-fee budgets
and other relevant information. We
interviewed, discussed, researched
and then discussed again. Our process
culminated with the editorial board
holding itself in a room for seven
hours and making the decisions that
appeared on these pages last week.
I never thought an election could
take so much time to cover, but it was
worth it and I feel privileged to have
been a part of such a valuable part of
the process.
There were some problems this
year. Granted, il was arguably one of
the cleanest elections in recent mem
ory. Policy was implemented evenly
and appropriately. For example, when
Adam Weiss and Jonathan Lot/
declared their write-in candidacy, the
ASSU Elections Commission
responded by drafting clear plans for
handling misspelled write-in votes
and a possible runoff, should it have
been necessary.
The Elections Commission did
make some mistakes, though. The
Elections Commissioner, members of

his office and of the Elections I lear
ings Office should not have co-signed
a paid advertisement that ran in The
Daily last Tuesday and Wednesday.
Part of running an election is main
taining strict impartiality at all times.
Signing this advertisement violated
the spirit that should have been main
tained at all times during the election.
Neither the Elections Commission
nor the I learings Office should have
publicly involved themselves, even if
only in name, in discussion over the
constitutional amendment.
Voting issues were brought to light
this year. This was most visible when
Junior C lass Presidential Candidate
Sean Tolpinrud dropped out of the
race after admitting to asking non
sophomore friends to vote for him by
falsifying their class year on ballots.
The fact that it is even possible to
vote as a member of a class other than
your own shows that there are not
adequate provisions for maintaining
voting consistency during the elec
tion. There aren't even regulations
that dictate what class a given student
should identify himself or herself as a
part of.
Perhaps in future years, the Elec
tions Commission might consider
adding an honor eode affirmation on
each ballot that asks each student to
confirm that his or her class year is
correct and accurate to the best of
their knowledge. Using a PIN elec
tronic signature as an additional safe
guard would be prudent.
Any election is no doubt a sizeable
undertaking for any office. This year
was no exception.
In dealing with these issues and
others, perhaps future elections will
be even cleaner. It is an important
part of any election, and of any
democracy.
