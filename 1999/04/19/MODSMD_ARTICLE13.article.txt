# Ruminations
## Mari Webel Taking the plunge this spring 
### 
Bikini, thong.
Love handles. Cup
size. Tan line. Not
something we all think
about everyday, necessari
ly, unless we are the unfor
tunate inhabitants of a
dressing room with several

ill-fitting swimsuits strewn across the floor.
Living in an area where warm and fuzzy is
OK. where the sun is out more days of the
year than il is hiding behind a bank of gray
clouds and where the water is usually too
blasted cold to dip a toe, let alone dash into,
the arrival of ;i distinctive swimsuit season is
not too noticeable.
I lowever, those of us who come from a
place where the smell of Coppertone and the
persistence of sunshine heralds a season of
in-the-water-because-it's-too-hotto-do-any
thing-else, the gradual warming and length
ening of the northern California day elicits a
"whoa, I'm pale" and an almost frantic rush
to the dresser to rummage through last year's
version of trendy and the ever-present "ideal
coverage" spandex contraption which never
quite satisfies.
Men, you're excluded from this. Pull on
some Umbros, and you're ready for water
and whatever can happen in or out of the
pool, ocean, lake or backyard slip 'n' slide.
Some of my female readers are blessed with
high metabolism, strenuous exercise sched
ules or simply the grace of the gods when
they were handing out body shapes and need
not worry over such trivial matters as, one
friend so aptly puts it, the "beached whale

phenomenon." In such cases, in the water,
you're fine, but the in-between spaces, the
shower room or deck chair, only promise a
feeling of inadequacy or overcorrection on
the part of Mother Nature. So, do you com
plain still, shrink from the invitation to a mid
night romp at DcGuerre or from the possi
bilities for glee inherent in that spring quar
ter beach trip your RAs have been promising
the whole year?
Maybe. I'll admit it. You can stay home.
Stay home in sweats, overscrutinizing. Fre
quently ask your dormmates if your butt is all
right for human visual consumption. You
can wear a tank top and soccer shorts and
feel no pain and rightly so. If you are good
enough to yourself to tell the established
fashion hierarchy to leave your body the
heck alone, you need to start preaching that
gospel to women all over the world.
But the purpose here isn't to remind you
of your personal inadequacies or past ncu
roses, rather to point out the fallacy inherent
in judging your body and forming your own
body-image by how you can squeeze into a
nylon tube with pre-cut holes or how you
look with your shirt off after a long winter
quarter of rain (because yes, men do feel the
pain, too).
Let me provide an example. Think of the
last time you heard someone say "I have a
bubble-butt." Stand up. Now, try to look at
your rear. 1 mean really give your derriere a
good gander, check yourself out like you
imagine happens at a party when you're feel
ing frisky and singing the praises of Sir Mix-
A-Lot. You can twist, you can arch, you can

contort your poor back into any number of
weird spirals, and you still won't see it like
everyone else does. From this simple exer
cise, remind yourself that of course you think
your body looks weird, you're looking at it
more closely, more frequently and with a
more critical eye than you will ever be
exposed to until cohabitation or becoming a
centerfold. We are our own worst enemy
when it comes to body image, and the
demons emerge en masse when the summer
rolls around.
The answer to persistent body image
woes and self-destructive criticism? Well,
you could choose your friends wisely ("Arc
you a size 12? Me, too! Let's go shopping!"),
re-evaluate your system of self-appraisal or
realize the things you've got that make you
your very own type of out of this world. You
may have a big tummy but movie-star eyes,
or rail-thin arms but a great smile, or short
legs and the fantastic ability to tell great
jokes without giving away an incoming
punch line by giggling, or funky hair but the
ability to actually say something intelligent in
your section with that particularly obtuse
professor. Talent and character are not
based on, or in any way remotely related to,
your bra size or ability to bench press God
knows-what. A dear friend once told me that
pretty is perfection but beauty is the balance
of imperfection and grace. Be kinder to
yourself and watch the days get rosier.
