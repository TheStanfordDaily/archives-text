SCBN apologizes for snafu
Preceding Saturday's Viewer's Choice
movie, a public service announcement from
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints was aired.
Unfortunately, two circumstances mis
construed the intended message. First, text
prior to its airing said "A message from our
sponsor." Second, immediately following
was the movie "Dazed and Confused," a
film that promotes values contrary to those
of the church.
I he text should have read "A public ser
vice announcement." A clarification and
apology was placed on the screen during the
movie.
We apologize to the church members for
any misunderstanding. The message of the
church and other nonprofit and government
organizations will always be welcome dur
ing our local programming.

Daily should not endorse
As we piece through the wreckage of yet
another fun-filled ASSIJ election season,
the same thoughts that have run through my
mind the past three years rang yet again:
The Daily should not be in the business of
influencing the election. The Daily unfairly
and deliberately attempts to shape the voice
of the populace into the mold of its own
biased and, sadly, mostly uninformed views.
Careful consideration of past elections

proves th;it (his activity occurs most visibly
in the wholly unfair "endorsement" process.
We live in an age when there are a vast
number of media sources vying for our
attention, lake my home region of the New
York metropolitan area. There are six local
news affiliates from which I can hear about
elections. When it comes to the print media,
some five real newspapers exist as well.
Each of the papers endorses candidates for
a public that knows full well that some of
the papers are traditionally conservative
and others leaning towards not.
When these "real" newspapers endorse a
candidate, they do so under the guise that
their editorial boards are reflecting the
views of their perceived readership. If I
don't like who the limes endorses, 1 can
always look to the Daily News or Newsday
for a different angle on who the better can
didate might be, knowing that each one's
agenda is coming from a different angle
catered to a subset of the population.
I submit that The Daily is not a "real"
newspaper. It has a monopoly on informa
tion on the Stanford campus — it is basical
ly the only source of daily news one can get
here.
It is for that reason alone that The Daily
should not be endorsing anyone. Doing so is
unfair to other candidates because, as each
real newspaper has its own idiosyncrasies,
political tendencies and editorial views, so
does The Daily. We can't look past the fact
that The Daily, in striving to be the valu
able. yet singular campus news source,
should realize that it has the power to
unjustly influence elections with this role
and should cease from doing so since there
are no other viable sources to turn to for

views on the election.
Furthermore, what is the political stance
of The Daily anyway? When an issue of dis
crimination comes up, it rushes to the aid of
liberals by chiding the tenure process. When
it conies to writing about how great our
school is, it takes an elitist stance that is the
mark of an affluent campus.
The Daily is our only news source, and
yet it doesn't know which way it leans in
assuming that role.
What are the consequences of this power
The Daily has? Thankfully, the past two
elections have shown that it is quite small.
My fears that uninformed students will
blindly pick who The Daily endorses have
been quelled by the fact that the endorse
ment has proven to mean quite little in the
form of tangible results, suggesting that
either no one reads the paper, or no one
really listens to what it has to say. But more
importantly for The Daily, it suggests that
the paper has no backbone and is "wishy
washy."
Case in point is last year's presidential
endorsement, where The Daily would have
us believe that Matt Spence and Bianca
Ling were the second coming of Christ.
After the students sent a mandate and
defeated them. The Daily has since acted as
if it never endorsed Spence and Ling in the
first place, constantly singing the praises of
the current president and vice president.
While Maren Norton and Santos Marro
quin have undoubtedly done an excellent
job. The Daily made a conscious decision
not to endorse them last year, for whatever
reasons.
If The Daily seeks to be the singu
lar campus editorial force and a news source

at the same time, it looks just plain hypo
critical to kiss the butt of the current regime
in every article as if it never slighted them in
the endorsement process.
The paper should stick by its guns and
view Norton and Marroquin's actions from
the lens it wrongly used by not endorsing
them last year — that of a critical observer.
Unfortunately, it does not.
What should the paper do? It should
keep giving each slate equal space in those
puffy campaign profiles that we can always
count on for having cheesy photos of the
candidates amidst a backdrop of bad light
ing. It should continue printing letters from
the people about the candidates with equal
space given to both sides. But it should not
continue to endorse anyone when it exists
as the only source of news on campus.
The Daily can't claim to be an unbiased
source and then turn around and endorse a
slate, not when elections here basically exist
in the vacuum of flyers and exposure in The
Daily.
Yet, if it is going to continue to do so, it
should stick by its editorial views. This year,
it unceremoniously endorsed the losing
slate — which suggests to the people that
The Daily found fault in ASSLJ President
elect Michael Levin and Vice President
elect John Mills in not endorsing them. If it
ignores this fact next year and patronizes
them at every turn as it has done with Nor
ton and Marroquin this year, it will sadly
prove true the constant rumblings that The
Daily is not a "real" newspaper and further
annoy those who want it to be one.
