						Phantom Menace destroys voter apathy

LAST WEEK'S RECORD turnout of
graduate student voters sent a clear
message to the ASSU. Put a meaning
ful issue on the ballot, like the splitting of stu
dent government into undergraduate and
graduate branches, and they'll come out in
droves.
Or else, just give them the chance to see
Obi Wan Kenobi.
You see, in a movie tie-in that would
make even the Happy Meal gurus blush, the
Graduate Student Council sponsored a "Get
Out the Grad Vote" contest in which I,(XX)
graduate students had the opportunity to win
tickets to the new "Star Wars" movie. The
catch: The only way to enter the contest was
through a special link on the council's Web
site — a link that was also conveniently locat
ed next to an electronic ballot and below
some very pleading paragraphs explaining
why it was absolutely necessary that the
graduate population have its own govern
ment. You didn't have to vote to enter the
contest, but would it be that difficult to exer
cise your democratic rights before joining
Darth and R2D2? With more than 10 times
the number of graduate students voting in

this year's election compared to last year's,
the answer was a definitive no.
The moral of this story: Not that the
ASSU shouldn't have been split (it should
have) or that the council was underhanded in
its campaign (it was), but that a man named
George and his empire of droids, Jedis and
storm troopers have entered places no sane
person would have thought possible. Raffle
off tickets to "The Matrix," and you have
about as much chance of getting grad stu
dents to the polls as you do of finding them
affordable housing. But give away tickets
(estimated retail value: $7.50) to the nation's
most all-encompassing cultural event since
NASA landed a man on the moon, and all of
a sudden, Stanford gets political.
Perhaps we're an anomaly, with all our
programming freaks making us the prime
breeding ground for sci-fi mania. Unfortu
nately, let's just say that we've only experi
enced an extremely mild case of this peculiar
end-of-the-American Century disease.
The site of the most massive infection
seems to be Mann's Chinese Theater in Hol
lywood, where, as of Saturday night, 48 peo
ple were lined up for tickets to "The Phan

torn Menace." So, a little enthusiasm for a
long-awaited film, what of that?
The movie opens May 19.
For one month, these 48 people, aban
doning both job and family, will set up camp
in this makeshift Wookieville so they can be
some of the first in the country to see the
film. I am not sure whether anyone has told
them that it will be playing for more than one
day.
Lincoln Gasking. the Koresh-like leader
of the group. Hew in from Australia to orga
nize the event and is currently preparing a
live Web-cast of the camp's many exciting
happenings, such as the recent visit of Jake
Lloyd, who plays the young Darth Vader in
the film. The Web-cast will be broadcast on
Countingdown.com, a Web site dedicated to
anticipation.
According to Jenelle Riley, an editor for
Countingdown.com, the people online are
"witty, intelligent, educated individuals." "I
would never presume to stereotype them
together as a bunch of losers," Riley writes,
"If there's one common thread that I would
point out, it's that they are all FUN."
Riley also points out that certain critiques

of Gasking — the ones begging him to "get a
life" — are unfair. "There are few people I
know who experienee [life] to the fullest. Liv
ing life, really LIVING it, takes an
unabashed enthusiasm that I know Gasking
and his colleagues have in spades." On the
one hand, Riley's arguments dramatically re
envision the Emersonian concept of tran
scendental existence and on the other, point
to the way "Star Wars" mania can affect
one's mental faculties.
If only we could quarantine the infection
to Mann's Chinese. However, camps are
already being planned for New York,
Boston. Chicago and other metropolitan
areas.
Pepsi will release 12 specially designed
cans to commemorate the film, including a
gold Yoda version. Seven thousand Web
sites are already devoted to the prequel
melodrama, with more expected in the final
weeks. A research firm estimates that the
American economy will lose $300 million
due to the massive number of workers who
plan to "take off' from work to view the
flick.
Granted, this mania symbolizes a general

dissatisfaction with life, a yearning for a vir
tual heroism that reality can no longer pro
vide. But, if handled correctly, it also might
allow for unprecedented social change. If a
single ticket can woo thousands of graduate
students into voting, then the potential of this
cinematic revolution is limitless.
Here's the plan: You must prove your
civic worth to see the film. Link the purchase
of a ticket into what 1 would call the Civic
Worth Database. If you haven't paid your
taxes, parking tickets or child support, no
ticket for you. If you haven't volunteered for
more than 10 hours in the past year, no tick
et for you. If people are willing to fly halfway
across the globe to sleep on a sidewalk for
one month for this film, they'd sure be open
to reforming themselves a bit.
We must seize this opportunity while it
lasts because, if not, we'd have to wait until
2001, when the next "Star Wars" movie is set
to open.

voted in last week \s election and just happenei
to win tickets. The two events, he assures you
are completely unrelated.
