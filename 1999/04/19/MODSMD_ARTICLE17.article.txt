### Carmel Levitan 
Last weekend, Stanford hosted a conference
that brought together approximately 150 students,
workers, academics and activists to discuss labor is
sues and plan future activism.
The conference's panels featured a number of
local union leaders and professors from Stanford,
UC-Berkeley and UC-Santa Cruz, highlighted by
Stanford Law Prof. William Gould, former chair of
the National Labor Relations Board.
Through simultaneous gatherings held at Stan
ford, Harvard, Kent State and Yale, students at
schools from across the country joined to form a
national labor organization.
The conference's purpose was "envisioning and
finding leadership for national solidarity reform
through the launching of a historical movement,"
said senior Jill Shenker, a conference's organizer.
She traced the origin of the conference to the re
cent formation of Stanford's Student Labor Action
Coalition. Last year. Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford and MEChA, a Chicano / Lati-

no student group, "formed the Coalition for Labor,
Dignity and Justice. That group worked together
on United Farm Worker Solidarity," she said.
The groups decided to dissolve the Coalition for
Labor, Dignity and Justice this fall so that a per
mant organization, the Student Labor Action
Coalition, could be formed.
Ethan Kaplan, a doctoral student in economics
and one of the primary organizers of both the coali
tion and the conference, added, "we decided to
form a labor group because we noticed stuff going
on campus."
Recent labor issues on campus include a vote by
some Stanford Hospital workers this winter to
unionize and partially successful efforts by
MEChA to ban table grapes from campus dining
halls. MEChA urged the ban because of the poor
working conditions of those who pick those grapes.
"We started talking about forming a group to
deal with more local issues, then got the idea of hav
ing a student coalition," Kaplan said.
Six months ago, Kaplan began working with ju
nior Eli Naduris-Weissman to plan the conference.

According to Shenker, "Eli and Ethan had the vi
sion."
Kaplan described the conference attendees as,
"knowledgeable and committed about the issues. I
think they are going to go back to their campuses
and organize."
One of the primary purposes of the conference
was to link labor activists from different cities, col
leges and forums.
Panelist Kelly Naylor. a master's student in en
vironmental engineering, was encouraged by the
networks she saw forming at the conference. "Con
nections are being made all over the place, with
side conversations happening everywhere." she
said.
Most of the students came from schools
throughout California, including most of the Uni
versity of California schools, USC, Cal State-Sacra
mento and a significant number of community col
leges, particularly DeAnza College. According to
Kaplan, "the community colleges are extremely ac
tive, and we at Stanford have a lot to learn from
them."
