## Outfielder pushes USC over top Lane posts five RBIs 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
If the Stanford Cardinal pitch
ing staff ever sees USC outfielder
Jason Lane again, it will be too
soon.
It was Lane's five-RBI perfor
mance in yesterday's insane 17-15
victory over the second-ranked
Cardinal that helped the Trojans
win the series and forge a first
place tie in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence between the two schools.
After the teams split the first
two games, there was a sense of
urgency heading into yesterday's
game for the Trojans.
A Cardinal victory would have
put it up two games with a far eas
ier schedule than the one USC
will face.
Furthermore, the Trojans
would have been playing catchup
without star catcher Eric Munson,
who is out for the rest of the sea
son with a broken hand.
"We would have been playing
for second place," said USC head
coach Mike Gillespie.
So after falling behind 9-2
heading into the fifth inning, USC
found itself in an especially des
perate situation. Instead of rolling
over, however, the Trojans pro
duced a comeback in which Lane
set the tone, much to Stanford's
chagrin.
"We kind of had a rough start
to the game," Lane said. "It was
nice to come back and help the
team out."
In USC's eight-run fifth in
ning, it was Lane's RBI double
that made the score 9-5 and set
the stage for freshman catcher
Beau Craig's game-tying grand
slam.
After Stanford pushed ahead
13-10. it was Lane's leadoff home
run in the eighth inning that
kicked off USC's four-run burst
and gave them the lead for good.
But it was his final at-bat in the
ninth inning that best personified
Stanford's frustration with Lane.
It was still only a one-run game

and with the ball flying out of
Sunken Diamond, a comeback
was certainly not out of the ques
tion. With two on and two out.
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess headed out on his well
beaten path to the mound and
brought in freshman right-hander
Mike Wodnicki — the seventh
Stanford pitcher of the day — to
face the right-handed hitting
Lane.
Clearly, Marquess was playing
the percentages. And with the top
of the order coming up. things
certainly seemed promising for
the Cardinal.
Unfortunately, Wodnicki
grooved a 1-1 breaking pitch that
Lane did not miss.
Everyone in the ballpark knew
it was gone, including Stanford
left fielder Edmund Muth. As the
ball sailed over his head, Muth
threw up his arms and slammed
them against the left field wall in
frustration, the agony and the
magnitude of the blow all too ap
parent.
"It was huge for us," Lane said
of yesterday's victory. "We're still
hurt without Munson, but we've
been playing well and this sets us
up good to play for the confer
ence championship."
With USC now tied for first,
Stanford now knows it is in for a
dog fight the rest of the way.
While the Cardinal only has
games against California, Oregon
State and UCLA remaining, a
two-game cushion would have
provided more margin for error.
"Cal's a toss-up, and UCLA's
one of the hottest teams in the
conference right now," Marquess
said. "There's no easy weekend
for us."
Yesterday was an opportunity
missed for Stanford, and it could
very well be a turning point in
USC's season — after all, the Tro
jans did start 5-11.
But it happens, and now Stan
ford will need to step up much
like the Trojans did yesterday in
rallying for a victory.
