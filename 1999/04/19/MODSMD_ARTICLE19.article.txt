The new question to ask concern
ing the Stanford women's lacrosse
team (15-4, 7-1 Women's Western
Lacrosse League) isn't "Did they
win?" but rather "How much did
they win by?" When they win, the
women leave no room for doubt that
they are the best team on the field.
On Saturday, the team secured
the No. 1 seed going in the WWLL
playoffs with a 15-4 victory over UC-
Davis.
"With this No. 1 position intact,
the Cardinal expects to go all the
way to the WWLL Final Four being
hosted by Stanford on May 8-9,"
said head coach Heidi Connor.

and [we] came up with an impressive
win," said Connor. "I think that this
proves that we are ready for the next
challenge."
The Cardinal led off with a bang
and held its momentum for the
whole game. Four minutes into the
match it was already up 4-0 with se
nior co-captain Alexis Patrizio lead
ing the effort with two goals.
"It was an amazing game," Pa
trizio said. "Everybody was giving
110 percent. Our transition game
