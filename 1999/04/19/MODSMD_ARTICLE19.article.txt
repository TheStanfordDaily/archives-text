# Lacrosse beats Davis, St. Mary's
## 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
The new question to ask concern
ing the Stanford women's lacrosse
team (15-4, 7-1 Women's Western
Lacrosse League) isn't "Did they
win?" but rather "How much did
they win by?" When they win, the
women leave no room for doubt that
they are the best team on the field.
On Saturday, the team secured
the No. 1 seed going in the WWLL
playoffs with a 15-4 victory over UC-
Davis.
"With this No. 1 position intact,
the Cardinal expects to go all the
way to the WWLL Final Four being
hosted by Stanford on May 8-9,"
said head coach Heidi Connor.

The women were able to keep
their heads in the game despite the
taunting Davis fans, who were ener
gized by "UC-Davis Picnic Day"
and the two teams' historic rivalry.
"They channeled their energy
and [we] came up with an impressive
win," said Connor. "I think that this
proves that we are ready for the next
challenge."
The Cardinal led off with a bang
and held its momentum for the
whole game. Four minutes into the
match it was already up 4-0 with se
nior co-captain Alexis Patrizio lead

110 percent. Our transition game

team improve each year, said she is
sad now that her last regular-season
home game is over, but at the same
time looks with excitement toward
the Final Four.
"We've had a successful week

have to continue our focus because
