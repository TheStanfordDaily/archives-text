# Mile-long exhibit illustrates planet's evolutionary history

A million years of evolutionary
history fit neatly in a corner of cam
pus last Friday and Saturday.
"A Walk Through Time ... From
Stardust To Us," sponsored by the
Palo Alto-based Foundation for
Global Community, showed a series
of 90 large illustrated panels that
chronologically displayed the most
significant stages in the development
of life on Earth.
The idea for the project originated
in 1970 by then-Stanford Human Bi
ology Prof. Sidney Liebes. The walk
began with a presentation on the ori
gins of Earth 5 billion years ago and
ended with a panel on life today.
According to Wileta Burch, a vol
unteer at the foundation, the purpose
of the walk was "to get a hold of the

whole evolutionary story because
that is where we came from."
The walk also attempted to ad
dress the most significant events in
Earth's history and focused on hu
manity's place in the cosmos. Every
footstep of the mile-long educational
journey, which started at Mitchell
Earth Sciences Building and ended at
the Gilbert Biological Sciences
Building, transported the visitor I
million years in time.
Presentations included subjects
such as "Big Bang," "How the ()zone
Formed" and "Mitochondria."
One of the walk's more interest
ing elements was its method of track
ing the evolution of life. For example,
microbial life appeared a little more
than 1 ,(XK) feet after the walk began
and remained the sole life form for
the majority of the mile. Human be
ings only appeared in the last three

feet.
According to Jane Kroll, a volun
teer for the foundation, the walk gave
a "context for the kinds of decisions
we make for the future."
Jane Pillar-Wilson brought her
two sons to the walk because it pro
vided a "physical sense to something
they learn on paper."
Speaking for her seven-year-old,
Pillar-Wilson admitted that the walk
was not just about appreciating the
environment. He might have accom
panied his mother in order to "devel
op patience and get a smoothie at the
end."
The walk continued yesterday at
both Parkside Hall and the Civic Au
ditorium in San Jose. On Saturday
the event will be held at the main pa
rade ground of the Presidio National
Park. On Sunday it will move to the
Concord Pavilion in Concord.
