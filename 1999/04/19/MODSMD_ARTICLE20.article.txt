WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday: No. 5 Stanford (22-2, 8-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) 7, No. 4
UCLA (17-7,5-3) 2.

■ Friday: Stanford 7, USC (17-8,6-1)
i

The lone singles loss came at the
No. 3 position. Freshman Gabby
Lastra fell to USC's Jacqui Boyd,
6-1, 5-7, 6-2. While Boyd played a

solid match. Forood partly attrib
uted Lastra's loss to her recent
hand injury.
Freshman Lauren Kalvaria. ju
nior Jennifer Heiser and sopho
more Sara Pestieau all won their
respective matches in straight sets.
Pestieau, who clobbered USC's
Caroline Christian, 6-2, 6-0, was
filling in for freshman Keiko Toku
da at the No. 6 singles spot. Tokuda
skipped the weekend's play while
recovering from an illness.
"One beauty of this team is that
Sara was a starter last year,"
Forood said. "She came out match
tough against USC because she had
played regulation matches at the
No. 7 spot. She's always ready to go
— that's her personality and it's
great."
Pestieau was also instrumental
in shaping the Cardinal's 7-2 victo
ry over UCLA on Saturday, rout
ing Bruin Jennifer Donahue, 6-1,6-
0.
Stanford won every match
against the Bruins aside from the
top two singles matchups. Irvin fell
to UCLA's Annica Cooper in three
dramatic sets, 7-5, 5-7, 6-0.
Cooper avenged two previous
straight-set losses to Irvin this sea
son.
"It was not one of Marissa's bet
ter days," Forood said. "Cooper's
very difficult to play and Marissa
was having some control problems.
The third set wasn't as much of a
runaway as the score indicates."
Considering Irvin posted a 23-

match win-streak at one point dur
ing the season, onlookers are star
tled every time she suffers a loss,
wondering if her game is in sham
bles. Irvin's teammates, however,
are not concerned about her recent
defeats.
"Everyone's going to lose at
some point," said freshman Lauren
Kalvaria. "I'd rather she lose now
and win the NCAAs later this sea
son. It's not a big deal, and I don't
think she's worried about it."
Brennan agreed.
"I don't know exactly what to
make of her loss," he said. "I think
her concentration is wavering a bit
for whatever reason."
Junior captain and All-Ameri
can Teryn Ashley, ranked fourth in
the nation, also fell on Saturday.
She was facing Bruin Amanda
Basica for the fourth time this sea
son.
Ashley took their first two en
counters in straight sets, but Basica
has toppled Ashley in three sets in
their two most recent meetings.
Ashley won the first-set
tiebreaker, but Basica rallied to
claim the second set 6-1 and battled
to a 6-4 win in the third.
Lastra. Kalvaria and Heiser all

took their matches to keep the Car
dinal afloat. Kalvaria's 6-4, 6-1 tri
umph over UCLA's Elizabeth
Schmidt was especially impressive.
"I'm playing a lot better these
days," Kalvaria said. "I've ma
tured. College tennis is a lot differ
ent from the juniors."
Forood said that Kalvaria, who
was ranked second in the nation as
a junior, is showing the talent and
tenacity that made her a top colle
giate recruit.
"Lauren's playing so well,"
Forood said. "She's really making a
big move right now."
Irvin and Ashley gained some
measure of revenge in the doubles
competition as they overcame
UCLA's duo of Cooper and Basi
ca, K-6. Stanford took all three dou
bles matches.
The newly-crowned Pac-10
champs are thrilled with the week
end's performance and their cur
rent play.
"I think we're all playing so well
at the end of the season," Kalvaria
said. "We're peaking now when it's
counting."
The Cardinal will meet Fresno
State at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday at the
Taube Tennis Center.
