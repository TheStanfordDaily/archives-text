## 
### Jake Willens Staff writer 
The men's tennis team will not
be No. 9 for long as it just complet
ed its best week of tennis this year,
capping it off with an emotionally
charged 4-3 win over the No. 1
UCLA Bruins on Saturday at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
With its three wins this week, the
Cardinal assured itself a spot as one
of the teams that will host an
NCAA regional and probably a
seeding in the top four of the nation.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday: Stanford (IS-2) 4, No. 1
UCLA (21-2)3.
■ Friday: No. 9 Stanford 6. USC (17-
4)1.

The Saturday match against
UCLA was college tennis at its very
best at every point from noon until
5 p.m., when sophomore Scotty
Scott finished his third set to clinch
the match. The Cardinal's 4-3 victo
ry over the Bruins was ended fit
tingly with a ceremony after the
match honoring senior leader Ryan
Wolters for his final dual match at
home.
Wolters carried on the tradition
initiated by Stanford assistant coach
John Whitlinger several years ago
when he climbed up the ladder and
removed his name from the score
board to a standing ovation from
the crowd. Stanford head coach
Dick Gould then made a touching
speech about Wolters" inspiration
both on and off the court for the
Cardinal over his four years here.
He handed the microphone to
Wolters who then proceeded to
thank his coaches, teammates, fam

ily and friends.
The atmosphere on Saturday did
justice to the importance and quali
ty of this match. The UCLA-Stan
ford rivalry has been a strong one
for several decades, and this match
could not possibly have let down
anyone's expectations. In fact, it
probably exceeded the level of play,
the intensity and the drama most
could have imagined.
The Cardinal knew it had to try
to jump out early in the doubles be
cause last time the two teams met,
the Bruins won the doubles point
and used it to inspire them in their
singles play. At the No.l doubles
spot, junior Geoff Abrams and
sophomore Alex Kini played per
haps their best match of the year by
making quick work of UCLA's
team of Jason Cook and Brandon
Kramer 8-2.
At this point the Cardinal knew
that it only had to take one of the re
maining two matches. At the No. 3
spot, Junior David Hauser and
Scott were down 7-3, so it appeared
Wolters and freshman K.J. Hippen
steel had to come through if the
team was to win the doubles point.
Hauser and Scott refused to quit,
however, and fought back to win
five straight games in dramatic fash
ion. Hauser was then serving for the
match at 8-7, 3()-love before
UCLA's Martin Rozpedski and
Chris Sands fought off numerous
match points to send the match into
an 8-8 tiebreaker.
Both teams then fought off mul
tiple match points in the tiebreaker
before the Cardinal dropped the
match 9-8(11-9).
Although this loss was tough to
handle, it appeared the Cardinal
was still in decent shape as Wolters
was serving at 7-6,40-love in the No.

2 match. The Bruins* team of Jean-
Noel Grinda and Jong Min Lee also
refused to let down and they too
sent the match into a tiebreaker and
eventually won 9-8, (7-5 tiebreak).
This turn of events had potential
to be devastating for the Cardinal.
The Bruins had every bit of mo
mentum and knew they only had to
take three of the six singles points to
win the match.
It looked as if they were going to
do just this as Grinda defeated
Wolters 6-4,6-4 to give the Bruins a
2-0 lead.
It was at this point when things
began to change for Stanford.
Abrams and Hippensteel continued
their consistent dominance with
two wins that evened the match at 2-
2. At this point, all stadium matches
were complete and every fan moved
to the back courts to witness the
four, five and six singles spots.
Sophomore Ali Ansari suffered a
close loss to UCLA's Rozpedski 6-
3,6-4.
Now the Cardinal knew it had to
win the final two matches. As
Ansari's match finished, Kim was
just beginning his third set and Scott
was losing 4-5 in the second set after
taking the first 6-4.
Kim made quick work of his op
ponent in the third set by gaining an
early break and never looking back.
He won the set 6-3 and thus put all
eyes on Scott. Scott had lost the sec
ond set 4-6 and was on serve 2-2 in
the third when Kim won.
The audience converged on each
side of Scott's court and roared after
each point. It appeared as if Scott
thrived off of this atmosphere as he
broke Lee and win the match 6-4,4-
6,6-3.
"Scotty played as well as I have
ever seen," Wolters said. "After los
ing against SC, he was really down,
and I was so happy to see him get his
revenge the next day. This match re
ally goes to show how we are a team
that picks each other up."
The previous day the Cardinal

used the momentum it had accrued
with its 4-3 comeback victory over
Pepperdine on Tuesday to domi
nate the No. 13 USC Trojans 6-1.
The Cardinal jumped on top of USC
immediately by winning the doubles
point, and it never let up in the sin
gles matches.
"Friday's performance against
USC was especially impressive be
cause we had potential both to be a
little drained after Pepperdine and

to he caught looking ahead to
UCLA," Gould said. "Instead we
focused on every match and we re
ally put some solid matches togeth
er."
The only loss the Cardinal suf
fered against the Trojans was at the
No. 5 singles spot, where Scott lost
in straight sets. Scott was very down
after Friday's match, but he more
than made up for it the next day
against the Bruins.
