Two freshman groups, "The Hard Core 4"
and "Mentos: The Froshmakers," who ran
against each other for sophomore class pres
idents last week have decided to put aside
their campaign animosities and make a
porno movie. The groups were contacted by
a pornographer who happened to be on
campus during last week's election and
picked up a copy of the ASSU Elections
Handbook.
"I'm really excited," he said, "because this
movie will practically write itself based on
the activities which these groups proposed
during their campaigns!"
The first half of the movie will be per
formed by the "Hard Core 4," a group com
posed of Erin Vargo, Morgan Hallmon,
Jacob Greene and Justin Shenkarow. They

will be performing acts based on their cam
paign promises, from "Slip-n-Slide
Saturdays" to "Swinging in San Francisco"
and "Big Game Blowout."
The second group consists of the winning
"Froshmakers" Kathy Huang, Mo Khan,
Andres Small and Danny Cox. Their slogan
"It's all about 2002-gether!" will be enacted
in vivid Technicolor. Also, they are planning
on changing their name from "Mentos: The
Froshmaker" to "Kathy â€” want Mo Small
Cox?"
"This whole project is just going to be
delicious," explained Shenkarow, best known
for his cameo in "Chains and Chest Hair."
"It's always great to get back to your roots!"
This kind of cooperation goes to show that
at Stanford, it really isn't all about winning,
guys.
