# Graduate Students Rebel

### Bob Gates 
(This article is a transcript of a radio brief
given from the front by gallant and sexy Daily
reporter Bob Gates yesterday.)
The smoke-filled passageways of Wilbur
Hall provide a window onto the raging war
waged on campus toway â€” excuse me, today.
Last night at approximately 6:ooam EST,
graduate students from Rains and Escondido
Village infiltrated this concrete-walled under
graduate housing fortress. Led by
Aeronautics student Jon "The Knife" Nichols
and his trusty sidekick / fingerpuppet Rex,
enraged graduate students armored with
bicycle helmets and pant-leg protectors
stormed the dorms of Arroyo and Cedro
before passing into the other Wilbur resi
dences.
Nichols and his forces encountered harsh
resistance led by the newly elected ASSU pres
ident, who chose to remain anonymous, cit
ing his need to prove that he "did not really
run for a powerless office just to put some
thing important on his resume as most major
consulting firms do not know that the
Administration holds all the power at this
University. Also, 1 would like to clear up
rumors that to run for office you have to be
able to subjugate your morality and become a
prick."
The president is leading a valiant defensive
effort, still holding the dining hall but having
lost ground in far east Wilbur. I am now ven
turing across the front to interview rebel
alliance leader Nichols himself....
Sir, why are the graduate students
rebelling? Wasn't the constitutional amend

ment, or at the very least the introduction of
one, enough to placate graduate student ire,
or desire, as the case may be?
(Speaking through his right hand man,
Rex, in a high, whiny voice) "We graduate stu
dents are fed up with the lack of housing.
We're fed up with having to cook our own
meals. We're fed up with getting paid to be
here while undergraduates have to pay
$30,000 a year only to be taught by US, their
graduate TAs! And we're wild with sexual
frustration!!!" (Rex is shaking and being
tossed wildly about as Nichols struggles to
vocalize Rex's speech without moving his
own lips.)
Yowzers! The graduate students seem to
have just gained the upper hand by capturing
one of the undergraduate leaders, Aimer
"Genghis" Khan! "You khannot do it!" he
seems to be screaming. "Why khan you not
be satisfied with your lot?! Why khan we not
live in peace?! Why khan we not settle this
over a game of Khandy Land??!!!"
Things look bleak here on East Campus,
but on the West Side, the Story seems to be
quite different.
Graduate rebels have not yet left the coun
try western confines of Lyman. Word has it
that as soon as they open their windows they
are Blinded by the Light emanating from the
tennis courts and the driving range, leaving
them unsure of just how many undergrad
defensive forces are outside.
For now, it seems that All is Quiet on the
Western Front.
We will get back to you as circumstances
will undoubtedly change.
