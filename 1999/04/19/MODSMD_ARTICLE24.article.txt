Although Provost Condoleezza Rice will he
leaving Stanford to pursue things outside of
Stanford, the Stanford student body has gra
ciously decided to award her a special fee in
the amount of $30,801. A favorite here at
Stanford, Provost Rice, affectionately known
as "Condi," ran for and won a special fee
under the title "Stanford Solar Car Project." A
big Stanford "Yahoo!" for Condi! Co get 'em,
Slugger!
In a related story, two Stanford students,
Mo Khan and Aimer Khan, visited Rice in her

office on Friday afternoon, presenting her
with, what Rice called,"the most unique peti
tion I've received in my years at this fine insti
tution." The two students wrote and signed a
letter asking Rice to change her name to
"Khandoleezza." Provost Rice was flattered
but her "upcoming change of address is going
to be hard enough. Think of the confusion
that a name change would generate!"
They did receive permission for The
Daily, though, to refer to Provost Rice as
"Khandi" until her time here at Stanford is
over.
