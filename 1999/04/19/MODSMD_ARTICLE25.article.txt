# HEY GUYS, WE ENDORSE YOU!
## 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
Last week you all voted for the organiza
tions that you felt deserved the most
money in the ASSU elections. In the polit
ically correct atmosphere of Stanford,
many worthy causes get lost in the shuffle.
We are here to represent the minority
groups on campus that couldn't even get a
penny out of your stiff wallets. We are the
champions of mediocity. Hopefully, after
this article is printed and we both go on
hunger strikes during midnight vigils in
White Plaza, you will come to your senses
and realize that the following groups make
Stanford great:
YOUNG BODIES FOR HIRE (YBFH)
This fledging group ironically began at
Stanford in 1969 under the auspicious
guise of "San Francisco Prostitutes at
Stanford." Since then, it has spread like an
eagle, dropping its seeds across campus,
and even managing to erect its very own

office on campus in the Women's
Center. There, prostitutes have free
reign over all office equipment
including copier machines, staplers
and scissors. Some of them have
been T.A.'s in Human Sexuality.
Notes aren't the only things stu
dents are studying in that class.
Over the past three decades, YBFH
has enabled bright young students
to get the to head of their classes.
Financial Request: $20,000 for
condoms, Lee press on nails, wigs,
douches, dildos, massage oils, lube
and whips.

THE STANFORD CHILD ACTORS

Headed up by that kid who was
"Zack the Lego maniac," SCA offers
a wide variety of activities for any
one who ever acted on television.

Exciting programs include visiting
friends in prison, smoking a lot of

dope and remebering the good old days
when there was work.
Financial Request: an agent, a terrific
movie script or anything (we'll even do

"Thighrnaster" infomercials!).
THE BRONSON PINCHOT FAN CLUB
Remember Balky from "Perfect
Strangers"? This group sure does. Activities
include nightly viewings of the hit series,
"Blame it on the Bellboy," "Meego,"
"Beverly Hills Cop Trilogy" and"The
Golden Child." For seven years the group
has tried to get Pinchot to speak at
Stanford, but his schedule has always been
"too busy." Will this celeb ever visit the
Farm? It's up to you.
Financial Request: A role in any film for
Mr. Pinchot. Please send us your scripts!
STRANGE MAN WHO PROTESTS IN
WHITE PLAZA SHOUTING OBSCENITIES
Come into his world. Understand him.
Domesticate him. Learn why he shouts
"BILE." We are positive that there is a legit
imate reason. And this group is dedicated
to finding out just what that is. We have
been housing him in our dorm room for

the past two weeks. He no longer bites.
Financial Request: Money to clean the
carpeting and fumigate the room.
THE MOLE HYMEN BREAKERS

Few people know that the mole has a
hymen that is as tough as leather. To pene
trate it, the male mole must chase the
female mole until he corners her up
against a wall and jams himself into her
repeatedly. Only the toughest moles break
the boundaries. Be there to see one of

nature's incredible wonders.
Financial Request: $10,000
THE STANFORD INVESTMENT
BANKERS OF TOMORROW
This group is responsible for the
merging and acquisitioning of all of
the above-mentioned groups. Itwill
work with students 120 hours a
week, being paid absolutely nothing.
Past efforts have included "The
Condoleezza Rice and Robert
Warrior Wedding" and"The
Feminist Studies / Sigma Chi Co
op"
Spread Request: 7 percent.
