# Bullpen gives up 13 runs yesterday in less than five innings
## Baseball drops two to USC 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
With a tidy 9-2 lead after four innings yesterday, sec
ond-ranked Stanford seemed ready to take the game and
the weekend series from No. 24 USC.
Stanford freshman Brian Sager had just struck out the
side in the top of the fourth, and the Cardinal had been
scoring runs at will. Stanford seemed ready to take a two
game lead over the Trojans in the Pacific 10 Conference
standings.

BASEBALL

■ Sunday: No. 24 USC (26-18. 12-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) 17, No. 2 Stanford (27-11, 12-3) 15.

■ Saturday: Stanford 13, USC 2.
■ Friday: USC 10, Stanford 1.

However, with a record crowd looking on at Sunken
Diamond, USC proceeded to drive Sager from the game,
pound nearly every Cardinal reliever and win the
volatile, dramatic game 17-15 to tie Stanford for first
place in the league.
"We needed to win this game," Sager said. "It's really
disappointing that we didn't. But that's a part of baseball.
We just have to play hard and hope things work out for
us."
Sunday's game started out lopsided like Friday's 10-1
USC' win and Saturday's 13-2 Stanford victory, but quick
ly became a "heavyweight slugfest," said USC head
coach Mike Gillespie. The Trojans put together an eight
run fifth inning, capped by a grand slam from freshman
catcher Beau Craig, to take the lead and then scored
seven runs in the last two innings to hold off any Stanford
charge.
The game, which lasted more than four hours, seemed
as it it would never end. Each team took the other's best
punch and came back swinging when it went to the plate.

Sophomore Joe Borchard takes a cut during the Stanford baseball team's win over
USC on Saturday at Sunken Diamond. Borchard and his teammates, though, couldn't
muster the hits to put the Trojans away for the series, dropping two of three games this
weekend to — and falling into a first-place tie with — the men from Southern Califor
nia.
The teams combined for 41 hits, in
cluding seven home runs and nine
doubles, and 32 runs — bringing 12
pitchers to the mound.
Though Stanford lost its Pac-10
lead to USC, it still appears that the
Cardinal has the edge heading into
the final nine games of league play.
USC must travel to Arizona State,
one of the league's better teams, and
faces third-place Washington and
surging UCLA. Stanford must also
play UCLA, but its other six games
are against last-place Oregon State
and under-performing California.
However, as UCLA's sweep of
Arizona State this weekend demon
strates, most teams in the Pac-10 can
not be taken for granted.
"There's no easy weekend in this
league," Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess said. "If you don't play well on
any given weekend, you will get beat.
We've still got a long way to go."
Most of the damage yesterday
came at the expense of the Cardinal
bullpen. Marquess used six relievers
and none did the job, save freshmen
Mike Gosling, who faced only one
batter in a situational role. Com
bined, the bullpen allowed 13 runs in
only four and two-thirds innings.
Even Stanford's stopper, senior
left-hander Tony Cogan, who en
tered the game with a 1.77 ERA.
looked hittable. After breezing

through the sixth and seventh in
nings, Cogan gave up a home run and
three straight doubles to hand the
lead back to the Trojans.
For Stanford, sophomore right
fielder Joe Borchard continued his
stellar play by going 5 for 6, including
two deep home runs, and by driving
in seven runs. He is now hitting .399
with eight home runs and 36 RBls.
'Tm just trying to put the ball in
play and to produce runs so we can
win ballgames," he said. "I'm not
doing anything special."
The teams traded blowouts in the
first two games to set up Sundays
crucial contest.
Friday evening USC (26-18. 12-3
Pac-10) fed off the dominant pitching
of junior Barry Zito and the fourth
inning ejection of head coach Mike
Gillespie to cruise to a 10-1 win and a
short-lived tie for the Pac-10 lead.
Saturday afternoon, Stanford
turned the tables on the Trojans by
riding the complete-game pitching of
sophomore Justin Wayne to a lop
sided 13-2 victory.
The right-hander allowed only
two runs on four hits while striking
out a career-high 14 batters.
"He's pitched really well for us the
last three weeks," Marquess said.
"Today, he was exceptional for us.
He had a good fastball, a great slider,
he had good control of all of them
and he got stronger as he went
along."
