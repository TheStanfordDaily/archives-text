# Bullpen gives up 13 runs yesterday in less than five innings
## Baseball drops two to USC 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
With a tidy 9-2 lead after four innings yesterday, sec
ond-ranked Stanford seemed ready to take the game and
the weekend series from No. 24 USC.
Stanford freshman Brian Sager had just struck out the
side in the top of the fourth, and the Cardinal had been
scoring runs at will. Stanford seemed ready to take a two
game lead over the Trojans in the Pacific 10 Conference
standings.

BASEBALL

■ Sunday: No. 24 USC (26-18. 12-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) 17, No. 2 Stanford (27-11, 12-3) 15.

■ Saturday: Stanford 13, USC 2.
■ Friday: USC 10, Stanford 1.

However, with a record crowd looking on at Sunken
Diamond, USC proceeded to drive Sager from the game,
pound nearly every Cardinal reliever and win the
volatile, dramatic game 17-15 to tie Stanford for first
place in the league.
"We needed to win this game," Sager said. "It's really
disappointing that we didn't. But that's a part of baseball.
We just have to play hard and hope things work out for
us."
Sunday's game started out lopsided like Friday's 10-1
USC' win and Saturday's 13-2 Stanford victory, but quick
ly became a "heavyweight slugfest," said USC head
coach Mike Gillespie. The Trojans put together an eight
run fifth inning, capped by a grand slam from freshman
catcher Beau Craig, to take the lead and then scored
seven runs in the last two innings to hold off any Stanford
charge.
The game, which lasted more than four hours, seemed
as it it would never end. Each team took the other's best
punch and came back swinging when it went to the plate.

USC on Saturday at Sunken Diamond. Borchard and his teammates, though, couldn't
muster the hits to put the Trojans away for the series, dropping two of three games this
weekend to — and falling into a first-place tie with — the men from Southern Califor
