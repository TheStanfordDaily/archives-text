After an introduction by Brown, Winfrey discussed
the importance of spirituality in her life, interspersed with
comical stories of her hair falling out due to a "French

depending on men when "1 belonged to the 'Call Me A
Fool Club.'"
She said that her success is due to the fact that she is ful
filling her God-given mission in life and that "I have al
lowed myself to connect to the higher spirit.

"I don't know the future, but I know who holds the fu

self than you can.
"Each of us is meant to be a phenomenal woman," she
added.
Two younger speakers addressed topics of concern to
college-age women, such as abortion and student mental
health.
Chela Delgado, an Oakland high school student who
teaches abstinence-based sex education, addressed the
generation gap regarding abortion rights. She said that
today's sexism, such as "pimps on a pop culture pedestal,"
is too subtle to rally around. As a result, today's young
women believe that feminist issues are unimportant.
"After years of struggle, feminism means nothing or else
is a social faux pas," she said.
"Because of my great-grandmother. I can vote, work
and have control of my body." Delgado said. "Because of
my mother, I can take these rights for granted."
Winnie Hui Min Yu, a 20-year-old human rights advo
cate,spoke of the need forschools to be conscious of men
tal health issues. She remembered that teachers loved
talking to her when she was doing well. However, when
she was lighting depression, teachers became suspicious
of her absences. Yu said that schools need to pay more at
tention to the mental health of all students whether those
students are succeeding or not.
