## 
### Jad Fakhry Contributing writer 
San Jose State University Jour
nalism Prof. Harvey Gotliffe dis
cussed Holocaust deniers and their
advertisements Friday.
Speaking to a Tresidder audience
of 25. including Hillel interns and
Hillel Rabbi Yoel Kahn, Gotliffe
addressed the college newspaper
advertisements authored bv
Bradley Smith. Smith is the founder
and head of the Committee for the
Open Debate of the Holocaust,
which argues that accounts of the

Holocaust are inflated to win sym
pathy for Jews.
"Every historical controversy
can be debated on national televi
sion except one â€” the Jewish holo
caust story. Why?" asked Smith's
latest ad.
Smith has published several ad
vertisements in campus newspapers
nationwide, stirring up debate and
publicity. The Daily ran such an ad
vertisement on Oct. 1.1998, and fol
lowed up with several front-page ar
ticles that addressed its decision.
Smith's advertisement offered a
reward for any person who sets up a

90-minute televised debate between
him and the Anti-Defamation
League.
Current Editor in Chief Jim
Tankersley said he would not run a
similar advertisement if approached.
On October 26. 1993, Rajiv
Chandrasekaran. then-editor in
chief of The Daily, rejected Smith's
advertisements with an explanatory
editorial.
"These ads have caused tremen
dous tumuli, and I urge you to speak
to editors of The Daily about these
ads to warn them about printing the
ads again," Gotliffe said. He noted
that the sizable Jewish community at
Northwestern University was out
raged by Smith's advertisement that
ran in the school's newspaper.
Gotliffe explained that the adver
tisements "have snuck by," and that
it is integral that college students
learn more about the Holocaust.
Armed with the facts they absorbed,
students can reject Smith's publicity,
Gotliffe said.
"The problem is that at many uni
versity papers, like Stanford's, the
business manager has the final say in
running ads," Gotliffe said. He wor
ries that many business managers
would run any advertisement as long
as they receive the payment for it.
At The Daily, the editor in chief
has final say on the publication of ad
vertisements.
"Do you give Bradley Smith pub
licity?" asked Gotliffe, questioning

whether public debate merely gen
erates attention for such viewpoints.
Gotliffe has written for years on
Smith's ads and concluded that
"Smith and his views must be ex
posed."
Gotliffe noted that Smith admits
to having little educational back
ground. When people understand
this fact, Gotliffe hopes they will do
their own research and realize the
horror of the Holocaust.
He explained several times that
many remain uninformed about the
Holocaust. "People just don't ques
tion [the advertisement]; that's the
problem," said Gotliffe.
For this reason school newspa
pers must have an open debate be
fore running Smith's advertisements,
Gotliffe explained.
"If you're going to run his ads, do
some good journalistic investiga
tion," Gotliffe advised.
Gotliffe also emphasized that
"you should know your enemy." He
urged others to visit Smith's World
Wide Web site and assess his philos
ophy.
