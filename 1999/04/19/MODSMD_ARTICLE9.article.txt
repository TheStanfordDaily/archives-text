## NATO continues unrelenting strikes 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) —NATO
launched its most active day of airstrikes yester
day in its assault on Yugoslavia, pummeling
refineries, bridges and dozens of other targets in
what it claimed were "highly successful" opera
tions.
But the refugee crisis only deepened on the
25th straight day of attacks aimed at making
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic halt his
offensive in Kosovo and agree to a political set
tlement for the Serbian province.
Ethnic Albanians continued to pour out of
Kosovo at Ihe rate of a thousand an hour, bring
ing Serb forces closer to emptying the province
of its ethnic Albanian majority. An estimated
40.000 refugees either left Kosovo for neighbor
ing territory over the weekend or were at its bor

tiers preparing to leave, international officials
said.
NAIO also raised evidence of what it said
were 43 mass grave sites in Kosovo — some dug
by groups of Kosovo Albanians rounded up by
Serb forces to hury their countrymen.
The alliance's jets flew more than 500 mis
sions in the 24-hour period ending yesterday
afternoon — a total that a NATO military
spokesman said was the highest daily total yet.
NAIO pilots struck sites across Serbia and its
Kosovo province, where they reported seeing
smoke rising from burning villages.
NATO forces will soon be bolstered by 24
U.S. Apache anti-tank helicopter gunships,
intended to target the Yugoslav army and spe
cial police forces accused of repressing Kosovo

Albanians. NATO said the first Apaches were
expected in Albania from Italy today, although
an Albanian military source said yesterday that
several had already arrived elsewhere in the
country over the previous two days.
Reflecting tensions over the stepped-up mili
tary activity in Albania, Yugoslavia severed
diplomatic relations with its southern neighbor
yesterday, the Albanian Foreign Ministry said.
Despite growing calls for NATO to send in
ground troops. NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana insisted there were still no such plans.
But Solana said in a television interview with
the British Broadcasting Corp. that "if the
moment comes when (a ground force) is neces
sary. I'm sure the countries that belong to
NA TO will be ready to do it."
