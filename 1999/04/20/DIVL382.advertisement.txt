HIGH MARKS FROM
MORNINGSTAR, S&P, MOODY'S,
MONEY MAGAZINE AND BILL.
We take a lot of pride in gaining
high marks from the major rating
services. But the fact is. we're equally
proud of the ratings we get every day from
our participants. Because at TIAA-CREF,
ensuring the financial futures of the educa
tion and research community is something
that goes beyond stars and numbers.
We became the world's largest retire
ment organization by offering people a
wide range of sound investments, a
commitment to superior service, and
operating expenses that are among the
lowest in the insurance and mutual fund
industries* * *
With TIAA-CREF,you'll get the right
choices —and the dedication—to help you
achieve a lifetime of financial goals. The
leading experts agree. So does Bill.
TIAA-CREF can help you build a com
fortable, financially secure tomorrow, with
tax-deferred annuities, mutual funds, IR.As,
insurance and more.
To find out more, call us at 1 800 842-2776.
