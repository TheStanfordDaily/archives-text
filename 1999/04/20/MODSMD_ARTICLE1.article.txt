# Some profs. concerned by 'partisan' Hoover

National coverage of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's possible 2(XM)
presidential bid has included reports
on his exploratory committee —
which reads like a laundry list of cur
rent and past Hoover Institution fel
lows, including Provost Condoleezza
Rice.
The attention has raised long
standing issues regarding the institu
tion's relationship to the University,
as well as questions about the appro
priateness of cross-appointments be
tween the University and the institu
tion.
"Stanford's affiliation with the
Hoover Institution is again involving
the University in national politics,"
wrote Political Science Prof. John
Manley and English Prof. Ron Reb
holz in a recent letter to The Daily.
They urged the I Jniversity communi
ty to ask itself, "What are the costs,
not just the benefits, of deepening
and continuing [University] relations
with Hoover?"
"By way of the Hoover Institu
tion, Stanford is being associated
with partisan politics and it happens
to be conservative, but I don't want to
stand for its name [beingcited] on the
liberal side either. When it happens,
however, it always happens on the
conservative side, because it is
Hoover," Rebholz said.
Rice observed that the relation
ship between Hoover and the Bush
campaign may have less to do with a
general institutional stance than with
the fact that many of its fellows
served in the administration of
Bush's father. President Bush.
Gerald Dorfman, assistant direc
tor of the institution, was reluctant to

characterize the institution as conser
vative. He noted that in a recent tele
phone survey of fellows, the numbers
of self-identified Democrats and Re
publicans were fairly close.
Rice said that although the econo
mists at the institution generally uti
lize a "neoliberal market-oriented
approach that I guess you could call
conservative." she would be "loath to
try and characterize an institution. 1
think you have to look at the individ
uals."
If one does look at the individuals,
the institution's conservative label —
at least as the word is used in the
mainstream media — is relatively ac
curate. Many of the fellow's biogra
phies mention appointments in pre
vious Republican administrations.
Particularly telling are the three indi
viduals named as the institution's
honorary fellows — former Presi
dent Ronald Reagan. Russian author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn and former
British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
Perhaps more importantly, the
Hoover Institution is widely per
ceived to have a definite political
slant to the right. That "party line"
impression of the institution has con
tributed to questions about the many
cross-appointments between the in
stitution and University depart
ments. especially the departments of
economics and political science.
Rice, however, was unfazed by
the suggestion that cross-appoint
ments had any hint of impropriety.
"The deans and the faculty of those
departments think it is an acceptable
thing to do. There is a hierarchy ap
proving these appointments," she
said.
Rice also noted that the hiring
process "involves the advisory board.

which is an elected faculty body."
The skepticism about cross-ap
pointments may also have its roots in
the widely-held misconception that
the Hoover Institution is somehow
independent of the University, ex
cepting its on-campus location and
its library's status as part of the Stan

ford University Library system.
According to Rice, " line Univerrj
sity and the Hoover Insttttition hav#

the Hoover Library, but the rest of
