BELGRADE. Yugoslavia (AP) -
Yugoslavia slammed shut the main crossing
point for ethnic Albanian refugees tleeing
Kosovo, leaving uncertainty yesterday
about the fate of the tens of thousands
whom aid officials had believed were on
their way to the border.
NATO struck at a variety of sites on the
26th day of its air campaign, reportedly
including a government building in Serbia's
second-largest city and a television trans
mitter in Kosovo. But it said its operations
were limited by poor weather.
The bombings aim to force Serbian lead
ers to accept a peace plan for Kosovo, a
province in Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia. The plan includes 28,000
NATO-led troops to enforce it.

Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said yesterday he will go to
Moscow next week to discuss the Kosovo
conflict. Yugoslavia rejected the key ele
ment of Annan's Kosovo peace initiative
last week, saying an international military
force in Yugoslavia was unacceptable.
Refugee traffic from Kosovo into Alba
nia, Macedonia and Montenegro slowed to
a trickle yesterday. The U.N. refugee agen
cy said the Serbs apparently were turning
back the refugees.
"It all sounds fairly ominous and we
don't know to what end they're doing it."
said Kris Janowski. spokesman for the LJ.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees in Gene
va.
Albanian soldiers swarmed around the

Morini border station — the main entry
point into Albania — and ordered reporters
away. International monitors reported day
time shelling along the border, one day after
Yugoslavia broke off diplomatic relations
with Albania.
I'he majority of Kosovo Albanians who
have lied or been forced out of the Serbian
province since NATO airstrikes began
March 24 have come to Albania — 365.000
of more than 600,(HX). Over the weekend, an
estimated 40.(XX) either left Kosovo for
neighboring territories or were at its bor
ders. aid officials said.
"It's very clear that there are large num
bers of more people who would like to
come," IJNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghe
dini said in Macedonia.
