We applaud recent
choices for top
University posts

THE RECENT appointments
of Robert Joss and John Hen
nessy are strong indicators of
the cardinal direction in which the
University is headed.
They are also exemplary choices
for their new administrative posts,
and both men's stated goals appear to
be consistent with the current direc
tion of the University. Neither should
be expected to make drastic, sweep
ing changes to Stanford.
Moth men fit perfectly into the
Stanford mold, with each already
having significant experience in man
agement and with the University.
Both are also in tune with the role
Stanford has taken on as the center of
Silicon Valley and a leader in the use
of high technology for education.
Hennessy, the current dean of the
School of Engineering, oversaw the
creation of the University's first
online degree program and identified
his goal as "using technology to
enhance the classroom experience."
The appointments of Joss and 1 len
nessy would suggest that Stanford is
heading toward classrooms with more
technology and administrators with
more industry experience.
Named the dean of the Graduate
School of Business and University
provost respectively, the two men
share several biographical details in
common, most notably strong corpo

rate backgrounds.
Hennessy's credentials are impres
sive; as a pioneer of RISC (reduced
instruction set computer) and a
founder of MIPS Technologies, he
personifies what would seem to be
Stanford's ideal engineering profes
sor.
Joss has had similar success since
leaving the Business School in 1970,
serving in prominent positions in
more than one bank internationally
and in the U.S. government.
'I"he most notable departure from
tradition in the University's recent
appointments is the elevation of Hen
nessy, an engineer, to the level of
provost, a position that is typically
filled by someone from the School of
I lumanities and Sciences.
By breaking custom in this man
ner, the University has taken a posi
tive step toward including the
school's burgeoning School of Engi
neering in campus-wide administra
tion.
Described by Business School pro
lessor and search committee leader
Charles Holloway as "basically an
intellectual at heart," Joss joins a line
of Business School deans who have
come to Stanford with significant
grounding in both the business and
academic worlds.
We believe that both Joss and Hen
nessy will serve admirably in their
respective administrative posts and
will be able to enact positive change
along the lines of their current stated
goals.
We applaud the University's
appointments.
