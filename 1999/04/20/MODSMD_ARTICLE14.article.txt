# Sprinkle cool patience
## Resolving major dilemmas 
### 
Atiba Pertilla

BACK IN February,
my mother came
out to visit me for
the first time since drop
ping me off at Stanford
three years ago, when we
had wandered around
campus in confusion.

barely able to distinguish Mem Aud from
Mem Chu and the Co Ho from the Co Po.
Eager to show off the mastery of campus
geography gained over 10 (now 11) bike
less quarters, I took my mom up the Row
and back, down to Tresidder and Toyon
and finally wound up the tour at the Histo
ry Corner.
My eagerness to show off the building
where I spend so much of my time didn't
entirely make sense to me, even while we
were there (though my mother did admire
the wrought-iron staircase). It was the mid
dle of the day, when most of the rooms are
occupied with 110-minute seminars, and
only three or four professors wandered past
while we stood in the lobby. Of course it
was obvious that behind all the closed
doors, knowledge was being imparted and
shared, but history classes tend to produce
little evidence of the debates within, the
doors and walls being comparatively thiek,
and after a few moments of considering the
silent stairwell, we left.
"Did you know any of those profes
sors?" my mother asked as we emerged
into the bright winter day. I admitted that I
did, that I had taken classes from most of
them and that 1 was just getting to the point
where 1 was bold enough to start a conver
sation whenever I bumped into one but
that today had not been one of those days.

All the same, 1 feel a deep attachment to
my department, though it's been an unusu
al trip from my initial hesitance to declare
(it turned out to be a three-month process)
to the identification I feel today. Originally,
1 thought I would major in something inter
disciplinary, until I realized that such pro
grams are often underfunded and have no
place to call their own — or if they do, are
likely to be forced to move in two years.
I like, instead, having a building to call
my own that I've come to know well, from
the high-ceilinged seminar rooms on the
first floor to the lounge tucked away in the
eaves. I like the offices, too, which are
inevitably stuffed with books — on shelves
lining the walls, piled in chairs, scattered at
the feet of the professors who occupy them.
I've eoncluded that historians with unlimit
ed library privileges are prone to a curious
form of intellectual optimism — the con
viction that, over time, their capacity to
absorb new minutiae in their field will
never outstrip their patience for plowing
through other people's research.
There's no guarantee that declaring a
major is a sign of true devotion to a field of
academic endeavor, as the people who
rushed to declare economics last spring
freely admit.
But I've come to love history, thanks to
the discovery that I can actually do it myself
— hunt down articles in the depths of
South Mezzanine, translate documents
using what remains of my high school
French, write term paper outlines linking
theories across continents and centuries,
color-code my notes, pick a font that seems
to go well with the era I'm writing about,
re-alphabetize my bibliography ... some of

these are more practical techniques than
others.
Many others I know have found this
same satisfaction in their majors and,
though it's a rare moment when the con
versation suddenly revolves around thesis
topics, we're all aware of the highs and lows
of being part of an academic community.
Yet as we grow more and more excited
about what we're doing it becomes harder
and harder to explain to other people why
they should care.
The question of whether Stanford stu
dents are intellectual "enough" seems to be
bandied about on every level from the
Board of Trustees to the halls of West Flo
Mo.
Everything I've seen suggests that we're
capable of both incredible academic
achievements and incredible parochialism.
The dilemma seems to be how to achieve
two aims that seem equally worthwhile —
to have both depth in one's chosen field
and breadth enough to understand the fun
damentals of other disciplines.
My love for the History Corner aside, 1
would argue that our best chance to bridge
the legendary fuzzy-techie divide, and
those other fissures within our schools and
departments, seems to lie in those interdis
ciplinary programs that try to develop new
ways of looking at the world that allow us
to move back and forth between these two
ideals.
With sustained support, perhaps future
students won't feel forced to turn their
backs on those programs as I once did.

Atiba Pertilla, a senior, thinks 60 units is a
perfectly reasonable amount for a major.
