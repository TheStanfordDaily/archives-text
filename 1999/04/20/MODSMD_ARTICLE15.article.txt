Global warming analysis should go beyond pure economics

Recent issues of The Daily have pub
lished letters on the topic of the economic
and environmental consequences of global
warming. The debate was instigated by a
letter from Thomas Gale Moore outlining
the economic effects of the Kyoto Protocol.
Several issues were raised during the ensu
ing debate, but some fundamental aspects
of Moore's original letter have not been
investigated. I feel that these need to be
addressed.
Moore's arguments against the Kyoto
Protocol are apparently based solely on
economic analysis. No matter whether I
agree with the economic scenario presented
by Moore. I find it difficult to agree that this
should be the sole indicator of our actions.

The fact that economists "conclude that
(the effect of global warming) would be
very modest" does little to answer questions
about the actual effect of such global cli
mate change to life on this planet. Certain
ly. the economic effects of implementing the
Kyoto Protocol should be considered, but
to make exclusive use of economic argu
ments is inappropriate. Furthermore, the
economic analysis upon which Moore bases
his arguments specifically relate to the pre
dicted effect on the United States. If we are
to consider the economic effects of global
warming, it would seem appropriate to con
sider global economic consequences rather
than simply focusing on one of the world's
most privileged nations.

Moore also raises the issue that a warm
ing of the U.S. climate might actually save
lives. He suggests that -about 40,(XX) lives
could be saved annually in the U.S. (and
17,(MX) in England and Wales) by a slight
warming of the overall climate. Even if we
could agree that this might actually be real
istic, what would happen in the rest of the
world with a similar climate change? Africa,
for example, would likely suffer terribly
from even a modest increase in its average
temperature. Additionally, severe meteoro
logical changes are considered likely in the
event of moderate average temperature
increases. The situation is not as simple as
thinking that Minnesota might benefit from
having slightly milder winters.

The issue of global climate change due to
gradual warming of the atmosphere cannot
he addressed simply by investigating eco
nomic indicators in one part of the world.
Unfortunately, this seems to be what has
been done by Thomas Moore. To ensure
proper decision-making on this complex
issue, a broader range of global indicators
must be considered. The Kyoto Protocol,
although far from perfect in many respects,
does provide the world's nations with a for
mal blueprint from which we can begin a
continuing dialogue to ensure sustainable
human endeavor on our planet.
