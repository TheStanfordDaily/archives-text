## Don't drive drowsy, it could save your life 
### 
EVERY 11ME 1 hear that a promis
ing young person has died prema
turely, I wonder how much our
luture has been diminished. Because of my
particular professional interest, almost
every day brings news of yet another young
life snuffed out. Not by an incurable illness,
or by a natural catastrophe or in heroic bat
tle. Rather, by the totally wasteful and
unnecessary act of falling asleep at the
wheel.
Perhaps today's most frequent cause of
premature death or disability among our
young people is an unintended sleep
episode or drowsy inattention in a situation
where sustained alertness and survival are
synonymous. Several studies have found
that more than half of all fall-asleep auto
mobile crashes involve people 25 years or
younger, and the peak age of occurrence is
20. The 1999 National Sleep Foundation
Poll, Sleep in America, found that severe
drowsiness interfered with the daily activi
ties of 40 percent of all adults (18 years of
age and older). Twenty-three percent of all
adults said they knew someone who had
been involved in an automobile accident

because of falling asleep at the wheel. This
translates to an astounding 45 million crash
es in the past year caused by impaired alert
ness due to sleep deprivation.
After years of laboratory research on
sleep deprivation and investigating the role
of impaired alertness in accidents, 1 now
regard falling asleep at the wheel as com
pletely preventable. The paramount piece
of knowledge that everyone must master is
that drowsiness can become sleep in an
instant. Once our eyelids start feeling heavy,
we are only a few seconds from sleep. Many
Stanford students are familiar with the cliffs
overlooking the Pacific Ocean 30 miles to
the west. Every once in a while, someone
ignores the warning signs and walks along
the cliff edge. A person may step carefully,
but without warning, the soil gives out from
under her feet and she plunges to the rocks
below. Likewise, too many young people
think they know exactly when they are in
danger of falling asleep and that they can
safely skirt the abyss. Hut when wakefulness
suddenly slides out from underneath them,
they are powerless to save themselves.
Often while we are driving we are sud

denly drowsy and can hardly keep our eyes
open. Students who are uninformed assume
the drowsiness is caused by boredom and
can be easily held at bay. An alarming 85
percent say they would keep driving even
though drowsy. This is why driving acci
dents are the number one cause of death
and disability in this age bracket. Students
who have become knowledgeable (Sleep
and Dreams alumni) understand that the
only cause of daytime drowsiness is sleep
deprivation. They know that all lost sleep
accumulates as a debt which can become
dangerously large. Much more important,
all but a tiny minority of Sleep and Dreams
alumni say they will now and, I hope, forev
er heed the class mantra "drowsiness is red
alert" and immediately get out of harm's
way.
I believe that understanding sleep depri
vation and its negative consequences is one
of the most important things everyone must
learn. All lost sleep accumulates as a debt.
This sleep debt does not go away. As an
individual fails to get enough sleep night
after night, the sleep debt gets larger and
larger. Throughout the day. his or her brain

tries harder and harder to fall asleep. To
cope with this increasing tendency, the pos
sessor of a large sleep debt adds more and
more external stimulation primarily in the
form of caffeine and physical activity to
stave off drowsiness. This means that it the
debtor relaxes only a little and drowsiness
gets a toehold, sleep can instantly seize the
brain. The first inkling of feeling drowsy
may give only two or three seconds of warn
ing to save our lives. If the warning is not
heeded while driving or in any other haz
ardous situation, the sleep seizure is more
often than not fatal.
Managing one's individual sleep debt in
the high-pressure Stanford University
undergraduate environment is a real chal
lenge and often seemingly impossible. It is
particularly difficult until a student has
experienced the miracle of sustained day
time alertness and peak performance that
accompanies a major reduction of sleep
indebtedness. At this point, a commitment
to healthy sleep will be made, and the risk of
a sleep-related accident will decrease. Until
that time, the mantra of Sleep and Dreams
is intended to keep our promising students

alive. Drowsiness is Red Alert! Drowsiness
is the signal that sleep onset is seconds
away. Drowsiness is the signal to get off the
road. Drowsiness is the signal to save your
life.
My class. Sleep and Dreams, is filled with
a large group of promising young students
soon to enter the real world, to engage it
and perhaps to make it better. I hope I have
increased the likelihood that all my students
will live long enough to fulfill their promise.
My biggest regret in all this is that Sleep
and Dreams at Stanford is an island of
awareness in the vast sea of ignorance about
sleep that is our American society. After
students finish the Sleep and Dreams
course, they continue to send me many
accounts of drowsy driving tragedies. This
will continue until the knowledge and the
health and safety principles taught in Sleep
and Dreams are taught to all students every
where. 1 will keep striving as long as there is
breath within me to make this happen.
