### Mo Eger Contributing writer 
The N0.4 women's water polo
team (19-5) claimed a strong 4-1
win in its last home match of the
season last Friday against the No. 7
UC-Davis Aggies (21-8).
This was the first meeting of the
season for these two teams, and
Davis went into the match on a roll.

having lost only one of its last 17
games. Stanford had just lost its
previous two games in the semifi
nals and then the consolation finals
ot the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Championship.
With national qualifiers around
the corner, it was extremely impor
tant that the Cardinal come out
hard against the Aggies in this
match.

"I think people were tired and
still recovering from last weekend,"
said senior Nicole Glazer. "Be
cause we are looking toward quali
fiers and Nationals, we still had
hard practices all that week. Maybe
the game was not as fast-paced as
we would have liked, but people
still came out strong.

"Yes, we were sluggish in some
areas, hut we're getting ready for
this weekend and that is what real
ly counts," Glazer said.
Three minutes into the first
quarter, sophomore Kelly Shouey
scored on a man-up advantage
when a Davis player was ejected for
a 20-second power plav.
Shouey scored again in the sec
ond quarter from the two-meter
position and freshman Kate Pettit
scored on a pass from sophomore
Anne-Marie Keenan to give the
Cardinal a 3-0 lead before halftime.
Early in the third quarter, fresh
man Margie Dingeldein scored on
a counterattack set up by senior
goalie Heather Crary's beautiful
pool-long pass.
Crary had five saves in the last
home game of her career and al
most had a shutout. With three
minutes remaining in the third,
Aggie senior Alice Wallace scored
a shot from far out on the perime
ter, reducing the Aggies' deficit to
4-1.
In the fourth quarter, sopho
more Alii Henry took over the
goaltending responsibilities and
stopped Davis from scoring again.
For the seniors, maintaining
such control over this last home

game was not only exciting, but a
testament to what they have tried
to accomplish over the past four
years.
"I'm extremely proud of our se
niors. not only for their last home
game at Stanford but for the drive
and dedication that they have
shown all four years here," said ju

nior Elissa Keszler. "[Lindsay]
Tam, Nicole and Crarv have made
countless sacrifices for the benefit
of our team.
"Having that kind of a commit
ment for that long is not an easy
thing to do," Keszler said. "They
are three very special people, and
I'm thankful for the time I've spent

and played with them."
Both Davis and Stanford return
to the pool this weekend at the Cal
ifornia Regional Qualifying Tour
nament. Hosted by Pacific, the
tournament will feature six teams
who must compete for four spots in
the National Championship Tour
