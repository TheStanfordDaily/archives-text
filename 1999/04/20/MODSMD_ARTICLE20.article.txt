# Distance and Connolly set the pace
## No. 2 Stanford divides and shines 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Divide and conquer was the order of the week
end for No. 2 Stanford as the Cardinal split its
forces between the Mt. San Antonio College Re
lays, the Azusa Pacific Multi-Events and the
Pomona-Pitzer Invitational and came away with
big marks at all three.
The Mt. SAC meet proved to the be most pro
ductive of the three for Stanford, as Adam Connol
ly continued his hot streak with an eight-foot im
provement on his personal record in the hammer
throw and four athletes snared NCAA qualifying
marks in the S,(XX) meters.
Stanford's distance men had to put up quite a
fight to grab those marks, as muggy conditions and
an overcrowded race led to a slow tirst kilometer
filled with errant elbows and other minor physical
battles.
"The field was just gigantic," said Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna. "They were just clob
bering each other — it was one ot the most physi
cal races I've ever seen. Brad and Brent [Hauser]
were bouncinti all over the track."

Cruising through two miles in eight minutes, 50
seconds, only Nathan Nutter and Jason Balkman
had managed to avoid the mid-pack melee in
which the Mausers were entwined.
In the end. Balkman was the first of the Stan
ford five-kilometer crew to cross the line, 14th
overall and with a personal best of 13:44.87 sec
onds. and Brad I lauser was on his heels at 13:46.58
in 15th. Both were automatic qualifiers for the na
tional meet.
Following those two were Nutter at a personal
best 13:52.58 and Brent Hauser at 13:54.01, both
meeting the national provisional standard. Lanan
na said he thought the race could have gone much
faster, but was confident that Nutter and Brent
I lauser's marks w ill be strong enough to earn them
spots in the NCAa\ meet.
"It was a 13:25 field, but the outside factors
made the race go about 10 seconds slower than it
might have," said Lananna. "But I think all four of
our guys are line. It was a successful 5k."
Perhaps the most spectacular mark of the
weekend came from Connolly as he furthered his
personal best to 236 feet, 6 inches and continued
his season-long assault on the Stanford record of

240-10, set by Olympian Dave Popejoy.
Connolly's second-place throw ranks him at
third in the NCAA and first among competitors
from the United States. His throw this weekend
was just a few centimeters further than his father's
personal record in the hammer. The senior Con
nolly is a former world-record holder in the event.
"Adam is right on target," said Lananna. "His
goals and aspirations are pretty ambitious. He's
looking to compete at the world championship
level, and to do that, he needs to be throwing and
improving like he is right now."
Other top marks at Mt. SAC were posted by
Ryan Carroll in the 8(X) meters (1:49.35), Jake
Maas in the S(K) (1:50.04) and mile (4:03.52) and
Jon Weldon in the 1.5(H) meters (3:49.23). These
athletes all earned berths into the Pacific 10 Con
ference meet.
At the A/usa Pacific Multi-Events, the de
cathlon and heptathlon portion of the Mt. SAC
Relays, Stanford's Josh Gleason was unable to
complete his decathlon as he pulled a hamstring
and was forced to drop out.
Fortunately, senior Chase Wim
berly stepped up for the Cardinal
and posted a big personal record in
the event with 6,094 points. That
total may be enough to earn a spot in
the Pac-10 decathlon champi
onships.
The Pomona-Pitzer meet was a
success for the Cardinal as well.
Highlighting the event for the Cardi
nal was senior Jeff Allen's first-place
performance in the 400-meter hur

dles. His time of 50.29 marks a provi
sional qualifier for the NC'AAs.
Chad Wassink continued to
throw the javelin well, scoring a 204-
10 mark in the event, and freshmen
Ryan Meuse and Logan Taylor
stepped up to run 1:51.63 and 1:53.34
marks in the 800 meters, respective
ly.
All told, the Cardinal racked up
two automatic and three provisional
qualifiers for the June 2-5 NCAA
meet at Boise State. That brings
Stanford's total number of NCAA
qualifiers to 13 — eight automatic
bids and five provisional marks.
