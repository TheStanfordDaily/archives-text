# Records, qualifiers abound for Card
## 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
Great performances are com
monplace on the Stanford women s
track and field team, but they don t
come without tremendous efforts.
Yet this past weekend they were
automatic — at least tor two ( ardinal
women.
Both heptathlete Traeye Lawyer
and 3,000-meter runner Sally < ilynn
dipped under the NCAA automatic
qualifying standards in their respec
tive events at the Mt. San Antonio
College Relays in Walnut. In addi
tion, Jayna Smith and Robyn Wool
folk broke school records in the 400-
meter run and 100-meter hurdles, re
spectively. at the Pomona-Pitzer In
vitational, while Mary Cobb ran a
provisional qualifying time in the
5,000-meters at Mt. SAC.
Lawyer's efforts in the heptathlon
held at Azusa Pacific on Thursday
and Friday not only earned her first
place and an invitation to the

NCAAs, but her score of 5,771
points approached her own personal
best of 5,809 set last year when she
won the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship.
A strong performance in the high
jump on the first day of competition
set the stage for a run ;it her personal
best. Her 5-foot, 10 3/4-inch jump
also was a provisional qualifying
mark in the high jump.
"The main goal was to get auto
matic and I did that," Lawyer said.
"When I realized I was going to do
that, I was going for a [personal
record). But I didn't do as well as I
wanted to on the second day, espe
cially in the long jump."
Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na was not surprised with Lawyer's
performance, though she has recent
ly been plagued by injury, primarily a
knee injury stemming from the soc
cer season.
"Traeye Lawyer is a great com
petitor," Lananna said. "She is al
ways going to do well when it comes

down to a meet that counts for her...
I am confident she is going to score a
lot better by the end of the year."
On Friday night at the main site,
.Sally Glynn turned out the Cardi
nal's first automatic qualifier in a
track event this season. Coming off
All-America seasons in both cross
country and indoor track, Glynn's
seventh-place performance in a time
of nine minutes. 1 K. 4 seconds showed
that she is getting better and better
with time.
"I was particularly happy with the
automatic, mainly because it's my
first one," Cilvnn said. "There were a
few things that I wish I had done dif
ferently throughout my race, seeing
that it was quite crowded [with 40
competitors], but I can't be unhappy
with an automatic and a PR."
Lananna thinks that Glynn's
times are far from her potential.
"She had a big close — that's
what I would say was the best thing
about her race, but she can run
faster," Lananna said. "I'm pretty

confident that she can run quite a bit
faster.
"She fell back a bit after the mile,
but had a monstrous last 300 me
ters," Lannana said.
In the other featured distance
event for Stanford. Saturday's S,(XX)-
meter invitational race, senior Mary
Cobb finished 18th in 16:29.5, a pro
visional qualifying mark that will
likely get her into the national meet.
For Cobb, an All-American many
times over, the race was a strong
move in the direction of her old form
after missing last year's track sea
sons.
At the Pomona-Pitzer Invitation
al, sprinting was the focus. Two
school records fell as Jayna Smith ran
53.99 in the 4(X) meters and Robyn
Woolfolk ran 13.K6 in the 1(X) hur
dles.
"I would say that Jayna Smith
had the best performance [of the
weekend for Stanford]," Lananna
said.
I ler time of 53.W "is a big break
through for Jayna, and she can run
better and she will run better. She
was aggressive, tough and very, very
competitive. II she stays healthy,
she's going to have a big year," 1 ,an
nana said.

For Woolfolk, her time will hope
fully signal consistent sub-14-second
races. Both Smith's and Woolfolk's
times are Pac-1() qualifiers and
missed the NCAA provisional stan
dards by less than three-tenths of a
second.
In other events at Pomona. Wilsa
Charles bettered the Pac-10 stan
dard in both the 1(H)- and2(M)-meters,
while LaShawndra Pace did the
same in the NOO-meters.
