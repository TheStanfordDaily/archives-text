# Pac-10 field too much for golfers

Everyone from Martha Stew
art to Molly Manners will say it is
crucial to be a good host. When
having guests, it is imperative to
make sure they have a good time
first and worry about yourself
second.
This weekend, Arizona State
threw the etiquette book right
out the window and played the
role of the selfish host.
The Sun Devils ran away
from the field to capture the title
at the ASU Thunderbird / Sa
vane Invitational played Satur
day and Sunday on the Karsten
Course in Tempe, Ariz.

MEN'S GOLF
â–  Saturday-Sunday: No. 25 Stan
ford placed 15th at the ASU
Thunderbird Savanc Invitational.
Tempe. Ariz.

Stanford struggled through
the weekend, posting a total
score of 894 to finish tied for 15th
in the 17-team field.
Saturday, Arizona State
opened with rounds of 280 and
279 on its home course to take a
10-stroke lead over Pacific 10
Conference rival UCLA.
On Sunday, things just got
better for the Sun Devils. The
squad fired a 275 in perfect con
ditions to build a 17-stroke lead
over the Bruins and finish at 30-
under par 834.
Arizona State was led by Jeff
Ouinney, who added a blistering
10-under-par 62 in the final
round to rounds of 70 and 69 to
win the individual trophy at 15-
under. Quinney's final-round
score broke the course record
for competitive play of 65 as well
as the non-competitive record of
63 set by Phil Mickelson.
Jeff McGraw of UCLA card
ed three consecutive subpar

rounds to finish in second at 10-
under. Arizona State's Paul
Casey, UCLA's B.J. Schlagen
hauf and Arizona's Andy Barnes
rounded out the top five.
The favorable playing condi
tions contributed to the low
scores through much of the top
half of the field. Oregon's Ryan
Lavoie had actually broken the
competitive record with a final
round 64, but saw his name
erased from the record books in
a hurry by Quinney's effort, and
Cal's Robert Hamilton matched
the previous tournament record
with a 65 in the second round.
No one could quite compete
with the Sun Devils, though. In
the team standings, California.
Oregon and Arizona filled out
the top five, the only other
schools to finish below par.
The Cardinal, ranked 25th in
the nation entering this week's
play, carded rounds of 297, 298
and 299 to finish 60 strokes out of
the lead.
Stanford was again paced by
senior Joel Kribel. who fired
rounds of 70, 72 and 72 to finish
tied for 13th at two-under.
The rest of the Cardinal
squad could not master the par
-72, 7,027-vard Karsten layout.
The next lowest finishers were
Jimmy Lee and Alex Aragon,
who ended up in a tie at 12-over
(228).
Eric Dahlberg and Dusty
Brett also scored for the Cardi
nal at plus-13 and plus-14. re
spectively.
The results are somewhat dis
appointing for the Cardinal.
Apart from Stanford's play, the
squad must face all of the top
five teams in next week's Pac-10
Tournament at the Broadmoor
Golf Club in Seattle. The Cardi
nal must be able to fire consis
tently low scores to compete
with the conference's power
houses.
