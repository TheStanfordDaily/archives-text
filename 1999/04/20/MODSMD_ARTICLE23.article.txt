# Volleyball slumps in season finale
## 
### Colleen Shaw Editorial staff 
It was hardly a fairy-tale ending for the Stanford
men's volleyball team (10-12,7-11 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation). But then again, it wasn't ex
actly a fairy-tale season either.
Stanford's tumultuous year concluded last
weekend with two road losses as the Cardinal lost
15-3, 15-3, 15-9 on Friday to the third-ranked
UCLA Bruins (20-6, 14-5). The loss was followed
by a 15-8,13-15, 15-11, 15-9 defeat on Saturday bv
No. 10 UC-Irvine (14-10,11-8).
Injuries to several players this season, including
seniors Jeremy Bart and Chris Griffith, have limit
ed the availability of those leaders. These circum
stances, coupled with several key players leaving
the team, created a less-than-ideal environment for
a team with only two starting upperclassmen to
compete in the most competitive division of colle
giate volleyball.
But Stanford's attempts to adapt to these
changes weren't enough. For the first time in six
years, the Cardinal will not be one of the eight

teams competing in the MPSF tournament.
"In both games, we did not play well enough to
win," said sophomore middle blocker Dan Zhang.
"Against Irvine, we played with much more emo
tion and more pride. We battled more. Even
though we lost the game, we gave it all that we
had."

This effort could not stop Irvine, which sought
its first-ever MPSF Tournament berth. Cardinal
mistakes — including 28 service errors and nine
blocking errors—enabled the Anteaters to pull off
the victory in two hours, 38 minutes.
The first game — a marathon in which the Car
dinal used 47 rotations — epitomized these prob
lems. Stanford racked up 16 service errors and nine

blocking errors in this game alone.
Injury, which has been a persistent aspect of
Stanford's season, was also a factor in game one..
Junior Josh Palacios left the court after spraining
his ankle. Griffith, who has been out for most of the*
season recuperating from surgery, stepped in to fin-i
ish out the frame for Palacios. Palacios returned to!
the court in game two and played in spite of his in-!
jury for the rest of the match. The team adjusted to'
Palacios's condition by setting him only two balls'
the remainder of the match. Despite not being at
optimum physical strength, Palacios was a formi- 1
dable force, recording nine digs in the effort.
"We missed not having Josh in game one," said.
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves. "Game one.
was the longest game of the season, and the score!
does not indicate how hard of a battle it really was."
But Stanford did not need much time to recu-,
perate from the game. The Cardinal jumped out to
a 6-0 lead before the Anteaters tied the score and,
went ahead 12-9. Sophomore Brad Griffith en-;
tered the match and although some teammates'
were having difficulties with their
serves, he seemed immune to these
problems. He tied the seore at 12 be
fore senior outside hitter Patrick
Klein wrapped up the game with an
ace.
But this game was as close as the
Cardinal would come to winning its

final match of the season.
Klein, who has distinguished him
self with one of the strongest kill av
erages in the MPSF, recorded the
most kills (4()) of any player on the
court.
"Pat has carried a huge part of the
offense the entire season," Nieves
said. "He put in another great perfor
mance against Irvine."
Hut perhaps the most encouraging
sign for next season was the play of

the underclassmen. Setter Josh
Lukens recorded 84 assists in the ef
fort. Zhang recorded the highest hit
ting percentage of all players on the
court (.481) and was a part of seven of
the teams 14 blocks. Sophomore
middle blocker Brett Youngberg was
one dig short of a double-double with
20 kills and nine digs.
Freshman Marcus Skacel, who
stepped into a starting role late in the
season, contributed one of the best

performances of all players on the
court with 15 kills and .321 hitting per
centage.
"It has been exciting to watch
Marcus improve throughout the sea
son," Palacios said. "He has gained a
lot of experience and has shown some
of what he is capable of in the future."
With no postseason opportunities,
showing what it is capable of in the fu
ture is the only thing the Stanford
men's volleyball team can do.
