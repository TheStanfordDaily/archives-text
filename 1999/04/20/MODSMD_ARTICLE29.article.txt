# Sun Devils, Wildcats prove too much for Cardinal
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
A game of inches.
When home runs are robbed at
the fence, balls land on foul lines, and
a top-15 team returns home winless
from a conference weekend; it is diffi
cult to find words to explain the situa
tion.
However, the No. 10 Stanford
softball team (32-15, 4-10 Pacific 10
Conference) is not Icxiking to make
excuses for its losses.
"We haven't gotten the breaks,"
said Stanford head coach John
Rittman. "But we are not making the
breaks either."
On Friday, the Cardinal dropped
games 6-0 and 1-0 to No. 7 Arizona
State (34-14, 5-9 Fac 10), and Satur
day it suffered two more losses to No.
3 Arizona (37-9,9-5), 3-2 and 2-0.
As has become a trend, the Cardi
nal was in every game and simply un
able to come out on top in the end.
"We're playing right with teams
hut can't pull out the one-run games,"
said senior pitcher Marcy Crouch.
Although game one of the week
end against ASI J saw Stanford lose 6-
0, the Cardinal had ample opportuni
ty to put itself back in the game.
However, the team stranded eight
runners on base in the first five in
nings.
"They executed and had key hits
and we didn't," Rittman said.
The Sun Devils used 10 hits to
score its runs, while the Cardinal was
unable to score a single run off its five

hits. Freshman Erica Beach led the
way for ASU with a home-run and
one run scored, while four other Sun
Devils had doubles in the game.
Crouch (18-7) suffered the loss for
the Cardinal while freshman Kirsten
Voak (19-6) recorded the win. Voak
also recorded her 200 th strikeout of
the season in the game.
The Cardinal refused to become
discouraged after the first defeat and
held the Sun Devils scoreless through
seven innings in game two.
The Cardinal, however, was held
scoreless as well and the game pro
ceeded into extra innings.
In the bottom of the eighth, senior
Holly Smith reached third base on a
routine fly ball that was misplayed
and landed in right field. The follow
ing batter, freshman Missy Hixon, hit
a chopper between shortstop and sec
ond base to score Smith and give the
Sun Devils the victory and the sweep.
But Rittman was quick to see the
loss as a whole team defeat, not just
the result of one error.
"We had plenty of opportunities
to score and we couldn't come up
with the clutch hit," Rittman said.
Both pitchers only allowed three
hits in eight innings, and Beach (13-7)
emerged victorious while senior
Becky Blevins (14-8) recorded the
loss. This was a strong performance
for Blevins, who is returning to form
after an injury earlier this season.
Despite the disappointing ending
to Friday's doubleheader, the Cardi
nal came out spirited again on Satur
day.

"The girls kept their attitudes up
and had the opportunity to win both
games," Rittman said. "I can't say
enough about the team not giving up
or getting down on themselves."
In game one, Stanford outhit the
Wildcats 8-6, but Arizona took the
game in the bottom of the seventh on
an unearned run.

■ Friday: GAME 1 — No. 7 Arizona

GAME 2 — Arizona State 1, Stan

The run materialized as freshman
Jennie Finch led off with a single and
then advanced to second on a Stan
ford error. One batter later, freshman
Nicole Giordano slapped a single to
left field to bring in the game-winning
run.
Stanford left the bases loaded in
the top of the seventh, but Arizona
got a force out at home and Stanford
was unable to score.
The Cardinal scored first, taking a
2-0 lead in the fourth on a combina
tion of hits and Wildcat errors. The
inning began as freshman Jessica
Mendoza singled and freshman Sara
Beeson walked. Stanford loaded the

bases as Finch was late in attempting
a force out at second base on fresh
man Robin Walker's ground ball.
Crouch then grounded out to bring a
run home, and another run scored as
Finch unsuccessfully attempted to
throw back to third base.
Arizona tied the game in the bot
tom of the fifth inning, and it re
mained tied until the bottom of the
seventh.
Game two saw Finch shut out the
Cardinal and hold the team to only
five hits. Finch also added salt to the
wound with an insurance solo home
run in the sixth.
But despite the disappointing
record left in the book, the women
are looking to take some positive out
of the weekend.
"This weekend, we didn't get frus
trated, and that is an improvement,"
said senior Michelle Schneider. "We
know we are right there."
The first refocusing step for the
Cardinal is its doubleheader today
against San Jose State (8-23).
"These are two important games
to get back on track," Rittman said.
"It is a rivalry, and they will be up to
play us."
Atop the charts for the Spartans is
Nicole Phillips, batting .313, while
Sabrina Quintero holds the lowest
ERA for a starter at 2.94.
Last year, all Spartan-Cardinal
games were rained out, and the two
