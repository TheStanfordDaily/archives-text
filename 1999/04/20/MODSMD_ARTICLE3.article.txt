# Microsoft changes site license fees

Although new Microsoft licensing policies are drawing
protests at other universities, administrators say the poli
cies, which began affecting Stanford last year, have had a
more minor impact here.
Campus Agreement 2.0, Microsoft's new plan for col
leges and universities, was introduced in 1997. The plan
requires campuses to pay a fee that reflects how many
total students and faculty can use software programs such
as Microsoft Office '98.
In the past an unlimited number of users had access to
a limited number of programs. For instance, a university
would only have to pay for 2(H) licenses that many people
could use on multiple computers, although there was a
limit as to how many people could use the programs con
currently.
Now universities have to pay for a license for every

computer that has access to a Microsoft program, but the
cost of each individual license has decreased.
Stanford had to buy new licenses last year with the re
lease of Microsoft Office "98. "This caught us completely
by surprise last spring," said Jamey Frank, assistant direc
tor of program operations and support for Stanford's ()f
-l'ice of Residential Computing. He added that the new ex
penses caused by the policy change have come out of Res
idential Computing's budget.
While Stanford has been dealing with Microsoft's new
licensing rules for a year. Harvard I Jniversity and the Uni
versity of Wisconsin just felt the brunt of the new policy
when their old contracts with Microsoft expired last
month. The new policy sparked student protests at both
universities.
An article in the April 2 issue of the ( 'hronicle of I ligh
cr Education reported that students at a rally held in
Madison, Wis., "burned — or, as
they put it, 'barbecued' — both Mi
crosoft disks and images of the com
pany's chairman, Bill Gates."
Harvard students have had to bear
the cost of Microsoft's licensing
change, according to The Harvard
Crimson. Stanford students' reac
tions may have been considerably
calmer because Res Comp has ab
sorbed the new financial burden.
Although they may not notice it
yet, Stanford students have been and
will be affected by the change.
Frank said Res Comp has "had to
increase our software budget. Also,
instead of hiring more technical sup
port students, we have to pay for
more licenses."
The programs the University
chooses to buy will also have to be

more carefully monitored, said Ethan
Rikleen, Res Comp's network and
system administrator.
"We've had to spend a lot more
money," Rikleen said. "We're proba
bly going to have to spend money
only on things that will be used by the
most students."
For example Microsoft programs
such as Excel, which are not used as
often as Office or Word, will most
likely not receive as big a share of the
budget.
"I just can't see us justifying buy
ing 4(X) copies of Excel," Rikleen
said.
Frank said that although Res
Comp has been able to deal with the
new policy, the increased cost has
been inconvenient. "This policy is
costing us thousands of dollars. It's
basically designed to make Microsoft
money, which they really don't need
because they already have control of
the market."
