# Draw changes taking effect
## Groups can opt to stick together 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
The upcoming Draw, Stanford's
ever-changing housing assignment
process which contuses and perplex
es many students, has undergone yet
another wave of modifications.
For the first time. Draw groups
will be able to indicate on their hous
ing applications that they are willing
to receive a less desirable housing as
signment in order to stay together in
the same residence. Housing As
signment Services will honor this re
quest, provided that the group's
members are the same gender and
submit the same housing prefer
ences.
According to the Housing As
signment Services World Wide Web
site, this feature "was created to
allow groups greater flexibility in
their choice to stay together."
The Residential Programs Imple
mentation Group, which approves
changes to the Draw, is also working
on further changes that it hopes will
yield a more equitable Draw. For a
time, it was considering a move from
the current "two preferred
years/one unpreferred year" sys
tem to a "one 'premier' year/two
guaranteed years" system. The
thrust behind this "premier year"
proposal was to increase a student's
chances of receiving at least one year
of Stanford's most desirable hous
ing. since it is possible under the cur
rent system for a student to draw a
high (i.e. undesirable) number dur
ing both preferred years.
However, after conducting sever
al surveys, focus groups and conver

sations, RPIG found that students
largely rejected the "premier year"
plan in favor of a "three-tiered"
Draw. In this system, each student
would be issued one tier —. top, mid
dle and low — and be able to decide
which year — sophomore, junior or
senior — to use each tier. If a fresh
man wished to receive the most de
sirable housing during his sopho
more year, he would use his "top"
tier and his number would fall some
where within the top third of Draw
numbers.
"The three-tiered Draw system is
still under consideration," according
to Undergraduate Housing Assign
ment Supervisor Jacqueline Wilson.
Starting next year, several under
graduate housing configuration
changes will also come into play.
Most significantly, the
Freshman / Sophomore »■ 'sidential
College will occupy Schiff and
Adams, two of the four houses in
Sterling Quadrangle. Living in uie
college during sophomore year will
be counted as a preferred year.
Due to the number of freshmen
who will occupy the college, Faisan
and Soto are being converted from
all freshman to four-class dormito
ries, opening these houses to the
Draw.
This is also the first year that ju
niors and seniors have been able to
give feedback on last year's new sys
tem.
"The main change that was im
plemented last year was thai stu
dents could see their Draw numbers
in advance and could adjust their
residence choices accordingly." Wil
son said.
"Feedback on this change from
students was that they can now make
more informed decisions regarding
their Draw choices," she said.
Senior and Soto resident adviser
Sharmeel Wasan agreed. "I think it
was definitely a positive change be
cause in the past I've drawn really
badly and have been forced to live in
residences that 1 really didn't want to
live in. It's definitely nice to know
[your Draw number] beforehand,"
Wasan said.
According to some, the disposi
tion of the student and the people in
the residence are more important
than the residence itself when it
comes to a happy living situation.
Karina Celery, a junior, was unaf
fected by the Draw last year because
of her status as a peer health educa
tor; but she drew 1,980 out of 2,(X)0
her freshman year.
"That sucked, but I ended up in

Trancos and it worked out fine," she
said.
