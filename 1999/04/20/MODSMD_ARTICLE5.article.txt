# Fmr. Sierra Club president:
## 'Act Now, Apologize Later' 
### David Arulananthan Staff writer 
Adam Werbach, former president of the Sierra
Club and author of the book "Act Now. Apologize
Later," talked about the importance of environmental
activism last night in Cubberley Auditorium.
Werbach, 26, who at the age of 23 became the
youngest president in the organization's history, spoke
about sustainability and the importance of student in
volvement in the environmental movement.
His speech kicked off Earth Week, a week-long se
ries of lectures and activities sponsored by the Stanford
Environmental Representatives with the theme of
"Shaping a Sustainable Future." The representatives
are a part of Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford and, according to sophomore coordinator
Louise Auerhahn, focus on "campus-based and tradi
tional environmental issues."
Addressing a modest crowd of 15, he began his talk
by singing "If you're happy and you know it, clap your
hands," and urging the audience to participate. Despite
the somewhat unorthodox tactics at the outset, Wer
baeh's speech was well-received by members of the au
dience.
"I think today's speech was very inspirational. He
brought a different viewpoint and signaled a new gen
eration of activism," said Jason Roeder, a coterminal
student in environmental engineering.
At the end of his speech, Werbach made two policy
suggestions: To drain Lake Powell in Utah and to stop
logging national forests, a move that he claims "would
save $780 million."
His said his experience meeting President Clinton
after the signing of a major environmental bill and the
president's preoccupation with then-U.S. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich made him "question more the
political system (he) was involved in."
Midway through the speech, Werbach introduced
Julia "Butterfly" Hill by telephone to the audience.
Hill, an activist from the environmental group "Earth
First!" has been living by herself on top of a 1 ,(MH)-year

old redwood tree in the Headwaters forest of Hum
boldt County in protest of the logging industry.
Talking for more than 25 minutes. Hill spoke of her
living conditions, the importance of "re-connecting
with nature" and preventing destruction of the forest.
"Until we have complete and permanent protection
[of the redwood forest], this issue will still he an issue,"

She also pointed out the urgency
of the matter.

start making the small sacrifices
now ... or we can wait until there is

no longer a choice," she said.

pleased with the turnout.

The people who came were really
