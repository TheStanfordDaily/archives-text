### 
NEW YORK (AP) — First lady Miliary
Rodham Clinton, in New York for a trip
largely designed to explore a potential Sen
ate race, said yesterday she plans to go to
Albania and Macedonia to meet with
refugees "as soon as I'm given the green
light to go."
"I think it is very important for me to go
to Kosovo eventually, but I want to go
when my going does not interfere with the
work and in any way displace resources" of
the international community trying to help
thousands of refugees fleeing from the
fighting in Kosovo, she said.
"I've been asked to go. I've expressed
my very strong interest in going and as soon

as I'm given the green light to go. 1 intend
to go."
She made the remarks after meeting
with the heads of several private founda
tions raising money to help the refugees.
Clinton's meeting with the foundations
was the first event in a crowded schedule
that seems designed to stoke interest in a
potential Senate campaign.
The first lady is expected to decide in
June or July whether to seek the seat being
vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan.
Clinton said she is seriously considering
whether to run but insisted her schedule on
this trip was a typical one for a first lady.
