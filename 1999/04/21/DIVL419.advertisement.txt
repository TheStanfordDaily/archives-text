For 17 years Hank
Greenwald was the voice
of the San Francisco
Giants, and he became
one of the most beloved
figures in San Francisco
media history. Greenwald's
wry sense of humor
endeared him to all. His
daily trademark was his
spoof of the broadcast
disclaimer, hence the
book's title. He interrupted
his stint with the Giants in
1987 to be the voice of the
New York Yankees for two
years, and his stories about
his Yankee times are
downright hilarious. In
This Copyrighted
Broadcast, Greenwald
also reveals his other
passions—trains, General
Douglas Mac Arthur, and
Australia. This book
transcends "local" and
goes well beyond just
another broadcaster's
memoirs. As a student at
Syracuse University, he was
a classmate of Jim Brown and a friend of the late Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis. Hank's
stories about them are touching and revealing. This is a book about baseball. About broadcast
ing everything from minor league baseball to NBA games. About a sportscasting career that
goes from Syracuse's fabled broadcast school to the very top on both coasts.
, It's about life. And it's funny.
