# Stanford reacts to Kosovo bombings
## Rep. Campbell offers alternatives 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
The escalating nature of the
Kosovo conflict and the current ex
odus of refugees from the contested
area to IJ.N. border camps has elicit
ed a diverse range of reactions from
the Stanford community.
"It's not a problem that's going to
be solved by bombing buildings,"
said freshman Larry Estrada. "We
should explore other diplomatic so
lution and our primary focus should
be on helping the refugees."
Other students opposed the
bombing for different reasons.
Freshman Dan Serres found U.S.
motives to be highly questionable.
"I think we're in there for trade and

strategic reasons â€” because they're
Europeans and not Africans," he
said.
Tim Beard, a junior majoring in
political science, said he supports
the bombing. 1 Ie believes the Clin
ton administration has adopted an
aggressive policy in regard to Koso
vo because "this is a situation in
which they can go in and make a dif
ference."
U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell (R-
Calif.). a Stanford law professor and
congressman from the 15th District,
questions the wisdom of U.S. inter
vention.

and believes a protracted ground
conflict would result in the unneces
sary casualties and expenditure of
military funds.
In a press release, Campbell ob
served that a ground war pursued
with resoluteness "might be a lesson
to future tyrants," but only "if we be
lieve tyrants learn from their prede
cessors in other countries at other

times."
"At this point in time Congress
man Campbell believes it is a bloody
civil war, and we should reassert
diplomatic efforts," said Joel Starr,
an aide speaking for Campbell.
Regardless of the possible out
comes of military intervention,
Campbell indicated he believes that
Clinton should have asked Congress
for a declaration of war to pursue the
current w;ir in Yugoslavia. He has
introduced a resolution in the House
of Representatives compelling a

vote on declaring war on Yugoslavia
over Kosovo.
"The Founding Fathers had
something in mind when they made
sure that no sole person could de
clare war," Starr said.
Whether or not the president is
required to request a declaration of
war from Congress in situations such
as Kosovo is a "long-standing consti
tutional dispute." according to Polit
ical Science Prof. James Fearon. He
went on to note that "for some time
now, going back to the Cold War,

U.S. presidents have asserted the au
thority to militarily intervene in in
ternational disputes without declar
ing war."
"I think, by our Constitution, he
does [have to request a declaration
of war]. It certainly seems to me lie's
waging war," Serres said.
Campbell said the administration
should "stop the bombing and help
refugees where they are." He noted
that most of the ethnic Albanian
population was now outside of
Kosovo and suggested that the West

and NATO use humanitarian aid
funds to assist refugees in recon
structing their lives outside of their
homeland.
"I think you can use the monies
out there for the prosecution of the
war and redirect them towards help
ing the refugees," Starr said. Refer
ring to a congressional resolution
that might be necessary to authorize
such a transfer of funds, the aide be
lieved that "it would pass over
whelmingly."
Political science professors said

that Campbell's proposal to relocate
refugees and transfer funds to aid
them is unfeasible.
"Either of those claims is highly
contestable," Political Science Prof.
Morris Fiorina said. "A whole lot of
congressmen, regardless of how they
feel about the war, would feel that's
a crazy precedent," he said.
Fearon agreed. "I think that if
Tom Campbell were sitting in the
president's chair he would have to
ask himself, is this a good policy to
have down the road?' Could you re
ally have a U.S. or NATO policy that
if you ethnically cleanse your popu
lation the U.S. will pay to relocate
the refugees?" Fearon said.
Students differed in their assess
ment of Campbell's proposal. Serres
thought that the proposal "seems ex
pedient, if you're trying to save lives
in the short run."

Freshman Josh I lurwit, however,
disapproved. "It's a common Amer
ican belief that you can solve prob
lems by moving people around," he
said.
Hurwit commented that in the
l.Xth and I c )th centuries many Amer
icans believed they could solve the
country's race relations problem by
shipping African Americans to
colonies in Africa.
Sophomore Rick Gerkin ex
pressed his opinion of the proposal
succinctly. "Money can't buy [the
refugees] new homes," he said.
