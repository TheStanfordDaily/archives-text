### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
The escalating nature of the
Kosovo conflict and the current ex
odus of refugees from the contested
area to IJ.N. border camps has elicit
ed a diverse range of reactions from
the Stanford community.
"It's not a problem that's going to
be solved by bombing buildings,"
said freshman Larry Estrada. "We
should explore other diplomatic so
lution and our primary focus should
be on helping the refugees."
Other students opposed the
bombing for different reasons.
Freshman Dan Serres found U.S.
motives to be highly questionable.
"I think we're in there for trade and

strategic reasons â€” because they're
Europeans and not Africans," he
said.
Tim Beard, a junior majoring in
political science, said he supports
the bombing. 1 Ie believes the Clin
ton administration has adopted an
aggressive policy in regard to Koso
vo because "this is a situation in
which they can go in and make a dif
ference."
U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell (R-
Calif.). a Stanford law professor and
congressman from the 15th District,
questions the wisdom of U.S. inter
vention.
Campbell does not believe that
air strikes alone will deter Milosevic
