## NATO attacks in Pristinia 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
(AP) â€” NATO launched daylight
attacks yesterday in Pristina and
other parts of Kosovo while accus
ing Serb forces of flushing out eth
nic Albanians hiding in the
province's hills.
U.S. helicopters and troops
were headed toward Albania in a
new phase aimed at boosting the
alliance's ability to attack
Yugoslav ground forces and stop
their campaign to rid Kosovo of its
ethnic Albanian majority.
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
said Serb military and paramilitary
forces were shelling hills where
ethnic Albanians had fled, march
ing the refugees on roads and
putting them on trains to the bor
der, then closing the frontier to
them.
"What we are seeing as we
study these movements of people
is a kind of safari operation ongo
ing by the Serb security forces
against the Kosovar Albanians,"
Shea said.
He told reporters at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,

that the alliance was investigating
reports of 700 ethnic Albanian
boys as young as 14 being used
either as "human shields or as
blood banks for Serb casualties."
Refugees also said as many as
700 men were used as human
shields last week near the town of
Orahovac. There was no indepen
dent confirmation of the report.
The accusations came as the
alliance continued its four-week
assault on Yugoslavia, hammering
targets in a dozen towns and cities.
In Kosovo, the private
Yugoslav news agency FoNet said
one person was killed and two
injured in a daylight attack on a
government building in the provin
cial capital, Pristina. Missiles also
struck the city airport, FoNet said.
NATO planes bombed targets
near Kosovo's Belacevac coalmine
at least four times yesterday, the
state-run Tanjug news agency said.
The mine supplies coal for a Pristi
na power station that gives Kosovo
most of its electricity.
Fighting was also reported in
Kosovo between ethnic Albanian

rebels and Serb forces.
The Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe said 15
wounded Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters were brought to a
hospital Tuesday in the Albanian
border town Bajram Curri, along
with the bodies of two rebels killed
during fighting.
Also yesterday, an Albanian
soldier was wounded in a seven
hour exchange of machine-gun and
sniper fire across the Yugoslav-
Albanian border south of the
Kosovo city Djakovica, the OSCE
reported.
It was the first reported clash
between Albanian and Yugoslav
forces since the NATO bombing
campaign began March 24.
NATO also cited a series of
"disturbing developments," includ
ing reports "too numerous" to
ignore of Serb soldiers raping eth
nic Albanian women, using tear
gas to move ethnic Albanians out
of homes in Pristina and "mixing"
into civilian convoys, in addition to
continuing reports of executions
and mass burials.
