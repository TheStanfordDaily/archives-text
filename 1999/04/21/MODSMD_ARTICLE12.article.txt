# American trade deficit surges
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — America's trade deficit
surged to another record as aftershocks from the glob
al financial crisis cut further into the ability of Ameri
can manufacturers and farmers to sell overseas.
The trade deficit widened to $19.4 billion in Febru
ary. That was a 15.6 percent increase from the previous
record, January's imbalance of $16.8 billion.
Seeking to counter complaints that he has not done
enough to deal with the surging trade deficit. President
Clinton called on the international community to
redouble its efforts to overhaul the global financial
architecture to "tame the cycles of boom and bust" and
prevent future Asian-style currency crises.
Clinton told a White House gathering Tuesday that
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will be putting for
ward new ideas on crisis management at upcoming
meetings of the 182-nation International Monetary
Fund.
Congressional and labor union critics of Clinton's
free trade policies said the dramatic widening'of the
deficit in the year's first two months pointed to a need
for policies to protect American jobs.
Clinton, however, insisted in his brief remarks that
the U.S. economy is continuing to perform strongly as
a result of his policies, in spite of the rising trade deficit.
But critics pointed to the 380,(XX) jobs lost in the past
year at U.S. manufacturing plants forced to cut back
production because of slumping exports, and they
warned that Clinton's current policies must be changed.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan

expressed anxiety last week about rising protectionist
forces in the United States, but congressional support
ers of quotas to block a tlood of steel entering the coun
try said the new trade numbers will give them extra
ammunition.
They also promised to fight any effort by the admin
istration to strike a deal with China that would clear its
entry into the World Trade Organization.
In February, U.S. exports shrank for a fourth con
secutive month, falling 0.6 percent to $76.6 billion. The
downturn was led by a $927 million drop in commercial
aircraft sales. Exports of farm goods including wheat
and soybeans fell $130 million, while sales of telecom
munications equipment dropped by $157 million.
Imports jumped 2.3 percent to a record $96 billion,
and demand for autos and automotive parts rose to an
all-time high of $14.6 billion. Demand for foreign-made
consumer products also set a record as imports of cloth
ing, toys, television sets and stereos aUposted big gains.
While manufacturers and farmers have been hit
hard by the foreign financial crisis, the U.S. economy
has forged ahead on the strength of strong consumer
demand supported by an unemployment rate at its low
est level in three decades.
t
Economists said the worse-than-expected February
trade figures were likely to shave up to 2 full percent
age points from overall economic growth in the first
three months of this year, but that would still leave the
economy expanding at a healthy rate of around 4 per
cent.
