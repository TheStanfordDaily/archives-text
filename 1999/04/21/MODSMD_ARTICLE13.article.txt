# Tragedy in Colorado
## Two young gunmen in trench coats open fire 
### 
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP)
Two students in black trench coats
swept through their suburban high
school with guns and explosives in a
horrifying suicide attack yesterday
that may have left 25 people dead.
Several students said the killers were
gunning for minorities and athletes.
It was by far the bloodiest in a
string of school shootings that have
rocked U.S. communities over the
past few years.
"One of them opened his cape
and had a shotgun. Finally I started
figuring out these guys shot to kill,
for no reason," said a student, Nick
Claus. The gunman "didn't say any
thing. When he looked at me, the
guy's eves were just dead."
The gunmen — both juniors at
Columbine High School in this Den
ver suburb — were found dead in
the school library with self-inflicted
gunshot wounds and what appeared
to be bombs around their bodies,
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis
said.
"It appears to be a suicide mis
sion," Sheriff John Stone said.
Students said the gunmen, whose
names were not released, apparently
belonged to a clique of outcasts
called the "Trench Coat Mafia" who
wore long black coats, boasted of
owning guns and disliked blacks,
Hispanics and football players.
Davis said that the motive for the
attack was unknown and that school
officials had had no reports of trou
ble from the students.
The sheriff said 25 people may
have been killed, students and teach
ers alike. Hut by early evening, offi
cers had yet to remove any bodies
because of the danger of explosives
and the need to preserve evidence.
FBI agents and police SWAT teams
slowly made their way through the
building.
6- -lltVjiwt usfrsome
time because of how many rooms we
have bodies in." Davis said.
At least 23 people were hospital
ized. most of them with gunshot
wounds. One girl suffered nine
shrapnel wounds. At least 11 victims
were in critical or serious condition;
one was in guarded condition.
The attack began at 11:30 a.m.
The killers, wearing fatigues and
trench coats, started firing in the

parking lot and then entered the
school. They shot as they walked
into the cafeteria, then walked
upstairs to the library and continued
firing with what were thought to be
semiautomatic weapons and a shot
gun.
Bullets ricocheted off lockers as
students sprinted for the exits.
Wade Frank, an 18-year-old
senior, said he saw one of the killers
shoot someone point-blank in the
back with a 2-foot gun, possibly a
sawed-off shotgun. "He was just
casually walking," Frank said. "He
wasn't in any hurry."
Dozens of students hid in class
rooms before escaping with the help
of police in an armored car. Others
were trapped for hours while SWAT
teams searched for the gunmen.
At one point, a bloodied young
man dangled from a second-floor
window, his right arm limp, and was
helped down by two SWAT team
members. His condition was not
immediately known.
More than four hours after the
attack, a ywtfhg tuatf-was led away
from the'jjdlool in,
said that the young man was
believed to be a friend of the gun
men but did not take part in the
attack.
Davis said explosives were found
in two cars in the school parking lot
and bomb squad officers were dis
arming them. Also, the homes of the
two gunmen were being searched.
In Washington, President Clinton

said: "Perhaps now America will
wake up to the dimensions of this
challenge, if it could happen in a
place like Littleton."
Wes Lammers, 17, was among
several Columbine High students
who said the gunmen were targeting
minorities and athletes at the 1,8(X)-
student high school.
Students said the killers might
have been part of a group of eight to
10 students known as the Trench
Coat Mafia.
Sean Kelly, 16, said several mem
bers of the Trench Coat Mafia had a
video production class and made a
video about guns they had. He also
said that several members recently
bragged about getting new guns, and
that he heard members making
derogatory remarks about blacks
and Hispanics.
For hours after the attack,
wounded victims lay inside the
building and police were unable to
get to them because they feared that
the gunmen might still be alive and
holding hostages.
Outside.«-hTmdrWs of officers
from throughout tlYe, I Oliver area
surrounded the school. Frantic par
ents were sent to an elementary
school nearby, where they waited for
word of their children.
Teen-agers hugged parents and
each other and wept and they
recalled the shootings. Some stu
dents had called their parents on cel
lular phones from inside the building
to whisper that they were OK.
