Study shows drop in cancer
WASHING lON (AP) — Fewer Americans are stricken with cancer
every year, thanks largely to drops in smoking, scientists announced yes
terday.
The news is better for men: Although they still suffer more cancer than
women do, the rate of new cancer cases is dropping eight limes faster for
men than for women, says an annual report on cancer by the American
Cancer Society and government scientists.
Overall, cancer incidence has dropped 2.2 percent a year since 1992,
says the new report, published in this week's Journal of the National Can
cer Institute, which analyzed cancer trends through 1996.
Scientists warned yesterday that tobacco use could reverse the
progress: Lung cancer remains the nation's top cancer killer, and recent
declines in lung cancer among men who quit smoking in the 1970s and '80s
helped fuel the overall declines in cancer incidence and mortality. But
high teen smoking and new popularity for cigars have experts fearing a
rebound.
Cancer incidence increased slowly from the 1970s through 1992 — but
since then has steadily dropped, about 2.2 percent a year through 1996,
the report said. It's falling faster for men, 4.1 percent a year, compared
with less than half a percent drop each year for women.

Rosa Parks may receive highest civilian honor
WASHINGTON (AP) — Rosa Parks, who stoked the civil rights move
ment by refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus, would receive
Congress' most prestigious civilian honor under legislation sent to the
White House yesterday.
The House voted 424-1 to award the 86-year-old Alabama native the
Congressional Gold Medal. The Senate passed the measure Monday on
an 86-0 vote. President Clinton is expected to sign it.
Republicans and Democrats lauded her as an American heroine.
"She is an ordinary citizen with extraordinary courage," Rep. Spencer
Bachus, R-Ala., said. "She had the fortitude to claim for herself the most
ordinary, the most basic of civil rights — to be treated fairly and equally."
Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said that "one, simple, defining act" by Parks
began a nonviolent revolution in the South that led to the end of segrega
tion.
Mrs. Parks watched the debate on television while traveling in Los
Angeles.
"Mrs. Parks is very excited to have this honor." said Anita Peek, exec
utive director of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Devel
opment. Mrs. Parks co-founded the nonprofit in IMS 7 in Detroit, where
she now lives, to benefit young people.

Cigarette billboards to come down r
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — In the Marlboro Man's hometown and across
the land, cigarette billboards that were once a celebrated part of the
American landscape are coming down this week as part of the national
settlement with the tobacco industry.
In many places, the rugged cowboy with the cigarette dangling from
the corner of his mouth will yield to images of children delivering anti
smoking messages.
Under the $206 billion agreement between the tobacco industry and 46
states over the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses, all cigarette bill
boards must be removed by Friday. The agreement allows states to take
over billboard leases that had been held by tobacco companies and put
anti-smoking ads on them at the companies' expense until the leases
expire.
Still, images like the Marlboro Man and R.J. Reynolds' Joe Camel will
probably remain ingrained in the public's consciousness.
John F. Banzhaf 111. executive director of Action on Smoking and
Health, a Washington-based anti-smoking group, said the demise of
tobacco billboards is a mostly symbolic victory. Increasing cigarette taxes
and imposing more restrictions 011 public smoking would have greater
practical effect, he said.
