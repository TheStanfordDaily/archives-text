New faculty grievance
procedure lacks needed
avenues of recourse

A FACULTY SENATE task
force has made recommen
dations for changes to the
University's faculty grievance proce
dure that the body will vote on at its
next meeting. While the task force's
recommendations were made with
the goal of streamlining the process
to make it less complex and time
consuming, it may have neglected
some important safeguards.
Several recent high-profile faculty
grievance cases involving denial of
tenure have highlighted the lengthy
and arduous nature of this process.
Grievants can spend more than a
year mired in separate appeals appli
cations to the deans of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the Uni
versity provost and a faculty adviso
ry hoard, which makes recommen
dations to the University president.
The Faculty Senate's recommen
dations address the protracted char
acter of the tenure process. Howev
er. the most alarming part of the
proposal would iiive the University
-aver consider
ing a faculty member's request for
an appeal. Under the proposal, the
advisory board would make recom
mendations to the provost, and the
president would reserve the right to
deny appeals after the provost's
decision.
Iliough there has been disagree
ment about the grievance process
and what it should and should not
take into account when considering
appeals of tenure decisions, one
thing seems certain. The grievant

can always take his or her appeal to
the next higher level in the process
and is guaranteed consideration.
However, granting the University
president unilateral power to deny
consideration of an appeal seems to
close off a grievant's avenues for
recourse.
University president Gerhard
Casper has stated that the grievance
cases coming before him have been
"incredibly time-consuming."
ITiis is no reason to stymie the
attempts of faculty members who
believe they have wrongly been
denied tenure and seek recourse.
Tenure decisions can often be
subjective judgment calls and are
dependent on which criteria are
used and how they are defined. As
the case of former Asst. History
Prof. Karen Sawislak illustrated,
each level of review based its deci
sions on different criteria. The dean
of Humanities and Sciences cited
questions about her scholarship. The
advisory board decided the dean had
incorrectly interpreted peer reviews
of Sawislak's work. In addition, the
advisory board considered Sawis
lak's fellowship appointments as an
indicator of her scholarship, while
the dean did not. The advisory board
recommended that Sawislak's
grievance be upheld.
Though in the end, Casper did not
heed the advisory board's recom
mendations, the fact that Sawislak
could appeal to the next level and
have her case considered is an
important safeguard in the grievance
system.
Because tenure granting can be
subjective, it is only fair that a facul
ty member who has been denied
tenure has every possible avenue of
redress open to him or her.
