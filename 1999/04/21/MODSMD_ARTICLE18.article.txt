# Breathing Lessons
## The
						sounds of silence 
### 
April van Scherpe

Everyone loves
field trips. So
instead of this
week's column, we're tun
ing in to the radio. The fol
lowing is a transcript of a
brand spankin' new call-in
show you may not have
heard on KZSIJ. Let's lis

ten in.
Dr. D: Hey, and welcome to everyone
out there. I'm glad you've joined me, and
soon you will be, too. Yes, that's right,
because as I picture all of you snuggling
together in front of your sound systems. I
know that tonight's issue will be one close to
your heart — or at least always on your
mind. Tonight, folks, we'll be talking
frankly about that most pulse-racing, heart
thumping. palm-sweating, gasping, lip-wet
ting and frenzied activity happening all over
this college campus.
No, no, don't Hip that dial now. I know it
makes you blush, but come on — we all
know you secretly want to hear about this.
Think it doesn't relate to you? Don't deny
it. We've all heard the reputation Stanford
can't shake, but I assure you! It is happen
ing in every corner of this university. It's
happening right now.
It might be going on in your building, on
your hall, maybe even next door. You've
heard it in progress — don't say you
haven't. And when your hallmate comes
out to use the bathroom? He looks pretty
Hushed there, no? And we all know you've
done it too. So let's get to the nitty gritty.
Our first caller sets the stage
nicely ... Caller, are you there?
Timniy: IJh, yes. Dr. D.
Dr. D: Good, baby, now you're on the
air so why don't you tell us your problem?

Tininiy: Well, it's just like you said. It's
happening all around me. First my friends,
then my roommate, and once ... um ... I
even walked in on my RA. And everyone's
pressuring me to do it. too. Like it's no big
deal, like it's the social norm. But it's a big
deal to me. They'll introduce me to a pretty
girl, expect me t0... you know...and I
don't want to.
Dr. 1): Want to what? Use your words.
Timniy: Have a forced conversation. It
feels so wrong. So fake.
Dr. I): (Disappointed sigh) I'm sure that,
like the doctor, many of you out there are
thinking that's supremely less exciting than
nookie. Hut you've already
read . . .uh... listened this far. so go on,
Timmy.
Timniy: It always happens the same way.
I'll be introduced to someone and feel like I
have to. Then the weirdness begins. The
drawn out "so's" and the "well-Lhens" and
one time — it w;ts horrible — a girl said.
"So, here we are." All I could say was.
"Yep. here we are."
The next morning when I thought about
it I was humiliated. I feel like 1 barely knew
this person. It doesn't feel natural. Maybe
there are some times when I'd feel right
having a conversation, but other times .... I
don't want to be insulting, and 1 don't want
to seem like a social freak, but what ever
happened to abstaining? What ever hap
pened to silence?
Dr. D: Caller, you've hit upon an excel
lent point. All you listeners with your par
ties and your social networking and your
constant introductions, listen for a moment
to me.
As with everything, there is an appropri
ate time and place for a conversation.
Impassioned verbal exchanges with real

spark and interest are the most beautiful
expression of acquaintance that two people
can have. Conversations to break the ice are
sometimes acceptable, too. But our society
Haunts the words "politeness" and "socia
bility." claiming that we should try to have
conversations with everyone, all the time.
And look at what we have come to.
Awkwardness. Embarrassment. Lowered
self-esteem. The gurgling death of a conver
sation. when two people can do nothing but
independently wonder how to best bury the
baby without it squirming too much.
My show toasts to the death of psycho
babble. but here's one salvageable tidbit.
Some say that forced conversationalists are
running from something. They're trying to
make themselves feel more secure by mod
ifying their image with a barrage of words.
Make silence a testament that you feel com
fortable with your partner, that you don't
need a barrier of pointless conversation.
Try it for one day. If you don't jump into
things, if you wait to have a conversation
until you are truly ready, until it is a natural
expression of how you feel, you'll find a
form of conversation that is to be cherished,
not squandered. There is something beauti
ful about waiting, because when you finally
do it.it can be really good.
Forced conversationalists act as though
there is nothing to be enjoyed without
speaking going on. But forget etiquette.
Smile and point out to your companion the
outside world you've been shutting out with
all of your chatter.
That's all for tonight. Take care of your
selves and each other.
