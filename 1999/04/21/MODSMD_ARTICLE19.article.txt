In defense of endorsements
In criticizing the Daily's election endorse
ments, Auren Kale, in his letter on April 19,
says dI" newspapers in the New York area:
"When these real' newspapers endorse a
candidate, they do so under the guise that
their editorial boards are reflecting the views
of their perceived readership."
I doubt that any member of those editori
al boards would agree. Editorials reflect the
reporting, analysis and conclusions of the
editorial board (or of the editor, or the pub
lisher, or the owner), not views of the read
ership. Polls reflect the views of the reader
ship.
Editorial endorsements are independent
assessments of an electoral issue, including
the editorial board's recommendation about
what a voter should do: vote yes, vote no, go
fishing. That is their value.
With all their potential shortcomings —
including bias, myopia or shoddy
research — editorial endorsements are one
of the few independent perspectives avail
able to voters in an election.

Conservative Hoover OK
In an era where liberal fads are all the
rage in academia, I find it curious that some
professors are concerned that the Hoover
Institution has a conservative bent ("Some
profs concerned by 'partisan' Hoover,"
Apr. 20).
In a sea of academic liberalism, certainly
one drop of conservatism cannot be a
threat, can it? As for the concern that
Hoover appointees are involved in "parti
san politics," I suspect that if the Hoover
Institution named Mario Cuomo, Dan Ros
tenkowski and Jesse Jackson as fellows, the
chorus would not be singing the same tune.
Also, how quickly we forget that Bill
Bradley, a Democratic presidential candi
date, spent some time at 1 loover.
Finally, I challenge the naysayers to
examine the publication records of aca
demics at Hoover and still claim that
Hoover is a detriment to Stanford. 1 think
that reasonable people will see that Hoover
brings interesting scholars of all political
leanings to campus and is a tremendous
asset to our intellectual environment.

Co Ho 'discrimination l unfair
A few days ago I got in my e-mail a call
for contributions to a poetry and music
evening at Co Ho.
I was about to express interest in par
ticipating w hen a second reading made me
realize the event was for "women poets
and musicians."
However insignificant a poet or musi
cian I may be, it's beyond my powers to
deny a fact long registered in my crotch,
namely that I am a castrated woman (i.e.
"woman" without the "wo").
Why then did I receive a call whose
only, it seems, purpose was to inform me
of my exclusion from the advertised
event?
Convenience.
What was the authors' intention? Prob
ably something like, "We want to reach as
many creative Stanford women as possi
ble."
And what was the "message" I got?
"You are informed about an event that
you cannot participate in on account of
your sex."
What accounts for this communication
problem is, I think, the following: An
event based on sexual identity (which I

read "exclusiveness") is advertised
through sex-blind venues.
What could serve as a remedy to the
problem is either the hard, sweaty path of
compiling an all-female e-mail list, or the
more easy one of using the existing gener
al lists but with appropriate subject indica
tion of the recipient group.
The more wise choice, though, would
be to loosen up ideological rigidity and
experiment with more inclusive phrasing
like. "Everyone is welcome to participate
in the event, though priority is reserved
for female artists."
That would be enough to spare them
this letter.
For beyond His- and Herstory there is
one and the same story: No matter how
much injustice, oppression and all sorts of
crimes have stained the moral record of
the human race, we all still live on the
same planet, breath the same air and share
the same resources.
Let's enter the new millennium in the
spirit of inclusiveness and cooperation
that befits the members of the same
species.
