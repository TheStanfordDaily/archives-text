## How a faculty group has successfully lobbied Stanford to delay infill housing News Analysis 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
Opposition from campus leasehold
ers has caused I Jniversity President Ger
hard ( asperonee again to delay the deci
sion on whether or not the University
will go ahead with plans to build 3(> addi
tional faculty housing units on Stanford
land.
Casper himself said the delay came
"particularly in light of the petition and
the ongoing controversy about the pro
posals."
I he original decision was scheduled
for March, but since the time the plan
was announced, senior faculty and emer

ili professors who live on campus have
rallied against the proposal.
Stanford Citizen Initiative, a group of
homeowners organized to prevent the
development of several pieces of com
munity land, published a full-page ad in
1 he Daily last week voicing their opposi
tion to eliminating open space.
More than >IH) household members
signed the petition against the develop
ment. 1 he petition asked the University
to "|s|uspend all work on the proposed


Gautam Deshpande â€” Daily
'infill' developments."
The Provost's Housing Task
Force will continue to review alterna
tive proposals presented through the
Stanford Citizen Initiative petition
and will look further into the implica
tions of the development through the
end of the quarter, when Casper
plans to make his final decision.
The infill development was de
signed to be an immediate solution to
an enormous campus problem: the
relative scarcity of affordable hous
ing for new and junior faculty mem
bers. The conflict has been painted by
many as a clash of interests between
junior faculty and senior faculty, in

eluding emeritus professors.
At past Faculty Senate meetings,
some department chairs have argued
that the lack of affordable faculty
housing is a primary reason why
many potential new faculty members
have declined positions at the Uni
versity. The Stanford Citizen Initia
tive claims that the idea that senior
and retired professors no longer have
a right to their land is "deeply offen
sive." They claim that new professors
will have reservations coming to a
campus where leaseholders' claims
are disregarded in the long run.
"We are very happy that there
hasn't been a decision it) go forward
so that there can be more long-range
and comprehensive planning," said
homeowner Diana Dutton, a mem
ber of the Citizen Initiative. "This

project is a Band-Aid that is not going
to help in the long run."
Engineering-Economic Systems
and Operations Research Prof. Jim
Sweeney, co-chair of the Provost's
I lousing Task Force, said the adver
tisement and petition "raised many
issues that we had already discussed
among ourselves."
Sweeney emphasized that the task
force has focused most of its attention
on the infill development sites, not al
ternative development and financing
schemes such as those suggested by
the citizen initiative.
The president's decision to delay
the construction comes despite the
Board of Trustees' acknowledgment
that the problem requires a immedi
ate solution.
"While we recognize the need for

careful balancing of the interests of
current leaseholders and young fac
ulty. we also feel a sense of urgency to
make progress on this issue," said the
Board of Trustees in a statement to
Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Despite the University's commit
ment to go forward with designs for
more long term solutions to the facul
ty housing crunch, infill development
is seen as an effective way to help the
shortage in the short run.
But the Stanford Citizen Initiative
argues that the planned development
fails to meet even this short-term
need.
"One of our objections on the in
fill housing is that even the smallest
units will not be affordable based on
current market rates for most young
faculty members," Dutton said.
