## On leadership, self-worth and a head custodian 
### 
Jocelyn Wiener

IT IS JUNE 23, 1994, 2:00 a.m.. and I am
sitting in the middle of a health clinic in
Paraguay. 1 have slept three hours since
my arrival, and have just found out I have
nowhere to live. I want to crawl in a hole. My
program leader looks at me. I don't know
him well, but he seems nice.
Jocelvn. can we talk? We have some
unresolved issues to clear up."
We do? Right now?
'Yes. Actually, the issue is basically you."
Me? Really?
"Do you know what we have always
thought of you? All of us program leaders?"
No. I don't know.
"Ever since we first met you. we have
thought you are obnoxious. What do you
think?"
Um, you seem like a nice guy
It is August 1, 19%, and I am sitting,
squirming on a shady wooden bench. Ms.
I hatcher, a high school teacher with whom I
have been working throughout the summer,
is speaking to me. Or. more accurately, she is
chainsawing my self-esteem
"Jocelvn, let me be frank. Do vou know

what your problem is?"
No, I don't know.
"You have a punchy sense of humor, you
are too flexible and you might be smart, deep
down, but the way you act is much of the rea
son that sexism still exists. You made the mis
take of thinking we were equals. We're not.
What is more, you are a hypocrite and you
are arrogant. What do you have to say?"
I Jm. Thanks for being so open?
For some reason. I hate feedback ses
sions.
With a lump in my throat. 1 swallowed as
hard as I could to avoid disempowering
myself further by crying in front of her. I
walked away with my back straight, my head
high, and my eyes dry. Only when I was out
of Ms. Thatcher's sight did I sit down and
wipe the humiliated tears from my eyes.
Presently, Jorge, the head custodian at
our high school, approached me. I smiled
and tried to look unperturbed. Jorge and I
had been friends for three years, ever since I
spent a night shadowing the custodial crew
lor an article in my high school newspaper.
Jorge and I talked politics (he was a mod
erate Republican, he said, and eventually I

would swing that way, too.) We talked finan
cial sense (he recommended I acquire some.)
We philosophized; we gossiped.
Now, with Jorge standing over me. I want
ed to maintain some vestige of dignity. But.
unlike faucets, tear ducts don't have an
on / off mechanism.
"How're you doing?"
Fine .. .g00d... we 11... I just... I'll be
okay.
"Yeah. I saw you guys talking out there. I
didn't hear what she was saying, but anyhow,
don't worry about it. She's got an abrasive
personality. She doesn't get along with me,
either."
Really?
"Hey listen, is your family still going on a
trip to Costa Rica?"
Yes. Will you write down your address,
Jorge? I will send you a letter.
"Yeah, hold on."
In a minute, Jorge returned. He handed
me an envelope, with his address written on
it. I thanked him, and wished him a happy
end of the summer.
"Sure, you too. And don't worrv about
that conversation."

When my brother. Jon, and I were in the
car on the way home. I recounted the con
versation I had had with Ms. Thatcher. I
believe Jon recommended immediate and
merciless revenge. I pulled out the envelope
with Jorge's address on it to see the note he
had written. But the front of the envelope
said "Don't open this until you get on the
plane to Costa Rica."
1 stuffed it back into my pocket.
We picked up the rest of my family and
left for the airport. I tearfully recounted the
conversation, further immortalizing it in mv
own memory. My mom said angrily that Ms.
Thatcher was absolutely wrong. My dad said
she was. well, never mind, but it made my
brother Matthew laugh.
As soon as the plane took off. I waved
goodbye to a country full of feedback ses
sions and sank down, hated. I pulled out
Jorge's envelope.
"To my favorite young Republican," he
had written on a scrap of paper, "this is for
you to spend on whatever you want." I
unwrapped the paper. Inside, there was a
$ 1 (K) bill.
I have never been able to spend that

money. It sits in my room at home, wrapped
in its original note, depreciating in financial
worth and appreciating in sentimental value.
It is waiting to be a big tip at Denny's, I think,
or a month's rent in Quezaltepeque. Human
beings don't have price tags, but someday
that money is going to be reinvested to make
someone else feel absolutely worthwhile.
It is May 16,1996, and 1 have the sense of
apprehension that comes when you enter a
conversation with someone who has given
you the silent treatment for over three
months. My dormmate sits down next to me.
"Jocelyn, let me honest. You are rude,
inflexible, and selfish. I think we need to
talk."
Dear Jorge, it might be late at this point,
but I just wanted to sav thank you.
