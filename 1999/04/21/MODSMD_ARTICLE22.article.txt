## Viruses supply new therapy for cystic fibrosis 
### Susanna Fryer 
While cystic fibrosis remains a
serious and lethal genetic disease,
Stanford researchers have recently
reported encouraging results in
their efforts to test a newly devel
oped gene therapy designed to
treat the disease.
Scientists from several disci
plines are working on this project
in collaboration with Targeted
Genetics, a Seattle-based corpora
tion that develops and markets
gene therapy products for acquired
and genetic diseases.
The proposed model of the cys
tic fibrosis therapy requires a
patient to inhale an aerosol spray
into the lungs through a plastic
tube in the mouth. The spray is
saturated with viral vectors con
taining functional copies of the
cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFRT)
gene. Scientists anticipate that
when the virus particles are
inhaled by the patient, they will
cross the membranes of epithelial
cells in the upper airways of the
lungs. In this way, the viruses will
bring genetic information to the
lung cells of the patient, enabling
him to correctly manufacture the
protein that malfunctions in cystic
fibrosis.
Viral vectors are commonly
used in gene therapy. The tech
nique takes advantage of a virus 1
ability to seize control of the nucle
us of a cell in the body so that it can
perpetuate its viral genome. In the

case of the cystic fibrosis gene ther
apy, the viral genome is manipulat
ed so that it contains a normal copy
of the gene that is defective in cys
tic fibrosis.
Phyllis Gardner, dean of the
Medical School and director of the
cystic fibrosis gene therapy clinical
trial, explained the technology
behind it. "Viral vectors are using
the natural mechanisms of the
virus to shuttle DNA into the
nucleus [of the target cell]."
Cystic fibrosis is a serious genet
ic scourge. With a life expectancy
of about 30 years, approximately
60,000 young people worldwide
suffer from cystic fibrosis. It is a
recessive genetic disorder, arising
when an individual inherits two
dysfunctional copies of the gene
that codes for CFTR.
As a membrane-bound protein,
CFTR acts as a gate to transport
ions into and out of the cell. Due to
the defective nature of CFTR in
patients with cystic fibrosis, their
cells cannot maintain proper ionic
balance.
This improper ion count leads
to a thick mucous build-up that
particularly afflicts the lungs, caus
ing severe respiratory distress and
inflammation. Patients also suffer
from pancreatic, liver and digestive
malfunction.
The cystic fibrosis therapy
designed by Targeted Genetics is a
treatment, rather than a cure. Sci
entists hope the viral vectors will
infect enough lung cells in the
patient so that the degree of cells

with normal CFTR will be great
enough for the treatment to be
effective.
Researchers expect the airborne
therapy will have to be repeated
every eight to 12 weeks, which they
believe is the average life span of a
lung cell. The repeated dose will
ensure continued expression of the
introduced gene.
Gardner noted that, through
their clinical trials of the gene ther
apy, researchers seek to answer
whether "the normal protein [man
ufactured by the viral vector] will
suffice" to provide some relief for
the symptoms of cystic fibrosis.
The initial study seems promising.
The first clinical trial patient to
undergo the new treatment, John
Sharbrough. said he considers him
self lucky to be the first patient to
try the genetic therapy. "I'm really,
really encouraged," he said.
On March 30, Targeted Genet
ics announced results from a Phase
I clinical trial, which tested the
therapy in maxillary sinuses of sub
jects, providing a good simulation
of how the lungs might react to the
viral vector.
Publication of the complete
results of the study are forthcom
ing, but there were no adverse
reactions related to the therapy,
and a reduction in the degree of
inflammation in the sinuses was
observed.
Gardner explained, "The sinus
study provided some evidence of
efficacy." The next step is to test
the therapy in the lungs.
