# Bug studies dazzling light display at local theater
## Dichroic coat creates multicolor ambiance

Q:The AMC Merc ado 20 movie
theater complex in Santa Clara
has interesting lights in each of the
theaters. They consist of what
looks like one light and two small
pieces of glass. What makes them
look cool is that four different col
ors of light seem to he reflecting in
different directions. How do they
work?
A: I spend many evenings at the
Mercado, and I've long wondered
how those lamps work. Last time I
was there for a movie. 1 decided to
go in for a closer look. I found that
they are precisely what you
guessed: A light and two small
pieces of glass. How perceptive.
What is unclear after inspection,
however, is exactly how this appar
ently simple arrangement of glass
splits the light into four different
colors.
Puzzled, 1 asked several
employees of the AMC theater if
they had an explanation for the
phenomenon, and here are some
of the answers I got:
•"Physics and stuff."
•"Two hot. melted butter jets at
every intersection."
•"Do I look like I go to Stan
ford?"
•"Please make your way to the
Guest Services desk."
•"Chili-cheese dog?"
"No, the four-color lights."
"Chili-cheese dog?"
Unconvinced that any of the
employees' answers were on the
mark. I decided to do some
research once I returned to cam
pus.
It turns out that those two little
pieces of glass have been coated
with a film which gives them inter
esting properties.
Dichroic coatings transmit cer
tain wavelengths of light while
reflecting others, thus creating an
effect similar to the iridescence
observed in dragonfly wings and
hummingbird feathers.
"Dichroic" is defined as the
property of having more than one
color, especially when viewed from
different angles or from transmit
ted to reflected light. Dichroic

coated glass is produced by a thin
film process that was originally
developed for the U.S. space pro
gram. It's normally used as an
interference filter in scientific mea
suring or correcting applications.
To create the filter, thin layers
of metallic oxides, like magnesium
and titanium, are deposited upon
the surface of the glass in a high
temperature vacuum furnace.
Glass is first carefully cleaned and
then placed in a furnace. Oxides
are placed in a crucible on the bot
tom of the furnace. Air is evacuat
ed from the chamber and then the
metallic oxides are vaporized. The
glass is then rotated as it is coated
to ensure an even layer. The coat
ing layer is only four to five-mil
lionths of an inch thick, and the
whole process must be monitored
by a computer for accuracy.

So if there's a coating on the
glass, why does it still appear clear?
The filter materials are all clear
or black and have no inherent col
ors. The pattern of clear and black
selects which color of light is
reflected and which is transmitted,
depending on the wavelength.
In the case of the theater lamps,
there is a white light source (the
bulb) that has a fairly constant dis
tribution of wavelengths across the
visible spectrum. The two pieces of
glass both have dichroic coating
material on them but have been
coated differently to reflect and
transmit distinct parts of the spec
trum. So when the white light
source shines on the treated glass,
part of the spectrum is transmitted
and the other part is reflected.
Be sure to tell everyone next
time you're there for a movie.
