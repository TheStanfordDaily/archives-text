# Echinacea use can become too much of a good thing
## 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
It used to be that when you felt cold symptoms
coming on, you reached for a packet of NeoCitrin or
popped a Sudafed. Now when friends see you looking
run down, they advise you to take some echinacea.
It is almost as if there is no excuse for getting sick
anymore. Echinacea is available in a multitude of
forms — caplets, tablets, syrups and tinctures. You
can even get it in your Jamba Juice, Odwalla juice or
cough drops. And if you don't like the taste, you can
camouflage it in raspberry, orange or strawberry fla
vors.
But wait a second. A few years ago, most of us had
never heard of echinacea, let alone know how to pro
nounce it. I was first introduced to it when I lived in
Germany, where herbal remedies are common and
generally treated with less skepticism than in the Unit
ed States.
Europeans have been reaching for their echinacea
to ward off colds and infections since the 19305,
according to the Herb Research Foundation in Col
orado. But according to one recent poll, only 7 percent
of Americans have used it.
Echinacea, or purple coneflower, is a member of
the sunflower family. There are nine varieties of the
plant, but only three are used medicinally: Echinacea
pallida, E. angustifolia, and E. purpurea, which is also
the most commonly cultivated variety. It works by
increasing the number of white blood cells in your sys
tem, and they in turn help fight off infections. You
can't use echinacea to prevent cold symptoms — it can
only make them less severe.
Echinacea is also reported to be effective in fight
ing infections of the upper respiratory and urogenital
tracts. One ingredient of the plant, echinoacoside,
appears to kill bacteria directly and aid skin regenera
tion. That's why in Germany, echinacea is also used
externally as a salve on cuts and burns.
But echinacea is not meant to be used as a routine
dietary supplement. Research carried out in Germany
has shown that it is most effective when taken in cycles
of 10 days on, four days off, at the first sign of illness.
And echinacea should not be taken for periods
longer than eight weeks. When used regularly, studies
show that echinacea loses its effectiveness, or worse,
has the opposite effect of suppressing the immune sys
tem.
So why the sudden deluge in echinacea-related
products? At the Whole Foods grocery store in down
town Palo Alto, several shelves are stocked with bot

ties of the stuff — there's even a separate line of prod
ucts just for kids.
"It's a selling fad," said employee Eric Davidson.
And what about people who make ingesting echi
nacea part of their daily diet of supplements?
"It won't hurt you," Davidson said.
There are no known side effects to taking echi
nacea. Besides, there's no guarantee that the echi
nacea found in some supplements and food
products — now a $15 billion industry — is even effec-

live. That's because herbal products in the United
States don't have to meet the same standards as over
the-counter drugs.
"There's not a lot known about most herbal reme
dies," said Ellen DiNucci, a member of the Comple
mentary and Alternative Medicine Program at Stan
ford. "They're not regulated here, and there's no stan
dardization. People think that because herbals are nat
ural, there's no harm in taking them."
Di Nucci recommends anyone interested in self
medicating with herbals such as echinacea do their
own research and pay close attention to the recom
mended dosage, as it can vary from product to prod
uct.
