### 
A Mountain View woman was
sexually assaulted Sunday within
blocks of the Stanford campus.
The 35-year-old victim was as
saulted between 1:30 a.m. and 2:45
a.m. near the 4(M) block of Leland
Avenue in Palo Alto. Police found
her lying unconscious in a carport
after being called to the scene bv a
local resident.
Prior the being attacked, the
victim had been dining at the Sun
dance Mining Company at the cor
ner of El Camino Real and Leland
Avenue, where she had consumed

some amount of alcohol. She has
no memory of events from the time
she was in the restaurant until the
time she was discovered by police;
however, police do not yet know it
her memory loss is attributable to
anything other than alcohol.
At this time police have no de
scription of the suspect. Anyone
with information about the attack
— or who may have seen the victim
in the restaurant prior to the as
sault — is encouraged to call Palo
Alto Detective Ron Watson at
