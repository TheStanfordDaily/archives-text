WOMEN'S LACROSSE

■ Today: Stanford (14-4, 7-1 West
ern Women's Lacrosse League) at
Santa Clara.

The women have only dropped
one game to a league opponent all
season. They've been sure not to
leave anything to chance, outscoring
their conference rivals 90-35.
Wednesday's game shouldn't be any
different.
"We definitely can't look past this
game, especially because they could
have improved dramatically, and we
can't afford to let the No. 1 seed posi
tion slip away from us," said senior
co-captain Alexis Patrizio.
Stanford clobbered Santa Clara
18-3 earlier in the season, but regard
less of the competition that Santa
Clara provides today the team can
still use the game as preparation for
the Final Four.
"We will look at this game as an
other chance to hone our skills and
continue to focus on the playoffs and
the championship." said head coach
Heidi Connor.
The team has been working on
such skills as fast breaks and transi
tion. and so far they've been satisfied
with their improvement. Working as
a team will continue to be crucial as

they move into tourney time.
"Santa Clara has absolutely noth
ing to lose and everything to gain by
beating us. so they will be sure to try
their hardest." Patrizio said. "I think
we are going to concentrate on mak
ing our plays run smoothly and to
clean up any loose ends that we need
to really bring our game together."
In a game that has the potential to
be completely lopsided, the team has
to be careful not to play down to the
level of their opponents.
"Both our offense and defense
have been playing well and really
pulling together as evidence by the
past few games." said freshman Car
oline Osterwise. "We can't lose focus
going into the playoffs. Lately we've
been on an upswing. We need to hit a
peak going into the final weeks of the
season."
Connor is relying heavily on
freshman talent to lead the team. She
cited freshmen Caroline Osterwise
and Patti Zettler — along with
sophomore Katharine Barnes — as
players who can "come through for
Stanford in a big way in the tight situ
ations." She also noted the play of
freshmen defense wings Jenny Sil
verman and Emily Rodriguez.
"This duo has become a huge
scoring threat as we neared the close
of the season." Connor said. "They
have gained confidence in their play
and they are unstoppable on the
field. They both possess incredible
speed and have developed a fast
break shot that is just awesome."
With such a strong freshman class,
the team's outlook is good for not
only the Final Four, but also the sea
sons to come, which will keep Stan
ford as a threat in the WWLL.
