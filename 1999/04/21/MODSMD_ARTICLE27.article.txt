Alter failing to qualify for last
year's National Championships,
the No. 12 men's gymnastics team
has surprised everyone by earning
a spot in this year's competition
April 22-24. The Cardinal earned
the coveted berth after upsetting
No. 7 Oklahoma to finish in third
place at the NCAA West Regional.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Thursday-Saturday: No. 12 Stan
ford will compete in NCAA Cham
pionshipsin Nebraska.

The top three finishers in each
of the two divisions (East and
West) qualify for the champi
onship. In the West. No. 5 Nebras
ka — who will host the meet —
qualified by virtue of a first-place
finish at Regionals. No. 1 1
Brigham Young took second place
and the second spot and the Cardi
nal upset the Sooners to capture
the final berth. In the Eastern divi
sion. it was No. 1 Michigan, No. 2
Ohio State and No. 4 Penn State
who won the chance to compete for
a national title.
This meet will feature the most
difficult competitors that Stanford
has faced this season. All of this
year's participants occupy a higher
place in the rankings than Stan
ford, and the Cardinal has yet to
face any teams ranked higher than
fifth — of which there are three in
this year's competition.
Stanford has performed poorly
against teams the first time they
meet, and since the field includes
three previously unknown teams,
this fact will likely play a major
role.
Another crucial factor that
could adversely affect the Cardinal
is its youth and relative lack of ex
perience. For more than three
fourths of the team, this will be the
first venture into the NCAA
Championships. Add to that the
fact that half of the team consists of
freshmen who have yet to experi
ence the NCAA postseason, and
what you get is a team that could
have a tough time.
In any case, the team will gain
some much needed experience this

weekend. Although Stanford does
not have the optimal level of devel
opment at this point, the young
Cardinal gymnasts have been lull
of surprises this season and if they
place in the top three it would cer
tainly be another surprise.
This season. Stanford has man
aged to surprise many teams by
pulling off a large number of up
sets. In the Cardinal Open, Stan

ford surprised California hy
putting an end to the Bears 48-
meet winning streak — a run that
lasted almost three years. Cal is the
defending national champion and
had beaten the Cardinals in 15
straight meets.

setting No. 7 Oklahoma, the Cardinal earned the opportunity to con
tinue into postseason NCAA competition, which begins tomorrow.
