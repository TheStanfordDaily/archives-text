### Ramona Shelburne Staff writer 
After months of practice, preparation and competition, it all comes down
to one meet.
In a season filled with record-setting performances and momentous victo
ries. ultimately, the eighth-ranked Stanford women's gymnastics team will
judge its 1999 season by its performance at the NCAA Championships to
morrow through Saturday in Salt Lake City.
The Cardinal qualified for nationals for the first time since 1996 on April 10
with its victory at the Region Four Championship in Baton Rouge. La. Stan
ford edged second-place Louisiana State 194.675-194.6(H) for the win. but both
teams automatically qualified for the national tournament.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Today-Saturday: Stanford competes in NCAA Championships in Utah.

"Really this is iess pressured than Regionals because nobody in the gym
nastics community is really expecting us to win," said junior co-captain Kim
Young. "I think that we can go and surprise some people."
And in a tournament where the winner will be crowned based on two days
of competition. Young just might be right. The Cardinal has shown flashes of
brilliance this season and if it can put together two days of solid gymnastics,
Stanford stands a realistic shot at scoring an upset.
Also, even though the Cardinal is not favored to win this weekend. Stan
ford does bring some important advantages into Thursday afternoon's pre
liminary qualifying round. The Cardinal was randomly placed into a group
with three teams that it has defeated this season—No. 5 LSIJ, No. 9 Arizona
State and No. 15 UCLA — and another team, No. 20 West Virginia, who en
ters the competition as the lowest-ranked team in the field. The other team in
Stanford's preliminary qualifying group is second-ranked Alabama.
In order to advance to Friday night's team finals, the Cardinal will need to
finish among the top three in its qualifying group. The other three teams in Fri
day's final will come from Thursday night's qualifying group.
Although the preliminary qualifying groups were randomly selected, it ap
pears that Stanford's group is the weaker of the two. Five of the top seven
teams from Regional competition were placed in the Thursday evening group,
including defending champion and top-ranked Georgia. Also in the Thursday
night group is host Utah, who enters the meet ranked third in the nation. No.
4 Michigan, No. 6 Penn State, No. 7 Nebraska, and No. 10 Florida.
Besides being placed in the weaker side of the draw, the Cardinal will look
to capitalize on its early-season meet against the Utes at the Jon M. Huntsman
Center. And having the experience of competing in front of a Utah crowd is
no small advantage. The Utes have averaged 10.568 fans at their six home
meets this season and will most likely top that number this weekend.

"I think it's great that we've al
ready been there," Young said.
"Utah is a great place for gymnastics,
their fans are really loud and knowl
edgeable."
But rankings, brackets and early
season experiences aside, the real de
terminant of Stanford's fate will be
the Cardinal itself. Will the confi
dent, record-breaking team that Ari
zona State coach John Spini predict
ed was the team to beat in the Pacific
10 Conference show up? Or will it be
the shaky team that lost to lowly Ari
zona and finished fourth at the con
ference championships?
According to Young, the Cardi
nal has learned from its missteps this
season. "I think what we've learned
to do is not focus on the scores and
just to go out and do our gymnastics."
Leading the Cardinal this week
end will be senior Amy Murakami,
who enters the competition ranked
third in the nation on the uneven par
allel bars and seventh in the floor ex
ercise. Junior All-American Larissa
Fontaine will make only her second
appearance since recovering from a
broken finger that has kept her out of
the Cardinal lineup. Fontaine will
look to defend her 1998 individual
championship on the vault. Last
week in Louisiana, Fontaine finished
third in that event with a 9.800 in her
first competition since Jan. 22.
