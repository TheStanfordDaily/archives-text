After a disappointing weekend
which saw the Cardinal go winless in
four games in Arizona, Stanford cap
italized on its break from intense Pa
cific 10 Conference competition.
"We are excited to get back on a
winning streak," said junior catcher
Kellie Wiginton
After scoring only two runs total
in the four games in Arizona, the 13
runs in two games against the Spar
tans were promising entering the sec
ond half of conference competition.
Particularly encouraging for Stan
ford was its offensive production,
which has been lagging of late.
"We knew we had to work on
things offensively, such as two-out
hitting and executing with runners in
scoring position," said Stanford head
coach John Rittman. "We did a good
job executing today."
Wiginton elaborated on the Car
dinal's solid offense.
"We did a much better job as a
team of clutch hitting. We've been
leaving runners on base, but today
we did a good job not stranding
them."
Stanford was quick to pounce on
the Spartans as it jumped out to a 3-0
lead in the first inning of game one.
Freshman centerfielder Jessica
Mendoza towered the first pitch she
saw of the day over the right-center
field fence, bringing home Wiginton
and senior shortstop Michelle
Schneider. The home run was Men
doza's team-leading ninth of the sea
son.
The Cardinal added another run
in the third as Schneider scored
again, this time on a triple by fresh

man Robin Walker. Schneider had
reached base on a bunt, then stole
second. Walker had two hits and
three RBIs in the game and finished
the day with four hits and five RBIs.
As insurance, Stanford tallied
three more runs in the fifth, piecing
together singles by Wiginton, Men
doza. Walker and senior pitcher
Marcy Crouch.
San Jose State's only run came in
the top of the seventh on a solo home
run by junior designated player Kim
Bentley.
Crouch improved her record to
19-7 with the win, while sophomore
pitcher Asia Easley fell to 3-13.

Game two saw the Cardinal come
out firing once again, and a strong
pitching performance by senior
Becky Blevins (15-8) held the Spar
tans to just two hits. Blevins, who is
returning to form after being injured,
also only walked one batter while
striking out seven.
"Becky is back," said Wiginton,
her catcher. "She was definitely on
today and has her confidence back."
While Blevins kept the Spartans
scoreless, Stanford's offense kept
shooting. The Cardinal combined 10
hits, nine of which were singles, to put
