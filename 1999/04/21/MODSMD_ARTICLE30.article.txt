# Sailing takes 3rd over weekend

### Becky Blanchard 
Last weekend seemed tm) short
for the Stanford sailing team. At the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association team racing
championship regatta, the No. 15
Cardinal sailors needed more time
to come up with a winning combina
tion in order to secure one of two na
tional berths. Unfortunately, Stan
ford not only battled lack of team
racing experience, but also calm
conditions and fast competition to
end the weekend in third place.
"We had too many problems to
overcome in one short weekend,"
said Stanford head coach Steve
Bourdow. "We had fun. We wanted
to be second, but it just wasn't in the
cards. We sailed pretty well. We've
definitely come a long way."
USC and UC-Santa Barbara,
who finished one-two. respectively,
will advance to the IYRA team rac
ing championship in St. Petersburg,
I la. According to Bourdow, the
sixth-ranked I rojans were no sur
prise for the district championship.
I le expects them to finish in the top
live at the national race and possibly
in the 112 inal Four.
Stanford challenged No. lb Santa
Barbara in Sunday's 112 inal Four rac
ing. However, the Cardinal's solid
tactics could not overcome the
speed of the young (iauchos. Stan

ford was followed by 12th-ranked
Hawaii.
Conditions at Long Beach were
not favorable for the Cardinal,
whose team focus is sailing well in
medium to heavy winds. The calm
air and flat water allowed the (iau
chos, who fare well in non-windy
conditions, to outrun the Stanford
squad.
"When the winds are stronger,
we're stronger," Bourdow said. "I
believe that when you're dominant
in heavy air, you're going to win race
after race. If you're dominant in
light winds, well, those are more ran
dom. You have a good chance of
ending up in, say, l()th place in
windy conditions. Training for wind,
we physically work very hard, so
we're used to that."
Junior skipper Tyler Doyle and
junior crewmember Caroline Sumpf
had a strong performance over the
weekend. According to Bourdow,
Doyle, a team co-captain, and
Sumpf led the team throughout the
regatta, though their speed some
times put them at a disadvantage to
execute team tactics away from
other ('ardinal boats.
Sophomore skipper Heather
Porter and junior crewmember
Katie (iregg also had a solid perfor
mance in the second position for the
Cardinal. They were especially
strong in Sunday's races.

"They really started to nail their
blocking maneuvers,"Bourdow
said. "Heather really turned it on."
Junior skipper Anika Leerssen,
junior crewmember Alexis
Krivkovich and sophomore skipper
Jeff Condon rounded out the Stan
ford squad. Bourdow switched the
team lineup throughout the two-day
regatta, trying to determine the best
three boats to put on the water, de
pending on conditions, competition
and how sailors were feeling.
"[ln team racing] three people
have to work very much together,
and they have to read each other's
minds,"Bourdow said. "You have to
know what your teammates can do.
We did a lot of switching, depending
on how [team members] were feel
ing. We never really figured out the
best [three-boat] combination to
have on the water at once. That was
one of our problems."
However, he said the team did
learn from the round-robin compe
tition and that team members are
more willing now than at the begin
ning of the season to practice and
race in the team-racing format. This
season's remaining races are all fleet
races, in which the Cardinal usually
excels. The women's team travels to
Hawaii this weekend for the
PCIYRA women's district champi
onship, in which it expects qualify
for a national berth.
