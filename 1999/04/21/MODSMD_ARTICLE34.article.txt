# Sally Glynn runs past injuries to lead Stanford pack
## 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
How can a 25-time state champ
and 13-time high-school All-Ameri
can in track and field make a low-key
entrance to Stanford's amazing ath
letic program? Just ask junior Sally
Glynn.
Glynn came to the Farm in the
fall of 1996 as one of the most deco
rated athletes to ever be recruited by
the Cardinal track team. A three

time Penn Relay champion in the
high-school 1,500 meters and two
time Millrose high-school mile
champion, as well as a runner-up in
the Footlocker Cross Country
Championships in 1994, the
Rockville, Md., native seemed des
tined to make a significant and im
mediate impact.
Two obstacles stood in her way: a
great team and injuries.
The first was as positive an obsta
cle as one can wish for. The women's

cross country team was stocked with
talent, including last year's 3,000-
meter champion Monal Chokshi.
Glynn simply couldn't step into a
leading role on the team that went
on to win the national champi
onship.
While it may seem ironic that the
reason Glynn came to Stanford
the cohesive team — was keeping
her from standing out. a mildly dis
appointing cross country season was
still much easier to deal with then

watching track from the stands. In
juries forced the freshman to red
shirt both the indoor and outdoor
seasons.
Stanford assistant coach Beth Al
ford-Sullivan works with the women
distance runners daily. She thinks
that a difficult freshman year may
have helped Sally in some ways.
"I think that Sally was able to
take advantage of having redshirted
the track season by taking advantage
of the experience and then being
able to apply it when she was
healthy." Sullivan said. "But it was
an advantage that she was forced
into."
Glynn's sophomore year was a
complete turnaround for her. In
crosscountry, she consistently ran as
the Cardinal's No. 4 runner during
the regular season and then stepped
it up even further in the postseason.
After placing third overall at the
Western Regional qualifier, Glynn
earned her first All-America award
by placing 20th at NC'AAs. where
Stanford was edged by BYU for the
team title. In both the qualifying race
and nationals, Glynn was Stanford's
second runner to finish.
Her success carried over to out
door track, where as a redshirt fresh
man, she earned another All-Amer
ica award by finishing ninth in the
3,000-meter run.
"Last year was really my first
solid year." said (ilynn. "It was basi
cally a stepping stone for me. I didn't
accomplish everything I wanted to.
yet I got the experience I needed."
Despite Glynn's success, her
name was not a fixture in the minds
of most track and field fans when

talking about the Stanford team. In
large part that was due to freshman
phenom Julia Stamps. Unlike
Glynn, Stamps was able to step in
her freshman year in cross country
and lead the team, finishing fourth at
NCAAs and running as Stanford's
top woman in every race. Then, in
Cilynn's Ail-American track perfor
mance, the 3,(KK) meters, teammate
Monal Chokshi shocked the crowd
with an upset win. making Glynn's
performance seem only good.
Anyone who follows collegiate
women's track, not just Stanford's
team, better have heard of Glynn
this year. During the fall, she played
second fiddle to Stamps in cross
country the entire season before
having a huge breakthrough at
NCAAs to grab fifth place as the
first Cardinal runner across the line.
Then after being slowed by a minor
injury in the beginning of the indoor
season, Sally had another All-Amer
ican performance at nationals in the
1.5(H) meters, finishing seventh.
During the current outdoor sea
son. Glynn has shown that she is still
on the rise. At the Stanford Invita
tional, she ran her first 5,000-meter
race in 16 minutes, 22 seconds, cur
rently the lOth-best time in the na
tion this season and well under the
provisional qualifying mark. Then
after running a 4:39 1.600-meter
relay split on April 10, Glynn came
out last Friday night at the Mt. San
Antonio College Relays and ran a
blazing 3,(KK) meters. Her seventh
place finish in a personal best time of
9:18.4 gave her first automatic quali
fier as well as fifth place on this sea
son's performance list.

Obviously Glynn's coaches, Sulli
van and head track and field coach
Vin Lananna, believed in her talent
to recruit her, but beyond pure po
tential they see several reasons for
her tremendous improvement this
year.
"The majority of what you do [in
distance running] is conditioning,"
Lananna said. "What Sally has been
able to do is read her body well. She
has been able to seek out what work
outs and what training she can use to
push herself to the limit."
Lananna sees Glynn as a calculat
ed runner, not a competitor who just
runs hard from the gun to exhaus
tion.
With the improved conditioning,
he feels that she has been able to
plan her races better, usually finish
ing a race very strongly.
Sullivan feels Glynn has matured
in more than just physical condition.
"She's grown in her composure
for competition. Not only in the
training and workouts, but in her
preparation for competition — her
composure has done well," said Sul
livan.
Both coaches agree that she has
just started to tap her talent.
After graduation, Glynn will
most likely stick with her newest
event, the 5,000, as the 3,000 isn't
contested on the international level.
"I think that the 2(KK) Olympics
are unrealistic as for making the
Olympic team," said Glynn. "As far
as Olympic trials go [in 2(XX)], why
not aim for it? Once I graduate, 2(X)4
sounds a lot better. I'm only 20. In
2(X)4, I'll be 25, so I still have a ways
to go."

plan her races better, usually finish
ing a race very strongly.
Sullivan feels Glynn has matured
in more than just physical condition.
"She's grown in her composure
for competition. Not only in the
training and workouts, but in her
preparation for competition — her
composure has done well," said Sul
livan.
Both coaches agree that she has
just started to tap her talent.
After graduation, Glynn will
most likely stick with her newest
event, the 5,000, as the 3,000 isn't
contested on the international level.
"I think that the 2(KK) Olympics
are unrealistic as for making the
Olympic team," said Glynn. "As far
as Olympic trials go [in 2(XX)], why
not aim for it? Once I graduate, 2(X)4
sounds a lot better. I'm only 20. In
2(X)4, I'll be 25, so I still have a ways
to go."
