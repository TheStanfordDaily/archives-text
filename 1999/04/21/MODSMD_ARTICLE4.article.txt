# Grad residence option lost
## U.S. Army takes Moffett housing 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
A last-minute agreement be
tween the U.S. Army Corps of En
gineers and the U.S. Air Force has
forced Stanford administrators to
abandon plans to house University
affiliates at Moffett Federal Air
field in Mountain View.
Stanford had been negotiating
with NASA / Ames Research Cen
ter to move graduate students, fac
ulty and post-graduate students
into the housing, but the Army
Corps of Engineers expressed in
terest in the property. The Air
Force, compelled by federal law,
turned the housing over to the
Army.
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning, said the loss
of the potential housing at Moffett
Field was unexpected. "We're only
surprised that the Army had not ex
pressed an interest until very, very
recently," he said.
"We were in the process of talk
ing to NASA about taking advan
tage of the opportunity," he said,
specifying that NASA was applying
for the housing, not Stanford.

Frank
Rezac, a
spokesman for
the Army Corps
of Engineers,
told the San Jose
Mercury News
that the mili
tary's interest in
" Moffett Field

came as a result of potential rent in
creases for military families living
at the Presidio and other Bay Area
bases. The Presidio is a decommis
sioned military base in San Francis
co.
Graduate Student Council
member Robert Rudnitsky, a doc
toral student in applied physics,
said, "It's disappointing for Stan
ford graduate students as well as for
faculty and staff, but I hope and ex
pect that the University will contin
ue to pursue other onions."
Harri: Shapiro, a member of the
Graduate Student Counci' and a
doctoral student in physics, agreed
that the rejection of the housing
proposal was "unfortunate."
"The University was looking at

[Moffett Field] as an option, hoping
it would provide up to several hun
dred places," Shapiro said. "This
year's housing draw will probably
result in several hundred being
kicked off campus. We're still
working with [the administration]
to find other options."
Cox said it was unclear how
many students would have been
housed at Moffett. "We knew that
some would have been renovated
and some used by military person
nel. There would have been 200 to

400 people possibly housed."
"There is an almost unlimited
need for housing," Cox said. "It was
an opportunity that seemed worth
pursuing, but it didn't work out."
"In pursuing this option, the
University was being very creative
and aggressive in the way that they
were finding a solution to the hous
ing crisis that affects graduate stu
dents, faculty and staff. Assuming
that they continue that level of cre
ativity and proactive approach,
they will be able to come up with
some good solutions." Rudnitsky
said.
NASA and Army officials were
unavailable for comment.
