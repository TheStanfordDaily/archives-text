# Author tells women to have children first
## 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
Young women should consider
marriage and motherhood in their
early- to mid-20s and postponing
careers until alter their children
are in school, said Danielle Crit
tenden. author of the new hook
"What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us
— Why Happiness Eludes the
Modern Woman," at a public poli
cy forum sponsored by Stanford In
Government and the Hoover Insti
tute yesterday afternoon.
The new goal for women. Crit
tenden said, is not equality but
happiness.
"We can have it all. but just not
all at once." she said.
Speaking to an informal group

of female and male st'id -fits eating
pizza and fruit, Crittenden blamed
the feminist movement for urging
women to zealously pursue careers
at the most flexible and energetic
times of their lives.
"We plot our career paths so
precisely but not what may be the
most important thing in life." she
said.
Crittenden also blamed femi
nists for turning women off from
homemaking and child-rearing,
distinctly feminine aspects of life,
she said.
Drawing a parallel to the idea of
"the problem with no name" in
Betty Friedan's seminal work,
"The Feminine Mystique," Crit-
tenden argued that, "Today we
must recognize a new problem.
While we see ourselves as human,
we deny parts of us that are fe
male."
Crittenden cited polls and anec
dotes as evidence that modern
women are more confused and un
happy than ever.
"Yes, we are freer to hold posi
tions of power," she said. "But we
are also more likely to be divorced,
single, have abortions. . , . I've
heard accomplished women com
plain that they don't have the
choices their mothers had."
Her solution for those women
who do want children and a career
is to marry young, stay home with
the children until they start school
and then have a career.
"We should accept that pushing
everything outside of work to the
middle of life is the opposite of we
should do," she said.
As for why women and not men
should take responsibility for child
care, Crittenden said women often
want to stay at home with children.
"Your chest leaks when the
baby cries and his doesn't," she

said. "When you have a kid, some
body is gonna have to give. Is it so
weird that women do it?" she said.
No stranger to controversy,
Crittenden acknowledged her crit
ics.
"As a journalist and critic of
feminism. I've been accused of
sending women back," she said. "If
I wish to name drop, I should name
my critics."
According to Crittenden, these
critics include Betty Friedan. Erica
Jung and Susan Estrich, who has
called Crittenden, "a modern day
bunny."
"She reminds me of the authors
of'The Rules' " said junior Juliana
Adelman, who attended the talk
and is editor of Stanford's progres
sive women's magazine Women
speak.
Crittenden said her challenge
was to reckon honestly with the de
sires and expectations of women.
"Fulfillment from life comes not
just from work but from doing
what's best for those you care
about." she said.
Crittenden was founding editor
of Women's Quarterly magazine
and has written for various nation
al publications. She lives in Wash
ington, D.C., with her husband and
two children.
