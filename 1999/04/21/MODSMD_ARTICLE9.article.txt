# Amendment implementation begins
## 
### Alice Brown Staff writer 
Now that the ASSU constitutional amendment
"An ASSU For All Students: Effective Advocacy
& Improved Programming" has been approved by
the student body, new student leaders are working
on its implementation.
The amendment cannot be put into effect, how
ever, until it is approved by University President
Gerhard Casper. ASSU President Maren Norton,
a senior, will present the amendment to him after
the ASSU certifies it May 4.
Appendix A, section 9 of the amendment con
tains a letter from Casper offering comments on
the amendment. "You can see from the remainder
of this letter that Casper very carefully read the
amendment, and mostly offered only some clarifi
cations of p(x>r!y worded text," ASSU graduate
senator David Robinson said.
Casper's comments were supportive. "The Uni
versity subscribes to the view that the student body
should be given wide latitude in creating the forms
and functions of student government... such as the

structure and composition of the legislative and ex
ecutive branches," Casper said. " These amend
ments ... create no significant issues."
The ASSU's transition "will be as short as pos
sible," said ASSU Vice President-elect John Mills,
a doctoral student in genetics, and will include "ini
tial meetings of the Executive Committee, com
posed of the ASSU President and Vice President,
the GSC Chair and Financial Officer, the Under
graduate Senate leadership, and the ASSU Finan
cial Manager. These meetings will be important for
mapping out our meeting schedule and planning
our efforts for coordinating the two legislative bod
ies throughout the coming year."
Mills and ASSU President-elect Mike Levin, a
sophomore, also plan to "meet with each of the
newly elected undergraduate senators in order to
learn their goals for the year and to see how we can
integrate their ideas into our own platform," Mills
said.
Physics doctoral student and GSC member
Harris Shapiro said, "My hope is that the transition
period will last until the last senate meeting of this
quarter so that the new system can smoothly pick

up where the current system leaves off."
The amendment also contains a "transition pro
cedure" for filling the seats of the new Graduate
Student Council. Every person elected to the
Graduate Student Senate and to the GSC is on the
new GSC.
"In theory, this can produce more than the
eventual 15 elected representatives," explained
Shapiro. "However, the amendment also has a pro
vision that as people in excess of the 15 eventual
members resign, their seats cannot be refilled, so
that we'll approach 15 elected members as the year
passes."
According to Mills, the GSC will be electing a
new chair for next year over the course of the next
two GSC meetings and "preparing itself for the
transition in general."
Transition projects for the GSC include, ac
cording to the tentative agenda for Thursday's
GSC meeting, new member orientation, timeline
for the selection of an interim chair and financial of
ficer, general fees, an Alumni Association repre
sentative. office space, meeting location, computer
equipment, graduate student finances and bylaws.
