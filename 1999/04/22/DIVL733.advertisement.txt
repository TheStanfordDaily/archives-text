et's Eat....
In search of his roots, Adrien insisted on trying
another French bistro, "Bistro Elan." Located on restau
rant-rich California Avenue, Bistro Elan offers friendly,
knowledgeable service and good food in a cozy environ
ment. While we were initially intimidated by the large
table of Stanford professors next to us, we were eventu
ally able to overcome our fears and enjoy our meal.
Though the entrance to the restaurant is hidden by
plants, once inside you are swept up by the scent of
French cuisine, which is intensified by the open kitchen.
The smallness of the restaurant provides intimacy with
out claustrophobia, and the full mirror on the wall next
to our table gave David the opportunity to fulfill his fan
tasy of watching himself eat. The simple, cream colored
decor and French accents emanating from the kitchen
simulate a dining experience on the French Riviera.
The most pleasant surprise of the evening was our
kind and extremely knowledgeable waiter, Patrick. Fie
provided us with intimate descriptions of both our
foods and wine. Though we are probably easily
impressed, we still found his services to be a great boon
to our meal. With Patrick's recommendations, we were
able to weed our way through the complex items on the
menu and order wisely.
We began our meal by trying an assortment of appe
tizers. Adrien decided to start with a wild mushroom
and fromage blanc tart. The fromage blanc, a type of
house-made cottage cheese, provided a pleasantly mild
contrast to the earthy flavor of the wild mushrooms.
David decided to try the Bistro's layered salmon cake,
which consisted of alternating layers of salmon and
thinly crisped bread. This unique dish was more enjoy
able as a novelty item than as an appetizer due to its
extreme saltiness.
Though we were both divided on our opinions of the
appetizers, we were unanimous in our enjoyment of the
remainder of the meal. For our main dishes, Adrien
enjoyed the duck confit with an Italian double cream
cheese risotto. The duck was tender and the classic
orange sauce perfectly complimented the fowl.
Furthermore, the richness of the risotto was certainly
worth the impending heart attack. Adrien highly rec
ommends this exquisite dish. David opted for scallops in
wine jus. This light dish was perfect because it left room
for the ever important, and in this case incredibly rich,
dessert.
We concluded our meal with a banana, chocolate and
cream pastry with caramelized bananas on top. To say
that this was the best dessert of our eating excursions
thus far is a bold understatement. The banana chocolate
cream inside of the dessert puts the world's best banana
split to shame. All in all, we highly recommend Bistro
Elan to students looking for a spirited, nice meal.
