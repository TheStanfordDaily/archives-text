# Chess champ to speak
## Kasparov on 'Limits of Performance' panel 
### Sylee Gore Staff writer 
Chess grandmaster Garry Kas
parov comes to Stanford tonight as
part of the symposium on the "Lim
its of Performance," presented by
the Stanford Presidential Lectures
in the Humanities series.
As part of his talk, he will partic
ipate in a discussion with five pan
elists, including Stanford Football
coach Tyrone Willingham and se
nior Adrian Keatinge-Clay, who is a
national master in chess. At
lunchtime today, he will discuss
Russian politics and economics at
noon in the Slavic Department. He
will also meet with the Cardinal
Chess Club.
Kasparov was born in 1963 in
Azerbaijan and began playing chess
at the age of four. By 1955, he de
feated Anatoly Karpov and gained
the title of world chess champion at
22, becoming the youngest person
ever to hold that title.
To date, he remains undefeated
by any human player, though his
most notorious bout of publicity
came with his loss to IBM chess
computer "Deeper Blue" in 1997.
The loss itself was fraught with
controversy, a situation heightened
by IBM's refusal to release print
outs of the machine's reasoning
processes and by the subsequent
dismantling of the machine.
During an interview with the In

ternet Chess Club, Kasparov was
asked if future world champions will
continue to get stronger. I le replied,
"Probably, but with heavy influence
of computers I think it will be more
about changing attitude and ap-

proach rather than strength."
Alongside his chess-playing,
Kasparov maintains ;i strong inter
est in politics. In a recent Wall Street
Journal article, he discussed the ar
rest of Chilean General Augusto
Pinochet and his views on Commu

nism.
Kasparov wrote, '"Progressive
mankind 1 is celebrating the arrest of
Augusto Pinochet. Justice will be
done and a signal sent to the world's
dictators. Never mind that the re
sponse from Baghdad, Tripoli and
Beijing has been little more than a
yawn."
He went on to critique Western
intellectuals who "have lauded the
'great experiment' conducted by
Marxist leaders, while ignoring the
brutal practical application
Siberian labor camps, Chinese rural
communities â€” of the theories so
fashionable in prestigious universi
ties and magazines."
Cardinal Chess Club members
are excited about the upcoming
event. Kasparov will address the
team in the Bechtel Center at 2 p.m.,
after which he will observe a "blitz
tournament" to be played by the
members.
"He's definitely the best chess
player in the world now. and possi
bly the best chess player ever." said
freshman Etan llfeld. a member of
the chess club. "To hear him speak
is a once-in-a-lifetime chance."
Keatinge-Clay, president of the
chess club, will be introducing Kas
parov as well as serving on the dis
cussion panel.
"I view this as the culminating
event of mv time here at Stanford."

he said. Keatinge-Clay said he
hopes to elicit Kasparov's views on

the future of the world champion
title and on the political situation in
Azerbaijan.
The "Limits of Performance"
symposium will be held May 7 and
<S. Topics will include the role of lim

its in athletics, medicine, the hu
manities and other fields.
Kasparov will speak tonight at 7
p.m. in the SEQ Teaching Center.
Room 200. At noon, he will appear
in Building4oo, Room 41-J.
