## Secretary of State worries Kosovo conflict might spread Support NATO, Albright says 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright expressed concern yesterday that
the Kosovo conflict might be spreading into Montene
gro, Yugoslavia's smaller pro-Western republic.
She also asked Congress to support the NATO cam
paign — but not to declare war.
"We think declaration of war would have a number of
negative effects, such as NATO cohesion, regional sta
bility and our relations with Russia." Albright told the
House International Relations Committee.
The panel was meeting later to take up several mea
sures related to the War Powers Act. including resolu
tions to either declare war formally on Yugoslavia or
withdraw U.S. participation in the NATO campaign.
There did not appear to be widespread support for either
measure.
Albright said there was fresh worry about Serbian
involvement in Montenegro, where many ethnic Albani
ans have lied from Kosovo.
She said she had been in close touch with Montene
grin President Milo Djukanovic, a stern critic of Milose

vic. Djukanovic was reported to have rejected demands
by the Yugoslav army that he put his republic's police
force under Belgrade's control.
Any Serbian "incursions into Montenegro would
have serious consequences," Albright said.
Albright also said that under discussion was a British
proposal to create some kind of international protected
area within Kosovo that would allow self-government
with an international protective force.
"I think it is very hard to imagine that the Kosovar
people could go back and just live easily side by side with
the Serbs who have committed these kinds of atrocities,"
she said.
Congress also was considering the administration's
emergency spending request for $6 billion to help con
tinue the air war through September, if necessary, and to
pay refugee-related costs.
House GOP leaders said they anticipated making the
measure even larger to help meet some longer-term
needs of the Pentagon such as buying more weapons and
ammunition and dealing with a personnel shortage.
