# Chemical harming ozone in decline

(AP) — The level of ozone
depleting chemicals in the atmo
sphere is falling, mostly because of
reductions in one solvent, meaning
further cuts can occur only if emis
sions of other chemicals are lowered,
researchers say.
"We have made progress, but
we're not out of the woods yet," said
Stephen A. Montzka of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis
tration.
The researchers monitored levels
of the chemicals at remote locations
worldwide between 1992 and 1997.
Levels were found to have declined
about 3 percent. The findings were
published in last Thursday's issue of
the journal Nature.
Production of a solvent called
methyl chloroform was phased out
between 1993 and 1996. Levels of

the chemical have dropped almost in
half since then because of produc
tion cuts and the substance's five
year lifespan in the atmosphere, the
researchers said.
That decrease accounted for so
much of the drop in ozone-depleting
chemicals that if methyl chloroform
were ignored, the overall level would
have been increasing in 1997, the
researchers said.
Other chemicals such as (TC-12,
a refrigerant, and (T'C-11. used to
make foam, are si ill present at more
than twice the peak levels of methyl
chloroform.
Although ("PCs are regulated.
CFC-12 levels actually rose, while
(TCI 1 declined slightly.
In addition, atmospheric levels of
one firefighting chemical. 11-1211.
continued to increase despite the

availability of alternatives. 11-1211 is
particularly troubling because it con
tains bromine, a potent ozone
destroyer.
The ozone layer protects the
Earth from excessive ultraviolet
light, which has been linked to skin
cancer.
Ozone depletion has been the
most severe over the Antarctic,
where an "ozone hole" appears peri
odically.
In IW. 165 nations signed the
Montreal Protocol, an agreement to
reduce levels of ozone-damaging
chemicals.
I'he quick gains in reducing
methyl chloroform are not expected
to be repeated with the CFCs. The
two chemicals are still allowed to be
made in developing countries on a
limited basis until 2010.
