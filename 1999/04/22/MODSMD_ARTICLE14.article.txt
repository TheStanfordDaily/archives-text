LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -
Isaiah 'Shoels was shot in the head
because he was the wrong color and
in the wrong place at the wrong
time â€” a black man in the
Columbine High School library at
11:30 a.m.
Shoels, 18, who dreamed of
becoming a music executive, was
shot Tuesday by two schoolmates,
who then stood in an acrid cloud of
gunsmoke and marveled at their
grisly handiwork.
"Oh my God. Look at this black
kid's brain. Awesome, man!" the
killers said, according to witnesses.
"They said they didn't like nig
gers," sophomore Evan Todd, 15,
told reporters after escaping the
library. "So they shot him in the
face."
Shoels was the only black person
among the 13 killed Tuesday by a
pair of outcast classmates cloaked in
black trench coats. Family members
confirmed his death yesterday.
Although witnesses said that the
gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Kle
bold. were gunning for minorities.
District Attorney Dave Thomas said
there was no evidence to support
that.
"I've only seen the photographs,
but it appears to me that most of the
victims were victims because of
where they were at a particular time,
not that they were sought out,"
Thomas said. "I don't know what the
motive was other than anger."
Before turning their guns on
themselves in the library, Harris and
Klebold roamed the school, shoot
ing randomly and laughing mania
cally.
They saved their worst for 45 stu
dents who were studying in the sec
ond-floor library.
The Rev. Paul Cercle, a minister
from Rochester, Ind., said his grand

daughter. Rachel Scott. 17. is pre
sumed to be one of the four young
women who were killed.
"It was a purely random shot."
Cerelc said. "It would have to be."
Rachel's stepbrother, Craig Scott,
16, was in the library and survived
the massacre only because he played
dead in a friend's pool of blood.

He later helped lead blood-spat
tered and frightened classmates to
safety.
Parents of other victims huddled
by their telephones yesterday and
held vigil at private shelters after
gathering dental records and provid
ing authorities with descriptions of
their children's clothing.
