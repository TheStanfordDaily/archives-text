Delay in resolution of
faculty housing issues
bodes ill for University

The recent move to
postpone a decision on pro
posed construction of new
faculty housing may he a step in the
wrong direction for the University in
ils attempt to manage the faculty
housing crisis.
On the one hand, it is hard to fault
the administration for an effort to
consider the concerns of its con
stituents.
The current delay, which will
allow the Housing Task Force to
consider other options besides infill
construction on open spaces, is cer
tainly indicative of the administra
tion's interest in treating campus res
idents fairly.
However, given the urgent nature
of the housing situation and the
amount of time already devoted to
consideration of the options avail
able. the current postponement may
not actually serve any useful pur
pose in the long term.
Ostensibly, the task force will use
the extra time to look at options that
have previously been given little
It is unclear why, given the
amount of time taken to produce the
original proposals, none of these
options were considered earlier.
The position of many campus res
idents 011 infill construction had
already been made clear prior to this
petition; one would assume that the
implications of residents' opinions
would already have been consid

force, said that "we had already dis
cussed | issues raised by the petition]

amongst ourselves." What, then, is

accomplish?
Residents who oppose construc
tion may only seek a stalemate.
Since an endless series of delays
would have the same effect as a deci
sion not to build on open spaces, it is
not surprising that the first would be
pursued when the second seems
unlikely.
Undoubtedly, many of those
opposed to construction would be
happy to see the proposals perma
nently mired in bureaucracy.

side of the issue — namely, depart
