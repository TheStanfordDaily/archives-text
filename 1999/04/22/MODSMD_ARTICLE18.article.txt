# From the trenches
## The 						right way to hero worship 
### 
Erin Bouchier

ONE DAY IN my
lOth-grade chem
istry class, an
inventive substitute teach
er, hindered by a notable
lack of any knowledge of
chemistry, decided to

spend the class period dis
cussing heroes. She asked each student to
name the person that he or she most
admired. With maybe three exceptions, she
received a response of either Michael Jordan
or Grandpa.
Michael, master of the slam, and Gramps,
wlui is probably known for things other than
his fadeaway jumper, seem worlds apart.
How are they both heroes?
With respect to Air Jordan, it seems that
many people find their idols on the front of a
Wheaties Box. Every other article in a sports
magazine is about why someone is or is not
worthy of the illustrious title of role model.
Why see a sports superstar as someone
you most admire? Certainly sports stars are
talented. Some athletes are more than simply
good at what they do; some are admirable
for the disadvantages they have overcome.
Others are esteemed for the contributions
they make to local communities or for their
commitment to family, religion or education.
It's commonly held that Michael Jordan.
Wayne Gretzky and John El way are
admirable athletes. However, Mike has
turned his attentions to the golf course, the
Cireat One hung up his skates a few days ago
and Elway's retirement is imminent. With
out these three, which sports stars do we ele

vate to the idol's pedestal?
Allen Iverson has replaced Jordan atop
the list of scoring leaders. Yet the buzz
(albeit controversial) on Iverson is that his
cornrows and flashy jewelry are a bit too
ghetto for mass consumption as a hero. How
ever, the real reason that Iverson will never
attain hero status is that someone forgot to
tell him he has four other teammates out on
the floor. Sergei Federov is one of hockey's
brightest stars, and yet he fails to rise to idol
atry because he's a borderline pedophile,
dating saucy tennis star Anna Koumikova
since she was 14 and he was about 40 (or at
least way too old). The NFL is as barren as
basketball and hockey. The most exciting
player. Randy Moss, has a police record
that's difficult for a mother to love. Today's
stars seem severely lacking.
The problem isn't simply that few of
today's top stars are worthy of our admira
tion. Even the most commendable athletes
are distant, people about whom we know
only small, sound-bite-sized pieces. This is
not to say that athletes are not worthy of
respect and praise — it's simply that we
should not laud a stranger as the person we
most admire.
So if the sports world fails to provide fer
tile ground in our search for a hero, where do
we turn? It appears that the students in my
chemistry class looked towards home and
found Grandpa.
Well, what makes Grandpa admirable?
Wisdom, experience, walking 10 miles to
school in the snow? Maybe Grandpa has
risen above adversity like some of our athlet

ic idols. Maybe he immigrated to America,
struggled to learn the language and eke out a
living and through grit and determination
managed to provide a home for his family. It
seems that we expect our heroes to have
accomplished something, to have lived —
like Grandpa.
Does a hero have to be someone who is
older and more accomplished? Maybe it all
depends on how we define "hero." For some,
a hero might be someone in whose footsteps
we hope to follow. For me, the definition is
fairly simple.
My hero is the person I most admire in
this world — my very best friend. She's an
incredible judge of character. She has a clear
and strong sense of self. From every situa
tion, she manages to find a lesson and a
laugh. She enjoys herself, on her own terms.
She's a great writer (even of e-mails). Her
sense of humor is top-notch. Her talents
seem endless. And she's only 18. It seems
strange, but my younger sister is the person I
try most to emulate.
My suggestion to you is twofold. Look for
your heroes close to home, someone you
know intimately. Lcxik to your family and
friends. And look for someone you hope to
be more like everyday.
Most importantly, let your heroes know
the place they hold in your life, whether they
be Michael Jordan or Grandpa.
