Chittenden not right for everyone
My mother and I arc both physicians.
She postponed her career to raise children;
I developed my career and then started my
family. She is unhappy with her choice; I am
happy with mine. Did she make a mistake
and I make the correct choice? I think not.
I he difference in our satisfaction derives
from who we are and the circumstances we
were afforded, not from preconceived life
plans. Danielle C hittenden is mistaken if
she believes choosing to have children first
is always the right choice (as quoted in yes
terday's Daily) just as she would be mistak
en to say we all should play tennis tomor
row regardless of what the weather may
bring.
Feminism does not mandate when (or
whether) women should have children.
Rather, the feminist movement has given
women the freedom to seize opportunities
as they appear and to make choices that
best develop their lives and those of their
families.

Profs were wrong about Hoover
John Manley and Ronald Rebholz are
just as wrong today as they were in 1983

when I was director of the Hoover Institu
tion.
In addition, former Stanford president
Donald Kennedy and former trustee and
President Bill Clinton's first secretary of
state. Warren Christopher, are still just as
wrong as they were about the Reagan Pres
idential Library in the l l M)s when they
allowed a group of ideological hate mongers
to run it out of town.

Cartoon lacked compassion
To include a cartoon on the editorial
page of April 16 making "fun" of Jack
Kevorkian shows a regrettable lack of com
passion. Support in matters of compassion
from the "fun-loving" youth would be most
welcome in the face of the opposition to
compassionate action voiced by most reli
gious leaders of the established denomina
tions.

Taking Stanford daughters to work
It is an irony that in the pursuit of excel
lence, Stanford University consistently
ignores the advice of one of its own blue rib
bon committees of years past: Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare's statement that "great"

staff members are essential to a "great" uni
versity. At least, the environment for staff is
idiosyncratic and without support, and long
term success requires a narrow satisfaction
bandwidth, excellent luck and a dedication
that would better serve anyone that talent
ed in a real career.
Today, we encourage girls to come and
explore the possibilities of what they might
make of their futures during Take Our
Daughters to Work Day. 1 would be sur
prised if the jobs most women hold on this
campus are held up as the glowing template
of such a target.
Recruitment ads should read: "Come to
Stanford. We offer low-end salaries with no
stock options, unpaid overtime and the vir
tual certainty that raises and rewards, if any,
will be commensurate with your boss' sta
tus. This comes along with the studied indif
ference of anyone not directly served by
you."
If fortunate, a support staff member can
go for years without stumbling into an orga
nizational deadfall without a strong protec
tor. But there are no guarantees and no
backup system. Your rights consist of who
you know, and I've heard high-level people
admit that. (The rule of reason? What is
that?)
I'd like to share two favorite quotes from
different occasions in my own career:
"You're just a little person, Susan. What do
you expect?" and"I don't want you to be
helpful [to the department] anymore."
True, there is that high-level troubleshooter

with the funny name: the omsbudsman?
Read the first quote again.
It is a bon mot among History Depart
ment students that a perfeetly preserved
example of the medieval city-state is at
hand. Trade guilds, the distributed power
structure: it's all here in true-life reenact
ment. All it lacks is period costumes — and
you can see those on Commencement Day.
Maybe some day the University will
emerge from the Middle Ages into the
Reformation. In the meanwhile, there is a
seemingly inexhaustible supply of staff
overqualified for their positions, because
there is a special atmosphere which appeals
to the creative and intellectually robust but
underconfident or otherwise restricted
woman. We really don't see men in the
Administrative Associate series, somehow.
So let your daughters come here to see
the real positions at the University: in
world-class teaching, research and profes
sional training. Let them aim to be under
represented, with lower pay and less recog
nition, in the open, while enjoying the inher
ent risk, benefits and satisfaction of doing
their own work and being appropriately rec
ognized by their peers for it.
Bring them here, if you must. But ignore
the little people behind the curtain, the staff
volunteers. Our daughters certainly deserve
better than that.
