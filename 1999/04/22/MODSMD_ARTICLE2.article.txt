## Norton and Marroquin remember Marguerite extension, late nights 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
After nearly a year at the head of the
ASSU, President Maren Norton and Viee
President Santos Marroquin remember the
Marguerite expansion, the ASStI course
guide and the Midnight Breakfast as the
highlights in terms of achievement.
They also remember working all night on
projects or reading up before talking to ad
ministrators. and the camaraderie they felt
with their fellow ASSU workers.
As they prepare to turn over their offices
to newly elected Mike Levin and John Mills,
as president and vice-president, respective
ly. seniors Norton and Marroquin are en
thusiastic about what they've accomplished.
"I've had an ama/ing time." Norton said.
"It's going to be tough to leave. Hut there is
an awesome twosome ready to take over
and ready to learn."
"I learned a lot this year," Marroquin
said. "1 hope next year's officers can carry
on all of the projects we've started."
The successes of the year are many, but
the best patt about being in office was Work
ing with a cooperative and interested bunch
of people. Norton said.
"An overall highlight [of the year| for me
was watching an incredible group of people
in the ASStJ," she said.
"It was great watching people really get
involved and take difficult issues by the
head. We've always had one thing going for

Tve had an amazing
time. Its going to be
tough to leave.'

us an ama/ing group of people to work
with. It's been a team effort from day one."
However, the actual projects that have
been completed and continue to be worked
on deserve their time in the spotlight as well.
Norton and Marroquin agreed that one
of the ASSU's bigger efforts of the year was
expanding the service of Marguerite. Stan
lord's free shuttle. The Marguerite began
taking students into Palo Alto and also

'Involve students in
your decisions. You
need to listen to
people.'
— Santos Marroquin

started a Midnight Express run for Friday
and Saturday nights.
"People loved it and people used it,"
Marroquin said of the newly improved shut
tle.


The improvements made were
the culmination of many months'
worth of effort, Norton added.
"One of the first things we
started working on last May was
the Marguerite," she said. "We
wanted to make it a safe and vi
able option for students, and
make it more student-friendly. It's
here to stay, and now ridership is
up to about 25 per hour."
Also on the list of changes
made is the addition of the ASSU
Online Course Guide, which pro
vides a description of classes in
every department and a medium
for students to express their
thoughts about classes.
While not completely finished,
Norton said the guide is and will
he a great help to students.
"We really wanted to make a
course guide that was easy to read,
easy to use and easy to access,"
she said.
"It's definitely a step in the
right direction to making a course
guide people would actually use,"
she added.
Norton said that the large num
ber of freshmen involved in the
ASSU this year was essential.
"Freshman involvement was
wonderful," she said. "They've
worked on the Frosh Council, on
the Freshman Formal and the
Freshman Talent Show. It's great
watching frosh really get involved
and active early in their Stanford
career."
Norton and Marroquin share
many other memories of the year
— starting the online Draw Guide,
working closely with graduate stu
dents and starting the Midnight
Breakfast.
The pair say that one of the most
important things Levin and Mills
should remember as they prepare
to take office is to always stick to
what is best for students.
"The ASSU is a real student ad
vocate," Marroquin said.
"We have good relationships
with administrators, although we
respectfully disagree on some
things. Involve students in your de
cisions. You need to listen to peo

ple."
Norton added, "To be success
ful, establish mutual respect [with
administrators], but that doesn't
mean you always have to agree.
Keep students first, and never sell
out to administrators."
It is important that Levin and
Mills keep up the work that he and
Norton have begun, Marroquin
said.
"We've started a lot of great
things," he said. "It would really
hurt us if some of them fizzled."
Though they have accom
plished many projects, there is al
ways room for questioning if every
thing has been done that could
have been, Norton said.
"There is always more we could
have done," she said.
"As I get ready to hand over the

title, I ask myself, 'What didn't I
do?' One thing I wish I had done
was work more with students
groups on special fee reform. We
just ran out of time," Norton
added.
Norton maintains that the Levin
and Mills and the ASSU must con
tinue to keep their focus in mind:
students.
"Do your homework," she said.
"Ask administrators why they did
something and then ask students
what they think about it."
"When you wake up, your first
question should be, 'What can I do
for students today?' When you go
to bed, you should think to your
self, 'What didn't I do? How can I
help students more tomorrow?'
Always put students first," Norton
said.
