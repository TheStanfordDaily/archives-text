## Kosovo is complex but must be addressed 
### 
TUt: PRESENT CRISES of Ameri
can politics and foreign policy are
troubling, confusing and acute. After
being barraged with stories of a blue dress
and recorded telephone conversations, we
face startling images of starving and weary
refugees forced out of their homeland.
While the tragedy of the war in Vietnam
still resonates with the American public, the
crisis in Kosovo warrants our utmost atten
tion and commitment.
Bombing Kosovo is an easy policy to
condemn. What light does the United
States have to interfere in the affairs of
another country? Aren't these centuries-old
animosities impossible to overcome? What
il we alienate Russia so much that hard-line
Communists assume top positions and rein
vigorate Cold War antagonisms? What
about all the other countries where murder
and rampage continue?
These are valid concerns that must be
factored into U.S. policy. Interference in the
conflicts of another nation must be guided
by an international consensus, a clear mis
sion and a belief that the United States, the
world's only remaining economic and mili

tary superpower, should respond to perva
sive violations of human rights and interna
tional laws in which we believe.
Mass graves and empty villages in Bosnia
demonstrate the extent to which Slobodan
Milosevic will fight to uphold his territorial
ambitions and ethnic hatreds. They also
demonstrate the consequences of a delayed,
half-hearted political will to condemn "eth
nic cleansing" without acting forcefully to
stop it. IJ.N. peacekeepers stood by while
Serbian troops destroyed the villages the
peacekeepers had pledged to protect
because of the fear of interfering too force
fully in internal affairs.
The hostilities between Serbians and
Kosovar Albanians do go back to the 14th
century, and many Serbians do not consider
Kosovar Albanians to be a legitimate peo
ple. History does not predetermine the
future, however, and the dangers til modern
technology and propaganda warrant a
forceful effort to overcome ancient antago
nisms.
The Serbian army has the military
machinery to murder hundreds of thou
sands of Kosovar civilians. Few Kosovar

Albanians have weapons, and this partially
explains their inability to mount substantial
attacks against Serbia despite their large
numbers. Why not arm the Kosovars?
Spreading more arms in the region
would explode the war. infuriate Russia and
avoid the necessity of crafting an interna
tional consensus to halt Serbian aggression.
Severely angering Russia is the most
dangerous obstacle to a forceful, united
effort to evict Serbian troops from Kosovo.
Russia remains a superpower in every way
except financially, and Cold War alliances
do not die after eight years. We need to con
sult Russian leaders on our policy in Koso
vo and seek out ways to integrate Russia
into our decision-making process.
1 he recent signing of three former War
saw Pact countries into NATO only intensi
fied Russian fears of Western encirclement
and American domination, and Boris
Yeltsin recently raised the prospect of a
prolonged world war if NATO were to send
group troops into Kosovo. While sending in
ground troops is not an immediate necessi
ty. we must prepare for that scenario. This
preparation should involve intense diplo

macy with Russia and efforts to convince
Russian leaders that NATO actions fit their
political and economic interests.
A final concern is the apparent hypocrisy
and Eurocentrism of American foreign pol
icy. Why did we not bomb aggressive armies
in Rwanda. Indonesia or Angola? 1 cannot
provide excuses for U.S. inaction in horrific
circumstances where it might have made a
difference. Ethnic wars cannot be eliminat
ed. but we need to find structures and poli
cies to prevent and minimize them.
Towards this end. Congress should pay
its overdue bill to the United Nations. The
U.N. provides a forum where every country
has a voice (though some have louder voic
es than others) and diplomacy is the pre
ferred method of handling disputes. We
should encourage U.S. policymakers to
overcome their irrational fears and jingoism
that weaken U.N. missions.
The State Department and Pentagon
should also invest more resources into
regional dialogue groups and non-govern
mental organizations that aid refugees and
provide forums for interaction among dif
ferent ethnic groups. The Bosnians. Serbs,

Kosovar Albanians and Croats co-existed
peacefully during the Cold War. National
ism driven by hatred is not an innate char
acteristic of Southern Europeans.
In Kosovo we must continue strategic
NATO airstrikes, intensify nonmilitary
means of undermining Milosevic and plan
for the use of ground troops. We must also
make Russia a crucial player in our efforts
through diplomacy and recognition of its
ability to influence Serbian policy.
I may sound like an overly optimistic and
idealistic college student. 1 grew up during
the era of Perestroika and the Gulf War.
The fact remains, however, that a harsh dic
tator is bent on destroying the lives of hun
dreds of thousands of civilians and threatens
the stability of Europe. While it may seem
ages away. World War II happened only 50
years ago, and we should do all we can to
prevent the recurrence of pernicious ethnic
conflicts.
