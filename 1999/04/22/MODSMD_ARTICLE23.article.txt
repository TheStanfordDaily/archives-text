Women's Rugby:
For the second straight year.
Stanford is headed to the Final Four,
after beating Air Force. 15 -11. last
Sunday. The Cardinal won it all last
year, and if it's last few games are
any measure, it is ready to do it
again.

CLUB SPORTS
On Saturday, Stanford defeated
West Chester, 32-5, while Air Force
took Bowling Green, 34-10. Sun
day's game was as thrilling as they
come, with Stanford building a 10-0
lead early in the second half. How
ever, the next 35 minutes saw Stan
ford go scoreless, as Air Force
clawed back to take an 11-10 lead
with 3 minutes to play. Stanford
then marched down the field and
scored in the corner with no time re
maining.
Cycling:
In collegiate racing, the schools
host their own events, a burden that
is as mentally draining as it is a phys
ical hardship when the site is nearly
1(X) miles away from campus.
Last weekend Stanford hosted
three races, the John C. Schlesinger
Memorial Criterium, the Chris
Hooyman Memorial Road Race
and a Team Time Trial. Through all
the organizational nightmares Stan
ford broke away from the peleton
with first-, second-, and third-place
finishes.
Christine Thorburn, in her final
race for Stanford, won the women's
time trial event with help of team
mate and fellow med student Megan
Troxell. Their time of 18:01 crushed
the second place team, Cal Poly SLO
by more than a minute and a half.
The women's A criterium
marked Troxell's third straight victo

ry in the event. Teammate Cynthia
Fergusen finished fourth in her only
appearance in collegiate racing since
winning the NCCA road race and
overall championship last May.
On the road for the first time in
women's B were grad student
Anona Dutton, sophomore Ashley
Holt, and junior Zoe Bradbury. In
Saturday's criterium Dutton finished
fifth with Holt coming in right be
hind her. Dutton was edged out at
the line by Bradbury for third in the
road race after the two worked to
gether for the final 15 miles.
