### Jake Widens Contributing writer 
The top seven players on the No.
9 men's tennis team begin play
today in the Wth annual Pacific 10
Conference Championship tourna
ment.
The Cardinal's top four singles
players and top two doubles team
will be in the tournament's main
draw, while the No. 5 and No. 6 sin
gles players and No. 3 doubles team
will be in the Pac-10 Invitational
draw.

This weekend of tennis has tra
ditionally been a positive one for
the Cardinal as it gives eaeh player
a chanee to get some extra matches
in before NCAAs begin in mid-
May. The touraament is not a team
event, but it does have an effect on
each individual's ranking, thus af
fecting his chances of qualifying for
the individual draw of the NCAAs.
"It is always a fun weekend of
tennis and a good chance for some
of our guys to both improve their
play and prove that they belong in
the NCAA individuals," said Stan

ford head coach Dick Gould. "The
most important thing is that we stay
healthy, have some fun and try to
get better in some ways."

MEN'S TENNIS
■ Today-Sunday: No. 9 Stanford
(18-2 overall, 11-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) at the 99th annual Pac-10
Championships.

Senior leader Ryan Wolters has
been a finalist the last two years
and enters the tournament seeded
No. 3 in singles. Junior Geoff
Abrams also gained one of the al
phabetical seeds (given to the five
through eight seeds), and he and
sophomore Alex Kim are seeded
No. 3 in the doubles draw.
In the invitational side of the
tournament, sophomore Scotty
Scott is seeded No. 3, and he and
partner David Hauser (junior) are
seeded No. 4 in doubles. Both
draws consist of 32 singles players
and 16 doubles teams.
This weekend is perhaps most
important to Kim. He plays in the
No. 4 singles spot and thus, despite
his impressive record, will have a
difficult time gaining an at-large
bid to the NCAA individuals. An
individual tournament like this one
could be just what he needs to
prove he deserves a chance in the
NCAAs.
"It is obviously important for
me because playing at No. 4, you
don't get a lot of recognition, so a
few good wins could be huge for
me," Kim said. "I am not going to
put too much pressure on myself,
though, because all of us know the
team stuff is way more important."
This weekend could also prove
important for Wolters and fresh
man doubles partner K.J. Hippen
steel. The two were playing excel
lent doubles early in the season but
have lately struggled to find a con
sistent level of play. The team
should nonetheless get a bid for the
NCAA doubles tournament, but a
good performance would definitely
solidify their spot.
"It would he nice to go down
there and win the singles and play
