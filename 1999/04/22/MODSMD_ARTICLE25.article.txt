ranked Cardinal (23-2, 8-0) captured its 12th
consecutive Pac-1() team title last weekend
after upsetting fourth-ranked UCLA.
The Stanford women will have their hands
full in Ojai this weekend as they face top
ranked competitors from UCLA. California
and Arizona State.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Today-Sunday: No. 5 Stanford (23-2 overall,
8-0 Pacific 10 Conference) at the Pacific 10
Championships.
Second-ranked freshman Marissa Irvin and
fourth-ranked junior Teryn Ashley will com
pete for the Cardinal as the top two seeds in the
tournament. Freshmen Gabby Lastra and Lau
ren Kalvaria will also have spots in the draw,
but they will be unseeded.
All four women have a legitimate shot at the
individual title.
"I would assume that every one of our play
ers in this tournament expects to win it," said
assistant coach Lcle Forood. "It's an individual
event, so it's not about the team anymore. It's
about personal goals."
Ashley, Lastra and Kalvaria have all been in
peak form in recent weeks. Irvin, on the other
hand, has been struggling — at least by her
standards.
After posting an unrivaled 23-match win
ning streak earlier this season, Irvin has since
lost four of her last seven matches.
"Her concentration seems to have wavered
a bit," said head coach Frank Brennan. "But
anything less than winning it all is considered
poor by Marissa's standards. She definitely ex
pects to win the Pac-lOs."
On Tuesday, the Cardinal faced No. 21
Fresno State (18-6,5-3) and quickly found itself

in a very precarious position. Fresno State com
manded a surprising 4-2 lead after singles play,
one match away from sealing the victory.
Stanford, playing without starter Keiko
Tokuda, who is recovering from an illness, re
bounded to win all three doubles matches and
scraping by with a narrow 5-4 victory.
One of the day's most surprising losses was
suffered by Irvin, as she fell 1-6,6-1,6-4 to No.
13 Dora Djilianova.
Irvin won't be able to seek revenge against
Djilianova this weekend, but she will be com
peting against some of her other recent con
querors, including Cal's Amanda Augustus,
Arizona State's Allison Bradshaw, UCLA's
Annica Cooper and USC's Ditta Huber.
While Irvin boasts a winning record against
all of these opponents, they each have man
aged to snare a win over the talented freshman.
Ashley will also be looking to battle past
some of her collegiate rivals, especially
UCLA's Amanda Basica, who has won two re
cent matches between the two in three sets.
Coach Brennan is confident that his squad
will perform up to par in Ojai, but he is avoid
ing putting too much pressure on the young
women.
"Some people take this tournament real se
riously and others don't," he said. "I just want
the girls to go there and play their best tennis.
Doing well here can help you, but losing isn't
going to hurt you."
Kalvaria agreed.
"It's going to be a new experience for us
freshmen," she said. "I'd like to see a Stanford
semifinal, but personally, I just want to play my
best tennis."
The Pac-10 Invitationals will take place the
same weekend. Lower-ranked Stanford play
ers Jennifer Heiser, Sara Pestieau, Marisa
MacLennan and Julia Sherbakov will all look
to take the title.
"Heiser got to the finals last year," Forood
said. "She's going to expect to win it. She'll be
very confident."
