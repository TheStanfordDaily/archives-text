field team will split squads this week
end with some women going to the
California-Nevada Track and Field
Championships hosted by UC-San
Diego and others to the Drake Re

WOMEN'S TRACK
■ Saturday-Sunday: Women's track

lowa.
■ Saturday-Sunday: Women's track
at the California-Nevada Track and
Field Championships.
Coming off an exceptional week
end of competition in the sprints and
distance events — and for Tracye
Lawyer, the heptathlon — the Car
dinal will use this week's meets to
fine-tune many of its field event
competitors. Additionally, many of
the sprinters and distance runners
who ran last week will see action in
off-events, giving them a last chance
to be in a competitive situation be
fore the Big Meet versus California
May 1 at Stanford.
The California-Nevada meet is a
team-scored meet, but because of
the timing of the event, after Mt.
SAC and before the Big Meet, it
doesn't make sense for Cardinal to
bring a full squad.
"We've never been able to really
participate at our highest level sim
ply because its been that last week
end in April and we've always felt a
commitment when we have a na
tional [as opposed to a regionally
based team] team," said Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna. "It's im
portant for us to get out and go else
where. It's never been a team-fo
cused thing and it will continue to be
the same."
That's not to say those who go
will not compete to win against a

Both competitions start Saturday.
very competitive field including
UCLA, traditionally very strong in
the throwing events, and USC, a
sprinting powerhouse.
The entire throwing squad will
make the trip and aim for NCAA
qualifying marks. Last weekend the
women seemed to be stuck at a
plateau in their performances, yet it
is unlikely that the strong group of
Summer Pierson, Maureen Onyeag
bako, Maggie Isaac and Cassie Ro
muld will not have great marks in the
warm San Diego weather.
Also going to San Diego will be
sprinters Jayna Smith, Wilsa Charles
and Robyn Woolfolk, all coming off
great performances last weekend.
Smith, who set the school record in
the 400 meters last week at Pomona,
will likely move back down to the 2(H)
meters for work on her speed while
Charles and Robyn will compete in

their usual races — the 1(K) and 200
for Charles and the 100 hurdles for
Woolfolk.
Pole vaulter Melissa Feinstein
and long and triple jumper Tara Oet
tinger will also make the trip.
A very small squad will be making
the trip to the Drake Relays, one of
the biggest relay meets in the coun
try. Even though it falls on the same
weekend as the perhaps more presti
gious Penn Relays, the 90th Annual
Drake meet expects a sellout crowd
of 15,(XX) Saturday.
The Stanford group will consist of
Maurica Carlucci, Colleen Flaherty,
LaShawndra Pace and All-Americas
Sally Glynn, Julia Stamps and Mary
Cobb. The six athletes will make up
both the 3,200-meter relay and dis
tance medley relay. Among the com
petition will be the Oregon Ducks
who beat Stanford in the 3,200 relay
but fell to the Cardinal in the dis
tance medley at the Hayward Relays
two weeks ago. Other teams will be
Notre Dame and Arizona.
