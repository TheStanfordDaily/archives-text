In an interview at Tresidder Union l ues
day newly elected ASSIJ President Mike
Levin and Vice President John Mills out
lined their goals for the upcoming year. The
pair outlined specific projects for the up
coming year.
Levin and Mills aim to complete a new
bicycle recycling project before the end of
this spring. Graduating students will be en
couraged to donate their bikes to the ASSt I
at the end of spring quarter. Bikes will be
stored by the police department over the
summer, repaired and sold at bargain rates
to incoming students in the fan.
"We've already talked to the Stanford
Police Department, which is excited [about
the idea], and we've had a lot of e-mails and
offers from students who are ready to help."
Levin said. At the end of last year about 300
unwanted bikes were left tin campus and
confiscated by the police.
The team also aims to improve night
lighting on campus and will begin work on
the project this summer. It will designate
specific areas on campus as lighted corri
dors.
"We plan to draft a survey that senators
can pass on to their constituents in the fall,
asking students what areas on campus they
feel are too dark," Mills said.
