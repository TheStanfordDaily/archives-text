### Sarah Rapawy Staff writer 
In an interview at Tresidder Union l ues
day newly elected ASSIJ President Mike
Levin and Vice President John Mills out
lined their goals for the upcoming year. The
pair outlined specific projects for the up
coming year.
Levin and Mills aim to complete a new
bicycle recycling project before the end of
this spring. Graduating students will be en
couraged to donate their bikes to the ASSt I
at the end of spring quarter. Bikes will be
stored by the police department over the
summer, repaired and sold at bargain rates
to incoming students in the fan.
"We've already talked to the Stanford
Police Department, which is excited [about
the idea], and we've had a lot of e-mails and
offers from students who are ready to help."
Levin said. At the end of last year about 300
unwanted bikes were left tin campus and
confiscated by the police.
The team also aims to improve night
lighting on campus and will begin work on
the project this summer. It will designate
specific areas on campus as lighted corri
dors.
"We plan to draft a survey that senators
can pass on to their constituents in the fall,
asking students what areas on campus they
feel are too dark," Mills said.
Mills, a doctoral student in genetics, said
his own experience walking at night, as well

as a similar project at his undergraduate uni
versity. UC'-Davis, inspired him to begin
work on this idea.
Levin and Mills said they must also con
tinue to work on existing projects. This
week the Draw guide will be coming out on
the World Wide Web, offering hundreds of
students' opinions on each campus resi
dence.

last year's pilot issue, with pictures, more
student comments and information on a
wider range of residences.
I hey plan to continue work on the guide
next year. "We want to give an impression


ol what it's like to live in that resi
dence." Levin said.

l or graduate students, Mills
hopes that the Graduate Student
Council can launch projects tem
porarilv neglected as attention has
been centered on passing the new
amendment to split the ASSU Sen
ate into graduate and undergradu
ate houses.

Graduate concerns include
health insurance, housing and
stipends. Mills also wants to help
graduate students obtain their de
grees on schedule.
"1 hope to use my position as
vice president to facilitate these is
sues," he said.
For all projects, Levin and Mills
plan to emphasize student input,
"You've got to consult numerous
people before spending money,"
Levin said.
Current campus issues such as
tenure reform are something on
which Levin said the ASSU could
facilitate debate.
However, he emphasized that
the ASSU would not take sides on
the issue.
"I don't know if it's necessarily
something that the ASSU should

be taking a lead on," Levin said.
In terms of other campus con
cerns, Mills stated that he sees the
ASSU taking an "active role" in the
executive committee, although he
and Levin are currently "thinking
about structural things."
In addressing student space.
Levin said that he wants longer
hours for meeting space.
"Student space is the huge
issue," Levin said. Ideally, Levin
said that to create a student union
would require "[getting] out the
wrecking ball. I don't know if you
can ever turn the existing space into
a good student union."
However, Levin admits to the
unfeasibility of that idea, so he said
that he and Mills will focus on im
proving the current structure to
better suit student needs.
