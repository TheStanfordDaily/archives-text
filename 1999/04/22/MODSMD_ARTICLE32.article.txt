# Web reviewing on increase
## Journal editors consider Internet impact on publishing 
### Deborah Roth 
No more stuffing photocopies in manila envelopes?
No more waiting for "snail mail" to arrive? At Stanford,
as elsewhere, editors of academic journals still disagree
about just how much the Internet will change academic
publishing.
()niiÂ»e peer review is the new concept that allows the
editors m ..cademic journals to process submissions more
speedily. Stanford Electrical Engineering Prof. Giovan
ni de Micheli. editor of Transactions on Computer-
Aided I )esign ol Integrated ( ircuits and Systems, a jour
nal published by the Institute of Electrical and Electron
ic I ngineers. developed the software that enables online
peer review.
Authors from all over the world submit their essays on
the Weh. Then, reviewers are assigned to each essay.
I heir comments are also available online. The Internet
allows authors, reviewers and editors to engage in con
stant password-protected exchange.
I)e Micheli listed the advantages of the new technol
ogy. "It takes us now less than three months to edit the
journal."
Before the online peer review was adopted, the edit
ing could take up to one year. De Micheli also said, "the
(. valuations are much fairer, because there is more inter
action between the different parties."
"We are much better organized now [the new tech
nology! certainly increases the quality of the journal."
De Micheli predicted that in the coming year most
journals published by the lEEE will adopt the online
peer review.
Some o! De Micheli's colleagues at Stanford are not
.is (iptimistic about the new technology. Economics Prof.

Mordecai kur/ said, "I wouldn't adopt this technology."
Kur/ was not enthusiastic about the possible interac
tion between reviewers and authors.
He explained that he would prefer if the editors could see
the reviews before they are made available to the au
thors.
Nor did Kur/ think all that much time would be saved.
"The time of the actual reviewing is much more sub
stantial than the time of mailing ... and the time of re
viewing will remain the same."
Mechanical Engineering Prof. ( harles Steele pointed
out the technical barriers that might prevent online peer
reviewing from being adopted too quickly.
"We have submissions from all over the world
There are too many formats." Authors and reviewers
might not have the proper software to read a particular
page.
"Some people don't even have access to e-mail. I
don't know how they will be able to use the Internet."
Steele said.
liul other Stanford professors and editors have little
doubt that the Internet will conquer the realm of acade
mic editing.
" I he Web is the natural way of doing it." said Kincho
Law, professor of civil and environmental engineering.
Although Law suggested that there may be security
problems, he considered the online peer review the
""technology ol the future."
" There is no question that the new technology will
come into use," said I inguistics and English Prof. Eliza
beth Traugott.
"'(>ni readership [in linguistics] is small, so we proba
bly won't go as fast, but a great deal is done already elec
tronically ... we are halfwav there," Traugott said.
