## THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS Elevator Through Vague Premonition (Subpop) 
### 
levator Through has led an exis
tence straight out of a Monty
vry Python sketch. First the band was
known as Elevator To Hell, then Elevator
Through Hell and now simply Elevator
Through. It was originally formed as a side
project for Rick White, singer / guitarist for
the now-defunct Canadian group Eric's Trip.
Currently, this "side project" (composed of
White, his wife Tara and former Eric's Trip
drummer Mark Gaudet) is now Rick's main
project, as the trio has released no less than 10
EPs and LPs over the last five years.
The band specializes in 10-fi, slacker psy
chedelia — meaning lots of calm harmonies,
atmospheric background noises and navel gaz
ing. Consider the title track of the group's
newest disc, "Vague Premonition," on which
Rick sings "I see something in the
ceiling / Beneath the paint and plaster
peeling /1 see something more
revealing / Beneath the floor above my ceil
ing." Apparently, the Whites don't get out of
the house too much.
Despite all this soft-headedness, Elevator
Through at least sounds compelling. "The
Only See To Thought" is an efficient rocker
while "Comfortable, But Almost" and the first
half of "Cut Out The Wick" both recall
"American Beauty"-era Grateful Dead.
Moreover, the group can flash some credible
pop sensibilities. "The Maze," for example, is a
dreamy, sing-along ballad which draws in the
listener slowly, without force.
However, this lack of force reveals the
essential flaw behind "Vague Premonition."
The record exudes such a low-key attitude that
the band's lack of conviction leaves one won-

dering what's really behind all the
feedback and loopy lyrics. At one
point, Rick actually sings "I under
stand that you are different from
me." Although this type of bland
psychedelia may make a fine trip
for your pothead cousin from
Rainbow Valley, for the rest of the
world, Elevator Through is a trip
straight to boredom.
