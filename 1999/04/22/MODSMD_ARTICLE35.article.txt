# Future Pilot AKA

XT) you know that really random track on
some CDs? I'm not trying to be
€—S Seinfeld-esque, but do you know
what I'm talking about? Sometimes there's a
track, usually an instrumental, that just does
not really seem like it was meant to be there.
"5-4=Unity" on Pavement's "Crooked Rain
Crooked Rain" or "4th of July" on U2's "The
Unforgettable Fire" would be examples. I guess
you could call these tracks "accidents."
It's actually very cool that Future Pilot
AKA's debut album, "vs. A Galaxy of Sound," is
full of such random tracks. Future Pilot AKA is
just one guy (sort of like Nine Inch Nails just
being Trent Reznor): Sushil K. Dade of
Glasgow, who used to be in the Soup Dragons
and the Telstar Ponies. I was expecting conven
tional pop-rock, but wowee gee, this is really
loopy.
On this double album (a real 2x40
minute album, not one of those Wu-Tang or
Smashing Pumpkins 2x75 minute double-CD
catastrophes), Dade collaborates with several
other Scottish pop wizards, including the
Pastels and Corner
shop. The result is not
pop but atmospheric
little excursions. It's

tempting to put this
under the electronica
banner, but it's too
vague to be classified
| even as that. A lot of
the tracks sound like
they have a dub influ
l ence, but I wouldn't
jj call any of them
specifically dub.
1 suppose it should
be called "trance"
music, but it's not
really like the rave
genre of trance. These
tracks work like Brian

Eno's ideal of ambient: sonic wallpaper. The
only problem with such music is that it can be
boring, and "A Galaxy of Sound" can some
times lapse into noodl-ing. It probably would
work better as a finely honed single album.
There's an irritating robotic voice that intro
duces each track; I'd probably get rid of that.
The best tracks are the most incoherent:
the always dramatic Alan Vega of Suicide
("with The Revolutionary Corps of Teenage
Jesus," whatever) provides vocals on the gor
geous and frightening "Meditation Rat."
Cornershop's "Teri Mitti Bani" gets buried in a
stew of sitar, organ and echo, but it still works.
On the Pastels' "Hurricane Fighter Plane,"
nothing really is very clear except the repetitive
bass line, but you get lost in the track anyway.
Bill Wells provides the most pensive moments
with four tracks interspersed throughout the
set. Each of the four tracks has "Pink" in the
title and the same haunting and somewhat
familiar motif. It somehow makes sense that
such a random collection would have some
continuity.
