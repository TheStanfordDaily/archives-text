# Sam Prekop
## Self-Titled (Thrill Jockey) 
### 
Styles of music tend to flow in waves,
v and with the release of Sam Prekop's
self-titled album, the Thrill Jockey
label rides the most recent trend of sweet,
loungey, jazz-infused pop. This is Prekop's first
solo endeavor, and the opening chords of the
first track, "Showrooms," signal his connection
to his other band, indie-supergroup The Sea &
Cake.
Prekop, who is The Sea & Cake's prima
ry songwriter, reportedly recorded the solo

album during the band's downtime while band
mate John McEntire toured with his other pro
ject, Tortoise. The results are the same gorgeous
pop tunes of The Sea & Cake without the group's
recent electronic bent. The instruments on
Prekop's solo album — strings, guitars, cornet,
piano and organ — are all thankfully "real" and
played by accomplished colleagues Josh Abrams,
Chad Taylor (from The Chicago Underground
Duo), Archer Prewitt (also in The Sea & Cake and
the now-defunct Coctails). Jim O'Rourke and
special guest musicians Rob Mazurek (Isotope
217), violinist Julie Pomerleau, as well as
McEntire.
"Showrooms" is a beautiful pop track that
wonderfully characterizes the entire album. With
the catchiest of melodies, it's light and upbeat.
The sweet ethereal sound is picked up again in
"The Company." Part of the songs' charms lie in
the harmony between the music and Prekop's dis
tinctly affable voice — they complement each
other perfectly.
And while some of the tracks, like
"Practice Twice," do borrow the jazzier elements
of lounge music, the effect is never cheesy. The
album also features several instrumentals, with
sounds ranging from soft and lazy, in the appro
priately titled "A Cloud to the Back," to funk
inspired, in "Faces and People." There is a sim
plicity to Prekop's music, creating a sound that is
simultaneously sparse and incredibly full, best
heard in the repetition of a single melody in the
instrumental "Smaller Rivers."
All in all this is a gorgeous album. Fans of
The Sea & Cake will love it, as will supporters of
the Thrill Jockey / Drag City label scene and
those who like pop music in general. Sam
Prekop's new solo album joins catchy tunes with
sophistication in a totaJly original way. By com
bining guitars with cornets and strings with jazzy
drums, he creates a fresh, full sound without any
computers. That, at the very least, deserves some
respect.
