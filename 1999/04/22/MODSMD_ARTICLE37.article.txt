## Mogwai Come On Die Young (Matador) 
### 
/T\ —ith its "live hard, die
young" title, death's head
fJ cover and song titles like
"Punk Rock," you would expect the
new Mogwai album to be a heavy
metal / goth thrashfest. And you
would be right. Sort of.
"Come On Die Young" is like a heavy
metal album stripped of all its vocals and
slowed way, way, way down. You get the
same repetitious minor-key guitar riffs,
blasts of feedback and death metal atmos
phere, but it all goes by so slowly that you
can see each note separately as the guitar line
unfolds.
The effect is, well, mesmerizing, but
it's hard to say whether that's a good thing.
After listening to a song like "Year 2000 Non
compliant Cardia" you'll be entirely incapac
itated: staring at the wall, drooling slightly
and seriously considering that album title.
Then the next song hits — it's exactly the
same — and you sink even deeper into a
black funk.
There's nothing wrong with that.
After all, one person's "monotony" is anoth
er person's "atmosphere." The real problem
with Mogwai, however, is that despite all the
hype, the band isn't doing anything even
remotely innovative. Stephen Malkmus
recently proclaimed Mogwai "the best band
of the 21st century," which, if true, indicates
that the music of the next century will con
sist entirely of songs that sound like "Wish
You Were Here"-era Pink Floyd. Except for
some spacey fuzz and a few languorous sam
ples ("Helps Both Ways" is very effectively
juxtaposed with commentary from a foot
ball game), Mogwai is pure guitar, drums
and bass.
Once again, that's not to say that
"Come On Die Young" is bad. In fact, it's
often startlingly beautiful. The album's cen
terpieces "Ex-Cowboy" and "Cody" (the
only track with vocals) are particularly tran
scendent. It's just that you'd be hard pressed
to find anything on the album that you
haven't heard before.
But if you're not looking for innova
tion, "Come On Die Young" is a fine record.
It would be perfect as a background to one
of those long nights alone with a stiff drink
or as make-out music for your goth girl
friend or as a substitute for sleeping pills (or
a bottle of sleeping pills). Just be careful —
don't operate heavy machinery while under
the influence of Mogwai.
