# COVER STORY
## What a Payne! 
### 
Last weekend, Intermission caught
up with director Alexander Payne
a few days before he screened his
latest film, "Election," a satire on the high
school election process and its ramifica
tions in students' and teachers' lives.
Payne welcomed Intermission with open
arms and discussed everything from
"Election" and his Stanford years to
Westerns and the presence of Stanford in
Hollywood.
Intermission: The scene I thought was
the greatest in "Election" was the bed
room scene — the in flagrante delicto
scene, between [Matthew Broderick's
character] teacher Jim McAllister and
his wife...
Alexander Payne: And the other faces?
I: Yes. Was that part of the original
book, or did you guys plan it?
AP: Yes, we scripted it.
I: How did you decide to do that?
AP: I think we were trying to find a way
to communicate Jim McAllister. He
hates [Reese Witherspoon's character,
the overambitious student council can
didate] Tracy Flick, but one of the rea
sons he hates her is because he's sexually
attracted to her. In the book, [the teach
ers] look at and talk about female stu

dents a lot. But we weren't so crazy
about having a lot of that in the film. We
were looking for an economical way to
communicate a really dark and perverse
sexual attraction to Tracy. And it's a real
ly clear statement of his life that he pro
jects — that he's bored with his wife,
that the frustrations he's feeling are
aimed towards the best friend's wife and
really twistedly, perversely toward Tracy
Flick. And a hatred of his life at school is
transferred back onto perversely
destroying his own personal life — with
his wife, with having the affair with his
wife's best friend. It's almost too compli
cated for me to [explain]. It's just all
twisted.
I: But that's what's funny.
AP: Yeah, and it's funny, (smiles)
I: I read a pseudo-documentary style
into the film. Was that also the style of
the book?
AP: By documentary, you mean the nar
ration?
I: Yes, the narrative confession of the
characters.
AP: Yeah, that's the book. In the book
there are even more characters telling
you the story. We limited it to four.

I: What about the
book made you
decide "This is
what I want to
have be my next
project"?
AP: Tom Per
rotta's writing
has, at the same
time, a lot of
humor and a lot
of melancholy. It
appealed to me.
He writes with a
sense of nostalgia.
So that sucked me
into the book.
Then the fact that
the book presents
it from a com
pletely human
landscape with no
gimmicks other
than what's going
on in these peo
•le's lives right now.

And it's interesting too

that just dramatical
ly, both for a novel (
but particularly for !
a film, all of these

events revolve around a

central event. But not

an important
event. Nothing
could be more

banal or
uninteresting
as a high
school stu-

dent council
election. But
even some
thing like that

can be the agent for the unravelling of
people's lives.

Also, there's a moment in the book
where the principal has a problem with
his watchband. His watchband keeps
smelling. So he sniffs his watchband.
And I was having a stinky watchband
problem.
I: A stinky watchband day?
AP: No, like, a couple months, that I
would wash it and it wouldn't go away.
And I thought, wow ...
I: Parallels.
AP: Yeah.
I: What was it like working with
Paramount as opposed to working with
Miramax? Was there any difference?
AP: Yeah, each place has its own person
ality, and their hierarchies work differ
ently. But 1 think for me, both were sur
prisingly good studio experiences. You
hear a lot of nightmare stories about
studios imposing things and demanding
certain cuts and offering underheaded
notes, and 1 got none of that. Not that
people don't try to convince you and tell
you what to do — there's a lot of that,
almost too much — but nothing was
ever imposed in either case, and I'm
lucky.
I: You've now made "Citizen Ruth" and
"Election," both very purposefully satir
ical films. Do you plan on becoming
known as a director in this genre, or
would you like to try other things, and
if so, what?
AP: (Nodding) But not out of a desire to
