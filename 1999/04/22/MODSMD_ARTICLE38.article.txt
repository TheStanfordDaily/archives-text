# COVER STORY
## What a Payne! 
### 
Last weekend, Intermission caught
up with director Alexander Payne
a few days before he screened his
latest film, "Election," a satire on the high
school election process and its ramifica
tions in students' and teachers' lives.
Payne welcomed Intermission with open
arms and discussed everything from
"Election" and his Stanford years to
Westerns and the presence of Stanford in
Hollywood.
Intermission: The scene I thought was
the greatest in "Election" was the bed
room scene — the in flagrante delicto
scene, between [Matthew Broderick's
character] teacher Jim McAllister and
his wife...
Alexander Payne: And the other faces?
I: Yes. Was that part of the original
book, or did you guys plan it?
AP: Yes, we scripted it.
I: How did you decide to do that?
AP: I think we were trying to find a way
to communicate Jim McAllister. He
hates [Reese Witherspoon's character,
the overambitious student council can
didate] Tracy Flick, but one of the rea
sons he hates her is because he's sexually
attracted to her. In the book, [the teach
ers] look at and talk about female stu

dents a lot. But we weren't so crazy
about having a lot of that in the film. We
were looking for an economical way to
communicate a really dark and perverse
sexual attraction to Tracy. And it's a real
ly clear statement of his life that he pro
jects — that he's bored with his wife,
that the frustrations he's feeling are
aimed towards the best friend's wife and
really twistedly, perversely toward Tracy
Flick. And a hatred of his life at school is
transferred back onto perversely
destroying his own personal life — with
his wife, with having the affair with his
wife's best friend. It's almost too compli
cated for me to [explain]. It's just all
twisted.
I: But that's what's funny.
AP: Yeah, and it's funny, (smiles)
I: I read a pseudo-documentary style
into the film. Was that also the style of
the book?
AP: By documentary, you mean the nar
ration?
I: Yes, the narrative confession of the
characters.
AP: Yeah, that's the book. In the book
there are even more characters telling
you the story. We limited it to four.

I: What about the
book made you
decide "This is
what I want to
have be my next
project"?
AP: Tom Per
rotta's writing
has, at the same
time, a lot of
humor and a lot
of melancholy. It
appealed to me.
He writes with a
sense of nostalgia.
So that sucked me
into the book.
Then the fact that
the book presents
it from a com
pletely human
landscape with no
gimmicks other
than what's going
on in these peo
•le's lives right now.

And it's interesting too

that just dramatical
ly, both for a novel (
but particularly for !
a film, all of these

events revolve around a

central event. But not

an important
event. Nothing
could be more

banal or
uninteresting
as a high
school stu-

dent council
election. But
even some
thing like that

can be the agent for the unravelling of
people's lives.

Also, there's a moment in the book
where the principal has a problem with
his watchband. His watchband keeps
smelling. So he sniffs his watchband.
And I was having a stinky watchband
problem.
I: A stinky watchband day?
AP: No, like, a couple months, that I
would wash it and it wouldn't go away.
And I thought, wow ...
I: Parallels.
AP: Yeah.
I: What was it like working with
Paramount as opposed to working with
Miramax? Was there any difference?
AP: Yeah, each place has its own person
ality, and their hierarchies work differ
ently. But 1 think for me, both were sur
prisingly good studio experiences. You
hear a lot of nightmare stories about
studios imposing things and demanding
certain cuts and offering underheaded
notes, and 1 got none of that. Not that
people don't try to convince you and tell
you what to do — there's a lot of that,
almost too much — but nothing was
ever imposed in either case, and I'm
lucky.
I: You've now made "Citizen Ruth" and
"Election," both very purposefully satir
ical films. Do you plan on becoming
known as a director in this genre, or
would you like to try other things, and
if so, what?
AP: (Nodding) But not out of a desire to

Ruth'.
prove that I can do other things, because
I'm sure I'll be restless about what I want
to do and I'll fall on my instincts. I'm not
rational with respect to the films I want to
make. It comes from the material that I
come across at a certain time in my life,
and that's kind of unpredictable. The only
thing I know for certain is that at some
point in the next 10 years I want to start
making Westerns, because I love Westerns.
I: What's your favorite Western?
AP: It changes, but recently my favorite
Western has been"The Wild Bunch," just
because I've seen it projected twice in the
last year. It's a gigantic film in many ways.
It's done with a ferocity you just

don't see in films today. Plus, just
in terms of film craft, it's unbe
lieveable. You think, "Oh, no
one's been as good a film crafts
man as Martin Scorcese or
Steven Spielburg" — uh-uh.
Look at Peckinpah.
I: Would you enjoy working
with a bigger ensemble cast like
that?
AP: Yeah, bigger cast, bigger bud
get. Not because I long to have a
bigger budget, but you need that
for something like that. 1 actual
ly think films are too expensive,
and it's a huge problem with our
cinema right now. Studios wish
to dilute them so as to appeal to
a wider audience, and that's sad.
But yeah, once in a while, I'd like
to make a film that has a big
scope. I'm not attracted to
action, per say, but I love
Westerns and samurai films.

They're very similar. It'd be fun.
Action is really easy to shoot, dialog
is hard.
I: Before the cast was selected, did you
have any idea who you wanted for the dif
ferent roles?
AP: Not really, I definitely don't write with
actors in mind. Except maybe William
Holden. I always think about putting
William Holden in everything. I miss
William Holden!
When I met [Reese Witherspoon and
Matthew Broderick] I knew they were real
ly smart, funny people who would try as
hard as they could to inhabit those charac
ters.
I: There's been a lot of concern lately at
Stanford about the plight of film studies,
the lack of undergraduate filmmaking.
Just in the four years I've been there

there's been a lot of growth, in the number
of film classes offered...
AP: Film making or film studies?
I: Film studies. There's one undergraduate
filmmaking class at Stanford and it's a
pain to get into unless you're a communi
cation major. There's a lot of growth, a lot
of student interest, a lot of people doing
film studies.
I know you were a Spanish literature
and history double major. What film
related stuff did you do at Stanfordf
AP: I didn't take a single film class at
Stanford and I wasn't interested,
because I knew I'd do it in graduate

school. And Stanford's a place to get a very
good liberal arts education, which was
what I wanted to do. And consciously, too,
I knew that hist and lit were the best possi
ble preparation for a career in film. Also
journalism, my road not taken is becoming
a reporter.
But lit and hist are about what people
do, and film is about what people do. You
could also make an argument that as an
extension of literature, film is studying
artistically what people do. You can also
make the argument that since people are
going to see more films in their lives than
read novels, it's good to equip them with
critical skills and to have shown them the
great movies, and to help them understand
why they are great, so that they have some
point of reference and some standards of
quality.

I: Like "The Battleship Potemkin."
AP: That's kind of boring. I don't know
how well that holds up. It's good technical
ly. It was amazing for its time. It was an
early MTV. (laughing)
But I just felt I didn't need film because
I'd get it in graduate school. All the time I
was at Stanford, I knew I was going to
apply to film schools and the Columbia
Graduate School of Journalism and see
where I got in and go and make my deci
sion then. But I did watch a lot of films at
Stanford. This was the early '80s, before
VCRs. Cubberley, the Law School, the
Italian and French Departments all had
film series. The Varstiy Theater

was a revival house; the Stanford
Theater was still closed. I came
up to San Francisco to see films.
I remember seeing "The Seventh
Samurai" re-released at the
Castro in 1982. That helped me
decide I wanted to be a film
director.
I: A bunch of the other people
involved in the film are
Stanford grads.
AP: Producers David Gale (the
MTV guy), Ron Yerxa and Reese
Witherspoon.
I: How did you guys all end up
working together? Total fluke?
AP: Yep.
I: How do you feel about finally
getting to bring your movie to
Stanford?
AP: I'm really happy about that.
I had said, "We should show this
at Stanford and have a word of
mouth screening." I just think college

kids in general, and smart college kids like
the ones at Stanford, are the audience for
this film in a big way. I might be proven
wrong. I hope people show up for it.
I: I think they will. I've already gotten e
mail about it on three different lists.
There's a huge film society on campus
which is all over the place and does great
work.
AP: I support that, and I think that's great.
And your having said that makes me want
to go teach there. Do they show great
films?
I: Yep. I think it'll be a full house.
AP: 1600 people?
I: Sunday is movie day at Stanford.

VCRs. Cubberley, the Law School, the
Italian and French Departments all had
film series. The Varstiy Theater

was a revival house; the Stanford
Theater was still closed. I came
up to San Francisco to see films.
I remember seeing "The Seventh
Samurai" re-released at the
Castro in 1982. That helped me
decide I wanted to be a film
director.
I: A bunch of the other people
involved in the film are
Stanford grads.
AP: Producers David Gale (the
MTV guy), Ron Yerxa and Reese
Witherspoon.
I: How did you guys all end up
working together? Total fluke?
AP: Yep.
I: How do you feel about finally
getting to bring your movie to
Stanford?
AP: I'm really happy about that.
I had said, "We should show this
at Stanford and have a word of
mouth screening." I just think college

kids in general, and smart college kids like
the ones at Stanford, are the audience for
this film in a big way. I might be proven
wrong. I hope people show up for it.
I: I think they will. I've already gotten e
mail about it on three different lists.
There's a huge film society on campus
which is all over the place and does great
work.
AP: I support that, and I think that's great.
And your having said that makes me want
to go teach there. Do they show great
films?
I: Yep. I think it'll be a full house.
AP: 1600 people?
I: Sunday is movie day at Stanford.

Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Brodenck in Payne's "Election."
;ue
Last weekend, Intermission caught
up with director Alexander Payne
a few days before he screened his
latest film, "Election," a satire on the high
school election process and its ramifica
tions in students' and teachers' lives.
Payne welcomed Intermission with open
arms and discussed everything from
"Election" and his Stanford years to
Westerns and the presence of Stanford in
Hollywood.
Intermission: The scene I thought was
the greatest in "Election" was the bed
room scene — the in flagrante delicto
scene, between [Matthew Broderick's
character] teacher Jim McAllister and
his wife...
Alexander Payne: And the other faces?
I: Yes. Was that part of the original
book, or did you guys plan it?
AP: Yes, we scripted it.
I: How did you decide to do that?
AP: I think we were trying to find a way
to communicate Jim McAllister. He
hates [Reese Witherspoon's character,
the overambitious student council can
didate] Tracy Flick, but one of the rea
sons he hates her is because he's sexually
attracted to her. In the book, [the teach
ers] look at and talk about female stu

dents a lot. But we weren't so crazy
about having a lot of that in the film. We
were looking for an economical way to
communicate a really dark and perverse
sexual attraction to Tracy. And it's a real
ly clear statement of his life that he pro
jects — that he's bored with his wife,
that the frustrations he's feeling are
aimed towards the best friend's wife and
really twistedly, perversely toward Tracy
Flick. And a hatred of his life at school is
transferred back onto perversely
destroying his own personal life — with
his wife, with having the affair with his
wife's best friend. It's almost too compli
cated for me to [explain]. It's just all
twisted.
I: But that's what's funny.
AP: Yeah, and it's funny, (smiles)
I: I read a pseudo-documentary style
into the film. Was that also the style of
the book?
AP: By documentary, you mean the nar
ration?
I: Yes, the narrative confession of the
characters.
AP: Yeah, that's the book. In the book
there are even more characters telling
you the story. We limited it to four.

I: What about the
book made you
decide "This is
what I want to
have be my next
project"?
AP: Tom Per
rotta's writing
has, at the same
time, a lot of
humor and a lot
of melancholy. It
appealed to me.
He writes with a
sense of nostalgia.
So that sucked me
into the book.
Then the fact that
the book presents
it from a com
pletely human
landscape with no
gimmicks other
than what's going
on in these peo
•le's lives right now.

And it's interesting too

that just dramatical
ly, both for a novel (
but particularly for !
a film, all of these

events revolve around a

central event. But not

an important
event. Nothing
could be more

banal or
uninteresting
as a high
school stu-

dent council
election. But
even some
thing like that

can be the agent for the unravelling of
people's lives.

Also, there's a moment in the book
where the principal has a problem with
his watchband. His watchband keeps
smelling. So he sniffs his watchband.
And I was having a stinky watchband
problem.
I: A stinky watchband day?
AP: No, like, a couple months, that I
would wash it and it wouldn't go away.
And I thought, wow ...
I: Parallels.
AP: Yeah.
I: What was it like working with
Paramount as opposed to working with
Miramax? Was there any difference?
AP: Yeah, each place has its own person
ality, and their hierarchies work differ
ently. But 1 think for me, both were sur
prisingly good studio experiences. You
hear a lot of nightmare stories about
studios imposing things and demanding
certain cuts and offering underheaded
notes, and 1 got none of that. Not that
people don't try to convince you and tell
you what to do — there's a lot of that,
almost too much — but nothing was
ever imposed in either case, and I'm
lucky.
I: You've now made "Citizen Ruth" and
"Election," both very purposefully satir
ical films. Do you plan on becoming
known as a director in this genre, or
would you like to try other things, and
if so, what?
AP: (Nodding) But not out of a desire to

set of 'Citizen
Ruth'.
prove that I can do other things, because
I'm sure I'll be restless about what I want
to do and I'll fall on my instincts. I'm not
rational with respect to the films I want to
make. It comes from the material that I
come across at a certain time in my life,
and that's kind of unpredictable. The only
thing I know for certain is that at some
point in the next 10 years I want to start
making Westerns, because I love Westerns.
I: What's your favorite Western?
AP: It changes, but recently my favorite
Western has been"The Wild Bunch," just
because I've seen it projected twice in the
last year. It's a gigantic film in many ways.
It's done with a ferocity you just

don't see in films today. Plus, just
in terms of film craft, it's unbe
lieveable. You think, "Oh, no
one's been as good a film crafts
man as Martin Scorcese or
Steven Spielburg" — uh-uh.
Look at Peckinpah.
I: Would you enjoy working
with a bigger ensemble cast like
that?
AP: Yeah, bigger cast, bigger bud
get. Not because I long to have a
bigger budget, but you need that
for something like that. 1 actual
ly think films are too expensive,
and it's a huge problem with our
cinema right now. Studios wish
to dilute them so as to appeal to
a wider audience, and that's sad.
But yeah, once in a while, I'd like
to make a film that has a big
scope. I'm not attracted to
action, per say, but I love
Westerns and samurai films.

They're very similar. It'd be fun.
Action is really easy to shoot, dialog
is hard.
I: Before the cast was selected, did you
have any idea who you wanted for the dif
ferent roles?
AP: Not really, I definitely don't write with
actors in mind. Except maybe William
Holden. I always think about putting
William Holden in everything. I miss
William Holden!
When I met [Reese Witherspoon and
Matthew Broderick] I knew they were real
ly smart, funny people who would try as
hard as they could to inhabit those charac
ters.
I: There's been a lot of concern lately at
Stanford about the plight of film studies,
the lack of undergraduate filmmaking.
Just in the four years I've been there

there's been a lot of growth, in the number
of film classes offered...
AP: Film making or film studies?
I: Film studies. There's one undergraduate
filmmaking class at Stanford and it's a
pain to get into unless you're a communi
cation major. There's a lot of growth, a lot
of student interest, a lot of people doing
film studies.
I know you were a Spanish literature
and history double major. What film
related stuff did you do at Stanfordf
AP: I didn't take a single film class at
Stanford and I wasn't interested,
because I knew I'd do it in graduate

school. And Stanford's a place to get a very
good liberal arts education, which was
what I wanted to do. And consciously, too,
I knew that hist and lit were the best possi
ble preparation for a career in film. Also
journalism, my road not taken is becoming
a reporter.
But lit and hist are about what people
do, and film is about what people do. You
could also make an argument that as an
extension of literature, film is studying
artistically what people do. You can also
make the argument that since people are
going to see more films in their lives than
read novels, it's good to equip them with
critical skills and to have shown them the
great movies, and to help them understand
why they are great, so that they have some
point of reference and some standards of
quality.

I: Like "The Battleship Potemkin."
AP: That's kind of boring. I don't know
how well that holds up. It's good technical
ly. It was amazing for its time. It was an
early MTV. (laughing)
But I just felt I didn't need film because
I'd get it in graduate school. All the time I
was at Stanford, I knew I was going to
apply to film schools and the Columbia
Graduate School of Journalism and see
where I got in and go and make my deci
sion then. But I did watch a lot of films at
Stanford. This was the early '80s, before
VCRs. Cubberley, the Law School, the
Italian and French Departments all had
