Never Been Kissed
Drew Barrymore
★ ★ ★

(( v /ever Been Kissed" Is a drop of Drew Barrymore genius. Although the critics gen- I
/if erally panned this film, produced by Barrymore herself, and although we are all I
y probably a little sick of stereotypical depictions of high school by now, "Kissed"; I
manages to be both a sweet love story and an amusing portrayal of personal transformation, i I
At 25, Josie (Barrymore) goes undercover as a reporter for a Chicago newspaper alrkd ha* to;j
find out what the lives of teen-agers are really like. Though Barrymore tends to stick; to ditzy j
blond roles, she manages to pull off a brilliant "Josie! Grosie," the pathetic target of mean high 1 j
school jokes. This film is worth seeing just to see her snort / laugh v&ile dancing around in a
| metallic pink '80s style frou-frou dress, braces, zits and all.
■ Since her job is on the line, Josie has to undergo a major transformation in order to fit in to
I the cool crowd and get the real scoop. Her life in high school brings back terrible memories at
| first, but with a little help from hair bleach, make-up, new clothes and a cool older brother
! (who also poses as a high school student), Josie turns into a prom queen overnight She is
(enchanted with her new role as the"it" girl but soon finds that being hot is not so hot when
the most irresistible, babe-o-liciously underage guy in the school wants to jump her bones, and
all her new friends (the cool girls) are as shallow as Lake Lag during autumn quarter.
Josie reminds herself that she isn't really 17 and decides to opt for a tastier morsel: her
English teacher (who, as the 14-year-old girls sitting behind me crooned, is al "majjor hottie
babe"). The plot twists and turns when her boss Wants Josie to seduce and
expose her teacher as a statutory rapist. So will she get the guy and final-

a look, so go see it yourself!
