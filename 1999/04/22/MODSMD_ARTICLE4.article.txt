program coordinator in the Work-
Life Office, one of the groups re
sponsible for organizing the event.
This is the fourth year Stanford
has participated in the Take Our
Daughters to Work Day program,
sponsored nationwide by the New
York-based Ms. Foundation.
"It has grown tremendously,"
said Work Life's Carol Skladany,
who co-directed the event with
Rasco. " I he first year we had 50 kids
participate; now we have well over
3(H)."
One of the reasons for the pro
gram's increasing success, aside from
the diversity of the workshops avail
able, has been the thoughtfulness
put into each activity by Stanford
stall members. One workshop, "An
inside look at healthcare careers," al
lows participants to see firsthand

what goes into treating injuries at
C'owell Student Health Center.
"We take the girls through the
scenario of a bike injury treated at
C'owell," said Barbara Arnoldussen.
a nurse educator at Cowell. "We
bring up educational X-rays and
show exactly what's involved in car
ing for a patient. It'sa wonderful way
for children to learn what goes into
treating injuries."
In addition to faculty members.
Stanford students also have the op
portunity to get involved in the Lake
()ur Daughters to Work Day festivi
ties.
"Students, both undergraduate

and graduate, help out in a number
of ways," said Cathy Jensen, pro
gram administrator in the Feminist
Studies Department, which has been
a co-sponsor of the event for three
years. "They give tours of Stanford
dormitories to the participants and
volunteer in the various workshops.
Their help is important in a program
of this magnitude."
The planners of Stanford's lake
Our Daughter to Work Day hope
the event "will have been an inspira
tional day lor the students involved,"
Rasco said. But equally important,
according to Skladany, is that the
girls "just had fun."
