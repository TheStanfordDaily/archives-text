# THIS 'LIFE' AIN'T BEAUTIFUL
## Two women endure the worst of trials 
### 
from reviewing "School of Flesh" last week, I was amused to find
myself in a theater watching another French movie, "The Dreamlife of
tJjr Angels" ("La Vk riWe des anges"). Certainly the NC-17 rating intrigued
me. Also, "Dreamlife" split the best actress award at Cannes between its two stars and
garnered the best film prize in France. This all seemed to indicate that "Dreamlife"
might be spectacular. The content certainly doesn't justify the wrath of the Motion
Picture Association of America, the organization that assigns film ratings, but Erick
Zonca's directorial debut has some startlingly vibrant acting that fully merits the
awards bestowed upon the two women.
Isa (£lodie Bouchez) is a wanderer with no home. She comes to France to meet
her friend, but he has left for Belgium. Isa nearly dies before she miraculously lands
a job sewing garments and finds an apartment to share with Marie (Natacha
R£gnier). Marie happens to be house-sitting for a woman who fell into a coma fol
lowing a tragic accident The woman's daughter still lives — barely—but she, too, is
comatose.
Isa and Marie slowly develop a friendship of sorts, though not the kind of lesbian
love you might have been expecting. I guess that is part of the charm of the random
nature of foreign producers — they don't necessarily follow the formula established
by previous films.
The two ladies stumble through both their tedious jobs and screwed-up love lives.
Marie has a fling with Charlie (Patrick Mercado), the overweight bouncer who has a
sweet heart but lacks the right body. Isa tags along with Fredo (Jo Prestia), Charlie's

buddy, but she has no real emotional attachment to
him.
Actually, the only one Isa cares about — from
start to finish — is the little girl in the hospital. Isa
wonders how it is possible that Marie can com
pletely ignore the child's fragile status while house
sitting for the girl's family. It's just one example of
how opposite Marie and Isa are in reality, although
they initially get along quite well.

A wild card in Marie's life is Chris Colin, "Before the Rain"), a wealthy
young man who inherited his family's nightclub and hotel. Chris loves to court the
ladies, both rich and poor, and his disregard for women is about as extreme as
Charlie's undying devotion to Marie. But Marie doesn't sense that she is in for a sur
prise with Chris, and she chases after him as if there were no tomorrow.
The unsettling feeling we get from"The Dreamlife of Angels" derives from our
instinctual belief that things will turn out for the best in the long run. For some peo
ple, it is obviously not the case. Isa and Marie work hard, but it's the kind of blue-col
lar labor that doesn't earn them the quality of life they deserve. It is a sad story to see
two women struggle through life without much hope or aspiration, but it is one that
needs to be told.
