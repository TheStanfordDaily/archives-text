# THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT FOR YOUR HUSBAND
## A 						glorious (re)turn for uncut 'Brazil' 
### 
ry o ake the terrifying vision of
CXf George Orwell, mix in the
5— * humor of Monty Python and
you'll have the sci-fi fantasy "Brazil." Terry
Gilliam's 1985 film is sometimes hilarious,
sometimes depressing but always intensely
imaginative.
The plot begins with a typographical
error — literally, a bug — that leads to the
arrest and torture of an innocent man. Sam
Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), a petty bureaucrat
in the vast Ministry of Information, sets off
to correct it. But all Sam really wants is a
girl (Kim Greist) who appears in his fantas
tic, surreal dreams. Sam's real-life problems
include his sniveling boss (lan Holm), his
socialite mother (Katherine Helmond) and
two mechanics who seize his apartment for
"unnecessary repairs" (Bob Hoskins and
Derrick O'Connor). When his dream girl
turns out to be real, Sam risks his career
and sanity to chase her.
Sounds complicated? "Brazil" is a chal
lenging film, and you're unlikely to grasp
the plot until you've seen it twice. But the
star of "Brazil" is Terry Gilliam's surreal
world of government run amok. The cam
era takes you through ministries that make
the Stanford Post Office look friendly and
effective. The stunning sets were nominat
ed for an Oscar, as was the screenplay, co
written by Tom Stoppard.
The performances are memorable, espe
cially Robert De Niro as a renegade repair
man. Michael Palin, from the Monty
Python crew, takes a chilling turn as a Josef
Mengele-style interrogator.
Ironically, Sam Lowry's fight against the
Ministry of Information reflects Terry
Gilliam's battle with Universal Studios over
"Brazil's" release. When Gilliam finished
his cut of the film, his Hollywood bosses

thought it was too long, too
dark and too complex to be
commercially successful.
Universal prepared a version
with an upbeat ending and
fewer scenes of brutality.
Gilliam was outraged and

campaigned for the release of
his version. Instead of going to the lawyers,
he went to the press — taking out full-page
ads in Variety magazine and secretly
screening "Brazil" for American critics. The
critics loved it, and eventually Universal
released "Brazil" with Gilliam's original
ending.

Gilliam's full version of "Brazil," howev
er, is rarely seen on American shores. The
European version is the only complete
expression of Gilliam's intentions. It con
tains several scenes that reveal what's really
going on. Like most directors' cuts, it is
longer, but the extra 10 minutes really

explain the plot and
bring home the /

movie's message.
