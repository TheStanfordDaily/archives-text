# ALWAYS FORTUNATE FOR ALTMAN
## Legendary director returns with modest 'Fortune' 
### 
obert Altman has proved himself so capable of making great films
Csrf ( w M*A*S*H,""The Player," "Short Cuts") that one cannot help but
tS tv bring expectations to a new work. "Cookie's Fortune" is all the
more remarkable, then, for being a good and satisfying, though not great,
film.

"Cookie's Fortune" is a quiet, subtle Southern comedy about
families and secrets. The title is a fun trip-up, because it states so
bluntly what the film is really about: the death of an old widow
named Cookie and her fortune. Before she kills herself, it is estab
lished that she is very close to Willis (Charles Dutton), who helps
Cookie take care of her large house. Cookie's family seems to have
generally stopped paying attention to her, in expectation of their

inheritance. She remains haunted by her husband's memory to a
painful degree.
Things get quite complicated when Cookie's nieces (Glenn Close and
Julianne Moore) show up to borrow a bowl and find that Cookie has shot
herself. Such things do not occur in Close's family, at least according to her.

film or audience ever really fears that he will be convicted. The bulk of the

Close and Moore seem like hysterical caricatures from"The

film. And some of the characters can be summed up in a few
words, like Chris O'Donnell, who plays a young and horny cop.

realize that it's merely a very good film. Up to this point, I haven't

Like "Cookie's Fortune" itself, she is adorably sweet and human, though
imperfect.
