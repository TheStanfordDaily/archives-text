# BALLET THEATER
## NO SLEEP 'TIL HADES 'Giselle' at the SF Ballet 
### 
San Francisco Ballet presented
(a sumptuous production of the
repertory classic "Giselle" at the
War Memorial Opera House that closed last
Sunday.
The ballet tells the tale of the German
peasant Giselle (Tina

Leßlar.c), whose passion
for dance is checked only
by her frail health. She is
courted by Loys (Roman
Rykine), a nobleman dis
guised as a commoner,
who wins her heart in an
impassioned pas de deux.
Trouble arises when Loys'
fiance Bathilde arrives.
When Loys' true identity
is revealed, Giselle
descends into madness,
stabs herself with Loys'
sword and dies.
The second half of the
Killnt finrlc in t

ballet rinds uiseue in tne
dream-like world of the Wilis, where young
women who died before their wedding days
spend eternity dancing, Loys comes to this
world to seek forgiveness for his deception
and is commanded by the Queen of the
Wilis (Julia Adam) to dance himself to
death. After a series of virtuosic solos, Loys

collapses from exhaustion; he is saved by the
sunrise, which banishes the Wilis. The story
ends with Loys weeping at Giselle's grave.
From the Rhineland village to the forest
of the Wilis, the sets were remarkable in
their scale and intricacy.
At first, the dancing itself

gave the impression of a
set piece: All parts were
executed with great com
petence and few surpris
es. But the mad scene
loosened things up, ban
ishing saccharine sweet
ness to the wings and
allowing Leßlanc to dis
play a fuller assortment
of movements and
expressions.
The underworld scene
was similarly liberating,
giving rise to a ghostly
and enchanted series of
nrpn hv thp Wilis women

aances oy me wins wuinen.
During these unrestrained moments,
"Giselle" rose above mere technical execu
tion, but such moments were few and far
between.
