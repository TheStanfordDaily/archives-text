"Princess Ida" Friday and
Saturday and April 30 to May 2 in

directed by Terry Williamson and featuring a

order to found a university

for women. The action

centers on the increas
ingly drastic tactics

of Hilarion and his

friends to win

Ihe Savoyards, 1
founded at Stanford in

1973 to showcase the

works of Gilbert and
Sullivan, are a unique compo-

nent of the Stanford theater
community, employing the tal-

ents of Stanford students and
staff as well as members of the surrounding
community. This spring's presentation of
"Princess Ida" will exhibit the musical tal
ents of both stage veterans and first-time
performers, ranging from freshmen to local
senior citizens.

"Princess Ida" is one of Gilbert and
Sullivan's lesser known works, a piece that
junior lason Kngleman, who plays Prince
Hilarion, described as a "hidden jewel."
"The Savoyards provide a great opportu
nity for the Stanford community," Engleman
said. The music of "Princess Ida" is "excel
lent, absolutely beautiful," while the

Savoyards' unique approach to

casting draws upon a broader
v range of talent to create a

"very fun and beautiful
production."

"It's very impor
tant that Stanford
students make an
effort to come

| out and see
'Princess Ida,'"
Engleman said.
"Our generation is

* used to shows like
'Jesus Christ

Superstar.' A lot of peo-

ple miss out on the roots of

that [music]."
