# THE 						JEWEL IS IN THE LOUDNESS
## Stanford Taiko Spring Concert 
### 
[ s —tanford Taiko is gearing up for its spring concert,
V which will include the premiere of a piece writ
ten for drums and the marimba, as well as a
dumbshow based on a traditional foik tale.
While the taiko drum itself has a long history within
Japanese arts, kumidaiko —or the practice of bringing
together many drums in an ensemble — is a recent inno
vation. Kumidaiko began in Japan in the late '50s and was
brought to the United States in the '60s, when Seiichi
Tanaka founded the San Francisco Taiko Dojo. Similar
groups were established in San Jose and Los Angeles as the
popularity of the new art form spread.
Stanford Taiko was founded in 1992 by Ann Ihsimaru
and Valerie Mih, who received funding from
Undergraduate Research Opportunities to build their first
drum. Stanford Taiko is unusual in that it is entirely stu
dent-run and has no sensei or conductor. While the mem
bers occasionally participate in outside workshops, the
group most often engages in a process of collaborative
instruction, with each member learning from his or her
peers.
The group's independence is reflected in its activities:
the members make their own drums, sew their costumes,
write the songs they play and even hand-print the posters
advertising their concerts.
The spring concert marks the end of what has proven to
be a year of transition for the group. Of the 16 members of
Stanford Taiko, eight are new this year and six are graduat
ing.
Senior Paul Bodnar, one of the new members, said that
performing with the group "has been the most wonderful
part of this year at Stanford." He praised the experience of
taiko, describing it as a satisfying union of music, exercise,
creation and dance.
Four songs by current members will be premiered at the
concert, including Kris Bergstrom's "Kata." The piece pairs
three drummers with a computer programmed to "play"
through speakers, making use of the computer's ability to
utilize several sound sources.
Bergstrom said he did not attempt to naturalize the
electronic sound of the computer to mimic that of the
human drummers. "I think that in a real collaboration,
each performer maintains a distinct identity," he explained.
Bergstrom is one of the group's graduating seniors. He
First heard taiko performed at the "Faces of the
Community" event during his freshman year and was
impressed by the range of expression it offered. "I've fallen
more and more in love with it over the past four years," he
said. After graduation, he plans to move to Japan with fel
low Stanford Taiko member Shoji Kameda and audition
for taiko groups.
Another composition that will be featured in the show
is Kameda's "Little Wave," which Bergstrom described as
"an exercise in subtlety." The piece works with the Noh the
ater concept of "ma," which gives the space between notes
an importance equal to the notes themselves.
Though Stanford Taiko's members may be coming and
going, the music itself forms a continuum between the
years. All of the works performed by Stanford Taiko have
been composed by current or former members.
The concert is at Dinkelspiel at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday and
at 8 p.m. on Monday. Tickets are $5 students, $10 general;
call 725-2787.
