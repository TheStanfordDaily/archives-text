you've evcf goue lo Power
/ C/j Exchange, vou can stop reading
now. One trip there leaves enough
mental images to last a person a lifetime. If,
however, you have never had the pleasure of
going to this, or any other, San Francisco sex
club, Miss Sass has quite a story for you. She, *
along with three adventurous friends, recently
ventured into this part of the Cit/s dnrk side,
and it proved quite a memorable evening.
To prepare for the trip, our party first had to
secure the appropriate attire. Miss Sass, ever
modest, chose a simple pair of vinyl pants and
a spandex, leopard-print top. Her compatri
ots, however, were more bold — a rubber
bustier with a G-string back and knee-high
boots for Emily; a vinyl dress that laced up like H
a roller-skate for Heather. Heather's boyfriend,
Peter, wore black on black. Once dressed, we
set off for our destination, 4
Power Exchange lies in a part of the cityJjjsl
that makes a person want friends
thOfn,specialty late at night. Miss Sass
gests taking tWo or three, including at least one
large boy. She is all for women's lib, but
it comes down to it, nothing spells safety like
muscles and testosterone. She would also sug- jP
gest that if you decide to wear anything that
doesn't fully cover you, put a long coat over it.
Unless you plan on making some money on
your walk from the parking lot, it will come in
very handy.
When we came to the door (appropriately
dark and seedy-looking), we encountered two
things: a poster of the club's rules and a
cashier. The first listed what our common
sense would have told us, like not to be pushy
and not to do drugs inside. Once we had read
it, the cashier had us sign a statement saying
that we didn't have any STDs and that we'd try
our hardest not to get any. Then Peter paid a
$7 entrance fee, while the girls went right in.
(There is always a shortage of women at these
places.)
Once inside, a flight of stairs led us up to
the sex club itself. We checked our coats in. a
room to the right, where porn movies played
on two wall-mounted televisions, and then
confronted the club, if Miss Sass remembers
correctly, Power Exchange has about 15
rooms—two large rooms upstairs and 13
smaller ones both upstairs and downstairs.
Tlv larger ones are mainly open and contain
items like a velvet bed and a medieval rack
*meant fox* public displays. But it is in the
iiuilQlltr Oftes that most of the action is concen
f| t rated, ar*<4 that was where we headed.
I A dark hallway took us to a dark staircase,
winch dropped us into the dark basement
police the interior design of Power Exchange
relies heavily on black paint and black lights,
one dimly lit area lends to another without
much difference. Miss Sass would venture that
this ambiance is meant to flatter the make-up
of the rather hard-looking transveatites ami
drtig queens who compose about half of the
dub's patrons. Think Ronald McDonald

The basement hali was crowded with yaen
ami men dressed like women, and making our
way through was not easy. What is more, as the
only three women there, we got a lot of atten
tion from the men and a lot of dirty looks
from the drag queens. The men there are
nothing if not aggressive and will openly stare
at you, or worse. One large, bearded man in a
black trench coat took a particular interest in
Emily's assless attire Ind repeatedly clicked his
steel-tipped fingers at her. To be sure, nothing
keeps a girl mp\ lg like a horny ZZ-Top
lookalike.
£ach roomi that we passed had a different
to doctor's office to Gothic
was filled with Tonka trucks
and stuffed animal> to look like a nursery. In
112 it, a large, pasty man wearing only a diaper and
a grin stood next to a chalkboard where
*$f»nk me daddy, I've been a bad, bad boy"
VVas scrawled. No One seemed to be taking him
%- v up on the offer.
Heather finally detected a room at the end
of the hallway* It had no specific theme but did
have mirrors covering one wall and a swing
hanging from tsie middle of the ceiling.

es it's|| nice sentiment.
When anyone goes into one of the rooms, a
crowd instantly forms outside it. Some rooms
have velvet ropes across the doorway, while
others have doors with large windows, as ours
did. It is understood that anything in the club
is up for public viewing and having women in
our group caused a lot of noses to be pressed
up against the door glass.
About what went on next, Miss Sass will say
but few words. However, she will comment
that the name Power Exchange fits the place
well Doing anything even remotely titillating
makes a person feel like a gorgeous piece of
rotten meat You are at once m control of the
attention of so many onlookers while
unavoidably subjected to their gazes. It isn't an
experience that Miss Sass will soon forget or
repeat, but it definitely gave her something to
write home about.
