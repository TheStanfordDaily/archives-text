# Faculty salaries up by 5.7%
## Stanford exceeds national average 
### Nadira Hira 
Stanford professors received an average pay
increase of 5.7 percent this year, going from an
average salary of $82,133 last year to $86,800 this
year, and topping the national average of 4.2 per
cent for doctoral institutions.
T he average increase for all institutions
two-year liberal arts, comprehensive and doctor
al â€” was 3.8 percent, almost double the 1998 in
flation rate of 1.6 percent and more than two per
centage points less than Stanford's gain, all ac
cording to a survey of more than 1,500 schools by
the American Association of University Profes
sors. reported in the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion.
lull Stanford professors had the third-highest
average salary in the country, at $117,000, be

hind Rockefeller and Harvard universities. Only
19 schools in the country had averages higher
than $ 1 (M).()(K). Stanford assistant professors, at
$63,600, had the eighth-highest average.
Associate professors, with a $79,800 average,
do not figure so highly on such lists. According to
Robert Weisberg. vice provost for faculty rela
tions, this is because Stanford professors do not
stay at that rank for very long before becoming
full professors.
Though the overall rate of increase at Stan
ford over the past two years has been relatively
consistent, a look at the figures for the 1996-97
school year shows a surprisingly low 2.7 percent
increase from the previous year.
"The explanation lor the jump in salary in
crease might be that it was a bit of a catch-up.
Around the time of the indirect-cost matter in
early '90s. Stanford found itself facing a serious
deficit, some due to cutbacks in the indirect-cost
rate and some due to the general softening of
government support." Weisberg explained.
The indirect-cost controversy was a dispute

between Stanford and the federal government
over billing practices, which led to the Universi
ty's paying a large cash settlement.
"The University retrenched a fair amount in
the '90s. The trustees were very careful to re
strain the payout rate because they were worried
about budget deficits and wanted to be careful
not to endanger endowment. The retrenchment
succeeded very well. It attacked the deficit for
three years and did well, so what you see in terms
of pay increase is a result of this."
This also serves to explain UC-Berkeley's
11.1 percent increase this year from an alarming
ly low 1.1 percent increase in the 1996-97 figures.
"There were years in the early '90s when
some UC departments got very low increases
and fell behind because of decisions made at the
state level, so over the past few years they've had
more catch-up to do," Weisberg said.
Nationally, the difference between the pay of
Stanford's lull professors and those of other
