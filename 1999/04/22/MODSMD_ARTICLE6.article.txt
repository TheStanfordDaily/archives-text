# Faculty salaries up by 5.7%
## Stanford exceeds national average 
### Nadira Hira 
Stanford professors received an average pay
increase of 5.7 percent this year, going from an
average salary of $82,133 last year to $86,800 this
year, and topping the national average of 4.2 per
cent for doctoral institutions.
T he average increase for all institutions
two-year liberal arts, comprehensive and doctor
al â€” was 3.8 percent, almost double the 1998 in
flation rate of 1.6 percent and more than two per
centage points less than Stanford's gain, all ac
cording to a survey of more than 1,500 schools by
the American Association of University Profes
sors. reported in the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion.
lull Stanford professors had the third-highest
average salary in the country, at $117,000, be

hind Rockefeller and Harvard universities. Only
19 schools in the country had averages higher
than $ 1 (M).()(K). Stanford assistant professors, at
$63,600, had the eighth-highest average.
Associate professors, with a $79,800 average,
do not figure so highly on such lists. According to
Robert Weisberg. vice provost for faculty rela
tions, this is because Stanford professors do not
stay at that rank for very long before becoming
full professors.
Though the overall rate of increase at Stan
ford over the past two years has been relatively
consistent, a look at the figures for the 1996-97
school year shows a surprisingly low 2.7 percent
increase from the previous year.
"The explanation lor the jump in salary in
crease might be that it was a bit of a catch-up.
Around the time of the indirect-cost matter in
early '90s. Stanford found itself facing a serious
deficit, some due to cutbacks in the indirect-cost
rate and some due to the general softening of
government support." Weisberg explained.
The indirect-cost controversy was a dispute

between Stanford and the federal government
over billing practices, which led to the Universi
ty's paying a large cash settlement.
"The University retrenched a fair amount in
the '90s. The trustees were very careful to re
strain the payout rate because they were worried
about budget deficits and wanted to be careful
not to endanger endowment. The retrenchment
succeeded very well. It attacked the deficit for
three years and did well, so what you see in terms
of pay increase is a result of this."
This also serves to explain UC-Berkeley's
11.1 percent increase this year from an alarming
ly low 1.1 percent increase in the 1996-97 figures.
"There were years in the early '90s when
some UC departments got very low increases
and fell behind because of decisions made at the
state level, so over the past few years they've had
more catch-up to do," Weisberg said.
Nationally, the difference between the pay of
Stanford's lull professors and those of other
elite schools is negligible. The to
tals for Harvard, Princeton, and
Yale are $ 122.KM), $114,900, and
$113,100 respectively, which are
comparable to Stanford's figure of
$117,000.
"What we do have to do. and not
very systematically sometimes, is
just make sure that we're compet
ing vcry'well. If you look at salaries
for the faculty of elite institutions,
they're all the same. The differ
ences are trivial. It's the rough com
petition we're concerned with,"
Weisberg said.
Within the scope of that compe
tition. Stanford faces the unique
problem of competing in a pool of
schools that is generally concentrat
ed in another part of the country,
the Northeast. This creates a certain
level of inequity, completely unre

lated to salary compensation, when
attempting to compare these
schools to Stanford.
"The difference is in base salary
at similar institutions. If we pay the
same base salary as do our compet
ing institutions, that by itself would
put us in a bad competitive situation
because the cost of living here is so
much higher than other places. We
somewhat mitigate that competi
tive disadvantage by offering bet
ter-than-average housing subsidies,
but the [AAUP survey] figure only
concerns base salaries. On the other
hand, though there is this mitiga
tion. we can't completely eliminate
the disadvantage because the dif
ference between housing costs here
and housing costs in the locations of
our peer schools remains high and
may be getting higher." Weisberg
said.
Not remarkably, professors at
other types of institutions do not
fare as well with pay or pay increase

as those at doctoral institutions such
as Stanford. Professors at liberal
arts colleges received an average
raise of 3.2 percent, while profes
sors at two-year colleges saw a 2.7
percent increase and those at com
prehensive colleges emerged the
worst, with only a 2.6 percent in
crease.
Still, the overall average increase
is still the highest since 1990-91, in
dicating that schools across the
board are now remedying the pay
situation inflicted by the financial
problems of the early '90s.
The study, based on a survey of
1,017 public, 401 private and 443
church-related schools for a total of
1.561 institutions, does not include
medical professors, whose salaries
are characteristically much higher
than those of most other faculty. It
comes from the American Associa
tion of University Professors re
cently released annual report on the
state of the profession.
