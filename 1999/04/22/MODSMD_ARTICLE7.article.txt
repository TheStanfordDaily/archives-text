# Where service started
## Book traces history of service-learning 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
While many Stanford students
are involved in service-learning,
few know where the origins of the
alternative teaching method's
movement lie and who its pio
neers are.
A new book by Haas Center
Director Timothy Stanton and
Assoc. Director Nadinne Cruz,
along with Dwight E. Giles Jr., a
professor at Vanderbilt Universi
ty. chronicles the beginning of the
service-learning movement.
Stanton said that "Service-
Learning: A Movement's Pio
neers Reflect on Its Origins, Prac
tice and Future" was inspired
when "we began to wonder —
people were talking about the
field as if it lias no history.... So
we decided to take the task upon
ourselves."
Stanton defined service-learn
ing as "combining social action in
community with academic learn
ing."
In service-learning courses,
"service is a material just like a
textbook, except it's action and
experience rather than reading an
article." Cruz added.
Stanford offers approximately
30 service-learning classes, includ
ing Poverty and Homelessness in
America. "11 there are obstacles, it
isn't because the administration is
against [service-learning]," Cruz
said. "They're busy people, and it
takes time to connect the classic

classroom and the community."
Stanton, Cruz and Giles went
through a "semi-scientific process
of choosing the pioneers" of ser
vice-learning, narrowing 150
names down to 33 people. Stanton
said the "terribly and wonderfully
impressive" pioneers, who were in
volved in service-learning before
1985, met at a three-day confer
ence in Wisconsin where they dis
cussed their stories.
The book focuses on the stories
of the pioneers.
Stanton said the authors tried to
keep their own opinions to a mini
mum.
Then, Stanton. Cruz and Giles

took the material and began to
"turn it into something people
would care to read," Stanton said.
After three years, they finished the
book.
Cruz said she considers the
book a way of "giving a gilt back to
a growing and emerging field,"
which is "a pedagogy in the process
of defining itself."
She said their research found
that many pioneers "were uncom
fortable that they were becoming
part of the mainstream, hoping to
stay on the margins."
She attributed this tension to re
cent efforts to institutionalize ser
vice-learning.
Cruz said the book's purpose
was to "collect and document the
history of the field for the field"
and It) show people who are cur

rently involved in service-learning
that their problems are not new.
"Otherwise, each experience
stands bv itself, and there's no
learning over time," she added.
According to Cruz, there are
"many individuals scattered across
the country, practicing some form
of service-learning and what they
didn't have was a network to con
nect the individuals."
Stanton said the book will bene
fit two groups: the younger people
entering the field who need to
know where it came from and ulti
mately society, "because those of
us involved in this work try to give
benefits to society."
"Service-Learning," published
by Jossey-Bass Publishers, can be
purchased for $28.95 at bookstores
nationwide.
