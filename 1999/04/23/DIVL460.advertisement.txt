WE'LL ERASE YOUR
COLLEGE LOAN*
If you're stuck with a student loan that's not
in default, the Army might pay it off.
If you qualify, we'll reduce your debt—up
to $65,000. Payment is either of the
debt or $1,500 for each year of service,
whichever is greater.
You'll also have training in a choice
of skills and enough self-assurance
to last you the rest of your life. j
