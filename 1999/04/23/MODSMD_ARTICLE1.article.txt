# Cost scandal dies quietly
## Whistle-blower's appeal denied by Supreme Court 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
After eight years of lawsuits, the resignation of a pres
ident and a $1.2 million settlement, Stanford's indirect
cost scandal finally drew to a close this week when the

U.S. Supreme Court let stand a deci
sion dismissing Paul Biddle's lawsuit
against the University.
Biddle filed a lawsuit against
Stanford in 1991, in which he ac
cused the University of over-billing
the Office of Naval Research by
nearly $200 million. Biddle claimed
that Stanford was able to overcharge

by billing the Navy for "indirect costs." Indirect costs in
clude overhead costs that are not directly related to re
search, such as building maintenance.
An ensuing investigation revealed that, among other
items, Stanford billed the Navy for depreciation on a
yacht and the administrative costs of the Stanford Shop
ping Center.
The scandal associated with the allegations of over
billing led to the resignation of then-University President
Donald Kennedy in 1992. The scandal also led to con
gressional debate over what research costs could be
billed to taxpayers.
Three years after the initial filing of the lawsuit, the
Office of Naval Research settled with Stanford Univer-


Biddle
sity for $1.2 million and the stipula
tion that Stanford had committed no
wrongdoing.
However, Biddle's lawsuit against
Stanford continued.
Biddle's suit against Stanford fell
under the federal whistle-blowing
laws, which allow private citizens to
initiate lawsuits on behalf of the gov
ernment. The citizen is then entitled
to a percentage of any money recov
ered by the government.
The decision of the Supreme
Court not to hear Biddle's case up
held a decision of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which found that

Biddle could not sue under whistle
blowing laws because he was a feder
al employee at the time he brought
the suit and because he involuntarily
provided information to the govern
ment during the course of the investi
gation.
Through a spokesman. President
Gerhard Casper said that he wel
comed the end of the scandal. "Every
responsible authority — from the
federal government's acknowledg
ment that it had no claim against
Stanford for any wrongdoing,
through every level of the courts' de
cisions against this lawsuit — has re
jected the attempt to pursue these ir
responsible accusations. We trust
that this truly puts an end to this mat
ter."
