## Alleged killers intended to blow up entire school 
### 
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) â€”The two gunmen in
the Columbine High massacre were planning to blow
up their school and probably had help from others,
investigators said yesterday after discovering two pow
erful bombs in the school kitchen that had been built
from propane tanks.
"These subjects were not only on a killing rampage,
but they were going to destroy the school," Sheriff John
Stone said. "They were going to burn the school up."
The discovery of the two 20-pound propane tanks
heightened suspicions that the two killers had help from
other people, either with building the 32 bombs discov
ered so far or getting.them into the high school.
"It's a feeling from our investigators that the chances
are very, very good that we have more than two people
involved," sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said.
CNN reported that a note left by one of the gunmen

was a suicide note that indicated the two teen-agers
acted alone. "This is the way we want to go out," the
note said, according to CNN, which cited unidentified
sources.
Davis said he had no details on a note that was found
at one of the gunmen's homes.
Eric Harris. IS, and Dylan Klebold. 17. armed with
sawed-off shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and
homemade bombs stuffed with nails and shotgun shells,
killed 12 students and one teacher Tuesday before tak
ing their own lives.
The two bombs found yesterday used propane tanks
similar to those on backyard barbecue grills. Nails and
BBs had been taped to the tanks to create shrapnel.
"Twenty pounds of propane can create quite an
extensive amount of damage," Davis said.
District Attorney Dave Thomas said: "No one saw

them carry it into the school and people did see them
enter. So we have to explore how that device got into
the school."
Authorities had already been looking into the possi
bility of additional suspects because of the amount of
ammunition and explosives left behind.
"It's drawing suspicion out here that they would
have time to put as much ordnance in that school as
they did without some help," the sheriff said.
Fourteen people remained hospitalized, eight in crit
ical or serious condition.
Meanwhile, crews used bomb-sniffing dogs as they
carefully picked through thousands of backpacks, brief
cases and boxes strewn across the carpets, classrooms
and hallways. Investigators are also working to trace the
weapons to determine how the teen-agers got them.
Inside the heavily damaged school, officers began

collecting hundreds of pieces of evidence, including car
pet, fragments of windows, ceiling tiles and walls and
shrapnel.
"We have a very big crime scene and so much evi
dence to catalog, it will take days to collect it," Davis
said.
Despite intermittent, heavy snow, dozens of people
left bouquets, stuffed animals, cards and balloons in the
school colors of blue and silver at a makeshift memori
al in a park near the school. The mementos were piled
2 feet deep by early yesterday.
Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools
in the district reopened yesterday amid tight security.
Officers and school staff members plan "sweeps" and
greater security at entrances and exits. Stone said.
Officials said proms and graduations will go on as
scheduled.
