## Editorial Welcome, pro fros!

If you choose Stanford,
you will be making
a great decision

CONGRATULATIONS AND wel
come to the Farm. This weekend
you will have a chance to talk with
current students and faculty, try out under
graduate life at Stanford and meet other
admits to the Class of 2(X)3. As one of the
prospective freshmen from all over the
world, you have a wonderful opportunity
before you.
Of course, you have to make the big
decision first. We know you are going to
have a great time as pro fros, but we also
know that some of you are still weighing
your options. As you consider the Farm,
here are some things to think about:
Focus on Undergraduate Education:
Stanford isn't a liberal arts college, but it has
devoted much time and effort in recent
years to the enhancement of its undergrad
uate programs. Thanks to the Stanford
Introductory Studies program, every fresh
man and sophomore who wants to do so
can take a seminar with a senior faculty
member as an underclassman. Sophomore
College, a three-week program before the
start of fall quarter, provides a chance for
concentrated study in a particular field with
a professor. There is also plenty of faculty
support and funding for undergraduate
research. At Stanford, lecture classes are
taught by professors. While you may have
large lecture classes here, there are also
plenty of opportunities to take seminar
classes, to personalize your studies or even
design your own major.
Lifestyle: There's always something to
do on and around the Farm, ranging from
athletic events to guest lectures and from
swing dances to frat parties. Honestly,
where else can you listen to the school's
symphony orchestra perform on Friday
night and watch athletes in the nation's
most successful athletic program on Satur
day? While Stanford has its share of varsity
athletes and virtuosos, you can pursue ath
letics and the fine arts recreationally. Stan
ford has countless extracurricular options
and many students participate in communi

ty service projects. Plus, the Stanford cam
pus is safe â€” what other school has bicycle
theft as the most common crime?
Options: This is Stanford's mantra, its
blessing and, at times, its curse. At Stanford
the options are endless, and making choices
can be very tough. Academically speaking,
you can double major, minor, earn a Mas
ter's degree in four years, write a thesis,
study abroad and in some cases choose
from any of 20 or 30 different classes to ful
fill a distribution requirement. Vou will
have room for a sizeable number of elec
tives during your Stanford career. In addi
tion to all these options, Stanford provides a
variety of housing and dining options. For
example, there are traditional dormitories,
academic and ethnic theme houses, co-ops,
suites, apartments and the Greek system.
People: Stanford people are nice. We
are intelligent and inquisitive, but also very
down-to-earth. Our interests are very
diverse, but we all somehow manage to find
our niche here. We like to work, but we like
to have fun, too. It's all part of the Stanford
experience. And although we all study hard,
we aren't openly competitive.
Community: Lots of schools talk about
community, but Stanford really makes an
effort to create it. Life at Stanford is resi
dentially based, and all of the houses and
dormitories have a student staff to plan
social activities. Every Wednesday night, all
the dormitories have house meetings and
dining halls are sel up so that you eat with
the students in your house or dormitory.
Cutting edge: Fitting with its location in
the heart of I lie dynamic Silicon Valley,
Stanford is a forward-looking place. Far
from being steeped in tradition (but despite
popular belief, there is tradition at Stan
ford), the faculty and administration are
always studying current programs and
thinking about ways to better serve stu
dents. Best of all, students can play a role in
the process by serving on University and
department committees.
While you weigh your options, be sure to
take some quiet time this weekend to think
about who you are and what you want out
of your college. Go for a walk around Lake
Lagunita, jog to the Dish or just browse at
the Bookstore. If you choose Stanford, we
know you won't regret it.
