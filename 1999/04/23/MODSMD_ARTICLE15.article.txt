## The 						coming of the sprung

GLAZED IN sun
shine beside the
fountain in White
Plaza, a flax-golden, J.
Crew-clad, flesh-bearing,
dazzling daughter of Exis
tence, living in Otero,
majoring in studio art and

minoring in electrical engineering, splashes
into the water, climbs to the top of the Claw,
surveys the bright Stanford kingdom and
shouts: "I am the bee that has gathered too
much honey!"
She throws her arms to the open sky.
Balancing on the steel fountain's pinna
cle, she speaks to a modest but growing
crowd of students.
"Spring quarter is here! Winter, which
loves not skirts and flowers but darkness and
labor, is dead! The cold rain is gone. Scatter
and forget Winter's ashes!
"Time's hand has, without our knowing,
gently plucked us from winter and placed us
in a new season. However, this season is not
the spring but a season to which the spring
has given birth: the sprung!
"Spring was a season for rebirth, a time
for familiar entities to come again into being,
to return from existential hibernation. After
winter, the familiar practice of fountain hop
ping would begin to flourish just as it had
every spring past. After winter, ordinary
baby skunks would be born, just as they had
been every spring past. After winter, famil
iar. syrupy red popsicles would be eaten
again, just as they had been every spring past.
"The new spring — sprung— is a season
not for rebirth but for birth, a time for new
types of entities and unprecedented events to
enter into being for the first time. In the

sprung, new ways to use fountains will nour
ish. New types of baby skunks will be born.
New sorts of popsicles will be discovered
then consumed in revolutionary ways."
The dense, rapt, swelling crowd pushes
into the fountain, onto the Bookstore steps
and into the Old Union courtyard. From
opposite ends of the crowd, the distinctive
voices of University President Gerhard
Casper and Joe Euclid cry out in unison:
"Who are you? And what are you doing
at my University?!"
"I am Vanessa, Princess of the Sprung. 1
am a junior. I live in Otero. I run track, paint
and play trumpet in the Band. 1 am from
Kansas. 1 am weary from my wisdom, like
the bee who has gathered too much honey. I
know the true nature of the seasons and that
spring quarter has been overcome by the
sprung. Open your ears and mouths and I
will tell you of the seasons."
The crowd becomes still and listens.
" The fierce pursuit of treasured objec
tives belongs to winter. In winter, the cold
and the gray are managed by an obsession
with the good things to come. In winter, the
future obscures the past and the present. For
this season, all things are potential tools, all
days opportunities for work, all experiences
lor the sake of the mission. Any nonacadem
ic activity — showering, for instance — is
identified as procrastination.
"Spring, on the other hand, belongs not to
the future but to the past and to the present.
The vibrancy of spring's present obscures the
future. Without distant, visible goals, plan
ning and scheduling — normally tools for the
completion of complex, demanding
projects — are done only to the extent to
which they are, their utilitv aside, fun. In

spring, no person or thing is a means to an
end. Rather, each person or thing is an end in
itself. Thus the astonishingly wide selection
of Swiss chocolate available at the Bookstore
supplants careers as a topic of conversation.
"In the spring, all things and events arc
friendly and hallowed because there simply
is no grand mission for them to impede. The
absence of this grand mission gives us the
opportunity to be spontaneous in engaging
the things we notice. But the way in which we
do this is decided by the past. It is history that
tells us that a fountain is an object suitable
for hopping in. It is history that tells us that
the Dish is a good place for a picnic. We for
get the future in spring and thus gain the
freedom to picnic and fountain hop. In the
spring we act whimsically in the present but
defer our choice of activity to the prescrip
tions of the past.
"Spring is dead. This spring quarter we
will exist in the sprung, a season which con
stitutes a time and space without past or
future. It belongs purely to the present.
"In the sprung, however, all things are not
ends in themselves. All things are friendly
and hallowed, but only because in each lies
the opportunity for an original creation. In
breaking one's leg lies the opportunity to
invent and master the most deadly martial
art man has ever known: drunken, monkey
style crutch kung fu. In a fountain lies the
potential for bacchanalian parties, structural
additions of your own choosing or a pulpit of
your own making."
