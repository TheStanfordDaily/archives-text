Kule missed major issues
I'm writing in response to Auren Kule's
letter to the editor on Monday. Some of the
arguments Kule makes against endorse
ments are not new. Specifically, the notion
that The Daily holds a monopoly on infor
mation on campus and therefore should not
publish endorsements is an argument I've
heard since my freshman year on the Farm.
The argument is definitely a valid one.
However, Kule goes on to make asser
tions about what a "real" newspaper is sup
posed to do and how it is supposed to act.
Kule makes the argument that The Daily
shows an inability as a news source to dis
play a specific political stance, like The New
York Times or the New York Daily News.
I agree, but I believe this argument is a
compliment rather than a criticism. I don't
think that The Daily or any other newspa
per should take a political stance in its news
pages. That stance is dangerous. Once a
newspaper takes a political stance in its
news reporting, it begins to trade its solid
journalism for shoddy reporting. The goal
for any reporter should be unbiased cover
age. The writer should report both sides of
a story, quote sources with differing opin
ions and let the reader decide how to lean.
While subconscious biases are no doubt
present in a reporter's coverage, it seems far
worse and much more dangerous for a writ
er to actually strive to be biased in reporting
certain events. Kule also makes the argu
ment that The Daily fails to "stick to its
guns" after an election. What readers need
to realize is that the news department is
intentionally a separate entity from the

opinions department and the editorial
board. Endorsements made by the editorial
board should have no influence on how a
news editor does his or her job.
The news department should report the
facts in an unbiased way free from any
"political stance." If ASSU President
Maren Norten and Vice President Santos
Marroquin have made newsworthy accom
plishments, then part of a news editor's job
is to report those accomplishments. 1 don't
believe this is the same as "kissing the butt
of the current regime," as Kule put it.
There is a difference between a newspa
per's news pages and its opinions (or edito
rial) pages. I think we all need to keep that
difference in mind when we digest informa
tion from The Daily's pages.

Genocides deserve dignity
President Clinton declared that part of
NATO's goal in opposing Slobodan Milose
vic's program is to prevent this century from
ending the way it began. We should all sup
port this mission of preventing history's
vicious habit of repeating itself. Unfortu
nately, many obstacles stand in the way.
This Saturday marks the 84th anniver
sary of the Ottoman Turkish slaughter of
1.5 million Armenians during World War I.
Though this has been declared a genocide
by the United Nations and the European
Union, the Turkish government continues
to deny it. Rather than trying to prove what
has already been proven by decades of

scholarly examination by international
sources, I will comment on the real signifi
cance' of this issue — Turkey's denial of its
own genocidal past and its continuation of
egregious offenses against human rights.
The Turkish government has devised
increasingly insidious ways of denying that
the genocide occurred. Turkey has coerced
the U.S. government on the issue of recog
nition by threatening to close U.S. air bases.
In the Turkish government tried to
force the cancellation of a Tel Aviv aca
demic conference where the Armenian
genocide was to be discussed by threatening
the safety of Jews in Turkey. The U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum reported
threats over a plan to reference the Arme
nian genocide in its exhibits. The Turkish
government pays U.S. public relations firms
millions to cleanse its human rights image.
Today, the Turkish government would
like the world to believe that the systematic
extermination of a defenseless and stateless
people was a civil war. Slobodan Milosevic,
an astute student of history, employs this
same propaganda to shield his genocidal
activities in Kosovo. Like Milosevic, Turkey
relies on its lack of freedom of the press to
suppress domestic opposition.
The Turkish government has even
attempted to export this technique here. It
funds chairs of Turkish history at many elite
American universities to cleanse its image
and deny its past. Prof. Heath Lowry. who
holds the Ataturk Chair of Turkish Studies
at Princeton University (endowed by
$75(),(KK) from Turkey), has been exposed as
working closely with the Turkish govern
ment to discredit scholarship about the
Armenian genocide. This unconscionable

etlort has drawn the concern of some of this
nation's most respected scholars and intel
lectuals who have signed a petition con
demning the efforts of the Turkish govern
ment and charlatans like Lowry. including
Arthur Miller. Kurt Vonnegut, John
Updike, Seamus Heaney, Joyce Carol
Oates, Norman Mailer and Henry Louis
Gates Jr. These scholars know that allowing
the Turkish government to escape the con
sequences of the genocide allows it to con
tinue its policy of human rights violations
against the Kurds.
Denial is the final stage of genocide; it
murders the dignity of the survivors and
destroys the remembrance of the crime.
Denial of genocide strives to reshape histo
ry in order to absolve the perpetrators and
demonize the victims. The Turkish govern
ment's denial of the Armenian genocide
encourages the current programs that deny
the Holocaust and the Cambodian genocide
and encourages recent episodes in Rwanda,
Burma, Bosnia and Kosovo. Sadly, the
same officials in the Clinton administration
who have chosen not to tolerate Milosevic's
actions, have kept silent on the issue.
It may be stretching to believe that
recognition of the Armenian genocide may
have prevented Milosevic's murderous ram
page; nevertheless, a strong stand by Wash
ington years ago may have communicated a
message of intolerance about such acts to
would-be perpetrators. We must acknowl
edge the past before we ensure the future.
The important part of never again is never.
