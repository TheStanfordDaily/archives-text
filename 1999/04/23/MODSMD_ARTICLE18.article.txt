# Bringing it all back home
## That's me in the corner; that's me in the spotlight

I LOST THE star at the end of my fresh
man year in high school. It was a gold
star oi David, hung on a chain around
my neck. My uncle had given it to me just
before he passed away, and he had worn it
ever since he came back from Israel almost
20 years before. I spent days looking
around my school for it, feeling a part of
him being lost, agonizing over breaking a
connection to the land that he had loved
most. I think my uncle regretted leaving
Israel for his entire life, always wanting to
go back. I felt like I had betrayed his faith,
his love for the spiritual homeland of his
religious and cultural heritage, just by los
ing that star.
I haven't given much thought to my reli
gion in the last few years; college often
seems to discourage or, at least, distract us
from focusing on our spirituality. Intellec
tualism and vigorous debate are champi
oned as the college way, but faith? Reli
gious devotion? I don't know too many
people who engage in such activity, other
than kneeling before that white porcelain
god after an especially spiritual night.

Many of us spent our childhoods endur
ing mandatory Sunday school, boring ser
vices and endless holidays with only a
vague idea of their possible meaning or
importance. I wasted much of my bar mitz
vah. the party to end all parties, riding up
and down elevators in the hotel. It was
quite a rush, but other than that intense
visceral experience, I know I had no grasp
of any particular significance attached to
the celebration (the only thing 13-year-old
boys can grasp is which girl in their class is
"developing" the fastest).
In high school, like many of my fellow
youth. I joined a religion-based youth
group, whose main function was to
encourage spiritual make-out sessions (or
other such transcendental behavior)
between teen-agers of the same faith. Or
at least that was the reason I joined. But I
gradually got more into the real religious
aspect of it; beginning to develop my own
conception of what exactly "God" was,
while growing close to some really good
people who happened to share my reli
gious background. I traveled to Israel and

experienced my own powerful connection
to the place, which remains despite my
personal reservations about its govern
ment's Palestinian policy. I tried to go to
services a fair amount. I felt a part of those
"5,000 years of tradition" my parents were
always talking about, and it was a really
good feeling.
Then I came to college, and all those
years seemed to vanish almost overnight. 1
got involved in other things, and memories
of Judaism started to slip away. Like every
thing else, college seems to polarize ideas
about religion into two opposing camps.
You have the fundamentalist, Bible
thumping fanatics attempting desperately
to proselytize to a larger community of sec
ular, cynical heathens. 1 attached myself to
this philosophy, ignoring the ideas and
lifestyles of those "fanatics" (my room
mate included) and refusing to believe that
my own sophisticated cynicism could ever
be compromised again by some notion of
faith. But I know better now. I realized
that religion does not equal fanaticism.
So this year I've often surrounded

myself with members of my childhood reli
gion. searching for lost bonds and a
regained sense of community. And in
many ways, 1 feel like 1 have found that
community again or am starting to find it. I
like being around other Jews — we share a
sense of tradition, culture and sometimes
even values. But I haven't noticed a dra
matic increase in my spirituality.
Religion does not equal fanaticism, but
it also doesn't have to equal spirituality.
I've realized that these two are not always
intertwined, nor do they have to be. There
were times in high school when I did feel
spiritually connected to the Jewish faith.
But there have been times here in college,
times spent with non-Jews or just by myself
when I've felt more moved in some sort of
divine, mystical way than during any time
spent chanting Hebrew prayers or fasting
for Yom Kippur. Amazing conversation,
intense introspection, coincidences too
crazy to he mere coincidences, beautiful
moonless nights — all of these things have
had a vivid spiritual impact on me, just as,
or even more, important than the bonds

I've felt with fellow Jews.
What's the point here? Well, examine
yourselves. Figure out if you feel some
thing missing. Go hack to those services
you've ignored, rediscover that shared
community of traditions and values you've
forgotten about. Or go for a walk up in the
hills one quiet night, by yourself or with a
good friend. Go beyond your usual daily
grind to look for something intangible,
something like faith or religion or spiritual
ity. You might find something amazing.
I wear a mezuzah on a chain around my
neck now, a Jewish pendant that I found in
Jerusalem two years after 1 lost that star. I
touch it and feel my own connection to my
faith and religion and remember those
times that defied any rational description,
that left me speechless. Maybe my uncle
felt the same emotions when he touched
his star.
1 like to think so.
