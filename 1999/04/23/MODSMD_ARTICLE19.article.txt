As prospective freshmen from all
over the country pour into campus
for Admit Weekend, their interna
tional counterparts are staying home.
Very few international students
take the opportunity to visit before
the regular school year, according to
Jonathan Reider, the senior associate
director of admissions who works di
rectly with international admissions.
"The distance, cost and paper
work keeps them away," Reider ex
plained. "It is very difficult to obtain
visas because they are not registered
students."
In an effort to make the transition
to the United States as easy as possi
ble, the International I Jndergraduate
Community have been playing the
role of telephone hosts. They are call
ing international admits toencourage
them to attend Stanford and answer
questions about a campus they prob

ably will not see before they arrive in
September.
lUC President Arijit Sengupta
said international students often
have questions about their financial
aid packages, dining services, acade
mics and American life in general.
"I remember that last year a stu
dent from Sri Lanka had no idea that
he had been admitted because of the
mail strikes in his country," Sengupta
said. "Our phone call was the only
thing that let him know that he was
coming to Stanford."
Rie lUC serves the international
community in other ways. When stu
dents arrive in September, the lUC"
organizes a three-day International
Orientation before regular Orienta
tion. Since most international stu
dents do not arrive with their parents,
the lUC greets them at the airport.
"It was such a great feeling to ar
rive in the United States and see a
smilinu face waiting for me with a

Welcome to Stanford' banner and
balloons," said sophomore Chris
Lee. who hails from Australia. "It re
ally makes you feel like somebody
cares about you. Believe me, in those
first few days you really need the
extra attention," he said.
The lUC also provides food for in
ternational students during the days
before the dining halls open to fresh
men and new students. The club also
organizes a special dinner in which
students can meet Reider, the man
who admitted them, and John Pear
son. the director of the Bechtel In
ternational Center.
They also hold workshops on 1-20
student visas and immigration laws
and pass out information on how to
obtain a social security number.
The lUC was founded three years
ago to ensure that orientation for in
ternational students would continue
despite budget cuts for regular Ori
entation. Sengupta said.

Although the lUC manages to
provide comprehensive services de
spite being funded only by its $1,500
special fee, many international stu
dents feel that the University should
participate more directly.
"The University should think
about giving funding. It really is pret
ty necessary," said Lex Bayer, a
sophomore from South Africa. "In
ternational students need the cushion
of International Orientation."
"At least the lUC is dynamic, it
covers up for what the University
does not do." Lee added.
University officials respond that
part of the benefit of International
Orientation is that it is student-run
and student-funded.
"Students take the responsibility
for putting on the Orientation, and I
think that is great," Reider said. "I
think that the fact that it is funded by
the special fee is a gesture of solidari
ty from the rest of the student bodv."
