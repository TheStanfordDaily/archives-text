## Softball slides into heart of Pac-10 No. 12 Stanford up against No. 5 Washington, top-ranked UCLA 
### Gabby Duno Staff writer 
Get ready, softball fans... the
Huskies and Bruins are coming to
town.
In what promises to be an exiting
weekend, the No. 12 Stanford soft
ball team (34-15, 4-10 Pacific 10
Conference) will host two of the best
teams in the nation. On Saturday,
the Cardinal will take on No. 5
Washington (31-11, 7-6) in a heated
doubleheader. Sunday's matchup
features the No. 1 team in the nation,
UCLA (45-2,12-2).

■ Tomorrow: No. 12 Stanford (34-
15, 4-10 Pacific 10 Conference) vs.

"Rankings don't matter to us."
said senior shortstop Michelle
Schneider. "No one is unbeatable in
the Pac-10."
Schneider is right about the com
petition in the Pac-10. Washington
has suffered eleven losses this sea
son — six of which came to Pac-10
opponents. The top-ranked Bruins
were posting an undefeated record
until April 3, when they lost a 4-1 de
cision to the Huskies. Since then,
UCLA has also lost to No. 8 Oregon
State.
Still, it's hard not to notice the
rankings. Stanford, once ranked as
high as seventh, has dropped in this
week to No. 12. The Huskies have

spent most of the season at the No. 4
spot, but have gone back and forth
between four to five. UCLA's name
has been pinned to the No. 1 spot all
season long. And that doesn't in
clude the rest of the Pac-10 teams.

"We're really exited

to start the sec-

ond half of the Pac-10 season,"
Schneider said.
The games against the Huskies
and Bruins could rejuvenate Stan
ford and put the Cardinal back into
the Pac-10 race. Despite Washing
ton and UCLA's high rankings and
impressive records. Stanford stands
a good chance.
Just last month, the Cardinal split
a doubleheader with the Huskies in
Washington. Washington has been
batting .283 as a team while limiting

opponents to .175.
( Stanford will look
| to the power hit-
I ting of freshmen
Jessica Mendoza

and Sarah Beeson and junior
Kellie Wiginton to counter the
Huskies' pitching.

UCLA's numbers are even
more impressive. The
Bruins come to Stanford

fresh off some Pac-10 ac
colades. Junior first base

man Julie Marshall

was named
Pa c -

10 player of the week last week after
going 10-for-18 (.555) with five
home runs and 13 RBI last week.
As if leading the Pac-10 in team
batting average (.351), home runs
(66), hits (441), RBI (282), doubles
(84), slugging percentage (.579) and
fielding percentage (.974) was not
enough, the Bruins are also domi
nating on the national level.
UCLA's 45-2 record works out to
a .976 winning percentage — the

best in the country. The Bruins

are ranked second in team bat
ting average, seventh in scor

ing (6.51 rpg), third in fielding ]
percentage and seventh in '
pitching (1.09 ERA).

Sophomore AU-American
catcher/first baseman Stacey Nu
veman and Marshall rank No. I
and No. 2 in the nation in RBIs.

Nuveman also leads the nation
with 21 home runs. Last week, she
broke UCLA's home run record in a
game against Loyola Marvmount
when she recorded her 21st of the
season. She set the record in 1997
after hitting 20 homers in her fresh
man year.

Marcy Crouch are one of the best

though, they will have some tough

UCLA's Courtney Dale is fifth in
the nation in pitching victories (23)
and is the only undefeated pitcher in
the rankings. The Bruins have held
opponents to a .178 batting average
while posting a 1.41 ERA. The aver
age ERA for Bruin opponents is
7.60.

Senior Michele Acosta drives to the plate earlier this year. This weekend may determine the fate of the team's slumping Pac-10 season, as
they face two top-five teams in doubleheaders at home.
Historically, UCLA is a softball
powerhouse.
The team holds 10 league titles
and 8 national titles. On March 31,
the Bruins had their best start ever
with a 34-0 record. In 1992, UCLA
began its season 33-0 before going
on to win the national champi
onship.
Interestingly, much this season's
dominance has come from a contro
versy that occurred last year. Dur
ing the 1998 season, the Bruins
were on probation for scholarship
violations. UCLA strategized and
redshirted six players.
Clearly, the Bruins and Huskies
will be hard to beat, but the Stan
ford players believe they can do it.
