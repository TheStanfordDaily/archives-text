Last Saturday the men's and women's
teams met their goals and proved they are on
the right track to a stellar end-of-season per
formance. The men finished second to No. 1
California at the California Collegiate Rowing
Championships. Although Cal did not send
their best boat, it was a strong race by the Car
dinal against the top-ranked program.

Senior co-captain Nate Matter described
the team's performance as "solid'' and said it
proved Stanford's strength above other Cali
fornia programs, as they finished with a six sec
ond lead over the third place boat.
Although the Cardinal had a sluggish start,
it was one of the Cardinal's best races of the
season.
"We went out for the first I.(KK) hard and
were able to relax for the second half." said se
nior co-captain John Shedolsky, who viewed
the race as a step towards a top finish at Pacif
ic 10 Conference.
The Stanford women's varsity eight also
had a strong showing, finishing fourth.
"Despite a slow start, we fought from the
500 [meter mark ] to finish line." senior co-cap
tain Katie Sears. "Our biggest accomplish
ment was beating Davis. After the race it felt
like we won the whole race."
UC-Davis has beaten Stanford twice this
season and lost this weekend to the Cardinal
by one second. Stanford will now be seeded
above Davis for Pac-lOs.
This weekend the 20th-ranked men's team
will face Oregon State and Sacra
mento State at Stanford's Redwood
("ity home course.
The Cardinal will focus on No. 16
osu.
"Our important race is on Satur
day versus Oregon State," Matter
said. "They are historically as last, if
not faster, than us."
Success in the upcoming week
end is essential to keep the rhythm
of the squad improving. The
Beavers have defeated Stanford the

last three years in close races. This
year Oregon State looks like a sur
mountable challenge to the Cardi
nal.
"We're pretty confident that
we're going to heat them," Shedol
sky said.
Although the team's focus is Ore
gon State. Sacramento State will also
be competitive after a third place fin
ish behind Stanford last weekend.
The return last weekend of senior
Jason Marsh, the most experienced
member of the team, will continue to
help the team.
The team trained in long seg
ments earlv this week and is now

working on short sprints and reach
ing race speed.
The women have also been train
ing intensely, preparing, for a long
weekend of competition.
"We've been working on apply
ing more power to our starts and the
lengthening our stroke," Sears said.
Sears described the competition
level as hard to predict, but the Car
dinal is aware that the Hornets are a
strong team.
"We just have to grit our teeth
and go out and race," she said.
"We're excited to see where we are.
It's a great weekend to polish up and
refine our racing skills."
