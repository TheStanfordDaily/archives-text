# Hawaii-bound
## Women aim high 
### Becky Blanchard Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's sailing
team is packing plenty of confi
dence for the Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate Yacht Racing women's
championship at Hawaii. The
Cardinal heads into weekend
competition stocked with talent,
experience and a No. 9 national
ranking, making it a district fa
vorite for a berth to the Intercol
legiate Yacht Racing Association
women's championship in St. Pe
tersburg. Fla.. in May.
"I'd be really, really surprised
if we didn't qualify," said head
coach Steve Bourdow.

■ Tomorrow-Sunday: No. 9
Stanford women at Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Yacht Racing
Championships.

While the Stanford women
appear to be the favorite, 14th
ranked Hawaii, the only other na
tionally-ranked PCIYRA team,
will likely be chasing them from
second place. Bourdow expects
USC. which boasts one of the dis
trict's top skippers, and UC-
Santa Barbara to compete for the
remaining national berths.
The number of berths allotted
to each district is determined by
participation in the district cham
pionship regatta. According to
Bourdow, the PCIYRA will like
ly advance either three or four
teams to the national champi
onship.
Gusty conditions, which are
expected for the weekend, should
help the Cardinal in its bid for the
district title. The Stanford pro
gram focuses on sailing well in
windy conditions and has plenty
of opportunities to train for heavy
air in the breezy Bay Area.
"If it's windy, we're definitely
the odds-on favorite," Bourdow
said.
With two Stanford boats on
the water at a time, the team's
lineup will be determined by the
weather. If winds are heavy, se
nior co-captain Taylor Robinson
and junior Anika Leerssen will
skipper for the Cardinal.
Leerssen and sophomore
Heather Porter are slated to com
pete in light to medium wind con
ditions.
Porter has gotten solid racing
experience this season and will
compete in all three district com
petitions — the team racing,
women's and dinghy champi
onships.
"Heather has been sailing
coed all year, so she has gotten a
lot of experience this year."
Bourdow said.
Leerssen. who did not com
pete winter quarter, lias posted
impressive finishes this spring.
Earlier this month, she took first
place in the A' division of the
President's Cup with crew A\lexis
Krivkovich.
Juniors Katie Gregg and
Krivkovich and sophomore Sally
Madsen will be Stanford's
crewmembers. Gregg and
Krivkovich are both coming off a
sound team performance at last
weekend's PCIYRA team racing
championship.
According to Bourdow, the
team's racing experience this
year should give the Cardinal a
good chance to reach its goal of a
top-five finish in the ICYRA na
tional championship, where the
team finished 12th last year.
However, even if Stanford
cruises through the PCIYRA
championship, the Cardinal will
have to prepare for much more
difficult competition from strong
Atlantic Coast programs at the
national level.
All eight teams currently
ranked ahead of Stanford are
from the East Coast.
