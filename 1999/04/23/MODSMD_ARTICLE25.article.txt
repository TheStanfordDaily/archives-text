# Hot-hitting Stanford heads across Bay

### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
In truth. California is not a great
baseball team.
Though sophomores Xavier Nady
and Mike Tonis are two of the better
players in college baseball, the rest of
the lineup is struggling. The Golden
Bears (20-26, 6-9 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), who will host fourth-ranked
Stanford (27-11, 12-3) this weekend,
are batting only .269, and the pitching
staff is giving up more than 6 runs a
game.

The Cardinal will try to forget all
that, though. Coming off of a tough
17-15 loss to No. 1 7 (JSC Sunday that
evened the Pac-lOrace with the Tro
jans. Stanford is trying not to over
look anyone in its quest for the league
championship.
"It's tough to predict any game in
this conference,'" said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "II Cal plays
well and we don't play like we're ca
pable of. we'll get beat. We know
that."
Marquess better hope his team re
members that because, though Cal is
seventh out of nine teams in the
league, the Bears arc capable of
harming Stanford's Pac-1() title
hopes.
The ( ardinal is locked in a tie with
USC with only nine conference
games remaining. While Stanford has
the easier schedule, playing against
three of the four worst teams in the
league, the Trojans do have the talent
to win all of their remaining games, as

they showed hy taking two out of
three at Sunken Diamond last week
end.
So Stanford must forget its loss to
USC and keep the pressure on
against Cal.
"I have a sense that there's not
going to be a letdown this weekend
after USC," Marquess said. "We've
looked sharp and had some good
practices this week. That doesn't nec
essarily mean that we'll play well, hut
it won't he a situation where we're
not ready to play mentally."
If the Cardinal is truly ready to
play this weekend, it should he able to
handle California.
Most of Cal's production has
come from only two men, Nady and
Tonis. If Stanford's deep pitching
staff can deal with them, it should fare
well.
That could be difficult because
Tonis and Nady. the 199K Freshman
Player of the Year, are having out
standing seasons.
Nady, a preseason Ail-American,
is hitting .381 with 54 RBlsand a .SI 2
slugging percentage. His 21 home
runs lead the Pac-10, rank third in the
nation and are one below Cal's sin
gle-season record.
Tonis is not putting as many runs
on the board in Cal's hitter-friendly
Evans Diamond, but his .410 average,
13 home runs and 44 RBIs are im
pressive nonetheless.
The rest of the Golden Bear of
fense, however, is decidedly unim
pressive. ()nly one other player is hit
ting above .3(X) and many starters are
below .240.
Most weak hitting teams count on
strong pitching to keep them in the
game, but Cal has found little on the
mound to be proud of either.
Junior right-hander Jon Shirley
(5-4. 4.15 ERA) has been the only
consistent starter, but he will have his
work cut out for him tonight. He is
scheduled to start against Stanford's
dominant right-hander Jason Young
(6-3,3.16), a Berkeley native.
The Cardinal offense, which aver-

aged more than 11 runs a game in its
last five contests, should be looking to
feast on the rest of the Cal staff.
Though it struggled early in the
season, the offense has finally hit its
stride in Pac-10 competition, raising
its team average to .304 in the
process. Five starters, including Joe
Borchard at .399, are now hitting over
.300 and many others are inching
closer.
The recent outpouring of offen
sive production bodes well for the
Cardinal in multiple ways. Besides

obviously putting runs on the board,
it helps the pitchers and defense too,
according to Marquess.
"It takes a lot of pressure off the
pitchers when they have some runs to
work with." he said. "When we got
[pitcher] Justin Wayne some runs
[Saturday], he could relax a little and
go after some guys."
And go after them he did. Wayne
struck out a career-high 14 batters in
a complete-game, four-hit, 13-2 win.
He retired 1K of the last 19 batters he
faced.

Stanford will probably not need
such stellar performances to beat Cal
this weekend. However, ii it wants to
stay atop the Pac-10, the Cardinal
would do well to treat every game
against Cal — and Oregon State and
UCLA to follow — like the College
World Series.
Because, though Marquess is right
when he says the Pac-10 champi
onship is not all-important, he admits
that "on the road to the postseason,
the biggest accomplishment would be
to win the conference."

Junior second baseman Jeff Rizzo takes a mighty cut at the plate. Rizzo will help spearhead a surging
Stanford offense as they try to recover from last weekend's losses to USC.
