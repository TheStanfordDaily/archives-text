## Three of the nation's top schools — including Stanford — make their cases to Pro Fros 
### 
Editor's note: Student newspaper writers at several of
the nation's top universities collaborated this week on a
series of articles to he printed at each participating
school's admit weekend. Three of those schools — Stan
ford, Harvard and Williams — are featured here. The
articles detail the ups and downs of life at the colleges
from a student perspective.
Stanford
The theme of Stanford is "opportunity." Stanford
students have the opportunities to take large lecture
classes or small seminars, live in dormitories or vege
tarian cooperative houses, conduct undergraduate
original research, act in a student-written and pro
duced musical comedy, or anything in between. That,
in one paragraph, is the essence of Stanford.
Stanford students live on a traditional college cam
pus. executed in sandstone with red-tile roofs. The
most important buildings of the University are inside
the Campus Drive loop; the majority of classes are
taught behind the arches of the main Quadrangle and
the newly constructed Science and Engineering Quad,
and most undergraduates live in the vast array of
dorms and houses that ring the heart of campus.
Living conditions vary from cookie-cutter dorm
rooms to unique rooms in converted mini-mansions.
Where you live depends on the luck of the "Draw," a
housing-assignment lottery that happens each spring.
Students spend most of their time on campus, where
the bicycle is the dominant form of transportation. In
sprawling suburban California, getting off campus vir
tually requires a car; public transportation is somewhat
limited. Although it is possible to get along without a
car, those without jokingly call the Stanford campus
"the Bubble."
But don't worry. In the opinion of the vast majority
of students, campus life at Stanford is simply amazing.
The opportunities you'll have to explore the lives of
those around you is incredible — be prepared to be
come deeply connected with students, staff and faculty
alike.
\ In dorms, dinners with faculty are regularly pro
grammed: dorm patriotism (complete with dorm bat
tle-cries and chants) is fostered: birthdays are celebrat
ed religiously. In the more independently minded
houses, happy hours and barbecues abound. For when
you need to bump and grind, a small but lively Greek
system throws all-campus parties nearly every week
end. And did we mention the weather?
The California sunshine contributes to the abun
dance of extra-curricular activities here. Intramural
sports, clubs and community service through the mul
titude of organizations and Greek chapters involve
most students.
And Stanford would not be the same without the
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band, a
decidedly non-traditional group of musicians with a
flair for satire.
As for our love lives, busy Stanford students rarely
go on dates in the traditional sense. People tend to
hang out in groups, which then sometimes spawns ro
mance.
For the bustle of the city, the cultural center of San
Francisco is an easy trip north by car, or an hour ride
on Caltrain. Organized dorm or house trips to
Yosemite or Lake Tahoe (excellent skiing!) happen
often as well. Day trips to Monterey, Santa Cruz and
other area attractions are common, but again, you'll
need a car or to know someone who has one. Palo Alto
offers little more than upscale cafes and restaurants to
take your date to before a semi-formal or swing party.
It's not a college town, but your mother will love it.
Living costs at Stanford are only surpassed by the
cost of living in surrounding Santa Clara County, the
most expensive place to live in the country. Yes, it costs
more than Manhattan. Thus, few students live off cam
pus: you need the salary of a computer industry CEO
to do so, literally. Shopping and eating is also expen
sive, a common complaint among students.
The 10-week academic quarter system at Stanford is
fast paced. But the vast majority of Stanford students
find ways to balance their extra-curricular activities
with their schoolwork. Unfortunately, one of the com
mon characteristics of Stanford students is that we're
overloaded and over-committed.
It's widely known that many of Stanford's depart
ments, especially those in "techie" science and engi
neering fields, are second to none. Computer science,
electrical engineering, and physics, among others, are
particularly famous, having produced computer indus
try luminaries such as Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo!, as

well as several Nobel Prizes.
Stanford's "fuzzy" social science and humanities
departments, especially history, political science, and
economics, are large, strong and well funded. Unfortu
nately, many complain that the performing and visual
arts are virtually ignored.
Student-initiated research is popular on campus.
Last year, the Undergraduate Research Opportunities
office gave out $650,(XX) in research grants to 486 stu
dents across all fields.
Finally, no one can discuss Stanford without men
tioning athletics. Stanford is strong in high-profile
sports such as basketball and a powerhouse in sports

such as tennis, swimming, and cross country. To get
their hands on coveted men's basketball season tickets
this year, students camped out two weeks in advance
outside Maples Pavilion. And we've got the Axe. the
trophy given to the winner of the annual football Big
Game with UC-Berkeley.
As Dick Vitale said when he body surfed the stu
dent section crowd this year at a basketball game. "It's
all about Stanford, baby!"
Harvard
You may have already taken the tour. You've seen
the Statue of the Three Lies, and maybe you even
rubbed the foot, poor thing. You've talked to the end
lessly cheerful folks in Byerly Hall. And chances are, if
you got in, you will end up coming here (last year,
about SO percent of admitted students did). To help
you make an informed choice, here's the real Harvard,
complete with terrible teaching fellows, intermittent
social life and weird naked rituals.
But there's also amazing housing, absorbing ex
tracurriculars and fascinating fellow students. Here
are the facts. You decide.
You might expect that academics will be the pinna
cle of your Harvard career. After all. it can't be the din
ing halls' savory baked tofu or the glorious architec
ture of Canaday Hall that win Harvard top honors in
the U.S. News &World Report survey every year.
The dirty little secret about Harvard is that you can
read Aristotle anywhere in the world for $8.99 and the
price of a bookmark.
You can even find someone to teach it to you who's
bright, funny and doesn't have to jet off to the State
Department every afternoon.
But that's not to say there aren't real advantages to
Harvard's academic life. You might not be able to
track down Af-Am guru Henry Louis "Skip" Gates Jr.

or former Reagan economic boss Martin S. Feldstein
in person, but you can sit in on their lectures.
How much personal contact you "11 have with pro
fessors depends on how hard you're willing to try,
though. Most professors, and a few students, claim that
office hours are a treat and doors are always open. But
most undergrads are too busy-or intimidated-to ever
bother.
Harvard is best known for its largest departments,
Economics and Government, popular with the Adidas
set (they don't call 'em gov jocks for nothing). These
departments are vast and impersonal but have bless
edly lax requirements. An alternate route is the make-

Mom-crvconcentration-Folklore and Mythology, any
one?
Of course, it's not as important what you study as
what you do. The lifeblood of Harvard is its extracur
ricular universe; with more than 250 independent stu
dent groups, everyone gets to be president.
However, even though 1 larvard has a $13 billion en
dowment salted away, most student groups are forced
to make do with pennies. Many students were out
raged when the administration announced plans earli
er this year to rebuild a historic ornamental tower on
Memorial Hall rather than a desperately needed stu
dent center.
Sports teams have little trouble getting money,
though. Surprisingly. Harvard even has a few good
teams. The women's hockey team won a national
championship this year, and men's tennis includes the
best player in the country.
But forget lectures — what you're probably won
dering. is the social life as terrible as you've heard?
Legend has it that Harvard is inhabited by a tribe of
pasty-faced "former" geeks for whom social life con
sists of reading Nietzsche into the wee hours and
checking e-mail obsessively. That isn't true, of course..
. or at least, it isn't entirely true.
If you're looking for students in their preferred ele
ment. try the banks of the Charles River, Harvard's
most beautiful vista on warm days. But this is not Stan
ford — Cambridge weather is spastic, and the occa
sional summery spats in the dreariest, snowiest months
are a cruel taunt.
One thing virtually every Harvard student has in
common is ambition. This is the Type A capital of the
world-students are driven in their academics, their ex
tracurriculars. even their socializing. ("We have to go
party now!")
But when you peel away the intensity, your fellow
Harvard men and women are surprisingly normal.

You're just as likely to bond with your peers this week
end over "Saved by the Bell" and Molly Ringwald as
philosophy or politics.
In a way, that's what your Harvard cafeer will be all
about — balancing Shakespearean sonnets and "Six
teen Candles." Don't forget — Harvard is still college.
You're here to have a good time, and you probably
will. But don't buy everything you hear in Byerly Hall.
Williams
Williams, a private college known for its dedicated
faculty, dynamic student groups, and unique pro
grams, has been one of the top three liberal arts col
leges in the nation for years.
Williams has about 2,()(H) students, with a portion of
juniors abroad every semester. If you're into mascots,
ours is the Eph. And no, there is no such thing as an
Eph — it's the shortened name of our founder. Colonel
Ephraim Williams. The physical representation of the
Eph is a purple cow.
At all colleges, including Williams, scholarly de
mands on professors are high. However, Williams
profs endeavor to maximize their teaching potential. It
is guaranteed that your prof will teach your class; TAs
never teach and graduate students (of which there are
few) only take classes. Profs are enthusiastic about
meeting with students — during office hours as well as
other times. It is common to see students and profs in
the Snack Bar or in Cold Springs Coffee Roasters, a
comfortable cafe on Spring Street.
Classes at Williams are small, although introducto
ry courses of the 101 genre can be somewhat large (as
in 80, not 200). Size usually decreases after you choose
your major. For an externally competitive school, cut
throat behavior between students is surprisingly ab
sent: personal goals are more the focus. There is a
sense that everyone's grades are stellar, but GPAs are
rarely discussed explicitly.
Involvement in sports is also widespread, and teams
are generally successful. Sporting events against
archrival Amherst are always packed, invariably in
cluding someone in a dorky cow outfit.
Still, it is the rare student that claims the "jock"
identity only. Don't be surprised to see a sculpture by
a top swimmer, or a track star in an a cappella group.
The newly-built Spencer Art Building is the home for
many a budding artist, and a cappella is hugely popu
lar: there are presently nine different groups. One of
Williams' special offerings is Independent Music Pro
ject. which allows student composers to create and per
form works for the community.
The mythological purple cow symbolically links
Williams to its rural surroundings: we are about as far
as we can be from Boston and still be in the same state,
and Vermont is 10 minutes away. This can be an asset
or a disadvantage, depending on what you like.
The isolated location means that most students stay
on campus during the weekends, which leads to a sense
of common identity in the so-called "Purple Bubble."
The remoteness also encourages students to have an
active role in campus activities, of which there are
more than 75.
The limited surroundings require you to get cre
ative with dates — if you have any. Williams' dating
scene is debatably lacking, though it may not be an un
common college phenomenon. Part of the problem is
that the town is asleep by 11 p.m.; only Subway and the
two bars stay open until 2 a.m. The party policy was re
vised recently; without invites secured by your house
president, getting in can be difficult.
Smaller parties are usually better, though you and
your buddies will fund them.
One program that helps alleviate the sense of isola
tion is Winter Study, a January term that provides a
change of pace between fall and spring semesters. Stu
dents choose one course from a broad array of offer
ings. including EMT Training. Auto Mechanics and
Journalism.
Students appreciate that housing at Williams is an
anomaly in the college world; there is no theme hous
ing or eating club system, and students voted fraterni
ties out of existence in the 19605. The majority of stu
dents live in comfortable and clean on-campus hous
ing: it is mostly seniors who live off-campus.
If you are the type of student who immediately wants
to specialize, requirements in the three divisions (Lan
guages and the Arts. Social Studies and Science and
Mathematics) may not be your bag. But for a student who
values exploring a variety of disciplines, appreciates the
arts and athletics, and would enjoy seeing familiar faces all
over campus, Williams could be a great fit.

You may have already taken the tour. You've seen
the Statue of the Three Lies, and maybe you even
rubbed the foot, poor thing. You've talked to the end
lessly cheerful folks in Byerly Hall. And chances are, if
you got in, you will end up coming here (last year,
about SO percent of admitted students did). To help
you make an informed choice, here's the real Harvard,
complete with terrible teaching fellows, intermittent
social life and weird naked rituals.
But there's also amazing housing, absorbing ex
tracurriculars and fascinating fellow students. Here
are the facts. You decide.
You might expect that academics will be the pinna
cle of your Harvard career. After all. it can't be the din
ing halls' savory baked tofu or the glorious architec
ture of Canaday Hall that win Harvard top honors in
the U.S. News &World Report survey every year.
The dirty little secret about Harvard is that you can
read Aristotle anywhere in the world for $8.99 and the
price of a bookmark.
You can even find someone to teach it to you who's
bright, funny and doesn't have to jet off to the State
Department every afternoon.
But that's not to say there aren't real advantages to
Harvard's academic life. You might not be able to
track down Af-Am guru Henry Louis "Skip" Gates Jr.

or former Reagan economic boss Martin S. Feldstein
in person, but you can sit in on their lectures.
How much personal contact you "11 have with pro
fessors depends on how hard you're willing to try,
though. Most professors, and a few students, claim that
office hours are a treat and doors are always open. But
most undergrads are too busy-or intimidated-to ever
bother.
Harvard is best known for its largest departments,
Economics and Government, popular with the Adidas
set (they don't call 'em gov jocks for nothing). These
departments are vast and impersonal but have bless
edly lax requirements. An alternate route is the make-

Mom-crvconcentration-Folklore and Mythology, any
one?
Of course, it's not as important what you study as
what you do. The lifeblood of Harvard is its extracur
ricular universe; with more than 250 independent stu
dent groups, everyone gets to be president.
However, even though 1 larvard has a $13 billion en
dowment salted away, most student groups are forced
to make do with pennies. Many students were out
raged when the administration announced plans earli
er this year to rebuild a historic ornamental tower on
Memorial Hall rather than a desperately needed stu
dent center.
Sports teams have little trouble getting money,
though. Surprisingly. Harvard even has a few good
teams. The women's hockey team won a national
championship this year, and men's tennis includes the
best player in the country.
But forget lectures — what you're probably won
dering. is the social life as terrible as you've heard?
Legend has it that Harvard is inhabited by a tribe of
pasty-faced "former" geeks for whom social life con
sists of reading Nietzsche into the wee hours and
checking e-mail obsessively. That isn't true, of course..
. or at least, it isn't entirely true.
If you're looking for students in their preferred ele
ment. try the banks of the Charles River, Harvard's
most beautiful vista on warm days. But this is not Stan
ford — Cambridge weather is spastic, and the occa
sional summery spats in the dreariest, snowiest months
are a cruel taunt.
One thing virtually every Harvard student has in
common is ambition. This is the Type A capital of the
world-students are driven in their academics, their ex
tracurriculars. even their socializing. ("We have to go
party now!")
But when you peel away the intensity, your fellow
Harvard men and women are surprisingly normal.

You're just as likely to bond with your peers this week
end over "Saved by the Bell" and Molly Ringwald as
philosophy or politics.
In a way, that's what your Harvard cafeer will be all
about — balancing Shakespearean sonnets and "Six
teen Candles." Don't forget — Harvard is still college.
You're here to have a good time, and you probably
will. But don't buy everything you hear in Byerly Hall.
Williams
Williams, a private college known for its dedicated
faculty, dynamic student groups, and unique pro
grams, has been one of the top three liberal arts col
leges in the nation for years.
Williams has about 2,()(H) students, with a portion of
juniors abroad every semester. If you're into mascots,
ours is the Eph. And no, there is no such thing as an
Eph — it's the shortened name of our founder. Colonel
Ephraim Williams. The physical representation of the
Eph is a purple cow.
At all colleges, including Williams, scholarly de
mands on professors are high. However, Williams
profs endeavor to maximize their teaching potential. It
is guaranteed that your prof will teach your class; TAs
never teach and graduate students (of which there are
few) only take classes. Profs are enthusiastic about
meeting with students — during office hours as well as
other times. It is common to see students and profs in
the Snack Bar or in Cold Springs Coffee Roasters, a
comfortable cafe on Spring Street.
Classes at Williams are small, although introducto
ry courses of the 101 genre can be somewhat large (as
in 80, not 200). Size usually decreases after you choose
your major. For an externally competitive school, cut
throat behavior between students is surprisingly ab
sent: personal goals are more the focus. There is a
sense that everyone's grades are stellar, but GPAs are
rarely discussed explicitly.
Involvement in sports is also widespread, and teams
are generally successful. Sporting events against
archrival Amherst are always packed, invariably in
cluding someone in a dorky cow outfit.
Still, it is the rare student that claims the "jock"
identity only. Don't be surprised to see a sculpture by
a top swimmer, or a track star in an a cappella group.
The newly-built Spencer Art Building is the home for
many a budding artist, and a cappella is hugely popu
lar: there are presently nine different groups. One of
Williams' special offerings is Independent Music Pro
ject. which allows student composers to create and per
form works for the community.
The mythological purple cow symbolically links
Williams to its rural surroundings: we are about as far
as we can be from Boston and still be in the same state,
and Vermont is 10 minutes away. This can be an asset
or a disadvantage, depending on what you like.
The isolated location means that most students stay
on campus during the weekends, which leads to a sense
of common identity in the so-called "Purple Bubble."
The remoteness also encourages students to have an
active role in campus activities, of which there are
more than 75.
The limited surroundings require you to get cre
ative with dates — if you have any. Williams' dating
scene is debatably lacking, though it may not be an un
common college phenomenon. Part of the problem is
that the town is asleep by 11 p.m.; only Subway and the
two bars stay open until 2 a.m. The party policy was re
vised recently; without invites secured by your house
president, getting in can be difficult.
Smaller parties are usually better, though you and
your buddies will fund them.
One program that helps alleviate the sense of isola
tion is Winter Study, a January term that provides a
change of pace between fall and spring semesters. Stu
dents choose one course from a broad array of offer
ings. including EMT Training. Auto Mechanics and
Journalism.
Students appreciate that housing at Williams is an
anomaly in the college world; there is no theme hous
ing or eating club system, and students voted fraterni
ties out of existence in the 19605. The majority of stu
dents live in comfortable and clean on-campus hous
ing: it is mostly seniors who live off-campus.
If you are the type of student who immediately wants
to specialize, requirements in the three divisions (Lan
guages and the Arts. Social Studies and Science and
Mathematics) may not be your bag. But for a student who
values exploring a variety of disciplines, appreciates the
arts and athletics, and would enjoy seeing familiar faces all
over campus, Williams could be a great fit.

Editor's note: Student newspaper writers at several of
the nation's top universities collaborated this week on a
series of articles to he printed at each participating
school's admit weekend. Three of those schools — Stan
ford, Harvard and Williams — are featured here. The
articles detail the ups and downs of life at the colleges
from a student perspective.
Stanford
The theme of Stanford is "opportunity." Stanford
students have the opportunities to take large lecture
classes or small seminars, live in dormitories or vege
tarian cooperative houses, conduct undergraduate
original research, act in a student-written and pro
duced musical comedy, or anything in between. That,
in one paragraph, is the essence of Stanford.
Stanford students live on a traditional college cam
pus. executed in sandstone with red-tile roofs. The
most important buildings of the University are inside
the Campus Drive loop; the majority of classes are
taught behind the arches of the main Quadrangle and
the newly constructed Science and Engineering Quad,
and most undergraduates live in the vast array of
dorms and houses that ring the heart of campus.
Living conditions vary from cookie-cutter dorm
rooms to unique rooms in converted mini-mansions.
Where you live depends on the luck of the "Draw," a
housing-assignment lottery that happens each spring.
Students spend most of their time on campus, where
the bicycle is the dominant form of transportation. In
sprawling suburban California, getting off campus vir
tually requires a car; public transportation is somewhat
limited. Although it is possible to get along without a
car, those without jokingly call the Stanford campus
"the Bubble."
But don't worry. In the opinion of the vast majority
of students, campus life at Stanford is simply amazing.
The opportunities you'll have to explore the lives of
those around you is incredible — be prepared to be
come deeply connected with students, staff and faculty
alike.
\ In dorms, dinners with faculty are regularly pro
grammed: dorm patriotism (complete with dorm bat
tle-cries and chants) is fostered: birthdays are celebrat
ed religiously. In the more independently minded
houses, happy hours and barbecues abound. For when
you need to bump and grind, a small but lively Greek
system throws all-campus parties nearly every week
end. And did we mention the weather?
The California sunshine contributes to the abun
dance of extra-curricular activities here. Intramural
sports, clubs and community service through the mul
titude of organizations and Greek chapters involve
most students.
And Stanford would not be the same without the
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band, a
decidedly non-traditional group of musicians with a
flair for satire.
As for our love lives, busy Stanford students rarely
go on dates in the traditional sense. People tend to
hang out in groups, which then sometimes spawns ro
mance.
For the bustle of the city, the cultural center of San
Francisco is an easy trip north by car, or an hour ride
on Caltrain. Organized dorm or house trips to
Yosemite or Lake Tahoe (excellent skiing!) happen
often as well. Day trips to Monterey, Santa Cruz and
other area attractions are common, but again, you'll
need a car or to know someone who has one. Palo Alto
offers little more than upscale cafes and restaurants to
take your date to before a semi-formal or swing party.
It's not a college town, but your mother will love it.
Living costs at Stanford are only surpassed by the
cost of living in surrounding Santa Clara County, the
most expensive place to live in the country. Yes, it costs
more than Manhattan. Thus, few students live off cam
pus: you need the salary of a computer industry CEO
to do so, literally. Shopping and eating is also expen
sive, a common complaint among students.
The 10-week academic quarter system at Stanford is
fast paced. But the vast majority of Stanford students
find ways to balance their extra-curricular activities
with their schoolwork. Unfortunately, one of the com
mon characteristics of Stanford students is that we're
overloaded and over-committed.
It's widely known that many of Stanford's depart
ments, especially those in "techie" science and engi
neering fields, are second to none. Computer science,
electrical engineering, and physics, among others, are
particularly famous, having produced computer indus
try luminaries such as Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo!, as

well as several Nobel Prizes.
Stanford's "fuzzy" social science and humanities
departments, especially history, political science, and
economics, are large, strong and well funded. Unfortu
nately, many complain that the performing and visual
arts are virtually ignored.
Student-initiated research is popular on campus.
Last year, the Undergraduate Research Opportunities
office gave out $650,(XX) in research grants to 486 stu
dents across all fields.
Finally, no one can discuss Stanford without men
tioning athletics. Stanford is strong in high-profile
sports such as basketball and a powerhouse in sports

such as tennis, swimming, and cross country. To get
their hands on coveted men's basketball season tickets
this year, students camped out two weeks in advance
outside Maples Pavilion. And we've got the Axe. the
trophy given to the winner of the annual football Big
Game with UC-Berkeley.
As Dick Vitale said when he body surfed the stu
dent section crowd this year at a basketball game. "It's
all about Stanford, baby!"

Classes at Williams are small, although introducto
ry courses of the 101 genre can be somewhat large (as
in 80, not 200). Size usually decreases after you choose
your major. For an externally competitive school, cut
throat behavior between students is surprisingly ab
sent: personal goals are more the focus. There is a
sense that everyone's grades are stellar, but GPAs are
rarely discussed explicitly.
Involvement in sports is also widespread, and teams
are generally successful. Sporting events against
archrival Amherst are always packed, invariably in
cluding someone in a dorky cow outfit.
Still, it is the rare student that claims the "jock"
identity only. Don't be surprised to see a sculpture by
a top swimmer, or a track star in an a cappella group.
The newly-built Spencer Art Building is the home for
many a budding artist, and a cappella is hugely popu
lar: there are presently nine different groups. One of
Williams' special offerings is Independent Music Pro
ject. which allows student composers to create and per
form works for the community.
The mythological purple cow symbolically links
Williams to its rural surroundings: we are about as far
as we can be from Boston and still be in the same state,
and Vermont is 10 minutes away. This can be an asset
or a disadvantage, depending on what you like.
The isolated location means that most students stay
on campus during the weekends, which leads to a sense
of common identity in the so-called "Purple Bubble."
The remoteness also encourages students to have an
active role in campus activities, of which there are
more than 75.
The limited surroundings require you to get cre
ative with dates — if you have any. Williams' dating
scene is debatably lacking, though it may not be an un
common college phenomenon. Part of the problem is
that the town is asleep by 11 p.m.; only Subway and the
two bars stay open until 2 a.m. The party policy was re
vised recently; without invites secured by your house
president, getting in can be difficult.
Smaller parties are usually better, though you and
your buddies will fund them.
One program that helps alleviate the sense of isola
tion is Winter Study, a January term that provides a
change of pace between fall and spring semesters. Stu
dents choose one course from a broad array of offer
ings. including EMT Training. Auto Mechanics and
Journalism.
Students appreciate that housing at Williams is an
anomaly in the college world; there is no theme hous
ing or eating club system, and students voted fraterni
ties out of existence in the 19605. The majority of stu
dents live in comfortable and clean on-campus hous
ing: it is mostly seniors who live off-campus.
If you are the type of student who immediately wants
to specialize, requirements in the three divisions (Lan
guages and the Arts. Social Studies and Science and
Mathematics) may not be your bag. But for a student who
values exploring a variety of disciplines, appreciates the
arts and athletics, and would enjoy seeing familiar faces all
over campus, Williams could be a great fit.
