## HO'S and PRO FRO'S Letter to the Editor What did you do to my son? 
### 
The following is a letter received by the
Admissions Office from an angry parent
after last year's Admit Weekend. The Daily
would like to thank Dean Kinnally and the
rest of the admissions staff for turning it
and other personal essays over to The Daily.
Dear Stanford,
My son Francis just returned from his
Admit Weekend at Stanford, and I am
enraged and shocked at some of the sto
ries he has to tell and some of the horri
ble incidents which he had to endure.
Stevie tells me that he was put in a
room with a senior boy named Ross
something-or-other, but they called him
the "Thing." I called this boy's room to
make sure that my Stevie was OK, but I
got a message that said in a low, Barry
White-esque voice, "Hey, Baby. You've
reached for the Thing. It ain't home right
now, but if you leave your domestic mea
surements orally, we'll send some love
sauce your way ... or you can call the
Thing back when you're hungry enough,
Gir1...."
Of course I left a message leaving my
name and number and other pertinent
information, and this Thing called me
back. His voice reminded me of a boy I
used to go with back in my college days,

and he seemed so wise when he said,
"Yeah, Honey ... MOAN. ..He was
right â€” I did feel better!
Martin usfcd to say the same thing back
in college. We'd be in the back of his
father's pick-up, my arms draped over the
gun-rack It would be cold outside but
warm inside so that the windows would
fog up, and the cows outside couldn't see
us. Then Martin would kiss me so ... and
then he'd tell me about his dreams ...
how he loved me... but saw himself mar
rying Thelma-Lou ... and they'd walk
down the aisle with her propping him up
after the great bachelor party he would
have had the night before ... and he'd
hold me tighter and I would melt into
him.... "Yeah, Honey... MOAN!"
I realized three months later that
Martin was just using me because I had
bucked teeth. I couldn't believe it!! Those
pigs can be so SHALLOW!
That's why my son will NOT be attend
ing Stanford next fall. Oh, and I'm very
angry and upset that your students got
my Stevie drunk and forced him to forni
cate with a Rodin statue at the sculpture
garden. I love Rodin, and I think that
what you have done is an absolute traves
ty!
Sincerely,
Ima Home
