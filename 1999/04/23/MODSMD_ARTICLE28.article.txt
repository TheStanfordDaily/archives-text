# New Celebrity Students to Teach
## 
### Bob Gates 
This year's freshperson class contains a host of former child stars as well as present day
celebrities. The Daily has broken into the Admissions Office, into the Secret Files of Dean
Kinnally, and found out just how and why these prospective students were admitted. It seems
that all have brokered some kind of deal which involves sharing their personal attributes with
other Stanford students in a classroom setting. Here is a list of some of the newly admitted
"celebrity" students and the classes which they have agreed to teach:
Hanson Psychology 176B: Psychology of the Transgendered
Johnathan Taylor Thomas Communication 48: Communicating in an Annoying Voice
Christina Ricci English 174B: Edgar Allan Poe and Gerhard Casper — The Not
So Friendly Ghosts
Claudia Salinger Psychology 130: Why It's OK That Everyone Wishes
(from TV's "Party of Five") I Really Were Lost in Space
Mikey Philosophy 42: How to Like "It"
Natalie Portman Linguistics 12: Pronunciation of "Committee" in Coruscant Dialect
Pamela Anderson Human Biology 1 OB: Hummm ... Sex?
