# Let us be your guides, kiddos!
## 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
Class of 2003, let us welcome you to the
Farm. Realizing that this may be your first
visit to Stanford, we have planned a weekend
that showcases all that the University has to
offer. You will be hosted by a Stanford student
who will provide floor space and cheap alco
hol for three nights.
But let Schmuck and Putz be your real
guides during this adventure. For your own
benefit, we have put together a little orienta
tion schedule just for you, drawing from the
knowledge we received when we were Pro
Fo's not too long ago.
FRIDAY
9:30 A.M. WELCOME TO STANFORD
Our beloved and radiant Provost (don't
worry, we don't exactly know what it means
either) Condoleezza Rice will embrace you
with open arms into the Stanford communi
ty
Formerly a Las Vegas showgirl, Condi still
has that piss and vinegar that will have you
howling for more. Don't forget to get a look
at those legs, baby.

Next, Dean of
Admissions Robert
Kinnally, the guy who
let you into this
school, will give an
encore performance
of the same speech he
gave at every event
last year. Don't worry,
like some cheese, all
wine and Raquel
Welch, it just keeps
getting better with
age.
The whole romp
will conclude with a
riveting performance
by the Stanford
Improvisers. Laugh
and be polite. They're
trying.

11 A.M. CAREER CONNECTIONS AND
ACADEMIC MAJORS
How do I choose the right major?
Kid, this is Stanford. Choose computer sci
ence or choose which restaurant to work at.
1 P.M. UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH
OPPORTUNITIES
Learn how you can get a $2,500 grant to do
absolutely nothing! Study gambling in Las

dance and booty shake in Hawaii. No joke.
2 P.M. THE PAPUA NEW GUINEA SCULP
TURE GARDEN TOUR
Take a three-hour tour through this gar
den of East African phalluses.
If you're lucky, you can catch lim the
woodsmith give a ritual circumcision. Bring
your hiking boots, you're in for an adventure.

5 P.M. COMPUTING AT STANFORD
Meet some of the fine folks at Sweet Hall,
our very own computer lair filled with the
freaks of the Farm. Some of them have not
left the building for their entire four years at
Stanford. Activities include: rubbing tanning
lotion on their pale skin and informing them
about the newest breakthroughs of hygiene in
the 20th century (deodorant, toothpaste ...
etc...).
6 P.M. WOMEN'S CENTER OPEN HOUSE
No, fellas, it's not what you think. We
made the same mistake too.

CANADIAN TAOIST COMMUNITY

Don't worry, you're so drunk that you

booty for you at Stanford!
2 A.M. RANDOM HOOK-UP
WITH SOME SHORT GIRL
NAMED BEATRICE
Or maybe it was Gertrude.
You're not quite sure.

on by next year. We're always looking for
