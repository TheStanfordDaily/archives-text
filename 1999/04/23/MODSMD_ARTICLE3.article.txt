# Officials crack down on MP3s
## Flo Mo pair threatened with lawsuits over Web-served computer music files 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
When two Florence Moore resi
dents were recently threatened with
lawsuits for uploading copyrighted
music files to their personal Web
pages, they experienced first-hand
the recording industry's redoubled
efforts to combat online piracy.
MP3s, music files popular with
college students for the ease with
which they can be downloaded from
the Web and played from hard dri
ves, have the recording industry run
ning scared as copyright infringe
ment reaches record levels on col
lege campuses.
The two students threatened with
lawsuits, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, explained that their
MP3 files were originally only avail
able to other Florence Moore resi
dents through the dormitory's inter
nal network. They soon realized that
they could not access their MP3 files
from other residences.
"I decided to put MP3s on my
Web site so that I could download
them from anywhere on campus."
one student said.
"Mv site basically was invisible to

search engines, because I couldn't
find it through Altavista or Yahoo!
Apparently the national recording
industry's agency found my site, hut
I don't know how," the student said.
In contrast, the other student had
made sure that all search engines
could find his site. "Stupid, hut any
way that's what 1 get. I meant to
make it public so that my own
friends could get it. By the end of the
first week, people had downloaded
10 songs: After three weeks, people
had downloaded roughly 1.500
MP3s." the student said. "Then I
started realizing that I don't have
that many friends."
Stephen Hansen, the University
computer security officer, explained
that with earlier copying technology
people "would have trouble gener
ating the numbers, $3,000 to $S,(XX)
in lost revenue, that would make
them eligible for prosecution."
"Now you're exporting it over the
net. It takes about five minutes on
the average for someone to down
load an entire CD. So then you can
imagine if you have [the CD| up for
even 24 hours how many copies

might be transferred," Hansen said.
"At an average cost of $16 it doesn't
take too long to hit the magic $3,000
number. That's why it's a big deal."
One of the students had actually
deleted all the MP3s on his Web site
before he was ever contacted by Uni
versity or recording industry offi
cials.
"On my Web page I have a track
er of who visits my site, their IP ad
dress, the time they visited, which
browser they used," the student said.
When the tracker listed a Stanford IP
address, he searched the online

whois directory to find out who had
visited his site.
"I found out that the guy who vis
ited was the University computer se
curity officer, Stephen Hansen. I im
mediately deleted every MP3 and
every word pertaining to MP3s off
my site within 30 minutes. 1 thought
that was the end of it for that day,"
the student said.
Both students were eventually
contacted by Hansen, who had re
ceived faxes from the recording in
dustry's copyright enforcement
agency listing which songs the stu
dents had pirated and their Stanford
Web addresses.
"He asked me if I was aware that
I had broken federal and state law,"

one student said. Hansen suggested
that the students "write [letters]
apologizing to the recording indus
try, saying that you knew what you
did, that you knew it was illegal and
saying that you won't do it again."
The recording industry's lawsuits
threatened the students with federal
prison time and thousands of dollars
in damages. The letters were appar
ently successful, and the recording
industry dropped the lawsuits.
Hansen was reluctant to speculate
about the actual likelihood of a
record company prosecuting a first
time small-scale offender like a col
lege student to the point of prison or
excessive monetary damages. How
ever, Hansen was careful to point out

that students are "taking the chance
that you would make a good exam
ple."
Contrary to popular perception, it
is also illegal to make MP3s accessi
ble through a dormitory's internal
network. Hansen had told the two
students threatened with lawsuits
that cleaning up such networks was a
"future project."
"At this point I figure every
body's been warned [by their RCCs].
People shouldn't wait around for me
to find out. I might not be the first
person to find it," Hansen said. "If
the record companies find it first,
you're gonna have to deal with their
lawyers. You're violating federal
law. It's a felony."
