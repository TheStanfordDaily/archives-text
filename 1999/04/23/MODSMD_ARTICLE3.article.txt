# Officials crack down on MP3s
## Flo Mo pair threatened with lawsuits over Web-served computer music files 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
When two Florence Moore resi
dents were recently threatened with
lawsuits for uploading copyrighted
music files to their personal Web
pages, they experienced first-hand
the recording industry's redoubled
efforts to combat online piracy.
MP3s, music files popular with
college students for the ease with
which they can be downloaded from
the Web and played from hard dri
ves, have the recording industry run
ning scared as copyright infringe
ment reaches record levels on col
lege campuses.
The two students threatened with
lawsuits, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, explained that their
MP3 files were originally only avail
able to other Florence Moore resi
dents through the dormitory's inter
nal network. They soon realized that
they could not access their MP3 files
from other residences.
"I decided to put MP3s on my
Web site so that I could download
them from anywhere on campus."
one student said.
"Mv site basically was invisible to

search engines, because I couldn't
find it through Altavista or Yahoo!
Apparently the national recording
industry's agency found my site, hut
I don't know how," the student said.
In contrast, the other student had
made sure that all search engines
could find his site. "Stupid, hut any
way that's what 1 get. I meant to
make it public so that my own
friends could get it. By the end of the
first week, people had downloaded
10 songs: After three weeks, people
had downloaded roughly 1.500
MP3s." the student said. "Then I
started realizing that I don't have
that many friends."
Stephen Hansen, the University
computer security officer, explained
that with earlier copying technology
people "would have trouble gener
ating the numbers, $3,000 to $S,(XX)
in lost revenue, that would make
them eligible for prosecution."
"Now you're exporting it over the
net. It takes about five minutes on
the average for someone to down
load an entire CD. So then you can
imagine if you have [the CD| up for
even 24 hours how many copies
