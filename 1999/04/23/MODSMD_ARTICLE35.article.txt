# One more time: Lacrosse drubs Santa Clara 18-3
## Women up against Gauchos Sunday in last game before playoffs 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
()n Wednesday, it wasdeja vu for
the Stanford women's lacrosse team.
With a repeat of its March 3 victory
over Sar\. Clara (5-8, 1-6 WWLL),
Stanford (15-4, 8-1 Western
Women's Lacrosse League) came
away victorious once again with the
same definitive score of 18-3.
Despite its clear domination in
the league all season, dropping only
one game to rival California early
on, the team isn't getting a swelled
head about its performance or tak
ing any team for granted.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ Wednesday: Stanford (15-4, 8-1
Western Women's Lacrosse League)
18. Santa C lara (5-8, I -6) 3.
■ Sunday: Stanford at IJC-Santa
Barbara, 2 p.m.

"Four key [Stanford) players
(were| battling the flu," said head
coach Heidi Connor. "Stanford
couldn't t;ikc this game lightly."
Despite such obstacles. Stanford
was able to control the game right
from the start and didn't once look

back, holding a comfortable 15-1
lead in the first half.
"The first half was dominated by
the Stanford fast break," Connor
said. "Goals were converted by
[sophomore] Katharine Barnes and
[freshman] Jenny Silverman to give
Stanford the substantial lead."
With the win already secured.
Stanford held up on the scoring and
instead used the second half as prac
tice for the upcoming tournament.
"Stanford looked to run their
plays and convert," Connor said,
"The team ran the plays in a text
book fashion."
Despite the lopsided score, the
women acknowledged the value of
Wednesday's win. Pleased that they
didn't lower their play to the level of
their opponents, the women made
the most of their time on the field.
" The team wasn't very strong,"
said freshman Liz Britt. "It was a
good way to practice our plays and to
keep our level of intensity up for all
60 minutes."
Silverman agreed. "It gave us an
other opportunity to come together
and hone all the skills we know," she
said.
Leading the offensive effort for
the Cardinal was Barnes with five

goals, followed by Silverman and
freshman Caroline Osterwise, who
eaeh had three goals. Senior co-cap
tain Carey Jones and freshman Sara
Lev both had two goals, while senior
co-captain Alexis Patrizio, Britt and
junior Gabby Duno each chipped in
one.
Defensively, goalkeeper Laurie
Amberg made three saves of six
shots.
Stanford's next challenge will be
Sunday when the team travels to
UC-Santa Barbara to square off
with the Gauchos at 2 p.m. Last sea
son, the Gauchos almost eliminated
the Cardinal from the WWLL Final
Four. The teams met in the semifi
nals and battled to a 8-8 tie at half
time. In the second half, however,
the Cardinal was able to pull togeth
er and come away with a 19-12 victo
ry and a place in the finals.
Stanford went on to win the
WWLL championship.
On Sunday, UC-Santa Barbara
will no doubt have that game on its
mind. But if Stanford works as a
team and puts together its new plays
and strategies as they have in the last
few games, the Cardinal should pre
vail.
"We're playing really well," Britt

said. "We don't need to learn any
thing else. We just need to keep a
constant level of play."
Connor is looking forward to the
game as a chance to compare Stan
ford's level of play with a team from
Southern California.
"This weekend's game against
UCSB is the perfect stepping stone
for the playoffs May 1," Connor
said.
The team has confidence that it
will be able to extend its eight-game
winning streak with a victory over
the Gauchos.
"I think we play really well as a
team. We have the composure to
know when to fast break and also
when to settle it down," Silverman
said. "We work well together and it's
all going to payoff."
The Cardinal is hoping to use the
adrenaline and confidence from a
win on Sunday to propel itself into
the Final Four with winning momen
tum. A repeat victory in the Final
Four would be the perfect cap to
Stanford's near flawless season and
a good indication of the team's fu
ture, as the Cardinal will only be los
ing three seniors next year.
The Final Four will be played
Mav 8-9 at Stanford.
