# U.S. gov't investigates fall speaker

He was the last Western diplomat to meet and warn
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosovic of the immi
nent NATO cruise missiles raid, but Richard Holbrooke

had no one to warn him of the ethical
investigation waiting for him in
Washington.
Holbrooke is under investigation
for whether he improperly accepted
thousands of dollars for making
speeches about the Balkans when he
was a special envoy to the region. The
first of these speeches was at Stanford
fall quarter in Kresge Auditorium.

This investigation may jeopardize Holbrooke's nomi
nation as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
In November, soon after his return from Yugoslavia,
Holbrooke was paid $16,(XX) for delivering a speech on
the ongoing Kosovo negotiations.
The question for State Department Inspector Gener
al Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers is whether Holbrooke's
acceptance of such speaking fees violates federal ethics
rules that bar government employees, including special
envoys, from accepting outside compensation "that re
lates to the employee's official duties."
