# U.S. gov't investigates fall speaker
## 
### Newton Kanhema Bruce Wang 
He was the last Western diplomat to meet and warn
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosovic of the immi
nent NATO cruise missiles raid, but Richard Holbrooke

had no one to warn him of the ethical
investigation waiting for him in
Washington.
Holbrooke is under investigation
for whether he improperly accepted
thousands of dollars for making
speeches about the Balkans when he
was a special envoy to the region. The
first of these speeches was at Stanford
fall quarter in Kresge Auditorium.

This investigation may jeopardize Holbrooke's nomi
nation as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
In November, soon after his return from Yugoslavia,
Holbrooke was paid $16,(XX) for delivering a speech on
the ongoing Kosovo negotiations.
The question for State Department Inspector Gener
al Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers is whether Holbrooke's
acceptance of such speaking fees violates federal ethics
rules that bar government employees, including special
envoys, from accepting outside compensation "that re
lates to the employee's official duties."
Stanford News Services writer James Robinson said


Holbrooke
the State Department contacted him
last week and asked for a transcript of
the Holbrooke speech at Stanford. A
transcript was not available, and in
stead the State Department had to
rely on an article published in The
Daily. Robinson also said that an
agent for Holbrooke requested the
same information later last week
from the ASSU.
Holbrooke's November speech
was sponsored by the ASSU Speak
er's Bureau. That speech was given a
month after I lolbrooke was officially
nominated by the State Department
as a special envoy for the Balkans.
For the speech, Holbrooke was
paid $20.(XX) plus fees for transporta
tion by the ASSU, according to
sophomore Michael Kass ol the
Speaker's Bureau. Of the $2(),(KK),
$4.(XX) went to the Greater Talent
Networks agency which represents
I lolbrooke, Kass said.
Aceording to recent disclosure
statements filed by Holbrooke with
the government Ethics Office, he re
ceived $205,(XX) in speaking fees last
year, in addition to his $1,153,0(X)
salary as an investment banker at
Credit Suisse First Boston in New
York. He also received $166,(XK) in
advances for his book "To End a

War," about his work at the State De
partment in 1995 to stop the war in
Bosnia.
According to Kass, Holbrooke
was invited to speak not as an gov
ernment employee. "At the time, we
viewed him as the vice president of an
investment banking firm," Kass said.
Holbrooke had been working in an
investment banking firm in New
York since 1996. Kass also added that
it was ASSIJ policy to not pay gov
ernment employees for speeches.
According to Kass, Holbrooke's
fee was not an exception. U.N. Ciood
will Ambassador Danny Glover will
be paid $20,(XX) for his talk next Mon
day, and Norman Mailer, the two
time Pulitzer prize winner, was paid
$14,(XX) for his speech.
The speakers whom the Speaker's
Bureau had contacted but could not
afford include Toni Morrison, who
asked for $40,(XX), and former Speak
er of the House Newt Gingrich, who
asked for $50,000.
The acceptance of his speaking
fees has raised questions with faculty
members and the ASSU who claim
not to pay any honorarium to govern
ment and IJ.N. officials.
Senior research scholar at the
Center for International Security and
Cooperation Stephen Stedman said
if Holbrooke's talk involved details of
the negotiation he was involved in
then, he exercised poor ethical judge

ment in receiving the payment.
The issue at question is whether
the acceptance of the speaking fees
violates federal ethics rules that bar
government employees, including
special envoys, from accepting out
side compensation "that relates to the
employee's official duties."
A violation of the rules can result
in administrative penalties such as
reprimands and dismissals. Currently
it is unclear how those penalties
would apply to Holbrooke as an un
paid part-time government represen
tative.
According to The New York
Times, Holbrooke also gave at least
two other paid speeches after his ap
pointment as a special envoy, to the
Siemens electronics company for
$24,(KH) in October and to Pepsico for
$2(),(XK) in December. The topics of
the speeches at the last two venues
could not be determined.
Holbrooke told The Times
through a spokeswoman that he had
no comment.
According to government offi
cials, the latest inquiry was prompted
by the publication in March of an op
ed article in the Washington Post by
Philip L. Christenson, a former con
gressional official. Christenson ques
tioned whether it was right for Hol
brooke and other part-time envoys to
receive money for speeches related to
their government work.

A spokesperson for the Inspector
General's office, Linda Topping,
would not confirm that a new investi
gation was under way or offer any
other comment.
But a congressional official said
Williams-Bridgers notified the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee on
Monday that she had opened a new
inquiry and that she hoped to com
plete it quickly.
Marc Thiessen, a spokesman for
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman
of the Foreign Relations Committee,
said, "The committee would be shirk
ing its committee responsibility if we
allowed this nomination to go for
ward before all the ethics questions
have been answered."
Holbrooke played a key role in
the Dayton Peace Agreement, which
resolved the Bosnian conflict before
his U.N. nomination.
Holbrooke's nomination original
ly could not be confirmed by the Sen
ate because of an impending State
Department inspector general's in
vestigation on allegations that he had
illegally lobbied his former govern
ment colleagues soon after his resig
nation from the Department.
That inquiry ended in February,
when Holbrooke agreed to pay
$S,(J(K) to settle civil charges that he
had violated the department's rules.
Holbrooke served as the U.S. am
bassador to Germanv until 1995.
He was the last Western diplomat to meet and warn
