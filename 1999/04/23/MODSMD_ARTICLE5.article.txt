# Russian grandmaster says chess as challenging as more physical sports
## Brain, brawn at Kasparov speech 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
The physical and psychological pressures a
chess player faces are at least as difficult as those
faced by athletes in professional sports, grand
master Garry Kasparov told a standing-room
onlv crowd in the SEQ teaching center last night.
Kasparov's speech was followed by a discus
sion with six Stanford panelists, including senior
Adrian Keatinge-Clay, a national chess master,
French and Italian Prof. Hans Grumbecht and
football coach Tyrone Willingham. The panel dis
cussion opened the symposium on the "Limits of
Performance," sponsored by the Presidential Lec
tures in the Humanities series.
Kasparov compared the chess player to a
"physical athlete" in mental fortitude and physical
stamina.

"The physical and psychological stresses [faced
by chess players] pushes chess to the forefront of
professional sports," he said.
Kasparov said he exercises at the gym two
hours a day in addition to chess training sessions.
"My recent success against much younger
ptayers partly depends on my superior physical
condition," he said.
According to Kasparov, chess can be a long
and cruel game determined by time constraints
and sometimes one crucial move.
"If you lose psychologically, then you will lose
on the board and on the field," he said.
Kasparov spoke about his career, highlighting
his wins over Anatoly Karpov in 1985 and 1987
before remarking on his 1997 loss to Deep Blue.
The computer Kasparov played against was an
IBM SPQ server with chips capable of analyzing
2(H) to 3(H) million positions per second. Ka/parov

said.
"I could isolate myself from the image of my
opponent, but in my subconscious, I knew my
[human] opponent would crash under pressure,"
Kasparov said. "I reaped that this opponent
would not [psychologically] crashtiV i •>»
"Uncertainty made me incapable of finishing
game six. I collapsed," he said.
Kasparov criticized IBM for refusing to release
the printouts detailing Deep Blue's analytic
processes.
"The main point is that IBM had a moral duty
to give information from the printout to the chess
world," he said. "Any scientific discovery should
be supported by evidence."
The match with Deep Blue was not truly legal,
Kasparov argued. He said the computer crashed
several times during the match and
did not play entirely without human
intervention.
He cited Deep Blue's several
malfunctions, which required the as

sistance of computer engineers.
Though Kasparov admitted to
feeling like a dinosaur at competi
tions, he said he will stay on the com
petition circuit.
"In chess, I'm a god, hut in other
things, I'm another human being,"
Kasparov said. "I think I have four
or five more years, good years."
