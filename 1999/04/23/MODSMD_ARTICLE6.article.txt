# Weekend role reversal
## Stanford now applies for the hearts of its successful applicants 
### Laura Blythe 
The trees lining Campus Drive
are in full bloom, construction on
campus has come to a temporary
halt and dinner in the dorm has
never tasted so great. The sun has
been out all week and doesn't look
like it's going anywhere. It's Stan
ford Admit Weekend 19W.
Dean of Admissions Robert Kin
nally oversaw the selection of the
members of the Class of 2(X)2, and
said he is excited about the upcom
ing weekend, which will bring 1,250
prospective freshmen, also known as
"pro fros" to campus. This figure is
just under half of the admitted class.
"We spend four months reading
applications, so it's good to finally
meet the students we've been read
ing about, to put a face with a name
and to finally get to talk with them,"
Kinnally said.
On the process of selecting the

admits, Kinnally noted, "It's the
most difficult thing in the world. We
select 2.6(X) students from an appli
cation pool of 18,(XK) talented, tal
ented young people. The students
we don't admit probably would do
fine here, and we have to pick the
ones we think will make the biggest

impact on the Stanford community
and will get the most out of being at
Stanford."

"I'm really looking forward to it,"
she said. "I think it helps being a
freshman because my senior year is
still fresh in mind, and I will be able to
relate to my pro fro a lot better.
Alondra is a really tight-knit, fun
community to be in — a fun experi
ence for the pro fros."
Lindsay Arnold, Alondra's house
host, said she had a lot of fun when
she was a prospective freshman dur
ing Stanford Admit Weekend. Lind
say said she has loved being a house

host and that it takes more organiz
ing than one would think.
"It is a great opportunity to stay in
touch with incoming freshmen, to be
enthusiastic with this year's frosh and
to promote everything that I love
about Stanford." Arnold said.
The weekend's events begin this
morning with a welcome by Provost
Condoleezza Rice and Kinnally and
with performances by Stanford
Taiko drums and SIMPs, Stanford's
improvisational acting troupe. The
prospective freshmen will also have
the chance to sit in on classes, attend
an a cappella concert and come to
gether for a dance Saturday night.
