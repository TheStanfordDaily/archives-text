# Weekend role reversal
## Stanford now applies for the hearts of its successful applicants 
### Laura Blythe 
The trees lining Campus Drive
are in full bloom, construction on
campus has come to a temporary
halt and dinner in the dorm has
never tasted so great. The sun has
been out all week and doesn't look
like it's going anywhere. It's Stan
ford Admit Weekend 19W.
Dean of Admissions Robert Kin
nally oversaw the selection of the
members of the Class of 2(X)2, and
said he is excited about the upcom
ing weekend, which will bring 1,250
prospective freshmen, also known as
"pro fros" to campus. This figure is
just under half of the admitted class.
"We spend four months reading
applications, so it's good to finally
meet the students we've been read
ing about, to put a face with a name
and to finally get to talk with them,"
Kinnally said.
On the process of selecting the

admits, Kinnally noted, "It's the
most difficult thing in the world. We
select 2.6(X) students from an appli
cation pool of 18,(XK) talented, tal
ented young people. The students
we don't admit probably would do
fine here, and we have to pick the
ones we think will make the biggest

impact on the Stanford community
and will get the most out of being at
Stanford."
