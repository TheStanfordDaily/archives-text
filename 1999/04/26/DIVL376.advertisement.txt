With a little attention,
you can vastly im
prove your pleasure in eating
(whether you cook for yourself
or not), and your mood and
energy level as well. Here's how:
Be Adventurous
■ Try new ethnic foods
■ Taste something you've never
had before (jicama, Boston
baked beans, tangerine juice,
feta cheese)
■ Create new combinations of
foods (e.g., spread peanut
butter on fruit)
■ Experiment with herbs and
spices (sweet: cinnamon, nut
meg, vanilla; savory: tarragon,
basil, cilantro; hot: chili pep
pers, cumin, curry)
■ Try a different setting (see
"Food" in the Stanford Direc
tory for a listing of on-cam
pus eateries)
And when you eat with others,
notice and enjoy their company.
Vou can both nourish your soul
and feed your body at mealtime.
Play With Ybur Food
■ Fill your plate with colorful
foods
■ Arrange food artfully on
your plate
■ Notice the textures of a meal
■ Take your time to taste and
enjoy what is in your mouth
For Energy and Mood
Eating right - along with physical
exercise, adequate rest and
relaxation, and a positive mental

attitude - can make the differ
ence between just getting by and
feeling great. What you eat can
have a dramatic effect on your
mood, energy and alertness. To
improve your energy and mood:
■ Eat light, low fat meals
■ For .a continuous source of
fuel, eat small meals through
out the day
■ Breakfast and lunch should
include both protein and
carbohydrate (e.g., yogurt,
muffin, banana; egg, toast,
orange; tortilla, ricotta
cheese, and a smoothie)
■ Have complex carbohydrates
(starch) in every meal -
especially whole grains and
fibrous fruit - and vegetables
at every meal
■ Drink at least eight glasses
water a day (really, eight!)
■ Eat foods rich in B vitamins
and iron (e.g., greens, grains),
or take a multivitamin daily
■ Be aware of your sugar,
caffeine and alcohol intake
(after the initial rush, they
can make you feel sluggish
and cranky)
■ During stressful times,
eat foods high in anti
oxidants (fruits and vege
tables), and vitamin B (grains,
fortified cereals)
For better sleep, try a good
snack such as tryptophan-rich
warm milk; or toast and jam (a
combination of a simple and a
complex carbohydrate); or a
baked potato; avoid spicy and
high fat foods
For pre-menstrual depression
and anxiety, try a high carbo
hydrate, low sugar, low
protein diet
For Snacks
For good energy-packed snacks,
try:
■ Whole grain crackers
■ Fresh fruit and vegetables
■ Nuts and dried fruit
■ Instant oatmeal
■ Peanut butter and jelly or
honey
■ Potatoes and yams (micro
wave 5 to 10 minutes)
