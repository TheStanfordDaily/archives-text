"My young husband came home from the war in Vietnam in a
flag-draped casket. For those soldiers who made't home alive,
many were greeted by America's rage. I had to ask, what did Jeff
die for? This question haunted my days and nights. 1 knew I had tc
transform his death into as powerful a statement against war as 1
could."
