AFRICAN MOVIE NIGHT
featuring Ousmane Sembene's Guelwaar (1993,115 min.)
"Guelwaar is a black comedy, political allegory and social satire guaranteed to be unfor
gettable. Pierre Henri Thioune (a.k.a. Guelwaar) is a political activist and a pillar of the
Catholic community who dies mysteriously. Finding an empty casket in the mortuary,
Guelwaar's family sets out to recover his body, which has been mistakenly buried in a

of African intellectuals and corruption-find stylish expression in this film." - Smithsonian
