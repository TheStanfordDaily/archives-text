Stanford-bound commuters looking to avoid the traffic on High
way 101 and students heading to San Francisco for the day have a
new resource: the Palo Alto Bikestation.
Located in the historic depot at the Palo Alto Caltrain station,
the Bikestation provides bicycle rentals and free guarded storage for
150 bicycles among other services for Caltrain- and bus-riding
tourists and commuters.
The Bikestation opened Friday amid fanfare from the Bay Area
