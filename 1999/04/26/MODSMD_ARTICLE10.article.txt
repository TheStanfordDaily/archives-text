## 'Mafia' members are guilty by association 
### 
LITTLETON. Colo. (AP) —
Police are interviewing them.
Reporters are stalking them.
No wonder that members of the
Trenchcoat Mafia, among the clos
est friends of the Columbine High
gunmen, are feeling even more
ostracized than they did before last
Tuesday's shooting.
Before the shooting, the group
of about a dozen boys and girls
were known around school as out
casts who favored long, black
trench coats and adopted the trap
pings of "Gothic" subculture.

Two girls who belonged to the
Trenchcoat Mafia asked mourners
at a memorial service not to blame
them for the actions of Dylan Kle
bold and Eric Harris.
" There was no sign they would
do this," sobbed Nicole Makham.
But another member of the
group told The Denver Post that he
understood why the teens snapped:
One of the reasons the Trenchcoat
Mafia existed, he said, was to give
its members a sense of belonging in
the face of teasing and bullying by
other students, especially athletes.
