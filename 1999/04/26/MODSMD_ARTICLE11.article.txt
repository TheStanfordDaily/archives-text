WASHINGTON (AP) â€” In a summit-end
ing show of solidarity, NATO leaders promised
military protection and economic aid to seven
countries bordering Yugoslavia for defying Slo
bodan Milosevic and helping the West try to end
the violence in Kosovo. "We must and we shall
succeed," Secretary-General Javier Solana
declared.
Concluding three days of talks yesterday.
President Clinton and fellow NATO leaders sat
down with officials from the "frontline states" to
hear firsthand reports. "The nations of the region
have risked, and even faced, armed confronta
tion with Serbia by facilitating and supporting
our campaign to end the bloodshed in Kosovo,"
Clinton said.
Albania and Macedonia have been particular
ly hard hit bv the crisis, taking in nearly S(K),(KK)

Kosovar Albanian refugees fleeing from
Yugoslav military action. The other neighboring
countries are Bosnia. Bulgaria, Croatia, Roma
nia and Slovenia.
In their summit finale, the 19 NATO allies
met with leaders of two dozen other Central and
Eastern European countries that have banded in
partnership with the alliance. Russia boycotted in
protest of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
Anxious about inflaming tensions with
Moscow further, the allies said they were trying
to avoid a confrontation at sea over blockading
oil supplies to Serbia. The summit authorized
NATO military commanders to draw up plans to
inspect ships suspected of carrying oil to Milose
vic. Russia and Libya are Yugoslavia's main oil
suppliers.
Foreign ministers of the European Union will

gather today in Luxembourg to ratify their oil
embargo against Yugoslavia. Alastair Campbell,
spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, played down the risk of confrontation if a
Russian tanker refuses to abide by the embargo.
" The Russians have been helpful in this conflict
and we are confident they will continue to be
helpful," he said.
Meeting here to commemorate NATO's 50th
anniversary, summit leaders sent a message of
unity and resolve demanding that Milosevic back
down. Over and over, Clinton and other Western
leaders pledged that NATO would prevail,
putting the alliance's prestige at stake.
The summit concluded on day 33 of NATO
airstrikes. The allies attacked south of the
Yugoslav capital, bombing a communication
tower at Mt. Avala. 10 miles south of Belgrade.
