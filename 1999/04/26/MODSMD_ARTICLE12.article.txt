Admit Weekend events
show students and pro fros
must drink responsibly

The hospitalization
during the weekend of a
prospective freshman resulting
from excessive alcohol consumption
serves as a reminder that what may
seem like harmless entertainment can
often spiral out of control.
Some prospective freshmen may
see Admit Weekend on a college
campus as an opportunity to party as
hard as they can, and their hosts are
often eager to show them a good time.
Unfortunately, good intentions may
often be accompanied by unintention
al carelessness.
It is unreasonable to expect that
prospective freshmen will not have
access to or consume alcohol during
Admit Weekend.
The weekend is a chance for stu
dents to experience Stanford life and,
whether parents and administrators
like it or not, alcohol is a part of
undergraduate life for many students
at Stanford and other colleges around
the nation.
If visiting prospective freshmen
must make a decision regarding their
personal consumption of alcohol, this
is no different from the decisions they
will soon have to make as first-year
college students.
Indeed, some high school seniors
may use a college's social atmosphere,
including alcohol consumption, as a
factor in deciding which college to

attend.
At the same time, however, hosts
of prospective freshmen should be
aware that Admit Weekend may he
one of their guests' first encounters
with alcohol. The visiting high school
seniors may he overzealous or unfa
miliar with their limits.
Since hosts often do not know their
guests well, it may be hard to judge
whether a prospective freshman is as
experienced or responsible a drinker
as he may seem to be, and giving him
the opportunity for serious alcohol
abuse creates a dangerous situation.
Even though serious cases of alco
hol abuse involving hospitalization
are rare, it is common for prospective
freshmen to prove troublesome for
their hosts â€” they may get sick, make
messes or otherwise behave disrup
tively or destructively while under the
influence of alcohol. Many hosts may
not realize how easily such things can
occur with inexperienced drinkers,
and they may take little caution to
avoid this.
Ultimately, of course, it is the
responsibility of the person drinking
to take care of himself and avoid trou
ble. However, hosts must also realize
that prospective freshmen may not
always take on this responsibility, and
it is in the hosts' best interests to take
extra care in watching out for their
prospective freshmen.
High school seniors who are trying
to figure out what Stanford's social
scene is like should be left with the
impression that alcohol is not always a
component of fun, but when it is, it is
used responsibly.
