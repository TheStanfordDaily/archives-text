I WANT TO call atten
tion to an issue that
has occupied con
cerned residents of the
Row for the last few
months. There has been
debate recently regarding
University development
proposals for a visible and

threatened resource — open space.
I will admit to being afflicted with the Not
In My Backyard syndrome. Growing up in
middle America where there is little real
shortage of open land, hvper-developed sub
urbia has been a terrifying environment — I
can't fathom this sort of population density.
Stanford is lucky enough to have thousands
of acres at its disposal, much to the pleasure
of those who enjoy the foothills. But honest
ly. I've never been to the Dish. Why argue
for open space if I admit not taking advan
tage of it in its most visible manifestation?
Because I am writing this column while
sitting in the middle of the Mayfield Play
field, listening to pretty little birds twitter in
the sunshine and trying to ignore the strange
yelps of two 10-year-olds who have decided
to be insect gladiators not 50 feet away.
Because I have housemates and friends who
use the basketball court between the old
Taxi house and Roth to blow off steam all
the time. Because I used to go jogging in
Frenchman's Triangle and enjoyed the fact
that there was a little bit of room to breathe
between the houses there. I'm jumping on
the Save Open Space bandwagon, because 1

never realized until a few weeks ago that I
had anything to lose.
There are important elements involved in
the debate over developing our open spaces
to provide more affordable faculty housing.
Part of the problem with living in a place
with such wonderfully temperate weather,
safe neighborhoods and a posh downtown is
that everyone else wants to live here, too. As
students, we are just tenants. But we do
experience directly and acutely any slight
changes that are made to the built environ
ment which we inhabit — and not just in hav
ing our daily routines accompanied by the
sweet sounds of bulldozers and backhoes
moving about at ungodly hours. These are
our homes, so the Mayfield Playfield is our
community lawn. I include those residents
whose homes border the Playfield. It is not
often crowded but is a place to drop your
stuff and lay your stressed body down in the
grass and daisies. Kids fly kites there.
How sweet, you say. I'll grant that student
wiggle-room may not be as important as pro
viding housing for the junior faculty that we
desperately need to attract. The real issue is
how we as a community and as a culture
address green space. It concerns me that we
look at places like the Mayfield Playfield as
emptiness to be filled by efficient develop
ment. I would caution the University com
munity to consider whether space-saving
efficient housing plunked down amidst stu
dent residences is quite the best way to go in
solving the Peninsula-wide housing crunch.
Homeowners want a lawn or a backyard and

do not want to be able to see into their neigh
bors' homes constantly. Students, at least in
the freestanding small-community houses,
want the same things.
And furthermore, why not build on
Wilbur Field? Because faculty wouldn't want
to live so close to students, situated between
the Pink Palaces of Stern and Wilbur Hall?
The Row is no different, and who's to say
that students want to live closer to faculty?
Consider the benefits of maintaining some,
as a friendly faculty member put it, cordon
sanitaire between us. Houses have parties,
weekend barbecues and full-contact ultimate
Frisbee matches. We get loud.
It's a tough call, and many interests are at
play in determining the fate of the Playfield,
Frenchman's Triangle and the lot between
717 Dolores and Roth. Development is all
right when managed carefully. Questions of
ownership and stewardship inevitably plague
decisions about our free space. How logical is
the suburban allotment of a quarter-acre for
a single-family home? Considering the long
term ramifications further constraining open
space involves a consideration of students as
permanent residents.
We do not have the capital interests of
homeowners or the ecological clout of the
tiger salamander, but a little room to live, not
just to play, is good for us, too.

Mari Webel, a junior majoring in history,
would like to apologize in advance to potential
developers .she nuiy have offended.
