Political stance can be valuable
I am writing in response to Frank
Ciuinan's letter in Friday's Daily. The
notion that a newspaper should not take a
political stance is naive and too commonly
held in our democracy. Simply by choosing
what news to report from day to day, a
newspaper takes a political stance. By the
terms it uses to describe the players in a
political spectacle and by the quotes it
chooses to print, it takes a political stance.
This is inevitable.
The goal of a "real" newspaper is to rep
resent its perspective with stylistic skill and
moral integrity, as do The New York Times,
The Wall Street Journal and The Christian
Science Monitor. What the reader seeks is
not unbiased reporting from one source but
a comparable balance of perspectives from
several able sources. It is the reader's
responsibility to keep in mind the angles
taken by the various newspapers he or she
reads. Many European newspapers, for
example, even eliminate all doubt by open
ly declaring their stances. This is a boon to
democracy, not a threat to it.
It is conceivably more dangerous to trust
your one favorite newspaper to attempt to
be "unbiased" than to read several newspa
pers with openly declared philosophical or
political motivations. The thought of thou
sands of people basing their opinions and
voting decisions exclusively on the "unbi
ased" reporting of a transparently left-wing,
not to mention increasingly sensationalist
and only borderline competent, local rag
like the San Francisco Chronicle keeps me

awake at night.
In a court trial, the idea is not for the jury
to listen to two unbiased lawyers. It is for
the jury to hear with equal time two lawyers
who fervently advocate their opposing per
spectives and use every legal (and ideally
moral) means at their disposal. 1 would
sooner trust a journalist who was formerly
an executive at Marlboro and is now proud
ly the head of the Vegan Communist Party
than one who claims to be "unbiased."

Kasparov lecture overcrowded
I would like to thank the organizers of
the Stanford Presidential Lectures and
Symposia in the Humanities and Arts for
their effort to arrange for distinguished
speakers such as Garry Kasparov, the world
chess champion, to address the Stanford
community.
I prize the opportunity to learn from
such speakers, because their stimulating
ideas enrich my education.
Unfortunately, I was unable to attend
Kasparov's presentation last Thursday night
because the venue, the Science and Engi
neering Quad's Teaching Center, Room
2(X), was overcrowded. Hundreds of people
crammed into the room. Dozens had to sit
in stairwells or stand in aisles, making it dif
ficult to see Kasparov and creating a fire
hazard. I felt claustrophobic and oppressed
by the crush.
No video broadcast of the speech was

offered in another room. Scores of people
were turned away from the event, because
they couldn't see Kasparov or find a seat.
Many people left early in frustration.
Similar popular events held in the SEO
Teaching Center, such as the November lec
ture by scientist Stephen Jay Gould, were
also overcrowded.
Please continue to arrange for dynamic
speakers such as Garry Kasparov and
Stephen Jay Gould to engage the Stanford
community. Hut next time, please find a
bigger room.

Turkish student response
Knowledge of historical events from an
unbiased perspective is useful in establish
ing Turkish-Armenian friendship in the
world as we are about to enter the 21st cen
tury. We would like to present our under
standing of these events so that the public
has the opportunity to hear both sides.
Do you know that not only Prof. Heath
Lowry from Princeton but also Prof. Stan
ford Shaw from UCLA, Prof. Michael
Meeker from UC-San Diego, Prof. Kath
leen Burrill from Columbia and 48 more
American academics who specialize in
Turkish, Ottoman and Middle Eastern
Studies have denied the recognition of
Armenian claims that 1.5 million people of
Armenian ancestry were victims of geno
cide perpetrated in Turkey between 1915
and 1923 and that several attempts to credit

such Armenian claims have failed in both
chambers of the U.S. Congress?
Unfortunately, in the name of propagan
da, Turks, Turkey and the Ottoman Empire
have been the targets of many attacks due
to ethnic and religious biases as well as
insufficient knowledge of historical events.
These Moslems have been portrayed as bar
baric, violent and backward peoples by
those with various purposes like the "East
ern Question," which involved the destruc
tion of the empire and the partitioning of its
lands by the imperialist powers.
To date, there is no evidence that the
Ottoman State had a policy of extermina
tion of the Armenians. Ottoman statesmen
who were imprisoned for alleged crimes
against Armenians were all released due to
lack of evidence. Faked telegrams attribut
ed to the Young Turk government have
since been thoroughly exposed as forgeries.
Even the British did not use these in their
persecution of Ottomans. Neither were they
admitted as evidence in the trial in Ger
many related to the assassination of Talat
Pasha, the Ottoman Interior Minister.
We, the members of Turkish Students
Association of Stanford University, do
mourn for both Armenian and Turkish peo
ple perished during World War I.
We, however, do not accept the distor
tions of historical facts to promote one
sided Armenian allegations. Please search
for the truth and consider both sides of this
controversial historical issue.
