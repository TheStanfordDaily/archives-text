# Where we are
## Those who are really to blame for Colorado

BEFORE THE BLOOD had been
cleaned away, before all the bombs
had been diffused, before the victims'
families had the chance to make sense of last
week's massacre in Littleton. Colo., the
media took it upon itself to provide the
answers everyone was seeking and no one
could find.
The television stations and newspapers
delved into their files on school shootings
and unearthed the usual suspects. The preva
lence of violence in film, video games and on
the Internet. The availability of weapons to
minors. The popularity of subversive cultures
like neo-Nazism and Gothic rock.
These subjects made for quick, easy sto
ries. A quote from a Hollywood producer, a
sound bite from a politician vehement about
gun control, a feature on the dark side of the
MTV generation — put them all together,
and you get a snapshot of the out-of-control
American culture that produced two teen
age mass murderers. How a society shapes a
killer, coming up on the 11 o'clock news.
Why two boys felt it necessary to gun
down their classmates and try to blow up
their high school is a question that will, with

their deaths, remain unanswerable. And yet
the media — that clamoring, sweaty behe
moth— came up with a slew of packaged
answers in a matter of minutes. Such a ten
dency to fill the inevitable voids left in the
wake of tragedy is only natural, and yet the
responses the media continues to give seem
wholly misguided. By framing this horror
within the confines of such unwieldy con
cepts as media violence and gun control, the
nation's news services not only stray from the
real, dark, personal causes behind kids who
kill but also unintentionally create an atmo
sphere in which human life and individual
responsibility are gradually devalued.
Of course, beginning a national dialogue
on our country's fascination with violence
can do no harm. One does not need a class in
cognitive psychology (although it could help)
to know that children learn by observing and
that when their models are body-severing
movie stars and gun-toting fathers, violence
will, in some cases, erupt. Fifty years ago,
angry children might have settled their dis
putes with switchblades, not with carbine
rilles or pipe bombs assembled from instruc
tions found on the Internet. There is no

doubt that the increased level of violence in
everyday life has made some contributions to
the intensity and frequency of adolescent
savagery.
However, no one knows what role the
media or lax weapons laws play in the indi
vidual case. In a probing article in yesterday's
New York Times, the reporter wrote that
"what propels young perpetrators like those
in Littleton ... remains largely a mystery."
She went on to quote Donald Cohen, direc
tor of Yale's Child Studies Center, who
argues that the popularity of violent movies
and figures like Marilyn Manson is not evi
dence by itself that something is wrong.
Indeed, to assert the media's own role in
perpetuating violence, reporters would have
to take into account the millions who are not
affected by the same brutal images. No one
mentions the 364 days of the year when no
high school is bombarded with bullets. And
similarly, wouldn't reporters have to
attribute teen-agers' positive qualities to
media images as well? Why not argue that
Lauren Townsend, an 18-year-old victim of
last week's shootings who was also captain of
her volleyball team and potential class vale

dictorian, was the product of "Good Will
Hunting" and the emergence of the WNBA?
Quite simply, such enormous subjects as
media violence and gun laws are used to
explain teen violence, because the real issues
are either too complex or too unsettling to
talk about. Bill Maher, the host of "Political
ly Incorrect," is not exactly going to lead a
panel on the breakdown of the killers' inter
personal relationships, the chemical imbal
ances they might have had or the need for
supportive parenting in their lives. These
topics require patience and understanding,
two areas the media sorely lacks. Why these
two boys, in particular, committed those
atrocious acts had to do with the individual
troubles and individual deficiencies which
sprung from their families, friends and spe
cific psychologies. Violence in society is
merely a scapegoat, a way out of discussing
the consequences of personal sorrow, mis
takes and madness.
The experts, like Cohen, know this. But
the experts don't own the TV studios and the
newspapers. And when they are the ones try
ing to "explain" the causes of this tragedy,
their clumsy and misinformed answers not

only prevent us from moving forward hut in
fact send us reeling back.
By attributing the reasons underlying one
massacre in one high school in one small
town to pervasive, impersonal matters, the
individual's responsibility in this situation is
diminished, if not forgotten. If the murderers
were merely products of the media and
backwards legislation — forces both beyond
their control and unchangeable in the con
ceivable future — then their individual agen
cy wouldn't seem to count for much. And it
is exactly this type of impersonal, unalterable
climate that allows teen-age angst and
destruction to foment.
All the answers provided by the media
seem to lead to one question: What could
anyone have done? II we were only looking
in the right places, the answer to that should
have been, alas, "So much."

David Stein, a coterminal student in English,
would have preferred to place the photographs
of the /.? victims here in lieu of his column.
Words are often very inadequate, especially
now.
