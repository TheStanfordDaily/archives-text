"Africans need to change their
attitude. We have internalized the
worst elements of our oppressors.
We are obsessed with power, sex,
good life, alcohol and drugs. We
need to change that. We need to
change the way we do things," said a
visiting militant African scholar,
Arthur Mutambara.
Mutambara will be the keynote
speaker of Africa Week, organized
by the Stanford African Students
Association. He will speak on " The
State of the African Continent: An
Imperative Agenda" in the Tresid
der Oak Lounge at 7 p.m. today.
Mutambara is an example of the
new face of Africa. Traditionally,
African and African-American
leaders have been eager to elo
quently articulate the ways in which
Western civilization plunged Africa
into its current state of crisis. How
ever, a new wave of thinking is
emerging that Africans, too, should
assume responsibility for their mis
takes with the intention of taking
control of their own conditions.
"He has done an awesome job of
combining academic excellence and
social responsibility," SASA Presi
dent Acha Leke said.
"Africa Week is an opportunity
for SASA to expose Stanford and
its surrounding community to the
rich African cultural heritage,"
Leke said.
Other Africa Week events in
clude a "cultural extravaganza" on
Thursday night at Kicker Dining
Center and "Africa Night" on Sat
urday. featuring a dinner, guest
speaker and dance party at Man
zanita Dining Commons.
Mutambara exemplifies a new
way of thinking by the young
African intellectuals, who implore
all Africans to see their salvation in
themselves.
While the older Africans are
quick to cry foul and blame colo
nialism and racism, the up-and
coming Africans are demanding a

critical look at corruption, efficien
cy, ethics and attitude among
Africans.
"Unless we Africans take our
selves seriously no one is going to
take us seriously, Mutambara said.
"Africans will not matter lor as long
as they think they can make it as in
dividuals."
"Africans are under attack and
they cannot succeed unless they
start to co-operate. There are more
than one billion Chinese through
out the world, and they all think
Chinese. Japanese think Japanese,
Indians think Indians and Ameri
cans think Americans but Africans
are not thinking African," Mutam
bara said in an interview this week
end.
He said that African unity is im
perative to any signilicant African
success. Furthermore, he said that
African Americans would never
make it without Alricans and that
the opposite is also true. "No small
group of Africans will succeed with
out the other," Mutambara said.
The tragedy among Africans
rests in their inability to rally their
resources as one entity for their own
good, he said. For example, he said
African Americans have $422 bil
lion buying power per year but
never realize any power out of it,
because they have not managed to
control the vast source of money.
"If they could spend that money
in their own businesses and recycle
the dollars among themselves — in
cluding investments in Africa —
then Africans would begin to mat
ter."
He said that he did not believe in
the notion that African Americans
were a minority. " This can only be
true if they are not thinking global
ly. It is a myth for Africans to regard
themselves a minority. Thinking
that way is just marginalizing your
self. Africans need a global consen
sus, and without it they will not mat
ter."
Mutambara is a 32-year-old
Zimbabwean citizen who is an assis

tant professor of robotics and
mechatronicsin the Mechanical En
gineering Department at the joint
Engineering College of Florida
A&M University and Florida State
University in Tallahassee, Fla.
As a Rhodes Scholar, he re
ceived a doctorate in 1995 in robot
ics from Merton College, Oxford
University in the United Kingdom
in just over two years and later car
ried out his research work with the
Oxford Robotics Research Group.
In 1996 he was a Visiting Re
search Fellow at Caltech and at the
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena. From May to August
1997 he was a visiting research sci
entist at the NASA Lewis Research
Center in Cleveland.
Mutambara has traveled exten
sively, presenting papers at interna
tional conferences while, at the
same time, visiting industrial plants
and engineering laboratories in
Japan, mainland Europe, the Unit
ed Kingdom and the United States.
"Technologically, Africans are
behind." Mutambara said. "We are
not competitive. We are lagging be
hind, and we have wrong priorities.
The caliber of our leaders leaves a
lot to be desired. And culturally we
are not defining ourselves and not
doing enough to advance our own
history."
Mutambara's main research in
terests include multi-sensor fusion,
decentralized estimation, decen
tralized control, mechatronics and
modular robotics. In February 1998
he authored a research book, 'De
centralized Estimation and Control
for Multi-sensor Systems."
