### Anuj Gupta Staff writer 
After passing out in Branner Hall
from excessive alcohol consumption,
a 17-year-old female prospective
freshman visiting for Admit Week
end was taken to Stanford Hospital
hv ambulance early Sunday morn
ing.
The woman was treated and re
leased a few hours later.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya was troubled by the
incident.
"The fact that alcohol was served
to a high school student is alarming
and deserves my most serious atten
tion." Montoya said. "I will be meet
ing [this) morning with my staff to
gather as much information as possi
ble and deliberate on what discipli
nary action will be taken."
The incident represents a serious
violation of University policy.
According to junior Bobby Fer
rario. Admit Weekend coordinator,
students who serve as house hosts
and room hosts during Admit Week
end are "specifically instructed not to
serve alcohol to prospective fresh-

men."
The girl, who
was staying with
a room host in
Cardenal, is a
student at the
Phillips Exeter
Academy in New
Hampshire.

However, according to freshman
Justine Fisher, a house host in Carde
nal. the girl spent little time in her
dorm, choosing to visit a friend
whom she knew from Exeter in
Branner.
"Her room host knew she was
going to Branner to visit a kid from
her high school Cardenal's re
sponsibility ended at that point,"
Fisher said.
According to sources in Branner,
she had initially visited Branner Sat
urday night before becoming ill. then
went to a party at Trancos with Bran
ner freshmen.
Upon returning to Branner, the
girl started to feel sick and, according
to several witnesses, began vomiting
in the hallway.
Freshman Toffi Dawson said he
was one of a group of students who
attempted to help the girl.
"We helped her into the bath
room. We were trying to take care of
her and get her to throw up more,"
Dawson said.
Witnesses said that the girl passed


Montoya
out while in the bathroom.
"She was lying on the fkxir, passed
out, and was just unresponsive."
Dawson said.
According to freshman Doug
Gardner, a Branner house host, the
girl never stopped breathing while
she was unconscious.
"At one point we could hear her
snore, so we realized she was still
breathing," he said.
Freshman Pei-Pei Lin, a house
host in Branner. said, "we tried to

wake her up so we could take her
back to her dorm, but she was out
cold. So we called an ambulance, and
they came right away."
Paramedics arrived and took the
girl into an ambulance on a stretcher,
while police officers remained on the
scene for questioning.
According to Gardner, police
cleared the scene immediately.
"Once the cops came, they made
everybody not involved with the inci
dent leave, and they just questioned
the RAs and those directly in
volved," he said.
According to Fisher, police at
tempted to place blame for the inci

dent on the Cardenal house and
room hosts.
"Police were trying to find some
one to blame, but I think that it's un
fortunateâ€” If anyone's responsible
it's the people who get themselves
drunk. No Stanford students should
be punished," Fisher said.
Montoya said disciplinary action
would center around an investigation
of whether or not any students violat
ed the Fundamental Standard.
"Certainly in a situation like this,
disciplinary action needs to be at least
considered," he said.
Stanford Police were unavailable
for comment.
