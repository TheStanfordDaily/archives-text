## Spring floats on Cardinal gridiron 
### 
We disagree with anyone who
believes they can find a more relax
ing activity on a sunny, spring day
than a scrimmage football game in
the middle of a carnival. It's college
football with all the hard edges and
sharp corners taken off: no scream
ing crowds, no drunken fans, no
cannons, 110 agony of defeat.
They were serving free hot dogs
at Stanford Stadium on Sunday.
Show us your average college foot
ball game with free hot dogs and
we'll show you a riot waiting to hap
pen.

Indeed, the sun was shining for
the Cardinal football team's annual
spring scrimmage, a civilized affair
featuring dozens of rambunctious
children playing on various inflated
objects and rides sprawled across
the track. Kids scampered around
the outskirts of the field, fidgeting
in line for a giant rubber slide, a
spinning gyroscopic contraption
and the ever-present bouncy castle.
Ordinarily, we don't think of a foot
ball game as being much of a place
for clowns on stilts, but somehow,
the guy didn't seem too out of place.
A few of the kids even seemed to
recognize that there was a football
game going on, but the couple hun
dred fans scattered in the stands
didn't seem too concerned about
the game. Watching an intrateam
scrimmage is always on odd feeling;
rooting for one side or the other
seems inappropriate, which leaves
most fans paralyzed in their seats
(although with an average fall Stan
ford crowd, things aren't that differ
ent).
At the same time, you want to
cheer for somebody. After all. this
was the new. improved Cardinal; a
fact highlighted by the cinematic,
Terminator 2-style media guides
carried by most of the fans.
So how new and improved is this
team? On paper, at least, it's quite a
bit improved, if not much newer.
The team has undergone some up
grades in the offseason, promoting
linebackers coach Kent Baer to de
fensive coordinator and bringing in
UNLV offensive coordinator Buzz
Preston, North western's Tom Brat
tan and Northern lowa's Denny
Schuler to coach the running backs,
offensive line and defensive back
field. respectively.

In addition, the team's new re
cruiting class includes a number of
highly touted skill players. Chris
Lewis — younger brother of Cardi
nal volleyball standout Robyn
Lewis — was one of the best high
school quarterbacks in the nation
this year, and yes, he will be on the
Stanford sidelines next year,
though he'll probably redshirt the
season.
But the core of the upcoming
year will be the returning starters —
the team is bringing back l l ) from
last year's young squad. Yester-

day's scrimmage featured (he first
team offense against the first-team
defense (with a few changes thrown
in for variety), and the outcome was
clear: the Cardinal offense domi
nated, winning 28-0. It was reminis
cent of some of the ridiculous scores
the Cardinal put up last year.
Pessimists such as ourselves
would ordinarily interpret that sort
of score as a clear-cut harbinger of
more of the same for the team this
season: lots of points, but the Hood
gates opening in our own endzone.
But with the sun shining and free
hot dogs in our hands, the potential
in the team seemed a little greater.
The offense looked undeniably
sharp.Todd Husak led the Cardinal
with short, crisp passes that went for
long gains and highlighted the day
with a 72-yard touchdown bomb to
Deßonnie Pitts that left the fans in
awe, if only for a moment.
Randy Fasani ran well on the
other side of the ball and could be a
definite option and bootleg threat
next season. OK, the defense was
not allowed to hit the quarterback,
but he was still able to show some
pretty slick moves.
So as Deßonnie Pitts slipped
past the secondary and legged out a
20-yard sprint, the hopes of the Car
dinal faithful hung in the air with
the ball in the spring sky. As Pitts
broke free, all eyes seemed to turn
away from the carnival and onto the
field. For an instant, despite all the
soft corners and clownish sideline
action, it almost seemed like Sep
tember at Stanford Stadium.
