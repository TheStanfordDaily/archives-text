Enquist's statement comes as no
surprise to fans who witnessed
UCLA's (49-2, 16-2) victories over
the Stanford Cardinal at the Stanford
Softball complex yesterday.
The 12-1 win in game one of the
doubleheader saw the Bruins put 10
hits on the board, including three
home runs and four doubles.
That game was the low point in a
weekend that saw Stanford go 1-3
against the Bruins and No. 5 Wash
ington.
"We got boat-raced," said Stan
ford head coach John Rittman in ref
erence to game one against UCLA.
"Our effort was fine, we just got
beat."
The Bruins pounced on the Cardi
nal right off the bat, as sophomore
catcher Stacey Nuveman tagged a

two-run home run over the left field
fence, that sailed in the air as far as the
scoreboard.
Nuveman single-handedly provid
ed a large share of the offense in game
one, as she belted two homers for five
RBIs. The home runs were numbers
24 and 25 of the season and came only
one day after numbers 22 and 23 at
California. In the twin bill with the
Cardinal, Nuveman tagged Stanford
for five hits and six RBIs. She leads
the country in homers, as well as
RBIs (69).
Junior center fielder Christie Am
brosi also made her presence felt with
four RBIs on two hits, including a
home run, as did junior Julie Marshall
with three doubles.
Stanford's only run came in the
third inning, as junior Kellie Wigin
ton reached base on a walk, advanced
to second and third on illegal pitches,
and scored on a past ball.
Bruin junior Courtney Dale im
proved her undefeated record to 25-
0, while Stanford senior Marcy
Crouch fell to 19-9.
Despite the game one blowout,
the Cardinal still came out confidant
in game two.
"I was impressed how we came
back in the second game. We were in
it," Rittman said.
Game two remained scoreless
through three innings, as Cardinal se
nior pitcher Becky Blevins was able
to keep the Bruins off-balance.
"Becky was really aggressive, got
the corners, kept the ball down and
hit her spots," Rittman said.
Down only 1-0, Wiginton led off
the sixth inning with a fierce line
drive that ricocheted off Bruin fresh

man pitcher Amanda Freed's leg.
The Cardinal, however, was unable
to advance Wiginton past first.
UCLA added two insurance runs
with a combination of singles in the
top of the seventh inning and held on
for the 3-0 win.
It was not only at the plate that the
Bruins put on a show. UCLA's de
fense was flawless (in the day, and its
pitching allowed only nine hits in
both games combined while striking
out nine. The Cardinal only managed
one multi-hit inning all day.
Despite the numbers and frustrat
ing losses, to the Cardinal, the Bruins

were just another team in an incredi
ble conference.
"They are really good and we have
a lot of respect for them," Blevins
said. "But all teams in the Pac-10 are
comparable. They are beatable."
Although Stanford wasn't able to
take a game from the Bruins, it took
one of two from the Huskies (35-12,
8-7) the day before.
Game one was a tough loss for
Stanford, as it was unable to hold
onto an early 2-0 lead.
