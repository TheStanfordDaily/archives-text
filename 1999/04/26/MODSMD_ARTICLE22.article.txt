NCAA Championships don't
happen overnight. Behind the one
magical season that culminates with
a title, there are years of near-misses
and almost-theres — years where
the foundation for the champi
onship program are laid.
For the No. 8 Stanford women's
gymnastics team, 1999 was one of
those years.
Throughout the season, the Car
dinal program made tremendous
strides towards becoming a national
championship contender. Stanford
set several team and individual
school records over the course of the
1999 season and captured a Region
al tournament title for the first time
in school history.
In the end though, Stanford
came up short of its ultimate goal
and finished l()th overall and fifth in
its Thursday afternoon qualifying

session at the NCAA Champi
onship tournament thereby missing
out on a chance to compete in the
"Super Six" team finals on Friday.
The top three teams from each of
the two qualifying sessions on
Thursday advanced to Friday's
Super Six.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Thursday: No. 8 Stanford finished
tenth in NCAA Championships.

"We have to take it step by step,
and while we wanted to take a big
ger step this year. I'm still really
proud of our team," said senior co
captain Amy Murakami. " This pro
gram is taking steps towards earning
the respect that it deserves."
On Thursday, Stanford finished
fifth with a score of 194.000, 0.525
points away from a trip to the team
finals. Pacific 10 Conference rival
Arizona State, which the Cardinal
had defeated earlier in the year.

scored a 194.525 to capture the third
and final qualifying spot. UCLA
won the afternoon session with a
1%.4()() and Alabama finished sec
ond with a score of 194.950.
The Cardinal fell behind early
with a disastrous performance on
the balance beam, having to count
three falls and earning only a 47.375,
but recovered well in its next three
rotations to put itself back into con
tention. Ultimately though, the
deficit incurred on the beam proved
too much to overcome.
"We had a shaky start with the
beam which was disappointing be
cause we'd been training really well
[on the beam]. Maybe it was be
cause it was our first event, but we
really picked it up after that and
fought hard through the next three
events," Murakami said.
Although the Cardinal did not
qualify as a team for the finals, two
Stanford gymnasts, juniors Larissa
Fontaine and Sarah Harding, quali

fied for the individual event champi
onships on Saturday. Fontaine, the
defending NCA A Champion on the
vault, qualified with a 9.850 and
took third place on Saturday with a
9.8125. Fontaine was making only
her second appearance after recov
ering from a broken finger that had
kept her out of action for almost two
and a half months.
Harding, who entered the tour
nament ranked 11th nationally in
the floor exercise, qualified for the
floor exercise final with a 9.875 in
Thursday's opening round. On Sat
urday, Harding finished in ninth
place with a 9.750. Both Fontaine
and Harding were named first team
All-Americans for their perfor
mances.

Cardinal in Thursday's qualifying
session as she finished ninth in the
all-around competition with a
