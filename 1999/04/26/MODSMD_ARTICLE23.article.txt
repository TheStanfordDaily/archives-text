# Stanford takes two from Cal; holds share of Pac 10 lead
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Brian Sager has always had a live
arm. The 6-foot-5,215-pound fresh
man's fastball and sharp-cutting
breaking ball were so hard and so
fast that Baseball America named
him the nation's fourth-best player
coming out of high school last year.
However, after turning down
more than a million dollars trom the
Arizona Diamondbacks to attend
Stanford. Sager's collegiate perfor
mances had been inconsistent, espe
cially under pressure.
Yesterday though, in one of the
Cardinal's most important games
this season, Sager stayed in control,
bore down and took California out
of the game.
With the Stanford offense churn
ing out 13 runs, Sager's eight-inning,
four-hit, one-run outing was more
than enough to propel the Cardinal
to a crucial victory. The 13-5 win
leaves No. 4 Stanford in a tie with
USC for first place in the Pacific 10
Conference.
Stanford (29-12 14-4 Pac-10)
came into the weekend series

against the seventh-place Golden
Bears tied for the league lead with
IJSC. Though the Cardinal split its
first two games with Cal (21-28, 7-
11), the Trojans took both of their
first two at Arizona State to move
into sole possession of first place.
However, because USC lost to the
Sun Devils 16-10 yesterday, the
Stanford victory moved the Cardi
nal back into a tie atop the Pac-10.

BASEBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford (29-12,
14-4 Pacific 10 Conference) 13, Cali
fornia (21-28,7-11) 5.
■ Saturday: Stanford 14, California
11.
■ Friday: California 11, Stanford 9.

"It was one of the bigger games
of the year and [Sager] came up big
for us," Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said. "He's really come of
age. He's a much better pitcher now
than he was two months ago."
Usually the offense would have
been the story of yesterday's game.
However since last Friday's 10-1 loss

to USC, Stanford's prodigious of
fensive production has become
commonplace. It has scored an aver
age of more than 13 runs a game in
the last five contests. The problem
for the Cardinal has been its pitch
ing.
Yesterday that was no problem.
From the get-go, Sager looked in
charge. After allowing a lead-off
single in the bottom of the first in
ning, he set the tone for the after
noon by striking out the next three
batters.
In the fourth, he seemed to strug
gle with his control. He hit sopho
more catcher Mike Tonis to open
the inning and then walked three
more Bears to hand Cal an easy run.
But, with the bases still loaded,
Sager struck out the next batter to
end the inning and any remaining
threat.
One of the more impressive
facets of Sager's performance was
how he shut down California's two
stars, Tonis and sophomore third
baseman Xavier Nady. Tonis came
into the series hitting .410 with 13
home runs and 44 RBI. Nady was at
.381 with 54 RBIs and a league-lead

ing 21 home runs. Sager held them
hitless while striking them out three
times combined.
"Me and [pitching coach Tom|
Dunton talked before the game
about staying mostly hard and away
from them — on the outer half of the
plate," he said. "I had really good lo
cation throwing out there so 1 think
it worked really well for me."
It worked especially well when
Sager mixed his outside pitches with
hard fastballs on the hands. After
many hitters were buzzed with fast
balls up and in, they took weak,
awkward swings at his outside pitch
es, resulting in numerous lazy fly
balls and innocent ground outs.
Friday's and Saturday's dramatic
comebacks were in direct contrast
to yesterday's blowout.
Friday afternoon, Cal jumped to
an early , lead off Stanford sopho
more Jason Young, a Berkeley na
tive.
In the second inning. Young gave
up a double and hit two consecutive
batters to load the bases for sopho
more left fielder Curtis Johnson.
