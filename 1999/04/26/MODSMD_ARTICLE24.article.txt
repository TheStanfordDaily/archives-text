# Men take sixth at NCAAs
## 
### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
The No. 12 men's gymnastics
team was unable to overcome phe
nomenal performances from No. 1
Michigan and No. 2 Ohio State and
finished sixth at the NCAA Cham
pionship preliminaries on Thurs
day night, failing to qualify for the
team finals.
The team improved dramatical
ly over last season — when it fin
ished last at the MPSF Champi
onships and failed to qualify for
Regionals - and earlier this season
when it was ranked last in its divi
sion.
"Not too long ago, my team was
ranked 14th in the nation and sixth
in the West Region," said Stanford
head coach Sadao Hamada. "Luck
ily we hit our routines two weeks
ago at BYU, and I was able to bring
the team back to Nebraska."
Once again, the Cardinal was
led by junior co-captain Jason Kat
sampes, who holds Stanford's top
score in four of the six individual
events on the season. Not only did
he score a career high 57.850 in the
all-around competition (earning
him a fourth-place finish), but he
also finished second in the pommel
horse (9.800) and fourth in the par
allel bars (9.750). The last two
scores earned him a spot in the in
dividual event finals held Saturday
night after the team finals. His final
performance of the season earned
a fifth-place finish and All-Ameri
can honors on the parallel bars
(9.6875) and a seventh-place spot
on the pommel horse (9.5250).

Katsampes was not the only
Cardinal to perform well on the
pommel horse, as Stanford contin
ued its streak of dominance on the
event. Cardinal gymnasts scored a
38.650 to take top team honors in
that event. The score was its third
highest of the season, trailing only
its score at the UC-Santa Barbara
Invitational (39.2) and its score at
the NCAA West Regional two
weeks ago (38.825).

MEN'S GYMNASTICS
■Thursday: No. 12 Stanford finished
sixth at NCAA Championship pre
liminaries.

The team also showed vast im
provement on other events includ
ing the vault and the high bar. On
the vault. Cardinal gymnasts
scored a season high (37.825), but
even so they finished fifth — ahead
of only BYU. The worst event for
the Cardinal was the still rings, hut
even in that event, the team turned
in a stellar performance, earning its
second-highest score of the season
(37.2).
"After watching videotapes of
some of the eastern teams, we
knew that we had the ability and
the talent to win the champi
onship." said senior co-captain
Scott Finkelstein. "[Thursday] The
consistency just wasn't where it
needed to be."
Ultimately, even with the over
all and specific improvement and
the established leadership of Kat
sampes. the team finished in last
place - but not from any lack of tal
ent.

"We were confident that we had
the ability to qualify for the team fi
nals," said graduate assistant coach
Clarence Miao. "The scores just
didn't go our way."
The experience that the team
gained in this, its latest foray into
the national championships,
should prove particularly benefi
cial next season when the Cardinal
should once again compete for a
national championship. Stanford
will return 12 of its 13 gymnasts —
everyone except Finkelstein.
In order for a team to advance to
the finals, it must finish among the
top three at the preliminary com
petition. The East was almost able
to completely sweep these three
spots in Thursday's competition.
Going into the final rotation,
Michigan State led the pack with
Ohio State slightly behind, and No.
4 Penn State clung to the final spot.
However. No. 5 Nebraska came
back in the final rotation to surpass
the Nittany Lions, taking the final
spot in the team finals and sal
vaging the match for the West.
Nebraska sophomore gymnast
Jason Hardabura captured another
all-around title making it nine for
this season, the most among any
gymnast. BYU finished .450 ahead
of the Cardinal, barely avoiding a
last- place finish.
The final team competition was
held the next day. Preliminary po
sitions held for the finals as Michi
gan captured its first national
championship since 1970. Ohio
State was unable to capitalize on
the momentum it gathered, ended
up finishing in second place.
