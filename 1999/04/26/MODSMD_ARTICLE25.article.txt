# Yearly, dozens tie knot in campus landmark
## Mem Chu Marriage 
### Michael R. Fainelli 
Have you ever dreamed of hearing your
wedding bells rung from atop one of the na
tion's most prominent conservative think
tanks? That may not sound very romantic,
but couples who tie the knot at Memorial
Church, which lost its bell tower in the 1906
earthquake, may hire a professional carol
loneur to chime the bell of Hoover Tower at
the end of their ceremony.
Nearby bell-ringing is just one of the
amenities that makes Memorial Church an
attractive venue for the approximately 180
couples who marry there each year.
The resplendent mosaics, stained glass
windows and Biblical murals create an au
gust, majestic atmosphere. The thick stone
walls and high ceilings keep the air cool dur
ing the hottest and busiest seasons of spring
and summer, when the church hosts as many
as six weddings per week.
In command of this mighty matrimonial
bastion is Betsy Koester, Stanford's wedding
coordinator. Her task is to oversee all the
preparation — the scheduling, hiring and re
hearsals — which ensures that each ceremo
ny goes smoothly.
A member of the Class of '58 and a
woman of motherly confidence, Koester bal
ances the expectations of fastidious couples
with the traditions of the church. Requests
for the presence of pets, the playing of rock
music, the throwing of rice and the releasing
of doves during the ceremony have all been
tactfully turned down by Koester.
By decree of Jane Stanford, Memorial
Church is non-denominational. People of
Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Sufi and Islam
ic traditions have walked down the aisle.
Only civil ceremonies are prohibited.
One of the engaged pair must be a Stan
ford student, alumnus, faculty member or
the child of any of these.
There is a $1,400 fee for the use of the
church and the services of the wedding coor
dinator, sound engineer and sexton.
Some of that money covers the cost of
three premarital counseling sessions, re
quired of every couple before they say, "I
do."

According to "Wedding Notes," a
brochure for couples interested in reserving
the church, these sessions provide "an op
portunity to confirm and strengthen the au
thenticity of your decision to marry and the
quality of your relationship." Add on a $2(X)
payment for the clergyman and another $200
for the organist for a grand total of $ 1,8(X).
That may sound pricey, but Koester in
sists that the bill "is commensurate with the
services we provide."
Couples who cringe at the cost need not
worry: They will have plenty of time to save
up. There is a waiting list of three months
and for the most sought-after time slots in
the summer, reservations must be made
about a year in advance.
For many couples who don't have the nec
essary affiliation with Stanford, the mini
mum funds or the patience to wait for
months, photographs are the next best thing.
If you see a photographer taking pictures of
a bride and groom near the flower beds in
the Oval or behind Memorial Church,
chances are they've been married off campus
and have just dropped by for the pictures.
On a recent afternoon bride Emily Sohn
and groom Byung Choi stood on the steps of
the Ouad with friends and family waiting for
their photographer to arrive. Their wedding
was scheduled for the next day at the Korean
Presbyterian Church in San Jose, but they
wanted be photographed on a beautiful col
lege campus.
Why Stanford? "It's a beautiful spot,"
Sohn said. "It's less crowded than at other
schools."
Koester notes that the picture taking is "a
phenomenon that is wide spread especially
in the Asian community."
She said these couples unfortunately
sometimes intrude on the serenity of cere
monies she has helped prepare.
"One of the reasons I was hired was to
make people feel honored, that they are not
part of a wedding mill," she said. "Other
wedding parties crowding the Inner Ouad
detracts from that specialness."
Memorial Church marriages take place
Saturdays, all day. Uninvited students may
not attend.
