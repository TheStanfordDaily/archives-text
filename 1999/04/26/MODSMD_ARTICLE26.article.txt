# 3 faculty win Guggenheims
## Profs. Chang, Riordan, White awarded research funding, leaves of absence 
### Wendy Marinaccio Contributing writer 
Three Stanford faculty members received Guggenheim Fellow
ship Awards this month. Gordon Chang, Brian White and Michael
Riordan will take leaves of absence during the 1999-2(XM) school
year subsidized research in their respective fields by the Guggen
heim Foundation to conduct.
Chang said the Guggenheim Award is "one of the most well
known fellowships available to academics— The competition is
stiff."
This year, the foundation weeded through 2,785 applicants to
pick 179 scholars and artists across all fields for the fellowship. It
awarded a total of $6.()62,(KK), with an average grant of $33,866.
The application process is short considering its competitiveness.
White reports that he submitted only a research proposal and a
two-page application describing his accomplishments.
Last year's Stanford recipients were Assoc. History Prof. Paula
Findlen and English Prof. David Riggs
Observing optimal shapes
To demonstrate his research. Mathematics Prof. Brian White
pulled out the vat of soapy water he keeps in his office and started
blowing bubbles with it. "Every time you blow a soap bubble, that
soap bubble is solving a math problem," he said. He explained that
bubbles are an optimal shape, because they have the smallest sur
face area for the amount of volume.
One question White will research is whether shapes seen in na
ture, such as the hexagonal shape of honeybees' hives, really are the
most efficient shapes. He said that although he "thinks the bees are
smart" and construct hives in the most efficient way possible, he
wants to prove it.
White will attempt to discover the answer by going through
other possible shapes and proving they are not as optimal. Going
through this process will reveal more elements of what the solution
must be. For example, he said, "you will never have more than three
edges coming together... so we already know a lot of things about
the optimal object, even if we don't know what it is."
Studying Asian-American history
Chang, who said he "jumped up and down" when he heard of his
fellowship, is an associate professor of history. He will the fel
lowship to study American military experiences in Asia. Hi'said a
specific area of concern is the consequences of frequent war with
Asia, "for American culture and our ongoing interaction with East

Asia."
His previous work deals with American foreign relations histo
ry and Asian-American history, two areas that he said are not often
considered together. He speculated that the aspect of his a|'plica
tion which pushed it over the edge was"the interest in linking do
mestic life with global interactions."
Chang said foreign and domestic history "are very much con
nected," and he has written a book about each issue: "Friends and
Enemies: The United States, China and the Soviet Union, 1948-
1972," which he said describes "the interrelationship between the
three countries during the Cold War," and "Morning Glory,
Evening Shadow: Yamato Ichihashi and His Writings During
World War II," about a Japanese-American professor at Stanford
who was moved to an internment camp during WWII.
The politics of physics
Riordan will spend eight months at the helm of a gioup re
searching the history of the superconducting supercollider, a Texas
research facility that was partially constructed at a cost of $2 billion
to the government. "It was built to be the world's largest scientific
project," Riordan said, but the project was terminated by Congress
in 1993 before it could be completed.
He is the assistant to the director of SLAC and a lecturer in the
History and Philosophy of Science Program. He has written sever
al books about the history of science, including "The Hunting of the
Quark," describing the experiment that resulted in the discovery of
quarks.
Riordan will write a chapter for a book about the supercollider
project during the fellowship. He said the chapter, titled "Washing
ton and the World," will "focus on Congress and the unsuccessful
attempts to bring in foreign money" for the project. According to
Riordan, "If there had been substantial foreign contributions to the
project, it would have been much more difficult to kill."
Riordan became interested in the history of politics and physics
when he said he "had a ringside seat of some of the action" working
on the superconducting supercollider project in Washington, D.C..
in 1991.
Guggenheim confusion
There is a similarity between Stanford's 1999 Guggenheim fel
lows, other than being "advanced professionals in mid-career," a
requirement for receiving the award.
When the letter announcing their awards first arrived, none of
them was sure what it was saying.
"A few weeks ago, I got a letter that sounded like I got it, but it
was a little vague," White said. "I didn't want to go out and cele
brate."
According to Riordan, the letter said his name was "being for
warded to the trustees."
Chang said he wondered, "Is this good news?"
A public, unambiguous notice of the fellowship was sent in niid-
April.
