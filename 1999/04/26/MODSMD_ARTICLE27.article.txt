## Stanford speaks Letters

Mr. Daily threatens with lawsuit

I am writing this letter to inform you that
you will soon be receiving a letter from one of my
LAWYERS. Scared yet, JERK? How dare you rip
OFF my name?
You don't see the Carson City Gazette using
my brother's name as its title? Do you? The Carson
Daily my ASS! Why is that!!?? Is it just because he's
somebody famous and I'm not??!! So Mr. MTV
Freakin' VJ doesn't get his name ripped off because
he's dating Jennifer Love Hewitt!
I could have had her if I wanted, but no —
he had to go on TV and play all sensitive and suck up
to the mass media — damn sellout! You don't see me
going around flaunting my sensitivity to get chicks,
now — do you!!??
And I'm very sensitive — I love small chil
dren and wild animals! I think rhesus monkeys are
damn cute!! But I'm not going to go on TV and tell
you about it. I'll show you sensitivity because you're
the picture of it — stealing my name ... just wait
until my lawyers get sensitive on your ass!!!!!

Give us press!
We are writing to protest The Daily's policy
excluding us from its pages. It's not our fault that our
fathers are who they are. But it shouldn't preclude us
from getting the media attention that we crave and
rightly deserve.
We scout out reporters and photographers,
but they just ignore us. We even tried to hold a vigil
in White Plaza but to no avail. The Daily just will not
budge.
For God's sake: it's easier to get into Time
magazine than our own college newspaper. We want
press. We'll even divorce our parents. We don't care.
Two members of the Stanford community whose
names cannot be mentioned in the paper because of
The Daily\ policy.

Provost will have last laugh

I am sick and tired of being lambasted in your
liberal newspaper! So what if I don't give tenure to
women and minorities? Have you read "The Bell
Curve"? Terrific book, itls on my coffee table. You think
that lam a black female? Ha! Ha! Ha! called a good
make-up job, people. It's called fake boobs, people.
Do you have any idea how powerful I will be
next year when that Bush boy wins the presidency? You
may be laughing now, but I will destroy you then. Ha!
Ha! Ha! Yes, I will have the last laugh!

YOU try being funny!
My name Ls Bob Gates, and I write a weekly humor
column for the "Diversions" section. I am writing this let
ter to apologize for the lack of humor in some of my arti
cles. I know, I know — some of them really suck. But you
try writing them.
Try writing an article that make people laugh while
not offending some people. Then try writing another arti
cle making those "some people" laugh while not offend
ing the original group, and you'll find that you have two
groups calling in with angry complaints and not a single
group laughing. That Is because people on this campus are
unwilling to laugh at themselves.
This is not uncommon. At Harvard, people do
not laugh at themselves. But then again, they do not
laugh at all. (Now Harvard is angry with me, but Stanford
is laughing. I have never been to Harvard — I am JOK
ING. Laugh — you'll like it!)
To remedy this inability to laugh at themselves,
people make fun of politics. But at Stanford, politics is
one subject that we are not allowed to touch.
So, basically we're all mentally ill, out
$3(),000/year, and unable to talk about it on campus. But
that's all good because sharing your opinions and ideas
really isn't what our pre-business education should be
about.

Nothing better to do

I am writing this letter in response to a letter
that I wrote in Friday's paper ("I Disagree with
Myself'), which was a letter in response to my letter
in Wednesday's issue ("I'm just writing because I like
to see my name in print") of the Daily. I am sitting
alone in my room in Kimball (naked) right now with
out anything to do and I decided to write one more
letter. My network server is down and I cant get any
porn. But I digress.
I was wrong, and my first letter was right,
and this third letter confirms that. Thank you for
being there to listen. I don't know what I'd do with
out you guys.

Cow ell speaks, you listen!
There seems to be some confusion about the
way we run things over here at Cowell Student
Health Center. I think it's about time that we cleared
up some issues.
I am a nurse practitioner, which means that I
wasn't smart enough to be a doctor. I can also pre
scribe medication, yet I dont know what it will do to
you.
Yes, we make you take off your clothes if
you have a head cold. Yes, we draw blood no matter
what. It sells quite well on the black market. Yes,
Tylenol is the cure for everything. Why? Because we
are funded by Tylenol, and it makes them happy!

Great ads, folks!
First of all, I would like to commend you all
for being bold enough to run the types of ads that few
newspapers across the country would even touch.
I seemed to have lost that issue of the paper
where you printed an egg donor ad, a sperm donor
ad, a Playboy ad for their Pac 10 issue, an ad for that
nifty new brand of anal beads, and an ad for penile

reduction surgery. I am actually interested in partici
pating in all of these services. Could I drop by some
time to pick up the contact numbers? Thanks.

Daily has festering sores, says SLE
We, the students of the Structured Liberal
Education Program, are writing in response to the
egregious intellectual bankruptcy ensconced in the
pages of the Daily. We are ashamed of this University
when not one of your writers has the raison d'etre of
an Emile Zola or the erudite fortitude of a Soren
Kierkegaard to root out in this afflicted university
what Fourier called "the festering sores of blind
acceptance."
Normally, we would enumerate the myriad
festering sores of the Daily in a 30 page dissertation,
but we have to eliminate all the passive voice in our
SLE papers by tomorrow.

Reader advocates'racial print war'
I HATE WHITE PEOPLE.
I dont really. I am just writing this letter
because I want to ignite a racial print war. You see,
I'll say that I hate whites, and then some white guy
will respond saying that he hates my obscure ethnici
ty. And before you know it, we'll be cluttering th
epages of the Daily with nonsensical hate prose.
Everyone will participate! So what do you say?
