# Colorado tragedy hits Farm
## Littleton residents and other students touched by tragedy 
### Chaney Rankin Contributing writer 
Reactions to the ghastly high school shooting in Lit
tleton. Colo., have rippled accross the nation, bringing
feelings of shock and horror to the Stanford communi
ty-
Freshman Caley Horan is an alumna of Columbine
High School, where the shooting occurred, and has had
a difficult week coping with the tragedy's aftereffects.
When she heard about the shooting, "1 was
shocked," Horan said. "I'm doing better now. but it's
been a rough couple of days."
Last Tuesday two high school seniors walked into
Columbine and began to spray gunfire indiscriminately
from guns hidden beneatfi black trench coats. Twelve
students and one teacher were killed and dozens more
wounded.
Joe Cavanaugh, a sophomore and a Daily sports ed
itor, lives about a mile away from Columbine but did

not attend the school. His reaction was "pretty much
shock, that something like that could hit so close to
home. I started thinking about all the time I've spent
over there, hanging around on the baseball field and li
brary."
Horan knew some of the victims, though she said she
was lucky in not having any younger siblings or other
family at the school.
"Most of my close friends, luckily, weren't there."
1 ioran said. "It was Senior Ditch Day, so they weren't at
the school that day." She had heard that her favorite
teacher was shot, but was relieved to find out that she
had only been grazed by a bullet. Horan also knew the
teacher and two of the girls that were killed.
Cavanaugh was also fortunate; he did not lose any
friends or family in the shooting, though the brother of
a friend of his was wounded. He is also acquainted with
the brother of Dylan Klebold, one of the shooters.
Horan knew who the shooters were, and said no one
could ever have expected something like this to happen.
"The whole Trenchcoat Mafia thing was blown way out
of proportion by the media. That's what the other stu-
dents called them, as a joke. They
were the same kind of kids you have
in every high school, the ones who
play [Dungeons and Dragons] and
all that stuff."
Horan is grateful for the support
she has found here; while she has
had to miss class and soccer prac
tice, she said her team and dorm
mates have been wonderful in help
ing her through this crisis.
"I tried to go to class a couple of
days ago, but they were talking

about it so I had to leave," she said.
Horan struggled with the deci
sion of whether or not to go home
for the funerals, but in the end de
cided that it would be too painful. "I
have a lot of friends, you know,
from other schools, who are going
home, but 1 just think it would be
too hard," she said.
The reactions were certainly not
limited to Coloradans. Freshman
Lonnie Uso remembers when he
first heard of it:"The first thing that
came to my mind was that my broth
er's wife works for a Colorado
school district; the news didn't say
what school it was. When 1 heard it

was a high school — she works at an
elementary school — I was relieved
for a minute, and then I realized
what had happened."
"It's terrifying," Uso continued.
"It's ridiculous that three screwed
up high school kids could do this."
Freshman Lucas Munoz agreed.
"Everyone is blaming it on gun cul
ture, but that's ridiculous. I was
raised in a gun culture [in El Paso,
Texas], my dad has guns, I know
how to shoot, but I've never killed
anyone. Everyone is looking for a
place to put the blame, but the only
place it can really go is on those two
dead kids."
