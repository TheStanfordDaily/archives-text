# Goodwin to retire
## Men's golf icon will end 40-year career 
### Ben Jones Contributing writer 
When most people retire, they
think about heading to the golf
course. For Stanford men's golf
coach Wally Goodwin, that's the last
place he wants to be. He's headed to
the family's fifth-generation ranch in
Wyoming, far away from the fairways
and greens.
Goodwin, 72, announced his deci
sion last week to leave Stanford after
next year's golf season. With his de
parture, Stanford loses an icon of the
athletic department and the man who
has taken the golf program from rela
tive obscurity to national promi
nence.
For Goodwin, the chance to take
some time off to spend with family
was impossible to pass up. "I'm 72
and have been coaching for 40 years,"
Goodwin said, "I think it might be the
smart move to take a few years.
"My wife Nancy and I are looking
forward to getting back to our ranch
in Wyoming and enjoying the pro
jects there as well as the many other
activities that living in that part of the
country will have waiting for us."
Considering Goodwin's storied
and eclectic coaching career, he has
earned his rest. In more than 40 years
of coaching, Goodwin has been a
track, football and basketball coach
at the high school level and served as
an assistant basketball coach at Stet
son University in Florida before com
ing to Stanford in 1987, having previ
ously coached the Northwestern golf
team.
A second major factor in Good
win's decision to leave was the strong
recruiting class coming to the Farm
next year. Goodwin plans to stay on
and coach during the 1999-21 XX) sea
son to introduce the players to the
program and then, with his depar
ture, "leave things perfect for the
next coach."
Apart from that recruiting class,
Goodwin will leave a significant im
pact on the Stanford golf program.
This legacy includes a number of na
tional-caliber victories, including the

1994 NCAA team championship.
Goodwin's list of accomplish
ments includes two team and three
individual Pacific 10 Conference
championships. Personally, he is a
two-time Pac-10 coach of the year
and was the NCAA coach of the year
in 1994.
In his 12 years, Goodwin has pro
duced seven All-America award win
ners, including first team nominees
Tiger Woods, Notah Begay 111 and
current senior Joel Kribel, all of
whom garnered the award multiple
times.
Despite the long list of accom
plishments, Goodwin finds his
proudest moments from Stanford in
one of the team's failures. Coming off
of the 1994 NCAA Championship
and with the addition of Woods, pos
sibly the biggest college recruit of all
time, the team was poised to repeat in
1995.
The team, however, fell to Okla
homa State in a one-hole playoff,
barely missing a second champi
onship. Goodwin talked with joy
about the team's reaction.
"We take our most spectacular
memories from defeats," the coach
said, commenting on his team's ma
turity.
Talking about the teams of the
mid-1990'5, the conversation in
evitably turned to Woods, the young
golf phenom who spent two years at
Stanford before moving on to the
professional ranks. Goodwin recalls
his first encounter with Woods where
he saw the boy featured in a maga
zine at age 13.
The coach, ever conscious of
prospective recruits, sent Woods a
postcard asking him to keep Stanford
in mind when he made his college de
cision.
In a now-famous letter. Woods
promptly replied tot he coach'scorre
spondence and expressed his interest
in the university. Five years later,
having won three consecutive US( i A
U.S. Junior Championships and
worldwide recognition, he enrolled at
Stanford.
Goodwin notes that the athletic

department was not prepared for
Woods' impact. The usually sleepy
golf office, located at the Stanford
Golf Course, was inundated by press
requests. Goodwin explained that
the office averaged an unheard-of 51
phone calls a day during Woods' two
years at Stanford.
Despite Woods' numerous
achievements on the course, includ
ing the 19% NCAA Individual
Championship, Goodwin was most
impressed by his dedication and work
ethic.
"When we would leave for tour
naments," Goodwin said, "he was al
ways the first one to the van, suitcase
packed, McDonald's bag in hand,
while the other guys were just getting
out of bed."
Another star performer from
Goodwin's squad was Casey Martin,
whom the coach calls "my inspiration
for five years."
Goodwin said he was disappoint
ed in many PGA tour players' objec
tions to Martin's use of a cart in tour
nament play, a handicap necessitated
by a genetic disorder that has crip
pled his lower right leg.
The coach is elated with the way
his former player is performing.
"Casey," Goodwin said, "is Stan
ford's gift to the PG A tour."
Goodwin's gifts to Stanford and
the world of golf have been numer
ous. A poignant example of his im
pact on the university is evident in the
number of letters of interest received
from high school age golfers. That fig
ure has gone from three in Good
win's first year to somewhere be
tween s(X)and 1,000 this year.
"I applaud and appreciate the 12
years of service Wally Goodwin has
given to Stanford University," Ath
letic Director Ted Lcland said in a
press release. "Not only did he bring
the Stanford men's golf program to
the top of the collegiate world, but he
handled the program with class and
dignity."
"We will miss him tremendously,"
Leland said, "but wish him and his
family all the best in the years to
come."
