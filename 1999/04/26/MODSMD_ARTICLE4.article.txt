# Stanford hosts forum on prevention of school violence

### Khai Nguyen Contributing writer 
Teachers from across the country gathered this week
end to discuss techniques for violence prevention and
conflict resolution in schools, particularly timely after the
recent student violence in Colorado.
The "Best Practice Forum" was headed by the Pro
gram for Youth Negotiators, a non-profit organization
recently selected by the U.S. departments of Justice and
Education as a model program for school-based conflict
resolution. The program provides a curriculum to teach
middle-school kids the art of negotiation to solve prob
lems without resorting to violence.
In response to the recent tragedy at Columbine High
in Littleton, Colo., Bruce Richman, a member of the
board of directors of the program, said "I hope that the
country strongly reacts, strongly takes some steps for
ward, serious steps."
The incident "shows the need for prevention in
schools, programs like [the Program for Youth Negotia-

tors], parent involvement and partic
ular attention to identifying symp
toms at an early age," he added.
The forum was sponsored by the
David and Lucile Packard Founda
tion, a major program benefactor,
and hosted by the Stanford Center
on Conflict and Negotiation.
Teachers from Massachusetts,
New York, L.os Angeles. San Fran-

Cisco and even Argentina gathered at
the Landau Eeonomics Building to
share the teaching strategies that
were the most useful to help kids gain
negotiation skills.
Using a medical model, they dis
cussed the problem "symptoms" in
the classrooms, came up with a "di
agnosis," worked out possible solu
tions and derived an active "treat
ment plan" for each of the problems.
Their conclusions will contribute to
the program's teaching curriculum ti
tled "Young Negotiators."

Karen Robinson, who taught the
Young Negotiators curriculum for
three years in Crittenden Middle
School in Mountain View, said the
program gave her students "alterna
tives to fighting," and taught them
"thinking instead of reacting."
Hut it is "more than violence pre
vention," Richmansaid. "It is a sense
of empowerment."
Since Jared Curhan, a fellow at
the center, founded the program in
1993, the organization has trained
teachers from more than 4(X) schools

in more than 28 school districts to
teach its curriculum to students
across the United States, Canada,
Argentina and Israel. Curhan also
co-teaches a class on conflict resolu
tion â€” Psychology IX2/256: "Misun
derstanding. Conflict and Negotia
tion."
The curriculum focuses on "em
pathy." training students in conflicts
to try to understand the other per
son's interests and underlying mo
tives.
"One of the critical wavs to get

what you want is to know the interest
of the other party," Curhan said. Stu
dents learn to ask, "how can their
needs and [the needs of others] work
together? ... What can [the groups]
do together to attain the interests and
resolution?"
These techniques are similar to
those used to resolve international
conflicts in diplomacy, according to
Curhan.
According to many participating
teachers across the United States and
in at-risk areas in Argentina, the pro

gram has been successful in reducing
suspension and violence in schools.
One school cited a 50 percent reduc
tion in suspensions.
Richman said a challenge to the
program is fighting the "back to ba
sics" philosophy of those who de
mand a focus on only traditional
teachings of math, English and sci
ence.
"Education should also teach life
skills and address emotional needs"
that serve as a foundation to acade
mics, Richman said.
