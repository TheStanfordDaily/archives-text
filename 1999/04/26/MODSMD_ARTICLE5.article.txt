# Walker caps off Herstory

"There is no one feminist move
ment," Rebecca Walker said in Fri
day's keynote address for the annual
Herstory month. Walker is the
founder of the Third Wave Direct
Action Corporation and a contribut
ing editor of Ms. magazine.
" There are so many ingrained so
cial definitions of what it means to be
a feminist," Walker observed, that
many young women feel alienated
and "can't consider [themselves]
part of a history of societal transfor
mation."
She told the Annenberg Audito
rium audience that "tragically, rather
than struggling to locate themselves

in some continuum of feminism,
some young men and women simply
bow out."
Walker, the daughter of writer
Alice Walker, is the author of "To
Be Real: Telling the Truth and
Changing the Face of Feminism."
The book, a collection of essays, ex
plores the complex reasons today's
young women often eschew the
"feminist" label.
Walker got the idea behind "To
Be Real" while she was fundraising
for the Third Wave Direct Action
Corporation, which she describes as
a "multi-racial, multi-class, multi
gender, multi-issue" social activism
organization.
"I would do my spiel and come to
the my point where I would say this is

the next wave of feminism. As soon
as I started to say feminism people
kind of lost it. There was this visible
reaction to the word," Walker said.
Walker asked "some women who
hesitated identifying themselves as
feminist [and] were grappling with
what feminism was about to put pen
to paper to explain that hesitation."
"Every writer had a completely
different construct of what feminism
was and every writer had a different
problem with it."
Walker offered her personal con
ception of feminism.
"Primarily what I think of when I
think of feminism is a movement to
eradicate discrimination based on
difference. To me that means any
kind of difference even though the
movement was originally concerned
with gender discrimination," Walker
said. "For me feminism is taking that
concept and really applying it to a so
cial change movement."
She read several selections from
her book, often interrupting the nar
ratives to offer her own comments
and reflections.
lie fore reading a piece in which a
lesbian expressed discomfort with
some of the cultural assumptions at
tached to the feminist label. Walker
said "one of the things that 1 wanted
to do with this book was to decon
struct all the stereotypes about femi
nists. One of the most prevalent
stereotypes is that all feminists are
lesbians. Since we live in a homopho
bic environment, that's meant to dis

miss the movement."
Walker went on to say that the
practice of making assumptions of
ideological affinity with other people
based on shared biologically-deter
mined attributes like race or sex has
become obsolete.
"Breaking free of identity politics
has given me an awareness of the
ambiguity and complexity of our
world." Walker said.
She suggested that terms "power
ful and powerless, rather than white
and male and black and female,"
were more appropriate in today's so
cial discourse.
"It's much more complex than
oppressor and oppressed, and it's in
that gray area that we need to look
into instead of being stuck in these
rigid, polar relationships," Walker
said.
When asked whether she though
the word feminism was becoming
obsolete, Walker said she is "not
super-attached to the term, but be

fore people jettison it they should
understand that it represents an im
portant body of thought and ideolo
gy. It will always refer to an impor
tant view of the world; I don't think
it's going to disappear."
Another student told Walker that
she had left the Women's Center, be
cause she was "an activist at heart"
and did not believe it was supported
meaningful social activism.
Walker replied that that women's
centers are often "not inclusive
enough, the vision is not radical
enough.
Instead you have isolated groups
who are not doing the most relevant
work that I think needs to be done."
She urged the student to stay at the
Women's Center and help reassess
its priorities and goals.
Herstory continues tomorrow

ford: Get the Inside Story on Apply
ing to Graduate School" in Cypress
Room South in Tresidder at 6 p.m.
