### David Arulantham Staff writer 
Known to most people for his
role as a detective in the popular
Lethal Weapon films, actor and
San Francisco native Danny
Glover revealed a very different
side of his personality as he spoke
to a crowd in Memorial Auditori
um last night.
Mentioning the action series
that brought him fame only in
passing. Glover preferred instead
to talk about community building,
vision and activism in the context
of the academic setting.
In addition to his work as an
actor, director and producer,
Glover has received two NAACP
Image Awards, served as Goodwill

Danny Glover
Ambassador for the U.N. Devel
opment Programme and received
the William Kunstler Racial Jus
tice Award for his efforts to end
apartheid in South Africa.
"Stanford is a world-renowned
university... . You are the bright
est students in America,"he re
marked in the beginning of his


Joanna Hiatt — Daily
speech.
As he discussed the notion of
community building, he empha
sized that "we all know a team
doesn't work when it is all about I.
1,1,1."
He urged students to keep in
mind Maya Angelou's words, "You
came because a lot of people before
you paid for your passage."
Shifting away from theoretical

ideas of teamwork, Glover ad
dressed more imminent problems.
"I'm concerned about what we
choose to remember as a society —
as a community. Bosnia. Kosovo,
Iraq ... or a presidential sex scan
dal? Today our access to informa
tion is greater but we care less
about the world we live in."
He noted that in contrast, the
1960s were a "period in which we
were constantly challenged to
think about who we were in a com
munity."
Glover concluded his remarks

by drawing on the example of the
murder of three American human
rights workers in Colombia, re
marking that "even in the midst of
tragedy there's hope. They had
courage and vision.... the rest of
us are called to sacrifice much less."
Some of those who attended the
speech gave it lukewarm reviews.
"It wasn't quite what I expected.
... As an actor 1 thought he'd he
more engaging," junior Lukeythia
Lumpkin said. "1 wanted to hear
about what he does in social and
political activism, especially talking

about the changes he's made in
south and west Africa."
Others were enthusiastic about
his words, however.
'it was great just because the
whole idea of community building
applies to all peoples of the world,"
junior Tamara Littlesalt said.
"With the amount of publicity he
can bring, he has a powerful role in
sending that message on to us and
reminding us of that."
The event was co-sponsored by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau and
the Black Student Union.
