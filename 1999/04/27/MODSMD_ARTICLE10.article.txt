BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — The head of the
International Committee of the Red Cross met yester
day with three U.S. soldiers held captive by Yugoslavia
but voiced pessimism for chances of their release any
time soon.
Cornelio Somrnaruga, the ICRC president, said a
doctor and a Red Cross delegate would visit the soldiers
today.
The father of Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone — one of
the captive Americans — was thrilled by yesterday's visit
— the first allowed by Yugoslavia since the three sol
diers" capture a month ago.
"That's absolutely wonderful news," said Jim C.
Stone of Avoca. Mich., according to Army spokesman
John Rickey in Fort Knox, Ky.
In Washington, White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart welcomed the visit but criticized Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic for failing to abide by the
Geneva Conventions, which say POWs are entitled to
medical treatment and continued visits without their cap
tors present.
"We think it is good news that they appear in good
condition." he said. "I emphasize the word 'appear.*
because they were not able to speak privately or have

doctors examine the three. ... We will hold Milosevic
personally responsible for their well-being."
The Red Cross had previously been denied access to
the soldiers, who were captured March 31—a week
after NATO began its air campaign against Yugoslavia.
"1 had the occasion to see them and shake their hands,
and I had a short talk with all three," Sommaruga said.
"Further than that... 1 really cannot say. I had no knowl
edge of what they feel. I had no doctor with me to ana
lyze their health."
"The international humanitarian law says prisoners of
war would be liberated only at the end of active hostili
ties," he said. "Regrettably, we are not at this point at the
moment."
Sommaruga, who is Swiss, gave the soldiers letters
from their relatives.
The ICRC president also met yesterday with Milose
vic to discuss the possible return of ethnic Albanian
refugees to Kosovo, the state-run news agency Tanjug
reported. Milosevic was quoted as saying that he will not
discuss the return of refugees while airstrikes continue.
The three Americans being held are Ramirez, 24. of
Los Angeles; Spc. Steven M. Gonzalez, 21. of Huntsville,
Texas; and Stone. 25. of Smiths Creek, Mich.
