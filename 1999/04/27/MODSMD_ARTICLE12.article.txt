Legislation is not
solution to causes of
Colorado tragedy

A WEEK AFTER two young
men took 15 lives including
their own at Columbine High
School, the wounds in Littleton, Colo.,
are far from healed. It will he months,
likely years, before the town can begin
to rebuild.
Across a nation rocked by the
shootings, lawmakers are trying to
start the healing process as soon as
possible. ITiey urge us to look forward,
to move from grief to action, to take
steps to keep such a tragedy from ever
repeating itself.
Their proposed solutions are natu
rally tied to the legislative process.
Democrats are calling for increased
gun control; Republicans look toward
cracking down on violence in movies
and video games and over the Internet.
All sides want to push their policy
positions in the name of bringing jus
tice to the Columbine victims.
A rush to enact that legislation
could do the opposite.
in the wake of the shootings, it is
eajy to Mnmo on a few easily
identifiable targets such as automatic
weapons and 1 lollywood's glorifica
tion of violence. But to restrict them,
or the dissemination of hate speech on
the Internet or the retailing of video
games like Doom and Quake, is only
to treat symptoms of a much deeper
social problem, one that is older than
microchips, firearms or America itself.
Ihere is a pyramid of blame in the
Littleton shootings, one that starts with
the killers at the top — there is no way
to rationalize what they did — and
proceeds down through their parents,
their neo-Nazi influences and the
means by which they illegally obtained
weapons. These are the most culpable,
and they are the easiest to spot.

But there are more culprits. The
American media, from newspapers
and television on down, has played
right into the killers' hands hy giving
their actions the attention the two hoys
wanted. They have become cult heroes
in a twisted way, the Charles Mansons
of the '90s. 'I"heir faces have been
splashed on front pages and across big
screens. TTiey are villainous superstars,
anointed by the press.
At the base of the pyramid is a soci
ety that sets people apart, that ostra
cizes them for being different. Each of
us who has shunned someone for the
way he or she acts or dresses is partial
ly to blame here. We are all members
of a society that, by its exclusionary
nature, drives people to its fringes and
allows them to reinforce themselves
through hate. We are therefore all
guilty, to some degree, for this crime.
We would like to forget that.
We would like to, as our politicians
encourage, legislate and move on. Pass
a few laws restricting gun sales, slap
some more parental warnings on video
games, make an impassioned plea for
ihe film industry to cut down on explo
sions in movies. Maybe those laws will
have positive effects. Most likely they
won't.
llic Columbine tragedy illustrates
social problems that cannot be fixed
through legislation. No law that we
pass today will work tomorrow to stop
a similar event. All legislators can do is
make us feel better about ourselves
and our society by convincing us that
their laws have solved the problem.
The danger is that we will start to
believe them.
Instead of seeking easy solutions to
surface problems, we should challenge
ourselves to look within and work for
the slow, protracted social change that
could someday result in a nation where
high school students don't murder
their classmates.
Only that will bring true justice for
Littleton's victims.
