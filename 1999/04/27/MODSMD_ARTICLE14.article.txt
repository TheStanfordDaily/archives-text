AT ONH point in
the new movie
"The Matrix,"
one character describes
the year 1998 as the high
point of human civiliza
tion, a backhanded com
pliment that drew only a

few scattered chuckles from the theater
audience last week but which eventually
made perfect sense in light of the film's cri
tique of our species' cherished ideal of its
own exceptionalism.
It's an arrogant way of looking at the
world, which begins with willful ignorance
of the environment and filters into more
and more restrictive philosophies — every
thing from national chauvinism to the "not
in my backyard" movement.
Sure, we've managed to slap together the
Pyramids, the Great Wall of China and
Hoover Dam over the course of the past
4,(KK) years, but these impressive achieve
ments aside, it's difficult to put one's linger
on exactly what ought to make us so spe
cial — that is, judging not by our own stan
dards but rather in relation to all those
other fauna and flora with whom we share
our planet. One world view that seems to
combine the worst elements of both human
and national centrism is our diplomatic and
environmental policy.
At the moment, Congress is considering
bills that would open vast stretches of fed
erally owned Alaskan wilderness to oil
exploration and timber logging. Last year,
statutes designed It) increase the amount of
offshore drilling in California were only
barely defeated. The common argument
used to explain the continued survival of
government policies which perpetuate the

degradation of the environment, including
subsidies for programs like "clean coal," are
that American attitudes are so ingrained
that it would be wrong to try to make con
sumers bear undue burdens.
More pragmatic, however, might be an
environmental policy that acknowledges the
negative externalities of those things we take
for granted — low gas prices (well not quite,
at the moment), an efficient and ever
expanding road system, easily available auto
mobiles. In the government's attempts to
postpone implementation of the provisions
of the Kyoto global warming summit, we find
another facet of American exceptionalism —
the practice of trading pollution credits. This
practice allows us to "borrow" other coun
tries' shares of pollution and thereby gain
credit for not exceeding our quota of harm
ful fuel use while doing little to actually
change American habits. Thus, even while
the front-runner for the presidency may talk
about the importance of "Earth in the bal
ance," we continue to focus on policies that
will allow us to retain our comfort level.
As one of my political science professors
put it, Americans — even at the highest lev
els of government — have a foolhardy ten
dency to believe that other people's dis
agreements aren't based on the substance
of what we're saying but rather how we say
it. That is, if only we managed to tell every
one else what they wanted to hear, they'd
fall into line with American goals immedi
ately.
The difficulty of pursuing foreign policy
from this point of view has already become
clear in Kosovo. Other nations are skeptical
of the United States' good intentions — one
Russian politician has said that NATO
intervention is a cover for U.S. imperialist

intentions in southeastern Europe, and
President Clinton's feeble presentation of
our goals has done nothing to ease these
and other similar worries. While the ends —
stopping the forced expulsion of Kosovars
from their homes — may be worthwhile,
few states are willing to trust the United
States with the means, given our history of
covert actions in Chile, Guatemala and
Afghanistan.
We seriously overestimate other nations'
goodwill, and this may undermine U.S.
intentions to serve as a leader, the role it
clearly feels it deserves as the "last super
power." Our politicians today seem to have
learned no good lessons from previous
tragedies caused by confidence in American
superiority, including the decision to wage
war in Vietnam because of an untenable
faith in the need to remain vigilant against
Communism, and the prolonged withdraw
al because of the government's unwilling
ness to admit its misjudgment.
This attitude may be our greatest nation
al tragedy, the flip side of the overweening
optimism that spawned the American
Dream. Our cherished conviction that here,
nothing can go wrong, that old errors will be
smoothed over and our souls made new,
that there can be a second act and a third
and a fourth, has led us into error time and
again. Attempting to whitewash or green
wash our faults may eventually prove to
have caused no relief but rather only tem
porary respite.

Atiba Pertilla, a senior majoring in history,
would like to bet you didn 7 realize so much
meaning could be culled from a Keanu
Reeves film.
