Discipline in pro fro case bad idea
In response to yesterday's article "Pro Fro
sent to hospital," I must say that I strongly
disagree with Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya's assertion that "Cer
tainly in a situation like (this), disciplinary
action needs to be at least considered."
One of the distinguishing and highly posi
tive characteristics of Stanford is its liberal
alcohol policy. Stanford does not use resident
assistants (even in freshman dormitories) as
"alcohol police," as is the case at many other
universities. Instead, Stanford chooses to all
but allow drinking under the assumption that
we are responsible adults who know our lim
its. This engenders a sense of community
where we look out for each other and, if need
be, make sure that other members of the
community receive medical attention.
I have heard horror stories about how,
because RAs arc used as police at other
sch<xMs and because alcohol does have a
huge stigma attached to it, students are
forced to drink themselves into a stupor
behind closed doors. This not only detracts
from the sense of community that students
might otherwise share but also poses a poten
tial health risk. If students are made to feel
that they will get in trouble for drinking, they
are far less likely to call the paramedics or
seek help from their RAs when another stu
dent has consumed an excessive amount of
alcohol. The fact that they must have their

doors shut also removes the possibility that
another person might find a student passed
out on the floor and seek help.
This is not presently the case at Stanford,
but if Montoya chooses — as he appears
ready to — to search out a scapegoat, next
year the students in Branner Hall might not
call 91 1 when they find someone passed out
in the bathroom.

In addition to the usual culprits of violent
video games and movies, many people seem
to be pointing to the murderers' parents
when trying to assess blame for what hap
pened at Columbine I ligh School last Tues
day.
After all, one of the kids allegedly had
guns sitting out on the llix>r of his bedroom.
While video games, movies and parents may
have contributed to the result, they are more
symptomatic than causal. We need to look
beyond them to some of the fundamental,
structural problems in this country that creat
ed the possibility for this scenario to occur. In
particular, taxes and gun control.
This country's failure to enact significant
gun control legislation is a disgrace. Last
year, gun deaths in this country were more
than double those of every other industrial
ized nation in the world COMBINED —

and every single one of those countries does
not allow its citizens to possess guns. Figures
of this magnitude have been around for
years, and yet the National Rifle Associa
tion's stronghold on legislators' poeketbooks
keeps meaningful gun control legislation
from being enacted. I'he Constitutional Con
vention did not envision high school students
shooting one another or other more common
incidents of gun deaths such as drive-by
shootings, in the right to bear arms.
In addition, we need to lower marginal tax
rates so that American families do not need
to have both parents working to make ends
meet. ITiis is not a call for women to be bare
foot and pregnant. On the contrary, it is a call
for parents, both men and women, to be able
to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of
both parents working and choose which one
works best for them.
Instead, the government has made this
choice for many American families through a
repressive tax system. This contributes signif
icantly to dysfunctional families and a lack of
participation by parents in their childrens'
lives, resulting in children who are more sus
ceptible to the temptations of violence in our
society.
As 1 look to Congress, there is plenty of
blame on both sides of the aisle. Republicans
refuse to detach themselves from the NRA's
money nipple and Democrats fail to realize
the impact of the increasing tax burden they
place on this nation's workers.
Censure is not the answer. Get the guns

off the streets and have a system of govern
ment that doesn't require half of our pay
checks to fund it. Maybe then this country
can focus on what Littleton showed us to be
most important — our children.

Diversions piece was distasteful
I don't question The Daily's right to print
what it wants, and our prominent and suc
cessful outgoing provost, Condoleezza
Rice — or any authority around here — is of
course fair game for humor and criticism
(I've disagreed with her passionately on
tenure cases and other matters).
But anyone can see that yesterday's
Diversions "letter" purportedly satirizes her
as a vicious, nasty little screed of sexist and
racist hate speech. I'd prefer to ignore it, but
I find I can't, because the words, on reflec
tion, are not only disgusting but, if not clear
ly recognized for what they are, dangerous:
The writer, feeling righteous, resorts to
attacking and making a big point of Rice's
black and female identity.
It's not acceptable — not funny — to race
bait and gender bait people. Maybe someone
at The Daily might want to apologize.
