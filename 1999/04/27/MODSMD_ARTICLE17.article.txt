### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
Twelve American journalists,
with interests including environmen
tal science and Middle Eastern stud
ies, were awarded John S. Knight Fel
lowships yesterday for the 1999-2(XX)
academic year.
The fellows will be on campus dur
ing the next school year to take class
es and participate in seminars. This is
the 34th group of professional jour
nalists to be offered fellowships at
Stanford.
Next year's fellows include inves
tigative reporters, bureau chiefs, pro
ducers and editors. The fellows also
represent a diverse geographical
background, including Alaska and
South America.
The fellows this year will be
Katherine Ellison from Knight Rid
der Newspapers, Veronica Flores
from the San Antonio Express-
News, Robin Gianattassio-Malle
from San Francisco's KQED-FM,
George Haj from the Miami Herald,
Thaddeus I lerrick from the Houston
Chronicle, Tom Kizzia from the An
chorage Daily News, Sean Murphy
from the Boston Globe, Kim Nor

gaard from CNN, Eric Pryne from
the Seattle Times, Theo Stein from
the Berkshire Eagle, Kevin Sullivan
from the Washington Post and Sarah
T. Williams from the Minneapolis
Star Tribune.
Six international journalists will
also be awarded Knight fellowships
next month.
Communication Prof. James V.
Risser, the program's director, said
the fellows "get to take a year off to
study, reflect and gain additional
knowledge in their fields."
The fellows went through a com
petitive application process and were
selected from more than HO appli
cants. Kisser said applicants must ex
plain their careers in journalism and
outline what they wish to study at the
University. "Each applicant," Risser
said, "has a different area to study."
Program Deputy Director James
R. Bettinger said the applicants were
chosen based on three main criteria.
First, the applicants must be accom
plished in their careers.
"We are not looking for prospec
tive talent," Bettinger said.
Second, each applicant must have
serious ambition in his or her field.
Third, an applicant must have the in

telligence and flexibility to take full
advantage of a year at Stanford.
According to Bettinger, there are
many reasons why journalists pick
Stanford over other fellowship pro
grams, such as the Nieman Fellow
ship at Harvard and the National
Arts Journalism Program at Colum
bia. Among the most important are
the opportunity to live in California,
the access that Stanford provides to
the technology of information and
proximity and expertise on issues on
the Pacific Rim.
Professional journalism fellow
ships began at Stanford in 1%6 with a

grant from the Ford Foundation. Of
the more than 6(X) journalists who
have held fellowships at Stanford, 80
percent are still involved in gathering,
editing or disseminating news. Stan
ford fellows have won 20 Pulitzer
Prizes and numerous other major
print and broadcast awards.
John S. Knight Fellowships are
awarded to distinguished American
journalists with the hope of improv
ing the quality and information in the
news media, both print and broad
cast. Funding for the fellowships
conies primarily from the John S. and
James L. Knight Foundation.
