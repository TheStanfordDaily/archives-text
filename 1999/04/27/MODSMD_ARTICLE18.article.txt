### Jad Fakhry Contributing writer 
Douglas Lawrence, professor emeritus of psy
chology. died last Tuesday in Medford. Ore. He
was 81. Lawrence helped lead the way for experi
ments in cognitive psychology and spent much of
his life at Stanford.
"His major achievement was a series of the
most elegant experiments in discrimination learn
ing," Psychology Prof. Albert I lastorf said. "These
experiments really began the cognitive learning
revolution in psychology" in the late '60s and early
"70s.
Lawrence's work centered on rodent experi
ments that focused on how animals perceive their
surroundings. Hastorf noted that Lawrence "be
came a very early supporter of cognitive ap
proaches to learning behavior." Lawrence co
wrote a book on the subject, "Deterrence and Re
inforcement," with social psychologist Leon Fes
tinger.
Hastorf said Lawrence was an "extraordinarily
decent, honest and straightforward person."

In 1949 Lawrencc came to Stanford as an assis
tant professor. He became a lull professor in 1956
and retired in 1977, remaining at Stanford as a pro
fessor emeritus. He lived on campus until the Fri
day before he passed away. Lawrence and his wife,
Mary Brown Lawrence, were known for their lav
ish Christmas parties.
Psychology Prof. Albert Bandura said, "Doug
wrote brilliant papers lhat showed how people
code events rather than mechanically respond to
them.
Gordon Bower, a psychology professor, was
impressed by the depth of Lawrence's work. "He
was able to show in his early work the importance
of attention even in lower animals. You can train
the lowly rat to be sensitive to difference in bright
ness or shape or size of a figure, and, having
learned to respond to differences in size, for ex
ample, the rat will transfer that to new situations
where size is of a different scale."
Bower also said Lawrence was integral in ad
vancing the notion that learning is an "easy-to
hard transfer problem."
I lastorf said. "His major impact to the depart-

ment was standing four square for intellectual ad
vancement in terms of appointment and promo
tion decisions."
Lawrence was also in charge of the remodeling
of Jordan Hall when it became the psychology de
partment in 1969. The design has long been ad
mired for its adaptability.
Lawrence also shined as a wood craftsman and
golf player. "He was a wonderful home craftsman,
and he helped his neighbors out a lot," Hastorf
said. He also said that his neighbors would proba
bly remember Lawrence for helping them fix a
fence or a piece of furniture.
Lawrence retired in 1977 and had been in
volved with other passions including Go, a highly
mathematical board game. He went to Japan and
studied the game under a master for an entire year.
"Whatever Doug did. he took on with a pas
sion," Bandura added. He called Lawrence a real
"Renaissance man."
Lawrence is survived by his wife, his brother
William, five nieces and five nephews.
"All in all he was an absolutely decent man and
an absolutely elegant experimenter," Hastorf said.
