## Water polo prevails at regionals 
### Mo Eger Contributing writer 
The No. 4 Stanford women's water polo team (22-
5) beat No. 1 California (24-5) in the finals of the
Northern California Regional Qualifier this past
weekend at Pacific, 4-3. to ensure the Cardinal a trip
to UC-Davis for the Collegiate Nationals, May 7-9, as
well a better seed in that tournament.
Stanford has a 3-2 season record against Cal and
might very well see the Bears in the National semifi
nals. The two teams have a long history of not only
school rivalry but intense competition in the context
of water polo. Cal and Stanford have met in the semi
finals or finals of a considerable number of tourna
ments over the past four years, and this season's close
record proves that anything could happen in this next
crucial matchup.
"Nationals will be very emotional," said Stanford
head coach John Tanner. "There are a number of
great teams out there and it will be interesting to see
what happens."

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
â– Today: No. 4 Stanford (22-5) 4, No. 1 California (24-
5)3.

The first game of the qualifying tournament
demonstrated the amount of talent and the number of
quality teams that will be participating in upcoming
National Championship. In Stanford's first game, the
team took on No. 8 UC-Davis (22-10) and managed a
3-2 overtime win when freshman Margie Dingeldein
scored during sudden-death play. Stanford had not
expected such a close game, having already beat Davis
once this season, but the Aggies came out hard and
made the Cardinal fight for the win.
"We thoroughly outplayed Davis," said Tanner.
"But if you don't score it doesn't matter."
Saturday's second game was not even close. The
Cardinal beat unranked Cal State-Bakersfield (16-18)
19-6. Nine of the 11 field players contributed to the
Cardinal's high score.
The big game of the weekend was definitely Sun
day's match against Cal.
"The last time we played Cal [at the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation Championship semifinals],
they had complete control of the game," said Henry.
"This time we changed to a more aggressive defense
and a cross-passing offense, which resulted in our
completely controlling the game.."
"We were catatonic the last time we played Cal,"
said Tanner. "The mobility and energy that we
brought to this game in the first quarter made them
back up and reevaluate their own game. Scoring three
goals in the first period established the pace of game
early."
"Beating Cal and having control of that game real
ly gives us the momentum we need to carry over into
nationals," said sophomore Ali Riddell. "The kind of
water polo we played against Cal is the kind that we
are going to need to play in order to win nationals."
