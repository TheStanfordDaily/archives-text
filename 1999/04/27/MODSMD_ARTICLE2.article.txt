## Disciplinary action possible, Montoya says 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
University officials gathered yesterday morning to
discuss what disciplinary action will be taken following
two alcohol-related incidents involving prospective
freshmen this past weekend, one of which sent a high
school student to Stanford Hospital.
"We will continue our investigation to determine
what particular steps need to be taken, in part as it relates
to disciplinary action," said Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya. who called the meeting.
Paramedics were called to Branner Hall early Satur
day morning when a prospective freshman lost con
sciousness after drinking heavily. She was transported to
the hospital, where she was treated and released.
The incident at Branner was not the only instance of
a prospective freshman drinking to excess this weekend,
however. On Friday, another prospective freshman be
came sick after drinking too much. Residents of Rin
conada helped the 17-year-old man. who was staying
with a room host in Faisan.
"People just nursed him toastate of semi-health," res-

ident assistant Akhi Sista said. Resi
dent fellow Greg Beroza emphasized
that the prospective freshman was not
served alcohol in Rinconada.
According to freshman house host
Lisa Swafford, Residence Dean Lisa
Webb and Admit Weekend coordina
tor Holly 1 laley Knapp were called to
the Rinconada lounge at about 2:30
a.m. on Saturday. The brother of the

prospective freshman, a graduate student at Stanford, ar
rived around 4:30 a.m.
"I'm not upset at anyone else," said the brother. "It's
entirely his fault."
Alrondra resident assistant Jit Bhattacharya criti
cized the fact that RAs in Florence Moore Hall were not
given any information about the prospective freshmen
staying in their residences, saying it made it difficult for
resident assistants to look after the visitors.
Junior Bobby Ferrario, one of six Admit Weekend
coordinators, said that e-mails listing the names and
room hosts of prospective freshmen were sent out to
RAs, staff and head house hosts, who were to inform res
idence staff of the visitors.
Troy Gilbert, assistant to Montoya, attended today's
meeting. He said that the focus of the meeting was on two
incidents, although he acknowledged that a significant
amount of alcohol was present tin campus last weekend.
"Our hope was that alcohol would not be served at
student-sponsored activities in recognition that [for.
many prospective freshman] it was their 112 irst experience
away from home." Montoya said.
"This is the first situation of which I am aware where
a pro fro was sent to Stanford Hospital as a result of ex
cessive drinking," Montoya said. "This is not a common
experience."
