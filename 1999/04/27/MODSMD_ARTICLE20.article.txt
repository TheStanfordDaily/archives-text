## 
### Ben Jones Contributing writer 
They knew it was coming. It was
just a matter of time.
And for the members of the
Stanford women's golf team, they
couldn't have picked a better mo
ment to find the hot streak that has
eluded them much of the season.
The lOth-ranked Cardinal cap
tured its first tournament title of the
season in winning the Pacific 10
Conference Championships this
weekend at the Stanford Golf
Course.
Behind a season-low score of 876
for the three-round event, the Car
dinal defeated two-time defending
conference champion Arizona by 12
strokes.
The win was a huge achievement
for Stanford as four of the nation's
top 10 teams and nine teams in the
top 35 were in the field.
"We have been working really
hard, and our work finally paid off,"
said sophomore Stephanie Keever.
Stanford opened with a 291 on
the 6,154-yard, par-72 layout to take
a five-stroke advantage over USC,
placing three golfers in the top five
of the individual standings.
The host Cardinal followed this
performance with a solid one-over
par 289 in the second round to open
a 14-stroke lead over Arizona and
USC.
With a final-round 296. Stanford
claimed the conference crown.
Two-time defending NCAA
champion Arizona State finished
third in the event at 893. UCLA and
USC rounded out the top five at 899
and 901. respectively.
The Cardinal was led by Keever
and fellow sophomore Hilary
Uomeyer as well as junior Julie
Dunn, who all finished in the top 10
of the individual stafidjr|gS|. v
1 Jomeyer carded rounds of 7 L 74
and 71 to finish alone in second
place at even-par (216).

Keever, ranked eighth in the na
tion, finished one stroke behind her
teammate at 217 in a tie for third
place with Jennifer Rosales of USC
and Giulia Sergas of UCLA.
But the biggest surprise for the
Cardinal was the play of Dunn, who
fired a tournament-low score of 69
in the second round to hold the indi
vidual lead going into the final
round. Despite falling back to an 80
in the third round to finish in ninth
place, Dunn's stellar play was in
strumental in Stanford's win.

"I'm extremely happy with the
way I played over the three days,"
Dunn said.
Grace Park of Arizona State, one
of the nation's top female amateur
golfers, captured the individual
crown with a score of 211 to top
Homeyer by five strokes.
Rounding out the scoring for the
Cardinal were Michelle Sperry, who
finished in a tie for 16th at 226, and
JaeJean Ro who finished 39th at
236.
Sophomore Jessica Belskis, play
ing as an individual and without her
score counting toward the team
total, carded a three-day total of 235
to finish tied for 35th.
The event was a strong team ef
fort for the Stanford squad. In previ
ous tournaments the team had diffi
culty posting a series of good scores
throughout the five positions.
Things were markedly different
this weekend as all five players
made solid contributions to the
team score.
"Every single person contributed
to this win." Keever said. "I think we
finally we proved,
everyone else that we can stand up
