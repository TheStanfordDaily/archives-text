The No. l() men's tennis team had a
successful weekend at the Pacific 10
Championships in Ojai, Calif., as the Car
dinal came away with the "unofficial"
Thatcher Cup. an honor given to the team
that gains the most points through their
players' performances in singles and dou
bles draws.
In addition to the Thatcher Cup. senior
leader Ryan Wolters won the individual
singles title, adding his name to a long list

of tennis greats. Wolters had lost in the fi
nals of t he singles t lie previous two years at
Ojai and had not won a singles title since
freshman year, so the win was extra spe
cial.

MEN'S TENNIS
â–  Thursday-Sunday: Stanford won Pacific
10 ( on fere nee I itlesin the Main Draw Sin
gles. Main Draw Doubles and Invitational
Doubles.

"I vven though the Pac 1 0 tourney is not
as important as the upcoming NCAAs. it

still feels great," Wolters said. "I won two
titles early in my freshman year and since
then have come close a bunch of times, but
I was finally able to pull it out again at
Ojai. It was really a good time for it too,
inv senior year and also leading right into
the N( 'A As in a couple of weeks."
Wolters' road to the championship was
a difficult one, but he was able to come out
strong and establish confidence right from
the beginning of each match. In his first
round match he played Oregon's No. 1
player, Bert rand Devillers, who had a
good forehand and came out fighting.

Wolters was able to pull out a close first set
6-4, however, and then his opponent lost
his rhythm in the second set.
In the semifinals Wolters took on Jeff
Williams of Arizona State. Wolters had an
opportunity to finish Williams off in a first
set tiebreaker but ended up losing that set
7-6. He remained calm, though, and
breezed by the next two sets. 6-1.6-0.
Wolters then faced Arizona State's top
player. Gustavo Marcaccio, who had just
defeated Stanford junior Geoff Abrams in
the semifinals. Wolters had already
beaten Marcaecio two times this
year by scores ol 7-6,6-4 and 6-2,6-0,
so he was confident that he knew his
opponent well enough to take
charge of the match. 1 le also knew,
however, that Mareaccio would look
lor revenge.
One break was all it took in the
Inst set as Wolters held serve every
game and won 6-4. In the second set,
Wolters came out strong and took a
5 I lead. The match looked to be
over until Mareaccio rallied behind
l lie fans who wanted to see a third set
and fought back to 5-4. Wolters was
able to hold the game and take the
championship 6-4,6-4.
"I was very nervous goingintomy
5-4 service game," Wolters said. "He
was on a huge role and I knew I had
to finish it then. Luckily it hap
pened."
Stanford assistant coach John
Whitlinger and head coach Dick
(iould both agree that Wolters de
served the title:
"I am very happy for Ryan,"
Whitlinger said. "He deserved it
altei being .i finalist the last two
years, lie played smart tennis and
aggressively and this is a very nice
title for liini toget in his senior year."
In addition to Wolters, the rest of
the Cardinal players put in strong
performances in the singles but were
not quite as happy with their doubles
results. UCLA doubles teams

seemed to wipe oul the entire Cardi
nal squad.
In the singles semifinals, Abrams
lost to Mareaccio 6-4. 6-4. He had
numerous break point opportunities
but was not able to convert on the
big points. No. 3 singles player fresh
man K.J. Hippensteel lost to IJSC's
No. I player, Patrick Gottesleban 6-
3, 6-3. Sophomore Alex Kim lost in
the quarterfinals to Arizona State's
Jeff Williams 6-1, 6-3. Kim played
well in his first two matches but
didn't have enough to get past
Williams.
In the doubles side of the draw,
Kim and Abrams lost to UCLA's
Jason Cook and Brandon Kramer
8-1. 'I'hey had just defeated Cook
and Kramer X-2 in a dual match, but
they got oil to a slow start and could
never recover. Wolters and Hip
pensteel lost to UCLA's team of
Jean-Noel (irinda and Jog Min Lee
in the quarterfinals. Their 9-7 score
was almost identical to their l )-N loss
to (irinda and Lee two weekends
ago.
In the Invitational Tournament,
No. 5 singles player Scotty Scott lost
in the quarterfinals to UCLA's
Marcin Ro/pdeski.
Sophomore Ali Ansari was also
defeated by Kramer 6-3,3-6,7-5. Ju
nior David Hauscr lost in the first
round to Joaquin Harndan from
()regon. 6-2.6-2.
On the doubles side, Scott and

to the Bruins. They were defeated by
UCLA's team of Ro/pdeski and
Chris Sands in the finals.
