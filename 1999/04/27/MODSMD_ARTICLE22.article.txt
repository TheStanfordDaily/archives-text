# Men earn fifth in San Diego
## Field eventers also perform well at Drake 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
It was supposed to be a down
weekend for Stanford track and
field. Most of the team was left at
home to rest while short squads were
sent to the Drake Relays in Des
Moines, lowa, and the California
State Championship meet in San
Diego.
But for the Cardinal, down does
not necessarily mean out. Stanford
turned in a number of solid perfor
mances at Drake and placed fifth out
of 22 teams in San Diego to prove
that the Cardinal can never be
counted out.
With the distance ranks either at
Drake or back home, the task of big
point production was left to the
Stanford field-eventers. They did
not disappoint.
Junior Toby Stevenson cleared
the winning height of 17 feet, 10 1/2
inches in the pole vault, but was
awarded second place based on
number of attempts.
Freshman standout Michael
Ponikvar showed that he is ready to
compete on the national level with
his 7-1 3/4 leap for second place in
the high jump, and sophomore
teammate Todd Beyerlein was not
far behind at 6-8 1/2.

"Seven feet. 1 3/4 inches was a big
jump for Michael," said Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna. "We're
pleased to see that he's coming
around — big things are coming up
for him."
Mark Ganek and Chad Wassink
were the stars of the day for Stanford
in the throws.
Ganek's third-place showing in
the hammer throw and fifth-place
mark in the discus tallied a total of 10
points for the Stanford cause.
His toss of 183-8 in the discus was
a personal best, while his 201-2 ham
mer throw is on par with his string of
strong marks posted throughout the
year.
Wassink matched Ganek's point
total, capturing first place in the
javelin with a throw of 199-8.
"Another big performer for us
was Michael Harte." Lananna said.
"We expected him to do well in the
[ 110-meter] hurdles, but he really
did a great job for us in the KM) me
ters as well."
Harte posted solid marks in both
events, racing to third place in the
hurdles at 14.41 seconds and grab
bing seventh-place honors in the
100-meter dash (10.76 finals, 10:74
preliminaries) as well.
Stanford scored a total of 53
points with only 10 athletes compet

ing in San Diego. California was first
with 138.
Back in Dcs Moines, the other
batch of Cardinal tracksters was not
to be showed up. Playing toa packed
stadium of more than 15.0 CX) fans for
each of the meet's two days, Stan
ford captured fourth place in the dis
tance-medlev relay and fifth in the
3,200-meter relay to cap off a strong
weekend of action.
Jon Weldon ran the 1,200-meter
leadofflegol the medley for the Car
dinal. handing off to freshman Ryan
Meuse for the 400-meter portion of
the race. Ryan C arroll raced the 800-
meter leg. and Jake Maas scaled the
performance with the 1,600-meter
final stretch.
Stanford finished in nine min
utes. 47.10 seconds, less than seven
seconds behind champion Arizona.
Freshman Logan Taylor re
placed Weldon for the 3.2(H) squad,
which finished in 7:29.37.
Senior Jeff Allen placed eighth in
the invite-only 400-meter hurdles at
52.71, and freshmen Daniel Parris
and Jesse Thomas placed ninth
(14:42.07) and 12th (14:51.56), re
spectively, in the 5,000 meters.
Lananna, who opted to miss the
Penn Relays for the first time in 30
years in favor of Drake, said the
meet was a positive experience.
"Drake was a great meet,"
Lananna said. "There was a
packed crowd — 17.000 people
Friday and 18,000 Saturday. At
Drake, there is ;i great apprecia
tion for competition and pure ath

leticism."
Lananna indicated that Stanford
may choose Drake over Penn again
if the conditions are favorable.
"We were kind of testing the wa
ters this year to see if Drake was a
meet we would seriously pursue in
future years," Lananna said
"(Drake) was a great experience for
me. and I'm starting to think that we
will strongly consider it in the fu
ture."
