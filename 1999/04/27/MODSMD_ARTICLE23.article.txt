# Divided, the Card do not perform well as a whole
## Throwers set new personal bests 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
I he Stanford women's track
team finished ninth out of 21 teams
this weekend at the
California / Nevada Track and 112 ield
Championships. Compared to
I JCLA's winning point total of 198,
llie ('ardinal mustered just 48 points.
Yet it was a great meet.
Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na did not send his team to the Uni
veisitv of San Diego with the inten
tion of scoring well as a team as lie
sent his distance runners to Des
•Moines. lowa, for the Drake Relays.
The athletes in San Diego were
there for individual performances.
Leading the way for Stanford was
the throwing squad. While it ap
peared two weekends ago at the.
Pomona-Pitzer Invitational that this
group had reached a plateau in its
performances, its marks this week
end proved it is still very much on the
rise.
Junior Maureen Onyeagbako
showed the greatest improvement of
all the athletes, besting her personal
record by more than eight feet to es
tablish a new school record of 189
feet, four inches in the hammer
throw. Her mark, which replaced
Carol Cady's record set in 1984, was

good enough for second behind
UCLA's Seilala Sua's throw of 192-
4.
"1 did a lot of speed work last
week. I have the technique down
and I just need to speed everything
up," Onyeagbako said. "Also, my
coach |Robert Weir] and [men's Ail-
American thrower] Adam Connolly
have been giving me helpful mental
tips and suggestions."
Onyeagbako's mark falls just
short of the 193-7 automatic qualify
ing standard and leaves her on the
bubble of getting into the field at this
June's NCAAs.
Also just missing an automatic
mark was junior discus thrower
Summer Pierson. Her personal best
throw of 181-3 was good for second,
again behind UCLA's Sua, last
year's national champion. Pierson's
performance should ensure her a
third-straight invitation to the na
tional meet.
TTie sprints were highlighted with
improvement rather than national
marks.
Continuing her excellent season,
junior Jayna Smith ran a personal
best of 24.36 seconds in the 2(X)-
meter prelims on Saturday and then
returned Sunday for a seventh-place
finish in the final. After setting a
school record two weeks ago in the

4(H). she was lowered to the 2(X) again
for work on speed.
"I think the biggest factor [in my
success] has been my sprint training.
Coach Edrick [Floreal] has been
working us really hard in turnover
work and other speed drills," said
Smith.
Smith also does not feel much
pressure racing the 2(K).
"The 200 is definitely less stress
ful. Nine times out of 10.1 will be the
only quarter-miler competing in a
field of 200-meter runners," said
Smith.
In the 100 meters, Wilsa Charles
demonstrated her consistent run
ning with a personal best of 11.86 in
the prelims and then a 12.06 in the fi
nals for seventh place.
Far from sunny California at the
Drake Relays, a small squad of mid
dle-distance runners ran good races
in both the distance medley and the
3.200-meter relays.
In the distance medley on Friday,
the Cardinal aimed to take out the
Oregon team, as it had done so at the
Hayward Relays earlier this month.
Yet, with Oregon switching its order
and leading off with Ail-American
Marie Davis, Stanford couldn't keep
pace.

"Mary did a great job in the S(K)-

baton, she \s ;is 100 lar behind to catch
anyone." said I .ananna.
'Che Cardinal finished third.
Oregon prevailed in the 3.2(H)-
nieter relay as well, but the race was
much more exciting.

After .1 strong leg by Colleen Fla
herty. Cobb ran a personal best split
of 2:10. Maurica Carlucci followed
with a solid 2:12. but when she hand
ed off to Pace, Stanford was off the
front pack.
"LaShawndra came up and made
a valiant effort," said Lananna.
•'( )regon was in the lead and the only
way we could beat them, by the time
LaShawndra got the baton, was with
a real aggressive effort. She went
after it and tried to pass the leader
with 3(X) meters to go but faded
down the last straightaway to fourth
place."
