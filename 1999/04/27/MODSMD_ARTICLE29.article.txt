# Players defeat coach in spring game
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
A player's dream — to chal
lenge his coach on the field.
The Stanford men's soccer team
had this opportunity Saturday in its
first game of the spring season, as it
took on assistant coach Geoff

Wheeler and the San Francisco
Scots.
And the Cardinal earned the
bragging rights with its 3-2 victory.
"1 wanted to see them do well,
but I can't say I was happy about
the result. I think a draw would
have been a better outcome,"
Wheeler joked after the game.

Stanford was originally sched
uled to take on the Silicon Valley
Ambassadors, but the Ambas
sadors were unable to play due to
injuries.
Instead, Stanford faced the
Scots, an amateur men's team com
prised of ex-Division I and II col
lege players. Many of the Scots
have played professionally in ei
ther the United States or abroad.
The match was the first oppor
tunity for the young Cardinal
squad to take the field without last
season's seniors.

"It was an excellent way to
start," said Stanford head coach
Bobby Clark. "It gave us a look at
some of the players who are going
to be filling some big shoes."
The departure of six seniors, in
cluding All-Americans Jamie
Clark and Simon Elliott, has in
deed left some gaps that will need
to be filled.
Stanford also took the field Sat
urday without Final Four All-
Tournament team member and
freshman defender Lee Morrison,
who has been playing with the US
National Under-20 squad at the
Youth World Cup in Nigeria.
Taking the places of Morrison
and Jamie Clark at the central back
positions were juniors Chris Gores
and Andy Hemmerich.
Hemmerich made his presence
felt, scoring the tying goal and set
ting up the game-winner.
With the score tied at two. Hem

merich brought the ball up the left
side and passed it to senior mid
fielder T.K. Inbody. Inbody cen
tered the ball and sophomore mid
fielder Scott Leber dove and, from
mid-air, headed the ball to the back
of the net for a picture-perfect goal.
Leber is playing where Elliott
started for the last two years, and
filling the other hole in the middle
for Shan Gaw is junior Gerard
Davis.
The most noticeable difference
from the 1998 squad was the
game's five total goals. During the
season, the Cardinal scored more
than two goals only six times, and
allowed two or more only twice.
"Saturday's game could be a
good reflection of the future Stan
ford team," Wheeler said. "Not
only did they score more goals,
they also conceded more goals than
they normally do."
The statement is credible com
ing from Wheeler, who not only
coached the Cardinal last season,
but played defense against the
squad yesterday.
Also providing constant offen
sive pressure were sophomore
Corey Woolfolk and freshman
Michael Murphv.
"I realized how fast Corey and
Murphy are up top," Wheeler said.
"They certainly weren't taking it
easy on their old coach."
And though the Cardinal can
feel good about its victory, Hobby
Clark put the match in the larger
perspective.
"It is always nice to win. but that
is not the main objective of spring
games," Bobby Clark said. "It is to
get everybody on and also try to
find out a little bit about yourself."
