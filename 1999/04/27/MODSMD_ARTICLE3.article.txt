# Row guidelines in place
## Financial managers use new software, auditing procedures 
### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
When Jeremy Smith was arrested
nearly a year ago for embezzling
more than $2().(XX) from Casa Ital
iana, the Office of Residential Edu
cation decided that new guidelines
had to he implemented to prevent fi
nancial managers from squandering
house funds on personal expenses.
Smith, the financial manager for
Casa Italiana. has since pleaded no
contest to felony charges. Over the
course of two quarters, police say
Smith took $23,877 out of the house's
reserve, money held over from previ
ous quarters to cover house expenses
at the beginning of the new year.
Res Ed officials have now imple

mented new guidelines for financial
managers, and this sort of crime
should not be able to happen again,
according to Assistant Director of
Student Management Laurette Bee
son. Financial managers also call
these new rules a success. Yet not all
believe Res Ed is capable of stopping
determined Stanford thieves.
New finance rules created
Prior to the Smith case. Res Ed
had heard rumors of other incidences
of financial mismanagement on the
Row, but it had never been called
upon to formally investigate them.
However both Beeson and Ann
Porteus, who is the associate director
of Res Ed, had begun to gather infor
mation about the Row. They had al
ready started to develop guidelines
and expectations for finances when
the Smith case broke.

The case prompted them to ap
proach all of the financial managers
during the winter of IWS to see how
they were managing their finances.
Beeson then presented them with the
guidelines and asked if they would be
willing to abide by them. All consent
ed, and the guidelines were imple
mented this year.
"I wanted to do this to make peo
ple better stewards of the money stu
dents were putting in their hands,"
Beeson said.
The new guidelines for financial
managers require managers to have
canceled checks returned with bank
statements, have deposit-only ATM
cards, use Quickbooks accounting
software (which the Row office
bought for them and trained them to
use) have someone in their house
conduct an internal audit every quar
ter and be prepared for Beeson to
conduct random audits throughout
the year
"It is essential that financial man
agers use sound accounting practices
and regularly share information with
residents so that students may be as
sured that their money is being spent
for intended purposes, within the
house budget and in accordance with
the wishes of the house residents,"
Beeson said.
"I'm glad more strict rules are in
place now, because it was really easy
for the financial manager to be vague
about stuff last year," said Grove La
suen resident Ines Barbosa,a sociolo
gy coterminal student.

"l didn't think any of the new re
quirements were unreasonable at all;
1 think they're good, because they're
providing a real-life experience to
students," said junior Katie Stokes, fi
nancial manger at 553 Mayfield.
Though Beeson did not conduct
any audits this year, she has heard
no reports of financial mismanage
ment from people who have con
ducted internal audits in the various
houses.
Prior to the incident at Casa Ital
iana. Res Ed had made suggestions to
financial managers about how they
should run their houses, but it had no
formal system for regulating their be
havior.
Whereas students in dormitories
pay the University for their board,
meal plan and special fees, students
living in row houses only pay board
money to the University. They pay
money directly to their houses for
fees and food. Housed fraternities
and sororities pay board directly to
their houses as well.
Row houses thus select financial
mangers to handle all financial affairs
and to ensure that all house financial
obligations are met in an honest, fair
and fiscally sound manner.
Some of their responsibilities in
clude keeping clear records of all
income and expenditures. They
must report frequently to the house
about its financial status and the
payment of bills, keeping records
of bill payment so as to keep ac
counts balanced and the house fi
nancially sound.
"I think a unique feature of the
Row is that students are able to man
age their own finances," said senior

Amar Arora, a resident of Grove
Mayfield.
Rules may not be foolproof
Beeson said that the only way in
which financial mismanagement
could occur now is if the person con
ducting the internal audit is dishon
est. Still some students say you
shouldn't underestimate Stanford
students' ingenuity.
"I'd like to think better of Stan
ford students, but I think there are a
lot of ways in which financial mis
management could occur. Because
the system places an immense
amount of trust in the financial man
agers," Stokes said.
"I think there's a possibility for
[mismanagement] to happen again
seeing that we're all intelligent here
and could figure out how to get
around the system," said junior Alli
son McGowen, a former financial
manager of the Delta Delta Delta
house. 1 lowever she was quick to say
that she wouldn't be dipping into Tri
Delt funds. "I would never even think
to do that," McGowen said.
Beeson went on to add that she
currently has no plans to further im
prove the system.
McGowen agreed with the deci
sion. She said, "They've done what
they can with what they have to work
with. They've done all they can with
out taking away our freedom."
When asked what she thought it
took to be a financial manager,
sophomore Erin Schmidt, who will
be the financial manager in Phi Sig
next year, said, "1 think it comes
down to having a sense of how re

sponsible this person is with their own
finances, with taking care of things on
a timely matter — finding someone
who will make sure that money mat
ters will run smoothly."
The Smith case
The system based on trust and
honesty seemed to be effective until
Jeremy Smith became financial man
ager of Casa Italiana in January 1997.
He consistently stole money from
the house during winter and spring
quarter that year and may have had
the opportunity to continue do so
through the fall had he not unexpect
edly left Stanford.
When he left, Amanda Bardin,
Class of '98, assumed his position. She
noticed irregularities in the house's fi
nances and contacted Beeson.
Beeson then contacted the police
when Smith refused to turn over the
house records to her. They discov
ered that Smith had co-mingled the
house's money with his own account
in order to cover personal expenses
such as a $750 purchase from GTE
Mobilnet and purchases from Bache
lor Books, a pornography shop in
Redwood City.
Police arrested him on May 5,
199H, and on March 11 of this year, he
arrived at his sentencing with a check
for $23,877, the amount he had em
bezzled from Casa Italiana.
If the current residents of Casa
Italiana approve, Beeson intends to
divide this money among the stu
dents who lived in the house when
Smith was financial manager, be
cause he never sent them their refund
checks.
