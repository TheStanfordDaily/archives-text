# Row guidelines in place
## Financial managers use new software, auditing procedures 
### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
When Jeremy Smith was arrested
nearly a year ago for embezzling
more than $2().(XX) from Casa Ital
iana, the Office of Residential Edu
cation decided that new guidelines
had to he implemented to prevent fi
nancial managers from squandering
house funds on personal expenses.
Smith, the financial manager for
Casa Italiana. has since pleaded no
contest to felony charges. Over the
course of two quarters, police say
Smith took $23,877 out of the house's
reserve, money held over from previ
ous quarters to cover house expenses
at the beginning of the new year.
Res Ed officials have now imple

mented new guidelines for financial
managers, and this sort of crime
should not be able to happen again,
according to Assistant Director of
Student Management Laurette Bee
son. Financial managers also call
these new rules a success. Yet not all
believe Res Ed is capable of stopping
determined Stanford thieves.
New finance rules created
Prior to the Smith case. Res Ed
had heard rumors of other incidences
of financial mismanagement on the
Row, but it had never been called
upon to formally investigate them.
However both Beeson and Ann
Porteus, who is the associate director
of Res Ed, had begun to gather infor
mation about the Row. They had al
ready started to develop guidelines
and expectations for finances when
the Smith case broke.
