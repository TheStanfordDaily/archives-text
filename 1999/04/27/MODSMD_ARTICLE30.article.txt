# Baseball gets one-game relief from pressure
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
The pressure is off, for one game
at least.
For the lasl two weeks, sixth
ranked Stanford has been fighting
the defending national champion,
USC, for the upper hand in the race
for the Pacific 10 Conference
championship.
Every game has been important,
each pitch influential.
Stanford, a perennial postsea
son power, should be used to such
pressure. In the demanding format
of the NCAA baseball tournament
and College World Series, the
whole season can ride on one game.

However, Stanford (29-12) has
struggled to measure up lately.
The bullpen has been spotty at
times — no late-inning lead seems
safe — and the defense has col
lapsed in crucial situations, turning
multiple outs into runs.
The offense has been the only
constant, though a powerful one at
that.
The Cardinal's recent prowess
at the plate has not been enough,
though, as Stanford has only man
aged a split in its last six games to
fall back into a tie with the Trojans.
But tonight, all that can be for
gotten.
Tonight the pressure of the Pac
-10 race can be pushed aside as San
Jose State comes to Sunken Dia
mond.
The Spartans have some impres
sive wins and are coming off of a
three-game sweep of Utah over the
weekend, but Stanford should be
able to handle them like every
other quality team has done.
Fresno State, Washington State
— the last-place team in the Pac-10
— and top-ranked Rice have all
swept the Spartans in recent
months.
The lack of pressure provides a
perfect opportunity for Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess to get a
number of pitchers who have been
hit hard lately onto the mound.
Starters Jason Young. Justin
Wayne and Brian Sager will proba
bly not see action so they can rest
up for the weekend.
However, several relievers
could do well to pitch a few innings
and reclaim some of their confi
dence in a less-demanding environ

ment.
Freshman Mike Gosling (1-2.
5.46 ERA), freshman Mike Wod
nieki (2-0. 6.64 ERA) and senior
Tony Cogan (3-3. 2.89 ERA) could
all use a few innings.
Cogan has ;it times resembled a
dominating closer. Though he lacks
overpowering speed, his control
and confidence have allowed him
to shut down opposing batters.
However, his last two outings
have not been memorable. Last
Sunday, in the important third
came of the USC series. Cogan

gave up the lead on a home run and
three straight doubles. Friday at
Cal he allowed, among other
things, the game-winning two-run
home run in the bottom of the
ninth.
Wodnicki has also struggled of
late, trying to muscle the ball to the
plate instead of pitching. That ap
proach has not been successful. He
allowed a gigantic home run in the
ninth inning of the Sunday IJSC
g;ime — effectively putting the con
test out of reach — and was ineffec
tive hist weekend against the Bears.

Tonight though, the most im
portant thing will not be whether a
pitcher is overly effective, hut
whether he can get a few quality,
confidence-building innings on the
mound.
Stanford expects to win tonight.
It should. It's playing one of the
weaker teams in the Western Ath
letic Conference.
But truly, for the first time in
two weeks, the outcome of the
game is not all-important.
The pressure is off. For once, it's
time to relax and play ball.
