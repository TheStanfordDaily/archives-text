### Christina McCarroll 
a father photographically
immortalizes his infant
son's struggle to survive

For the first four days of their son's life, Lincoln
Hale Turner and his wife, Cindy, were afraid to give
the boy a name.
On March 13,1997. the Turners' son was born at Se
quoia I iospital with respiratory failure, a complication
of meconium aspiration syndrome, which was caused
by the baby having his first bowel movement while still
in the womb. Three hours later, he was whisked to Lu
cile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford

and was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxy
genation. a heart-and lung-bypass machine.
In a series of mixed-media images, medical docu
ments and personal reflections on his son's struggle.
Lincoln Turner recalls the technology, hope and devo
tion that kept his son alive. Turner's new photography
exhibit, " Technology and the Will to Live," is on dis
play in the lobby of the Children's I lospital until April
29.'
"Looking through the camera is the way I deal with
a lot of things," Turner said, "the wav 1 make order out

of life. I was able to be alone with my thoughts and
alone with him when I was looking through the cam
era. I couldn't see anything else."
Cindy Turner recalls her husband "taking pictures
of everything — close-ups of hands, the IV. bellvbut
tons. It just seemed natural to see him behind the cam
era."
Turner's pieces are assembled in three layers. Im
ages of his son and medical equipment are mounted on

Jack Hearst and his father Stephen view "Technology and the Will to Live," a photography exhibit at the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital. The ex
hibit commemorates the artist's infant son's 1997 battle for survival. The exhibit will remain on display in the hospital's lobby until Thursday.
sheets of stainless steel and two
sheets of Plexiglass hang from steel
rods above the images. On the top
sheet of glass. Turner's reflections
and notes to his son and wife are
handwritten in red. On the second
sheet of glass hang medical docu
ments, including doctors' progress
reports and a diagram of an ECMO
machine.
Turner said that the stainless
steel "acts as a metaphor for the hos
pital and its surgical element."
While the layers of text and
image relate to each other chrono
logically. Turner finds other connec
tions as well.
"Sometimes those levels of
meaning are so deep and so embed
ded in the work, that not everyone
realizes what they're looking at. 'The
work is open to interpretation, and
that's one of the beauties of the
work," he said.
Two pieces in the exhibit exam
ine the Turners' hesitation to name
their son. In an excerpt dated Fri

Turner writes, "The sign above your
head declares 'I'm a boy,' but says
only 'Turner' because we have not
yet named you. It occurs to me after
almost a day, and becoming fully
aware of the seriousness of your
condition that I am afraid to give
you a name. I think by not naming
you I can avoid becoming attached.
As I think this I know it is unreason
able, if not irrational. F.very child
deserves a name."
Turner recalls the naming of his
child as one of the most significant
aspects of the trauma. " The fact that
we didn't have a name," said Turn
er, "the irony of a child being born
and dying in the same day, just im
pacted me tremendously. A lot of
the work concentrates on that."
Technology, too, is emphasized
in many of Turner's images. Turner
said, "One of the things that helped
me tremendously through the situa
tion was my interest in technology; it
gave me something to grab onto and
talk about. When you look at the
machinery it takes [to breathe], you
realize how incredibly elegant our
bodies are. It was a difficult situa
tion, but getting to think about all
those things was really great."
On March lb, doctors told the
Turners that their son's condition
had improved, and the Turners
named the child Graham Phillips
Turner. That day's photograph is a
close-up of Graham sleeping, still
attached to a respirator; it hangs be
hind a doctor's handwritten report
of improvement and Turner's letter
to his son. in which he describes
Graham's name as "not a present at
all, but a birthright . .. something
you will enjoy for a lifetime."
After six days on ECMO, Gra
ham was in intensive care for nearly
a month. According to Turner, Gra
ham who is now two years old.

"hasn't looked back except that he
asks for his pediatrician — , whom
he loves. Whenever we head south
on 101, he thinks we're going to see
him and asks over and over again,
'Going to see Dr. Marks?' "
Dr. Harvey Cohen, chair of the
Department of Pediatrics at the
School of Medicine and chief of staff
of the Children's Hospital, leads the
medical staff that cared for Graham
Turner. Both Cohen and Turner
spoke at the exhibit's opening on
Wednesday.
"I was quite moved by the inten
sity of the comments and the feel
ings," Cohen said. "What comcs
through is the appreciation of all
that is done for both the child and
the family."
Randy Mann, associate director
of development for the Lucile
Packard Foundation for Children's
Health, also recalled the emotional
power of the display. "It gets more
and more powerful each time you
see it,"he said. "Last night, I don't
think there were too many dry eyes
in the auditorium when Lincoln was
talking."
For Cindy Turner, too, the exhib
it retains its intensity. "It's just as
emotional today, reading each
piece, as it was the first time I saw
it," she said. "It's also nice as Gra
ham gets older for him to be able to
see how his father coped with the sit
uation, produced something so
beautiful and meaningful for the
whole family."
Cohen recalls the joy of seeing
Graham at the presentation. "When
we see kids like Graham thriving
two years alter the kind of intense
care he had, we know that what
we're doing is right. And when we
see a family so appreciative, we
know the care we give is the right
care, even when the results are not
as good as they've been for Gra
ham."
Turner, who teaches photogra
phy and works in an art studio at
UC-Berkeley, said he believes the
project will affect his future work
tremendously. "I grew in leaps and
bounds when I was making this
work," he said. "The experience
alone certainly helped me grow as a
person, but reliving the experience
and making the artwork from it has
helped me grow just as much as an
artist. I'll bring this experience to
bear on all future work, and I think
it will add a certain level of emo
tional, intellectual complexity to
it."
Perhaps the most vivid, joyful
part of Turner's future is Graham
himself. Both Turner and his wife
describe Graham as energetic, ac
tive and inquisitive. "He loves to
look through all his photo albums
and pick out the people that he
likes," Turner said. "I le looks at the
pictures from when he was on
ECMO and says. Baby sick?' or
something like that."
Graham has not yet stepped be
hind the camera's lens. "But," ac
cording to Turner, "it won't be long."
