LITTLETON, Colo. (AP)-
The two students who killed 13 peo
ple at Columbine High wanted to kill
at least 500 others, attack nearby
homes and then hijack a plane and
crash it into New York City, investi
gators said yesterday.
Jefferson County Sheriff John
Stone earlier told reporters the goal
of the killers, Dylan Klebold and
Eric Harris, was to strike during the
busy lunch hour to go for "a big kill."
But sheriffs department
spokesman Steve Davis said the gun
men's diary indicates that if they sur
vived, they wanted more.
"They wanted to kill S(X) people,
hijack a plane and take it to New
York City." Davis said. "If in fact
they were able to carry out the entire
plan, there could have been quite a
bit more damage and quite a few

more fatalities."
"1 suppose when you first hear it.
you think that it's some horrible fan
tasy," District Attorney Dave
Thomas told NBC's "Today" show.
"But we now know that at least the
first portion of those planned activi
ties were in fact carried out.
"Unfortunately, we also know
that had a couple of the devices in
the school actually detonated as they
had planned, the death toll could
have been much higher than it was,"
Thomas said.
Police said the pair, enraged by
what they considered insults from
classmates, rampaged through their
school with guns and bombs before
turning their weapons on them
selves. Investigators, amazed at the
sheer firepower, are trying to deter
mine if others were involved.

Davis said an 18-year-old woman,
described as Klebold's girlfriend,
was being questioned about whether
she had purchased two of the four
firearms used in last Tuesday's mas
sacre, a 9 mm carbine ritle and a
TEC-DC 9 semiautomatic pistol.
As for whether anyone other than
Harris, Klebold and the young
woman were under investigation.
Thomas said: "We believe more
than three were certainly aware of it.
Whether more than three were
involved in it, that's really the
essence of our investigation at this
point."
On Sunday, 70,000 students,
friends, relatives and strangers
turned a strip-mall parking lot into
an arena of grief and promised each
other they would reach past their
pain.
