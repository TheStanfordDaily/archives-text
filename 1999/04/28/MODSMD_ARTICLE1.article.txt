# Fewer techie majors, national study says
## 
### Abhishek Bajoria Contributing writer 
While a recent nationwide study reports a
definite decrease in college students' interest
in technical fields, Stanford students are not
falling in line.
The American Electronics Association re
ported that the number of science and engi
neering degrees awarded nationwide declined
5 percent from 1990 to 1996. The study, re
leased Monday, showed a 3 percent decrease
in engineering degrees conferred, along with a
16 percent decrease in engineering technology
degrees conferred. Physics and Mathematics
degree conferrals went down 5 and 9 percent,
respectively.
Stanford, however, does not seem to be af
fected by this trend. The Computer Science
Department is conferring more degrees than
ever. Last year, the department conferred 79
bachelor's degrees, up from 52 in 1994 and 18
in 1988. Math and physics majors have re

mained fairly constant over the past few years,
while the number of electrical engineering de
grees conferred has been cut in half.
UC-Berkeley also shows no decline in the
conferral of undergraduate technical degrees.
A representative from UC-Berkeley's Chan
cellors Office of Planning and Analysis attrib
uted this to the "high demand" for engineer
ing graduates from these schools.
California awarded the most number of
technical degrees nationwide — 20,809 in 1996
— but this number is still 1,600 fewer than the
number awarded in 1990.
Although Harvard's undergraduate em
phasis has "been heavily in the social sciences
and humanities," according to Thurston
Smith, the senior associate registrar for Har
vard University, the number of engineering
majors has not declined, remaining fairly con
stant over the past 10 years.
AEA President William Archey told the

Associated Press Sunday he blamed
the U.S. educational system for "not
adequately preparing our youth for
today's information age economy."
The nationwide decline in techni
cal degree conferral occurs despite
the expanding computer industry
and the growing demand for engi
neering majors in the work force.
The nationwide unemployment rate
for engineering majors is far below
the national average, with a 1.6 per
cent unemployment rate for engi

neers and 1.2 percent for math and
computer scientists last year, ac
cording to the Associated Press.
The fact that Stanford students
aren't following this trend "doesn't
surprise me," said Dean of Students
Marc Wais, calling the high-tech in
dustry "an ever-growing, expanding
field nationally."
He said he doesn't believe the na
tionwide decline to be a sign that stu
dents aren't prepared but that "the
field is growing tot) rapidly" for stu
dents and universities to keep up
and "not everyone is inclined to a ca
reer in high tech." He also believes
the decline might also be caused bv

students who opt to go into the in
dustry without a college degree.
Jim Plummer, the chair of the
Electrical Engineering Department,
said the decline in degrees conferred
hv his department can be explained
by an increase in the number of com
puter science degrees awarded. He
said this is consistent with trends ob
served at other major universities.
The study also showed that 45
percent of doctoral degrees awarded
in technical disciplines are awarded
to foreign nationals.
Plummer said similar figures hold
true at Stanford in the electrical en
gineering department. I ie explained

that domestic master's students re
ceive excellent job offers, while in
ternational students have to worry
about residency, which hampers
their entrance into the job market.
When asked about the high con
centration of foreign students, Wais
responded by saying this has histori
cally been the case at Stanford.
The increasing number of Stan
ford computer science majors can be
explained by the presence of Silicon
Valley, which seems to be able to ab
sorb unlimited numbers of technical
majors. "The problem is that there
are too many jobs and not enough CS
majors." freshman David Black said.
