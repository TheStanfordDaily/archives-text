# Fewer techie majors, national study says
## 
### Abhishek Bajoria Contributing writer 
While a recent nationwide study reports a
definite decrease in college students' interest
in technical fields, Stanford students are not
falling in line.
The American Electronics Association re
ported that the number of science and engi
neering degrees awarded nationwide declined
5 percent from 1990 to 1996. The study, re
leased Monday, showed a 3 percent decrease
in engineering degrees conferred, along with a
16 percent decrease in engineering technology
degrees conferred. Physics and Mathematics
degree conferrals went down 5 and 9 percent,
respectively.
Stanford, however, does not seem to be af
fected by this trend. The Computer Science
Department is conferring more degrees than
ever. Last year, the department conferred 79
bachelor's degrees, up from 52 in 1994 and 18
in 1988. Math and physics majors have re

mained fairly constant over the past few years,
while the number of electrical engineering de
grees conferred has been cut in half.
UC-Berkeley also shows no decline in the
conferral of undergraduate technical degrees.
A representative from UC-Berkeley's Chan
cellors Office of Planning and Analysis attrib
uted this to the "high demand" for engineer
ing graduates from these schools.
California awarded the most number of
technical degrees nationwide — 20,809 in 1996
— but this number is still 1,600 fewer than the
number awarded in 1990.
Although Harvard's undergraduate em
phasis has "been heavily in the social sciences
and humanities," according to Thurston
Smith, the senior associate registrar for Har
vard University, the number of engineering
majors has not declined, remaining fairly con
stant over the past 10 years.
