Consumer confidence continues to rise
NEW YORK (AP) — Boosted by a strong job market and the
greatest surge in wages in a generation, U.S. consumer confidence
rose lor the sixth straight month in April despite the war in Kosovo,
rising gas prices and nagging concerns that stock prices are too high.
The Conference Board, a private business research group, report
ed its consumer confidence index rose nearly a full point to 134.9 from
a revised 134 in March, a stronger performance than expected. A sec
ond index designed to measure consumer expectations for the next six
to nine months had an even bigger increase, rising from 105.6 lo 108.
I he survey is important because consumer spending accounts for
two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity.
One big reason given for the optimism is that jobs are more plenti
ful than at any other time in recent memory. As a result, starting
wages for skilled workers are on the rise.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that average
income last year was $26,412, up 4.4 percent from 1997, significantly
outpacing inflation. Between the early 1970s and the early 19905, real
wages grew by a paltry half percent a year, James Annable, chief
economist at Bank One Corp. in Chicago, said.
Nonetheless, economists thought the consumer confidence figure
would remain flat in April.
Gas prices are up nearly 25 percent over the past two months. The
United States and its NA TO allies began their air campaign against
Yugoslavia on March 24 and may have to commit ground troops to
finish the job. And many analysts fear that the stock market's lofty
levels make it ripe for a fall.
Arkansas state senator Nick Wilson indicted
LIITLE ROCK. Ark. (AP) — The man considered the most pow
erful member of the Arkansas Senate was indicted yesterday on
charges that he netted $1.3 million through fraudulent contracts and
kickbacks.
The federal racketeering indictment named state Sen. Nick Wilson
and nine other people on charges of mail fraud, obstruction of justice
and money laundering.
U.S. Attorney Paula Casey said the scheme involved the "corrup
tion of the Arkansas General Assembly with Wilson as the leader and
primary decision-maker and planner."
The indictment alleges that Wilson benefited from a $3 million
grant program he helped set up in 1997. The grants pay for legal work
performed on behalf of children caught in the middle of custody cases
and for attempts to enforce payment of child support money.
Prosecutors alleged that Wilson submitted bills under that program
for work he never performed, and directed attorneys to pay him kick
backs for work they performed.
The program was halted soon after it began, when news reports
raised questions about its propriety.
Bill Walmsley. an attorney for Wilson, said he expected the sena
tor to plead innocent.
Wilson, a Democrat, is considered one of the state Senate's most
powerful members because of his 28 years in office and his skills as a
power broker.
Chernobyl computer virus causes trouble
NEW YORK (AP) — Proving more destructive than expected,
the Chernobyl virus caused hundreds of thousands of computer melt
downs around the world, though the effects were far worse overseas
than in the United States.
The unusually destructive virus — timed to strike on April 26. the
13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster — tries to erase a
computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system settings to
prevent the machine from being restarted.
While experts were still tallying numbers, Turkey and South Korea
each reported 300,000 computers damaged Monday, and there were
more elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. Officials said warnings
there weren't heeded.
Other experts disagreed over whether it was the most destructive
virus ever. But many were caught off guard by the amount of damage
and said it was much worse than the Melissa virus early this month.
The United States suffered far less than other nations, and experts
credited widespread warnings and updated antivirus programs with
helping avert problems in the corporate world. Home users were hit
harder.
About 1(H) student computers were wiped out at Princeton Uni
versity about two weeks before term papers were due.
Bill Pollak. spokesman for the Computer Emergency Response
Team at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said there were
reports of at least 2,328 computers damaged in the United States.
But the numbers could be higher, since no company or computer
user is required to report a virus attack, he said.
Hie virus is believed to have originated in Taiwan and attacks Win
dows 95 and Windows 98 computers.
