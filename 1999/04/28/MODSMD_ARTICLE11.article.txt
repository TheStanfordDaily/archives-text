# Pentagon will call up reservists
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The
Pentagon announced yesterday it
will call 33,102 reservists to active
military duty, bringing the Kosovo
conflict close to communities from
coast to coast. The call-up will begin
immediately with 2,116 members of
the Air Force Reserve and Air
National Guard to assist in aerial
refueling of NATO warplanes.
The first reservists to get the call
are from units based in Alabama,
Arizona, California, Indiana,
Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin. They will serve on active
duty for as long as six months.
Thousands more reservists will
be pulled from their civilian jobs in
the weeks ahead as NATO expands
its air campaign. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said in announcing
that his mobilization would affect
reservists in all branches of the mili
tary.
The nonvoluntary call-up is the
first since NATO began its air cam
paign to win autonomy for Kosovo
on March 24 and the largest since
240.000 served in the buildup to the
1991 Gulf War. About 1.000
reservists have been serving as vol
unteers for NATO, but Cohen's
call-up means they will be relieved.
"We must go beyond the limits of
volunteerism," Air Force Maj. Gen.
Michael Kudlacz told reporters.
The Pentagon did not have a pre
cise breakdown of the 33,102
reservists to be called, by service.
But it said about 25.(XX) will be Air
Force, 6,1(X) Army, and 1 ,(KK) each
from the Marine Corps and Navy.
Labor Secretary Alexis M. Her

man publicly reminded employers
that reservists' civilian jobs are pro
tected by law. and Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., said he would introduce
legislation that would offer financial
assistance to reservists who are small
business owners and are included in
the call-up for Kosovo duty.
In a related development, Air
Force Maj. Gen. Susan Pamerleau
said the Air Force has been autho
rized to prevent active duty mem
bers in certain job specialties from
leaving the service during the Koso
vo contlict. She said it had not been
determined yet how many depar
tures would be stopped or in which
jobs, but it is the first time this "stop
loss" authority has been used since
the Gull War. she said.
On the diplomatic front. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe I'albott
concluded talks in Moscow with
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian
mediator for the Balkans.
"On behalf of the United States,
he laid out very clearly the objec
tives NATO has set forth in its com
muniques and the importance we
attach to achieving those objec
tives," State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said.
Russia strongly objects to
NATO's bombing campaign and to
the idea of a NATO-led peacekeep
ing force being sent to Kosovo in the
event of a settlement to ensure safe
return of refugees.
" The Russians did not indicate
any major changes in their position."
Rubin said.
In remarks at a Pentagon news

conference, Cohen indicated little
interest in the idea of putting a
peacekeeping force under the com
mand of the United Nations — a
formulation that might be accept
able to Yugoslavia but at any rate is
on hold as long as NA TO keeps up
its bombing campaign.
"There must be an international
peacekeeping force that is NATO
led and. at the core. NATO must be
involved in its management." Cohen
said. I le seemed to leave room for
maneuver, however, by adding later
that "we believe it should be led by
NATO."
White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart used a similar approach,
saying the force "would be one with
NATO at its core." Yugoslavia has
insisted that it not include any
NATO countries.
Administration officials were
encouraged that representatives of
the International Committee of the
Red Cross had a second, more sub
stantive visit with the three U.S. sol
diers being held as prisoners of war
in Belgrade. The three were exam
ined by a doctor but the results were
not made public.
Despite discouragement from
the White House, a delegation of
U.S. religious leaders led by Jesse
Jackson said it will travel to
Yugoslavia today to meet with three
captive Americans and try to secure
their freedom.
The delegation plans to give
Bibles to the soldiers, deliver letters
and tapes from their families and
take back messages from them.
House and Senate Republicans,

meanwhile, readied legislation that
would provide around $13 billion in
emergency liuuls to pay lor the
Balkans conflict and other defense
needs. That is double President
Clinton's request.
Cohen said the reserve call-up
will enable NATO to accelerate the
pace of its airstrikes by keeping
planes in the air longer and to
expand the attacks by fueling a larg
er fleet of strike aircraft. U.S. Gen.
Wesley Clark, the top NATO com
mander. has asked the Pentagon to
dispatch 300 more planes- one
third of which are to be refueling
planes. The first 30 extra reliielers
are among the planes to be flown by
the Air National Guard and Air
Force Reserve members that ( ohen
called to active duty.
At a Pentagon briefing on the lat
est round of NATO airstrikes, Air
Force Maj. Gen. ( harles Wald said
bad weather had again hampered
operations but strikes were carried
out against a range of targets in
Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia. 1 le
showed gun camera footage of I : .S.
bombs hitting a radio relay towe:
near Belgrade, a Yugoslav army
barracks in northern Komjvo and
paramilitary forces in Kosovo.
At his own briefing at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. Belgium.
Clark assessed the air campaign as it
enters its fifth week.
He acknowledged that President
Slobodan Milosevic has proven he is
willing to let his military and eco
nomic systems absorb tremendous
punishment but insisted NATO is
winning.
