LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) — Exactly a week
after the first shots rang out at Columbine High
School, a hush fell over the Denver area yesterday
and church bells tolled 15 times — one for each
victim and the two gunmen.
It was the first public expression of mourning
that included the two killers, whose names went
unmentioned at Sunday's memorial for 7().(XH)
people.
Televisions and radios fell silent for one minute
at 11:21 a.m. After the tolling, the bells rang out in
joyous tones.
"We did a celebratory peal to remind every
body that there is life after death," said Barry
Bowman of St. John's Episcopal Cathedral in
Denver.
Funerals for three more victims — Matthew
Kechter and Kyle Velasquez, both 16, and Corey
DePooter, 17 — were held. The Velasquez ser
vices drew 800 mourners, including Gov. Bill
Owens.
Investigators, meanwhile, questioned Dylan
Klebold's 18-year-old girlfriend, who is believed
to have bought at least two of the weapons used
by Klebold and Eric Harris. Investigators want to
know whether she knew how the guns were to be
used.
And in Washington. President Clinton
announced proposals to tighten federal gun laws.
"We don't have to go through another Littleton if
the American people want it badly enough." ( lin
ton said.
Eric Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, committed
suicide after bursting into Columbine High vvitli
guns and bombs on April 20. They killed 12 fellow
students and one teacher. Four guns were found in
the school.

Investigators said Robyn K. Anderson bought
at least two of the weapons — a rille and a shot
gun — at a Denver-area gun show last fall.
Anderson has not been arrested, and authori
ties stopped short of describing her as a suspect.
She has retained a lawyer and is said to be coop
erating.
Generally, it is illegal to give a minor a pistol
and illegal to give anyone a gun with the knowl
edge that it will be used in a crime.

At \ elasquez's funeral, neighbors and relative:
remembered him as a "gentle giant' who enjoyei
chores and family activities.
" There is no doubt in my mind that those tw(
young assailants were acting under satanic inllu
ence."said the Rev. Wayne LaGrone. II we wan
the \ iolence to stop, we inusi stai l with ourselves.
