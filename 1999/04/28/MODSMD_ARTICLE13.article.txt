Investigation of diplomat
raises issues of U.N.
nomination, speaking fees

WHEN RICHARD Hol
brooke spoke in Kresge
Auditorium fall quarter, it
seemed like standard fare for a lec
ture at Stanford â€” a distinguished,
timely speaker was discussing rele
vant issues with an interested group
of students.
However, the recent State
Department-led ethics investigation
into Holbrooke's acceptance of a
$20,000 honorarium for the event
lends tremendous significance to the
speech.
Holbrooke, who has been nomi
nated by President Clinton to be the
next U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, is faced with an obtrusive
set of problems. While his work with
the Dayton Peace Agreement and
his negotiations with Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic have
brought him both the recognition
and the credibility that are prerequi
sites for the position, he has set him
self up to be shot down by the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee,
which is led by North Carolina arch
conservative Jesse I lelms.
The specific investigation into any

wrongdoing hinges on whether Hol
brooke is judged to have aceepted
outside compensation relating to his
official duties.
The larger issue becomes whether
Holbrooke's slip-up at Stanford
indicates he is not able to conduct
himself in a manner appropriate to a
IJ.N. ambassador, which absolutely
requires behavior that does not lead
to ethics investigations.
Holbrooke had been operating
under the shadow of a different
ethics probe until very recently.
Allegations that he had illegally lob
bied his former government col
leagues soon after his resignation
from the Department were dis
missed in February.
The mere fact that Holbrooke is
being investigated brings other con
sequences for the Stanford commu
nity. On a campus that is so often
regarded as isolated or as a bubble,
hosting speeches by contemporary
political players is very beneficial.
Realistically, a speaker's honorar
ium is a necessary motivation to get
many distinguished, non-local
speakers to come to Stanford. If
Holbrooke and other government
envoys are barred from speaking for
a fee, the Stanford campus may well
lose a valuable resource for keeping
in touch with the current political
and diplomatic climate.
