# Breathing Lessons
## Examining Colorado and us 
###

IF THERE CAN be
any joy associated with
the horrific witness
accounts, massacre plans
and invasively close-up
photographs streaming
steadily to us this week
from Colorado, let us
Harris and Dylan Klebold

are dead. Even without judging the erime
itself or the value of a killer's life, we can be
glad that the families of Columbine High's
slaughter victims can begin to mourn imme
diately. They will not have to wait for a
drawn-out trial. They will not have to chan
nel anger into punishing a still-existing men
ace that murdered their loved ones. They
can begin to grieve and to incorporate the
loss into an uneasy acceptance.
As for the rest of us, it is a pity the ordeal
will be over so quickly. Trials aside, what's
making this atrocity easy to recover from is
that the media has sandwiched it into pre
scribed molds for understanding. That's
what you do when there's a horrible piece of
news. You identify the victims and perpetra
tors, you connect their names with their
more suggestive personality traits and you
glean a lot of meaning from coincidence.
You've heard complaints about the media
up the wazoo this week. They started the
first time that still-frame ol two solemn news
anchors floating above images of pain
promised to break it down for us: Tragedy at

Columbine High. Everyone's saying it. The
media is glossing this over. The media is not
getting at the underlying problems because
the underlying problems are too complicat
ed. The media is failing to address the reali
ty of the situation.
There's a reason for it. By condensing the
Columbine chaos into a series of generaliza
tions that we can digest, the coverage of the
Littleton story parallels the "virgin or vamp"
reasoning used in approaching rape cases —
reasoning that makes you certain the crime
won't happen to you.
As the characterization goes, the female
victim of a rape is either a "virgin" or a
"vamp." If you classify her as a virgin (not
literally), the rape case is one of an innocent,
helpless girl preyed upon and ravaged by a
perverted monster. If you classify her as a
vamp, the case is one of a woman with loose
morals, variable standards of conduct and a
questionable dress code — someone with
habits bound to get herself into that kind of
situation anyway. She should have seen it
coming, and she deserved it.
The logic continues that with either
option you choose, you as a society member
can feel safe. If the perpetrator is a monster,
he's easier to spot. He's the classic Stranger,
the kind hanging out on street corners leer
ing at small children. You can spot him, so
you're safe. If the victim was a vamp, you'll
be safe as long as you don't participate in her
lascivious lifestyle.

The Littleton tragedy tries both of these
tactics. Vamp: Blame the victims. After all.
the jocks supposedly tormented the Trench
coat Mafia, and moderate retribution for
teasing seems to be the norm in today's
schools. On the other hand, it seems that the
shootings targeted every group.
Next, virgin: Perpetrator as horrific mon
ster. Jump on the media bandwagon that
conveniently identifies the warning signs of
Monsters and cast-out loners, black trench
coats and Marilyn Manson music. Then
you've got a way to feel safe, a way to regu
late what's happening around you. But con
sider that the murderers didn't wholly fit in
this category. They went to school, held jobs
and were even described in some interviews
as personable and comforting at times. Mon
sters never offer solace.
So if Harris and Klebold weren't
depraved, soulless demons, what do we
make of them? We have to address those
real, pressing, underlying issues that every
one's alluding to but that no one has put a
name to. Apparently the real issue isn't gun
control. And it isn't TV violence. And it isn't
Goth music. And it lies somewhere in the
community. What is the problem?
The problem is a serious lack of any rem
nants of what used to be called morality. In
our society that condones anything and
everything under a blanket of personal free-


rejoice that Eric
dom and choice, people have become afraid
to set an end limit to taking liberties. Politi
cal correctness, however much it has come
under fire, has benefited society in that we
now consider the assumptions with which
we approach judgment.
But no one — at least no one in the pub
lic eye — has taken our personal choices to
their extremes, put a foot down and said,
"This, this right here. This is NOT OK."
We are afraid to infringe on other belief
systems, and in the process we shy away
from judging anything as right or wrong. We
try not to make any judgements at all. This
hate-filled music is OK because of free
speech. This cult that encourages violence is
OK because of freedom of religion. Access
to this kind of information is OK because we
don't want to have a society of censorship.
This kind of constitutional analysis is well
and good and as it should be. But ever since
we abandoned talk about what is and is not
right on a scale of how it affects real, human
people and began evaluating things in terms
of what our laws say is OK, we have
removed the impetus to act in ways that
actually protect people.
It all comes down to rights, which are not
sufficiently linked to our sense of selves to
prevent crime.
If vour only limitation is the law and not

a human code of conduct, what is to prevent
violations?
We have not preserved an inherent
incentive not to harm our fellow humans —
what used to come from discussions ol
"morality." At the same time, we have not
maintained any intimidating reasons to obey
the law.
After all, punishment normally fits the
intention of the crime and not the crime
itself. If no one is taught how to be an
upstanding, moral human being, then one's
crime could not have ill intentions because it
did not violate that person's moral code.
And each person's beliefs are valuable and
OK, even those people with no moral codes.
What is necessary to stop a society of vio
lence is an intimate recognition of what is
unacceptable and plainly wrong on more
than a legal level.
We also need punishments that fit the
crimes and not the intentions.
As society stands now. it is better that the
Columbine murderers are not around to
prosecute, because their accounts might
show us how we have failed in ways more
horrific than the footage from Colorado.

prevent crime.
If vour only limitation is the law and not

a human code of conduct, what is to prevent
violations?
We have not preserved an inherent
incentive not to harm our fellow humans —
what used to come from discussions ol
"morality." At the same time, we have not
maintained any intimidating reasons to obey
the law.
After all, punishment normally fits the
intention of the crime and not the crime
itself. If no one is taught how to be an
upstanding, moral human being, then one's
crime could not have ill intentions because it
did not violate that person's moral code.
And each person's beliefs are valuable and
OK, even those people with no moral codes.
What is necessary to stop a society of vio
lence is an intimate recognition of what is
unacceptable and plainly wrong on more
than a legal level.
We also need punishments that fit the
crimes and not the intentions.
As society stands now. it is better that the
Columbine murderers are not around to
prosecute, because their accounts might
show us how we have failed in ways more
horrific than the footage from Colorado.
