University policy questionable
We are writing to express our concern over the Uni
versity's commitment to critical inquiry and intellectual
debate.
In a recent meeting with a high-ranking representative
ol the Dean of Students Office, our fundraising chair was
told that the Office of Student Activities could not fund
our conference "Students and the Labor Movement,"
which was held at Stanford last weekend.
Despite conceding that we had presented a solid pro
posal and clearly well organized event, the dean regretted
to inform us that the University could not fund the event.
He stated that one of our panels titled "Graduate Stu
denl ()rganizing" conflicted with the interests of the Uni
versity in maintaining its institutional framework.
Although we understand the tensions that the Univer
sity mav feel about this subject, we believe that it has vio
lated one of its fundamental tenets in deciding not to fund
the conference because of its inclusion of dissenting ideas.
The University's motto, which translates to "let the
winds ol freedom blow," refers to the questioning and
critical spirit which Stanford prides itsell on.
However if this spirit cannot encompass potentially
challenging and controversial perspectives, what good is
it?
II the University cannot withstand the scrutiny of its
critics, how strong are its principles and policies?
We want to urge the Stanford community, including all
students, faculty and administrators, to critically examine
and continue to pursue a vision of a University commit
ted to a questioning and critical spirit.
Il is only fitting that such a renowned university should
be open for inquiry on all fronts and bold enough to
debate the challenges it faces with intellectual sophistica
tion instead of attempting to silence the opposition.
We have no current desire for the funding which
would have been provided by the Dean of Students and
the Office of Student Activities.

We are writing this letter simply to share our concern
with a fundamental issue that we believe affects the entire
Stanford community.

Kasparov crowding explained
In response to Brent Silver's letter in Monday's Daily,
we very much appreciate Silver's interest in and kind
words about our Presidential Lecture series and under
stand his frustration at not being able to see Garry Kas
parov due to an overflow crowd in the Science and Engi
neering Quad Teaching Center.
I would like to take this opportunity to explain the rea
son for the overcrowding.
Here are two objective problems we had to cope with.
First of all, the SEQ Teaching Center was the largest
space available when we tried to make a room reserva
tion for Kasparov about three months ago — which was
literally as early as possible.
Secondly, we did consider a TV broadcast, but our
budget simply did not allow for the considerable costs a
broadcast would have incurred.
I know that these explanations do not "help."
But I wanted to point out that we are at least not cyn

ical about these issues and will do our best to avoid such
situations in the future.

Diversions is just not funny
I would like to second Professor Polhemus's letter yes
terday criticizing Diversions and its staff's latest comic
fumble.
Humor is an art form and should be regarded as such.
Though 1 believe in free speech, taste and wit also must
figure into public displays of humor.
The comic vomit that the current Diversions staff
mindlessly threw into Monday's Daily needs to go.
Apologizing for it in advance with the whine "it's hard
to write funny every week" not only does nothing to win
my pity but also reinforces my belief that only true mem
bers of the Galactically Stupid are responsible.
Humor is not hard. Wit is not impossible.
Diversions has been one tasteless ad hominem attack
after another, interspersed with seventh-grade sex jokes.
Too bad the pro fros missed it — I'm sure all of us
would have been proud of our school then.
Daily, please fix Diversions. An apology to Con
doleezza Rice would be a good start, but I'd also like to
see an apology to the readers of The Daily for having to
be submitted to such tripe on a weekly basis.
Fix Diversions, or kill it before it kills again. Comedy
at Stanford needs more forums than just the Chappie,
occasional iniprov scenes and the letters section of The
Daily.
