Interestingly enough, my conversations
over the past few days with students, fac
ulty and staff have focused on how we can
make Stanford a safer place for our stu
dents and visitors, not on finding scape
goats or organizing a resident assistant
alcohol police force.
1 do believe, however, that blatant vio
lations ol the Fundamental Standard, such
as serving alcohol to 16 and 17-year-old
high school students, justify considering
disciplinary action through the Universi
ty's judicial system.
From my perspective, and I hope yours,
such acts fall outside the realm of respon
sible behavior by members of the Stanford
community. They are unacceptable and
violate Stanford's institutional core values

governing personal behavior, not to men
tion the law.
I believe that alcohol use among Stan
ford students, and indeed alcohol use in
society, is a complex and difficult issue.
Societal traditions, alcohol use (and
abuse) patterns students bring to campus,
family patterns, handling competitive and
rigorous academic standards, the develop
ment of meaningful personal values and
learning through experience are all poten
tial factors contributing to alcohol abuse
by students.
At Stanford, we believe that simple
solutions or mere punitive actions are
ineffective deterrents to alcohol abuse by
students.
Recent incidents at MIT, Louisiana
State University and here at Stanford cer
tainly heightened our awareness of our
vulnerability as an educational communi
ty-
Education, residence community
responsibility, caring for one another and
simple common sense are by far the most
effective deterrents to student alcohol
abuse.

Stanford has studied the issue carefully
and has a history of alcohol education pro
gramming.
Following up on the 19%-% Alcohol
Task Force, we introduced a new alcohol
education program this year, with the
goals of providing 1) enhanced tools and
resources to residence staff. 2) clear mes
sages about the impact of alcohol use, 3)
meaningful student dialogue and 4) a
stronger sense of community in the resi
dences.
An advisory board, consisting of stu
dents, faculty and staff, assists me in think
ing broadly about these issues.
On May 5, the Student Affairs Adviso
ry Board on Student Alcohol Use will host
an open meeting to discuss how we can
avoid such troubling incidents from occur
ring at next year's Stanford Admit Week
end. Please join us in Tresidder, Oak
West, at 4 p.m. We will focus on solutions,
not blame.

affairs.
