## Matchbox PC joins line of wearable computing Professor and student build one of the world's smallest computers 
### Joanna Corman Contributing writer 
It's small enough to fit in a shirt pocket,
powerlul enough to run Windows 95 and
surt the Net and easy to assemble. It's the
matchbox PC', one of the world's smallest
computers, and it was recently invented by a
professor and a doctoral student at Stan
ford.
"It's the largest paradigm shift in com
puting since the invention of the laptop,"
said Shelley Harrison, Class of '90 and chair
man ol the Sacramento-based Orang-otang
Computers Inc., which publishes an online
magazine called Wearable Computing.
Harrison thinks there will ultimately be
two types of computers: embedded ones,
such as those in microwaves, and wearables.
Desktops and laptops, he predicts, will cease
to exist.
If Harrison's predictions are true. Com
puter Science Prof. Vaughan Pratt and Greg
Defouw, a doctoral student in computer sci
ence, have inched closer to outmoding desk
tops. Their invention builds on the match
box Web server Pratt invented in January.
Pratt wanted to merge the size and conve
nience of a Palm Pilot with the power of a
PC.
"I'm hoping that people will want their
PDA (personal digital assistant) as capable
as their PC," Pratt said.
The matchbox PC is just 5 square inches
and four-fifths of an inch thick. It has a 456
processor, 16 megabytes of RAM. a 340-
megabyte disk drive, a 64-megabyte com
pactflash and ports to connect to things such
as a keyboard, mouse, monitor and modem.
It is comprised of three boards that snap
together like Legos and weighs 2.5 ounces.
Pratt said it cost $742 to make, assembled

from off-the-shelf parts.
As is, the matchbox PC can be used as a
portable hard drive. Pratt imagines people
toting it to cyber cafes, using it in hotel
rooms while on business or plugging it into a
projector during an office presentation. But
it's not ready for public consumption yet.
"It's pieces of the idea," Pratt said.
In a few months, though, he will let mem
bers of the wearable computing world test it.
Eventually he wants to add an audio
chip, maybe a small monitor and touch
screen with pop-up keyboard and reduce its
battery power. The batteries used now are
as small as the matchbox PC.
Defouw works on the interface board,
the middle piece that allows the other two
boards to talk to each other. His goal is to
expand the computer's brainpower by cram
ming in as many circuit wires and chips as
possible.
"It's not just geeky, 'Oh, let me Ilex my
CPU (central processing unit) muscle,' "
Defouw said. "It's really practical."
So far, Mercedes Ben/ has visited the
wearables lab, looking lor technology to
integrate an MP3 player — a computer file
that stores music — into its cars' sound sys
tems.
Despite their invention's potential for
revolutionizing computers, Pratt and
Defouw are humble.
"It's really recognizing what technology
is out there and creating cool applications
for that technology," Defouw said. "It's out
there, but it wasn't packaged up for every
one to recognize it."
Said Pratt: "In the computer world, it's
hard to say what's an invention and what's
obvious. To us, this was obvious. Other
people say. 'It looks like an invention to
me.' "
