## Asbestos scare raises issues of health risk in tampon use 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
Not too long ago, I received an e-mail
warning about tampon manufacturers who
deliberately put asbestos in their products.
The asbestos was said to make users bleed
more, thus forcing them to buy more tam
pons. If you got the same e-mail, you can
relax — it's a hoax.
The asbestos rumor was so widely circu
lated on the Internet that the Food and
Drug Administration's Center for Devices
and Radiological Health responded, post
ing a notice on its Web site that states
"Asbestos is not an ingredient or even a
trace contaminant in any brand of tampon
manufactured in the U.S."
Still, the hoax raised concern over the
safety of tampons and made women aware
of alternatives to major market brands,
most of which are made from a blend ot
cotton and rayon and undergo a bleaching
process to clean the fibers and make them
white.
Natracare, a company that manufac
tures pure cotton tampons, said in a press
release that it wasn't sure of the source of
the asbestos e-mail and called it "a great
disservice to the cause of natural feminine
hygiene."
"Natracare has never found asbestos in
testing of any line of tampons," the press
release said. "This e-mail was erroneous
and misleading and takes away from the
real controversies: rayon in tampons and
their relation to toxic shock syndrome
(TSS) and chlorine bleaching (dioxins) in
feminine hygiene products."
These concerns, among others, have
found a forum on a quirky Web site — cre
ated by a man — that calls itself the Muse
um of Menstruation and Women's Health,
at www.mum.org. When the asbestos scare
was spreading, the "Mum" Web site pro
vided a question and answer series with Dr.

Philip Tierno Jr., director of microbiology
and diagnostic immunology at New York
University's Medical Center.
According to Tierno, trace elements of
asbestos, which have been shown to cause
cancer if inhaled, is present throughout the
environment in our air and water. So while
he says that it is possible for these trace ele
ments to be present in all wood pulp and
paper products, including tampons, he
denies that any manufacturer would delib
erately contaminate them. As he writes on
the Mum Web site, "That is absurd."
"I have been privy to every major man
ufacturer's secret documents because of
my role in TSS [toxic shock syndrome] liti
gation, and I can say that supposition is not
true!" Tierno is quoted as saying.
In its tampon safety section, the Web
site also raises questions about the use of
rayon fibers in the manufacture of tam
pons. Most mainstream brands of tampons
contain rayon fibers that are derived from
wood pulp and subjected to bleaching. One
type of bleaching process used chlorine
gas, resulting in a harmful dioxin by-prod
uct. The Environmental Protection Agen
cy has identified dioxin as a "probable can
cer-causing agent," linking it with a higher
risk of endometriosis — a menstrual condi
tion that is the leading cause of infertility.
The FDA says this bleaching process is
no longer used by any U.S. tampon manu
facturer. According to Tierno, the FDA
can rightly claim that current bleaching
methods do not form dioxins. But he
remains cautious and firm in his belief that
manufacturers should not make tampons
bleached with any form of chlorine. That's
because dioxins — even in trace
quantities — build up in the body over
time. And considering that American
women use an estimated 16,800 tampons in
their lifetimes, any risk of dioxin exposure
is too great.
"I'm saying. 1 have no reason to doubt

the FDA word." Tierno said. "Bui I'll
reserve my opinion on the safety of chlo
rine compounds until I see some more
data."
Some activists, like Congresswoman
Carolyn Malonev of New York, are push
ing for more research about dioxin levels in
tampons — and for the results of any
research to be made readily available to
the public. Malonev is behind the 1999
Tampon Safety and Research Bill, which
would fund testing of tampons for the pres
ence of dioxin and synthetic fibers, among
other additives thought to be harmful to
women. Maloney isn't satisfied by the cur
rent state of research into tampon use and
toxic shock syndrome.
"There has been research done. How
ever, it was conducted bv the manufactur
ers themselves," Maloney said in a recent
press release. "That doesn't seem very sci
entific to me. It's like letting the tobacco
industry research the health risks of
cigarettes."
Until adequate research has been con
ducted, Tierno advises that all-cotton tam
pons are better than those that contain
rayon. "Using cotton tampons provides the
lowest possible risk women can have for
toxic shock syndrome," Tierno said.
"They're the safest."
Cotton tampons are bleached using
hydrogen peroxide, so there's no risk of
residual quantities of chlorine dioxins.
All-cotton tampons used to be hard to
find, but they're becoming more common.
Even major manufacturers like Tampax
are responding to consumer pressure and
have created an all-cotton product line
called "Naturals." Health food stores like
Whole Foods in Palo Alto carry cotton
tampons. And thanks to the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center, located in the base
ment of Cowell Student Health Center,
you can now find Natracare-brand all-cot
ton tampons on campus.
