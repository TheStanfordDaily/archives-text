# Bug gnaws on the question of termites

### Garth Patil Contributing writer 
(J: / was walking by Tresidder on Saturday
nighi when / heard a loud groan followed by
the cracking and rustling of leaves. / turned
around to witness one of the large trees that
shades the picnic tables breaking in (wo at the
base and falling onto some bikes and tables.
Luckily, it didn 7 Jail on me. Upon further
inspection, I found that the trunk of the tree
was almost completely hollow and there were
small amber ants crawling around the open
ing. What kind of bug can make such quick
work of a large tree like that? How does it do
it?
\: 1 suppose 1 can think of a few people who I
don't think I would miss if they happened to be
standing under that tree on Saturday. Anyway,
it is good that no one was hurt and you're still
with us to ask the tough questions about this
spontaneous failure.
Even more lucky for you than avoiding
being crushed by that tree is that, being a bug,
I'm uniquely qualified to investigate this mys
tery. Before the University removed the evi
dence, I took a six-legged stroll over to Tresid
der to check out the scene.
As you can probably guess, termites were
the culprit of this tree infestation. Although
they are referred to popularly as white ants,
they are not closely related to ants, which arc
grouped with bees and wasps in a higher order
of insects. Termites, which number in total
about 2.(KH) species, are distributed widely,
reaching their greatest abundance in numbers
and species in tropical rain forests around the
world.
They feed upon and often destroy wooden
structures or vegetable matter valuable to
man. As introduced species, they are not well
equipped to adapt to changes in their environ
ment and tend to seek shelter in protected,
man-made areas such as cultivated crops or
buildings and thus are likely to become the
most serious pests.
Termites construct concentrated nests that
are often difficult to detect. Some nests rise
partly above the ground as mounds or hills;
others are totally underground or inside trees.
Dirt, fine clay or chewed wood glued together
with the termites' excretion or saliva is used to
build nests. During nest construction, a termite
deposits fecal matter to cement particles
together. If you looked closely at the Tresidder
tree, you would have noticed a cement-like
structure in the hollow of the trunk. This is the

nest that was built from the digested cellulose
from the tree and surrounding soil.
Rhinotermitidae, or subterranean termites,
are most likely the type of termites that per
formed this particular dirty work. Many
species of Rhinotermitidae build nests in wood
that are buried in damp soil. From the nests, a
diffuse network of tunnels to food sources may
radiate into the soil or above the ground in
covered pathways. The base of this tree in the
well-watered soil around Tresidder presents
optimum conditions for these termites.
The food of Rhinotermitidae is mainly cel
lulose. obtained from wood in the case of the
Tresidder tree. Most termites feed on wood,
either sound or partly decayed.
Cellulose digestion in lower termite fami
lies depends upon a flagellate protozoa that
lives inside the termite. The protozoa secretes
the cellulase and cellobiase enzymes. These
break down cellulose into sugar and acetic
acid. The termites depend entirely on proto
zoans for cellulose digestion and would starve
without them. Newly hatched termites acquire
the protozoa from older, infected termites dur
ing anal feeding — a type of feeding necessary
to termites that use protozoan for digestion.
So are termites all bad? In this case, ter
mites destroyed an otherwise healthy tree, but
in the grander scheme of things, termites play
an important role in the ecological cycle. Their
destruction of cellulose in dead plant matter
helps to convert plant cellulose into substances
that can be used by the ecosystem to support
new growth.
