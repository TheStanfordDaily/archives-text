### Monica Sergott Contributing writer 
I he hopes and expectations
going into last weekend's races were
not met hv the Stanford crew teams.
Besides the novice crew's victories,
the Cardinal lost all its races against
Sacramento State, Oregon State
and Kansas. The sporadic winds and
water conditions left Stanford with
out the usual home-course advan
tage.

CREW

■ Saturday: Stanford varsity lost
races to Oregon State. Varsity
women also lost a race to Kansas
State.

■ Sunday: Stanford varsity teams
lost dual meet races to Sacramento
State.

Coterminal student Vainly John
son summarized the weekend as "a
good racing experience, although
we didn't do as well as hoped."
The varsity women opened the
weekend lacing Oregon State early
Saturday. The Beavers maintained a
distant lead throughout the race.
Oregon State crossed the finish line
more than 10 seconds ahead of the
Cardinal.
Senior co-captain Kipper York
said. "We never settled into a
rhythm in the race. We were fighting
against ourselves instead of OSU."
"We got the jitters out and real
ized our focus. We fought hard,"
said Johnson.
Later that afternoon Kansas
State also defeated the women's
crew team. The Cardinal came out
strong in the first 1,000 meters, hut
the team suddenly found itself help
less to the overwhelming wind.
Trouble in the boat was caused by
an "over-the-head crab," occurring
because a blade was caught in the
choppy waters causing the oar to get
ripped out of a rower's hand.
This not only caused confusion,
but forced the boat to a dead stop.
When Stanford began regaining
speed, the Cardinal rowers faced a
strong wind, making a victory im
possible. The choppy water enabled
Kansas State to finish ahead.
Sunday finallv brought the lone

victory to the women. Despite the
absence of stroke seat (a rower with
exemplary technique) Becky Hop
kinson. the novice eight defeated
Sacramento State 7:36.7 to 8:00.
Although they had a strong start
and raced an above-average race,
both varsity boats lost to Sacramen
to State.
York emphasized the positive
when summarizing the regatta.
"Our focus going into the week
end was our start. We made the
progress that we had been looking
to make. We accomplished our team
goals." York said.
The women are working toward
attainable goals for the Big Row
against California this weekend and
the upcoming Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.
When facing No. 3 ('alilornia the
women plan to "let it all out and see
how long we can hang with them"
Johnson said.
I he Stanford men eerily had the
same finish as their counterparts.
Disappointment was the overall
sentiment for the Cardinal men's
crew team. They fell to the Beavers
and the Hornets, but the novice
crew defeated Sacramento State.
Junior Ryan Radecki attributed
the loss to "a bad week at practice.
We forgot how to row."
It wa,s a great downfall for one of
the most promising men's crew
teams Stanford has seen. Junior Will
Smith described the team as not
being fast at a key time of the season.
The discouragement was quickly
washed away with thoughts of the
coming Big Row and Pac-10 races.
The men's crew team will train
through this weekend's competition
against No. I California and focus
on its own performance.
The lapse in Cardinal success has
the potential to motivate the team to
future success.
"We have three weeks to get bet
ter. We're going to work hard and
give 110 percent in practice the next
couple of weeks. We'll pick up the
pieces and hopefully the speed will
come." Smith said.
The strength of Stanford crew
will be eminent in the recovery of
the teams from a disappointing
weekend.
