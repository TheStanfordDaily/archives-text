WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Last weekend: Stanford freshman
Marissa Irvin won the singles Pac-10
title. Teammate Teryn Ashley and
Irvin won the Pac-10 doubles title.

Lasira's run ended in the quar
terfinals, while Ashley was stopped
in the semifinals.
Irvin. however, plowed through
the draw without dropping a set,
sweeping USCs Ditta Huber, 6-1,

-7-6 (4). in the championship match.
Some onlookers worried that
Irvin would falter in this tourna
ment. considering she had lost four
of her seven previous matches.
Irvin. though, came out playing
the kind of tennis that had pro
pelled her to the No. 2 national
ranking earlier this season.
In the first round, she crushed
California's Francesca La'O. In the
quarterfinals, she avenged a recent
loss to Arizona State's Allison
Bradshaw, routing the Sun Devil, 6-
3,6-4.
After powering past Cal's Amy
Jensen in the semifinals, she
avenged another recent loss with
her victory over Huber.
"1 had no doubt that she would
bounce back." Ashley said. "But
she did have to play some good ten
nis to win this tournament."
Irvin agreed.
"I felt that I was really hitting the
ball well." she said. "When I was

losing some matches before, the
team came through and we still beat
the other teams. But this was all
about the important individual as
pect."
"Winning this tournament has
been important to me since I was lit-

tle and I watched
the college play
ers in Ojai when I
was playing the
114-and-under
to u rnaments].
The locals love
the tournament
and it always gets
a big crowd."

While vindication doesn't preoc
cupy Irvin. her competitive nature
was inspired when she saw Brad
shaw in her part of the draw.
"I was hoping to get a shot at
her." she said.
"And I was hoping that Ashley
was going to beat Huber in the
semifinals, but once she didn't, I

was excited to take on Huber in the
finals, too."
Despite her loss to Huber. Ash
ley's tournament result was an im
pressive one.
While she had hoped to either
match or improve upon her runner
up performance last year, Ashley
remained pleased with her play.
"I played pretty well," she said
after succumbing to Huber in three
tight sets, 6-3,4-6,6-1.
"But Ditta played extremely
well. She was on the top of her game
and came up with some exce'lent
shots at the right times, although it's
not as if I didn't have some oppor
tunities."
Lastra also affected the draw,
dominating Cal's Anita Kurimay,
ranked 17th in the nation, in the
second round.
"I thought the whole team per
formed reallv well," Irvin said. "As


Irvin
a team, we garnered more points in
the draw than any other team."
The Cardinal also shined in the
Pac-1() Invitationals, which features
each team's fifth-, sixth- and sev
enth-ranked singles players.
Junior Jennifer Heiser, who
plays at the No. 5 spot for the Car
dinal, captured the title with a con
vincing 6-2,6-2 triumph over USC's
Veronika Safarova.
In the match of the tournament,

Heiser struggled past ASU's Faye
DeVera with a dramatic 3-6,7-6 (5),
7-6 (8) semifinal win.
"It was great for Jen to win the
Invitationals," Ashley said. "She
played really well."
The Stanford women, however,
are perhaps most pleased with their
performance in the doubles compe
tition.
While the talented duo of Lastra
and Kalvaria succumbed in the
quarterfinals, Stanford's top pair of
Ashley and Irvin captured the dou
bles championship.
Ashley and Irvin, who make up

the nation's second-ranked squad,
cruised through their lirst three
matches before dominating Cal's
Claire Curran Kurimay in the finals,
6-1,6-2.
"I'm so excited about the dou
bles," Ashley said. "We're playing
so well. And it's exactly the right
time, too."
The women now have two weeks
off before hosting the NCAA Re
gional Championships at Stanford
May 14-16.
Their performance in the Pac
10s should translate into a success
ful performance that weekend.
