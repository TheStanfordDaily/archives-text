# Host Hawaii builds 14-point lead after first day of competition
## Stanford takes second place in regatta 
### Becky Blanchard Contributing writer 
Last weekend's trip to Hawaii
fell just short of paradise for the
Stanford women's sailing team,
which finished second behind the
host Rainbow Wahine in the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Yacht Racing
Association women's district cham
pionship. The lOth-ranked Cardinal
took advantage of its physical
strength in breezy conditions to fin*-
ish solidly but couldn't catch No. 14
Hawaii in its home waters.
"I lavvaii got out to a lead." said
Stanford head coach Steve Bour
dow. "They were definitely a little
bit more relaxed."
Sophomore skipper Heather
Porter and junior crew Katie Gregg
competed in Saturday's early A Di
vision races, averaging third- and
fourth-place finishes. Hoping to
find a better combination for the
windy conditions, senior co-captain
Taylor Robinson, who specializes in
sailing in heavy winds, took over for
Porter. However, with first- and
seventh-place finishes, Robinson
and Gregg still averaged in the mid

die of the pack.
Junior skipper Anika Leerssen
and junior crew Alexis Krivkovich,
kept Stanford in position to chal
lenge for the lead by dominating
Saturday's B Division races.
"Anika and Alexis did a great
job," said Bourdow. "They were
definitely in control of their divi
sion."

SAILING

â–  Last weekend: Stanford took sec
ond place in Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate Yacht Racing Championship.

Yet even with strong perfor
mances from Leerssen and
Krivkovich, the Cardinal finished
the first day of racing in a disap
pointing second place. Hawaii used
its strong start to build a 14-point
lead, a deficit the Cardinal fought to
overcome in Sunday's races.
Porter returned to skipper for
Stanford's A Division boat after she
and Gregg worked with Bourdow to
develop techniques and strategies
for sailing in the gusty conditions.
According to Bourdow. the duo's
improved performance was like "a

string of bullets." They swept Sun
day's early races, while Leerssen
and Krivkovich continued their
winning ways in the B Division.
The Cardinal cut Hawaii's lead
to a single point before the Rainbow
Wahine stepped up their perfor
mance to secure the championship.
Porter struggled to outmaneuver
the Hawaii team, which used fast
starts and covering techniques to
keep Stanford behind it.
"Hawaii really got its act back to
gether." Bourdow said. "|Porter]
got pushed back, and that really al
lowed Hawaii to sail off into first
place."
The Rainbow Wahine's A Divi
sion success put them eight points
ahead of the Stanford squad. Their
lead was too much of a gap for
Leerssen and Krivkovich to close.
Though they had hoped to win the
district regatta, the Cardinal women
were pleased with their perfor
mance in challenging conditions.
"Because of the Hawaiian trade
winds, gusts of wind could come at
any time, from anywhere," Porter
said.. "We always had to be ready
for anything. Because of this, 1 think

we owe most of our success to our
crews. Katie and Alexis."
The Cardinal's second-place fin
ish was followed by USC and UC-
Irvine, respectively. It is unknown
how many PCIYRA teams will ad
vance to the national championship
in St. Petersburg, but Bourdow
guesses that the district should re
ceive at least three berths.
Though they did not bring home
the district championship, the Stan
ford women return to train for next
weekend's PCIYRA coed dinghy
championship at Cal State-Mon
terey.
After the district race, the
women will focus on sailing in 420's,
the boat in which they will compete
in for the ICYRA women's nation
al championship, after a season of
West-Coast racing in Flying Ju
niors. The team's 420s are currently
being used in university sailing
classes, so coaches will have to pre
pare them for competition. The
Cardinal's late start in practicing
with the 420s may hurt it in the na
tional regatta, but it is due to their
