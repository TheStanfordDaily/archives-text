### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team (16-4) proved this weekend
that its dominating force extends
past teams in the Women's West
ern Lacrosse League. The women
traveled to UC-Santa Barbara this
weekend to see how their play com
pares with that of teams from
Southern California. Again the
Cardinal came away on top with a
13-9 victory.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE

â–  Saturday: Stanford (16-4) 13, U(
Santa Barbara 9.

The four-goal victory was rela
tively close for the Cardinal, which
has recently had wins ranging any
where from eight to 15 goals. Al
though head coach Heidi Connor
said the tougher competition was a
welcome change for the Cardinal,
the team for the most part was dis
appointed with its play.
"The lead never dropped below
three goals, but it felt closer than
that. UCSB came out for the win,
and they were intense," Connor
said. "We never really got control
of the game."
The disappointment of the play
ers shows their strong desire for
perfection and their inability to set
tle for anything less than their best

play. To most teams a three-goal
lead would be a comfortable posi
tion, but for the Cardinal it just
wasn't good enough.
"We were unhappy with our
game this weekend because we did
not play at the same level that we
have been playing." said freshman
Patti Zettler. "We had a mental let
down, and our play was sloppy."
Sophomore Kate Reilly agreed.
"Although we came out with a
win and it was rewarding to beat a
team from the South, we didn't play
as good lacrosse as we can." Reilly
said.
Despite a discouraging game
and a frustrating result, the women
were able to take away some posi
tive aspects of the game. With the
tournament only a week away, it
was good for the team to have a
game to work out all its kinks and a
reality check that it won't necessar
ily be able to clobber every team it
meets.
"We were distracted and
weren't completely there or psy
ched up," said junior Christina Gi
lyutin. "It was a good lesson, be
cause if we're not focused on our
game things can go pretty badly.
We need to keep that in mind as we
finish our season."
Connor also noted some impor
tant aspects of the team's game that
didn't work so well against Santa
