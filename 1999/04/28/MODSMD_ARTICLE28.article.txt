Rose Payne, acclaimed professor
emerita at the Medical Center, died
April 18 at the age of 89 in Santa
Clara. Payne's research on tissue
compatibility made significant con
tributions to the field of immunology
and organ transplantation.
She began work at Stanford as a
research assistant after World War
11. Payne was among only a few sci
entists worldwide responsible for the
discovery of the human leukocyte
antigen system of genetic markers.
Before the discovery of these pro
teins, doctors could only determine
organ transplant compatibility by
matching donor and recipient blood
types. HLA markers have also en
hanced understanding of autoim
mune diseases such as diabetes and
arthritis.
"Rose was a superb, meticulous,
insightful scientist and friend,"
Pathology Prof. Carl Cirumet said.
' >he wasoneol onlyasmal! num
ber of women who obtained such
prominence and respect. She was a
pioneer in achieving parity for
women," he added.
Leon Rosenberg, professor emer
itus of microbiology and immunolo
gy, said Payne's research, along with
the work of others, helped make pos
sible the widespread application of

tissue grafting.
Although Payne worked at Stan
ford for more than 30 years, she was
not named professor until she asked
for the position in 1972, only three
years before her retirement, "it was a
long-overdue acknowledgment,"
(irumet said.
Rosenberg said Payne, a close
friend, began her career when "op
portunities were poor for every
body" and didn't harbor any bitter
ness about her status at Stanford,
choosing instead to focus on her re
search.
In 1984 the American Society for
Histocompatability honored her
with the Rose Payne Distinguished
Scientist Award. In an interview pub
lished on the society's Web site,
Payne recalled the Medical School as
a "gentleman'sschool for the well-to
do and the very poor It was not a
research institution. There were very
few women on the staff."
Payne was also honored by the
American Association Of Blood
Banks and was the first Stanford sci
entist chosen to give the Katharine
I). McCormick Distinguished Lec
ture at Stanford in 1980.
Payne was born on Aug. 5. 1909,
in Lake Bay. Wash. She received a
doctorate in bacteriology from the
University of Washington in 1937
and is survived by her sister Violet
Russell and a nephew.
