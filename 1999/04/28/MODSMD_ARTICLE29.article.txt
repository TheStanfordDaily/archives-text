â–  Yesterday: Stanford (30-12) 8, San
lose State (21-23-1) 3.

I asi night, though, Wayne had to
don his spikes and shed the jacket
head coach Mark Marquess was
stinting him on the mound against
San Jose State. Following his one-in
ning. seven-run outing Saturday at
Berkeley, Wayne certainly needed
the work.
I lowever. a solid three-inning ef
fort. which helped the Cardinal (30-
I 1 ) to an 8-3 victory over the Spartans
(21 23-1). eased any concerns Mar
quess or Wayne might have had.
It's hard to come back after an
outing like Saturday, but they gave
me the chance to pitch today and it
turned out well," Wayne said.
I t icl.iv I was really working on keep
ing the ball down. You do that, you're
going to get ahead of a lot of batters."
In his three innings. Wayne al
lowed no runs on two hits while strik
ing out four. I le was pulled to rest up
for his scheduled start this Saturday
against ()regon State and to give
other pitchers time on the mound.
'We wanted to make sure he got
some work this week." Marquess
said. I le only threw 40 pitches or so
Saturday, so we wanted to get him a
good workout. It went well."
An eight run Stanford second in
ning made evervthinu easier on

Wayne, though. Senior third base
man Josh Hochgesang, junior first
baseman John Gall and sophomore
center fielder Hilly Jacobson all
smacked two-run doubles in the in
ning, as the ( ardinal scored six of its
runs with two outs.
The game marked the second
straight contest in which Stanford has
scored eight runs in an inning. Sunday
at Cal the Cardinal notched eight in
the eighth en route to a 13-5 victory.
Freshman Mike Wodnicki, senior
Tony Cogan and freshman J.I). Will
cox all saw time on the mound in re
lief.
Wodnicki, coming off two disap
pointing appearances against Cal
and USC. followed Wayne to the
mound to start the fourth inning but
struggled again. He walked in a run
and gave up two costly hits, includ
ing a two-run single by San Jose
State senior Todd Duncan in the
fifth inning.
Cogan took back control for the
Cardinal, though, looking sharp in his
two-plus innings on the mound. Fol
lowing two disappointing appear
ances in important Pac-10 games,
('ogan again seemed in charge on the
mound, striking out three while walk
ing none.
Saturday at Cal Willcox turned in
a clutch performance out of the
bullpen, allowing no hits in four in
nings. His work kept the Cardinal
close enough to forge an extra-inning,
11-10 comeback win after Wayne and
freshman Mike Gosling gave up 10
runs in just over two innings.
Last night, Willcox turned in an
other fine performance, allowing no
hits or runs in two innings. After giv
ing up a crucial grand slam in Stan
ford's 17-15 loss to USC a week ago
Sunday, Willcox has now pitched six
straight no-hit innings.
"He's done a good job for us,"
Marquess said. "He has gone in and

thrown a couple pitches for strikes
and with good location. Normally
we've gotten hurt because we haven't
thrown enough strikes, but he's been
sharp."
Junior Damien Alvarado, whose
.355 average is second on the team,
got the night off behind the plate after
starting the Cardinal's first 41 straight
games. Junior John Salter, who had
only four at-bats in five previous
games, took Alvarado's place at
catcher and got a hit in four at-bats to
keep his average at .250.
