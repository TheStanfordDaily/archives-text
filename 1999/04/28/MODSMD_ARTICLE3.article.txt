# Nat'l gender salary inequity continues
## 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
A recent survey of faculty
salaries demonstrates that the
long-standing national trend of
gender inequality in faculty
salaries still exists. The study, con
ducted by the American Associa
tion of University Professors, was
published in the Chronicle of
I ligher Education last week.
At Stanford, administrators
have been trying to "catch-up"
salary increases for years, consid
ering the salaries of women profes
sors on a case by case basis.
The average salary for male full
professors at all institutions of
higher education in the 1998-99
school year, as reported by the sur
vey, was 14 percent higher than
that of women in the same posi
tion. For assistant professors, the
difference was 6.8 percent.

Male full professors at private
research universities earned
$99,979 compared to the $90,611
earned by their female colleagues,
a difference of 10.3 percent. This
percentage remained the same for
public research universities,
where, though the salaries are
lower than those of their counter
parts at private universities, male
full professors earned an average
$80,379 to the $72,885 female full
professors received.
Specific figures are not avail
able for Stanford in this area.
However, according to Robert
Weisberg. vice provost for faculty
relations, "On the whole, you
wouldn't expect to see a differ
ence. Salary at this point is basical
ly gender-neutral."
Weisberg continued saying,
"There have been pockets around
the University where we've tried to
help faculty catch up where they've
been underpaid when they
shouldn't have, which occurs espe
cially with senior faculty women."
Despite the discrepancy in aver
age actual salaries for male and fe
male faculty, the overall increase in
salaries at all institutions, including
public, private and non-secular, re
flects other variations. In the 1997-
98 school year, female faculty of all
ranks received an average 3.0 per
cent salary increase, while their
male peers received a 3.4 percent
increase.
The 1998-99 figures were con
siderably higher, showing an aver
age increase of 3.8 percent for male
faculty of all ranks and, for female
faculty, an even higher average
gain of 4.1 percent.

The sometimes higher averages
for women result, in large part,
from the attempts by universities to
equali/.e salaries along gender lines
where they may not have been
equal before.
"Salary increases at the Univer
sity are extremely similar, with the
possibility that if you did a formal
study the percentage increase for
women might be slightly higher,
but I doubt that there's any real dif
ference. I would emphasize that
this is very person-specific," Weis
berg said.
"Salaries are calculated on an
individual basis and any discrepan
cies that may exist are dealt with in
this way as well," he said.
The additional issues of equality
across departmental and racial
lines were not examined by the
AAUP study, though it is entirely
possible that inequity does exist
within these arenas nationally.
Average pay varies widely

across departments. It is based on
the salaries of professionals in each
field and the differences between
the pay of professionals in one field
versus another.
However, given this market in
equality, the average pay increase
is still roughly the same for all de
partments, according to Weisberg.
Moreover, "There doesn't seem to
be any inequity in salaries for mi
norities once you account for se
niority," Weisberg said.
Additionally, according to
Weisberg, the 5.1 percent faculty
salary increase originally designat
ed to Stanford by the A A UP re
port may be higher than the actual
average pay increase received by
University faculty. This number re
flects the difference in total salaries
paid from year to year.
Universities generally have a
higher percent increase in salary
than indicated by this calculation.
This stems from the fact that new

faculty members tend to enter at a
lower level and, consequently, are
not as well paid as those generally
high-ranking faculty members who
have left, thereby lowering the
"snapshot" average salary increase
figure.
The AAUP survey calculates
the average salary increase of con
tinuing faculty, those who have re
mained at the same institution, sep
arately. The continuing faculty
number more accurately repre
sents the individual salary increase
and is generally one percentage
point higher than the overall aver
age.
This trend, however, does not
mirror the current situation at
Stanford. "Our actual salary in
crease, when considering only con
tinuing faculty, could be as much as
a percent lower than the "snapshot
figure," because the University
hired a lot of high-salary senior fac
ulty this year."
