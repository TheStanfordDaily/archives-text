# Greeks assess Rush outcome
## 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
Having spent the last month re
cruiting rushees, most of Stanford's
Greek organizations are finding
themselves with a brand new class
of pledges. Although rushees de
cided among Greek groups with
varying characteristics, such as
housed versus unhoused, or large
versus small, most Greek organiza
tions felt the rush process went
well, and each garnered a strong
group of new members.
According to senior Hans
Hartvickson, president of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. running a fraternity
well "takes a combination of things.
It takes a group of guys that is self
perpetuating and creates a strong
nucleus. Great events and parties
are not as important as having a
great group of guys."
Membership
This concept of "self-perpetua

tion" is important for all Greek or
ganizations, as recruiting large
pledge classes is vital to maintain
ing the group. This year, SAE
needed to admit 28 new members
to keep its house going and at
tained this "without much prob
lem," accepting 30 new members,
according to Hartvickson. "It's
true of every fraternity that they
need to fill their house to keep
their house, but we needed a rather
large [pledge] class this year," he
added.
Being able to keep up member
ship has become a real concern for
frats, according to Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe.
"Within the past five to 10 years,
interest [in joining fraternities] has
declined while more chapters have
surfaced. Not that there's anything
wrong with smaller chapters; there
have been a number of successful
ones, but there is a question of sup
ply and demand."
Nevertheless, Howe said she
thought some fraternities saw a
"huge" amount of interest this year.
While exact numbers are un
available, Howe estimated that IS
percent of undergraduate males be
long to fraternities, while 13 percent
of undergraduate females belong to
sororities. "The number of girls in
sororities has remained constant for
the past three years," she said.
Housing
"Our rush went really well,"
said Delta Delta Delta President
Allison McGowen, a junior,
"We've been seeing incredible in
terest for the past couple years,
even though the fact that we're
housed can be a turn-off."
On the other hand, a housed
sorority may have been just what
some pledges were looking for."I
think the girls that wanted to go
housed went housed and the girls
that wanted to go unhoused went
unhoused. It balanced out really
well for us," said junior Taya
C'romley, president of Kappa
Kappa Gamma.
There are currently two housed
and three unhoused sororities on
campus, compared with six housed
and seven unhoused fraternities.
According to McGowen, this is
a reasonable discrepancy since
"sorority life isn't as important for
girls as fraternity life is for guys.
There are a lot of things that girls
take advantage of — overseas stud

ies, for example — that I don't see
guys doing."
"If there were more sororities
on campus, I don't think there
would be more girls joining sorori
ties," she said.
Cromley, however, disagreed.
"I think the opposite might be
true. Our numbers went up this
year, but I've heard that a lot of frat
numbers have been going down.
Also, sororities are bigger. We
have about 75 girls in our organiza
tion, while a big frat might only
have 50 guys," she said.
Fraternity members junior
Jamie Deutsch and sophomore
Sam Ogami, rush chairmen for
Alpha Epsilon Pi and Phi Kappa
Psi, respectively, had positive feel
ings about this year's rush. "This is
our biggest pledge class ever,"
Deutsch said. "In fact, each of the
last four years, our pledge class has
gotten bigger."
Facing Stereotypes
In terms of numbers, Ogami
called Phi Psi's rush was "very posi
tive." He said that having a success
ful Greek organization involves
"going out and really making an ef
fort to show you're not a typical fra
ternity, that you're not some
stereotypical "animal house,' but a
good group of guys who are all dif
ferent. You need to show [rushees]
the benefits of joining a fraternity.
You need to get to know people so
they can get to know you."
Junior Tim Fisher. Inter-Frater
nity Council vice president in
charge of recruitment, was able to
get a bird's-eye view of this year's

recruitment process. "This year's
turnout has been very similar to last
year's. On the whole, most chapters
got what they wanted. In fact, over
the past live years, things have pret
ty much stayed the same."
This was true, Fisher added,
even though some fraternities were
disheartened by the turnout at
their initial rush events. "It's hard
to tell on the first nights of rush, he
cause some chapters get over
looked — some house might have
been having a really interesting ac
tivity that night, for instance — but
it all seemed to balance out by the
end of rush."
Fisher said even Theta Xi. which
lost its house at the end of last year
due to a shortage of members, re
ported halfway through rush that it

was getting a large turnout. Theta
Xi president Nicholas Cherov, a ju
nior, indicated that their pledge
class is still unfinalized. He said he
was satisfied, though "not entirely
happy" with this year's rush out
come since there was not as much
pressure to attain new members as
in years past.
Lambda Phi Epsilon Rush
Chairman Keith Chan, a senior,
also expressed some feelings of dis
content. "Our numbers were a little
low this year, but we're happy with
the quality of the pledges we got."
Reflecting the overall sentiment
of Greek organizations, he added
that the strength of his organiza
tion lies in the brotherhood shared
by its members rather than the size
of each pledge class.
