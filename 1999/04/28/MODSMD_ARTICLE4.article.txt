# Greeks assess Rush outcome
## 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
Having spent the last month re
cruiting rushees, most of Stanford's
Greek organizations are finding
themselves with a brand new class
of pledges. Although rushees de
cided among Greek groups with
varying characteristics, such as
housed versus unhoused, or large
versus small, most Greek organiza
tions felt the rush process went
well, and each garnered a strong
group of new members.
According to senior Hans
Hartvickson, president of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. running a fraternity
well "takes a combination of things.
It takes a group of guys that is self
perpetuating and creates a strong
nucleus. Great events and parties
are not as important as having a
great group of guys."
Membership
This concept of "self-perpetua

tion" is important for all Greek or
ganizations, as recruiting large
pledge classes is vital to maintain
ing the group. This year, SAE
needed to admit 28 new members
to keep its house going and at
tained this "without much prob
lem," accepting 30 new members,
according to Hartvickson. "It's
true of every fraternity that they
need to fill their house to keep
their house, but we needed a rather
large [pledge] class this year," he
added.
Being able to keep up member
ship has become a real concern for
frats, according to Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe.
"Within the past five to 10 years,
interest [in joining fraternities] has
declined while more chapters have
surfaced. Not that there's anything
wrong with smaller chapters; there
have been a number of successful
ones, but there is a question of sup
ply and demand."
