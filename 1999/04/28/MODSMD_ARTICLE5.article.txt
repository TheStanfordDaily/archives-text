# Unclean needles create problem
## Phlebotomist found to be reusing syringes in studies 
### Alice Brown Staff writer 
Stanford officials have confirmed
that a blood worker at a Smith-Kline
Beecham blood drawing station
reused disposable needles on pa
tients in Stanford research studies,
threatening the safety of patients
and the integrity of research done by
the University.
Every person who had blood
drawn by this particular worker have
been asked to undergo tests for he
patitis and HIV. "I'm not sure of
the extent to which Stanford was af
fected by this problem," said Chris
Scott, director of the Stanford Re
search Management Group.
It is unknown exactly how many
people involved in Stanford studies

came into contact with the techni
cian or which studies the worker was
assisting.
Investigators also said the techni
cian mislabeled at least one sample
from one of the thousands of pa
tients who had blood drawn there,
according to the San Jose Mercury
News.
It was not until the worker's be
havior became public on April 16
that Stanford learned of this occur
rence.
Over the past week and a half
state health officials have "deter
mined her inappropriate conduct
was even more widespread, poten
tially calling into question the results
of every blood test she ever per-
formed," the Mercury News said.
Scott said that psychiatric studies
had a couple hundred people in
volved. though that number could
not be confirmed.
"Obviously this is an unexpected
curve ball." Dr. Lawrence Shuer.
Stanford's hospital and clinics chief
ol stall, told the San Jose Mercury
News. "It goes without saying no
body in this day and age would have
ever expected something like this to
happen."
Stanford officials said they will
need to review the studies on a case
by-case basis to determine whether
any research has been irrevocable
tainted.
It is not known whether or not the
mislabeled blood samples were those
of Stanford research patients.
The woman told officials that she

washed the s\ ringes in hydrogen per
oxide after each use. but although
this kills bacteria it does not kill virus
es.
Scientists from other universities
have raised the issue of Stanford's re
search as a whole being tarnished.
"Credibility is a big issue for re
search and getting future volunteers
for your studies," Margene
Kennedy, manager of the clinical tri
als unit at Johns 1 lopkins University,
told the Mercury News. She added
that if anyone were infected with a
disease as a result of their participa
tion in a study, people would lose
confidence in volunteering for stud
ies.
It is possible that the results of
Stanford studies will be deemed in
valid.
Kennedy told the Mercury News
that "contaminated laboratory re
sults could easily alter a researcher's
conclusions about how a treatment
being tested on patients works."
