# Kennedy examines use of 'nigger'
## 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
Harvard Law Prof. Randall Kennedy, a
specialist on race and the law, traced the use
of the word "nigger" Monday night in the first
of two talks he is giving for this year's Tanner
lectures in human values.
The title of Kennedy's talk. "Who Can Say
Nigger? ... and Other Related Questions,"
was provocative enough to begin discussion of
the question even before the lecture began. In
his introduction. University President Ger
hard Casper related how one person, on ob
serving the lecture's title, said "He'd better be
black," referring to Kennedy.
It was a fitting anecdote to begin
Kennedy's talk. Does someone have to be
African American to say "nigger"? Kennedy
would say no. But it's a little more complicat
ed than that.
"Nigger is a key word in the lexicon of race
relations and therefore an important term in
American politics," Kennedy said. "To be ig
norant of its meaning is to be vulnerable to all
manner of peril."
In one recent case David Howard, an aide
to Washington, D.C., Mayor Anthony

Williams, resigned alter using the word "nig
gardly" in a meeting. He used the word cor
rectly, to mean "miserly" or "stingy." But its
similarity to "nigger" caused a flurry of ru
mors that Howard had used the racial epithet.
Williams initially accepted Howard's resigna
tion. hut he has since been reinstated.
Kennedy contends that "nigger" is not the
same as other racial epithets— he likened it
to the "nuclear bomb of racial epithets." In a
computer search that he conducted, the word
"nigger" appeared in more than 800 court
opinions — much more frequently than other
racial slurs such as "chink" or "gook" (17
opinions) and "kike" (five opinions).
"The word 'nigger' sums up all the bitter
years of insult and struggle in America,"
Kennedy said. "It's like a red flag to a bull."
He also reminded his audience that the slur
was invoked in the Littleton, Colo., school
shooting. Victim Isaiah Shoels was called
"nigger" by one of the gunmen before he was
shot to death.
So it is strange to think of "nigger" being
used in a comic sense or as a term of endear
ment. But Kennedy insisted that these mean-

ings belong to the word just as the
most vile racial hatred does. And
he defended the right to use the
word with these other meanings,
though critics would rather "nig
ger" be shunned from use and con
lined to the museum of language.
Citing the comedy routines of
Chris Rock and the films of Spike
Lee among other examples,
Kennedy defended the place of
"nigger" in American culture.
"I enjoy and admire a portion of
the cultural work in which 'nigger'
is embedded." he said. "1 savor
these performances, and without
them, our culture would be signifi
cantly diminished."
But what happens when a white

person uses the word "nigger"? Is it
ever OK? Kennedy said it depends
on the context.
"The meaning of words — all
words, including 'nigger' — is con
tingent. changeable and context
specific." Kennedy said.
Still, given the salience of the
word as a racial epithet, Kennedy
suggested that people generally
frown on its use, regardless of the
race of the speaker.
The second part of Kennedy's
lecture will be held tonight in
Building 320. Room 105. He will
speak about the role of "nigger" in
the law of evidence and homicide
and is expected to focus on the O.J.
Simpson murder trial. There will
also be a follow-up discussion ses
