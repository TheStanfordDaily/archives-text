GERARD K. O'NEILL
1926- 1992
GERARD: We never met, I know and yet,
I know you well my friend,
And if ever I, get to heaven on high,
1 hope you'll shake my hand.*
Just like G.K.O'Neill, all his predecessor advocates' efforts
to give our Space goals a direction have fallen on deaf ears.
Let's give up following the bunglers & finally get started in
the right direction. That is Space Colonization on G.K.O'Ncill
Model with a new grass roots type organization.
