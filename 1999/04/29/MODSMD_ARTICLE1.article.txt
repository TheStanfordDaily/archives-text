# Campuses protest sweatshop goods
## Nat'l outcry muted on Farm 
### Deborah Roth 
Early this year, student activists at
major universities nationwide staged
sit-ins to protest the manufacturing of
their university apparel in sweat
shops. They demanded full disclo
sure of factory locations, mandatory
living wages, women's and childrens'
rights and the improvement of health
and safety standards in factories pro
ducing university clothing.
As the protest continues, voices at
Stanford are still silent. "There hasn't
been too much going on here," said

Ethan Kaplan, a doctoral student in
economics and a member of the Stu
dent Labor Action Coalition.
Stanford, however, seems to be
one of the few universities remaining
uninvolved. Harvard, Princeton,
Yale, Cornell, Brown and 12 other in
stitutions affiliated themselves with
the Fair Labor Association in mid-
March. while students are continuing
protests against this affiliation.
According to Daniel Hennefeld, a
senior at Harvard and a member of
the university's student labor move
ment. " The F LA is tin) much con
trolled by the corporations, we can't
trust the industry to monitor them
selves."
In addition to the universities, the
I LA is also made up of seven promi
nent manufacturers, among them
Reebok, Nike and Li/ Claiborne, as
well as several human rights groups.
It grew out of the White House Ap
parel Industry Partnership, an effort
o! the Clinton administration to
counter sweatshops.
Student defenders of human
lights criticized the association for
giving too much control to these cor
porations. I lie association, however,
proclaims its goal as providing public
aceountabilty lor companies and a
system of monitoring.
Michael Posner, a member of the
association and executive director of

the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights at Harvard told the Harvard
( rimson, "(the FLA] is a credible sys
tem of public oversight."
A group of congressmen, howev
er, disagreed with Posner's view
point. They urged California univer
sities not to join the FLA. They ar
gued that the association failed to
meet the human rights demands of
the students and that it did not secure
the students an equal position in the
formulation of a code of eonduct.
Daniel Weiss, press secretary and
chief of stall for Rep. George Miller
(l)-Calif.), one of the congressmen
who signed the letter, called the FLA
"the lowest common denominator."
Weiss said the association represents
an adequate first step, but its exclu
sion of student viewpoints leaves it in
c< implete.
When asked whether Stanford
should join the FLA. Weiss said. "No.
[Stanford] should adopt a strong code
of conduct, but not associate with the
FLA until such time as students are

lull partners in defining a code."
At present, Weiss has little reason
to be concerned about Stanford join
ing the F LA. According to Kaplan,
there is apathy at Stanford.
"You know how Stanford deals
with these issues; it doesn't," Kaplan
said.
Senior Jill Shenker, a member of
SLAC, agreed with Kaplan and spec
ulated that Stanford's lack of involve
ment in this nationwide concern may
be because, "we are just an over
worked community. She added that,
"this is probably not the right political
moment to raise this issue."
Kaplan also saw Stanford's reluc
tance to promote joining the coalition
as a lost chance to activate the student
body.
"Had Stanford joined [the FLA) it
could have spurred on student ac
tivism." he said.
Both members pointed out that
their organization has planned to
focus on local rather than national is
sues.
