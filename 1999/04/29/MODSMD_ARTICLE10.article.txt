# Most Americans expect ground war in Yugoslavia
## Polls support Kosovo policy 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
majority of Americans support
President Clinton's policy on
Yugoslavia, but are divided on the
effectiveness of the NATO
airstrikes and most expect a ground
war, two new polls find.
About six out of 10 said they
expect the United States will get
involved in a ground war, according
to an ABC / Washington Post poll
released yesterday. Gauging the
level of support for sending ground
troops into combat remained elu
sive.
A Gallup poll released yesterday
suggested more than a 10-point
drop in support for ground troops
over the last two weeks, to about 40
percent favoring the use of ground
troops if the bombing does not

work.
An ABC / Washington Post poll
indicated a majority favor ground
troops being sent to end the conflict
if the airstrikes do not succeed. That
support drops below 50 percent in
the ABC / Post poll if using ground
troops will cost U.S. casualties.
Almost two-thirds of Democrats
supported the use of ground troops,
more than half of independents and
just over four in 10 Republicans,
according to the ABC / Post poll.
The Pentagon said this week it
will call more than 33,000 reservists
to active duty in the first nonvolun
tary call : up since the airstrikes
began March 24.
Gary Langer, polling director for
ABC, said the ABC I Post poll indi
cated the public is sticking behind

the NATO effort for now.
"The public is expressing quite a
lot of tolerance for the pace and the
conduct of the allied military action
to date," Langer said. "We don't
see a public that is ready to cut and
run."
The president's overall job
approval was at 60 percent in both
polls, and approval of his handling
of the Kosovo situation was about
l
five points lower in both polls.
While the public may be stand
ing behind the president and the
NATO mission, people are far from
certain about the mission's success.
Just under half in the ABC / Post
poll said the United States and its
allies were winning the conflict
while about that many said Serbia
was winning or neither side was.
