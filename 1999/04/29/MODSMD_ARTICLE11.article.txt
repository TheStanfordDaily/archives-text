WASHINGTON (AP) — Government officials
claimed victory yesterday in round one of their battle
with business over future Internet taxes when a corpo
rate executive stepped down from a panel created by
Congress to examine the issue.
The decision by Netscape Communications chief
James Barksdale to resign from the panel allowed Sen
ate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to appoint
another local official and restore the private-public bal
ance originally envisioned by Congress.
"This is a solid victory for counties and local gov
ernment," said Betty Lou Ward, president of the
National Association of Counties.
After Lott's move, the National Association of
Counties and U.S. Conference of Mayors agreed to
drop a federal lawsuit that has prevented the 19-mem
ber panel from meeting. It was supposed to begin work
in December and now will tentatively hold its first
meeting June 22 in Williamsburg, Va.
The Advisory Commission on Electronic Com

merce was created last year when Congress passed a
three-year moratorium on new Internet taxes. The
panel's purpose is to recommend by next year the 1
international, federal, state and local tax policy for fast- ]
growing online commerce. '
The lawsuit contended the original appointments by y
congressional leaders violated the law by naming too!
few people from state and local governments — and;
one too many from business. That imbalance, state and;
local officials said, could have skewed the panel's rec-.'
ommendations in favor of business and hurt legitimate
tax interests of their governments.
Lott replaced Barksdale with Delna Jones, a county',
commissioner in Washington County, Ore., who is also'
a former Oregon state legislator. She spent 30 years':
with U.S. West Communications.
Barksdale agreed to step aside, Lott said in a state-'
ment, because "the issues surrounding the Internet are,
too important to let the commission's business be
delayed any longer."
