Indirect cost scandal
that crippled Stanford
now a distant memory

Last week, the u.s.
Supreme Court let stand a
decision that effectively ended
the University's indirect-cost scandal,
which was responsible for eight years
of lawsuits, a $1.2 million settlement
and the resignation of a University
president.
Funny thing, it was no big deal on
campus.
The scandal led to the resignation
of former University President Don
ald Kennedy in 1992 and a congres
sional debate over what research
costs could be billed to taxpayers. Its
effects also spread towards other
renowned research institutions such
as Harvard.
For a scandal that crippled the Uni
versity administration and finances
and caused nearly a decade of after
math and related costs, it sure seems
to have died a quiet death.
Students, new and old, should real
ize the relative importance of the indi
rect-cost scandal in University history
and in the nation as a whole.
The scandal blackened Stanford's
name in the eyes of the federal gov
ernment and the nation. Hie end of

the scandal will help to absolve the
University somewhat in the eyes of
others. At least for those who remem
ber it.
Simply put, we got lucky.
'I"he nation's highest court said that
the dismissal of a 1991 lawsuit by Paul
Riddle on behalf of the federal gov
ernment was appropriate. Biddle's
lawsuit and ensuing appeal was reject
ed by the U.S. Court of Appeals last
May and finally last week in the
Supreme Court. In a statement, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper said
that "this truly puts an end to this
matter."
ITie suit accused Stanford of over
billing the Office of Naval Research
by nearly $2(M) million for so-called
"indirect costs" which are not directly
related to research.
An investigation said that Stanford
had billed the Navy for depreciation
on a yacht and costs related to the
Stanford Shopping Center, among
others.
'ITiere are lessons to be learned and
remembered here. Keeping Universi
ty finances in check is invaluable and
might save it from undue headache at
some point down the line.
The indirect-cost scandal must
remain in the minds of all students
and members of the University. Its
death marks the end of an era, albeit
anticlimactically.
