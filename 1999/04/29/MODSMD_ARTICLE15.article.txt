# Campus Viewpoint: Chris Henderson
## Looming life choices 
### 
Last week
end's deluge of
prospective fresh
men on campus gave us all
a chance to recapture what
our lives were like in the
spring of our senior year in
high school.

With finals coming up and graduation
celebrations still to be planned, we had
much on our schedules and on our minds.
We might have needed to decide whom to
take to the Prom. And. of course, we were
facing a much bigger decision, likely the
most significant of our young lives and one
that was on the mind of many a pro fro last
weekend: where to go to college.
Remember when chcxjsing a school was
the toughest decision you had to make?
Sure, it seemed like an incredibly important
decision at the time. Yet now it seems to
pale in comparison to the choice we are
asked to make four years later.
What do you plan to do after graduation?
It's scary to even write the words, let
alone mutter them aloud. It's the question
that most of us achingly dread. Oh, to be
young and simply be chwsing a major! Any
thing but having to make decisions about
what to do with our ... (gulp)... lives.
It's frightening to think of leaving life on
a college campus, living alone and no longer
being surrounded by throngs of people who
are your age. Apartments and jobs are terri
fying prospects for the inexperienced.
For some of us, these fears are so intense
that we effectively put off making the what

to-do-with-my-life decision. Instead, we
return to the choice of four years earlier:
where to go to school.
Many students go to graduate schools
because they have already made the what
to-do-with-my-life decision and know that
grad school is a necessary step in their newly
chosen path. Yet there arc others who use
graduate school as a delaying tactic, a means
by which to avoid leaving school and there
by continue living on a college campus while
putting off the "big" decision.
Just a few days ago, a friend and I dis
cussed the possibility of law school. We
decided that as juniors, we could take LSAT
prep classes this summer, take the test in the
lall. apply to schools after graduation and
take a year off (yet another splendid means
of delay). At this point, going to law school
was looking pretty darn good. Of course, as
we reached the end of the conversation we
were forced to breach the more significant
questions. Why go to law school? What kind
of law would you want to practice? Do you
even want to be an attorney? All of a sud
den. law school was looking a little less
attractive.
So I, for one, decided that day's answer
was getting a doctoral degree. In something.
But for some of us, delay is not an option.
Some of us don't have the means to delay.
Mom and Dad have made it relatively clear
that we will be making the what-to-do-with
my-life decision before commencement.
Making this decision at 21 or 22 is pretty
scary. I don't know about the rest of you, but
I often feel about 13.1 fear utter disaster liv

ing on my own. I see visions of forgetting to
pay my bills and having the water and the
heat turned off. 1 see my inability to cook
anything other than Spaghetti-O's being
harmful to my health. I see A little girl try
ing to play grown up.
Yet somehow. I know that "preparing for
the real world" is what the last four years
since choosing a college have been all about.
No, I'm not alluding to academic prepara
tion, the kind that would teach me some
marketable skill (please, I'm a poli sci
major). In fact, I mean something much dif
ferent.
My parents say they sent me to Stanford
not only to learn but to live with intelligent
and interesting people. For the last three
years, by opening my mind to new worlds
and by fostering my growth in innumerable
ways, friends, professors and neighbors have
helped me prepare for the big decision. My
years at Stanford have given me a much bet
ter defined sense of self, more confidence,
increased ambition and a sense of indepen
dence.
Right now I have little to no idea what I
want to do with myself. And it's a little
frightening. But I have a feeling that just as I
was able to choose a college. Til be ready to
make the decision when the time comes. I
hope.

be ready, but she'll come up with something.
Right?
