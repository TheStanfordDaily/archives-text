Pro Fro incident shows larger campus alcohol problem

This year's Admit Weekend was historic,
and not only for record attendance. For the
first time in the history of Admit Weekend,
one prospective freshman was taken to the
hospital for alcohol poisoning and another
was nursed back to consciousness after
passing out in the Rinconada lounge.
In the wake of these two events, it is
important not to focus on whom to blame,
but rather to consider how to prevent inci
dents like these from happening again.
Unfortunately, drinking has become a
standard part of the college experience.
Most of the prospective freshmen probably
arrived at Admit Weekend expecting to be
exposed to the full gambit of experiences
''Stanford has to offer. And even though the
'•weekend's programmed activities such as
lectures by Nobel Prize winners, hiking to
the dish or visiting the art museum are
indeed integral parts of being at Stanford,
'so, for many students, is "getting wasted" on
Tthe weekends.
In the case of these two prospective
freshmen and the people they interacted
•with this weekend, it is important to keep in
mind that the events that transpired were,
•more than anything, a product of the envi
ronment in which the prospective freshmen
'were staying and cannot necessarily be pin
-pointed to the actions of a specific individu
al or individuals.
As the coordinators of last year's Admit
'Weekend, we have firsthand knowledge of
'the spirit and dedication of the students who
volunteer as house hosts and room hosts.

They sacrifice an enormous amount of time
both prior to and during the event to wel
come the prospective freshmen and present
Stanford in a positive manner. Their
responsibilities do not include babysitting.
Room hosts and house hosts are general
ly freshmen themselves, only a year older
than the prospective freshmen and there
fore do not possess the adequate authority
to strictly regulate the prospective fresh
men's behavior. The room hosts' technical
designation is simply to provide floor space
for their prospective freshmen to sleep,
while house hosts act as a more involved,
responsible support network, attending
meals and events with prospective fresh
men, showing them around campus and
interacting socially with them. Throughout
house host training, the issue of potential
alcohol liability is heavily emphasized, and
volunteers are expressly instructed to keep
prospective freshmen away from situations
in which alcohol might be present and not to
provide them with alcohol. However, if a
prospective freshman actively seeks out
alcohol or is determined to drink despite
these precautions, the house host or room
host can only be expected, as a peer and out
of concern for his or her own personal safe
ty, to discourage the behavior.
In these two cases, the prospective fresh
men were acting of their own accords and
probably could not have been stopped no
matter what actions were taken on the part
of room hosts or house hosts.
The problem at hand is much larger than

the supposed lack of action on the part of an
individual room host in preventing his
prospective freshman from consuming alco
hol. Instead of sweeping the problem at
hand aside by taking disciplinary recourse
for one room host, we should be focusing on
the fact that few preventative measures cur
rently exist to control alcohol abuse and
educate students on the risks and choices
they will face in college, including social
alcohol consumption.
The two incidents that occurred this past
weekend, in addition to the prevalence of
alcohol-related incidents at Stanford in the
past two years, indicate a need for an alco
hol training and education program to be
implemented at Stanford.
Students need to be educated on how
alcohol affects their choices and their
health, how their actions impact others and
that there are repercussions for acting irre
sponsibly. Phis education is just as impor
tant, and definitely more important in terms
of making positive life choices, as an aca
demic education. The time has come to real
ize that a crisis exists at Stanford in terms of
excessive alcohol consumption and that stu
dents must be educated on this subject.
Part of entering college is learning how
to make responsible choices for oneself.
These incidents, however, are evidence that
many students, whether incoming or cur
rently at Stanford, are too immature to han
dle themselves as adults and moderate
drinkers. The fact remains that an enor
mous availability of alcohol exists at Stan

ford and that prospective freshmen are only
months away from actually enrolling here.
If they are drinking at Admit Weekend,
they will be drinking as freshmen, and the
same issues will remain. Steps must be
taken to improve alcohol education on this
campus.
We propose an in-depth program, facili
tated by Residential Education during Ori
entation and followed up throughout the
school year, that neither stigmatizes alcohol
nor encourages the formation of a social
alcohol culture. Moderation should be the
ultimate message.
In a year where college students around
the country have died in alcohol-related
incidents, it is obvious that the problem of
alcohol abuse will not simply vanish with
administrative action against one room
host. While this measure may discourage
future room hosts to allow their prospective
freshmen access to alcohol, it does not
address the larger problem of the central
importance of alcohol in University life.
This problem requires immediate attention
and proactive measures to stop it in its
tracks. Give students the power to help
themselves by making informed and adult
choices. That, more than anything they can
read in a textbook, will be one of the most
valuable lessons they take from the college
experience.
