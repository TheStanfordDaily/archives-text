## Sailers face not-so smooth spring Card races dinghies 
### Becky Blanchard Contributing writer 
NCAA basketball has its March
Madness, NCAA baseball has its
College World Series and ICYRA
sailing has a string of intense back
to-back spring qualifiers and na
tional championships that have
kept the Stanford sailing team very
busy this quarter.

SAILING
■ Saturday-Sunday: No. 16 Stanford
at the district coed dinghy champi
onships.

This weekend, the No. 16 Cardi
nal will compete in its third district
competition in as many weeks. The
Cardinal will vie with other Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Yacht Rac
ing Association teams in the dis
trict coed dinghy championship at
Monterey Bav.

'Monterey could give us
some tough conditions to
sail in—that's a really
good thing for our team.'
— Steve Burdow

Stanford hopes to finish well
enough to receive a national berth
but will have to rely on favorable
conditions and a flawless perfor
mance to overcome strong compe
tition.
No. 6 USC is the highest-ranked
team in the district and looks espe
cially tough this season with the ad
dition of two transfers from Navy,
who have had considerable success
with the Trojans this year.
"USC is the odds-on favorite,"
said Stanford head coach Steve
Bourdow.
Hawaii and UC-Santa Barbara
also pose threats to the Cardinal's
qualifying hopes. The 13th-ranked
Rainbow Warriors, who upset the
Stanford team in an impressive win
at the St. Francis Intersectional
earlier this spring, could push USC
for the lead.
The 15th-ranked Gauchos
sneaked past the Cardinal to take
second-place in the district team
racing competition and qualify for
the national championship. How
ever, Bourdow expects the Gau
chos, a fast team in flatwater condi
tions, to struggle in the winds ex
pected on Monterey Bay. Accord
ing to Bourdow, the Stanford
squad need to start strong and

avoid big errors to surpass Hawaii
and UC-Santa Barbara for a na
tional berth.
Stanford's lineup is undeter
mined and will be adjusted to fit
changing weather conditions.
Bourdow said that the team will
likely be the same group that com
peted in district team-racing cham
pionship two weeks ago.
Junior co-captain Tyler Doyle
will be joined by junior Anika
Leerssen and sophomore Heather
Porter, who are coming off impres
sive performances in last week
end's district women's dinghy com
petition.
"Anika and Alexis [Krivkovich]
looked really, really strong," said
Bourdow. "They have a focused
strength in heavy winds. If it's
windy, they'll be starting."
Sophomore Jeff Condon rounds
out the Cardinal's rotation of skip
pers. Krivkovich, junior Caroline
Sumpf and junior Katie Gregg will
serve as crew for Stanford's boats.
This year's Cardinal coed lineup
is somewhat unique in that it fea
tures so many members who also
compete in women's regattas. For
Gregg, Krivkovich, Leerssen and
Porter, this weekend's regatta will
be their third district competition
in consecutive weeks.
Bourdow admits that the team
is "struggling a little," due to its
tough schedule, but expects that
the racing experience it has gained
should help in the post-season.
Stanford's physical preparation
could play a large role in its success
if conditions on Monterey Bay
prove to be favorably windy. Bour
dow's training philosophy and
local conditions on the Bay pro
mote the ability to sail well in
heavy air. Weather on Monterey
Bay is difficult to predict, though it
carries the possibility of large
swells and strong gusts, which
could propel the Cardinal to the
lead.
"We're really hoping for a
breeze." Bourdow said. "If it's
windy, we've got a shot. Monterey
could give us some really tough
conditions to sail in — that's a real
ly good thing for our team."
If the Cardinal sails well enough
to win a national berth, it will join
15 teams from seven districts in the
National Collegiate Dinghy Sailing
Championship June 2-4.
The national dinghy competi
tion will be the marquee event of a
month-long series of ICYRA
championship regattas held in St.
Petersburg. Fla.
