## 
### Ben Jones Contributing writer 
For the Stanford men's golf
team, it has been a rollercoaster
ride of a spring season. After im
pressively winning a tournament in
late March, the Cardinal fell to 15th
place in its last effort in Arizona.
The team traveled to Seattle for
the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships at the Broadmoor Golf
Club, hoping to overcome its most
recent cold snap. For the Cardinal,
the effort this week was a micro
cosm of much of the season: two
good rounds sandwiched between
two below average scores.
Stanford carded a four-round
total of 1.454 over the par-70,
6.186-vard course to finish in sev
enth place. The Cardinal had
climbed as high as fifth after the
third round of play before falling
back on the last day.
Arizona State, ranked seventh
nationally in the most recent Mas
terCard Collegiate Golf Rankings,
ran away with the team crown,
leading wire-to-wire. The Sun Dev
ils finished at 1.403 for the event, a
team score of just three over par.
Leading the way for Arizona
State was defending conference
champion Paul Casey, who fired a
course record 10-under-par 60 in
the final round to overcome an
eight-shot deficit and capture the
individual title over Stanford's Joel
Kribel by two strokes.
Casey finished at 15-under-par

for the event (265).
Kribel, ranked fifth in the coun
try. had held the lead after three
rounds, posting scores of 70,64 and
63 to stand at 13-under. His final
round even-par 70 was not enough
to hold off Casey's charge and Kri
bel was forced to settle for a third
straight second-place finish in the
individual standings.
