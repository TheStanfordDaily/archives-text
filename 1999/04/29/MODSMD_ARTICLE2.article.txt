## Hospital workers assert quality of care will drop 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
About 21X) hospital workers rallied outside Stanford
hospital yesterday afternoon to protest the recently an
nounced layoffs by UCSF-Stanford Health Care.
USHC plans to cut 2,000 jobs, 800 of them by layoffs,
in response to a budget shortfall of more than $10 million
in the last quarter of IWX.
The Service Employees International Union, which
recently won an election to represent many workers at
Stanford Hospital, sponsored the rally. Union members
at both Stanford and UC-San Francisco hospitals claim
the cuts will lower the standard of patient care.
"Stanford Hospital says that their motto is to put pa
tient care first, and yet they want to lav off knowledge

able workers and hire temporary workers who do not
have experience," supply distribution worker Mary Gar
cia said.
During the rally several workers hand-delivered 1,000
petitions to Malinda Mitchell, the hospital's chief operat
ing officer, but they were promptly ushered out of her of
fice by five security guards. Mitchell said she is currently
reviewing the petition and would not comment further.
Jill Navorvete, a labor-and-delivery assistant who
helped deliver the petition, said, "The management
never shows that they have any care for us. They have al
ways been negative."
The petition, titled "Hands Off Patient Care," called
for no layoffs of health workers. Navorvete said the
group will continue to rally and to let management know
that "they are not going to walk away easy."
Among the speakers at the rally were Rev. Eugene
Boyle, former Stanford chaplain, senior Sally Lieber of
