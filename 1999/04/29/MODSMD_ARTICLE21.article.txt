# Stanford crew prepares for Big Row
## 
### Monica Sergott Contributing writer 
There's something about Cal. The rivalry be
tween Stanford and California is as prominent in
crew as any other sport. The mere absence of an
axe or a bonfire does not make the competition
any less fierce.
This Saturday, the men's and women's crew
teams will face Cal at the Big Row. The event is
held at Redwood Shores, so neither team is com
peting on its home turf.
Yet Stanford crew has an unusual approach to
the rivalrous duel. The team is not out to win.
California's men's and women's teams are
ranked first and thrid in the nation respectively.
The Bears' crew includes an Olympian on its JV
squad. The Cal team is made up of many foreign
ers from countries with strong crew programs.
Junior Bryan Hoffman described the Califor
nia crew program as *'on another level."
Senior co-captain John Shedlosky explained
the men's team's goals and strategies as being
twofold.
"We can go out there and race against the

clock and ourselves. Or we can gO all out the first
1,000 and trv to stav with Cal," he said.

MEN'S CREW
■ Saturday: Stanford vs. California at Redwood
Shores.

The caliber of California's team in comparison
to the Cardinal's does not make the Big Row so
much of a rivalry as a rowing experience, a time
for Stanford to compete not for the prestige of
winning but for performing at its best.
Despite the high level of competition and qual
ity of racing in the Big Row. the Cardinal rowers
will not be granted rest in order to have an easier
and stronger time rowing against the Bears.
Both the men's and women's teams intend to
train through this regatta in preperation for the
coming Pacific 10 Conference Championships.
The rivalry of the Big Row is a factor for the
Cardinal. "'lt's our most exciting race." said Shed
losky.
Although the race is thrilling becaue of the
competition, the Cardinal is aware that it has little
chance of winning. Stanford has not walked away

from the Big Row with the crown since 1994.
Both the men's and women's teams were let
down last weekend at the Cardinal's own race, the
Stanford Invitational. The men and the womefr
both lost to Sacramento State by seconds.
The Invitational was also held at Redwood
Shores, so Stanford has a slight advantage this
weekend by having experience on the course. De
spite the team's poor performance last weekend,
it has turned up the intensity in practice this week
and regained a positive outlook.
"So far this week we've gotten our act togeth
er. It will be encouraging to see what we can do
[this Saturday]" Shedlosky said.
The race will take place early Saturday, but the
age-old competition does not stop there. Aftef
the biggest rivalry race in the Paci-10 ends. th£
rowers will then face their alumni. This will be a
more light-hearted race and a way for the rowers
to brine down the level of intensity after a difficult
day competition-wise and tradition-wise.
Both the men's and women's teams are still in
the heavy part of their seasons. The Big Row wilt
require much of both teams, but neither team is
expecting a break soon.
