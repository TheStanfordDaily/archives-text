SPORTS NOTEBOOK

"For this time in the year, we did
a lot of good things, things we'd
been working on in training," said
Stanford head coach Steve Swan
son. "We are disappointed to lose,
because we're trying to take every
game and get a result, but there are
a lot of things to take away."
When facing men's teams, the
biggest challenge for the women
was matching the individual speed
of the men.
"Their speed forces us to work
together that much more," Swan
son said. "Often it is the first de
fender that shuts down the oppo
nent. but this way the other defend
ers needed to be involved."
Stanford's lone goal was scored
by freshman Martha West.
This weekend, the Cardinal trav
els to California to battle the Bears,
and will face Portland the following

weekend.
The women also completed their
recruiting class of 20()3. Considered
one of the best classes Stanford has
ever signed, the group is expected
to be ranked as one of the top five in
the nation.
Leading the way are three mem
bers of the Under-18 Women's Na
tional Team: Allyson Marquand
(Irvine. Calif.), Becky Myers (St.
Charles, 111.), and Marcia Wallis
(Los Gatos. Calif.). Two more are
members of the national pool,
Kelsey Carlson (Citrus Heights,
Calif.) and Callie Withers (Los
Altos Hills, Calif.). Rounding out
the group is Katherine Harrington,
who was a finalist for the award
given to the top high school athlete
in Texas.
"What impresses me so much
about this class is not just their abil
ity on the soccer field, but more im
portantly what kind of people they
are," Swanson said in a press re
lease. "They are extremely hard
workers, have tremendously com
petitive attitudes and are positive
players."
Swanson also expects the
women to fit nicely into the group
dynamic.
"We have a tremendous core re
turning from last year, and they will
compliment them and solidify us,"
Swanson said.
