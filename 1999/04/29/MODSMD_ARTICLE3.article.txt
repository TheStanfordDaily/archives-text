Today would have been the l(X)th birthday of
jazz legend Duke Ellington, and amid celebra

tions the world over, those from Stanford who
knew Ellington are looking back to remember

another of the Duke's milestones that could
have been.

Twenty-five years ago today, Ellington was
to have played the North American debut of

his third Sacred Concert in Memorial Church.
The combination concert and 75th birth

day celebration was conceived of and orga
nized by Ellington's "companionand confi-

Dante," longtime Palo Alto resident and for
mer Stanford employee Betty McGettigan,

and then-ASSU Special Events director
Danny Scher. It was intended to cap a

five-day "Salute to Duke Ellington" sym
posium, put on by the ASSU Special

Events board.
But Ellington became ill, and the

concert was canceled. The following
month he died. "He wanted so badly to

keep that date," McGettigan said.
As Scher explained to the Palo

Alto limes on April 10, 1974, "He
thought if he canceled everything

else, he'd be able to manage the
symposium, but then his doctors

said no to that, too."
The story of the 1974 concert

begins in late 1968, with Scher,
then a teenage drummer in the

California Youth Symphony,
and McGettigan separating
from her husband and in charge

of fundraising for the group's
upcoming trip to Australia.

McGettigan's son Michael
was a French horn player in

the symphony.
With McGettigan need
ing a second headliner to

play opposite Jack Benny
for a benefit concert for the

symphony. Scher. a self-confessed

"huge Duke Ellington fan." suggested asking
Ellington, who was coming to San Francisco.

"I knew a man by that name existed... I wasn't a fan,"
McGettigan said.
When Ellington arrived in San Francisco, Scher called
him at the Fairmont Hotel and arranged to deliver
recordings of the youth symphony.
"Duke was pretty easy to get a hold of." McGettigan
explained. "He'd take calls."
Ellington invited Scher for dinner, and Scher ended
up driving him to and from Bimbo's, the jazz club at
which he was playing, that evening.
But to close the deal, Scher said. "We needed an
adult." McGettigan then took over.
Ellington was returning to play in San Francisco again
in January 1%9. McGettigan called him, but he wouldn't

set

a meeting time.

McGettigan decided to go to the

Fairmont. She sat waiting in the lobby for four hours
until Ellington's phone was turned on at L ) p.m.
"I'm sure they thought I was a hooker," she said.
Finally, McGettigan called Ellington's room and was
invited up. When she came in. Ellington had just come
out of the shower and asked her to look away briefly.
When she turned around, he was wearing a sweater and
a blanket around his waist, apparently all the clothing
that was near to hand.
After a brief introduction, Ellington said "I'll do your
