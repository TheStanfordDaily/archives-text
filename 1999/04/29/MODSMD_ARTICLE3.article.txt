Today would have been the l(X)th birthday of
jazz legend Duke Ellington, and amid celebra

tions the world over, those from Stanford who
knew Ellington are looking back to remember

another of the Duke's milestones that could
have been.

Twenty-five years ago today, Ellington was
to have played the North American debut of

his third Sacred Concert in Memorial Church.
The combination concert and 75th birth

day celebration was conceived of and orga
nized by Ellington's "companionand confi-

Dante," longtime Palo Alto resident and for
mer Stanford employee Betty McGettigan,

and then-ASSU Special Events director
Danny Scher. It was intended to cap a

five-day "Salute to Duke Ellington" sym
posium, put on by the ASSU Special

Events board.
But Ellington became ill, and the

concert was canceled. The following
month he died. "He wanted so badly to

keep that date," McGettigan said.
As Scher explained to the Palo

Alto limes on April 10, 1974, "He
thought if he canceled everything

else, he'd be able to manage the
symposium, but then his doctors

said no to that, too."
The story of the 1974 concert

begins in late 1968, with Scher,
then a teenage drummer in the

California Youth Symphony,
and McGettigan separating
from her husband and in charge

of fundraising for the group's
upcoming trip to Australia.

McGettigan's son Michael
was a French horn player in

the symphony.
With McGettigan need
ing a second headliner to

play opposite Jack Benny
for a benefit concert for the

symphony. Scher. a self-confessed

"huge Duke Ellington fan." suggested asking
Ellington, who was coming to San Francisco.

"I knew a man by that name existed... I wasn't a fan,"
McGettigan said.
When Ellington arrived in San Francisco, Scher called
him at the Fairmont Hotel and arranged to deliver
recordings of the youth symphony.
"Duke was pretty easy to get a hold of." McGettigan
explained. "He'd take calls."
Ellington invited Scher for dinner, and Scher ended
up driving him to and from Bimbo's, the jazz club at
which he was playing, that evening.
But to close the deal, Scher said. "We needed an
adult." McGettigan then took over.
Ellington was returning to play in San Francisco again
in January 1%9. McGettigan called him, but he wouldn't

set

a meeting time.

McGettigan decided to go to the

Fairmont. She sat waiting in the lobby for four hours
until Ellington's phone was turned on at L ) p.m.
"I'm sure they thought I was a hooker," she said.
Finally, McGettigan called Ellington's room and was
invited up. When she came in. Ellington had just come
out of the shower and asked her to look away briefly.
When she turned around, he was wearing a sweater and
a blanket around his waist, apparently all the clothing
that was near to hand.
After a brief introduction, Ellington said "I'll do your

concert — have dinner with me."
"My whole life changed in a sec
ond," McGettigan remembered.
The two of them ate Chinese take
out in Ellington's hotel room.
"They definitely hit it off as soon
as they met," Scher said.
In March 1969 Ellington brought
his drummer, bassist and singer to
Foothill College for a joint benefit
concert with the youth symphony.
He supplied full orchestral
arrangements of many of his most fa
mous tunes, including "Caravan,"
"Sophisticated Lady," "Satin Doll"
and"In a Mellow Tone."
"I think they were originally
arranged for the Boston Pops," Scher
said.
Later in the spring of 1969, Elling
ton played a concert with his full or
chestra in Frost Amphitheater.
Through 1969, McGettigan and
Ellington grew closer.
"I got sick later [in 1969]," Scher
recalled. McGettigan "found a pic
ture of [Ellington] and me together
and had him sign it. That picture is
still on the living room wall in my
house."
"She had a really special relation
ship with Duke," he said.
By 1974, Scher was a student at
the Graduate School of Business,
having received his bachelor's from
Stanford in 1973 and completing a
stint as head of ASSU Special
Events. His concert booking success
es included Joan Baez and Cheech
and Chong.
McGettigan had been traveling
with Ellington and his orchestra "al
most continuously" since 1970. •
"The band had a bus. We usually
had a car and driver," she said.
Michael McGettigan also had
traveled with his mother and Elling
ton when he wasn't in school. A part
time member of the Stanford Band
while at Menlo School, he also played
with Ellington's band.
As Ellington's 75th birthday ap
proached, Betty McGettigan sug
gested the idea of a birthday party

and concert at Stanford to Scher.
Ellington had recently debuted his
third Sacred Concert, a collection of
spiritually oriented compositions for
instruments and choir, at London's
Westminster Abbey in October
1973.

On March 18, 1974, ASSU Spe
cial Events announced that Elling
ton would play the American pre

miere of his third Sacred Concert,

"The Majesty of God," on April
29, his 75th birthday, at Memorial

Church. The Stanford Choii
would sing with Ellington's jazz
orchestra.

"There are no bounds to
Duke Ellington — infinite are his
horizons," said the press release.
It was difficult to schedule,
Schersaid.
"We couldn't have done it
without [McGettigan's] help." he
said.
In addition to the Ellington
concert, the special events board
lined up a series of presentations
to honor Ellington in the days
leading up to the concert. The
symposium included a music critic
discussing the Ellington record li
brary and a filmmaker screening
his footage of the Duke's past per
formances.
As the concert was also a birth
day salute to Ellington, "the tick
ets were like invitations, meant to
be keepsakes," Scher said. Tickets
to the concert cost $10.

McGettigan set about soliciting
birthday greetings to go into the pro
gram for the concert. Those who
wrote back to wish Ellington a happy
birthday included President Nixon,
California Governor Ronald Rea
gan, singer Tony Bennett and fellow
jazz great Count Basic. As it was also
one of Ellington's Sacred Concerts,
prominent local clergy wrote also.
Scher also petitioned the Univer
sity to grant Ellington an honorary
doctorate.
"I wrote a letter to [then Universi
ty) President Lyman. Lyman wrote
back, not disagreeing, but explaining
that it wasn't Stanford policy" to

But the Duke was forced back
into the hospital in New York in
early April, where he celebrated
his 75th birthday with a few close
friends, instead of in the spotlight
at Stanford.

Today would have been the l(X)th birthday of
jazz legend Duke Ellington, and amid celebra

tions the world over, those from Stanford who
knew Ellington are looking back to remember

another of the Duke's milestones that could
have been.

Twenty-five years ago today, Ellington was
to have played the North American debut of

his third Sacred Concert in Memorial Church.
The combination concert and 75th birth

day celebration was conceived of and orga
nized by Ellington's "companionand confi-

Dante," longtime Palo Alto resident and for
mer Stanford employee Betty McGettigan,

and then-ASSU Special Events director
Danny Scher. It was intended to cap a

five-day "Salute to Duke Ellington" sym
posium, put on by the ASSU Special

Events board.
But Ellington became ill, and the

concert was canceled. The following
month he died. "He wanted so badly to

keep that date," McGettigan said.
As Scher explained to the Palo

Alto limes on April 10, 1974, "He
thought if he canceled everything

else, he'd be able to manage the
symposium, but then his doctors

said no to that, too."
The story of the 1974 concert

begins in late 1968, with Scher,
then a teenage drummer in the

California Youth Symphony,
and McGettigan separating
from her husband and in charge

of fundraising for the group's
upcoming trip to Australia.

McGettigan's son Michael
was a French horn player in

the symphony.
With McGettigan need
ing a second headliner to

play opposite Jack Benny
for a benefit concert for the

symphony. Scher. a self-confessed

"huge Duke Ellington fan." suggested asking
Ellington, who was coming to San Francisco.

"I knew a man by that name existed... I wasn't a fan,"
McGettigan said.
When Ellington arrived in San Francisco, Scher called
him at the Fairmont Hotel and arranged to deliver
recordings of the youth symphony.
"Duke was pretty easy to get a hold of." McGettigan
explained. "He'd take calls."
Ellington invited Scher for dinner, and Scher ended
up driving him to and from Bimbo's, the jazz club at
which he was playing, that evening.
But to close the deal, Scher said. "We needed an
adult." McGettigan then took over.
Ellington was returning to play in San Francisco again
in January 1%9. McGettigan called him, but he wouldn't

set

a meeting time.

McGettigan decided to go to the

Fairmont. She sat waiting in the lobby for four hours
until Ellington's phone was turned on at L ) p.m.
"I'm sure they thought I was a hooker," she said.
Finally, McGettigan called Ellington's room and was
invited up. When she came in. Ellington had just come
out of the shower and asked her to look away briefly.
When she turned around, he was wearing a sweater and
a blanket around his waist, apparently all the clothing
that was near to hand.
After a brief introduction, Ellington said "I'll do your

concert — have dinner with me."
"My whole life changed in a sec
ond," McGettigan remembered.
The two of them ate Chinese take
out in Ellington's hotel room.
"They definitely hit it off as soon
as they met," Scher said.
In March 1969 Ellington brought
his drummer, bassist and singer to
Foothill College for a joint benefit
concert with the youth symphony.
He supplied full orchestral
arrangements of many of his most fa
mous tunes, including "Caravan,"
"Sophisticated Lady," "Satin Doll"
and"In a Mellow Tone."
"I think they were originally
arranged for the Boston Pops," Scher
said.
Later in the spring of 1969, Elling
ton played a concert with his full or
chestra in Frost Amphitheater.
Through 1969, McGettigan and
Ellington grew closer.
"I got sick later [in 1969]," Scher
recalled. McGettigan "found a pic
ture of [Ellington] and me together
and had him sign it. That picture is
still on the living room wall in my
house."
"She had a really special relation
ship with Duke," he said.
By 1974, Scher was a student at
the Graduate School of Business,
having received his bachelor's from
Stanford in 1973 and completing a
stint as head of ASSU Special
Events. His concert booking success
es included Joan Baez and Cheech
and Chong.
McGettigan had been traveling
with Ellington and his orchestra "al
most continuously" since 1970. •
"The band had a bus. We usually
had a car and driver," she said.
Michael McGettigan also had
traveled with his mother and Elling
ton when he wasn't in school. A part
time member of the Stanford Band
while at Menlo School, he also played
with Ellington's band.
As Ellington's 75th birthday ap
proached, Betty McGettigan sug
gested the idea of a birthday party

and concert at Stanford to Scher.
Ellington had recently debuted his
third Sacred Concert, a collection of
spiritually oriented compositions for
instruments and choir, at London's
Westminster Abbey in October
1973.

On March 18, 1974, ASSU Spe
cial Events announced that Elling
ton would play the American pre

miere of his third Sacred Concert,

"The Majesty of God," on April
29, his 75th birthday, at Memorial

Church. The Stanford Choii
would sing with Ellington's jazz
orchestra.

"There are no bounds to
Duke Ellington — infinite are his
horizons," said the press release.
It was difficult to schedule,
Schersaid.
"We couldn't have done it
without [McGettigan's] help." he
said.
In addition to the Ellington
concert, the special events board
lined up a series of presentations
to honor Ellington in the days
leading up to the concert. The
symposium included a music critic
discussing the Ellington record li
brary and a filmmaker screening
his footage of the Duke's past per
formances.
As the concert was also a birth
day salute to Ellington, "the tick
ets were like invitations, meant to
be keepsakes," Scher said. Tickets
to the concert cost $10.

McGettigan set about soliciting
birthday greetings to go into the pro
gram for the concert. Those who
wrote back to wish Ellington a happy
birthday included President Nixon,
California Governor Ronald Rea
gan, singer Tony Bennett and fellow
jazz great Count Basic. As it was also
one of Ellington's Sacred Concerts,
prominent local clergy wrote also.
Scher also petitioned the Univer
sity to grant Ellington an honorary
doctorate.
"I wrote a letter to [then Universi
ty) President Lyman. Lyman wrote
back, not disagreeing, but explaining
that it wasn't Stanford policy" to
