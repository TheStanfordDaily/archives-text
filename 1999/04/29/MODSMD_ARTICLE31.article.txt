# APOTHEOSIS OF DANCE
## The 						genius of Paul Taylor 
### 
s will a choreographer rein/ent the language of
y / movement, reshaping the viewer's understanding of
what it means to dance. Paul Taylor accomplished this
in a brilliant trio of works performed during his residency at the
Yerba Buena Center for Performing Arts.
"Cloven Kingdom" shirked the showy gimcrackery which
plagues a good deal of avant-garde modern dance. Not a single
one of the movements was strange for strangeness' sake. Rather,
the choreography appeared to have come from a region where the
constitution of gravity and light has been subtly altered, yielding
movements dreamlike in their simultaneous familiarity and
bizarreness. The hypnagogic world Taylor created was rife with
moments of recognition, evoked by the torque of a wrist or the
angle of a leg's extension: the dancers were as much animals as
gods.
Props were minimal and effective. At various points during the
piece, the performers donned headpieces created from mirrors.
These reflected the spotlights, trained on the dancers, into the eyes
of the audience, disrupting the experience of watching.

Movements were commonplace: Four couples dancing in the
pattern of a ballroom dance. These moments were eerily under
mined by a switch from waltzing to ape-like capering.
"Piazzolla Caldera," the final piece, lacked the elemental queer
ness of "Kingdom" and showed Taylor to be hardly a one-trick
pony. "Caldera" hewed to the conventions of the Argentinean
tango; its outbursts were delicate, lifting the outer margins of the
tango into new light.
Gender roles were blessedly imbalanced throughout, yielding
casually diverse pairings. An intimate sequence unfolded between
dancers Thomas Patrick and Richard Chen See. The intoxicated
weight of their movements was developed in the lighting choices:
a ring of amber bulbs dangled from the ceiling in a slow
carouselling motion.
Without pause, Paul Taylor shows his brilliance, twinning wit
and a vanguard's genius for dance.
