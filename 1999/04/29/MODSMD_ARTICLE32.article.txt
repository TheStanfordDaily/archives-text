# ART EXHIBIT
## CALIFORNIA DREAMING 'Pacific Arcadia' at Cantor 
### 
x" jy* he imagery of California from 1600-1915 is
explored with intelligence in "Pacific Arcadia,"
now on view at the Cantor Center for Visual Arts.
The exhibit, curated by Claire Perry, is notable for its
active engagement with the items on display. This is no
simple grouping of a pleasant set of paintings depicting
California. Rather, Perry has selected and organized maps,
advertisements, paintings and photographs to narrate the
ways in which the California Dream has been constructed
through the phases of discovery and colonization.
"Pacific Arcadia" opens with the maps which respond
ed to the glamour of the newly discovered land. The first
cartographs of California present the terrain as an island
flanking the North American coast. The representation
responds to the image of California as a land of riches:
"California" itself is the name of a treasure island
described in a popular 16th-century Spanish novel.
Subsequent expeditions to California disappointed
these expectations, and it was not until the discovery of
gold in 1848 that the region proved worthy of the early
boasts. The ensuing dash for the Western shore is cap
tured in a number of engravings and lithographs. The

miner's life provides the focal point of art from this peri
od, the strangeness of which is captured in Charles
Christian Nahl's "Saturday Night in the Mines" (1856).
The painting depicts four men gathered at a table, but
gold and liquor are placed where one would expect a sup
per.
As the stores of gold became increasingly depleted,
imagery of California entered a pastoral stage. As Perry
notes, local developers sought to show the state as "the
fulfillment of the American agrarian ideal." The rural life
is captured in a set of gorgeously detailed canvases by
Bierstadt, Yelland and Deakin. Next to the images of rural
California come more magnificent depictions of the
state's terrain, including coastal rookeries, lakes and val
leys.
The exhibit closes with representations of San
Francisco. Perhaps the most interesting of these are the
ones which capture the city in the aftermath of the dev
astating earthquake and fire of 1906. The "fire-ravished"
buildings are hallowed in a romantic atmosphere that
evokes the classical ruins of Greece and Rome. And of
course, there's the pleasurable thrill of picking out the
former incarnations of familiar street corners in
panoramic photographs.
An interdisciplinary symposium will take place tomor
row through Saturday, in conjunction with the
Departments of Art and History and the Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
The museum is open Wednesday to Sunday, 11 to 5,
Thursday 11 to 8. Admission is free.
