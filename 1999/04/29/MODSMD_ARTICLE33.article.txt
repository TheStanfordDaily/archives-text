r inside.
The 42nd San Francisco International
Film Festival is playing in the city, spanning
from the 22nd of April until the sixth of
May. You must go and see the best cinema
the world has to offer, even if it is 80 degrees
and sunny outside. The motto for this year's
festival is "Celebrate being in the dark," and
never before have I felt more comfy in the
dark while watching foreign Films.
The San Francisco festival is 42 years old,
which makes it the oldest in the country. It
is also one of the biggest, bringing 182 films
from 58 countries to our doorstep. This year
the event is remarkably well-timed: it shares
in the popularity of the current Plum
Blossom Festival. Film festival-goers waiting
in the long lines at the AMC Kabuki 8, the
festival's headquarters, were not disappoint-

Ed by the added entertain
ment of traditional Japanese
dancers and Taiko presenta
tions.
The collective artistic brain
of this festival is huge. Slated
to receive awards at this
year's festival are some of the
brightest and most creative
filmmakers in recent history.
From the ever-popular Sean
Penn to Mexican director
Arturo Ripstein, famous for
his darkly, dysfunctionally
humorous movies, the
award presentation list is
impressive. Enno Patalas,
representing the world of

film critics, will receive an award, as will
Dutch documentarian Johan van der
Keuken, the late African

director Djibril Diop
Mambety and the famous
femme fatale Karen
Morley.
A set of five movies ded
icated to the memory of
Akira Kurosawa makes up
the selections for this year's
"Indelible Images" series.
Five filmmakers from past
festivals each selected a
movie to be played this
year. In the coming and
final week of the festival, a
collection of shorts called
"Masters of Montage" and
the bizarre "Liquid Sky"
will be played with an
accompanying presenta

tion by the selector of the movies.
The list of must-see movies at this year's
festival is impressive. From the home coun

try comes a barrage of
movies that aren't usually
playing at the local AMC.
"SLC Punk!" is probably the
most mainstream of the
bunch, which isn't meant to
be a knock on the film.
"Punk!" is a pseudo-docu
mentary featuring Matthew
Lillard ("Scream," "Wing
Commander"). It offers
insight into growing up in
the punk scene, as well as the
maturing process in general.
Other American highlights
at the fest include Sean
Penn's 1991 directorial
debut, "The Indian Runner,"

a collection of shorts filmed by minority
teens called "Youth or Consequences 99"
and the world premier of David Mamet's
latest movie, "The Winslow Boy."
Despite the festival's impressive
American offerings, it is supposed to be an
"International Film Festival," and so the
focus is on bringing the world's best to us.
Out of war-torn Yugoslavia comes "The
Wounds," a movie detailing criminal com
ing of age in Belgrade's underworld. The
movie set box office records in Belgrade
despite the government's attempts to curb
its popularity. Some people call it the
Yugoslavian version of "Trainspotting."
The Indian film 'The Terrorist" has been
well received so far by audiences at the festi
val. The movie follows the decision-making
process of a hired killer as the time to kill
approaches. It was inspired by the assassina

tion of the Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi.
Tim Roth is represented at the festival by
his directorial debut, "The War Zone." The
movie is a departure from some of his past
acting roles — the main characters in the
movie are a family (and not of the crime
syndicate variety) that moves from London
to the country. In the new surroundings, the
family's secrets begin to leak out. The film is
being considered for the "Skyy Prize" for the
best film of the festival — yes, Skyy Vodka,
but 3Com Park started this trend right here
in our back yard, so no complaints.
Also a contender for the Skyy prize is
"American Cuisine," a French comedy by
Jean-Yves Pitoun that stars Jason Lee as an
American cook who goes to France to study.
"Cuisine" has received a lukewarm recep
tion so far, as evidenced by the San
Francisco Bay Guardian bestowing it with


Desert art in "Under California"


Lola running in "Run Lola Run"


"Khrustaliov, My Car!"

the title "sitcomesque."
"Ikinai," directed by Hiroshi Shimizu of
Japan, is set in modern day Okinawa (which
was, during World War 11, the site of a
famous mass suicide). The main characters
are a busload of suicidal Okinawans trying
to arrange insurance money for their respec
tive families in a crash — until a tourist
boards the deadly bus. "Ikinai" is also con
sidered a contender for the Skyy prize.
Because reviews often give a better idea of
the scope of a given festival than previews, I
gave three movies a detailed look:
"Khrustaliov, Ma Voiture!" ("Khrustaliov,
My Car!") a Russian-language movie direct
ed by Alexei Guerman and set in Stalin-era
Russia; "Under California: The Limit of
Time," a Mexican film set in the Baja de
California and directed by Carlos Bolado;
and a German film, "Run, Lola, Run," direct
ed by Tom Tykwer.
"Khrustaliov, Ma Voiture!" is a very beau
tiful black and white movie, but its plot left
almost everyone in the theater dazed and
confused. I couldn't even recall the plot
without the help of the media release. The
main character is Yuri Glinsky, a Red Army
general and a brain specialist in charge of a
major hospital during Stalin's demise. That

much was clear, but I got lost
when the KGB got involved.
Actually, 1 wasn't aware while
watching the film that the
KGB played any role at all.
According to the press
release, it organized some
sort of "doctor's plot" that
made Yuri a wanted man.
Anti-Semitism is also
involved in the plot some
how, and the "dirty Zionists"
are cursed repeatedly, but
how the pieces fit together is
still beyond me. Another
problem with the plot is that
it takes sharp turns too often:
Yuri is first admired, then
feared, then hunted, then
needed, then hated, with little
or no explanation (at least in
the subtitles that I read).
After the KGB apprehends
him, he is released to work on
Stalin. After Stalin dies, the

movie takes another right turn and adds
characters a good three-quarters of the way
into the film, as Yuri makes a new life for
himself away from his home.
If the landscape and cinematography
weren't so powerfully stark, I would have left
this movie early. But I have never seen suf
fering so well depicted. Guerman uses the
black-and-white film to full artistic advan
tage, loading the screen with contrast (Yuri's
bald head against a night sky, black branches
laden with snow) and dark corners that con
vey the hard life of Moscow under Stalin.
The characters are more than miserable. A
large majority of them, main and auxiliary,
are sick with a rampant sinus infection. Or
some sort of bleeding sore disease that I
never quite understood. Whether by virtue
of the setting being a hospital or just the des
titute lifestyle of the poor, these people have
little to be happy about. Guerman smacks
you with their suffering.
"Khrustaliov, Ma Voiture!" is about a feel
ing, a hopelessness and suffering, not about
a story. So go see it, but watch for beauty and
sublimity, not for an interesting tale.
"Under California: The Limit of Time" is
also a movie about a feeling and is also very
beautiful. But Carlos Bolado's film is simple
in its beauty.
The movie follows Damiin, played by
Damidn Alcdzar, through a journey of atone
ment. Damidn, whose wife is pregnant, runs
into a pregnant woman trying to cross the
California-Mexico border on Interstate 5.
The movie opens with him driving south on
1-5 on his way to find himself and his grand
mother's grave because, as his wife said in a
tape she made him, their child will need a
whole man for a father.
Through some of the more dizzying
sequences I have seen on screen, Bolado con
veys the torture Damidn's conscience is
putting him through. Damiin ditches the
truck in a visually poetic bonfire and begins
his penance by walking down the Baja to San

Francisco de la Siera, the site of both his
grandmother's grave and world famous cave
paintings done by his ancestors, the Arce
Indians.
Some of the landscapes in Bolado's film
convey the sublime as well as Guerman's fea
ture: Damian finds himself walking through
deserts that stretch forever, canyons that
tower and beaches that lazily wind into the
distance. As he walks through Baja, Damidn
leaves artistic tributes to his ancestors and to
the surroundings. The tributes help to heal
his soul. In San Francisco de la Siera,
Damian finds a distant cousin who becomes
his guide. Jesus Ochoa gives the Arce guide a
genuineness that solidifies the movie.
The final showdown comes in a set of
caves, where Damidn has to confront his past
and his ancestors, as well as gain his will to
live, which is challenged by a rattlesnake bite.
The film's musings on the circle of life and
the limits of time are intelligent and well
thought-out. The landscape, which Bolado
credited as his inspiration, is awe-inspiring.
And the story? Piece of cake to understand.
The final movie I saw was entirely differ
ent. "Run, Lola, Run" is a German action
flick directed by Tom T\vyker and starring
Franka Potente as Lola.
Though not the most original plot line,
"Run" gives the audience a good time. Lola is
an on-top-of-her-shit kind of girl who isn't
fazed by her boyfriend's plea to help him get
100,000 DM that he lost to his boss. The
problem is that she only has 20 minutes to
come up with the dough. The fun comes in
when TVyker rewinds and tries an alternate

ending.
This movie didn't feel too foreign. In fact,
the rapid cutting and panning felt almost too
American for me. The formula smacked of
MTV. A blasting soundtrack, two of the
"hottest new stars," not much plot to speak
of and a hyper pace set for the low-attention
span generation.
Potente as Lola is the heart of the movie.
Her dedication and fiery attitude are the
source of "Run's" high-energy burn (and her
orange hair was kind of cool, too). But I
don't know how it stacks up against the more
artistically minded features of the festival.
There are a lot of attendees at the San
Francisco International Film Festival, so plan
to go early and be ready to wait a bit. If any
complaint has been voiced, it has been that
the movies were hard to see because every
one else wanted to see them. More informa

mother's grave because, as his wife said in a
tape she made him, their child will need a
whole man for a father.
Through some of the more dizzying
sequences I have seen on screen, Bolado con
veys the torture Damidn's conscience is
putting him through. Damiin ditches the
truck in a visually poetic bonfire and begins
his penance by walking down the Baja to San

Francisco de la Siera, the site of both his
grandmother's grave and world famous cave
paintings done by his ancestors, the Arce
Indians.
Some of the landscapes in Bolado's film
convey the sublime as well as Guerman's fea
ture: Damian finds himself walking through
deserts that stretch forever, canyons that
tower and beaches that lazily wind into the
distance. As he walks through Baja, Damidn
leaves artistic tributes to his ancestors and to
the surroundings. The tributes help to heal
his soul. In San Francisco de la Siera,
Damian finds a distant cousin who becomes
his guide. Jesus Ochoa gives the Arce guide a
genuineness that solidifies the movie.
The final showdown comes in a set of
caves, where Damidn has to confront his past
and his ancestors, as well as gain his will to
live, which is challenged by a rattlesnake bite.
The film's musings on the circle of life and
the limits of time are intelligent and well
thought-out. The landscape, which Bolado
credited as his inspiration, is awe-inspiring.
And the story? Piece of cake to understand.
The final movie I saw was entirely differ
ent. "Run, Lola, Run" is a German action
flick directed by Tom T\vyker and starring
Franka Potente as Lola.
Though not the most original plot line,
"Run" gives the audience a good time. Lola is
an on-top-of-her-shit kind of girl who isn't
fazed by her boyfriend's plea to help him get
100,000 DM that he lost to his boss. The
problem is that she only has 20 minutes to
come up with the dough. The fun comes in
when TVyker rewinds and tries an alternate

This movie didn't feel too foreign. In fact,
the rapid cutting and panning felt almost too
American for me. The formula smacked of
MTV. A blasting soundtrack, two of the
"hottest new stars," not much plot to speak

Potente as Lola is the heart of the movie.
Her dedication and fiery attitude are the
source of "Run's" high-energy burn (and her
orange hair was kind of cool, too). But I
don't know how it stacks up against the more
artistically minded features of the festival.

/i/ ow that the weather is finally
/!/ beautiful, I implore you to go

The 42nd San Francisco International
Film Festival is playing in the city, spanning
from the 22nd of April until the sixth of
May. You must go and see the best cinema
the world has to offer, even if it is 80 degrees
and sunny outside. The motto for this year's
festival is "Celebrate being in the dark," and
never before have I felt more comfy in the
dark while watching foreign Films.
The San Francisco festival is 42 years old,
which makes it the oldest in the country. It
is also one of the biggest, bringing 182 films
from 58 countries to our doorstep. This year
the event is remarkably well-timed: it shares
in the popularity of the current Plum
Blossom Festival. Film festival-goers waiting
in the long lines at the AMC Kabuki 8, the
festival's headquarters, were not disappoint-

Ed by the added entertain
ment of traditional Japanese
dancers and Taiko presenta
tions.
The collective artistic brain
of this festival is huge. Slated
to receive awards at this
year's festival are some of the
brightest and most creative
filmmakers in recent history.
From the ever-popular Sean
Penn to Mexican director
Arturo Ripstein, famous for
his darkly, dysfunctionally
humorous movies, the
award presentation list is
impressive. Enno Patalas,
representing the world of

film critics, will receive an award, as will
Dutch documentarian Johan van der
Keuken, the late African

director Djibril Diop
Mambety and the famous
femme fatale Karen
Morley.
A set of five movies ded
icated to the memory of
Akira Kurosawa makes up
the selections for this year's
"Indelible Images" series.
Five filmmakers from past
festivals each selected a
movie to be played this
year. In the coming and
final week of the festival, a
collection of shorts called
"Masters of Montage" and
the bizarre "Liquid Sky"
will be played with an
accompanying presenta

tion by the selector of the movies.
The list of must-see movies at this year's
festival is impressive. From the home coun

try comes a barrage of
movies that aren't usually
playing at the local AMC.
"SLC Punk!" is probably the
most mainstream of the
bunch, which isn't meant to
be a knock on the film.
"Punk!" is a pseudo-docu
mentary featuring Matthew
Lillard ("Scream," "Wing
Commander"). It offers
insight into growing up in
the punk scene, as well as the
maturing process in general.
Other American highlights
at the fest include Sean
Penn's 1991 directorial
debut, "The Indian Runner,"

a collection of shorts filmed by minority
teens called "Youth or Consequences 99"
and the world premier of David Mamet's
latest movie, "The Winslow Boy."
Despite the festival's impressive
American offerings, it is supposed to be an
"International Film Festival," and so the
focus is on bringing the world's best to us.
Out of war-torn Yugoslavia comes "The
Wounds," a movie detailing criminal com
ing of age in Belgrade's underworld. The
movie set box office records in Belgrade
despite the government's attempts to curb
its popularity. Some people call it the
Yugoslavian version of "Trainspotting."
The Indian film 'The Terrorist" has been
well received so far by audiences at the festi
val. The movie follows the decision-making
process of a hired killer as the time to kill
approaches. It was inspired by the assassina

tion of the Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi.
Tim Roth is represented at the festival by
his directorial debut, "The War Zone." The
movie is a departure from some of his past
acting roles — the main characters in the
movie are a family (and not of the crime
syndicate variety) that moves from London
to the country. In the new surroundings, the
family's secrets begin to leak out. The film is
being considered for the "Skyy Prize" for the
best film of the festival — yes, Skyy Vodka,
but 3Com Park started this trend right here
in our back yard, so no complaints.
Also a contender for the Skyy prize is
"American Cuisine," a French comedy by
Jean-Yves Pitoun that stars Jason Lee as an
American cook who goes to France to study.
"Cuisine" has received a lukewarm recep
tion so far, as evidenced by the San
Francisco Bay Guardian bestowing it with


Desert art in "Under California"


Lola running in "Run Lola Run"


"Khrustaliov, My Car!"

the title "sitcomesque."
"Ikinai," directed by Hiroshi Shimizu of
Japan, is set in modern day Okinawa (which
was, during World War 11, the site of a
famous mass suicide). The main characters
are a busload of suicidal Okinawans trying
to arrange insurance money for their respec
tive families in a crash — until a tourist
boards the deadly bus. "Ikinai" is also con
sidered a contender for the Skyy prize.
Because reviews often give a better idea of
the scope of a given festival than previews, I
gave three movies a detailed look:
"Khrustaliov, Ma Voiture!" ("Khrustaliov,
My Car!") a Russian-language movie direct
ed by Alexei Guerman and set in Stalin-era
Russia; "Under California: The Limit of
Time," a Mexican film set in the Baja de
California and directed by Carlos Bolado;
and a German film, "Run, Lola, Run," direct
ed by Tom Tykwer.
"Khrustaliov, Ma Voiture!" is a very beau
tiful black and white movie, but its plot left
almost everyone in the theater dazed and
confused. I couldn't even recall the plot
without the help of the media release. The
main character is Yuri Glinsky, a Red Army
general and a brain specialist in charge of a
major hospital during Stalin's demise. That

much was clear, but I got lost
when the KGB got involved.
Actually, 1 wasn't aware while
watching the film that the
KGB played any role at all.
According to the press
release, it organized some
sort of "doctor's plot" that
made Yuri a wanted man.
Anti-Semitism is also
involved in the plot some
how, and the "dirty Zionists"
are cursed repeatedly, but
how the pieces fit together is
still beyond me. Another
problem with the plot is that
it takes sharp turns too often:
Yuri is first admired, then
feared, then hunted, then
needed, then hated, with little
or no explanation (at least in
the subtitles that I read).
After the KGB apprehends
him, he is released to work on
Stalin. After Stalin dies, the

movie takes another right turn and adds
characters a good three-quarters of the way
into the film, as Yuri makes a new life for
himself away from his home.
If the landscape and cinematography
weren't so powerfully stark, I would have left
this movie early. But I have never seen suf
fering so well depicted. Guerman uses the
black-and-white film to full artistic advan
tage, loading the screen with contrast (Yuri's
bald head against a night sky, black branches
laden with snow) and dark corners that con
vey the hard life of Moscow under Stalin.
The characters are more than miserable. A
large majority of them, main and auxiliary,
are sick with a rampant sinus infection. Or
some sort of bleeding sore disease that I
never quite understood. Whether by virtue
of the setting being a hospital or just the des
titute lifestyle of the poor, these people have
little to be happy about. Guerman smacks
you with their suffering.
"Khrustaliov, Ma Voiture!" is about a feel
ing, a hopelessness and suffering, not about
a story. So go see it, but watch for beauty and
sublimity, not for an interesting tale.
"Under California: The Limit of Time" is
also a movie about a feeling and is also very
beautiful. But Carlos Bolado's film is simple
in its beauty.
The movie follows Damiin, played by
Damidn Alcdzar, through a journey of atone
ment. Damidn, whose wife is pregnant, runs
into a pregnant woman trying to cross the
California-Mexico border on Interstate 5.
The movie opens with him driving south on
1-5 on his way to find himself and his grand
mother's grave because, as his wife said in a
tape she made him, their child will need a
whole man for a father.
Through some of the more dizzying
sequences I have seen on screen, Bolado con
veys the torture Damidn's conscience is

truck in a visually poetic bonfire and begins
