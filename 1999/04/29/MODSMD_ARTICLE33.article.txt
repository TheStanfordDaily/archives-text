## INTERMISSION GOES INTERNATIONAL The
						42nd return of the San Francisco Int'l Film Festival 
### Eno Sarris 
/i/ ow that the weather is finally
/!/ beautiful, I implore you to go
r inside.
The 42nd San Francisco International
Film Festival is playing in the city, spanning
from the 22nd of April until the sixth of
May. You must go and see the best cinema
the world has to offer, even if it is 80 degrees
and sunny outside. The motto for this year's
festival is "Celebrate being in the dark," and
never before have I felt more comfy in the
dark while watching foreign Films.
The San Francisco festival is 42 years old,
which makes it the oldest in the country. It
is also one of the biggest, bringing 182 films
from 58 countries to our doorstep. This year
the event is remarkably well-timed: it shares
in the popularity of the current Plum
Blossom Festival. Film festival-goers waiting
in the long lines at the AMC Kabuki 8, the
festival's headquarters, were not disappoint-

Ed by the added entertain
ment of traditional Japanese
dancers and Taiko presenta
tions.
The collective artistic brain
of this festival is huge. Slated
to receive awards at this
year's festival are some of the
brightest and most creative
filmmakers in recent history.
From the ever-popular Sean
Penn to Mexican director
Arturo Ripstein, famous for
his darkly, dysfunctionally
humorous movies, the
award presentation list is
impressive. Enno Patalas,
representing the world of

film critics, will receive an award, as will
Dutch documentarian Johan van der
Keuken, the late African

director Djibril Diop
Mambety and the famous
femme fatale Karen
Morley.
A set of five movies ded
icated to the memory of
Akira Kurosawa makes up
the selections for this year's
"Indelible Images" series.
Five filmmakers from past
festivals each selected a
movie to be played this
year. In the coming and
final week of the festival, a
collection of shorts called
"Masters of Montage" and
the bizarre "Liquid Sky"
will be played with an
accompanying presenta

tion by the selector of the movies.
The list of must-see movies at this year's
festival is impressive. From the home coun

try comes a barrage of
movies that aren't usually
playing at the local AMC.
"SLC Punk!" is probably the
most mainstream of the
bunch, which isn't meant to
be a knock on the film.
"Punk!" is a pseudo-docu
mentary featuring Matthew
Lillard ("Scream," "Wing
Commander"). It offers
insight into growing up in
the punk scene, as well as the
maturing process in general.
Other American highlights
at the fest include Sean
Penn's 1991 directorial
debut, "The Indian Runner,"

a collection of shorts filmed by minority
teens called "Youth or Consequences 99"
and the world premier of David Mamet's
latest movie, "The Winslow Boy."
Despite the festival's impressive
American offerings, it is supposed to be an
"International Film Festival," and so the
focus is on bringing the world's best to us.
Out of war-torn Yugoslavia comes "The
Wounds," a movie detailing criminal com
ing of age in Belgrade's underworld. The
movie set box office records in Belgrade
despite the government's attempts to curb
its popularity. Some people call it the
Yugoslavian version of "Trainspotting."
The Indian film 'The Terrorist" has been
well received so far by audiences at the festi
val. The movie follows the decision-making
process of a hired killer as the time to kill
approaches. It was inspired by the assassina

tion of the Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi.
Tim Roth is represented at the festival by
his directorial debut, "The War Zone." The
movie is a departure from some of his past
acting roles — the main characters in the
movie are a family (and not of the crime
syndicate variety) that moves from London
to the country. In the new surroundings, the
family's secrets begin to leak out. The film is
being considered for the "Skyy Prize" for the
best film of the festival — yes, Skyy Vodka,
but 3Com Park started this trend right here
in our back yard, so no complaints.
Also a contender for the Skyy prize is
"American Cuisine," a French comedy by
Jean-Yves Pitoun that stars Jason Lee as an
American cook who goes to France to study.
"Cuisine" has received a lukewarm recep
tion so far, as evidenced by the San
Francisco Bay Guardian bestowing it with


Desert art in "Under California"


Lola running in "Run Lola Run"


"Khrustaliov, My Car!"
