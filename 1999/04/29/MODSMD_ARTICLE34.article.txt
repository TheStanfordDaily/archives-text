## THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS Various Artists Rebels and Outlaws (Capitol Records) 
### 
/-"fv Ay- ith a title like "Rebels and Outlaws,"
( yJ//f one might assume that this compila
tion features songs that are both
menacing and inaccessible.
However, this collection of country rebel
rock — featuring well-known musicians such as
Willie Nelson and less-well-known ones like
Dick Curless — is a surprisingly enjoyable and
pleasant listen.
The first song on the CD, "Live Fast, Love
Hard, Die Young" by Faron Young, gives a taste
of the kind of music to come. Young's lyrics cel
ebrate the joys of drinking and smoking, life in
prison, bad women and worse men. Like Young,
the other musicians showcased on this record
also tell tales of their lives as "rebels" and "out
laws." The next song, "Folsom Prison Blues" is
sung by Johnny Cash, one of the hardest men to
ever live. Cash has started a forest fire, wrecked
hotel rooms and battled drug addiction.
Considering the kind of wild music featured
here, it is not surprising that many of these
singers have crossed each other's paths. Merle
Haggard, who sings "Branded Man" on this
album, was an inmate at San Quentin when
Cash played there. Cash's live show inspired
Haggard to join the prison band.
1 have heard the song "Cocaine Blues" before
but never like this. Hank Thompson sings it
quickly and with such a bright spirit that you
wonder if he's ever seen the darker side of
cocaine. However, right at the end of the song,
there is a slowdown as he warns the listener to
"let that cocaine be." Powerful.
Without paying too much attention to the
lyrics, one might forget that some of the artists
on the compilation have been arrested for
assault or attempted murder. One exception is
"Riot In Cell Block Number Nine" by Wanda
Jackson. She sings with such a ferocious tone

that you can't help but look over your shoulder
to make sure nobody's about to break.
The collection ends with "Blood on the
Saddle" by Tex Ritter. Although Ritter was nei
ther a rebel nor an outlaw (he went to law school
and sang in a glee club), the song is the kind of
non-formulaic piece that shakes up the country
music establishment.
Try listening to the album, and if upon first
listen you don't see what all the fuss is, knock
back some booze and try again.
