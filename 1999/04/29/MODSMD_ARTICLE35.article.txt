112f —yQ et's get something straight. If a band
v_ signed on an independent label plays
•- songs with dark, arpeggiated verses
and crashing, chaotic choruses with manic
screaming, they might be labeled "emo" —
short for emotional — but this does not mean
the band members are shy, ineek geeks or that
their music necessarily evokes sensitivity and
introversion. Good emo should be scary.
Which is why I find "lowercase" such a frus
trating band name. There is nothing diminutive
about this San Francisco trio, whose brand of
haunting, emotive indie rock holds none of the
geekiness one would expect from a band named
after a grammatical term. On the contrary, "the
going away present" (if you name your band
lowercase, you get to join e. e. cummings in
defying rules of capitalization), the band's most
majestic album to date, tends toward the
grandiose: "You know that I could scrape by on
the glory and the sin / There's no doubt within
my mind that if I tried I'd win." These are not
the words of the easily spooked.
The hypnotic dissonance of the first track,
culminating in a perfect emo howl, sets the
structure for the rest of the album. The title
track approaches a Three Mile Pilot kind of
catchiness, but "glisten to the pink" is the real
masterpiece. If you love Slint's "Spiderland" but
have always been frustrated by the armies of
bands claiming to be "influenced by Slint," you

should buy "the going away present," if only to
experience this brooding soundscape. Another
deliciously Slinty moment occurs on the "last"
track (psst ... there's a hidden track), in which
sinister guitar arpeggios bury a malicious whis
per about angelfish.
On its last two albums on Amßep - a label
that puts the "rep" in "repetitive" - the band
struggled with the rut that the soft-loud-soft
loud formula often digs. While it hasn't com
pletely emerged from this rut, on this new
release out on Punk in My Vitamins, the repeti
tion has become incantory. lowercase is one of
the Bay Area's best-kept secrets. If you didn't get
a chance to catch them this month when they
played at the Enchanted Broccoli Forest, you're a
sucker.
