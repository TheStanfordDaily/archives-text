## Ghosts of Dead Aeroplanes (Jetset) 
### 
✓Qn first listen, "Ghosts of Dead
[j/J Aeroplanes" (Jetset), Prolapse's third
album, seems like indistinct and undif
ferentiated atmospheric noodling. And do not
doubt that Prolapse is a strange and acquired
taste: not for everyone.
Still, this is one of those albums that rewards
repeated listens. Patterns and structures emerge
out of the layers of guitars and static rhythms,
and you begin to associate your own private
imagery with the songs. On "Fob.com" for
example, I imagine skyscrapers bending and
jumping to the propulsive beat. You might not.
The dense production makes sense since
Prolapse has such a full sound: two vocalists, two
guitarists, bass and drums. There are lot of ideas
going on here, and it is fun to watch them col
lide, cohere and fall apart.
The two vocalists particularly add a lot of tex
tures. Linda Steelyard sighs and moans with
ethereal pop grace, while Mick Derrick grunts
and rants in a thick Scottish brogue. It works
much better than it ought to. Particularly satis
fying are songs like "Adiabatic" in which
Steelyard's vocal floats above building trance
rock with Derrick's grumbling buried in the
mix. Then Steelyard passionately sings a repeat
ed cry, preparing the way for Derrick to climac
tically ravage the mood. I was sometimes irritat
ed, though, by Derrick's solitary rants. On
"Cylinders Vl2 Beats Cylinders 8," for example,
he sounds like an insane wannabe poet, assault
ing listeners with a drunken monologue. Still,
even that track is not terrible, and all eight sus
tain interest. That's rather remarkable consider
ing the songs are each about five or six minutes
long.
Even though this music is dense and dark, it
doesn't drag. And "New 1" actually rocks out, in
a bustling James kind of way. On a darker plan
et, it would probably be a radio hit.
