## BLINK182 Live at Union Square 
### 
S~Ty*o\ix years ago, a Blink show
C^7 meant a small club in Southern
California where a couple hun
dred fans of the emerging melodic pop
punk sound would mosh themselves into
a frenzy while dodging the steady stream
of stage-divers elevated above the pit. The
crowds would sing along to every song and
then buy the band's demo tape afterwards
for the drive home. All in all, good old
fashioned sweaty fun to be had by every
one.
The days of no-name venues and aggro
shows are over, however, as Blink has
instead embraced its recent popularity via

MTV videos and commercial radio airplay. Some may cry "sell-out," the kiss of
death to any aspiring band trying to maintain underground credibility, but
when Blink took the stage on the afternoon of April 18 in Union Square at the
heart of San Francisco, it was definitely a different live band from what it used
to be.
First off, the show was free and put on to promote Levi's new "Original Spin"
jeans. The massive crowd turnout was made up of mostly young teen-age girls,
happy to get their free Live 105 stickers and oblivious to the band's pre-major
label material. A jumbotron in the background flashed images of celebrities
modeling Levi's. After an excruciatingly long sound check, Blink finally came
out, albeit in its new form with Travis Barker, formerly of the Aquabats, on
drums (the old drummer Scott left the band for the ever-popular reason "per
sonal issues"). Unfortunately, the sound check, despite its length, was quite inef
fective. As the band launched into its opening number "Pathetic," the sound was
horrible.
Poor sound quality marred the entire performance, which was a scant 45
minutes long despite the band's headlining status. During its set, Blink only
played two songs off of its first record "Cheshire Cat." About half of the day's
material was off "Dude Ranch," Blink's first major-label release from 1997, and

the other half was new stuff off of the upcoming album "Enema of the State" set
for release this June. Songs such as "Gone Away to College" and the soon-to-be
on-the-radio single "What's My Age Again" were tight, music-wise, and had lots
of energy when performed live. The sound of the new songs was definitely pop
heavy, though, and the over-produced, recorded versions on the new album
really seem geared towards being MTV-friendly.
To give the band credit, it does still put on a fun live show regardless of sound
problems. And the songs it performs are never sloppy. Highlights of the day
included sped-up versions of the songs "Mutt" (to appear on the soundtrack to
the forthcoming teen flick "American Pie") and "Carousel," the last song of the
afternoon (there was no encore). Low points of the day included the lack of an
encore and the fact that the crowd began chanting "Dammit" at one point in an
attempt to get the band to play its popular hit single. Even worse, the band
obliged. Not exactly punk rock when you think about it, but then again, that
was hardly a concern for the majority of those in attendance. After all, they got
to listen to the "Dammit" lyric "did you hear he fucked her?" without its usual
radio edit. I guess this is growing up.
