# OLIVIA TREMOR CONTROL

t's easy to look on the '60s with embart|gpient. Granny glasses, love beads, "flower power"
« 112 Cr) ... golly gee, how lame. Still, whether they were around or not, regard that
era as something wonderful. Usuj|ofsudfaf an attitude is romanticized Nostalgia.
The fascinating thing about Olivia Trefhor Control is that it manages to make music heavi-|
ly embedded in the psychedelic pop era while avoiding nostalgia. Rather than re-create the
musk of the era, Olivia Tremor Coqtrol simply seems to be influenced by the Bfiach Boys and
the Beatles in the same way that manyJbands today are influenced by the Pixies and Pavement
I mean "influence" in the best impossible. Olivia Tremor Control picks up where
delic pop left off. It's a brilliant idea, for ifs an incomplete history. Brian Wilsonof the Beadh
Boys made one masterpiece, "P/r Sounds," and then went literally insane with th« never com-'
pleted follow-up, "Smile." The Beatles (or at least John lennon) was onto something with
"Tomorrow Never Knows" and "A Day in the Life," but "The White Album* was a totally differ
ent direction. Syd Barrett, founder of Pink Floyd, went mad after the band's first album. Jimi
Hendrix, Jim Morrison ... the casualties of the first psychedelic era are legion. \
How valiant to pick up an idea with so many potholes (pardon the pun). On "Black Foliage:
Volume One" (Flydaddy), the group's second album, Olivia Hremor Control mastered the stu
dio trickery that made the Beades so revolutionary. The album consist* of well-crafted pop
songs buried in dense layers of instrumentation and "found* sounds^.
Naturally, I was unsure of what to expect from the band In concert J wasjblown away, then,
by the gorgeous wall of noise that presented itself at the Cubberley Community Center last
Saturday night. The stage was populated by eight to 10 wandering musicians picking up, dis
carding and trading Vflffottf instruments, including a tuba, banjo and tin can.
Psychedelic films almost as intriguing as the music itself played across the band. Tight ren
ditions of songs from the record bled into eipansive jams with no loss in coherency. Words can't
explain the "wow" psychedelia, but Olivia Tremor Control was onto
something when it mentioned aJlWfihouse symphony" in one song lyric.
Opening for Olivia Tremor auditorium that was eerily reminiscent of high
school was the Music Tapes, who, like Olivia Tremor Control, is from Athens, Ga. If I described
|it as a dada jugband from outer space, would that make sense? I hope so, because that's what it
y mm, it just .like, felt like I was there,
