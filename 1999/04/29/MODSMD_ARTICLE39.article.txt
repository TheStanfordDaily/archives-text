## EYES ON THE SKIES Wanted: more Cusack, less 'Tin' 
### 
yrf t some point in "Pushing Tin" a woman sarcastically asks Nick Falzone
C\y (John Cusack), "Are there people that find you charming?" He replies by
saying, "Well, they pretend because I try so hard."
"Pushing Tin" is about finding a dramatic and romantic backdrop for Cusack's
Falzone. Incidentally, the woman ends up sleeping with him.
Falzone is an egotistical, macho, talkative, edgy and extraordinary air-traffic con
troller. He and his coworkers are part of a crew of highly paid, highly stressed loose can
nons who control the air space for up to 7,000 flights a day on Long Island. There are
recurring jokes throughout the movie about how in the end, most of the people in their
profession succumb to some type of mental breakdown. Cusack knows this but revels

in the glory of being the best at ignoring the pressure or being

above it. This is, of course, until the upper management
decides it needs to assimilate a new guy into the crew (there's

never an explanation for these decisions in action movies).

Russell Bell walks into the lives of the characters of

"Pushing Tin" to create mystery and some extra drama in
their already dramatic lives. Billy Bob Thornton's first

appearance on screen is powerful. He is older, scraggly, wear
ing leather and seems like a legitimate hard-ass. This is unlike

any image of Billy Bob Thornton I've ever seen or imagined. It

turns out Bell is a drifter who has been all around the country doing
air-traffic control jobs. The character is originally portrayed as a

symbol of the best man in the business, somewhat of a spiritual

genius who can do something with the computer screens that
nobody else can. This bothers Cusack, which leads to some

inevitable male-to-male combat.
The tension between Bell and Falzone is at first over who

controls the air better, but we are soon introduced to

Thornton's sexy young wife, Mary (Angelina Jolie). Cusack
and Jolie meet at a neighborhood cookout for the cowork
ers. Although Jolie is pretty hard not to look at, I had a little
trouble believing a bunch of men in their 30s would gawk so
openly with their wives, children and coworkers around.
That aside, chemistry begins and the two eventually have a
"one night indiscretion".
"Pushing Tin" is all over the place in terms of its inten

tions and motivations. In the beginning, it seems to be a fast-paced, dark, comical look
at air-traffic controllers and their profession. I can easily see a meaningful movie with
such a premise. There are very few movies that devote their full attention to the office,
which is where people spend most of their time.
I suppose the filmmakers realized these guys weren't really representative of air
traffic controllers and tried to add the mysterious Billy Bob Thornton character for an

interesting twist. The problem is, we really aren't given

much reason to care about the Thornton character —

we just get a superficial view of some guy who hap

pens to be an ex-alcoholic who also happens to be a

good air-traffic controller.
By the end, the movie turns into a weird love story,

then a predictable, contrived love story and all in a

matter of 20 minutes. "Pushing Tin" has its funny

moments, as well as a few moments of intensity stem

ming from the idea of hundreds of people possibly crash

ing in the air due to a few people controlling everything on

the ground. Cate Blanchett was capable as Cusack's wife but did

n't really bring anything out of the ordinary to the role. This was

probably due to the role and not her acting skills. Cusack was his
usual interesting self, so I recommend the movie to his fans but
not to anyone else.
