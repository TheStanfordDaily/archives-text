# Lt. Gov. speaks at Farm
## Bustamante lauds Chávez, diversity 
### Paul Woody Contributing writer 
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, the
first Latino elected to a statewide
office in California in more than
120 years, spoke last night about
the legacy of Cesar Chavez and
what the great activist can teach
about valuing diversity.
The speech, which emphasized
sacrifice, was the keynote address
of the Sixth Annual Cesar Chavez
Commemorative Celebration, a
week-long series of educational
and cultural programs dedicated
to the co-founder of the United
Farm Workers.
Bustamante, a Democrat,
opened his speech by recalling a
photo of Chavez and Sen. Robert
Kennedy that hangs outside his of
fice.

'When it comes to issues of
diversity, we need to stand
— Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante

In it "You can actually see the
times changing," Bustamante said.
He explained that Chavez ap
pears dignified in the photograph
and that he represents the "hope
that when you do the right thing
people will join you."
One of the "right things" that
Bustamante believes is worth
doing is supporting diversity.
"When it comes to the issue of
diversity, we need to stand up,"
Bustamante said.
"Our institutions need to reflect
our society," he said.
The lieutenant governor went
on to call diversity the "bedrock of
our nation," stating that it must be
defended at all costs.
Bustamante sees Proposition
187, a measure passed in 1994 that
would deprive illegal immigrants
of social services, as a large barrier
to diversity and to basic human
rights.
He has recently attacked Gov.
Gray Davis, a fellow Democrat,
for seeking federal mediation in
the legal battles over the proposi
tion, most of whose provisions a
federal judge last year declared
unconstitutional.
"Prop. 187 scapegoats the poor,
young, sick and pregnant," Busta
mante said in yesterday's speech,
and he went on to call it the "core
of mean-spirited politics."
The audience was then asked
the question, "If you seek to create
a just world, what price are you
willing to pay?" and Bustamante
implied that the question was "not
far removed from Kosovo" where
genocide is being committed and
diversity is being destroyed.
"We must be prepared to pay a
price for standing up." Bustamante
said.

The speech concluded by Bus
tamante telling the audience, "I
hope you are all willing to pay a
price to help create a new Califor
nia that embraces its diversity."
