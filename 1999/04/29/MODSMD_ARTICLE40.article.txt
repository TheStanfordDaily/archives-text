# HEAVEN ON SCREEN
## 'Three Seasons' & Vietnam as Vietnam 
### 
nee in a while, I walk out of a screen
f/yj ing and know I've seen a movie that
I will have to call one of the best
movies I've ever seen in my life. "Three
Seasons" was one of those movies.
The visual effects employed in "Seasons 3
are amazing. We are given a view of a lush,
green Vietnam that has never been seen on
film. Apparently, this is the first American
movie shot in Vietnam since the war. The
beauty of the countryside is coupled with
interwoven stories about living in present
day Vietnam.
We are introduced to a cyclone (it's like a
rickshaw without a motor) driver who works
long, brutal hours. He is kind and cares
about his fellow man. He also has a crush on
one of his usual customers, a prostitute. She
has seen the insides of the glamorous new
hotels of post-war Vietnam because of her
work, but going back to working like a peas
ant isn't what she wants. She wants to be a
part of the new world she sees. He just wants
her, for reasons she can't understand.
We also meet a lotus picker. She is young
and not used to the old songs the older ladies
sing while picking lotuses. Her rebellion
leads her to a meeting with the schoolmaster
whom they all work for. Nobody has ever
seen him; they've only heard about him. The
schoolmaster's hut is in the middle of the
"lotus field." The young lotus picker begins
to learn about the schoolmaster and his
story. It turns out that he's a poet but can't
write his poetry because he is a leper and his
illness has destroyed his hands (not to men
tion his face, which is why he became a
recluse). She becomes his hands, and we are
allowed to listen while he recites new poems
for her to capture. The poet was one of the

most interesting
characters I've
ever seen on
film.

American presence in the film (not a bad
American actor to add to the mix). He plays
a man who is "trying to make his peace with
this place" He was one of the men who came
to Vietnam during the war with the military
and fathered a child whom he never stayed to
look after. His former lover — his daughter's
mother — has apparently died, and he feels
now is the time to deal with his past. We see
his pain throughout the film and that he is
ready to finally meet his now-grown daugh
ter.
There is also a child in "Seasons" who sur
vives by selling an assortment of merchan
dise to whomever will buy. Zippo's are his
main product. We see him trying to grow up
without anyone to care for him. The only
man who seems responsible for him is the
one who supplies him with things to sell. It is
tragic to see the boy look for affection in this
man who cares more about the money the
child provides him than the child himself.
The movie is brought to a perfect end by
combining all of the characters' lives into
final moments that give all of them, and us,
hope. The movie was made by Tony Bui, who
was bom in Vietnam and spent his teen-age
years in Sunnyvale.
In "Seasons," he has created a rare film. It
doesn't just talk about the Vietnam War.
Instead, it deals with issues of Vietnamese
people living in a post-war Vietnam.
