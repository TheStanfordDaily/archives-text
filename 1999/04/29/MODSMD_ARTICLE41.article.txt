Hopefully, by this point, you're wondering when this review is going to get to
"SLC Punk" (Sony Picture Classics), the movie in the headline. Good question,
but I'm already there. See, "SLC" stands for Salt Lake City, as in a large city in
Utah. So what does Salt Lake City have to do with punk?
Nothing. But "SLC Punk" is about two kids who try to be punk in Salt Lake
City in 1985. Steve-0 (Matthew Lillard of "Scream") is the smarter, richer of the
two, and he narrates. The film's structure mostly mirrors the chaos that Steve
aspires to. Example: his best friend is named Heroin Bob. But Bob isn't a junkie.
In fact, he only drinks and smokes cigarettes. So what does heroin have to do with
Bob?
Nothing. Get the picture? "SLC Punk" wants people to think it's a cult movie.
It's shot with incredible style, has a smashing soundtrack of punk and proto-punk
and features teen pin-up idol Devon Sawa on 100 hits of acid.
But it's not a cult movie. "SLC Punk" is about selling out. But to put it that way
would be so very jaded and cynical, which is just not thinking millenially. And it's

not 1985 anymore. For a while, you might think that "SLC

Punk" is a period film. But then you realize that it's

about hometowns. It's about cliques; in this movie:
punks, mods, skinheads, rednecks, hippies and new

wavers. It's about drugs. It's about fashion. It's about
kids doing whatever kids have always done, which is

why the film does not have a plot.
There is a structure, but no plot. The structure is

about chaos into order. In short, growing up, which is also

what kids do. It does drag at times. There's more than one

totally pointless scene. I happened to like one of the totally
pointless scenes, but it didn't really belong in the film.

My opinion of the film is hopelessly tainted by me grad

uating and thinking about the sorts of things the film
is about. But it's still an undoubtedly fresh flick. So
now you're done reading this. Go see it. And grow up
or sell out, whichever you prefer.
