### Roxy Sass 
magine, if you will, a couple having
( CtJ sex. The man concentrates, trying to
ei.S stay in the moment and think dirty
thoughts to make himself more excited.
Meanwhile, the woman is reciting nail polish
names in her head to keep from coming before
him. Sound familiar? Miss Sass would wager not.
Boys, imagine if you didn't come nearly every
time you had sex. Ladies, imagine if you did.
These can be hard scenarios to picture, since sex
at its most basic, procreative level is all about the
male orgasm. The sad fact is that only about 30
percent of women have orgasms regularly during
sex, while a whole, neglected 11 percent have
never had an orgasm by any means. Though it's
nobody's fault that we're built like this, we don't
have to resign ourselves to it.
In fact, we ladies should be having as many
orgasms as possible. When a woman comes, her
cheeks turn rosy arid her eyes twinkle. Menstrual
cramps and insomnia disappear. Her heart rate
soars and her blood goes hurdling to the tips of
her fingers and toes. Coming even gives a girl a
sense of general well-being, because if a person
can feel that good, the world has to be a good
place. In other words, a post-orgasmic woman is
a very amiable character, which is good for every
one involved.
With that in mind, let's get started having
more of them. There are two main types to be
had: the clitoral orgasm and the G-spot orgasm.
You may have heard minors of other types, the
"no-hands" orgasm or the "boobgasm." While it
is true that some women can come just by stim
ulation of their nipples, these women are a lucky
few. As for the "no-hands" women who claim to
come by thought power alone, most of them are
actually clenching and unclenching their thighs
for friction rather than simply thinking-off.
Though it maf be fun to try for either of these
mythic types, it is on the first two that we will
focus.
The clitoral orgasm i$ the one most of us are
familiar with, since the clitoris' nerve endings
and exterior placement make it a natural touch
target. For clarity's sake, the clitoris is the small
mound-shaped organ just above the vagina's
opening and inside the Hps. Clitori range from 2
to 20 millimeters (get out your rulers), so some
are fleshy and plentiful while others are smaller
and more reclusive. Keep in mind that size has
nothing to do with the sensitivity.
The best positions, then, for this type of
orgasm allow attention to be given directly to the
clit. Clits don't receive much attention in a lot of
traditional positions, like missionary, since the
penis never comes into contact with them. So try
doggie-style with a reach around or have the girl
on her back with her knees on the boy's shoul
ders. And take care to gauge a girl's reaction to
your action. Clits are moody little beasts that will
want hard pressure one second and light tickling
. the next.
As for the G-spot orgasm, it deserves more
attention than space here allows. Few how-to's,
check out the November 19, 1998 "Intermission"
| which covers it in detail.
Now a side note for something that rarely
receives mention elsewhere: female ejaculation*
When G-spot stimulation leads to orgasm, a
clear, odorless fluid is sometimes ejected from

the vagina. This is not, I repeat, not urine but
what some believe to be the product of a female
version of the prostate gland. In any case, it is a
sign of an orgasm of noteworthy magnitude, so
put down a towel and break out the champagne.
But, you say, I've tried |M>9itions and
they're just not cutting the K¥, Because Miss Sass
is a veritable orgasm guru herself, she can offer a
few practical tips for the ladies to make them
more orgasmic. One, some or none of the fol
lowing may work for you, so take What advice
you will and leave the rest.
1. Take matters into your own hands. Before
anyone else can please you, you have to know
what you like. So, adopt America's favorite pas
time and then pass along your favorite findings
when you're in the sack.
2. Check your medication. Certain medicines
will shut down your sex drive and make orgasms
hard to come by, whil? others like Anafranil will
make you come with as little impetus as a sneeze
or yawn. (As an aside* Miss Sass OftCft heard of a
girl who went to |he doctor complaining of
orgasms each time she sneezed. The doctor
asked, "What are fou taking for that?" The girl
responded, "Pepper.*)
3. Uy off the vibrator. Counter-intuitive as
that sounds, having an orgasm with a partner can
be harder when you're used to a toy It's not so
much that your crotch gets numb or desensitized
but that you simply become accustomed to the
intense feeling a vibrator gim you. Unless your
boy can wiggle his Willie at 500 RPM, you'll ben
efit from eliminating the competition.
4. Try sex with a full bladder. For some
women, the pressure makes sex more pleasurable
and orgasms easier to reach. (But watch yourself
if you have problems With bladder control or
infections.)
5. Get a buzz cut Results vary, but some
women find that shaving theii pubic hair off
increases sensation and leads to more orgasms.
This is probably because it exposes the mons
veneris or "Mound of Vem*" the sensitive area
just about the lips. Of course, for Others, shaving
leads to unbearable itching and discomfort while
the hair grows back, so dip at your OWn risk.
A final note on faking before Miss Sass sends
you off. Faking orgasms is like baking a cake with
salt instead of sugar. It looks appealing superfi
cially, but when you get into it, you find a world
of bitterness. Well, perhaps It Isn't that bad —
Miss Sass knows fakers who are neither weak
women nor witches. But if yxtti majke it a regular
habit, both partners suffer. The woman remains
unsatisfied, and the guy lacks the guilty knowl
edge that she didn't come, which would inspire
any decent male to try a little harder next time.
That said, have a good time trying for more of
those elusive orgasms, and please, pass the pep
per.
