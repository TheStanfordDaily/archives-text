During the 20-minute journey through the moun
tains of Interstate 280 to La Fondue, we imagined our
selves traversing the Swiss Alps on our way to a genuine
Swiss meal. We were both craving fondue, one of
Switzerland's most delectable dishes, and expected that
La Fondue restaurant would deliver the goods. With
each passing moment, our desire to dine like the Swiss
intensified. Once we walked into the restaurant, howev
er, hunger became our secondary impulse as we were
overcome with shock at the decor.
Expecting a typically Swiss restaurant in the shape of
a wooden chalet, we instead found a modern building
with decorations that can only be described as kooky.
Since our table was in the room furthest from the
entrance, we were escorted through each of the differ
ently themed dining rooms in La Fondue. The first room
that one encounters upon entering the restaurant looks
like Saratoga's version of medieval times. The jester
themed chairs and wizard caps suggested a cheap knock
off of King Arthur's dining hall. We had the pleasure of
eating in the "celestial orbs" room. This space-age room
was decorated in a shade of deep blue with swaths of
drapery hanging above.
The decor was not the only feature amiss at the
restaurant. Some of the selections on the menu struck us
as rather Americanized. While Homer Simpson might
favor the cheddar and beer fondue option ("mmm ...
foonnduuee,") it would appall any true lover of authen
tic fondue. Moreover, the wide variety of meats and
grilling methods further reinforced our notion that this
restaurant was nothing more than a fondue sham.
Barbecued bison and teriyaki chicken are two dishes that
are not abundantly present in any Swiss restaurant. And
while these unauthentic Swiss items were offered, other
Swiss delicacies, like raclet, were nowhere to be found.
We decided to skip the appetizers all together and
concentrate on our main task; eating fondue cheese. Our
waitress prepared our meal on the electric burners built
into our table and took us through each step of the
preparation. Our two fondue selections were both Swiss
based cheeses with different alcohols. Our dipping selec
tions included not only the regular cubed pieces of bread
but also a variety of fruits and vegetables. The fondue
itself was actually quite tasty, which helped to rekindle
some of the flame of past Swiss vacations for Adrien.
After eating two pots of cheese, we were unfortunate
ly too full to try the restaurant's highly recommended
chocolate fondue dessert. However, even if we had
enjoyed dessert, we still would have left La Fondue dis
appointed by its lack of authenticity. Rather than
remaining true to its Swiss roots, this restaurant
attempts to attract more customers by broadening its
scope and fails miserably.
