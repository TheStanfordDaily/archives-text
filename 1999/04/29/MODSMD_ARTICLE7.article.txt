# New chilled water plant to open
## 
### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
Starting next week, Stanford will produce
chilled water from a new $22-million plant.
Since the early 19705, Stanford has generated its
chilled water at Central Energy Facility on Jordan
Way and Campus Drive. Stanford's old system
consisted of conventional chillers and a 4 million
gallon tank.
Currently, periods of high temperature can
overuse Stanford's cooling resources, resulting in
air conditioning being unavailable in some build
ings. According to Robert Reid, Stanford Utilities
energy group manager, sometimes "the load on the
old system exceeded its maximum capacity."
According to Prof. Stephen Schneider of Stan
ford's Institute for International Studies, "there is
of course much climatic variability" at Stanford.
Stanford often experiences El Ninos or droughts.
"Expect the latter to continue and perhaps intensi
fy— according to some theories at least — with
more global warming," Schneider said.
The University prioritizes all of the chilled
water loads on campus. Chilled water is allotted to
"ensure the most critical loads are met," Reid said.
Life safety concerns, such as the hospital, re
ceive the first priority in air conditioning, followed
by computing and research needs. Comfort cooling
is last on the air-conditioning totem pole.

The new facility will "roughly add a 50 percent
increase to our generation capacity," Reid said.
The 4 million gallon tank has been converted to an
ice storage tank. By doing this, chilled water pro
duction will increase from 30,(XX) ton hours to
1(X),(KX) ton hours.
According to Reid, there will he a "300 percent

increase in storage capacity.
With the new system, the plant will "make ice in
the middle of the night and burn ice in the day
time," Reid said. Using this system, the plant can
expend most of its energy in the middle of the night
when electrical rates are low. This ice storage sys
tem is an "economic investment in Stanford's fu
ture," Reid said. The University hopes to pay for
the $22 million price tag by saving money on elec
trical bills.
ITie new facility will use ammonia as a refriger

ant because it is "environmentally friendly," Reid
said. This summer, the University will remove two
25-year-old refrigerent units.
According to Reid, the new plant will "allow us
to remove some of the non-environmentally
friendly refrigerants from the campus." Stanford's
use of ozone-harming refrigerants at the plant will
be cut by roughly half.
According to Schneider, Stanford's chilled
water facility has been a "very efficient, low pollut
ing power plant," and he hopes the facility's opera
tors continue to be environmentally conscious.
The facility will "satisfy Stanford's chilled water
capacity for 10 years," Reid said. Plans are current
ly in store to allow for capacity for the next 20 years.
According to Reid, the plant will bring Stan
ford's total chilled water production to about
20,000 ton hours. Not only will the facility be one of
the largest plants on the West Coast, but also the
University's ice storage facility is the "third largest
facility in the world," Reid said.
Last summer, around the middle of August,
Stanford saw temperatures in the mid-90s. While
Stanford's typical summer temperatures are in the
mid-HOs, "temperatures in the low 90s occur about
20 times a year," Reid said.
With this plant Stanford should not have a prob
lem providing air-conditioning, even on unusually
warm days. The new facility will he adjacent to the
old plant on Jordan Way and Campus Drive.
