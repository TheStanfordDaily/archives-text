## Gun laws full of loopholes 
### 
DENVER (AP) — The Columbine High massacre
has demonstrated just how complicated and full of loop
holes the nation's overlapping gun laws are.
Federal law makes it illegal for a licensed gun dealer
to sell a handgun to anyone under 21 or to sell a rifle to
anyone under 18. Colorado law makes it illegal in most
cases to give a handgun to a minor.
So it would seem an easy case for prosecutors to
charge Dylan Klebold's 18-year-old girlfriend for
allegedly buying a semiautomatic handgun and giving it
to two minors who used it in a attack in which they killed
12 students, a teacher and themselves.
If only it were that easy, prosecutors say.
There are 30,(KX) gun laws at the federal, state and
local level, and many are peppered with loopholes.
"It's a fragmented set of laws," said David Akerson, a
Denver criminal lawyer. "The loopholes are giant."
For instance, to prosecute on the charge of giving a

handgun to a minor under Colorado law, prosecutors
must show that the giver "knowingly or recklessly" gave
the gun with the knowledge that the minor planned to
break the law. So prosecutors must determine what
Robyn Anderson knew and when she knew it.
The federal law that bars handgun sales to anyone
under 21 doesn't apply to so-called private sales, so an
unlicensed dealer can sell a handgun like the TEC DC-9
used in Littleton to an 18-year-old. Authorities say Ms.
Anderson bought the assault pistol in a gun show, where
private sellers vie for buyers along with licensed dealers
who must follow stricter rules.
Private sellers don't have to perform a background
check or comply with the waiting period created in the
1994 Brady bill.
President Clinton has called for a crackdown on gun
show sales, requiring all sellers to comply with the laws
made for dealers.

The Littleton shootings draw attention to the loopholes in gun laws. Local residents complain that they
do not want the accused shooters, their crosses shown above, to be included in reference to victims.
