# Deke house in jeopardy
## Wais, fraternity discuss future of 592 Mayfield 
### Anuj Gupta Staff writer 
Dean of Students Marc Wais
scheduled a press conference last
night in which he planned to reveal
an important decision following a
meeting with the Delta Kappa Ep
silon fraternity, but he has post
poned an announcement until
today in order to continue meeting
with the Dekes.
Wais declined comment, and
Deke members would only con

firm that a meeting was held with
Wais last night.
However, a source with knowl
edge of the situation informed The
Daily that the Dekes are in danger
of losing their house at 592 May
field for next year because not
enough students pledged Deke to
allow the fraternity to fill the
house.
If the Dekes' rush numbers
were indeed insufficient, the fra
ternity would be violating the "100
percent rule" instituted by the
University's administration last
year.
The rule mandates that all
housed Greek organizations fill


Wais
their houses with 100 percent mem
bership in order to retain occupan
cy of their house.
Last year the Theta Xi fraterni
ty lost its house at 717 Dolores be
cause of its inability to comply with
the rule by filling its housing re
quirement.
Senior Todd Husak, a member
of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
an unhoused fraternity which lost
its house in 1995, said that some
members of his fraternity are plan
ning to pledge Deke in an effort to
help the Dekes save their house.
Husak said "there is a small
number that is going to go through
with" such an effort.
The Dekes have lost their house
once before.
In June 1997, following an alco
hol-related pledge incident, Wais
evicted the Dekes from their
house.
However, after the Dekes met a
set of requirements related to
membership, alcohol education
programs and community service,
Wais decided last April to allow the
fraternity to move back into the
house this year.
