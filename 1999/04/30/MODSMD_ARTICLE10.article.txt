Two Stanford professors were
elected to the National Academy of
Sciences Tuesday. With Matthew
Scott, professor of developmental
biology, and Norman Sleep, profes
sor of geophysics, Stanford has 113
faculty members serving on the
academy.
Scott is noted for his co-discovery
of homeoboxes, the central control

ling mechanisms for development.
He also is recognized for his discov
ery of a gene flaw that serves as the
genetic basis for skin cancer.
"Matthew is an innovative devel
opmental biologist who believes
strongly in going from the laborato
ry bench to the hospital," said Lucy
Shapiro, one of Scott's colleagues.
Scott joined the faculty in 1990,
after earning a bachelor's degree
and a doctorate from MIT and

teaching at the University of Col
orado, Boulder. He is currently as
sociate chair of the Department of
Developmental Biology.
Sleep joined the faculty in 1979.
He has done research on plate tec
tonics, the structure of mid-oceanic
ridges and mantle plumes, regions of
magma that form islands.
"1 was honored and surprised to
receive this award. I wasn't expect
ing it," Sleep said.

He taught at Northwestern Uni
versity prior to coming to Stanford
and received his master's and doc
toral degrees from MIT.
He is also a fellow of the Ameri
can Association for the Advance
ment of Science.
The academy was formed during
the U.S. Civil War to advise the gov
ernment on scientific issues that
have national and international ef
fects.
