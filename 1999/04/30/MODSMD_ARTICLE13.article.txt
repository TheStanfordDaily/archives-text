Honda kills electric car production
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Honda will stop building electric cars,
writing them off in their infancy as expensive, inconvenient and unpop
ular flops.
While environmentalists criticized the move, it may he indicative of
the auto industry's movement away from pure-electric cars and toward
hybrids that use other low-emission technology such as fuel cells.
"If we were making money on the cars it would be a different story,
but these are not moneymakers," American Honda Motor Co.
spokesman Art Garner said yesterday in Torrance.
Environmentalists said Honda has prematurely abandoned the tech
nology, which is designed to help rid car exhaust from high-population
areas.
Pure-electric cars satisfy the state's stringent air-quality rules, which
mandate that, starting in 2(X)3, 6 percent of all new cars sold by top
automakers must be low-emission vehicles.
California has an additional 2(X)3 requirement that 4 percent of all
new vehicles produce zero-emissions.
Only electric cars, which emit no smoke at all, satisfy that require
ment. Though they don't meet the 4 percent requirement, hybrid fuel
cars produce less smoke than conventional cars and may better satisfy
the needs of motorists, said Christopher Cedergren, an automotive ana
lyst.
'Gas-Out' protest set for today
SAN JOSE (AP) — A statewide boycott of gas stations set for today
is being fueled by World Wide Web surfers angry about high prices at
the pump.
Protesters have launched an e-mail blitz to reach as many disgruntled
commuters as possible.
Though the original cyberspace organizer's identity is not known, his
apparent intention is to cause oil companies to have an oversupply of
gasoline, ultimately forcing them to lower pump prices.
Gasoline in California averaged $1.57 a gallon this week, down from
$1.62 per gallon a week before, the California Energy Commission
reported. In February, it was $1.10 a gallon.
Gasoline companies have blamed the dramatic price increases on a
series of refinery problems in California, which cut supplies. The prob
lem is exacerbated because the state requires a special formulation to
fight air pollution, so fuel designed for other states can't be sold without
special state permission.
