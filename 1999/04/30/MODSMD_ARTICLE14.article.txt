# Jackson attempts to free U.S. POWs

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
(AP) — The Rev. Jesse Jackson
arrived in Belgrade yesterday on a
mission to win freedom for three
U.S. POWs held by Yugoslavia.
Jackson, who arrived in Zagreb,
Croatia, before driving to the Ser
bian capital, said he hoped freeing
the American soldiers could give
new impetus to peace efforts,
although the White House has
demanded their unconditional
release. The three were captured
March 31 along the Yugoslav-
Macedonian border.
"My experience has been when
ever captured soldiers are released,
it at least creates a window for dia
logue," Jackson said. He was
accompanied by a delegation of
U.S. religious leaders on the trip to
Belgrade, where they hoped to
meet Milosevic and see the prison
ers.
Jackson went to Syria in 1984,
where he successfully arranged the
release of a U.S. Navy pilot whose
jet bomber was shot down by Syrian
anti-aircraft over Lebanon.
Several months later, Jackson
worked out arrangements with
Cuba for the release of 48 American
and Cuban political prisoners.
As the bombings persisted for
the 37th day, former Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
launched his latest peace initiative,

promoting what Moscow said was a
new plan for ending the Kosovo cri
sis.
While acknowledging "move
ment" toward a settlement follow
ing talks with the Russian envoy,
German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder insisted that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic has to
withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo
first before the bombing could be
suspended.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan met in Moscow with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, who
stressed the need for the United
Nations to play a major role.
"The stakes are now very high,
not only for the Balkans and
Europe, but for the whole world,"
Yeltsin said.
In Bonn, the first stop on a mis
sion that will also include Rome and
Belgrade, Chernomyrdin insisted a
halt to the bombing was a precondi
tion for peace talks, something the
alliance has repeatedly refused.
"What talks can there be other
wise? It is useless trying to resolve
the problem under bombs," Cher
nomyrdin said.
Afterward, Vice President A 1
Gore spoke to Chernomyrdin by
phone to reiterate NATO condi
tions for ending air strikes before
the Russian envoy went to Bel
grade, a Gore spokesman in Wash

ington said.
The Russian plan calls for a
U.N.-con trolled international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
"An international presence in
Serbia's Kosovo province is not a

problem," the spokesman of Milo
sevic's Socialist Party, Ivica Dacic,
said yesterday. "Hut only a civilian
and unarmed mission under U.N.
auspices, with Russia's participa
tion. would be acceptable.
