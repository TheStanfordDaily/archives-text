What people at Stanford
think is important
enough to write about

OF ALL THE things that Stan
ford students and faculty hold
dear, their ideas are among
the most precious. As the opinions
editor of The Daily, I have the distinct
honor of hearing a lot of them in the
columns and letters I sift through, and
I've found that Stanford people are
nothing if not interesting.
While the University is very
diverse, at least according to
Approaching Stanford, many ideas
seem to fall into a few distinct cate
gories.
The most noticeable musings seem
to he the unique slices of life that owe
most of their cultural context to Jerry
Seinfeld.
While Stanford probably won't pro
duce anything quite as brilliant as
"spongeworthy" or "Festivus," we'll
always know about the startlingly
accurate impersonation of the Soup
Nazi that happens every day at the
Post Office with those little pink pack
age slips.
Second are the scathing letters,
hOften earning in a deluge, in response
to anything controversial that gets
printed in The Daily.
Most of the time, they make valid
points that were overlooked in the
article or editorial. However, some
stop just short of insulting the mothers
of everyone on the editorial board.
These letters have taught me one
important lesson: never attack anyone
for showing porn.
Not to be forgotten are those little
nuggets of wisdom that are the perfect
size to be plastered on a coffee mug.
Ranging from "find an issue and take
a stand on it" to "stop doing that Econ
51 problem set and take some time for
yourself," these never fail to be good

suggestions. Unfortunately, they only
seem relevant to certain people at
very specific times.
An occasional letter arrives that
appears to derive the meaning of life
from something like the graduate stu
dent housing crisis or NA TO policy in
Kosovo.
Iliese letters often come from bril
liant people, who (much like
Kierkegaard) I wish I could under
stand. As it stands, though, their logic
ends up about as comprehensible to
me as "So, if she weighs the same as a
duck ... she's a witch!"
The final category of ideas that I
come across are more difficult to deal
with.
Many people who write letters
point out that The Daily and the cam
pus as a whole exhibit a dangerous
current of anti-intellectualism and fail
to challenge University policy at criti
cal times.
Despite the phantom menace of
SLE in these letters, the point is well
taken. Stanford is very susceptible to
accepting the status quo and both apa
thy and anti-intellectualism are pre
sent in disturbing quantities. More
than any other type, however, these
letters too often have an air of hubris
or even occasional intolerance.
I have formed a couple of conclu
sions from reading things that Stan
ford students and faculty have cared
enough about to sit down and put into
writing.
First, we all come up with a lot of
excellent ideas. Second, we can rest
assured that nearly everyone will get a
joke about dating at Stanford.
And I've learned one other thing as
opinions editor: Don't go after the
Post Office.
It's only slightly more effective than
getting into a land war in Asia or going
in against a Sicilian when death is on
the line.
