## Breaking up is hard to do

Alone at 4 a.m.
on a pole-vault
crash pad. strug
gling to fall asleep in the
rip-off. blisteringlv cold
summer air. one under
stands with full certainty
that, while there may be a

bright day after every dark night, one can
not choose when the dark night ends.
Trudging numbly and masochistically
through the same mutually degrading,
awful argument — for what not only seems
like but really is the l(X)th time — with a
girlfriend with whom relations had become
stale months ago, one understands with full
certainty that one am and should choosc
exactly when some things end.
Drinking in the incomparably fun,
bright, majestic glow of that nymph of a girl
friend with whom, it turns out, relations
haven't quite ceased to please, and who.
one is reminded, is half woman and half
goddess, one understands with full certainty
that amidst some of the most stale stuff lies
some of the most sweet and delicious stuff.
And that giving it up, cold turkey, is proba
bly impossible. As is severing interpersonal
ties without badly hurting somebody one
really cares about.
It is through such realizations that one
comes to understand how easily huge por
tions of one's life can fall into "lost lime,"
the period between when one has decided
that one absolutely wants to end something
and when one actually ends it. When one

wishes that the cold dark night were over,
one consigns one's sell" to living in lost time
until the sun rises. When one chooses that a
good and profitable romance has run its
course, one consigns oneself to living in lost
time until one successfully brings that
romance to a close. To live in lost time is to
live in the gap between choice and action, to
be a hesitation.
Endings are understood as occasions for
permanently saying good-bye to good
things, for voiding particular versions of the
future, for disappointing people, for hurt
ing.
Ending things is an activity which not
only has many undesirable consequences,
such as making somebody you love cry but
which also is. in itself, extremely unpleasant.
Studying can be unpleasant, hut at least
it has almost exclusively positive repercus
sions. Ending, on the other hand, is painful
both now and in the future, making it one of
the least desirable activities there is.
Wanting to end things is no more diffi
cult than being dissatisfied or bored. Yet
actually doing it is one of the most repellent
chores known to man. Thus one's life easily
leaks away as lost time.
But the repugnance of endings results
from a badly mistaken conception of what
an ending actually is. a conception which
equates ending with stopping, closing, cau
terizing. expiring, concluding, killing, pass
ing, putting to sleep. In this view, the ending
of an ineffably fantastic collegiate odvssey
or the closing down of a warm and varied

romance each constitutes both a death and
a birth. At graduation, college dies, but a
new world of spectacular possibility is born.
In breaking up, a relationship dies, but a
glimmering, wine-dark sea of alluring and
novel fish unfolds.
The ending, when done well, is neither a
death nor a birth. Rather, it is a continua
tion. a creative act which lets that which
mattered to all involved live on in some new
way.
Breaking up with one's girlfriend is not
the severing of ties with a beloved human
being but the cooperative generation of a
more honest and natural way to be with her.
a way which continues to weave a few of the
mosrbemitiful patterns of the old romance
into the rich and vast fabric of one's post
break-up life. The patterns which are cho
sen for continuation may be party-going, or
jazz-playing, or just hanging out, or just hav
ing sex, or salsa dancing, or designing solar
cars, or going to big-budget action movies,
or trashing Yanni and John Tesh. They
need not die.
Those beautiful and unique patterns
which are not chosen for continuation may
be varied and remade with new people. The
patterns that matter do not die and give way
for new patterns. Rather they replicate and
blossom in the fabric sewn by innumerable
hands after the ending.
