Looking again at Littleton
I was disturbed by one comment in Tues
day's otherwise excellent Daily editorial on
the Colorado shootings. The editorial
claimed that the tragedy of Littleton has
proven that "social problems cannot be
fixed through legislation."
What it has really proven is that legisla
tion has not vet truly attempted to solve
these problems.
Stopping guns from being available to
kids at the corner store may he a band-aid
solution, but the purpose of band-aids is to
stop more blood from (lowing so that the
real healing can begin.
I agree that television, although an easy
target, is not to be blamed. You don't
become what you watch, you read what you
see in the language of what you are becom
ing.
A self-contented person will see praise
for law and virtue in the exact same words
or actions that an alienated person might
view more negatively. Television's effect, if
any. is a gauge rather than a catalyst of the
greater problem.
While recently speaking at Stanford,
Danny Glover pointed out the crucial yet
consistently overlooked fact that Littleton
was not simply a sick abnormality. Instead,
it was a dramatic demonstration of the
estrangement that many kids feel.
This root problem often drives them to

commit less sensational suicides, or to drop
out of school. Same emotions, different
reactions.
I don't know how to solve this feeling of
societal limenality. The Daily editorial sug
gested we look "within" ourselves for
answers, but while I agree that placing
blame on everybody hut yourself is never
useful, there is also a danger in this suggest
ed approach.
Those boys looked within themselves
and found the wrong answer. Saying that
the solution for a societal problem should
only he a matter of individualism is much
the same mentality that started this tragedy
in the first place: the severing of individuals
from a responsible and supportive commu
nity (and legislative) consciousness.
We need to show kids who feel alone and
afraid that there are other ways than death
to ask for help.

Violence in an escapist society
In her Wednesday column, April Van
Scherpe makes a bold claim that in our soci
ety, "people have become afraid to set an
end limit to taking liberties."
It is true that libertarian culture does a
ptxir job regulating the behavior of individ
uals.

This is not a new development. Nor is the
violence that afflicts such a society.
The Colorado incident illustrates in hold
strokes that a society built on aggression
and exploitation, which breeds violence in
one locale and then moves on. will eventu
ally be devoured by its own violence.
Ours is a culture of violence.
Witness, for example, the incredible vio
lence exacted against black men in the peri
od before the turn of the century, a time
when by some estimates two humans were
lynched every week for two decades.
Communities like Littleton were built
most vigorously in the l%()s as "havens" for
the middle classes. They were built because
the violence of the "long hot summer" riots
scared the hell out of us, so we no longer
recognized our own neighborhoods. They
were built for those who could afford to
escape the dynamo of violence set in motion
in the inner cities through market patterns
that reward exploitation.
This has always been the pattern of
development in the United States: Enter
virgin territory, exploit its resources, con
centrate wealth among few and violence
naturally follows.
The middle class response? Move to new
virgin territory! Run from the problem
instead of facing it and making the difficult
decisions required to solve our own messes.
How can a generation of adults that has
made the childish decision to run from its

problems expect its children to respond to
the tribulations of adolescence in an adult
manner?
Until we act decisively to alter our eco
nomic systems and growth patterns, to curb
the violence committed against the earth
and against the less privileged classes, vio
lence will find us in our most secure subur
ban resorts.

Diversions was funny
When 1 read the parody letter from Uni
versity Provost Condoleezza Rice in Mon
day's Daily, I laughed out loud.
Humor is a matter of taste 1 guess, but I
for one really liked the piece, and I hope
you guys keep it up.
Plus, it really bothers me that as soon as
someone goes and makes fun of a Universi
ty administrator or even someone who real
ly deserves it like the post office, Stanford
professors and students inevitably rise up
and whine about how that's not funny and
how you should apologize. Well, 1 think it's
funny.
Daily: make fun of whomever you want.
Rest of Stanford: chill out.
