# Profs. discuss nukes in Pakistan, India
## Experts say concern justified in South Asia 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
The India-Pakistan nuclear stand
off was the focus of a History Depart
ment teach-in on "Post Cold War Se
curity: India and Pakistan One Year
After the Tests" yesterday after
noon.
The teach-in brought together vis
iting Assoe. Religious Studies Prof.
Ebrahim Moosa, Assoc. Political Sci
ence Prof. Scott Sagan and visiting
History Prof. Thomas Simons to dis
cuss the causes and consequences of
India and Pakistan's May 1998 nu
clear bomb tests from their own area
of expertise.
"We should talk and think about
what else is going on in the world
other than Kosovo." said Simon, a
former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.
Simons referred to a detailed time
line, dating from Indian indepen

dence in 1947 to the most recent mis
sile tests in April as he spoke.
"We still don't know if the world is
more or less safe [after the bomb
tests]," he said.
After speaking briefly about India
and Pakistan's shared historical and
religious antagonism, Simons said
the more immediate reasons for the
tests were the end of the Cold War
and domestic politics in both coun
tries.
"The [United States] cut aid to
Pakistan in 1 WO," he said. "They felt
like we threw them away like used
Kleenex. We didn't need them [as al
lies] after the Soviets left
Afghanistan."
In 1991 India lost its patron when
the Soviet Union collapsed, accord
ing to Simons. "What you have [after
19911 is two countries, home alone, in
a world that cared less about them
than ever." he said.
In the vacuum of Cold War al
liances. the rise of India's conserva
tive Bharatiya Janata Party led to the
nuclear tests in a bid for enhanced in
ternational status, Simons said. Pak
istan's response 17 days later was also
a direct effect of internal politics, he
said.
Sagan, co-director of the Center
for International Security and Coop
eration, said the "gotnl news" is there
are currently only eight nuclear na
tions in the world: China, France.
Great Britain, India, Israel. Pakistan,
Russia and the United States.
Contrary to what critics of U.S.
involvement in South Asia say,
worrying about the arms build-up
between India and Pakistan is not
ethnocentric or racist, Sagan said.
During the Cold War, there were
three examples of U.S.-Soviet es
calation that nearly caused nuclear
war, he said.
The causes were accident from
false information, overconfidence in
the stabilizing ability of nuclear
weapons and unauthorized launches
of nuclear missiles, he said. Accord
ing to Sagan, these scenarios in the
context of India and Pakistan could
lead to a devastating nuclear ex
change.
"In 1989 a Colorado military base
saw a full launch by Russians on their
radar screen," Sagan said. "U.S.
forces were ready to be launched [in
response]." The "launch" was actual
ly a training tape showing what real
launches look like," he said. "We had
30 minutes to decide [what to do|.
India and Pakistan have six minutes
at the most."
Sagan said that military comman
ders can also be over confident in the
deterrence ability of nuclear

weapons and decide to be more ag
gressive with conventional warfare.
Finally, he said, sometimes military
officers can decide on their own au
thority to use weapons.
"I hope that the basic message the
U.S. government gives is that India
and Pakistan shouldn't be like the
U.S. and Russia in the Cold War,
[with weapons ready for deploy
ment], but more like the way India
and Pakistan are now [with de-alert
ed forces]," Sagan said.
M(X)sa spoke about misconcep
tions of the "Islamic bomb," a name
given by former Pakistani Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to Pak
istan's nuclear program.
"The rhetoric... must be careful
ly analyzed and not taken at face
value," he said. "The specter of the
islamic bomb' feeds tin two states of
mind or two kinds of psychoses:
Western Islamophobia and Muslim
sense of wounded memory."
According to Moosa, there is a
suspicion among Muslims that, like
the Jews of the 19405, they are be
coming targets for ethnic cleansing.
"The same suspicions may under
pin the search for Muslim power and
the widespread acquisition of the
bomb," he said.
If any serious attempt is to be
made to deal with non-proliferation.
Western policy-makers must be pre
pared to deal with Muslim nations
with sensitivity and as equals, Moosa
said.
"It is interesting to get a variety of
viewpoints on the situation," said
Sajid Chinoy, a doctoral candidate in
economics who attended the event.
"This discussion did not provide any
answers but brought out the right
questions to ask."
