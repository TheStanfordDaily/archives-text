AF I ER TWO YEARS of trying to
deny the truth, of spending each
day attempting to hide from the
horrible, depressing reality that 1 knew 1
couldn't avoid. I've finally accepted it. I
can't resist any longer. Yes, it's true.
Stanford girls suck.
I can hear the outcry already, but I'm
going to plow right ahead. How can I make
such a bold, ridiculous over-generalization?
Well, let's begin, as always, with my own
experiences and observations. Before 1
came to Stanford. I had come up with a tool,
a powerful concept that guided me through
all of my interactions with all females.
1 call this concept the Null Hypothesis.
Briefly stated, it postulates that every
female is attracted to me until she proves
that she isn't. What a cocky bastard, you're
probably saying. But this hypothesis is not
arrogance—just a positive outlook on life.
I know that there are many guys who are
more attractive than me in a lot of different
ways. And many, in fact probably most,
females have demonstrated that I'm just not
worthv of their amorous attention. But

despite the usual outcome, things always
started out hopeful. I always felt a tickle of
excitement when 1 met a female, a little but
terfly in my stomach (or sometimes further
down) that this particular girl might like me.
I always believed 1 had a chance.
Stanford girls don't allow for that
chance. They don't allow the Null Hypothe
sis to spring into action. They beat it down,
spit on it and laugh at its very premise. Why
does this happen? Why does that chance
slip away before it even shows its face?
Well, despite the likely temptation to
blame it on my body odor or some other
undesirable characteristic, 1 posit several
reasons, which clearly put females at fault.
Let's begin. First we'll eliminate the
super-pretty, popular girls from serious con
sideration. They've always given the Null
Hypothesis the least amount of time to act
and are usually too in love with themselves
to give an average guv a chance.
Now we'll move on to a particularly large
category of females. These are the lapdogs
of the first group, the ladies who weren't
quite as pretty or popular in high school but

who now, for some reason, believe they've
moved up to that next level. These girls,
who usually major in Hum Bio, only go for
the jocks or hard-core frat boys because
that's the scene they missed in high school,
and now they're going to live it up.
The next segment of the female popula
tion falls into the category that 1 call "rela
tionship girls." These women always seem
to have some kind of serious boyfriend and
come in two varieties. First we have the
long-distance, high-school relationship that
still hasn't sputtered to an ignoble end. Sec
ond, and the far more evil of the two, is the
"I'm still dating the guy 1 started going out
with the first month of freshman year" type.
This phenomenon occurs when a girl gets to
college after never having had a serious
relationship and latches onto the first guy
who shows any interest, refusing to let go.
Let's face it ladies, is your boyfriend really
all that cool? The answer is undoubtedly no,
but he's easier than the single life.
All right, now that we've covered a lot of
ground, let's include everyone else. The
females who don't fall into one of the above

classifications have a very clear explanation
for their failure to abide by the Null
Hypothesis. 1 call this explanation the
Grand Conspiracy.
Every year, the incoming freshman class
of females has a special orientation before
the males arrive. These women attend a
special session in Memorial Auditorium,
perhaps led by the Program in Feminist
Studies (note that this cannot be con
firmed). They listen to a speech, the gist of
which sounds like: "Stanford women, our
time has come. After centuries of enduring
obnoxious male behavior and emotional
abuse, it's time to fight back. Instead of
being friendly and initially interested in
most guys who approach you, you must
maintain a cold and stand-offish demeanor.
You must select your hook-ups and
boyfriends at random, in a pattern so illogi
cal that no normal male will be able to com
prehend your bizarre behavior. And there
are certain males whom you should avoid at
all costs. If they sit at a table near you, get
up and leave. If they try to start a conversa
tion, turn your back to them. Here's an

example of one such male (picture of Mark
Silver shown on screen)."
The clearest illustration of the Grand
Conspiracy occurs during Admit Weekend.
1 walk around, seeing pro fro girls smile
and act like they're open to my approach.
They have yet to be indoctrinated.
My last explanation for the failure of the
Null Hypothesis at Stanford is pure biology.
Some guys emit chemicals, called
pheromones, which attract all kinds of
females despite their obvious lameness.
Any obnoxious dork can find a girl, as long
as he's got the right pheromones. This bio
logical explanation solves the puzzle of
many hook-ups and relationships at Stan
ford, most of them involving Kappa Sig.
So these are all of the factors at Stanford
working against the Null Hypothesis. I hope
they're useful to some males out there who
are feeling down about their prospects here.
The only advice I can offer is to buy some
pheromones, or maybe join Kappa Sig.
