## Baseball faces Beavers in midst of chase 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
At first glance, this weekend's
three-game series has little to offer
the Stanford baseball team.
A second-division opponent
clearly playing out the season as it
finds itself lost in the mix of a new
conference. A team that the Cardinal
has not faced in 13 years, so there's no
real rivalry, either.
What does that leave, then?
Well, only the Pacific 10 Confer
ence title.
As Stanford heads into its final six
games of Pac-10 action, the sixth

ranked Cardinal still finds itself tied
for first plaee with USC after taking
two of three games from California
last weekend. With three games
against eighth-place Oregon State
(15-30, 3-12 Pac-10) this weekend,
the Cardinal (30-12, 14-4) can ill af
ford a slip-up this late in the season.
At the very worst, the series
should he an opportunity to pick up
some easy victories and keep pace
with the No. 17 Trojans (28-20,14-4),
who will be jousting with crosstown
rival UCLA this weekend.
But in order to do that, Stanford
needs to rekindle some of its early
season pitching effectiveness. In the

last five games, the Cardinal hurlers
have allowed an average of more
than nine runs a game. At times, the

pitching has resembled batting prac
tice, although most of the recent cul
prits of this phenomenon took a step
in the right direction in Stanford's last
game.
Tuesday night's 8-3 win over San
Jose State was less a game and more a
study in regaining confidence for the
Cardinal pitching staff. Senior left
hander Tony Cogan, freshman right
hander J.D. Wilcox and sophomore
right-hander Justin Wayne combined
to pitch seven-plus innings of score
less ball.
"We've reached a point here in
the last five or six games in which we
haven't done a good job of holding

people," said Stanford head coaeh
Mark Marquess. "I think it's just one
of those things with a hitter where
we've reaehed a slump. That's why
we pitehed all those guys [Tuesday].
What we're going to do is to give
them some more work, and make a
few adjustments with their pitches
and give them some confidence and
go from there.
"We're concerned about it, but
we've got enough guys to try."
