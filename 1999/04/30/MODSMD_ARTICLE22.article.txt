## Baseball faces Beavers in midst of chase 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
At first glance, this weekend's
three-game series has little to offer
the Stanford baseball team.
A second-division opponent
clearly playing out the season as it
finds itself lost in the mix of a new
conference. A team that the Cardinal
has not faced in 13 years, so there's no
real rivalry, either.
What does that leave, then?
Well, only the Pacific 10 Confer
ence title.
As Stanford heads into its final six
games of Pac-10 action, the sixth

ranked Cardinal still finds itself tied
for first plaee with USC after taking
two of three games from California
last weekend. With three games
against eighth-place Oregon State
(15-30, 3-12 Pac-10) this weekend,
the Cardinal (30-12, 14-4) can ill af
ford a slip-up this late in the season.
At the very worst, the series
should he an opportunity to pick up
some easy victories and keep pace
with the No. 17 Trojans (28-20,14-4),
who will be jousting with crosstown
rival UCLA this weekend.
But in order to do that, Stanford
needs to rekindle some of its early
season pitching effectiveness. In the

last five games, the Cardinal hurlers
have allowed an average of more
than nine runs a game. At times, the

pitching has resembled batting prac
tice, although most of the recent cul
prits of this phenomenon took a step
in the right direction in Stanford's last
game.
Tuesday night's 8-3 win over San
Jose State was less a game and more a
study in regaining confidence for the
Cardinal pitching staff. Senior left
hander Tony Cogan, freshman right
hander J.D. Wilcox and sophomore
right-hander Justin Wayne combined
to pitch seven-plus innings of score
less ball.
"We've reached a point here in
the last five or six games in which we
haven't done a good job of holding

people," said Stanford head coaeh
Mark Marquess. "I think it's just one
of those things with a hitter where
we've reaehed a slump. That's why
we pitehed all those guys [Tuesday].
What we're going to do is to give
them some more work, and make a
few adjustments with their pitches
and give them some confidence and
go from there.
"We're concerned about it, but
we've got enough guys to try."
Also looking to get reacquainted
with his former self is staff ace Jason
Young, who will take the mound
tonight. Since running his record to -
I after a win against Washington
State April 1, the sophomore right
hander has two losses and a no-deci
sion in three starts. In his last IS 2/3 in
nings of work, Young has given up 16
runs and allowed 20 hits.
The Beavers mav be hard-pressed
to put up similar numbers on Young,
or any other Stanford pitcher for that
matter. Oregon State ranks last in the
Pac-1() in several offensive cate
gories, including runs scored, RBIs,
slugging percentage and home runs.
The pitching is not much better, as
the Beaver staff has allowed a confer
ence-worst 375 runs, 321 of those
earned. Opponents have teed off on
OSU pitching, hitting a league-lead
ing .3IS. By comparison, Stanford
has given up only ISI earned runs
and allowed opponents to hit .255,

both league lows.
The lone pitching highlight for
()regon State comes tomorrow when
reigning Pac-1() Pitcher of the Week
B.K. Cook starts for the Beavers. The
only pitcher other than Young to be
named conference pitcher of the
week more than once this season,
( ook is coming oi l' a complete-game
win at Washington in which he struck
out a career-high 13 batters.
"Cook is the guy that's won all
their league games," Marquess said.
"Hopefully, our guys are aware that
the league and competition is such
that on any given weekend, you can
get beat."
The Cardinal knows that lesson all
too well, having endured a stretch in
which it dropped three out of four
conference games. Nevertheless,
Stanford still finds its first-place
standing intact and this weekend pro
vides a fresh opportunity to right it
self and put itself in good position to
ward off the Trojans.
