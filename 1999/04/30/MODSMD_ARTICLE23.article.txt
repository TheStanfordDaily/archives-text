# Bay Area matchup rests on long history

### Ben Allen Staff writer 
The rivalry began innocently
enough.
California and Stanford met on
the track for the first time in friendly
competition April 22, 1X93 at the
Olympic Club Grounds in San Fran
cisco. Events contested that day in
cluded the one-mile walk and the
two-mile bicycle race, and the gen
tlemen of Cal walked away with a
91-35 victory over Stanford.
Since then, animosity between
the schools has grown. The rivalry
has festered. The competition has
become cutthroat, and at tomor
row's l()sth incarnation of the Big
Meet, Stanford and Cal will once
again trade blows in a rough-and
tumble, no-holds-barred grudge
match. And Stanford has a score to
settle.
The story of the Big Meet paral
lels the story of the Cal-Stanford ri
valry. Missed only during the war
years, 1944-45, the Big Meet is one
of both schools' longest standing
athletic traditions. In 1966, the Big
Meet was contested twice. Stanford
won both times.
From the inception of the Big
Meet up until 1971. Stanford held an
edge in the rivalry meet. Stanford
was at its pinnacle of dual-meet
greatness that year when future
Olympian Don Kardong, then com
peting for the Stanford Indians
under the tutelage of coaching leg
end Payton Jordan, smeared his face
