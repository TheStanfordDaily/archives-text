# Bay Area matchup rests on long history
## 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
The rivalry began innocently
enough.
California and Stanford met on
the track for the first time in friendly
competition April 22, 1X93 at the
Olympic Club Grounds in San Fran
cisco. Events contested that day in
cluded the one-mile walk and the
two-mile bicycle race, and the gen
tlemen of Cal walked away with a
91-35 victory over Stanford.
Since then, animosity between
the schools has grown. The rivalry
has festered. The competition has
become cutthroat, and at tomor
row's l()sth incarnation of the Big
Meet, Stanford and Cal will once
again trade blows in a rough-and
tumble, no-holds-barred grudge
match. And Stanford has a score to
settle.
The story of the Big Meet paral
lels the story of the Cal-Stanford ri
valry. Missed only during the war
years, 1944-45, the Big Meet is one
of both schools' longest standing
athletic traditions. In 1966, the Big
Meet was contested twice. Stanford
won both times.
From the inception of the Big
Meet up until 1971. Stanford held an
edge in the rivalry meet. Stanford
was at its pinnacle of dual-meet
greatness that year when future
Olympian Don Kardong, then com
peting for the Stanford Indians
under the tutelage of coaching leg
end Payton Jordan, smeared his face

Meet.
with war paint and went out to seal
Cal's doom by winning the two-mile
run.
At that point, the all-time reeord
favored Stanford, 40-35-2.
Then came the drought.
For 26 years, Stanford could not
muster a win against its Bay Area ri
vals. Great athletes came and left the
Farm over those years. James Lofton
long jumped nearly 27 feet in 1978,
but Stanford did not win that year.
Jeff Atkinson ran a 3 minute, 55.3 sec
ond mile in 1986, but Cal was again
too strong. In 1988, Brian Marshall
high-jumped seven and a half feet,
but Cal won the Big Meet.
Enter current head coach Vin
Lananna in 1993.
"When I first arrived at Stanford,
the Big Meet was less of a rivalry and
more of a Cal dominance," Lananna

said. "If you go out there and get beat
115-60. that's not a rivalry, that's just
something to do on a Saturday after
noon,"
In fact. Lananna's first year squad
was the recipient of a 103-60 drubbing
from the Cal ranks. But since his ar
rival, Stanford has become a force to
be reckoned with on the national
scene and has also made a steady pro
gression back into competition at the
Big Meet.
In 1997, when Stanford moved its
track venue from the football stadi
um to the beautiful grounds of Cobb
Track and Angell Field, the progres
sion culminated in Stanford's first win
in two-and-a-half decades. Stanford
beat Cal 85-78.
"Over the last few years, we've
made it a great competitive matchup
which has created a lot of excitement
for the fans and the athletes," Lanan
na said.
Though Stanford slipped a little
last year in the Big Meet, losing 92-71.

Lananna admits that Cal's dual-meet
team was superior to the Stanford
squad. This year, he's not so certain
that's the case.
"Ouite simply, Cal had the better
dual-meet team last year, and we had
a better championship-meet team,"
Lananna said. "That may be the case
this year, but I think we've balanced
ourselves out."
And if senior captain and star
hammer thrower Adam Connolly,
who redshirted the 1997 season due
to injury, has anything to do with to
morrow's outcome, Stanford will find
a way to the top.
" This being my last Big Meet and
not having competed [in 1997] makes
it a lot more meaningful since I've got
to be one of the only athletes at this
school who hasn't experienced beat
ing Cal at least once," Connolly said.
For Connolly and company, only
tomorrow's events will decide if Stan
ford will taste victory, or if recent his
tory is doomed to repeat itself.
