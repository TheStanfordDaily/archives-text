What's in a number?
Unfortunately for collegiate track
and field athletes, a number is the dif
ference between qualifying for the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships or the NCA As. But that's not
really what's track is about.

WOMEN'S TRACK

â–  Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Califor
nia, 12:45 p.m.. Cobb Track and An
gel I Field.

Track is about competition.
Stanford track and field is about
beating Cal.
Tomorrow afternoon, the Stan
ford women's track and field team
looks to make it three straight Big
Meet victories over California as the
Farm's Cobb Track and Angell Field
plays host to only its second Big Meet

ever.
For the women, it is the 2()th an
nual running of the meet. Stanford
leads the series. 10-9.
Fifth-year senior distance runner
Sarna Renfro relishes the chance for
a head-to-head confrontation.
"We are running a lot of invita
tionals as opposed to dual meets,
which emphasize running fast and
emphasize running standards, which
is great," Renfro said. "But in college,
you're running for your school, and 1
think it's important to not forget
that."
If all goes as planned for the Car
dinal. the outcome should resemble
last year's score of 113-50.
Renfro and her crew of distance
runners look to rack up big points in
both the 3,(XX) and S.(XX) meters as
Lori Reidy of Cal is the only Bear
that has much of a chance at scoring
against the venerable distance squad.

competition for fellow All-American

to be the most entertaining events of
afternoon. While senior Tracye

folk look to he in control of the 1(X)-
meter hurdles, the 4(X)-meter hurdles

years.
Woolfolk will also team up with
Wilsa Charles in the 1 (X) to take on
Cal's best, including Shanti Oyenuga,
the runner-up last year. In the 4(X).
