## Elway earned the best 
### 
The greatest quarterback Stan
ford ever produced will retire
Sunday.
And there's been surprisingly
little fanfare around the campus
for an event of this importance.
The name "Elway" is identi
fied far more strongly with the city
of Denver and the Broncos than it
ever was with the cardinal and
white, and it's hard sometimes to
remember the days when a far
younger No. 7 crouched under
center in Stanford Stadium.

Nonetheless, John Elway and
Stanford were onee a pair as nat
ural as — well, John Elway and
the Broncos.
He still holds or shares Stan
ford records for career touchdown
passes (77), season touchdown
passes (27 in 1980), and touch
down passes in a game (an aston
ishing six in 1980 against ever-hap
less Oregon State). He is second in
Stanford all-time total offense,
second in both career completions
and career attempts, fourth in all
time career completion percent
age.
So why no call in Palo Alto for
a life-size Elway statue at Arrilla
ga Green? The 1998 Stanford
football media guide gives Elway
about the same press as, say, Dave
Wyman or Justin Armour
The answer, of course, is that
for all Elway's greatness, his teams
weren't very good.
Elway collected a 15-18 record
in three years as a starter from
1980-1982. a 1 -2 Big Game record,
and never sniffed the postseason
in a Stanford uniform. He left the
school a two-time Pac-10 Player of
the Year, consensus All-Ameri
can. was second in the Heisman
voting in 1982 to Herschel Walker
and the first pick in the celebrated
1983 NFL draft.
And despite all the honors, the
records, and the recognition —15-
18.
Looking at the numbers from
Elway's career, one can't help but
be reminded of the Stanford tradi
tion of balancing offense against
defense, or rather, its complete
failure to do so.
The scores of Elway's years re
flect a team not unlike those of the
last few years. His Cardinal lost
games 35-31,38-35, won the occa
sional 54-13 blowout against Ore
gon State.
Indeed, had it not been for the
last two years of his NFL career,
Elway's senior season here might
be seen as a microcosm of his foot
ball life. Spectacular individual
achievement, stunning come
backs — and bitter disappoint
ment waiting at the end.
