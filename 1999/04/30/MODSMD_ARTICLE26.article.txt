The Stanford women's lacrosse team (16-4,9-1 West
ern Women's Lacrosse League) does not remember how
to lose.
It hasn't dropped a league game since Feb. 20.
Why start now?
Now that it's tournament time, the stakes are higher,
the adrenaline is pumping, eyes are set on a champi
onship and losing is not on the agenda.
Tomorrow's Northern Division playoffs mark the first
round of tournament action for the Cardinal. 1 he women

will match up against St. Mary's College (1-7 WWLL) at
2 p.m. in Berkeley.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE

â–  Tomorrow-Sunday: Stanford (16-4, 9-1) at Western
Women's Lacrosse League Northern Division playoffs,
Berkeley.

The Cardinal is 2-0 against St. Mary's this season, both
games ending in 18-3 victories. Two 15-goal spreads leave
little room for doubt that Stanford will have the edge Sat
urday.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, St. Mary's may not

provide the test the women will need to prepare them for
games further down the road in the tournament.
"I want them to be able to continue to play great
lacrosse," said head coach Heidi Connor. "I don't believe
that we've been challenged in the latest string of games."
Since its return from its East Coast swing last month
where the team was challenged by such teams as Penn
sylvania and Cornell, the Cardinal has been struggling to
find competition that can really provide a test. The team
did not lose a game for the whole month of April, outscor
ing its opponents 106-39.
Although tougher competition would be a welcome
change of pace for the Cardinal, the women look at their

decisive victories as proof to themselves and to others
that they are a dominating force in the West, strong
enough to become a threat even to East Coast teams.
"Lacrosse is traditionally an East Coast sport," Con
ner said. "We are striving to find our niche We want
to gain the national recognition that this team deserves.
"We are looking to contend for an NCAA bid within
three years. That is something that is feasible. We are
building a program; every game we win. every league
championship means something in the big picture."
The team's main task tomorrow will be to play their
own game and not lower their level

of play despite the competition.
"We must challenge ourselves to
remain focused and ready for May 8-
9," Connor said.
A loss Saturday would end the

season for the Cardinal, but a win
would give Stanford a berth in the
WWLL Final Four on May 8-9 as the
No. 1 seed in the North. Stanford
would face either No. 2-seeded C 'lare
mont or No. 3-seeded UCLA from
the South Division.
The women look forward to the
Final Four as a true test and a chance
to keep their title as WWLL Final
Four champions.
Connor, whose coaching record
at Stanford over the last two years is
23-9. is counting on her winning for
mula to defend the championship.
"The most important factor is the
will to win. the want to win aiid to
play as a team." Connor said.
The women are optimistic that as
long as they play to their potential, a
win Saturday and eventual victory at
the Final Four will be within reach.
"Now that it is tournament time, it
is time to showcase all of the things
that we have done right this season."
Connor said.
"It is time to put it all together and
play flawlessly. There's no holding
back now. We want it all."
