# Track wary of California
## 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Once a year, Stanford and Califor
nia come together to thresh out their
differences on the track. Once a year,
the two teams face off in a ruthless
event-by-event showdown to claim
Bay Area bragging rights.
Once a year since 1X93, and here
once again tomorrow afternoon.
Stanford and Cal contest the Big
Meet.
Cal leads the historic series 61-41-
2, and Stanford has only won the
meet once in the last 26 years — at
home in 1997. But for No. 2 Stanford,
things are changing.
As predicted, Stanford will throw
all of its available artillery at un
ranked Cal in an all-out attempt at
the Big Meet title. But rankings are
deceptive. Stanford dropped last
year's Big Meet to Cal despite cap
turing second-place honors at the
NCAA Championship meet. Only
one thing is guaranteed: it will be one
hell of a scrap.
Stanford head coach Vin Lananna
believes that this year's squad is the

best all-around team he has coached
since arriving at Stanford in 1992, and
perhaps the most capable of handing
Cal the drubbing it has eluded over
the past few decades.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. Califor
nia, 12:45 p.m., Cobb Track and An
gell Field.

Lananna forecasts a close meet, to
be fought tooth-and-nail.
"Both teams are very well
matched up," Lananna said. "The
meet will be decided by who can grab
the points in the events which are
going to be toss-ups."
He predicts that the jumps and
throws will be fairly well balanced,
but he concedes an edge to Cal in the
sprints.
Stanford will counter with its dis
tance superiority, though Lananna is
hesitant to put too much stock in any
foregone conclusions in the distance
races.
"In the middle and long distances,
who knows what can happen,"
Lananna said. "Those events could

go either way — they are more of a
crap shoot. I project the meet will
come down to the 4-by-4(K) meter
relay."
The 1,600-meter relay is the final
event of the day.
The meet will be scored with five
points for each first place, three for
each second and one for each third,
with five points being awarded to the
champions in each of the 400-meter
and 1,600-meter relays and zero to
the losers.
Stanford has traditionally com
peted all of its best athletes in as many
events as possible in order to maxi
mize point production. This year
looks to be more of the same.
All-Americans Brad and Brent
Hauser are both slated to run the
5,000- and 1,500 meter races, Adam
Connolly will throw both the ham
mer and the shot and Gabe Jennings
is scheduled to make his season debut
in both the 800-and 1,500-meter runs.
NCAA provisional qualifier Jeff
Allen will try to score points in both
the 110- and 400-meter hurdles, and
Jake Maas will run the gamut in the
1,500 and 800 as well.
