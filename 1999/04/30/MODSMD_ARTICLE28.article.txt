When you are one of eight
schools in the toughest conference in
softball, wins are hard to come by.
With that recognition, the Stan
ford softball team (35-IS, 5-13 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) has realized the
challenges it will have to overcome
in order to secure a spot in the post
season.

SOFTBALL

■ Tomorrow: No. 15 Stanford (35-
18, 5-13 Pacific 10 Conference) vs.
No. 10 Arizona State (36-16,7-11), 1
p.m., Stanford Softball Complex.

■ Sunday: Stanford vs. No. 3 Ari
zona (40-10, 12-6), 1 p.m., Stanford
Softball Complex.

"We are in a position right now
where we know we need some wins
going down the stretch," said Stan
ford head coach John Rittman.
Easier said than done.
Despite the fact that the Cardinal
has been playing well, it has the un
fortunate situation of being in the
strongest conference in softball. For
the seventh week in a row, all eight
Pac-10 teams are ranked among the
top 1 K teams in the nation. Stanford,
once ranked as high as seventh, has
fallen to No. 15 after losing three of
four Pac-10 games last weekend to
No. 5 Washington and No. 1 UCLA.
This weekend, Stanford will host
a pair of doubleheaders against con
ference opponents Arizona State
(36-16,7-11) and Arizona (40-10,12-
6). The Cardinal will play the No. 10
Sun Devils tomorrow before taking
on No. 3 Arizona on Sunday.
The twin bills against the Arizona
teams will be a rematch for the Car
dinal. Stanford lost two games to
Arizona State earlier this month 6-0
and 1-0. The same weekend, the
Cardinal fell 3-2 and 2-0 to the Wild
cats. The doubleheaders this week
end could hold the key to the Cardi
nal's postseason.
"We're upbeat and we work
hard," Rittman said. "1 have confi
dence in this team bouncing back."
Coming into the weekend, Ari
zona State has won six out of its last
11 games. Most recently, the Sun
Devils split a doubleheader with No.
17 Oregon. Junior Christine Gill and
freshman Kirsten Voak will lead the

Sun Devils in their attack. Gill is Ari
zona States offensive powerhouse;
She leads the team in home runs
(seven) and RBIs (44). Voak. a
pitcher, is first in the Pac-l0 in strike
outs and posts a l .35 hR A.
The Wildcats' top pitcher, sopho
more Becky Lemke. has been blow
ing opponents away with a 1.38
ERA. Another sophomore. Nicole
Giordano, is first on the team in bat
ting average (,40 c >) and runs scored

(47.)
Stanford has a chance to improve
its Pac-10 standing and set a tone for
the rest of the season. A 5-13 record
in conference play is less than im
pressive. hut Rittman has pointed
out "every team we're playing is a
World Series-caliber team. Any
thing can happen."
Stanford has proved it can play
with its top-ranked opponents.
Seven of the Cardinal's Pac-10 de

feats have come as a result of one
run losses. A 5-13 record could have
easily heen 12-6.
With the last stretch of the season
coming up. Stanford hopes to peak
at the right time.
"As long as we can improve and
stay together as a team, we'll be
there in the postseason," Rittman
said. "If we can learn from our losses
and peak at the right time, we'll be
there."
