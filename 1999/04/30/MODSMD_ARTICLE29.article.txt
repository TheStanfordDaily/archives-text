Badminton:
As most students rested last week
end in the warm California sun, the
Stanford badminton team was
wreaking havoc at this year's Nation
al Collegiate Badminton Champi
onships, held at Swarthmore College.
For the third straight year, Stan
ford took apart the other IS squads,
bringing the national title back to the
Farm. Although not as dominant as
last year's team, which tripled the sec
ond-place opponent's points, the vic
tory was especially meaningful due to

the absence of co-captain and
Olympic hopeful junior Chris Hales.
For the uninitiated, the scoring in
badminton is like swimming. A team
receives one additional point every
time a member of the squad advances
a round. However, only the lop four
singles, the top two doubles and the
top two mixed doubles teams can
score points.
At the end of the tournament.
Stanford had accumulated 85 points,
taking the title by nine over second
place Howard.
Senior Jerry Wong, playing
through the pain of a bleeding
cracked toenail, and sophomore

Mike Pfyl advanced to the men's
doubles final, winning in straight sets
17-14,15-10. Individually, Pfyl made
it to the semifinals, while Wong
fought into the quarterfinals. This
amazing pair, based on their total in
dividual points, were two of the four
All-Americans chosen at the conclu
sion of the tournament
For the women. Deborah-Anna
Reznek advanced to the semifinals of
the women's singles draw, while she
and Wong tore their way through
mixed doubles. The duo lost in the
semifinals to the No. 1 seed, but not
before taking them through a
thrilling three-set ride. 15-7,5-15, 15-

12. Pfyl, teaming up with freshman
Anna Liess. was also able to make it
to the semifinals of the mixed doubles
category, but the young twosome fell
in straight sets.
Women's Rugby:
After taking the Sweet Sixteen by
storm, the Cardinal is headed to Penn
State for the Final Four. Stanford will
face Navy, with the final holding a
possible showdown against Mar
quette, a team that faces Princeton in
the semifinals. The Golden Eagles
defeated the Cardinal two years ago.
and Stanford is ready to return the
favor.
