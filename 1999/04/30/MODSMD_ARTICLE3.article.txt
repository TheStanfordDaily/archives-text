The Faculty Senate voted nearly
unanimously yesterday to pass a re
vamped faculty grievance proce

The new grievance procedure
was developed by a task force ap

and complexity of grievances.
Under the old system, a griev

did not try to find a phrase that
would cover every possible turn of
the screw of complexity."

been made as well. A panel of fact
