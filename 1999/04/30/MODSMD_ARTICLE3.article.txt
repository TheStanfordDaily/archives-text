# Senate approves
## FACULTY SENATE UPDATE 
### Kimberly Downs Jennifer Stewart Staff writers 
The Faculty Senate voted nearly
unanimously yesterday to pass a re
vamped faculty grievance proce
dure.
The new grievance procedure
was developed by a task force ap
pointed by University President
Gerhard Casper last October in re
sponse to the increasing quantity
and complexity of grievances.
Under the old system, a griev
ance typically took a year or more
to work through the system. A
grievance on a departemental de
nial of reappointment or promo
tion was heard initially by the dean,
then appealed to the provost and
then possibly appealed to the pres
ident. who received a recommen
dation on the case from the Advi
sory Hoard after a hearing had
been held.
History Prof. James Sheehan,
who was a member of the task
force, said, "Our effort was to pro

duce a document that is not only
clearer and more easily accessible
but that is also more flexible. We
did not try to find a phrase that
would cover every possible turn of
the screw of complexity."
The procedure will introduce
several changes into the grievance
procedure.
The first change will alter the
level at which appeals begin. Under
the new process all appeals will
begin with the provost, rather than
at the level of the original decision
maker.
The provost then must solicit
input from the Advisory Board be
fore making a decision. The appel
lant then has the option to request
further review by the president,
who now can use his or her discre
tion whether to entertain the ap
peal.
In addition to the procedural
changes made to the grievance pro
cedure, structural changes have
been made as well. A panel of fact
finders will replace the current
grievance officer system. About
eight to 12 fact-finders will be ap
pointed by the provost on stag
gered three-year terms.
"The fact-finder is neither an
agent of the University nor an ad
vocate for the appellant," reads the
Statement on Faculty Appeal Pro
cedures. "The fact-finder's role is
to answer clearly defined questions
of fact [from the provost or Adviso
ry Board] and not to make recom
mendations about how the case
should be resolved."
The faculty grievance procedure
is most commonly consulted when
a member of the faculty chooses to
appeal a tenure decision. However,
these procedures are consulted
whenever a member of the faculty
makes a written request for a re
view of a decision made by a person
or group of people acting in an offi
cial University capacity.
Sheehan stated that under both
the proposed and current grievance
procedures promotion and reap
pointment decisions will be han
dled separately from other matters.
"If Stanford is to continue to have

a tenure-track system, and one that
builds its faculty to as large a degree
as possible from within, we must
have a process of decision-making
that is not only fair and efficient but
that is perceived and accepted as fair
and efficient." Sheehan said.
The grievance procedure has re
cently seen action during the high
profile tenure case of former Asst.
History Prof. Karen Sawislak. Saw
islak was denied tenure in a highly
controversial decision in 1997. She
appealed the decision through the
grievance channels but was ulti
mately denied tenure. She was re
cently invited to return and reapply
but has not yet accepted the offer.
Asst. Native American Studies
Prof. Robert Warrior was recently
denied tenure in a controversial de
cision. Should Warrior appeal his
decision, he would follow the griev
ance procedure in order to protest
his tenure denial.
The revamped grievance proce
dure's success will be assessed in
the fall of 2002 by the provost, who
will then have the option of re
questing further changes to be
made to it.
"I think we can live with this for
three years and find out how it
works," University Provost Con
doleezza Rice said.
