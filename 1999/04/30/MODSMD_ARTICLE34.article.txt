# Asian Pacific Heritage Month kicks off Saturday afternoon
## 
### Jeanine Lavender 
Asian Pacific Heritage Month,
the annual May celebration of Asian
Pacific culture and ancestry, once
again returns to the Stanford campus.
This month's celebration aims to
"showcase Asian culture and identi
fication and bring about some issues
that are facing the community," said
Shelley Tadaki, chair of the Asian
American Students Association.
The month's events highlight the
role Asians and Pacific Islanders
have played in the development of
American culture. The celebration is
designed to educate the entire Stan
ford community and, as Tadaki said,
"everyone is invited."
Senior Ameeta Patel added,
"This year the program focuses on

the emergence of the Asian Ameri
can and Pacific Islander identity," an
identity which is both complex and
diverse.
The events, which are a collabora
tive effort of many Asian American
student organizations on campus, in
cluding the Stanford Hawaii Club,
the Stanford Asian American The
ater Project and Sanskriti, reflect this
diversity. The activities are all open
to the public and include a comedy
show, featuring comedians of various
ethnic backgrounds and a music and
dance performance celebrating
South Asian culture.
The activities for Asian Pacific
Heritage Month are structured simi
larly to years past; however, some is
sues are receiving increased empha
sis. Among these issues is sweatshop

awareness, which will be featured at
the AASA Fashion Show. Also, the
month's events include a film screen
ing on the sex trade associated with
the U.S. military bases in South
Korea.
Sophomore Nate Watanabe has
helped organize the "Asian Images"
event, an interactive guest speaker
program featuring Asian American
speakers involved in non-traditional
Asian fields. This year's speakers are
Robert Honda, an award-winning
reporter, and Pinay, a popular hip
hop group. Watanabe is "especially
excited for the program this year"
and hopes that the speakers are par
ticularly appealing to the student
body.
