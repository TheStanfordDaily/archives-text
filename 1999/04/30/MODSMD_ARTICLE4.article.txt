## Senators discuss childcare 
### Sarah Rapway Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate discussed
the creation of intra-departmental
review boards for tenured faculty
and the shortage of day care on the
Stanford campus at its meeting yes
terday.
The Policy Planning Board, a
committee of faculty members that
discusses long-range projects, pro
posed instituting formal intra-de
partmental reviews of tenured fac
ulty. Reviews would occur every
five to seven years and be conduct
ed by a departmental colleague or
chair.
The board intended such re
views to serve as a network of sup
port to help faculty members who
want to change the focus or direc
tion of their research. However,
senate members voiced strong ob
jections, fearing the rise of a regula
tory system that will stifle academic
freedom.
"I am concerned that it will nar
row intellectual perspectives," So
ciology Prof. Cecilia Ridgeway

said. "Faculty will have to pursue
things that will pay off in a certain
number of years. There can be
ideas and projects which have
longer time frames," she said.
Computer Science Prof. Eric
Roberts feared the addition of
more bureaucracy, especially in
larger departments.
"In the CS department we
would need to oversee six to seven
people a year," he said. "That takes
time away from counseling those
professors who actually need it."
Others did concede the difficul
ty of initiating conversations about
low productivity with "deadwood"
tenured faculty. The subject is par
ticularly sensitive when young de
partment chairs must approach se
nior faculty.
The senate moved to send the
report back to the Policy Planning
Board for further study.
Psychology Prof. Anne Fernald,
the vice provost for faculty devel
opment, spoke on the challenges
facing assistant professors. She said
that among the most pressing of
these issues is the rising cost and un
availability of day care.
Seventy of the more than 350
people on the waiting list for Stan
ford day care are faculty members.
In order to secure a spot, many
choose to register their unborn chil
dren and incur the cost of any un
necessary day care.
Stanford's lack of day care mir
rors a greater problem in Santa
Clara County. With an estimated
population growth of 11 percent,

there is a shortage of 19,(KX) spots in
the county.
The low pay of day care work ex
acerbates this problem. The high
turnover rate of day care workers,
second only to gas station employ
ees, also compounds the shortage.
"Our housing payment com
bined with child care is more than
my take-home salary," Asst. Span
ish and Portuguese Prof. Claire Fox
said.
All senate members agreed on
the urgency of this issue and its pos
sible negative effects on Stanford's
ability to recruit new faculty.
The senate has three more meet
ings scheduled this academic year.
