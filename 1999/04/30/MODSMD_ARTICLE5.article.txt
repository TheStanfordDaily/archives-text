# Vigil mourns Kosovo victims
## 
### Jamecca Marshall 
Students expressed concern and
distress over the conflict in Kosovo
last night during what organizers
dubbed an apolitical candlelight
vigil in White Plaza.
Vula and Haig Rushdoony and
Marcia and Ken Davis, American
missionaries, offered first-hand ac
counts of the conflict to about 40
students.
"There are wrongs on both sides
and good on both sides," Haig
Rushdoony said. "It's a horrible
thing."
The vigil, sponsored by the in
ternational student relief aid orga
nization Miles To Go. was billed as
an opportunity for students to learn
more about the conflict and to raise
consciousness about the suffering.

Hut, emphasized Miles to Go. it was
not a political event.
"We want people to understand
what's going on," said Jessica
Knape, a coterminal student in edu
cation and one of the organizers of
the event. "No political views. No
opinions."
The Rushdoonvs echoed her sen

timcnts. "We can give the pros and
cons of both sides, but we'd like to
stay away from that all together,"
Haig Rushdoony said. "I'd rather
not get involved in the politics of the
conflict."
"I think people on campus should
be more aware of the situation in
Kosovo," said Rijad Hasic, a coter
minal student in economics.
"It's hard to explain the situa
tion," agreed Haig Rushdoony. "It's
enough to say, it's very complex and

very sad."
The Rushdoonysand the Davises
will both soon travel to Greece and
Bulgaria to help with the relief ef
forts for refugees who are pouring
into those countries.
Ken Davis said so far they have
provided food, clothing and medica
tion for more than a million refugees
through their outreach program.
Miles To Go did its part by col
lecting donations of money, cloth
ing, vitamins, toys and non-prescrip

tion drugs such as Tylenol and
Advil.
The mood of the vigil was
solemn. "The U.S. government is
heavily involved and I don't see an
end," Hasic said. "We should defi
nitely try and empathize with the
people in Kosovo."
Haig Rushdoony concurred with
I fasic's fears. "It's a power struggle,"
he said. "And short of the interven
tion of God, I don't know how we'll
solve it."
