# Vigil mourns Kosovo victims
## 
### Jamecca Marshall 
Students expressed concern and
distress over the conflict in Kosovo
last night during what organizers
dubbed an apolitical candlelight
vigil in White Plaza.
Vula and Haig Rushdoony and
Marcia and Ken Davis, American
missionaries, offered first-hand ac
counts of the conflict to about 40
students.
"There are wrongs on both sides
and good on both sides," Haig
Rushdoony said. "It's a horrible
thing."
The vigil, sponsored by the in
ternational student relief aid orga
nization Miles To Go. was billed as
an opportunity for students to learn
more about the conflict and to raise
consciousness about the suffering.
