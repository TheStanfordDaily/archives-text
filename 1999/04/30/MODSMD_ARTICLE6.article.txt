# Women's Center prepares for new focus
## Center director must integrate institutionalism with activist history 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
With a new full-time director
ship beginning next September, the
Women's Center is undergoing
transitions. While planning for the
future, the staff is learning from its
past struggles in finding support
and recognition in the Stanford
community.
"An issue we've had to deal with
has been how to get the Women's
Center connected campus-wide, be
yond the students who run it," said
Fabienne McPhail. director of the
Women's Center.
Nanci Howe, assistant dean of
students and director of student ac
tivities, said today's center grew out
of a group inspired by the women's
liberation movement of the 19705.
The Stanford Women's Collective,
founded as a student-run support
and activist group in 1972, organized
self-defense classes and other pro
grams for women.
The University facilitated the
group's work by providing it with a
meeting space in the Toyon Eating
Clubs and, about 15 years ago, a

half-time graduate assistantship
funded by graduate stipends.
"The center was first run by vol
unteers. When the administration
hired that first staffer, it provided
some stability for the group," Howe
explained.
In 1991, the organization made a
second move to its present location,
the old Fire Truck House. Accord
ing to McPhail, the location had
mainly been used as a storage space
before the center moved in.
"We wanted to have the Women's
Center, like the ethnic centers, in the
heart of life on campus," Howe said.
"The new space was nicer, bigger and
more accessible."
A continuing sign of support for
the center came in 1991 when a
Graduate Women's Network Coor
dinator, funded by graduate student
special fees, joined the center. The
newly incorporated position en
sured that the center served both un
dergraduate and graduate students.
In 1996, however, the Women's
Center faced a funding crisis when
the collective's special fee was de

nied, largely as a result of changes in
ASSU voting regulations. Accord
ing to Nanci Howe, though 60 per
cent of graduate students voted in
favor of the collective, less than 15
percent actually voted, leading to a
denial of funding.
At that point, senior Cathy Rion
said, the group was left with "only a
graduate student tied to a stipend"
and a thousand dollars in University
funds.
Forty Stanford women respond
ed by decorating the campus with
colorful paths of fliers all leading to
the center. Each flier, however, was
removed before 10 a.m. the next
morning.
"Obviously, it was very deliberate,
since the fraternity fliers were still left
taped to the ground," Rion said.
Refusing to feel censored, the
women fliered a path to University
President Gerhard Casper's office
door and approached him at a
town-hall style "Tea and Cookies"
talk, demanding support for the
center. Casper responded with a re
quest for a proposal and a promise
of consideration.
Citing various studies indicating a
greater need for women's resources

at Stanford, the student written pro
posal made 14 recommendations,
including a that for a full-time direc
tor.
"We found out right at the end of
that year that they were going to give
us a lot of what we asked for. I was
surprised," Rion said. "They gave us
interns, a half-time director and pro
gram money — enough to make the
center a center."
The first year, a graduate student
filled the director role and McPhail
was hired for the following two
years. According to Rion, however,
McPhail's capabilities were
stretched as she had to perform full
time duties in a half-time position.
The Dean of Students Office
eventually responded by granting
both the Women's Center and the
Lesbian. Gay and Bisexual Comm
munity Center full-time directors in
response to protests following half
time LGBCC Director Gwendolyn
Dean's resignation late in 1998.
The recognition of the center's
need for leadership has opened up
possibilities for the future but also
changed the center's tone.
"It's professionalized the center a
lot. which is good because it gives
[the center] legitimacy and there's
been a huge increase in program
ming," Rion explained. "But in
some ways, it's had a detrimental ef

feet on the community itself. You
don't have the activism you get from
having to fight so hard for the bare
basics."
McPhail sees advantages in the
center's "institutionalization."
"We're not just a small group of

women representing a narrow view
point." McPhail said.
McPhail looks to the center's fu
ture as a community that represents
the voices of all Stanford women,
"even the voices of dissension," she
said.
