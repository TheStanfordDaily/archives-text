With a new full-time director
ship beginning next September, the
Women's Center is undergoing
transitions. While planning for the
future, the staff is learning from its
past struggles in finding support

"We wanted to have the Women's
Center, like the ethnic centers, in the

A continuing sign of support for
the center came in 1991 when a
