### Joshua Fried 
Two Stanford students will
spend their summer in South Africa
as recipients of the 1999 Amy Biehl
Summer Fellowship.
Junior Kate Bedford and sopho
more Brian Cook were selected to
spend a minimum of eight weeks as
volunteers working to improve so
cial and economic conditions in
Capetown, South Africa. Biehl Fel
lows receive funding for housing
and travel and take on various vol
unteer projects depending on their
coursework and interests.
The fellowship was established
to honor Amy Biehl and her work.
Biehl graduated from Stanford in
19.X9 and as a Fulbright Fellow was
interested in studying the role of
women in shaping the South
African transition to democracy. In
1993 she was killed by three black
militants in the South African town
ship where she was helping with
voter education leading up to the
nation's first all-race election.
Sue Gray, the Haas Center fel
lowship program coordinator, said
she interviewed six applicants and

selected three finalists before finally
choosing Bedford and Cook.
"We're looking for people that
will take initiative and be self
starters," she said.
Gray stressed Biehl Fellows'
contributions to anti-violence work
and economic redevelopment. Cur
rent volunteers' projects include
providing fresh bread to residents of
impoverished neighborhoods and
assisting community agencies that
serve victims of domestic violence.
"They are doing incredible work in
South Africa," Gray said.
Bedford, a feminist studies major
who currently directs the Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center, said
she is looking forward to "the op
portunity to learn more about pub
lic service."
"I want to do a lot of different
things there and see which ones fit
me best," she said.
Cook, who along with Bedford
enrolled in a sophomore seminar
last year about the political strug
gles in South Africa, is majoring in
political science and history.
One of last year's fellows, senior
Katie Deal, remembers fondly her
time in Capetown.
"I was frustrated that I had to
leave, but I'll go back every couple
of years," she said. Deal cited the
"importance of learning humility"
and also said that she garnered ex
tensive knowledge of the area and
its many different people.
In its second year of existence, the
Amy Biehl Summer Fellowship is
sponsored by Amy's parents, Linda
and Peter Biehl, who have made the
fellowship their life's work.
"They really are remarkable
people," Suzanne Abel, director of
development and external relations
for the Haas Center, said of the
Biehls.
"Motivated by personal values,
they've taken it upon themselves to
dedicate their lives to the work
Amy was doing," she said.
