# Redone Draw Guide earns mixed reviews
## 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
The ASSU's second online draw guide
has been reorganized and improved in re
sponse to student feedback since the pilot
version was posted last year. The current
guide includes room sizes and types, cut-off
statistics and sections on the atmosphere and
food quality of all the residences in the
Draw.
ASSU President-elect Mike Levin over
saw this year's attempt to gather more infor
mation on all of the residences. Last vear's

guide had little or no information on several
residences, including some Row houses and
Florence Moore houses.
"We looked at what we had on line [from
last year]. "We still felt that it was a very, very
helpful resource for students," sophomore
Levin said, who served as deputy ASSU sen
ate chair this year.
However, both Levin and senior Rita
Leung, the ASSU senator who originally
proposed the idea for an ASSU draw guide
last year, said there was room for improve-

ment.
Last year the ASSII distributed
its survey to collect information
from students on the small details
of dorm life, like food, shower
availability and lighting quality,
immediately following the annual
housing survey put out by the Of
fice ol Residential Education. Con
sequently, the response rate was
not as high as desired.
To address the problem of low re
sponse rates. Levin said this year the
ASSIJ waited until some time after
the Res Ed surveys had been collect
ed before handing out its surveys.
"We kept a lot of the quantita
tive information, such as room
sizes," Levin said, "but we redid all
of the survey information. We had
a pretty decent turnout, around 500
responses. We wound up having in
formation for every single house
that's in the draw this year."
While a delayed distribution of
the surveys may have increased re
sponse rates, at least one student
was irritated by the relatively late
posting of the draw guide.
"My complaint is that [the draw
guide] was supposed to be up on
April 1. but it wasn't up even 20
days after. It was mildly helpful,
but by the time it came out I'd al
ready visited the places I was inter
ested in and talked to the people

there," freshman Forrest Fleis
chman said.
Levin explained that he and his
assistants visited and evaluated
houses that had few survey re
sponses. They also talked to friends
who were current residents to find
out more specific and accurate de
tails about life in those houses.
Junior Marissa Treinen differed
with some of the guide's assess
ments of housing quality.
"A lot of the places that I had
lived in and thought were really
crappy actually got good scores. So
I don't know where they got their
numbers," Treinen said.
Other students did not use the
draw guide's ratings, instead
choosing to focus on other aspects
they found more beneficial.
"I didn't really look at the rat
ings," freshman Kenny Easwaran
said. "The comments were the
most helpful part. For the some
what more obscure places like Mir
rielees, I could get comments even
though I don't know anyone who
lives there."
Sophomore Jessica Chow said
she found the cut-off numbers use
ful. They "gave me an idea of
where I could get in unpreferred,"
she said.
"I've gotten pretty positive
feedback so far. Probably 20 or 30
people have e-mailed me." Levin
said, although he was "confident
that we'll find someone to do it bet
ter next year than I did it this year."
