HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AIM — The toll from the
sinking of a tourist excursion boat rose to 13 yesterday
when a woman died in a hospital and divers returned to
a lake and found her husband. I heir daughter also was
among the victims.
The amphibious vehicle of World War II vintage
called a "duck" because it travels both on land and
water — sank rapidly shortly after entering Lake
Hamilton on Saturday while passengers panicked as
they scrambled for life preservers.
"I understand one man tried to pass out life jackets,
but there was no time." Garland County Sheriff Larry
Selig said yesterday.
T he passengers had to gel out through a gap
between the sides of the boat's hull and a canvas
canopy, and their efforts to put on life jackets which
they were not required by law to be wearing may
have contributed to the problem, he said.
"When trying to get out of a small hole, a life jacket
... may have made it worse." Selig said.
The victims included five children, Selig said, a 13-
year-old. one 14-vear-old. and three children under the
age of 5.

Victims' identities were not released, but Selig said
they came from Tennessee, Louisiana, California and
Arkansas.
Divers had been sent home Saturday evening, their
work apparently complete, but then authorities learned
that one passenger was still unaccounted for when a 16-
year-old boy viewed the victims' bodies and said he
didn't see his father. Selig said.
The man's body was found yesterday morning about
two hours after his wife died at St. Joseph's Regional
Health Center, Selig said. Their daughter, age
unknown, was among the victims, he said.
The duck, the Miss Majestic, sank shortly before
noon Saturday in 51 feet of water, about 3(X) feet from
the shore of Lake Hamilton on the city's south side.
Twenty-one people were on board, including the driver.
Hie passengers had been picked up by the vehicle in
downtown Hot Springs and driven about five miles
through the city to the lake.
Authorities had no idea yet why the boat took on
water. Bowen said. However, witnesses said strong
wind had kicked up waves on the lake, lined by hotels,
restaurants and homes.
