All-nighter for "Star Wars" fans
NEW YORK (AP) — The Force is with "Star
Wars" fans, and it's telling them to hit the toy
stores early and spend, spend, spend.
The most-hyped line of movie-themed merchan
dise in history — for the still unreleased "Star
Wars: Episode I —The Phantom Menace" —is
finally going on sale on a studio-imposed schedule,
and fans and retailers aren't wasting a minute.
In an unprecedented move. Toys R Us stores
around the country decided to open their doors at
12:01 a.m. today for an all-night selling marathon of
toys based on the movie. Some FAO Schwartz
stores planned to open from midnight to 2 a.m.
Wal-Mart and Kmart called in extra staff for
their 24-hour stores to handle the post-midnight
crowds. Many stores planned to limit the number of
items a customer could buy to prevent immediate
sell-outs.
By 3 p.m. PS I . some fans were already lining up
to get first dibs on the new merchandise.
"We've been getting lots of phone calls and
there are already people out there," said Randy
Perkins, a manager at the Wal-Mart store in Rome.
N.Y. "We expect this to be a busy night."
Even the virtual stores were ready for middle
of-the-night surfers with an itch to buy. Internet
merchants Amazon.com and eTovs planned to
r ii theii online "Star Wars" stores just after mid
night.
