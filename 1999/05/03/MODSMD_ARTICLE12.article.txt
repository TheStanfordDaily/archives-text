LONDON (AP) —Police
charged a white man with murder
yesterday in a nail-bombing cam
paign against gays and ethnic
minorities that killed three people
and wounded more than 1(X). He
operated alone and was not linked
to neo-Nazi groups that claimed
responsibility, authorities said.
David Copeland, a 22-year-old
engineer, was captured on closed
circuit TV in the neighborhood
where the first blast occurred April
17, police said. He was arrested
early Saturday at his home in Cove,
southwest of London, where police
seized explosive material.

Copeland has been charged with
the deaths of three people in the
worst explosion — a nail-bombing
Friday at a gay pub in central Lon
don — and with similar attacks
April 17 and April 24 in London dis
tricts with large ethnic minorities. A
total of 115 people were wounded.
He will appear in court today.
Metropolitan Police Deputy Com
missioner Alan Fry said.
The announcement that one man
was responsible for the campaign
meant claims of responsibility by
shadowy neo-Nazi groups Combat
18 and the White Wolves were
apparently hoaxes to gain publicity

and instill fear across the country.
Fifteen of the more than 70 peo
ple injured in Friday's explosion
remained hospitalized, including
eight in critical condition. Some vic
tims had limbs amputated and oth
ers suffered severe burns.
The first bomb exploded more
than two weeks ago, wounding 39
people at a teeming street market in
Brixton, a south London district
with a large Afro-Carribbean popu
lation. A week later a second explo
sion went off in Brick Lane, wound
ing seven in the east London district,
which is home to many
Bangladeshis.
