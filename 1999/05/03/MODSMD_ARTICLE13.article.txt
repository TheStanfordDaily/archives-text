# Lost space capsule discovered

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) —Lost at sea for
38 years, astronaut Gus Grissom's Mercury capsule was
found over the weekend by an underwater salvage team
that had been searching for the spacecraft for nearly two
weeks.
Liberty Bell 7 is still 3 miles beneath the Atlantic's
surface and about 300 miles offshore. The cable to a
remote-operated rover that had been used to identify
and photograph the capsule snapped in the rough sea
Saturday night. Salvagers are returning to Port Canaver
al and will have to wait for another few weeks or even
longer before going back to recover the spacecraft.
Hut at least they know now where it is and they're
thrilled about Saturday's discovery.
The only U.S. spacecraft ever lost following a success
ful mission, it's still shiny in spots with an intact window
and the name "Liberty Bell" clearly visible. Even the
fake crack that was painted on the exterior, to replicate
the real Liberty Bell, is still visible, as are the singe marks
left by the explosives that blew out the hatch following
splashdown on July 21, 1961.
"It looks to be in beautiful condition and certainly
capable of being recovered," said Curt Newport, leader
of the expedition.
Liberty Bell 7 sank to the bottom of the ocean fol
lowing Grissom's successful 15-minute suborbital flight.
The explosive bolts that blow open the hatch detonated
prematurely, and helicopter rescuers were unable to lift
the waterlogged spacecraft from the sea.
Grissom nearly drowned, but was pulled to safety. He
insisted until his death in the Apollo launch pad fire in
1967 that he'd done nothing wrong, although some ques
tioned at the time — and still do — whether he bumped
something or even panicked.
Grissom's widow. Betty, said last month that she
hoped her husband's capsule would remain buried in the
Atlantic. She resents not being consulted from the start
about the salvage effort and does not want the spacecraft

being restored by the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space
Center, as is the plan.
Newport's expedition had uncovered 88 possible tar
gets in the 24-square-mile area that he pinpointed prior
to setting sail on April 19.
The team encountered trouble with the sonar during
the first several days, but finally got it working.
The first target they looked at with the rover, on Sat
urday. ended up being the 7-foot titanium and aluminum
capsule.
Newport said the team followed a trail of the capsule's
corroded heat shield up a hill. That led them to the cap
sule. propped upright on the ocean floor. It emerged out
of the gloom as a dark shape; Newport thought at first it
was airplane wreckage.
"I remember saying, 'Oh. my God, I can't believe it.
That's it. We found it. This is it.' " Newport said bv phone
yesterday from sea. "There was a lot of shaking hands
and slapping each other on the back and just congratu
lating each other and just staring in disbelief at this space
craft in front of us. us being the first to see it since 1961."
Newport. 47. had made two previous attempts to find
the capsule. The former space station worker did not
have sophisticated enough equipment or enough time on
his first two tries in 1992 and 1993.
"This was really a difficult thing to find." he said. "If
you could see what the terrain is like down there, you
could understand this capsule, had it fallen somewhere
else, could easily have been obscured from the sonar and
we may not have seen it at all."
"You have to understand," he continued, "what we
did was find something in water half a mile deeper than
the Titanic and it's smaller than one of the Titanic's boil
ers."
Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the
capsule could shed light on why the hatch blew too soon,
although it's doubtful the film could be salvaged after so
long underwater.
