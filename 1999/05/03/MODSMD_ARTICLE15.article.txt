New Draw Guide is
significantly better
than last year's version

THE 1999 ASSIJ Draw Guide
should provide a valuable refer
ence to undergraduates who
are uncertain about their housing
choices for next year. This year's guide
is a comprehensive reference of the
housing options on campus, with
detailed information on various
aspects of life in every residence in the
upperclass Draw.
The guide is dramatically improved
over last year's version in several
regards. Most glaringly, last year's
publication provided incomplete or
no information for many residences.
Hi is has been remedied, and students
viewing this year's guide can trust that
they have a source of information
which is both accurate and complete.
Every residence open to the Draw is
included, with information available
in all categories of housing.
The guide mixes factual informa
tion such as year of renovation, costs
and room configurations with com
ments on more subjective matters like
food and atmosphere, providing a
strong characterization of every resi
dence.
Student feedback is given in the
form of numerical ratings of facilities,
summarized statements on atmo
sphere and food and specific quotes
from residents.
I he attention to resident feedback
is the core of what makes this year's
guide valuable. Efforts made by the
ASSIJ to boost survey response rates
were clearly fruitful, and information
is available for even smaller resi
dences on satisfaction with food, room
size, location and other aspects of life.
Hie inclusion of many student com
ments provides a perspective on the
residences that the numerical

response data cannot capture com
pletely. ITie comments help viewers
understand a residence not only by
evaluating different aspects of life but
by indicating which aspects were
important enough to residents to com
ment on. In many residences, food was
the issue most often remarked on; in
others, common spaces or community
atmosphere received more attention.
The attention taken to including both
positive and negative remarks also
helps provide a more complete picture
of the residence.
This year's guide is a definite suc
cess, and we applaud the ASSU for
the effort that went into enhancing last
year's prototype. However, some
enhancements to the guide may still
be possible.
Il would be useful if next year's
guide includes links to information
from this year, in order to provide a
sense of how issues like resident satis
faction with the residence community
varied from year to year and, there
fore, how meaningful the current
year's results are likely to be. Since
cutoff numbers are highly variable,
several years' worth of data would
also give students a better sense of
their chances of drawing into a partic
ular residence.
Another helpful feature would be
the survey response rate for a resi
dence— this would allow students
using the guide to sense how strong a
sampling of resident opinion they are
viewing and attach significance to sur
vey results for different residences
accordingly.
Regardless of whether or not the
ASSIJ is able to implement such sug
gestions for next year, they have clear
ly produced a winning product that we
hope will be available during the
Draw process for many years to come.
Students currently entering the Draw
can find a valuable resource in the
guide and should not hesitate to con
sult it.
