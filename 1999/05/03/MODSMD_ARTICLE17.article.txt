## Risking self-disclosure 
### 
Mari Webel

I HAD AN interesting
revelation in a history
section at the end of
last week. In discussing
the "double conscious
ness" of minorities in
America posited by
W.E.B. Dußois. my teach-

ing assistant launched into a story of her
childhood in Texas, taking us into a child's
experience of racial difference. She had
known the "twoness" of a visible and
unbroaehable difference in identity, exter
nal perception conflicting with internal
sense of self.
More interesting than the actual storv
was the reaction of the class. Wc looked at
our hands, Hipped through our books and
smiled awkwardly, worrying that we might
be expected to share, cringing a bit when
she looked at us expectantly. Capable of
speaking coherently about abstractions of
American racial dilemmas, we were stuck
when it became apparent that these abstract
themes might be likened to our own lives.
We self-effacingly think that nothing so
serious could have really touched us, or if
so, it's not worth telling or hearing.
In part, the tangible reluctance may have
been the result of an actual lack of experi
ence in difference and rejection. It's also a
little embarrassing to hear someone's story
unsolicited — we remain strangers to most
of our peers in spite of the connections that
could make our lives whole. I'd like to
think, though, that our reluctance was less a
result of our homogenous makeup or of
rejection than of a fear of disclosure.
Such fear is what compels us to tell anec

dotes rather than stories, to keep our inter
actions brief amidst the ever-quickening
pace of a sound-bite society. Implicit is a
fear of rejection, indifference — in short,
looking stupid in front of multiple people,
not being entertaining or coherent.
It is a well-founded fear. Humans are
cruel beasts, sometimes unintentionally,
and the deviation in levels of understanding
from one person to the next are enough to
dizzy the most apt psychologist. We do not
always make sense to each other, and there
are times when we come to the most frus
trating, painful and apparently most
unavoidable collision of minds and emo
tions conceivable.
We gel gun-shy, either from the behavior
of a particularly abrasive professor (when a
simple "no" would suffice), the razor wit of
an unaware housemate or the polite indif
ference of the person you've given your
heart to. And so, understandably, we
remain veiled from the relative lack of gen
uineness that being afraid in such a way
leaves in our wake. Better to stay out of the
water than end up freezing cold. Eyes
closed to potential connections, we fumble
through our days ... but to what end?
If we were all Care Bears and loved each
other to oblivion and had no need for sar
casm, we'd probably be disclosing all over
the place, and our interactions would be
candv-coated and sweetly sickening. Yuck.
II we were all edgy and relied on bril
liantly biting sarcasm as the lone vehicle for
our wit and ingenuity, we'd end up vacating
campus in a mass exodus for the East Coast
where we could wear lots of black and drink
coffee and veil at taxicabs. Double vuck.

We cannot satisfy the human desire for
challenge, argument, compassion, authen
ticity, by becoming pastel stuffed animals or
New Yorkers. We likewise cannot learn to
appreciate genuine sincerity by telling our
comrades in a steady unrepentant stream
everything from the play-by-play of senior
prom to how we learned to ride a bike or
how often we have sex. An increase in
information alone will do us no good. But to
increase the opening in the old creaky door
which stands at the entrance to our minds,
with potential to be so open — to let some
more light in — could give us the chance to
grow.
But we also can't expect to be perpetual
ly deep. Sometimes you just need the
breeziness and melodrama of a soap opera
in your life. And it's not that being either
totally lovey or sarcastic are necessarily bad.
It's just when those two ways of carrying
oneself through a conversation become so
overpowering as to prevent any other ele
ment of emotionality from breaching the
gap between people, something is lost. We
stop hearing each other.
Hopefully we remain real to a few
friends and acquaintances, family members,
people whose history with or commitment
to us does not allow for a casual complacen
cy. It's a dilemma, how much to give, how to
dispense with the fear and doubt which
keep us distant, how not to be annoying.
Stay grounded, keep your ego in check? Or
let go, lose yourself in living? Infinite possi
bility relies upon some disclosure. Speak.
Someone will hear you.
