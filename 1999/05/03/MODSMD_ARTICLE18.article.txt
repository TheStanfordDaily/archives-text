Staying true to the April Third Movement

The April Third Movement was a life
changing experience lor hundreds of Stan
lord students in the l%()s and 19705. Sent to
Stanford by our parents, who anticipated
we would receive a top-notch liberal arts
education, we found ourselves transforming
the very world we were studying. As we
read about the war in Southeast Asia, we
came to understand the role of the United
States, and of Stanford University, in con
ducting and perpetuating that war.
We saw films of the Vietnamese people,
living and working and educating their chil
dren underground, to avoid the bombs
being dropped by the United States. We
saw the destruction of their small country,
as the bombs devastated the crops and the
countryside and the people. We saw women
and children running, horrified, from U.S.
planes loaded with deadly napalm.
Our reactions to what we saw and read
were colored by our knowledge that Stan

lord University was complicit in this war on
the people of Southeast Asia. We learned
that research to develop chemical and bio
logical warfare, as well as counter-insurgency
techniques, was being conducted at Stanford.
The war was being fought in our own back
yard. And we felt personally responsible.
We spent many hours and days and
weeks and months studying, discussing and
taking actions to end the war. No action was
taken without lengthy study and debate as
we tried to implement "participatory
democracy." Hundreds of students sat in
buildings, occupied the Stanford Industrial
Park and defended themselves against tear
gas when the police reacted to our civil dis
obedience. We risked our futures as many
of us were arrested or disciplined by the
Stanford power structure.
Our political awakening was inextricably
bound up with our personal development.
We found ourselves in the midst of a cultur

al revolution as we questioned authority,
elevated love over destruction and under
went profound transformation in our
lifestyles. We strove for equality
between races, between sexes and between
classes. We studied together, we worked
together and we lived together. Our values
were reflected in the music we loved, per
formed by the poets of our time—Bob
Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Simon and
Garfunkel, Nina Siinone, Jefferson Air
plane, The Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
Ultimately, we were successful. Our
efforts contributed to ending the war. But it
didn't stop there. Many of our lives have
been guided by the values we internalized
during our days in the April Third Move
ment (named for the date on which our 11-
day occupation of the Applied Electronics
Laboratory began). We have continued to
do productive work as community organiz
ers, educators, attorneys, journalists, farm

es, poets, politicians and scholars (to name
a few). And we delight in the activism of the
current Stanford students as you try to
make the world a better place, by support
ing workers, minorities, gays and lesbians
and environmentalists in their struggles for
justice.
The University must be a laboratory for
both theory and practice.
It is here we have the opportunity to
study; but is is here we also have the respon
sibility to use our knowledge to change our
selves and, in turn, our community.
This weekend we looked back at the '60s
and 70s as well as ahead to the next centu
ry. Let us work together to make the world
a more humane place for all.
