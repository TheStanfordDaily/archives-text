### Abhishek Bajoria Contributing writer 
Jose Ramos-Horta, the 1996
Nobel Peace Prize winner, appealed
to Western countries to stop selling
weapons to dictators in a speech at
Cubberlv Auditorium on Friday.
Ramos-Horta received the prize
for his work toward liberating East
Timor from Indonesian occupation
through non-violent resistance
against the government. Because of
his actions, he is currently living in
exile in Australia.
He urged Western countries to
realize the "immorality of their
weapons exports" and asked them
to make the world a better place in

the next century by "fighting against
dictatorship everywhere — not only
in Kosovo and not only in Iraq."
I le said he is "not asking to bomb
Indonesia to the Stone Age," but to
stop all economic and weapons as
sistance to Indonesia. He ques
tioned how the World Bank and
IMF could continue lending money
to Indonesia, when the country is
spending $1 million a day to fund its
actions in East Timor.
East Timor, a small island 4(H)
miles off the coast of Australia, has
been under Indonesian control since
1975. According to Ramos-Horta,
the "green light was given by [Presi

dent Ford] to invade East Timor."
That green light, he said, has led
to numerous atrocities by the In
donesian army and militia in East
Timor, causing the death of more
than 2(N),(XM) East Timorese during
the first three years of Indonesian
rule.
The Indonesians are supposedly
in East Timor to liberate its people
from Portuguese colonial rule, but
the Portuguese had left already
when the Indonesians arrived,
Ramos-Horta said. The violence,
which has been going on for 23
years, continues even now "as In
donesia pretends to go on a charade
of democratic reform."
Ramos-Horta's non-violent plan
is to assemble lawyers from all over
the world to "compile evidence to
mount a case against Indonesia ac
cusing them of genocide." He said
the "arm of justice is long" and that
it might take five, 10 or even 20
years but he will obtain justice for
the thousands of his countrymen
who have been murdered.
He said that "a non-violent ap
proach can be more effective for the
long run,"and instead of weapons,
he is using lawyers to "hit them

where it will hurt: economically."
The vitality of East Timorese in
dependence rests on economics, he
said. He said that Singapore, a coun
try smaller than East Timor, was not
vital 30 years ago, but it is today a
mini economic superpower.
He said the "greatest resource of
a country is its people" and that "no
amount of force or terror will win
over the heart and mind of' the East
Timorese.
Ramos-Horta blamed the Amer
ican media, especially the Associat
ed Press, for American misconcep
tions about the situation in East
Timor. He related an incident
where innocent civilians were mur
dered outside a church by the In
donesian army, which the American
media labeled as "conflicts between
rival factions in East Timor."
He said the Australian and Euro
pean media get it right, just not the
Americans.
Despite this, he said that West
ern help is inevitable. "It is difficult
for them to not begin economic
sanctions," he said, because "as they
bomb Serbia, East Timor haunts
them."
Ramos-Horta was invited to
speak at Stanford by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, Amnesty In
ternational and Stanford in Govern
ment.
