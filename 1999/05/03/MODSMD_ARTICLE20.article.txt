# Where we are
## Stanford students can hold their liquor

BEFORE WE ADDRESS the very,
very serious and very, very terrifying
problem of alcohol abuse at Stanford,
let s turn our attention to my friend, Pookie.
Pookie is not his real name, nor is he
exactly my friend. He is a guy 1 met at work
last summer who brightened the dull parts of
our days with his special brand of unintend
ed humor. To get a good sense of Pookie,
let's say that after lie saw "Saving Private
Ryan," he said the most striking part of the
visceral war epic was the two "really hot"
teen-age girls walking alongside their veteran
grandfather at the beginning of the film. The
tunny part — he was serious.
Pookie attends a small college on the East
Coast, which, for various legal reasons, also
needs to remain unnamed. Not that Pookie
or any of his fraternity brothers are criminals,
per se, although their actions sometimes tot
ter on the border of legality and always leap
over the boundaries of sobriety.
At his university, strict measures have
been taken to ensure that alcohol is con
sumed in a safe but enjoyable manner. In
accordance with state law, alcohol can't be
purchased after <S p.m.. and at campus par

ties, two ID's are required for admittance
and hosts are not allowed to have kegs.
However, Pookie's Greek community has
cleverly gotten around this last restriction.
Instead of kegs, they buy cases of canned
beer that they keep in ceiling-high piles in
their basement. To get one of these beers,
party-goers must squeeze into the cramped
basement and wait until someone — I am
not making this up — hurls a can at high
velocity somewhere in their direction, often
first ricocheting off a number of people's
heads. This sort of rousing atmosphere can
produce delightful conversations:
Tom: Hey Mike! How 'bout a beer?
Mike: (Clunk.)
According to Pookie, this environment
doesn't always lead to problems. But some
times it does. A year ago, some beer-induced
students mistook a police car for a thirsty
freshman and began pelting it with bottles.
Realizing that the bottles were doing little
damage, the students decided to turn the car
on its side, which prompted the police officer
to call for backup. Luckily, after a few hours
and the arrival of the National Guard, peace
was restored.

A few years before that excitement,
Pookie said that a member of a neighboring
fraternity, who had polished off a good quan
tity of vodka, set fire to a carpet. His friends,
sensing the danger, tried to extinguish the
fire with beer, and after this move somehow
proved futile, proceeded to urinate on the
flames. Luckily, after a few hours, that frater
nity no longer had a house.
Pookie said that drinking less than four
times per week is considered strange at his
school and that few people can have fun
without the aid of alcohol. Moreover, he said
his friends knew all about the health risks
and dangerous behavior associated with
drinking and chose to do so anyway.
In light of Pookie's situation, it seems dif
ficult to condemn Stanford's drinking culture
as dangerous, even with the recent hospital
ization of a prospective freshman for alcohol
poisoning. Granted, alcohol should not be
the source of all fun, as it sometimes is on this
campus, nor should such incidents as the
prospective freshman mishap or the accident
at Phi Delt earlier this year be overlooked.
However, isolated incidents do not automat
ically signal a culture gone bad — a culture

that takes into account the most prized com
modity at Stanford: freedom.
No one can deny that the prospective
freshman or Phi Delt incidents were the
product of poor judgment. In the latter case,
a drunken individual underestimated his
abilities while in the former, a minor, who
was thrust into a new and perhaps foreign
environment, was given the opportunity to
do things she shouldn't have done. However,
do these two mistakes call for an overhaul of
the alcohol education programs at Stanford,
a move that some have proposed?
Before answering that question, it's neces
sary to examine what prompts alcohol-relat
ed incidents. As Pookie explained, it's not a
lack of education about alcohol that causes
problems but one's attitude toward drinking
in the first place. Accumulating knowledge
about liver disease, drunk driving and social
drinking will not prevent someone from get
ting drunk on Friday nights; changing the
campus atmosphere will.
And although no one wants more harmful
alcohol-related accidents to occur, I'd ven
ture that no one wants the campus atmo
sphere to change that much either. For all

our barking at administrators, they provide
us with an abnormal amount of freedom
when it comes to drinking. Resident assis
tants are not taught to be persecutors, parties
are on the whole safe and, heck, dorm funds
can be used to purchase alcohol. When it
comes to drinking, we get respect.
With this freedom, students on this cam
pus do not abuse their liberties, wreaking
mayhem and endangering their friends and
peers. And although generalizations are
often unhelpful, the alcohol culture on this
campus seems to be not destructive but
responsible. Supportive communities exist
here, communities that know that drinking is
not a way to grow up, but a product of grow
ing up.
For those who want more alcohol-related
education, there are plenty of campuses, like
Pookie's, where they need your help. As for
Stanford, we seem to be able to handle our
liquor.
