### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
Entering to the sounds of African drums,
Shekhem Ur Shekhem Ra Un Nefer Amen I, a
king of the Agogo region of Ghana, spoke Fri
day in Tresidder Union on African spirituality
and the need for people of African descent all
over the world to work together.
Nation-state boundaries are less important in
the modern world, with global communications
and trade, he said.
Amen himself is an example of this. Though
he was born in 1944 in Panama and currently
lives in New York City, he inherited his position
as co-ruler of his ancestral home in the Agogo
region of Ghana.
He is part of what he described as a "govern
ment within a government," with regional tribal
kings working with an elected government to
rule Ghana.

While his fellow co-ruler resides in Ghana,
Amen travels as a "goodwill, cultural and busi
ness ambassador" to "bring a lot of resources
back to Africa" in the form of investment and
donations of books and clothing. For example,
he works with the 500,000 African Americans of
Ghanian descent that live in the United States,
he said. He also serves as a liaison to other
African governments.
In his speech. Amen urged "Africans in the
Diaspora" to coordinate their efforts through
African spirituality in order to help themselves.
He noted that Jews in the Diaspora remained
a strong nation while they were denied access to
power or privilege, because their isolation
pushed them to work together.
By contrast, he said, African Americans have
a massive gross national product if measured as
a separate nation but haven't managed it effec
tively.
"You have already overcome — vou need to

change the anthem," he said in reference to
African Americans. They need to use that eco
nomic power to uplift themselves, he said.
But at the same time, he said, " The solution
to our problem is through spirituality, whether
you believe in God or not."
He noted that many of his people and other
Africans are working to preserve and revive
African spiritual traditions.
Living in fear of other people stealing your
money "chokes off the life force within you
Money never saved anybody."
"You don't know why you're here ... you
don't know what is truth or how to approach
truth,"he said. "Life doesn't follow a logical
path; there's more to it than that. I hat's the
African perspective."
"God's spirit flows into everything," he said.

dent Union and the Stanford African Students'
