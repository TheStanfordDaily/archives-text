# Study: Gratuituous substance abuse in movies
## 
### Jad Fakhry Contributing writer 
The use of drugs, alcohol and to
bacco in movies is portrayed gratu
itously and without consequence,
according to a recent study by
Communication Prof. Donald
Roberts.
The study focused on the 200
most popular movie rentals and the
I,(XX) most popular songs of 1996
and 1997.
It found that 98 percent of films
and 27 percent of music videos por
trayed drug, alcohol or tobacco
use. Roberts explained in the study
that drug use was less prevalent
than tobacco and alcohol.
Findings report the use of alco
hol and tobacco is gratuitous, al
most a scene filler in movies. The
study also discovered that the con
sequences of substance abuse are
almost universally absent in
movies.

Roberts explained the most
shocking finding was the magni
tude of alcohol and tobacco use. He
told Stanford Report that "This is a
world where alcohol and tobacco is
similar to the air we breathe. It all
around us all the time."
The study was released Wednes
day by the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy and
the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services' Substance Abuse
and Mental Services Administra
tion.
Retired Gen. Barry R. McCaf
frey, head of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, said in a state
ment that "these findings under
score the potential for the enter
tainment industry to play a key role
in protecting our kids from the dan
gers of drugs through realistic de
piction — portraying illicit drug
use, and all substance abuse, as
unglamorous, unacceptable and so
cially unacceptable."

Communication Prof. Henry
Breitrose argued that movies are
reflecting popular culture, not cre
ating it.
"My first impression is that the
film industry is catering to public
demand," Breitrose said, "because
that's what commercial companies
do in order to maximize return on
investment. My second impression
is that mass media seldom change
attitudes or behaviors on their own
but mostly reinforce people's pre
existing proclivities."
The National Youth Anti-Drug
Media Campaign reported a quick
response to the findings of the
study.
According to the group's Web
site, "The study release was accom
panied by wide agreement among
substance abuse prevention lead
ers that the findings should send a
strong signal to all parents of teens
and pre-teens, who are heavy con
sumers of popular movies and

music, to help their children be
alert and informed viewers."
While the study did not find that
movies caused children to drink,
smoke or use illicit drugs, sub
stance abuse was often linked with
a wealthy lifestyle or a humorous
context, or was portrayed as incon
sequential.
The study also found a disturb
ing trend about black characters in
movies. While black characters
represent a small percentage of
total movie characters, their rate of
illicit drug use is disproportionately
high.
Breitrose disagreed with the no
tion that songs and movies cause
substance abuse by themselves.
"Peer influence, role models at
home and other inter-personal in
fluences probably take care of that.
But we know that the media are
powerful forces in legitimizing and
reinforcing behavior of all kinds."
