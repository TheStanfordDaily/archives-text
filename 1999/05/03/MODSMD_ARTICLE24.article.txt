# First! Card grabs Pac-10 lead
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
It was the quintessential tale of
two cities.
It was the worst of times in Los
Angeles, where the USC Trojans
were dropping two critical home
games to Pacific 10 Conference rival
UCLA this weekend.
Needless to say, it was the best of
times here in Palo Alto as the sixth
ranked Cardinal baseball team
swept the hapless Oregon State
Beavers (15-33, 3-15 Pac-10) in a
three-game series.

As a result, Stanford (33-12,17-4)
has opened up a two-game lead on
the No. 17 Trojans (30-22, 15-6) in
the conference race with only three
league games remaining for both
teams.
"It's huge," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "A two
game lead with three to go — I like
that."
The weekend had a dramatic cul
mination as Stanford was forced to
rally twice Sunday to complete the

sweep and run its all-time record
against the Beavers to 10-0. After
putting together a two-out, four-run
rally in the seventh to forge a 6-6
deadlock, the Beavers responded
with a two-run home run by desig
nated hitter Curtis Davis to go back
on top. N-6.
Entering the bottom of the ninth.
Stanford still found itself down by

the same margin. It was about then
that a final score filtered up from
Los Angeles and was announced
over the public address system.
The Trojans had fallen. 8-5.
"We didn't say much." said se
nior third baseman Josh Hochge
sang. referring to the mood on the
bench heading into the bottom of
the ninth. "We knew we were defi

nitely capable of rallying. Two runs
is just a couple of hits away, and
that's just exactly what it took."
Indeed, the rally was swift with an
edgy conclusion. Junior second
baseman Jeff Rizzo was hit by a
pitch and scored when senior first
baseman John Gall drilled a 2-2
