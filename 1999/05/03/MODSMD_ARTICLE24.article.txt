# First! Card grabs Pac-10 lead
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
It was the quintessential tale of
two cities.
It was the worst of times in Los
Angeles, where the USC Trojans
were dropping two critical home
games to Pacific 10 Conference rival
UCLA this weekend.
Needless to say, it was the best of
times here in Palo Alto as the sixth
ranked Cardinal baseball team
swept the hapless Oregon State
Beavers (15-33, 3-15 Pac-10) in a
three-game series.

■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford (33-12,

uon State (15-33,3-15) K.

■ Saturday: Stanford 10, Oregon

■ Friday: Stanford 7, Oregon State
0.

As a result, Stanford (33-12,17-4)
has opened up a two-game lead on
the No. 17 Trojans (30-22, 15-6) in
the conference race with only three
league games remaining for both
teams.
"It's huge," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "A two
game lead with three to go — I like
that."
The weekend had a dramatic cul
mination as Stanford was forced to
rally twice Sunday to complete the

sweep and run its all-time record
against the Beavers to 10-0. After
putting together a two-out, four-run
rally in the seventh to forge a 6-6
deadlock, the Beavers responded
with a two-run home run by desig
nated hitter Curtis Davis to go back
on top. N-6.
Entering the bottom of the ninth.
Stanford still found itself down by

the same margin. It was about then
that a final score filtered up from
Los Angeles and was announced
over the public address system.
The Trojans had fallen. 8-5.
"We didn't say much." said se
nior third baseman Josh Hochge
sang. referring to the mood on the
bench heading into the bottom of
the ninth. "We knew we were defi

nitely capable of rallying. Two runs
is just a couple of hits away, and
that's just exactly what it took."
Indeed, the rally was swift with an
edgy conclusion. Junior second
baseman Jeff Rizzo was hit by a
pitch and scored when senior first
baseman John Gall drilled a 2-2

triple. Sophomore right fielder Joe
Borchard followed it up by also get
ting hit by a pitch.
Hochgesang grounded his first
offering down the left field line to
bring Gall home for the tying run
and send Borchard to second. After
a sacrifice bunt, junior left fielder
Nick Day came up to the plate with
Borchard, representing the winning
run. now standing at third base.
Third base coach Dean Stotz
"told me that if the ball was hit on
the ground, I was going." Borchard
said.
Day slapped a high bouncer back
up the middle with Borchard storm
ing toward the plate. Second base
man Corrie Willkie knocked the ball
down and came up firing, but Bor
chard slid headfirst under the tag of
catcher Jeff Sakamoto, ending the
game and setting off a delirious cele
bratory scene near home plate.
The first two games of the series
did not have quite as much drama at
tached to them. Stanford pounded
Oregon State ace B.R. Cook earlv

and often on its way to an easy 10-5
victory Saturday. Cook lasted only
four and a third innings, allowing
nine runs and nine hits. Meanwhile,
USC blew a two-run lead in the
ninth and lost 3-2 to break the dead
lock atop the standings.
Leading the way was junior left
fielder Edmund Muth with three
hits, including his fourth home run
of the season. He capped off his day
by throwing out a runner at home
plate from center field, all encourag
ing signs that he is coming back
strong from the bout of meningitis
that plagued him in March.
"The main thing I need to get
back is my strength," Muth said. "I
had lost 15 pounds with the sickness
and I've gained about 10 back, so
I'm still five down. But the big thing
has been the strength. I was tired
and the stamina just wasn't there."
Friday night was the Jason
Young show — the abridged ver
sion. In a 7-0 Stanford victory that
took 2 hours. 23 minutes to play.
Young made quick work of the Ore
gon State batters. Mixing a lively
fastball, a shifty change and a devas
tating curveball, the sophomore
right hander struck out 13 and scat
tered five hits over nine innines.
