With a decisive 17-3 win over St. Mary's Col
lege on Saturday, the Stanford women's lacrosse
team (17-4, 10-1 Western Women's Lacrosse
League) secured a spot in the WWLL Final Four.
The team heads to the Final Four with hopes of
coming away with its third league championship
in five years.
"Hopefully, we will be able to put that feather
in our cap again. It is all part of a vision," said head
coach Heidi Connor. "This vear, our goals were to

win the league again — define our dominance and
then to beat an East Coast team."

WOMEN'S LACROSSE

■ Saturday: Stanford (17-4. 10-1 Western
Women's Lacrosse League) 17. St. Mary's (1-8, 1-
8)3.

The women have already achieved one of their
go;ils this season with exciting last-minute victo
ries over such East Coast teams as Pennsylvania
(S-7) and Holy Cross (12-11).
As for defending their title as league champi

ons, the women are off to a good start. Saturday's
substantial victory over St. Mary's advanced Stan
ford to a 3-0 record against the Gaels following
two previous 18-3 victories.
The Cardinal has been searching to no avail for
suitable competition on the West Coast and al
though playoff time has started, it certainly didn't
find much in its first-round matchup. However,
because of their past results with St. Mary's, the
Stanford women found it lough to maintain a se
rious, competitive mental focus.
