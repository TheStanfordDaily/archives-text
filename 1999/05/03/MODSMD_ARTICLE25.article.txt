WOMEN'S LACROSSE

■ Saturday: Stanford (17-4. 10-1 Western
Women's Lacrosse League) 17. St. Mary's (1-8, 1-
8)3.

The women have already achieved one of their
go;ils this season with exciting last-minute victo
ries over such East Coast teams as Pennsylvania
(S-7) and Holy Cross (12-11).
As for defending their title as league champi

ons, the women are off to a good start. Saturday's
substantial victory over St. Mary's advanced Stan
ford to a 3-0 record against the Gaels following
two previous 18-3 victories.
The Cardinal has been searching to no avail for
suitable competition on the West Coast and al
though playoff time has started, it certainly didn't
find much in its first-round matchup. However,
because of their past results with St. Mary's, the
Stanford women found it lough to maintain a se
rious, competitive mental focus.
"They were more up for the
game than we were," said sopho
more Katharine Barnes. "It was dif
ficult to play at our highest level."
Despite the score, the women ex
pressed some disappointment in
their level of play, especially at the
start of the game.
"St. Mary's had possession more
than they should have at the begin
ning," said senior goalie Stephanie
Tuerk.
As the game progressed, howev
er. the Cardinal began to play its
game regardless of the competition.
"We were able to pull together
and pick up the intensity toward the
end of the game," Barnes said.

Leading the scoring effort for the
Cardinal was junior Hedy Born with
four goals. Senior co-captain Carey
Jones had three goals. Barnes and
sophomore Kate Reilly nabbed two
goals each and junior Gabby Duno
and freshmen Li/ Britt. Caroline Os
terwise, Sara Lev, Emily Rodriguez
and Jenny Silverman had a goal
apiece.
In goal. Tuerk had four saves on
seven shots.
For St. Mary's, Amy Harms had
two goals while Megan Bryan
chipped in one.
The Cardinal will face DC- Davis
this weekend in the Final Four. Al
though Stanford has beaten Davis
twice this season, the women will
need to play their hardest in order to
keep a strong mental focus and en
sure a spot in the championship.
