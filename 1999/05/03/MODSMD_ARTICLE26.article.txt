## Cal sprinters overpower Card throwers, distance 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
There are times in the world of track and field when
an entire meet will he decided by the outcome of a sin
gle event. Before Saturday's Big Meet versus Califor
nia, Stanford head coach Vin Lananna projected that
the Big Meet title would hinge on the meet's final
event, the 1,600-meter relay.

■ Saturday: California 90, Stanford 73

Unfortunately for Stanford, it was the outcome of
another relay, the 400, that may have determined the
Cardinal's fate. When Stanford sprint and hurdle
standout Michael Harte pulled up with a strained ham
string during the third leg of the race, the complexion
of the Big Meet changed altogether.
"Losing Michael Harte really hurt us, because we
don't have a lot of depth in his areas — that was big,"
said Lananna. "He would have won the 110 hurdles,
which represents a 10-point swing, we may have won
the 4-by-100, and in the 100, he would have placed no
worse than second. All of a sudden, it was a whole dif
ferent meet."
Though Stanford captured 10 individual titles on
the day and swept all of the points in the 8(X)-, 1,500-
and 5,000-meter races, Cal's sprint domination was too
much for the Cardinal to bear. Cal won the meet. 90-
73.
Nevertheless, what the Cardinal lacked in a team
victory was more than made up for by a number of out
standing individual performances.
In the high jump, freshman Michael Ponikvar
soared to a season-best mark of seven feet, three inch
es to beat Cal's Ail-American Greg Walker. Clearing
the height on his final attempt. Ponikvar improved on
his provisional qualifier, which should be good enough
to usher him into the NCAA meet.
"Jumping against Walker really helped me along,"
said Ponikvar. "It was an intense meet, so I knew I
couldn't afford to mess up at any lower heights."
Though Ponikvar's victory was sealed when Walk
er missed his final attempt at 7-3. Ponikvar maintained
his focus and cleared the height for the undisputed
championship.

"Going into my final attempt, I really was not in
timidated at all," said Ponikvar. "I thought I had real
ly good height on my second attempt, so I was confi
dent going in."
Ponikvar aced his final attempt, eliciting a huge
cheer from the Stanford crowd.
"Getting over at 7-3 was a big breakthrough,"
Ponikvar said. "It's nice to have this as a stepping
stone to our ultimate goal, the NCAA meet."
In the 5,000 meters, Jason Balkman cruised to a 13
minute, 52.85 second victory to set a new Big Meet
record by more than 10 seconds. Paced by brothers
Brad and Brent Hauser through the first 3,000 meters,
Balkman went on a tear and crossed the tape 18 sec
onds ahead of teammate Nathan Nutter (14:10.%) for
a seemingly effortless victory.
David Abril's last-lap surge secured a huge victory
for Stanford in the steeplechase in 9:15.28, a personal
best.
Chad Wassink owned the javelin, winning at 204-1
over Cal's Bevan Hart (181-9), and Adam Connolly's
hammer victory at 230-11 was just three inches shy of
David Popejoy's meet record.
Toby Stevenson captured a meet record of his own
in the pole vault at 17-6 1/2.
And though the meet's outcome was not decided bv
the 1,600-meter relay, the competition Lananna had
predicted did not disappoint.
Cal used the first two legs of the relay to stretch out
a strong lead over the Cardinal crew. When Stanford's
Ryan Carroll, who had previously led a Stanford
sweep of the 800, took the baton, the competition
heated up.
Carroll ran like a man possessed to chase down his
Cal counterpart. Closing the gap over the final turn.
Carroll blazed the homestretch to hand off the baton
to senior Jeff Allen with the two teams locked in a
dead heat.
Allen, the Big Meet 400 hurdles champion, ran
neck and neck with Cal's Wayne Boddy for the entire
ty of the 400-meter circuit. Crowds of bystanders from
the Cal and Stanford teams rushed the homestretch,
transforming the final 100 meters into a frenzied
gauntlet of cheering fanatics.

that Allen had nicked Buddy at the
tape, the official results showed

thiil Roddy's flailing effort had in

edge. 3:14.98 to 3:14.99.
"Our guys could have walked
away in the mile relay and said 'it
really doesn't matter what we do,' "
Lananna said. "But Jell Allen
asked to run the anchor ley in his

last Big Meet.
"Nothing can come close to de
scribing his leadership, his perfor

said Lananna.
