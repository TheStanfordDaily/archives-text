# Laser inventor dies at 77

### Michael R. Fainelli 
Arthur L. Schawlow, Stanford physics pro
fessor and co-inventor of the laser, died of heart
failure stemming from a long bout with
leukemia April 2K. He was 77.
In his career as a researcher, Schawlow cut a
blazing path across the world of physics. At Co
lumbia University, he co-invented the laser
with colleague and friend C harles H. Townes.
Although deemed "pure science" when first
built in 1960, the laser is essential to a wide
range of modern consumer products, including
the CD player, the bar-code scanner and the
fiber-optic cable.
After joining the Stanford faculty in 1%1 he
continued groundbreaking research in the field
of optical and microwave spectroscopy. His
work on the laser and its applications won him
the Nobel Prize in 1981.
Colleagues describe Schawlow as a brilliant
physicist, a dedicated teacher, an amiable joke
stcr and a warm-hearted man. Though he con
tinued his cutting-edge research, he also taught
undergraduate classes and chaired the Physics
Department from 1966 to 1970.
"He was always a tremendously invigorat
ing teacher," said Physics Prof. Bias Cabrera,
the current chair of the department.
Schawlow's colleagues also remember him
for his disarming sense of humor. "He was very
jollv. He was always telling jokes," recalled
Alexander Fetter, also a physics professor.
Particularly as department chair, he helped
to draw top physics talent to the faculty. Cabr
era said Schawlow was influential in recruiting
Physics Prof. Steven Chu, who won the Nobel
Prize in 1997.

Schawlow was born May 5, 1921, in Mount
Vernon. N.Y. His family moved to Toronto a
few years later, where he grew up.
With a scholarship in mathematics and
physics, Schawlow enrolled at the University of
Toronto, where he earned his doctorate in
1949.
As a post-doctoral fellow at Columbia Uni
versity, Schawlow worked with Townes, a pio
neer in the field of microwave spectroscopy. A
long-lasting friendship sprouted between the
two scientists, and Schawlow married Townes'
youngest sister. Aurelia. in 1951.
Anti-nepotism rules forced Schawlow to
take a job at Hell Telephone laboratories, but
he still found time on the weekends to collabo
rate with Townes on a design for the laser.
Schawlow joined the Stanford physics de
partment in 1961, where he continued to re
search the applications of the laser. In addition
tothe University's vast resources, he was drawn
by the proximity of Peninsula Children's Cen
ter, which could provide care for his autisic son,
Artie. Schawlow and his wife later helped
found a group home for people with autism.
On Oct. 20. 1981. on his way to a press con
ference after he won the Nobel Prize,
Schawlow stopped by a physics section and ad
dressed the students. "A while ago 1 found out
I was a very stupid person. Hut fortunately
there are a lot of other stupid people and there
are a lot of simple things that haven't been dis
covered. I hope all of you can discover some of
them and win a Nobel Prize."
Schawlow is survived by his son Artie, two
daughters Helen Johnson of Stevens Point,
Wise., and Edie Dwan of Charlotte, N.C., and
five grandchildren.
