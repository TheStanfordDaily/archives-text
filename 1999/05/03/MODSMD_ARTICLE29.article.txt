# Women cruise over Bears

Saturday's Big Meet versus California was supposed
to highlight the concept of team unity over individual
performances.
Stanford's victory of 92-71 was a sure indication that
the team as a whole succeeded, hut the goal of empha
sizing the group over the athlete may not have been ful
filled.
Several competitors were largely responsible for that
"failure," including sophomore pole vaulter Melissa Fe
instein.

WOMEN'S TRACK

■ Saturday: Stanford 92, California 71

Coming off an outstanding freshman year in which
she placed fourth at both the indoor and outdoor NCAA
championships, Feinstein had struggled throughout the
winter and early spring trying to perfect her form. Using
longer poles for the purpose of reaching a higher poten
tial height, Feinstein had not been able to produce the
same marks as last year.
That is. until Saturday.
Feinstein posted a huge personal best, setting the
school and Big Meet record with a vault of 13 feet, one
quarter inch. Her mark puts her tied for fifth on the na
tional list this year, just over an inch shy of the NCAA
automatic standard.
"It has been long in coming and feels good that the
pieces are finally coming together," Feinstein said.
Feinstein also competed in the high jump to try to
grab some extra team points. Her third-place clearance
of 5-1/4 gave the Cardinal a two-point advantage.
Heptathlete Tracve Lawyer also went a long way to
distract the crowd from focusing on the strong team ef
fort.
Compiling I<X points by herself with victories in the
high jump, 2(X)-meter dash, and the long jump — a sea
son-best 18-9 1/4 — the senior athlete showed just how
much she has meant to the Stanford program over her
four years.
Stanford head coach Vin Lananna was not surprised
with her efforts, which also included a second-place per
formance in the 1 (K) hurdles and a strong leg in a losing
effort in the 4(X)-meter relay.
"All the way around. Tracve is always going to be a
clutch performer," Lananna said. "No matter what the
situation is, you can always count on her. She's been like
that since day one."
"1 think it's a good ending to my career here, although
there's still a lot to go with [the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships] and NCAAs." Lawyer said. "It was a

Kit of fun; it was a great crowd and it was a great day.
You've just got to get pumped up. I was tired, but you've
got to go ahead and compete for the team."
Distance runners Mary Cobb and Julia Stamps
grabbed their share of the spotlight too, leading Stanford
to sweeps in the 3.(XH)- and S,(XX)-meters, respectively.
Cobb, a senior competing in her final Big Meet, came
through with her best performance of the season, run
ning way out in front of the pack for an NCAA provi
sional qualifying time of nine minutes, 34.92 seconds.
"More than just a meet against Cal. this is my last
home meet and the last chance to have the whole Stan
ford team here and that's a special thing." Cobb said. "I
am just really thankful for my last four years here."
In the 5.0()0, Stamps had a similar showing as Cobb
did in the 3,000. Never challenged, the sophomore
cruised to a provisional qualifying time of 16:29.07.
For Stamps, her race was also a breakthrough, as she
had struggled in her two previous races this season.
Another distance runner, fifth-year senior Sarna
Renfro. also made incremental steps toward returning
to the national scene. Renfro picked up third in the 3,(KK)
and second in the S.(KX) in a performance that exempli
fied her stav at the Farm.
