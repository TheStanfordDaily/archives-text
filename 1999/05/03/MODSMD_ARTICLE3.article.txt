# Dean Wais puts off Deke house decision
## Former Delts could save Dekes Mayfield home 
### Anuj Gupta Staff writer 
Because of what he called "new
information" received by his office,
Dean of Students Marc .Wais has
decided to postpone his decision on
whether to remove the Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity from its
house due to insufficient member
ship.
"The University was presented
with new information concerning
the DKE fraternity's spring rush
and projected fall occupancy,
which is currently being reviewed,"
Wais said.
"It's our intent to provide the
Dekes with a final decision regard
ing their housing status for next
year by the end of [this] week," he
added.

According to sources close to
the administration, the Dekes were
in danger of losing their house late
last week because of the "1(H) per
cent" rule, which requires each
housed Greek organization to
maintain sufficient membership to
completely fill its house as a condi
tion of keeping the house.
In the case of the Dekes, this
means finding a total of 33 new and
returning members to fill their
house at 592 Mayfield Avenue.
Although Wais declined to ad
dress the specific nature of the new
information, fraternity members
said the University did not have
correct information regarding the
fraternity's membership numbers.
"I don't believe the University
was aware of just how strong our
numbers really were,'" Deke junior
Scott Mease said.
"(Wais] didn't know our roster
was actually much larger than he
had thought. He had been present
ed with ;i preliminary list and hadn't
seen the final list." said junior Geoff
von ()eyen, who will be the house's
resident assistant, assuming the fra
ternity remains housed.
With the accurate numbers,
Mease said the Dekes are "very op
timistic" about their chances of re
taining their house.
"We're happy that the decision

was delayed and wasn't unilaterally
made," he added.
Von Oeyen coneurred.
**[W;iis'] decision was perfectly
normal, because he wasn't present
ed with all the facts," he said.
According to Mease, the new
Deke pledge class is, in part, being
drawn from the membership of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity, which is
currently unhoused.
"We are pledging a lot of foot
hall players and wrestlers who are
former Delts, but thev are all re

nouncing their membership with
that fraternity and are very excited
to be Dekes," Mease said.
Von Oeyen pointed out that
Deke's national policy deems it ac
ceptable to pledge men who have
deactivated their membership in
another fraternity.
Another concern for the Dekes
is the possibility that, if Wais de
cides to remove them from their
house, their status in the spring
housing Draw could be compro
mised.

The deadline for forming and
joining Draw groups was yesterday,
while the deadline for all students to
submit their housing applications
on Axess is this Sunday.
According to Kathleen Brans
licld. manager of Housing Assign
ment Services, all Deke members
would be assured of entering the
Draw if their house is taken away.
"They would be able to enter the
Draw.... They are not in jeopardy
of losing a guaranteed year and
being unable to be housed next

year," Bransfield said.
It is unclear, however, whether
the Dekes would be excepted from
the group deadline and still be able
to form Draw groups.
"We are hoping to be able to
form groups late and enter the
Draw should we lose our house,"
Mease said. "But we're hoping that
doesn't have to happen."
"I'm not too concerned," Von
()even said. "I feel that, now that they
have all the information, they will be
capable of making a fair decision."
