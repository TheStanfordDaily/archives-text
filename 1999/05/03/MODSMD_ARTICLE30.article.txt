## So hungry you can eat a horse 
### Bob Gates

With Stanford's stock portfolio reaching
all-time highs due to the burgeoning
national economy and with the new tuition
increase that students have to look forward
to, the University has decided to cut costs.
And they're hitting us where it hurts. You
guessed it: the underbelly of a horse.
The University has decided to drastically
reform Dining Services and completely ter
minate the Stanford Equestrian Team. Chefs
all over campus are being forced to come up
with new horse recipes, for next year their
refrigerators will be stocked with this year's
four-legged finest.
One chef told The Daily, "We're ecstatic!
We're looking forward to continuing our
theme dinners next year but with a new
horse menu! We will be serving horse burg
ers, horse enchiladas, horse kabobs and
peanut butter and horse! But don't worry,
we will continue serving fried ferret sticks
on Sunday nights!"
Zany!
Few students today know that the idea of
horses and Stanford Dining Services is not a
new one.
In fact, it goes back centuries to the
founder of Dining Services, Russian
Empress Catherine the Great, who actually

died while attempting to mount a fine steed.
The Stanfords continued the Dining
Services / horse association when their
favorite horse, who had the familiar name of
"Marguerite," passed away. Wee Little
Leland wanted the essence of his horse to
continue, so he had Dining Services cook up
a scheme.
Marguerite was gently boiled and gar
nished v/ith potatoes, carrots and peas until
a delicious, watery soup remained. Today,
we call that soup Stern Stew. And there's still
"a little Marguerite in every bowl you eat!"
thanks to the Dining Services practice of
reusing leftovers.
Since the Stern Stew is never completely
finished at each meal, a little of that original
stew has been passed down to today's stu
dents. That's why there's still a little
Marguerite essence in all of us!
Gideeyum!
