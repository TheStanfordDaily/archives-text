# Teaching us about 'real world'
## 
### Jake Greene 
It has come to my attention that Stanford
Dining Services has been attracting some
negative attention. Apparently, there are some
people in our midst who refer to our glorious
dining halls as "nasty," "rank" and "bootie."
These ungrateful brats just don't realize how
lucky they are. In the bubble of Stanford
University, we sometimes forget what it's like
to live in the "real world". The Stanford
Dining Services present us with priceless
"real" education.
So you may wonder what I'm talking about.
Well, let me offer an example or two. In the
"real world," items you wish to purchase are
often priced well above their actual value. At
the Stanford dining halls, you pav $9 a meal
for a bowl of brown lettuce and a moldy,
sloppy, udon noodle bar. This is also a tad
over priced.
4n the "real world," many people live by
themselves in small rooms, called apartments.
At Stanford, you too will be forced to live in a
small room by yourself, if you eat the "Baron
of Beef" that is offered by Dining Services
during the holiday season. Your small room
will have a nice, red X on the door, because
you will be quarantined.

Another smidgen of "real world" education
dished out by the culinary experts of Stanford
Dining Services is the process of selection. In
the "real world," people spend days or weeks
shopping for cars, furniture, houses, etc. You
see, you have to spend time looking for the
best items.
In the dining halls, you have to search for
the best dinnerware. If you don't, you may
end up with a hair on your rice or something
unusually crispy in your Rice Krispies.
Finally, the dining halls of our prestigious
University teach us how to interact with peo
ple. In the "real world," there are nice people
and not so nice people.
Why should it be any different in the dining
hall?
At lunch you may encounter an individual
who tells you to "enjoy your lunch" or "have a
nice day."
By the same token, you may encounter a
person who instructs you to "shove that
grilled cheese where the sun don't shine and
go play in the street."
Ladies and gentlemen next time you hear
someone bashing Dining Services, just
remind them about the "real world."
