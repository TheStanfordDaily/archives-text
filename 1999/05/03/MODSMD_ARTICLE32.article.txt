# COOKING WITH GAS!
## 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
Hello our friends. What's that you're eating
there? Dorm food, eh? Smells delicious. Oh,
it's not?
Well why don't we offer you a couple of
recipes this week to fill your tummy with
yummy delights. Few people know that we
are currendy collaborating on a cookbook
with Stanford Dining Services.
Unfortunately, our mentor and head chef
at the Lakeside Dining Commons was termi
nated last month from employment at the
University by the new regime that has taken
over. We have had to resort to emergency
measures.
We have contacted both Martha Stewart
and Julia Child, and they have agreed to par
ticipate in our venture. Our working title is
"Sizzling Delights by S&P and the Pros." All of
the ingredients are available and used by a
regular basis by Dining Services. Have a taste:
MEAT
The most important part about carnivore
dishes is the quality of the meat. Here at
Stanford, we proudly serve the same quality
as state and federal penitentiaries across the
country. Delicious, no?
Make sure that you allow your meat to
thaw in a rat-infested environment for at least
three months. That will give the E. coli
enough time to die. Then carefully hike your
slabs and microwave

them in the cheapest
sauce available at the
99- cent store. If the
price of the sauce
exceeds a buck, don't
worry, do what Dining
Services does: visit
Cowell and pick up
some free blood.

POTATOES
True, the head of
Dining Services is prob
ably some old Irishman.
But what's up with all
the potatr.es? Aren't you
sick of eating the same

baked potato every dinner? Why not try this
Smash one whole potato with a spork .
(available at Taoo Hell)
Blend throroughlv with sticky rice.
(also available every night)
Add a dollop or more of mayonnaise.
Enjoy!

NAVY BEANS
Don't get us started on beans. We love
beans. Beans for breakfast, lunch and dinner!
Beans! Beans! Beans!
Yes, these are the same beans that are
served in the navy. And they just so happen to
be the bean of the month at Lompoc
Penitentiary.
We tried long and hard to come up with a
recipe that would improve upon the lard
soaked navy bean but to no avail. The navy
bean, right out of the can, is the perfect way
to usher in a bowel movement. Prunes don't
even come close, plus they're too expensive.
FISH
Fresh out of lake Lag, these slimy little
critters with two heads are not of any partic
ular breed, but Dining Services has chosen to
call them red snapper. Bony, slimy and deli
cious, the snapper will get revved up for a hot
night of sex. This dish is particularly delicious
eaten off of the body of a loved one. Start
with the head, and move your way to the tail.
That's right, munch on that fish. Yeah, baby,
you got the groove going on.

THE POOR BOY SANDWICH
At $9 a meal, poor boy my ass!
FRUIT
Where are grapes, folks? We're working
hard to get Dining Services to approve the
following recipe for grape confit:
1 container of Concord Grape Jelly
2 bunches of freshly picked green grapes
1 cup hand-squeezed grape juice
DESSERT
Sick of green Jell-o and banana bread day
after day? Why make your own Sweet and
Pungent after-dinner snack: the S&P special.
Follow the recipe closely:

1 bowl of butter, sugar and
canned fruit ("cobbler")
2 teaspoons of house milk
3 dollops of runny ice
cream
1 section of dry orange with
bug's nest inside
Sprinkle Jimmies to flavor
(no guys, not those jimmies
— get your minds out of
the gutter, what do you
think this is — "comic
vomit"?)
Combine in an overheat
ed bowl with wet "freshly
cleaned" silverware.
Yummy!


"Damn, we gotta eat that Stanford food again?"
