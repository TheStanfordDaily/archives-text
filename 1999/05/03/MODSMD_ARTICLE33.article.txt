# TASTE THIS!
## 
### Bob Gates 
The Diversions section has recently received letters which
describe our articles as "tasteless." We were unsure of exactly what
this meant. So, in the spirit of inter-group cooperation, we went to
Stanford Dining Services for some answers. Here's how some chefs
Jefine "tasteless:"
CHEF A. KISSER: To me, it means a job well done.
CHEF S. DAILY: To me, it means not offending anyone. Some peo
ple like spice and flavor. Others like warm gruel. We try to reach a
happy medium by keeping our dishes as neutral and bland as pos

sible. That way no one is upset. And no one's stomach is upset by
gas and the consequent expulsion of hot air.
CHEF REG I ME: You will eat what I give you!
CHEF I. RATE: Why don't you just write out a complaint card and
shove it up your $#@!!
CHEF TOOMUCH SCI FI: "Comic vomit" or "without flavor
on a galactic scale." Engage!
After talking to these remarkable individuals, we still have no
idea what this strange term means. Oh well.
