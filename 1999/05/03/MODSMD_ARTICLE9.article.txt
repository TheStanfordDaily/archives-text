### 
RAMSTEIN, Germany (AP) — Three U.S.
soldiers released by Yugoslav authorities stepped
off a plane at a military base in Germany yester
day to salutes from their Army buddies and wild
cheers from a tlag-waving crowd.
Their arrival after more than a month in cap
tivity capped an emotional, daylong journey by
land and air. from Yugoslavia's capital.
"Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty,
free at last." they chanted as they walked across
the Yugoslav border into Croatia hand-in-hand
with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who arranged their
release in Belgrade hours earlier.
There were no signs that the soldiers' release
would prompt a new diplomatic initiative or a
halt in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The
alliance continued to attack the Balkan nation
yesterday.
The soldiers, dressed in Army fatigues, were
exuberant and appeared healthy, standing tall
and walking briskly. But they still showed signs of

the cuts and bruises they suffered when captured
on a patrol mission along the Macedonia-
Yugoslav border on Mar. 31.
They told journalists that they were treated
humanely but were still glad to be out.
"It's a great relief to be free," Staff Sgt.
Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.,
said during the stop at the Croatian border town
of Bajakovo. He said his scars and bruises came
from his capture and after that, "the maltreat
ment stopped."
"We were treated very well," Staff Sgt.
Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, added
later before boarding the plane to Germany.
"We're doing good, we're healthy. As you can
see we're very happy. Mostly happy."
Jackson, who accompanied them out of
Yugoslavia, said he would meet with President
Clinton as early as today to deliver a letter from
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic with
proposals to end the five-week NATO air cam

paign and resolve the crisis over Kosovo, includ
ing a face-to-face meeting.
At Ramstein, the civil rights leader, looking
tired, said Milosevic had made a gesture toward a
diplomatic solution, and urged Clinton to consid
er the offer. "Diplomacy deserves reciprocity,"
he said. "Let's seize the opportunity."
Clinton did not immediately comment on the
proposal to meet with Milosevic and gave no
indication that he was willing to cede anything to
the Yugoslav leader.
The soldiers were taken captive while
patrolling the Yugoslav-Macedonia border as
part of a peacekeeping mission, seven days after
NATO launched its bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia.
The release came early yesterday morning
after an unusually quiet night in the allied bomb
ing campaign against the Yugoslav capital, Bel
grade, although there were strikes throughout
the rest of Yugoslavia.
