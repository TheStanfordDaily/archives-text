# Freshmen apply for college priority
## University may have difficulty filling spaces 
### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
Two months after the an
nouncement of the new Fresh
man / Sophomore College,
University officials are excited
about the number of priority
housing requests made by stu
dents.

According to Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya, about 90 students indicated in
terest in joining the college by filling out applica
tions for two types of priority for the Sterling Quad
locus houses. The college will host various acade
mic programs for first- and second-year students.
The college is scheduled to house 1 «S() students
with about half the residents freshman and the

other halt sophomores.
The number of priorities awarded, though, is
not necessarily an indication of how many students
will request to live in the college.
Any current freshman can list the college as a
housing preference in the spring quarter housing
lottery. All students with priority will be assigned
before students without priority.
Once a student has received priority status,
however, he or she can still opt not to place the col
lege among his or her Draw preferences. So it is
possible that some number of the 90 spaces will be
filled with students who did not request priority.
An unscientific survey of freshmen in Branner,
Paloma and Mirlo revealed that the actual level of
student interest in the program may not be reflect
ed by the number of priority applications.
Of the 72 freshmen surveyed bv The Daily, six

students said they applied to be part of the college,
but three of those six expressed reservations about
joining the program.
One student, who asked not to be identified, in
dicated that she had applied for priority standing
but described the choice as a backup plan if she re
ceived a bad Draw number.
Two other students indicated they had applied
for priority status but had since changed their
minds and were not planning on listing the college
among their residential choices.
Students who do agree to list the college as their
first residence choice obtain priority one consider
ation and first chance at the spaces in the college,
while those who request priority but do not rank it
first among their Draw preferences will receive

second priority consideration, after
those with priority one.
According to Montoya, of the 90
students who applied for priority,
roughly 60 applied for priority one
and 30 for priority two.
He said they plan to allocate at
least 10 and possibly 20 spots to in
coming sophomore transfer stu
dents.
Sophomore transfers will be
given the opportunity to choose
among the new college, four-class
dormitories and single-class dormi
tories, while incoming freshmen will
have an additional option: the Pro
gram in Structured Liberal Educa
tion. Freshmen in SLE live together
in Florence Moore Hall and take the
same exclusive year-long, 9-unit
course in their dormitory.

An oft-cited reason current fresh
men give for not applying to the new
college is the college's apparent sim
ilarity to the SLE program.
"It seems to me that what they are
trying to do is recreate the SLE expe
rience," freshman and current SLE
participant Daniel Moreau said.
As in SLE many of the courses
will he held in the college residence,
hut unlike SLE the courses will be
open to other sophomores and fresh
men not living in the college.
However, University officials are
quick to stress the differences be
tween the two.
"Unlike SLE, the new Fresh
man/Sophomore College will not
require students to take any specific
courses," said Elise Maar, student af
fairs officer and special assistant to
Montoya. "Our focus will be to ex
plore the liberal arts and sciences, to
help the students find their pas
sions."

Another major objection from
students is the location of the dormi
tories selected to house the col
lege — Adams and Schiff. Both are
part of Sterling Quad and have been
reserved for upperclassmen in past
years. The most frequent reason stu
dents surveyed gave for not applying
was that Sterling Quad is so far from
the center of campus.
Among those polled, many
freshmen said they believe the loca
tion combined with the residential
based education will lead to isola
tion from other freshmen and
sophomores.
To publicize the program, the
University held four general infor
mation sessions, advertised in The
Daily and notified freshman advisers
and advising associates of the oppor
tunity.
However, a large number of stu
dents surveyed were either unaware
the program's existence or its details.

Hut some expressed excitement over
the program; many said it would he a
good opportunity for incoming
freshmen.
"I signed up. because it seemed
like a great opportunity," freshman
David Bronner said. "The faculty in
teraction was what attracted me to
the program."
Freshman Brynnen Sandoval
concurred, saying that it would be a
great opportunity to meet profes
sors.
Ass(x\ Dean of the School of En
gineering John Bravman. a professor
of material sciences and the dean of
the new college, cautions against the
assumption that there will he forced
interaction between faculty and stu
dents.
"It is not so much force-feeding
student-faculty interaction," Brav
man said. "What we will do is get the
students used to seeing the faculty as
another resource."
