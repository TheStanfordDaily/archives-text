# Freshmen apply for college priority
## University may have difficulty filling spaces 
### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
Two months after the an
nouncement of the new Fresh
man / Sophomore College,
University officials are excited
about the number of priority
housing requests made by stu
dents.

According to Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya, about 90 students indicated in
terest in joining the college by filling out applica
tions for two types of priority for the Sterling Quad
locus houses. The college will host various acade
mic programs for first- and second-year students.
The college is scheduled to house 1 Â«S() students
with about half the residents freshman and the

other halt sophomores.
The number of priorities awarded, though, is
not necessarily an indication of how many students
will request to live in the college.
Any current freshman can list the college as a
housing preference in the spring quarter housing
lottery. All students with priority will be assigned
before students without priority.
Once a student has received priority status,
however, he or she can still opt not to place the col
lege among his or her Draw preferences. So it is
possible that some number of the 90 spaces will be
filled with students who did not request priority.
An unscientific survey of freshmen in Branner,
Paloma and Mirlo revealed that the actual level of
student interest in the program may not be reflect
ed by the number of priority applications.
Of the 72 freshmen surveyed bv The Daily, six

students said they applied to be part of the college,
but three of those six expressed reservations about
joining the program.
One student, who asked not to be identified, in
dicated that she had applied for priority standing
but described the choice as a backup plan if she re
ceived a bad Draw number.
Two other students indicated they had applied
for priority status but had since changed their
minds and were not planning on listing the college
among their residential choices.
Students who do agree to list the college as their
first residence choice obtain priority one consider
ation and first chance at the spaces in the college,
while those who request priority but do not rank it
first among their Draw preferences will receive
