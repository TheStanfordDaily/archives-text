Indonesian soldier kills at least 19 villagers
PULO RUNGKOM, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian troops
searching for a kidnapped soldier fired on villagers in a northern
province yesterday, killing at least 19 and injuring dozens, doctors and
witnesses said.
A local military spokesman, who identified himself as Lt. Edy, said
the death toll was IS.
The violence in Aceh province broke out after hundreds of soldiers
converged on the village of Pulo Rungkom to demand that residents
release a soldier who had been abducted over the weekend.
The shooting comes one month before nationwide parliamentary
elections that are seen as a lest of Indonesia's transition to democra
cy. Separatists in Aceh plan to boycott the voting.
Aceh is in northern Sumatra island. 1.1(H) miles northwest of Jakar
ta, and is one of three Indonesian provinces where small groups of
rebels are fighting for independence.
In Pulo Rungkom. hundreds of villagers, including women and
children, surrounded the troops when they arrived. The soldiers
opened fire after a period of tense negotiations.
Lt. Col. Anyanto, military chief of staff in the nearby city of Lhok
seumawe, described the clash as an exchange of gunfire between sol
diers and civilians. Four military trucks were hit by bullets, he said.
Ambulances rushed to the scene and wailing sirens mixed with the
screams of the injured. Many victims were treated by medics at the
hospital of PT Arun, a government-owned oil and gas refinery.
Local reporters said they saw 11 bodies at the refinery hospital.
Three people died and eight people were being treated for bullet
wounds at a private clinic in Lhokseumawe.
Premier reappointed amid head scarf incident
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey's president stood firm against
mixing Islam with politics yesterday, reappointing his pro-secular pre
mier amid an uproar created by a legislator who defied convention by
wearing an Islamic head scarf to Parliament.
President Suleyman Demirel reappointed Bulent Ecevit as premier
and asked him to form a new government in a move nearly overshad
owed by the turmoil prompted by the head scarf incident.
For Turkey's establishment, the scarves are a political statement
challenging the secular system. Scarves are banned in public offices
and schools and civil servants are forbidden to wear them.
Prosecutors opened an investigation yesterday against the legisla
tor on possible charges of inciting religious hatred.
The controversy came just weeks after April IS elections won by
Ecevit's Democratic Left Party. The party's 136 deputies need coali
tion partners to take power in the 550-member Parliament.
Ecevit has ruled out the Islamic Virtue Party. Turkey's staunchly
pro-secular generals oppose Virtue and pressured its predecessor out
of power two years ago.
That leaves the far-right Nationalist Movement party, which was
second in the polls with 129 seats, as the strongest contender for a
partnership. • v • - ► , ti %,.> «
The election showed support slipping for the Islamic party, once
the largest in Parliament. Virtue lost 33 seats, slipping to third place.
Some analysts said the head scarf controversy could hurt it even more.
An infuriated Ecevit interrupted Sunday's swearing-in ceremony
in Parliament when Virtue deputy Merve Kavakei showed up in her
scarf.
The assembly erupted into shouts of "Get out!" and she left with
out taking the oath of office.
Motive behind London bombings still unclear
LONDON (AP) — A man accused of killing three people in a
series of nail-bomb explosions appeared in court yesterday in a brief
hearing that shed no light on the motive for attacks apparently aimed
at gays and racial minorities.
David Copeland, 22, spoke only to confirm his address and did not
enter a plea during a five-minute hearing at West London Magistrates
Court.
Copeland was charged Sunday with murdering three people with a
bomb that exploded Friday evening at the Admiral Duncan, a gay pub
in central London.
More than 70 people were injured: 19 remained hospitalized yes
terday.
He was also charged with three counts of causing explosions,
including an attack April 17 in Brixton, south London, injuring 39
people, and another in Brick Lane in east London a week later, injur
ing seven.
Brixton has a large Afro-Caribbean community, and Brick Lane
has a concentration of Bangladeshis. Several white-supremacist
groups had claimed responsibility for the Brixton blast, but police said
Copeland, who is white, had no connection with any of them.
Prince Charles visited the scene of the pub bombing yesterday and
said he wished to "show a little bit of concern and solidarity." He also
planned to visit some of the injured.
U.S. scientists use satellites to monitor volcano
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Trying to monitor molten rock deep
within the Earth, scientists from the United States and Mexico are
looking to the skies for help.
Geologists are expanding a network of detectors that monitor
Global Positioning System satellites to try to determine if the
Popocatepetl volcano is expanding or contracting. That could help
determine if it is likely to explode.
"The logistical difficulties are huge." said Tim Dixon of the Uni
versity of Miami. "It's high up. It's cold. It's dangerous. And also, GPS
until recently has been very expensive."
With scientific-quality stations costing $3(),(XK) apiece, investigators
until now had been able to afford only two — each a plexiglass dome
on a pole planted in a concrete base.
But Dixon said new, cheaper models mean "we can afford to put
many more out." Within a year, he hopes to have 10 stations, each of
which can report their position within an inch or so.
"What we speculate is that if Popo was going to explode like it does
every few thousand years in a massive eruption, prior to that explo
sion there would have to be an inllux of new magma into the system."
he said.
The pressure of that magma deep within the Earth might cause the
surface to swell, moving the monitors a few inches farther from one
another. If the monitors moved closer together, it could indicate a
lessened pressure.
So far, the two instruments in operation showed a bit of deforma
tion in mid-1996, but no movement since, despite repeated eruptions
by the volcano that have sent plumes of ash and gas miles into the sky.
