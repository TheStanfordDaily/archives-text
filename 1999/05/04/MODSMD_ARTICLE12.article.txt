LANDSTUHL, Germany
(AP) — Upbeat and safe at a U.S.
military hospital in Germany, three
servicemen released by Yugoslavia
were joyfully reunited with their
families on their first full day of free
dom yesterday.
Army doctors pronounced the
soldiers in generally good shape, but
checkups also revealed fractured ribs
and a broken nose, raising questions
about how they were treated during
their capture and month in captivity.
The Army declined to comment
on how the injuries were sustained,
citing the ongoing examinations and
investigation into the circumstances
of their March 31 capture on the
Yugoslav-Macedonia border.
Before arriving at the Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center on Sun
day, the soldiers told reporters that
their scars and bruises stemmed
from their capture but said they were
generally treated well after that.
Their commander, Maj. David
Grange of the Ist Infantry division,
was skeptical.
"I think it might have been they
were poorly treated at the beginning,
but that'll be determined," he said.
Col. Mack Blanton, chief of clini
cal services at the hospital, said all
three were in good spirits and excit
ed about seeing their loved ones
again.
Each had a private reunion with
family members who had arrived in
Germany on overnight flights from
the United States. A few hours later,
they stepped onto a hospital balcony
together, beaming and holding on to
each other. They waved briefly to
reporters and camera crews kept
across the street by military police.
Grange said the parents were
"very upbeat, very positive and
proud of their sons. Just like their
units are in Germany."
The family members, suffering
from jet lag, were not expected to
talk with reporters yesterday, offi
cials said. They were to remain in
Germany for a few days.

After being released in Belgrade
Sunday, the soldiers traveled by bus
to Croatia and then were flown to
Germany, accompanied by civil
rights leader Jesse Jackson, who had
negotiated their release with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo
sevic.
Jackson hoped Clinton would
reciprocate by offering a respite
from airstrikes, now in their sixth
week. But NATO refused to reward
the gesture and the alliance contin
ued to pound Yugoslavia.
The soldiers spent Sunday
evening on the telephone, watching
television and relaxing, then had a
good night's sleep, hospital officials

said.
Medical tests yesterday revealed
that Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24,
of Los Angeles, had two fractured
ribs, one on each side, and Staff Sgt.
Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths
Creek, Mich., had a fractured nose.
Ramirez had a small cut on the
top of his head that was stitched
while he was in captivity and swelling
on his right lower leg that will
require further X-rays, Blanton said.
Ramirez could not remember how
the injury to his leg occurred, he said.
Stone's broken nose was discov
ered after a CT scan run on his head
to examine the bruises and abrasions
on his face.

"In general his condition is good,"
Blanton said.
Spec. Steven Gonzales, 22, of
Huntsville, Texas, "turned out fine"
in initial checkups and has no further
medical tests scheduled for the time
being, he said.
Unit "buddies" were assigned to
each soldier "to help them repatri
ate," a process that normally lasts
three days and includes checkups,
debriefings. decompression and fam
ily reunions, said Lt. Col. Sharon
Deßuvo, the hospital's nursing chief.
She said the three soldiers "took
excellent care of themselves'' white
in captivity, doing push-ups and sit
ups to stay fit.
