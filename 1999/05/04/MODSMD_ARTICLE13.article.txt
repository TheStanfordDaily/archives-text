# Belgrade blacked out by 'soft bombs'

### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Storekeep
ers lit their shops with candles and work crews
slowly restored electricity in Belgrade yesterday
after NATO blacked out the Yugoslav capital
with "soft bombs" that short-circuited power sta
tions.
It was the first time civilians in Belgrade and
elsewhere across Serbia had suffered such a mas
sive blackout since the allied air campaign began.
Cities and towns across Yugoslavia slowly were
recovering electricity and water after NATO jets
blasted power plants in strikes aimed at disrupting
President Slobodan Milosevic's military machine.
But many people were still without power at dusk.
The strikes show that "NATO has its finger on
the light switch in Yugoslavia now and we can turn
the power off whenever we need to and whenever
we want to," alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said.
NATO has promised to target military sites
and installations and tried to minimize disruptions
to civilians, but the latest airstrikes on electrical
sites temporarily affected 70 percent of Serbia,
alliance officials said. The alliance said these
strikes had damaged command-and-control facili
ties used by the army and that damage to civilian
power networks could be repaired by the
Yugoslavs.
Warplanes struck at Kostolac's power grid 50

miles east of the capital, which supplies much of
eastern Serbia. NATO bombers also hit electricity
transformer yards as well at Nis, Novi Sad.
Drmno. Obrenovac and Banina Basta on the 40th
day of allied bombing.
A NATO official said allied forces used a "soft
bomb" on the transformer stations that explode
over it. dispersing graphite strips that cause a short
circuit.
The alliance emphasized that important facili
ties like hospitals had reserve power to continue
operating.
Civilians suffered disruptions from the black
out all day. Traffic lights were not working in Bel
grade, hut by late yesterday night several local
channels in Belgrade were able to broadcast state
TV.
Some stores opened despite the power outage,
using candles to light their interiors. People
stocked up on canned food and other non-perish
ables as well as candles, batteries, small transistor
radios and mineral water.
Air raid warnings sounded in Belgrade yester
day evening, with large parts of the city in dark
ness. Yugoslav air defenses were active and deto
nations could be heard. In Novi Sad, the TV build
ing was hit and was engulfed in flames, eyewit
nesses reported.

Yugoslav media, meanwhile, blamed NATO
warplanes for an attack on a bus 12 miles north of
the Kosovo city of Fee. Television footage from
the scene showed a white bus with shattered win
dows, flat tires and three or so bodies on the
ground on a rural mountain road.
Other footage by TV crews taken to the site by
Serb authorities showed dead bodies in the bus, its
doorway and beside a burned-out car. Belgrade
radio and television stations said 20 people were
killed and 43 injured.
NATO's target was thought to have been a
nearby police and army checkpoint, Montenegro's
Montena-fax news agency said. The Serb Media
Center quoted officials in Pec as saying the bus
was full of women and children.
NATO — which has admitted mistaken
airstrikes since April 12 that have left about 159
people dead — began the air campaign to force
Milosevic to accept a peace deal for Kosovo and
halt atrocities against ethnic Albanians.
The attacks came amid fresh diplomatic efforts
to end the conflict, with Russian special envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin arriving to Washington yes
terday to meet with President Clinton.
But the White House and NATO said there
can be no deal until Milosevic meets all their
demands.
