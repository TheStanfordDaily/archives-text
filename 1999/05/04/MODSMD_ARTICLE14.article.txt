# Man arrested on suspicion of supplying pistol in Columbine killings
## Investigators hone in on accomplices 
### 
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) — A man was
arrested yesterday on suspicion of supplying the
semiautomatic pistol used in the Columbine High
massacre.
Mark Manes, 22, surrendered to authorities
and was jailed on $15,(XX) bail for investigation of
providing a handgun to a minor. He could get up
to six years in prison.
"He was the last person who had it before it
was supplied to one of our gunmen." said sheriffs
spokesman Steve Davis.
Manes was the first person since the massacre
14 days ago to be arrested and accused of helping
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold arm
themselves. Investigators have focused on anyone
who could have helped them assemble and posi
tion their arsenal of guns and more than 50 bombs.
Investigators said an employee at a pizza parlor
where Harris and Klebold worked served as the
middleman who put the two teen-agers in touch
with Manes.
The arrest came 14 days after the attack in

which Harris and Klebold —armed with a rille,
two sawed-off shotguns and the handgun — killed
12 students and a teacher and then committed sui
cide.
Investigators have said Klebold's girlfriend,
Robyn Anderson, bought a carbine rifle and two
sawed-off shotguns used in the massacre, but until
yesterday they had not tied anyone to the TEC
DC-9 semiautomatic handgun.
Also yesterday, Columbine students returned
to classes at rival Chatfield High School.
For the rest of the school year. Chatfield stu
dents get their school for morning sessions.
Columbine students, whose school is still a police
crime scene, arrived around lunchtime yesterday
to take over Chatfield for afternoon classes.
Three large banners adorned the school, one
reading simply: "Welcome Columbine."
Columbine students Veronica Nuncio and (ire
anna Cook, both 17-year-old juniors, showed up
for their first day of classes in a small car with the
words "We are Columbine" on the back window.

"They've been really nice, very supportive,"
Cook said of the Chatfield students and staff.
Nuncio said she was near the cafeteria when
shooting broke out in her school, and she saw peo
ple get shot. She said she still has trouble sleeping,
and she was nervous about going back to school.
"1 don't feel safe still," she said. "I feel like I'm
a walking target for anybody now."
Chatfield, about 3 miles from Columbine, was
decorated to welcome the roughly 2.000
Columbine students, with signs incorporating the
Chatfield Chargers' signature burgundy with the
Columbine Rebels' navy blue.
"If we can do anything to help them, we're
happy to do it," said Amber Mancuso, a Chatfield
junior. "1 think it's hit all of us hard, all of us have
friends there. When we found out, probably half
the school was crying."
"We're welcoming them with open arms,"
Chatfield senior Chris Durant said. "Students are
trying to do what they can to make the Columbine
students feel comfortable."
