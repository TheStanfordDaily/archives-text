## Editorial Picking our battles 
### 
Each of us needs to
realize our potential
to affect real change

THE VIETNAM WAR era was
no doubt a drastically different
time on college campuses and
nationwide. Students ni ide their voic
es heard. Iliey fought for what they
believed in. ITiey hoped that one voice
might make a difference in a sea of
millions.
Why should the spirit of advocacy
and criticism be confined as a dark
reminder of our collective past?
Few current students remember or
even know of the April lliird Move
ment of the '60s, named for the date
when hundreds of Stanford students
began an 11-day occupation of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory in
protest of the war in Vietnam.
Yesterday's Daily contained a letter
from Stanford alumna Marjorie Cohn,
who reminisced on her experience par
ticipating in the Movement. She wrote
that students found "(ourselves) trans
forming the very world |we| were
studying.... Hie war was being fought
in our own backyard. And we felt per
sonally responsible."
What does it take for students today
to feel passionate about an issue bigger
than themselves? Why do so many stu
dents live in a world of complacency
and apathy regarding issues of impor
tance and concern?
Granted, the world is a verv differ
ent place today than it was 30 years
ago. Issues are different; so are people.
Hut the fundamental things that mat
ter to us have not changed. The value
placed upon human life, ideas and
beliefs are just as important a part of
our humanity now as before.
Last week, an "apolitical" candle
light vigil was held in White Plaza by
students expressing concern over the
conflict in Kosovo. What could have

been an opportunity for students to
express their views on a war that has
cost so many human lives was a gath
ering of a mere 40 students from a Uni
versity of thousands.
What a pathetic show of concern
from a community that claims to value
the pursuit of morality, diversity and
knowledge so highly. Shame on us for
wasting such a valuable opportunity.
Yet at the same time, we see the
University community rallying enthu
siastically to the aid of workers at Stan
ford hospital. Rallies were held last
week to protest pending layoffs, and
nearly I,(HK) petitions were hand-deliv
ered on behalf of the hundreds of
employees that will be affected.
Iliis of course is not to marginalize
the fallout that the proposed layoffs at
UCSF-Stanford Health Care will have
when implemented. But it is interest
ing to see what battles this University
community picks to fight.
To the outsider looking in at our
community, how selfish we must seem
as we fight for things that directly
affect us while turning our backs on
other issues that affect fellow humans
in other parts of the world. Kosovo
may be confined for many of us to our
television sets and newspapers. But
that does not make what is happening
there any less real and tragic.
Must an issue affect us directly
before we are compelled enough to
act?
As Cohn wrote in her letter yester
day:"It is here we have the opportuni
ty to study; but it is here we also have
the responsibility to use our knowl
edge to change ourselves and, in turn,
our community."
As the 3()th anniversary of the April
lliird Movement has come and gone,
each of us should look at ourselves,
both collectively and as individuals, to
see what we have fought for lately.
Only through our actions will we
define what is important to each of us
and the community in which we live.
