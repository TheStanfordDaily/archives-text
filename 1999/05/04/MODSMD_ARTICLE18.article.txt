IT'S NICE TO be liked,
but it's better by far to
get paid," one of my
favorite songs would have
it. Considering the jockey
ing for position that
accompanies the autumn
recruiting season, it would

appear that many seniors have accepted this
observation as a truism.
It's been disconcerting to watch the slow
trickle of my classmates towards the Career
Development Center, embossed portfolio in
hands and a litany of P / E ratios and profit
margin statistics on their lips and, recalling
their comments in CIV section, to wonder
who in the world would ever hire them.
Even more surprising are the salaries gradu
ates can pull down; a couple of years ago, I
remember one friend of mine being dumb
struck when he realized that, in his first year
out of college, he was probably going to
make more money than his parents did.
Looking on, those of us with mixed feel
ings about Stanford's propensity to churn
out pre-capitalists at a rate roughly equal to
pre-meds might feel tempted to wring our
hands in despair. Is this what it comes down
to? Must the winds of freedom simply blow
us into the safe havens of I-banking and
management consulting? Where's the intel
lectual challenge? Where's the joy of mean
ingful commitment?
Well, perhaps we shouldn't be so hasty to
turn our noses up towards those who go into
"trade," as the Bonnets and the Morlands
might have put it. There's a striking assump

tion that emerges in those lofty-minded
speeches on the duties of the "best and
brightest" that are hard to avoid once arriv
ing at Stanford — a focus on paying one's
debt to society implying that these contribu
tions are best made from the laboratory or
the courtroom and that the resulting
rewards are sweetest when they are emo
tional rather than material.
This stance of intellectual snobbery
seems to leave little breathing room for our
future corporate peons and captains of
industry. It's easy to mock those who plunge
into CS 106 A, no matter how many late days
and hours of debugging they may have to
endure, in order to take advantage of the
Valley's techie shortage and start collecting
slock options. But, at the same time, there
are many entrepreneurs among us who may
find it difficult to keep hold of their innova
tive hopes in a campus culture that's so
intent on the mainstream.
Stanford's position in the midst of one of
the nation's richest regions only heightens
the temptation to abandon one's ideas and
take the easy way out. Many feel compelled
to drift into careers for which they have no
affinity as a way of making good on their
family's investment or simply to get rich. I
can't help pitying those who say they're only
going to sell their souls to venture capitalists
or software producers for a decade and then,
afterwards, figure out what they "really"
want to do with their lives.
The most troubling phenomenon,
indeed, is the bland adoption of the tradi
tional corporate mindset that seems to occur

once one has been sucked into "the system."
Though one's company may be destroying
endangered habitats and producing its
goods in sweatshops — or just arranging the
loans that make it all possible — it's easy to
ignore the idea of individual responsibility.
With little emotional investment in one's
job, it's quite simple to accept a ready-made
set of preferences and assumptions and
accept the paycheck, leading to crises of lib
eral guilt that do so much to support the
work of the established public advocacy
groups.
Looking ahead, then, it seems as though
we have little choice but to surrender to the
corporate world and make no great attempts
to maintain the courage of our convictions.
This would certainly seem to be the example
of the baby boomers, who railed so strongly
against the military-industrial complex in
the '60s only to become the mutual-funders
of the ,( X)s. But maybe we should recognize
that there is a third option available: you
have the option to put your talent in eco
nomics towards encouraging microcredit
loans rather than leveraged buyouts; that
maybe your first factory will feature sustain
able materials rather than smokestacks; that
maybe doing well, doing good and doing
what you love aren't necessarily incompati
ble.

ally) rewarding career in August.
