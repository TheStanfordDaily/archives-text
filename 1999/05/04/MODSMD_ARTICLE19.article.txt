Hikers need to obey safety rules
Every day pedestrians on campus take
great risks walking around the Stanford cam
pus. Why is this? It is not the cars whizzing
through the Oval as it it were a racetrack; it
is not the scores of golf carts zipping by on
sidewalks: It is the students on bicycles who
cause such peril!
Stanford is a dream for those on fixit (and
on bikes) because it is Hat and there is not a
lot of vehicle access in the inner parts — but
because of this, the bicyclists take no steps
toward general safety of others and bicycle
laws. There is no such thing as a sidewalk or
a wheelchair ramp that is not used by multi
tudes of bikers — and they do it going the
wrong way! It would be semi-OK if they
would at least use the rules of keeping to the
right or left depending on if they are coming
or going (as a car would). But no ... it's a
free for all out there, and I can't believe there
haven't been some serious accidents.
Check out Lasuen Mall on a typical week
day around lunchtime — do you see the
elderly and the tourists barely able to make
it upstream? As an able-bodied person this is
hard enough, but take away those reflexes
and you are really at a loss. Stanford bikers,
for the most part, do not follow the laws of
cars when out there on the main roads either.
They cross at sidewalks, on the wrong side of
the street, never stopping at the stop signs.
Hey, 1 know it can be a hassle to stop the
momentum, but you've got to at least pause
to see what the traffic is doing! I can't tell you
how many times I've looked both ways
before proceeding across the intersection at
Canipus Drive and Bowdoin and all of a sud

den there's a bicyclist! It is amazing to me
that people just take so much for granted ...
how many of them are wearing helmets?
I don't know where the fault lies here but
it does seem the University does condone
such behavior: the sidewalks coming down
Palm Drive toward the Oval have bike lanes
on the street AND on the sidewalk (going
the wrong way!); I've never seen a ticket
being written out for a bicyclist and I can't
remember a day when I haven't seen some
tine doing something on a bike that just
makes me cringe.

Negotiation needed in Kosovo
As a campus resident during the Vietnam
War years, I was very much moved by Mar
jorie Cohn's recollection of the student anti
war movement in yesterday's Daily. Her
eloquent letter was a reminder of a period at
Stanford that was turbulent but also inspir
ing. Unlike many of their elders, students
were wise enough to recognize that what
their government was doing was morally
wrong and courageous enough to protest,
even at possible cost to their futures.
It seems both ironic and sad that as mem
bers of the April Third Movement hold their
30th reunion at Stanford this weekend, the
United States will again be laying waste to a
small and distant country, this time Serbia,
with an economy half the size of Idaho's.
Once again American bombing planes will
be leaving a string of craters a half-mile long
where there once were offices and factories

and apartment houses tilled with families.
This time the excuse is that we are acting
for humanitarian reasons, to save the ethnic
Albanian population of Kosovo. Hut the
bombing has not saved the life of a single
refugee. It has made their plight infinitely
worse. Before the NATO air strikes, the
Serbs were fighting to put down a guerrilla
army fighting for Kosovo's independence.
The tactics of the Serb army were ruthless
but no more so than the tactics used by
American forces in Indochina, the Turks
against the Kurds or the Indonesians in East
Timor. The forced exodus of hundreds of
thousands of Albanians from Kosovo began
only after the start of NATO bombing.
The fastest way to restore the refugees to
their homes and put an end to the daily
"accidents" that are causing thousands of
civilian casualties among both Serbs and
Albanians is for NATO leaders to stop issu
ing ultimatums and instead turn to negotia
tion. Serb President Slobodan Milosevic has
already agreed to restore autonomy to
Kosovo, to reduce Serb forces in the
province and allow the refugees to return
under the protection of U.N. monitors and
the International Red Cross. With a guaran
tee of continued Serb sovereignty over an
autonomous but not independent Kosovo,
Milosevic will have every reason to abide by
such an agreement. And the billions of dol
lars the United States intends to spend on
reducing another country to rubble can be
used instead for more constructive purposes
here at home.
