## Kosovo: yet another forgotten war abroad 
### 
NO BATTLE IS ever won. They are
not even fought. The field simply
reveals to man his own folly and
despair, and victory is an illusion of philoso
phers and fools."
While these words of William Faulkner
seem to have taken on new meaning in light
of the current bombing campaign in Kosovo,
they bring no comfort to the military strate
gists of NATO and the State Department
who struggle to bring this war (for lack of a
better word) to a quick and successful end.
The hot debate that has been raging in Wash
ington for the past few weeks concerns the
deployment of ground troops. Some believe
there is no other way to achieve a NATO vic
tory while others are averse to putting Amer
ican lives at risk for a cause that is not close
to American hearts.
Even as the discussion continues, with
presidential hopefuls — Arizona Sen. John
McCain. Elizabeth Dole and others — indi
cating their stances with vehemence and the
White House calling for "patience," the rest
of the country seems particularly uninterest
ed. The average American, still confused
about the Bosnian conflict, is facing a bit of

difficulty comprehending the Balkan crisis
and a lot more trouble trying to care about it.
The air attack, supported by a slender
though mystically ever-rising majority of
Americans, continues to roar as bombers
take out refineries, bridges, government
buildings and Serbian cities. During the first
couple of weeks, 300,000 Albanian refugees
tied Kosovo to seek refuge in neighboring
Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro. This
came in the face of a campaign that NATO
claims had dropped 230 grams of high explo
sives per head of every Yugoslavian. Military
experts have proclaimed that a war cannot
be won with aerial bombing alone. They
have cited the resilience of Churchill's Eng
land and the more recent Iraqi defiance to
prove their point. Two hundred thousand
troops will be needed, say NATO experts, to
defeat the Serbian forces and put an end to
the crisis.
The White House is understandably
reluctant to send young American soldiers to
fight a war their parents cannot understand.
One is reminded of former President Bush
leaning into the camera and declaring, in his
deliberate drawl. "This is not going to be

another Vietnam." as he sent young men to
fight in Iraq. He felt the heavy burden of
responsibility for the lives of the men he
commanded. It was a responsibility that post-
Vietnam America has come to demand from
its leadership. As the American leadership
weighs its sobering set of options in its benev
olent quest to provide safety and liberty to
the persecuted people of Kosovo, it encoun
ters an unresponsive silence from its people
and a lukewarm showcasing by the media.
At the end of the first couple of weeks of
bombing and a week after three American
soldiers were captured, polls showed U.S.
support for the bombing at a high of 54 per
cent. While the coverage of the soldiers in
captivity may have boosted home support for
the military action, the story disappeared
from the media after a short stint of four days
at the top news spot. The Lewinsky scandal
was a CNN headline story for 40 weeks in a
row during 1998. After featuring the Kosovo
crisis on their covers for two weeks. Time
and Newsweek have moved on to other
issues.
Newsweek's April 26 cover story was a
historical inquiry into the origins of human

life on the American continent, while the
cover of Time's U.S. edition featured the cast
from the new Star Wars movie. Wayne Gret
sky's retirement address had more Ameri
cans glued to the television than the images
of a Yugoslavia devastated by NATO bomb
ing. Nowhere in the United States has there
been a single notable rally or gathering either
for or against the military action. The bottom
line is most Americans simply don't care
much about the video-game war that has
been playing out for almost a month, despite
the noble intent of their government.
Nevertheless, the indifference of the guy
on the street towards this hellish conflict is
not completely inexplicable. Consider that
until a few weeks ago, most Americans only
knew of Albania from its part in the movie
"Wag the Dog." Consider that while the
White House continues its attempt to justify
and sell the purpose of this operation, most
major media outlets — CNN included —
recognize that their audiences would rather
hear about the latest medical "break
through" in cholesterol research than the
most recent refugee horror story from Alba
nia.

CNN, whose rise to the status of media
powerhouse is in large part a result of its in
depth coverage of Desert Storm, has not had
great ratings with the current conflict. This
could be because the packaging of
that war resulted in an unprecedented view
ing experience whereas the Kosovo conflict
makes like a bad sequel. The preoccupation
of the media with its ratings and the apathy
of the general public create a cycle, which
when coupled with the fact that Jerry
Springer has had some great shows recently,
help explain why Kosovo has remained a sec
ondary topic even for water-cooler chat.
Perhaps this is part of the great American
insouciance of this decade. Perhaps it is the
result of a flourishing economy that contin
ues to fatten an already complacent culture.
But then again, perhaps it is better this way.
Maybe it is good to be in a country where
heated overreaction is not the favorite emo
tional state of the people.
It doesn't seem to work for anyone else.
