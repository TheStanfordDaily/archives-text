## Senior Kribel named Pac-10 player of year 
### Ben Jones Contributing writer 
If Joel Kribel has a tro
phy room at the house,
it's about time to call a
contractor and get ready
for a renovation.
This week, the senior

and three-time Ail-American was named the
Pacific 10 Conference Flayer of the Year,
adding another piece of hardware from what
Tias been a stellar collegiate career.
Earlier this spring, Kribel was named the
recipient of the Dave Williams Award, given
annually for excellence in collegiate golf, aca
demies and community service.
Kribel, who placed second for the third
consecutive year in the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Seattle last week, has had an im
pressive run over this season with nine top-10
finishes and two tournament titles.
Stanford men's golf coach Wally Good
win, who has coached a number of break
through collegiate players including Tiger
Woods and Casey Martin, said Kribel was
"far and away the player of the year in the

conference."
"The vote was a unanimous decision
among the coaches," Goodwin said.
With a scoring average of 69.97 on the sea
son and up to three tournaments remaining,
Kribel threatens to break Tiger Woods
school mark of 70.90 established over the
1995-1996 season.
As Goodwin noted, "he's on his way to
breaking a record no one thought would be
broken."
Kribel's play has elevated him to the No. 1
national ranking in the Golf Week / Sagarin
poll, while he stands fifth in the MasterCard
Collegiate Golf Rankings.
In addition to his impressive collegiate ca
reer, Kribel has also made his mark as one of
the nation's best amateur golfers.
His play has earned him invitations to the
Masters and the U.S. Open Championship,
the nation's two most prestigious profession
al tournaments.
Other accolades include the individual
medalist trophy in the stroke play prelude to
the 1998 United States Golf Association Am
ateur Championship and a second-place fin
ish in the Northeast Amateur.
