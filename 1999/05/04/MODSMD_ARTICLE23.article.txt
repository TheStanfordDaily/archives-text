# O'Connor takes Card from obscurity to major contenders
## 
### Ben Jones contributing writer 
Think golf at Stanford. What
comes to mind? Tiger Woods. The
men's national title in 1994. Casey
Martin. It's about time to add the
women's team to that list.
In just four years under coach
Caroline O'Connor, the Stanford
women's golf team has gone from
relative national obscurity — over
shadowed hv a men's team ener
gized by a national title and the ar
rival of Woods — to a force to be
reckoned with on the West Coast.
That transformation was made
stunningly clear to the other schools
in the Pacific 10 Conference when
the ninth-ranked Cardinal captured
the conference tournament crown
with a 12-shot victory here on its
home course.
Punctuated by the win at the Pac
10s. the team's accomplishments
under O'Connor include 12 top
four finishes in the last 20 tourna
ments.
It all began with the 19%-1997
season, O'Connor's first as head
coach, when Stanford captured six
individual and team tournament ti
tles behind the All-American play
of seniors Mhairi McKay and An
drea Baxter.
That team placed fourth at the
NCAA Championships, matching
the school mark for the best finish in
the national tournament.
Despite playing three freshman
and two sophomores, the team con
tinued its strong play in the follow
ing season. Stanford finished in the
top 10 of all 11 events that season
and placed eighth in the NCAAs.
This season has been among the
strongest in recent memory for the
Cardinal.
After beginning slowly with a
12th-place finish in the season open
er. Stanford has posted top-10 fin
ishes in the last eight tournaments.
Behind the impressive of play of
| sophomore sensations Stephanie
Keever and Hilary Homeyer, the
Cardinal women have joined the
ranks of the nation's top teams.
One key to the team's success
has been the connection between
the young coach and her players,
which has helped develop a strong
bond among team members.
"I think Caroline has been a
good coach because she is so fresh
and young," said Homeyer. who led
the Cardinal with a second-place
finish at the Pac-lOs.
"It's fun to have someone close
to our own age so that we can relate
to her outside of golf as well.'

The bond between the coach, the
many younger players and the few
older members of the squad is evi
dent as the players share friendships
both on and off the course
"We all get along so well off the
course," Keever said, comparing
the Stanford squad to others across
the nation who do not share the
same camaraderie.
This spirit has helped propel the
Cardinal to a run of strong tourna
ment play over the course of the
spring.
O'Connor points to the Pac-lOs
as the pinnacle of the team's accom
plishments so far this season.
"We've spent the entire year
practicing to get to [that] point,"
O'Connor said. "Although we
haven't had quite the year that we
had last year, we knew that we were
fundamentally a better golf team
than a year ago this time."
For the coach and players it was
just a matter of waiting; they knew
that the strong play would come
eventually.
"We knew that if we remained
patient and truly believed that we
could win, good things would come
our way," O'Connor said, "And
they did.
"We had a very special opportu
nity at Pac-lOs this year, to win at
home, and we wanted to take ad
vantage of that situation."
What made the win even sweeter
was the overall team effort turned in
by all five players on the squad, a
consistency that had been missing
through the middle part of the year.
In previous tournaments the team
had had difficulty posting a series of
good scores throughout the five po
sitions.
"Every single player on our team
contributed to this win." O'Connor
said. "It was by far the best team ef
fort I've seen this year."
"I think we finally proved to our
selves and everyone else that we can
stand up to the pressure," Keever
said.
The win at Pac-lOs gives Stan
ford a great deal of momentum
heading into the final two events of
postseason play.
"We usually peak earlier in the
season than this," said senior Julie
Dunn, noting the unique opportuni
ty for the Cardinal to be playing its
best golf heading into the most cru
cial events.
Keever echoed Dunn's senti
ments about the team's prospects in
the upcoming regionals and NCAA
championships. " This win has given
us some great confidence going into
our final tournaments," she said.
