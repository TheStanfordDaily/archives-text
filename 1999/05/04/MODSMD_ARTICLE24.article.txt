# Ruggers repeat as champs

### Travis Neal Contributing writer 
There are few people who will ever have
the chance to raise a national championship
trophy above their heads as teammates sur
round them on all sides. For the Stanford
women's rugby team, the past two years
have seen two national championships, a re
defining of West Coast rugby and a gradu
ating class that took Stanford from nobod
ies to the toast of USA Rugby.
"I think that West Coast rugby has been
overlooked in the past," said senior Laurie
Kates. "It's been building up over the past
few years. With so many seniors on the team
[15], I think the cohesiveness of it all helped
us do so well."
The journey to this year's championship
was a three-year epic, a rocket ride that has
forced the Cardinal into the East Coast con
sciousness. In the spring of 1997, Stanford
(15-1-1) was in the Plate Division — USA
Rugby's version of a Division II — working
its way through the field until it lost to Mar
quette in the Final Four.
Last season saw the Cardinal on a tear
through the division in games that were rou
tinely over before they got under way. Stan
ford was throwing away teams like so much
garbage, the obvious ending coming with

Stanford's first national championship in a
35-5 dismantling of Illinois.
After such a decisive statement, USA
Rugby could do nothing but combine the
Plate and Cup divisions, giving Stanford a
chance at the "true" women's collegiate
championship. Undaunted, the Cardinal
ended its remarkable season by tying the
match with no time left on the board, before
landing a 43-31 overtime victory over the
Princeton Tigers.

"It's been an amazing progression," se
nior captain Sue Landsittel said. "This year,
to win it all — we were confident we could
play with the big dogs, but this was incredi
ble. We don't have as much competition on
the West Coast, and no one really gave us
credit. We were finally given a chance, and
we got their respect."
The victory was made all the more stun
ning when one considers that the Pacific
Coast Union — the league Stanford plays in
— was allowed only one berth to the Sweet
Sixteen. Although not as competitive as the
Midwest and Midatlantic leagues, the Car
dinal was faced with a growing crop of chal
lengers. However, Stanford made short

work of them all, remaining undefeated in
league play and taking out Oregon and
Chico State to earn a berth to the Sweet Six
teen.
Playing at Air Force in five feet of snow
and at an elevation that had many players
gasping for air, Stanford first took on and
disposed of Westchester, a team that was
fourth in the Midatlantic Region. The next
victim was Air Force, hut this victory took
last-second heroics, with a score in the cor
ner with no time remaining. Press releases
from the site called it"the best college rugby
game seen played yet," and it took the Car
dinal to Penn State for the Final Four.
On a sunny day that was more California
than it was Pennsylvania, the Cardinal faced
Navy after spending all Friday in transit.
With the field dry and the air warm, the con
ditions were perfcct for the Stanford backs,
allowing for some of the best executed plays
all season. Stanford scored first and never
looked back, keeping up its traditional run
and-gun play throughout the first half.
However, the lack of sleep and long trav
el caught up to the Cardinal in the second
half, with poor play rearing its ugly head on
both offense and defense. Stanford man
aged to hold Navy for much of the second
