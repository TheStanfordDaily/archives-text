The Stanford women's soccer
team avenged its regular-season loss
to California with a 1-0 victory Sun
day in Berkeley.
After losing 1-0 in overtime last
fall, the Cardinal capitalized on a
goal scored by junior Jen CTSullivan
to capture the spring season game.
"It was a great result for us yes
terday," Stanford head coach Steve
Swanson said.
The win is especially impressive
as it was only Stanford's second
game of the spring, while it was Cal's
last.
The pitch at Cal is notoriously
difficult to play on, as the turf is
rough and the dimensions smaller
than a typical field. Swanson ex
plained this created a more physical
game and challenged the players.
"I was really proud of the team as
they kept their discipline," Swanson
said. "I think we did some very good
things in terms of moving the ball
and creating some chances. We also
played very well in the back."

■ Today: Stanford vs. Japanese Na
tional team, 3 p.m., New Maloney
Field.

As is typical in spring games, the
Cardinal experimented with posi
tioning and giving reserves more
playing time than usual.
"In the spring games we are look
ing at a lot of people in a lot of dif
ferent roles," Swanson said. "We got
to look at some different things."
Today, the women face the
Japanese National team at New
Maloney field. Game time is 3 p.m.
Men's Soccer
Not many spring soccer games
around the country feature two
NCAA Final Four teams.
On Saturday, however, the Stan
ford men's soccer team faced the
Santa Clara Broncos, who last year
made it to the national semifinal
game.
In Virginia, the Broncos lost to
Indiana, which went on to beat the
Cardinal in the championship
match.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Saturday: Stanford 3, Santa Clara
2.

The two squads were coming at
Saturday's game from different po
sitions. Santa Clara was returning all
10 field players from its fall lineup,
starting only an inexperienced
goalie. The Cardinal, on the other
hand, graduated a core of six seniors.

But it was the Cardinal which
emerged victorious, 3-2.
"Because we lost [six] seniors, it is

going to take a few
games for us to be
come familiar with
our new roles,"
said sophomore
midfielder Scott
Leber. "But as a
team we are really
starting to create
our own identity."

Junior Andy Hemmerich agreed.
"It was a good win because we
had a lot of new people in new posi
tions. The main thing that we got out
of the game was a glimpse of the po
tential of some younger guys."
It was one of the less experienced
players, Leber, who put the Cardinal
on the board early in the first half.
Starting in the place of departed se

nior Simon Elliott. Leber is making
a statement thus far with two goals in
as many games this spring.
The play began as the Cardinal
brought the ball down the left side
and centered it to sophomore Corey
Woolfolk.
Woolfolk then dropped the ball
back to Leber who put it in the net.
Soon after, junior Gerard Davis put
Stanford up 2-0.
"The two early goals were very
important," Hemmerich said.
The 2-0 lead did not last long as
the Brpncos equalized on two penal
ty kicks. Committing two penalties
in the box exemplifies the area the
team needs to work on.
"We need to be more confident
in our one-on-one defending," said
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark.
"In many cases we gave up the ball
too easily and in many cases unnec

essarily."
Despite the defensive lapses,
Stanford regained the lead on a
penalty kick of its own. Freshman
forward Mike Murphy drew the foul
and redshirt junior midfielder T.K.
Inhody converted for the goal.
Stanford hung on for the dura
tion of the game and the victory.
"There were a lot of positives."
Clark said. "We played a little bit
better than the week before. We are
making progress and getting a pass
ing grade, but not by too much/'

Elliott was one of 22 players named
to the New Zealand National Team.
Elliott will travel with the team to
Mexico to participate in the Confed
erations Cup this summer. New Ze
land will face the United States,
Germany and Brazil in the first
round.
