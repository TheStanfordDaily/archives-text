# Stanford must come out strong in non-conference matchup
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Today would be a long day for
sixth-ranked Stanford no matter
what caliber of team it was facing.
Regardless, the Cardinal will
drive about five hours to Reno, warm
up, play the Nevada Wolfpack in an
afternoon contest at Peccole Park,
then drive five hours back.

BASEBALL
■ Tonight: No. 6 Stanford (33-12) at
No. 25 Nevada (32-14), 6 p.m.

However, the day — and especial
ly the ride back — could be even
longer for Stanford (33-12).
Nevada, which beat Stanford 7-4
at Sunken Diamond in early March,
is hotter than ever. The Wolfpack
(32-14) has ridden the hot hitting of
junior Don Price to an eight-game
winning streak and a No. 25 national
ranking.
Price, who has hit 16 home runs in
the last 15 games, is now batting .376
with 78 RBIs and a Big West Confer
ence-leading 22 home runs.
Stanford is not exactly cooling off
itself. The Cardinal, coming off of a
three-game sweep of Oregon State
which gave the team sole possession
of first place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, has now won six straight.
Additionally, Stanford has shown

a penchant for shutting down prodi
gious home-run hitters.
San Francisco sophomore Tag
ged Bozied came to Sunken Dia
mond leading t.u West Coast Con
ference in home runs but came away
empty. California sophomore Xavier
Nady, the Pac-10 home run leader,
was also kept within the yard by the
Cardinal staff.
Price may be more dangerous be
cause he has a better supporting cast,
at least statistically.
As a team the Wolfpack is hitting
.334, and six regulars are hitting
above .350.
Senior Lvle Overbav is especially
impressive. Overbav. who holds
eight Nevada offensive records and is
in the top 10 in 11 other categories, is
hitting .446 with 11 home runs and 71
RBIs.
The potent Wolfpack offense
could be even more productive, con
sidering it will probably be facing a
few Stanford relievers struggling to
re-find their effectiveness.
According to Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess, many relief pitchers
most of them struggling — will be
seeing action in this afternoon's game
and in the following four non-confer
cncc games leading into next week
end's conference-closing series with
UCI A.
"We've got some games to get
some innings from our pitchers and

find those two or three guys out of the
bullpen." he said. "We're set with our
starters."
Either freshman Mike Wodnieki
or sophomore Brad Drew will proba
bly start on the mound for the Cardi
nal as regular starting pitchers Jason
Young, Justin Wayne and Brian
Sager all saw considerable innings
over the weekend.
Wodnieki will again be using a
midweek game to work on his consis
tency. as he did without much success
last week against San Jose State. At
times he has been effective, but since
the USC series last month, he has
struggled and his ERA has ballooned
accordingly. Though the hard-throw
ing right-hander is 2-0. his ERA is
now 7.36.
Drew (1-3. 4.50 ERA) has not
struggled as much, but he has seen
even less action lately. While the left
hander began the season as the possi
ble third starter, he is now a seldom
used reliever.
The Stanford batters should also
count on seeing less than Nevada's
best (Mi the mound.
This could be especially helpful to
senior third baseman Josh Hochge
sang. His home run Sunday, his team
leading 12th of the year, pushed his
career total to 41, tying for third in
Stanford history with current major
leaguers Ed Sprague and David Mc-
Cartv.
