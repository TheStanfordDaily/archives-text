## Social debate through graffiti 
### Meredith Rowe Staff writer 
Members of the Stanford com
munity now have a new way to ex
press their beliefs and opinions about
diversity on campus.
"The Wall," a collaborative effort
of a group of ethnic communities,
provides the new outlet by allowing
people to write their responses to
questions about diversity at Stanford
on two boards set together in a trian
gular formation in White Plaza.

American Indian Program Office
has constructed the wall to facilitate
discussion about race and ethnicity.
"The purpose of the wall is to
open up dialogue on the Stanford
campus so that there is open discus
sion on race issues," said freshman
Misti Rodriguez, a member of Lead
ership 2(XM).
This discussion will begin with the
question "What does ethnicity mean
to you?" which is posted this week.
At the start of the second week,
this question will be replaced by
"How should ethnicity/diversity be
addressed at Stanford?" Those in
terested are encouraged to write
their answers on the wall with pro
vided paint, markers, and thumb
tacks.
Discussion over the results of the
first week will begin in the second

week. During the third week, there
will be discussion over the responses
to the first and second questions. The
group has yet to finalize a set struc
ture for these discussions but expects
one soon.
"Everyone on campus has some
thing potentially to contribute," se
nior Francisco Najera said. "Every
one has something to add to the dis
cussion on race."
Sophomore Chen Shu added that
the wall's purpose is also to call atten
tion to the many diverse groups with
voices at the University.
"We want to bring a focus to the
ethnic clubs on campus," she said.
"The wall will bring visibility to Stan
ford's diverse community."
Though it offers a free-speech
area for people to express their
thoughts, the wall should remain a
place where responders are consider
ate of the feelings of others, freshman
Bi Ade said.
" The emphasis is on open discus

sion," she said, "but people should try
to tactfully put up responses that help
the discussion, not hurt it."
According to the wall's pream
ble, which guides postings, the wall
"is not meant to offend anyone,
only to facilitate candid discourse
about issues of diversity and eth
nicity" and responses should be ex
pressed truthfully but mindful of
the responsibility that comes with
freedom of speech.
After the wall is taken down and
discussion has commenced, the
goal of Leadership 2(MH) is to con
tinue that discussion in various
dorms on campus, according to the
group. Members will work with the
Office of Residential Education
and Asst. Dean of Students
Tommy Woon, a multicultural ed
ucator, to accomplish this.
"We hope it's not just people writ
ing things on the wall," said junior
Shelley Tadaki, the chair of the Asian
American Students Association.

"We want people to come to dorm
discussions to spark more dialogue so
they can get out stuff that is normally
left unsaid.''
The precedent for Leadership
2(XX)'s wall was set ;it Duke Universi
ty by a policy concerning free-speech
expression on a campus bridge.
"There is a long-standing tradition
of allowing student organizations and
individuals to paint the East Campus
bridge," according to Janet Smith
Dickerson, vice president for student
affairs at I )uke. "The bridge is a place
where groups and individuals can ex
press opinions that are not restricted
by content, except by legal stan
dards."
Najera said the wall will be an
open forum for much-needed discus
sion.
"We hope the wall will raise
awareness about certain issues on
campus," he said. "Hopefully every
one will be talking about them at din
ner and in their dorms."
