It was all about the molecules re
cently when the American Chemi
cal Society, one of the world's
largest scientific societies, honored
Stanford chemists Douglas Skoog,
Richard Zare and Barry Trost for
their research efforts.
Skoog, a professor emeritus, was
honored with the 1999 Award in
Analytical Chemistry. For 35 years
he has contributed to education in
analytical chemistry, particularly
with his work in writing college
textbooks.
Skoog's textbooks "have made a
huge difference in the way chem
istry is taught in the United States,"
Chemistry Prof. John Brauman
said. "He has set a standard forclar

ity and ease of learning."
The textbooks, which have
reached more than one million stu
dents worldwide, have been trans
lated into Chinese, French, Ger
man. Russian and Serbo-Croatian,
as well as a number of other lan
guages.
Prof. Zare received the E. Bright
Wilson Award in spectroscopy, a
field that involves the use of laser
technology to reveal the details of
atomic and molecular structures.
Zare was recognized in particular
for the development of a special
kind of spectrometer that has im
proved the accuracy of spectral
measurement from a few hun
dredths of a percent to a few bil
lionths of a percent.
Brauman said Zare's work has

"definitely made a difference" in
the field of chemistry.
Prof. Trost accepted the Her
bert C. Brown Award for Creative
Research in Synthetic Methods.
His work, which was a collective ef
fort with the students who work
with him. involved designing new
techniques for making more so
phisticated pharmaceuticals, elec
tronic components and other prod
ucts.
"[Chemistry) shows how sub
stances can be used to serve human
needs," Trost said.
Trost emphasized the impor
tance of chemistry, calling it the
"crossroads" of science.
"We live in a fundamentally
molecular world," Trost said. "It is
important to understand this."
