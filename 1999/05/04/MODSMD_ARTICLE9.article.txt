# Festival celebrates diverse cultures
## 
### Khai Nguyen Contributing writer 
All this week, the beating of Ko
rean drums and rhythms of Polish
folk music will resonate through the
walls of the Bechtel International
Center as a part of the 19th annual
International Festival.
The festival, sponsored by the
center, began last weekend. It will
culminate Saturday with an after
noon of performances, including
American folk music, traditional
Mexican dances and Haitian-Cuban
"Gaga" dancing. All events are
open and free to the public.
During the week students may
attend an ongoing exhibit on Brazil
ian music and evening dance and
music performances. The after
noon lecture series will end on Fri
day with speaker Jose Gregori, win
ner of the 1998 IJ.N. Human Rights
Award.
Saturday students can also get
their taste of Ethiopian, Indonesian,
Mexican and Asian food.
The festival is a chance for
groups such as the Filipino Ameri
can Student Union, Hwimori,
Kumba, Hellenic Hawaii Club,
Stanford Tae Kwon Do and Ballet
Folklorico to educate students
about the different cultures present
on campus.

"Our purpose is to make people
aware that there is a rieh diversity of
people on campus and to allow the
international students to share their
experiences," said Assistant For
eign Student Adviser Lynn Kronos,
a coordinator of the festival.
The festival allows students to
"express pride of culture," said
Wanderley Liu, president of the
Brazilian Student Organization. Liu
is a doctoral student in engineering
economic systems and operations
research.
"When you're far away from
home and people don't know about
you and your culture, this is the best
way to share," said Watanee Sri
watanapontse, a civil and environ
mental engineering doctoral stu
dent and social chair of the Thai
American Intercultural Society. For
groups such as THAIS, the festival
is a once-a-year chance to be seen
by the large campus community, ac
cording to Sriwatanapontse.
The festival also brings people
together, Sriwatanapontse said. As
THAIS members organized Thai
dancing and kickboxing perfor
mances, they asked "American
friends" to join in the performances
and learn first-hand.
"Each culture expresses happi
ness through music and dance. It is a
wonder how many different ways

The International Festival is

Committee for International Stu
dents. Fund raising allows most of
the cost to be covered without bur
dening student groups.

John Pearson, organizer of pub
licity and fund raising for the festi
val, said he hopes that during the
festival "student groups | will J feel
excited about sharing their cultures
and the Stanford and local commu
nity will come and learn ... from

tion."
