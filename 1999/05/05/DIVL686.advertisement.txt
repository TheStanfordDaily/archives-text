Ahead of her time.
In 1910, she left Ohio for a career in
pictures. First she changed her name.
Then she set out to change Hollywood.
American Conservatory Theater,
in association with AT&T: OnStaee'. presents
THE FIRST PICTURE SHOW, a new
musical that traces the rise and fall of
the aptly named Anne First. A pioneer
in the early days of Hollywood, she
produced, directed and starred in a
series of silent films until the invention
of talking pictures — and the power of
censorship — drove her out of show
business. More than 70 years later, her
granddaughter, an aspiring filmmaker
herself, would make her the Hollywood
legend she was always meant to be.
Over the past decade, AT&T: OnStape has
sponsored more than 50 world premieres
of new plays or musicals'in the United
States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
AT&T is proud of our association with
American Conservatory Theater, and
joins with them in promoting the art
of communication in the communities
we serve.
