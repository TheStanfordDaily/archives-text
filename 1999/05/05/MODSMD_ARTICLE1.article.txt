# Rancor at ASSU
## Grads, undergrads face off over budget 
### Alice Brown Staff writer 
The ASSU voted last night to approve its operating
budget for 1999-2000 by a simple two-thirds majority.
The senate voted on the bill twice; the bill failed to pass
during the first vote, the vote was reconsidered and the
bill then passed 12 to 6, with one senator abstaining.
Disagreement over the bill was brought on by unequal
funding in the budget for the graduate and undergradu
ate senates.
Under the new budget, the GSC has more than twice
the discretionary funding of the Undergraduate Senate,
in addition to having almost $2,8(X) more in food for
meetings and $2,900 more for stipends.
Undergraduate Senator and Budget and Finance
Committee Chair Dave Searle, a senior and one of the
authors of the bill, introduced the bill to approve the op
erating budget into debate, despite the fact that he did not
want it to pass. He urged his peers to "join me in voting
down the budget so that the Budget and Finance com
mittee can go back to work with your help to encourage
that a future budget formation process won't be the final
phase of a divided ASSU."
He led the opposition to the budget, calling this year's
budget process "phase two of the unraveling of this asso
ciation." During the process he said he believed that the
GSC members repeatedly reminded him "of their supe
rior laundry list of successes that make the undergradu
ate dominated senate look worthless."
According to Searle, phase one of the "unraveling of
the [ASSU] was the acceptance of a loosely structured
GSC by this Senate and the students." He concluded that
"a house divided against itself cannot stand" and said
"parity is the ultimate answer for keeping us together."
Graduate Senator Dave Robinson disagreed with
Searle, saying the budget process "was not nearly as divi
sive as [Searle] made it seem." He added that "the GSC
needs more money, and the fact that the GSC has more
money [in the budget] illustrates the principle that we
should [allocate funds] based on what each group needs."
ASSU President Mike Levin, a sophomore, said, "I
don't see a grand conspiracy among graduate students.
We are hoping to reach absolute parity in a year or two
years."
Santos Marroquin, former ASSU Vice President, re
minded the senate that the GSC meets year-round, which
justifies the inequality in funding.
When the bill was first voted upon, there were 11 votes
in favor and seven votes opposed, with one abstention.
There was some question over whether or not this meant
the bill passed, but eventually Senate Chair Adam Weiss,
a junior, declared that the bill had not passed.
A motion to reconsider the vote passed, and this time
the bill passed.
In addition to approving the budget, the senate unan
imously certified the results of the recent election, which
officially inaugurated junior Mike Levin's year-long term
as ASSU president. He now has the power to veto the
ASSU budget.
At the beginning of the meeting Jewel Hudson, the
ASSU Legal Counseling office coordinator, announced
she will be retiring in June. Hudson has been at Stanford
since 1971.
