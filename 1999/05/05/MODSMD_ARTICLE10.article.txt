Khosla has received the most presti
gious award given by the National
Science Foundation for young re
searchers. The National Science
Board will honor him with the 1999
Alan T. Waterman Award at a cere
mony today in Washington, D.C.
The recipient of the award gets a
medal and a grant of $S(X).(XX) over
three years to put toward research in
any scientific field. To be eligible for
the award, scientists must be under
35 years of age.
His research "has captured the at
tention of the entire pharmaceutical
industry as an exciting new approach
for the production of new antimicro
brial agents from engineered organ
isms," said I9BK Waterman Award
winner and UC-Berkeley Chemistry
Prof. Peter Schultz. in a press release.
Khosla is recognized as producing
research on the forefront of discover

ing new drugs to fend off infections
and diseases. His work centers on mi
crobial enzymes that produce
polyketides, a group of compounds,
which are the source for a number of
drugs. Khosla has found a way for the
enzymes to produce new types of
polyketides that have never been
found in nature before.
His "creativity, productivity and
intellect are defining the forefront of
his field and opening a whole new op
portunity at the interface of chem
istry, biology and chemical engineer
ing," Schultz said.
The NSF has become familiar
with Khosla's name. He already per
forms his research from a current
NSF grant received from 1992 and
was named a NSF Young Investiga
tor in 1994.
"It's a wonderful and singular
event actually," Chemical Engineer
ing Prof. Charles Musgrave said. "It's
one of the best of the things that has
happened in this department in the
past decade."
