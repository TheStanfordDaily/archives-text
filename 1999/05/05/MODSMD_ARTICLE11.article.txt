## Willey testifies in Steele case Clinton 'forceful' 
### 
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) â€”
Former White House volunteer
Kathleen Willey testified yesterday
that President Clinton was "very
forceful" in an unwanted sexual
advance near the Oval Office in
1993.
"His hands were all over me,"
Willey said, testifying for the pros
ecution in the trial of her former
friend, Julie Hiatt Steele.
Recounting her version of an
incident she first described to the
nation in an interview on "60 Min
utes." Willey, in a soft but unwa
vering voice, said she told the pres
ident she desperately needed a
paid job at the White House
because of her family's financial
difficulties.
Clinton then took her to a galley
near the Oval Office and made his
advance, she said.
Willey said Clinton backed her
against a wall and "tried to kiss me.
He was very forceful. His hands
were all over me."
Clinton has denied Willev's alle
gation under oath.
Willey said Clinton kissed her
on the mouth, touched her breasts
and put his hands up her dress.
She testified at the trial of
Steele, who is charged with lying to
investigators to undercut Willev's
story.
Earlier today, prosecutors sum
moned one of Clinton's lawyers,
Mitch Ettinger. to describe his visit
to Steele in January 1998, while he
was working on the president's
defense in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit.
Under sometimes contentious
questioning, Ettinger said he
sought an affidavit from Steele but
never pressured her to sign it. He
insisted her affidavit wasn't crucial
to the president's defense.
Friends of Steele have testified
that she told them about the
alleged incident between Willev
and Clinton prior to Clinton
has denied any such incident.
Steele told investigators she first
heard the allegation against Clin
ton when Willey asked her to lie to
back up her story to a Newsweek

reporter.
Steele is charged with obstruc
tion of justice and giving false state
ments, accused of lying to FBI
agents and two grand juries in Ken
neth Starr's investigation of the
president.
Ettinger said Steele told him
that Willey had "asked her to fabri
cate a story regarding Clinton and
Willey to the effect that Clinton
had improperly made sexual
advances toward her."
The president's lawyers drafted
an affidavit saying that, but Steele
declined to sign it for a couple of
weeks. Ettinger said he didn't
know if anyone working for the
president pressed her to sign it. She
eventually did.
Prosecutors have argued that
Steele lied to ally herself with the
president; defense attorneys main
tain she is telling the truth.
Mary Highsmith, a witness who
said she had been Steele's best
friend, said, "Julie told me she was
afraid it was to her detriment if she
took a position against the presi
dent."
But Highsmith admitted tin
cross-examination today that she
had changed her story on a crucial
point involving Steele and remem
bered new information last
November that she hadn't recalled
in her first half-do/en interviews
with investigators.
Her new memory was that
Steele told her in November 1997
that she first heard Willev's story
about Clinton in 1994, the year
after it happened.
Highsmith said she forgot the
details after she "started a new life"
by moving to Colorado and it came
back to her after refreshing her
memory for the case.
Willey, who was expected to tes
tify today, savs she confided the
alleged Clinton advance to Steele
hours after it occurred.
The discrepancy is one factor
that made it impossible for Starr to
send an impeachment referral on
the Willey matter to the House last
year along with his referral on the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
