# 43 left dead by Oklahoma tornados

### 
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Rescue crews
looking for signs of life picked through shattered
homes, twisted trees and mangled cars yesterday
after a swarm of astonishingly powerful torna
does chewed up entire neighborhoods in Okla
homa and Kansas and killed at least 43 people.
Even in an area accustomed to tornadoes and
damaging thunderstorms — this is. after all. the
region known as Tornado Alley — the twisters'
wrath was extraordinary.
One monstrous funnel cloud skipped across
the ground for four hours and was classified F-5,
the most powerful tornado there is. with winds of
more than 260 mph. It cut a path one mile wide
and tore up 60 miles of the flat countryside.
"This is crazy." said Eric Peterson of
Haysville, Kan., a suburb of Wichita, after a
twister pushed a tree into his bedroom. "I have
been in typhoons in the South Pacific and in hur
ricanes. but this tops it."
The death toll was 3<S in Oklahoma and five in
Kansas, making this the nation's deadliest torna
do outbreak since 42 people were killed last year
in Florida. It was also the deadliest such tragedy
to hit Oklahoma since April 9, 1947, when a
twister killed 113 people in Woodward.
Hundreds were injured, including 500 in
Oklahoma City and more than 100 in Wichita,
Kan. At least 1,500 businesses and homes were
destroyed or heavily damaged.
Cars were tossed across highways and crushed
like soda cans. 1 louses were smashed into piles of
timbers and brick. The ground was scoured bare
in places, stripped of trees. The air smelled like
sawdust. Baby pictures floated down the streets
in storm water.
Jon Hansen, an assistant fire chief in Okla
homa City, likened the scene to that of the Okla
homa bombing in 1995: "It looks like the Murrah
Building, but instead of nine stories tall, it's
spread out over a large area."
Officials said the death toll could have been
worse if people had not heeded warnings to take
cover underground.
Local TV stations went live with coverage of
the developing storm at least two hours before it
hit the heavily populated Oklahoma ( ity area.
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating estimated
that hundreds of millions of dollars of damage
was done.
He mobilized the National Guard to help with
the rescue, and tanks joined police and fire vehi
cles in blocking streets where the heaviest
destruction occurred.
Rescuers conducted two preliminary searches
for victims, then brought in bulldozers to clear
away heavy debris in a third search during the
afternoon. At least one woman was found alive
in a trailer park.
Wendy Knapp, a Red Cross volunteer at an

evacuation shelter in Newcastle, said she was
taking her son to T-hall practice Monday after
noon hut turned around when a funnel cloud
came into view.
"I've been in several of them in my lifetime.
Hut this was a big one." she said. " This did more
damage than I've ever seen in my life. There are
dead cattle in people's yards, trees, debris. Grass
was ripped up. At some homes, the foundations
were ripped up."
Christy Smith was visiting her grandparents
when a tornado tore through her neighborhood
in Midwest City, just outside Oklahoma City.
She spent yesterday rummaging through the

remains of what once was her home.
"When we got here, I could only tell it was our
house because of the bushes," she said.
Lisa Poahty was still in shock as she looked at
her neighbor's car, which had been hurled into
her living room. Her son's mattress was in a tree,
and the family car was 100 yards awav in a neigh
bor's yard.
Officials estimated the tornadoes traveled as
much as ( S0 miles after forming 45 miles south of
Oklahoma City on Monday afternoon.
President Clinton declared disaster areas in 11
Oklahoma counties and one Kansas county and
plans to tour the devastation this weekend.
