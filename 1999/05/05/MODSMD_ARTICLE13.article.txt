Clinton supports Palestinians' aspirations
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hie target date for an overall accord between
Israel and the Palestinians passed yesterday with President Clinton encour
aging Yasser Arafat's aspirations for his "own land."
In a letter to the Palestinian leader, Clinton declared the Palestinians had
a right to "determine their own future on their own land."
While Clinton made a similar statement in Gaza hist December and has
not explicitly called for a state, his letter to Arafat was bound to boost Pales
tinian hopes for U.S. support on that goal.
Clinton praised Arafat for engaging in what he called "a serious effort to
fight terror" and said the Palestinians deserved "to live free, today, tomor
row and forever."
The State Department, in a subdued statement, called on the two sides
to rebuild "a relationship of trust."
With Israel headed for elections in two weeks and the two sides quarrel
ing over the interim West Bank agreement they reached last October, the
Clinton administration gave up any realistic hope of a settlement long ago.
But in a statement, the administration offered advice and also an admo
nition that unilateral steps would not bring peace.

Police officers on trial for brutality

charges yesterday in the case of Abner Louinia, a I laitian immigrant inves
tigators say was sexually brutalized in a stationhouse bathroom.
The 1997 case, along with this year's police shooting of an unarmed
African immigrant, has strained relations between the Police Department
and the black community.
In opening statements, federal prosecutor Kenneth Thompson
described in graphic detail how the defendants supposedly battered a hand
cuffed Louima inside a patrol car and then sodomized him in a bloody
assault in a precinct bathroom in Brooklyn.
Officer Justin Volpe, 27. and three other officers are charged with
assaulting Louima outside the precinct. And Volpe and Officer Charles
Schwarz are charged in the attack inside the precinct bathroom, where
Volpe allegedly stuck a broomstick into Louima s rectum and then jammed
it into his mouth. A fifth officer is charged with covering up the attack.
Louima was hospitalized with severe internal injuries that included a
ruptured bladder and colon, prompting widespread demonstrations against
police brutality in the city.

observer.
Every other coin in use — the penny with Abraham Lincoln, the nickel
with Thomas Jefferson, the dime with Franklin Roosevelt and the quarter
with George Washington — shows the subject in profile.
The coin itself will be gold-colored and will have smooth edges in order
for it to be easily distinguished from the similarly sized quarter.
