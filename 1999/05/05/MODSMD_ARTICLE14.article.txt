With small number of
applicants, college seems
of to a shaky start

THE DEADLINE TO request
special priorities for this year's
Draw has come and gone, and
the results don't look good for the new
Freshman / Sophomore College.
Ninety freshmen requested first or
second priority for the college, a num
ber equal to the amount of spaces
reserved for sophomores next year.
Sixty students agreed to list it as their
first choice in the Draw, qualifying
them for priority one.
Administrators in charge of the pro
gram are encouraged by these num
bers. But should they be? If anything,
the turnout is proof that the college, in
its inaugural year, won't be entirely
filled by students willing to go through
an application process.
Ihe reality of the Draw is that not
everyone who requests a priority in a
residence goes on to live there. In the
case of the college, 90 students with
priority won't translate to 90 residents.
Ilie rest of the students in the college
will come in through the Draw, and
they will likely be sophomores with
marginal preferred numbers, looking
for a way to escape living in Wilbur
Hall.
Even among the priority students
there is at least a small sentiment of
using the college only as a backup plan
for the Draw.
When the college was unveiled in
February, we denounced it as poorly
located and lacking detail in its aca
demic components. Since then, admin
istrators have done little to shore up
those details, announcing only a speak
ing program.
Iliev have also drawn heat from stu
dents and ASSI) leaders who believe
the college's Sterling Quad location
isolates underclassmen and forces

juniors and seniors — Sterling Quad's
traditional residents — into less desir
able one-room doubles elsewhere on
campus.
The low number of students
requesting priority only reinforces
these concerns. Many freshmen quot
ed in The Daily yesterday cited the col
lege's placement away from the center
of campus as a large drawback to living
there.
Most importantly, by not announc
ing more details of its academic pro
gramming, administrators failed to
present a compelling reason for next
year's sophomores to become testers
in a pilot program.
The fact that academic theme
dorms such as Castano and EAST
House typically draw unpreferred for
students with priority is evidence that,
outside of the Program in Structured
Liberal Education, Stanford students
do not for the most part inherently
equate living with learning. When
choosing residences, students heavily
weigh location, facilities, food and
proximity to friends. They don't spend
a lot of time thinking about academic
programs.
The Freshman / Sophomore college
is ostensibly a step toward changing
this. However, the program will have a
difficult time winning over students if a
significant portion of its residents drew
into the college simply to avoid living
in Stern Hall.
Administrators should realize this if
they hope to save their program from
dying before it is born. Students living
in the college next year — freshman or
sophomore, priority or not — should
receive mailings this summer detailing
how the academic environment will be
structured and how it will differ from a
typical Stanford dormitory. Extra
emphasis should be placed on orienta
tion and winning over those students
who drew there as a backup.
Otherwise, the college has little
chance of achieving its goals.
