## Befriending the 'rents

I CAN'T remember the
last time I heard a rid
dle. Countless a cap
pella songs and unrepeat
able jokes and the piercing
scream of a CoHo cashier
(Greg! Kalifornia Bowl
for Greg!) protrude from

my mental landscape with unbearable clari
ty, but to entice one singular riddle out of
hiding takes more than a little coaxing. So
after several excruciating hours, two Domi
no's pizzas and a swat team, I present to you
The Classic Kiddle. Remember this one?
What walks on four legs in the morning,
two legs in the afternoon and three legs in
the evening?
It the answer doesn't immediately pop to
mind, it may be because it's been such a
long time. For the most part, aside from
board games for drastically uncreative party
throwers, riddles are relegated to the sphere
of childhood. At about the same time of
your life that you fall for "it's snowing out
side!" every April Fool's Day in Northern
California, you're told the answer to this
question about a morphaplegic creature.
What is it?
A man. At the dawn of his life, a child
crawls t)n all fours. He stands on two legs in
the middle of his life and uses a cane as the
years descend into twilight.
It's clever, an exercise in abstract think
ing for the young and an amusement for
adults who watch children bite a deter
mined lip trying to wrap their minds around
the problem. Hut deeper than that, the
Great Anonymous Propagator of Riddles
seemed to be trying to teach us children a
lesson about what we were about to
encounter — that life travels through a

cycle. We already knew how this lifelong
day began, something to do with a stork or
an alternative form of pregnancy known as
in-gastro. And we knew the day would end
in the nebulous concept called death. Now
we knew that Growing, Doing and With
drawing would mark the passage in
between.
Having been briefed with these basics
years ago, the college-age student is now
pre-programmed to realize that not only
does life have a cycle but that cycles sync up
in a peculiar way. Just as we begin to exit
the long, tormented search for purpose and
meaning, just as we solidify a sense of our
selves and our ideologies, just as the awk
ward and gangly disruption that was late
adolescence subsides into self-assured
adulthood, our parents approach the portal
of transition. We realized we were getting
older, and they realized they were getting
Old. We have just started running on two
legs, and they are uneasily adopting a third.
That the parents of college students
begin to consider what late mid-life means
for them may be a result of their children;
parents see us assuming the roles they had
and wonder where they're supposed to fit in
as the next generation steps up. The nine
legged riddle gives way to a bedtime story,
instead. Once upon a time, parents took
care of their children. Once upon a time,
parents ventured into the world and taught
their children what they discovered. Once
upon a time, parents had experience and
earning power and knowledge about cultur
al norms. Now that the children have
grown, they are the experts on technology
and social practices. They have had new
experiences like college or Wall Street or
choosing a career in the modern market.

They are the ones outgrowing four limbs
and striving ahead. Onee upon a time, par
ents always knew best, but that was a long,
long time ago. Good night.
Before the role swapping is complete, we
come to equilibrium with our parents.
Strangely, while hall of us grow up and the
other hall' grow down, it looks like we are
becoming... friends?
Before this life cycle threshold, parent
child friendship was inhibited as a matter of
practicality. Friends share vulnerabilities,
mistakes, perceptions and secrets — what
parents and children could not hope to
divulge without censor. Parents were rules,
not people with flaws. Parents were unified
fronts presenting A Way To Live, not indi
viduals confessing their mistakes or their
sadnesses. Children were economists bar
gaining for privileges, not buddies confess
ing the Whole Truth.
But now. oddly, friendship emerges. As
children relinquish their dependent status
and parents stop trying to mold them into
particular individuals, the earmarks of
friendship are clear. Finally the rough sketch
of the people who are your parents can be
tilled in with frank discussions of the way that
they approached life, cried after their first
lover or cheated on an exam. Finally, you can
reveal the self that pivots on your thoughts
about the formerly prohibited.
Riddles can be construed into life
lessons, but so tar no one has turned this les
son into clever prose. Your parents carried
you once and you'll carry them later. But
somewhere in between, a familial friendship
eases your changing stride.
