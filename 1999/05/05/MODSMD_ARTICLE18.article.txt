Review crossword ignorant
One of the most influential reasons in
my decision to come to Stanford Univer
sity (besides the obvious: academic repu
tation and nice weather) is the Universi
ty's commitment to diversity and the stu
dent body's celebration of difference.
Before I visited the campus and even
belore I seriously considered applying to
Stanford, my preconceived notions about
the type of students who attend this
school were centered around the idea that
the student body was composed of elitists.
These unsubstantiated ideas of mine were
quickly obliterated when 1 visited for the
first time and was able to tour El Centro
Chicano and converse with students who
demonstrated the irony of my assump
tions.
The sickening feeling that I felt prior to
visiting Stanford and thinking about a
school where people are consumed in
their ethnocentricity or blinded by their
homophobia or ignorant about the value
of cultural heritage revisited me when I
saw the crossword puzzle in the last issue
of The Stanford Review.
I guess I must have been naive to
believe for just one second that Stanford
is without any of these attributes. The
anger that I felt over the ignorance of the
puzzle came secondary to the disappoint

merit (hat overwhelmed me when I saw
this blatant disregard for and diminution
of attempts at making positive social
changes.
What struck me with an even greater
blow of incredulity was when 1 saw this
paper with the name of "my" University
in the title. The mission to combat igno
rance with education is a life-long struggle
that has come a long way, though there
remains progress to be made. Being raised
by parents who always emphasized the
benefits of optimism, I will look at this
crossword puzzle as a reminder that our
mission is not over.

Questioning unjust wars
Marjorie Cohn is to be commended for
working in the April Third Movement.
It is right and good to raise awareness of
the horrors of war and to question author
ity.
But Cohn might do well to compare
notes with those who were left behind
when the U.S. pulled out of Vietnam. The
father of a friend of mine, for example,
was imprisoned and tortured for 15 years
simply because he was a physician. His
children didn't fare much better.

Anti-war protesters in the United
States faced tear gas and batons. Those in
postwar Vietnam who "questioned
authority" were simply executed.
We have unprecedented freedom to
protest war here, precisely because others
are willing to fight wars to defend that
freedom.
Let us do everything we can to seek
peace and to end unjust and oppressive
wars â€” especially those of a "wagging"
president. But "peace is more than the
absence of war, it is the presence of jus
tice," and justice sometimes requires a
strong hand.

Cowardice in Kosovo
Tolstoy, in War and Peace, describes
the futility of Napoleonic military savvy
against the earthy genius of Kutuzov and
the inspiration of Holy Mother Russia.
The Slavic soul knows the power of fail
ure, psychic death and resurrection. This
is the major theme of both Tolstoy and
Dostoevsky.
It is also the founding myth of Serbia
(the 14th-century defeat in Kosovo at the
hands of the Turks).
Germanic organizational sophistication

under Hitler foundered on the same spiri
tual rock. When Stalin abandoned his
wooden Communist slogans and invoked
Holy Mother Russia, the Russian army
performed miracles at Stalingrad.
Along comes President Clinton (with a
similar gaggle of European satraps) aim
ing at imposing a pretentious scheme, a
Western social-engineering order, on
recalcitrant Serbs and Albanians who
have insisted on hating each other and
fighting for centuries.
He has educated generals and unprece
dented weaponry, but nothing like the
battle-tried guts of his predecessors. He
refuses even to muddy the boots of his
ground troops.
There was a certain grandeur in the dis
aster of the Napoleonic and Hitlerian
warriors. Our own looming debacle, shin
ing on our TV screens as we eat potato
chips, smacks of farce and decadence. The
whole shaky card castle of high tech, low
morale armies and the shallow liberal
belief in "progress" is about to collapse
before our lusterless eyes.
Bombing on Easter Sunday, while the
death and Resurrection of Christ was
being celebrated, symbolizes the whole
sorry train of millennium-closing events, a
bang to be followed by a whimper.
