BERKELEY â€” Five Stanford students were
among S3 individuals arrested early yesterday morn
ing at UC-Berkley because of their participation in
an ongoing protest against cutbacks in the Ethnic
Studies Department.
The group was held overnight in Alameda Coun
ty Jail.
At approximately 3:30 a.m. Tuesday, according to
the UC-Berkeley Campus Police, 70 officers from var
ious I) niversity of California schools closed off the area
surrounding California Hall, where the Chancellor's
Office is located, and asked protesters to disperse. Pro
testers were charged with violation of the California
law against illegal lodging, a misdemeanor. The stu
dents had set up tents in the area.
"I am both sad and angry that the legitimate issues
affecting the future of the Department of Ethnic
Studies had to result in the mass arrest and detention
of [student protesters] early this morning," said Prof.
Ling-chi Wang, chair of the UC-Berkeley Depart
ment of Ethnic Studies.
