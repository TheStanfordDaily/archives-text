### Lauren Phillips Kelly Young Senior staff writers 
BERKELEY — Five Stanford students were
among S3 individuals arrested early yesterday morn
ing at UC-Berkley because of their participation in
an ongoing protest against cutbacks in the Ethnic
Studies Department.
The group was held overnight in Alameda Coun
ty Jail.
At approximately 3:30 a.m. Tuesday, according to
the UC-Berkeley Campus Police, 70 officers from var
ious I) niversity of California schools closed off the area
surrounding California Hall, where the Chancellor's
Office is located, and asked protesters to disperse. Pro
testers were charged with violation of the California
law against illegal lodging, a misdemeanor. The stu
dents had set up tents in the area.
"I am both sad and angry that the legitimate issues
affecting the future of the Department of Ethnic
Studies had to result in the mass arrest and detention
of [student protesters] early this morning," said Prof.
Ling-chi Wang, chair of the UC-Berkeley Depart
ment of Ethnic Studies.
Negotiations
Six students began a hunger
strike last Thursday to protest what
they called the gradual elimination
of the department. In response UC-
Berkeley administrators, faculty and
students held negotiations over the
weekend to find a solution accept
able to all parties. The administra
tion and department faculty reached
an agreement late Sunday night; stu
dents then requested until noon yes
terday to consider the agreement.
The students were unable to ac
cept the agreement by the deadline
and continued their hunger strike
and peaceful protest.
"I don't think we had a sufficient
amount of time to look through [the
agreement]," UC-Berkeley student
David Leonard told the Daily Cali

fornian. "We wanted to sit down and
discuss what actually was being of
fered."
"When students experience
dwindling faculty and thinning cur
ricula ... they know the department
is dying a slow death," Wang said.
"The students did what they felt was
necessary to call [UC-Berkeley
Chancellor Robert Berdahlj's atten
tion to these problems."
Students arrested
Police wearing full riot gear
moved in early yesterday morning
and arrested those who refused to
leave.
After negotiations broke down,
"there was an understanding that
something was going to happen in
response to the protest," Director of
UC-Berkeley Media Relations
Jesus Mena said. "The police had to
be prepared for all eventualities."
Most of the students went with

the police voluntarily. Others went
limp and were dragged or carried
away. Police took protesters away in
two vans and two buses.
According to San Francisco State
student Ashley Krey, who witnessed
the event, protesters lay in front of
the first bus to prevent it from leav
ing.
UC-Berkeley students who re
sisted arrest may face "exclusion
from the campus for up to 14 days,"
according to a UC-Berkeley press
release.
Capt. Bill Cooper of the UC-
Berkeley Campus Police said the de
cision to arrest the students at 3:30
a.m., while no non-protesters were
present, was a joint decision by the
administration and the police.
"The time was chosen so as not to
disrupt the central part of the cam
pus," Cooper said. "Officers have
continued patrolling that area since
the time of the arrests."

Yesterday's rally
In response to the arrests, about
30 Stanford students participated in
a rally in Berkeley yesterday at 5
p.m. About S(X) people gathered on
a lawn for a rally that was initially
scheduled to focus on Asian-Ameri
can ethnic studies but turned into a
sound-off against the arrests.
The six hunger strikers returned
to the protests, five of them after
their release from jail, in order to
join the rally. They are continuing
their hunger strike, which is now in
its sixth day.
The protest, organized by the
Third World Liberation Front,
began in response to cuts in the eth
nic studies faculty and curricula.
Two students held a sign that
read "Stanford Supports TWLF,"
which was eventually hung on the
wall of the building.
The hunger strikers spent most of
yesterday resting, alleging that they

were denied water in jail. They re
turned to the rally after hearing the
numbers that had come to support
them.
Organizers passed out yellow
arm bands reading "TWLF" and en
couraged people to sleep out again.
Berdahl released a statement yes
terday reading, "The allocation of
resources within the university is not
subject to negotiation in the street. It
is and must be a part of a reasoned
process. I will not allow coercion, in
timidation and threat of violence to
replace this reasoned process."
The protesters reacted strongly
to the chancellor's response. At one
point during yesterday's rally, stu
dents shouted at the office, "Come
on out!" Another speaker put in a
call to the Chancellor's Office and
held the cellular phone up to the
crowd to lead them in a chant of
"What do we want? Ethnic studies.
When do we want it? Now."

Reaching an agreement
Mena said UC-Berkeley was sur
prised the student protesters did not
give the university a response by
noon on Monday. The protesters set
the deadline extension themselves.
"This administration is extreme
ly committed to its Ethnic Studies
Department," Mena said. "Chan
cellor Berdhal has spent a great
deal of time negotiating with the
faculty of the Ethnic Studies De
partment."
The UC-Berkeley administration
has said it can do no more to accom
modate the demands of the students.
"We're hopeful that the students
will stop their hunger strike," Mena
said. "We are worried about their
health."

students were present at the
protests as individuals on their own
accord.
