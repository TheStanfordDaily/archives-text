II S HOT. I HAT'S the first thing you
notice after you get over the fact that a
perfect stranger has just patted your
entire body to search for weapons. You are
pushed into the prison, and the iron door is
shut behind you. Men crowd around the
doorway â€” a barred outlet to a freer world.
It's hot; a dry. dusty, still heat that seeps
under your clothes and into your skin and
your lungs. Everywhere, men are sitting in
groups around shaky plywood tables or
leaning against the wall, arms crossed,
watching. Many of these men are friendly
and lonely, and you find yourself making
promises you don't know how to keep.
Then you leave. And you don't want to
admit it. but the air outside seems sweeter.
Iresher than the air that recycles off the con
crete walls inside. You leave. And maybe,
just maybe, it strikes you that they do not.
It's hot. That's the first thing you notice as
you crowd into the stadium, ready, finally, to
stumble and float through a Sunday in June
that supposedly marks a new epoch in your
life. Someday if will be a memory, but right
now it is a chaotic ceremony and a sea of
black acrylic caps and gowns. Maybe you

take pictures or jot down addresses and
phone numbers for later. Hut now. in the
black acrylic caps and gowns, now it is sim
ply hot.
The connection between these scenarios
is not that Stanford University is a prison,
not that graduation is stilling. It is not really
even about heat. The connection is much
more straightforward. The connection is
Jostens.
That the corporation responsible for class
rings, yearbooks and graduation apparel is
also a major employer of prison labor is both
ironic and reflective of deep social priorities.
Jostens Inc. is the largest manufacturer of
graduation gowns in the United States. It
has 43 offices and manufacturing plants
throughout this country, Mexico and the
Caribbean. Jostens' main gown-production
factory is in South Carolina, 25 miles from
the Leath Correctional Facility, a 350-bed
prison for women.
The Stanford Bookstore says it commis
sions Herff-Jones. not Jostens, to rent grad
uation apparel. But, of course, Jostens is not
the only major corporation contracting
prison labor to suit our consumption pat

terns. Prisoners create our license plates and
road signs. They produce uniforms for
McDonald's, jeans lor k-Mart and J.C. Pen
ney. toys for Eddie Bauer. They stuff the
mattresses we sleep on. thes sand the furni
ture we sit on. they weld our car parts. 1 hev
even take credit card ticket orders for TWA.
Prison labor has many perks. Private
employeis hiring state prison inmates can
avoid health care costs. I hey can put "Made
in the IJSA" labels on prison-made apparel.
They can "econonii/e" on labor costs. (As of
IIWS.l l W5. federal inmates were paid $0.23 to
$1.15 an hour.) F sen more appealing, the
government gives mandators preference to
goods made by federal prison industries.
Proponents (often employers) of prison
labor claim that prisoners build self-confi
dence and learn useful life skills. "Every
body wins." they say.
Opponents call it legally sanctioned slav
ery.
Our nation's federal prisons are danger
ous. abusive and overcrosvded. Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch
have thoroughly documented systematic use
of physical torture (beatings, chemical

sprays, electroshock devices) as well as psy
chological torture (long-term isolation, win
dowless cells, verbal abuse.) More general
abuses, such as inadequate health care,
exposure to communicable diseases and
filthy, vermin-infested quarters are intrinsic
qualities of U.S. prison life.
The use of prison labor is but one more
manifestation of blatant human rights abus
es. Because prisoners are generally por
trayed (and thus conceived of) as evil, the
violation of their human rights goes unques
tioned and is even cheered on. However,
even as criminal justice policies increase the
length of prison sentences and reduce the
possibility of parole, 53 percent of all state
inmates are incarcerated for nonviolent
crimes.
The United States imprisons a greater
percentage of its population than any other
countries except Russia and Rsvanda: more
than 1.7 million people were either in prison
or in jail in 1998. The incarceration rate of
more than 645 prisoners per KK).(KX) resi
dents is double what it was a decade ago. Of
these prisoners, more than 60 percent are
from racial or ethnic minorities.

How can we dissect these statistics?
There are not more had people in the Unit
ed States than in the rest of the world. But
more than 25 states have recently allowed
private corporations to take over state pris
ons and contract the labor therein.
There are not twice as many criminals
today as there were a decade ago. But in an
epoch of international sweatshopping. there
are more contracts meted out to prison
industries.
Ethnic and racial minorities are not dis
proportionately evil. But the chain gang is
hack.
The burgeoning number of inmates in
U.S. prisons and the gross misallocation of
their lives and labors is attributable to deep
economic and social failures. It is also
attributable to a conscientious corporate and
governmental agenda.
In the hot sunshine and black acrylic of
June 13, it is worth remembering.
There's a reason thev cannot leave.
