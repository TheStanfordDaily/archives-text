## Heart disease threatens minority children Ethnic backgrounds alter risk factor levels 
### Gargi Talukder 
Stanford researchers have conducted a study
of more than 7,600 children and young adults to
show that risk factors which promote cardio
vascular disease, such as high blood pressure,
physical inactivity and diabetes, are more
prevalent among black and Chicano children
than among white children.
Heart disease has long been known to have
a higher incidence among minority groups. For
example, blacks 45 to 64 years old are twice as
likely to die from heart disease than their white
counterparts.
Marilyn Winkleby, senior research scientist
at the Stanford Center for Research in Disease
Prevention, and her colleagues have shown that
risk factors for heart disease begin to manifest
earl\ in childhood, and that black and Chicano
children tend to acquire more of these risk fac
tors than white children.
"Out results highlight the need to start inter
ventions for healthy lifestyles at early ages,"
Winkleby said. "Interventions should begin as
early as kindergarten."
The study, published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association on March 17,
was based on data obtained from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey. I his survey was conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics, which
combined questionnaires and medical examina
tions to gather data on the health, diet, demog
raphy and economic status of a representative
sample ol nearly 34.000 Americans.
Winkleby's group used the data from this
survey to analyze information for 2.769 blacks,
2.<554 Chicanos, and 2.063 whites between the
ages of 6 and 24. Thev studied the prevalence

of six different risk factors: the proportion of
fat in the diet, body weight, blood pressure,
cigarette smoking, glycosylated hemoglobin (an
early sign of diabetes) and blood cholesterol.
A particular strength of this study, the
researchers said, was that the members of the
three ethnic groups were drawn from a range of
socioeconomic classes. This avoided the flaw of
some previous studies, which had focused on
minorities from poorer or less educated fami
lies.
The results of the study suggest that risk fac
tors for heart disease occur at different rates
among the three ethnic groups regardless of
socioeconomic status.
Differences in risk factors were evident
from the youngest age groups all the way
through adulthood.
Even in the youngest age group — 6 to 9
years — black and Chicana girls were more
likely to be overweight and to show early signs
of diabetes than white girls.
This trend continued through older age
groups. Black and Chicana girls obtained a
higher percentage of their energy from fat and
tended to have higher blood pressure than
white girls.
Black and Chicano boys were at higher risk
of diabetes than white boys, and black boys had
higher fat intake than white boys.
The study did not attribute the differences in
risk factors among the ethnic groups to any spe
cific cause, such as genetics, behaviors or atti
tudes.
Winkleby said that focusing solely on genet
ic causes would be a mistake. Even if one eth
nic group has a genetic factor that makes it
prone to heart disease, it is usually an
unhealthy lifestyle which allows that factor to

become manifest.
"We don't have methods to change genes,
hut we do know how to change lifestyles," Win
kleby said. "And we know how to promote and
maintain healthy behaviors."
Winkleby noted that one particular risk fac
tor — smoking — was more prevalent among
whites from lower socioeconomic status than
for either of the two minority groups. She sug
gests that this statistic is particularly alarming,
since current smoking intervention plans focus
on minority groups and tend to not take socioe
conomic status into account.
Winkleby and her colleagues recommend
that heart-healthy behaviors be promoted to
young children, and they note these early inter
ventions should focus on both awareness and
on access.
Children, parents and health care profes
sionals should know heart disease is the leading
cause of death for all Americans, and that there
are specific behaviors that can reduce the risk
of heart disease.
To be successful, these campaigns should
take the diversity among American children
into account and thus should be tailored for the
different cultures, languages and lifestyles pre
sent in the population. Children also need
access to healthy environments, including
healthy food choices in schools and in places
where children play.
As an example, Winkleby explained. "We
shouldn't go to a snack bar at a baseball field
and only find nachos, french fries, potato chips,
hot dogs and ice cream."
The researchers emphasize that preventative
interventions must be placed in social contexts,
because societal forces can direct healthy
lifestyles.
