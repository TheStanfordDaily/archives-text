# Bug uncovers sunblock's 'Super Powerful Formula'
## 
### Garth Patil Contributing writer 
(J: / wml to the beach this Saturday
with my dorm, and I was reading
the hack of the sunscreen bottle to
see how strong it was. All of a sud
den it hit me — / had absolutely no
idea what I was looking for. What is
SIT anyway, and how do I know if
the number is high enough for my
skin and will really protect me from
getting skin cancer?
A: Now that the winter storms are
lading away and consistently over
cast skies have been once again
replaced by that unique California
blue, it seems fitting to start prepar
ing the masses for days out in the sun
and on the beach.
Il is interesting that SPF indica
tions on sunscreen products come
with no indication of units or a con
notation of how to quantify your
need for protection. Is the scale lin
ear, exponential, logarithmic? It's
only safe to say at this point that a
bigger number seems to be better.
I visited the supermarket to see if
I could come up with an answer by
just reading the labels of sunscreen
and skin care products. My hope was
one of them would give at least a
minimal definition of SPF. But the
only things I found that even resem
bled definitions were phrases like:
"I lllra Sun-Sale," "Specially Formu
lated for the California Sun" and
"Super Powerful Formula."
Even though "Super Powerful
Formula" had the right letters to fit
the acronym, 1 headed across the
street to the bookstore to see if I
could find a more definitive answer.
The SPF, or sun protection factor,
is a scalar rating that measures the
amount of extra time your skin can
be in the sun before it starts getting
red. It's based 011 your own skin
type, so if you get red after 10 min
utes in the tropical sun, a sunscreen
with an SPF of 15 would allow you to
stay in the sun 150 minutes, or 15
times your usual sun exposure. Sun
blocks do help to prevent skin cancer
as well as sunburn. Hut the safest and
most effective way to protect your
self is simply to stay out of the sun.
The Food and Drug Administra
tion suggests you buy a sunscreen
with an SPF of up to 30. After that,
the extra benefit is quite small.
If San Gregorio is your destina
tion for fun in the sun. trv not to bask

nude on the beach, at least not when
the sun is at a high angle in the sky.
Find a shady spot and enjoy it. The
worst times to be in the sun are from
about 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sand and
water can reflect extra sunlight, so be
extra careful there.
The incidence of skin cancer is
rising at an alarming rate, with ultra
violet (UV) radiation from the sun
the major cause. One reason may be
that atmospheric pollution is weak
ening the Earth's protective ozone
layer, allowing more intense solar
radiation to reach us. Even though
UV waves are longer and have less
energy than ionizing forms of radia
tion like X-rays, they are still power
ful enough to penetrate living cells
and cause DNA damage.
Choosing the best sunscreen for
you can be quite confusing and time
consuming. with all the different
brands 011 the market. Dr. Susan
Swetter, a dermatologist at the Med
ical Center, suggests, "It may take a
bit of experimentation to find the
sunscreen that best protects you."
An old-fashioned sunscreen that
is still effective is zinc oxide. This is
an opaque cream that provides a
mechanical barrier to sunlight. (It's
available in white or in neon colors
now.) It works extremely well, but

most people don't want to walk
around with their faces completely
white (or electric blue).

Q: I've also heard (hat sunscreen can
CAUSE skin cancer. How can that
he?

A: I don't think there is any sun
screen on the market today that is
actually carcinogenic. That seems
like it would be a hit counterproduc
tive to the goal of wearing sunscreen.
However, what you've heard is par
tially true.
Because sunscreen protects the
skin against visible and topical dam
age from the sun, most sunscreen
wearers think they can venture in the
sun very frequently with no risk of
future consequences.
The truth is. some of the damage
done to the skin is not immediately
evident and may take many years to
surface. Skin damage can gradually
accumulate even if sunscreen is used
religiously.
Long-term exposure to intense
sunlight can lead to melanoma and
other cancers. People of all ages
should protect against excessive sun
exposure regardless of protection,
because cancer often strikes many
years after a suntan.
