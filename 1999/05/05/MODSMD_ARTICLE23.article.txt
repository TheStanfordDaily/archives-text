## Women suffer the results of being slaves to fashion 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
If I were a guy, I probably
wouldn't have been hobbling about
on crutches last weekend. That's
because guys generally don't sacri
fice comfort for style by wearing bad
shoes without socks on a hot day. So
they don't get painful blisters that
can sometimes get infected, calling
for trips to the doctor, antibiotics
and yes, crutches. All of which hap
pened to me.
Women are notorious for wear
ing uncomfortable shoes for the
sake of fashion. It gets us into all
sorts of trouble. 1 never would have
dreamt that my pair of cute black

mules could be so murderous to my
feet.
Blisters, for example, can readily
turn from small inconveniences into
big-time problems. Before last
weekend, I had never heard of cel
lulitis, a bacterial infection of the
skin and soft tissue which, left
untreated, can quickly spread to sur
rounding tissue.
Cellulitis can develop anytime
you puncture the skin. Common
bacteria like Streptococcus pyogenes
and Staphylococcus aureus live on
skin, and according to a study pub
lished in the February edition of
Patient Care, even the smallest
break can lead to infection.
You could have cellulitus if you

notice unusual pain accompanied by
red marks on your skin extending
around the wound. If you think you
have it, you should see a doctor,
because you will need to take antibi
otics.
Normally though, blisters go
away by themselves. Doctors rec
ommend you leave the blister alone
for 24 hours to see if the fluid will
drain naturally. If not, you can
pierce the skin with a sterilized nee
dle, then cover the blister with a
gauze pad.
But there are worse conse
quences than blisters for slavishly
adhering to trends in footwear.
I know women whose grand
mothers can not wear any type of
flat shoe. Their feet have become so
accustomed to high heels that their
Achilles' tendons have actually
shortened, making it unbearably
painful for the foot to lie flat on the
ground. And in sympathy to my
predicament, a friend confessed to
me that she had broken her loot a
few years ago after slipping in her
platform shoes.
The secret to avoiding such
things is simple: buy comfortable
shoes. Most podiatrists would advise
women to steer clear of high heels
altogether. But that can be hard to
do when designers fill shoe shops
with impractical stilettos and strap
py sandals. If you have to wear
heels, go for shorter ones.
Other things you can do to keep
your feet happy include wearing
socks, putting insoles in your shoes
and using anti-perspirant on them,
especially when running or hiking.
As a recent Runner's World arti
cle devoted to foot care proclaimed,
"Your feet are the foundation of
every stride you take. Time to start
treating them that way."
Amen.
