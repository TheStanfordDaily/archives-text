In the casinos that clog downtown Reno,
fortunes yo-yo back and forth on the roll of
the dice or the throw ot a card. No one is ever
too far down to throw seven or too far up to
bust.

Sunken Diamond.

Yesterday's game between No. 6 Stanford
(34-12) and No. 25 Nevada (32-15) in the
"biggest little city in the world" had much the

same feel.
The Cardinal had no luck early and fell
into a quick hole. The team then rallied back
with a surprising five-run fifth inning to go on
top. Stanford could not hold it together,
though, as the Wolf Pack crawled back to
even the score at 12.
But just when Stanford looked down and
out — Nevada had loaded the bases with no
outs in the bottom of the ninth—the Cardinal
was thrown an ace in the form of a convenient
line-drive straight at third baseman Josh
Hochgesang. who caught it and stepped on
third for a crucial double play.
Stanford then rode Hochgesang's hot bat
to a 16-14 victory in the 10th. The senior
ripped Drew Martinson's 2-2 pitch over the
left field wall for a three-run home run and a
perfect ending to what he described as "the

best game of my career."
Hochgesang went 5-for
h with six RBIs on a single,
two doubles and two home
runs, which moved him into
sole possession of second
place on Stanford's career
home run list.
Freshman Dan Rich also
took a turn playing hero.

The stocky right-hander pitched the last
two and two-thirds innings and though he
bent, he never broke.
With the game tied and a man on third in
the eighth. Rich came on in relief of sopho
more Austin Coose to strike out junior Don
Price, the current national player of the week,
and retire the following batter to end the in
ning.

In the ninth, after giving up two straight
singles ;ind making an error on a sacrifice hunt
to load the bases. Rich proceeded to get two
line-drives to 1 lochgesang, including the dou
ble play, to end the Wolf Pack threat.
"In the ninth." Hochgesang said, "I ran in
and told Rich 'Give yourself a chance in this
situation. You never know what's going to
happen in this game.' Sure enough, good
things happen."
Both offenses seemed unstoppable in the
thin air of the eastern Sierras as they com
bined for 30 runs on 33 hits. With the wind
blowing out. seemingly innocuous fly balls
turned into extra bases, especially in the left
center field gap.
Going into the non-conference game, both
coaches said they would be using underused
or recently ineffective players to get them

more experience. Nevada head coach Gary
Powers was even quoted as saying he thought
of it as a "competitive practice."
While Stanford was able to get a number
of pitchers innings on the mound, none
looked consistently sharp.
Sophomore Austin Coose showed off his
low 9()-mph fastball and hard breaking ball
but could not stay out of trouble.
Coose, who has not seen much action late
ly, is usually used as a short reliever. It
showed. Late in his third inning of work, he
gave up a single, double and triple to succes
sive batters before being pulled for Rich.
Sophomore Brad Drew started the game
and freshman Mike Gosling followed, but
both were shelled. Drew gave up four runs on


Hochgesang
four hits in two innings, and Gosling
allowed five runs on six hits in just
over two.
Sophomore right fielder Joe Bor
chard, who has flirted with .4(X) for
the last two weeks, finally broke the
mark with a 3-for-6 outing. Borchard
is now batting .402.
Only five other Stanford players,
including head coach Marquess,
have ever hit over .4(X) in a season.
