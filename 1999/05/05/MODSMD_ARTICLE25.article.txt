# Yin and Yang

The partners on the women's No. 2 4H
doubles squad may have different ap
proaches and styles, but they always end up
m with the same results

Opposites attract — at least
that's what they say. Freshmen
Lauren Kalvaria and Gabriela Las
tra may not be opposites, but they
definitely have different styles
both on and off the tennis court.
Nonetheless, over the past three
years, they've combined to become
both a top-ranked doubles duo and
close friends.
"I'm tense and sometimes a lit
tle uptight," Kalvaria says."And
Gabby is relaxed — sometimes a
little too relaxed. Sometimes she's
in her own little world."
Kalvaria and Lastra have con
trasting tennis games as well.
Kalvaria is renowned for her
power, while Lastra is envied for
her finesse. Although she's known
for getting down on herself,
Kalvaria's focus never wavers on
the tennis court. Lastra, on the

other hand, almost always com
petes with a positive attitude, but
her intensity sometimes abandons
her.
"I can't really imagine playing
with anyone else these days,"
Kalvaria explains. "Sometimes,
I'm way too nervous in a match,
and she'll help calm me down. And
sometimes, I'll help her raise her
intensity."
While both Kalvaria and Lastra
became well-respected and highly
touted junior players, they took
polar paths toward tennis glory.
Kalvaria grew up in Florida, hit
ting her first tennis ball at the Uni
versity of Florida at the age o. six.
Soon, Kalvaria's promise was ap
parent to both her family and
coach. She was training relentlessly
at the elite Evert Academy in Boca
Raton, Fla., by the time she was a
teen-ager.
"Tennis was my life," she re
members. "I didn't have time for a

social life. It was like a job. I
worked myself to death in the hot
Florida sun."
She had wanted to play profes
sional tennis since she was a young
girl, but despite a remarkable ju
nior campaign that saw her nation
al ranking rise as high as second,
she chose to play college tennis.
"You have this dream all your
life to play pro tennis," she says.
"Your dream is shattered when
you realize you have to go to col
lege. All that work just for playing
college tennis?"
After arriving at Stanford, how
ever, Kalvaria's perspective quick
ly evolved.
"I've not regretted it for a mo
ment," she says."I didn't realize
how intense the training was here.
It's the perfect preparation for pro
tennis if that's what I want to do af
terward. I had been playing so
much tennis that it was probably
detrimental. Now I have to do

tilings a little more on my own."
Lastra also relishes her Stanford
experience. Tennis-wise, she is
thrilled to finally have consistently
competitive hitting partners after
struggling to find them at her cur
rent home in Reno, Nev. Lastra. of
course, also appreciates the social
and academic opportunities Stan
lord has to offer.
"I'm very happy with my college
choice," she says. "1 love every
thing here."
Lastra was born in Chile, but
her family soon moved to Walnut
Creek, Calif. She remembers being
especially energetic as a child and
her mom begging her to sit still.
One day, when she was seven, she
caught a tennis match on TV. and
decided she'd like to try it out. Her
parents, while unfamiliar with the
sport, encouraged her because
they hoped it would channel her
chaotic energy.
"They still wanted me to play

soccer, too" she recalls. "But 1
thought tennis was such a cool
thing."
Eventually, both Lastra and
Kalvaria were considered two of
the nation's top juniors, traveling
internationally to play at the junior
Grand Slam events.
The two met at a United States
Tennis Association training camp
when they were 16.
It turned out there were three
players at the camp without regu
lar doubles partners — two of
them were Kalvaria and Lastra.
The third was a girl who played
brilliant singles but struggled in
doubles. In an attempt to avoid
being paired with the third girl,
Kalvaria and Lastra quickly found
each other.
Ever since, they've distin
guished themselves as one of the
nation's best doubles teams. They

captured the 19% Easter Bowl, a
highly prestigious junior tourna
ment, and they also powered
through a few rounds at the 19% Ju
nior US Open, one of the world's
most competitive junior events.
Despite their contrasting per
sonalities, the two became friends
quickly.
In fact, they cite tendency to
have too much fun on the court as
their primary weakness.
"We have a tendency to laugh
hysterically on the court," Lastra
admits. "If the opponent drops her
racket, we think it's funny. If she
shanks a ball, we think it's funny. If
the coaches get mad at us, we think

it's funny."
Nonetheless, they both own a
tenacious will to win.
"We want to do well so badly,"
Kalvaria says. "Sometimes we
laugh because we're nervous. 1
think it might hurt our tennis,
though, because it relaxes our mus
cles too much."
Despite their antics on the court,
Kalvaria and Lastra'manage to win
most of their matches. Having
played together for so long, they've
gotten to know each other on sever
al levels. Most importantly, they
can anticipate their partner's next
move on the court.
"I know what she's going to be
able to stretch for or get," Kalvaria
explains. "We can compensate for
each other. We played a huge match
against Arizona and I was injured,

so (iabby took three-quarters of the
court and was the MVP of the
match."
Playing at the No. 2 position for
Stanford behind the nation's sec
ond-ranked tandem of freshman
Marissa Irvin and junior Teryn
Ashley, Kalvaria and Lastra have
suffered a few surprising losses in
their first year at Stanford, but have
also posted several impressive vic
tories.
They will find out today whether
or not they qualified for the individ
ual NCAA doubles competition.
"If we get in, we'll definitely
make a dent in the draw," Kalvaria
says.
Lastra laughs.
"When people see our names,
they'll be scared," she says with a
grin. "Because they'll know."
