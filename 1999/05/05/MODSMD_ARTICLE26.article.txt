The senior crew members said their good
byes to competing at their home course of Red
wood Shores last Saturday. Although neither
Cardinal varsity eight boats defeated the heavi
ly favored California crews, the Stanford crews
were pleased with their performance.
Women's head coach Aimee Baker had re
alistic hopes about their race against third
ranked Cal. "I thought we would be farther be
hind, but we closed the margin and linished
strong."
Baker's lineup change due to injury also
proved to be successful.

The women did surprisingly well by splitting
their races with Cal. The novice eight defeated
the Bears by more than 25 seconds. The
women's varsity four clinched the other Cardi
nal victory 12 seconds ahead of Cal.

course. They did just that by coming out at the
start stronger than expected.
Senior co-captain Katie Sears said. "We did

what we had hoped. We didn't let them walk on
us right away. The race got harder and harder,
but we raced for ourselves, not for Cal."
The women's varsity eight lost by 15 seconds
to the Bears.
The men's lack of victories does not give an
accurate portrayal of their performance. The
Cardinal had strong races against top-ranked
Cal. The Bears have been dominating their
competition by at least 10 seconds in the 2.(XX)-
meter races. The Stanford freshman boat fell by
14 seconds.
After a rough weekend in Wisconsin, the
Stanford men practiced intensely last week to
