Stanford head coach Steve Bour
dow knew thai in a year of unusually
tough Pacific Coast competition, his
team's hopes for the district coed
dinghy title and a trip to the national
regatta hinged on Stanford's ability
to get out fast and flawlessly from the
starting line. But when the gun
sounded for this weekend's champi
onship races, the No. 16 Cardinal was
left in the middle of the pack.
A disappointing first day of racing
put the Stanford sailing team out of
contention for a national berth at the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association coed dinghy
championship at Monterey Bay. The
Cardinal finished in a distant fourth
place to sixth-ranked USC, UC-
Santa Barbara and Hawaii in the 10-
team field.

SAILING
â–  Saturday-Sunday: No. 16 Stanford
finished fourth in Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate Yacht Racing Champi
onships in Monterey.

"We did extremely poorly on the
first day," Bourdow said. "We sailed
tactically poorly and made poor
choices relative to the conditions and
the competition."
Conditions on Monterey Bay
were not windy enough to give the
physical Cardinal the advantage it
had hoped for. In Saturday's medium
winds, junior skipper Anika
Leerssen and junior crew Alexis
Krivkovieh started for Stanford in A
Division racing, while sophomore
skipper Heather Porter and junior
Katie Gregg raced in B Division.
However. Leerssen and Porter
had trouble determining the strate
gies that would keep them out of
trouble. They took some risks that
didn't pay off and posted disappoint
ing finishes, putting Stanford in ninth
place after 12 of 20 races. The Cardi
nal immediately responded by jug
gling its lineup. Sophomore Jeff Con
don replaced Leerssen in A Division,
and junior co-captain Tyler Doyle
and junior Caroline Sumpf took over
in B Division.
"We made changes quickly and
did a little better." Bourdow said.
"We overcame [Saturday's perfor
mance] by starting fresh Sunday."
Sunday brought increased winds
and better sailing for the Stanford
squad, which finished most of the
day's races in second or third place.
The team began to sail more conser
vatively and was rewarded with high
er finishes. Although it could not
overcome Saturday's discouraging
start, according to Bourdow. the Car
dinal finished its season with a "re
spectable finish."
One of the weekend's highlights
for the Cardinal was the debut of
sophomore crew Meg Crofoot, who
sailed with Condon on Sunday. As
Stanford's only medium-weight
crew, she is expected to be a team
contributor in the future.
"Meg made her first crewing
debut in a major regatta, and she did
a super, super job," Bourdow said.
"She has great potential."
Crofoot may join teammates
Gregg, Krivkovich, Leerssen,
sophomore Sally Madsen, Porter,
senior Taylor Robinson and Sumpf
in the ICYRA national women's
dinghy championship later this
month. The women will spend the
upcoming weeks honing their racing
techniques and adjusting to the
change from Flying Juniors to 4205.
