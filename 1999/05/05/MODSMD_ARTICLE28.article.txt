# Axess limits don't cause deadline crunch
## Though only 65 can use computer at once, no one left out in cold 
### Keith Proctor 
Last week, as thousands of stu
dents logged onto Axess to enter
their Draw group information, they
faced a constraint â€” only 65 users
may log onto Axess at one time.
To ease system use and help en
sure students wouldn't miss the
Draw deadline because of system
restrictions, Kathleen Bransfield,
manager of Housing Assignment
Services, instituted deadline
changes and encouraged students
to logon before the last minute.
According to Bransfield, "Web
interface restricts the number of si
multaneous users. The danger of
raising the limit [above 651 is per
fv . inance degradation."
"If there was no limit, during
very busy times no one could get
work done," said Roberta Lueier,
an application developer with In
formation Technology Systems
and Services.
Lueier implemented Axess'
housing functions and helped mon
itor the system during the Draw
crunch-time last Sunday. "Once we
raise [Axess] to 70 users or above,
the system slows down quite a bit,"
she said.
In order to facilitate this limit.
Housing Assignment Services
moved the Draw deadline from

Wednesday to Sunday so that
Axess would not be hogged down
by University personnel using
Axess for office functions.
In addition HAS ensured the
deadline fell after housing stall se
lection announcements, so Draw
groups could adjust their roster if
one of their members was offered a
house staff position, such as resi
dent assistant.
"Moving the deadline after staff
announcements had a very signifi
cant effect because it allowed draw
groups to adjust." Bransfield said.
Axess also operates under time
constraints, not permitting entry
from 11 :59 p.m. to 8 a.m. "The limit
is to allow for batch processing and
the ability to update and meet the
requests of the day," Assoc. Regis
trar C iloria Williams said. The Reg
istrar's ()flice bears the ultimate re
sponsibility for Axess.
HAS attempted to inform stu
dents of the system's limitations by
posting fliers in dining halls and
sending e-mails out to resident as
sistants encouraging students to log
on early.
Following the adjustment of
deadlines for this year and Brans
field's attempts to increase aware
ness. the maximum of 65 users on
Sunday was hit "24 or 25 times
which is actually pretty good and
much better than last year." ac
cording to Lueier.
According to Bransfield, "we've
received no complaints that stu
dents missed the Draw."
