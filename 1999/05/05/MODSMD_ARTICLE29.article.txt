### Sarah Rapaway Staff writer 
I'he Carnegie Foundation for the Advance
ment of Teaching is proposing to build a new edu
cation research center on the Stanford campus.
The facility for 35 employees would be located off
Juniper Serra Boulevard near the golf course.
In coordination with the Stanford Planning of
fice and Stanford Management Company, the
foundation hopes to secure a5l -year ground lease

from the University for about five acres.
Project Manager Peter Root said the founda
tion is applying for a special use permit from
Santa Clara County. The county is also conduct
ing an Environmental Impact Report to investi
gate environmental impacts of the building pro
ject.
Santa Clara County County Supervisor Joe
Simitian said the project will be considered inde
pendently of Stanford's other development plans.
"It is not an area covered by the Stanford general
use permit. It will rise and fall on its own merits,"
he said.
"We just started preliminary structural de
sign." Root said. Plans include a 2().(MX) square
foot center of connected wooden buildings sur
rounding a courtyard. The foundation also plans
to plant more than 2(M) oak tress.

Founded in 1905 by Andrew Carnegie, the
Carnegie Foundation is the third-oldest founda
tion in America and promotes non-profit educa
tional research. Although its current president is
Stanford Prof. Lee Shulman. the foundation is not
associated with the University and draws income
from its own endowment.
Larry Horton, director of government and
community relations at Stanford, spoke positively
of the new center proposal. "I think it's a great ad
vantage to the entire area that the foundation is
located here," he said.
Some of the foundation's work has been to cre
ate the Educational Testing Service, which ad
ministers the SATs, and to help establish U.S.
medical training standards.
Public hearings will debate approval of the
project's architectural site after the FIR is issued.
