After a brush with authority that
led to a stint in an Alameda County
jail, five Stanford students emerged
from the ordeal exhausted but res
olute in their commitment to the
fight for ethnic studies.
The students were among 83 peo
ple arrested by UC-Berkeley police
while protesting the school's lack of
support for its ethnic studies pro
grams.
"The entire experience was over
all empowering in the sense of the
solidarity we felt with [the other pro
testers] and our ability to hold our
own. but there were definitely mo
ments that were somewhat scary,
because you just realize the authori
ty that some people have over you,"
said junior Oeindrila Dube, one of

the students who was arrested.
The Stanford students arrived at
UC-Berkeley's California Hall, the
site of a hunger strike, at about 1:30
a.m. yesterday.
The other protesters already
camped out on the grass saw police
officers on the scene and sensed that
something was brewing.
"The air was pretty tense by the
time we got there," Dube said.
The 80 or 90 protesters formed a
circle in anticipation of police action.
The police began arresting pro
testers at about 3 a.m.. and many stu
dents engaged in passive resistance,
letting their bodies go limp so that
police officers had no choice but to
drag them to buses and vans waiting

to transport them to a jail.
The students from Stanford did
not resist arrest and instead walked
with the officers. "All of us just
walked, {but ] there were a lot of peo
ple that were dragged." Dube said.
" There were so many cops for so
few people, and we were encircled in
barricades. They were wearing riot
gear for part of the time with night
sticks and masks, and shining lights
on us," said senior Sarah Eisenstein.
one of the students arrested. "We
were handcuffed for three and a half
hours and people's hands were
swelling up and turning blue and
stuff like that."
Nevertheless, Eisenstein said pro
testers received relatively lax treat
ment because they were students and
were part of a large group.
Students expressed suspicion
about the odd hour of the arrests.

which came when most media cam
era crews and photographers were
not around to capture images of po
lice officers handcuffing and drag
ging students.
"What really frustrated me the
whole time was when the media got
there, the police told them to get
away.... It was an hour before they
could get their cameras out," said ju
nior Tim Ly, who witnessed the ar
rests but was not taken into custody.
"I was so worried that the efforts and
the courage of all these students
would be lost if not captured" by the
media.
The students were charged with a
variety of violations, the most com
mon of which were trespassing and
lodging in a structure without per
mission. However, some received
charges for loitering, wandering,
prowling and refusing to leave — all

separate items in the penal code,
Dube explained.
All of the students have court
dates in early June.
Despite the publicity the arrests
have brought to the protest, students
remain focused on the issues at hand.
"I am afraid people are going to
focus too much on the fact that 80
students went to jail [instead of] the
fact that [UC-Berkeley] Chancellor
[Robert Berdahl] refused to negoti
ate directly with students and in
stead sent UC-Berkeley police to
basically arrest students in the mid
dle of the night. I think that says a lot
about the chancellor's values and
the place for student voice in the
chancellor's eyes." said senior Lind
say Imai, who was among those ar
rested.
"We feel that destroying ethnic
studies is silencing the truth, and we

can never give in to that. It's a way of
distorting history, and we don't want
that to happen," Eisenstein said.
UC-Berkeley's ethnic studies
program was the first in the nation,
and Eisenstein expressed fear that
cutbacks at a place that is often seen
as a role model for such studies could
have repercussions at other schools.
"If it gets gutted [at Berkeley], it can
get gutted here and in the rest of the
country," she said.
The protesters have a list of de
mands, including an increase in the
number of full-time, tenured faculty
positions for ethnic studies and a
restoration of $300,000 that was cut
from the Ethnic Studies Depart
ment's budget.
"By not having more tenured fac
ulty, they're sort of implicitly allow
ing for a disintegration of the [Ethnic
Studies] Department, because

they're hiring faculty who aren't full
time or don't have the security of
tenure," Imai said.
The arrests have not changed the
students' commitment to the
protest — if anything, they are feel
ing even more solidarity as a result of
the ordeal.
Though Imai described her arrest
as a "maddening experience," she
was also comforted because "there
was so much solidarity among the
students that for the most part peo
ple's spirits were really strong. There
was just a lot of love there because
there was so much dedication to the
cause that we're fighting for."
According to Imai, several Stan
ford students camped out at Califor
nia Hall last night, and others plan to
continue going until there is a con
clusion. "As long as we have energy,
we'll be up there," she said.
