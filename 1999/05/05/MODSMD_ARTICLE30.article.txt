# Wolters keeps it all in focus — on and off the court
## 
### Jake Widens Staff writer 
As the No. 1 player on the men's
tennis team, the No. 3 player in the
nation, vice president of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity, a student
who finished his economics degree a

quarter early and a person who is re
spected both on and off the court for
his leadership and sportsmanship,
senior Ryan Wolters is the quintes
sential Stanford student athlete.
"You don't get any better than
Wolly as a player or a person," said
head coach Dick Gould. "He is one

of the best players I have ever
coached, and certainly one of the
best competitors. Even on his off
days he battles hard and hangs in
every match to the very end — that
is a pretty good life lesson."
Wolters is from San Jose and was
consistently ranked in the top three

in the nation as a junior. He did not
think he would want to play at Stan
ford, however, until his senior year
in high school.
"I always thought it would he too
close to home, and at that time I was
more looking for a school like Geor
gia where I wouldn't have to worry
about academics and I could play
for a year or two before going pro,"
Wolters said.
But Wolters' decision eventually
came down to his wanting the best
chance possible for a national cham
pionship ring. In addition, he was
very impressed with Gould and as
sistant coach John Whitlinger.
"I wanted somewhere I would
have a chance at getting a ring and a
place where I could improve my
game," Wolters said. "1 also started
to realize the benefits of a Stanford
education. I couldn't have asked for
a place with a better group of guys,
or better coaches — it has been an
amazing four years."
Wolters said that when he came
to Stanford as a freshman, he never
expected to be here all four years.
The trend at that time was to play a
year, maybe two. in college before
turning pro. With each year, though,
his degree became more important,
he loved working with his team
mates and coaches and he felt he
was making strong improvement in
his game, so he fell he had to stay all
four.
He said lie has no regrets about
his decision. The onlv regret he

could think of in his four years here
was not taking his academics as seri
ously as he would have liked as a
freshman.
In the next couple of weeks
Wolters will be playing for his
fourth national championship and a
chance at his first individual singles
ring. Both he and the Cardinal
should be ranked in the nation's top
four heading into the NC'AAs, so he
has as good a chance as anyone to
win another title in Athens, Ga.
"Hopefully Wolly can end it with
a bang." Whitlinger said. "No one
deserves another title as much as
Ryan. He has been a great captain
both on and off the court, and such a
huge part of our tennis family the
last four years. We will miss him a
lot."
Both Gould and Whitlinger said
that Wolters' attitude is perhaps
even more impressive than his abili
ty. Gould said that Wolters always
wins and loses the right way. He
keeps every match in perspective
and never makes too big of a deal
about a win or a loss. Gould said this
is a rare skill for a young athlete, or
a young person, to possess.
In addition to his healthy per
spective, Wolters is the ultimate
team player. On last year's phenom
enal team, any one of four players
could have played No. I and all did
at one point in the season. When it
came time for the NCAAs. some
one had to agree to play four.
"Ryan actually came to me and

suggested he play No. 4."
Whitlinger said.
"He said it would be better for
the team chemistry and he would do
his job. That was a very unselfish
move and showed me a lot of char
acter. Then he went out and won
every match he played at No. 4.
That's Ryan for you."
Wolters said that the key to his
years at Stanford has been balance.
He has never let tennis take over his
life.
"I have found other things be
sides tennis that 1 like to do,"
Wolters said. "A lot of people 1 see
focus only on tennis, or only on get
ting straight As. 1 just try to do the
best I can at what I am doing in the
moment. II I have a match, I try to
work as hard as 1 can: il I'm study
ing. that's what I am concentrating
on; when I hang out with my friends,
1 am going to enjoy every minute of
that as well."
Wolters said his goal as a player
in the future is to keep enjoying ten
nis and turn pro for at least two
years. He said he doesn't want to
plav more than two years if he is
only in the top 300 or so and barely
getting by.
"Mv goal is to keep improving
and eventually get into the top 20, or
be a competitive player in the
Grand Slams. I am realistic, though,
and if after a couple of years I don't
see potential for improvement, 1 will
probably hang it up and go to busi
ness school."
