Men's Ultimate Frisbee
For the sixth straight year, the
Stanford Men's Ultimate team is
heading to nationals after beating
UC-Santa Cruz in the finals of the
newly formed Northwest Regionals.
Although the conditions were
windy and drizzly, Stanford found
its typical deep game unaffected, as
it rolled through pool play on Satur
day. The team's defense, which had
been a problem in earlier tourna
ments, came up big, both on the
mark and in coverage, with a num
ber of point blocks throughout the
weekend.
On Sunday, Stanford faced a
University of British Columbia
team that was no match for the Car
dinal. Stanford raced to a 13-6 victo
ry, quickly driving to the main field
for the semifinals after the game.
Next up for the Cardinal was a
Victoria team that spent the tourna
ment earning a reputation as a team
with a dishonest streak.
Luckily, Stanford was able to
keep the game under control with
the help of the linesmen, eventually

winning 15-10.
In the finals, Stanford faced
perennial rival Santa Cruz, a team it
had fallen to in sectionals. After
falling behind early in the game, the
Cardinal came back strong in the
second half, triumphing 15-11.
Stanford now journeys to Boul
der, Colo., where it will face the likes
of UC-Santa Barbara, Brown,
North Carolina State, Colorado and
Carleton.
"For the first time that I know of,
I think there are at least six or seven
teams with a realistic chance of win
ning Nationals," said senior Omer
Atesman.
Women's Ultimate Frisbee
Success was the name of the
game for Stanford Ultimate, as the
women were even more dominating
then the men.
On Saturday, the Cardinal took
care of Oregon State, Las Positas,
and Washington, not allowing any
team to score more than four points
in games to 15.
The dominance was kept up on
Sunday, as the Cardinal beat Santa
Cruz 15-3, giving Stanford the No. 1
seed in its pool. Stanford's next op
ponent was the other No. 1 seed.

Oregon, a team that it disposed of
15-5.
Individually, graduate student
Sam Salvia contributed greatly on
offense with her open cuts, as did ju
nior Camille Yu. On defense,
sophomore Delia Chiu led the team
defense, accompanied by grad stu
dent speedster Alicia Mercer.
Squash
Last year there was only a man
and a dream. Junior Mark Goldstein
took this dream, this desire and has
transformed it into a reality, a team
that is growing each week into a con
tender.
Last week, the Cardinal faced the
California Golden Bears in the sec
ond Big Squash. Earlier this year,
the two teams squared off in Berke
ley, with the Bears winning 8-1. This
meeting was held in the Decathlon
Club due to Stanford's inadequate
facilities, and although the outcome
was much the same, there was
marked improvement for the Cardi
nal.
Senior Ezequiel Alvarez-Saave
dra's match came down to the fifth
game, where he lost 17-16. Golden
son was equally as impressive, as he
fell 17-15 in the fifth game.
