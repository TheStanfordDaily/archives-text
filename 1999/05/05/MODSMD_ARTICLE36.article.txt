syffl w *s hard for me not to get emotionally
112 (/) involved. "Sisters Matsumoto," the latest
ZIS production from the San Jose Repertory
Theater, could almost be called "Sisters Kawano" since
it strikes such a resemblance to my own family.
Playwright Philip Kan Gotanda paints an incredibly
vivid picture of post-World War II life for Japanese-
American (JA) families like the fictitious Matsumotos
returning to Stockton. It is a must-see for any genera
tion, ethnicity or gender.
Gotanda manages to touch on the different types of
people within the Japanese-American community.
Lisa Li plays Chiz as a sort of hybrid character between
Kathy Bates ("Titanic") and Camryn Manheim ("The

Practice"). Chiz is very tough and

tomboyish, and she

is not quite

th e

dain
ty
i

image one might have of Japanese women. Chiz is
married to Bola (Stan Egi, with an accurate accent), a
Hawaiian doctor who has contempt for "haole"
Americans dismissing the loyalty of JAs.
Next is the obedient daughter, Grace (Kim Miyori).
Grace has held her father, who passed away while
interned in Arkansas, on a pedestal for his gallant
attempts to ride through the tidal waves of racism and
hatred directed against JAs. Grace is so submissive that
she had agreed to an arranged marriage with Hideo
(Nelson Mashita), a JA educated in Japan, prior to the
outbreak of World War 11. One senses there may not
be much true love between Hideo and Grace —
instead, the two essentially cling to each other out of
habit and convenience.

The final daughter is Rose (Sala Iwamatsu), and her

post-war problems are the

most complex. Rose's lover

was killed in battle as a

member of the 442 nd

Regiment (the most
decorated American

unit during World
i War II). Rose is

often melancholy

and unwilling to

test the waters
of dating since
her heart is set
on her deceased
fianc£. However
Henry, a child
hood friend
teased for his
ringworm,

reappears
and begins
to hit it off
with Rose.
Is there a
potential
relation
ship in the
air?

Will Marchett brings forth a complicated character in
Mr. Hersham, the Matsumotos' white neighbor. Mr.
Hersham may potentially be quite open-minded, as he
apparently has been for decades, but it is equally pos
sible that he is merely subverting his feelings extraor
dinarily well. Regardless, Mr. Hersham brings yet
another perspective to the play, as he tries to reestab
lish the friendship but realizes that things are differ
ent.
Things, indeed, were very different after the war.
Businesses and farms faced an uphill battle if they
were owned by JAs. Many families, like both sides of
my own, returned home from internment camps to
find that very little remained. The Matsumotos nearly
have to start over, as the government did not reim
burse any families for property or valuables lost dur
ing the internment.
So as we all look to secure ourselves internships for
the summer, perhaps it might be wise to take a break
from the process and experience the "internships" of
JAs in relentless and soul-searching fashion. I may
have some personal family history attached to my
viewing of "Sisters Matsumoto," but this is one story
about adversity and love that anyone could relate to.
