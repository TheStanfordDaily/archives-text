"Orchards" is an exceptional
evening of courageous and imagi
native theater. Produced by the
Custom Made Theater Company,

"Orchards" is a series of one-act plays based on short stories by Anton
Chekhov.
What makes the experience of watching "Orchards" special begins even
before the lights go down. The show is performed in the unpretentious
Bannam Place Theater, which is in the basement of a narrow Victorian
building in San Francisco's North Beach. The srnallness of the theater
immediately creates a unique intimacy between the actors and audience,
making it impossible not to become absorbed in the action on stage.
More than 20 short stories by Chekhov were sent out to major modern
playwrights with the instruction they be adapted for the stage. The seven
one-act plays that were returned make up "Orchards," which was first pro
duced in 1995 and directed by future Goodman Theatre Artistic Director
Robert Falls.
The featured playwrights include Maria Irene Fornes, Spalding Gray,
John Guare, David Mamet, Wendy Wasserstein, Michael Weller and
Samm-Art Williams.
Perhaps Chekhov himself would have a hard time recognizing his fic
tion in its new incarnation. Some of the adaptations have little in common
with the short stories they were based on. The pieces range from
Wasserstein's more traditional "The Man in the Case," to Williams' bizarre
"Eve of the Trial" — the story of a Russian man who tries to escape perse

cution from the Bolsheviks by marrying two American prostitutes and
going into hiding as a Mormon in Utah. Despite the various plot lines, all
of the one acts retain the simultaneously comic and tragic strains charac
teristic of Chekhov's writing.
Wasserstein's seamless transformation of "The Man in the Case" is the
first to begin the series. Set in a Russian village at the start of the century,
it is about Byelinkov and Varinka — a couple engaged to be married.
Byelinkiov t an established academic who is set in his ways (he always wears
his galoshes, rain or shine, so that the weather never takes him by sur
prise), aspires toward convention and normalcy. His bride Varinka, age 30,
is headstrong and adventurous but fears that she is too old for marriage.
They must learn to share their lives with each other. Wasserstein's wonder
ful ear for dialogue shines in this piece.
1 he six other one acts examine everything from playing cards to sky
diving and range from minimalist to absurd. They are connected by
Spalding Gray's adaptation of "Rivkala's Ring," an ongoing story about
tests of courage, in which characters encounter a rat in the swimming
pool, suicide on the street and other difficulties of 20th-century living.
This production of "Orchards" marks the San Francisco debut of The
Custom Made Theater Company, which recently relocated from Boston.
Founded in 1997 by two Clark University graduates, the company has a
history of producing political theater, including shows by Lee Blessing,
Mamet, Gertrude Stein, Tony Kushner and Harvey Fierstein.
