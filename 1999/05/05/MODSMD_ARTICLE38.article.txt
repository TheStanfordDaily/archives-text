Entrapment
Catherine Zeta-Jones
Sean Connery

/"7) High-wire action has rarely felt duller than in Jon Amiel's "Entrapment." Catherine
Zeta-Jones, still looking mighty fine after her voluptuous turn in"The Mask of Zorro,"

couldn't act or speak well in this movie if her life depended on it. Sean Connery, some-

times a master at bringing dark characters a sense of nobility, sets off another bomb with this

movie. The effects pale in comparison to "The Matrix," and the plot feels rehashed from

"Zorro" and "Out of Sight."
It is a sad sign when climactic stunt sequences make a person yawn or lose interest. A
more intriguing thing to do while watching this movie is trying to figure out who exact
ly is filling what role. In other words, be prepared for some surprising twists and double-

takes. Everyone may not be whom they say they are.
But plot intrigue aside, Connery has another cookie-cutter role — this time, his
wily rogue is named Robert MacDougal. MacDougal pointedly reminds fellow thief
Gin Baker (Zeta-Jones) that, as a rule, he never gets romantically involved with a
crime partner. Never mind that Connery is more than twice Zeta-Jones' age in reali
ty. I got the feeling Connery understood this lack of credibility, and he put forth a
more voyeuristic, grandfatherly take on the role.

I actually got the creeps watching Connery look over Zeta-Jones as she practiced her
maneuvers. Connery acts as the wise mentor in "Entrapment," which reminds me most
recentiy of Anthony Hopkins role as a teacher in"Zorro."The only purpose for includ
ing scenes where Zeta-Jones creeps and crawls along the floor in really tight clothing is

to keep the testosterone-laden males interested. Sure, it works, but you can get this from

"Zorro" or even some fan's Web page.
Director Amiel ("Copycat") has tried to duplicate the clever and stylish "Out of Sight,"
but he falls way short. Whereas "Out of Sight" made the viewer think about the plot struc-

ture, "Entrapment" feels forced and ridiculous. One scene where Connery and Zeta-Jones
hang from the highest building in the world seems particularly inane and laughable. It is trag
ic that Amiel could not bring forth the energy and suspense which made "Copycat" a taut
thriller.

All in all, Ving Rhames ("Pulp Fiction," "Out of Sight") may be the only positive force pre
sent here, as he again provides the audience with laughs as a tough guy. "Entrapment" tries for
believable action sequences and romantic tension; instead, it only gives the impression that you
are stuck in a windowless, one-room triple for an entire year.
