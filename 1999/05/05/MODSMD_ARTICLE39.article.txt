# 1969: BORSCHT, SEX, COLD WATER
## Spring is here again. 
### 
an easy theme to manipulate in spring, when orchids
112 C/) open and clothing layers are shed: a woman is trapped in a
tIS loveless relationship, burdened by family duties. Her body,
still young but getting older, burns with passion in the summer heat.
Her husband away, she meets him — the renegade, the rebel, the one
who will take her to the core of her existence. She succumbs to the lust.
Oh! The heat! The pleasure! But, behold, the damned ethical ramifi
cations ensue.
If the story sounds familiar, you've doubtless seen movies like "The

Bridges of Madison County" or read books like "The
Awakening." They — like "A Walk on the Moon," a newly
released film produced in part by Dustin Hoffman and
directed by actor Tony Goldwyn (evil seducer of Demi
Moore in "Ghost") — are enticing for moviegoers in balmy
times like these, when the ground subdy procreates and
sexual yearnings are a lot more compelling than midterms.
The trysts in "A Walk on the Moon," set in 1969 in the
Catskill Mountains of upstate New York, are microcosms of

the time's cultural changes. It was not only the year of Woodstock and
Neil Armstrong but was also around the end of a time when the
Catskills were known as "the Borscht Belt," after the beet soup popu
lar at Jewish holidays. Beginning in the 1940s or thereabouts, the nick
name came from the period when resorts in the Catskills were the
prime vacation spot for thousands of Jewish New Yorkers fleeing the
city heat.
The grander anti-establishment thoughts of the 1960s are repre
sented by the smaller ones in "A Walk on the Moon." Pearl (Diane
Lane) is married to Marty (Liev Schreiber), a well-meaning repairman
whom Pearl married at 17, after she got pregnant. Like many of their
friends, the family vacations at an upstate bungalow colony — Marty
sweating away the work week in New York fixing televisions, joining
, Pearl, their children (Anna Paquin and Bobby Boriello) and his moth-

er Lilian (Tovah Feldshuh) on the weekends.
Bored with her marriage and intoxicated by the summer, Pearl is
easily seduced by a traveling hippie, Walker Jerome (Viggo
Mortensen), who hawks blouses from a converted school bus (what
else?). It doesn't take long for Pearl to fall for him and so, one day, she's
sweating, making tunafish salad for her kids and wondering what hap
pened to her life and the next she's with Walker, skinny dipping or
tripping at Woodstock.
If it sounds like a quick change, too quick for real life, you're

right. Unrealistic Hollywood plots are of course expected
in motion pictures, but this film went overboard. Families
wracked by affairs don't heal within 105 minutes. A moth
er-in-law — Jewish or otherwise — doesn't normally take
well to correcdy guessing her son's wife is sleeping around
(as was the case in "Walk," when Lilian matter-of-factly
accuses Pearl of "schtupping the blouse man"). And, final
ly, sex in an upstate New York stream is neither sexual nor,
frankly, possible. The water is frigid melted snow and,

based on one movie critic's experience, it has the cruel effect of alter
ing male genitalia from being external to virtually internal and makes
an erection all but impossible.
That's not to say that "Walk" doesn't have its moments. Schreiber
play a believable and sympathetic Marty and shouldn't be held
accountable for his lines in the movie's faulty ending. Anna Paquin,
perhaps best known for her work in"The Piano," also gives a com
pelling performance acting out her own coming of age story.
A student in spring fever can easily relate to the vernal urges in "A
Walk on the Moon." But a better idea is to save your money and live
the true story yourself.
