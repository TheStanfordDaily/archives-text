## 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
Stanford is celebrating Cinco de
Mayo this year with a week of activ
ities and a look at how an improba
ble 19th-century victory still affects
Chicanos today.
Although not often recognized
in Mexico, Cinco de Mayo—a com
memoration of the May 5,1N62, vic
tory of a ragtag group of Mexican
soldiers against superior French
forces in the village of Puebla — has
become a popular Latin-American

holiday and an annual iHair for
Stanford students.
In the United Slates, Cinco de
Mayo "has turned into a celebration
of our history and culture," said
freshman Rita Rico, who lives in
Casa Zapata, the Chicano / Latino
theme house. "The holiday recalls
the nationalistic sentiments of
[Mexico]."
According to sophomore Sofia
Martos, an ethnic theme associate
in Zapata, the spirit of Cinco de
Mayo lives on today in the continu
ing struggle for ethnic studies.

"We remember the battle of
Puebla as people fighting against
great odds. This week, students at
UC-Berkeley and across the state
are fighting against the odds to keep
ethnic studies," she said.
Zapata has planned a full range
of activities to celebrate the holiday.
The week-long observance kicked
off Friday with "Fiesta a la Mexi
cana." The party music was provid
ed by Cirupo Lobo Norteno, a group
specializing in Northern Mexican

folk music.
"That's a little hit different than
what's been done in the past," said
Marisela Gonzalez, an ethnic
theme associate at Zapata. More
contemporary hands have per
formed at previous Cinco de Mayo
galas.
Thus far, festivities have also in
cluded a Spanish-language ('atholic
mass in the Zapata courtyard on
Sunday, a discussion on the origins
of the holiday yesterday and the
screening yesterday of the film
■ Juarez," which highlights Benito
Juarez's movement to free Mexico
from foreign rule.
Today, Lorenzo Meyer, profes
sor of political science and interna
tional relations at El Colegio de
Mexico, will give a noon lecture on
"The Battle of Puebla," the victory
Cinco de Mayo celebrates. The or
ganizers said they hope that Meyer,
an internationally renowned schol
ar, will draw many students as well
as people from off campus.
"I don't expect everyone to

come, but people who want to learn
more about [the holiday] will have a
chance to do so," said junior Wil
fred de (luzman, an event organiz
er and ethnic theme associate at Za
pata.
MEChA,aChicano / Latinostu
dent group, and the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition are sponsoring a
C'inco de Mayo program today at 5
p.m. in White Plaza, featuring
music and dancing. They organized
the event to show support for work
ers at Tresidder's Bon Appetit who
are negotiating a contract for in
creased wages and benefits.
Zapata will continue the week
long series by offering a lecture by
Arturo Madrid, professor of hu
manities at Trinity University in
San Antonio, Texas, on "Por la ven
tana: Chicanos and Institutions of
Higher Education, A Personal
Memoir" on Friday in Building 320,
Room 105.
The celebration will culminate
Friday night at 8:30 p.m. with an
evening of comedy. Comedian
Marga Gomez, who is of Cuban and
Puerto Rican heritage, will perform
in "Noche de Carnaval," at Zapata
dining hall.
