BEER FOR PROCRASTINATION
There's something objectionable about the
person who doesn't procrastinate. You
know who I'm talking about: that interna
tional student next door who wakes up at 7 a.m.
everyday and bikes to La Honda and alphabetizes
his CD collection. Those people, they're not like
the rest of us. They're the ones who are actually
on top of things.
Procrastination, you see, is one of the great
populist trademarks at Stanford. It's what we the
masses do, it's the signifier of the in-group, it's
inexhaustible fodder for conversation — the
great bonding mechanism of Stanford.
"I pulled an all-nighter last night, I was screw
ing around all week."
"Oh yeah, well I pulled two all-nighters in a
row— I'm on my third wind man!"
"Whatever, I haven't slept since March."
We've all been party to this repartee.
So any beer for the procrastinator has to have
a populist appeal. Beer for procrastination can't
be beer-snob beer. No Martha's Vineyard brews
with names like Smuttynose, no Belgian ales like
Chimay at $5 a botde.
Moreover, beer for procrastination has to be a
slow-sipping beer. You don't chug while you're
procrastinating: you drink a little, then you get
up and do your laundry, then you drink a bit
more, then you surf the Net and so forth — for
hours on end. Beer for procrastination is beer
that moves at the pace of the procrastinator —
slow, slow, slower. A foam that gathers cautiously
at the top and then steeps its way down the face
of the glass. A beer so thick and rich that it phys
ically forbids you drinking more than a mouthful
at once.
As a beer for procrastination, I pick Steelhead
Extra Stout. We discovered Steelhead over at Chi
Theta Chi after making a special mission to
Beverages 8c More just to try out all the local
stouts. Steelhead won hands down. It's very thick
and very simple too, tinged mostly with bitter
nuts and coffee. Although it's a Blue Lake micro
brew (read: yuppie), its strength forbids it from
being a beer-snob beer and instead is the beer
world's equivalent of a raucous night out bowling
with the guys when you should be home sleeping
for work the next day. Steelhead Extra Stout is a
drink for the toughest among us — its name,
after all, contains the words "steel" and "stout."
Now that's populist appeal.

ro everything there is a season and a heer. A simple notion,
perhaps one that you find doubtful For no foodstuff is so
versatile that it compliments every occasion, right?
Well perhaps you are right. There are indeed one or two times
when even beer does not belong, like right before you drive your
car (or, notably at Stanford, your bike). But I think we can say this:
beer adds panache to more of life's moments than just about any
thing else you can ingest.
Beer; for example, is for the good times. From swing dancing to
drug experimentation, from study partnering at the CoHo to
other partnering in the Castro, some thoughtful brewer has con-

BEER FOR THEMOSHPIT
The mosh pit is a bad-ass place that deserves a
bad-ass beer. The fact is, mosh pits seem to
have gone out of favor for a while, perhaps with
the advent of Ecstasy. Still, for the masochists among
us the mosh pit will always hold a raw appeal. As such,
may I recommend a raw beer.
There are several candidates for the ideal mosh-pit
beer. In second place comes Alimony Ale from across
the bay in Hayward, which advertises itself as "the bit
terest brew." Alimony Ale is as bitter and raw as they
get. It is also pretty disgusting to drink. So let us defer
to an atomic blast of a beer out of Mendocino, North
Coast: Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout.
Like the mosh pit, Old Rasputin is a full-body expe
rience. Chocolate, licorice, coffee, sour tastes like
lemon and lime and much more are packed in so
tightly that the beer hits you in the nose as well as the
tongue. Actually, adding flavors to beer is neither hard
nor uncommon — but what is hard and uncommon
is adding them correctly. One of the great superficial
ities in the California microbrew culture is the profu
sion of novelty brews, which throw in any random fla
vors (blueberry, white chocolate, hyacinth) and call it
innovation. Old Rasputin is the real thing, 25 great
tastes that taste great together. It packs a punch to the
final swig, just as Czar Nicholas would demand. But
beware: while fine for the mosh pit, Old Rasputin is
not for every venue. Its enormous alcoholic content
will get you so unsuspectingly loopy that you might
end up bumping into strangers around you — out
side of the mosh pit. Also, beware the hefty price of
the beer.

coded a beverage to match your activity. A well-chosen beer will
define your high, assign a taste to it, give it a gustatory dimension,
so to speak.
But beer is also for the bad times. Any problem you might have
at Stanford can be solved by beer. Failure at academics or failure
at love, insomnia or incontinence, suburban nausea or cultural
alienation — you name the malady, beer is the remedy. The truth
is, my friend, you don't have to spend hours chasing down a
Cowell psychologist or CTL seminar. The only energy you need to
expend is picking the right beer and putting it to your lips.
So let us get specific, take four of the great themes in the life of
a Stanford student and find the appropriate beer.

BEER FOR CAMPUS CORPORATIZATION
If it isn't logically provable, it's intuitive to us all:
almost everything that is produced on the mass
market is boring and usually corrupt in some way.
It follows that here at Nike University, here at the
school with the shopping mall, we would produce a
culture that is, indeed, somewhat boring and a little
corrupt. Where is the hooting and hollering on
Saturday nights, the chants of the counterculture?
Have they been muffled under the giant blanket of
campus corporatization?
To bring back the life, I recommend Bitburger Pils.
Bitburger is a rare cultural landmark: something
mainstream that doesn't suck. What a lesson Stanford
could learn from Bitburger. If you take the train from
my uncle's village in Westphalia into Cologne, when
you step out of the station you will immediately be
bombarded with a plaza full of outdoor umbrellas
perched lazily under a giant cathedral, umbrellas
which make a pitch for Germany's second best-selling
beer: "Bitte ein Bit!" I don't want to get too romantic
about the Old World, but it seems like over there the
things that people consume en masse are actually
sometimes the things that actually deserve to be con
sumed en masse.
Flowery smelling, gentle and malty initially,
Bitburger sort of opens up in youi mouth. You might
think you are drinking a garden: rosemary, parsley,
grassy hints linger long after the beer is down your
throat. The finish is full, but the experience as a whole
is soothing. The result is a quaffable beer, a beer which
lots of people can drink every day. This is mainstream
at its best, as only a great beer country would demand
it.

BEER FOR THE CLASSY NIGHT OUT IN
SAN FRANCISCO
O, to sport a just-ironed shirt. O, to wear
socks with your 'Stocks. 0, to head up to
the city for a night — perhaps the ballet,
the opera? Eh, govenuh? Yes, Stanford is such an
informal campus and so removed from old world
notions of high and low culture that actually get
ting dressed up and doing something classy is not
even classified as nerdy — just as novelty (kind of,
dare I say, like swing dancing).
I know what you are thinking: when things get
classy, wine is the clear choice. Well, my German
ancestry takes affront to such claims. In America,
beer, like blue jeans, has taken on a stigma of infor
mality. Fact is, out in Stuttgart they serve beer (and
wear jeans) even in the funf-stellen restaurants and
with good reason. The craft of beer-brewing is as
highly developed as that of wine, and with heavier
foods beer is sometimes the better complement.
Imagine a good porterhouse steak with red wine
and then with a Scottish Ale. There's some serious
competition.
So then: what is the right classy beer? Well, since
we are in the Fog City, let us limit ourselves to local
products — in fact, let us limit ourselves to Anchor
Old Foghorn. Most of us know Anchor, of course,
for their Liberty Ale, perhaps the best medium ale
made in America. Old Foghorn is their high-end
brew; if Liberty Ale were a 747, then Old Foghorn
is a Concorde, offering a ride of unparalleled qual
ity (at prices that are, admittedly, sky-high).
What makes Old Foghorn classy is its pungency.
It is a dark ale, dark because of an obviously well
developed mashing and malting process. As such,
when you drink it you have to purse your tongue a
little, a sort of reflexive response to the sourness,
which in some magic way concentrates all the fla
vor in the middle of your tongue. The result?
Woodiness, sandalwood and smoke, a salty finish
and a mixture of citrus flavors, grapefruit, lime,
perhaps even nectarine, all swirled into a base of
strong barley and hops. Old Foghorn is a rococo
beer, gold and embellished like the ceiling of an
18th-century palace. You'd better not drink it, how
ever, without putting something else in your stom
ach — good bread will do — to absorb some of the
taste. Old Foghorn is not just a beer but a craft
work. Dress well.

a populist appeal. Beer for procrastination can't
be beer-snob beer. No Martha's Vineyard brews
with names like Smuttynose, no Belgian ales like
Chimay at $5 a botde.
Moreover, beer for procrastination has to be a
slow-sipping beer. You don't chug while you're
procrastinating: you drink a little, then you get
up and do your laundry, then you drink a bit
more, then you surf the Net and so forth — for
hours on end. Beer for procrastination is beer
that moves at the pace of the procrastinator —
slow, slow, slower. A foam that gathers cautiously
at the top and then steeps its way down the face
of the glass. A beer so thick and rich that it phys
ically forbids you drinking more than a mouthful
at once.
As a beer for procrastination, I pick Steelhead
Extra Stout. We discovered Steelhead over at Chi
Theta Chi after making a special mission to
Beverages 8c More just to try out all the local
stouts. Steelhead won hands down. It's very thick
and very simple too, tinged mostly with bitter
nuts and coffee. Although it's a Blue Lake micro
brew (read: yuppie), its strength forbids it from
being a beer-snob beer and instead is the beer
world's equivalent of a raucous night out bowling
with the guys when you should be home sleeping
for work the next day. Steelhead Extra Stout is a
drink for the toughest among us — its name,
after all, contains the words "steel" and "stout."
Now that's populist appeal.

ro everything there is a season and a heer. A simple notion,
perhaps one that you find doubtful For no foodstuff is so
versatile that it compliments every occasion, right?
Well perhaps you are right. There are indeed one or two times
when even beer does not belong, like right before you drive your
car (or, notably at Stanford, your bike). But I think we can say this:
beer adds panache to more of life's moments than just about any
thing else you can ingest.
Beer; for example, is for the good times. From swing dancing to
drug experimentation, from study partnering at the CoHo to
other partnering in the Castro, some thoughtful brewer has con-

BEER FOR THEMOSHPIT
The mosh pit is a bad-ass place that deserves a
bad-ass beer. The fact is, mosh pits seem to
have gone out of favor for a while, perhaps with
the advent of Ecstasy. Still, for the masochists among
us the mosh pit will always hold a raw appeal. As such,
may I recommend a raw beer.
There are several candidates for the ideal mosh-pit
beer. In second place comes Alimony Ale from across
the bay in Hayward, which advertises itself as "the bit
terest brew." Alimony Ale is as bitter and raw as they
get. It is also pretty disgusting to drink. So let us defer
to an atomic blast of a beer out of Mendocino, North
Coast: Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout.
Like the mosh pit, Old Rasputin is a full-body expe
rience. Chocolate, licorice, coffee, sour tastes like
lemon and lime and much more are packed in so
tightly that the beer hits you in the nose as well as the
tongue. Actually, adding flavors to beer is neither hard
nor uncommon — but what is hard and uncommon
is adding them correctly. One of the great superficial
ities in the California microbrew culture is the profu
sion of novelty brews, which throw in any random fla
vors (blueberry, white chocolate, hyacinth) and call it
innovation. Old Rasputin is the real thing, 25 great
tastes that taste great together. It packs a punch to the
final swig, just as Czar Nicholas would demand. But
beware: while fine for the mosh pit, Old Rasputin is
not for every venue. Its enormous alcoholic content
will get you so unsuspectingly loopy that you might
end up bumping into strangers around you — out
side of the mosh pit. Also, beware the hefty price of
the beer.

coded a beverage to match your activity. A well-chosen beer will
define your high, assign a taste to it, give it a gustatory dimension,
so to speak.
But beer is also for the bad times. Any problem you might have
at Stanford can be solved by beer. Failure at academics or failure
at love, insomnia or incontinence, suburban nausea or cultural
alienation — you name the malady, beer is the remedy. The truth
is, my friend, you don't have to spend hours chasing down a
Cowell psychologist or CTL seminar. The only energy you need to
expend is picking the right beer and putting it to your lips.
So let us get specific, take four of the great themes in the life of
a Stanford student and find the appropriate beer.

BEER FOR CAMPUS CORPORATIZATION
If it isn't logically provable, it's intuitive to us all:
almost everything that is produced on the mass
market is boring and usually corrupt in some way.
It follows that here at Nike University, here at the
school with the shopping mall, we would produce a
culture that is, indeed, somewhat boring and a little
corrupt. Where is the hooting and hollering on
Saturday nights, the chants of the counterculture?
Have they been muffled under the giant blanket of
campus corporatization?
To bring back the life, I recommend Bitburger Pils.
Bitburger is a rare cultural landmark: something
mainstream that doesn't suck. What a lesson Stanford
could learn from Bitburger. If you take the train from
my uncle's village in Westphalia into Cologne, when
you step out of the station you will immediately be
bombarded with a plaza full of outdoor umbrellas
perched lazily under a giant cathedral, umbrellas
which make a pitch for Germany's second best-selling
beer: "Bitte ein Bit!" I don't want to get too romantic
about the Old World, but it seems like over there the
things that people consume en masse are actually
sometimes the things that actually deserve to be con
sumed en masse.
Flowery smelling, gentle and malty initially,
Bitburger sort of opens up in youi mouth. You might
think you are drinking a garden: rosemary, parsley,
grassy hints linger long after the beer is down your
throat. The finish is full, but the experience as a whole
is soothing. The result is a quaffable beer, a beer which
lots of people can drink every day. This is mainstream
at its best, as only a great beer country would demand
it.

BEER FOR THE CLASSY NIGHT OUT IN
SAN FRANCISCO
O, to sport a just-ironed shirt. O, to wear
socks with your 'Stocks. 0, to head up to
the city for a night — perhaps the ballet,
the opera? Eh, govenuh? Yes, Stanford is such an
informal campus and so removed from old world
notions of high and low culture that actually get
ting dressed up and doing something classy is not
even classified as nerdy — just as novelty (kind of,
dare I say, like swing dancing).
I know what you are thinking: when things get
classy, wine is the clear choice. Well, my German
ancestry takes affront to such claims. In America,
beer, like blue jeans, has taken on a stigma of infor
mality. Fact is, out in Stuttgart they serve beer (and
wear jeans) even in the funf-stellen restaurants and
with good reason. The craft of beer-brewing is as
highly developed as that of wine, and with heavier
foods beer is sometimes the better complement.
Imagine a good porterhouse steak with red wine
and then with a Scottish Ale. There's some serious
competition.
So then: what is the right classy beer? Well, since
we are in the Fog City, let us limit ourselves to local
products — in fact, let us limit ourselves to Anchor
Old Foghorn. Most of us know Anchor, of course,
for their Liberty Ale, perhaps the best medium ale
made in America. Old Foghorn is their high-end
brew; if Liberty Ale were a 747, then Old Foghorn
is a Concorde, offering a ride of unparalleled qual
ity (at prices that are, admittedly, sky-high).
What makes Old Foghorn classy is its pungency.
It is a dark ale, dark because of an obviously well
developed mashing and malting process. As such,
when you drink it you have to purse your tongue a
little, a sort of reflexive response to the sourness,
which in some magic way concentrates all the fla
vor in the middle of your tongue. The result?
Woodiness, sandalwood and smoke, a salty finish
and a mixture of citrus flavors, grapefruit, lime,
perhaps even nectarine, all swirled into a base of
strong barley and hops. Old Foghorn is a rococo
beer, gold and embellished like the ceiling of an
18th-century palace. You'd better not drink it, how
ever, without putting something else in your stom
ach — good bread will do — to absorb some of the
taste. Old Foghorn is not just a beer but a craft
work. Dress well.

BEER FOR PROCRASTINATION
There's something objectionable about the
person who doesn't procrastinate. You
know who I'm talking about: that interna
tional student next door who wakes up at 7 a.m.
everyday and bikes to La Honda and alphabetizes
his CD collection. Those people, they're not like
the rest of us. They're the ones who are actually
on top of things.
Procrastination, you see, is one of the great
populist trademarks at Stanford. It's what we the
masses do, it's the signifier of the in-group, it's
inexhaustible fodder for conversation — the
great bonding mechanism of Stanford.
"I pulled an all-nighter last night, I was screw
ing around all week."
"Oh yeah, well I pulled two all-nighters in a
row— I'm on my third wind man!"
"Whatever, I haven't slept since March."
We've all been party to this repartee.
So any beer for the procrastinator has to have
a populist appeal. Beer for procrastination can't
be beer-snob beer. No Martha's Vineyard brews
with names like Smuttynose, no Belgian ales like
