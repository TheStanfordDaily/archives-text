# THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEW
## MUSIC The 						Tight Bro's From Way Back When Runnin' Thru My Bones (Kill Rock Stars) 
### 
/TX ock 'n' roll, man, rock 'n' roll. There's
Creally nothing more that I need to
Is say about this record, but since I
need to fill this column, I'll elaborate a bit
Much like the concurrent retro trend in the
metal scene in which a glut of bands are now
paying tribute to — and often outright ripping
off — their late '60s / early '70s forefathers
Black Sabbath, Olympia, Wash.'s Tight Bro's
From Way Back When are leading the revival

in the punk / indie scene with this
salute to punk pioneers MCS and the
Stooges — who hail, coincidentally,
from the same era as Black Sabbath.
The tunes on "Runnin' Thru My
Bones" — the Bros debut release —
recall a time before there really was
anything officially called "punk;" it's
just music played with such manic
reckless energy that it can't simply be
called rock.
The Tight Bros From Way Back
When is a sort of supergroup of the
current Pacific Northwest indie scene,
as its members are quite well-known
for their previous musical exploits. The
band features Jared Warren — former
singer and bassist of the sadly now
defunct, criminally talented Karp and
currently in Fashio —on vocals, on
guitar duties John "Quitty" Quittner
from the Mukilteo Fairies and Dave ???
(both are in Behead the Prophet No
Lord Shall Live — extra bonus points if
you can guess which death metal band
they stole their name from!), as well as
Justin Olsen on drums and Sean Kelly
on bass. These guys are clearly having a
great time playing while managing to
be quite tongue-in-cheek about their
rather hyperbolic rock 'n' roll antics.
The heavy rock humor and irony is evi
dent from the band's logo — a virtual
spitting image of the MCs's emblem
— the album cover — a literal instiga
tion to raise one's hands to rock — and
such lyrical gems as, "Be-bop-a-lu
bop-a-bobitty-be / You come and see
me, and 1 think you'll agree!" and,
"Woohoo! Yeah! Etc!! / Hayseed
Rockin'! / Honkeytonk Stompin'!" My
favorite song intro: "Are you ready? I'll
take that as a yes!" on "Rip it Up."
Most songs are upbeat and ener-

getic, and they totally shred with a
great raw guitar sound. When the
band slows it down, like on the
appropriately titled, "Strut," it
pulls off a nice, sleazy bluesrock
vibe complete with harmonica.
And when Jared yelps, "For your
love!" on "Workin Overtime,"
you'll swear he's Robert Plant. If
you're not careful you might think
you're listening to your old cock
rock tapes from back in the day
such as Cinderella, Poison, Slade
or AC/DC, but then, I guess that's
the point. Christ, I really don't
know how else to convince you
that you need to buy this immedi
ately, short of walloping you over
the head with the mic stand.
Would it be redundant to say this
rocks?
