# WHAT IS GAMELAN?

### Wendy Yao editorial staff 
word gamelan (pronounced gah-meh-
Llan) means "to hammer," but the term refers
to the large percussion orchestras of Java
and Bali, Indonesia. Gamelan musicians use various
percussion instruments to create their layered, intri
cate, trance-like soundscapes, including gongs, metal
lophones and hand drums, as well as cymbals, vocals,
bamboo flutes and spiked fiddles. There are many types
of gamelans in Bali, ranging from large metal orches
tras to bamboo ensembles, vocal groups and groups
dedicated to the imitation of frog sounds. Believe it or
not, Indonesian music has been highly influential to
modern Western music in the last few decades; artists
have crossed this traditional music form with contem
porary styles such as jazz, artsy-minimalism, classical,
psychedelia and electronica to create new sound
hybrids that — when good — retain gamelan's myste
rious, oddly beautiful qualities.
The Club Foot and Gamelan Sekar Jaya orchestras
have a show coming up this weekend at the Castro
Theater. Both orchestras are collaborating on the score
for a recently restored silent Balinese film called "La
Gong." It was the last silent film Hollywood produced,
filmed in two-strip Technicolor on location in Bali.
Members of the Club Foot Orchestra (including Beth
Custer) as well as the Gamelan Sekar Jaya will be per
forming the score live. Each screening will be followed
by a performance of the dance "Legong Kronton" by
Gamelan Sekar Jaya's dancers. Get hip to it!!
