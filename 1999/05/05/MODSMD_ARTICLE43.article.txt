### Wenhsin Lee Contributing Writer 
yrf re you suffering from kidney rash after not see-
C\y ing your boyfriend for two days? Is that girl in
your life complaining about not having enough
S&M in your relationship?
Bring your love woes and concerns to the experts: Dr.
Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla of MTV's acclaimed
"Loveline." The famous pair will be bringing their act to
Frost Amphitheater on Saturday to answer Stanford stu
dents' questions about sex, drugs and relationships.
"The goal of the show, first and foremost, is education
and secondly, to help people as much as we possibly can,"
says Pinsky, a certified medical doctor who received his train
ing at USC School of Medicine before becoming chief resi
dent there. For the past 14 years, Pinsky has been answering
questions and giving advice as a radio call-in expert on the
"Loveline" talk show.
The other half of "Loveline" is stand-up comedian Adam
Carolla, who is largely known for his politically incorrect and
opinionated banter. Carolla simply claims, "My job is to
entertain." Carolla's comedic roots date back to his days
working with the Groundling and Acme Improv groups in

Los Angeles, before he joined "Loveline."
Every weeknight on MTV's "Loveline," Dr. Drew and
Carolla spend an hour answering questions from the mem
bers of the studio audience and from viewers around the
country via telephone, fax and e-mail. Questions span such
issues as teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, sui
cide and sexual dysfunction.
"Loveline" has been a breakthrough hit for MTV, and the
show attracts celebrities who appear as guests on the show to
add their own personal insights.
Together Dr. Drew and Carolla have published a book and
have toured campuses around the country. Marc Mitchell of
the Stanford Concert Network said, "They have wanted to
come to Stanford for a long time, and it finally worked out
for us."
Mitchell claims that the event will be an excellent oppor
tunity to put on a show in the Frost Amphitheater at a low
ticket price for students. He said, "This show directly appeals
to the college crowd; I encourage students to come out and
have a good time."
