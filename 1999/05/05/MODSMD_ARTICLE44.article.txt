# METALLICA AND THE SF SYMPHONY
## April 22 at the Berkeley Community Theatre 
### Elliott Lange Contributing Writer 
his is a pretty tough review for me. How can I
C>y describe my feelings about what was once the
greatest band on earth, that has now fallen so
far musically? I can not help but be biased toward any
thing involving Metallica. Throughout my junior-high
days I worshipped Metallica with a reverence that would
humble the Pope, cherishing the group's first four
albums more than life itself. But I will never forget that
sultry August day in 1991 when Metallica thought it
would be a good idea to release the "Black" album, the
most disappointing day in the history of my record-buy
ing career. Yeah, yeah, I know, everyone and their moth
er loves that album, it catapulted them into unbelievably
phenomenal success, etc. — everyone knows the story —
but the music was so subpar in comparison to the band's
own standards that I could not believe the band would
even dare still call itself Metallica. I won't even comment
on the rest of the band's '90s output — "Load" and
"Reload" are simply too far gone to even be taken seri
ously.
So, you may ask, why go to a Metallica show, you neg
ative naysayer? Well, I managed to score free tickets for
one thing. But the real reason is that despite how much 1
want to hate 'em, Metallica is still one kick-ass awesome
live band. Every time I see them I think for sure, this is
the time I will boo throughout their set, chanting "Metal
Militia," when they try to play "Nothing Else Matters."
But each time, I'm left totally floored, banging my head,
waving the ol' devil horns and singing along to every
(old) song. Because despite the private-jet-flying, short
hair-wearing rock stars that the band members have
become, they're still good, old-fashioned rednecks at
heart, hamming it up with the audience and delivering a
solid, energetic show.
And I just couldn't miss the opportunity to see this
somewhat historic event — the first performance of its
kind, combining the heaviest "big" band in the world
with a world-class symphony. The novelty of such an odd
pairing is somewhat diminished for anyone who's heard
the group Apocalyptica, a Swedish cello quartet, whose

albums consist primarily of Metallica covers, redone as
classical compositions. In fact, it's a bit curious this con
cert occurred when it did, as the Swedish group has been
garnering a fair amount of prestige in the underground
scene lately, making Metallica almost appear to be cover
ing a band covering itself.
On to the show. We arrived at the Berkeley
Community Theatre, which I believe is Berkeley High
School's theater, just before showtime, only to wait, of
course, for the show to start fashionably half an hour late.
The Theatre was immaculate, a pristine concert hall
clearly more accustomed to the symphony than rock
bands, which would explain why the acoustics in the hall
were simply unsuitable for the incessant uproar of
applause from the crowd, not to mention the volume of
Metallica.
Definitely one of my favorite parts of the show was
simply watching the interaction between the crowd —
almost completely comprised of Metallica fans — and
the Theatre staff. The ushers were formally dressed, well
mannered young ladies and gentlemen, whose duty it
was to politely assist the ragingly drunk crowd to their
seats and kindly request that they abstain from repeated
ly jumping into the aisles, kicking and screaming.
The symphony first began with the brief instrumental
intro that Metallica has used to open its shows for years.
Then, leaving such embittered old-time fans as myself
with jaws firmly floored, the symphony moved right into
Metallica's first instrumental opus, "Call of Ktulu," from
its 1984 masterpiece "Ride the Lightning."
From the moment that lead guitarist Kirk Hammett
appeared on stage, playing the opening arpeggio, the
crowd went absolutely ape-shit. They couldn't have
picked a more appropriate opener, as the band members
gradually appeared one by one with the whole sympho
ny playing behind them. From this, they launched right
into "Master of Puppets," which of course had the entire
crowd banging heads in unison and chanting "Master!"
The evening was very clearly a Metallica show, with the
symphony acting more as a support act rather than a full
collaboration, which was a bit disappointing. Here they
had this chance to create some unique interplay between
violin and guitar, yet, for the most part, it seemed the

symphony was held in check most of the night. For musi
cians as talented as they obviously are, it seemed the sym
phony players weren't allowed to fully demonstrate their
abilities, instead playing mostly simple melodies behind
the band. And the volume control was pretty ridiculous.
Even with the whole symphony miked — which 1 under
stand is a cardinal sin — the symphony was often just
barely audible underneath the roar of Metallica, especial
ly Lars Ulrich's goddamn bass drum.
Still, though, most of the collaborative songs were
quite effective, often substantially changing the original
song structure, usually in a good way. Further highlights
include: "The Thing that Should Not Be," one of my all
time favorite songs that they never play; "For Whom the
Bell Tolls;" "Of Wolf and Man," also a rare live song;
"Wherever I May Roam;" as well as two brand new songs
— "No Leaf Clover" and "Human" — both written with
the symphony and thus reflecting a much more fluid mix
of the two groups. Obviously, I could've done without
the abundance of crap from the band's last two albums,
which aside from my personal prejudices, just didn't mix
well with the orchestra. But the finale of "One" and
"Enter Sandman," with a final encore of "Battery," made
up for any drags in the program. The ending was also
hilarious, as the horn section stood up, pumping their
fists and waving their French horns in the air in response
to the fervent crowd, most likely a first for a symphony
audience.
So what can I say? Sure, the feet that this concert was
recorded, filmed, had $45 T-shirts and will probably end
up on MTV eventually does nothing to suggest that
Metallica is moving in any direction but further acceler
ating up the path of mega-super duper-stardom. But
hey, that's OK. I've long since given up hope that
Metallica will ever write another "Master of Puppets,"
and I suppose as long as I can still see them play the old
songs live —at ridiculously inflated ticket prices, of
course — it's better than nothing. So although you'd
sooner catch me buying an *N Sync record than one of
Metallica's new albums, I still had a helluva time at the
Berkeley Theatre, and it still proves that if any band has
to be multi-billionaires, Metallica is most deserving.

"Enter Sandman," with a final encore of "Battery," made
up for any drags in the program. The ending was also
hilarious, as the horn section stood up, pumping their
fists and waving their French horns in the air in response
to the fervent crowd, most likely a first for a symphony
audience.
So what can I say? Sure, the feet that this concert was
recorded, filmed, had $45 T-shirts and will probably end
up on MTV eventually does nothing to suggest that
Metallica is moving in any direction but further acceler
ating up the path of mega-super duper-stardom. But
hey, that's OK. I've long since given up hope that
Metallica will ever write another "Master of Puppets,"
and I suppose as long as I can still see them play the old
songs live —at ridiculously inflated ticket prices, of
course — it's better than nothing. So although you'd
sooner catch me buying an *N Sync record than one of
Metallica's new albums, I still had a helluva time at the
Berkeley Theatre, and it still proves that if any band has
to be multi-billionaires, Metallica is most deserving.
