# 'ELECTION'
## FILM Forget Monica — this is a wholesome, Midwestern scandal 
### 
lection" is about political scandal, per
sonal frustration and the perils of power.
Considering the auspicious honors 1999
has held in the political arena, one of the following
must be true: either art actually does imi te life, or
those movie studio people have really go I timing.
Whatever the message, "Election" ia a smart

comic satire with
a lot of spotlights
to shine on am
bition, power
and the people
who wield it.
Putting the scan
dal in school,
director

Alexander Payne
poses the question of whether ambition is the
product of nature or nurture with a wacky but pol
ished hand.
Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is the bearer of
this proud and determined yoke: she may be the
school goody-goody, she may not be the daughter
of privilege, and she may even have had an affair
with one of her high school's teachers, but nothing
will stand between her and her Omaha, Neb., high
school's student council presidency.
Teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick),on
the other hand, is the antithesis of this lust for
glory: He's been voted teacher of the year three
years in a row out of his near-decade long career at
the high school. He has a nice wife, a nice house, a
nice life. He used to have a best friend (before the
friend had an affair with said Tracy and got fired).

And doggone it, he deserves it.
So what happens to make Mr. McAllister, also
the student council faculty adviser, drop everything
to find an opposing candidate for the unopposed
Tracy? Call it a desire for unencumbered democra
cy, call it an energy displacement of all his life's ills
into his work, call it personal revenge. But before
you can say "grass roots," Mr. McAllister's advising
becomes an obsession to see Tracy's ambition oblit
erated, with twisted, wonderful, hilarious results.
One of the highlights of this tremendously witty
film is its cast — Broderick and Witherspoon make
for first-class comic opponents, wrestling for pow
er and authority with an over-the-top tenacity which
is too high-strung to be

true but too desper
ate to be totally
false. A slew of new
comers brings up
the rear, including
Chris Klein as
Tracy's befuddled
opposing candidate
Paul Metzler, Jessica
Campbell as his sex
ually confused and
defiant sister Tam
my and Mark
Harelik as Dave
Novotny, the first,
but certainly not
the last, romantic
casualty to be
seduced, used and

tossed aside in Tracy Flick's battle to reach the top.
Based on a novel by Tom Perotta, "Election"
takes the back-stabbing chaos of the "real" political
world and makes it not only wrenchingly funny but
unnervingly relevant.
Chances are we all knew a Tracy Flick in high
school — here is her story in unflinchingly sharp
dialogue and clever camera tricks.
Enjoy watching: the real Tracy Flicks aren't at all
as fun to deal with.
