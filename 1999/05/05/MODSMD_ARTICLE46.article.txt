# COOL FOR LOVE
## A 						lovers' 'Circle' of coincidence 
### 
s* yfl overs of the Arctic Circle," a foreign film directed by
Julio Medem, is a romance set in a surrealistic world
•" where coincidence and fate are all-powerful forces
capable of twisting reality and making the most improbable
events commonplace. The story revolves around Otto and
Ana, two schoolchildren who seem to understand the power
of coincidences in this world and allow their lives to be guid
ed by them.
Otto is a young idealist who has a passion for both flight
and eternal love. He meets Ana in the forest behind the
schoolyard and feels drawn to her almost immediately. In
order to meet her again, Otto makes several paper airplanes,
each with a profession of love, and tosses them over to the
girls' side of the gender-segregated school. Through a complex
chain of events, one of these airplanes leads to a relationship
between Ana's mother and Otto's father, bringing Otto and
Ana together as step-siblings.
Otto and Ana openly reject their assigned roles as step-sib
lings, but each has a secret need for the other. Ana sees Otto as
a reflection of her father, who had just died a few days earlier,
while Otto harbors a secret love for Ana. When they become
adolescents, Ana discovers Otto's love for her, and they begin
a romantic relationship.
Otto and Ana manage to keep this relationship secret for
several years, though they often publicly hint at it in a series of
rather humorous scenes. However, Otto's love for Ana leads
him to spend less time with his mother, who becomes very
lonely and eventually commits suicide.
When Otto learns of his mother's death, he becomes filled
with guilt and runs away from the family to fulfill his dream
of becoming a pilot. He takes a job as an airmail courier
between Spain and Finland. Ana goes on with her life in
Spain, but the forces of coincidence repeatedly draw her to

Otto.
The feel of
this movie was
very different
from the typi
cal big-studio
American
movie; the plot
has so many

metaphors, paral
lels and hidden connections that I found myself constantly
analyzing every event, rather than passively sitting back and
simply watching. As a result of this, I felt closely engaged with
the movie, making the whole experience much more intense.
The story is also told in a very unusual manner; the film is
divided into pairs of 15-minute segments, each of which pre
sents Otto's or Ana's perspectives on the same sequence of
events. Through this presentation style, we are able to experi
ence their very different personalities and ways of thinking.
Unfortunately, the section of the movie immediately before
the climax was a bit of a let-down. The developments were a
little too slow and predictable, and the intensity of the movie
began to drop off. For a little while, the metaphors and coin
cidences which had made the movie so fascinating earlier
became almost corny.
Despite this weak section, the movie as a whole was quite
enjoyable and reaffirmed my faith in love. (I tend to be picky
about romances.) I would not hesitate to see it again, if only
to sort through the complex web of interactions and recur
rences.
