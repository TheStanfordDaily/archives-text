a darkened room, a man has one
112 W hand on his phone. He presses the
receiver harder to his ear as the
woman's voice describes what she is doing to
him in blush-worthy detail. Visions of the kinky,
half-dressed co-ed he saw in the ad float through
his head. Three hundred miles away, the woman
adjusts her curlers and irons a tablecloth as she
brings him to climax.
Most of us have seen this scenario before, but
we never stop to consider how much truth it
contains. For as popular as phone sex is, we
know relatively little about the business or the
women behind it Even Miss Sass has had little
experience in this area, with the one call she
made when she was 16 resulting in a fit of giggles
rather than titillatlpn. So to find out more, she
went to the source?uamely, phone sex operators.
Finding phone £jx operators without calling
their numbers is not as hard as you might think,
given the magic of die World Wide Web. Miss
Sass e-mailed several ladies after finding;
addresses on their Web sites and received a cou
ple of responses. The first response proved "k
harsh lesson in job dissatisfaction, with most of
the answers ending in phrases like "What do yott
expect? Men are pigs.** Now, Miss Sass will wager
that many of the men this lady encounters are
exceptional in their porcine likenesses. But she
also knows that men in general are amiable char
acters, so she chose not to share that interview
with you, dear readers.
The second response, however, contained a
much more pleasant view of the phone sex
industry from a 32-year-old operator named
Toni. Toni happily shared her job expertise with
Miss Sass, who now passes it along for your
information.
Roxy Sass: How did you get into the phone
sex business?
Toni: I was out of work, and we were buying
a home. A friend of mine worked for a service,
and she said she could get me a job there. She
did, and 1 was very good at it right from the start.
RS: So this is your only job? How much time
do you spend doing phone sex each week?
T: This is all I do, and 1 am very dedicated. I
work 24 / 7.
RS: It must be strange constantly talking
about sex with strangers. How did you get used
to doing it?
T: After four years, most of my guys are not
strangers. Plus, I am a very easy person to talk to,
a good listener. Guys usually open up to me.
RS: Four years? Good Heavens. How long do
you see yourself doing thisf
T: As long as 1 am able, I guess. Do you ever
ask a doctor how long he plans to practice med
icine?
RS: No, but it seems talking about sex all the
time would be tedious. Of course, I would imag
ine you get weird calls to keep things interest
ing. What is the strangest call you've gotten?
T: One guy wanted me to describe him having
sex with cheese!

RS: Hmm. Miss Sass will leave
that one alone. Here's something
that a lot of people wonder: Do
the pictures in the ads have any
connection with the actual
women who do the talking?

T: My site, www.toni.com, is just an advertise
ment, not my picture. Most of the girls who have
lines don't use their pics, but some lie and say
they do. I e-mail the callers my picture after we
talk, because I think I'm pretty attractive. I'm 5
feet 3 inches tall and 120 pounds — not a super
model but very attractive.
RS: So that kind of deception is the downside
of phone sex. What is the upshot?
Tt I think phone sex is very important. It not
only allows a man to live out fantasies he might
not have been able to do with a girlfriend or wife
but also lets him stay faithful at times he might
not have been otherwise. I always encourage
men to be true to their women, and luckily, the
only thing they might catch from me is "hearing
AIDS."
Bad puns aside, Miss Sass thanks Toni for let
ting us go behind the scenes. Now, should you
ever want to actually call a phone sex line, Miss
Sass will offer you a few tips of her own. First,
you have to decide how much time (and there
fore how much money) you're going to spend on
the call. You can choose either to pay by the
minute, which is the way for most sites you've
probably seen advertised, or you can pay a flat
rate per call. The fetter costs around $20 while
per-minute charges range from $1.50 to $4, so
do a little math to figure out which is more cost
effective for you.
Secondly, take control of the call. It's your
dime (or rather, dollar) so you should steer the
operator towards what you want her to talk
about. Specify your fantasy, be it cheese or some
thing else, so you'll get your money's worth.
Third, a note on politeness. Miss Sass knows
that you, dear reader, are a paragon of courtesy
and that you will treat your operator with the
utmost chivalry. However, should she start to
moan and holler like your conversation is push
ing her to new realms of desire, exercise caution.
It is highly dubious that her orgasm is in earnest,
and waiting for her to finish will only drive up
your bilL
Speaking of bills, the cheapest phone sex of all
has yet to be mentioned — that between you
and your partner. Long-distance lovers have long
relied on sex by wire to keep their libidos toasty
and tame, but you don't have to be bi-continen
tal to enjoy a verbal volley. Just dial up your beau
or belle and let fly with your thoughts on his or
her body, your bed or whatever else comes to
mind. As for vocab, stick to words you feel com
fortable with. Phrases involving the words
"member," "succulent" or "pump" will amuse
rather than thrill. Beyond that, it's up to your
imagination, so pull out that calling card and get
to work.
