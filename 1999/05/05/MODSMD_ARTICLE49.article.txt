In our quest to find good local Italian food, we ventured
to restaurant-rich Menlo Park. Tucked away on Santa Cruz
Avenue, Scala Mia seemed from the naked eye to fit the bill
as one's ideal small Italian restaurant. Though it provides a
small outside "cafe-style" dining area, the inside dÂ£cor is
what impressed us the most. This long, narrow restaurant in
the shape of a cannolli gave one the feel of eating in the fam
ily environment of "La Cosa Nostra."
The walls and ceilings were painted in a sponged fresco
style. A salmon color was utilized to bring about maximum
relaxation to the diner. The cherubim and harps on the ceil
ings enhanced the Sistine Chapelness of the restaurant Due
to the business of the restaurant that night, we were not
afforded the opportunity to eat at a booth but were relegat
ed to a small table. Even with the small dishes, we were forced
to continually rearrange our table for four in order to make
everything fit. The cramped confines were not just an issue
on the table but also for the area around us, which kept us
from enjoying our food to its fullest extent.
While we found the food to be quite good, the service left
much to be desired. Due to the location of our table in the
middle of the restaurant, we were constantly being bumped
into by the waiters and busboys who were trying to weave
their way around us. Our No. 1 suggestion if you choose to
dine at Scala Mia is either to request a booth or to wear
padding. Speaking Italian wouldn't hurt either.
The menu has a nice variety of pasta and meat dishes for
both appetizers and entrees. While we eyed the menu, we
enjoyed the restaurant's delicious fresh baked bread and olive
oil and garlic butter alternative. David started with a cold
mushroom and bleu cheese hors d'oeuvre. The vegetables
tasted fresh and the bleu cheese was delicious, just the way it
should be. Adrien began with simple vegetable ravioli in a
pink sauce. The combination of mariani sauce and creamy
Alfredo brought out the taste of the vegetable-filled pasta.
As for the main courses, David and Adrien both decided
to have pasta. David enjoyed meat-filled tortellini in a cream
sauce. Though the menu claimed the sauce was light, this
critic would beg to differ. With that caveat in mind, David
would recommend this dish. Adrien, who is a huge lover of
gnocchi with a four-cheese sauce, decided to broaden his
gnocchi horizon. He mustered enough courage to try pesto
sauce gnocchi. Though it was extremely good, nothing can
hit the spot like the creamy-sauced gnocchi can. All of this
food left no room for dessert (like we needed the extra calo
ries anyway).
Though the location of our table may have been a major
contributing factor to the bad service, that doesn't change
the fact that such service greatly detracted from the quality of
our meal. We were happy to find good Italian food, but we
limped away from the meal battered and bruised.
