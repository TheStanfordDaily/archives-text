Described by a colleague in the
oncology division as a "very bright,
energetic, thoughtful investigator,"
Prof. Ronald Levy, chief of oncolo
gy at the Medical School, was re
cently honored by the General Mo
tors Cancer Research Foundation
for his contributions to cancer re
search and treatment.
Levy received the Foundation's
Charles F. Kettering Prize, which
recognizes the most outstanding re
cent contribution to the diagnosis
or treatment of cancer. Levy was
honored for demonstrating that
monoclonal antibodies can shrink

tumors in patients with B cell lym
phomas.
The award, which is a cash award
of $25().(X)() for research, is one of
the most prestigious in the field of
medicine. To date. General Motors
Cancer Research Foundation has
awarded more than a total of $9 mil
lion to 83 scientists, in an effort to
focus attention on cancer research.
Seven winners have subsequently
won Nobel prizes.
The reaction of his colleagues in
the oncology division has been ec
static. Emeritus Prof. Saul Rosen
berg said, "We are very, very
pleased that Dr. Levy has been
given this special recognition. He

combines the best of science and
clinical medicine. He has devoted
most of his studies to the under
standing of B cell lymphomas, and
as an immunologist he has helped
unravel the nature of these malig
nancies."
Levy received his bachelor's de
gree from Harvard University and
his doctorate from Stanford. His
commitment to the study of cancer
was the result of his close work at
the Medical School with Prof.
Henry Kaplan, the first Kettering
Prize winner, and Rosenberg.
Levy said, "When I came to
Stanford as a medical student I
started working with Dr. Kaplan
and his colleague Dr. Rosenberg."
" These doctors had made
tremendous breakthroughs in the
treatment of Hogkins disease, and
they got me interested in the field
of cancer. I was also very interested
in the immune system and these
men, along with Dr. Feldman were
my role models," he added.
Levy's passion for cancer re
search and the immune system pro
duced dramatic results in I ML
when he and his colleagues report
ed their iirst patient success with
the new technique. Despite this
achievement. Levy did not expect
to be the recipient of the Kettering
Prize. "The award was a total sur
prise to me. 11 was something I did
not expect. 1 did not even know
they were considering me."
Rosenberg indicated that Levy's
research has had a great impact on
the treatment of lymphoma. He
said, "lie has applied his knowl
edge of lymphoma to not only the

understanding but also the treat
ment of this condition. For the first
time, there are now treatments that
are effective in combating this low
grade lymphoma."
Levy said he believes the award
will affect his research by raising
the profile of his field. He said,
"This award will add more recogni
tion to the field we work in and the
work that we have done. It will also
raise the level of interest in the pro
jects we are working on."
Currently Levy, who works with
his wife, Prof. Shoshana Levy, is fo
cusing his work on cancer vaccines.
He said "developing vaccines is the
future of cancer research." Shoshana
Levy agreed but added, "Vaccines
will be part of the momentum need
ed to combat some types of cancer,
but it can't be the only tool."
When asked how he became in
terested in medicine, Ronald Levy
remarked, "I was an undergradu
ate majoring in chemistry, and
someone said I would make a good
doctor." His colleagues in the on
cology department and the patients
whose lives have been saved
through his discoveries might term
this a remarkable understatement.
