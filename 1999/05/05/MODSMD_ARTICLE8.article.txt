# Layoffs cause concern in Menlo Park
## City Council opts not to oppose job cuts, sends letter urging attention to patient care 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial Staff 
In response to the first wave of
layoffs at UCSF-Stanford Health
Care hospitals, the Menlo Park
City C ouncil called for Mayor Paul
Collacehi to write u letter to the
heads of USHC expressing concern
over patient care.
The decision to write a letter
came after USHC workers asked
city council members to issue a res
olution against the layoffs.
However, City Manager Jan
Doland said, "some confusion ex
isted over the financial report" and
;is a result council members de
clined to issue a resolution against

the layoffs.
"We had a consensus feeling
that a letter would convey the
council's concern," Doland said.
"We want it to be known that we
are concerned about the health
issue."
As a result of an unexpected
$10.7 million shortfall, USHC will
eliminate more than 2.000 posi
tions. USHC spokesman Michael
Lassiter said most of the cutbacks
will be made in administrative
areas. Current estimates call fora 9
percent reduction in the number of
staff members who provide direct
patient care.
Eliminating positions will lower
the employees per occupied bed

ratio. According to USHC, its em
ployee per bed ratio will decrease
from approximately 7.9 toward the
5.5 ratio seen at comparable insti
tutions.
Critics of the layoffs contend
that patient care will be affected by
the layoffs.
"We understand people's con
cern," Lassiter said, "but we have
no choice. We have to act or we will
be in worse financial trouble."
The Menlo Park City Council is
not the only governmental body to
express concern over the layoffs at
USHC. The San Francisco Board
of Supervisors passed a resolution
opposing layoffs at USHC and
called for full disclosure of all fi

nancial records and the investiga
tion of alternatives to layoffs.
"We have offered to discuss the
financial statement with any group
and explain the situation," Lassiter
said.
While Menlo Park officials de
cided against passing the resolution
against layoffs, further actions on
the part of USHC could prompt ad
ditional actions on the part of the
council.
" The issue could come back, it
depends on further action taken,"
Doland said.
Lassiter and Doland concurred
that they had received little public
feedback about the council's ac
tions.
