# Stanford will be ready for 2000
## Task force claims computers won't be bugged by Y2K

Stanford's Year 2000 Readiness
Task Force has reported all central
information systems will be tested
and Y2K compliant by June.
I'his means that all systems han
dling administrative duties such as
payroll, student accounts and regis
tration will be prepared for poten
tial problems that could arise from
the Y2K bug.
Created during fall quarter of
1997, the task force has been meet
ing once a month to discuss and im
plement a plan of preparedness for
Stanford's transition into the new
millennium. Headed by Mariann
Byerwalter. the University's vice
president of business affairs and
chief financial officer, the task
force is co-chaired by Steve Jung,

director of interna! audit, and
Raman Khanna. chief information
officer.
Project manager Karl Heinsand
representatives from all Stanford
schools join the three in working
toward Y2K preparation. The task
force oversees not only central and
decentralized information systems
within Stanford but also works with
business partners who provide ser
vices or products to Stanford.
"We want to understand their
level of preparedness â€” if invento
ry is dated incorrectly it will not ar
rive on the Stanford campus," By
erwalter said. Currently 80 percent
of Stanford's business partners
claim their information systems are
or will be prepared for Y2K.
Within the Stanford campus, the
Information Technology Systems
and Services is handling the central
computer systems. They have li
censed Click Net, a program that
audits computer applications and
identifies potential Y2K issues.
This program is already in place
in administrative computers and is
being discussed for use in residen
tial computing. However, students
are currently encouraged to visit
the Stanford Y2K Website to learn
about what they can do to prepare
their personal computers for the
transition.
Gerald Weitz, director of infor
mation system architecture, calls
ITSS "the support underneath I Uni
versity computing." He said each
department and school has a differ
ent computing need.
To facilitate communication be
tween each Stanford school and the
Y2K task force, Byerwalter and
University Provost Condoleezza
Rice have sent out letters asking
whether the schools and depart
ments have "completed the essen
tial elements of [their] Y2K readi

ness effort."
Byerwalter said, "We need to
see if there are any gaps, any areas

where departments need further as
sist;! nee."
Another area of concern for the
task force is the embedded-chip

problem, which affects every sys
tem that has a date function. This
includes controllers in some eleva-

tors, where one circuit can affect an
entire system.
The task force is asking for all
evaluations to be completed by the

beginningof the fall quarter, before
the campus-wide test in October,
which will test for possible prob
lems with electrical service, deliv
ery systems and other day-to-day
University functions.
In case of emergencies arising
from the transition to the new mil
lennium. the task force has devel
oped a contingency plan. This plan
will cover life safety issues for peo
ple on campus and will include a
phone number and other backup
communication channels students
can use if they are unable to return
to campus at the beginning of' Jan
uary.
Task force members are pre
pared to stay on campus through
the new year and will be contacting
schools on the East Coast, as they
will approach the millennium three
hours before Stanford.

paredness plan are available at
