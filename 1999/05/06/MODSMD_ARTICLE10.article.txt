TIRANA, Albania (AP) — The
U.S. Army won't disrupt its plans to
send Apache helicopters into com
bat against Serb forces, despite a
crash in Albania's mountains yester
day that killed two American avia
tors and brought NA TO's first fatal
ities in its campaign against
Yugoslavia.
The crash, during nighttime train
ing in rugged northeastern Albania,
was the second in nine days involv
ing one of the two-dozen heavily
armed anti-tank Apaches deployed
in Albania. They are preparing for
combat missions against Yugoslav
forces, accused of driving nearly
7(X),000 ethnic Albanians out of a
neighboring Kosovo province.

Training will proceed, and the
Army will stick to its still-secret
schedule for deploying the heli
copters in combat, said Lt. Col. Gar
rie Dornan, a spokesman for the task
force that includes the Apaches.
"This will not hinder the timeline
— there's no delay, no aircraft
grounded," he told reporters yester
day at Tirana's airport, the Apaches'
temporary base.
The LJ.S. military identified the
two Army aviators as Chief Warrant
Officer 3 David A. Gibbs, 38, of
Ohio, and Chief Warrant Officer 2
Kevin L. Reichert, 28, of Wisconsin.
No hometowns were available,
according to Maj. Toni Kemper at
U.S. European Command in

Stuttgart, Germany.
The mood among the remaining
pilots was "mournful but still
resolved," said Dornan.
The cause of the crash was under
investigation, but the Army said
there were no indications of hostile
fire.
Dornan said the helicopter
crashed in "remote, rugged, moun
tainous terrain" at 1:30 a.m. local
time, 45 miles northeast of Tirana's
airport.
He said a "fireball" was spotted
by crews of other aircraft as the
Apache went down. Some of the
ammunition on the chopper explod
ed, and an explosives disposal team
was dispatched to aid in the recovery

effort, he said.
The pilot and co-pilot / gunner
were dead when the first rescue team
arrived within 15 minutes of the
crash. Dornan said.
President Clinton, speaking to
American troops at a base in Ger
many, lamented the loss of "two
brave Americans."
"We grieve with their families
and pray for them." Clinton said.
In a ceremony at Tirana airport,
pall bearers from the dead aviators'
unit carried the two caskets past
about 300 soldiers and honor guards
onto a C-17 transport plane, the hum
of the engine drowning out the
strains of " The Star-Spangled Ban
ner."
