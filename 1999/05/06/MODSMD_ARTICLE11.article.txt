# Kosovo refugees arrive in New Jersey
## 
### 
FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) — Leaving their war
ravaged homeland for a new life in America, the
first group of Kosovo refugees arrived yesterday
at a New Jersey military base, where they will stay
for a few weeks before being placed in homes
around the country.
The refugees — 249 adults, 195 children rang
ing in age from 3 to 18 and nine infants — left a
crowded, dirty camp in Macedonia aboard a char
tered Boeing 747 and landed at McGuire Air
Force base.
"The goal here is to provide a welcoming envi
ronment, which is comfortable," said Lavinia
Limon, director of the Office of Refugee Settle
ment for the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was expect
ed to welcome them.
Most of the 20,000 refugees the United States
has agreed to accept will be directly placed with
sponsoring families or relatives upon arrival. The
group arriving at Fort Dix from Macedonia were
deemed at special risk because they had no family
members available to help them or were staying in
unstable areas.
Among those eager to help is Halil Bequiri, a
Macedonia native who came to Fort Dix yester
day seeking information on taking in refugees.
Bequiri, 36, who has lived in the United States
for 15 years, said he was willing to take in "as
many as I can. As many as my home can hold,
until it falls down. At least it won't fall from Ser
bian bombs."
A 24-hour health clinic was set up for the
refugees, and local hospitals were on standby to
accept any refugees needing medical treatment.
The refugees will undergo preliminary screen
ing by immigration officials, receive photo identi
fication badges and get dormitory assignments.
Albanian-speaking mental health and trauma
counselors also will be available.
The accommodations are a far cry from the
refugee camps in Macedonia, which are filled to
two or three times their capacity. Sanitation is
poor and the risk of disease increases as the
weather gets warmer.

Even so, some of the ethnic Albanians had
been reluctant to board the airplane earlier in the
day in Macedonia.
"Of course I would love to come back, but I'm
afraid that we'll end up staying in America
because of my children," Mehniet Selimaj said,
surrounded by his three daughters, a 16-year-old
and 11 -year-old twins.
Another 400 refugees are expected to arrive at
Fort Dix tomorrow, and a separate group of 100
refugees are expected to fly into New York's
Kennedy Airport Saturday.
Officials expect to move about 2,(XK) refugees a
week through Fort Dix and Kennedy and plan to
eventually phase out entry through Fort Dix.
The refugee settlement is a massive undertak
ing by the United States and the first at Fort Dix

since Hungarian refugees were brought here m
the late 19505.
The refugees will have a year to apply for per
manent residence. State Department deputy
spokesman James Foley said at a news briefing in
Washington. Officials expect most will return to
their homeland.
The group arriving yesterday were to be given
welcome kits, including soap, shampoo and a
towel, and will receive an orientation in U.S. cul
ture.
They eventually will be assigned a city where
they can receive one month's apartment rent, job
training, English-as-a-second-language classes and
a sponsor family's support. New York. Boston,
Chicago, Dallas and Providence. R.I. have large
ethnic Albanian populations.
