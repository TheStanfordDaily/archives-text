At the Oakcrest Church of Christ, Jean
Clemence of Moore was walking around
in a daze as her children gathered canned
goods and other non-perishables from a
food pantry hastily set up in a Sunday
school class.
She and her boyfriend had ordered a
storm cellar back in November, but the
man who was supposed to install it dug the
hole and just left it.
Clemence said she had asked for the
down payment back, and the man
promised to come back yesterday.
"He's six months too late," she said.
"We're going to get our money back. I
don't care. I think he owes us."
In the Molsbees' neighborhood, Shirley
and Bennie Johnson's house was serving
as a restroom retreat.
"We've got running water. If you've got
to go. then come on in," Shirley Johnson
said.
The house escaped with just shattered
windows and cracked sheet rock. The 21
pictures of Southwestern art still hung in
the living room.
Johnson held up real estate fliers on the
kitchen counter.
"We had this house for sale. A couple
even checked it out Monday afternoon,"
she said. "Now, it's real cheap."
