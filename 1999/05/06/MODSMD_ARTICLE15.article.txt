Arrests in Berkeley
cast doubt on rights
of students to protest

THE: WAY THAT nonviolent
protesters at UC-Berkeley
were arrested early Tuesday
morning reminds us all how limited
our freedoms are as students.
Conveniently avoiding any likeli
hood of media coverage, police offi
cers clad in riot gear descended
upon the group of students at 3 a.m.
The group included several from
Stanford, five of whom were arrest
ed.
Members of the media on the
scene were reportedly prevented
from capturing the incident in any
airable fashion.
This de facto suspension of the
right of the general public to know
what is really occurring, which
smacks of an attempt to mute the
protesters, is one of the most dis
turbing elements of these arrests.
The refusal of UC-Berkeley
Chancellor Robert Berdahl to heed
the concerns of the students before
having them arrested is another mat
ter of grave import.
Berkeley officials offered the
explanation that the time was cho
sen in order to prevent the disrup
tion of the campus at large.
However, they failed to explain
why the dead of night was chosen as
opposed to in the morning before
classes started.
Alternatively, police could have
arrived at an hour of the night when
students could have reasonably been
expected to be awake and members
of the press could have reasonably
been expected to objectively witness
the arrest of the student protestors.
At a university famous for its
legacy of protest and advocacy of
positive social change, agitating to

prevent the disappearance of a cher
ished program in ethnic studies is a
worthy cause.
By trying to snuff out student
efforts without either hearing them
or allowing the world to see what
they are doing runs contrary to the
mission of a university, the legacy of
IJC-Berkeley and the constitutional
freedoms that every American is
entitled to.
ITie actions of the administrators
and police at UC-Berkeley are dark
reminders of the fact that our rights
are not the same as university stu
dents on a university campus.
There is clearly a distinction
between the current UC-Berkeley
protest and the 1968 Democratic
national convention or the 1960s
civil rights protests that took place in
the South.
Still, it is saddening that in this
age of student apathy, genuine
efforts to enact change, even on a
strictly university level, were met
with such hostility and ill treatment.
We condemn the actions of both
the Berkeley administration and the
police force in this case.
They have shown patent disregard
for the opinions of the students
involved, and by attempting to
sweep their efforts under the rug,
further disrespect students who are
agitating for a legitimate cause.
At the very least. Chancellor
Berdahl and the UC-Berkeley
administration should schedule a
hearing with the striking students so
their concerns can be expressed in a
meaningful way and their opinions
can be given the dignity that they
deserve.
But for now, we hope that the
protesters at UC-Berkeley and the
Stanford students who are joining
them have offered some inspiration
for the rest of us to advocate for pos
itive change in this era of general
student apathy.
