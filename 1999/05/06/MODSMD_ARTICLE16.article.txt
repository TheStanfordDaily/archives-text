Daily should stop whining
St) predictable.
When student activists confront human
rights in Burma, they are charged with
focusing too much on "far away" issues,
accused of overlooking trouble at home and
neglecting their local community.
When students confront injustice here at
Stanford, The Daily turns to charge them
with "being selfish" for tackling local issues.
Burma, Barrio Assistance, Bon Appetit,
Berkeley Ethnic Studies — it's all connect
ed. If it all amounts to "choosing battles,"
there is more than enough work to go
around, so stop complaining about the work
people are doing and save your breath
about what you think they should be doing:
show us some leadership — go on, try it! It
doesn't hurt, we promise.
The Daily should use its editorial space
applauding those who have actually chosen
a battle instead of whining about all the
people not working on the battle The Daily
likes today, or wasting editorials endorsing
the announcements the University made
the day before.
In the words of Audre Lorde, "I am a
black lesbian feminist warrior mother can

cer survivor doing my work. Are you doing
yours?"
And if anyone needs some suggestions,
call us — there's plenty to go around.

Letter overlooked holiday
A letter in yesterday's Daily lamented
the bombing of Serbia on Easter Sunday. I
am surprised that neither the letter, nor the
American media in general, mentions that
one of Islam's two holiest holidays, Eid-ul-
Azha, occurred about a week before Easter
Sunday.
On this day, Muslims around the world
gathered in mosques to pray and remember
the piety of the prophet Abraham, peace be
upon him. However, what were the Albani
an Muslims of Kosovo doing on this impor
tant religious holiday? They were being
raped, murdered, expelled, robbed and
beaten by Milosevic's hired demons.
As Yugoslav officials curse NATO for
bombing them on a holiday dear to the Ser
bian people, I cannot help but wonder how
many Kosovar Albanians were able to offer

even a fraction of the traditional Eid-ul-
Azha prayers. Easter is not the only holiday
this war has annihilated. To keep our objec
tivity and perhaps our sanity intact, we must
always remind ourselves that both Serbs
and Albanians are suffering right now.

Wiener's column misled
In response to Jocelyn Wiener's column
in yesterday's Daily, I find nothing abhor
rent about prison labor.
On the contrary, I think it is a good idea.
There is nothing wrong with expecting
those who have broken the law to con
tribute something back to the society
against which they have transgressed. There
is nothing cruel or unusual about making
license plates or answering phone calls.
Comparing the prison labor of today to
the chain gangs of the past is unwarranted.
And why does Wiener cite the wages pris
oners are paid? Does she mean to suggest
that these wages are unfair, that prisoners
deserve the same wages as ordinary citi
zens?

Instead of seeing this as an injustice, she
should view the difference in wages as pris
oners repaying a debt to society: a debt they
incurred when they chose to break the law.
Furthermore, Wiener's suggestion that
"the burgeoning number of inmates in U.S
prisons ... is attributable to a conscientious
corporate and governmental agenda" is
preposterous. It costs far more to support
prisoners than any monetary gain that may
be derived from their labor. The real "mis
allocation of their lives and labors"
occurred when prisoners willingly chose to
break the laws of their society — laws
designed to protect and uphold their free
doms.
I do not mean to suggest that our prison
system does not need reform — it does, but
racial imbalances and physical abuse of pris
oners are separate issues that do not invali
date the concept of prison labor as an inher
ently bad idea.
Every honest, law-abiding citizen is
expected to contribute their labor toward
the betterment of society. Should we expect
less from prisoners? No. If anything, we
should expect more.
