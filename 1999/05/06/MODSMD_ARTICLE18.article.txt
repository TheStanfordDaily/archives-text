# From the trenches
## Erin Bouchier Oh the joy of Draw season 
### 
WE HAVE come
again to the
dreaded time of
year when we students
must make decisions
about where and with
whom to live. The nearly
incomprehensible and san-

ity-threatening Draw has arrived.
Even for those who, thankfully, will not
be entering the Draw juggernaut, this can
be a taxing time; those living off-campus
struggle to find an affordable apartment
that has more space than a refrigerator;
those living in a housed fraternity or sorori
ty labor to find a suitable roommate with
whom to share his or her spacious two
room double (proving that some people's
decisions are easier than others).
Having survived this trial two previous
times with varying levels of success, I have
some thoughts, some so-called advice, to
share with my fellow students that will like
ly have varying levels of worth.
Probably the first decision any of us faces
is "who": whom should I spend the next
year with? One theory is that our best
friends are essentially determined by where
we live freshman year. According to this
hypothesis, we are simply pawns in a game
where all power is wielded by Housing
Assignment Services. Consequently, fresh
men wijl likely form Draw groups with their
neighbors down the hall.
The question remains: who is in the
Draw group? In asking this question, we
probably first think about ourselves, pon

during whether we are, in fact, a desirable
roommate for others. And most of us come
to the same conclusion: not only are we
desirable as roommates, we are ideal. 1. for
example, might assume that the 15 times my
snooze alarm sounds each morning is as
soothing to my roomie as it is to me. Or
maybe you think it's fabulous that this past
year you provided you and your roommate
with yet another bunkmate ... your signifi
cant other. Yet as endearing as these
idiosyncrasies might be to us. we must
admit that others may not see them the
same way.
How well you can or cannot deal with
others' quirks is truly the most important
criterion in choosing a roommate. Mikey
down the hafl majFbe your very best friend
at Stanford, but are you sure that you. a
neat freak, want to share a room with mas
ter of the mess Mikey? This is not to say
that your differences threaten your friend
ship. Hut just because someone is a good
friend, he is not necessarily a good room
mate for you. And what is most important
in searching for a roommate is finding
someone whom you can live well with.
One of the toughest things you may have
to do at Stanford is tell a friend that you
don't think you should room together. For
this reason. Draw is never without drama
and hurt feelings (especially among girls,
who seem to make a business out of exag
gerating the importance of Draw).
And is whom you live with really all that
important? You've probably heard the old
maxim and paraphrased Dave Matthews

lyric: it's not where you live but with whom
you live. False. I know some jaws may have
just dropped, hut when all your friends live
within walking distance of each other,
where becomes much more important than
with whom. If you disagree (which you are
certainly entitled to do), please ask yourself
this simple question: would I rather spend
senior year living in a large single in
Xanadu, or would I prefer the confines of a
one-room double in Stern with my draw
mates as neighbors?
Living in a nice place with your own
room and good food can really make you
forget how upset you are not to be rooming
with a drawmate. A few years ago, a friend
called upset because her Draw group had
been split ... between Bob and Xanadu.
Having just learned that I would be living
with all my drawmates in a two-room quad
in Toyon, I would have gladly traded places
with her.
Ideally, the where and with whom do not
have to come into conflict with each other
as in the Xanadu solo versus Stern with
friends examples. In a perfect world, you
draw with your best friends who also hap
pen to be optimal roommates, and you live
in Suites.
That is, if the Draw Gods are willing.
