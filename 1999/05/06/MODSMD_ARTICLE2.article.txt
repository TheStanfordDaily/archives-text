## U.N. nominee's Stanford speech deemed not illegal 
### Newton kanhema Erica Platt 
A State Department inquiry has
found no evidence that Richard
Holbrooke. President Clinton's
nominee as I J.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations, broke the depart
ment's rules when he gave a paid

speech at Stanford in November.
The department's inspector gen
eral. Jacquclyn Williams-Bridgers.
said Tuesday she had cleared Hol
brooke after investigating his ac
ceptance of $16,000 by the ASSIJ
Speakers Bureau while working as
an unpaid White House envoy to
the Balkans.
But this clearance is not the end
of Holbrooke's battle to the U.N.
headquarters. The decision to close
the investigation removed only one
more roadblock from Senate confir
mation of Holbrooke, whose nomi
nation to the U.N. post has been
stalled for months.
This inquiry, which threatened
additional delays in Senate hearings
for Holbrooke, was prompted hy an
opinion article in the Washington
Post in March that questioned
whether it was proper for Hol
brooke to receive lecture fees for
speaking about the current situa
tion in the Balkans while serving as
a special presidential envoy to the
region.


Richard Holbrooke
In a statement, Williams-
Bridgers said her office "did not
find evidence of a clear violation of
the standards of conduct and the
Office of Inspector General closed
the investigation" last Friday. She
offered no details on her reasons for
dropping the inquiry.
Holbrooke's lawyer. Richard
Beattie, said in The New York
Times that the investigation showed
that the speech had centered not on
recent developments in Kosovo but
on broader foreign policy concerns.
"The speech was about foreign
policy and the need to have a for
eign policy." Beattie said. "He
threw in a couple of anecdotal
things at the end, and he used Koso
vo as an example. But the speech
wasn't about Kosovo at all."
Holbrooke expressed regret in
his speech that the United States
had not intervened in Kosovo soon
er than it did and said that U.N. au
thorization of bombings in Kosovo
represented "a new precedent for
international relations," in that it le
gitimated using force against abuses
within a sovereign state.
The ambassador "talked about
negotiations with Milosevic" re

garding Bosnia, "and he mentioned
Kosovo a couple of times," said se
nior Perry Chen, who attended the
speech. "The bulk of the speech was
not about Kosovo."
Beattie told The New York
Times that the outcome was a
"complete exoneration" of the vet
eran diplomat, and that Hol
brooke's nomination, which has
been stalled for three months,
should now be able to advance in
the Senate. "There was no evidence
of any wrongdoing," Beattie said.
According to ASSU Speakers
Bureau representative Michael
Kass, "Holbrooke was invited as a
vice chairman of an investment
banking firm who had had substan
tial experience in government."
Kass added that when Holbrooke
was initially invited to speak he had
not yet been appointed as a special
envoy for Kosovo.
Kass agreed with Beattie's as
sessment of the speech but admitted
that when the charges against Hol
brooke were first raised, he "went
straight to the Daily article describ
ing the speech. I remembered that
the speech dealt directly with the
Dayton Accords but couldn't re
member if Holbrooke had specifi
cally spoken about his own work in
the Balkans."
Althouuh Holbrooke has been

cleared from further investigation
hv the State Department, the Sen
ate still stands in his way ignoring
the findings of the inspector gener- ,
al.
The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, headed by Sen. Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.), will not allow the
nomination to advance further until'
the Senate has received a variety of'"
internal documents from the Justice
Department about an earlier ethics
investigation of Holbrooke.
The issue in that case was '
whether Holbrooke had illegally '
lobbied foreign governments while
working as an investment banker. '
Holbrooke agreed to a settlement
with the Justice Department for
$5,000 but never admitted any
wrongdoing.
"The State Department carried
out its own investigation, and we are '
still carrying out our own investiga
tion. We investigate all nominated
ambassadors, so there is nothing
special about our conduct with Hol
brooke," a statement from the Sen
ate committee said.
The statement said the commit- Â«
tee was not sure when a hearing will%
be conducted on the nomination. *
Holbrooke is a former ambas
sador to Germany and was the ar
chitect of the Dayton Peace Accords
in 1995 that ended the war in Bosnia.
