### Newton kanhema Erica Platt 
A State Department inquiry has
found no evidence that Richard
Holbrooke. President Clinton's
nominee as I J.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations, broke the depart
ment's rules when he gave a paid

speech at Stanford in November.
The department's inspector gen
eral. Jacquclyn Williams-Bridgers.
said Tuesday she had cleared Hol
brooke after investigating his ac
ceptance of $16,000 by the ASSIJ
Speakers Bureau while working as
an unpaid White House envoy to
the Balkans.
But this clearance is not the end
of Holbrooke's battle to the U.N.
headquarters. The decision to close
the investigation removed only one
more roadblock from Senate confir
mation of Holbrooke, whose nomi
nation to the U.N. post has been
stalled for months.
This inquiry, which threatened
additional delays in Senate hearings
for Holbrooke, was prompted hy an
opinion article in the Washington
Post in March that questioned
whether it was proper for Hol
brooke to receive lecture fees for
speaking about the current situa
tion in the Balkans while serving as
a special presidential envoy to the
region.
