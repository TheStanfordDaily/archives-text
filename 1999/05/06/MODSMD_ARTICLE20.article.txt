## Stanford edges Pacific 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Coming off an exhilarating vic
tory over Nevada, it would have
been understandable if the Stan
ford baseball team suffered a
drop-off in its offensive perfor
mance last night at Sunken Dia
mond against the Pacific Tigers.
But sometimes, that's good
enough — especially when you get
masterful pitching.
BASEBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford (53-12)
2, Pacific (29-21) 1.
Freshman right-hander Mike
Wodnicki gave the battered Car
dinal bullpen a much-needed rest
by throwing six great innings of
shutout ball, allowing only one hit.
Two more Cardinal pitchers
picked up the slack in the final
three innings to polish off a swift
2-1 victory over Pacific.
As a result, the sixth-ranked
Cardinal (35-12) extended its win
ning streak to eight in the shortest
game of the season (1 hour. 56
minutes), one day after battling
Nevada for four-plus hours.
It was truly a remarkable
change of pace, especially for
Wodnicki. He entered last night's
game with a 2-0 record and a 7.36
ERA. the second-highest on the
Cardinal staff.
And even though he started the
game ominously by hitting the
leadoff batter with the first pitch,
Wodnicki quickly settled down.
After walking his only batter in
the third inning, he retired the
final 12 he faced.
"Wodnicki did super," Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess
said. "He struggled a little bit the
first inning or two. but then he got
his rhythm together. He had good
command of his fastball and then
he started getting his breaking ball
over, so it was a great job by him."
It also helped that Pacific (29-
21) entered the game as one of the
weakest-hitting teams in the Big
West Conference. As a team, the
Tigers rank last in their league in
batting average at .268 and home
runs with 24. By comparison, ju
hior first baseman John Gall,
sophomore right fielder Joe Bor
chard and senior third baseman
Josh Hochgesang have 26 home
runs combined.
Unfortunately, the late-after
noon start proved to be the coolant
to Stanford's hot hitting. Three
Tiger pitchers held Stanford to
three hits, forcing the Cardinal to
manufacture runs. Junior designat
ed hitter Craig Thompson led off
the Cardinal first with a double to
left and came around to score two
outs later on a single by Borchard.
Stanford's other run came in the
sixth inning on a leadoff double by
junior second baseman Jeff Rizzo,
a groundout that moved Rizzo to
third and a sacrifice tly to center
field by Borchard. The sophomore
right fielder continues to flirt with
.400, as his l-for-2 performance put

him at .403 at the end of the night.
Pacific threatened to steal the
game in the late innings after fresh
man right-hander J.D. Wilcox took
over for Wodnicki in the seventh
inning. After retiring the first five
batters he faced, Wilcox allowed
Pacific's first hit since the second
inning — a moon shot by freshman
right fielder Richard Hackett over
the left field fence — to cut the lead
in half.
Junior third baseman Ryan
Stowasser followed with a single,
then stole second base to get Pacif
ic's tying run in scoring position.
Wilcox was lifted in favor of senior
left-hander Tony Cogan, who sub
dued Pacific first baseman Todd
Bramble into grounding out to end
the threat. Cogan then struck out
the side in the ninth to polish off
the Tigers and secure the victory.
It was indeed a night-and-day
performance from the Cardinal the
last two days — but with the same
results.
