# Glazer grew up in East, adds to West
## 
### Mo Eger Contributing writer 
Women's water polo is a sport
dominated by West Coast teams
and all of the members of the No. 3
Stanford team are from the West.
All except one.
Senior Nicole Glazer grew up in
Miami. Fla., and started playing
water polo when she was in sev
enth grade. Her older brother
Benji played, and he advocated his
sister do the same — yet for a dif
ferent reason than thinking Glazer
might enjoy the game.
"Benji drove me to and from
school," Glazer said. "When he
went to practice, I was stuck going
whether or not I liked it. I didn't re
ally have a choice at first."
Four years later. Benji was in
college and Glazer, with her own
driver's license, was still going to
practice. By that time, she was so
hooked on the sport that she made
arrangements to attend a water
polo camp the summer before her
senior year at Ransom Everglades
High School.
Glazer traveled all the way to
California to participate in the
camp.
More accurately, she came to
Stanford's deGuerre pool. The
summer increased her love for the
sport, but more importantly, the
experience made her realize that
she wanted go to school at Stan
ford.
"When I got out here, I knew I
wanted to come to Stanford re
gardless of water polo." Glazer
said. "But the idea of possibly
playing water polo was a huge in
centive to apply."
Though Stanford women's
water polo was still just a club
sport, men's assistant coach and
then head women's coach Ben
Quittner had begun recruiting for
the 1995-6 season. This would be
the first year the Cardinal compet
ed as a Division I varsity sport.
Perfect timing with Glazer's
freshman year.
Since its inaugural season, the
Cardinal has never held a national
ranking lower than fifth. In its first
year. Stanford placed fifth at Na
tionals. then fourth the following
season, and last year the Cardinal
brought home third.
The leadership and talent of
Glazer and the other seniors has

played a huge role in the develop
ment of the team and Stanford's
success.
"Nicole epitomizes all the in
tangibles in water polo," head
coach John Tanner said. "She isn't
the tallest player on the team, nor
the fastest, but her vision and
awareness, tenacity for the game,
and unmatched work ethic make
her an extremely valuable leader
and player."
There are only a few specific
positions in the game of water
polo, and Glazer is entrusted with
one of the most important defen
sive responsibilities. The goalie is
called the last line of defense, but it
is Glazer's job to keep the two
meter hole-set from turning and
facing senior goalie Heather Crary
with the ball poised to score.
"She is great on defense," Tan
ner said. "Her balance is spectacu
lar. and when guarding the two
meter player. Nicole manages to
steal the ball the majority of the
time."
When it is not possible to steal
the ball from the offense, Glazer
must control the two-meter player
so she does not turn and score.
Fouling in water polo stops the
clock and makes it so the player
with the ball cannot score without
passing it out to another player
first.
Glazer uses this strategy of foul
ing to keep the hole-set under con
trol. though if she fouls too hard or
pulls back on the player's arm, she
will be kicked out for 20 seconds,
leaving her team vulnerable and at
a disadvantage.
Relying on fouls while trying
not to earn a kiekout puts Glazer in
a precarious position. Stanford's
success proves that she handles
herself well as hole-defender and is
a threat toother teams' scoring po
tential.
"She's as hard on herself as she
is on the rest of the team," sopho
more Dani Hell said. "This moti
vates everyone to work harder
than they thought they could."
"Her competitive spirit lifts
everyone else's level of play," Tan
ner said. "That is why she is so
valuable to the team."
Hut the team is what is valuable
to Glazer.
"It wasn't the reason I decided

gral part of the team defensively and out of the water.
