# Stanford baseball in unfair race to first
## 
### Jeff Cooper Editorial staff 
Whoever draws up the Pacific
10 Conference baseball schedule
should be dragged out into the
street and shot, or at the least given
a stern talking to. Who is this per
son?

After sweeping Oregon State
this past weekend, the Cardinal
finds itself in possession of a two
game conference lead over USC.
with three games left to play. The
season is steaming toward the play
offs; two great teams with hallowed
traditions find themselves down to
the wire for bragging rights and
postseason hopes.
One might imagine a dramatic
showdown this weekend, with
Stanford looking to hold onto its
momentum and USC playing to
survive.
Instead, the Cardinal will spend

the week, the weekend and the
next week sweating in the weight
room, taking batting practice, and
facing a succession of cannon fod
der the likes of which haven't been
seen since the Chinese national
hockey team took the ice against
the US this winter.
Here's the way the schedule
looks since the Oregon State se
ries: Nevada Tuesday. Pacific last
night, St. Mary's tomorrow, San
Francisco on the l()th and Santa
Clara on the 11th.
Here's the way I JSC's schedule
looks since their series against
UCLA last weekend: San Diego
State Tuesday, sip beers by the
pool until next weekend.
Hello?
The 11-dav break is the longest
stretch of time without a confer
ence game for both teams since
early March, when Pac-10 play
began. It's as if in late November, a
couple weeks before the NFL play
offs start, the 49ers took a week off
to go and play high school teams
around the state.
This may sound a bit disparag
ing to the non-conference teams
Stanford is up against, but with the
exception of the Nevada Wolfpack
(who took the team to extra in


Jeff
Cooper
ninths Tuesday night before losing,
16 14). a fairly ragtag group is pre
senting itself. The other four have
an aggregate record of 79-107-1.
(The fact that there's a tie in that
statistic should indicate what sort
of teams we're dealing with. Cus
tomarily. that's not a stat you see a
lot in serious baseball.) Stanford
owns a 5-0 record against the quar
tet this season, having outscored it
32-12.

Veteran Stanford coach Mark
Marquess is faced with some diffi
cult decisions for the next week and
a half. Any one of these teams,
though not at Stanford's level,
could find itself hot for a night, just
in time for a momentum-killing loss
for the ('ardinal.
Should Marquess use a less ex
perienced roster and risk a letdown
loss at the worst possible time?
Should he pitch his aces and risk fa
tigue or, heaven forbid, a critical in
jury'.' How best to carry the surging
offense's heat through the week
and weekend before it faces a game

that matters?
These are tough decisions and
frankly, I'm glad I don't have to
make them.
USC has taken the opposite
route, filling its break with nothing
but practice time, walking down a
path that carries with it the specter
of rust and slowdown. The last
thing a title-hungry team needs be
fore the critical series is a good,
brain-clouding nap.
One might imagine the Pae-l()
could have foreseen this problem.
This is the first year it's been in real
existence for baseball, replacing

the Six-Pae of yesteryear, and I'm
sure it's not easy to invent logistics
for nine teams (Oregon doesn't
have a varsity team).
Hut given that Stanford won the
last two Six-Pae titles and I JSC won
the national championship last
year, is it that hard to guess which
teams might be playing for the first
ever Pac-l() baseball championship
this season?
Judge Judy could figure this one
out.
It probably is too much to ask to
have scheduled the two teams
against each other for the final

weekend — the drama of waiting
for the other team's score over the
PA system is enough for me. But
this break time is a killer. Non-con
ference games during the week are
certainly a tradition, but the week
end off is a letdown waiting to hap
pen.
Happily, Stanford doesn't have
to carry its momentum too far.
With a two-game lead, all it needs
to do is win one of the three games
against UCLA two weekends
hence, and its guaranteed at least n
share of the crown. A winning
record on the weekend would

guarantee sole possession of the
title.
As it is, the biggest losers, I
think, are the non-conference meat
the Cardinal has to feast on be
tween here and May 14. These are
the teams Marquess will be trying
to generate intensity against, and if
he gets it. a few routs could be in the
offing.
With some good luck and the
prospect of a third straight confer
ence title hanging overhead, the
Cardinal will be able to keep its
bats lively and its arms healthy.
And if thev do — look out.
