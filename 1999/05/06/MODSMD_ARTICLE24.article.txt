# Res Ed to survey sophomores
## Stanford wants to find way to avoid slump 
### Shane Shelley 
Residential Education is current
ly administering a survey to sopho
mores in hopes of evaluating their
second year at Stanford University.
The survey follows an earlier one
conducted only with the students of
Toyon Hall, which is now in its first
year as Stanford's first all-sopho

more residence.
The new survey will he compared
with the former in hopes of evaluat
ing the experiences of Toyon resi
dents in relation to those of the gen
eral sophomore population.
The survey asks students, among
other things, what academic re
sources they have used, how com
fortable they feel in their sopho
more residence and about their re
lationships with peers, faculty and
residence staff.
Anne Dowd, Res Ed's academic
program coordinator, said the sur
veys are part of a general "pilot pro
gram" that is focused on improving

the quality of life for Stanford
sophomores. The "sophomore
slump" has been a concern of Res
Ed, and part of the problem seems
to be the abrupt transition from the
closely monitored life of freshmen
to the more independent life of
sophomores.
Toyon Hall has been the center
of this program. Toyon has academ
ic advisers on staff, and its all-sopho
more status was intended to create a
more supportive atmosphere. The
surveys, Dowd said, will evaluate
whether Toyon has indeed success
fully "bridged the freshman-sopho
more gap."

"The surveys have three focuses."
Dowel said. "They will evaluate the
social life of sophomore residences,
the academic advising for students in
Toyon and elsewhere and the class
identity of sophomore students."
The surveys were written by Res
Ed in conjunction with residontial
fellows and the Undergraduate
Advising Center, and the questions
of the two surveys are similar in
content. Eighty-six of roughly 190
sophomore residents of Toyon
Hall filled out the first survey, and
Res Ed hopes for a comparable
percentage from the general
sophomore population.
