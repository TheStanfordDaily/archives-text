# '70s activists to return
## A3M veterans gather on 30th for anniversary 
### Scott Dorfman 
One ol the most famous inci
dents of nonviolent student protest
in Stanford history will be com
memorated this weekend, as mem
bers ol Stanford's "April Third
Movement" will converge on cam
pus for their 30-year reunion.
On April 3, 1%9, Stanford stu
dent activists decided to protest
against the University's role in the
Vietnam War, organizing a sit-in at
the Applied Electronics Lab. The
protest, actually held six days later,
saw more than 2,000 Stanford stu
dents participate in one of the
largest building occupations ever at
an American university.
The movement, or A3M.
evolved from this incident, seeking
an end to the war in Southeast Asia,
as well as the furthering of numer
ous other causes, such as women's
liberation and labor rights. Many
A3M members are still politically
active today, and the reunion will
not only allow them to look back at
the past but also to evaluate the ac
tivism of the present.
Reunion participants will en
gage in a variety of activities, in
cluding a panel discussion entitled
"What We Did Right. What We
Did Wrong," a Mother's Day
brunch and a musical performance

by the Acme Blues Band. But
much of the weekend will be spent
in informal discussions, reliving the
time period that spawned the
"April Third Movement."
"For all of us. that year was a
defining moment in life," said Yale
Braunstein. professor of information
management and systems at UC-
Berkeley and one of the chief orga
nizers of the reunion. "We came to
realize not only that what the [Unit
ed States] was doing in Southeast
Asia was wrong but what Stanford
was doing was wrong as well. There
was an arrogance in the University
administration that whatever they
were doing was right."
Braunstein was an economics
graduate student at Stanford dur
ing the movement.
Marjorie Cohn. associate pro
fessor of law at Thomas Jefferson
University said. "Through a combi
nation of study and discussion at
Stanford. I became aware of Stan
ford's responsibility in Southeast
Asia. From developing biological
and chemical weapons to research
ing counter-insurgency techniques,
Stanford played a big role in the
war, especially at the [Applied
Electronics Lab]."
"Being affiliated with Stanford
made me feel somewhat personally
responsible for the war. The
protest was needed to call attention
to the University's role in Viet
nam." she said.
Cohn will speak at the reunion
about the relation between Viet
nam and Kosovo.
The reunion will also focus on

the future of Stanford student ac
tivism. Representatives from eight
student organizations will "partic
ipate in a discussion regarding what
the vision is of student activism at
Stanford today," said senior Cathy
Rion. who will help moderate the
panel.
Both Braunstein and Cohn ap
plaud the role activists are playing
today at Stanford, saying the "apa
thetic" label put on current Stan
ford students is unfair.
"Vietnam directly affected
every part of life in America,"
Braunstein said. "That kind of
issue doesn't exist today. So it is im
possible to compare what hap
pened in with what is happen
ing today."
Cohn said, " The activism is tak
ing new forms, but students are still
fighting the good fight." She points
to the "very organized movement
at Stanford against the Solomon
Amendment" as proof that Stan
ford activism is by no means dead.
The Solomon Amendment re
quires universities to allow the mil
itary to recruit on campus or risk
losing federal funding, despite
questions about the military's poli
cies on homosexuality.
The reunion will take place all
weekend at Tresidder Union, with
students encouraged to participate
in all activities. Event organizers
claim the reunion is a great way for
current students to learn more
about the movement they say de
fined not only a generation of Stan
ford students, but a generation of
Americans as well.
