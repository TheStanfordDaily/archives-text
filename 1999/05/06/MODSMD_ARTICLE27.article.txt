# Virtual reality operating room
## Med Center, NASA collaborate to bring doctors together 
### Laura Blythe 
A new collaboration between
the Medical Center and NASA is
bringing virtual reality into the op
erating room.
The Medical Center's Depart
ment of Functional Restoration
and the NASA Ames Research
Center hosted a "virtual collabora
tive clinic" on Tuesday that illus
trated how telecommunications
and surgery can improve patient
care.
The clinic demonstrated the use
of high-speed computer network
ing to enable experts at different lo
cations to view 3-D and color im
ages, such as CT scans and MRIs.
This technology allows physicians
to effectively collaborate over pa
tient cases in a time-efficient man
ner.

The Medical Center and NASA
came together in September 1997
to form the National Center for
Biocomputation. The mission of
the center is to "lead a national ef
fort in applying 3-D imaging and vi
sualization technologies for bio
medical and educational purposes
and to support the NASA mission
for human exploration and devel
opment of space."
The center conducts research
and develops technology that is di
rectly applied to clinical projects.
The center hopes this technology,
including 3-D imaging, visualiza
tion and simulation, will be an ef
fective resource for patient care on
a daily basis and eventually a useful
tool for treatment of astronauts in
space. The center also focuses on
education, outreach, program plan
ning and development.
Tuesday's tele-collaborative
demonstration included a 3-D re
construction of a patient's heart, as
well as the reconstruction of a jaw.
Kevin Montgomery, the techni
cal director of the center, called the

demonstration, "really unique, be
cause we are being able to do 20 to
30 megabits of streaming data per
second over the Internet."
On physician collaboration with
this new technology, Montgomery
said, "What can be done locally can
be done over long distances."
Montgomery has been involved
in organizing the center along with
the programs co-founders. Dr.
Michael Stephanides. Dr. Stephen
Schendel and Dr. Muriel Ross.
Projects of the center include
cranio-facial surgical planning
using virtual reality, soft tissue
modeling using computers and a
cleft lip / palate surgery instruc
tional CD-ROM.
This technology enables sur
geons to transform patient CT and
MRI data into 3-D images with
which they can better understand
the problem and implement surgi
cal procedures in a virtual environ
ment before actual surgery.
