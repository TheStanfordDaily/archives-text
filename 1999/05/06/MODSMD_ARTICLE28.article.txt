# Young, talented players bring wins to Cardinal women's lacrosse team
## Eleven freshman add, gain from Stanford 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
They come from six different
states and bring with them impressive
credentials such as team MVPs, all
state status and All-American notori
ety.
Combined, they've had 45 years of
experience in their sport, but individ
ually their experience ranges from
seven years to one year, that come
from brand new teams as well as
squads ranked in the top 20 national
ly.
They are the freshmen on the
Stanford women's lacrosse team.
And while everyone else is worry
ing about the "freshman 15," the
lacrosse team is boasting about its
"freshman 11."
"I was pleasantly surprised by the
amount of freshmen that we had ar
rive at Stanford in September 1998,"
head coach Heidi Connor said, refer
ring to her somewhat hectic recruit
ing process.
For Connor, who only took over
the job as head coach in September of
1997, last year was her first exposure
to the recruitment process.
"Last year was a battle in recruit
ing," she said. "I was learning a
tremendous amount and trying to
keep up with the pace of things at the
same time."
Despite her anxiety about the re
cruiting process. Connor came away
with four promising recruits: Sara
Lev of Baltimore, Li/. Britt from
Summit, N.J.. Caroline Osterwise
from Villanova, Pa. and Patti Zettler
of Granville, Ohio.
To strengthen an already talented
freshmen class. Connor made contact
with four other prospective freshmen
— Brynn Evans. Cinda McClelland.
Emily Rodriguez and Jenny Silver
man.
As an added bonus, Connor re
ceived three walk-ons in Laurie Am
berg, Annie Welch and Ellie Riteh.
Although neither Weleh nor Riteh
had ever played lacrosse before, Con
nor was willing to give them a chance.
As Connor was checking out pos

sible recruits, the players were cheek
ing out the Stanford women's
lacrosse program with an equal
amount of scrutiny. Most of the play
ers knew they wanted to continue
their lacrosse careers in college — t he
only question was where.
"The positive aspects of Stan
ford's lacrosse program made a big
difference. The program is still grow
ing, but is gaining strength and
recognition very rapidly," Osterwise
said.
"I was excited that Stanford was a
new program and 1 had the potential
of playing here," Evans said. "1 prob
ably could not have played on an East
Coast team, and I wouldn't have
wanted to because it would have been
too intense for me."
"Lacrosse has been a huge part of
my life for so long that I can't imagine
not playing," Britt said. "I fell in love
with Stanford, but the program had a
lot to do with it; I wanted to be a part
of a growing team and feel like I could
make a contribution."
Connor is counting on these fresh
men to boost the team's growing
process. Although the sport is only in
its fifth year at Stanford, the program
is ready to gain national recognition.
The surge of talent from the fresh
men class can only help.
"These freshmen have helped to
redefine Stanford lacrosse as we tack
le the tasks ahead of us," ('onnc>r said.
"We are continuing along this up
swing in our hopes of building a great
lacrosse program. They are part of
that. They are focused, hard-working
and diligent, yet fun-loving. They do
already, and will continue, to con
tribute greatly to this team."
Indeed, the contributions of the
freshmen have already had quite an
impact on the team. The group has
accounted 112( >r K2 goa Is t his seast >n and
has helped the team to a 17-4 record.
"We have come such a long way
this season, particularly in showing
some East Coast schools that we can
play at their level." Evans said, refer
ring to the team's wins over Pennsyl
vania and 1 loly Cross earlier this sea
son. The victories marked the first for

Stanford over teams from the East
Coast.
The Cardinal has left teams from
the West in the dust, clobbering op
ponents by anywhere from four goals
to 15, dropping only one game to a
fellow Western Women's Lacrosse
League team. California, three
months ago.
"(Being on the lacrosse team) has
exceeded my expectations," Amberg
said. "I didn't know anything about
the team. It's exciting that we've
come so far as a varsity team and

done so well this season."
Yet another remarkable aspect to
this team's composure is its tremen
dous chemistry. The women don't
only work together on the field, but
off the field as well.
"The girls are wonderful," Riteh
said. "We get along really well and I
think it is partly because of this that
we've done so well this season."
The women are hoping that this
combination of talent and chemistry
will he a winning combination and
the spark they need to get the reeog

ition they deserve. As Rodriguez ex
plained, ideally the team would like
to get out of the league in California
and play tougher competition. Silver
man agreed the team has its eyes set
on an NCAA bid within the next few
years.
"Out west, women's lacrosse is
rapidly expanding, and hopefully
Stanford will continue to lead that
movement in the future," Osterwise
said.
Their goals are in sight and the
women have proved that they have

what it takes to go aftbr them.
"I hope we continue to be noticed
by teams on the East toast by sub
stantially beating West Coast teams,', k
Hritt said. "I hope we become a topi
20 team by the time I graduate."
And (\)nnor has confidence in her
team. ;
"With this group. I can only con
tinue to raise the bar in my expectaj
tions for this program." she said." AIJ
of us need to continue to focus to
achieve the greatness that we all so
much want to attain."
