# Montoya leads alcohol meeting
## Administrators, students discuss Pro Fro incident 
### Sayra Khandekar Contributing writer 
One of the first sentiments Vice Provost
for Student Affairs James Montoya ex
pressed in yesterday's open forum on student
alcohol use was praise.
"What is clear is that the right thing was
done, that a student feels comfortable calling
911," lie said, referring to an incident last
month when a prospective freshman was
taken to hospital for alcohol poisoning.
Montoya invited members of the Stanford
community to an open meeting of the Stu
dent Affairs Advisory Board on Student Al
cohol Use. The meeting was designed to

specifically address concerns about the inci
dent with the prospective freshman.
He opened the meeting with a few words
about its purpose of being "a frank conversa
tion about the incident we experienced on
campus during Admit Weekend." He
stressed the importance of focusing on solu
tions and figuring out "how we make Stan
ford a safer place for our students and visi
tors. ... It's not a question about blame."
The conversation almost immediately
began with the question of responsibility.
Robert Kinnally, dean of admissions and
financial aid, suggested the possibility of in
cluding within the Admit Weekend mailings
a stronger statement about abiding by the
Fundamental Standard. "We're dealing with
the University's vulnerability," he said.
One of the major themes that emerged
throughout the meeting was looking at the
kinds of messages being sent not only to res
idents and hosts but also to prospective
freshmen and their parents.
