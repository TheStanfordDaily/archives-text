# Montoya leads alcohol meeting
## Administrators, students discuss Pro Fro incident 
### Sayra Khandekar Contributing writer 
One of the first sentiments Vice Provost
for Student Affairs James Montoya ex
pressed in yesterday's open forum on student
alcohol use was praise.
"What is clear is that the right thing was
done, that a student feels comfortable calling
911," lie said, referring to an incident last
month when a prospective freshman was
taken to hospital for alcohol poisoning.
Montoya invited members of the Stanford
community to an open meeting of the Stu
dent Affairs Advisory Board on Student Al
cohol Use. The meeting was designed to

specifically address concerns about the inci
dent with the prospective freshman.
He opened the meeting with a few words
about its purpose of being "a frank conversa
tion about the incident we experienced on
campus during Admit Weekend." He
stressed the importance of focusing on solu
tions and figuring out "how we make Stan
ford a safer place for our students and visi
tors. ... It's not a question about blame."
The conversation almost immediately
began with the question of responsibility.
Robert Kinnally, dean of admissions and
financial aid, suggested the possibility of in
cluding within the Admit Weekend mailings
a stronger statement about abiding by the
Fundamental Standard. "We're dealing with
the University's vulnerability," he said.
One of the major themes that emerged
throughout the meeting was looking at the
kinds of messages being sent not only to res
idents and hosts but also to prospective
freshmen and their parents.

Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya
listens to a discussion about alcohol problems
over Admit Weekend. Yesterdays meeting was
held to address the concerns of administrators
and students.
Roble resident fellow Sam
Leßaron said perhaps there was
confusion among prospective
freshmen concerning what exactly
it means to follow the same code of
behavior as Stanford students.
"There is a potential ambiguity,"
Leßaron said.
While Montoya said initially he
would consider the person provid
ing the alcohol to be responsible,
he acknowledged the possibility
that, "we may need to rethink
that."
Senior Camilla Lindsay, a Car
denal resident assistant, said
prospective freshmen need to be
treated like adults and should be
held responsible more than the
person who serves them alcohol. In
her opinion, prospective freshmen
make their own choices. The deci
sion to drink was a personal one,
and the fault of irresponsible drink
ing is their own.
"It's OK to raise the bar and tell
them what we expect," she said.
Stephanie Blossom, a junior and
incoming president of the Inter
sorority Council, disagreed. "Au
tonomy is a gilt, and with that
comes the respect of not granting

[autonomy] to those who aren't
ready for it."
What is the collective responsi
bility of the Stanford community to
issues like these? Carole Pertofsky,
director of Health Promotion Ser
vices at Cowell Student Health Ser
vices, said there was an inescapable
collective identity that entailed a
degree of responsibility for every
one.
Greg Beroza, the Rinconada
resident fellow, addressed the issue
of consequences. "Perhaps for next
year we can make it clear what's at
stake."
Chris Bonzon, Theta Delta Chi
RA, talked about the collective re
sponsibility of Stanford towards
possible future students.
"We want to promote to parents
and prospective students that this is
a safe place to be," he said.
A widely shared sentiment was
the need for better training and
better communication.
"It was frustrating as an resident
assistant," said Casey Alt, a Faisan
RA. "We didn't know how many
pro fros we had or what activities
were planned."
House hosts, it was further
agreed by most, needed to be bet
ter trained for handling an emer
gency. Moreover, they should pro
vide alternatives to parties with al

cohol.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
mentioned that the last-minute
placing of some prospective fresh
men and the lack of training of
some of the Room Hosts could
have contributed to poor commu
nication.
Boris Bershteyn, a Branner RA,
agreed with Wais and said that with
all of the activities Branner
planned for its pro fros that week
end, he found no parties going on
with alcohol.
Several resident fellows spoke
of the need for preparedness.
Robin Simpson, Trancos RF,
praised her staff for its quick think
ing and planning to keep weekend
events under control.
However, sometimes being pre
pared isn't always enough. A cou
ple of RAs related incidents where
prospective freshmen sought alco
hol without pressure from their
hosts.
Under circumstances like these,
according to them, alcohol would
be difficult to control. The focus
should be on preventing situations
where people are put in danger,
they said.
"It's amazing the stress you're
putting on the system [that week
end]. You just hold your breath,"
Larkin RF Steve Stedman said.
