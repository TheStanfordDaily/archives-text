# Law prof., 16 other congressmen ask courts to stop violations of War Powers Resolution
## Campbell suing Clinton over Kosovo bombing 
### Joanna Corman Contributing writer 
Rep. lom Campbell, who is also a Stanford Law
Professor, has raised an old source of contention be
tween a president and Congress — can a war continue
without congressional approval?
Campbell (R-Calif.) says President Clinton must
answer to the Constitution, and he says that means
asking Congress for permission to continue the bomb
inn of Serbia.

Along with 16 Congressmen,
Campbell tiled a lawsuit against ( lin
ton on April 30 to either force a dec
laration of war or stop the bombing.
The House gave Campbell stand
ing for his lawsuit last month by re
jecting, 427 to 2, a resolution he had
submitted to declare war. H; d the
House voted in favor of declaring

war, his suit would he moot.
"I hope that the federal judge
declares that the president must get
the approval from Congress for
continuing," Campbell said.
Campbell is invoking the Viet
nam-era War Powers Resolution,
which says the president must get
congressional approval to wage
war if hostilities last more than 60
days. Bombing began March 24. so
under that resolution, Clinton has
until the end of May to continue.
Although some agree that mili
tary force in Kosovo violates the
Constitution, experts say it's not
likely the president will be forced
to withdraw U.S. troops.
"It's a continuing bone of con
tention between the president and
Congress," regardless of political
party, said Political Science Prof.
Morris Fiorina, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution. "To some
extent it's unlikely Campbell's ac
tions will make a difference."
Fiorina added that Campbell is
doing something positive in mak
ing Congress think about its re
sponsibilities.
While the lawsuit may prompt
Congress to think about the legali

ty of the war. Fiorina and others say
it's unlikely the court will take the
case. Instead, he said, the court is
more likely to let Congress and
president deal with it.
Campbell, on the other hand,
called his prospects for winning
"fairly good."
He cited a similar case during
the Gulf War in which then-Rep.
Ron Dellums, a Democrat from
Oakland, filed a lawsuit against the
Bush administration in I WO. The
Supreme Court dropped the case
because Congress hadn't yet voted
on whether to approve the war.
"In the Vietnam War, courts
usually denied lawsuits, saying con
gressmen did not have standing."
Campbell said. But in the Dellums
case, a federal judge said congress
men do have standing to sue the
president, he added.
In addition, he said the presi
dent has had time to secure con
gressional approval, "lhe presi
dent didn't make his case to Con
gress." for the war and has main
tained he does not need to.
Eileen Burgin, an associate pro
fessor of political science at the I 'ni
versity of Vermont who specializes
in congressional politics, thinks
Campbell has no grounds for his suit.
"Congress has a lot of means at
its disposal to stop the president."

she said. Burgin cited cutting fund
ing as one example of what Con
gress could do.
Instead, the House rejected
('ampbell's measure for immediate
withdrawal of I'.S. troops, 1» to
2 L >(). And the House Appropria
tions ('ommittcc approved a $12. 1 >
billion military spending hill
slightly more than double what
( linton had asked for.
Burgin said these numbers show
there is no consensus in Congress
to invoke the War Powers Resolu
tion.
Previously, she said, "Campbell
said the War Powers Resolution is
bad. But now he likes it. It's a way to
criticize a I )cmocratic president."
Campbell's Web site shows he
supported military action in the
Gulf' War under President Bush.
And while Congress has not
used its powers to stop Clinton,
Campbell believes the undeclared
war in k< >sovo is wrong because, he
said, the Kosovars are worse off
since NA I(> troops started bomb
ing the area.
"I realize I can be wrong."
Campbell said. "I just point to the
record," that despite I : .S interven
tion. the plight of ethnic Albanians
has vvoi sened.
Campbell expects a judge to
look at the case this week.
