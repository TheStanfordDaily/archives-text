# Shepard stepping down
## Spokesman for two Stanford presidents will be VP at Rice 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
Terry Shepard. the director of
University communications and
University President Gerhard
Casper's chief spokesman, has
found a new place at which to hang
and wear — his hat.
Shepard will leave Stanford in
late June to become the vice presi
dent for public affairs at Rice Uni
versity in Houston. An eight-year
veteran who came to the LJnivcrsi-

Tv in the midst of the indirect-cost
scandal, Shepard helped restore
Stanford's national reputation in
the early '90s.
"I've known Terry Shepard for
about 15 years, and he is consid
ered one of the best in the higher
education public relations busi
ness," said Kate Chesley, associate
director of University communica
tions. "I admire the work he has
done here at Stanford, especially
surrounding the indirect-cost
issue."
"Like many people who knew
Terry and liked working with him,"
she said. "I'm also very happy that,
at Rice, he finally has someplace to


Terry Shepard
wear his cowboy hat and boots."
Shepard, who called his position
"the best job in the nation" when
he took over as director of Stanford
News Service in 1991, said the
move is entirely grounded in "posi
tive reasons."
"You can get stale i! you stay in
one place or one job too long." he
said. "1 was not looking to leave
Stanford. In the end [the Rice job]
was too good to pass up."
Shepard came to Stanford from
the University of Illinois at Ur
bana-Champaign and has served as
a reporter and editor at the Mil
waukee Journal and the Los Ange
les Times.
His departure coincides with the
effective death of the indirect cost
scandal, signalled by the U.S.
Supreme Court's dismissal last
week of a lawsuit by indirect-cost
whistleblower Paul Biddle.

The University, though, has
long since repaired the tarnished
national reputation that came with
the scandal, largely due to Shep
ard's public relations work.
Pulling Stanford out of the scan
dal's shadow, he said, "took a long
time and a lot of blood, sweat and
tears."
Past and current administrators
at Stanford showered praise on
Shepard.
Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy,
the former University president
who hired Shepard, called him "ex
tremely professional and very ca
pable. I think he'll be a big loss for
Stanford."
Current University President
Gerhard Casper said in a statement
that he considers Shepard's Rice
job "a wonderful opportunity, and
one that Terry richly deserves."
Officials were equally kind at
Rice, where Shepard will hold a
position he described as a cross be
tween his job as director of Uni
versity communications and that

dI Larry Morton, Stanford's direc
tor of government and community
relations.
Shepard "comes to Rice with
commendations and recommenda
tions from across the nation," Rice
President Malcolm Ciillis said in a
press release. "We are indeed for
tunate to have him."
The chance to work at a smaller
university was a big attraction,
Shepard said. About 2,700 under
graduates and 1,500 graduate stu
dents attend Rice.
The University has yet to an
nounce his successor, but Shepard
said he isn't worried regardless of
who takes over.
"Gerhard is his own best
spokesman," he said. "He's a very
clear thinker, a very clear speaker
and a delight to work with because
of it."
He isn't worried about his own
future, either.
"I've been extremely happy at
Stanford," Shepard said. "I'm
readv to trv new things."
