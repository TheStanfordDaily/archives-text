WASHINGTON (AP) —The Senate voted 92-0 yesterday to
commend the Rev. Jesse Jackson for winning the release of three
American soldiers captured last month by Yugoslavia.
I he measure, sponsored by Sen. Robert Bvrd, D-W.Va., saluted
the civil rights leader for his successful intervention with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to secure the captives' freedom, and
for "his leadership and actions arising from his deep faith in God."
The three men are Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Ange
les; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek. Mich.; and
Spec. Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas.
They were captured March 31 while patrolling the Macedonia-

Five Republican senators voted "present": Sens. Peter Fitzgerald
of Illinois, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Jeff Sessions of Alaba
ma, Craig Thomas of Wyoming and John Warner of Virginia.

L.A. needs special prosecutor, says report
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The U.S. Civil Rights Commission
issued an unprecedented call yesterday to replace (he county district
attorney with a special prosecutor in abuse cases involving Los Ange
les police and sheriff's deputies.
After a six-year review, commissioners said that because police and
the district attorney work closely in other criminal prosecutions, the
DA's work in officer-involved cases can create the appearance of a
conflict of interest.
"If you separate those functions ... you can try to institute more
fairness," said Mary Frances Berry, commission chairwoman.
Three of the eight board members dissented in the report, calling
the recommendation an "overreaction." Police officials also disagreed
with the findings.
The commission's 233-page report pointed to the district attorney's
track record in prosecuting accused police officers and sheriff's
deputies. Criminal charges were filed against 11 deputies in 126 cases
of alleged abuse in the Sheriff's Department in 19% and 1997.
The recommendations are not binding, but departments usually
implement them, Berry said.
