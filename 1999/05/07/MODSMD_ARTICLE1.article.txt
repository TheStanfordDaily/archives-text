# Eating clubs' future being considered
## Building may be replaced 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
The future of the Toyon Eating Clubs, a Stanford tra
dition since IK I M. has been called into question by a
working group of students and administrators, headed
by ASSU President Mike Levin and Keith Guv, direc
tor of Housing and Dining Services.
The working group will convene over the summer
and through the end of October and will recommend a
course of action to be taken in keeping with the Capital
Improvement Plan.
"The eating club building that is being utilized is in
very bad condition. It needs to be renovated or replaced
by a new facility." explained Guy. "We've been talking
about it in an informal way lor quite a while. The Capi
tal Improvement Plan calendar has made us come to
grips with the fact that we have to make a decision
soon."
Several options have already surfaced in preliminary
discussion. The first option would call for the renovation
of the existing facilities, retaining the eating clubs. A
second option would call for building a facility to serve
both Toyon and Branner Halls. Guy also described the
possibility of building a student program center that
would provide student meeting space as well as housing
the eating clubs.
Toyon resident Lucy Aimers does not see the need
for change.
"The eating clubs already are a student meeting
space. They create an awesome community for Toyon."
she said. "Toyon would be a lot less without the eating
clubs."
Guy emphasized the role of both undergraduate and
graduate student input in the decision-making process,
since many residents of Crothers Hall and Crothers
Memorial Hall depend on the eating clubs for meals.
The ASSU Nominations Commission w ill choose three
students to serve in working group.
"We want to make sure students have a voice and a
role in the process. We want to make the best decision
we can for the University and the history of the eating
clubs, in a sense: it's a long-standing organization here."
explained Guy.
Stanford Eating Clubs Inc., the nonprofit organiza
tion that has operating the eating clubs since will
not have a official role in the
process, though, according to Ciuy
the will be "bioughl into conversa
tion" for information about its oper
; lions and research on student opin
ion.
"We count the committee's in

corporation of the student voice as a
minor victory because we're pretty
sure students want them," Nick Pe
ters, eating clubs general manager,
commented. "Basically, our plan is
to set up a Web site for students to
logon and express what they want to
happen."
The working group will present
its final recommendation to the vice
provosts for student affairs, under

graduate education and budget and
auxiliary management.
If approved, the recommenda
tion will be implemented under the
Capital Improvement Plan. The
plan, which calls for both structural
and cosmetic improvements, is
scheduled to renovate Toyon in the
summer of 2000. though, according
to Guy, some renovations may
begin this summer.
