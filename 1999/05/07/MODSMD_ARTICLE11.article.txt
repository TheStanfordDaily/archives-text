## NATO, Russian leaders to take plan to Serbs 
### 
BONN, Germany (AP) — Russia and the
major Western powers set aside their differ
ences over NATO airstrikes yesterday and
drafted a joint plan to end the Kosovo con
flict. The plan includes the deployment of an
international force to keep the peace after
the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces.
President Clinton and other Western offi
cials welcomed Russia's hacking for ''effec
tive international civil and security pres
ences" in Kosovo, where NATO's six-week
bombing campaign has failed to halt the
expulsions of ethnic Albanians in the south
ern Serb province.
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
in comments later, stuck to his demand that
NATO stop its airstrikes as a first step
toward reaching any settlement — some
thing NATO has repeatedly refused. How
ever, the Yugoslav leader did not refer to the
plan's call for a foreign force in the province.
Kosovo's most prominent ethnic Albani
an leader told a news conference in Rome a
day after he and his family were allowed to
leave Yugoslavia that he favored an interna
tional peacekeeping force — including
NATO — in his homeland.
Clinton described the draft agreed to in
Germany as "a significant step forward ...
increasing the likelihood that there will ulti
mately be a resolution of this that will actu
ally work."
He made his remarks after meeting a
grateful crowd of Kosovo refugees housed at
a German facility and greeting three U.S.
soldiers freed last week by Yugoslavia.

NATO hopes getting Moscow on board
will increase the diplomatic pressure on
Milosevic to drop his resistance to an inter
national military presence in Kosovo.
To bring in Russia, the Western powers
agreed on a statement that makes no refer
ence to any NATO role in Kosovo peace
keeping and stressed the importance of U.N.
backing for the operation.
However, NATO ministers insisted they
had not dropped demands for an interna
tional force that is strongly armed, equipped
with a mandate to use force and spearhead
ed by alliance troops.
"This must mean a strong military force
with NATO at its core," Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said after the meeting of
foreign ministers from Russia and the G-7
group of leading industrialized nations.
"Without robust military presence, noth
ing will be achieved," added German For
eign Minister Joschka Fischer.
The ministers issued seven "general prin
ciples" for a political solution to the crisis
that they said will be proposed as the basis
for a U.N. resolution.
Apart from the international force, they
include a verifiable end to violence in Koso
vo; withdrawal of military, police and
paramilitary forces; establishment of an
interim administration in the province; the
"safe and free" return of refugees; economic
aid to the region; and a political settlement
granting "substantial self-government for
Kosovo."
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said "it would be premature to speak of a
breakthrough, but progress has been made."
the Interfax news agency reported.
Milosevic's refusal to accept an armed
international force in Kosovo has been the
main sticking point of previous peace
attempts. Western ministers said Russia's
backing would crank up pressure to accept.
