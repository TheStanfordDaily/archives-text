If you're going to make
a donation to charity,
don't forget Senior Gift

Seniors, youve all seen
the huge, accusing Senior Gift
pie chart in White Plaza. Some
of you are wondering if it's really
worth it. After all, entire towns in
Oklahoma must he rebuilt in the
wake of tornado damage. Refugees
are streaming out of Kosovo. While
these are deserving causes, we
believe that your money would be
better spent on Senior Gift.
VVc know the traditional exhorta
tion to "give back to the University"
is not compelling. We have already
paid vast amounts of tuition to Stan
ford; in return, the University edu
cated us. In the strictest sense, we
owe Stanford nothing.
Some of us want to donate, but
wonder whether Stanford really
needs our $19.99. Stanford does not
seem "needy," but Kosovar refugees
and homeless ()klahomans undoubt
edly could use our help.
While Stanford may seem rich,
we, as students are not. The Senior
Gilt money ultimately comes back
to students. Sixty percent of it is ear
marked for financial aid. Thirty per
cent goes to academic programs and
I!) percent funds students groups.
Think about the people — you,
your friends, your parents — who
have already benefited from previ
ous Senior Gifts. Given the choice
between saving $19.99 and making it
possible for our closest Stanford
friends to attend this university,
most of us would choose to make the
donation.
That might not cut it for some of

you. "Someone else paid for my
friends and me to come here; I don't
have to worry about that any more,"
you might say. While you might not
have to worry about it now, remem
ber that some of you will be hearing
the pitter-patter of little feet some
time in the distant future. Your
$19.99 might allow you to send
Junior to Stanford in a few years.
Senior Ciift not only contributes
to students' long-term well-being; it
also contributes to society. If you're
feeling bad about international
crises, worry not — there will always
be other opportunities to help disas
ter victims. Better to invest in the
students who will negotiate peace
treaties, rebuild cities and form
foundations to improve the world
and prevent these disasters from
happening in the future.
Finally, economic arguments also
favor Senior Gift over an outside
charity. The $19.99 you give to an
international charity might not go
straight to one person, or even one
family. The donation is spread
throughout the organization, so your
impact on one family might be small.
In contrast, the $19.99 you give to
Senior Gift is doubled by the Par
ents Advisory Board, then doubled
again by Dr. Peter Bing. In strictly
economic terms, your Senior Gift
donation is worth more than your
donation to another charity.
Few of us at Stanford are lacking
the physical necessities of life. But
some of us never would have gotten
here without a previous class' Senior
(iift. It you're really conflicted, split
your donation; give half to Senior
(lift and half to a charity. Just realize
that the money won't pay for a Uni
versity official's six-figure salary. It
will help students, like us.
