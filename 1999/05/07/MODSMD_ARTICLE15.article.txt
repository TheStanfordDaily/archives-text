# On the Home Front: Kelly Young
## Nothing like a mother's love 
### 
SHE WAS BORN an
only child in a pre
dominantly Polish
and Czech community in
central Nebraska. Her par
ents, who ran a little gro
cery store downtown,
came from a long line of

Polish Catholics. Elizabeth Jean Shotkoski's
first ( ommunion photo shows her standing
in front of a white house in a white dress and
veil, her hands serenely clasped in prayer.
She went to Kearney State College in
Nebraska, the first person in the Shotkoski
family to attend a post-secondary school. She
worked as a seamstress and waitress to pay
her way. She declared her major in history
but never graduated.
She eventually married an education
major from Kearney State, whom she had
met at a Halloween party at a popular
restaurant. After a 10-year period in Kansas
where they ran several grocery stores of their
own, they moved back to Nebraska with
their three children to start a cattle ranch.
For a long time. I thought this was a story
of one woman giving up her dreams just to
raise three brats. She was a soccer mom
before such a political demographic even
had a name. 1 heard on the radio yesterday
morning that moms today spend more time
in their minivans than they do in the kitchen
or helping kids with homework. No regrets,
she used to say. 1 couldn't really appreciate
this lifestyle because 1 had different plans.

Then I think about what would happen if
my mother had actually had a full-time job
in addition to her farm work, church work
and kid work: I would never see her.
Fortunately, she was always around,
especially when I needed her. When Mr.
Snuffalupagus got left behind when the rest
of Sesame Street Hew to Puerto Rico, my
mother almost called the network to ask
how they could traumatize her daughter by
leaving Snuffy all alone.
She was one of those moms who showed
up to all of her kids' events and competitions.
Nary a cross country meet passed when I
didn't hear her yelling for me and handing
out Gatorade at the finish line. Even though
she supported us, she still kept us humble.
"Now don't go bragging." she would say.
She's many things I am not. She's incred
ibly patient; I'm a Sesame Street kid who
has trouble sitting still. She sings wonderful
ly; I'm Janey One-Note.
Apparently, I'm not the only one with
genetic issues. I asked my youngest brother,
Kris, what he inherited from Mom. "My
cleaning habits come from her," he joked as
he kicked a pathway through the clothes
carpeting his floor. He thought a long time
before coming up with a solid conclusion: "I
think I was adopted. I don't have any
traits."
Granted, she did give me my near-sight
edness. my limp hair and some of my shy
ness. but she gave me a few positive charac
teristics, too. namely my cute feet and

inquisitiveness. My brother, Kurtis, got the
great voice and huge heart. And contrary to
his adoption theory, which actually came
from years of teasing by his older siblings,
Kris got all Mom's looks and an interest in
collecting things.
Mom is the super glue that holds togeth
er our weird little family. She's a datebook
organizer, a moral code and a superhuman
with boundless energy. She still gets excited
over little things like watching birds from
the window (she knows the birds of central
Nebraska just by their calls). Even after
years of careful study, I still don't know how
she does it.
I don't doubt that I could do the whole
mother thing, but I don't think I could ever
do it in the tremendous way she did.
In junior high, I walked into the snack
bar of a livestock auction house in Loup
City, close to where my mother grew up.
The cashier did a double-take when she saw
me and leaned over the counter to get a bet
ter look. "Why, you're Betty Shotkoski's...
er ... Young's daughter, aren't you?"
I smiled, harkening back to the first
Communion photo of the girl who grew up
to be my mother. That's one of the nicest
things anyone's ever said to me.
Kurtis, Kris and I think she's a pretty
neat lady.

Kelly Young, a senior majoring in history,
hopes she finally has a column she can show
her mother.
