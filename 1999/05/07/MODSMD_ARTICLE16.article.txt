White-collars are dirty
Jocelyn Wiener's column on the use of
inmate labor makes several good points
about the repulsiveness of this situation and
its resemblance to slavery. I lowever, I think
that the inmate labor program, while deeply
Hawed, is not necessarily beyond repair. II
such a labor program is to remain in place,
it must be expanded to include prisoners
convicted of so-called "white-collar" crimes.
The usual flimsy justification for such
inmate labor programs is some variation on
"giving something back to society," "learn
ing the value of honest work." "learning to
respect other people's property." and so on.
Clearly, the people most in need of learning
such lessons are white-collar criminals:
I INK) ("EOs who pocket millions of dollars
while denying patients basic care, industry
leaders who bathe entire towns in carcino
gens and so on.
White-collar crime is a major problem in
this country, and it affects everyone in the
form of high health care costs. S&L
bailouts, a ruined and poisonous environ
ment and schools and other public services
that have been stripped of the money they
need to operate. Yet punishment for those
responsible, on the rare occasions when it is
forthcoming, is usually in the form of "con
finement" to a minimum-security country
club. Every time I see another transparent
ly poll-reactive political advertisement

promising to "get tough on crime." I wish
that these candidates were serious about
controlling the corporate practices that are
responsible for destroying the quality ol life
of the average American.
So I say let there be a chain gang with
junk-bond-kings-tui ned-born again-( htis
tians working side-by-side with the more
conventional inmates. After all. if wealthy
corporate slea/eballs were being sent off to
the chain gang, we would have a Constitu
tional amendment prohibiting inmate labor
proposed and ratified 011 a same-day basis.

Chough I agree with Jocelyn Wiener that
prisoners are fully entitled to basic human
rights, her article seemed primarily to high
light the demonization of corporate Ameri
ca that is so rampant on this campus.
She seems to suggest that companies like
McDonald's, K Mart and Eddie Bauer
shepherd criminals into prison to exploit
their labor. This is hardly the reality of the
situation. Should a federal prisoner be enti
tled to the same wage rate as a law-abiding
citizen? If the controversy stems from cheap
prison labor supplanting job opportunities
for hard-working Americans, a true prob
lem exists. The article, however, failed to
make this case.

Suggesting that prison labor is "modern
slavery" is dubious at best. My intention is
not to argue that the U.S. criminal justice
system is problem-free; far from il, the
expense and overcrowding of our prisons
ought to be a major concern — which, to be
fair, the article did note. However, Ms.
Wiener's logic seems to imply that this is a
result of the corporate desire to find ever
cheaper labor. America's federal prisons
are not "dangerous, abusive and over
crowded" due solely to the quest for inex
pensive labor.
The need for reform in our prison sys
tem, however great, cannot be pinned to
corporate America. The problems run far
deeper in our society. In affixing blame, we
ought to look harder for a scapegoat.

Elizabeth Chesler's letter in Tuesday's
Daily proposed the reasonable goal of
safer campus walkways, but was perhaps
remiss in suggesting fair and practical (not
to mention popular) means by which it can
be met. Placing the blame entirely on
malicious Stanford bicyclists "causing such
peril" to innocent pedestrians, she failed
to recognize the responsibilities of all
intraeampus travelers.
Specifically. 1 would like to propose

the Cardinal (no pun intended) Rule of
eampus transportation: Pay attention.
That's it. I've never witnessed an accident
or near-miss caused by anything else. For
example — and this one happens all the
time — consider a bicyclist who makes a
turn without checking to make sure
there's nobody right beside him not mak
ing the turn. Either the guy going straight
has really good reflexes (and brakes) or
the person turning is going to be responsi
ble for quite a mess. Pedestrians must
adhere to this rule just as strictly. Just
because you're on foot doesn't mean you
have the right of way. Think before you
walk into a major mall while rubberneck
ing to check out the girl behind you;
declining to drive a vehicle on campus
does not entitle you to abandon your
responsibilities.
These suggestions are idealistic, I
admit. After all, we do live in the age of
car phones and Disemans, and people
aren't accustomed to paying a lot of atten
tion to the traffic — cars, bikes or whatev
er — around them. So travel defensively.
Keep one hand on the brakes all the time
because you never know when someone
else might not be watching. Which
reminds me, Ms. Chesler, if you "looked
both ways before proceeding" and "all of
a sudden there's a bicyclist," then you
didn't look every way, did you?
