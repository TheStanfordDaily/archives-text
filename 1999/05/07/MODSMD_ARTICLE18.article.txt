TIM-. NEO-FASCIST regime under
which I currently live (sometimes
known as New York City in the Ciiu
liani era) a few months ago enacted a fairly
Draconian policy: Ciet arrested for driving
under the influence, and the government will
seize your car. Not. mind you. once you've
been convicted after a speedy trial, bv a jury
ol your peers and all of that other Constitu
tional mumbo-jumbo. Immediately. At the
time of your arrest.
And il you're found not guilty of the DUI
charge? Big deal. (iiuliani says it doesn't nec
essarily mean you'll get your car back. "Let's
just say somebody is acquitted, and it's one of
those acquittals in which the person was
guilty but there is just not quite enough evi
dence beyond a reasonable doubt," the
mayor reasoned. "That might be a situation
in which the car would still be forfeited." Hut
that reasonable doubt thing, the naive among
us might ask. isn't that supposed to protect
the innocent from, say, a government trying
to steal their stuff? Fuggedaboudit. As the
saying goes: It's (iiuliani time.
When that policy was instituted, news
about it was everywhere. The papers here in

New York, the television news, those little
coming-up-at-11 ads during "ER" — they
were all talking about the new drunk-driving
law. Which made me start thinking about
why it is that people drive drunk in the first
place. And that brought me to one of my oft
repeated but unsuccessful proposals for the
betterment of my beloved University. Junk
Jamba Juice, pull Polio's; there should be a
full-blown liquor store in Tresidder Union.
When I think back to times in my life that
I've driven when less than entirely sober, it's
been for a simple reason. (Note to any law
enforcement or parental types: For purposes
of this column, we'll stipulate that anytime I
was behind the wheel I would have blown
maybe a .04. tops.) It wasn't because I was
oblivious to the reality that I'd had too much
to drink or because I'd convinced myself that
I'm just as good a driver with a few brews in
me as without. It wasn't because I was in
some sort of Willy Loman-esque depression,
trying to kill myself in a so-called accident,
and it wasn't on a dare.
When I've driven with a few drinks under
my belt, it was because driving was somehow
necessary to the social activity of drinking

with friends. In some cases, it was coming
home from one of Palo Alto's fine libation
ary establishments (mind you, I was on the
Farm prior to the weekend-night Marguerite
extensions), and in other cases it was running
to Safeway or Ernie's to replenish dwindling
supplies of booze.
Righteous though we believe ourselves to
be. and enlightened though we are, I am only
one among many who, against our better
judgment, made that slightly wobbly trip
down Santa Cruz Avenue from the Goose or
up Sand Hill Road to the Secret Safeway.
There's surely a demand for booze on cam
pus; a liquor store would provide the neces
sary supply, obviating the need for drinking
students to drive back and forth to their grog
house of choice for their beverage purchases.
It's an obvious solution, and, as such,
there must be a snafu. In this case, it's simple
do-gooder Puritanism on the part of the Uni
versity. In fin de siecle higher education,
we've created a singularly evil campus
boogeyman: the binge drinker. To hinge
drink, say the public-health folks, is for a man
to have more than five drinks in an evening,
or for a woman to have more than four. To

binge drink, in other words, is to be a normal
college student on a weekend night.
Student-affairs administrators at Stanford
and, for that matter, nationwide — have
identified binge drinking as among the most
pressing crises facing college students, and
they go to great lengths both to demonize it
and stamp it out. To open a liquor store in
one of the retail spaces in Tresidder would be
to allow the perception that the University is
not doing all it can to fight this horrible habit.
Maybe binge drinking is a bad thing. (I
think it is not. and that its importance is far
oversold.) But even it is, that doesn't mean
we can't still look for ways to mitigate its
deleterious side effects. Of course the Uni
versity doesn't want to be seen as encourag
ing drinking, but who says that facing up to
reality and opening a liquor store would be
an encouragement to drink rather than sim
ply an acknowledgement of the status quo?
Premarital sex. for example, is something
that no one the University hierarchy would
encourage. Nevertheless, they acknowledge
it happens and they allow Cowell and other
campus organizations to distribute free con
doms, to make sure that when it does hap

pen, it happens safely. Likewise, making
alcohol easily and proximately available to
Stanford students would be to recognize that
students drink, and that when they do, they
should be able to do it as safely as possible.
Stanford's policies on alcohol for the most
part do just that. The recent case of the
drunken pro fro is an example not of the
safety-net philosophy's failure but of its suc
cess. Rather than forcing the student behind
a closed door to drink, it allowed her to test
her own limits in an atmosphere where
numerous dormmates and RAs tended to
her in sickness. As my friend and colleague
David Stein wrote about that incident: "The
alcohol culture on this campus seems to be
not destructive but responsible." Eliminating
the need for students to drive to off-campus
establishments for their booze would only
serve to make that culture more responsible.
It's simple, really. And you'd have to be
drunk to think otherwise.
