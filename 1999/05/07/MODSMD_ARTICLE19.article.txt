title, having earned filth-, fouth
and third-place finishes in the past
three years.
Junior Elissa Keszler has seen
two consolation final games, and
the sophomore class remembers
what it was like losing in the semifi
nals to California last year. All
players returners and freshmen
alike are excited and ready for a
chance to be a part of a champi
onship game.
"We feel loose, limber and
ready to play," said Cardinal top
scorer Margie Dingeldein, a fresh
man.
I he tournament lasts three days
with 16 teams battling for a chance
to play in the championship match
oil Sunday afternoon. Other top
seeds include No. 1 I JSC (26-2),
No. 3 California (26-5) and No. 4
UCLA (21-9).
lint this does not mean that all
sights are set upon just the champi
onship match. Stanford will focus
its attention on the process.
"We are mentally prepared,"
said sophomore goalie Alii Henry.
"We will not repeat our mistake of

last year — focusing only on the
championship game. This year we
are going to focus on getting into
the championship game. Once we
are there, we are confident that
things will take care of them
selves."
The Cardinal takes on No. 15
Michigan (33-8) this morning at 8
a.m. Stanford is 3-0 all-time against
the Wolverines with the last two
meetings at the 1997 and 1998 Na
tional Championship Tourna
ments. The Cardinal expects to
win. but emotions always run high
during the tournament. Stanford
plans to come out hard for this
game and play with the intensity it
will need to sustain it throughout.
If all goes well for the Cardinal,
the team will lace the winner of No.
7 IK -Davis (24-10) and No. 10
Massaachusetts (29-6) today at 3
p.m.
In the past four years, Stanford
is 20-0 in games against the Aggies.
This year, Stanford has played the
Aggies twice. The first meeting was
a home match and a Stanford 4-1
victory. The last time the teams
faced each other was at the North
ern California Regional Qualifer.
With a shot from Dingeldein, Stan
ford managed a 3-2 sudden death

win, then went on to beat Cal for
the tournament title.
UMass won the East Coast
Oualifier to advance to Nationals
and has an impressive record this
season. Only seniors Heather
Crary, Nicole Glazer and Lindsay
Tam, and Keszler have played
UMass before. The match was in
the second round of Nationals two
years ago. Stanford won 10-2.
If Stanford wins the first two
games and third-seeded Cal wins
its first two, the two teams will face
each other in the semifinals at 4
p.m. tomorrow. The Cardinal is 3-2
against the Bears this season with
its last victory two weeks ago in the
finals of the Nor Cal Regional
Qualifier.
The game promises to be a "Big
Game" considering this season's
record as well as the long-standing
rivalry between Cal and Stanford.
The teams have played in many
semifinal matches over the years,
including the semifinals of the 1998
National Championship.
The final game on Sunday could
pit Stanford against top-ranked
USC. The Cardinal has yet to beat
the Trojans this season, hut in the
end, this is the only game that will
count.
