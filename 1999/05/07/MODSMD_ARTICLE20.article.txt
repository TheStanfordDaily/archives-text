WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ Tomorrow-Sunday: Stanford (17-
4, 10-1 Women's Western Lacrosse
League) hosts the WWL.L Final
Four, all day. New Maloney Field.

Earlier this season the Cardinal
rose to the challenge and defeated
non-conference teams such as
Pennsylvania, Holy Cross,
Rudolph-Macon and Denver. This
weekend Stanford will have anoth
er chance when it faces UCLA in
the WWLL Final Four at New
Maloney Field.
If the Cardinal emerges victori
ous. Sunday it will play the winner
of Cal-Poly and Davis for the
championship title.
"We are very optimistic about
our upcoming' game." said head
coach 1 leidi Connor. "It will be re
freshing and challenging to play an
opponent that we haven't played

before this season."
The only taste of southern Cali
fornia women's lacrosse play that
Stanford has had this season was its

game against UC-Santa Barbara
that ended in a 13-9 win for the
Cardinal. The women are hoping
to have a similar victory against the

Bruins.
Although the Cardinal has en

joyed a near flawless season, the
women are careful not to take any
teams for granted.
UCLA, the No. 3 seed from the
South, has already had one upset in
the tournament with its victory
over No. 2 Claremont in first round
action.
The women know it's tourna
ment time and anything can hap
pen.
"We're at a tough point in our
season. We haven't played anyone
who's been a challenge for a
month," said senior Stephanie
Tuerk. "It is important to get fo
cused because this weekend will
not be a walk in the park like our
games recently."
The Cardinal has been in this
position before, having won the
whole tournament two of the past
four years. The women feel they
are ready and have the winning
combination to defend their title.
Stanford will no doubt be rely
ing heavily on leading goal-scorers
sophomore Katharine Barnes, who
has scored 45 goals this season, and
freshman Caroline Osterwise who

lias contributed 39.
Defensively, the team looks to
the consistently strong play of
freshman Patti Zettler and goalie
Tuerk, who has 145 saves for 255
shots this season.
However, the women know
their play in the Final Four will
need to be a total team effort in
order to ensure the championship.
"In order to win. we need to play
our game, to play solid defense and
come up with the goals on offense,"
said senior co-captain Alexis Ra
ti i/io. "I think it will be a solid team
effort that will drive us to success,
rather than any one individual
dominating the field."
Connor has confidence that the
skills of her team will carry them
through.
"It is the time of year when you
focus on fine-tuning your game,"
Connor said. "We are working on
our stall, how to break a stall, run
ning through our plays, perfecting
our new /.one defense. All of these
tilings, we hope, will contribute to
our success on the field this week
end."
Fhe team's only worry recently
has been its mental focus and game
intensity. But the C ardinal is count
ing on the adrenaline from the ex

citement of the tournament and the
home-field advantage to give it the
edge this weekend.
"I think we peaked a few weeks
ago but have been able to maintain
that level." Barnes said. "We
should be able to keep the intensity
up because it's the Final Four and
we hosting it. I think our skills and
chemistry as a team are right
there."
With this weekend's Final Four,
the women are hoping to prove
their progress not only to them
selves and fans but also to the na
tional lacrosse community. It is all
part of the women's dream of get
ting a NCAA bid and thusexposing
them to tougher competition avail
able outside of ('alifornia.
"We want to demonstrate to the
lacrosse community just how far
Stanford has come in the last few
years. I his program has changed
significantly, and we want everv
one to know it." Connor said.
"We need to stay more focused
for the entirety of the games and
concentrate on winning the
WWLL decisively," Patrizio said.
"That will help Stanford gain
recognition nationally, which in
turn will help the lacrosse program
over the next couple of years."
