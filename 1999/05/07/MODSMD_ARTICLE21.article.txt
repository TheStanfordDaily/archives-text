"The conference has been really
tough this year." Wiginton said.
"When you are in a conference that is

Both twin bills this weekend will
be rematches for the Cardinal. Stan

son, winning both games, 3-2 and 4-3.
Oregon State took two from the Car

the Stanford Softball Complex. The

One player on the Beaver team
that Stanford must look out for is
