and his team the meet will serve as a tune-up
lor the championship season that begins in just
two weeks at the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships in Tempe, Ariz.
"We tried to create a situation where we
would be working through the first part of the
season," Lananna said. "Then we had the Cal
dual meet being a place where we could put
ourselves in a position where we could start to
prepare for a competitive athlete against ath
lete [situation]. Now what we're doing is trying
to tune up and run faster.
" The bottom line is we're trying to improve
performances and that's not something I often

say. hut that's what we're alter this weekend."
To foster his goals. Lananna has made the
meet a big attraction among the top distance
runners in the country on a weekend in which
another Bay Area meet, the Modesto Relays,

the beginning, then dropping out. in order to
ensure fast times from the rest of the field —

gling to return to her past form after missing

even more interesting for Stanford
fans. If she performs well she could
be a substantial boon to the Cardinal
at Pac-l()s.

Julia Stamps will look to lead the
way in the former against a tough
squad featuring a host of athletes
from Stanford's cross-country rival.

Mary Cobb compete, although she
may race in the S,(XM) instead.

make our own races and make some
decisions that will put us in a position
to make sure that there are some fast
times," Lananna said.
