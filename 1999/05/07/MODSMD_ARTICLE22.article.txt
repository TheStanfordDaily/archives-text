tional, all day. Cobb Track and Angell Field.

Today Cobb Track and Angel I Field plays
host to the Cardinal Invitational. For Lananna
and his team the meet will serve as a tune-up
lor the championship season that begins in just
two weeks at the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships in Tempe, Ariz.
"We tried to create a situation where we
would be working through the first part of the
season," Lananna said. "Then we had the Cal
dual meet being a place where we could put
ourselves in a position where we could start to
prepare for a competitive athlete against ath

to tune up and run faster.
" The bottom line is we're trying to improve
performances and that's not something I often

say. hut that's what we're alter this weekend."
To foster his goals. Lananna has made the
meet a big attraction among the top distance
runners in the country on a weekend in which
another Bay Area meet, the Modesto Relays,
attracts great sprinters.
