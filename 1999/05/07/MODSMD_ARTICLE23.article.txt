MEN S TRACK
■ Today: Stanford hosts the Cardinal Invita
tional. all day. Cobb Track and Angell Field.

* Tonight's Invitational at Stanford's Cobb
Track and Angell Field will feature the very
best that the United States has to offer in
tei ms of distance running.
And just for kicks, a few international stars
in the middle distances will be on hand to
showcase a bit of world-class speed.
"In terms of pure athleticism, this may be
one of the greatest events Stanford has ever
hosted — this is big-time." said Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna. "The 10,000 may turnout
to be the fastest ever run on United States
soil."
The current best stands at 27 minutes.
25.<52 seconds, set by Kenyan Simon
Chemoiywo in 1995.
As runners from around the nation gather
attempting to pick up qualifying times for the
United States and World Track and Field

Championships. Cardinal athletes will be
right in the mix.
The big race of the night for Stanford will
be the 10,0(X) meters, stated for 9:40 p.m. Stan
ford juniors Brad and Brent Hauserwill be in
a group eyeing the World Championships
standard of 28 minutes, 10.00 seconds.
Though the Mausers hold personal bests of
28:16.60 and 28:32.39, respectively, they will
be helped along by professional pacesetters
who have agreed to go through 5.0(H) meters
at 14:03 and then let the pack loose.
The race's designated rabbits are Pascal
Dobert, America's top steeple chaser, and
Ryan Wilson, a former Arkansas runner with
a 5,000 personal best of 13:28.67. But the man
who will most likely set the tone of the race
will be America's best distance runner. Bob
Kennedy.
Kennedy, a 1996 Olympian who holds the
American Record of 12:58.21 in the 5,000
(that's approximately equal to 3.1 miles run at
a pace of 4:10 per mile), is scheduled to make
his 10.000-meter professional debut tonight.
And though the lO.(XK) will no doubt live
up to expectations, the 800 and 1,500-meter
races may be even more competitive. Luke
Kipkosgei. a Kenyan currently ranked second
in the world in the 5,000, is slated to race the
1,500. He has a personal best of 3:35.49. Stan
ford senior Jake Maas will also be in that race.
