# Young faces favorite opponent as St. Mary's returns
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
When St. Mary's last came to
Stanford, Feb. 10, the Gaels
stepped in to face an inexperi
enced. fairly unknown Cardinal
pitcher — Jason Young.
That night at Sunken Diamond,
the sophomore allowed no runs on
only three hits and one walk while
striking out a then-career-high
nine batters to earn his first win on
the year.
Tonight St. Mary's comes to
Palo Alto again for a one-game
nonconference set and. once more,
the Gaels will find the lanky, confi
dent right-hander on the mound.
However, they will not find the
same pitcher.
Since that chilly February
evening, Young has gone on to
much bigger and better things.
Now 7-3 with a 3.25 ERA. he
has established himself as one of
the best pitchers in the nation.
Among other accomplishments,
Young is leading the team with 129
strikeouts and is holding opposing
batters to a Pacific 10 Conference
low .209 average.
Yesterday he was further recog
nized for his stellar season when
USA Baseball gave him one of 33
invitations to its 1999 National
Team summer camp.
II Young is on his game tonight
talking to opposing batters,
pumping his arm and snapping his
head back after a particularly nasty
pitch — this should just be another
chance to pad his already weighty
statistics.

The Gaels (20-26). never a col
lege baseball power, are not mak
ing any more waves this year in the
Pepperdine-dominated West
Coast Conference. St. Mary's is in
third place in the league's four
team West Division.

■ Today: No. 6 Stanford (35-12) vs.
St. Mary's (20-26). 7 p.m. Sunken
Diamond.

SeniorsOlin C0han(.353,2 MR.
25 RBI) and Travis Kerhode (.330.
14, 53) lead the Gaels offensively
but, overall, they are not threaten
ing at the plate.
In fact, the team has a lower
overall average (.284) than its op
ponents (.289) and has combined
for a staggering 338 strikeouts in 46
games — an average of more than
seven a game.
Young should be drooling.
With three scheduled starts left
in the regular season, he needs only
27 more strikeouts — an average of
nine a game — to tie Kyle Peter
son's Stanford season strikeout
record. Presently, Young is tied for
fifth on the list with former major
league All-Star Jack McDowell.
Tonight's game has a greater
role, though, than to simply give
Young another chance to inch up
the Cardinal record book.
With Stanford (35-12) two
games ahead of IJSC in the Pac-10
title race, head coach Mark Mar
quess would like to see Young stay
sharp before his possible champi

Junior Nick Day slides safely earlier this season. Tonight, Day and the Cardinal face St. Mary's at Sunken Diamond. Stanford has already
defeated the Gaels once this season.
