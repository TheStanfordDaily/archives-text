Wallets stolen
A combination of break-ins and unattended be
longings resulted in a rash of wallet thefts on campus
last week.
Sophomore Nigel Tse left his Lexus in the parking
lot across the street from the Arrillaga Family Sports
( enter when he went to work out last Tuesday night.
"I left my wallet in the compartment between the
passenger and driver seat," said Tse. "When we came
back, the passenger window was smashed and my wal
let was gone."
Police were called to the scene, but they have no
suspects.
On Saturday night, a wallet was stolen from a room
in Enchanted Broccoli Forest. A purple vinyl Mossimo
wallet was left on a desk in a resident's room.
I he next day, the owner realized that the wallet was
missing. Any doubt on whether it was a theft was re
i moved when Visa confirmed that someone attempted
to make a $2,(XX) purchase over the Internet.
"No one reported any suspicious people in the
area." said Stanford Police Sgt. Hilary Karp. "It could
have been someone in the house or someone just walk
ing through."
Wallets were also reported stolen at the Bookstore,
I'residder, and the ( law after Dolliesplash.

Indecent exposure
Travelers by Lasuen Mall last Monday around 5
p.m. saw and heard more than they wanted of a
young man outside Cubberley Auditorium.
Facing the Quad with pants un/ipped, the other
wise fully clothed man was masturbating and yelling
"Look what I'm doing" to passers-by.
A female student who was accosted went to
Meyer and spoke to a building manager, who re
ported the incident to police.
The suspect is described as a white man with dark
hair who was last seen wearing an orange shirt, dark
pants and bright orange socks.
" This is not related to our previous incidents of
indecent exposure," said Karp. Over spring break, a
man wearing pants with the groin area removed
startled a female student at night by Wilbur.
No arrests have been made in the case.
"There's not much you can do to prevent these
incidents," said Karp. "But when you have someone
who's repeating, then we can get info out and have
more potential witnesses alerted."
