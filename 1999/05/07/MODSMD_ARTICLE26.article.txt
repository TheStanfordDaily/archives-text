# Ten years' good counsel
## Hudson, 30-year Farm vet, leaves ASSU legal service 
### Alice Brown Staff writer 
After 10 years as Legal Counsel
ing Office Assistant and more than 30
years at Stanford. Jewel Hudson will
retire in June.
Hudson plans to spend more time
working with her husband for their
company, Jewson Enterprises, a
medical engineering analytical com
pany.
As the legal counseling office as
sistant. Hudson talks to students who
have problems unrelated to the Uni
versity and recommends a lawyer for
them to consult.
She sees students who have needs
ranging from insurance help to
prenuptial agreements.
However, Hudson "goes above
and beyond her job," said former
ASSU Vice President Santos Marro
quin, a junior.
Hudson said one of her strengths
is knowing people outside of Stan

ford who are able to help students.
She told the story of a student who
received a letter that he had won a
brand-new, full-sized Cadillac. The
only thing he had to do to get it was
pay taxes on it. After scrounging up
money from friends in the dormitory,
he sent it in and waited for his car.
A couple of weeks later he re
ceived a large box in the mail, and on
opening it found a brand-new, full
sized, inflatable convertible.
Hudson was able to recommend a
lawyer, but also found a friend who
owned a Cadillac dealership and was
willing to buy the inflatable car to use
it for advertising.
"People like that help me to make
life a little more pleasant for stu
dents." she said.
Hudson came to Stanford in 1971
with her husband, who was a student.
She has held four different jobs on
campus â€” a part-time librarian in
Lane Medical Library, assistant reg
istrar at the Law School, and a cancer

insurance specialist at the medical
school.
She took her current job in 19K9.
"This is the best job on campus," she
said. "You get to see bright and fun
students all the time, and there is al
ways something you can do for
them."
According to her, another of her
strengths in her job is the fact that she
knows many people at Stanford in
positions of power that she can send
students to for help.
"She's great about getting stu
dents involved," Marroquin said.
"She is the first adult I've trusted
here."
" The greatest thing about this job
is learning from the students," said
Hudson. " They stimulate you and
keep you young."
"The ASSU is losing a lot," Mar
roquin said.
Hudson says she will miss the stu
dents and her job as well. "It's been a
kick."
