### David Arulanantham Staff writer 
Featuring this year's theme of
"Honoring Our Students," the 2Sth
annual Stanford Powwow will begin
on Friday evening in Eucalyptus
Grove at the corner of C 'ampus Drive
and Galvez Road. It is being spon
sored by the Stanford American In
dian Organization.
The Stanford Powwow is the
largest student-run event of its kind
in the United States, and one of the
oldest, and more than 3().(XX) people
from hundreds of different Native
American tribes are expected on
campus.
Lasting through Sunday after
noon. the event will feature dancing
and drumming competitions as well
as competitions for the best costume.
In addition, there will also be a num
ber of vendors selling food, jewelry
and other items.
Although the great majority of
those present will be from the United
States, there will also be a number of
people from the native peoples of
Canada, Mexico, and Central Amer
ica. Some of the competitions, in fact,
will also feature several aspects of
Aztec and Mayan culture in an effort
to broaden the scope of the event be
yond the United States.
Powwows are thought to have
originally been gatherings of large
tribal groups, at a time where distant

family could meet and socialize, al
though in more recent years they
have evolved into a Pan-Indian phe
nomenon.
According to sophomore Nizhoni
Hodge, co-coordinator of the event,
the Stanford Powwow "tends to be a
contest powwow where people come
also for the various competitions and
prize money." Among those attend
ing the festivities however, will also
be parents of students and alumni.
"In many ways it's like a Parents'
weekend and Homecoming Week
end for the Indian community, said
Hodge. The event, which will cost
more than $80,(XX). will be financed
by money from SAIO's special fee
from the ASSU, vendor fees, sales of
various items and sponsorship from
local businesses and alumni.
Because of logistical concerns
about the size of the event, planning
started in the beginning of the year
and involved around 25 students. De
spite the numerous difficulties associ
ated with planning such a large event,
Hodge feels it is worthwhile.
"What drives us to sacrifice a lot of
our time is our family and the lact
that we love to be with people." she
added.
In addition to the main activities,
there will also be a five-kilometer
race and one-mile fun run /walk on
Saturday. For more information visit
