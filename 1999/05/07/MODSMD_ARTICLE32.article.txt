## 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
The 1998-99 school year at
Stanford has seen some memo
rable moments.
In December, as fall quarter
classes were wrapping up.
Provost Condoleezza Rice
announced her departure from
the Provost's Office after six
years effective in June.
"I'm going to miss almost
everything about her. Not only
was she a really great provost,
she was a really great friend and I
am going to be sorry to see her
go," University President Ger
hard Casper said.
In April. Dean of Engineering
John Hennessy was chosen to
succeed Rice. The University
also announced Law Prof. Kath
leen Sullivan would replace retir
ing Law School Dean Paul Brest,
and Australian banker Robert
Joss was named Michael
Spence's successor at the Gradu
ate School of Business.
Controversy surrounded the
University in February, when it
became known that the Universi
ty was the potential target of a
U.S. Labor Department investi
gation into alleged gender dis
crimination, as a result of a 400-
page complaint filed by 15 cur
rent and former female faculty
and staff.
"No one in this complaint is
askiiig for a preference," said for
mer Asst. History Prof. Karen
Sawislak, one of the com
plainants. "We're asking to be
evaluated based on our qualifica
tions."
"We're asking the government
to see if Stanford is in compli
ance" with federal affirmative
action laws designed to combat
"unconscious bias," she said.
The investigation is still under
way.
In October. Phi Delta Theta
senior Michael Howard fell off of
a balcony at the fraternity's
house at 680 Lomita Drive after
drinking.
Howard was briefly in a coma
following the accident, but has

since recovered. An investigation
following the incident deter
mined that the Phi Delts violated
the terms of their probation
stemming from an alcohol-relat
ed incident during the previous
spring's Rush. The University
evicted the fraternity, and in
March revoked the group's char
ter.
"The conditions of the chap
ter's probation were very clear*
the chapter understood those
conditions and the end result was
that they simply couldn't abide
by them." said Rudy Porchivina,
Bay Area regional president of
Phi Delta Theta.
Before classes even started,
the Stanford in Moscow program
was canceled due to the crash of
the ruble and accompanying
political turmoil in Russia. Stan
ford was the only university to
cancel its program, and many stu
dents were disappointed.
Also in early September, the
University announced plans to
address the graduate student and
staff housing shortage by build
ing 480 new units in Escondido
Village for graduate students,
and 450 units for faculty and staff
near Campus Drive West.
"We believe the housing
shortage is a long-term problem,
and we decided that if we are
going to do something for our
students and faculty, we should
do it now." said Larrv Horton.
University director of community
and government relations.
In February, the University
announced a new residential col
lege program for freshmen and
sophomores. The Freshman /
Sophomore College will house
ISO students in a unique living
and learning environment.
Perhaps the year's greatest tri
umph for Stanford came when a
long-closed campus institution
opened il doors for the first time
in 10 years.
After a shutdown caused by
the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake. the Stanford Art Museum
reopened in February in expand
ed form as the Gerald B. and Iris
Cantor Center for the Arts.
