# 1999: The year in sports
## 
### 
Only on the Farm would an ath
letic department he upset over not
having won a national title by May.
While the 1998-99 school year
has yet to bring Stanford any varsi
ty championships, the Cardinal has
excelled in several sports and is
well on its way to winning a fourth
straight Sears Cup.
The Cardinal men's soccer team
highlighted the fall season, riding a
wave all the way to the Final Four
before losing to Indiana in the title
game. Both Stanford cross-country
teams also fared well, as the men
finished second and the women
third at nationals. And the Cardinal
men's water polo team fell in a dou
ble-overtime heartbreaker in the
NCAA finals.
Stanford had more near misses
in the winter as men's and women's
swimming both came close — but
ultimately finished second in —
national meets.
Men's basketball, a preseason
title contender, won its first-ever
Pacific 10 Conference title but
bowed out of the NCAA tourna
ment early with a second-round

loss to Gonzaga. Stil 1. the Cardinal
had a strong season and coach
Mike Montgomery became the
winningest coach in the school's
men's basketball history when
Stanford beat Arizona State at
home in February.
Perennial powerhouses women's
basketball and women's volleyball
both advanced to NCAAs. as did
men's and women's gymnastics.
The Cardinal fencing team
brought home three individual
titles, but not a team title, from its
national competition
Looking ahead. Stanford still
has some good shots at national
titles. Both the men's and women's
tennis teams are enjoying strong
seasons, and the Cardinal baseball
squad is ranked sixth in the coun
try. Softball could also surprise at
nationals. Women's water polo
could win the school's first top tro
phy of the year this weekend.
Still, Stanford is running away
with the Sears Cup standings,
which makes the lack of a national
title a decidedly Stanfordian dilem
ma.
