# Berkeley hunger strike continues
## Negotiators meet Berdahl today 
### Ann Kim Editorial staff 
After last Tuesday's arrest of 83
student demonstrators at UC-
Berkeley, including five from Stan
ford, support has grown stronger
for the hunger strike that is now en
tering its eighth day, while a chance
for breaking the stalemate between
students and administrators over
ethnic studies has emerged.
Student negotiators will meet
with UC-Berkeley Chancellor
Robert Berdahl at 9 a.m. today to
discuss their demands, which in
clude the hiring of more tenured
ethnic studies professors, a restora
tion of funds that have been cut
from the Ethnic Studies Depart
ment and the creation of a research
center on race and gender. They
will then hold a rally at noon to an
nounce whether any agreements
have been reached.
Numerous UC-Berkeley faculty
members. Bay Area politicians and
community activists have ex
pressed their support for the
protesting students, and the num
ber of people attending daily rallies
continues to grow, with about 600
present yesterday evening.
Stanford students have contin
ued their support of the protests,
caravanning to the UC-Berkeley
campus throughout the day and
even spending the night outside
California Hall, the building con
taining Berdahl's office, where
demonstrators have set up camp.
Stanford students will hold their
own rally today at 1 p.m. outside of
Cubberley Education Building.
Students from Stanford making
the trips to UC-Berkeley to pro
vide support to the hunger strikers
continued to express concerns
about the effects a decline in ethnic
studies at UC-Berkeley could have
for students evervwhere.

"Ethnic studies is one of the
only places in the university that
challenges the entire way history
has been written, and without that
challenge, we'll be ignorant of the
struggles people went through to
make a more equal society," said
Jennifer Wekselbaum. a sopho
more who has attended several ral
lies on the UC-Berkeley campus.
Though the two schools on op
posite sides of the Bay often share
a fierce rivalry in athletics and aca
demics, any animosity between
Stanford and UC-Berkeley has
fallen by the wayside in light of per
ceived threats to UC-Berkeley's
ethnic studies programs.
"We're rivals and everything,
but if this happened to us, they'd
step up and help us out too. This
issue goes across school bound
aries." said Travis Helms, a fresh
man. Helms added that he believes
a similar lack of support for ethnic
studies exists at Stanford.
"It's all the same struggle,"
agreed senior Susan O'Malley. "I
think it's important that all people
are represented in the university."
"When ethnic studies at Berke
ley is at risk, it has repercussions for
all other ethnic studies programs
including [Stanford's program in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity] because Berkeley's pro
gram is so prestigious," said junior
Chester Day.
One of the six hunger strikers.
UC-Berkeley senior Alison Har
rington. went to the hospital early
yesterday after police officers al
legedly prevented student protest
ers from getting sleep by turning on
floodlights and banging on doors
throughout the night.
Early yesterday morning, when
it seemed that police might once
again arrest protesters, 10 UC-
Berkeley professors joined with
students and declared that they
would be arrested along with them.
Additionally, the chair of UC-
Berkeley's Women's Studies De
partment. Norma Alarcon, has

joined the six students in their
hunger strike.
At a rally in front of California
Hall yesterday evening, UC-Berke
ley Ethnic Studies Prof. Ronald
Takaki told students that if Berdahl
is going to have them arrested
again, "he will also have to arrest
me!"
"I have a message for this chan

cellor." Takaki said. "Negotiate
with the students. Don't arrest
them. Don't use the police to harass
them."
The number of posters adorning
the wall of California Hall has also
grown, with signs of support from
numerous organizations, including
some at San Francisco State and
Stanford.
