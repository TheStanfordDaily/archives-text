# Remebering the beloved
## Candlelight White Plaza gathering honors victims of AIDS 
### Joshua Fried 
A handful of Stanford students
gathered in White Plaza last night
to honor and remember loved
ones lost to AIDS.
The vigil, sponsored by Volun
teers Increasing the Visibility of
AIDS and the Deans for Religious
Life, began with a poetry reading
and concluded with a prayer. Be
tween readings, participants lit
candles and shared personal ac
counts of lives touched by HIV
and AIDS.
Maurice Charles, associate
dean for religious life, facilitated
the assemblage with the help ol ju
nior Jessica Stanton, co-president
of VIVA. Although VIVA has
sponsored vigils in the past, this
was the first joint effort with the
office of Deans for Religious Life,
organizers said.
Charles stressed the impor
tance of the gathering in spreading
the visibility of AIDS-related is
sues.
"Even if only a few people
show and someone stops to ac
knowledge the reality of AIDS, it
may somehow touch those that
have HIV or AIDS." he said.
Stanton expressed concern
about the small turnout but felt
that VIVA accomplished its goals
in organizing the event.
"We wanted the vigil to be a

culmination for AIDS Awareness
Week and a way for Stanford stu
dents to express their concern for
the issues. We wanted to offer a
forum in which they'd be able to
talk about ways AIDS affected
their lives." she said.
Stanton also believed that Stan
ford students feel unaffected by
the impact of HIV and AIDS.
'"It's really easy at Stanford for
students not to consider things
they don't come into contact with
on a daily basis," said Stanton.
"AIDS is one of those things
that's easily pushed out of the
everyday consciousness. But it's
important if you're sexually active
and important if you're not. Our
community is affected and so is the
world at large," she said.
Cowell Student Health Center
estimates that one in 500 Stanford
students is infected with HIV. In
East Palo Alto, almost one in 50
residents is HIV-positive.

AIDS. On campus, volunteers dis

Awareness Week every spring.
Stanton cited VIVA's role on
campus as essential to maintaining

AIDS awareness.
"I think the organization serves
as a reminder to Stanford students
that AIDS is still a very real part of
our world," she said.
