# Nigerian writer tells of country's plight
## Ajibande tells of imprisonment and prospects for democracy 
### Joshua Robin Contributing writer 
In July 1995, journalist Kunle
Ajibade began what he thought

would be a life term in a squalid
Nigerian prison, charged with trea
son as an accessory to a coup at
tempt.
Last night, he spoke in Skilling

Auditorium as a speaker in a pro
gram sponsored partly by Stanford's
Center for African Studies and
laughed at the idiocy of the charges
against him.
He had nothing to do with any
coup attempt, the Ajibade said. He
was too busy evading authorities
cracking down on a press critical of
the government while Ajibade was
publishing an underground maga
zine in an avid reader's house.
It was a safe haven, although situ
ated perilously close to a police sta
tion.
"He didn't even charge us rent or
anything." Supportive readers,
Ajibade said, "are ready to go to the
whole hog for you."
It seemed incongruous to be
laughing when discussing Nigeria,
Africa's most populous nation, an
oil-rich country whose recent history
is wracked by widespread inequality,
poverty and state-sanctioned mur
der.
But the joviality was but a small
break in Ajibade's first-person ac
count — a speech and discussion de
tailing the torturous years under dic
tator Sani Abacha's rule and what
Ajibade says are limited prospects
for a democratic future.
"History keeps on repeating itself
in my country," Ajibade said softly.
A British possession until self-rule
began in 1966, Nigeria's government
has been a string of military dictator
ships and transient attempts at civil
ian rule. Abacha seized control in a
November 1993 coup and ruthlessly
ruled the country from 1993 to 1998.
In an attempt to report the atroc
ities and the corruption of Abacha's
government, Ajibade worked at sev
eral newspapers and magazines,
whose writers and editors worked
under police surveillance. Numer
ous journalists were arrested on

trumped-up charges. Ajibade was
detained in May 1995 and, three
months later, he was sentenced to life
in jail.
Ajibade would still be there
today, had the unexpected not oc
curred. On July 21, 1998, Abacha
died — according to Ajibade, when
the ruler was having sex with a pros
titute — and his successor. Gen. Ab
dulsalami Abubakar, released
dozens of prominent political de
tainees in an effort to promote "na
tional reconciliation." After three
years in prison, Ajibade was re
leased.
It began a time of hope, though a
tenuous one, according to Ajibade.
Less than a year later, the country
held elections monitored by interna
tional observers that included for
mer U.S. President Jimmy Carter
and Gen. Colin Powell, but Ajibade
says the election was still rife with
such inconsistencies as missing bal
lots and varying election times.
Additionally, Abubakar, the cur
rent president, has recently cracked
down on the press, recently ordering
several journalists detained. Addi
tionally, the newly elected leader,
Olusegun Obasanjo, who is to be
sworn in later this month, has also ex
pressed little tolerance for a free
press. Ajibade said that while a
farmer, Obasanjo raised a sign on his
property reading "No Dogs or Jour
nalists."
This situation leaves Ajibade —
who is currently a fellow at a pro
gram for journalists in Los Angeles
and is writing a book about his expe
riences — wondering whether a free
press will ever be a reality in modern
Nigeria.
"Are we going to have freedom of
expression?" Ajibade asked. "That
is my anxiety... I have hope, but I'm
skeptical."
