Hey
Stanford
PLAYBOY
is bene & interviewing
Attention female student body! Ever fantasized about being pictured in the number one
men's magazine in the world? Now's your chance to turn fantasy into reality. Repre
sentatives from PLAYBOY magazine are in Stanford to interview and photograph
female students for its Fall 1999 pictorial, "The Women of the Pac Ten." Thousands of
coeds have tried out for PLAYBOY since it began its college conference pictorials 22
years ago. Many have gone on to become PLAYBOY PlaymaUs, models and
actresses. Even more have become doctors, lawyers, scientists, professors, business
and government professionals, wives and moms. Who knows what the future holds for
you? Of course, you could always dig out your issue and relive your glory days.
To be considered for this pictorial and to qualify for an interview, candidates must be at least 18
years of age and registered as a full- or part-time student at a Pac Ten university. Gear copies of
identification-one verifying enrollment in school and one photo ID that shows date of birth—must
be brought to the interview. All photos become property of PLAYBOY and cannot be returned.
INTERESTED STUDENTS SHOULD CALL TO ATTEND THE INTERVIEW SESSIONS.
