A brilliant narrative spanning the Great Depression, FDR's New Deal & the 2nd World War.
Rarely does a work of historical synthesis combine such trenchant analysis and elegant
writing as does Kennedy's spectacular contribution to the Oxford History of United States.
Throughout, fie takes care to detail parts of the American story often neglected by more
casual histories.... Because of its scope, its insight and its purring narrative engine,
Kennedy's book will stand for years to come as the definitive history of the most important
decades of the American century. Publishers Weekly
This is an enormous book, heavy to carry and light and very agreeable to read. David
Kennedy, a professor of History at Stanford, is merciless as
to fact, and detail but very kind to the reader It gave me, I do
not exaggerate, a very pleasant free-time occupation for a
full two weeks. The book, nearly all of it. has my very
strong approval As it will have, I cannot doubt, that of the
many readers it deserves. The Washington Monthly,
