Got a crappy Draw number?
No worries. Live in one of our new theme houses next year!
Â£'hef?itfU ZIMBARDO
Located at Stanford's
elegant Medical Center,
this new "sick theme
house" offers students
lovely doubles, room ser
vice, daily scrubbings and
bedpan services.
Situated conveniently in
the basement of Building
420, Zimbardo is filled
with many double and
triple "cells." Various Res
Ed activities explore the
nature of domination.
Los Stables
Why should the horses get
such nice housing? Here,
you'll get your animal
drive going and always
have the perfect opportuni
ty to roll in the hay.
Colony
This new grad house will
allow students to experi
ence what it would be like
to live in an actual leper
colony. Events include a
bandage-themed dinner
and pass the nose.
Have a great Draw!
