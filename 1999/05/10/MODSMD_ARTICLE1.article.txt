# Cal protesters claim winning resolution
## 
### Meredith Rowe Staff writer 
After fasting for eight clays, protesters at
UC-Berkeley claimed victory this weekend fol
lowing an agreement with administrators that
guaranteed continued support for ethnic stud
ies.
The conclusion of the strike, which included
the arrest of approximately 1(X) protesters — in
cluding five Stanford students — on Tuesday,
came after eight hours of negotiation between
UC-Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl, stu
dents, and faculty. Only hours earlier, a support
rally was held at Stanford.
"Things turned out well," said junior Sarah
Eisenstein, one of the Stanford students arrest-

Ed during the strike. "We're really, really excit
ed about the way the protests turned out. Al
most all of the demands were met. It's a victo
ry-"
The final agreement included a promise by
administrators to retain eight ethnic studies
professorships, with three non-tenured vacan
cies to be replaced immediately and the rest
within the next five years.
Additionally, UC-Berkeley will provide a
budget sufficient to maintain the ethnic studies
department's curricular offerings, a research
center dedicated to race and gender studies,
funds for recruitment of transfer students who
specify an interest in ethnic studies and a multi-
cultural center for students.
"We have been working to make
sure that University support lor this
department is understood by the en
tire campus community." Berdahl
said in a statement. "I am pleased to
say that today this support is clearly
understood hv all."
Most students arrested will re
ceive only a disciplinary letter. How
ever; eight will face further student
conduct proceedings because they
received more than two police cita
tions for unlawful conduct.
"It's unfortunate that a number of
student protesters weren't granted
amnesty," senior Chester Day said.
"Otherwise I'm pretty excited. The
future of ethnic studies looks bright."
As sophomore Jennifer Wekscl
batim said, the result affects Stanford
students as well.
• '.'Anything they do there at
Berkeley has a trickle-down effect
here, either symbolic or concrete,"
she'said.

Supporters acknowledged the rel
evance the UC-Berkeley hunger
strike had at Stanford during the rally
in front of the education building last
Friday.
"I teach classes here at Stanford
that could be construed as ethnic
type studies," said Asst. English Prof.
Paula Moya. "I support the scholar
ship that occurs in ethnic studies pro
grams all over the country. Don't
take ethnic studies classes at Stanford
for granted."
Stanford students focused on the
unity between themselves and stu
dents at I JC-Berkeley that had been
shown throughout the protest.
" Traditionally, when we think of
Berkeley, we think of the Big Game,
but there was a tremendous amount
of solidarity in the jail cell," said
sophomore Mariama White-Ham
mond. another Stanford student ar
rested. "The protest doesn't end with
Berkeley. The struggle is not over.
It's just the beginning of a longer
struggle by people of color to be rec
ognized in this nation."
The struggle is occurring at Stan
lord as well, Dav said.

" This isn't just about Berkeley,"
he said. "I think Stanford should he
very interested in what's happening
there. II the Stanford administration
ever questions its commitment to
ethnic studies in the future, they're
going to see lots of support for the
program all over the Bay Area."
Students who united in support of
UC-Berkeley now have stronger
bonds to battle future problems,
Eisenstein said.
"This is kind of a landmark in
bringing different communities to
gether here at Stanford." she said. "I
think diversity at Stanford is an up
coming issue, especially with tenure.
These aren't just some crazy Berke
ley students. Stanford students really
do care about ethnic studies and a di
verse faculty."
At the rally, senior Jane Kim con
tinued to stress the importance of
ethnic studies at Stanford.
"Ethnic studies can help us under
stand what brings us together, what is
beautiful about our culture, and also
what can divide us," she said. "Ethnic
studies is necessary. I don't think it's
a choice. It's not an elective to take."
