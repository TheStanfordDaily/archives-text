Seeking solutions to violence
LOS ANCiFI.ES (AP) — President Clinton
says today's summit on youth violence is about
finding answers, not assigning blame. But partici
pants from the entertainment industry will be
feeling more pressure than anyone else on the
guest list, particularly since the gun lobby says it
wasn't invited.
The Colorado high school massacre last month
has stirred debate over whether movies, music
and video games have helped shape a culture of
violence among young people. That and relative
ly easy access to guns have often been cited as
possible factors in the Columbine High School
rampage by two student gunmen.
Sen. On in Hatch. R-Utah. plans this week to
propose a federal investigation into whether Hol
lywood is marketing violent products specifically
to youths.
Movie studio lobbyist Jack Valenti, head of the
organization that assigns ratings to films, said his
message at the White House session will be that
moral lessons start at the home, school and
church.
