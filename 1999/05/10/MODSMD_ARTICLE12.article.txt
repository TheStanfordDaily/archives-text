# Middle East officials try to avert PLO conflict
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Palestinian
and Israeli officials held last-minute
meetings yesterday over the closing of
offices at the PLO's headquarters in
Jerusalem, seeking to avert a confronta
tion days before Israeli elections.
Israeli police officials met with a
lawyer for the Orient House headquar
ters past a 7 p.m. deadline set by Israel to
shut down the complex if a compromise
had not been worked out.
American officials were also in touch
with both sides to try and negotiate the
dispute.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu wants to shut down the com
plex, but Public Security Minister Avig
dor Kahalani has proposed a compro
mise that calls for moving two depart
ments out of the compound.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met
earlier with senior officials to discuss the
compromise offer.
The matter was also to be taken up by
Netanyahu's inner Cabinet, which met
late yesterday.
Israel's Cabinet decided earlier this
month to close three offices in the Orient
House, saying they had ties to the Pales
tinian Authority that, under interim
peace agreements, is not allowed to
operate in Jerusalem.
The Palestinians have said the offices,
including the negotiations department
run by the top PLO official in the city,
Faisal Husseini. are not connected to the
Palestinian Authority.
After meeting with Husseini yester
day, Kahalani said the two sides were
trying to find a compromise acceptable

to both sides.
"It will be best for all of us if the
Israeli law is enacted, but on the other
hand, we will do it in such a way that the
peace process can continue," Kahalani
said.
Closing the complex was likely to
spark Israeli-Palestinian violence, which
could affect the outcome of Israel's May
17 elections.
Mahdi Abdel-Hadi, an official close
to Uusseini, said the sticking point
between the sides remained an Israeli
demand that Uusseini not receive
ambassadors and foreign dignitaries at
Orient House.
Israel says such meetings violate
peace agreements.
Palestinians rejected the demand,
arguing that Uusseini is a representative

of the PLO and not Arafat's Palestinian
Authority.
The Palestinian leadership wants to
avoid an outbreak of violence and has
accused Netanyahu, who is trailing in
polls, of manipulating the issue in his
campaign.
"They want to create an atmosphere
of tension so that they can use it in the
elections," chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeh Erekat told The Associated Press.
Netanyahu, who depicts himself as
being more dedicated than other candi
dates to keeping Jerusalem united under
Israeli rule, swore earlier he would move
ahead.
"We will close these offices," he told a
rally. "We will either close them with an
agreement, or we will have to close them
without an agreement."
