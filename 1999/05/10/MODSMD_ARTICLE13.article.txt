ethnic studies protests
apply here at Stanford

WHEN PROTESTERS at
UC-Berkeley were granted
many of their demands this
weekend, they claimed victory. How
ever, their triumph must be tempered
•because of the sheer magnitude of
student effort that it took to save such
;a meaningful Ethnic Studies Depart
ment.
* Under the agreement, the UC
tßerkeley administration promises to
Iretain eight ethnic studies professor
ships and to allocate a budget appro
priate to support the department's
"current curriculum, a research center,
the recruitment of interested transfer
students and a multicultural center for
students.
The ethnic studies program has, in
effect, been granted an assured place
at UC-Berkeley until 2004, at least in
terms of department professorships.
Under the final arrangement, three
non-tenured vacancies will be
replaced immediately and the rest will
be filled within a five-year period.
This should ensure the depart
ments survival in the short term, and
we are optimistic about the future of
ethnic studies at UC-Berkeley.
However, we find it gravely dis
turbing that an eight-day hunger
strike and over 100 arrests were
required to wrest very reasonable
assurances from the university.

Ethnic studies is valuable and has
almost become an essential part of a
modern university. For one of the
country's original and ground-break
ing ethnic studies departments to
experience such difficulty in ensuring
its own survival does not portend well
for other universities.
In the final analysis, the UC-Berke
ley ethnic studies departments sur
vival was the most important conse
quence of this affair.
However, we should not soon for
get exactly how much effort was
expended on the part of students
from UC-Berkeley, Stanford and
other schools to achieve what were
really very reasonable demands.
In addition, we should bear in mind
that even at a place such as UC-
Berkeley, a school famous for its pro
gressive attitude, students can be
faced with losing the gains that their
predecessors have made.
Compared to UC-Berkeley, Stan
ford's ethnic studies legacy is not
nearly so assured. The UC-Berkeley
Department of Ethnic Studies was
jeopardized because non-tenured
vacancies were not being filled and no
tenured positions were being estab
lished.
Especially in light of recent contro
versies over our own tenure-granting
processes, we should be mindful of
the fact that our own programs could
be at risk in the future.
Hopefully, we have learned some
thing in the past week about student
solidarity and action to protect us if
such a threat ever occurs.
