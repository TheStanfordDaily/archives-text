Everyone, at
some point, has the
desire to do some
thing that his or her par
ents consider royally
stupid.
It's usually an experiment
in shaving, tattooing,

piercing or dyeing. Now, I feel about as
apple pie as it gets, and so I look upon my
pierced and dyed peers with a strange blend
of curiosity and envy. Changing your
appearance is a logical and popular way of
severing a childhood identity from the new
one that you can create upon coming to col
lege. It gives you an edge. It seems self
empowering. Taking your appearance com
pletely into your own hands, devil may care.
Perhaps also calculated, though, with our
consciousness of what is and is not "nor
mal." Hut there is the notion that "it,"the
self-aware change, makes "vou" into some
thing a little different.
I consider a friend from Indiana who
was totally straight-edge but had a whop
ping tongue bar which he would reveal at
times when it was very inconvenient to gig
gle. Scared the hell out of me when I first
saw it. Piercings hurt, so why? Because it's
something different, a tiny rebellion, some
thing akin to turning vegetarian in a beef
ridden society. And it was also imperma
nent — tattoos aren't, and they say your
hair never really looks the same after trving
Manic Panic. The desire for rebellion was
held in check bv some notion of what
appearances needed to be maintained.
I have come to the conclusion that, if I
were to change my appearance in a trite
sort of "alternative" way. no one would
take me seriously. You have to cover up
tattoos, disguise piercings, try to wear a hat

over your blueberry hair. Unabashed dis
play is like coloring outside of the lines with
your personality in society's coloring book.
This wouldn't pose a problem il I didn't
want so badly to get my eyebrow pierced.
I've been told it would look cool, would
accentuate my eyes (and eyebrow, I'd
hope), would be a little kooky. I've been
told that it's just a little pinch. I have an
offer from my Indiana friend to take me to
a reasonable, clean and well-lit piercing
parlor and hold my hand.
But I cannot imagine approaching, as a
history major, any number of the profes
sors we all think are a little more conserva
tive-minded with a pretty little ring perched
above my eye. I guess I think that everyone
would notice it and not notice anything else
about me. I imagine the following:
"What about Mari?"
"Ah, yes. Came back from the summer
with that eyebrow ring, didn't she?"
or j
"Hmm. Indeed. No eoterm for her."
And so my hopes to be taken seriously
as student and person would be blindsided
by some whim I had over the summer,
dashed to the ground because of a little
ornament. Admittedly neurotic, and with a
lack of confidence in academic capability.
That some little ring would change how I
am perceived is ludicrous, right? But it's
evident to me from those I know who've
already bitten the bullet that this isn't an
unreasonable fear. They remember people
whose eyes fixed upon a ring or tattoo dur
ing a conversation and never wavered.
Imagine talking to someone who is only
talking to your nose, and you've got it.
Upon piercing your nose or shaving your
head, you have an assigned place in the
human mental dictionary of types of peo
ple.

So. why do we persistently need to cate
gorize according to some little expression
of creativity or, in other cases, trendyiess?
Because we're a totally superficial soci
ety!?! Ves! Because we exist in an environ
ment where the generation gap between
ourselves and our professors is something
we bank on and take advantage of every
time we ask them for advice? Absojirtclv!
Because we think they've neverlbeen
there? Perhaps. Because we believu'that
social norms are more powerful thau ;»nv
individual's merits on paper?
Because we're afraid that people arc*.doing
it to us. and we want to subtly beat them to
the punch? I hum.
It is easier to place people into cate
gories. We can reckon with the differences
they present from our own self-designa
tions and move on. Facial piercing equals
modern thought and literature or studio
art, maybe the occasional postmodern
English major. Dreadlocks and hemp jew
elry equals HBF resident or any other co
op. Bike helmet equals grad student. Hos
pital volunteer equals ambitious pre-med.
Categorization lets us off the hook from
recognizing our own contradictions, the
ways that we don't quite fit in to both social
norms and our own equally restrictive self
imposed definitions. We may not voluntar
ily plunge into relationships with absurd
preconceptions, but we also may not be
doing much to the contrary, even when it
chips away at our own strength as individu
als. You may not be able to assault superfi
ciality by being intentionally different, but
recognizing the impulse to pigeonhole
automatically is the lirst step away from it.
