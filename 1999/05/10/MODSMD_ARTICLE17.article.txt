ask force needs clarity
It is clear that there is a serious Univer
sity-wide problem due to the lack of
• Affordable housing for junior faculty.
• However, the stated objective of creat
ing affordable housing through the pro
posed "infill" project is incongruent with
the (act that few junior faculty could be
expected to afford the proposed $6(K),(KK)
rso $7(H),(K)() cost of the least expensive
''ynits.
V Eligible faculty with these resources will
be able to choose from the many
campus condominiums and homes expect
• 4td to become available when current resi
dents move into the new Sand Hill Senior
Rousing Project. Financing programs,
rehousing subsidies and lower-cost condo
minium complexes such as that proposed
'<for the Stable Site could actually meet the
real housing needs of junior faculty.
Why has the administration been con
centrating its energies on "infill" instead of
\rhese other projects? The answer given by
officials in neighborhood
• is that it is less expensive to build

in the old part of campus due to already
existing infrastructure, however no answer
was forthcoming to the question of approx
imately how much profit can he anticipat
ed.
Surely projected building costs and
amount of profit to be realized from the
sale of housing units has been carefully
considered. This important part of the
"infill" equation has not received the
attention it deserves. The recent San Juan
Hill lot auction was extremely successful
from the perspective that it generated $2.2
million in profit.
What is the policy of the current admin
istration in building out green spaces in
established neighborhoods in regard to
generating income? To what extent is
income generation a proper use of our
neighborhoods? Is it necessary or desir
able? These are important questions that
the Housing Task Force needs to address
and to which the homeowners deserve
answers.

Responsibility on the Row
It's that season again, when Draw num
bers have been released and hordes of
potential Row residents flood houses to
scout and rank their choices.
However, as I get ready to enter my
third year as a Cowell Cluster resident and
my second as a ZAP manager, I would like
to take a moment to express the fact that a
lot of people have absolutely no idea what
it is going to be like to live in a Row
house—they're just tempted there by the
rumors of luxury.
They have no idea what it means to
have to hash or that if they get last pick in
the in-house draw, they may end up living
in a room that was probably a linen closet
in the original house.
Early this year I attended a meeting
about evaluating Row houses, and some
sophomore resident of 557 was complain
ing about his room and the fact that he was
actually expected to have to clean.
These are the residents that make our
lives, as managers, a nightmare.
We love our houses and the indepen

dent style of living they provide and funda
mentally are opposed to the idea of people
following us around cleaning up our mess
es.
Row houses are not for everyone.'They
are not for the squeamish or the socially
challenged.
There's always so much talk about num
bers low enough for getting a "good
house" in the Draw, but people don't real
ly stop to think about the concept of a
"good resident" for a Row house.
So please, as you all go out and choose
places to live for next year, make sure you
take the time to evaluate whether or not
you will have the time and the motivation
to be a good resident.
Understand that you will be expected to
contribute labor and time to the mainte
nance and community of the house.
If this isn't for you, at the very least, stay
out of Cowell Cluster.
