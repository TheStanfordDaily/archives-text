# Where we are
## They come to bury others, not to praise them

MR. LARRY MARINEAU was
my l()th-grade English teacher.
He had short, curly hair and an
even shorter temper. He once pulled anoth
er driver out of his car for cutting him off.
He also liked poetry.
His appreciation for literature was so
intense that he instilled in me a similar pas
sion that would eventually shape the course
ol my studies. For that reason, two years
after 1 had finished his class and two days
before I was to graduate high school. 1 went
to his classroom to thank him.
Mr. Marineau had already left for the
day.
I am not reminded of this now as some
form of admonition, a reminder to seek out
those who contributed to my education
before I graduate college in a matter of
weeJcs. This incident does come back to me
at this time because, in an opportunity to
edit at The Daily last week, I witnessed
once again our collective inability to pay
someone a compliment in public.
On so-called "Old Staffers' Night," 1
resumed my position as Opinions Editor,

the gatekeeper of the letters that are sent to
this newspaper. The collection of letters
that night was no different than the hun
dreds 1 had reviewed two years earlier
when I held the job: critiques of University
programs, sarcastic jabs at someone else's
obviously misguided letter, attacks on a
particular ethnic group that had performed
some atrocity centuries back. II someone
had committed any kind of journalistic boo
boo, there was always someone else eager
to make certain that that fault did not go
unnoticed.
Absent among these diatribes, though,
were any declarations of praise, any in
passing pats on the back. For all the good
work that is done on this campus, it's rare
that anyone writes, "Good job."
Of course the people at Stanford are not
monsters, hurling curses back and forth.
After all, the people are what we pride our
selves on — the scores of over-achievers
who always have time for the sympathetic
smile, the congratulatory hug. Indeed, with
in the comfort of the residences, over the
communal hearth of the dining table, stu

dents commend one another lor their ath
letic and artistic achievements; they mail
each other cards, even though they live
next door; they keep each other's overly
critical minds in check by reminding them,
of their qualities as well as their limitations.
Despite a compliment's calming effect,
our critical minds are still able to perform
their tasks of dissection. For isn't that the
job of a liberal education — to train one to
lay bare all aspects of a problem, like a
coroner performing an autopsy? Like good
academics, we seek to expose, to illumi
nate. to usher truth forth from its shadowy
recesses.
But why is it so difficult to describe the
positive elements and so easy to describe
the negative? Why, when given the choice
to write anything, those who write letters to
The Daily 99 times out of 100 will choose
the pessimistic tone of the skeptic? li seems
to me that in the public sphere — whether
that be the forum of a newspaper or even
the interactions between a teen-ager and
his teacher — compliments are proof that
our critical minds are somehow unfit, that

being nice is equated with being easy.
Among friends, praise is allowed because
intimacy exists. Even in some socially sanc
tioned situations — the administration of
an award, for example — the guard can be
let down. But, in the unfamiliar world of
public discourse, one cannot risk vulnera
bility, for that might signal a weakness in
one's critical powers. And of course, com
plete ruination must follow from that.
During my tenure as opinions editor.
University President Gerhard Casper was
getting blasted for not paying enough atten
tion to this community, too much to that
one — basically for being a responsible
person who only has 24 hours in his day. I,
along with the board of editors, decided to
write an editorial detailing the difficulty of
Casper's job and the numerable successes
lie had had. The reaction: The Daily was
kissing up. The Daily was being soft. Were
we lying in our editorial? No, the president
was doing on the whole an admirable job.
Did we have anything to gain from our
endorsement? No, Casper has no tangible
effect t)ii Hie Daily's operations (he has

lunch once a year with our staff). Our only
fault was that we were being complimenta
ry-
I am not in favor, like Rodney King, !of
everyone getting along. In the very writing
of a column in the Opinions section,; I
understand the necessity of disagreement.
And when this disagreement reaches a sat
isfactory pitch, people speak up.
But sometimes 1 wonder, is there any
agreement on this campus? Do people
admire someone they have read about or
perhaps respect some program they have
just discovered? If so — and I suspect this is
the case — then it's not too hard to say
something positive about this shared
understanding. It takes just as much time
and effort to praise as it does to criticize.
And the consequences are often much
more positive, too.

David Stein, a coterminal student in English,
will begin the campaign for decency by say
ing how lucky he is to have given priority to
those seven amazing girls from Donner.
