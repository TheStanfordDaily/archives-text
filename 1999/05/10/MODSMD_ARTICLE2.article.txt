# Dekes keep house
## Wais, Camarillo make decision after week-long deliberation 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Delta Kappa Epsilon will remain housed
for the upcoming year, Dean of Students
Marc Wais announced after meeting with
fraternity officers Friday morning.
Wais's announcement came after a week
of considering "new information" presented
by Deke officers during an April 29 meeting
with Wais and Director of Residential Edu
cation Jane Camarillo.
"When we met with the fraternity on
I April 29], our official intent was to remove
them," Wais said. "They responded and

gave us more information that gave us more
clarity. The new information indicated and
suggested to us that we ought to take a sec
ond look."
Wais said the reason for the week-long
delay was to "make a decision based on ac
curate, complete and timely information."
"We delayed our decision to ensure that
we were giving the situation a close look," he
said.
Camarillo said there was a "shift in num
bers" on the fraternity's roster that caused
her and Wais to reconsider their initial as
sessment that the Dekes could lose their
house.

"At one point in time, we were con
cerned about their ability to meet require
ments and to successfully occupy and man
age the house," Wais said. "The latest infor
mation allays that concern."
Camarillo said the initial roster of Deke
members and pledges that was presented to
her office raised questions about the Dekes'
"numbers and membership." According to
Greek housing criteria, every housed frater
nity and sorority "must have sufficient mem
bership at the conclusion of Spring Rush to
fill the house to 1(X) percent of its rated oc-

cupancy tor the following year."
"Numbers are often an indication
of the strength and health of an orga
nization," Camarillo said. "How suc
cessful were you in recruiting a new
sophomore class? That was what was
troubling in the first roster that was
submitted by the chapter, so we want
ed to examine it really closely, and we
were happy to find a little bit more
strength in the numbers and mem
bership."
Senior Robb Moore, president of
the Dekes, said there were some
questions about member eligibility
which resulted in "a misunderstand
ing between the University and
DKE."
"We have the numbers," Moore
said. "There were questions about
the eligibility of some of the mem
bers."
According to Moore, the Dekes
needed to fill 33 spaces this year to
meet the 1(X) percent rule. "We will
have 33 members by this Friday,"
Moore said. "We had 39 members on
the roster that we presented to Wais
[on May 7], some of whom were dis
counted by [Waisj due to eligibility.
Right now we're redoing some pa
perwork so that we will have that
number. Those people were dis
counted due to filling out the paper
work incorrectly, which made them
ineligible."
The Dekes' retention of their
house is contingent on certain "con
ditions" that Camarillo and Wais
have stipulated in a letter as necessary
for the Dekes to fulfill. In a press re
lease, Camarillo and Wais said that,
"violation of certain conditions could
result in the fraternity losing its house
as early as later this quarter."
Wais and Mtxire declined com
ment on the specific nature of the
conditions, although Wais did em
phasize the conditions reflected those
in the (ireek housing criteria.

"I am very confident of our ability
to meet those conditions and keep
the house," Moore said.
Camarillo said she and Wais ex
amine occupancy trends to deter
mine whether any sorority or frater
nity can adequately fill its house.
"It could be that in the final out
come, (despite] very strong leader
ship, membership, very strong com
mitment to residential education in
the house, being consistently at XO
percent membership would be a
problem," Camarillo said. "After one
year, we would tell them, 'this is how
you work on membership for your
house.' After two years, that's be
coming more of a problem. We have
to be able to say that the chapter is
strong enough to attract members to
fill the house."
According to Moore, all of Deke's
32 slots necessary to retain their
house last year were filled. Wais said
this is a factor that contributes to the

difference between the Dekes' reten
tion of its house and the Taxis' losing
their house in spring of 1998.
"The Taxis had a three-year trend
(of insufficient pledge numbers),"
Waissaid.
According to Moore and Wais,
some former members of Delta Tau
Delta pledged the Dekes this year.
"Part of the information that we
were considering was the information
we read in The Daily about Delta Tau
Delta members," Camarillo said.
"That raised some questions, and it
was the kind of new information that
takes time to look at."
Wais said there were no institu
tional, written policies prohibiting
Delta Tau Delta members from
pledging the Dekes to help them re
tain their housing, if that was indeed
the Delts' intent.
"There's nothing in the Universi
ty's publications prohibiting that," he
said. "Does it have the potential to

adversely affect other groups? Yes, it
definitely has the potential. But we
are not viewing this house as a mixed
house. It is a Deke house."
Moore emphasized that the de-ac
tivated Delt members who pledged
Deke did so for personal reasons not
related to preserving the Deke house.
"A lot of Delt members were un
satisfied with their fraternal system,
and they were actively seeking a place
where they could find what they were
looking for," Moore said. "That's
why they came to us."
Moore said he was pleased admin
istrators took time to re-consider
their initial decision. "I'm relieved, to
say the least, that we're keeping the
house," he said.
Moore said he did not anticipate a
similar problem occurring in the fu
ture. "We are a strong fraternity and
will be strong next year," he said. "In
dealing with the administration, I've
found that they can be fair."
