■ Friday: No. 6 Stanford (36-12) 4, Si. Mary's (20-28)3

XBut for one game, teams like Nevada, Pacific, San
Francisco and Santa Clara can certainly put up a fight.
Sixth-ranked Stanford (36-12) found that out once
(npre Friday evening at Sunken Diamond as it pulled
out a 4-3 win in a tight nonconference game with St.
Mary's (20-28).
•[•Junior Craig Thompson led off the bottom of the
njrith inning with a solo home run to take the game for
Cardinal and to give sophomore Jason Young his
ejgjith win on the season.
X Though Stanford has won the first three of its five
straight nonconference games to extend its winning
streak to nine, the Cardinal is not coasting by any
means. It needed 10 innings to come back and beat
Nevada 16-14 Tuesday afternoon in Reno and only
squeezed out a 2-1 victory over Pacific Wednesday.
While the team has not been blowing away the op-
position lately, it has been displaying
a knack for winning close games — a
skill that will certainly be needed
come postseason.
On its hoped-for march to the
College World Series, Stanford will
also need its No. I pitcher to be in top
form.
Encouraging for the Cardinal,
Young, who struggled in back-to
back starts against US(' and C alifor
nia in April, seems to have regained
his dominating stature on the mound
in his last two appearances.
Friday he gave up two runs in the
first inning on a collection of bloop
hits but then settled down to go the
distance and record his seventh com
plete game of the season. Except for
the first and the eighth, in which he
also gave up a run. Young only faced
three batters each inning.
"I felt meat all night," he said.

"My curvehall wasn't really there so
I had to make do with what I had. My
location and control really helped
out."
By striking out seven Gaels, the
right-hander increased his season
strikeout total to 136 to move into a
tie with Jeff Austin, the 1998 Nation
al Pitcher of the Year, for fourth
place on Stanford's all-time list.
Young's solid effort was key he
cause the offense was not particular
ly impressive. The Cardinal did
record 13 hits hut had trouble driving
runners in, leaving nine on hase.
When Stanford really needed a
run. though, it produced.
Thompson, who has been in and
out of the lineup all year, probably
got his most important hit of the year
with his game-winning blast in the
ninth. The junior designated hitter
took senior Tim Podesta's 1-0 pitch
deep over the right-center field wall
to end the game before it could enter
extra innings.
"Since it was a 1-0 count, I was

looking fastball — just looking for a
good pitch to hit," he said. "I just
wanted to get a good swing at it."
Thompson began the season bat
ting leadoff and playing left field.
After struggling, however, he was re
placed by junior Nick Day, who has
kept his spot in the lineup by hitting
.319 with four home runs and 30
RBIs.
In the last few weeks, Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess has
found more ways to juggle the out
field around. Junior Edmund Mutli
and sophomore Billy Jacobson have
been splitting time in center field and
Day and Thompson have taken turns
playing the field and DH.
"It's made it real competitive,"
Thompson said. "We just have to go
out and play hard every day. But I've
been playing about every other game
so my timing hasn't been hurt."
Marquess is also enthusiastic
about how well the platoon effort lias
fared.
"Not everybody's hot at the same

time — it can change game to game,"
he said. "Mv job is to decide who's
hot and who's not. It's worked real
well recently."
While Marquess was able to em
ploy multiple pitchers against both
Nevada and Pacific. Young's strong
performance Friday precluded the
use of senior Tony Cogan or any
other reliever.
In an attempt to replicate a nor
mal conference outing. Marquess
was going to allow Young to throw
between 1 lOand 115 pitches. Inadis
play of control and efficiency, Young
threw only 103 in nine innings. He
also walked no St. Mary's batters.
The next two games, tonight
against San Francisco and tomorrow
versus Santa C'lara, should allow
more Cardinal hurlers to take the
mound. Marquess anticipates using
sophomore Justin Wayne and fresh
man Brian Sager, both normal week
end starters, in tandem tonight and
starting freshman Mike Wodnicki
Tuesday.
