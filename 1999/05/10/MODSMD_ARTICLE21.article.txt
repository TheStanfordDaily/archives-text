Sunday afternoon's National Women's Water Polo
Championship finals rivaled any other championship
water polo game in duration, intensity, unbelievable plays
and incredible excitement.

■ Saturday: Stanford 6. No. 3 Califonia (28-6) 5.
■ Yesterday: No. 1 USC (30-2) 7. Stanford 6.

But it was the laces of the Stanford team that demon
strated incredible love and respect for the sport. Each
player pushed herself to the absolute limit and then man
aged to sustain and fight even more. Huddled together be
fore the beginning of all nine periods, the players listened
to head coach John Tanner direct plays with giant smiles
on their faces. The players then turned to each other and
with a hint of laughter in their voices yelled words of en
couragement.
It was the game of their lives and they were loving every
moment of it.
The No. 2 Stanford women's water polo team returned
from UC-Davis last night as National Champion runners
up. The team made it past three rounds of play, beating
No. 15 Michigan. No. 7 UC-Davis. and No. 3 California in
the semifinals to qualify for the championship match.
After four periods of regulation play, the Cardinal (25-
6) took No. 1 USC (30-2) into double overtime, trying to

claim a victory. With all bleachers filled and pool deck
space cramped to full capacity, fans screamed and held
their breath in vain, but two overtime periods would not
decide a winner. Stanford went on to fight in three sudden
death periods before finally losing 7-6.
Yet no matter the final standings or final score, this was
not an ultimate loss for the Cardinal team.
"To be successful in sports, it's about dealing with ad
versity," Tanner said. "1 think resiliency is what this team
has been about all year. Whether we scored the last goal or
[USC] did, we're still a championship team."
In the first minute of the match, sophomore hole-set
Kelly Shouev drew a four-meter penalty shot. Sophomore
Anne-Marie Keenan took the shot and scored, giving
Stanford an early lead.
Two Stanford kickouts gave I JSC two opportunities to
tic the game. USC converted on the second 6-on-5 play
and brought the score to 1-1 before the end of the first
quarter.
Shouev scored the next of Stanford's goals with an
amazing skip shot that flew into the high left corner of the
cage. USC managed another goal with under two minutes
left in the quarter. At half, the teams were tied 2-2.
Early in the third, the Trojans scored a four-meter shot
to take the lead. Stanford did not stay behind for long.
Keenan scored her second goal with a lob into the high left
corner of the cage. Stanford then took the lead less than
two minutes later with a hard shot from sophomore Hilary
Oalloglv.
Senior goalie and co-captain Heather Crary had her
seventh and eighth saves on the next two Trojan posses
sions. hut with 12 seconds left in the quarter, USC tied the
game 4-4.
A close fourth-quarter sprint left a Stanford and USC
player tangled. The referee ejected junior Elissa Keszler

and IJSC scored on its 6-on-5 play. The teams traded pos
sessions for the next six minutes until Stanford had just
under 30 seconds to score and send the game into over
time.
Senior co-captain Lindsay Tam drew an ejection on the
counterattack and Tanner immediately called a timeout to
discuss Stanford's scoring options. Just when it seemed
Stanford didn't have enough time left on the clock, Gallo
glv fired a high corner shot from the perimeter and
brought the score to 5-5. A tight press kept the Trojans
from scoring in the last nine seconds of the quarter and the
game went into overtime.
USC scored with 32 seconds left in the first three
minute overtime, and Stanford went into the sixth period
of play behind 6-5. This was the first period of play that ei
ther team had an advantage, yet the Stanford players'
smiles had not diminished at all. The team looked more ex
cited and energized as ever.
Neither team scored in the first few possessions, and
when Gallogly stole the ball from the Trojan hole-set and
passed the ball back to Crary, this team captain took mat
ters into her own hands.
Crary decided she would fire a shot of her own the en
tire length of the pool and score a goal. Her first and only
goal this season came at the most important time of her
collegiate career. Goalies rarely score in games, though
Crary scored on Hawaii's goalie in the consolation finals of
the 1998 National Championship. The shot brought the
crowd to its feet and elevated the Stanford team's deter
mination tenfold.
Stanford held USC for the last minute of overtime and
the game went into sudden death. The teams fought for
two three-minute periods of sudden death, and neither
could manage a shot to end the game.
Halfway through the ninth period of
play, USC scored a skip shot that
brought the season to a dramatic
close.
Crary had 11 saves and earned a
spot on the second all-tournament

team along with sophomore Kris
koblik. Freshman Margie Din
geldein and Shouey were first-team
all-tournament selections.
The bat tie fir the 1999 title was ar
guably the best game of college
women's water polo witnessed. Both
teams demonstrated incredible tal
ent and heart. It is hard to say that ei
ther team lost. The proof is in the nine
periods it took to decide a winner.
