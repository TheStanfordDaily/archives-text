Jt is a good sign for the Stanford
women's golf team that only qualify
ing for the NCAA tournament was a
disappointing end to this weekend's
West Regional Tournament in
Houston.
It was made disappointing by the
fact that the Cardinal had the oppor
tunity to do much more than a fifth
place finish against one of the sea
son's toughest collegiate fields.

WOMEN'S GOLF
â–  Friday-Sunday: Stanford finished
fifth in the West Regional Tourna
ment.

Stanford got out to a fast start, re
ceiving strong play from every spot in
the lineup to post a four-over-par
292, good for a seven-stroke lead
over two-time defending NC AA
champion Arizona State (No. 6) and
USC (No 5).
Junior Julie Dunn led the Cardi
nal with an even-par 72 on the 6,119-
yard layout. Sophomore Ail-Ameri
can Hilary Hoineyer and senior
Michelle Sperry both finished at 73
and fellow All-American Stephanie

Keever shot a 74.
On the second day.the Cardinal
posted a plus-11 299 and saw its
seven-stroke lead evaporate into a
three-shot deficit behind Arizona,
the defending West Regional cham
pion. ranked second in the nation.
Dunn continued to pace the Stan
ford scoring, carding a two-under-par
70 to remain in second place, five
strokes behind individual leader
Jenna Daniels of Arizona. Sperry
fired a 75 in the second round, ending
the day in a tie for 10th place in the in
dividual standings.
The sophomore duo of Homeyer
and Keever struggled the second day,
shooting 7b and 7S, respectively.
Despite the drop from the top
spot, coach Caroline O'Connor re
mained upbeat about the team's play
heading into the final round of play.
"We didn't play badly," coach
O'Connor said after the second
round. "We just didn't hit a lot of
putts. When you play a course that
has water on 15 of 18 holes, you can't
let your guard down mentally."
"We didn't want a couple of the
higher numbers we had out there
today, but we didn't play badly."
