women's golf team that only qualify

disappointing end to this weekend's

tunity to do much more than a fifth
place finish against one of the sea
son's toughest collegiate fields.

WOMEN'S GOLF
■ Friday-Sunday: Stanford finished
fifth in the West Regional Tourna
ment.

Stanford got out to a fast start, re
ceiving strong play from every spot in
the lineup to post a four-over-par
292, good for a seven-stroke lead
over two-time defending NC AA
champion Arizona State (No. 6) and
USC (No 5).
Junior Julie Dunn led the Cardi
nal with an even-par 72 on the 6,119-
yard layout. Sophomore Ail-Ameri
can Hilary Hoineyer and senior
Michelle Sperry both finished at 73
and fellow All-American Stephanie

Keever shot a 74.
On the second day.the Cardinal
posted a plus-11 299 and saw its
seven-stroke lead evaporate into a
three-shot deficit behind Arizona,
the defending West Regional cham
pion. ranked second in the nation.
Dunn continued to pace the Stan
ford scoring, carding a two-under-par
70 to remain in second place, five
strokes behind individual leader
Jenna Daniels of Arizona. Sperry
fired a 75 in the second round, ending
the day in a tie for 10th place in the in
dividual standings.
The sophomore duo of Homeyer
and Keever struggled the second day,
shooting 7b and 7S, respectively.
Despite the drop from the top
spot, coach Caroline O'Connor re
mained upbeat about the team's play
heading into the final round of play.
"We didn't play badly," coach
O'Connor said after the second
round. "We just didn't hit a lot of
putts. When you play a course that
has water on 15 of 18 holes, you can't
let your guard down mentally."
"We didn't want a couple of the
higher numbers we had out there
today, but we didn't play badly."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
the final round was not one to re
member. In an effort that included 2K
bogies and nine scores of double
bogey or worse — offset by only three
birdies. Stanford posted a 318, the
team's highest one-day score of the
season.
The final-round score dropped
the Cardinal three spots into fifth
place.

round of 2X6 in the final round to

ian University finished third and
fourth, respectively, joining the Car
