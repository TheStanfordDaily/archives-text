MEN'S GOLF

â–  Friday-Sunday: Stanford finished
third in U.S. Intercollegiate Tourna
ment.

The event, played here at the
Stanford Golf Course, was a prime
opportunity for the Cardinal to
tune up heading into the NCAA
West Regional.
Stanford, looking to capture its
second tournament title of the sea
son. was just two shots out of first
place going into the final round, but
fired a 10-over-par score of 294 on
the last day to drop back into third
place.
The Cardinal finished the event
at 863, 11 shots behind tournament
champion Brigham Young, ranked
lytji in the country. Oregon,
ranked 20th nationally, posted a

third-round 283 to edge the Cardi
nal and finish in second place at
862.
Rounding out the top live were
California and Pepperdine at 866
and 870, respectively.
It was an equally frustrating
weekend for senior Joel Kribel.
Kribel carded a three-day total ol
206 to finish play in a tie for first
place with Michael Beard of Pep
perdine. Beard, however, captured
the tournament title on the first
playoff hole.
Andy Miller, son of former tour
pro Johnny Miller, was joined by
Ben Crane of Oregon and Justin
Peters of Nevada in the top five.
Despite the disappointing finish,
the Cardinal outing did offer a
glimpse of what could be strong
play in the future.
Sophomore Alex Aragon and
freshman Ned Yetten, both playing
as individuals, finished in the top 10
at sixth and ninth, respectively.
Yetten's total,was punctuated by a
pair of three-under-par 69s in the
first and third rounds.
Also scoring well for the Cardi
nal was senior Dusty Brett, who
carded a three-day total of 215 to
end up in a tie for 12th.
Rounding out the team scores
lor the Cardinal were James Lee at

219, good for a lie at 26th. Eric
Dahlberg at 226 and David Searle
at 225.
Joining Aragon and Yetten as
individual competitors, sophomore
Rudy Barreto carded a 223 to finish
in a tie for 39th.
Stanford looks to recapture its
top form at the West Regional May
