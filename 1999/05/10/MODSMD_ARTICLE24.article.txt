# Lax takes WWLL championship
## 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
As the final whistle blew, seniors
Carey Jones and Alexis Patrizio em
braced in a hug that epitomized not
only a superb season that ended in a
Western Women's Lacrosse
League championship, but also a ca
reer's worth of lacrosse at Stanford.
It could not have been a better end
ing for the Cardinal's three seniors.
The scoreboard read 11-7 in
favor of Stanford (19-4, 10-1
WWLL), which captured its second
consecutive championship against
UC-Davis yesterday.
The essence of the moment was
captured best as the song "Sweet
Emotion" rang out from the loud
speaker, echoing the smiles and
hugs from the champions. After se
niors Jones. Patrizio and Stephanie
Tuerk accepted the trophy for the
Cardinal, buckets of water were
dumped on various players and the
cake fight began — there was no
mistake that now it was time to cele
brate. They certainly deserved it.
After a 23-4 blowout over UCLA
on Saturday, Stanford advanced to
the finals to face UC-Davis. Al
though the Cardinal had already

beaten Davis twice this season, it
wasn't making any assumptions
about the final matchup. Without
having faced a true challenge in the
last few games, there was no way of
knowing how the team would react
to a higher level of play.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE

■ Sunday: Stanford 11, UC-Davis 7

■ Saturday: Stanford (19-4, 12-1
Women's Western Lacrosse
League) 23, UCLA 4.

"Davis is always strong, especial
ly toward tournament time," said
sophomore Katharine Barnes.
"They improved and picked up
their intensity over the season and
they came out strong."
Luckily Stanford had an answer
for Davis.
"Davis' determination took us
hv surprise, so we had to adjust,"
Tuerk said. "In the end, our stick
skills and our playing as a team
showed that we were the better
team."
The women were able to use
their winning momentum from Sat
urday's game to propel them into
the finals, where Davis kept them on

their toes.
"On Saturday the women
showed moments of greatness. It
was fluid, exceptional lacrosse," said
Stanford head coach Heidi Connor.
"Today we played incredibly, but at
moments Davis had control. We
had to stay sharp the entire 60 min
utes."
"It was important that we kept
our focus for the whole time. Even
when they got within two goals of us.
instead of letting ourselves get rat
tled, we were able to keep focus,"
said junior Hedy Born, referring to
Davis' three quick goals at the be
ginning of the second half bringing
the score to 7-5.
In last year's WWLL champi
onship game between Stanford and
Davis, the Cardinal rallied from a 6-
2 halftime deficit to win. So this year
when the roles were reversed and
Stanford held Davis at halftime 6-2,
the women knew the game wasn't
over.
"We knew that they could come
back and it made us realize that we
had to pick it up a notch," Patrizio
said.
"We stepped up our intensity to
play at a high level," Barnes said.
"The team came together and

played as well as we could."
Connor agreed that the champi
onship was a team effort but also
highlighted the play of Barnes and
junior Christina Gilyutin.
"As always, Katharine Barnas
gave 110 percent," she said. "She was
able to rally the team to a victory by
not only her play, but also her leader
ship and words on the field. Christiivi
Gilyutin hasan amazing way of keep
ing the defense together, she's n{y
communicator on the field."
Leading the Cardinal in scoring
was Barnes with three goals, Pa
tri/.io and Born with two and Jones,
I
sophomore Kate Reilly and Iresh
men Sara Lev and Jenny Silverman
each chipped in one. *
The victory marked not only ail
end to a spectacular season, but alsji
hope for national recognition in tlfe
future. J
"This is what we were workirfg
for, to prove that we can dominate
on the West Coast," Barnes saiel.
•
"We are hoping to get an indepen
dent schedule. By winning this twi>
years in a row. we are showing that
we are the strongest team out here?'
Born agreed. \
