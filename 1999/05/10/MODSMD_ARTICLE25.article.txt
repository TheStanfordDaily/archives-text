# Johnson to address frosh
## "Middle Passage" author inaugurates Freshman Books 
### Fei Wu Contributing writer 
Every freshman shares one common storyâ€”and
will finally meet the author of that story tonight.
As part of the Freshman Book program, Charles
Johnson, author of "Middle Passage," will speak at 7
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
Part of the Introduction to the Humanities curricu
lum, the program gave every freshman a free copy of
the work during fall quarter.
"It's not an original idea. Some other universities
have similar programs too. It would be a way to give
freshmen something that would be a common experi
ence," said Assoc. Drama Prof. Harry Elam, director
of the Area One Program.
Winner of the 1990 National Book Award, "Middle
Passage" examines the literal and philosophical jour
ney of a free black man who stows away on a slave ship
bound for Africa in the early 19th century.
"It was pretty interesting. Ordinarily I would not
read about life on a ship because it seems boring. But
it seemed like a pretty visual book and really easy to
understand," said freshman Cursha Pierce, who read
the book during her winter break.
"I like how it incorporated the life of that time and
the new culture [thatj the Africans acquired on the
ship," she added.
Others, however, believe the program has not sig
nificantly affected students. Freshman Gina Fujikami
said, "It's a great idea to meet the author of a book that
you've read, but [most of my friends and 1] just had no
motivation or time to read it."
The Freshman Book is selected by the Area One
Governance Board, which includes staff, faculty and
students.
Johnson, a Mac Arthur Fellow, holds the Pollock
Chair of English at the University of Washington. He
has written four novels, including his latest work
"Dreamer," which reimagines the final two years of
Dr. Martin Luther King's life.
He will also speak about "Living Through the

Changes: The Literature of Transition" when he visits
students today in an Introduction to the Humanities
course taught by English Prof. Diane Middlebrook.
"We are hoping that [the freshman class] will be ex
cited independently about the humanistic experience
without being motivated by quizzes and papers for
grades," said Cheri Ross, assistant director of Area
One Program.
"We hope that [the Freshman Book event] is some
thing that students like and cherish and look back on,"
added Elam.
The Freshman Book for next year will be Tom
Stoppard's "Arcadia," a modern play that examines
life through literature, history, Newtonian physics and
mathematics. Stoppard will speak to the incoming
freshman class in winter quarter.
Stoppard's other credits include the renowned play
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" and the
1999 Academy Award-winning screenplay for the film
"Shakespeare in Love."
