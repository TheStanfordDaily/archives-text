## Money makes the Farm go round My Campus work experience 
### Chiara Smutina 
Last quarter my daddy told me I had to
be!financially independent, and he cut my
annual clothing allowance to $5,000. I
decided to get an on-campus job to make
upi the difference.
First I hashed in my dining hall. I was
bright and cheerful and asked every stu
dent "would you like fries with that?" But
we didn't have any fries. The students start
ed a riot, and my supervisor took me into
th£back room and beat me with stale bread
sticks.
I lied on my application and got a job as
a consultant at the Tresidder Lalß. I found
the secret turntable and drink dispensers
underneath the consultant desk. I coerced
cute programmers into playing truth or
dare with me in the networking closet. I got
fired after hosting '80s karaoke night on
the consultant microphone.
Next I worked at the loan check desk at
Meyer Library. I got lost in the stacks while
I was reshelving and missed yodeling for
the 11:40 announcement. I hooked up a
video surveillance system to the 24-hour
study room, now I have tapes of what real

ly goes on there at 3 a.m. The night before
the Hum Bio midterm, I realized the tests
on reserve actually contained top-secret
information that could crack the
post-office / Draw / loan-check line con
spiracy. I refused to check out any reserve
material, and the pre-med students were
not happy.
Then I life guarded at Lake Lag, a happi
er, sunnier place than the library. Once a fat
naked girl fell off a raft and started drown
ing. I refused to go in that parasite-infested
murky water. She paddled to shore and
filed a complaint.
I wrote for The Stanford Daily for a brief
stint. They wanted me to do an in-depth
analysis of uninteresting bylaws in the
ASSU Constitution. I turned the story into
an investigative, hands-on report of
whether Vice Provost James Montoya wears
boxers or briefs. My editor was not amused.
Then I worked for Intramurals. They
gave me a key to the Ford Center. I broke in
at night to play in the big foamy pits in the
gym. 1 got caught.
Disgruntled with on-campus work, I
started up my own Web-based company.
We made $2.5 million, but our kitchen
manager embezzled it all.
