# Where is your money going?

In the tradition of the Office of the
Special Prosecutor, The Stanford Daily has
stuCk its nose where it doesn't belong. And
probed.
Our investigators have combed through
Stapford Bursar's Office files, searching for
the final destination of your tuition dollars.
The results of our fastidious research are
contained in a lengthy report called the
Banal Probe, the basic tenets of which are
summarized here:
SECTION A: THE HUSH FUND
Students may be unaware that University
administrators actually have established the
Secret Department, whose sole purpose is
to censor what students say and write in
public fora. This department is funded by
the Hush Fund.
A recent target of the Secret Department
was this year's ASSU elections. Instead of
speaking about topics which mattered, stu
dent candidates seemed to have platforms
and campaign slogans which bordered on
the ridiculous. These were not the actual
ideas of the students — what Stanford stu
dent in his right mind would paint himself
in such a light? Instead, the Secret
Department, in order to fruther adminis
tration power over the ASSU, took cam
paigners' original, smart ideas and made
them really stupid.
SECTION B: THE THINKER CONSPIRACY
Where is Rodin's The Thinker? The
University says it is on loan to a museum,
but University files read differently. Your
tuition dollars are funding a joint project
between the French Department and
CISAC, the Defense Department's on-cam
pus representative.
Funds are going toward a defensive retro
fitting of the statue. While the French

Department reads the instructions, workers
from CISAC gingerly remove The Thinker's
brains and replace them with a Patriot mis
sile control module. If enemy planes were
to attack Stanford, a high-tech Star Wars
like defense system would be in place, with
The Thinker at its operating core.
By removing The Thinker's brains, the
University has succeeded in using your
tuition money for self-defense, but who
will take over its philosophical ponderings?
The Daily condems this action as Your
Tuition At Waste!
SECTION C: THE"THINK TANK"
A great deal of debate has always been
centered around the Hoover Institution,
but The Daily has uncovered a squandering
of your tuition that will boggle your mind!
The Hoover Institution's "Think Tank" is
located halfway up Hoover Tower. It con
sists of a glass walled structure that holds
upwards of 700 cubic feet of frigid cold flu
ids designed to keep the tank's contents at
near-freezing temperatures. The "Think
Tank" holds the body of Herbert Hoover.
Around the clock, Hoover fellows tend to
its upkeep and maintenance through a rou
tine dictated by the art of cryogenics as well
as constant meditation.
Shunning the embalming lessons learned
from the upkeep of Lenin's body, Hoover
fellows follow a regiment created by the
authors of the Batman Comic series who
designed a method to keep the evil Mr.
Freeze from dying. In fact, University
administrators attempted to recoup some
of the money spent on Hoover's body and
the "Think Tank" by auditioning him for a
role in Batman and Robin, a role snatched
from Hoover at the last minute by Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
