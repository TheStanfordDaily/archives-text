# How to get a summer job to brag about
## 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
So we're reaching the end of spring quarter,
and you still don't have a job? Well you're in
luck because we have a formula that just
won't fail you. Just remember to play close
attention to each step — like we've done
every summer — and you will find your
selves in a powerful position in just a few
weeks.
THE RESUME
This becomes the most crucial part of the
whole job application process. You'll want to
dazzle future employers, so make sure you
print it on the brightest neon color you can
find. Personally, we like to go for the Astro
green. Often, what you've really done in life
probably won't get you a job, so basically you
have to make things up. Like this:
Boy George
777 Karma Chameleon Lane
Why I want this job: Come on, do you really
want to hurt me?
Education: None
Work experience: In the '80s I was in a band,
and I sang. They did this whole VH-1 docu
mentary on me.
Special skills: ballet, folk dance, tap, fashion
critic, hair expert.
Whv vou should hire me: I'll tumble 4 ya

This should do it for you. I
mean, if they're not going to hire
Boy George, who are they going to
hire?
LETTER OF
RECOMMENDATION
Often, companies will want you
to provide them with a letter of rec
ommendation from a past employ
er or professor. But if you left it up
to these people to write something
for you, you'd probably end up
with a letter like this:
To whom it may concern:
Yea'n, I've heard of Boy. He

worked for me once in the back room. Don't
remember much. I don't think he stole any rub
bers. But then again, I don't keep a close eye on
my boys.
Sincerely,

This simply will not do. We suggest making
up your own letter, like we do year after year.
Try something like this:
To whom it may concern:
Boy George is the epitome of a worker. It is a
pity that he has chosen to leave us in the
upcoming weeks in pursuit of bigger and better
things. When Boy first joined our staff, we were
a meager and drab operation, starving for the
color and brilliant design that Boy has brought
to our new '80s-themed offices. Not only did he
teach us how to dress differently, talk different
ly, do our nails and hair differently, but he also
answered the phone with that sweet voice of his.
I remember once an angry executive called
up, and Boy serenaded him with "Karma
Chameleon," and the whole office broke down
in tears. He was the heart and soul of our oper
ations. The way his fingers glided across the
telephone when he would direct phone calls to
my office brought me to a state of orgasm. He
will be a benefit to any company that hires him.
Sincerely,
Bill Gates, C.E.O. Microsoft

THE INTERVIEW
Next, your future employers will probably
be curious and will most definitely want to
meet you. After all, you are Boy George! Make
sure you dress with flair — this is key. No oris
wants to hire someone with bad hair arid
make-up! Go into that office with confidence
and show them who's boss!
DENIAL
So you didn't get a phone call back. What
went wrong? Don't worry, they're gonna call.
It's been four weeks, but they're gonna call.
PHONE CALL TO DAD AND DAD'S

FRIENDS
Help! I didn't get a call and now
I have no job for the summer!
You've got to help me. Please, 1
promise I won't break anything
this time! I promise!
If this final step doesn't land a
killer job this summer, then
frankly you're rather pathetic. But
no worries — you can always
come work for us. We are current
ly seeking the employment of
interns — er, personal assistants. If
you're a Dollie, you should defi
nitely apply, because you have
preference. Good luck, kiddos!


Oh boy!
