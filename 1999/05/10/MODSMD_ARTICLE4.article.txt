# 'Loveline' hosts dispense advice live from Frost
## Dr. Drew and Corolla respond to sex queries from Stanford audience 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
Frost Amphitheatre was nearly filled
Saturday night with students listening to the
love, sex and relationship advice of Dr.
Drew and Adam Corolla, the hosts of
MTV's "Loveline" and a long-running Cal
ifornia radio show of the same name.
The event was broadcast live on local
radio station Live 105, which sponsored the
show in conjunction with the Stanford Con
cert Network.
The nationally syndicated radio show, of
which MTV now runs a late-night spinoff
version, is usually broadcast from its home
station in Los Angeles.
Dr.-Drew Pinsky is a practicing internist
and director of the chemical dependency
unit at Las Encinas Hospital. Corolla, a pro
fessional comedian, frequently injects a
dosebChumor into Dr. Drew's serious med
ical advice.
Dr. Drew and Corolla, who are jointly a

sort of Dr. Joyce Brothers for the college
crowd, fielded questions from Stanford stu
dents for an hour and a half. Their answers
were liberally interspersed with Corolla's
graphic anecdotes and Dr. Drew's dry com
ments.
The tone of the evening was set by the
first question, posed by a set of blonde
triplets. A close childhood friend had con
fessed his desire to sleep with all three si
multaneously. and a certain awkwardness
now characterized the relationship.
"You can't blame the guy," Corolla
mused, while Dr. Drew said the friend
should have displayed more respect for the
three women.
Questions like these, while they drew
laughter, were not nearly as crowd-pleasing
as Corolla's frequent digressions on prtnl
ucts or services he felt would be both utili
tarian and popular. These included the
training of venereal-disease-sniffing dogs.
Hallmark cards to gently inform a girlfriend
of her body odor and a gay-aptitude test.
"Adam Corolla was pretty offensive,"
said junior Cameron Fortner. "But I guess
you could expect that."
Corolla's first comment of the evening,
"1 though all smart chicks were ugly," re
sulted in turned heads and raised eyebrows

among some audience members.
Inquiries that revealed a basic lack of fa
miliarity with human sexual function were
often greeted with quick one-liners from
Corolla. "Are you pre-med?" he asked one
student. After another question. Corolla di
rected his response to the audience at large:
"Is there a junior college on campus?"
Some students, while obviously expect
ing audience members to ask questions not
drawn from personal experience, were dis
appointed with the level of creativity dis
played in constructing them.
"It was annoying that people made up
these bullshit questions instead of ones that
were relevant or realistic," freshman He
lene Mik said.
Even while answering seemingly spuri
ous questions, Dr. Drew emphasized one
point all evening. He spoke of the phenom
enon in which "women subjugate their own
needs to keep a man" as a widespread prob
lem that needed to be addressed.
He also said that women's psychology,
especially regarding relationships, is much
different from men's and often based his an
swers to questions on this premise. Conse
quently, women's physical and emotional
needs are often overlooked in relationships.
Dr. Drew suggested.
