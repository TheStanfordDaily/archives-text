# Needle scare widens
## Patients from HIV clinic had blood drawn 
### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
HIV-positive patients from a
Stanford clinic may have had
blood drawn by a woman accused
of reusing needles at a Palo Alto
lab, possibly exposing other pa
tients, including some taking part
in Stanford research, to the virus.
Elaine Giorgi, a technician in
the SmithKline Beecham lab at
1 101 Welch Road, was fired April
6 after admitting that she had
reused needles when drawing
blood from patients. She had been
working at the lab for almost two
years.
Stanford officials have con
firmed that at least some patients
from the Positive Care Clinic, run
by UCSF-Stanford Health Care
for the care of HIV-positive pa
tients, were tested at the SmithK
line Beecham lab.
Potential exposure to HIV and
the incident's connection to Stan
ford are the latest twists in a story
that has continued for more than a
month.
Dr. Lawrence Shuer, chief of
staff at the Stanford hospital, said
"it is reasonable to believe that the
Positive Care Clinic patients might
have had HIV." However, patients
sent to the neighboring lab may
have only been undergoing pre
liminary HIV tests.
Although officials are not sure
how many patients were sent to
the lab from the clinic, Kate Rod
don, spokeswoman for UCSF-
Stanford Health Care, insists
"there are probably no more than
a handful."
The clinic did not routinely
send patients to the SmithKline
Beecham lab, according to Rod
don.
"It is not clear why the patients
from the Positive Care Clinic went
to the Beecham lab," said Roddon,
"they probably just wandered
there because it is right across the
street, or they could have been
sent there because of a scheduling
conflict."
Stanford's involvement in the
incident has become part of an in
vestigation that is now the subject
of several lawsuits. The plaintiffs
claim they contracted diseases
from Ciiorgi's alleged abuse of
clinical procedure.
