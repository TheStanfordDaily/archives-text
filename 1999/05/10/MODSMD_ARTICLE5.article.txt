# Needle scare widens
## Patients from HIV clinic had blood drawn 
### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
HIV-positive patients from a
Stanford clinic may have had
blood drawn by a woman accused
of reusing needles at a Palo Alto
lab, possibly exposing other pa
tients, including some taking part
in Stanford research, to the virus.
Elaine Giorgi, a technician in
the SmithKline Beecham lab at
1 101 Welch Road, was fired April
6 after admitting that she had
reused needles when drawing
blood from patients. She had been
working at the lab for almost two
years.
Stanford officials have con
firmed that at least some patients
from the Positive Care Clinic, run
by UCSF-Stanford Health Care
for the care of HIV-positive pa
tients, were tested at the SmithK
line Beecham lab.
Potential exposure to HIV and
the incident's connection to Stan
ford are the latest twists in a story
that has continued for more than a
month.
Dr. Lawrence Shuer, chief of
staff at the Stanford hospital, said
"it is reasonable to believe that the
Positive Care Clinic patients might
have had HIV." However, patients
sent to the neighboring lab may
have only been undergoing pre
liminary HIV tests.
Although officials are not sure
how many patients were sent to
the lab from the clinic, Kate Rod
don, spokeswoman for UCSF-
Stanford Health Care, insists
"there are probably no more than
a handful."
The clinic did not routinely
send patients to the SmithKline
Beecham lab, according to Rod
don.
"It is not clear why the patients
from the Positive Care Clinic went
to the Beecham lab," said Roddon,
"they probably just wandered
there because it is right across the
street, or they could have been
sent there because of a scheduling
conflict."
Stanford's involvement in the
incident has become part of an in
vestigation that is now the subject
of several lawsuits. The plaintiffs
claim they contracted diseases
from Ciiorgi's alleged abuse of
clinical procedure.
One such plaintiff, named in
court papers as Jane Doe 7659 to
protect her privacy, allegedly con
tracted hepatitis C from the lab.
A mother of three, Doe had
blood drawn three times at the lab
as part of a Stanford study and al
legedly tested positive for the dis
ease after having blood drawn by
Giorgi. Her lawsuit is one of four
that have been recently filed be
cause of the alleged reuse of nee
dles. Stanford has not been named
in any of the lawsuits.
"There may have been one or
two studies that sent people to the
SmithKline Beecham lab because
Stanford researchers had contract
ed to have their lab work done
there," Shuer said.
SmithKline Beecham is now
working to determine the risk to
which patients were exposed. "The

chances of disease transmission
are not exceedingly high," said
Shuer, "but they are not zero."
Ken August, spokesman for
California's Department of Health
Services, told the Palo Alto Daily
News that "calculating the poten
tial risk when there are thousands
of patients is nearly impossible."
In addition to working with
SmithKline to identify Stanford
patients that may have been tested
at the clinic, Stanford physicians
are calling patients who may have
been exposed and offering them
free testing in Stanford labs. This is
necessary for patients, Shuer ex
plained, because many had lost
confidence in the Beecham lab.
The lab will be picking up the
bill for the tests.
"We are doing whatever we can
to provide testing for patients at
Stanford labs, and ensuring that
the financial burden is resting
where it should, with SmithKline
Beecham," Shuer said.
