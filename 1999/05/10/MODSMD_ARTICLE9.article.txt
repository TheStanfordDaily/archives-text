## Thousands protest Chinese embassy bombings 
### 
BEIJING (AP) — Chinese demonstrators
called Americans words they have reserved for
their wartime enemies — fascists and imperial
ists — and pitched rocks through windows of
three embassies yesterday to condemn
NATO's accidental bombing of China's
Embassy in Yugoslavia.
Demonstrators by the thousands flowed past
the main U.S. Embassy buildings in Beijing on
a quiet lane lined with locust trees. Many car
ried signs with four Chinese characters that
mean "a debt of blood must be repaid in
blood."
It was the biggest public protest since the
Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstra
tions 10 years ago.
Thousands of police kept watch as the gov
ernment-sanctioned protest went into its sec
ond day and night yesterday but did not try to
stop the rock-throwing.
The Chinese government put the number of
demonstrators at 20,000. but the constant
stream made it difficult to count.
After dark, somewhat smaller numbers of
people were being directed by police along a
route snaking through the embassy district.
"We are essentially hostages of the embassy
at the present time now. We've been here 48
hours without being able to leave," U.S.
Ambassador James Sasser said by telephone to
AP Radio.
He said protesters had thrown a gasoline
bomb through a window and that the govern
ment had encouraged the protests.
Protesters also smashed up paving stones for
ammunition to throw at embassy buildings.
"The danger is that this could spin out of
control," Sasser said.
The demonstrations were dominated by
strongly nationalistic and anti-American
rhetoric.
Profanity and swastikas appeared on many
signs about the United States and President
Clinton.
"Down with the United States," demonstra
tors chanted until they were hoarse. "Protect

the fatherland's sovereignty."
Other embassies were targeted. Demonstra
tors threw rocks at the British and Albanian
embassies nearby and gathered at the German
Embassy in another diplomatic neighborhood.
An Albanian diplomat, Tonin Beci. said by
telephone that his embassy had received threat
ening phone calls from people who claimed
Albania had sided with NATO against
Yugoslavia.
Sasser and his staff expressed "profound sor
row" over the bombing in the Yugoslav capital,
Belgrade, and condolences to families of the
victims, an embassy statement said.
Neither the statement nor Clinton's expres
sion of regret over what he called a "tragic mis
take" were reported by China's state-con
trolled news media.
Chinese media have not reported the Serb
attacks on ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo that NATO airstrikes were
intended to stop. China has blamed NATO for
creating the refugee crisis.
Many protesters believed the Chinese
Embassy was deliberately targeted.
"It infuriates us that innocent Chinese were
killed," said 26-year-old Diana Ou, a worker in
a foreign-owned company win) spoke quietly
while waiting for police to let her and about
1.000 others take their turn protesting in front
of the embassy.
Chinese custom makes clear distinctions
between Chinese and foreigners, who in Chi
nese are literally called "outside people."
But during the demonstration, the distinc
tion often turned hostile, with people yelling
profanities at non-Chinese they assumed were
Americans.
Protests also took place in Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Xi'an and other cities.
In Chengdu, a city in southwestern China,
the U.S. consul's residence was badly damaged
by fire and windows were broken on Saturday,
but no Americans were injured, U.S. Embassy
spokesman Tom Cooney said yesterday.
Police broke up the Chengdu protest with

tear gas, and the small number of staff mem
bers and their families moved to another part of
the eity, the spokesman said.
Demonstrators tried to set an American flag
on fire at one of the embassy buildings in Bei
jing by using a bamboo pole with burning paper
attached. Hut the pole was too short, and police
grabbed it after a struggle.
One popular chant was "break up NATO,"
but the anti-NATO rhetoric was also a jibe at
the United States. State-run news almost
always referred to NATO as being "U.S.-led."
U.S. officials protested to the Chinese gov
ernment that embassy security was inadequate,
in spite of cordons of police in riot gear trying
to keep the crowds back from the iron gates
around the embassy buildings.
Many Beijing demonstrators wore black
armbands and white paper flowers and waved
newspaper photos of three Chinese journalists
killed when NATO missiles struck the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade on Saturday.
More than 20 were injured, six seriously, a
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao appealed
for restraint in a nationwide television broad
cast yesterday evening.
He said the government supports "legal
protest activities" but warned people to be vig
ilant against troublemakers.
Hu said the protests reflected Chinese peo
ple's "strong indignation" and patriotism. But,
he added, "We must prevent overreaction." Hu
also said foreign diplomatic missions and for
eign nationals in China would be protected.
The brown stucco walls of the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing were splattered with red and blue
paint thrown by protesters, and many windows
were broken.
Thousands of people lined streets leading to
the embassy, waiting for police to give them a
turn to march past the compound in groups of
1.000.
Alongside students were thousands of other
Beijing residents, some carrying children. Many
clapped and cheered the students on.
