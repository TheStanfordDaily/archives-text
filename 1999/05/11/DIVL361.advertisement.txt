Healthy sleep has been proven to be the single most important determinant in predicting longevity—more
influential than diet, exercise or heredity—but our modern culture has become a study in sleep deprivation.
Technology's world without darkness wreaks havoc on our body clocks. We sacrifice sleep to meet the demands of our
endless days. Our doctors regard sleep deprivation as a fact of life, and do little to promote sleep health or awareness.
Meanwhile, the physical, emotional and psychological costs of our unhealthy sleep life continue to mount, largely
without mention. In The Promise of Sleep, world-renowned sleep authority William C. Dement, M.D., offers the
definitive look into this unexplored but vital part of our lives, giving readers the information they need to reclaim
their birthright to a good night's sleep.
