# Surprising findings on studying, sleep revealed in study
## 
### Anuj Gupta Staff writer 
Stanford students spend more
hours on academic pursuits per
week than their counterparts at
Harvard and get plenty of sleep each
night, according to results just re
leased from a time-use survey con
ducted by the Dean of Students.
Dean of Students Marc Waissaid
the main purpose of the survey,
which was conducted over a week
long period last November, was to
determine "if any of the information
we garner could be used by the Uni
versity to enhance services and facil
ities for students."
Wais conducted the survey along
with Keith Light, associate director
of development.
Both Wais and Light said that
they were most surprised by two re
sults: the amount of time students
put into academics each week and
the amount of sleep students get
each night.
45 hours on academics
According to the data, students
spend on average 45.24 hours per
week "engaged in academic pur
suits." which include time in classes,
labs and sections as well as home

work and studying.
Light conducted a similar study
at Harvard a decade ago and found
that on average students there de
voted 40 hours per week to acade
mics.
" This supports the idea that Stan
ford students are like ducks on a
lake." Wais said. "They may be calm
and serene on the surface, but they
are kicking like hell underneath."
Light said when asked to guess
how Stanford students' results
would compare to Harvard's, al
most all students believed Harvard
students spend as much as 10 to 15
hours more on academics.
"This shows that, despite the
great weather and the laid-back at
mosphere. people really do work
hard here," Wais said.
Students get enough sleep
The study showed that students
sleep an average of I.W hours per
night, not counting daytime naps.
"The common perception of col
lege students is that they don't get
enough sleep," Wais said. "But this
shows that Stanford students are not
sleep deprived."
The study found students' sleep
ing patterns vary widely. On aver
age, students go to sleep at 2:30 a.m.,
and wake up at 9:06 a.m.
In the study Wais and Light
wrote, "The 9:06 a.m. average wake
up time for students in this study
seems to reflect the rather sparse
student traffic (and attendance) at 8
a.m. and 9 a.m. classes compared to
the hustle and bustle to get to 10 a.m.
classes."
Broad aims and applications
According to Light, the aim of
the study was to garner a broad
profile of student habits.
"We weren't trying to identify
particular individuals. We were
going for a snapshot profile of the
whole crowd," he said.
Both Wais and Light said that
they had no specific goals or pre
conceptions going into the study.

Rather, they wanted to make the
data available to all members of the
Stanford community.
Wais said he is circulating the
report on the results to University
deans, vice provosts and academic
advisers, calling it an "information
resource" which he believes will
have numerous and diverse appli
cations.
Wais and Light pointed to sev
eral specific groups that could use
the data to significantly improve or
adapt their student services, such
as academic advising, libraries, din
ing services, health services and ad
missions.
Wais said he believes the study
will also benefit parents and said
the study could be used at Admit
Weekend, Parents' Weekend and
Orientation.
"It will be reassuring to parents
that students here get a decent
amount of sleep and are working
quite hard on their studies," he
said.

Method and future plans
Wais described this year's survey
as a "pilot" which both he and Light
hope will grow into a more compre
hensive study next year.
This year's survey was residen
tially based. Students in two fresh
man dorms, Donner and Junipero,
and students in two four-class hous
es, Burbank and Roble, were asked
to voluntarily record all their activi
ties during the week of November 2
of last year.
Of the 70 respondents, 52 were
freshman. Men and women were
equally represented in the survey.
Next year, the pair hopes to ex
pand the survey to a random sam
pling of 4(X) undergraduates.
With such a large respondent
pool, Wais said they would be able
to break down and analyze the data
by type of house, such as freshman,
four-class, Greek or Row house, as
well as by class year and major.
"Next year's survey will have a
lot more power behind it,"he said.
