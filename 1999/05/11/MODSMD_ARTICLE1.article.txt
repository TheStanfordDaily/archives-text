# Surprising findings on studying, sleep revealed in study
## 
### Anuj Gupta Staff writer 
Stanford students spend more
hours on academic pursuits per
week than their counterparts at
Harvard and get plenty of sleep each
night, according to results just re
leased from a time-use survey con
ducted by the Dean of Students.
Dean of Students Marc Waissaid
the main purpose of the survey,
which was conducted over a week
long period last November, was to
determine "if any of the information
we garner could be used by the Uni
versity to enhance services and facil
ities for students."
Wais conducted the survey along
with Keith Light, associate director
of development.
Both Wais and Light said that
they were most surprised by two re
sults: the amount of time students
put into academics each week and
the amount of sleep students get
each night.
45 hours on academics
According to the data, students
spend on average 45.24 hours per
week "engaged in academic pur
suits." which include time in classes,
labs and sections as well as home

work and studying.
Light conducted a similar study
at Harvard a decade ago and found
that on average students there de
voted 40 hours per week to acade
mics.
" This supports the idea that Stan
ford students are like ducks on a
lake." Wais said. "They may be calm
and serene on the surface, but they
are kicking like hell underneath."
Light said when asked to guess
how Stanford students' results
would compare to Harvard's, al
most all students believed Harvard
students spend as much as 10 to 15
hours more on academics.
"This shows that, despite the
great weather and the laid-back at
mosphere. people really do work
hard here," Wais said.
Students get enough sleep
The study showed that students
sleep an average of I.W hours per
night, not counting daytime naps.
"The common perception of col
lege students is that they don't get
enough sleep," Wais said. "But this
shows that Stanford students are not
sleep deprived."
