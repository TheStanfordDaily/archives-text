Clinton mobilizes anti youth
violence campaign
WASHINGTON (AP) — Twenty days after
the Colorado school shootings, President Clinton
mobilized gunmakers and the entertainment
industry yesterday for a national campaign against
youth violence. "We'll have to overcome the old
ways of doing business," he declared.
The president challenged producers of violent
movies, video games and CDs to consider the con
sequences of what they make. "We cannot pretend
that there is no impact on our culture and our chil
dren that is adverse if there is too much violence
coming out of what they see and experience," the
president said.
Sixty opinion leaders — from poet Maya
Angelou and American Online chief Steve Case to
singer Gloria Estefan and movie-industry lobbyist
Jack Valenti — came to the White House for three
hours of closed-door talks with Clinton and his
wife, Hillary, and Vice President A 1 Gore and his
wife, Tipper.
In rare praise from a Republican, House Speak
er Dennis Hastert applauded Clinton for holding
the meeting and urged more discussions to "figure
out what's ailing our society and how we can cor
rect it."

returned. "It's the same with smoking. We know
it's bad for us."
