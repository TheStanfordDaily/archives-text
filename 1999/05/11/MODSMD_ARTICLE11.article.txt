BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Yugoslavia
announced a partial withdrawal of its forces from Koso
vo yesterday, a move that was swiftly rejected by the
United States. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
called the reduction in forces a "half-measure," and
NATO said it would continue its bombing campaign
until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws
all of his Serb forces.
The Yugoslav statement, carried by the state-run
Tanjug news agency, said the army supreme command
had ordered the partial withdrawal after finishing its
operations against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
The pullout was to begin at 10 p.m. local time on Sunday,
it said.
The announcement, apparently aimed at garnering
international support for an end to the bombing, gave no
indication of how many troops have been withdrawn, or
how many are left. Virtually all foreign reporters have
left the province under government orders and it could
not be determined if any units have actually left.
The notice also made no mention of the ethnic Alba
nian population, largely driven out or displaced within
the Serb province. The State Department said yesterday
that Serb forces and civilians have expelled more than 90
percent of all ethnic Albanians from their homes.
About 40,(XX) troops, police and special forces are
believed in Kosovo, and they are widely blamed for
expelling some 7(X),(XX) ethnic Albanians into neighbor
ing Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro. Before
NATO air strikes began March 24. Milosevic had an
estimated 12,(XX) troops in the province, including regu
lar and special police, and Yugoslav armv troops sta
tioned along the volatile border with Albania.
Fighting in Kosovo erupted in February 1998 when
Milosevic sent thousands of troops in to crush the KLA.
which is fighting for independence from Serbia.
"Considering the fact that the actions against the so
called Kosovo Liberation Army have been completed,
the Yugoslav army supreme command ordered the
beginning of the partial withdrawal of the army and
police units beginning May 9, 2200 hours," the military
statement said.
It added that when there is agreement on a "U.N mis
sion in Kosovo... it will be possible to realize a plan with
which the army and police units in the province would be
reduced to peacetime levels."
At the United Nations, a spokesman for Secretary-
General Kofi Annan responded cautiously to the
announcement.
"We only have heard initial reports and we'll need
more detail. But if in fact it is confirmed that Yugoslavia

has ordered a partial withdrawal of its troops from Koso
vo. that could be viewed as a positive development,"
Fred Eckhard said.
NATO's conditions for ending the bombing include
an immediate and verifiable end of violence and repres
sion in Kosovo, the withdrawal of Serb forces and
paramilitary police from Kosovo, the deployment in
Kosovo of an international military force, a return of all
refugees and the establishment of an interim political
solution.
Meanwhile, air raid sirens wailed over Belgrade
around lunchtime and NATO missiles pounded a facto
ry for 20 minutes in the central Serbian town of Cacak,
60 miles south of Belgrade, killing four people and injur
ing 13, Tanjug reported.
NATO missiles also landed near the Serbian towns of
Kraljevo, 70 miles southeast of Belgrade, and Raska in
the south.
From the Albanian border town of Kukes, where
thousands of refugees were huddled, NATO bombers
were seen thundering overhead, dumping bombs on tar
gets on the far side of a mountain. Huge plumes could be
seen from the frontier.
The atlaeks followed one of the'quietest nights since

the bombing began — a relative lull that NATO said was
due to bad weather, not beeause of growing Chinese out
rage over the bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade
on Friday.
The embassy strike, which NATO blamed on faulty
intelligence, marked the biggest diplomatic blunder of
the campaign.
In the chapel of a central Belgrade cemetery, the
coffins of the three Chinese journalists killed were laid
among flowers during a memorial service yesterday
attended by some KM) people. They included a delega
tion of high-ranking officials sent from Beijing to inves
tigate.
"They are martyrs to our nation and we take them
back home as heroes," a Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi told reporters. He maintained,
without elaboration, there was evidence NATO deliber
ately targeted the embassy.
In Beijing, protesters thronged the American and
British embassies for the second straight day.
"I regret this," President Clinton said in a fresh apol
ogy yesterday. "But I think it is very important to draw a
distinction between a tragic mistake and a deliberate act
of ethnic cleansing."
