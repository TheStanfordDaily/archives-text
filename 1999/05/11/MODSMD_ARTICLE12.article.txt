HAUULA, Hawaii (AP) â€” Dozens
of people were relaxing and sunning
themselves at one of Hawaii's most spec
tacular hiking spots when boulders the
size of small cars suddenly rained down.
Six people were killed and dozens
injured in the Sunday landslide that let
loose with all sizes of rocks. Yesterday,
heat-seeking cameras and military search
dogs did not find any more bodies under
neath tons of rubble at Sacred Falls State
Park.
Rescuers had to dodge falling debris as
they searched.
"We're pretty much certain there are

no more dead bodies under the land
slide,'" said Honolulu Fire Captain
Richard Soo.
Scores of hikers were taking in the
view and weather at a pool beneath the
park's 90-foot falls when the landslide
began 6(X) feet above them. Hikers and
rescuers told harrowing stories about
bringing victims out of the rubble. Many
suffered head injuries and some lost
limbs.
"There were bodies everywhere,"
David Pahk, a volunteer with the Sacred
Falls Assistance Program, told the Hon
olulu Star-Bulletin. "1 carried bodies live

and dead, with head injuries, arms and
legs broken, open skulls. Everyone was
helping out."
Alter flying over the area, state
Department of Land and Natural
Resources geologist Glenn Bauer said:
'it looks like the cliff face came away."
Four victims were female, and two
were male, including Air Force Master
Sgt. Scott Huling, who was stationed at
Hickam Air Force Base. The victims also
included a young girl from the family of
an Air Force staff sergeant. Their names
were not released.
Thirteen of the injured remained hos

pitalized, including a 2-year-old boy.
State geologists said the valley on the
northeast coast of the island of Oahu
remained unstable, forcing the closure of
the state park.
"It is unsafe for our rescue people or
anybody to go up there," Honolulu Fire
Chief Attilio Leonardi said yesterday.
"When we went up this morning, debris
was still falling down."
The park has long been known as one
of Hawaii's most dangerous. Since 1970,
more than a dozen people have died in
flash floods or hiking accidents at the
park.
