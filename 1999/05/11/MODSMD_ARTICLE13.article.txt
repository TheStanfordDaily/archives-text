# China breaks off military ties and other contacts with U.S.

### 
BEIJING (AP) — China broke
off military ties and other contacts
with the United States yesterday and
demanded those responsible for
NATO's bombing of its embassy in
Yugoslavia be "severely" punished.
Thousands of protesters hurled
rocks at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing
for a third day, with some dragging
and kicking a life-size effigy of a U.S.
soldier with an American flag on his
chest.
Chinese authorities allowed
waves of protesters to descend on
the paint-spattered, debris-strewn
U.S. Embassy from mid-morning
yesterday until early today. Some
hurled burning objects, and Tibetan
monks in blood-red robes also joined
the demonstrations.
Police allowed protesters along a
seven-block route that snaked
between the U.S. and British
embassies and shooed away onlook
ers.
China's suspension of high-level
military ties — and talks over arms
control, international security and
human rights — signaled one of the
lowest ebbs for China-U.S. relations
in 20 years.
China's Foreign Ministry didn't
say when contacts might resume.
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
condemned NATO's attack as a
"vicious invasion" and demanded an
"open and official" apology. He said
the United States must thoroughly
investigate Friday's attack, make the
results public and "severely punish
those responsible."

Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said NATO would provide
China with a full explanation. She
added that statements by Chinese
authorities indicated anti-American
protests in Beijing had the govern
ment's approval.
Hunkered down inside the
embassy compound was U.S.
Ambassador James Sasser, who
refused Tang's summons for a face
to-face meeting. In an interview,
Sasser said the protests got so threat
ening at one point that he ordered
preparations for destroying sensitive
documents.
Tens of thousands of protesters,
spurred on by the government, have
marched in 20 cities nationwide in
the past three days in the biggest
protests since the Tiananmen Square
pro-democracy demonstrations in
Beijing 10 years ago.
Protesters' emotions were
inflamed by government-run media
reports that the attack on the Chi
nese embassy that killed three jour
nalists was deliberate.
"How could you be that shame
less? Get out of China, American
butchers!" read a slogan spray-paint
ed by protesters on a sheet-metal
fence facing the battered U.S.
Embassy.
President Clinton apologized
anew yesterday for the bombing,
calling it "an isolated tragic mistake."
U.S. officials blamed it on misinfor
mation from CIA target planners.
"I apologize. I regret this," Clin
ton said.

China's suspension of contacts
with the United States represented a
blow for Clinton's foreign policy. His
administration has repeatedly cited
talks over human rights, arms con
trol and other issues as proof that
their policy of engaging China was
bearing fruit.
The suspended meetings cover
concerns that China has provided
nuclear weapons or missile technolo
gy to Pakistan, Iran and other coun
tries and comes at a time of contro
versy over Chinese espionage in the
United States.
The measures were similar to
ones China took but never publicly
announced in a confrontation with
Washington over Taiwan in 1995.
China called off a visit by the
Boston Symphony Orchestra and
downgraded but did not cancel a visit
tomorrow by German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder.
Russia's envoy in the Yugoslavia
crisis, Viktor Chernomyrdin, arrived
in Beijing for talks with Chinese
leaders. Aides said he would meet
today with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji.
Chernomyrdin criticized the
embassy bombing, but insisted it
should not derail progress toward
resolving the Kosovo crisis.
Chernomyrdin has led Russia's
bid to find a diplomatic solution to
the 7-week-old conflict, shuttling
around Europe to meet with West
ern and Yugoslav leaders.
The abrupt decision to send him

for talks in Beijing came after Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin talked by phone
with Chinese President Jiang.
"The leaders of both states dis
cussed in detail the situation in
Yugoslavia and its further aggrava
tion due to NATO's barbaric action,
which caused casualties among Chi
nese citizens who served in Bel
grade," said a statement from
Yeltsin's office.
Sasser, a complement of Marines

and other U.S. officials remained
yesterday for safety reasons inside
the U.S. Embassy compound, which
was surrounded by hundreds of
police in riot helmets. Thousands of
demonstrators marched past, paus
ing to shout slogans and throw stones
as they did Saturday and Sunday.
State-run Chinese media helped
set the stage for an angry public with
coverage of the Kosovo conflict that
has ignored Yugoslav atrocities and

set a belligerently anti-American
tone.
Instead of halting the violence,
police guided the protest - directing
the march, blocking nearby streets
and keeping foreign reporters at a
distance. Authorities even ferried
students on buses to the protest.
After clearing the streets in the
vicinity yesterday, police allowed
protesters to return, though in more
regulated groups than on Sunday.
