Recent Deke housing
solution poses questions
about fraternity values

Although we commend
the University's willingness
to accommodate the Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity during their
recent housing crisis, we feel the
Dekes' solution to the problem raises
some questions as to motivations for
being part of the Greek system.
The Dekes almost lost their house
at 592 Mayfield by violating the 100
percent rule, which mandates that all
housed fraternities and sororities
have enough members to be filled to
capacity. Initially, it appeared that the
Dekes' pledge class was 33 members,
far short of filling this capacity.
Then former members of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity decided to
pledge with the Dekes, allowing them
to retain their house for the upcoming
school year. Though the Delts said
that their decision to join the Dekes
was not motivated by the housing sit
uation, it seems convenient that they
dccided to switch fraternities at such
an opportune time.
Deke president Robb Moore said
that the Delts are switching fraterni
ties because they are unsatisfied with
the system. We question whether the
switch will satisfy their fraternal
desires or just fulfill their housing
wishes. If they had really wanted to be

Dekes, why didn't they pledge with
them originally?
The Dekes' solution to their hous
ing crisis appears to indicate that their
first priority is their house because
they were willing to accept people
who originally had no interest in their
organization.
For example, when Theta Xi
became aware last year that they
would lose their house after three
years of declining membership, they
didn't run off and beg for bodies to fill
their house. The Taxis, along with
other unhoused fraternities and
sororities on campus, have managed
to survive and retain a social atmo
sphere despite being unhoused.
Thanks to the University, the
Dekes have been spared discovering
if they could survive without 592
Mayfield. Dean of Students Marc
Wais, gave them a second chance by
reexamining their numbers. He origi
nally intended to remove them, but
after receiving their new Delt-infused
numbers, reconsidered his initial reac
tion.
ITiis action demonstrates that the
University is dedicated to listening to
students' concerns. Wais could have
refused to reexamine information
supplied by the desperate Dekes,
according to established rules.
Through the University's benevo
lence, the Dekes will have the oppor
tunity to reevaluate their goals and
motivations and perhaps prove them
selves in the eyes of the University.
