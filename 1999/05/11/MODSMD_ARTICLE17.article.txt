# Zach Attack
## Lighten up, laugh a little 
### 
Zach Udko

I AM THE proud cre
ator of what one of
my staunchest critics
has called "comic vomit."
Keep in mind, however,
that he is a Stanford
Improviser. Pleased to
meet you.

Chances are that 1 have already offended
you in some capacity. I hope that you did
not take it personally. But if you have been
disgusted or revolted by my words in the
past, you are not alone. You join the presti
gious ranks of the many other lucky people
who have felt the sting of the Diversions
whip, most notably — women, men, blacks,
whites, Asians, Latinos, techies, fuzzies,
prostitutes, Boy George, Housing and Din
ing Services, Cowell, Sigma Chi, Kappa Sig,
horses, men not hung like horses, celibates,
sluts. University Provost Condoleezza Rice,
sticky rice, sketchy people, child actors,
investment bankers, and lepers — to name
a few.
If you are not a member of any of the
above-mentioned groups, I salute you. But
don't feel disheartened: you may be fortu
nate to find yourself as the subject of next
week's romp.
When my fellow Diversions cohorts
cross the line, believe me, we hear about it:
through letters, e-mails, death threats, and
White Plaza vigils burning representations
of my staff in effigy. We risk our lives to
make you laugh.
It has nearly gotten to the point where
we can only mock animals and illiterates.
But mind you, one day they too will learn to
write letters to the editor.
True, comedy is not about degrading fel
low humans. That is why we are not come

dians. We are satirists, and our goal is to get
you all to lighten up. In the agenda-laden
world of I Jniversity life, people can get too
caught up in themselves. Everyone has his
(or her) own group, society, activist organi
zation, community center, peer group lead
ership program, protest movement, hunger
strike, and Take Back The Night. And I
love and respect them all. We need each
and every one of them here on our campus,
otherwise we'd be living in Pat Buchanan's
dream world.
But we also need the satirist to put things
into perspective. The satirist is not particu
lar in whom he chooses to attack. We do not
discriminate. Sometimes we don't even
believe half of the things we write. I, for
instance, am a devoted fan of our outgoing
provost. Or am I?
That is not the point. Our purpose is to
show you all the other side. For every point,
there is always a counterpoint. Often, some
of the lovely extremists on our campus are
blinded by their own thoughts and ideas.
Just have a look at any page of The Stan
ford Review to see what 1 mean. When a
satirist candy-coats tenets of the other side
with humor, perhaps for a brief, shining
moment, they might understand where
much of the rest of the world is coming
from. And it's those moments that we're
aiming for.
Because it's healthy to have a good laugh
at yourself every so often. In doing so, we
keep the size of our head in check and avoid
looking like a Harvard student.
Since this is Stanford — allow me to put
these concepts into purely business-related
terminology: I balance competitive inter
ests. I am the Invisible Hand of Stanford. I
take from the extreme and give to the apa-

thetic. Call me the Robin Hood of the
Farm. It is certainly more palatable than
what that Improviser called me, namely, "a
member of the Galactically Stupid." Too
much sci-fi, folks? I'd say so.
Believe it or not, I am trying to promote
unity and widespread love at Stanford. And
I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle. First
they take away Exotic Erotic, and now I
hear rumors that Full Moon on the Quad
will be solely a "cheek pecking" event next
year. For god's sake, this is supposed to be a
Farm, though I don't feel like there are any
opportunities to take my lady out behind
the barn. Where's the love?
But I digress.
My work has had positive consequences.
Since last week's nasty little rant against
Dining Services, the food has never been
better in my Dining Hall. I spotted a techie
or two at some frat party last weekend, after
we insisted that they must try life outside of
the dorm room. And more importantly, we
are getting people to read and fighting illit
eracy on this campus. We even got a letter
from a Sigma Chi after we lambasted his
frat. And to think that an English professor
actually criticized our work. Shame, shame.
So we will keep on doing what we do
best on the Farm — toiling the soil of con
flicting crops. We want there to be enough
space for everyone to blossom in the sun. So
lighten up, folks, because the last thing we
need on this campus is satirization discrimi
nation. Adieu.

intelligently.
