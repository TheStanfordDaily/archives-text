Give new idea a chance
\
I am tired of my peers' attacks on the
Freshman/Sophomore College. I am tired
of reading The Daily's pessimistic views on
this novel idea. I thought the latest editorial
was heavily negative: wasn't the general
message that the Freshman/Sophomore
College would fail? Such haste in judging is
pretty harsh and not very wise.
I want to live in Sterling Quad next year,
and there are plenty til others who do as
well. I am tired of people saying that the
Freshman/Sophomore College will he like
Structured Liberal Education, especially
when those people are not in SLE. (And by
the way. why is SLE so "bad" anyway?)
The underlying problem is that it is natu
ral instinct to fear the unknown. As such,
the Freshman/Sophomore College plan is
bound to arouse uncertainties and doubts. It
is only logical that this residence option will
not draw overflowing numbers for its first
year.
Before we denounce anything, let us
keep our minds open and realize that many
current successes were once predicted to
fail. Take Sophomore College and the all
sophomore Toyon Hall and, lest we forget,
this University itself. These are now suc
cesses that faced skepticism and critique. So
much for these "failures...

Well, I am not going to be "wasting" my
draw number because I ranked the Fresh
man/Sophomore College as my first choice.
No, in fact, I am happy with my decision. 1
look forward to a fulfilling sophomore
year , even if that means taking a risk.
Alejandro Hucrta
Freshman, undeclared
University neglecting safety
I am appalled at the lack of emphasis
Stanford places on its students' safety, as
evidenced by the fact that the SURE Escort
carts are continually out of order.
Working on my honors thesis compels
me to work in my lab in the Main Quad
until 1:(X) or 2:(X) a.m. most nights. It is
extremely dangerous for me, a lone woman,
to walk from the Quad back to my resi
dence in Suites at this hour.
On Apr. 30, I called SURE from the lab
at 1 :(X) a.m. only to be told that one cart had
been broken for a long time and the other
had a broken headlight, so I could not get a
ride. I tried to walk home but noticed a
large van and several men hanging around
the center of the Quad, which scared me so
much that I called back and asked for a
walking escort. As my escort and I were

walking past Roble Field at 1:30 a.m., a con
vertible drove up beside us with two men in
it. The men screamed foul language at me
and then took out a bottle of water and
threw it on me, soaking my clothes. They
laughed and taunted me, then drove off. I
was terrified.
I was told the SURE carts would be
working again on May 6, so I made sure not
to work late until then. However, when I
called yesterday for a ride I was informed
that neither cart was working yet!
It is ridiculous that I have not been able
to work late on my honors thesis for the past
week simply because Stanford does not con
sider the safety of its students to be a prior
ity.

Don't lose a good thing
I am again saddened at the thoughtless
nature of our University and its attitude
toward student life.
It seems clear to me, and I think to most
students, that the eating clubs are an impor
tant part of the community options that we
have as students; one place where people
can escape the monotony of dorm food and

the sterility of University dining rooms. As
much as the University and its Capital
Improvement Plan would wish us to believe
that community is just the people with
whom you are surrounded, it is clear that
community is a more complicated issue than
they understand.
Community involves a physical place to
be, an aesthetic quality of your surround
ings, and even a sense of healthy division
from other communities. The improvement
or elimination of the eating clubs will almost
certainly rob the eating clubs of these qual
ities which make them different and loved
by students. And in case you feel this a
doomsday prediction, remember the Uni
versity sucking alternative community
options from students (through capital
improvement or otherwise) has a history of
precedent. Remember Alpha Sig, ATO,
Residential Education "militancy," the near
loss of the Terra murals, the slow drowning
of fraternities through 1 (K) percent occupan
cy and other such small violations of
autonomous student community.
1 hope the University will realize the
offensiveness of their actions and leave the
few remaining alternative communities
alone. Somehow I am skeptical.
