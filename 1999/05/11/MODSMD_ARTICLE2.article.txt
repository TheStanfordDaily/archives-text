The Science. Mathematics and
Engineering Core, held to be on
the cutting edge of interdiscipli
nary studies, now faces an uncer
tain future.
At its creation three years ago,
many University officials had high
hopes for the core, a year-long
course geared towards humanities
students.
However difficulties arising
from instituting the new core, in
which students study multiple
fields under the guidance of multi
ple professors, has convinced
some students and faculty that the
program needs a second look.
The core has seen serious en
rollment drops, and students com
plain of a lack of course integra
tion.
These concerns come at a criti
cal time for the core as current
grant support — its principal
source of funding — officially
ends this year.

Funding the core
The brainchild of the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education,
the SME core has cost approximate
ly $2 million to develop and institute
over the past three years.
The program has been funded
entirely by grants and private dona
tions. It was awarded a three-year
$2(X),(XX) grant from the National
Science Foundation as part of its ef
forts to support "institution-wide re
form," as well as another three-year
grant for $1 million from the
William and Flora Hewlitt Founda
tion. Another $1 million came as a
gift from anonymous donors.
But, at the end of this year, the
three-year old SME core will no
longer be able to rely on funds from
these specific three-year grants.
An appropriate allocation of re
sources?
Professors and students alike
have questioned the allocation of so

'I think there should be a question as to whether the program should continue.'
