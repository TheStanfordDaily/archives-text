The Science. Mathematics and
Engineering Core, held to be on
the cutting edge of interdiscipli
nary studies, now faces an uncer
tain future.
At its creation three years ago,
many University officials had high
hopes for the core, a year-long
course geared towards humanities
students.
However difficulties arising
from instituting the new core, in
which students study multiple
fields under the guidance of multi
ple professors, has convinced
some students and faculty that the
program needs a second look.
The core has seen serious en
rollment drops, and students com
plain of a lack of course integra
tion.
These concerns come at a criti
cal time for the core as current
grant support — its principal
source of funding — officially
ends this year.

Funding the core
The brainchild of the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education,
the SME core has cost approximate
ly $2 million to develop and institute
over the past three years.
The program has been funded
entirely by grants and private dona
tions. It was awarded a three-year
$2(X),(XX) grant from the National
Science Foundation as part of its ef
forts to support "institution-wide re
form," as well as another three-year
grant for $1 million from the
William and Flora Hewlitt Founda
tion. Another $1 million came as a
gift from anonymous donors.
But, at the end of this year, the
three-year old SME core will no
longer be able to rely on funds from
these specific three-year grants.
An appropriate allocation of re
sources?
Professors and students alike
have questioned the allocation of so

many resources to a program that has
attracted such a small segment of the
undergraduate population
Electrical Engineering Prof. Brad
Osgood, the core's program director,
said the program can accommodate
between 50and 80 students in each of
its three tracks, which are respective
ly devoted to the study of the earth,
the heart and light. Each of the
tracks, though, enrolled less than 20
students spring quarter.
At least four faculty members
from four different disciplines teach
in each track.
"With only 15 or 16 people in your
class, there are four profs and three
TAs and one lab assistant. So the
ratio is kind of ridiculous," said Seth
Cohen, a freshman who has spent the
entire year in the light track.
Geophysics Prof. Mike
McWilliams, who also teaches in the
earth track, said "If the numbers [of
students] are down as low as they are
now, the actual resources that we're
putting into it are larger than they
ought to be."
"I think there should be a question
as to whether the program should
continue. I hate to use words like
cost-effective when it comes to teach
ing. But at some point whether hav
ing four or five faculty or four or five
TA's for 10 or 15 students has to be
questioned," said Biological Sciences
Prof. Robert Simoni, who teaches in
the heart track. Simoni suggested
that "cutting tracks or support staff"
should be considered.
Osgood said he did not know if the
program would survive in the long
run."I mean we certainly have to and
I think we can increase the number
[of students]. It may be that we can't
have all three tracks running every
year," he continued.
Retention rates as low as 25 per
cent from fall to winter quarter in the
earth track were significantly lower
than those of the past two years. Ad
ministrative Associate Susan Som
merfield speculated that this might
have been due to a change in the pro

gram's credit policies.
In the past students had to stay in
the program for at least two quarters
to receive any credit for Area 2, the
science and mathematics section of
the general distribution require
ments. This was the first year stu
dents received some Area 2 credit lor
the completion of a single quarter
and that policy change may have con
tributed to the significant drop in re
tention rates.
Student criticize core structure
Students largely credit the enroll
ment drop to the course's subject
matter, especially that of the earth
and heart tracks. Some said the cur
riculum was not as coherent or logi
cally presented as it could have been.
Craig Baumgartner, a freshman
who is completing the earth track this
quarter, said, "There hasn't been any
consistency to the subject matter A
lot of the times our weekly labs have
little to do with what we're doing 111
lecture."
Layfer recalled that "when pro
fros were here last week, we basically
told them, whatever you do when
you get the pamphlet in the mail,
don't sign up for SME."
Professors respond to complaints
Biological sciences and heart
track Prof. Sharon Long said that she
believed SME was one of the boldest
attempts to integrate the scientific
and quantitative disciplines into a sin
gle course at any major university.
Referring to the low retention rate
and curriculum problems, however,
Simoni suggested that "maybe it was
a little too bold."
"In the beginning, before all the
material comes together, it appears
that we're teaching a lot of subjects
that aren't as well connected as they
really are," McWilliams continued.
"[But] you have to know the basics
before you can see the higher-level
structures."
"Freshman have less of a perspec
tive, because they haven't seen a mul
tidisciplinary course before," Os
good said. "In the light class we had a

number of upperclassmen, and they
all stayed. They recognized more
what they were getting out ot this ex
perience."
"I don't think [the freshmen] real
ized who was teaching this class and
the kind of effort that we were
putting into it." ()sgood said.
McWilliams emphasized im
provements hi response to such criti
cism
I le also said that the earth faculty
was going to spend the summer "try
ing to figure out what vse can do to
make [the core| more attractive to
upperclassmen and increase the re
tention rate "
I ight I ruck shows potential
Students in the light track, howev
er, were much more positive when
discussing the course. Earning a high
er rating than either the earth or
heart track in the ASSU course
guide, the light track consistently
fared the best in student assessment.
"I've really enjoyed it actually. I
think the multi-disciplinary approach
has really been great," Cohen said.
"[The faculty] definitely understand
how [the lectures and assignments]
all cohere into one unified topic."
Cohen said that he would not re
gret his decision to take SME even if
he had to the "math 40 series for my
major next year."
Erica Williams, a freshman who
also enrolled in the light track for the
entire year, echoed Cohen's senti
ments when she spoke of her experi
ence. "At least in my track the teach
ers did a pretty good job of integrat
ing a wide range of topics," Williams
said.
Williams, however, said that the
structural unity of the course was
more apparent if one did remain en
rolled after the first quarter.
Possible future funding
Criticism or no, Osgood has sever
al tentative plans for future financial
support of the core.
"There's some left over money in
the grant. We haven't spent every
thing, so we can roll that over," Os

good said. "1 think there also are pos
sibilities for further grants from the
NSF for turning the course into pub
lishable material. I think there'sa real
national interest in science educa
tion, especially for non-science ma
jors."
He also mentioned the possibility
of a Hewlett Foundation grant that
might be appropriate for the pro
gram. No grant applications have yet
been filed.
Osgood, who is currently review
ing the core with Vice Provost of Un
dergraduate Education Ramon Sal
divar, also affirmed the possibility of
some sort of university financial sup
port for the program. "As the pro
gram evolves, it will become part of
the regular budgeting in the Vice
Provost's office. At some level, it's
planned to go forward next year. Ex
actly how is part of the evaluation
process," he said.
Saldivar was unwilling to com
ment on the details of the review.
"It's still in process. It's premature to
say what's come out of it,"he said.
SME's origias
While a lack of structural unity
may be students' most common criti
cism of the program, the SME core
was actually designed to improve the
coherence of the science and mathe
matics education of humanities and
social science students.
Osgood, who sat on the original
design committee appointed by the
provost to investigate the SME core,
said that the committee spent a lot of
time analyzing the patterns of Area 2
fulfillment among humanities and so
cial science students.
"We looked at the individual tran
scripts of a couple hundred non-sci
ence majors in the largest non-sci
ence disciplines to see what courses
they were taking. That was what con
vinced me there was very little value
added [to their high school math and
science education]."
"It's not only the courses, it's how
they plan their courses." Osgood
said. "There was not much coherence
at the level of courses and when [the
students] took them."
