## Have faith, but not in Jacques Derrida 
### 
IN HIS IN TRODUCTION to Jacques
Derrida's recent lecture. Philosophy
Prof. Richard Rortv compares him to
Soren Kierkegaard. Hut Kierkegaard, like
Socrates or clowning Hamlet, used irony and
humor as a disarming device, not merely to
make things new. but to make them better in
terms of a glimpsed ideal.
Neither Derrida nor Rortv seem to have
had that experience, and both have made
considerable hay out of spiritual failure. Like
a prankster who upsets an applecart, they are
certainly provocative and get immediate
attention, but they totally lack the staying
power of authentic, substantive and miracu
lous creativity.
The age of Faith gave us Dante, Leonar
do and Shakespeare. Ouestions were raised,
but even Dante could write that "doubting
pleases me no less than believing." But faith
always prevailed.
Even after the Enlightenment. Baude
laire appreciated naivete and simplicity
above all other aesthetic virtues. Mallarme
(whom Derrida has seriously misread) pro
claimed that "you can't do without Eden"
after his adolescent struggle with God.

Albert Camus similarly referred to "the
sacred" in his later years.
In terms of faith versus nihilism, those
who are afraid of being duped end up the
real losers, lost in their own adolescent clev
erness. Those like Derrida who fetishize sec
ular Reason are not only incapable of mas
terpieces, they cannot face the enemy within:
despair is on the rise.
Derrida is considered a minor and passing
figure in France, and authorities on French
thought are amused by the wide academic
cult of him in America. But it is not entirely
a laughing matter. Our current failures of
vision and morality extend stem from a long
tradition of secular critique or "deconstruc
tion," going back to Plato's sophists through
Nietzsche and Heidegger, who have been
discredited by the "events" Derrida rightly
fears in his talk. His public defense of fellow
deconstructor Paul de Man's Nazi tracts
opened quite a few eyes.
Iris Murdoch punctured Derrida's decon
struction on epistemological grounds for his
neglect of experience. This is reminiscent of
Samuel Johnson kicking the rock in order to
refute Edmund Berkeley's solipsism.

In short, from a more complex experi
ence. a familiar momentary wavering of
apprehension, we sense that relativism is
both true and not true. We can also put this
in abstract terms, but for most people, the
experience will do.
Everyone knows that two people who fall
from a great height will obey the same laws
of gravity and acceleration. The number sys
tem underlying the formula may be ques
tioned. but there is still the hard fact of the
violent impact. So we return to our ambiva
lent experience that there are two conflicting
truths out there. "We know and we don't
know," wrote T.S. Eliot. Why get stuck in
one of them, especially when it has proven to
be dangerous and eventually murderous?
On these precise grounds, Camus
reversed his early adulation of Nietzsche.
After he had witnessed the consequences of
nihilism in the gulags and in Auschwitz, he
wrote. "[The absurd] form of reasoning
assures us at the same time that we can kill
and we cannot kill. The basic contradiction,
however, cannot fail to be accompanied by a
host of others from the moment we claim to
remain firmly in the absurdist position, which

is that it is an experience to he lived
through."
Derrida never got that far in his reason
ing; there was no epistemological break
through. let alone the glorious leap of faith a
la Kierkegaard, Proust, James Joyce or
Thomas Mann.
In the chapter on Nietzsche in The Rebel,
Camus blames him for his contributions to
Nazism, observing that when you are playing
for such high intellectual stakes, you'd better
think things through. Recent surveys of mod
ern French thought show that Derrida has
been widely repudiated on these grounds, in
the name of a new Kantian humanism.
Derrida's fanatically one-dimensional
runaway deconstruction is, ironically, a
bizarre mode of what Kierkegaard called
"panlogieism," and extremely phallocentric.
Because it is also so repetitious, he tries to
liven it up with the frills Rorty alludes to. but
there is no central fusion of emotion and rea
son. which all great works of literature or art
accomplish. He is constantly playing little
tricks along with his endless, complicated,
tail-chasing, spidery Byzantine abstractions.
Nils Bohr was similarly hung up on a

quantum principle defining light, involving a
paradox between wave and corpuscle, conti
nuity and discontinuity, and he ran into Ein
stein's Constant. When Derrida charged in to
defend him, Nobel Prize-winning physicist
Stephen Weinberg answered in The New
York Times that his remarks made "no dis
cernible sense" to a physicist.
The main point is, as Camus said, to move
beyond a sterile half-truth, no matter how
alluring it is. It's a safe bet that all geniuses
pass though a youthful nihilistic phase, but
they don't get stuck there. Derrida's abstrac
tions could not be more different from that.
Where his vital center should be, there is
emptiness and mediocrity.
That is exactly the situation of the human
ities at Stanford: cold theory versus raw self
expression. with no middle ground.
So thanks but no thanks. Professor Derri
da, for your asinine world-shaking vision of
the humanities. From a humbly provincial
viewpoint, what they and young souls, need
is a rebirth, not more scattering.
