## Team goes undefeated in six match tourney 
### Robert Chiles Staff writer 
Check... mate! Taking its place
among the game's elites this month is
Stanford's Cardinal Chess Club, vic
torious at the Internet Collegiate
Chess League Championship.
In six matches, played over a peri
od of three months, Stanford didn't
lose to a single opponent.
"Going undefeated as a team
makes it all the more sweet," said
Adrian Keatinge-Clay, a senior and
member of the team.
Stanford participates in a league
comprised of over 50schools with 100
members.
"Winning the Internet Collegiate
Chess League is yet another sign of
the increasing presence of Stanford
University on the intercollegiate
chess scene," said Michael Aigner, a
masters student in mechanical engi
neering and administrator of the
League. "With 16 teams, the ICCL
no longer is a fledgling league but
rather a representative showing of
collegiate chess talent around the
United States."
"Overall, our total score was pret
ty dominant," said Erik Stuart, a stu
dent at the business school. In the
Championship, Stanford scored 20
1/2 points out of a possible 24.
Aigner, Keatinge-Clay and Stuart
are joined on the team by Etan Ilfeld,
a sophomore.

"There were some very good
schools," said Stuart. "We were the
top ranked school going into the
tournament, but not by much. The
toughest matches were probably
against the University of Chicago, the
University of Waterloo (Canada)
and Northwestern University."
All four members of the chess
team engaged their opponents from
computers on campus through a free
internet chess server. "The internet is
the future of chess competition due
to the cost of travel to tournaments,"
said Aigner.
"The internet college chess tour
naments are really something special
because it allows those schools that
have outstanding teams, but without
plentiful resources, a chance to com
pete," added Keatinge-Clay.
Stuart said playing over the inter
net didn't change the competitive na
ture of the game.
"Strategy-wise, I wouldn't say that
it's that different," said Stuart. "It
doesn't have the interpersonal inten
sity of an over-the-board match. At
the same time, you certainly have the
motivation of representing your uni
versity, and that helps you."
Stuart explained that it is crucial
with team play to know when a play
er needs to play it safe and tie or go
for the kill. This decision depends on
the status of other games.
In December, the Club also took
third place at the Pan-American In-

tercollegiate Chess Championships
in Dallas, Texas.
"Other schools had their chance
over the internet, and we reaffirmed
our finish in the Pan-Ams."
In 1996 and 1997, the team
achieved moderate success, but did
not really push the top contenders.
"The two previous years we re
ceived three out of six points," said
Keatinge-Clay in reference to the
Fan-Am competition.
"This year we obtained four out of
six. En route to victory, we defeated
the second-seeded University of
Toronto as well as Harvard! Stanford
has become a national chess force in
only four short years since the found
ing of the Cardinal Chess Club by
IrvinTyan."
Stuart shared Keatinge-Clay's en
thusiasm for the team's recent smoth
ering of the competition.
"It's really been an amazing year
for chess at Stanford, bigger than we
could've dreamed two years ago,"
Stuart said.
"With the arrival of yet another
master rated freshman in the fall,
next year's team will have the poten
tial to continue this excellence,"
added Aigner.
"To us, chess is more than a casu
al game," reflected Aigner. "It is a
competition just like football or bas
ketball, and winning the Internet
Collegiate Chess League is akin to
winning a national championship."
