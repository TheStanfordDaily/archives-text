## Baseball overpowers San Francisco Cardinal hopes to take Pac-10 title at UCLA this weekend 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
The past four games, sixth-ranked
Stanford has done just enough to
win.
Last night, the powerful Cardinal
offense did enough and then some,
pounding San Francisco 16-3 at
Sunken Diamond to notch a season
high tenth straight win.
Stanford (37-12) was able to use
17 players and a trio of pitchers —
sophomore Justin Wayne, freshman
Brian Sager and sophomore reliever
Austin Coose — to post its most lop
sided victory of the year.

■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford (37-12)
vs. San Francisco (19-32-1) 6 p.m.
Sunken Diamond.

"We did a good job tonight," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We
got some hits, we got around 50
pitches out of Wayne and Sager and
got Coose on the mound for some
work."
The Cardinal's five-run fifth in
ning truly broke the game open,
blowing a close four-run game into a
10-1 drubbing of the Dons (19-32-1).
Junior second baseman Jeff
Rizzo, senior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang and junior center field
er Edmund Muth all tripled and ju
nior shortstop Eric Bruntlett added
an RBI single in the inning.
Sophomore Joe Borchard contin
ued his hot season at the plate, going
2-for-3 with four RBIs and three runs
scored to raise his average to a team
high .410. The switch-hitting right
fielder also tallied his ninth home run
of the season with a screaming line
drive straight at the left-field score
board in the seventh inning.
"I feel good, I'm seeing the ball
well and I'm getting good pitches to
hit," Borchard said.
Obviously, Marquess is thrilled
with the production he is seeing out
of his cleanup hitter.
"Anytime you're hitting over
.400, you're having a great year," said
