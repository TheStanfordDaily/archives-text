## Baseball overpowers San Francisco Cardinal hopes to take Pac-10 title at UCLA this weekend 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
The past four games, sixth-ranked
Stanford has done just enough to
win.
Last night, the powerful Cardinal
offense did enough and then some,
pounding San Francisco 16-3 at
Sunken Diamond to notch a season
high tenth straight win.
Stanford (37-12) was able to use
17 players and a trio of pitchers —
sophomore Justin Wayne, freshman
Brian Sager and sophomore reliever
Austin Coose — to post its most lop
sided victory of the year.

Sunken Diamond.

"We did a good job tonight," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We
got some hits, we got around 50
pitches out of Wayne and Sager and
got Coose on the mound for some
work."
The Cardinal's five-run fifth in
ning truly broke the game open,
blowing a close four-run game into a
10-1 drubbing of the Dons (19-32-1).
Junior second baseman Jeff
Rizzo, senior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang and junior center field
er Edmund Muth all tripled and ju
nior shortstop Eric Bruntlett added
an RBI single in the inning.
Sophomore Joe Borchard contin
ued his hot season at the plate, going
2-for-3 with four RBIs and three runs
scored to raise his average to a team
high .410. The switch-hitting right
fielder also tallied his ninth home run
of the season with a screaming line
drive straight at the left-field score
board in the seventh inning.
"I feel good, I'm seeing the ball
well and I'm getting good pitches to
hit," Borchard said.
Obviously, Marquess is thrilled
with the production he is seeing out
of his cleanup hitter.
"Anytime you're hitting over
.400, you're having a great year," said

Marquess, who hit .404 for Stanford
in 1967. "He got a big hit again
tonight — with two outs in the third,
he hit that double to drive in two runs
when the game was still close. "
Marquess admitted neither Sager
nor Wayne kx)ked particularly sharp,
but both put on satisfactory perfor

mances. especially considering both
received tremendous run support.
Wayne gave up one run on two
hits and a walk in three innings in
recording his seventh win of the year.
Sager struggled more with his con
trol — and felt it. After allowing his
third walk of the night with one out in
the seventh, Sager forced Marquess
to take him out in favor of Coose.
Though Coose also looked a little
wild, he finished with three strikeouts

to close the game for the Cardinal.
The pitching staff was not needed
as much as in its 2-1 win against Pacif
ic Wednesday or its 4-3 win Friday
against St. Mary's because of its of
fensive production.
"We should consider ourselves
fortunate to have been getting the
type of pitching we have been," Bor
chard said. "But tonight we put some
runs up. Lately, if we're not getting
one, we're getting the other."
