GAME 2 Stanford 2, Oregon State
1.

The No. 14 Stanford softball team
(40-21,10-16 Pacific 10 Conference)
discovered this phenomenon on its
trip to Oregon this past weekend.
Taking one of two games from both
No. 18 Oregon (39-25,10-16) and No.
11 Oregon State (40-21, 10-16), the
Cardinal currently finds itself in a tie
for sixth in the Pac-10 with one dou
bleheader remaining in the season.
"We would have liked to do bet
ter, but a split on the road in this con
ference is nothing to hang your head
about," said Stanford head coach
John Rittman.
The two splits evidence what the
Cardinal views as its biggest weak
ness at this point, the inability to play
a solid 14 innings.
Saturday, the Cardinal split its
doubleheader with Oregon, pound
ing the Ducks 10-1 in the first game,
but dropping the second 2-0.
Both Stanford and Oregon tallied

runs in the first inning of game one,
but the Cardinal went on to put nine
runs up while shutting out the Ducks.
Senior Jennie Foyle led off the
game with a double to left and came
around to score on senior Michelle
Schneider's single to center field.
Oregon equalized in the bottom half
of the inning, but left the bases
loaded.
"Marcy pitched very well out of a
jam in the first inning," Rittman said.
The Cardinal never looked back,
however, and added four runs in the
fifth and five in the sixth. The team
combined for ten hits, led by Schnei
der, who reached base in all four of
her at bats with three singles and a
walk for three RBIs. Foyle had two
doubles on the day and freshman
Sarah Beeson added two hits as well.
"Not only did we hit the ball, but
we forced [four] errors and were re
ally aggressive," Rittman said.
Crouch picked up her 21st win of
the season, and the Cardinal earned
its 39th team victory.
After the offensive explosion of
game one, Stanford was unable to
put a single run on the board in game
two. The Ducks scored one run in
both the first and the sixth innings to
earn the 2-0 victory.
Oregon went ahead in the first in
ning and never looked back. Fresh
man Missy Coe doubled and moved
to third on senior Katie Mackey's
double. Coe then came around to
score on a fielder's choice by senior
Jennie Cook. The Ducks then loaded
the bases, but the Cardinal worked it
sell out ol'the jam to allow only one
run.
Stanford's offense, however,
couldn't equalize as it put only four
hits on the board all game. Opportu
nities were squandered as the Cardi
nal left the bases loaded in the third
inning, and then left two more run
ners on in the fourth.
An insurance run was added in
the sixth inning, as Oregon pieced
together two walks, a bunt and a
base hit for a run. Senior Becky
Blcvins suffered the loss for Stan
ford.
1 lie following day.the Cardinal
traveled toOSI I where it again took
one of two games. In this twin-bill,
the ( ardinal dropped game one but
proceeded to win the second game.
The Beavers used three runs in
the third inning and one in the fourth
to take the game. Stanford managed
two runs in the top of the seventh,
but was unable to complete the
comeback.
"We got behind and had plenty
ol opportunities but just didn't capi
talize on them." Rittman said. "We
kept out heads up and kept battling
and are proud of that."
I his persistent attitude earned
Stanford the 2-1 win in game two.
With runs in the first and second,
Stan fitril lie Id i>nt he rest of the game
for the victory.
