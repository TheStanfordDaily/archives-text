# Hauser and cast scorch the track
## 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
A lot of people talk about the
decline of top flight distance run
ning in the United States. This
weekend. Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna stood up and did some
thing about it.
Lananna gathered some of the
biggest names in American and in
ternational track and field, pro
duced one of the deepest fields ever
seen in the United States and threw
his own elite athletes into the mix to
prove a point at this weekend's
Cardinal Invitational.
The results speak for them
selves. Seven men, including Stan
ford junior Brad Hauser, met the
world qualifying standard of 28
minutes, 10.00 seconds in the
10,000 meters. Seven men qualified
automatically for the NCAA
championships in the 5,000 meters
and another seven secured provi
sional marks in the 1,500.
But numbers fail to capture the
fire with which these races scorched
the track.
The 10,000 lived up to its top
billing, as American great Bob
Kennedy blazed to the fastest time
ever run on Stanford's Cobb Track
in his debut in the event.
The pace was brisk from the be
ginning as the designated paceset
ters. who were instructed to run the
opening 5,000 meters in a conserva
tive 14:03, could not ease the adren
aline throttle and instead cruised
through the first half in 13:56.
The strong pace forced Stan
ford's Brad and Brent Hauser to
commit early or be left in the dust.
With Brent suffering from a blister
on his foot which developed early
and later forced his exit. Brad chose
to go with the leaders.
That choice almost cost him the
qualifying mark. The pace only
quickened from the halfway point,
as Kennedy battled Kenyan
Michael Njenga, each running suc
cessively faster kilometers. Hauser

could not hang onto their ferocious
pace and was left by himself in no
man's land, as runners trailing him
began to close the gap.
By the time Kennedy made the
decisive move which left Njenga in
his wake with one mile to go,
Hauser looked to be out of qualify
ing range. Running around 10th
place with laps in the 70-second
range for much of the last mile, his
need for a 64-second final lap to
meet the standard looked to be a
tall order.
But Hauser only got tougher.
With 300 meters to go, Hauser's af
terburners kicked in, powering him
to a 62 second final lap and securing
the Stanford school record in
28:08.12. Kennedy won the race in
27:38.37.
"The 10,000 went out too fast for
our guys, and I think they never re
ally settled back," said Lananna.
"But Brad is so tough. He pressed a
little too hard in the beginning, but
1 think it'll be a valuable learning
experience. He got the World qual
ifier, and that's what counts."
Senior Jake Maas fought hard
against a star studded field to grab
a solid provisional qualifier in the
1,500 at 3:41.99, a personal best
that was good for seventh place
overall.
"Even though he's kind of been
in the shadow of all the big-name
guys, Jake's been a deliverer." said
Lananna "He's a guy who's put the
work in, put the time in, he's paid
his dues and it's nice for his work to
come to fruition."
The 800 saw freshmen Logan
Taylor and Ryan Meuse both cap
ture personal bests at 1:51.54 and
1:5 U7O, respectively, and Cardinal
redshirts Gabe Jennings (1:48.40),
Michael Stember (1:49.16), and Jon
Stevens (1:50.05) showed that they
haven't lost a step.
Sophomore Jonathon Riley,
also a current redshirt, cruised to a
second-place 13:36.69 in the 5,000
