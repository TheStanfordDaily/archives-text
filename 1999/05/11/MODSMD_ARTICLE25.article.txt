## 
### Barn Cooper Staff Writer 
While the major focus at Friday
night's Cardinal Invitational at
Cobb Track and Angell Field was on
the men's 10.000 meters, there cer
tainly was no lack of competition in
the women's field. All three distance
events, the 1,500-, 3,000- and 5,000-
meter races produced outstanding
times.
Masterminded by Stanford head
coach Vin Lananna. the races fea
tured some of the best collegiate
competition in the country as well as
a few post-collegiate standouts.
For the Cardinal the best perfor
mance came from senior Mary Cobb
in the S.(XX). After missing last year's
track seasons as well as this year's in
door season. Cobb had been show
ing signs of incremental improve
ment. Friday she had a major break
through as she finished seventh,
clocking 16 minutes. 11.21 seconds,
an NCAA automatic qualifier.
"I think she rose to the occasion,"
Lananna said. "That's the old Mary
Cobb back again. I think she's got a
lot more running left in her."
The race was paced by Stanford's
Sally Glynn who ran the first 3,000
meters in about 9:36 and then
dropped out as planned. From there
Amy Yoder of Arkansas took over.
While Cobb hung with the front
pack of women. Yoder eventually
pulled away to win in 15:49.85, the
number one time in the NCAA this
season as well as a USA Outdoor
Championship qualifying time.
"I felt great in the race." Cobb
said. "I know what I need to work on
to fix it up. 1 haven't started to peak
yet, and as a team we're just getting
going, so we have a long way to go to

get better. We're all on a roll."
Stanford's Sarna Renfro finished
14th in 16:49.56, just under the
NCAA provisional mark.
Sophomore Julia Stamps led the
3,(XX) meter race most of the way, but
Leigh Daniel of Texas Tech passed
her during the sixth lap. Stamps
hung on to second until the last 2(X)
meters, when she was passed by two
BYU women. Her time of 9:27.07 is
a provisional qualifying mark. Red
shirt sophomore Courtney Adams
made her season debut in the same
race and also hit the provisional
qualifying time with a sixth place fin
ish in 9:36.49.
The weekend was more than dis
tance events for Stanford, the sprint
ers, throwers and jumpers competed
at Stanford on Friday and at the
Modesto Relays over the weekend.
Standing out among the sprinters
was redshirt sophomore Wilsa
Charles. She won both the lOOmeter
dash at the Cardinal Invite and the
Modesto Relays open competition.
Other strong performances by fresh
man Robyn Woolfolkin the 1(X) hur
dles (Ist at Modesto) and Jayna
Smith in the 4(X) (2nd at the Cardinal
Invitational) have Lananna hopeful
for the upcoming Pacicfic 10 Confer
ence Championships.
