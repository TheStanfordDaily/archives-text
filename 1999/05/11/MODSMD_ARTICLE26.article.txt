# Kimball, Frosh/Soph College offer new priority opportunities
## 
### Jeff Port 
Students entering the Draw this
year have two new opportunities to
obtain priority to help them get into
their desired residences.
Kimball Hall has become the Arts
and Performing Arts focus house,
while Adanis and Schiff in Sterling
Ouad are now part of the new Fresh
man / Sophomore ('oI lege.
Kimball resident fellow Jonathan
Berger, a music department profes
sor, expects the atmosphere of the
house to change greatly next year.
"We're taking the idea of the
focus very seriously," Berger said.
"We expect it to become a very
strong house for the arts on campus."
Junior Charles Chang, a resident
assistant in Kimball responsible for
assigning priority to applicants, ex
pressed enthusiasm for the applica
tions he read. "We were very pleas
antly surprised by the quality of the
applicants, who had great ideas for
activities for the dorm," he said.
"Some showed the arts as something
they devoted their whole life to. It re
ally showed through in the quality of
their applications."
Chang also felt the large number
of applications highlighted the differ
ence between those who were really
passionate about the focus and others
simply looking for good housing.
Although many students wanted
lo live in Kimball regardless of the
focus, it strengthened the allure of the
dorm for some.
"I actually wanted to live there be
fore I knew it was the performing arts
house," said freshman Campbell
Miller. "But the focus made me hap
pier to apply, since I'm involved in
the arts."
According to Chang, Kimball re
ceived approximately 370 priority ap
plications, while Berger said there

were about 70 priority spaces avail
able in the house.
While obtaining priority does not
guarantee entrance into a house, all
priority spots are filled before non
priority students are assigned, re
gardless of Draw number.
Although interest in the new
Freshman / Sophomore College was
not nearly as high as Kimball's, there
was also no shortage of applicants.
The college has 90 spaces reserved
for priority, and about 90 current
freshmen applied.
Materials Science Prof. John
Bravman, the dean of the new col
lege, does not see this as a problem.
"In a sense, I'm glad I don't have
to turn people away," said Bravman.
"To get sixty or seventy current fresh
man applying is fine. We were actual
ly planning on the balance of the stu
dents, around 95, being freshmen for
the first year, with another 10 or 15
sophomore transfer students."
"It looked like an interesting pro
gram, something I could get into fair
ly easily, and even with a bad Draw
number," freshman Darren Lee said.
Some of the apathy toward the
college can be traced to its location,
which some feel is too isolated for
freshmen and sophomores.
"I would have been much more
enthusiastic toward Frosh-Soph Col
lege had it been in a better location,"
said freshman Robert McCirew.
Bravman stressed that the loca
tion for the college could work posi
tively. With the location somewhat
isolated, Bravman said, "It may help
people bond as a community. People
should choose it for the academic en
vironment, even if it means an extra
two minutes walk to class."
Bravman is confident the college
will become a vital part of campus.
"We'll succeed," he said, "and we'll
take it from there."
