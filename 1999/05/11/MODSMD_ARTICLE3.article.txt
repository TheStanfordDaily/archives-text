# 'Middle Passage' author speaks
## 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
Charles Johnson, winner of the National Book Award
for his novel "The Middle Passage," discussed the creative
process behind fiction writing to an audience of about 50
last night. His talk was the debut lecture of the Freshman
Book Project in which freshmen have the option to read a
work and attend a talk by its author.
Johnson, a doctor of philosophy, former journalist, re
cipient of the 1998 Mac Arthur "Genius Grant" Fellow
ship and the University of Washington's Pollock En
dowed Professor of Creative Writing, began his talk by
reading from the first chapter of his novel.
Johnson followed his reading with his newly complet
ed paper titled "The Story Behind the Story," an account
of the "genesis" of "The Middle Passage." "Every work of
art is first and foremost a process of discovery for the

writer and the reader both," said Johnson, setting the tone
for his talk, which focused on the creative process of writ
ing a novel.
Johnson then opened the floor to questions from stu
dents and faculty. Many of the questions centered on the
novel itself, which many, like freshman Tarica Chambliss,
found intriguing.
"I thought the book was striking because of how vivid
it was. It always fascinates me when people can write
about history in a novel way, as if they were there, when
they obviously weren't... He kind of channeled the spir
its," she said.
Johnson visited Stanford as the first of many authors to
speak for Stanford's Freshman Book Project.
