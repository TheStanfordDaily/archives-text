# RAs chosen for next year's dorms, houses
## 167 students survive numerous interviews in strenuous process 
### Virginia Yang Contributing writer 
Two weeks ago, several students
around campus got an early-morn
ing surprise: the West Lagunita
Court resident assistants, dressed in
the black clothing resembling char
acters from"The Matrix," rolled
next year's West Lagunita RAs out
of bed.
These lucky students were just six
of 167 students announced on April
30 as RAs for next year. They were
chosen after a lengthy application
and interview process which initially
included a pool of 319 applicants.
This year the interview period
was extended from two weeks to
three weeks to allow the resident fel
lows to fit more interviews into their
schedules.
The application process began
early in the year, with an informa
tional meeti. g on October 28 for
RA applicants who were planning
on going away winter and spring

quarters. For applicants going
through the regular application
process, the first informational
meeting was on March 3.
After the informational meeting,
the application process spanned al
most two months, with the deadline
for acceptance of RA positions on
April 30.
After the initial meeting, the ap
plicants had to submit a registration
application. Then they had to attend
RF informational meetings to help
them decide which dorms they
would be interested in working in.
The applicants also had to get two
recommendations, preferably from
their current RAs and RFs.
Then, based on preferences
which the applicants listed, RFs
called them back for interviews.
Many RFs had more than one round
of interviews. According to many
applicants, the interviews were very
rigorous and took up a great deal of
time.
Sophomore Carley Maak, an in
coming RAin Lagunita next year,
felt that the application process was
very long hut worthwhile.
"I think they try to do their best
during the selection process because
there are so many applicants," she
said.

Maak had to go to a total of four
teen interviews: eight first round in
terviews and six second round inter
views in a span of three weeks.
Most RFs had two rounds of in
terviews, one group interview and a
second one-on-one interview.
Group interviews consisted of field
days, activities and skits.
Sophomore Nidhi Jacob, an RA
at Kimball next year, felt that the ap
plication process was tiring but en
joyed the group interviews. "It was

great doing group activities and
meeting new \ eople," she said.
The applicants see many advan
tages to becoming an RA, including
leadership training, the ability to
make changes at their dorms and
meeting new people. There is also a
tax-free stipend.
However, according to Maak, the
biggest disadvantage is that "you
have a hard time keeping in touch
with friends because you are so into
your dorm."
