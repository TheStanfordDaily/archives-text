# Waiting in line
## Cancer center fights for Palo Alto approval 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
Wednesday is a light day at one of Stanford Hospi
tal's cancer treatment clinics. There used to he too many
patients on Wednesday, so the schedule was changed.
Still, the waiting room at the Radiation Oncology Unit
is full. On heavier days, patients have to sit on the floor
or on chairs lining the hallways.
In the hall, too, is a small gurney covered with a flan
nel baby blanket. On a heavy day, that's where a child
with leukemia might wait for treatment. Children share
the clinic with adults. And everyone — doctors,patients
and staff — shares two bathrooms too narrow to ac
commodate a wheelchair.
There are no windows in this world-renowned clinic,
located in the hospital's basement. There's only fluores
cent lighting and always the constant thrum of the esca
lator that carries you to the main floor and daylight.
"The doctors here could be making four times as
much money in private practice," said Charlotte Jacobs,
director of the Clinical Cancer Center, in a confidential
whisper. "But this is where they want to be."
v However where most of these doctors really want to
bb is in a building yet to be constructed —a $ 118 million
effiter that would gather all the hospital's cancer treat
ment facilities under one roof rather than spread over
three different buildings. The building plans are taped to
the back door of one of the offices in the Radiation On
cology Unit.
Bureaucratic stumbling blocks
But the Palo Alto City Council must approve the
plans, since the proposed site — now a parking lot be
tween the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital
and the Blake Wilbur Clinic — falls under jurisdiction
of the city.
In February, several council members indicated that
they would be unlikely to approve any new develop
ments on Stanford land within the city's jurisdiction —
including the cancer center- —unless the University
committed to a land — use plan that showed areas re
served for open space.
Since then, the University has embarked on a process
with the city and Santa Clara County to develop a new
general land-use plan, which is expected to be submitted
for an initial review in September of this year and com
pleted by November of 2(KK). There will be a seriesof fo
rums held over the summer, open to the public, to de
bate some aspects of the plan.
However, it is not yet clear how the plan will affect
the approval of the cancer center plans. According to
Andy Coe, director of community relations at Stanford,
the city wants to make sure that Stanford's land-use
plans are made public before it has to act on the cancer
center. That's not likely to happen, though, because the
erfvironmental impact report on the building proposal
has to be completed first. It is scheduled to be done by
the fall of this year.
"Our goal is that when we finally submit the land-use
plan, there will be strong support for it," said Coe. "The
cancer center will likely come before council in late 1999
or-early 2(XX), well after Stanford announces its long
term plans."
C ity council member Joe Huber,
who heads up an ad-hoc committee
formed to address development and
land preservation issues said that
some on the council will be more in
clined to approve the cancer center
proposal if Stanford comes up with an
acceptable guarantee for open space.
Other council members will be more
influenced by the big picture of the
University's overall development
plans for the campus.
"We wanted Stanford to get mov
ing on planning," Hubersaid.'i think
things are happening that we wanted
to happen under the ad-hoc commit
tee proposals."
Still, he added that there is "far
more support to pull in the reins [on
the cancer center proposal) than
some might think."
According to Huber. approval of
the cancer center is completely dis
cretionary because of the current
zoning restrictions on the proposed
location.
"There is no entitlement there,"
I luber said. "Council can say no, and
we don't have to have a reason to say
no lor that location. It's not that we
quarrel with the value of the project,
but there's got to be a limit. It is with
in our right to say to Stanford,
'You're going to have to go some
where else to do this — bless some
body else with your center.' "
Coe confirmed that the University
does need a zoning change in order
for the cancercenter project togo for
ward.
So for now at least, the situation

can best be summed up as "wait and
see."
Projected benefits
The new cancer treatment center
would be a 218,000-square-foot
building housing doctors' offices, pa
tient rooms, radiation and
chemotherapy units — everything
needed for total cancer care — to
gether.
Normally, all the different doctors
involved in the treatment of a cancer
patient work independently. Stan
ford would like to be a leader in what
Jacobs calls "integrative care." For
example, a patient with bone cancer
would be able to see a radiation on
cologist, a surgeon and a bone mar
row specialist in one place, making
treatment easier.
"Our current facilities are 20 to 30
years old," Jacobs said. "We've out
grown them in size and ability to sup
port the technology. You need more
space to take care of cancer patients
now than before."
Jacobs used the example of a radi
ation machine. Twenty years ago, a
patient could stand in front of a small
radiation machine, and it would pen
etrate the whole area being treated,
destroying healthy tissue along with
the cancer. Now, the radiation ma
chine rotates around patients and is
much better at preserving healthy tis
sue. Hut it's also a lot bigger.
Treatments such as radiation and
chemotherapy can now take as long
as four to eight hours a week, accord
ing to Jacobs. She thinks it is impor
tant for patients to have a pleasant en
vironment when they spend so much
of their time at the hospital.

"We're not talking about luxuries
but about basic humane needs," she
said.
Jacobs is understandably impa
tient to see the plans for the cancer
center become a reality, especially
now that most of the $50 million in
costs has been raised.
Hut for a while, she felt like she
was "living in the wrong moment in
time."
"After Sand Hill, people were
tired of talking about Stanford," Ja
cobs said.
"It was like, 'Enough, already,' "
she said, referring to Stanford pro
jects, approved by the Palo Alto City
Council in 1997, to widen and extend
Sand Hill Road down to El Camino
Real. Also included are plans to ex
pand Stanford Shopping Center by
KO,(XX) square feet and build a senior
citizens' apartment complex, as well
as 628 new apartments primarily for
employees of the University. Work
on the projects began in February.
According to city council member
Sandy Eakins, the Sand Hill projects
were approved on the understanding
that Stanford would draw up a land
use plan and share it with the city.
"It's not just about open space,
said Eakins in an interview in March
of this year. "It's about Stanford lay
ing the cards on the table."
Activists' concerns
Palo Alto only controls certain
parts of the Stanford campus — prin
cipally the area of the Stanford Shop
ping Center and parts of the hospital.
The central areas of campus are on
unincorporated Santa Clara County
land, and development there is regu

lated by an agreement between the
University and the eounty called a
general-use permit, which sets a limit
on how many square feet of building
can be erected on county land. Stan
ford is expected to reach that limit at
some point in the next two years and
needs a new agreement.
Denice Dade, representative of
the Committee for Green F(X)thills, a
lobbying organization devoted to
conserving open space, said that
Stanford has traditionally enjoyed
tremendous freedom in its land-use
agreement with Santa Clara County
and that it is time for a change. She
hopes change will come as Stanford
negotiates with the county for the
new general-use permit. For Dade,
the issue was always about gtx)d plan
ning.
"The real issue is not the cancer
center," Dade said, 'it's working on
getting the county to have Stanford
do any long-range comprehensive
planning. They've never had to do
that. They've been given too much
freedom."
Dade is also critical of the way
Stanford introduces many of its de
velopment plans to both the city and
the county.
"Stanford has a tendency to create
emergencies," she said. "It's a way of
manipulating the community to get
what you want."
Some city council members
thought that Stanford's proposal to
build the cancer center was the latest
in a long line of "emergencies."
"When [Stanford] turns around
and says 'Cancer is important!' you
feel like you're being held hostage,"
Eakins said.
Stanford asks for trust
Coe disagrees that Stanford cre
ates emergencies. 11c said he wishes
that Stanford would get more credit
for its campus planning.
"We take planning very serious
ly," Coe said. "When we have a prob
lem. we identify it.and then we come
up with a solution. And we also get
criticized. Hut the fact is, we have pri
vate land resources, and we have the
ability to respond to crises."
Coe also said that Stanford does
engage in long-term land-use plan
ning. He referred to a document ti
tled "Land-Use Plan, 19S0-2010."
which designates how Stanford's land

should be used, as well as a document
he calls the "Tan Book" — a list of
proposed building plans from IWK to
2(KX). so named because of its brown
cover.
According to Coe, an additional
land-use plan was not a condition of
approval for the Sand Hill projects.
He also said the University is pre
vented from declaring any areas, in
cluding the foothills, open space be
cause of a stipulation in Stanford's
founding grant.
The grant says that all Stanford
lands must be held to support the aca
demic mission of the University —
and open space does not fit that defi
nition.
"That's where we want the com
munity to trust us," said Coe. "We
have a 1 (K)-year track record of no de
velopment [on the foothills). We
haven't done it in the past, and we
won't in the future."

But according to Eakins, preser
vation of the foothills has always been
a "bone of contention."
And Huber said it is likely to re
main an issue in the current negotia
tions for the University's new devel
opment plans.
For her part, Jacobs denied that
there was any attempt by the Univer
sity to spring a cancer center on un
suspecting council members.
According to Jacobs, planning for
the building began in earnest in 1994
and has been progressing steadily,
complying with development regula
tions since then. But she admitted
that everything about the building
was kept "really low-key."
"We wanted it to happen quietly,
without much fanfare," she said.
"I see [the cancer center] as a gift
to the city," Jacobs said.
"We were hoping that the com
munity would be part of the joy of this

project,"she said.
The wait goes on
Meanwhile, staff members at the
cancer clinics are making do.
Jacobs stops outside a consulta
tion room in the Radiation Oncology
Unit to discuss a patient's case with
another doctor. The buzzing of the
fluorescent lighting and the hum of
the escalators accompany their
muted conversation, as all around
them, people move up and down hall
ways, in and out of cramped
chemotherapy and radiation treat
ment rooms, some in hospital gowns,
some in lab coats.
They maneuver around stacks of
boxes filled with paperwork that just
haven't found a home yet. Tomor
row, the chairs that line both sides of
the hallway will be filled, because to
morrow is not a "light" day. Not like
today.
Wednesday is a light day at one of Stanford Hospi
tal's cancer treatment clinics. There used to he too many
patients on Wednesday, so the schedule was changed.
Still, the waiting room at the Radiation Oncology Unit
is full. On heavier days, patients have to sit on the floor

In the hall, too, is a small gurney covered with a flan

land, and development there is regu

lated by an agreement between the
University and the eounty called a
general-use permit, which sets a limit
on how many square feet of building
can be erected on county land. Stan
ford is expected to reach that limit at
some point in the next two years and
needs a new agreement.
Denice Dade, representative of
the Committee for Green F(X)thills, a
lobbying organization devoted to
conserving open space, said that
Stanford has traditionally enjoyed
tremendous freedom in its land-use
agreement with Santa Clara County
and that it is time for a change. She
hopes change will come as Stanford
negotiates with the county for the
new general-use permit. For Dade,
the issue was always about gtx)d plan
ning.
"The real issue is not the cancer
center," Dade said, 'it's working on
getting the county to have Stanford
do any long-range comprehensive
planning. They've never had to do
that. They've been given too much
freedom."
Dade is also critical of the way
Stanford introduces many of its de
velopment plans to both the city and
the county.
"Stanford has a tendency to create
emergencies," she said. "It's a way of
manipulating the community to get
what you want."
Some city council members
thought that Stanford's proposal to
build the cancer center was the latest
in a long line of "emergencies."
"When [Stanford] turns around
and says 'Cancer is important!' you
feel like you're being held hostage,"
Eakins said.
Stanford asks for trust
Coe disagrees that Stanford cre
ates emergencies. 11c said he wishes
that Stanford would get more credit
for its campus planning.
"We take planning very serious
ly," Coe said. "When we have a prob
lem. we identify it.and then we come
up with a solution. And we also get
criticized. Hut the fact is, we have pri
vate land resources, and we have the
ability to respond to crises."
Coe also said that Stanford does
engage in long-term land-use plan
ning. He referred to a document ti
tled "Land-Use Plan, 19S0-2010."
which designates how Stanford's land

should be used, as well as a document
he calls the "Tan Book" — a list of
proposed building plans from IWK to
2(KX). so named because of its brown
cover.
According to Coe, an additional
land-use plan was not a condition of
approval for the Sand Hill projects.
He also said the University is pre
vented from declaring any areas, in
cluding the foothills, open space be
cause of a stipulation in Stanford's
founding grant.
The grant says that all Stanford
lands must be held to support the aca
demic mission of the University —
and open space does not fit that defi
nition.
"That's where we want the com
munity to trust us," said Coe. "We
have a 1 (K)-year track record of no de
velopment [on the foothills). We
haven't done it in the past, and we
won't in the future."

But according to Eakins, preser
vation of the foothills has always been
a "bone of contention."
And Huber said it is likely to re
main an issue in the current negotia
tions for the University's new devel
opment plans.
For her part, Jacobs denied that
there was any attempt by the Univer
sity to spring a cancer center on un
suspecting council members.
According to Jacobs, planning for
the building began in earnest in 1994
and has been progressing steadily,
complying with development regula
tions since then. But she admitted
that everything about the building
was kept "really low-key."
"We wanted it to happen quietly,
without much fanfare," she said.
"I see [the cancer center] as a gift
to the city," Jacobs said.
"We were hoping that the com
munity would be part of the joy of this

project,"she said.
The wait goes on
Meanwhile, staff members at the
cancer clinics are making do.
Jacobs stops outside a consulta
tion room in the Radiation Oncology
Unit to discuss a patient's case with
another doctor. The buzzing of the
fluorescent lighting and the hum of
the escalators accompany their
muted conversation, as all around
them, people move up and down hall
ways, in and out of cramped
chemotherapy and radiation treat
ment rooms, some in hospital gowns,
some in lab coats.
They maneuver around stacks of
boxes filled with paperwork that just
haven't found a home yet. Tomor
row, the chairs that line both sides of
the hallway will be filled, because to
morrow is not a "light" day. Not like
today.
Wednesday is a light day at one of Stanford Hospi
tal's cancer treatment clinics. There used to he too many
patients on Wednesday, so the schedule was changed.
Still, the waiting room at the Radiation Oncology Unit
is full. On heavier days, patients have to sit on the floor
or on chairs lining the hallways.
In the hall, too, is a small gurney covered with a flan
nel baby blanket. On a heavy day, that's where a child
with leukemia might wait for treatment. Children share
the clinic with adults. And everyone — doctors,patients
and staff — shares two bathrooms too narrow to ac
commodate a wheelchair.
There are no windows in this world-renowned clinic,
located in the hospital's basement. There's only fluores
cent lighting and always the constant thrum of the esca
lator that carries you to the main floor and daylight.
"The doctors here could be making four times as
much money in private practice," said Charlotte Jacobs,
director of the Clinical Cancer Center, in a confidential
whisper. "But this is where they want to be."
v However where most of these doctors really want to
bb is in a building yet to be constructed —a $ 118 million
effiter that would gather all the hospital's cancer treat
ment facilities under one roof rather than spread over
three different buildings. The building plans are taped to
the back door of one of the offices in the Radiation On
cology Unit.
Bureaucratic stumbling blocks
But the Palo Alto City Council must approve the
plans, since the proposed site — now a parking lot be
tween the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital
and the Blake Wilbur Clinic — falls under jurisdiction
of the city.
In February, several council members indicated that
they would be unlikely to approve any new develop
ments on Stanford land within the city's jurisdiction —
including the cancer center- —unless the University
committed to a land — use plan that showed areas re
served for open space.
Since then, the University has embarked on a process
with the city and Santa Clara County to develop a new
general land-use plan, which is expected to be submitted
for an initial review in September of this year and com
pleted by November of 2(KK). There will be a seriesof fo
rums held over the summer, open to the public, to de
bate some aspects of the plan.
However, it is not yet clear how the plan will affect
the approval of the cancer center plans. According to
Andy Coe, director of community relations at Stanford,
the city wants to make sure that Stanford's land-use
plans are made public before it has to act on the cancer
center. That's not likely to happen, though, because the
erfvironmental impact report on the building proposal
has to be completed first. It is scheduled to be done by
the fall of this year.
"Our goal is that when we finally submit the land-use
plan, there will be strong support for it," said Coe. "The
cancer center will likely come before council in late 1999
or-early 2(XX), well after Stanford announces its long
term plans."
C ity council member Joe Huber,
who heads up an ad-hoc committee
formed to address development and
land preservation issues said that
some on the council will be more in
clined to approve the cancer center
proposal if Stanford comes up with an
acceptable guarantee for open space.
Other council members will be more
influenced by the big picture of the
University's overall development
plans for the campus.
"We wanted Stanford to get mov
ing on planning," Hubersaid.'i think
things are happening that we wanted
to happen under the ad-hoc commit
tee proposals."
Still, he added that there is "far
more support to pull in the reins [on
the cancer center proposal) than
some might think."
According to Huber. approval of
the cancer center is completely dis
cretionary because of the current
zoning restrictions on the proposed
location.
"There is no entitlement there,"
I luber said. "Council can say no, and
we don't have to have a reason to say
no lor that location. It's not that we
quarrel with the value of the project,
but there's got to be a limit. It is with
in our right to say to Stanford,
'You're going to have to go some
where else to do this — bless some
body else with your center.' "
Coe confirmed that the University
does need a zoning change in order
for the cancercenter project togo for
ward.
So for now at least, the situation

can best be summed up as "wait and
see."
Projected benefits
The new cancer treatment center
would be a 218,000-square-foot
building housing doctors' offices, pa
tient rooms, radiation and
chemotherapy units — everything
needed for total cancer care — to
gether.
Normally, all the different doctors
involved in the treatment of a cancer
patient work independently. Stan
ford would like to be a leader in what
Jacobs calls "integrative care." For
example, a patient with bone cancer
would be able to see a radiation on
cologist, a surgeon and a bone mar
row specialist in one place, making
treatment easier.
"Our current facilities are 20 to 30
years old," Jacobs said. "We've out
grown them in size and ability to sup
port the technology. You need more
space to take care of cancer patients
now than before."
Jacobs used the example of a radi
ation machine. Twenty years ago, a
patient could stand in front of a small
radiation machine, and it would pen
etrate the whole area being treated,
destroying healthy tissue along with
the cancer. Now, the radiation ma
chine rotates around patients and is
much better at preserving healthy tis
sue. Hut it's also a lot bigger.
Treatments such as radiation and
chemotherapy can now take as long
as four to eight hours a week, accord
ing to Jacobs. She thinks it is impor
tant for patients to have a pleasant en
vironment when they spend so much
of their time at the hospital.

"We're not talking about luxuries
but about basic humane needs," she
said.
Jacobs is understandably impa
tient to see the plans for the cancer
center become a reality, especially
now that most of the $50 million in
costs has been raised.
Hut for a while, she felt like she
was "living in the wrong moment in
time."
"After Sand Hill, people were
tired of talking about Stanford," Ja
cobs said.
"It was like, 'Enough, already,' "
she said, referring to Stanford pro
jects, approved by the Palo Alto City
Council in 1997, to widen and extend
Sand Hill Road down to El Camino
Real. Also included are plans to ex
pand Stanford Shopping Center by
KO,(XX) square feet and build a senior
citizens' apartment complex, as well
as 628 new apartments primarily for
employees of the University. Work
on the projects began in February.
According to city council member
Sandy Eakins, the Sand Hill projects
were approved on the understanding
that Stanford would draw up a land
use plan and share it with the city.
"It's not just about open space,
said Eakins in an interview in March
of this year. "It's about Stanford lay
ing the cards on the table."
Activists' concerns
Palo Alto only controls certain
parts of the Stanford campus — prin
cipally the area of the Stanford Shop
ping Center and parts of the hospital.
The central areas of campus are on
unincorporated Santa Clara County
land, and development there is regu

lated by an agreement between the
