# Waiting in line
## Cancer center fights for Palo Alto approval 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
Wednesday is a light day at one of Stanford Hospi
tal's cancer treatment clinics. There used to he too many
patients on Wednesday, so the schedule was changed.
Still, the waiting room at the Radiation Oncology Unit
is full. On heavier days, patients have to sit on the floor
or on chairs lining the hallways.
In the hall, too, is a small gurney covered with a flan
nel baby blanket. On a heavy day, that's where a child
with leukemia might wait for treatment. Children share
the clinic with adults. And everyone — doctors,patients
and staff — shares two bathrooms too narrow to ac
commodate a wheelchair.
There are no windows in this world-renowned clinic,
located in the hospital's basement. There's only fluores
cent lighting and always the constant thrum of the esca
lator that carries you to the main floor and daylight.
"The doctors here could be making four times as
much money in private practice," said Charlotte Jacobs,
director of the Clinical Cancer Center, in a confidential
whisper. "But this is where they want to be."
v However where most of these doctors really want to
bb is in a building yet to be constructed —a $ 118 million
effiter that would gather all the hospital's cancer treat
ment facilities under one roof rather than spread over
three different buildings. The building plans are taped to
the back door of one of the offices in the Radiation On
cology Unit.
Bureaucratic stumbling blocks
But the Palo Alto City Council must approve the
plans, since the proposed site — now a parking lot be
tween the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital
and the Blake Wilbur Clinic — falls under jurisdiction
of the city.
In February, several council members indicated that
they would be unlikely to approve any new develop
ments on Stanford land within the city's jurisdiction —
including the cancer center- —unless the University
committed to a land — use plan that showed areas re
served for open space.
Since then, the University has embarked on a process
with the city and Santa Clara County to develop a new
general land-use plan, which is expected to be submitted
for an initial review in September of this year and com
pleted by November of 2(KK). There will be a seriesof fo
rums held over the summer, open to the public, to de
bate some aspects of the plan.
However, it is not yet clear how the plan will affect
the approval of the cancer center plans. According to
Andy Coe, director of community relations at Stanford,
the city wants to make sure that Stanford's land-use
plans are made public before it has to act on the cancer
center. That's not likely to happen, though, because the
erfvironmental impact report on the building proposal
has to be completed first. It is scheduled to be done by
the fall of this year.
"Our goal is that when we finally submit the land-use
plan, there will be strong support for it," said Coe. "The
cancer center will likely come before council in late 1999
or-early 2(XX), well after Stanford announces its long
term plans."
