BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) —NATO bom
barded a wide swath of Yugoslavia yesterday, saying it
does not believe Slobodan Milosevic has begun with
drawing his forces from Kosovo. Five people were killed
and a senior official touring a fuel depot was wounded in
the allied attacks, Serb media said.
NATO said there was no evidence Yugoslavia had
withdrawn any ol the estimated 40,(XX) troops and special
police it had deployed in the Serbian province since
launching a crackdown in February. Some 750,(XX) ethnic
Albanians have been expelled since NATO airstrikes
began March 24.
"If it is a substantial withdrawal, 1 think it will be pret
t\ obvious," NATC) spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brus
sels. Belgium. "There will be plenty of dust on the track.

We will know it when we see it."
In Washington, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said NATO will accept nothing less than a total with
drawal of Milosevic's military and police forces from
Kosovo as part of its conditions to halt the air campaign.
Yugoslavia has given no hint of meeting the lull
NATO demands. The military said Monday that troops
in Kosovo would be reduced to "peacetime" levels — an
estimated 12,(KX) — when there is an agreement to
deploy a U.N. mission in the province.
Fighting inside Kosovo between Serb and ethnic
Albanian forces also continued, rebel sources said.
Three Kosovo Liberation Army fighters were killed and
20 injured by Yugoslavian warplane attacks in Kosovo,
the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
