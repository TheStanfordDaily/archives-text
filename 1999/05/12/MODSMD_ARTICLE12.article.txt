## Editorial The 						Wall's challenge 
### 
White Plaza wall is a
good start for serious,
open talk about race

HAVING OPEN, honest dis
cussions about race and eth
nicity is a difficult thing to do
because it requires a unique level of
commitment from participants.
The creation of a "wall" in White
Plaza where students can write their
responses to questions posed about
ethnicity and how to address it at
Stanford was a great idea and a long
time coming.
Leadership 2000, the coalition of
campus ethnic groups that coordinat
ed the wall's placement, has done its
part to incite meaningful dialogue.
I"he group will hold discussions in
dormitories after the wall is taken
down.
The members of Leadership 2000
have done their part; now it is time for
Stanford students to do theirs.
When pondering issues of race and
ethnicity, it is easy to offer glib
answers to age-old questions and sug
gest that we should all "just get
along."
If it were that easy to answer these
difficult questions, however, we as a
campus and a nation would not still be
working to grapple with them.
That said, it may seem futile to trv

to hold discussions on campus to con
sider issues of race and ethnicity. If no
one else has found solutions, how can
we?
But it is important that we all make
the commitment to think hard about
race and ethnicity and take the first
steps toward sorting out what is going
on in our heads and hearts.
Sure, solutions will take time. But
the first step in getting started is mak
ing the commitment to work on the
solutions, to really think about race
and all of its ramifications.
The wall and subsequent dorm dis
cussions can be part of this first step.
And for anyone who continues to
question the salience of race and eth
nicity for this nation, consider the
recent study in New Jersey showing
evidence that police officers were
more likely to arrest blacks in cars
they pulled over than whites. Consid
er the shooting of African immigrant
Amadou Diallo by police officers in
New York. Or, closer to home, con
sider the recent hunger strike over
ethnic studies and the arrest of over
SO students at UC-Berkeley last
week.
The wall in White Plaza and future
dorm discussions are only part of the
equation for addressing issues of race
and ethnicity. The other part involves
the commitment of students to partic
ipate in these activities with candor
and introspection.
