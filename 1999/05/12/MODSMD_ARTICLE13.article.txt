Rally for the Eating Clubs
The summer before my freshman year at
Stanford, I received much mail from the
University hut nothing more important
than the letter from Housing and Dining
Services telling me my fate: 1 was to live in a
two-room triple in Toyon Hall and eat my
meals at the Stanford Eating Clubs.
My freshman year was memorable, and
it would not have been nearly as enjoyable
without the Stanford Eating Clubs. In addi
tion to providing excellent food at scan
dalously low prices, the Eating Clubs pro
vide a legacy of community and tradition
(hat is unparalleled. Like many residents, I
was shocked to learn that the Stanford Eat
ing Clubs were founded in IW4 to provide
students with an alternative to the dining
monopoly of the University-sponsored food
provider. Over a century later, these Eating
Clubs provide not only an attractive alter
native to I Jniversity Dining Services but
also a friendly and fun social atmosphere
that fosters community, which is one of the
fundamental elements of Residential Edu
cation.
For my sophomore and junior years, I
have graced the halls of Roble Hall and
Lagunita Court; like Toyon, large four-class
dormitories but. unfortunately, without the
added bonus of the Stanford Eating Clubs.
In the past two years, my board bills have
been higher and my food choices much
more limited. The most inexpensive dining
hall option is 14 meals a week, which is
more than I need or care to have, and with
out open kitchen or the Eating Club's Ter
race option. I must eat when the dining halls

are open or my meals go to waste and I go
hungry.
Regardless of how flexible Dining Ser
vices claims to bo. I know that my frustra
tion with this monopoly is shared by dorm
residents all over campus.
Finally, I think it is important to note
that although residents of dormitories differ
from year to year, fqrmer and current
Toyon residents will always share the bond
of Stanford Eating Club membership. I
have returned for countless lunches, din
ners, TGIFs and special events like the
Luau and Eating Club Olympics, and I have
always been made to feel welcome.
Likewise, the Eating Club managers
have traditionally gone out of their way to
be hospitable to visitors and to provide a
friendly and inviting atmosphere for mem
bers and guests alike.
Although I no longer live in Toyon, it is
comforting to know that some students may
still enjoy the benefits of living in a large
dormitory, as well as the great food and
entertainment provided by the Stanford
Eating Clubs.
The future of the Stanford Eating Clubs
is uncertain, and I urge former and current
residents, and even those who have enjoyed
being guests, to speak up and express their
support for the preservation of this historic
eating establishment. The students have a
voice in this matter, and the University
needs to hear it.
Help save the Stanford Eating Clubs â€”
make your voice heard before it's too late.

Powwow coverage inadequate
Upon reading Monday's Daily, we were
disgusted at the minimal coverage you gave
to the 28th Annual Stanford Powwow. One
would think that such a large event, attend
ed by 3(),(XX) people, organized by a student
group and partially funded through ASSU
special fees, would receive at the very least
an article, if not a cover story.
The Powwow means different things to
different tribes. In the latter half of the cen
tury the Powwow has served in part to
honor Native American war veterans who
fought for the United States. In the process
of attending to this responsibility, the Stan
ford Powwow brought together tribes from
all over the country, as well as Canada.
Furthermore, on the occasion of Moth
er's Day, the Powwow formally honored the
role of motherhood, along with emphasiz
ing the importance of family and communi
ty.
By not covering this event, you denied
this cultural experience to the portion of the
student body that did not attend the Pow
wow.
As a student newspaper, it is your
responsibility to adequately cover major
events on campus. A three-day celebration
with a budget nearing $1(X),(X)0 and run by
students is surely worthy of your newsprint.

Study was misleading
The results of the study by Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais and Keith Light are sur
prising in more ways than one ("Surprising
findings on studying, sleep revealed in
study," yesterday's Daily). While the find
ings describe the sleep and study habits of
the selected sample group, the results seem
largely inaccurate for the larger undergrad
uate population. In my experience as a
chemistry major, 45 hours a week of aca
demics will result in failing out of school.
This past winter in Chemistry 174, many
of my classmates and I spent in excess of 25
hours a week working on lab reports alone,
not to mention problem sets, lecture and lab
section. Add to this three additional classes
and the total dwarfs the supposed 45-hour
average.
Many of my friends in biology, physics
and engineering spend comparable
amounts of time on academics. Such a low
average would suppose a large number of
students spending substantially less than 45
hours a week which, despite erroneous
stereotypes of the ease of fuzzy majors,
seems highly unlikely.
For the same reason, Wais' statement
that the study "shows that Stanford students
are not sleep deprived" is invalid. I'd be
lucky to average five hours, and I am certain
other students agree. Even the survey sug
gests sleep deprivation since the average
seven hours of sleep is below the eight to 10
hours needed by most people.
Perhaps this discrepancy may be
