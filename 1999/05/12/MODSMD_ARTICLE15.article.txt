# Sprinkle cool patience
## Atiba Pertilla Charity begins right next door 
### 
IT TOOK ONLY four
months after gradua
tion for the letter from
my high school to catch up
with me at Stanford, urging
me, as a "treasured alum
nus," to give back to the
school where I had spent

my adolescent years.
The letters have become a slow, steady
trickle in the years since, and I have to admit
that only a few weeks ago I finally capitulat
ed to the guilt trip, just as 1 ended up giving
in to the entreaties of the Senior Gift cam
paign back in December in order to spare
myself months of friendly harassment.
It may be fashionable to gripe that Stan
ford, having already provided us with a six
figure education, has some nerve to ask for
even more before we've even received the
diploma that will allow us to lay claim to the
name we paid for. However, most of us will
probably end up giving money eventually,
which is as it should be.
But philanthropy — the old-fashioned,
check-writing kind — is an idea which only
rarely flits through the minds of most college
students. In times past, groups like the Junior
League and the Links threw fabulous parties
for their friends and, as a by-product, man
aged to raise hefty donations for worthy
causes.
Nowadays, when a house for a poor fam
ily needs to get built, it's much more chic to
go out there and wield the hammer yourself
rather than pay the way for construction
workers to do the job. In my stint as my

house's community service rep, this led to a
particularly unedifying afternoon of scraping
gum off of dining tables at a homeless shelter
last year. Sure, we may not have been
experts, but at least we were out there help
ing in a way which seemed tangible.
There's nothing wrong, per se, with such
bursts of community service, but at this point
of our lives they're more likely to lead to
ennui than enthusiasm. Many people find
themselves shying away from these opportu
nities — maybe volunteering takes too much
time away from finishing that problem set or
maybe it's a nice day outside, and you'd
rather be playing ultimate. Sure, you'd like to
help, but your time is much too precious.
What's a kind-hearted soul to do?
In situations like this, the answer may
very well be cold, hard cash. Though those of
you with a long-standing devotion to going
into the community and giving of yourself on
a one-to-one basis might feel as though this is
a betrayal of your ideals, it's probably not
such a bad idea to start learning to hit your
friends up for money. Rest assured that, if
you teel squeamish about betraying your
principles, there are many organizations out
there that feel none of the same qualms
about asking people not for their time or
their good wishes but simply for their money
(or stocks or property).
Indeed, every quarter Stanford trains a
new generation of these chipper extortionists
in the Encina trailers. Hut institutions like
Stanford have the resources to mobilize huge
staffs and organize mailing schedules in
order to achieve maximal yield for their

efforts. One philanthropy expert I spoke to
explained that many people never give sim
ply because they're never asked.
But just as important is who's doing the
asking. When large institutions are able to
mobilize their resources to gain the attention
of the charitably minded more quickly, that
money is likely to get caught in a self-reflex
ive cycle that only benefits a certain stratum
of society — much as Stanford's ability to
count on alumni donations will probably
ease the way for your kids when they're try
ing to decide where to head for college.
That small grassroots group you're work
ing for probably doesn't have the same pub
licity machine that helps the non-profit
heavyweights raise their annual budgets. So
if you really care about that cause, maybe
now is the time to make your friends aware
of what they can do to help, even if it doesn't
mean anything as proactive as ladling soup at
a shelter but rather simply dropping money
into a jar on your desk. (You can wean them
into $25-a-head dinners later.) Most people,
the expert added, give because they want to
feel good about what they choose to do with
their money.
Asking for support early on may not be as
romantic as allowing your favorite charity to
remain mired in blameless poverty, but those
you hope to help will thank you — and so
will your friends.

Atiba Pertilla, a senior majoring in history,
would like to thank his mother for her
"expert" testimony, among countless other
things.
