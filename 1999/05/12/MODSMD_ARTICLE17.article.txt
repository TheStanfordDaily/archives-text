## Watching TV linked to weight gain in children 
### Susanna Fryer 
Parents now have a new reason to pull their
children away from the TV set. Though Mom's
claims ahout television rotting your brain may
he exaggerated, a Stanford researcher has
found that reduced TV watching can prevent
excess weight gain in children.
According to a recent study by Asst. Pedi
atrics Prof. Thomas N. Robinson, children who
participated in a year-long program designed to
curb time in front of the television gained sig
nificantly less body fat than a control group of
their peers who were given no such instruction.
Preventing excess weight gain has become
an important pediatric health concern. Ameri
can children are increasingly threatened by
obesity.
Rates of childhood obesity have more than
doubled during the past 20 years. According to
the American Heart Association, this is a dan
gerous trend as obese children are more likely
to become obese adults, who suffer a higher
risk of developing heart disease and other life
threatening complications.
The average American child spends four
hours a day in front of a screen watching televi
sion. videos or playing video games. For this
typical child, time in front of the television is
surpassed only by time spent sleeping.
It seems intuitive that this TV habit cannot
be healthy for our nation's children, and
indeed, television is often implicated as a cause
of excess weight gain. I lowever, scientific stud
ies seeking an epidemiological relationship

between weight and TV watching have failed to
produce a definite link between the two factors.
Robinson's study, though, has found a sig
nificant relationship between television and
weight gain in children, suggesting that as TV
time is reduced, excess weight gain decreases as
well. Part of the explanation for why this study
differs from those that preceded it lies in
Robinson's novel approach.
Traditional studies have focused on simply
correlating TV viewing to body weight in chil
dren, whereas Robinson attempted to reduce
TV viewing time and measure the direct effect
that this reduction had on weight gain in school
children.
"One of the things that makes this study
unique was that it focused specifically on reduc
ing TV, videotape and video game viewing
without promoting any other activities as sub
stitutes," Robinson explained. "As a result, we
were able to isolate the effects of these media
alone."
The subjects for Robinson's study were 192
third and fourth graders from two elementary
schools in San Jose. Television reduction
lessons were given to students at one of the two
schools. These lessons involved children keep
ing track of their TV habits, going without tele
vision for periods of time and becoming more
selective viewers while limiting overall TV
viewing. Ultimately, the children at the school
involved in the TV reduction program
decreased their TV watching by about one
third to one-fourth of pre-study levels.
Robinson, meanwhile, monitored the health

of students at both schools. "We were collect
ing data on weight, physical fitness, physical
activity, diet, aggressive behavior, reading and
school performance, and how children spent
their time during the course of the day,"he
said.
At the beginning of the school year, the chil
dren at each school were reported to watch
comparable amounts of television and had sim
ilar body fat profiles. Additionally, the students
at the two schools did not differ in high-lat food
consumption, exercise or physical activity.
However, over the course of the school year,
the study showed that children who watched
less television experienced a smaller increase in
waist size, waist-to-hip ratio and body mass
index. On average, these children gained near
ly two pounds less than the control group.
Robinson offered two possible explanations
to account for the reduced weight gain in the
students who watched less television. It could
be that these students were performing more
low-level activities during the time that they
normally would have been immobile in front of
a television. The difference could also be relat
ed to the reduced number of meals that these
children ate in front of the television. Either
way. Robinson's findings provide a key to pre
venting excessive weight gain in children: less
time in front of the television.
Robinson has received a grant from the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to
conduct a more comprehensive study of the
same nature with 900 students from 12 elemen
tary schools.
