## Science bug puzzles over the long lives of tortoises 
### Garth Patil Contributing writer 
(J: I recently had (he privilege of
visiting the (ialapagos Islands and
seeing the giant tortoises there. It is
said that many of these tortoises
live to he well over 1(H) years old.
How do tortoises live to he so old?
And does it have anything to do
with moving so slowly?
\: I must admit that I am envious
of your recent excursion to the
Galapagos to see the giant tortois
es. That is an expedition this hug
lias long fantasized about but never
been able to realize. Because of
excessive poaching and the intro
duction of non-indigenous live
stock to the (ialapagos, the giant
tortoise has been pushed to the
brink of extinction. Now only
15.0(H) of the animals in II sub
species still exist.
Very little is known about the
giant tortoise of the (ialapagos.
even though study of them began in
the 1830s when famed naturalist
Charles Darwin observed the
unique beasts on a research voyage
to the (ialapagos.
Darwin returned to London with
a tortoise after completing his
research on the islands. That giant
tortoise not only out-lived Darwin
but is currently living out what sci
entists believe to be her 168 th year
in a zoo in Gold Coast, Australia.
That's right, still alive and kicking.
Whoever said you couldn't meet
someone who knew Darwin?
I suppose you now think the bug
is going to lay it all on the line and
reveal the secrets of aging. The
truth is. whether it's humans, turtles
or single-cell organisms, the jury is
still out on why and how aging
occurs and why some organisms live
longer than others do. The most
that is sure is that the cause of aging
is complex and due to many factors.
However, for your sake, I'm not
going to give up there. There are
several theories that lend insight
into reasons the giant tortoises of
the Galapagos might live so long.
It is thought that metabolism
plays a significant role in aging.
Organisms with slower
metabolisms are thought to have
longer life spans because of lower
cell division rates that decrease the
likelihood that genetic and age
related diseases will surface. Tor
toises arc known to have very slow
metabolisms, which contribute to

their slow movement.
Also, organisms that continue to
grow throughout their lives are
thought to live longer. Giant tor
toises engage in a slow but constant
growth process that doesn't end
until they die.
Specifically, Galapagos giant tor
toises have a unique advantage over
other giant tortoises, because they
have no natural predators. Galapa
gos tortoises are not an indigenous
species.
It is theorized that several thou
sand years ago, a giant tortoise,
probably pregnant, floated across
the ocean to the Galapagos. Find
ing no natural enemies and an
abundant food supply in the isolat
ed island ecosystem, the giant tor
toise thrived (reaching a population
of several hundred thousand) and
eventually differentiated into over
20 subspecies.
Tortoises in general also have
traits that would suggest a longer
life span. A hard shell that covers
most land tortoises probably leads
to a lower threat of predation. So,
like the tortoises of the Galapagos,
all tortoises have fewer predators
that can actually make a significant
dent in the population.
While the lack of predation

shows why average life expectancy
is higher in tortoises, it is less clear
how each individual animal lives to
be so old. I'his is an area where
research hasn't defined the subject
as well and speculation is the best
answer we have.
One hypothetical explanation
might be that if there were a genet
ic trait that promoted longevity in
an organism, and that trait had a
better chance of affecting the aging
process as the organism got older,
then species with low predation,
which live longer, would be more
likely to pass on that trait.
To put it in simpler terms: You
(a giant tortoise) land on an island
where you have no natural enemies.
There is an abundance of resources
necessary for your sustenance that
won't run out. You decide to stay a
while. You adopt a slower, calmer
way of life, which you pass on to
your offspring. Assuming that a
longer life is a desirable trait (which
is also unclear), generations pass on
that trait and the eventual result is
longer and longer life spans.
While this isn't a definitive
answer, it seems to me a great rea
son for the rest of us to take some
stress away, slow down and take
time to smell the flowers.
