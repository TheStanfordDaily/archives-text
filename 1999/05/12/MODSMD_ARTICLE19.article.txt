# Tree frogs sprout extra legs and deformed limbs
## Parasite implicated for frog diseases 
### Cindy Lin Contributing writer 
Missing, malformed and extra limbs distinguish the
puzzling cases of frog deformities which have been
appearing at an alarming rate in the past decade in the
western United States.
Research conducted by Pieler Johnson, Class of '98.
pinpoints a parasite as one cause of these severe defor
mities in frogs.
"This was the first study to isolate the cause of frog
deformities in the wild," Johnson said. "While many
causes have been proposed, we found that parasites are
sufficient to explain deformities in these frogs."
Johnson identified that the parasitic flatworm,
Ribeiroia, causes limb deformities in Pacific treefrogs,
Hyla regillu, found throughout the western United
States. Between 199 band 1998, Johnson and other
researchers surveyed 35 ponds in Santa Clara County
and noted severe limb abnormalities in ltogs from four
of the 13 ponds.
"This parasite has been known since the 19305, but
before, it was only described as existing in fish," Johnson
said. "It was not known until recently that the parasite
causes these deformities in amphibians."
According to Johnson, in fish, the parasite affects the
lateral line canal, which helps fish keep their sense of
equilibrium, so afflicted fish are less able to swim and
see approaching predators. Similarly, in amphibians,
the parasite selectively targets the limbs of frogs so that
their ability to jump or swim is impaired.
The debilitation that Ribeiroia causes in frogs points
to the importance of the involvement of the frog as a
host for this parasite. In the life cycle of this parasite, it
is hosted by species of snails, fish, amphibians and birds.
According to Johnson, from an evolutionary standpoint,
the parasite was naturally selected to afflict the frog in
this way to complete its own life cycle.
"The parasite has to get into the bird for its lifecycle
to be complete," Johnson said. "In an anthropomorphic
sense, the parasite wants the frog to get eaten by a bird."
Parasites were found to localize around the
hindlimbs, pelvic girdle and close to abnormal or extra
limbs. "Because hindlimh development in amphibians is
exposed to external factors in the water, they are prone
to disturbance of the growth pathways, either mechani
cally or chemically," said Euan Ritchie, a professor from
James Cook University of North Queensland, Aus
tralia, who contributed to the study.
To test the hypothesis that parasite infection is
responsible for the limb abnormalities observed in H.
regilla, Johnson collected H. regilla egg masses from the
Eel River in California, a site with no known records of
abnormal frogs. The tadpoles were exposed to high den
sities of the parasite Ribeiroia or Alarm, another para
site originally suspected to be causing limb deformities.
"In the control group, 88 percent of the tadpoles sur
vived, and all survivors were normal," Johnson wrote.
"Only 4() percent of the tadpoles in heavy treatment [of
Ribeiroia] survived to metamorphosis and 1(X) percent
of those developed limb abnormalities. Alaria cercariae
penetrated tadpoles but caused neither limb abnormali
ties nor an increase in mortality, even at a greater densi
ty than that used in the heavy Ribeiroia treatment."
Johnson makes the distinction that parasites are bio
logical reagents, which make them different from natu
ral reagents such as UV-radiation from the sun. While

water tests of the afflicted ponds did not detect an
abnormal presence of pesticides, PCBs or heavy metals,
according to Ritchie, this does not indicate that humans
are entirely unrelated to the cause of frog deformities.
"It [a human factor] is yet to be proven; however, it
is likely," Ritchie Said. "Amphibians are at a disadvan
tage due to their susceptibility to environmental pollu
tants which are prone to accumulating in waterways."
These pollutants, such as fertilizers, add nutrients to the
water, which causes eutrophication, increasing the snail
populations that serve as hosts for the parasites.
"Even if studies clear humans of causing frog abnor
malities, complacency on our part would be highly irre
sponsible," Ritchie said. "Aquatic systems are often
complex, with many factors interacting with each other,
and hence, it is very difficult to say what effect humans
are having."
Johnson, now based at Garemont McKenna Col
lege, said he will be visiting 50 to 60 sites across Califor
nia, Oregon, Montana, Washington, Colorado and
Idaho to collect data this summer.
"We want to go back to see if there is an underlying
human source to the problem and see if there is indica
tion of a human correlation," Johnson said. Because the
Hyla regilla frogs are not found in the Midwest, Johnson
is also interested in exploring how different phenotypes
of frogs from different areas react to parasites.
Ritchie stressed the importance of not assuming that
all frog deformities are caused by parasites.
"If I was to say one thing from this research it would
be 'don't assume anything!'" Ritchie said. "Although
we have shown parasites to be the cause in this case, it
does not rule out other causes. Further work is needed
before we can be confident of understanding what is
happening to frog populations worldwide."
