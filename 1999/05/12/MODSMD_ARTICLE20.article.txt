## Three juniors, sophomore add depth and strength to Stanford sailing for women and coeds Female sailors pull more than their weight 
### Becky Blanchard Contributing writer 
Listen to playground trash talk
and it's likely you'll hear a player
shamed with "You play like a girl!"
But try to taunt members of the
Stanford sailing team with "You sail
like a girl," and you'll likely get a
very different reaction.
That's because this year's squad
has been uniquely female-dominat
ed. Women skippers not only lead
the women's team to the national re
gatta, but also play a large role in the
Cardinal's success on the coed side.
Skippers junior Anika Leerssen
and sophomore Heather Porter and
their respective crews, juniors Alex
is Krivkovich and Katie Gregg, have
proven this season that they can
compete against the best men and
women in college sailing.
"We expect our women to com
pete straight-up with everyone on

the team." head coach Steve Bour
dowsaid. " The disadvantage that ex
ists [for women] is really psychologi
cal. In our district, in our boats
there's no reason why they can't
compete straight-up with anyone."
According to Krivkovich, the
number of female skippers in college
sailing has risen steadily in past years,
and their visibility in coed events has
increased even in the last year.
In his tenure at Stanford. Bour
dow has always emphasized equal
competition. Yet despite the strong
example set last year by Cardinal
teamracer Alice Manard, the promi
nent dual role that Leerssen and
Porter have played this season is his
toric for the Cardinal program, ac
cording to Bourdow.
In a rebuilding year, Leerssen
and Porter joined skippers Tyler
Doyle, a junior, and sophomore Jeff
Condon to fill spaces left open by a
strong class of graduates, including

All-Americans Dan Zimbaldi and
John Meade. According to Bour
dow. Leerssen and Porter's talent
and competitiveness have chal
lenged their teammates to become
better sailors and allowed Stanford
to simulate racing conditions that
other teams don't have the depth to
practice.
Leerssen, Porter and Krivkovich
agree the experience and confidence
they have gained racing in both coed
and women's regattas has helped
them to improve as individual
sailors.
"Being on both teams has given
me a really good perspective on sail
ing. You face different competition
on the water in women's and coed
races," Krivkovich said. "It gives you
a different understanding."
All four sailors came to the Stan
ford program from vastly different
backgrounds, hut have combined to
form two of the Cardinal's top boats.

Porter came out of a strong
Southern California high school pro
gram with a solid preparation for
college sailing. A double-handed
sailor, she specializes in sailing in
lighter air and has good boat-han
dling skills and speed in flatwater
conditions. However, at 5 foot 4,
Porter is dependent on synchroniza
tion with her crew in order to be suc
cessful.
"She came in with a lot of talent,"
Bourdow said. "But she's a smaller
person. That puts her at a disadvan
tage when the wind comes up. She
really has to work together with her
crew."
Gregg, in her third year on the
team, started out with only recre
ational racing experience. After
quickly learning to sail Flying Ju
niors — the most popular class of
boats in West Coast sailing — with
the team, she was paired with Porter,
which allowed her to have more re

sponsibility and play a larger role on
the boat.
"This is the first year that she has
really figured out how enjoyable it is
to create a two-person team," Bour
dow said. "She's really starting to re
alize how much better a sailor she
can make her skipper."
Bourdow describes Leerssen as
"a Newport rock star." Hailing from
Rhode Island's sailing scene,
Leerssen entered Stanford with the
1996 Youth World Championship
and plenty of experience already
under her belt. She has been sailing
at the national level since she was 12
years old.
A single-handed sailor, her
height and strength put her at no
physical disadvantage when sailing
against male skippers. According to
Bourdow, Leerssen can compete
with anyone when sailing in heavy
winds.
"She is very strong and very as
sertive," Bourdow said. "She's been
on the small slope of the learning
curve for awhile now."
Krivkovich. the smallest crew on
the Stanford team, seemed a natural
match for Leerssen. She began colle
giate sailing with a lot of experience
from racing around the Chicago
area. She and Leerssen have been
very successful in their two-year
pairing.
"Alexis is starting to learn that
she makes Anika a much better col
lege sailor than she could be with
anyone else," Bourdow said.
"[Anika] will go on and continue to
sail at a high level and be very suc
cessful. She's really talented, but in
college races, Alexis makes her able
to do it."
Although Stanford's coed teams
failed to win a national berth, these
women will join teammates Taylor
Robinson and Sally Madsen in the
women's national dinghy champi
onship in St. Petersburg, Fla., May
26-28. They hope to improve upon
last year's 12th-place finish and win
one of the top five places.
With the increased numbers and
success of female skippers in coed
events, sailors and fans contemplate
the future elimination of women's
events from collegiate sailing. Al
though Bourdow believes that
someday female and male skippers
should compete against one another


Carissa Zenorinin — Daily
Juniors Katie Gregg, Anika Leerssen and Alexis Krikovich, along with sophomore Heather Porter, come together to create two solid racing
boats for the Stanford sailing team. The two skipper-crew pairs contribute greatly to both the women's and coed teams.
equally in coed events, some of the
team members are hesitant to advo
cate the consolidation of events.
"I think a lot of women's sailors
would become really discouraged
and the number of women skippers
would decrease," Porter said.
"Women's sailing would get pushed
to the side."

Remembering the "glass ceiling
of sailing" of the 1980s, Leerssen
said opportunities for women exist
more now than ever. With strong ju
nior programs for female skippers
and women's events such as the
Olympics and the Rolex keel boat
regatta, the competitiveness of
women's sailing continues to grow.
"I don't think anybody's out
there anymore who thinks women's
sailing is a joke," said Leerssen.
"Things have definitely changed."
