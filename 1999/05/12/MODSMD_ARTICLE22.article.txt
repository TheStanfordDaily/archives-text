# Cardinal blows by Broncos
## 
### Jonathan Stull Senior staff writer 
In its last tuneup game before its
last conference series of the season,
sixth-ranked Stanford (38-12)
played the last-place team in the
West Coast Conference's West Di
vision.
What resulted in the Cardinal's
last game of the season with Santa
Clara (19-34) was a contest many
might wish was the last college base
ball game ever played.

■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford (37-12
overall) 12, Santa Clara 5.

In truth, the 12-5 Stanford victo
ry was not that poor a display of
baseball.
However, four errors, nine
walks, six wild pitches, a few bob
bled grounders and misplayed fly
balls and one or two glaring mental
errors would make any baseball
purist cringe.
"It was a little sloppy," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess said.
"There weren't a lot of errors —
only two each team — but they
came at critical times."
Two Stanford errors led to four
Santa Clara runs in the top of the
sixth: five walks and a botched in
ning-ending ground ball helped the
Cardinal to seven runs in the bot
tom frame.
However, heading into its week
end series at UCLA, in which the
Cardinal could clinch the Pacific 10
Conference championship, Stan
ford wished to concentrate on the
good side of the game — its come
back from a 5-1 deficit in the sixth
inning.
"1 think we were just a little bit
dead in the first couple innings," se
nior third baseman Josh Hochge
sang said. "The intensity wasn't
there.
"But this team is just 'never say
die.' We know that if we give it a full
nine innings, we're going to get our
hits soon enough. Things are going
to start happening."
