# Cardinal blows by Broncos
## 
### Jonathan Stull Senior staff writer 
In its last tuneup game before its
last conference series of the season,
sixth-ranked Stanford (38-12)
played the last-place team in the
West Coast Conference's West Di
vision.
What resulted in the Cardinal's
last game of the season with Santa
Clara (19-34) was a contest many
might wish was the last college base
ball game ever played.

■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford (37-12
overall) 12, Santa Clara 5.

In truth, the 12-5 Stanford victo
ry was not that poor a display of
baseball.
However, four errors, nine
walks, six wild pitches, a few bob
bled grounders and misplayed fly
balls and one or two glaring mental
errors would make any baseball
purist cringe.
"It was a little sloppy," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess said.
"There weren't a lot of errors —
only two each team — but they
came at critical times."
Two Stanford errors led to four
Santa Clara runs in the top of the
sixth: five walks and a botched in
ning-ending ground ball helped the
Cardinal to seven runs in the bot
tom frame.
However, heading into its week
end series at UCLA, in which the
Cardinal could clinch the Pacific 10
Conference championship, Stan
ford wished to concentrate on the
good side of the game — its come
back from a 5-1 deficit in the sixth
inning.
"1 think we were just a little bit
dead in the first couple innings," se
nior third baseman Josh Hochge
sang said. "The intensity wasn't
there.
"But this team is just 'never say
die.' We know that if we give it a full
nine innings, we're going to get our
hits soon enough. Things are going
to start happening."
And, for the last eleven games, all
of which Stanford has won, things
have been happening for the Cardi
nal.
As the season closes, with just six
regular season games left, Stanford
is riding its hottest streak of the year.
"Whether we start off taking it
right to the team from the beginning
or if they get the lead and we have to
come back, we're just doing a good
job of finding a way to win," Hochge
sang said.
"I've been here four years and
this team is one of the best at giving
ourselves a chance and not getting
too caught up in anything else. We
just go out there and play."
That attitude has been especially
important of late as Stanford has
been facing a string of overmatched

nonconference opponents.
"I think we take everything in
stride, playing these type of games,"
said junior first baseman John Gall,
who went 3 for 4 with an RBI.
"Other than [Nevada], we've been
playing some teams who have been
struggling.
"But UCLA, that's going to be
more like a playoff atmosphere."
And in the playoffs, pitching mat
ters. Remembering that, Marquess
again went deep into his bullpen last
night, throwing six pitchers onto the
mound.
Freshman Mike Wodnicki made
a solid start. In three innings, the
right-hander struck out two while al
lowing no runs on three hits.
Senior Tony Cogan looks as if he,
too, is heating up for the stretch run.
The left-hander made quick work of
the Broncos in the last two innings,
giving up no hits or runs while
recording four strikeouts.
