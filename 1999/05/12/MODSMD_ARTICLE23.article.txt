# Final weekend in Pac-10 bonanza
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
It is a schedule-maker's dream.
No, not the tacky tapestry of
non-league games the Stanford
baseball team just completed.
But rather, the last weekend of
Pacific 10 Conference baseball ac
tion that starts Friday.
For all the complaints the re
formed Pac-10 has received, it has
led up to quite an interesting week
end in league action — six teams
fighting for their postseason lives,
all playing each other.
And with this year's postseason
tournament expanded to 64 teams
with an extra round of games
added, there is reason to believe
more teams from the Pac-10 will
enter postseason play.
"I think six teams should get in,
hut I'm not the guy making the de
cision," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "There are six
teams that are in the best 64 in the
country, probably more."
Before any teams make plans to
play beyond the regular season,
however, there are still a few issues
yet to be decided — the conference
title being foremost, especially for
Stanford (37-12, 17-4 Pac-10),
which holds a two-game lead on No.
16 USC (31-22.15-6).
The focus of this weekend's ac

tion will be in Los Angeles, where
four of the six teams elbowing for
postseason places will slug it out.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal will face
UCLA, which after a recent hot
streak is sitting alone in third place
in the conference at 12-9, albeit only
28-27 overall.
With barely a .500 record and an
unimpressive schedule, the young
Bruin squad would need an incredi
ble showing against the Cardinal —
like say, a sweep — to impress the
NCAA selection committee.
"The only team I would think
might be on the bubble is UCLA,
and they might be the best team in
the conference right now," Mar
quess said. "They've got a lot of in
centive going into this weekend. If
they win two they're probably as
sured of finishing over .500 and
they're probably in. They'll be
ready to play."
A sweep would be exactly what
USC would like to have happen, es
pecially if the Trojans do the same
in their home series against Wash
ington (30-18, 11-10). Not only
would that clinch the Pac-10 title for
the Trojans, it would also give them
one of the 29 automatic tournament
berths given out to conference win
ners. Washington, on the other
hand, would like to have a strong
showing at Dedeaux Field in order
to — with a little help from Stanford
leapfrog IJCLA for third place
and assure itself of a postseason
spot.
The final piece of this puzzle is
out in Tempe, Ariz., where 25th
ranked Arizona State (38-1 y, 11-10)
plays host to Arizona (31 -20,11-10).
Both find themselves tied for fourth
with Washington, and both were

victims of a Stanford sweep earlier
in the season. As impressive as the
Sun Devils' record looks at first
glance, a closer look reveals that a
lot of the wins came against baseball
"powerhouses" such as Utah,
Howard, Grand Canyon and
Boston College. Also, Arizona
State's record against the top three
teams in the Pac-10 is only 1-8.
Still, taking two out of three from
the Wildcats should be enough to
break away from the pack and join
its ranked Pac-10 brethren in the
postseason.

Speaking of postseason, the
NCAA is trotting out a new format
that will incorporate more teams
and will have some teams playing
well into June. Instead of having
eight six-team, double-elimination
regional sites (with the winners ad
vancing to the College World Se
ries), there will be 16 four-team dou
ble-elimination regionals starting
two weeks from Friday. The win
ners will then advance to play each
other in eight best-of-three super
regionals to determine this year's
College World Series participants.
"I think the best thing for college
baseball is the new format," Mar
quess said. "1 think that's huge be
cause there's more regional sites.
What I don't like is the four-team re
gional in three days, which is ridicu
lous.
"First day, two teams lose, two

teams win. The two teams that are
undefeated play that second day.
The team that loses has to play that
night. And if they win that one,
they've got to win a doubleheader
the next day. So if you lose one of
the first two games, you have to win
three games in 24 hours. What's the
hurry? That's crazy, and that's what
they've got to change."
With more regional sites avail
able, Stanford should be safely in
line to host a regional for the fourth
consecutive year. And while the
new format is not completely satis
factory, the postseason concerns re
main the same: Run into a hot pitch
er, and you could be gone before
you even get comfortable.
But first, some Pac-10 squads
need to play out the rest of their
schedule to see if they will even have
to worry abou that.

N0.6 Stanford will play its last weekend of Pacific 10 Conference
baseball this weekend. The Cardinal is in good standing — two
games ahead of second place USC — to take the conference title.
