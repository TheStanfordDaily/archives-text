# Final weekend in Pac-10 bonanza
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
It is a schedule-maker's dream.
No, not the tacky tapestry of
non-league games the Stanford
baseball team just completed.
But rather, the last weekend of
Pacific 10 Conference baseball ac
tion that starts Friday.
For all the complaints the re
formed Pac-10 has received, it has
led up to quite an interesting week
end in league action — six teams
fighting for their postseason lives,
all playing each other.
And with this year's postseason
tournament expanded to 64 teams
with an extra round of games
added, there is reason to believe
more teams from the Pac-10 will
enter postseason play.
"I think six teams should get in,
hut I'm not the guy making the de
cision," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "There are six
teams that are in the best 64 in the
country, probably more."
Before any teams make plans to
play beyond the regular season,
however, there are still a few issues
yet to be decided — the conference
title being foremost, especially for
Stanford (37-12, 17-4 Pac-10),
which holds a two-game lead on No.
16 USC (31-22.15-6).
The focus of this weekend's ac

tion will be in Los Angeles, where
four of the six teams elbowing for
postseason places will slug it out.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal will face
UCLA, which after a recent hot
streak is sitting alone in third place
in the conference at 12-9, albeit only
28-27 overall.
With barely a .500 record and an
unimpressive schedule, the young
Bruin squad would need an incredi
ble showing against the Cardinal —
like say, a sweep — to impress the
NCAA selection committee.
"The only team I would think
might be on the bubble is UCLA,
and they might be the best team in
the conference right now," Mar
quess said. "They've got a lot of in
centive going into this weekend. If
they win two they're probably as
sured of finishing over .500 and
they're probably in. They'll be
ready to play."
A sweep would be exactly what
USC would like to have happen, es
pecially if the Trojans do the same
in their home series against Wash
ington (30-18, 11-10). Not only
would that clinch the Pac-10 title for
the Trojans, it would also give them
one of the 29 automatic tournament
berths given out to conference win
ners. Washington, on the other
hand, would like to have a strong
