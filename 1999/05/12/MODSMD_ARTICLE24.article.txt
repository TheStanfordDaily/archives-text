# New computer warnings in place
## Stanford takes new messures to secure Leland accounts 
### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
Computer hackers beware. The University has
been stepping up efforts to fight off hackers who at
tempt to steal the passwords of Leland system
users.
Incidents of password stealing at Stanford have
been rising recently.
"We probably find a sniffer on the average of
one or two a day," said Stephen Hansen, the Uni
versity's computer security officer.
Many people telneting into their Leland system
accounts have probably noticed a message reading,
"Warning: This session is not secure: your pass
word is at risk." This message appears when the
user has not installed Kerberos protection software
to protect his or her password from computer hack
ers.
When the message is presented, users are given
the link to a Stanford University Web site explain
ing the warning. The site says that during a telnet
session, users are sending their passwords over in
secure phone lines. Unscrambled passwords can be
stolen by hackers.
University policy dictates harsh punishments

for password thieves. Stanford's Computer and
Network Usage Policy dietates "sniffers" will be
subject to "disciplinary action up to and including
discharge, dismissal, expulsion and/or legal ac
tion."
According to Hansen, most of these hackers
tend to be high school students. Often, hackers are
simply looking to "hide their tracks when they're
being obnoxious on" the Internet.
According to Hansen, the worst thing password
stealers can accomplish is deleting all of the victim's
files.
"We had a grad student who lost everything,"
Hansen said. It is impossible to put a dollar figure
on such a loss, but Hansen said, "figure what two
quarters of Stanford tuition is worth."
Once someone steals your password, "they are
you," Hansen said.
"We've been trying to tell people" about the im
portance of Kerberos protection, but "there's still a
fairly large segment of the community that is log
ging in an insecure fashion," he said.
Stanford provides software that can help Le
land system users protect their telnet sessions from
hackers. This software uses Kerberos security to
encrypt a user's password, so it does not travel over

the network in a readable fashion.
By visiting http://www.stanlord.edu/ group/itss
ccs/security//leland-warning.html and installing
MaeLeland or PC-Leland,Leland system users can
ensure that their passwords will not fall prey to
hackers.
According to Dennis Michael, manager of the
Leland system, the Kerheros protection software is
not complicated, takes a few minutes to install and
is easy to use.
Michael emphasized the importance of in
stalling the software, since if a hacker steals a pass
word, he or she can "read your mail, look at your
files, or use your account for other purposes,"
Michael said.
Dragomir Angelov, Lambda Nu resident com
puter consultant, agrees that installing the Ker
beros protection programs are well worth the ef
fort. Installing the programs is "self-explanatory
and very easy," Angelov said.
"All RCCs are supposed to give away compact
discs at the beginning of the year with that pro
gram," he said.
According to Hansen, within 6 months it will be
impossible for Leland system users to login without
installing the Kerberos protection software.
