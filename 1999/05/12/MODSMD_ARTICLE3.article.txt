# Searching for playmates
## Playboy magazine photographers interview Stanford students, looking for 'Girls of the Pac-10' to pose nude 
### Jamecca Marshall Contributing writer 
For the first time in five years.
Playboy magazine has returned to
Stanford to interview prospective
playmates for its "Women of the Pac
-10" pictorial, meeting mixed reviews
from women's groups on campus.
David Mecey, a contributing pho
tographer for Playboy since 1979 and
a photographer for the annual college
feature since 1981, admits being sur
prised at the large response he has
gotten so far this year. "Turnout [at

Stanford] is light, historically," he
said.
One junior.symbolic systems
major, who asked to be called Kelly,
said posing for Playboy was some
thing she has thought about doing. "I
thought it would be fun, and my
friends told me I should go for it."
She called her interview "a totally
chill and mellow experience."
An anonymous sophomore hope
ful said she heard about it through
friends at UC-Berkeley, where Play
boy interviewed last week.
"They said it was a real laid back

thing. Not sleazy. Fun." she said.
"They had a gcxid experience, so I
figured, why not."
The sophomore, who didn't want
to reveal her name or major, said she
had also thought about posing nude
before.
"I always said when I grew up I
would be in Playboy," she said.
Sororities have historically been
an issue for recruiting women for the
Playboy feature because most have
policies that bar their members from
posing nude. Senior biological sci
ences major Shawnte Mitchell, presi

dent of Delta Sigma Theta sorority,
said she feels positive that her chapter
wouldn't look fondly on members
posing for Playboy.
"The organization was founded
on Christian principles. Naturally
they are going to frown upon actions
they deem immoral." Mitchell said.
"And they would deem posing inap
propriate."
Erica Denham, senior sociology
major and president of Alpha Kappa
Alpha sorority, remembers when a

member posted nude pictures of her
self on the Web.
"There was a very negative re
sponse, " Denham said. "Most peo
ple were like, 'this is not the type of
image our members should be dis
playing.' "
Mecey said he isn't concerned.
"We don't really worry about sorori
ties. We get bipolar reactions, but
most sororities are like 'whatever.' "
Women's Center Director Fabi
enne McPhail said the center had no
comment on the matter but admitted
that she was unaware Playboy was in
terviewing on campus.
"It would be interesting to look at
the issue from the standpoint of
women, their body images and eating
disorders," McPhail said.
The sophomore pictorial hopeful
said she didn't buy claims of Playboy
raising negative body image ques

tions. "That's just their own projec
tions," she said of people who think
so.
Mecey said he is accustomed to
controversy from campus women's
organizations. "The thing is, we don't
coerce or force (prospective models]
to do anything. They should be al
lowed to make up their own mind."
"I consider myself a sex-positive
feminist," the sophomore hopeful
said. "1 believe in embracing our sex
uality and being comfortable with
your body."
Hotli Kelly and the anonymous
sophomore said they expected posi
tive reactions from the Stanford com
munity.
"I think people at Stanford are
more open-minded than they get
credit for," Kelly said.
The process of finding three or
four models from each school for the
October issue — the most popular
outside of celebrity issues — takes
only a few days. After an initial inter
view. women are asked back to take

test Polaroids, in which they reveal as
little or as much as they want and
from which a board of editors will
pick finalists.
Mecey said most women come to
interviews out of curiosity and per
haps as a way to relieve the tension of
college life. A few have made careers
from it, most notably former play
mate Jenny McCarthy, discovered at
the University of Illinois.
Both women said they inter
viewed "just for fun," but the sopho
more candidate said she would be
"proud to make it into Playboy."
Mecey, who has photographed
big names such as Sharon Stone, Car
men Electra, Michael Keaton and
Jay Leno, said the professional at
mosphere and the excitement of the
process is the reason he loves the col
lege feature.
"It's for women with a sense of ad
venture, who want to use their own
mind," Mecey said. "Women's
groups try to influence them. That's
not feminism; that's mind control."
