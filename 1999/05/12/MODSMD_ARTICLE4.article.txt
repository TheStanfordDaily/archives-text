# 200 gather to protest bombing
## Students, faculty mourn Chinese embassy deaths 
### Bo Zhang 
More than 2(X) Chinese students gathered yesterday
at noon in White Plaza to protest NATO's bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia and mourn the three
Chinese people killed in the incident.
Wearing black ribbons on their arms, the Chinese stu
dents marched from White Plaza to Tresidder Union
and then to Meyer Library.
They lit candles and held up a 20-foot-long piece of
cloth which read. "We need peace! Stop killing the inno
cent!"
Five days ago, three NATO missiles hit the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia and left three dead and 20 in
jured. The dead were later confirmed to be a young male
reporter, his wife and a middle-aged female reporter.
The bombing brought even more tension to the al
ready troubled relationship between the United States
and China. College students all over China have been
protesting the bombing in front of U.S. embassies, and
their actions are apparently supported by the Chinese
government.
President Clinton and NATO officials apologized
Monday for the bombing and said it was a mistake. But
the Chinese government and protesters at yesterday's
rally said they want a more plausi
ble explanation.
"We need convincing reasons,"
said Hongbin Li, doctoral student in
economics and one of the protest
ers. "They say they accidentally
used the map six years ago. It's not
quite possible lor NATO with such
advanced technology to make such
a stupid mistake."
Questioning the credibility of
NATO's explanation was only one
aim of the rally.
"We want to express our sorrow
for the dead and let our voice be
heard." said protester Yu Gao, a
doctoral student in engineering and
economics operational resources.
"We want peace. We don't want to
raise antagonism. But the bombing
has to stop."
Among the protesters was
Charles Stein, a 79-year-old emeri
tus statistics professor.
"I apologize for my govern
ment's action of bombing the Chi
nese Embassy," Stein said with a
trembling voice. "I regret that they
didn't give a sincere apology and
stop the bombing."

Many passersby stopped by and
read the flyers about the bombing
and the three dead, but some don't
think it was a good idea to stop
NATO's air strikes against Yu
goslavia.
When the Chinese students were
shouting "Stop bombing," junior
Jacinto Hernandez yelled, "Keep
bombing! More bornbjflg]" t
I lernandez said NATO's bomb
ing of the Chinese Embassy was a
terrible mistake, but he believes it
was an inevitable casualty in a con
flict.
"There are thousands of Alban
ian civilians who are killed in Koso
vo by Milosevic," Hernandez said.
"The death of three people is a lot
less savage than ethnic cleansing."
Many Chinese students did not
agree. Several said NATO's bomb
ing didn't help protect the life of
ethnic Albanians but rather put
them in danger.
"After 49 days of bombing,
many innocents were killed and
refugees grew into a larger num
ber." said Zhongren Chen, a post
doctoral fellow in chemistry. "You
can't add wrong to wrong and make
it right."
Li added, "Is it a good way to
stop killing by killing?"
