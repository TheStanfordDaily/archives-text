### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
Drama Prof. Charles R. Lyons, the
man who re-created the Stanford drama
department, died of cancer yesterday at
his Palo Alto home. He was 66.
Lyons chaired the department for 15
years from his arrival at Stanford in 1973.

In that time he turned the department's focus to the notion
of the "artist-scholar."
"He had a vision, particularly at the graduate level,"
said Ronald Davies, the drama department administrator.
"He always believed people in the drama department
should he both students of drama and practicioners of it."
Lyons earned his bachelors, masters and doctoral de
grees from Stanford. He stepped down as department
chair in 1987 but resumed the post in 1995. In his 26 years
at the University he also chaired the program in Western
Culture, now the Introduction to the Humanities.

theater whose six books included studies of the plays of
William Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett, Lyons' weight

as a top scholar brought the depart
ment respect, Davies said.
"He represented the intellectual
strength of the department," Davies
said.
He was also revered as a teacher
by both colleagues and students,
winning the Dean's Award tor dis
tinguished graduate teaching in
1995.
"In the short time of studying with
him, he influenced the shape of my
thought," said drama doctoral stu
dent Kathryn Mederos, a student in
Lyons' Modernism and Post-Mod
ernism class. "His teaching was ex
tremely impressive in light of his ill
ness. [Monday] was the first time he
didn't show up to class."
Sophomore Bradley Richie was a
student in Lyons' King Lear fresh
man seminar in 1997. "What was re

ally important to me as a freshman
was how approachable he was,"
Richie said. "Even though I didn't
know him very we 11... he was always
there for me."
Davies said Lyons, who was on
sabatical last spring and fall and med
ical leave in the winter, planned to re
tire this year.
"He was going to keep teaching to
the end," Drama Prof. Harry Elam
said in a press release. "Being a schol
ar / teacher is what defined him."
"He remained during his entire
time at Stanford a very productive
scholar," Davies said. "He taught his
classes in such a way that he would
learn every time he taught."
Lyons is survived by Leila Phec
Lyons, his wife of 43 years, and two
sons and three sisters.
His loss will be particularly tough
for Stanford drama. Davies said.
"He made it very difficult for peo
ple inside the University not to take
the Drama Department seriously."
