### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
Drama Prof. Charles R. Lyons, the
man who re-created the Stanford drama
department, died of cancer yesterday at
his Palo Alto home. He was 66.
Lyons chaired the department for 15
years from his arrival at Stanford in 1973.

In that time he turned the department's focus to the notion
of the "artist-scholar."
"He had a vision, particularly at the graduate level,"
said Ronald Davies, the drama department administrator.
"He always believed people in the drama department
should he both students of drama and practicioners of it."
Lyons earned his bachelors, masters and doctoral de
grees from Stanford. He stepped down as department
chair in 1987 but resumed the post in 1995. In his 26 years
at the University he also chaired the program in Western
Culture, now the Introduction to the Humanities.
An internationally renowned expert in contemporary
theater whose six books included studies of the plays of
William Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett, Lyons' weight
