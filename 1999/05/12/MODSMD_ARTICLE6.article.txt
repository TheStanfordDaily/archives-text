### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
Following a dinner at Com
padre's, the first ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate convened last night just
long enough to elect next year's
Senate chair, junior Steven
Aronowitz.
Aronowitz hopes to lead "an
Undergraduate Senate acting like a
team," he said.
"This year was a good year â€” I'd
like to see that continue."
Though a first-term senator,
Aronowitz plans to draw upon lead
ership experience from Big Game
Gaieties and the Stanford Ski

Team.
"We'll be making it up as we go
along next year" in the newly re
structured senate, he said. "We'll be
creating the precedent, setting the
tone for what the Undergraduate
Senate will be like."
He plans to work on "making the
ASSU serve student organizations
better" through programs such as
putting the ASSU banking system
on line.
The senate chair prepares the
meeting agenda and runs each
meeting.
Aronowitz defeated junior Matt
Spence, who was the 1997-98
deputy senate chair and a candi
date for ASSI) president in 1998.
The senate also listened to brief
introductions from sophomore
ASSU President Mike Levin, ju
nior Nominations Committee chair
Stephanie Cheng, and the Senate's
unofficial social chairs, junior Nikki
Love and sophomore Clara Chen.
"I hope you find [being in the
Senate] an extremely rewarding
thing," Levin said.
Next week, senators will attend
an orientation meeting to explain
the inner workings of the ASSU
government.
The next senate meeting will be
May 25 at 7 p.m. in the Law School.
Room 190.
Levin and the new senators
were elected last month in the
spring quarter general election.
