### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
Following a dinner at Com
padre's, the first ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate convened last night just
long enough to elect next year's
Senate chair, junior Steven
Aronowitz.
Aronowitz hopes to lead "an
Undergraduate Senate acting like a
team," he said.
"This year was a good year â€” I'd
like to see that continue."
Though a first-term senator,
Aronowitz plans to draw upon lead
ership experience from Big Game
Gaieties and the Stanford Ski

Team.
"We'll be making it up as we go
along next year" in the newly re
structured senate, he said. "We'll be
creating the precedent, setting the
tone for what the Undergraduate
Senate will be like."
He plans to work on "making the
ASSU serve student organizations
better" through programs such as
putting the ASSU banking system
on line.
The senate chair prepares the
meeting agenda and runs each
meeting.
