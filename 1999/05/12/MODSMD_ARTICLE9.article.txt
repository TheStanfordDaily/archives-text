## Additives barely reduce smog 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Oxy
gen additives in gasoline, touted
since 1993 as one of the most effec
tive ways to cut air pollution, may in
fact do little to reduce a major ingre
dient of urban smog, a panel of
experts said yesterday.
The study by the National Acade
my of Sciences panel said the addi
tive, being used in about a third of
the gasoline sold in the United
States, is believed to reduce overall
peak ozone levels "by only a few
percent."
The study said, however, the so
called reformulated gasoline with
the additive has characteristics other
than higher oxygen levels that lower

pollution from automobiles and light
trucks. The group made no recom
mendation whether the program
should be continued.
Reformulated gasoline has been
required by the EPA since 1995 in
areas with severe smog. All or parts
of 17 states require the fuel.
The most widely used oxygenate.
MTBE, has been a focus of contro
versy as critics argued that it presents
its own environmental and health
risks. Recently, California reversed
course and said it would ban the
additive beginning in 2(X)2 because
M TBE has been found in lakes and
streams.
Peak ozone levels in urban areas

have decreased more than 10 per
cent since 1986 and continue to
decline. Hut the 11-member panel of
scientists said "it is not certain that
any part of these trends can be sig
nificantly attributed to the use of
reformulated gasoline."
The addition of MTBE or
ethanol to gasoline, in itself, "is like
ly to have little air-quality impact in
terms of ozone reduction." the study
by the academy's National Research
Council said. It said reductions in
volatile organic compounds and car
bon monoxide from cars appear to
be quite small, and the additive may
lead to more nitrogen oxide being
released.
