## The 						show will go on 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
The Drama Department struggled
yesterday to come to terms with its
second loss of a faculty member to
cancer this year.
The disease claimed Senior Drama
Lecturer Alex Stewart, 48, in January.

Just as the department had begun to recover from his
death. Drama Prof. Charles Lyons, the department
chair, died Tuesday at 66.
In any university department, two deaths in the
same year would have a big affect. In the family-like at
mosphere of Stanford drama, it has been devastating.
"We only have nine professors and three senior lec
turers." said Ronald Davies. the department adminis
trator. "We lost a senior lecturer, and we lost a profes
sor. That's a pretty hig hit."
Interim Drama Department Chair Michael Ram
saur called the deaths "largely an emotional loss. Par
ticularly with ("harles now ... he was central to the de
velopment of most of the faculty's careers here. All of
a sudden he's not here.
"You question how you can continue to go on and
do your work in a normal way, when in fact you have
these scars just ripped out of you."
Each man leaves his own void in the department.
Stewart was an outstanding technical director, who
colleagues said worked on every drama production at
Stanford.
Lyons turned around Stanford drama in his 15-year
stint as department chair from 1973 to I C >»S7. focusing
its programs on an "artist-scholar" ideal that called for
students to study the discipline as well as perform it. 1 le
returned to the chair in 1995.
Drama Prof. 1 larry Flam said there was no easy way
to deal with the losses. "In both cases, these are people
whose memory will live on. It sort of teaches you per
spective and value in things."
Both men were renowned for their teaching abili
ties. and students in the department were shaken by
their deaths.
"It's horrible for the department," doctoral student
Kathryn Mederos said. "People in the department for
a long time have been dealing with issues ... we've
gone through a number of changes and now is a time of
upheaval."
"I can't quite put my mind around (Lyons' death]
yet." said doctoral student Aleksandra Wolska, who
counted Lyons among the advisors for her dissertation.
"We're all shocked and very saddened by it."
Wolska expects Lyons' passing to bring drama stu
dents and faculty closer together. " The death of Alex
Stewart certainly did that." she said.
Elam agreed. "It has been a year for re-examina
tion," he said. "As a faculty, it is a time that has brought
us together to re-assess the teaching of drama."
That closeness can only help as the department
looks to recover and rebuild. Ramsaur said a new lec
turer, who will begin work in the fall, has already been
hired to fill Stewart's post. The search to fill Lyons' po
sition will begin in the fall as well.
But. Ramsaur said, "you don't replace them."
Both men's legacies will endure for a long time, he


Lyons
added.
"We had a department meeting
this morning, and an issue came up.

and I could see Alex in the com
ments of some of the staff."
The legacy of Lyons, who for a
long time chaired the program in
Western Culture, an earlier version
of the Introduction to the Humani
ties program, can be seen in the

willingness of other department
members to follow his lead in taking
on important University roles.
Assoc. Drama Prof. Alice Rayner is
the director of Humanities Special
Programs, and Elam heads the
Area One program.

But even the legacy bearers
must deal with the loss of their
mentors and friends — the chal
lenge that now faces the Drama
Department.
"It has been," Ramsaur said,
"just a tremendously difficult year."
