### Mariam Ali Contributing writer 
A memorial service for Classics
Prof. Emeritus Antony Raubitschek
was held yesterday at the St. Thomas
Aquinas Church in Palo Alto.
Raubitschek died last week at the
age of 86.
Raubitschek was born in Vienna
and educated in Austria and
Athens. He came to the United
States in 1938 when Germany an
nexed Austria. After teaching at
Princeton and Yale, he was appoint
ed professor of classics at Stanford in
1963.
"What stands out the most about
Dad was his interest in learning —
he was always a student,"
Raubitschek's oldest daughter Kleia
Luckner said.
Raubitschek is known primarily
for his study of the inscriptions on
the Acropolis in Athens. He was
also interested in the influence of the
classics on American political
thought.
"When I got to Stanford as a fac
ulty member in 1976, I always felt I
should call Tony 'Professor
Raubitschek'," Classics Prof. Marsh
McCall said. "He was a living legend
in the field."
"Tony," as he was called by stu
dents and colleagues alike, was a vis
iting professor at many institutions.
His family remembers that he corre
sponded with scholars from around
the world, and traveled widely. A
month before his death,
Raubitschek received the Austrian
Cross of Honor for Science and Art,
the highest honor given to a private
citizen in Austria.

"He was so thrilled to get it. And
we were so thrilled for him," Luckn

er said.
• "Wc all went to the Faculty Club
for a ceremony in his honor," com
mented McCall with a break in his
voice. "After listening to everyone
praise him. Tony stood up and lec
tured all of us for 15 minutes. He just
wanted to pass on that being a
teacher was the most important
thing to him — and that all teachers
had to put students first, even above
their own scholarly reputations."
McCall paused for a second. "It
was so beautiful."
Raubitschek received both the
Dean's Award and the Walter J.
Gores Award for excellence in
teaching.
"He loved undergraduates. They
were always in and out of the house
for lea and cookies and conversa
tion," Luckner said.
She added. "It was great for us
kids when we were younger, be
cause we became friends with the
students."
"Even when he retired, he still
had advisees," commented
Raubitschek's oldest son John. "Ik
would go out and watch their games.
They would come over for dinner.
We have gotten calls from his for
mer students from around the
world."
Anthony Raubitschek is survived
by four children and seven grand
children.
His family said contributions
made in his memory to the Classics
Department will go towards a sup
porting student study abroad.
"He always wanted to show peo
ple the world," Luckner said. "It
would be what he wanted."
"A scholar for the ages and a
wonderful teacher," McCall said
fondly. "That was Tony."
