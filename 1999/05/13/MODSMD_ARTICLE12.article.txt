Voters reject warning label on furs
BEVERLY HILLS, (AP) — Despite the support of some of its
more famous residents, voters in this city of the well-dressed and
well-heeled rejected a measure requiring fur garments to have
labels explaining how the animals died.
Measure A, the sole issue on Tuesday's ballot, was defeated by
3,363 to 1,908, or 63.K percent to 36.2 percent, city spokeswoman
Robin Chancellor said.
A little over a quarter of the city's 20,000 registered voters cast
ballots.
Even so, the bill's supporters said they were pleased with the
publicity they received.
"It's disappointing to lose the election, but we've won the bat
tle," said Luke Montgomery, campaign manager of Beverly Hills
Consumers for Informed Choice, the group behind the measure.
"All we wanted was a little tag telling people what animals go
through and we got front pages all over the planet," he said. "A lot
of people around the world now know about the cruelty these ani
mals are put through."
Duke Medical Center loses funding
DURHAM. N.C. (AP) —The federal government has suspend
ed nearly all government-funded research involving humans at
Duke University Medical Center because of lax safety oversight.
The order was issued by the federal Office for Protection from
Research Risks, a division of the National Institutes of Health.
Duke, one of the nation's largest and most prestigious research
facilities, was told not to enroll new subjects in federally funded
experiments because administrators hadn't fixed problems cited in
a review the government completed in December.
"Research activities involving previously enrolled subjects may
continue only where it is in the best interests of individual sub
jects." Dr. Michael Carome, the federal research protection agen
cy's chief of compliance, said in a letter Monday to the Duke med
ical center's top administrator.
Problems center on Duke's Institutional Review Board, which
evaluates research proposals to see whether they are sound and
ethical.
Federal rules require hospitals to establish such review boards
to ensure that people are properly informed of the risks of the med
ical trials they are taking part in and to catch early side effects
afflicting participants.
Former girlfriend sells Salinger's love letters
NEW YORK (AP) — Author Joyce Maynard is selling love let
ters she received from the reclusive J.D. Salinger, Sotheby's auc
tion house said today.
Salinger wrote 14 letters between April 1972 and August 1973 to
Maynard, whom he romanced lor nine months.
Their relationship began when she was an 18-year-old Yale
University student and he was a 53-year-old heralded author.
Maynard quit school to live in an isolated cottage in Cornish,
N.H., with Salinger, who has shunned public life.
The letters run the gamut from formal to smitten to impersonal,
reflecting the course of their relationship, which he ended in March
1973.
Maynard. who for 25 years declined to discuss the relationship,
last year revealed Salinger's eccentricities and fixations in her
memoir, "At Home in the World."
The 80-year-old author of "The Catcher in the Rye" is obsessed
with his privacy. Salinger last wrote for publication in 1965.
Maynard told The New York Times she decided to sell for
financial reasons.
