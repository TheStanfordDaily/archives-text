## Clinton will nominate deputy Lawrence Summers as successor 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Trea
sury Secretary Robert Rubin, idol
ized on Wall Street for the policies
many credit with spurring the record
U.S. economic boom, is stepping
down. President Clinton said he will
nominate Rubin's deputy. Lawrence
Summers, to succeed him.
Clinton, in a Rose Garden cere
mony. said Rubin has been
acclaimed as the most effective trea
sury secretary since Alexander
Hamilton, the first man to hold the
job. Clinton said that acclaim has
been "well-deserved."
"I will miss his cool head and
steady hand," Clinton said. "He
cares very deeply about the impact
of abstract economics on ordinary
people. I can tell you that for all
these years, he has always been one
of the administration's most power
ful advocates for the poor and for
our cities."
Clinton also lavished praise on
Summers, a former Harvard Univer
sity professor who oversaw the
administration's efforts to stem the
Asian financial crisis.
"He is brilliant, able, a critical
part of our economic team during
the entire life of this
administration — therefore, deeply
knowledgeable, more than ready to
steer our nation through the strong
and sometimes turbulent currents of
the new economy," the president
said. "Rarely has any individual
been so well-prepared to become
secretary of the Treasury."
The president announced the
changes at a ceremony attended by
members of his Cabinet and the
Congress. Federal Reserve Chair
man Alan Greenspan joined in.
Rubin appeared bemused by the

attention and applause. He twitted
Clinton about the president's habitu
al tardiness, showing up 15 minutes
late for today's ceremony.
Summing up his service, Rubin
said, "It's been a truly extraordinary
experience." He said that Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore "have
repositioned our country with
respect to fiscal discipline, with
respect to leadership on internation
al economic issues that are so critical
to economic well-being."
Rubin said it was hard for him to

leave, because of his commitment to
the administration. But he said his
six and a half years in Washington
had been "all consuming" and that it
was time to return to his home in
New York. He said he would leave
his job around July 4.
Stuart Eizenstat, an undersecre
tary at the State Department, was
chosen by Clinton to replace Sum
mers as second in command at Trea
sury.
Rubin said he expected that the
administration "will not miss a beat"

on the economy with the new team
named bv the president.
The Dow Jones industrial aver
age dropped more than 2(H) points
when news of Rubin's resignation
first was reported but quickly recov
ered most of that ground and closed
down 25 points.
Rubin and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan were
widely credited by Wall Street and
business leaders with the policies
that set the economy on its longest
peacetime expansion in history.
