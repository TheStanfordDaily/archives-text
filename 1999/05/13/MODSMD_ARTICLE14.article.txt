BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Allied
warplanes pounded Yugoslav bridges and air
fields in what NATO described today as its busi
est bombing day of the seven-week-old air cam
paign. Serb media reported dozens of the attacks
were on mainly civilian targets.
The state-run Tanjug news agency said two
people crossing a bridge in Vladicin Han were
killed and five others were hurt when NATO
bombed the Serbian town's residential district —
bringing to at least seven the number of civilians
killed since Tuesday.
NATO said allied aircraft hit eight bridges, a
missile launcher and five airfields and destroyed
five MiG-21 aircraft on the ground in 327

aii strikes — "the highest number of strike sorties
to date."
"It was a very extensive night of operations
indeed," NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said.
"We really are able now to engage those field
ed forces in Kosovo."
Troops came under direct allied fire in the
Suva Reka, Junik and Stimjle areas. A number of
attacks were against vehicles in camouflaged
defensive positions, NATO said.
NATO has now tlown nearly 2().(XX) sorties in
50 days of operations.
Hungary's sole remaining rail link with
Yugoslavia, a 20-mile route between Szeged and
Subotica. was cut when a bombed overpass col

lapsed onto the track, the Hungarian State Rail
ways said. Other links have already been bombed.
In a new attack early today,Tanjug said at least
15 NATO missiles fell on the Serbian town of
Paracin, 85 miles southeast of Belgrade, hitting a
youth hostel and a Bosnian refugee settlement. It
said three people were injured.
Other targets, according to Yugoslav media,
included a collective farm in Svetlje that housed
refugees from northern Kosovo.
The media did not give the refugees' national
ity, but they were presumably from Kosovo's
minority Serb community who — before some
750,000 ethnic Albanians were driven out of
Kosovo in this crisis — were outnumbered 9-1.
