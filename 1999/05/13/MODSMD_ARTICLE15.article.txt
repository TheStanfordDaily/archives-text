# Senate rejects gun show restriction
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The Republican
controlled Senate rejected fresh restrictions on
sales at gun shows yesterday in Congress' first
vote on gun control since last month's shooting
spree in a Colorado high school.
Instead, on a vote of 53-45, the Senate sig
naled support for a system of voluntary back
ground checks on private sales at gun shows.
The developments marked a victory for the
National Rifle Association and a defeat for gun
control advocates, who had claimed that the
shooting deaths at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo. — the latest in a string of vio
lent episodes in the nation's schools — would
give their cause fresh momentum. Instead, their
plan was killed on a vote of 51-47.
"There are many criminals who use gun
shows as a place to procure their weaponry to
commit the mayhem that they do." argued Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who led the failed
drive to close what he said was a "loophole" in
the current law that allows private sales at gun
shows without instant background checks.
He said there was evidence that some of the
weapons used in the Colorado shooting spree
had been purchased by a young woman at a gun
show.
But Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, countered
that Lautenberg's proposal would impose fresh
restrictions on "private citizens who come to
gun shows and engage in discussion with other
private citizens and decide to exchange or sell
their guns."
"Is that a loophole?" asked Craig, who is a
member of the NRA board.
The developments came as the Senate debat
ed legislation to stiffen prosecution of juvenile
crime, largely by providing added funds to pros
ecutors, making it easier to try suspects as
young as 14 as adults and providing for tougher
penalties.
In the wake of the Littleton shootings, the
measure also attracted Democratic gun control

amendments as well as provisions crafted by
Republicans to explore the connection between
violence in music, video games and movies —
and real life.
Thus, Sen. Sam Brownback. R-Kan., and a
bipartisan group of senators won approval for a
limited antitrust exemption to allow competing
companies in the entertainment industry to
explore creation of a voluntary code of conduct
to restrict the amount of violence aimed at chil
dren.
In addition, the proposal calls for a study of
the entertainment industry to see whether it is
marketing violence to children.
"We live unfortunately in a culture that glo
rifies violence .. . presented not as a horror, but
as entertainment," said Brownback.
But in a move that underscored the Demo
cratic insistence that guns be addressed as a
cause of violence. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.,
won acceptance for a parallel study of the gun
industry to see whether it is marketing its prod
ucts to children.
In the debate over gun control, Craig said
that 98 percent of the vendors at gun shows are
licensed dealers, and all their customers are
subjected to background checks imposed under
the Brady bill that was approved in 1993.
But he also said that so-called private sales,
which are exempt from background checks,
accounted for roughly 40 percent of all sales at
gun shows.
While his plan was voluntary, he said it con
tained incentives to entice private collectors to
conduct checks on their customers, including
limited protection from liability in future law
suits.
That only raised more objections from
Democrats, who said that the only people who
currently enjoy liability protection are diplo
mats and some health insurance companies.
"Tens of thousands of firearms are sold at
these events with no background checks or

record keeping," said Lautenberg.
"You can just walk into a gun show, put
down your cash and walk away with a gun,
semiautomatic or any other deadly weapons,"
he said.
The debate was forceful, as Craig accused
Lautenberg of misstating key facts at one or two
points, and gun control advocates made specific
references to the National Rifle Association
and its vaunted lobbying prowess.
The administration included the proposal in
a package of gun control measures it unveiled in
the wake of the Littleton shootings, which the
NRA last week denounced as "a litany of anti
gun schemes that would affect only the law
abiding."
The outcome on the Senate floor seemed
preordained, though, as Republicans spread the
word in advance they had the votes to defeat
Lautenberg's proposal.
The vote to table, and thus kill Lautenberg's
proposal was 51-47, with Democrats Max Cle
land of Georgia and Max Baucus of Montana
joining 49 Republicans.
Six Republicans crossed party lines and sided
with the Democratic advocates of the measure.
They were Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island,
Mike Dewine and George Voinovich of Ohio,
Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, Dick Lugar of Indi
ana and John Warner of Virginia.
On the vote in favor of the system of volun
tary checks, Chafee, Fitzgerald and Sen.
William Roth of Delaware joined all voting
Democrats in opposition.
Democratic gun control advocates are
expected to offer additional proposals today,
but Republicans expressed confidence they
could turn those aside, as well.
The GOP-crafted legislation includes one
gun control provision.
The "juvenile Brady" measure would pro
hibit possession of a firearm by anyone who was
convicted of a violent felony as a juvenile.
