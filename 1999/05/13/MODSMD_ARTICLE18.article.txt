## Editorial Shepard moves on 
### 
Spokesman's work
preserved school's
reputation during scandal

Most students do not
deal directly with outgoing
University Director of
Communications Terry Shepard, but
this does not make the mark he has
left on this campus any smaller.
Shepard's work as, in effect, the
University's voice to the rest of the
world is widely praised. We are all
saddened by news of his departure
for a vice-presidential post at Rice
University, announced last month.
When the University was mired in
the indirect-cost scandal of the
19K0s, Shepard's spin machine was

vital to keeping Stanford's reputa
tion from being completely smeared.
Indeed, it is fitting that the scan
dal has come lull circle during Shep
ard's tenure, with the U.S. Supreme
Court dismissing the lawsuit of indi
rect-cost whistle blower Paul Biddle.
During the scandal, the Universi
ty was accused of billing the federal
government for indirect costs relat
ed to research for the Navy.
Shepard's is the sort of behind
the-scenes job that often goes under
appreciated, but it would be instant
ly apparent if he made any errors.
We are grateful to him for his
commitment to the University and
hard work through the years. We
wish him all the best with his posi
tion at Rice.
