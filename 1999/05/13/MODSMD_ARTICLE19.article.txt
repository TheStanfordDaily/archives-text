ASSLTs Hudson lias been
a great help to those
lacing legal difficulties

I" M A(11NR YOURSIXF, a Stan
ford student with few resources
for legal assistance, in a hind
over some contract you signed or
looking for advice about the car acci
dent you had last week. Where
would you turn?
Jewel Hudson, an office assistant
in the ASSlJ's Legal Counseling
()flice, has provided cheerful and
thoughtful assistance to Stanford
students facing legal challenges for
It) vears.

She talks to students who have
legal problems unrelated to the Uni
versity and recommends attorneys
they can consult with.
Last week, she announced her
departure from the Farm, after a
tenure that began more than 30
years ago when she came to Stanford
with her husband, who was a student
at the time.
Students have nothing but praise
for Hudson, who not only provided
much-needed legal assistance, but
also showed her commitment to stu
dents by attending numerous ASSU
Senate meetings — a feat that few
administrators have claim to.
Hudson's departure will be a great
loss to students. We wish her well.
