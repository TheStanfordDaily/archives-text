## The 						wonderful mating game

YOIJ SPIT IT. You
play it. You got it.
You get it on.
Game. And not just any
game. The mating game.
It's a game whose exis-

tence many of us deny and
whose rules many of us
feign to shun. But on some level we know it
exists, and most of us try our best to play by
the rules.

Admittedly I have no game. In fact, I may
have negative game, so little that people
think 1 am playing games (oh, the irony). So
I looked to a handful of semi-professional
players, some self-professed and others still
in the closet. Without further ado, here's
what they had to say about how to smooth
out the bumpy path to romantic success.

(General rules
As a preface, for those who don't think
they're playing the game, the experts assure
me that everybody's got a game; the reason
we may not be aware of its presence is that
it's simply so natural to us. So considering
you're in the game, you ought to know how
to play well.
The experts' very first rule is to let your
prospective mate know that you are interest
ed. but make it look like you are less inter
ested than he or she is. You need to act like
you don't care. Why? People like challenges.
They vary your contact and behavior. The
purpose is to raise the level of intrigue by
keeping the prospective mate off balance. St)
don't show all your cards at once; whet your
mate's appetite.
Related to this rule is the potent theory

that girls are attracted to jerks. The worst
thing to be in the mating game is someone
who is described as "really nice." Again, we
might ask why. First, we refer to rule number
one and see that all of us are interested in a
challenge. Added to this is the idea that girls
have a desire to act as social workers for their
mates; they firmly believe they'll be able to
reform the jerk.
We also have the 'Jesse's Girl Theory,"
which holds that as soon as you become
unattainable, attached to someone else, peo
ple seem to desire you. But as soon as you're
back on the market, people lose interest.
Pretty painful.
lastly, we have a rule that one expert pro
fesses to live by: if you don't have a leather
jacket, you're screwed.
Phone protocol
Phone etiquette is vital to playing the
game well. Most of us have seen the excruci
atingly painful scene in "Swingers" when the
movie's hero blatantly fails to follow the
rules, leaving message after message on a
woman's answering machine. Don't be this
man. One expert suggests that you never
leave a message. And he also recommends
that you be in control of calling; be the caller;
don't tell your prospective mate to call you.
Call between the prime hours of 8 and 10
p.m.
Always remember to wait before calling
someone back after the initial call. Some
people practice the four-day wait and others
the two or three. Simply remember that
when you call back too soon, you lose all
mystery and any edge you previously had.
Again, refer back to Rule No. I for the basis

of this rule.
First date protocol
If you've followed phone protocol, you
may he looking at a first date. It may seem
trivial, but where you go on your first date
says many things. To start, you have to
decide what to do. You want to be low-key
while still maintaining the aura of a date. So
go to a movie instead of renting a video. And
go out to eat rather than having your mate
over to your dining hall. Where you eat is
fairly important. Dinner at a four-star restau
rant sends a different message than dinner at
Polio Rey. What you're looking for is that
happy medium, an inexpensive sit-down
eatery with good food â€” nothing that
requires semi-formal attire.
Another important rule is not to bring
your mate by your friends until you feel firm
ly established with him or her, because if
your mate's into you, your mate could be
into your friends. Everyone has heard stories
of someone's date running off with his best
friend at a formal. To avoid such a mishap,
wait to introduce your mate to your friends
until you're relatively well-established.
Other than that, good luck and happy
hunting.
So that's what the players have to say.
You can choose to play by their rules. Or you
might just take one last bit of advice from my
friend Jenn's mother: "Don't worry about
dating. Just study!"

never to let them see you sweat. Boy was she
wrong.
