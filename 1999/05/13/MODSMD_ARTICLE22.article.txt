Remember lives of Chinese
I was appalled as I read junior Jacinto
Hernandez's comment on the U.S.-led
NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy,
as reported in Wednesday's Daily ("2(H)
gather to protest bombing"). At the same
time, however, I am not totally surprised
as such sentiment seems to prevail in the
U.S. government and media.
Hernandez did not seem to be con
cerned with the lives of the three innocent
Chinese who were killed in the bombing,
as lie yelled, "Keep bombing! More bomb
ing!" This has led me to wonder: if, for
some reason, the three U.S. soldiers who
were captured had been in the Chinese
embassy that day instead of three Chinese
civilians and they were killed as a result of
the bombing, leaving their families and
loved ones behind, would Hernandez's
reaction be different?
Would he, or the U.S. government and
media as well, believe that "the death of
three people" is just a minor cost to pay?
Would words of mere regret rather than
apology, ludicrous excuses such as using a
six-year old map or calling it an unfortu
nate incident and a refusal to investigate
or punish the perpetrators be acceptable
to the American public? Are the lives of
three Chinese civilians worth less than
three American soldiers?
Now if, as Hernandez implied, there is
a higher cause that justifies the killing,
what is it? The bombing has repeatedly
killed many innocent Albanians and
resulted in an innumerable number of
refugees. There is a pattern here — more

and more innocent people seem to suffer
as the bombings continue. After the Alba
nian civilians, after the Chinese embassy,
what next?
I am glad to read that among the
protestors on Tuesday was Emeritus
Statistics Prof. Charles Stein. At least this
still gives me some hope of conscience in
the American public.

Questions for protesters
With reference to your article yester
day, "2(H) gather to protest bombing," I
have two questions to ask the "new-wave"
protesters of NATO's bombing.
Why this sudden burst of voices follow
ing the death of three Chinese persons in
an "accidental" NATO attack? There is
something badly parochial about such an
attitude. Thousands of Kosovars and
Serbs have been affected, but that doesn't
seem to have moved these new-wave
protesters so much until the attack on the
Chinese embassy.
And do these new-wave protesters
have even a tenth of such humanitarian
indignation when it comes to the far
greater human rights violations occurring
around the world? Forget Myanmar,
Indonesia, India, the Sudan — take the
case of China itself. When it comes to
China's own violations of human rights,
say in Tibet, do these very students protest
to anything like the same extent?

There is a certain lack of perspective in
such knee-jerk protests. I am not ques
tioning the validity of the current protests,
but what I am questioning is what seems to
be the very narrow-minded motivation of
these protests. Where is the balance?
Where is the consistency? Can the loss of
three Chinese lives move people to an
extent that the loss >112 thousands of Koso
var lives did not? We all have beams in our
eyes. Let us question ourselves at least as
much as we question others.

Bombing doesn't have benefits
The turn of events around Yugoslavia
reveals the great dangers inherent in con
tinued warfare, and we should thank the
Chinese reaction for sending a wake-up
call around the world.
Much of the American press seems
consumed by the desire to transform itself
into the Ministry of Propaganda: it
denounces Chinese "mobs" and backs the
true lunatics of the piece, who insist on
continued warfare after some useless
"deep regrets." Just after the United
States is relieved to have it's own three
soldiers returned, who can gainsay the
Chinese for anguish over the senseless
killing of three of their journalists and the
wounding of numerous other innocents?
Clinton and NATO offer nothing more
than "sorry," along with inane lectures on
their great "kill-ratios' or on the dangers
of "ethnic cleansing." Hut their bombs just
foment lurther hatred and instability, re
balkanizing the Balkans and as we shall
see, endangering the whole world as a
result.
Why do Clinton and NATO insist on
continuing the bombing? Clinton fiddles
while U.S. foreign policy burns to the
ground. The American press again is full
of talk about how great it is that Russia
has joined the "peace" deal, but what
about the fact that the Russians have
reversed policy? The Russians are rapidly
adding tactical nuclear weapons and first
strike capabilities to their defense doc
trines. The Chinese have even cut rela
tions and pulled out of nuclear non-prolif
eration and human rights pacts. Is Clinton
really crazy enough to insist on military
means until he drives us all to the brink
when the nuclear nightmare should really
be over already?
There is a reason for this insanity, but
it's not pretty: the vigilantes want to con
tinue conquering East Europe without any
interference from the United Nations. The
vigilantes are Clinton. Blair, Schroeder,
Chirac and NATO. This is their war and
they're not about to let anyone else run it!
They worship the magic incantation "eth

nic cleansing" that seems to allow the
Western military to pillage without
restraint, even bombing hospitals and
refugees with "stray" missiles. There are
no "smart" or "soft" bombs. They are all
meant to kill and destroy. Knocking out
the country's electric net kills just as sure
ly as the fires started by other bombs. The
Western military is using "depleted urani
um" bombs. They are going to toxify the
atmosphere in Europe just as surely as
they did in Iraq, not to mention peppering
Kuwait and even their own soldiers with
the vaporized radioactive substance. U.S.
Cien. Wesley Clark, head of NATO air
attacks, has vowed to "demolish, destroy,
devastate, degrade and ultimately elimi
nate" Yugoslavia's economy. It sounds
like a definition of "ethnic cleansing," only
sent by U.S. bombs.
The excuses and the "great debate" on
whether targeting the Chinese embassy
was really an "accident" are useless. Suf
fice it to say that the U.S. military attache
at our ex-embassy in Belgrade knew quite
well where the building was since he had
been the guest of the Chinese at numerous
functions. We have all had more experi
ence than we would like watching Clinton
lie with a "straight face." Who can believe
him now? The emperor is truly naked.

Only American media magnates back the
Balkan war. Clinton, NATO and the
media understand that China's power in
the United Nation would be used, even if
the embassy bombing had never hap
pened. in order to limit the depredations
of the NATO-led vigilantes. Now they are
out to discredit China as crazy because of
Chinese indignation at the sacrifice of
innocent civilians. The vigilantes want a
free hand.
Iran doesn't buy the charade. They
want U.N. control, not U.S.-NATO butch
ers, even though it is their fellow Muslims
who have suffered the likewise insane
depredations of Milosevic. Radio Free
Europe, which is surely as biased as the
most jingoistic U.S. newspaper, has
reported its terror that even a newspaper
in one of the Arabian Gulf states recently
published the statement that: "the Ameri
cans don't care about protecting human
rights and minorities, they want to protect
their supremacy in the world."
The only beef 1 have with the quote
from the Arabian Gulf above is that this
really concerns the U.S. government, not
the American people.

In response to Diversions
Diversions, the Daily's weekly
"humor" page, actually had its best day in
recent memory yesterday, when its editor
Zach Udko responded to the wealth of
criticism his creation has been receiving. 1
finally broke a smile reading his work,
though it was perhaps directed more at the
critical feast he had laid out before me
than at anything particularly hilarious he
said. Especially delicious were the absurd
ly misguided notions of self-importance
and Udko's idea of satire.
I'll start with the latter. Having known
or worked closely with the creative team
of SCBN's "The Oval," the editor of the
Chappie, columnist Mark Silver and most
of the improv troupes on campus, 1 think
I've evolved a pretty clear idea of what's
funny and what isn't. Sadly, Diversions
isn't. And I think that's because you
believe you're satirizing the campus by
"degrading fellow humans."
But that's not what satire is about.
Satire involves irony, precision and
motive. To assume you're practicing it by
recycling high school material and pulling
no punches is pathetically wrong. Until
you discover subtlety, I really don't think
you're worth the paper you're printed on.

But why do I come back every week?
Simple — I've got hope for you, kid.
So I challenge you. If you truly love and
respect your readers, act like a true satirist
and pick your targets consciously, ridicule
them intelligently. An example, to help?
Certainly. Last year, Diversions brought
us Darwin Fish vs. Jesus Fish, a graphic
representation of one of history's great
controversies.
Pretty witty. Last week. Diversions had
another round of mock letters to the
Daily, replete with vapid obscenities and
obvious gags. Witless.
So take some time, read some old
issues, come back with something fresh
and intelligent.
1 realize you haven't been here long
and that you may not have an adequate
conception of what passes for wit at Stan
ford, but I hope I've helped you in some
small way. 1 wish you. Diversions, the best
of luck.
But if you can't meet the challenge,
please make room for someone who can.
Stop wasting our time. Instead of writing
another column in response to this, devote
some effort to your "humor" page.

In response to Diversions
Diversions, the Daily's weekly
"humor" page, actually had its best day in
recent memory yesterday, when its editor
Zach Udko responded to the wealth of
criticism his creation has been receiving. 1
finally broke a smile reading his work,
though it was perhaps directed more at the
critical feast he had laid out before me
than at anything particularly hilarious he
said. Especially delicious were the absurd
ly misguided notions of self-importance
and Udko's idea of satire.
I'll start with the latter. Having known
or worked closely with the creative team
of SCBN's "The Oval," the editor of the
Chappie, columnist Mark Silver and most
of the improv troupes on campus, 1 think
I've evolved a pretty clear idea of what's
funny and what isn't. Sadly, Diversions
isn't. And I think that's because you
believe you're satirizing the campus by
"degrading fellow humans."
But that's not what satire is about.
Satire involves irony, precision and
motive. To assume you're practicing it by
recycling high school material and pulling
no punches is pathetically wrong. Until
you discover subtlety, I really don't think
you're worth the paper you're printed on.

But why do I come back every week?
Simple — I've got hope for you, kid.
So I challenge you. If you truly love and
respect your readers, act like a true satirist
and pick your targets consciously, ridicule
them intelligently. An example, to help?
Certainly. Last year, Diversions brought
us Darwin Fish vs. Jesus Fish, a graphic
representation of one of history's great
controversies.
Pretty witty. Last week. Diversions had
another round of mock letters to the
Daily, replete with vapid obscenities and
obvious gags. Witless.
So take some time, read some old
issues, come back with something fresh
and intelligent.
1 realize you haven't been here long
and that you may not have an adequate
conception of what passes for wit at Stan
ford, but I hope I've helped you in some
small way. 1 wish you. Diversions, the best
of luck.
But if you can't meet the challenge,
please make room for someone who can.
Stop wasting our time. Instead of writing
another column in response to this, devote
some effort to your "humor" page.

Remember lives of Chinese
I was appalled as I read junior Jacinto
Hernandez's comment on the U.S.-led
NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy,
as reported in Wednesday's Daily ("2(H)
gather to protest bombing"). At the same
time, however, I am not totally surprised
as such sentiment seems to prevail in the
U.S. government and media.
Hernandez did not seem to be con
cerned with the lives of the three innocent
Chinese who were killed in the bombing,
as lie yelled, "Keep bombing! More bomb
ing!" This has led me to wonder: if, for
some reason, the three U.S. soldiers who
were captured had been in the Chinese
embassy that day instead of three Chinese
civilians and they were killed as a result of
the bombing, leaving their families and
loved ones behind, would Hernandez's
reaction be different?
Would he, or the U.S. government and
media as well, believe that "the death of
three people" is just a minor cost to pay?
Would words of mere regret rather than
apology, ludicrous excuses such as using a
six-year old map or calling it an unfortu
nate incident and a refusal to investigate
or punish the perpetrators be acceptable
to the American public? Are the lives of
three Chinese civilians worth less than
three American soldiers?
Now if, as Hernandez implied, there is
a higher cause that justifies the killing,
what is it? The bombing has repeatedly
killed many innocent Albanians and
resulted in an innumerable number of
refugees. There is a pattern here — more

and more innocent people seem to suffer
as the bombings continue. After the Alba
nian civilians, after the Chinese embassy,
what next?
I am glad to read that among the
protestors on Tuesday was Emeritus
Statistics Prof. Charles Stein. At least this
still gives me some hope of conscience in
the American public.

Questions for protesters
With reference to your article yester
day, "2(H) gather to protest bombing," I
have two questions to ask the "new-wave"
protesters of NATO's bombing.
Why this sudden burst of voices follow
ing the death of three Chinese persons in
an "accidental" NATO attack? There is
something badly parochial about such an
attitude. Thousands of Kosovars and
Serbs have been affected, but that doesn't
seem to have moved these new-wave
protesters so much until the attack on the
Chinese embassy.
And do these new-wave protesters
have even a tenth of such humanitarian
indignation when it comes to the far
greater human rights violations occurring
around the world? Forget Myanmar,
Indonesia, India, the Sudan — take the
case of China itself. When it comes to
China's own violations of human rights,
say in Tibet, do these very students protest
to anything like the same extent?

There is a certain lack of perspective in
such knee-jerk protests. I am not ques
tioning the validity of the current protests,
but what I am questioning is what seems to
be the very narrow-minded motivation of
these protests. Where is the balance?
Where is the consistency? Can the loss of
three Chinese lives move people to an
extent that the loss >112 thousands of Koso
var lives did not? We all have beams in our
eyes. Let us question ourselves at least as
much as we question others.

Bombing doesn't have benefits
The turn of events around Yugoslavia
reveals the great dangers inherent in con
tinued warfare, and we should thank the
Chinese reaction for sending a wake-up
call around the world.
Much of the American press seems
consumed by the desire to transform itself
into the Ministry of Propaganda: it
denounces Chinese "mobs" and backs the
true lunatics of the piece, who insist on
continued warfare after some useless
"deep regrets." Just after the United
States is relieved to have it's own three
soldiers returned, who can gainsay the
Chinese for anguish over the senseless
killing of three of their journalists and the
wounding of numerous other innocents?
Clinton and NATO offer nothing more
than "sorry," along with inane lectures on
their great "kill-ratios' or on the dangers
of "ethnic cleansing." Hut their bombs just
foment lurther hatred and instability, re
balkanizing the Balkans and as we shall
see, endangering the whole world as a
result.
Why do Clinton and NATO insist on
continuing the bombing? Clinton fiddles
while U.S. foreign policy burns to the
ground. The American press again is full
of talk about how great it is that Russia
has joined the "peace" deal, but what
about the fact that the Russians have
reversed policy? The Russians are rapidly
adding tactical nuclear weapons and first
strike capabilities to their defense doc
trines. The Chinese have even cut rela
tions and pulled out of nuclear non-prolif
eration and human rights pacts. Is Clinton
really crazy enough to insist on military
means until he drives us all to the brink
when the nuclear nightmare should really
be over already?
There is a reason for this insanity, but
it's not pretty: the vigilantes want to con
tinue conquering East Europe without any
interference from the United Nations. The
vigilantes are Clinton. Blair, Schroeder,
Chirac and NATO. This is their war and
they're not about to let anyone else run it!
They worship the magic incantation "eth

nic cleansing" that seems to allow the
Western military to pillage without
restraint, even bombing hospitals and
refugees with "stray" missiles. There are
no "smart" or "soft" bombs. They are all
meant to kill and destroy. Knocking out
the country's electric net kills just as sure
ly as the fires started by other bombs. The
Western military is using "depleted urani
um" bombs. They are going to toxify the
atmosphere in Europe just as surely as
they did in Iraq, not to mention peppering
Kuwait and even their own soldiers with
the vaporized radioactive substance. U.S.
Cien. Wesley Clark, head of NATO air
attacks, has vowed to "demolish, destroy,
devastate, degrade and ultimately elimi
nate" Yugoslavia's economy. It sounds
like a definition of "ethnic cleansing," only
sent by U.S. bombs.
The excuses and the "great debate" on
whether targeting the Chinese embassy
was really an "accident" are useless. Suf
fice it to say that the U.S. military attache
at our ex-embassy in Belgrade knew quite
well where the building was since he had
been the guest of the Chinese at numerous
functions. We have all had more experi
ence than we would like watching Clinton
lie with a "straight face." Who can believe
him now? The emperor is truly naked.

Only American media magnates back the
Balkan war. Clinton, NATO and the
media understand that China's power in
the United Nation would be used, even if
the embassy bombing had never hap
pened. in order to limit the depredations
of the NATO-led vigilantes. Now they are
out to discredit China as crazy because of
Chinese indignation at the sacrifice of
innocent civilians. The vigilantes want a
free hand.
Iran doesn't buy the charade. They
want U.N. control, not U.S.-NATO butch
ers, even though it is their fellow Muslims
who have suffered the likewise insane
depredations of Milosevic. Radio Free
Europe, which is surely as biased as the
most jingoistic U.S. newspaper, has
reported its terror that even a newspaper
in one of the Arabian Gulf states recently
published the statement that: "the Ameri
cans don't care about protecting human
rights and minorities, they want to protect
their supremacy in the world."
The only beef 1 have with the quote
from the Arabian Gulf above is that this
really concerns the U.S. government, not
the American people.
