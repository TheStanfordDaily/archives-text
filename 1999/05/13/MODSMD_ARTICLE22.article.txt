University will benefit
I lie 1 >ailv printed a note yesterday that
siiicl Religious Studies Prof. Arnold Eisen
and I were named reeipients of the 1999
koret Prize, which carries with it a sizable
cash award. You were very kind to take
note of this splendid honor.
Since the article appeared, however,
sonic of your readers have congratulated
me on receiving the prize money.
While the Koret 112 oundation did indeed
award I isen and me the prize, neither of
us will receive the cash award. The foun
dation does something much better: The
money conies to the I 'niversity for prede
termined purposes.

Ditto on Derrido
Hooray for Emeritus Prof. Robert
Cireer Cohn and his critique of Jacques
Derrida in Tuesday's Daily.
The best response to Derrida's single
minded and humorless determination to
strip meaning away from everything seems
to be simply to laugh at it.
Mv thanks to Cohn for his erudite and
articulate column and for his suggestion
that even in this age we might still find it
necessary to (gasp) believe in something.

Remember lives of Chinese
I was appalled as I read junior Jacinto
Hernandez's comment on the U.S.-led
NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy,
as reported in Wednesday's Daily ("2(H)
gather to protest bombing"). At the same
time, however, I am not totally surprised
as such sentiment seems to prevail in the
U.S. government and media.
Hernandez did not seem to be con
cerned with the lives of the three innocent
Chinese who were killed in the bombing,
as lie yelled, "Keep bombing! More bomb
ing!" This has led me to wonder: if, for
some reason, the three U.S. soldiers who
were captured had been in the Chinese
embassy that day instead of three Chinese
civilians and they were killed as a result of
the bombing, leaving their families and
loved ones behind, would Hernandez's
reaction be different?
Would he, or the U.S. government and
media as well, believe that "the death of
three people" is just a minor cost to pay?
Would words of mere regret rather than
apology, ludicrous excuses such as using a
six-year old map or calling it an unfortu
nate incident and a refusal to investigate
or punish the perpetrators be acceptable
to the American public? Are the lives of
three Chinese civilians worth less than
three American soldiers?
Now if, as Hernandez implied, there is
a higher cause that justifies the killing,
what is it? The bombing has repeatedly
killed many innocent Albanians and
resulted in an innumerable number of
refugees. There is a pattern here — more

and more innocent people seem to suffer
as the bombings continue. After the Alba
nian civilians, after the Chinese embassy,
what next?
I am glad to read that among the
protestors on Tuesday was Emeritus
Statistics Prof. Charles Stein. At least this
still gives me some hope of conscience in
the American public.

Questions for protesters
With reference to your article yester
day, "2(H) gather to protest bombing," I
have two questions to ask the "new-wave"
protesters of NATO's bombing.
Why this sudden burst of voices follow
ing the death of three Chinese persons in
an "accidental" NATO attack? There is
something badly parochial about such an
attitude. Thousands of Kosovars and
Serbs have been affected, but that doesn't
seem to have moved these new-wave
protesters so much until the attack on the
Chinese embassy.
And do these new-wave protesters
have even a tenth of such humanitarian
indignation when it comes to the far
greater human rights violations occurring
around the world? Forget Myanmar,
Indonesia, India, the Sudan — take the
case of China itself. When it comes to
China's own violations of human rights,
say in Tibet, do these very students protest
to anything like the same extent?

There is a certain lack of perspective in
such knee-jerk protests. I am not ques
tioning the validity of the current protests,
but what I am questioning is what seems to
be the very narrow-minded motivation of
these protests. Where is the balance?
Where is the consistency? Can the loss of
three Chinese lives move people to an
extent that the loss >112 thousands of Koso
var lives did not? We all have beams in our
eyes. Let us question ourselves at least as
much as we question others.

Bombing doesn't have benefits
The turn of events around Yugoslavia
reveals the great dangers inherent in con
tinued warfare, and we should thank the
Chinese reaction for sending a wake-up
call around the world.
Much of the American press seems
consumed by the desire to transform itself
into the Ministry of Propaganda: it
denounces Chinese "mobs" and backs the
true lunatics of the piece, who insist on
continued warfare after some useless
"deep regrets." Just after the United
States is relieved to have it's own three
soldiers returned, who can gainsay the
Chinese for anguish over the senseless
killing of three of their journalists and the
wounding of numerous other innocents?
Clinton and NATO offer nothing more
than "sorry," along with inane lectures on
