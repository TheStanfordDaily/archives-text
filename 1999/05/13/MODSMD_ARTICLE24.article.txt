SOFTBALL
■ Saturday: No. 15 Stanford (40-21,
10-6 Pacific Ten Conference at No.
17 California (42-19,11-14).

Stanford and Cal have precari
ous positions in the Pac-10. Both
teams have impressive overall
records, hut hold sixth and fifth
places in the conference respective
ly. Wins against non-conference op
ponents have been relatively easy
for both teams, hut not so in confer
ence games.
Going into the last week of the
regular season, all the Pac-10 teams
are ranked in the top 19. The Pac-10
has been the most competitive con
ference all season.
Earlier in the season, the Bears
split a doubleheader with Stanford
at the Stanford Softball Complex.
Stanford won the first game handily
5-0, but lost 4-3 in the second. These
two teams have played 42 times
against each other with the Bears
leading the all-time series, 36-6.
Still, the games this weekend
take on a whole new meaning. Stan
ford travels to Cal as the higher
ranked team, but of late, the Bears
have been steaming. Last week. Cal
posted its first perfect week of soft
ball. The Bears have won six straight

games — sweeping Sacramento
State. No. IK Oregon and No. 11
Oregon State on the road.
"Cal is a hot team right now,"
said Stanford head coach John
Rittman.
Stanford should watch out for
Bears junior Lisa lancin, who leads
her team in doubles (12), KBls (30)
and runs scored (34) and freshman
pitcher Jocylen Forest who boasts a
1.45 ERA.
Not only is this a big game be
cause of the heated rivalry between
Stanford and Cal, hut the game
could determine what lies ahead for
both teams. With the Pac-10 being
the best conference in soft ball, every
game counts. The Cardinal is hop
ing that two wins against the Bears
will propel it into a better standing in
the PuC-10 and a good seed in the
NCAA regionals.
"I don't know how you can get
any bigger than this weekend's
games," Rittman said.
Stanford's offensive and defen
sive numbers could hold the key to
victory.
The batting numbers for most
teams are almost identical — Stan
ford averages .286 as a team while
Cal averages .277. Significantly,
Stanford holds its opponents to a
.189 while Cal's opponents have
been batting .209.
According to senior shortstop
Michelle Schneider, the split against
Cal in April was a disappointment
loss for the Stanford squad.
"Winning one was unsettling,"
she said. "We have a score to settle
with them. Two victories on their
home field will make it that much
sweeter."
Though there is no potential for
hosting any games during the
NCAA regionals, Stanford anxious
ly anticipates its postseason fate.
