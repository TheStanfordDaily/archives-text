# Polo looks ahead after great season
## Women finish second at nationals, look ahead to next year 
### Mo Eger Contributing writer 
Since its inaugural season as a
varsity sport four years ago, the
Stanford women's water polo team
has placed fifth, fourth, third and
now second at the National Champi
onships. Each year, the team has im
proved in the national standings and
each year the Cardinal has come
closer to bringing home the champi
onship title.
This year. No. 2 Stanford fought
top-ranked IJSC in five unbeliev
able overtime periods before finally
losing 7-6 in sudden death. While
disappointing, especially after such a
long and intense match, the incredi
ble second-place finish is hardly an
ultimate loss for the team.
"You can't ever really have the
goal of winning a National Champi
onship." said head coach John Tan

ner. "You can only intend to be
there and have the right goals that
will get you into the championship
match. At the beginning of the sea
son, we wrote down a list of things
we needed to do. ()ne was that we be
at our best in difficult situations. I
think the game against IJSC was the
most difficult and important of the
season. We lived up to our goal and
played our best game of the year."
The players agree with these sen
timents and have been focusing on
their season-long accomplishments.
"I don't feel like we lost at all,"
said senior captain Lindsay l am. "1
feel like we came out ahead because
we did what we set out to do — play
the best water polo we could and
make Nationals a memorable tour
nament."
" This team was dedicated to win
ning nationals from our first meeting
in September, and the intensity and

effort level of every practice proved
that dedication," said sophomore
Ali Riddell. "Coming that close to
winning and losing after five over
times made the loss very disappoint
ing. but at the same time, the journey
that we all took together was amaz
ing and unforgettable, no matter
what color our medals are."
The Stanford team is small, only
13 players, and extremely close-knit.
The players wanted to win. but they
benefited from experience of the
shared dedication it took to get them
so far this season. The final game was
a culmination of all of the time, de
termination and effort the team put
into practice every day.
"Our championship game against
USC was the most amazing water
polo game I ever seen," said junior
Elissa Keszler. "And even though
we didn't win, I couldn't be more
proud of my teammates. We played

with our hearts and gave it every
thing we had. This whole season, and
especially nationals, has been an in
credible experience. I he best part of
it all is that I got to do it with a group
of people 1 love. 1 couldn't ask for
anything more."
"Never before have I played with
such a phenomenal group of peo
ple," said freshman Kate Pettit. "But
what is most important at the end of
the season is to be able to look in
each and every one of our faces and
know that until the very last second
of that final game, through every
moment since September, we gave
everything we had to this team. And
it showed, not only in the amazing
game we put forth on Sunday, but in
the relationships that we strength
ened and developed over the entire
season."


Coach John Tanner fires up the team in a crucial point in this year's National Championship tournament. The Cardinal went on to place sec
ond behind (JSC to cap off a stellar season.
The fact that Stanford has risen
one spot in the rankings each year
for the past four years, brings up the
question of next year— winning the
national championship.
The three seniors. Tam. Heather
Crary and Nicole Cila/er have been
crucial to Stanford's growth and de
velopment over the past four years
and will certainly be missed. Howev
er. a wealth talent still exists on

this team. The returning players are
already looking towards next sea
son.
"It was great to see that some of
the team has already come down to
the pool to swim and take out the
balls and pass," Tanner said. "'I hey
are-excited about getting to go for it
again next year."
The team is proud of its season
and more importantly, even proud
of its loss to USC.
"Our defense was fantastic," said
sophomore Alii Henry. "We forced
11 JS( | to make amazing shots. They

weren't going to get anything easy
from us. And (Tanner) did a fabu
lous job in mentally preparing us.
We felt like champions. We were
ready to be champions. We played
like champions for nine periods."
The final game seems a reflection
of the talented and dedicated indi
viduals that make up the Stanford
team.
And the Cardinal played like
champions for longer than nine peri
ods.
Stanford played like champions
the entire year.
