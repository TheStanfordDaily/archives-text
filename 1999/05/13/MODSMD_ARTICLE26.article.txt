### Monica Sergott Contributing writer 
The time has come for the men's
and women's crew teams to put forth
the effort and momentum they have
been building this season. They will
race at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships this weekend at Lake
Natoma in Sacramento with a nation
als berth on the line.
The crews will leave early Satur
day morning to practice on the lake
before the competition begins on
Sunday. The dual meets throughout
this season determined the seeding
for the regatta. The women are the
seventh seed and the men are the filth
seed..
Both teams expect to dispel their
low ranking and prove the caliber of
Stanford crew.
The women are bringing their
Varsity Eight, Varsity Four and JV

Eight to the competition, while the
men only will race their Varsity Eight
and Freshman Eight boats.

â–  Sunday: Stanford men and women
will compete in Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships at Lake
Natoma, Sacramento.

Each boat will compete in a pre
liminary heat in the morning. The top
two teams from each heat will ad
vance to the grand final competition,
while the remaining boats will race in
the petite final. The top two women's
and top three men's crews from the
grand final will advance to Nationals,
which will be held in two weeks.
Stanford's Varsity Eight women's
crew look to beat Oregon State in the
morning to advance to the grand fi
nals. Stanford finished eight seconds
behind the Beavers in their last meet
ing.

The women are confident that
they have the potential to beat OSU
due to steady improvement in every
race this season. They have also
changed their line-up and added stel
lar freshman Sami Skupa to their
boat.
Senior Jodi Garton described the
team as feeling "strong and fast" with
the recent changes in the boat.
If the team does not qualify for the
grand finals, they hope to win the pe
tite finals. Six of the nine rowers in the
Varsity eight boat
(composed of eight rowers and one
coxswain) are seniors, giving great
importance to this regatta.
Both the men and women have
been tapering throughout the week
for optimal performance on Sunday.
"T his week we've been working
on shorter, faster pieces and parts of
our technique to bring everything
back into focus," Garton said.
The Stanford Varsity men are pre

pared for a tough race in the finals in
order to secure a spot at nationals.
Their only close competition in the
morning heat is Washington. With a
second-place finish, the men will ad
vance to the grand finals. In the finals,
they will have to have the race of their
season to fulfill their goal of a place in
Nationals.
They need to defeat third-ranked
Oregon State, whom they lost to early
in the season by a distant seven sec
onds.
Junior rower Dan Matross said
the week of tapering has helped the
team gain some of the edge needed
for a good race.
"We have a lot of energy and are
preparing mentally to face OSIJ." lie
said.
Matross believes the field will test
the team and will be a good indicator
for the upcoming competition if they
reach Nationals.
"In the afternoon we're looking to
keep up with the field and hold our

own in the first half of the race. We
hope to move out ahead of OSU in
the third S(X) and push in strong in the
end. We'll be ready to react to the sit
uation," he said.
"We have to go much faster than
we ever have. We've been trving to

swing together and reinforcing what
we've been working on the last few
weeks.
We have to push our hardest to
beat Oregon State, but that's what
we're there for," said junior Will
Smith.
