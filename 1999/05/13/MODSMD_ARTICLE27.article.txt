Men's Soccer
In its strongest performance yet
this spring, the Stanford men's soc
cer team defeated the San Francis
co Bay Seals 3-2 at New Maloney
Field last night.
The Seals are a professional
squad that plays in the A-League
and are affiliated with Major
League Soccer's San Jose Clash.

The game showed promising signs
for the Cardinal.
"Last night's game was definite
ly a big improvement," said Stan
ford head coach Bobby Clark.
"That's been our best game so far,
but we still have work to do."
Stanford went up early as red
shirt junior captain T.K. Inbody
converted a penalty kick early in
the first half. Pressure in the box
caused the Seals to commit a hand
ball, and Inbody used the opportu

nity to place the ball in the lower
left of the net.
After both teams squandered a
few opportunities, the score re
mained 1-0 at the half.
Early in the second half, the
young Stanford front line put the
Cardinal up 2-0. Freshman forward
Mike Murphy sent a perfect pass
through to sophomore Luke Rust,
who slipped the ball by the Seals
keeper.
As the second half progressed,

the intensity of the game seemed to
let down, and the Seals scored two
unanswered goals to tie the game.
"We must be disappointed at
once again surrendering a two-goal
lead, although full marks to the fact
that we were able to raise our game
after that," Clark said.
After the wake up call from the
two Seals' goals, the Cardinal
picked up its play and controlled
the end of the game. Stanford wast
ed a few scoring opportunities, but

Murphy's goal late in the half put
Stanford up for good.
The goal materialized as Mur
phy took the ball from the Seal's
goalie, then fired a strong shot right
past him.
The 3-2 victory is an important
confidence builder as the Cardinal
faces the Clash next Tuesday. May
18, at 7 p.m. at New Maloney field.
Playing against his former team
mates for the Clash will be Stanford
senior Jamie Clark.

The men's soccer program also
announced its freshman class for
1999. The group of six is highlight
ed by two members of the U.S.
Under-18 national team and Pa
rade All Americans, Abe Cieiger
(East Lansing, Mich.) and Johancs
Mali/a (Chicago, III.). In addition
to Cieiger and Maliza the Cardinal
looks forward to the play of Taylor
Ahlgren (Cardiff by the Sea), Todd
Dunivant (Wheat Ridge, Colo.),
Roger Levesque (Falmouth.
Maine) and Andrew Ferris (New
ton, Mass.).
In addition to the freshman.
Stanford also is looking forward to
the addition of Ryan Nelsen. a ju
nior transfer from Greensboro (ol
lege in North Carolina.
Nelsen is a native of New
Zealand and is a member of their
Olympic Team.
For his efforts in leading
Greensboro to the Division 111
Championship game in 1998,
Nelsen was named an AII-Ameri
can.
Women's Soccer
Stanford continued its spring

season play last weekend with a trip
to Portland, where it suffered a 2-1
loss to the under-23 Oregon State
team. This team is comprised main
ly of current and former players
from Portland State University,
who played in the Final Four this
past fall.
Despite the loss, the team was
positive about its performance.
"2-1 is a respectable score as
they were a pretty solid side," said
junior co-captain Jen O'Sullivan.
"To get that result at this point in
the season really took a lot."
The Cardinal went down 2-0 but
kept its composure to put itself
back in the game.
Freshman midfielder Whitney
Berry provided the lone goal for
Stanford.
"We came back with a nice goal
after being down 2-0, and actually
had three or four chances to tie the

game," said Stanford head coach
Steve Swanson.
The result was encouraging after
a disappointing result last week
against the Japanese national team.
While the Cardinal played flat
against Japan, it used the perfor
mance as a motivation for improve
ment in Portland.
"After coming off the loss to the
Japanese national team, which
wasn't a good performance, we got
everything together |this week] and
were fired up and ready to go,"
O'Sullivan said.
The Cardinal looks to keep this
intensity up as it heads into the end
of the spring season.
The final game for the Cardinal
will take place at New Maloney,
May 23 against Santa Clara.
Like Portland State, the Bron
cos reached the national semifinals
in 1998.
