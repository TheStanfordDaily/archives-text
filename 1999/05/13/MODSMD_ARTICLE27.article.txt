Men's Soccer
In its strongest performance yet
this spring, the Stanford men's soc
cer team defeated the San Francis
co Bay Seals 3-2 at New Maloney
Field last night.
The Seals are a professional
squad that plays in the A-League
and are affiliated with Major
League Soccer's San Jose Clash.

The game showed promising signs
for the Cardinal.
"Last night's game was definite
ly a big improvement," said Stan
ford head coach Bobby Clark.
"That's been our best game so far,
but we still have work to do."
Stanford went up early as red
shirt junior captain T.K. Inbody
converted a penalty kick early in
the first half. Pressure in the box
caused the Seals to commit a hand
ball, and Inbody used the opportu

nity to place the ball in the lower
left of the net.
After both teams squandered a
few opportunities, the score re
mained 1-0 at the half.
Early in the second half, the
young Stanford front line put the
Cardinal up 2-0. Freshman forward
Mike Murphy sent a perfect pass
through to sophomore Luke Rust,
who slipped the ball by the Seals
keeper.
As the second half progressed,

the intensity of the game seemed to
let down, and the Seals scored two
unanswered goals to tie the game.
"We must be disappointed at
once again surrendering a two-goal
lead, although full marks to the fact
that we were able to raise our game
after that," Clark said.
After the wake up call from the
two Seals' goals, the Cardinal
picked up its play and controlled
the end of the game. Stanford wast
ed a few scoring opportunities, but

Murphy's goal late in the half put
Stanford up for good.
The goal materialized as Mur
phy took the ball from the Seal's
goalie, then fired a strong shot right
past him.
The 3-2 victory is an important
confidence builder as the Cardinal
faces the Clash next Tuesday. May
18, at 7 p.m. at New Maloney field.
Playing against his former team
mates for the Clash will be Stanford
senior Jamie Clark.

The men's soccer program also
announced its freshman class for
1999. The group of six is highlight
ed by two members of the U.S.
Under-18 national team and Pa
rade All Americans, Abe Cieiger
(East Lansing, Mich.) and Johancs
Mali/a (Chicago, III.). In addition
to Cieiger and Maliza the Cardinal
looks forward to the play of Taylor
Ahlgren (Cardiff by the Sea), Todd
