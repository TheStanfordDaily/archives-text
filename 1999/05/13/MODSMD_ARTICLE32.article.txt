For most people Jasper Ridge Bi
ological Preserve is a place to see
majestic redwoods, exotic plants and
freshwater wetlands. But lor a group
of East Palo Alto teenagers, it is
more than a place to enjoy natural
beauty, thanks to the efforts of Stan
ford senior Zoe Bradbury, who has
made Jasper Ridge a full-fledged
ecological classroom.
Every Tuesday Bradbury takes a
group of 16 students from Fast Palo
Alto's Eastside College Preparatory

School to Jasper Ridge to study
basic ecology and environmental is
sues. She forms a curriculum for the
day with Eastside teacher Monya
Baker, focusing each week on a dif
ferent aspect of the environment.
Bradbury is aided in her instruc
tion by lour Stanford students, all of
whom are docents at Jasper Ridge:
seniors Chris Friedel and Audrey
Chang, sophomore Caleb Bosler
and medical student Ellen Foxman.
These "teaching assistants" help stu
dents learn about ecological issues
and serve as "mentors and role mod

els for the kids." Bosler said.
"The help I have been given has
been wonderful," Bosler said. "With
those four, we are able to almost
have a two-to-one teacher / student
ratio. We can really give the kids the
individual attention needed for
them to learn."
Eastside, with an enrollment of
35 students, is the only high school
within the city limits til East Palo
Alto. The brainchild of Stanford
alumnus Chris Bischoff. the school is
completely funded by venture capi
talists and is free from any public
school board control.
"That was the best part about
starting this program." Bradbur\
said. " There was no school board, so

there was no red tape. I just called
them up. told them my idea and
star led immediately planning how to
put the plan into action."
Because of Eastside's small en
rollment. the ecology teachers have
noticed an unusual sense of cama
raderie between the students, a fac
tor (hat makes teaching the group
extremely easy.
"The atmosphere for teaching is
great. The students aren't catty or
cliquish at all." Bradbury said.
"I have been very impressed with
the students enrolled in the pro
gram." hosier said. "When I think
back to ninth grade, I remember a
lot of disrespect between the stu
dents at my school. But with this
group, it's just the opposite. They
have a tremendous amount of re
spect lor each other and help each
other out when they can."
Because of that willingness to
learn and "help each other out." the
Jasper Ridge teachers have wit
nessed a remarkable growth in the
students* level of comfort with the
environment since the program
started.
"The kids started off really un
comfortable with the outdoors,
scared of stuff like ticks and poison
oak." Friedel said. "Now, after tak
ing some classes, most of them are
getting down on the ground, digging
around and looking at stuff, where
they would have been really appre
hensive before."
"It's very exciting and rewarding
to see them grow so comfortable
with the environment," Bradbury
added.
While the program is currently
only on a trial basis. Bradbury has
plans to make it a full part of the cur
riculum next year, hopelulh increas
ing the number of students and en
listing the help of Stanford faculty.
In addition Bradbury said. ' we will
go to L-'astside once a week to teach
a class there, so the students can see
that their environment is respected
too."
