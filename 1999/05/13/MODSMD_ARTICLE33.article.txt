### Meredith Rowe Staff writer 
The composition of the faculty
and the status of its female mem
bers, along with the University
budget for next year, will head the
Faculty Senate's agenda lor
today's meeting.
The report on professorial gains
and losses, which will be presented
by Robert Weisberg, vice provost
for faculty relations, includes a
number of statistics and graphs
concerning the net gain or loss of
tenured and non-tenured profes
sors in various University depart
ments between September 1997
and September 1998.
Prof. Roger Noll, chair of the
Program in Public Policy, said he
believes the report would be the
highlight of the meeting.
"This will be interesting he
cause faculty gains and losses are
always related to the composition
of faculty, including the number of
women and minorities," he said.
"Affirmative action is a different
issue, but it always seems to come
up when we discuss this."
Provost Condoleezza Rice will
present the reports on the budget
and female faculty.
According to Statistics Prof.
Brad Efron. the senate's chair, the
number of faculty women has dou

bled in the past 10 years. The num
ber of minority faculty has almost
doubled in that time as well.
" This kind of report always pro
duces sharp words on both sides,"
Efron said. "It will be interesting."
Additionally, the Program in
Science, Technology and Society
will be discussed. The senate will
discuss renewing degree-nominat
ing authority for the program.
The program, which awards
bachelor's and master's degrees,
almost ended in 1996 because the
School of Engineering, which ad
ministered the program, did not
seek to renew it. Later that year the
program was taken in by the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, and its degree-granting au
thority was restored.
"This possibility ot renewal is
probably interesting to undergrad
uates, because the program almost
died a few years ago," Noll said.
"This will be an opportunity for
those who fought to save STS to
see the results of their work."
Also on the agenda is a memor
ial resolution for Charles Fergu
son. who died last year. Ferguson
established the Committee on Lin
guistics at Stanford in 1967 and
also helped to initiate a project on
Language Universals, highlights of
which were published by the Stan
ford University Press in 1978. Fer
guson also helped to organize the
Phonology Archive.
Ferguson is survived by his wile.
