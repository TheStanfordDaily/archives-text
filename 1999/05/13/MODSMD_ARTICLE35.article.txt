# THEATER ESSAY
## KISS ME, KILL ME, EAT ME 'Fed Up: A Cannibal's Own Story' at Theatre Rhinoceros 
### 
know what to expect from "Fed
( Gfi Up: A Cannibal's Own Story" when I
read the press release. I'm not too
familiar with the theater world and words like
"burlesque" and references to Shakespeare mean
nothing to me. But what caught my eye was the
fact that the cast was basically black and Latino.
Hey, how bad could it be with a little "color" in it?
And bad it wasn't.
The playwright chose to explore the minds of
four men (two blacks and two Latinos) who are in
interracial homosexual relationships in a comi
cally capricious satire. A satire of what you might
ask? That is one thing that I wasn't quite sure of.
It had something to do with "The Tempest."
The central theme of the play is cannibalism,
which, as the narrator explains, psychologically
means trying to forget something by eating it.
The cast is great. There are six actors in all, five
guys and one girl, with one of the roles performed
by the playwright himself, Ricardo Bracho. I got
the impression that he wasn't supposed to act in
his own play, but it worked. The girl, Saun-Toy
Latifa Trotter, was awesome. She played a narra
tor, dipping in and out of the scenes to add spiri
tual insights and pulling the audience directly
into the play.
Another actor worth mentioning is the only
white actor in the play, John Carl Wartella, who
was hilarious. He played the snobbish dead poet
whom the other actors are accused of eating. His
stage presence was tremendous, his Southern
accent was perfect, and his conceit was extremely
entertaining. The most memorable scene was the
strip club spoof. Three of the male actors get up
to shake their moneymakers for the white guy
with "We Be Clubbin" playing in the background.
The scene was totally unexpected and caught me
off guard. I loved it!
After the play, I got to meet the cast. They all
seemed pretty comfortable with each other (no
diva complexes), and this came across on stage.
The cast is a mixture of novices and vets who
drew on Shakespearean research, personal experi
ence and their relationships with the playwright
to pull the play together. The director noted that
the actors brought a certain amount of intellect to
the play that helped cement its free structure. One
actor said the play was like a croissant in that it
has many layers. I would have to agree with that
analogy, to say the least.
