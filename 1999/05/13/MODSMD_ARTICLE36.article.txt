						Reflection on the dance of lovers 
### Joanna Corman Contributing writer 
S</~ n I l J>l, when my mother turned 13, she would meet her'
CS' d.iiKe partner at the 11 lord Palais on «i I riday night. lor
» ' three and six pence, my mother would listen to the ja//
tunes of ( leo l .me.uul lolinny I )ankvvorth.
I he club, located just outside I oiulon, li.id a crystal ball th.it
splashed light across the ceiling, while my mother would swirl to
the music helow. She was a consummate ballroom dancer —tox-
trot, quickstep, samha and rumha were .ill hers. but one ol her
favorite dances was the tango.
I ridav night, I tried to recreate my mother's past. I went to tango
night at Mcchlel International ( enter, part ol Argentine lango
Week. I he evening featured live tango music, a dance performance,
a lesson and a milong.i, a tango dance parts.
I had pictured the tango as campy and overly dramatic: the cou
ple following their clasped arms, a quick flick of the head and hack
they go. At the end, an onlooker tosses a blood reel rose to the
woman who catches it between her teeth.
There may he elements ol this in the tango, but the dance has a
range of emotion. Sometimes it is filled with such sadness, I want to
grieve tor every time my heart has bet/n broken-. Other times the
music quickens and becomes so cheerful, 1 wish I were wearing the
kind of skit l my mother used to wear, long and layered with petti
coats so it can be flipped on the dance floor, part ol the flirtation
between man and woman.
One element ol the lango remains constant — its sensuality. "It.
looks like they're making love on the dance floor," my friend whis
pered. I ler comment gets at the heart of tango. I he dance came out
of bordellos in buenos Aires in the late INOOs. Sailors would fre
quent brothels and pa\ to dance with prostitutes.
At the bcchtel ( enter a professional Argentine musical trio, I lor
de 'lango, played traditional and modern styles. One of the best
prolession.il dance couples from lUienos Aires, Marcelo Yarela and
An.ilia Vega, showed how perfect the tango can be. Ihe couple
danced in the broadway show, "I orever Tango," and in the movie
"I \ ita."
flic words to main tango songs describe lost love. " I here is no
problem explaining the tango, said Roberto I orle, the ti io's singer.
It's sad." And then lie sang about a chap whose girlfriend left him
tor another man.
I lie tango is a dance that snakes it's wav inside vou and wraps
itself around your soul. Sometimes Yarela and Vega would be quic k,
earnest, sharp. I hen the music would slow down and Yarela would
hold \egas head as she arched it hack. Oi lhe\ would slop, their
bodies in symmetry, and lie would run his hand up and down her
back lo her delight.
I orty years alter she stopped dancing tango at the Illord I'alais,
ill\ mother still remembers. "I just loved the passion-ol it," she said.
I he tango is either verv languid or verv seductive and then all at
oiice there are these quick nio\enients and then vou sti ike a pose.
After the pei foi inaiice, we learned the basic tango step, v\hicli is
a box. While niv niothei s partner was "damn good,' mv partner,
whom I had just met, was clumsy, his palms sweatv. I le couldn't fig
ure out how to varv the steps, so vve made a square, around and
around lot the entire night. IWtf I appreciated his earnestness to
learn. \nd I tooT home Willi nic' a new passion: a passion lor langi>
