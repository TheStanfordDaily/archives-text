# SUPER-TOYS!
## The
						best movie you'll never see FILM INTERVIEW 
### 
s —~~yQ uper-Toys" begins with a dumb-show: we see a tree with $20 bills for
v leaves, government bonds for flowers and diamonds for fruit. Several
naked animals (humans, actually) approach the tree. One begins pruning
the tree of its riches, but another gets jealous and attacks him. Then all the animals kill
each other. But they make good fertilizer. So the tree grows.
"Super-Toys" is full of bizarre parables like these. Screenwriter Brian Aldiss' ("AI")
script is like 100 episodes of the "Twilight Zone" condensed into a little over two
hours. And what might have been a jumble of unrelated themes is made coherent by
David Whitney's ("Flying Padre") superb direction. Whitney uses symmetry and rad
ical lighting effects to make even a man eating a pear seem wildly exciting.
Brad Dourif stars in "Super-Toys" as Harry Hopkins, a hard-drinking priest in the
not-so-distant future. Global warming has intensified, and the entire surface of the
earth is threatened with submersion if the ice caps melt any more. Los Angeles has
already been destroyed by mile-high waves, but the global warming threatens to oblit
erate legitimate cities as well, so Hopkins sets out to save the world. Dourif, who
played Andy Warhol in"The Doors" and is the voice of Chucky in "Child's Play," has
too long been relegated to quirky bit parts — his astounding performance as Hopkins
is equal parts Peter Sellers, Jack Nicholson and James Mason.
In order to save the world, Hopkins enlists the help of his wife, Maggie Trout (in the
future, Catholic priests can have wives), who is played by Helene Trend ("Blood
Simple"). Trout is a robot who works in a chicken soup factory, though neither of
these rather odd facts has any relevance to the plot of the movie. Together, the priest

and his robot wife set out to build a time machine
so that they can go back in time and prevent glob-

al warming from ever beginning.
The plot only gets more complicated after that. Without giving too much away, they
succeed in building the time machine but are thwarted in their efforts to stop global
warming by the President of the United States, who happens to be a tap-dancing
chimpanzee.
There were only two problems with "Super-Toys," and both are unimportant
because it was so enjoyable to watch. First, the special effects were terrible. The back
grounds looked like paintings in a Barring-gaffner exhibit, the scenes of city flooding
were clearly executed using cardboard models, and the chimp President was just an
actor (Kevin Fowler) in a Flalloween costume. Second, the conclusion was abrupt. The
final line comes from the chimp, who says to Hopkins, "You will be gone but not for
gotten." While this tied up some of the movie's themes, "Super-Toys" still seemed trag
ically unfinished.
All in all, 1 hope that "Super-Toys" gets picked up by a distributor for wider the
atrical release. If it goes direct-to-video, American audiences will have been deprived
of an underground masterpiece.
