# EVEN HITLER HAD A GIRLFRIEND
## An interview with Dr. Frank of the Mr. T Experience 
### Jung Lah Contributing writer 
r - Frank has been the lead singer, guitarist and
[TyJJ songwriter for The Mr. T Experience (or
"MTX") since the band played its first show in
October 1985 at New Method in Oakland. A pioneer of
the East Bay pop punk sound and a Gilman Street
[Berkeley's grassroots all-ages punk club] staple from the
get go, Dr. Frank has just released his first solo album on
Lookout Records called "Show Business Is My Life." It fea
tures country, bossa nova, straight ahead rock V roll and
'60s beat music as well as the inevitable pop punk flavor.
Here's what he had to say about the new record, MTX
and the current music scene.
Intermission: Why did you decide to do a solo
album?
Dr. Frank: I've been do ; ng records with some form
of The Mr. T Experience for 13 years, so I thought it
might be kind of fun to try something where I was
basically the band. I've been sort of gearing up to it for
quite a while. The original conception of it was not as
ambitious as a whole album. There'd always been songs
that MTX didn't do for one reason or another, and they
all came from different origins — the bastards of songs
written for "Love Is Dead" or "Revenge Is Sweet And So
Are You" and songs I wrote for other bands that didn't
end up doing them. After a while, I ended up with a
whole bunch of songs I wanted to do, and as always, my
attitude towards the songs is that I've gotta do 'em
because no one else will.
I: Are you still going to do stuff with MTX?
Dr. F: Yeah, we're just finishing up the new record.
The solo project was just sort of a fun thing to do on
the side.
I: The sound on the solo record is different from
MTX. What do you think about how it came out?
Dr. F: When you have a rock 'n' roll band, you gotta
make sure that a significant number of your songs are
rock 'n' roll songs — loud and fast and maybe even a
little dumb. But when you don't have that requirement
and nobody expects anything more than strumming

your guitar and singing about how you wanna kill
yourself or whatever you expect a singer / songwriter
to do, a lot more subtlety can come out. Massive blar
ing rhythm guitars can cover up everything, and I love
music like that, but there's always been a part of me
that's wanted to do something else.
I: So do you think fans of MTX will be into the new
stuff? Does it have broader appeal than your usual
audience?
Dr. F: I don't know what kind of appeal this will
have. Theoretically, you might think it would, but
there's sort of a perverse situation when you're talking
about a band like us and a label like Lookout Records
... to an extent, the audience expects a certain type of
sound. They don't buy a record to necessarily be sur
prised by what's on it, it's like when you turn on the
wrestling on TV, you know what you're gonna get. And

I understand why people think that way, but I've never
wanted my band to be doing that, and I'm disappoint
ed that people were taking it that way. It's like, how
much pop punk do you want? Oh? Let me chop off
about six minutes or so. So theoretically, I suppose if
you don't [think] like that, you can understand what's
going on in the record a little better, but I suppose
there's also an issue of credibility. A guy like me is sort
of going out on a limb a little bit in doing something
like that because people have to suspend their disbelief
when they're listening to it and believe it's the real
thing. I mean, I think it is, but I wouldn't be surprised
if some people were skeptical about it. We'll just have
to wait and see. When you have something that you've
never done before, you never know what's going to
happen, and that's what makes recording and playing
all the more interesting than just an ordinary job.
I: I know you've done a few shows for the new
record. How has the material been coming off live? Do
you do MTX songs?
Dr. F: I usually try to keep things pretty loose. The
last few shows that I've done have ended up maybe
one-third MTX songs, one-third songs off of the solo
record and a handful of random things. If someone
really wants to request a song, I'll usually do it if I
remember how it goes. Some of those old MTX songs
are really cool as folk songs, I mean that's how a lot of
them started out before they got run through the punk
geyser. One of the things about playing as a solo per
former is there's less distance between you and the
audience, which is scary in some ways, but you can
really tell whether what you're doing is working or not
... but it all depends on the audience, I never really
write out a playlist.
I: You've been around the music business awhile.
