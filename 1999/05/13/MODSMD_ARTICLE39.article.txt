## Japanese Mythology 101: A Beginner's Guide to the Boredoms 
### Dave Jang 
The lead singer, Eye, used to be in this band where all the
members would do was break things on stage and scream.
One night he runs out of the club where the band's playing,
hotwires a bulldozer and drives it straight into the wall of the club."
"I hear he tried to sneak a bomb into a show and set it to go off in the audi
ence during his set, but he was stopped by the club's security. The Boredoms
used to pass out consent forms at their shows saying they wouldn't be respon
sible for any injury or death that occured during their performances ..."
"It's no wonder that there was a tour bus driver in America that wouldn't go
near the band without his .45."
These were the kinds of stories that floated about the nighttime air around
me as I stood in the middle of a wet, grassy outdoor theater, waiting for the sub-

ject of all these gossippings to take the stage. These
were the stories I had followed hundreds of miles,
hitchhiking from the sweltering August heat of Tokyo
to the frigid mountain air of Nagano without so
much as a sleeping bag. It was the mythology, more
than anything, that had enticed me to Vitamin Q in
Nagano, a nonstop three-day festival of open air
trance rock and electronica hosted by one of Japan's
most infamous bands, the Boredoms.
I would have been disappointed by the event had I
gone looking only for the blood which flows so freely
in the lore I'd heard about the band, but the spectacle
of the audience lounging restively around the
amphitheater and the surrounding campground was
enough to convince me that the Boredoms' interna
tional reputation must be well deserved. This was not
the Olympic Nagano of pastel pageantry I'd seen on
NBC that winter. Instead, it looked like someone had
crammed a stick into the Japanese underground and
given it a vigorous shake. All the neo-psych hippies
and trance rock junkie that found themselves within
the bounds of the Japanese archipelago had congre
gated on that hillock in the wooded mountains of
Nagano to see the Boredoms. My traveling compan
ion, a native of Hawaii, bummed a cigarette off of a
dreadlocked Israeli national sprawled on the grass
beside him as the three Tokyo residents we'd eventu
ally hitch a ride back to the city with continued to
toss around tidbits of Boredoms mythology as they
pitched their tent behind us:
"Yoshimi, the drummer, has an uncle with ESP ...
Or was it her grandfather?"
"Someone told me all my favorite Boredoms song
titles were actually some kind of code with supernat
ural meaning. Like '0 OR 1ERS' or 'Boredom With
God on Noise'."

Those three days in the mountains, surrounded by vague implyings and
rumors of rumors such as these marked the beginning of a sort of obsession, a
need to find out if the rumors were true.
Intermission: It seems like fantastic stories follow you wherever you go.
About bulldozers and bombs, for instance. But no one knows the details. Are
there any stories among the Boredoms lore that you're particularly proud off
I bet you hear lots of stories about yourself that aren't true. Do they make you
laughi Do they scare youf
Yoshimi: There're so many funny stories. We can laugh at them afterwards,
that is.
Whether the stories about the Boredoms' insane salad days are true or not,
you could never know simply by looking at the band of today. Indeed, perhaps

some of the mystique that surrounds the band results from the relish with
which the group imbibes change, slipping into a new shape or sound just when
their listeners begin to think they've gotten used to their old tricks. Perhaps
unsatisfied or simply bored with driving construction vehicles through walls
with his noise band Hanatarashi, Eye Yamatsuka (a.k.a. Eye Yamataka,
Yamantaka, Yamatouka, etc.) founded the Boredoms in his native Osaka, Japan,
in the spring of 1986. Besides Eye, however, the lineup of the band was com
pletely different than it is today, and all that remains of the first incarnation of
the Boredoms is a single titled "Anal by Anal" — and a handful of stories.
Current members Hira (bass) and Seiichi Yamamoto (guitars) joined by the
end of the year, and when drummer / trumpeter Yoshimi P-We (the only female
currently in the group) joined in 1988, the core of the Boredoms as we know
them today was in place.
"... They used to have this woman in the band whose only job was to dance

around like crazy at the shows. 1 hey called her God
Mama."
"When they used to have two vocalists, Eye and
the other guy would go nuts onstage and run into
each other, beat each other up until they were all
bloody. Later the second singer quit to start a grind
metal band with taiko."
The Boredoms' music was, from the start, difficult
to describe. Flitting schizophrenically from painful
bursts of noise to punk grooves, nonsensical
screechings and warblings to trumpet ditties, the
Boredoms seemed intent on alienating just about
every audience they could think of. On the other
hand, they had their spectacularly manic live shows
going for them, not to mention the ever-present
rumors. By the early '90s their infamy had spread to
America, leading to collaborations with groups like
Sonic Youth and garnering the respect of Nirvana
and the Beastie Boys. Warner Brothers Records, per
haps spotting an opportunity to capitalize on the
Boredoms' current cache of hip, made the unprece
dented move of giving a Japanese noise-punk band
a major-label home in America. The results were
predictably disastrous. Warner ended up distribut
ing more promo copies of an early release to radio
stations and magazines for free than they sold at
retail. Aquarius — San Francisco's oldest indepen
dent record store (27 years and counting) — got rid
of a special section they had long reserved for the
Boredoms' records. "There wasn't much point. You
could find their used records everywhere, lying
around in discount bins," recalls Aquarius's Allan
Horrocks. "It was like,'God, all these Boredoms CDs
sitting there with holes punched out of their cases.' "
Still, the Boredoms had their stalwart supporters,

and even if many didn't like the Boredoms' music, no

one could ignore it once they heard it. "The Boredoms were one of the first
[Japanese] bands that everyone first got into," continues Allan. "You'd listen to
the Boredoms, then hear about other bands from over there, and then you'd see
there's this whole world of bands from Osaka and Japan."
The Boredoms brought the Japanese underground to light in grand fashion
when they joined the 1994 Lollapallooza tour. The CDs may have lay unsold in
the stores, but the band's kinetic exhibitionism onstage won Japanese noise
plenty of new fans in America. And the stories continued to spread ...
"I love these guys. Did you know that their woman drummer plays in a band
with Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Julie Cafritz of Pussy Galore and Marc Ibold
of Pavement?"
"They all play in a bunch of other bands. They say the guitar player,
Yamamoto, is in more bands than anyone else in Japan. He's in like a dozen at
a time, and they're always changing."
