## Japanese Mythology 101: A Beginner's Guide to the Boredoms 
### Dave Jang 
The lead singer, Eye, used to be in this band where all the
members would do was break things on stage and scream.
One night he runs out of the club where the band's playing,
hotwires a bulldozer and drives it straight into the wall of the club."
"I hear he tried to sneak a bomb into a show and set it to go off in the audi
ence during his set, but he was stopped by the club's security. The Boredoms
used to pass out consent forms at their shows saying they wouldn't be respon
sible for any injury or death that occured during their performances ..."
"It's no wonder that there was a tour bus driver in America that wouldn't go
near the band without his .45."
These were the kinds of stories that floated about the nighttime air around
me as I stood in the middle of a wet, grassy outdoor theater, waiting for the sub-

ject of all these gossippings to take the stage. These
were the stories I had followed hundreds of miles,
hitchhiking from the sweltering August heat of Tokyo
to the frigid mountain air of Nagano without so
much as a sleeping bag. It was the mythology, more
than anything, that had enticed me to Vitamin Q in
Nagano, a nonstop three-day festival of open air
trance rock and electronica hosted by one of Japan's
most infamous bands, the Boredoms.
I would have been disappointed by the event had I
gone looking only for the blood which flows so freely
in the lore I'd heard about the band, but the spectacle
of the audience lounging restively around the
amphitheater and the surrounding campground was
enough to convince me that the Boredoms' interna
tional reputation must be well deserved. This was not
the Olympic Nagano of pastel pageantry I'd seen on
NBC that winter. Instead, it looked like someone had
crammed a stick into the Japanese underground and
given it a vigorous shake. All the neo-psych hippies
and trance rock junkie that found themselves within
the bounds of the Japanese archipelago had congre
gated on that hillock in the wooded mountains of
Nagano to see the Boredoms. My traveling compan
ion, a native of Hawaii, bummed a cigarette off of a
dreadlocked Israeli national sprawled on the grass
beside him as the three Tokyo residents we'd eventu
ally hitch a ride back to the city with continued to
toss around tidbits of Boredoms mythology as they
pitched their tent behind us:
"Yoshimi, the drummer, has an uncle with ESP ...
Or was it her grandfather?"
"Someone told me all my favorite Boredoms song
titles were actually some kind of code with supernat
ural meaning. Like '0 OR 1ERS' or 'Boredom With
God on Noise'."

Those three days in the mountains, surrounded by vague implyings and
rumors of rumors such as these marked the beginning of a sort of obsession, a
need to find out if the rumors were true.
Intermission: It seems like fantastic stories follow you wherever you go.
About bulldozers and bombs, for instance. But no one knows the details. Are
there any stories among the Boredoms lore that you're particularly proud off
I bet you hear lots of stories about yourself that aren't true. Do they make you
laughi Do they scare youf
Yoshimi: There're so many funny stories. We can laugh at them afterwards,
that is.
Whether the stories about the Boredoms' insane salad days are true or not,
you could never know simply by looking at the band of today. Indeed, perhaps

some of the mystique that surrounds the band results from the relish with
which the group imbibes change, slipping into a new shape or sound just when
their listeners begin to think they've gotten used to their old tricks. Perhaps
unsatisfied or simply bored with driving construction vehicles through walls
with his noise band Hanatarashi, Eye Yamatsuka (a.k.a. Eye Yamataka,
Yamantaka, Yamatouka, etc.) founded the Boredoms in his native Osaka, Japan,
in the spring of 1986. Besides Eye, however, the lineup of the band was com
pletely different than it is today, and all that remains of the first incarnation of
the Boredoms is a single titled "Anal by Anal" — and a handful of stories.
Current members Hira (bass) and Seiichi Yamamoto (guitars) joined by the
end of the year, and when drummer / trumpeter Yoshimi P-We (the only female
currently in the group) joined in 1988, the core of the Boredoms as we know
them today was in place.
"... They used to have this woman in the band whose only job was to dance

around like crazy at the shows. 1 hey called her God
Mama."
"When they used to have two vocalists, Eye and
the other guy would go nuts onstage and run into
each other, beat each other up until they were all
bloody. Later the second singer quit to start a grind
metal band with taiko."
The Boredoms' music was, from the start, difficult
to describe. Flitting schizophrenically from painful
bursts of noise to punk grooves, nonsensical
screechings and warblings to trumpet ditties, the
Boredoms seemed intent on alienating just about
every audience they could think of. On the other
hand, they had their spectacularly manic live shows
going for them, not to mention the ever-present
rumors. By the early '90s their infamy had spread to
America, leading to collaborations with groups like
Sonic Youth and garnering the respect of Nirvana
and the Beastie Boys. Warner Brothers Records, per
haps spotting an opportunity to capitalize on the
Boredoms' current cache of hip, made the unprece
dented move of giving a Japanese noise-punk band
a major-label home in America. The results were
predictably disastrous. Warner ended up distribut
ing more promo copies of an early release to radio
stations and magazines for free than they sold at
retail. Aquarius — San Francisco's oldest indepen
dent record store (27 years and counting) — got rid
of a special section they had long reserved for the
Boredoms' records. "There wasn't much point. You
could find their used records everywhere, lying
around in discount bins," recalls Aquarius's Allan
Horrocks. "It was like,'God, all these Boredoms CDs
sitting there with holes punched out of their cases.' "
Still, the Boredoms had their stalwart supporters,

and even if many didn't like the Boredoms' music, no

one could ignore it once they heard it. "The Boredoms were one of the first
[Japanese] bands that everyone first got into," continues Allan. "You'd listen to
the Boredoms, then hear about other bands from over there, and then you'd see
there's this whole world of bands from Osaka and Japan."
The Boredoms brought the Japanese underground to light in grand fashion
when they joined the 1994 Lollapallooza tour. The CDs may have lay unsold in
the stores, but the band's kinetic exhibitionism onstage won Japanese noise
plenty of new fans in America. And the stories continued to spread ...
"I love these guys. Did you know that their woman drummer plays in a band
with Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Julie Cafritz of Pussy Galore and Marc Ibold
of Pavement?"
"They all play in a bunch of other bands. They say the guitar player,
Yamamoto, is in more bands than anyone else in Japan. He's in like a dozen at
a time, and they're always changing."


The Boredoms and their "in-your-face" rock 'n roll
Intermission: How many side projects does each member have, anyways?
How does everyone manage to balance individual projects and the Boredomsf
Do you ever have problems deciding how to do things as a group?
Yoshimi: Eye does a lot of solo stuff and also DJs a lot. Yamamoto's in Rovo,
Omoide Hatoba and a bunch of others. I guess he's in the most. Hira and Eda
(our new drummer) do this trance jam unit called AOA. I'm in Free Kitten with
Kim Gordon and play guitar and sing in 00100, my all-female new wave
band. Doing lots of bands at once just seems natural to us; we aren't aware of
"balancing" anything. We also don't really "decide" things. We just sit back and
let them happen.
Intermission: The Boredoms have toured all over the world, released
records all over and collaborated with artists overseas. You're even married to
an American, Yoshimi! It's as if the Boredoms don't give a damn about nation
al borders. What kind of obstacles, personal or professional, have you run into
when crossing physical borders?
Yoshimi: No matter where we are, when we're making music, that's all there
is; no other considerations. It's when we're not making music that things get
complicated — no matter where we are.

For all the Boredoms' power to inspire awe in live performance, the band's
recorded experiments don't lose anything to its onstage creations. On top of a
string of albums such as Soul Discharge (1991), "Pop Tatari" (1992) and
"Chocolate Synthesizer" (1995), the group devised a series of EPs under the title
of "Super Roots" in order to further exploit its prolific creative fancies. Released
intermittently between full-length recordings since 1993, some see
the "Super Roots" series as group frontman Eye's plaything, his
chance to fiddle with the mixer knobs between "real albums". Each
installment, however, provides the band with an invaluable
opportunity, a stage on which to test possible future versions of
themselves. Despite the band's penchant for frenetic motion
onstage, the Boredoms recorded "Super Roots 5" while laying
band members lay on their backs in the studio after only one run
through. The result was a one-track EP, an unbroken 64 minute
and 14 second celebration of pure psychedelic sound, lackadaisi
cal percussion wading through murky walls of guitar noise, noise
that should irritate but instead, inexplicably, exhilarates. "Super
Roots 5" changed the way some people think about music, includ
ing the Boredoms themselves.
Intermission: Out of all your many records, which do you
think is required listening for understanding the Boredoms of
today?
Yoshimi: I have a feeling that it was when we put out "Super
Roots 5" that we turned down a different road.
Gradually, the violent confrontationalism of noise gave way to
the bliss of psychedelia, and the Boredoms transformed them
selves from Noise Punks to Acid Punks.
"They dropped acid for the first time when they toured the U.S.

with Brutal Truth and the Pain Teens."
"I read somewhere that Eye went to Peru and ate some hallucino
genic plant. Ended up meeting some bird men who taught him how
to pilot their UFO, or something like that."
Intermission: Recent Boredoms is often described as "psychedel
ic". Do you think that fits? Are your music or cover illustrations and
videos inspired by hallucinogenics? I've heard about Eye's experi
mentation, but do the other members look for something in drug
induced experiences?
Yoshimi: The Boredoms are psychedelic. We think of ourselves as
Acid Punk. If people who are into drugs can also be into our music,
that's fine. Other than that, we're not looking for anything from
drugs.
The Boredoms that I saw in Nagano, the Boredoms of the group's
latest full-length album, "Super AE," are these Acid Punks. On record,
they stretch the vocabulary of rock to the breaking point in 10-
minute epics of guitar cacophony, tape manipulation, near-incoher
ent chanting and intricately layered percussion from three separate
drummers. Their songs emerge from repetitive drones which build
up tension until it's palpable or lull the listener into unawares before
imploding into an inverted rhythm or a devastating silence. If the

band's album takes the senses to the brink, however, its live perfor
mance equates to overload. An hour-long set might consist of only one or two
songs strung seamlessly together, mantras of percussion and chanting repeated
tirelessly and with almost religious persistence, all the while enveloped in a haze
of ecstatic half-organic, half-machine tones.
By the time the last sounds of the Boredoms had faded from the PAs mount
ed on the stage of the amphitheater, it felt like the entire three days of the festi
val had elapsed — but no one looked tired; no one wanted to go home. They
continued to beg for more, but the Boredoms responded with silence. They
knew what the audience had come for, and they knew to leave them wanting
more. Best to leave them out there chattering on into the night, endlessly trad
ing their stories, adding to the canon of Boredoms mythology.
Intermission: The Boredoms are finally heading back to America on tour
this June. It's been a while since you were last here, but more than that, you've
changed so much since then. What can we look forward to from you?
Yoshimi: How will you react to seeing us play? How will we make you feel?
Look forward to yourselves.
My obsession with the Boredoms began with an urge to unravel the lore
behind the group, a desire to distinguish between truth and fiction. It was a
project doomed from the beginning. The details are too scattered, the sources
too vague, and even asking the subject of the stories themselves doesn't help. If
the band members know the answers, they aren't telling. But Yoshimi reminds
us of that the real value of mythology is the same as the thrill of music itself: It's
never a question of true or false, good or bad but of exactly whatever signifi
cance you attatch to it. It's a matter of whatever moves you.
