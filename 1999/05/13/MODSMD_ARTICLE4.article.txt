# Medical school minority student enrollment up
## Rates rebound from 1996-97 
### Mariam Ali Contributing writer 
Stanford Medical School's mi
nority enrollment and matricula
tion rates are rebounding after a
two-year slump.
After Proposition 209 passed in
19%, banning affirmative action in
all governmental institutions,
Stanford admissions rates dropped
by approximately 25 percent and
matriculation rates dropped by al
most 50 percent, according to a
University of California research
project released in April.
The trends at Stanford were
mirrored at University of Califor
nia schools, which experienced a
30 percent reduction in minority

admissions and matriculations.
Researchers speculate that the
publicity over the passing of
Proposition 209 may have dissuad
ed minority applicants from con
sidering Stanford, even though as a
private institution, Stanford is not
subject to the law. Stanford contin
ues to use race and economic dis
advantage as admissions criteria.
"We were really worried in 19%
and 1997," Director of Medical
School Admissions Gabriel Garcia
said. "Although we offered about
as many acceptances in 1996 and
1997 as we had before, minority
applications and matriculates just
went down."
The drops in the number of ap
plicants from University of Cali
fornia schools also affects Stan
lord. according to Garcia. The
University of California under
graduate schools "are out biggest
pipeline, and if minorities don't
graduate from there, we lose a lot
of good applicants," he said.
Stanford pre-medical students
say that Proposition 209 is very dis
couraging, even if it does not apply
to Stanford.
"It is a case of monkey see
monkey does,' " sophomore Lind
say Gervacio said. "You see all of
these minorities not applying or
dropping out of the medical school,
and you think — why should I
apply? If others can't make it, what
chance is there for me?"
The Undergraduate Advising
Center says its pre-med advising
policies have not changed due to
the new law.
"But if a minority student is a
marginal case, we might point out
that the California schools no
longer take race into considera

tion," Senior Advising Consultant
Ruby Mason said.
Stanford Medical School, in
conjunction with the Center for Ex
cellence, a minority faculty devel
opment program, has been work
ing to boost minority interest in
medical schools. The two institu
tions run a science program that
gives economically disadvantaged
high school and college students a
chance to explore medical issues
over the summer. A new program
that will encourage grade school
aged children's interest in medical
sciences has also just been
launched.
"Our desire is to enhance the
number of well-qualified minority
applicants through an earlier en
richment experience," Garcia said.
We recognize that we need to
graduate a group of students that
will feel comfortable delivering
care to everyone in California,
which is a diverse place," Garcia
added. "That is what we are trying
to do."
