## THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS Case Personal Conversation 
### 
ack in 1996, it was easy to confuse newcomer artist
Case with the veteran singer K-Ci of the group
Jodeci. After all, their names are similar and they
both performed duets with — and dated — Mary J. Blige, the
Queen of Hip Hop. But, three years later, after Jodeci's break
up and the success of Case's hit song "Touch Me Tease Me"
from the soundtrack for"The Nutty Professor" backed up by
an equally succesful self-titled debut album, listeners have
come to appreciate the difference between the two artists.
Case's sophomore album "Personal Conversation" sets the
record straight once and for all, proving that Case's style is all
his own.
Case's music was first described by Vibe magazine as an
"R&B / rap crossover" that blurs "the line between R&B and
hip hop heavy rap songs" with "slowed-up hip hop beats." That
may have been true of the first album, but "Personal
Conversation" is pure R&B. The roughly sensual vocals laid
over hip hop and dance beats have disappeared. In their place,
Case sings with a smooth sweetness over slow ballad music.
"Faded Pictures," Case's hit duet with singer Joe, both

laments and wonders about a shattered and lost love that
leaves the singer with nothing but "faded pictures set in bro
ken glass" to remember it by.
"Happily Ever After" expresses the hope that a current rela
tionship can turn into a happy marriage: "Couldn't we be hap
pliy ever after? / We could be strong together for so long. /
Couldn't we be happily ever after? / Me and you ever 'til forev
er's gone." "He Don't Love You" is a sultry persuasion. Case
sings to a woman who is wasting her time on a man who does
n't return her love. In an effort to get her to dump her
boyfriend and choose him instead he tells her, "I've been won
dering / trying to figure out why you still love him / he don't
love you."
"Personal Conversation" is an album of slow jams, an
album dedicated to love. Each songs forms a part of the ongo
ing conversation on love and romance that the album con
ducts and describes a different aspect and stage in the male
female relationship.
