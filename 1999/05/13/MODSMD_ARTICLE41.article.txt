# A 						CONCERT PROPELLED BY 'ROCKET' FUEL
## Love and Rockets electrify the Edge 
### 
onsidering that I had never listened
\—/&?) to a Love and Rockets CD, I think
it's especially telling that I thor
oughly enjoyed the band's live performance
May 3 at The Edge in Palo Alto. I had won
tickets through Channel 104.9 ("music for the
rest of us"), and I was more than happy to
attend the concert for free. I had a crash
course on the band via its home page and var
ious other music sites dedicated to it over the
past 14 years. Then 1 attended the show —
and boy do they know how to rock.
Love and Rockets, whose three members
originated from the seminal goth-rock band
Bauhaus, came into existence in 1985 with the
release of an album overseas. The
Northampton, England group proceeded to
release six CDs in the United states, and Love
and Rockets managed to touch on most — if
not all — of them during the concert.
At times, it was hard to distinguish what
exactly was happening on stage and what we
were hearing. The Edge does not offer bands
much room to operate on stage, so Love and
Rockets opted for multiple strobe lights to
energize its songs. These strobes were pierc
ing, yet they fit perfectly into the group's dri
ving, methodical pieces. Plus, we had tons of
cooled smoke filtering in to make the scene
more atmospheric and moody.
Some of the songs lasted upwards of 10 or
15 minutes, as we merely listened to a cyclic,

though chaotic, rhythm of guitar and drums
sans vocals. Drummer Kevin Haskins proved
to be a solid performer with his metronome
like beat and long-ranging endurance.
Lead singer Daniel Ash, who also lent his
talents on guitar and alto sax, has one of the
most distinct voices I've heard in a while. It's a
bit like David Bowie or Liam Gallagher in that
you can definitely hear that British wail in the
mix, but there's something more substantial
that makes the listener hone in and focus on
the songs. Even when you can't understand all
the words, the psychedelic nature of the guitar
riffs has you in a frenetic daze.
Chiming in was bass guitarist David Jay,
who assisted in some songs but mostly looked
stoic behind his sunglasses. "RIP 20 C., n which
is off the band's latest CD, "Lift," featured a
powerful and effective beat that woke up those
who might have been stoned or drunk.
Equally soulful and techno-electronica driven
were "Here Come the Comedown" and
"Fever," both singles from the band's 1996
album "Sweet F.A."
But the peppier, dance-pop songs of the
'80s made nearly everyone sing jubilantly.
"Mirror People" and "No New Tale to Tell,"
taken from 1987's "Earth Sun Moon," had
young and old audience members bouncing
their heads and mouths in unison. "Kundalini
Express" of 1986's "Express" was a gothic trip,
and "Yin and Yang and the Flower Pot Man"-

what's with that title? — had a hypnotic rush
that was reminiscent of U2 during its edgier
days.
And, of course, Love and Rockets snuck in
its biggest song, "So Alive," from its 1989 self
entitled album which went gold. But Love and
Rockets never really sold out to mainstream
radio, choosing instead to remain under
ground and play in smaller venues like The
Edge.
Unfortunately the band is breaking up next
week following performances at The Roxy in
L.A., and it was almost fitting to have it close
with "Ball of Confusion." Love and Rockets
repeated one of its lines, "and the beat goes
on," multiple times. It was almost a nod to
fans and non-fans alike that Love and Rockets
has made a discernable mark on the music
industry, and not even the disbanding of its
group can remove that influence.
As a side note, IBOPA (short for
Indestructible Beat Of Palo Alto) opened for
"Love and Rockets." I have to say that I've
never seen a singer stick a microphone into his
mouth while getting humped from behind by
his accordion player. IBOPA also made use of
an electric flute and tenor sax. Basically, it was
too much to handle at once, and the band ulti
mately suffered for its ingenuity.
