P ets ? Saturday at Masonic Auditorium as part of the San Francisco
Jazz Festival, vocalist Cassandra Wilson and her six-piece band (two gui
tars, bass, drums, piano and percussion) tried to answer such a question. The per
formance was consistently strong and often moving — although devotion to the
legendary late trumpeter / band leader was hardly slavish.
Ever since she abandoned traditional jazz in the early '90s for a more modern
mix of folk, bop, country blues and pop, the amber-voiced Wilson has achieved
considerable critical and popular success. A cynic might accuse her of abandoning
her roots to cater to the ever-lucrative adult contemporary market, but truthfully,

her voice is so distinctively dark and rich that she

could sing nursery rhymes and still "matter" artis-

tically. This fact has allowed her to cover Van
Morrison, Neil Youne. loni Mitchell and even

▼ IVIIIJUU, liwii lUUllg) fVJ 111 1«A1 Vvl IV. 11 auu trill
the Monkees without raising too many disap
proving eyebrows within the jazz community.

Indeed, her crossover attempts have ele
vated her from obscurity to being labeled
(by Time magazine) "the most accom-

plished jazz vocalist of her generation."
The concert mirrored her latest release,
"Traveling Miles," which focuses on

pieces either written or performed

by Davis. The corner
stone of the album is
"Run The VooDoo
Down," on which
Wilson adds lyrics to the
classic track from
Davis's fusion master
piece, "Bitches' Brew."
The idea of turning a
sound collage into a tra
ditional song may sound

counter-intuitive, but Wilson and her band solved this conundrum by staying true
more to the atmosphere of the song than the notes themselves. When she sings that
"Wherever you go / You must never forget / The way home," one can believe that
Miles may have been thinking of something similar.
Other numbers which stuck out were an elegant version of Wayne Shorter's
"Never Broken (ESP)" (to which she has also added lyrics) and a rolling version of
"When The Sun Goes Down," a Wilson original. Another original, "Right Here,
Right Now," moves the band into easy listening country, but once again Wilson's
vibrant singing saves the day.
For her encore, Wilson performed Cyndi Lauper's understated gem, "Time After
Time," a song which was canonized when Davis covered it back in the '80s. While
Wilson has often covered pop standards to broaden her audience, this performance
was a perfect, bittersweet marriage between Wilson's deep, resonant voice and
Lauper's surprisingly delicate writing.
In general, the band provided a competent backdrop to Wilson's vision.
Although bassist Lonnie Plaxico tended to disappear at times, drummer Marcus
Baylor was a polyrhythmic wonder, carrying the group on his able shoulders
through every rough patch. Instrumentally, the band used everything but brass and
winds — including steel drums, marimba, classical guitar and even a dobro.
Why this tribute to Davis survived without horns is an open question.
Truthfully, Miles Davis is so fundamental to any understanding of modern jazz that
honoring him is a bit like honoring oxygen or the sun — somehow silly and nec
essary at the same time.
On the other hand, while Davis was a virtually peerless performer, his true
strength came as a leader and innovator. The cover to "Bitches Brew" reads
"Directions in Music by Miles Davis," and accordingly Davis's true inheritors are all
musicians willing to find, in Ralph Gleason's words, "a different beauty." Cassandra
Wilson has a different beauty in her voice, and although her music is not stub
bornly pushing the boundaries of jazz, her elegance, dignity and power are quali
ties rarely found in today's musical world.
