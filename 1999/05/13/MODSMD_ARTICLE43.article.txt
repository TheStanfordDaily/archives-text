# DR. FRANK, FROM PG. 5

### 
since you first started playingf
Dr. F: I've sort of been out of touch with the scene. I think
that punk rock has finally become mainstream. There was a
period when it was the mainstream, and that lasted about
two minutes. Now, the influence of that and the fact that
chart-topping pop hits can have really loud guitars in them is
the main effect of that. There's a certain level of show busi
ness that most people who play music never get within a mile
of, and [for] most people like me it has nothing to do with
their world. Some things have influenced us a little, like the
fact that [ex-labelmates] Green Day made it big, that our
label became a little more stable so we could try to do more
things. And maybe it set the stage for people to pay more
attention so that if trends continued, it would have been a
box you'd be in where everyone would expect every record of
yours to sound exactly the same, the Fat Wreck Chords syn
drome, where the quality control of creating a product that
the specific public wants to buy is so complete and so effec
tive that the records are practically identical. But for most
people, that just doesn't affect them, and we can do pretty
much whatever we want because nobody's career and liveli
hood is riding on what we do. For a band like us, whatever's
happening on the sort of thing that would get covered on
Entertainment Tonight is not relevant. Tastes in music are
cyclical. What makes good pop music is good pop songs. It
feels like more than ever before, you can create a career as a
pop star without any songs, and that makes music boring.
Nobody's interested in the garbage they're putting out, and
there's always been bad stuff on the charts, but there's some
point where everyone's going to say, "This sucks." Up to a few
years ago, I would use the word "punk" without quotations
marks, but now, finally, the word "punk rock" has become
completely meaningless.
I: You've historically been on Lookout Records. Has a

move to a major label ever been an issue?
Dr. F: Not in any real serious way. Periodically, somebody
contacts us, but I've never taken it real seriously. Most of the
time, when a band gets signed to a major label with the bid
ding wars and everything, the band has to work at it. Every
band I know that's ever done that, it hasn't been like the
Charlie Brown comic strip where he catches a fly ball and
some talent scout says, "Sign that kid up!" It's more like
Charlie Brown hires a lawyer to shop his stuff around and
tries to generate interest with a publicity package. Things
rarely work other than like that, I mean, there are exceptions
when someone stumbles upon a genuine pop culture phe
nomenon on their own, but usually pop culture phenomena
are meticulously created. So I suppose if we had ever decid
ed that that's what we wanted do, not that I'm opposed to it
on principle or anything, we could have mounted that sort of
a campaign. But I've seen it destroy creative careers, and
bands who try for the make-me-a-rock-star package find
that it almost never works out. The three years you spend
trying to get your deal, you could've made three albums. So
even if I can only spend $100 on it, I'm just going to keep
making records.
I: Beyond local recognition and MTV airplay, have you
enjoyed the level of success you've attained?
Dr. F: I've been able to take this further than I could have
ever imagined. I mean, I quit my day job five years ago. I've
been making a living from The Mr. T Experience for five
years, and that's amazing. I've been doing this work that has
a certain amount of integrity and is generally respected, and
I would not want to trade places with someone who has a lot
of money and is embarrassed about what he's doing. I feel
that I'm doing exactly the right thing with my songs and with
my career; that in itself is a kind of success.
