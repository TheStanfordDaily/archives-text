And you too! Sun Jam is an outdoor music
festival of campus bands. Apparently the
idea for this event came up at Battle of the
Bands this past winter. Junior Wendy
Marinaccio, drummer of too Much neon and
co-coordinator of the festival, explained "We
wanted to have an event where all the bands
could play and sit in with each other, where
we could celebrate music without a compe
tition added to it" Bands scheduled to
appear are: Good Pilgrim, School of Ruckus,
too Much neon and Ware Wendell and his
Hep Blues Quartet The Sun Jam will take
place this Sunday at the Florence Moore
field between Florence Moore and Xanadu,
from noon until 6 p.m. It's free and open to
everyone.
