## 'MUMMY': RESURRECTION Jolly good times in Egypt 
### 
nee in a while, I indulge myself and enjoy
f//J a movie that is simply entertaining and
utterly devoid of cinematic substance.
Previous films falling into this category were
"ID4" and "Armageddon." Stephen Sommer's
"The Mummy" reminds me why summer popcorn
movies work: they are the ultimate form of spe
cial-effects-ridden escapism from the doldrums of
life. 1 couldn't help but admire the good guys and
detest the bad ones, and that is why this picture
can function as a whole.

The opening sequence is sensa
tional moviemaking, an overblown
interpretation of past historical
events. Watching Egyptians daring
to defy the Pharaoh's wishes and
becoming mummified is a grue
some, yet fitting, way to begin "The
Mummy." We watch Imhotep

Osiris, smear the writing on the arm of the
Pharaoh's wife, and we know what's in store tor
him. We also sense that Imhotep will be back,
angrier than ever, later on.
Fast forward three millennia. Brendan Fraser,
goofy and ail-American as usual, plays a French
Foreign Legionnaire fighting in the midst of
Imhotep's burial site. Fraser, as Rick O'Connell,
has his chance at scoring in a movie of blockbuster
proportions. And he does, for the most part.
His newfound love interest, the hapless and
relentless librarian Evelyn (Rachel Weisz, "Chain
Reaction"), saves him from vicious Egyptian
enslavers who were prepared to hang him. Evelyn's
wiry brother, Jonathan (John Hannah, "Four
Weddings and a Funeral"), had been given a

strange artifact containing a map to Imhotep's
tomb by Rick.
So, the three merrily ride off on their camels
deep into the Saharan desert. Of course, there are
signs warning our prospective heroes NOT to
enter the area surrounding Imhotep's tomb. There
are the mysterious magi who have been guarding
the tomb for 3,000 years. There are bizarre
whirling sandstorms and gusts of wind making all
the diggers (more than the original three by this
point) worry and hypothesize. But the fortune
hunters are undeterred and eventually

unleash the most destructive force
known to mankind, namely Mr.
Imhotep.
You ask what their motives are? Well,
Evelyn is seeking ancient texts to com
plement the library she works in. As an
archaeologist, Jonathan is curious. The

O'Connor, dreams of gold trinkets.
Director-writer Stephen Sommers ("Deep
Rising") has made "The Mammy" with the same
absurdist action / horror hybrid with relatively
unknown actors. The protagonists seem to glow a
golden yellow, while the opposing forces are all
mean-looking and pasty-white. It's probably a
good thing that Fraser, along with the other actors,
wisely understands the underlying ridiculousness
of the premise — and the movie in general. "The
Mummy" ain't perfect, but who even cares when
you've got stunning visual effects and evocative
cinematography to admire?
