# STEALING BEAUTY!
## Nothing to find in 'Lost & Found' 
### 
you would think that a movie by the asshole we all love to hate, David
00/7 Spade, would be hilarious. His other movies, "Tommy Boy" and "Black
Sheep," as well as his lengthy stint on "Saturday Night Live" had me in
stitches. I love his cocky, witty brand of comedy. It is so hilarious because he
looks like a little mouse! The "Buh-bye" sketch from Saturday Night Live still has

me craciung up.
So you can see why I looked forward to spending 100 minutes of

my weekend with Spade. The previews for the movie seemed
all right. Spade plays an everyday guy who is trying to win

the affections of his beautiful new French neighbor. But
since he's only 5 feet tall and weighs a buck-o-five, she
won't give him the time of day. It's the classic root-for-

the-underdog-to-get-the-girl flick.
OK, I thought, I can deal with that. But this time.it
just wasn't right. The way Spade's character plans to win
her over is by stealing her dog. Wait a minute, did I
catch that right? Stealing her dog? Who thought of that?
1 have one word for the writer of the screenplay: rewrite.

Couldn't he have done something else? Like cooking her
dinner and making her sick with his food, or injuring her
in a game of flag football, so that he could nurse her
back to health?

Hey, I'm no comedian — but stealing her dog?

I Come on! Anyway, the weak plot isn t what WoU | < j in pegards to ...?

killed the movie for me. The little twerp wasn't funny! I
couldn't believe it. The entire audience did not laugh
once. As I said before, the plot was juvenile. All of Spade's
jokes seemed forced and out of place. The only time a
laugh was actually heard in the audience (and trust me,
it wasn't me) was when Spade's character does a little

But here is the real kicker: the producers, banking
on the success of Spade's partnership with the
physical comedy of Chris Farley, cast a Farley
i wannabe to support most of Spades' horrible

one liners. It was blasphemous! Don't disre

I His character was not even essential to the
plot. They just threw him in for the fun of it.
He could hardly act and just walked around
being fat and sloppy for most of the movie.

1 am a bit upset with Spade for allowing the

powers that be get away with that. But I guess it
wasn't too bad, I got to see Maria Gibbs (The
Jeffersons) help beat Spade in strip poker... .
