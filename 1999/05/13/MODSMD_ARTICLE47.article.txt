## SEXX FOOD A 						lesson in obsession 
### Roxy Sass 
/T) ✓ ou can te 'l a psycho by his or her
handwriting — at least you could in
this case. Erin had found a card and a
bouquet of flowers under her wiper outside the
gym she frequents, and the slant of the letters
screamed insanity. The words themselves
proved even worse. "Dear ma'am," it started.
"You are in good health, I hope. 1 watghed you
in aerobics class but didn't want to interrupt.
My name is Allen, jyfy occupation? Telecom
technician. 1 see you are pretty well kept and
will introduce myself if given a chancy. I hope
you're interested.HHere's my pa&cr number." An
obsession had surfaced- | 4 PS. t
Even though Erin is an exceptional girl, It is
hard to guess why that man, or any person for
that matter, becomes obsessive. Maybe obses
sives lack the social prowess required for nor- :
mal interaction. Maybe they are masochists
who like to tautft themselves*with fantasies of
unattainable people or/naybe they're just weir
does. Who knows whatt number of modern
maladies have overcome them? Whatever the
reason, obsessions seem,to be a popular hobby
lately. ' >
With all this obsessing going on, how do you
know if you're a part $ the movement yourself?
Most telling is your behavior around the person
you like. Obsessive people are like sentient blobs *>
of modeling clay that try to carve their greasy,
gray selves into the shapes they think their
objects will find most appetizing. Your target
likes martinis? You tc*S out your hinder and
stockpile Vermouth, He or she power wafks 10
miles weekly? Suddenly you're an Olympian,
your -of smoke# be damned.
Everything ypur object says is an opportunity to
show how similar you are, and every silence
leaves you stressed that something went wrong.
Then when your object isn't around, you
baby-sit the phone like it's your firstborn child-

Cosmopolitan starts seeming genuinely rele-*
vant. At this point, to Stop and ask
yourself what you're really attracted to.
Two types of obsessions exist The kind we
generally talk about is what well call "lap-dog *
obsession." Ih this case, you feel you have found
The One Person that cpuld ever possibly make ,
you happy, and you've decided that if the qnly
way to be around this paragon is to nip at his or
her heels like a prepubescent sharpay, then so be
it. You slink around meekly and start barking
defensively when atiy of your friends suggests
you deserve better. (Note: American Heritage
defines "lap dog" as one that is eager to do
anther's bidding, especially so as to maintain a
position of privilege or favor. And you thought
Miss Sass just made this stuff up?) **
Curing "lap-dog obsession" is easy but
unpleasant. The only way for you to regain con
trol is to break off contact with that person
completely. You will then cry, tell people you're
dying of consumption and develop a nasty
habit of racing to the phone 26 times daily to
call up your love object. But put that receiver
back down. In a number of weeks, you'll realize
how much of your life you wasted mooning

over that unworthy clod and will have found
several much better ways to destroy yourself.
The other kind of obsession we'll call "hit
and-run obsession." Here, you're not overtaken
by desire for one single person but a series of
them. You think you've found The One, like a
lap dog, but when he or she doesn't measure up
you instantly transfer your affections to the next
One. In fact, you become decidedly uneasy
when you dori't have a beau or belle to put on a
pedestal. 4 *

girl down from there. ItisiiFt helpful to either

to : : be, labejkdidol rather than peer. "Hit and
runners* need to understand that anything in
gxcess turns repulsive, including your opinion
of someone. * *
Hold on, you say. I may be obsessive but I'm
having a perfectly fine time, so why should I
change? Wheji you're obsessing, you're setting
yourself up for defeat. If the guy or girl falls for
your little mirror / magpie roytine, he or she
has proven themselves an irretrievable
: Narcissist, But most Ot the time, you'll just keep
obsessing arid they'll keep rejecting until you're
a little, watered-dowp -puddle of your former
self.
However, if you're bent on obsessing, here's
some advice gleaned from a boy who is a fre
quent target tor obsessives. Any gesture you
make toward the boy or girl should be about
them rather than you. So, instead of writing a
, five-pa£e treatise on how deserving of their love
you are (Miss Sass has seen tbis happen), send
them chocolate and flowers. If you deckle to go
behind thvnr back to find out exactly what kind
of ilowers they want, or other info, be super
Stealthy while you're doing It, and don't tell the
person you did. They'll forever be irritated,
wondering who you asked,and what. And avoid
anything that can be interpreted as creepy. The
text printed on Erin's card unwisely read
"Someone is thinking of you, and that someone
is me." Oh dear.
Speaking of Erin, Miss Sass will share what
happened. After finding the card, she went back
Into the gym and asked if any members
i>. matched die signature. None did. It was not
until weeks later, 3* she Walked from the park
ing lot to the gym door, thafa man confronted
her by the door and asked if she remembered
receiving flow#rs. Ever the level-headed girl,
Erin told the man that talking to a person
directly was a preferable gesture to leaving an
anonymous note. When he then asked for her
name, she left and has had a guard meet her at
the door each time since 1 .
