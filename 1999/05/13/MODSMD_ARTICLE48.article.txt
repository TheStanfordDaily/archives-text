Tucked away just off busy University Avenue, St.
Michael's Alley, or "St. Elmo's Fire" as we like to call it,
offers a dining experience worth taking time to enjoy.
Its ever-changing interior and delicious California
nouveau cuisine offers customers a break from their
tedious and unfulfilling daily lives. This small restau
rant does not fill space with glamorous decorations or
attempt to transport the customer to an exotic destina
tion. Rather, it reminds the diner of a time in his or her
own life when things were more simple.
In the style of a French bistro, St. Michael's Alley,
with its plain white tablecloths and classic wooden bar,
exudes class. The restaurant's square shape provides a
homey feel; from any table you can see every other per
son yet still feel uninhibited. Keeping real to its roots as
an art restaurant, "St. Michael's" has frequently chang
ing paintings on its walls.
While there is a wide variety of food on the menu,
Chef Anderson prepares each meat and pasta dish in
only one fashion. Main dishes range from lamb chops
and steak to more delicate dishes like Chilean sea bass
and lobster ravioli. If some of these dishes sound
appealing, we recommend that you go soon because
while the restaurant's classic-dishes remain, certain
items change on a seasonal basis.
For his appetizer, David craved his culture's tradi
tional breakfast of lox and cream cheese. He also
enjoyed a smoked salmon and cream fraiche on corn
meal pancakes. The sweetness of the pancake com
bined with the salt and tanginess of its toppings got
David's meal off to a great start. Adrien, on the other
hand, went with an old, familiar dish, the leek and
onion tart. The combination of leek and onion with
the pastry tart rivaled David's dish. Both of these appe
tizers are not to be missed.
While Adrien has dined here a few times, the friend
ly waitress was able to convince him to stray from his
usual dishes and try one of the new additions to the
spring menu: spring risotto. The chef's use of mixed
vegetables, most notably carrots and asparagus, gave a
new twist to an old dish. David chose to get into the
spirit of Cinco de Mayo by having the swordfish taco
special. The soft blue shell tortillas and mango salsa
were fresh enough to overcome the oddity of eating
chopped fish with one's hands. The addition of the side
portion of black beans was equally delicious.
The overall dinning experience was relaxing and
delicious. While we were not able to eat with the "Brat
Pack," we still enjoyed our meal at St. Michael's Alley.
