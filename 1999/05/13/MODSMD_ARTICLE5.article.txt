The new online marketplace. Vivas
mart. is the brainchild of two Stan
lord students and offers whatever the
student heart desires by allowing
buyers to compare the used prices
with those available from online
merchants.
Thai Fran, a senior in computer
science, and Ama A wallah, a doctor
al student in Electrical Engineering,
started Vivasmart two or three
weeks ago.
The two friends founded Books
mart last year, a site which automati
cally compares the prices of text
books at the Stanford Bookstore
against major online bookstores such
as Amazon.com or Barnes and
Noble.
Vivasmart stands under the same
motto as Booksmart.
"We want to help the students
save money in any way we can." said
I ran and Awallah in their mission
statesment.

'We want to be the
students' advocates, not
the merchant's.'
â€” Thai Tran, Vivasmart co-founder

"We want to be the students'
adovates. not the merchant's."
Awallah added.
Vivasmart is free. "We are not
making any money off it." Tran said.
Allawah added, "We just want to
provide a good service. We are not
worrying about the financing."
I ran and Awallah devote exten
sive amounts of their free time to Vi
vasmart. Tran. who is only taking one
class this quarter,said "it is a full time
job."
Both are thinking to continue
professionally in the field.
The friends started the site at
Stanford, because they thought the
campus lacked a "central market
place," Awallah said. "The process
of selling and buying [at Stanford] is
fragmented."
