The new online marketplace. Vivas
mart. is the brainchild of two Stan
lord students and offers whatever the
student heart desires by allowing
buyers to compare the used prices
with those available from online
merchants.
Thai Fran, a senior in computer
science, and Ama A wallah, a doctor
al student in Electrical Engineering,
started Vivasmart two or three
weeks ago.
The two friends founded Books
mart last year, a site which automati
cally compares the prices of text
books at the Stanford Bookstore
against major online bookstores such
as Amazon.com or Barnes and
Noble.
Vivasmart stands under the same
motto as Booksmart.
"We want to help the students
save money in any way we can." said
I ran and Awallah in their mission
statesment.

'We want to be the
students' advocates, not
the merchant's.'
— Thai Tran, Vivasmart co-founder

"We want to be the students'
adovates. not the merchant's."
Awallah added.
Vivasmart is free. "We are not
making any money off it." Tran said.
Allawah added, "We just want to
provide a good service. We are not
worrying about the financing."
I ran and Awallah devote exten
sive amounts of their free time to Vi
vasmart. Tran. who is only taking one
class this quarter,said "it is a full time
job."
Both are thinking to continue
professionally in the field.
The friends started the site at
Stanford, because they thought the
campus lacked a "central market
place," Awallah said. "The process
of selling and buying [at Stanford] is
fragmented."
He explained that so far, only the
newsgroup su.market or the Tresid
der Bulletin board could help stu
dents on their hunt for the essentials
of life. But, according to Tran, not
many students know of su.market
and not all students can make it to
Tresidder, especially while finishing
finals overseas.
In cooperation with su.market,
Tran and Awallah now established a
site that incorporates the news
group's offers and bids, but is more
easily accessible. Especially for those
who return to campus or who ap
proach it for the first time, this is a
great advantage.
Vivasmart also lists prices and ser
vices in a categorical and hierarchical
way. This means, according to Awal
lah, that "you do not need to look at
everything." In other words, purchas
ing a basketball ticket does not in
volve a struggle through endless ads

about toasters anymore.
Tran and A wallah wanted not
only to simplify selling and buying in
the Stanford community but to en
able students to make more informed
buying decisions. Vivasmart contains
a function that allows buyers to com
pare the used prices to commercial
ones.
"I think this function is our real
value added," said Tran. "We are try
ing to give the most selection to stu
dents ... and enable them to get more
for their money."
Vivasmart was originally designed
for Stanford, but a large number of
other universities already asked for
participation in the site.
"Many students from other cam
puses e-mailed us. They also wanted
to be on our site," Tran said.
While these users cannot access
the Stanford market, which is restrict
ed by University regulation, Stanford
users can do their shopping at Prince
ton or Penn State.
Vivasmart can be reached at the
address www.vivasmart.com.
