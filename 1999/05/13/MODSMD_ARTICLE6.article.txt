## New legislation strips federal financial aid from drug offenders 
### Keith Proctor 
A new federal law that would strip financial aid
from students convicted of drug-related offenses
will most likely have minimal effects on student fi
nancial aid awards at Stanford.
According to the Financial Aid Office's Cyn
thia I lartley, director of student awards. Stanford
is insulated from the effects of this law because
federal money accounts for only about a quarter of
student nc d-based aid.
Assuming that a relatively small number of stu

held accountable for investing it wisely. Don't use
or sell drugs, and you have nothing to worry
about."
Stanford ("hief of Police Marvin Herrington ac

"Who's going to investigate all these cases?"
Herrington said.
I lerrington also said the law would strike those
who are caught with drugs and cannot afford to go
to college, rather than those offenders wealthy
enough to attend school without aid.
"People who have to work in order to get
through school face enough problems, and this
