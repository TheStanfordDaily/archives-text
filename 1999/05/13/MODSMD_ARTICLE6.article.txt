## New legislation strips federal financial aid from drug offenders 
### Keith Proctor 
A new federal law that would strip financial aid
from students convicted of drug-related offenses
will most likely have minimal effects on student fi
nancial aid awards at Stanford.
According to the Financial Aid Office's Cyn
thia I lartley, director of student awards. Stanford
is insulated from the effects of this law because
federal money accounts for only about a quarter of
student nc d-based aid.
Assuming that a relatively small number of stu
dents are rendered ineligible for federal aid due to
drim-rclated offenses. Stanford will still be able to

meet student financial needs.
"[The federal law) would certainly affect a
school more substantially where the students rely
almost totally on federal aid," Hartley said.
I lie aid restriction is part of the Higher Educa
tion Act. signed by President Clinton in October
that will take effect on July I.2(KK).
I Jnder the federal law. if a student who receives
federal financial aid is convicted of drug posses
sion. his or her aid eligibility is suspended for one
year for the first offense, two years for the second
offense and indefinitely for the third offense.
I or drug sale convictions, financial aid is sus
pended for two years for the first offense and in
definitely for the second offense. Students may re
gain their eligibility before the suspension period
expires il they successfully complete a rehabilita
tion program and test negative for drug use twice
without prior notice.
The law was championed by Indiana's Rep.
Mark Souder. who wrote in a commentary in the

I Jniversity of Virginia's Cavalier Daily, "Actions
have consequences. II you receive taxpayer assis
tance to pursue your college education, you will be
held accountable for investing it wisely. Don't use
or sell drugs, and you have nothing to worry
about."
Stanford ("hief of Police Marvin Herrington ac
cedes that the law sounds difficult to enforce.
"Who's going to investigate all these cases?"
Herrington said.
I lerrington also said the law would strike those
who are caught with drugs and cannot afford to go
to college, rather than those offenders wealthy
enough to attend school without aid.
"People who have to work in order to get
through school face enough problems, and this
would just stop them from going to school. It
doesn't seem productive." he said.
Skeptical of the law, Herrington believes the

matter might he better left in the
hands of the schools.
"We should focus on serious of
fenses and then let the sehools take
action by themselves," Herrington
said. '"A lot of these legislators think
that the answer to every problem is
to make a law. I don't think that's the
case."
The U.S. Department of Educa
tion is attempting to work with col
leges to determine how best to carry
out the new regulation before its im
plementation next year.
" This process allows all sides to
make good assessments of the law
before it is set in stone," 1 lartley said.
Meanwhile, opponents of the
new law are organizing a campaign
to rouse college students against
the measure. The Drug Reform
Coordination Network, a nonprof
it group in Washington, D.C., is
lobbying students to endorse a bill

introduced by Rep. Barney Frank
(D-Mass.) that would repeal the
provision. The group has set up a
Web site — www.u-net.org —
through which students can lobby
lawmakers in support of Frank's
bill.
Souder said that special interest
groups like DRCN "are hard
pressed to explain why taxpayers
should subsidize the costs of a col
lege education for students who vio
late the law and impede their own
academic success by using and / or
selling drugs."
The federal law is still a work in
progress as the Department of Edu
cation attempts to work out imple
mentation procedures for the new
ban.
"We left [the law's guidelines]
flexible so that the Education De
partment can implement it as easily
as possible," wrote a Souder spokes
woman on Souder's Web site. She
added that if difficulties concerning
the law arise, "we can always revisit
the issue."
