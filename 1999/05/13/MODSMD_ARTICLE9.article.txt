# Cardinal abroad a key to Stanford's fund-raising stategy
## Focusing on overseas alumni 
### Jed Rose Contributing writer 
In the past few years, Stanford
has gone along with universities
everywhere in discovering a new
source of fundraising â€” soliciting in
ternational alumni.
Foreign alumni have taken on a
larger role in Stanford's donations,
and the University has worked hard
to maintain a working relationship
with them.
Stanford has about K percent of
its alumni living outside of the Unit
ed States, and they receive the same
services as domestic alumni. They
are kept abreast of all alumni pro
grams and are encouraged to join
their local Stanford clubs and to take
advantage of the new Stanford Ca
reer Network.
"Currently, there are Stanford
alumni clubs in 33 countries around
the world, run by alumni volun
teers," said Cindy Pearson, program
director at the Stanford Alumni As

sociation. "We also alert our volun
teers when we are aware that faeulty
will be traveling to their countries
and encouraging them to invite the
faculty to speak to club members
during their visit."
According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, foreign student
enrollment in U.S. colleges has near
ly doubled in the last 20 years, mean
ing that a greater percentage of
alumni who can contribute can now
be found abroad.
"The realization is there that it's
an incredible resource, and it hasn't
been tapped," Isabel Sharp, coordi
nator of the University of Utah's In
ternational Resource Network, told
the Chronicle. "It has finally dawned
on an increasing number of U.S. in
stitutions."
Sharp's company is an Internet
based system that helps the universi
ty track its foreign alumni.
In Stanford's case, the Internet
has definitely played a huge part in
facilitating international alumni

communication with the University.
International alumni can now
subscribe to a monthly e
mail newsletter. Specialized versions
of the newsletter are given to alumni
in Europe and Asia and contain im
portant information for alumni in
those regions.
In 1997 Stanford jointly spon
sored a conference in London for
alumni living nearby. The Graduate
School of Business hosted another
conference in Paris where all Stan
ford alumni were welcome.
"The day before the conference
we met with presidents from all the
European clubs for a training work
shop," Pearson added.
Over the next three years, a series
of alumni events for Asia is planned
in conjunction with the Business
School.
Sieve Suda of Stanford's Office
of Development was quick to point
out that Stanford has remained fair
ly consistent with foreign student en
rollment at the undergraduate level

in the past 20 years. He said Stan
ford's graduate programs have seen
the largest increases in the numbers
of international students.
His office is confident in its abili
ty to attract gifts from international
alumni.
"Last year the University raised a
total of $319 million in gift funds,
[which] came from a record 59,(XX)-
plus donors," Suda said. "Of the
5319 million, just under $12.9 million
is from international alumni."
This overall figun. is up from rais
ing $250 million three years ago and
the current amount puts Stanford
among the top two schools in the na
tion for annual gift figures, the other
being Harvard University.
And it looks like Stanford alumni
are showing no sign of slowing down
the recent trend of giving more.
"I don't know where we'll come
out at the end of this year. But to
date, we are about $15 million ahead
from where we were last year," Suda
said.
