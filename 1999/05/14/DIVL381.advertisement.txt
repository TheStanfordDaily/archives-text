I used to be an average
Stanford graduate student...
But then I became
a Freshman Mentor
We're Looking For A Few Good Mentors.
If you look back and remember how you
made it through your 112 reshman year, you'll
likely remember that you received a lot of
help from others (mentors, advisors,...).
Now is your chance to keep that experience
alive by becoming a mentor yourself.
As a mentor you will have the chance to get
out of your department and connect with
graduate students from across the campus.
On the way, you'll develop your group
facilitation skills, serve and connect with
the undergraduate community, and most
importantly, help incoming freshmen
discover academic resources and disciplines
while exploring these same opportunities
yourself.
AND, by giving students a boost on their
road to academic achievement, you will earn
a hrtie spending money while making a
BIG difference!
