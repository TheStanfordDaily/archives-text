# Unionization builds barriers
## Contract talks driving wedge between Dining Service 'family' 
### Erica Piatt Contributing writer 
and a union supporter, recalls the negotiations that
took place two years ago when a contract was first
worked out between the union and Bon Appetit man
agement.
"The first contract was very hard and took about 11
months to work out," Torres said. "But there are still
important problems that we hope will be worked out
soon, especially [health] insurance issues." He stressed
that workers were paying too much for insurance bene
fits while being paid very little.
"I don't expect much to happen with the new con
tract. We just have to wait and see how the managers re
spond to the union proposal."
According to senior Lindsay Imai of the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition. "Bon Appetit management
have intimidated workers and even fired workers who
have attempted to unionize."
Student groups have organized in support of the

workers' union. Last Wednesday. MEChA and SLAC
held a joint Cinco de Mayo celebration and rally to
voice student concern and generate labor awareness on
campus. The head of the Local 715 and three workers
spoke along with author and activist Betita Martinez.
"We wanted to inform students about the kinds of
labor practices that Stanford employs," Imai said.
"Stanford," Imai alleged, "whose motto translates
into 'let the winds of freedom blow,' underpays its
workers and intimidates and fires workers who attempt
to unionize."
"Our main concern is that Bon Appetit conduct ne
gotiations in good faith," said junior Genevieve Aguilar
of MEChA.
Although they are grateful for student support,
other workers believe that the union is the major prob-

Union representatives for Bon Appetit food service
workers in Tresidder Union and the company's man
agement began contract negotiations this week. Yet
many workers are not optimistic about what the new
contract might bring and remain divided on the issue of
union representation.
Union members and Bon Appetit management had
agreed to guaranteed annual wage increases, seniority
rules and fair grievance procedures in the contract ne
gotiated in 1997. which has now expired.

lem, claiming that it has caused divi
sion among pro-union workers and
anti-union workers at Bon Appetit.
Some claim that students need to
take a closer look at the situation
and question the union representa
tives along with the managers.
"Every company has its prob
lems," cook Aaron Fort said. "But
since the union has come in and
used its pressure tactics to get peo
ple to join, people's attitudes have
changed."
According to Fort, the workers
should not have moved straight to
the union with their demands two
years ago but instead need to talk
with Bon Appetit managers direct
ly-
"This company has gone out of
its way to help employees in the
past," Fort said. " The owners here

really treat this place as a family
owned business and work to get
things done."
Fort noted that managers had
helped workers and their families
in the past but complained that the
union has done very little but cause
conflict between the workers.
Leroy Fish agreed that the
union has dramatically altered em
ployee relations compared to when
he started work seven years ago.
"The union doesn't work for this
family-style food service place. We
used to be like a little family, and
now with all the union talk, every
one is fighting," Fish said.
Fish and Fort both expect little
change in the wake of the contract
negotiations. As Fort said. "I don't
see anything changing. People used
to do more, learn English or go for
chef training, by talking to the man
agers themselves. By bringing the
union in, we've gotten ourselves
into a conflict that's gone too far."
