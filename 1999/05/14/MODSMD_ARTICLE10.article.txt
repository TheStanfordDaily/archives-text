Assembly passes drug needle exchange bill
SAC RAMENTO (AF) — Drug users could receive cl can hypo
dermic needles from state-approved programs under a controversial
bill backed yesterday by the Assembly.
The measure is intended to reduce the sharing of contaminated
needles, one way that the AIDS virus, hepatitis and other infectious
diseases are transmitted. Critics say such programs don't work and
give the impression that the government approves of drug use.
"This bill is not about promoting drug use. this bill is about public
health," said Assemblywoman Kerry Mazzoni, D-San Rafael, the
measure's sponsor. "Drug addiction is a disease and the people who
are addicted will do anything to get what they need and jeopardize
people's health to do it."
Under California law. it is illegal to distribute or have hypodermic
needles or syringes without a doctor's prescription. Mazzoni's bill,
approved 43-29, would allow local governments to establish programs
that distribute the supplies without such permission.
Nationally, injection drug users are the second largest group at risk
of becoming infected with HIV and developing AIDS.
In California, nearly one-third of new AIDS cases reported last
year were associated with injection drug use, according to the San
Francisco AIDS Foundation.
Mazzoni told reporters that Gov. Gray Davis has given her indica
tions that he may support her bill.
If approved, the bill would allow drug users to pick up hypodermic
needles or trade used supplies for clean ones. The cost of operating a
local safe-needle program would be about $ 1 (SO.(KX) a year. Mazzoni
said.
Man arrested for anti-Islam threats
AURORA. Colo. (AF) — A man with an array of weapons and
bomb materials in his car has been arrested for allegedly planning to
torch the Islamic Center and "kill Iraqis," authorities said.
Jack Modig. 39, was arrested early Wednesday following a car
chase and a fight with police officers in his apartment. In his car,
authorities said, were 30 gallons of gasoline and other bomb compo
nents, as well as four guns, two 22-inch machetes and 850 rounds of
ammunition.
Modig said he was "an enemy against the Islamic Nation, and I was
going to take care of business," Sgt. Terry Reibling said.
"He was there to torch it (the center)... and to kill Iraqis," added
Arapahoe County Sheriff Fat Sullivan.
Modig was being held for investigation of possession of explosive
devices, three counts of attempted vehicular assault, eluding, carrying
concealed weapons and ethnic intimidation.
Modig claimed some connection with the anti-government Com
mon Law Court and a militia, but investigators said they do not
believe anyone else was involved.
Reibling said he spotted Modig's car in front of the mosque, but the
driver fled as he approaehed. Police said Modig tried to ram police
cars during the chase.
"This kind of behavior is alarming and intolerable," said the Rev.
Lucia Guzman, director of the Colorado Council of Churches. "There
seem to be more and more of these incidents that portray hate and
divisiveness. They are a sign that the various religious communities
need to do more to combat hate."
State court upholds homeless rights
SANTA ANA (AF) — The homeless have a right to use necessity
as a defense against charges of sleeping in public, the California
Supreme Court said.
Orange County Deputy District Attorney Scott G. Scoville had
asked the court to decertify a 4th District Court of Appeal decision
issued Dec. 30 to set aside the conviction of a Vietnam veteran
charged with sleeping in the Santa Ana Civic Center.
Scoville said yesterday he wasn't aware of the high court's decision
and wasn't prepared to comment.
James Eichorn. 49. was cited in January 1993 and faced six months
in jail under the city's hard-line approach to move the homeless out of
public places. The Marine Corps vet said he was sleeping in public
because all the homeless shelters were full.
Before trial. Municipal Judge James M. Brooks ruled Eichorn
couldn't present evidence to jurors that every shelter was full and that
he had done everything to alleviate his condition.
Scoville contended the Eichorn case didn't justify a necessity
defense because he didn't suffer any physical or mental problems and
there was no evidence he tried to call his parents for help.
The attorney for Eichorn, who was convicted and sentenced to 40
hours community service, scoffed at the prosecutor's notion.
"The people have concluded by their words and deeds that none of
the K).(KK) homeless residents of Orange County are 'truly homeless'
because each one could have more actively sought family assistance,
employment and / or welfare." attorney Robert G. Loewy said.
