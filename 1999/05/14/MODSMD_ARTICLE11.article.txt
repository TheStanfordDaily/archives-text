# Russian parliament's lower house opens hearings for troubled president
## Boris Yeltsin facing impeachment 
### 
MOSCOW (AF) — Lawmakers
accused President Boris Yeltsin of
carrying out economic and social
policies that have claimed the lives
of millions of Russians, as impeach
ment hearings opened yesterday
that could test the strength of Rus
sia's fragile democracy.
In an atmosphere of anger and
foreboding, the lower house of par
liament, the State Duma, accused
Yeltsin of destroying the Soviet
Union, selling out Russia to the
West, starting war in the breakaway
province of Chechnya, illegally dis
solving parliament in 1993 and wag
ing genocide against the Russian
nation with policies that wrecked
the economy.
Yeltsin himself "didn't kill any
body, of course." said Vadim Fil
imonov, the Communist head of the
impeachment commission. "But he
gave orders to kill people."
The hearings began one day
after Yeltsin propelled the country
into political turmoil by firing popu
lar Prime Minister Yevgeny Pri
makov and his Cabinet. The shake
up. the third in little more than a
year, gave added impetus to the
hearings.
However, it seems less likely that
the upper house of parliament
would vote to remove Yeltsin from
office. Yeltsin's ouster would also
require two-thirds majorities of the
supreme and constitutional courts
— which is considered unlikely.
With 443 deputies in the Com
munist-dominated Duma, it will
require 300 to impeach Yeltsin. So
far. at least 125 have indicated that
they oppose impeachment, suggest
ing the vote could be close.
Yeltsin was accused of destroy

ing the Soviet Union to enable
NATO to dominate the world. "It
was exactly because of the collapse
of the USSR that NATO was able
to advance to our borders and
bomb Iraq and Yugoslavia." Fil
imonov said.
Yeltsin was also accused of ruin
ing the military and causing the
deaths of millions by destroying the
country's economy, ruining the

health system and lowering life
expectancy.
Yeltsin's Duma envoy, Alexan
der Kotenkov, responded for the
president, saying the impeachment
charges were groundless. He gave a
long, often emotional rebuttal of
each of the five charges.
"We have a choice: either fight
for power or hold the next election
as scheduled and legally carry out

the transfer of power in our state.
The choice is yours, esteemed
deputies." Kotenkov said.
Deputies across the spectrum
said they did not expect the Duma
to approve Yeltsin's choice of for
mer Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin to replace Primakov.
Stepashin was named acting prime
minister while the Duma considers
his confirmation.
