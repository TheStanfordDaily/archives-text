# Republicans retreat on gun control

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Senate Republi
cans retreated under pressure yesterday on the
politically volatile issue of gun control, calling for
fresh restrictions on sales at gun shows less than
24 hours after rejecting them.
Democrats swiftly denounced the offer, saying
it contained numerous loopholes that would leave
guns too readily accessible to criminals and others
who shouldn't possess them. "It's the most Swiss
cheesy bill I've ever seen," said Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
Still, the development underscored the change
in the gun control debate in the wake of last
month's shootings at a Colorado high school.
And gun control advocates claimed one long
sought victory during the day, when the Senate
agreed to prohibit the importation of high-capac
ity ammunition clips that were omitted from a
1994 assault weapons ban. An effort to kill the
measure was rejected. 59-39, with almost all votes
in opposition cast by Republicans. "The NRA
said no and it passed anyway." said Sen. Dianne
Feinstein. D-Calif.
The Senate also agreed to a proposal by Sen.
John Ashcroft. R-Mo., to ban juvenile possession
of semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity
ammunition clips. That vote was 96-2.
The maneuvering came as some Republicans
expressed concern about the outcome of a series
of votes Wednesday relating to so-called private
sales at gun shows. " There was a realization that

there was a loophole that had to be closed." said
Sen. John McCain. R-Ariz.
For his part. President Clinton charged that "a
narrow majority of the Senate (had) voted to pre
serve the dangerous gun show loophole" less than
a month after the shooting spree at the
Columbine High School.
Those votes established a voluntary system of
background checks for so-called private sales at
gun shows, rather than the mandatory checks
required of licensed dealers.
Under the revised GOP proposal. Sen. Larry
Craig. R-Idaho, said all sales at gun shows would
be subjected to the instant background checks.
Craig, a member of the National Rifle Associ
ation board of directors, said the organization had
"grudgingly" agreed to the changes.
"He got caught weakening the gun laws. A lot
of people here got sucked in and got upset," said
Sen. Barbara Boxer. D-Calif., referring to Repub
lican senators.
McCain, a contender for the 2(KK) GOP presi
dential nomination, underscored the shifting
political dynamic on gun control following last
month's fatal shootings at Columbine High
School in Colorado.
Several GOP sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said private polling in recent weeks
has shown very strong support for gun control,
even among potential voters in Republican presi
dential primaries. That is a marked shift from the
past, in which base Republican voters were less

supportive of gun control than the nation as a
whole.
Clinton and other Democrats made it clear
they intend to use the issue in the elections in
2000.
Republicans countered that gun control policy
had hurt Democrats in IW4, when it last was a
key issue. But at the same time, GOP lawmakers
worked to revise their position.
The developments came as the Senate contin
ued deliberations on legislation to stiffen prose
cution of juvenile offenders. Provisions of the
measure would provide additional funding for
prosecutors, make it easier to try suspects as
young as 14 as adults and impose tougher penal
ties on those convicted.
But the Colorado shootings made the legisla
tion a focus for debate over gun control and
efforts to address violence in modern-day culture.
Gun control advocates believed the Colorado
shootings would give fresh momentum for the
long campaign to restrict the possession of
weapons.
But the NRA, known for its lobbying prowess,
dug in its heels, and appeared to have prevailed.
By yesterday morning. Democrats said they
had a political issue, even if they had lost on the
Senate floor.
"The defeat of background checks at the 4.(XM)
gun shows will become a central issue in the 2(XM)
elections," said Sen. Bob Torricelli. D-N.J.. chair
man of the party's Senate campaign committee.
