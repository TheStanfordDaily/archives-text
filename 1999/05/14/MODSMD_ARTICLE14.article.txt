New drug law affecting
financial aid applies
unevenly to students

DON'T DO DRUGS. But it
you do, at least don't get
caught, because* a new federal
law set to take elTeet in July 2000, will
put a squeeze on your federal financial
aid.
But, if you're not on any govern
ment-sponsored aid programs, don't
worry. II you get caught, nothing's
going to happen to you, or at least
vom financial aid package.
Hie aforementioned restriction,
signed by President Clinton in Octo
ber. is part of the Higher Education
Aet. Under the law. if a student who
receives federal financial aid is con
victed of a drug possession, his or her
aid eligibility is placed in jeopardy and
suspended for a year. On the third
offense, all aid is suspended.
For drug sale convictions, two
offenses cancel aid indefinctely.
It is a poor attempt at public policy
making to legislate that those who are
less soeioeeonomically advantaged
than others should pay a steeper price
for drug transgressions. I his law could
place the college educations of stu
dents on financial aid in serious peril.
Those students not on federal aid who
are convicted of these crimes will not
have to pay nearly as much for their
actions.
(iranted. Stanford students will not

suffer as much. This is because feder
al money only accounts for a quarter
of student need-based aid, according
to Cynthia Hartley, director of stu
dent awards in the Finanical Aid
Office.
It is extremely unfair that the
socioeconomic backgrounds of stu
dents will determine their punish
ments in these cases.
Why should Stanford students, or
students who do not receive federal
financial aid, pay any less for their
crimes?
Though the law was developed in
good faith and attempts to solve a
prevalent problem on college campus
es, there is little possiblity that it can
be evenly applied and money, unfortu
ately, separates those who pay for
their actions from those who don't.
What kind of message is our gov
ernment sending students around the
nation?
Furthermore, this law is going to be
dreadfully difficult to fully enforce. In
addition to finding enough bodies to
investigate cases, what incentive do
University administrators have to
report students who should have their
aid revoked by the federal govern
ment?
At its core, this law has good inten
tions. 1 lowever, the way in which it
will be enforced and the message it
sends are not consistent with its spirit.
We find it impossible to support a
law that applies such an uneven stan
dard to college students around this
countrv.
