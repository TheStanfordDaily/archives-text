Article misrepresented AKA
I am writing in response to Jamecca Mar
shall's article tin Playboy that appeared in
Wednesday's Daily. I was misquoted in that
article, and my interview responses were
taken totally out of context. I am very upset
hy this because her article made it seem as if
members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Xi Beta
Chapter had posed nude or displayed nude
pictures on the Web. I can assure you that
none of the members of AKA Xi Beta ('hap
ten Stanford I'Diversity, past or present,
have posed nude or posted nude pictures on
the Web.
I prefaced my conversation ..i'h Marshall
by saying that none of my membeis wen
interested in posing for Playboy. She then
asked me il there was a national policy in
Alpha Kappa Alpha against posing nude. I
said that I was not aware that there was a
written rule against such behavior (after all. it
is a personal decision), but I did not feel as if
the organization would approve or support a
member who chose to do so. When asked
why, I responded that I (.lid not feel as if such
conduct portrayed the type of image that
Alpha Kappa Alpha upholds.
In a completely separate part of the con
versation. I told Marshall of an incident
where a supposed member of Alpha Kappa
Alpha (not Stanford's chapter) posted nude
pictures on the Web. I told her that I was not
sure that was true because I myself had not
seen the pictures. I don't even know if the
woman was truly a member of the organiza
tion. A friend of mine was sending the pic
tures attached over an e-mail list, and
although I never saw the pictures. I noted to

Marshall that the comments I read over e
mail about this woman posting nude pictures
over the Web were negative.
I feel that Marshall owes my organization
an apology. I know that The Daily has a cor
rections page, but I feel like my organiza
tion's reputation is at stake as a result of her
desire to get some "juice" for her article. It is
my hope that The Daily will make sure that
everyone knows what was really said in that
interview.
Why am I so upset over the way my orga
nization was portrayed? Well. I love my
organization deeply, and I take my pledge it)
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. very seri
ously. 1 am a representative of Alpha Kappa
Alpha Sorority Inc. everywhere I go and in

for my chapter members, and I would like to
see this unfortunate incident resolved.

Lam ignores shared humanity
Edmund Lam submitted a forceful
response to comments I made in Wednes
day's Daily concerning the accidental bomb
ing ol the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. His
letter asked forceful, supposedly rhetorical
questions in order to argue for the withdraw
al of NA I'O troops from Kosovo. His letter
implied that I would have been enraged and
grief-stricken if American hostages were
killed in an embassy bombing.
Thinking he trapped me in his race-driven
rhetoric, he defiantly asked if I believed that
"the lives of three Chinese civilians are worth
less than three American soldiers."

Lam should know that NATO soldiers
have died in this conflict, and I am awed by
their sacrifice for the freedom of an
oppressed foreign people. Had Americans
been in the Chinese embassy at the time of
the NA TO bombing, I would have respond
ed even more resolutely about our need to
bomb Belgrade and to demonstrate to Slo
bodan Milosevic and his compatriots around
the world that ethnic cleansing will not be
acceptable in the 21st-century world order.
Lam correctly asserts that innocents have
been killed in this conflict. These tragic
deaths remind us of our moral imperative
against violence; if these deaths have pro
voked such grief from the ( hinese communi
ty. a repressive regime bent on systematizing
murder should precipitate a more forceful
surge from the humanitarian heart of China.
Killing to achieve an ultimate, lasting
peace is not the same thing as purposive mur
der consecrated by racism and bigotry.
I feel no greater allegiance to an Ameri
can than I do to a Chinese person, no greater
affinity for whites than people of color and
no preference for Catholics to Muslim
refugees. Although I am a white American
Catholic. I have struggled against the opiate
ol religion, the fetish of national identity and
the destructive pride of racial hegemony.
I do not value an American more than a
Chinese person, and I despise the assertion
that the death of someone who speaks your
language or shares your land deserves your
moral outrage, but the holocaust of a distant
people earns only your silence. This has been
the prejudice of humans, the illogical feeling
that your countrymen deserve more support
than those who share only your humanity.
I believe in this war, and if called upon to

fight I pray that I will have the mettle to face
oppression squarely and the strength to give
my life so that someone else will share in the
freedom I claim to love. I will fight because
my life is no more valuable than the lives of
your countrymen, and my soul no more wor
thy than the souls of the Kosovars whose
bodies rot in mass graves.
Though there is no moral calculus that
allows us to say that the deaths of hundreds
is less odious than the deaths of thousands, I
believe that we must stop appeasing. I hesi
tate to think of what historians of the next
century will write of a people who ignore
holocaust and pursue appeasement despite
the lessons of Munich and World War 11.
I do not take my moral cues from a nation
whose imperialism is known well to the peo
ple of Tibet, that values the lives of its
women less than its men and that tramples
on human rights for economic progress.
1 offer Lam the suggestion that perhaps
his nation might exploit an unfortunate mis
take to gain membership into the World
Trade Organization and distract its people
from the memory of Tienamen Square.
The hypocrisy here is that of the Chinese
government. Perhaps they should apologize
for or publicly acknowledge their decision to
take the lives of their students just 10 years
ago. It seems that they do not value the lives
of their countrymen as well as you might
think.
But if this is our morality, then bloodshed
am always be ignored if it protects our own
ideology and insulates us from the reality of
the ignominy of the human condition.
