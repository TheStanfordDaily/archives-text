THERE IS A time
in every man's
education when he
arrives at the conviction
that courtship is hazing.
That attending to a glow
ing and revered young
woman like a moth to a

streetlight whimpers out of tune with the
song of his essence. That courtship amounts
to little more than an insecurity-driven busi
ness deal whose ultimate object is the exclu
sive and unqualified ownership of another
human being's lusty desire, religious admi
ration and amorous affection, for all time.
That contemporary courtship attitudes are
degrading historical curses, the products of
unlucky contingency rather than of enlight
ened design.
In his private heart every man knows
that no real nourishment can come to him
Irom am fish lured from the ocean. Caught
fish do not choose their angler but the bait
on his hook, bait which was chosen by him
but which is plainly not him. None more
than he knows that this makes them less
sweet.
He also knows that despite the cry of
voices to the contrary, fishing is no exhila
rating sport. It is a game for the timid and
sedentary, which requires that he fixate on
and then deftly hook some fish with whom
he lias never swam.
He must abandon the protected bank,
throw down the cowardly rod and reel and
dive crown-first into whatever stream, lake
or ocean pleases him. enjoying those fish

that flock to him as he pursues his own pro
jects and eating only those fish that swim
eagerly into his mouth. To him no fish come
early or too late, and he pays no heed to
those that don't come at all.
Occasionally a particularly glorious fish
will swim by, and he will invite, as her guide
and benefactor, this fish into some part of
the course of his day. He does not affect a
foreign course for the sake of wooing this
fish. He deems his own ordinary day-to-day
routine as worthy of this fish's time and asks
her to join him for burritos with his buddies
rather than dinner in, say. North Beach.
He simply lacks any motive beyond
redeeming this fish's pallet by exposing her
to the best steak burrito ever cooked under
water.
Instead of deliberating whether to bait
his hook with cheese, worms or salmon
eggs, while eating a cheese sandwich on the
lonely river bank, he is pounding Coronas
and scarfing 1.5 pound burritos with this
sweet fish.
Whatever magic holds between him and
the fish will be quickly snuffed out by any
deal brokered during a Defining The Rela
tionship talk.
He knows that he cannot let even her
miraculous consumption of two burritos
drive him to push a contract which strips her
of her sovereignty and makes her his. Nur
ture possibility: his ear heeds that call.
Defining the relationship is a contractual
disease which loves not possibility and
magic but safety and routine. Nothing
which can be well parameterized by lan

guage is worth his or her time, and he refus
es to tragically destroy the wonder binding
the relationship with words. He refuses to
degrade the object of his affection by
attempting to manipulate her into any par
ticular course of action.
He refuses to woo her. He refuses to
court her. He refuses to betray his own
nature for her opinion. And in doing so he
grants both her and himself dignity that is
absent from all relationships spawned by
fishing-style courtship.
In traditional courtship, the fish tacitly
concedes to having been tricked by accept
ing the fisherman's lure. And the fisherman
tacitly concedes that he lacks his own value,
by pursuing such high degrees of artifice to
hook and reel in his fish.
There is much fun to be had in the mat
ing game. But even at its best, the fun of
fishing falls far short of the health, jov and
genius of swimming with a fish you have
begun to love. At its worst, fishing is a
degrading and awkward sport from which
no person profits.
Abandon lures. Cast down your rod and
step out of your awkward waders. Throw
the tackle box to the side of the road, along
with your clothes, and swim.
Know your worth. As philanthropist
rather than hunter, invite those fish that
swim well to join you and to fuse their hori
zons with vours.
