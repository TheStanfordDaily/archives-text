# Bringing it all back home
## Mark Silver Do you know the way to San Jose?

I'VE BEEN THINKING a lot lately
about what it means to he politically
and socially active. The protests and
hunger strikes up at Berkeley jolted me into
remembering that massive mobilization of
people power can actually achieve great
things. I listen to some Stanford students
derisively mock those hunger strikers,
chortling "Ethnic studies? What's the big
deal?" as they roar off in their SUVs. A
message to you, Rudy — don't criticize
what you can't understand.
But I've given up on transforming this
campus into a hotbed of radical activism.
The inertia of conversations devoted exclu
sively to the Draw prevents most kinds of
revolutionary talk. So if we're not radicals,
where do our ideological loyalties lie?
Most students at Stanford, with the
exception of the sometimes-humorous but
always ill-meaning writers at the Review,
would probably consider themselves liber
als. Although the word mostly disappeared
from our political lexicon with the glorious
defeat of Michael Dukakis in 1988 and the
subsequent rise of those crazy New
Democrats, liberalism seems to be firmly

entrenched on this campus as an easy and
better-sounding synonym for apathy.
What does it mean to be a liberal? Phil
Ochs defined liberals as being "Ten degrees
to the left of center in good times; 10
degrees to the right of center if it affects
them personally."
More concretely, 1 would say a liberal at
Stanford is one who is generally tolerant of
most kinds of people and who believes that
there is injustice and unequal opportunity in
the world that need to be gradually elimi
nated. But just don't ask a Stanford liberal
to do anything about it.
See, I don't think you can claim some
kind of belief in progress against the evils of
the world if you're sitting at home playing
MarioKart.
To be "moderately progressive." as the
Oxford American dictionary partly defines
a liberal, means that one must make moder
ate attempts to improve the world. Other
wise a liberal is nothing but a hypocrite,
relaxing comfortably numb in the luxury of
the status quo.
With all of the above in mind. I'd like to
tell all of you liberals about an opportunity

to do something; to participate in an activi
ty that adheres to the rules of our system but
is moderately progressive enough to get you
up off your couch.
For the past four months or so. I've been
volunteering with a program called Young
Heroes. Young Heroes takes middle-school
students from all over the South Bay and
gets them involved in something called ser
vice learning. My basic understanding of
service learning is that it's learning by doing.
A particular issue is picked, such as home
lessness. and people learn about the issue
and how it affects their community by
engaging in activities and service that some
how make an impact on that issue and on
their own understanding and growth.
So just about every Saturday for a period
of five months. I've headed to downtown
San Jose to meet my fellow team leader and
all of the members of my team. Team lead
ers. all of just about college age or a little
older, head-up a group of five to 15 kids. 11
to 14 years old. all of whom have given up
the first da\ of their weekend to do some
go< >d.
So what exactlv have we done? We've

learned about homelessness and then visit
ed a shelter to spend time with kids there.
We've listened to a talk about the environ
ment and then planted trees along a high
way. We've discussed issues of diversity and
then painted murals at an elementary
school illustrating our own diverse cultures.
We've listened to accounts of survivors of
domestic violence and then distributed fliers
with emergency numbers to homes in the
surrounding community.
I hese are not revolutionary acts. Young
Heroes doesn't want to overthrow the capi
talist pig establishment. All it wants is to
educate and motivate young people about
some of the major issues in our world and
communities, to get them actively involved
and to show them concrete results of doing
service. This program is a moderately pro
gressive liberal's dream.
All that aside, the best thing about
Young Heroes for me has been the kids.
I his is no "privileged college kid working
with inner-city ghetto youth ends all gang
warfare" kind of movie, so leave your
upper-class guilt here on campus. Young
Heroes kids come from all kinds of eco

nomic and cultural backgrounds, and they
don't want you to patronize them. They
want to talk to you, listen to you. learn from
you and have a good time with you.
I'm not saying it's so easy. We all remem
ber how much fun middle school was —
well, it hasn't gotten any better. And yes,
sometimes it's even more difficult to talk to
a 13-year-old girl than it is to relate to a 19-
year-old Stanford woman. But it's more
than worth it. I've met so many cool kids
and heard so many amazing stories, some
hilarious, others horribly sad. You don't get
that kind of opportunity at Stanford.
So that's my idea for dropping your man
tle of hypocrisy and acting on your liberal
ideals. Get involved in Young Heroes or do
another program, but do something. We
don't have to be radicals, but we sure as hell
can escape from our apathy.
