'...the call of Jesus can go unheard. But it's out there if you want it.'
— Aaron Hopkins, member of Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship

Every Sunday a few thousand Stanford students put
aside their studies, don nice outfits and head off to church.
Approximately 325 Protestants and 1,250 Roman
Catholics fill the pews in Memorial Church each week
end. Many head off campus for their worship, to churches
such as Menlo Park Presbyterian Church and the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on Stanford Ave.
But the worship doesn't always end Sunday afternoon.
Instead, tor a large number, it is only the beginning.
Youth groups and other organizations on campus provide
the University's Christian population with an opportuni
ty to form relationships with other students who share
their same religious background and interests.
Protestant Christian groups on campus number 13.
and there are also groups for Catholics. Mormons and
those who are Greek Orthodox.
With approximately one-quarter to one-third of each
admitted class indicating a religious preference, according
to the Office of Religious Life, there are ample ways to get
involved with Christianity at Stanford.
(■etting involved
Most students do seem to agree that if one wants to be
come part of Christian life on campus, there are many
possible ways to do so.
Sometimes students are sought out and informed
about the various opportunities available, like freshman
Kristen Derr.
"It was really easy to get involved." she said. "I filled
out a religious preference card, and I was contacted over
the summer by a couple of Christian groups. At first 1
spent time trying out all of the different groups. They're
all good, it's just whatever is best for you."
