## For some of its Christians, Stanford offers ways to grow religiously amidst academia

'...the call of Jesus can go unheard. But it's out there if you want it.'
— Aaron Hopkins, member of Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship

Every Sunday a few thousand Stanford students put
aside their studies, don nice outfits and head off to church.
Approximately 325 Protestants and 1,250 Roman
Catholics fill the pews in Memorial Church each week
end. Many head off campus for their worship, to churches
such as Menlo Park Presbyterian Church and the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on Stanford Ave.
But the worship doesn't always end Sunday afternoon.
Instead, tor a large number, it is only the beginning.
Youth groups and other organizations on campus provide
the University's Christian population with an opportuni
ty to form relationships with other students who share
their same religious background and interests.
Protestant Christian groups on campus number 13.
and there are also groups for Catholics. Mormons and
those who are Greek Orthodox.
With approximately one-quarter to one-third of each
admitted class indicating a religious preference, according
to the Office of Religious Life, there are ample ways to get
involved with Christianity at Stanford.
(■etting involved
Most students do seem to agree that if one wants to be
come part of Christian life on campus, there are many
possible ways to do so.
Sometimes students are sought out and informed
about the various opportunities available, like freshman
Kristen Derr.
"It was really easy to get involved." she said. "I filled
out a religious preference card, and I was contacted over
the summer by a couple of Christian groups. At first 1
spent time trying out all of the different groups. They're
all good, it's just whatever is best for you."

Many students have said that their
religious experiences have been fur
thered in college.
"T here are abundant opportuni
ties to get involved with C hristian life
at Stanford," said senior Paul Taylor,
co-facilitor of United in Christ, a
group that includes representatives
from all evangelical Christian groups
on campus. "Although the general at
mosphere is not terribly conducive to
being a Christian, my faith has
thrived and grown tremendously
here."
Taylor added that intellectual
challenges and I Jniversity teachings
that put an emphasis on a worldly
view tend to make it difficult to focus
on religion.
However the atmosphere does
not prevent those who do want to
practice Christianity and strengthen
their faith from doing so, according to
Daniel Clcndenin, a member of In
ter Varsity ( hristian Fellowship.
If a student or faculty member re
ally wants to strengthen their ('hrist
ian lilc, there are excellent opportuni
ties not only with local churches but
with on-campus ministries." he said.
Freshman Isaac Camp not only
took the initiative to maintain his own
( hi isti;in beliefs but leads a Bible
study group ol lour to five wrestlers
every Friday afternoon as well.
( amp is a member of Athletes in
Action, a < hi istian group for student
athletes on campus.
Within Athletes in Action there
are "growth groups," which are
smallei and more personal. T his is the
lust ycai there has been a Bible study
set up for wrestlers Camps group.
(irowtli groups are made up
mostly ol confirmed Christians who
arc trying to strengthen their faith,"
he said.
"I lowever the wrestling group is
slightly different since it was recently
created. I or the most part they're all
guys who've had some experience
with ( hristianity in the past, and now
they're re exploring it."

Diversity in groups
Since there are so many different
groups available on campus for stu
dents to join — such as Cornerstone
and Fellowship in Christ at Stanford
most interested people gravitate
toward a group that consists of mem
bers who they feel linked to in some
way.
These common traits could in
clude ethnicity and socio-economic
background, among others. For in
stance. there is ( hinese ( hristian Fel
lowship at Stanford, which includes a
Chinese majority. Inter Varsity Chris
tian Fellowship is approximately 85
percent Asian American and 15 per
cent white, with a sprinkling of stu
dents from other races. Cornerstone
has mostly white members.
"The Christian groups on campus
are very racially segregated." fresh
man Noah Smith said.
Some question whether this sepa
ration of backgrounds is positive.
"We do have a range of ethnicity,
but we would like the group to be a bit
more diverse than it is," said Derr, a
member of Cornerstone. "Our goal is
for anyone to feel welcome."
Camp said these divisions tend to
be more of a result of human nature
than an actual effort to form cliquish
youth groups.
"People are generally more com
fortable learning about Clod with
people they feel comfortable with,"
he said. "If I wanted to visit a youth
group that had a Chinese majority,
I'm sure they wouldn't push me away.
It's mainly just a personal preference
type of thing."
Interim Dean for Religious Life
Rev. Kelly Denton-Borhaug said
some groups tend to be more diverse
than others.
"Students of many diverse back
grounds and classes participate in the
C atholic community," she said. "I do
think that some of the religious
groups may be gatherings where peo
ple of similar backgrounds and com
mitments find commonality and
comfort in being with one another.
At the same time many of these same
smaller groups do come together for
larger events."
United in Christ isa group that has

representatives from at least 11 dif
ferent Christian communities on
campus. It works with individual
groups to organize campus worship
efforts.
United in Christ "pretty much
represents the Christian body at
Stanford, creating a tangible organi
zation that totally increases commu
nication and coordinates campus
wide events such as All Campus
Praise nights," said sophomore Jan
ice Aim, a member of Fellowship in
( hrist at Stanford. "I'd say there's di
versity within and between fellow
ships. Each has its own flavor, but in
the end all come together because we
are united through Jesus. - '
Aaron Hopkins, who works with
Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship,
echoed Alms statement.
"I don't perceive of any divisions
between the various groups," he said.
"In fact there seems to be a really
healthy spirit of cooperation. A cou
ple weeks ago all the C 'hrist ian groups
went away on a retreat together, and
at least once a quarter the groups
gather to worship God together."
Freshman Colleen Flaherty said
there doesn't seem to be any group ri
valry. "There are a lot of groups, but 1
don't think these groups are compet
ing," she said. "It's like, 'Oh, you're in
a Bible study group, that's really
cool,' not 'Which one are you in?" "
Because there are a large number
of different youth groups, Hopkins
noted, one must try and find one on
which to focus his or her attention.
"Even though the groups are out
there, it definitely takes some initia
tive to take advantage of what they
offer," he said. " There are so many
other activities clamoring for our
time and devotion that the call of
Jesus and the Christian community
can go unheard. But it's out there if
you want it."
No pressure to join
Students have commented that
the lack of emphasis on religion at
Stanford doesn't make them feel
pushed to join a group.
Freshman Sarah Matics lives in
Twain, a dorm in Stern Hall often

stereotyped as being an "Asian-
Christian'" dorm.
"I believe, based on observation,
that Christianity is among the promi
nent religious beliefs in Twain," she
said. "Thankfully I don't feel this di
vides the dorm in any way. I am glad
to be in a dorm where religious views
and perspectives different from mine
are openly embraced. I enjoy the
many belief systems brought to the
dinner table during a discussion, and
I think the Christians in our dorm
strengthen the dorm as a whole."
Smith, who lives in Twain, said the
dorm's stereotype is exaggerated.
"Basically there are two ('hristian
draw groups in Twain." he said. "Out
of those two. one is made up of six
Asian girls who are members of In
ter Varsity Christian Fellowship.
Then there is a group of guys who are
in Fellowship in Christ at Stanford.
That's 12 to 13 people out of l()6,
which is not a very high percentage at
all."
"I don't really think it's a big deal,
but the rest of (lie campus seems to
think so. So maybe it is," Smith
added.
Matics said she has never received
any religious pressure from her peers.
"I have never been pressured to
join a Christian group on campus,
and I enjoy that about Stanford," she
said. "I like the freedom to believe
how I choose and to feel still accepted
by those around me. I think people
tend to be among the more open
minded. and overall I think there is
great respect among peers, faculty
and staff."
Flaherty agreed. "I've never felt
any negative pressure to join," she
said. " The groups are really happy if
you do join, but it's cool if you don't."
1 jfe-long religious behavior
By and large, students coming to
Stanford who express an interest in
joining a Christian group have had
previous religious training or back
ground. Those who weren't raised
going to church every Sunday gener
ally don't start once they come to col
lege.
"Before coming to Stanford I was

not a very religious person," Catholie
freshman Alee Detwiler said. "I don't
think there is any real push to be reli
gious here either. I've found that I've
been able to establish for myself my
own views on religion without pres
sure from my family or society. When
I do go to church, it's because I want
to go. v
Freshman Rob Person, a Presby
terian, added that going to church
during college is different from at
tending church during childhood
with parents.
"I feel that being here with more
independence requires more disci
pline to be active in a religious com
munity," lie said. "But based on what
I've seen, there are plenty of religious
opportunities for students if they wish
to look for them."
However some students have said
they have become less religious since
coming to Stanford due to the lack of
emphasis placed on religious prac
tices.
"I came from a Catholic school
where we had prayers and Bible
study everyday." freshman Brent Vil
lalobos said. "But here 1 go to my one
hour of church 011 Sunday, and then
alter that religion doesn't really
apply. I don't really have a group of
people to go with, which is different
because my whole life I've gone with
family."
Villalobos said sometimes he
thinks that college students don't
take into account the Christian
lifestyles of their peers.
"The school doesn't really plan 011
people involved in activities having a
religious life," lie said. "For instance,
during Winter One Acts. I had prac
tice from 4 to 6 p.m. 011 Sundays. I
don't know if people would have un
derstood the excuse that 1 had to
leave to go to Mass" at 4:30 p.lll.
Religion at other universities
How does the presence of Chris
tianity at Stanford compare to its
presence at other universities?
As Human Biology Prof. Herant
Katchadourian wrote in his study of
Stanford graduates. "Cream of the
Crop: The Impact of Elite Education

in the Decade After College," it does
seem apparent that those who attend
college are less religious than others.
In a survey of Harvard and Stan
ford alumni published in
Katchadourian's book, researchers
found that, in a control group from
the general population, 53 percent
said religion was an important part of
their lives. Among the alumni only 24
percent said the same.
However there do exist differ
ences between schools.
According to Christine Brown
from the Religious Life Office at
Princeton, 35 percent of students are
Protestant and 25 percent are
( atholic at her university.
This is a much higher percentage
than the approximately 25 to 33 per
cent who claim to be religious at Stan
lord.
At Harvard things are reversed,
said Harvard freshman Patrick
Crosetto.
"There is no pressure to join any
( hristian group at 1 farvard." he said.
"In fact I would say the opposite. You
are frowned upon if you go to church
often by many people. I think that
many kids don't know about the reli
gious opportunities here."
I larvard freshman Rich ("hen also
said religion at Harvard tends to be
downplayed by scholars.
"('hristianity does not seem like a
big deal here." he said. "Some have
even expressed the feeling that Chris
tianity is not taken seriously by the in
tellectual community, although the
Christian groups that I've talked to
said that this is changing."
At UC-Berkcley. Ann Hsueh, a
member of Berkeley Christian Fel
lowship. said there are many of op
portunities to get involved in Chris
tianity despite the school's liberal
reputation.
" There are definitely enough op
port unities on campus to get involved
with the Christian lifestyle," she said.
"There are numerous Christian fel
lowships here of all different kinds of
denominations, so if one so chooses,
he or she can actually look around for
a fellowship or Bible study that suits
his or her needs in terms of faith and
searching tor the truth."

are very racially segregated." fresh
man Noah Smith said.
Some question whether this sepa
ration of backgrounds is positive.
"We do have a range of ethnicity,
but we would like the group to be a bit
more diverse than it is," said Derr, a
member of Cornerstone. "Our goal is
for anyone to feel welcome."
Camp said these divisions tend to
be more of a result of human nature
than an actual effort to form cliquish
youth groups.
"People are generally more com
fortable learning about Clod with
people they feel comfortable with,"
he said. "If I wanted to visit a youth
group that had a Chinese majority,
I'm sure they wouldn't push me away.
It's mainly just a personal preference
type of thing."
Interim Dean for Religious Life
Rev. Kelly Denton-Borhaug said
some groups tend to be more diverse
than others.
"Students of many diverse back
grounds and classes participate in the
C atholic community," she said. "I do
think that some of the religious
groups may be gatherings where peo
ple of similar backgrounds and com
mitments find commonality and
comfort in being with one another.
At the same time many of these same
smaller groups do come together for
larger events."
United in Christ isa group that has

representatives from at least 11 dif
ferent Christian communities on
campus. It works with individual
groups to organize campus worship
efforts.
United in Christ "pretty much
represents the Christian body at
Stanford, creating a tangible organi
zation that totally increases commu
nication and coordinates campus
wide events such as All Campus
Praise nights," said sophomore Jan
ice Aim, a member of Fellowship in
( hrist at Stanford. "I'd say there's di
versity within and between fellow
ships. Each has its own flavor, but in
the end all come together because we
are united through Jesus. - '
Aaron Hopkins, who works with
Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship,
echoed Alms statement.
"I don't perceive of any divisions
between the various groups," he said.
"In fact there seems to be a really
healthy spirit of cooperation. A cou
ple weeks ago all the C 'hrist ian groups
went away on a retreat together, and
at least once a quarter the groups
gather to worship God together."
Freshman Colleen Flaherty said
there doesn't seem to be any group ri
valry. "There are a lot of groups, but 1
don't think these groups are compet
ing," she said. "It's like, 'Oh, you're in
a Bible study group, that's really
cool,' not 'Which one are you in?" "
Because there are a large number
of different youth groups, Hopkins
noted, one must try and find one on
which to focus his or her attention.
"Even though the groups are out
there, it definitely takes some initia
tive to take advantage of what they
offer," he said. " There are so many
other activities clamoring for our
time and devotion that the call of
Jesus and the Christian community
can go unheard. But it's out there if
you want it."
No pressure to join
Students have commented that
the lack of emphasis on religion at
Stanford doesn't make them feel
pushed to join a group.
Freshman Sarah Matics lives in
Twain, a dorm in Stern Hall often

stereotyped as being an "Asian-
Christian'" dorm.
"I believe, based on observation,
that Christianity is among the promi
nent religious beliefs in Twain," she
said. "Thankfully I don't feel this di
vides the dorm in any way. I am glad
to be in a dorm where religious views
and perspectives different from mine
are openly embraced. I enjoy the
many belief systems brought to the
dinner table during a discussion, and
I think the Christians in our dorm
strengthen the dorm as a whole."
Smith, who lives in Twain, said the
dorm's stereotype is exaggerated.
"Basically there are two ('hristian
draw groups in Twain." he said. "Out
of those two. one is made up of six
Asian girls who are members of In
ter Varsity Christian Fellowship.
Then there is a group of guys who are
in Fellowship in Christ at Stanford.
That's 12 to 13 people out of l()6,
which is not a very high percentage at
all."
"I don't really think it's a big deal,
but the rest of (lie campus seems to
think so. So maybe it is," Smith
added.
Matics said she has never received
any religious pressure from her peers.
"I have never been pressured to
join a Christian group on campus,
and I enjoy that about Stanford," she
said. "I like the freedom to believe
how I choose and to feel still accepted
by those around me. I think people
tend to be among the more open
minded. and overall I think there is
great respect among peers, faculty
and staff."
Flaherty agreed. "I've never felt
any negative pressure to join," she
said. " The groups are really happy if
you do join, but it's cool if you don't."
1 jfe-long religious behavior
By and large, students coming to
Stanford who express an interest in
joining a Christian group have had
previous religious training or back
ground. Those who weren't raised
going to church every Sunday gener
ally don't start once they come to col
lege.
"Before coming to Stanford I was

not a very religious person," Catholie
freshman Alee Detwiler said. "I don't
think there is any real push to be reli
gious here either. I've found that I've
been able to establish for myself my
own views on religion without pres
sure from my family or society. When
I do go to church, it's because I want
to go. v
Freshman Rob Person, a Presby
terian, added that going to church
during college is different from at
tending church during childhood
with parents.
"I feel that being here with more
independence requires more disci
pline to be active in a religious com
munity," lie said. "But based on what
I've seen, there are plenty of religious
opportunities for students if they wish
to look for them."
However some students have said
they have become less religious since
coming to Stanford due to the lack of
emphasis placed on religious prac
tices.
"I came from a Catholic school
where we had prayers and Bible
study everyday." freshman Brent Vil
lalobos said. "But here 1 go to my one
hour of church 011 Sunday, and then
alter that religion doesn't really
apply. I don't really have a group of
people to go with, which is different
because my whole life I've gone with
family."
Villalobos said sometimes he
thinks that college students don't
take into account the Christian
lifestyles of their peers.
"The school doesn't really plan 011
people involved in activities having a
religious life," lie said. "For instance,
during Winter One Acts. I had prac
tice from 4 to 6 p.m. 011 Sundays. I
don't know if people would have un
derstood the excuse that 1 had to
leave to go to Mass" at 4:30 p.lll.
Religion at other universities
How does the presence of Chris
tianity at Stanford compare to its
presence at other universities?
As Human Biology Prof. Herant
Katchadourian wrote in his study of
Stanford graduates. "Cream of the
Crop: The Impact of Elite Education

in the Decade After College," it does
seem apparent that those who attend
college are less religious than others.
In a survey of Harvard and Stan
ford alumni published in
Katchadourian's book, researchers
found that, in a control group from
the general population, 53 percent
said religion was an important part of
their lives. Among the alumni only 24
percent said the same.
However there do exist differ
ences between schools.
According to Christine Brown
from the Religious Life Office at
Princeton, 35 percent of students are
Protestant and 25 percent are
( atholic at her university.
This is a much higher percentage
than the approximately 25 to 33 per
cent who claim to be religious at Stan
lord.
At Harvard things are reversed,
said Harvard freshman Patrick
Crosetto.
"There is no pressure to join any
( hristian group at 1 farvard." he said.
"In fact I would say the opposite. You
are frowned upon if you go to church
often by many people. I think that
many kids don't know about the reli
gious opportunities here."
I larvard freshman Rich ("hen also
said religion at Harvard tends to be
downplayed by scholars.
"('hristianity does not seem like a
big deal here." he said. "Some have
even expressed the feeling that Chris
tianity is not taken seriously by the in
tellectual community, although the
Christian groups that I've talked to
said that this is changing."
At UC-Berkcley. Ann Hsueh, a
member of Berkeley Christian Fel
lowship. said there are many of op
portunities to get involved in Chris
tianity despite the school's liberal
reputation.
" There are definitely enough op
port unities on campus to get involved
with the Christian lifestyle," she said.
"There are numerous Christian fel
lowships here of all different kinds of
denominations, so if one so chooses,
he or she can actually look around for
a fellowship or Bible study that suits
his or her needs in terms of faith and
searching tor the truth."
'...the call of Jesus can go unheard. But it's out there if you want it.'
— Aaron Hopkins, member of Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship

Every Sunday a few thousand Stanford students put
aside their studies, don nice outfits and head off to church.
Approximately 325 Protestants and 1,250 Roman
Catholics fill the pews in Memorial Church each week
end. Many head off campus for their worship, to churches
such as Menlo Park Presbyterian Church and the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on Stanford Ave.
But the worship doesn't always end Sunday afternoon.
Instead, tor a large number, it is only the beginning.
Youth groups and other organizations on campus provide
the University's Christian population with an opportuni
ty to form relationships with other students who share
their same religious background and interests.
Protestant Christian groups on campus number 13.
and there are also groups for Catholics. Mormons and
those who are Greek Orthodox.
With approximately one-quarter to one-third of each
admitted class indicating a religious preference, according
to the Office of Religious Life, there are ample ways to get
involved with Christianity at Stanford.
(■etting involved
Most students do seem to agree that if one wants to be
come part of Christian life on campus, there are many
possible ways to do so.
Sometimes students are sought out and informed
about the various opportunities available, like freshman
Kristen Derr.
"It was really easy to get involved." she said. "I filled
out a religious preference card, and I was contacted over
the summer by a couple of Christian groups. At first 1
spent time trying out all of the different groups. They're
all good, it's just whatever is best for you."


Matt Ehrlichman — Daily
Many students have said that their
religious experiences have been fur
thered in college.
"T here are abundant opportuni
ties to get involved with C hristian life
at Stanford," said senior Paul Taylor,
co-facilitor of United in Christ, a
group that includes representatives
from all evangelical Christian groups
on campus. "Although the general at
mosphere is not terribly conducive to
being a Christian, my faith has
thrived and grown tremendously
here."
Taylor added that intellectual
challenges and I Jniversity teachings
that put an emphasis on a worldly
view tend to make it difficult to focus
on religion.
However the atmosphere does
not prevent those who do want to
practice Christianity and strengthen
their faith from doing so, according to
Daniel Clcndenin, a member of In
ter Varsity ( hristian Fellowship.
If a student or faculty member re
ally wants to strengthen their ('hrist
ian lilc, there are excellent opportuni
ties not only with local churches but
with on-campus ministries." he said.
Freshman Isaac Camp not only
took the initiative to maintain his own
( hi isti;in beliefs but leads a Bible
study group ol lour to five wrestlers
every Friday afternoon as well.
( amp is a member of Athletes in
Action, a < hi istian group for student
athletes on campus.
Within Athletes in Action there
are "growth groups," which are
smallei and more personal. T his is the
lust ycai there has been a Bible study
set up for wrestlers Camps group.
(irowtli groups are made up
mostly ol confirmed Christians who
arc trying to strengthen their faith,"
he said.
"I lowever the wrestling group is
slightly different since it was recently
created. I or the most part they're all
guys who've had some experience
with ( hristianity in the past, and now
they're re exploring it."

Diversity in groups
Since there are so many different
groups available on campus for stu
dents to join — such as Cornerstone
and Fellowship in Christ at Stanford
most interested people gravitate
toward a group that consists of mem
bers who they feel linked to in some
way.
These common traits could in
clude ethnicity and socio-economic
background, among others. For in
stance. there is ( hinese ( hristian Fel
lowship at Stanford, which includes a
Chinese majority. Inter Varsity Chris
tian Fellowship is approximately 85
percent Asian American and 15 per
cent white, with a sprinkling of stu
dents from other races. Cornerstone
has mostly white members.
"The Christian groups on campus
are very racially segregated." fresh

which is not a very high percentage at
all."
"I don't really think it's a big deal,
but the rest of (lie campus seems to
think so. So maybe it is," Smith
added.
Matics said she has never received
any religious pressure from her peers.
"I have never been pressured to
join a Christian group on campus,
and I enjoy that about Stanford," she
said. "I like the freedom to believe
how I choose and to feel still accepted
by those around me. I think people
tend to be among the more open
minded. and overall I think there is
great respect among peers, faculty
and staff."
Flaherty agreed. "I've never felt
any negative pressure to join," she
said. " The groups are really happy if
you do join, but it's cool if you don't."
1 jfe-long religious behavior
By and large, students coming to
Stanford who express an interest in
joining a Christian group have had
previous religious training or back
ground. Those who weren't raised
going to church every Sunday gener
ally don't start once they come to col
lege.
"Before coming to Stanford I was

not a very religious person," Catholie
freshman Alee Detwiler said. "I don't
think there is any real push to be reli
gious here either. I've found that I've
been able to establish for myself my
own views on religion without pres
sure from my family or society. When
I do go to church, it's because I want
to go. v
Freshman Rob Person, a Presby
terian, added that going to church
during college is different from at
tending church during childhood
with parents.
"I feel that being here with more
independence requires more disci
pline to be active in a religious com
munity," lie said. "But based on what
I've seen, there are plenty of religious
opportunities for students if they wish
to look for them."
However some students have said
they have become less religious since
coming to Stanford due to the lack of
emphasis placed on religious prac
tices.
"I came from a Catholic school
where we had prayers and Bible
study everyday." freshman Brent Vil
lalobos said. "But here 1 go to my one
hour of church 011 Sunday, and then
alter that religion doesn't really
apply. I don't really have a group of
people to go with, which is different
because my whole life I've gone with
family."
Villalobos said sometimes he
thinks that college students don't
take into account the Christian
lifestyles of their peers.
"The school doesn't really plan 011
people involved in activities having a
religious life," lie said. "For instance,
during Winter One Acts. I had prac
tice from 4 to 6 p.m. 011 Sundays. I
don't know if people would have un
derstood the excuse that 1 had to
leave to go to Mass" at 4:30 p.lll.
Religion at other universities
How does the presence of Chris
tianity at Stanford compare to its
presence at other universities?
As Human Biology Prof. Herant
Katchadourian wrote in his study of
Stanford graduates. "Cream of the
Crop: The Impact of Elite Education

in the Decade After College," it does
seem apparent that those who attend
college are less religious than others.
In a survey of Harvard and Stan
ford alumni published in
Katchadourian's book, researchers
found that, in a control group from
the general population, 53 percent
said religion was an important part of
their lives. Among the alumni only 24
percent said the same.
However there do exist differ
ences between schools.
According to Christine Brown
from the Religious Life Office at
Princeton, 35 percent of students are
Protestant and 25 percent are
( atholic at her university.
This is a much higher percentage
than the approximately 25 to 33 per
cent who claim to be religious at Stan
lord.
At Harvard things are reversed,
said Harvard freshman Patrick
Crosetto.
"There is no pressure to join any
( hristian group at 1 farvard." he said.
"In fact I would say the opposite. You
are frowned upon if you go to church
often by many people. I think that
many kids don't know about the reli
gious opportunities here."
I larvard freshman Rich ("hen also
said religion at Harvard tends to be
downplayed by scholars.
"('hristianity does not seem like a
big deal here." he said. "Some have
even expressed the feeling that Chris
tianity is not taken seriously by the in
tellectual community, although the
Christian groups that I've talked to
said that this is changing."
At UC-Berkcley. Ann Hsueh, a
member of Berkeley Christian Fel
lowship. said there are many of op
portunities to get involved in Chris
tianity despite the school's liberal
reputation.
" There are definitely enough op
port unities on campus to get involved
with the Christian lifestyle," she said.
"There are numerous Christian fel
lowships here of all different kinds of
denominations, so if one so chooses,
he or she can actually look around for
a fellowship or Bible study that suits
his or her needs in terms of faith and
searching tor the truth."
