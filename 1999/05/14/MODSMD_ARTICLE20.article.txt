1 he battle for tickets to attend opening-day
screenings of the long-awaited Star Wars
"Episode I: The Phantom Menace" began ear
lier this week, and most Stanford students
emerged triumphant.
Tickets for the first installment of the much
hyped prequel went on sale at noon Wednesday
in theaters across the country. The film will be
released nationwide on M;iy 19.
Stanford students were among the first in
line at theaters all over the Bay Area. Some stu
dents tried other methods, crashing the Web
and jamming telephone lines in an effort to se
cure tickets without enduring the hassle of enor
mous lines.
Junior Shawn Pacheco, a Star Wars fan who
has "been waiting 16 years since the last film was
released," had never been to the Coronet The
ater in San Francisco until Tuesday afternoon.
"I heard it was a really nice place, 1.3(H) seats,
great sound, big screen," he said. "So I drove
into San Francisco at 5 p.m. and there were ISO
people already in line. The die-hards had been

there for two weeks."
Pacheco set up his tent outside the theater at
around midnight and slept sparingly.
"It was a pretty interesting experience,
camping out on a regular street corner," he said.
"I missed out on the whole hvpe in 1977. and I
wanted to recreate that and live it through this
[film)."
Tickets went on sale at the Coronet an hour
early, but the lines moved slowly, according to
Pacheco.
"It took me four hours to purchase the tick
ets. They only had one or two cashiers at the
time," he said.
However, the wait proved worthwhile,
Pacheco said, a communications major. I le se
cured 15 tickets to the 7 p.m. show on opening
day. He plans on leaving for San Francisco with
his friends three or four hours before the
screening begins next Wednesday to get good
seats.
Brian Wirt/., a senior psychology major, ar
rived at the AMC Mercado 20 theater in Sun
nyvale early Wednesday morning, setting up
camp at 2 a.m. Wirt/ said people kept arriving at

all hours of the night.
Wirt/ and his friends purchased around 75
tickets to the 12:01 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. showings
on opening day.and he said he plans on attend
ing both. Other friends considered selling their
extra tickets for as much as 15 to 20 dollars
apiece.
"I enjoyed sleeping out probably as much as
I'm going to enjoy the movie, but I'm never
going to do it again," Wirt/, said.
Co-terminal computer science student Matt
Blythe found that other avenues for obtaining
tickets proved just as successful, without leaving
the comfort of campus.
Blythe organized a phone assault on local
theaters and the 777-FILM ticket service with
the help of his Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
brothers. They also used their Internet
browsers to order tickets through Web-based
sellers, according to Blythe.
"I researched various movie theaters and
their policies and found that there was no pref
erence for people standing in line versus calling
or using the Web," Blythe said.
Blvthe still faces the challenge of distributing

30 tickets in two different
theaters among his friends.
However, he believes his
efforts were verv success-

ful and a lot less tiring than other possible pur
suits.
"We were very happy we didn't have to sleep
out and still got all the tickets we wanted." he
said.
Junior Chaney Rankin considered all possi
ble ticket-buying scenarios and decided to park
her van in front of the Century Cinema 16 in
Mountain View.
"We heard about the Internet and phone
methods," she said, "but sleeping out was a sure
thing instead of not knowing whether or not
you're going to get through."
Rankin and her friends bought the maxi
mum allowed 12 tickets each for the 12:01 a.m.
showing.
Pacheco found that most people came away
from the theaters happy.
"I think anyone who wanted tickets and put
a halfway decent amount of effort into it got
tickets," he said.
