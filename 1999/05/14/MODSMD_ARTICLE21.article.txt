## Lawyer attempts to make history Senior tries for third Pac-10 heptathlon title 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
While Stanford plays host to its
third consecutive meet this weekend,
much of the focus for the women's
track and field team will be in Tempe,
Ariz., for the heptathlon portion of
the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships.

WOMEN'S TRACK
■ Tomorrow: Stanford competes in
Cardinal Qualifier at Stanford's
Cobb Track and Angell Field.

Senior Tracye Lawyer will be at
tempting the first three-peat in that
event in Pac-IO history at the Sun
Devil Stadium.
Lawyer, also a standout on the
women's soccer team, is looking to
improve upon her career-best 5,8(W
points that she scored last year when

the meet was held at Stanford. After
winning the Mt.San Antonio College
heptathlon earlier this season.
Lawyer appears primed to make his
tory.
Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na is confident that Lawyer is ready
to go and has overcome the nagging
injuries that slowed her throughout
the indoor track season.
"She is about healthy as she's
been." Lananna said. "I think that
she's faster and stronger than she's
ever been — we've been really care
ful not to over-compete her and I'm
pretty confident that unless some
thing weird happens, she should do
real well."
Lawyer will need to get out to a
strong start Friday, when her
strongest events of the 100-meter
hurdles, long jump and high jump are

competed, to set herself up for a fa
vorable outcome Saturday.
While Lananna is certainly excit
ed about the possibility of going into
the rest of the Pac-10 Championships
next weekend with 10 points on the
board, he stresses that this is just one
step along the way.
"Our main focus is to get her
doing real well at the NCAAs, to
make the World University Team
and to put her into a position where
she can potentially qualify for the
World Championships," Lananna
said.
On the Farm Saturday will be the
Cardinal Qualifier. The meet, which
serves as the last chance for athletes
to hit qualifying standards, hopes to
pick up where last week's Cardinal
Invitational left off.
The highlight event for the
women will be the 1,500 meters.

Stacked with talent including Stan
ford's Sally Glynn and Mary Cobb,
Colorado's Kara Wheeler and Carrie
Messner, as well as post-collegiates
Staci Sneider, Suzy Jones and Liz
Cotter, the race looks to be a treat for
track fans.
"Our women's 1,500 should live
up to its expectations," Lananna said.
"We'll have it rabitted. We're hoping
for a big group of people to run sig
nificantly under 4:1 H fthe NCAA au
tomatic qualifying time]."
Of the two Stanford runners, only
(bbb has beat that time, but it will be
her first time racing the 1.5(H) in two
years. After qualifying for NCAAs in
the S,(XH) last weekend, this race will
help to clarify Cobb's goals — or
then again if she has a great perfor
mance. it could complicate them. For
(ilynn. who is likely to compete in the
S.(XH) at nationals, the race serves as a
chance to work on her speed while
possibly going after the 4:17.2 stan
dard for the USA Outdoor Champi
onships.
