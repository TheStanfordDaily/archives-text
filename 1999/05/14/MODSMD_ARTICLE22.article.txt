Track meets at Stanford's Cobb
Track and Angell Field tend to de
velop into more than mere sporting
events. Records are set. milestones
are passed and top performances
are churned out in nearly every
event.

MEW'S TRACK
■ Tomorrow: Stanford competes in
Cardinal Qualifier at Stanford's
Cobb Track and Angell Field.

And though last Friday s Cardi
nal Invitational will be a hard act to
follow, tomorrow's Cardinal Quali
fier will no doubt produce all the
thrills and excitement expected ol a
Stanford-hosted meet.
A glance at the list of competing
schools gives indication that the
competition will be interesting at
the very least. Colorado and Boise
State will make appearances, along
with strong squads from Valparaiso
and North Carolina State. A group
of Mexican runners will also make
an appearance in the distance
races.
Cardinal head coach Vin Lanan
na indicated that Stanford will com
pete with between 25 and 30 ath

letes in the meet, mainly in the mid
dle distances and throws.
"We'll have a group of guys run
ning the 8(H), the redshirt guys [ju
nior Michael Stember. sophomores
Gabe Jennings and Jonathan Riley
and freshman Jonathan Stevens|
will run in the 1.5(H). all of our
throwers will be competing — we'll
have a pretty big contingent,"
Lananna said.
One athlete who remains side
lined by injury and will not compete
is sophomore 8(H)-metcr specialist
Mark Hassell.
Hassell. who has been hampered
for most of the spring with ham
siring problems, is still not ready to
race. Hassell was a major contribu
tor lo the Cardinal's success in 19 l ) 8.
"We're still trying to get Mark
ready for the Pac-l()s," said Lanan
na. "If lie's ready, we'll run him. If
not. we'll have to apply for a hard
ship |redshirt)."
With the Pac-1() meet at Arizona
State only one week away, most of
Stanford's athletes have little time
to work out the kinks before crunch
time.
"Our objective for this meet will
be to give everybody a tuneup going
into the Pac-lOs," Lananna said.
"Hut all of our athletes who will be
competing seem poised and ready
to compete."
For one Stanford athlete, the
Pac-10 meet begins today. Stanford
decathlete Chase Wimberly will
represent the Cardinal in the multi
event section of the meet.
Stanford's resident decathlon
star, senior Josh Gleason, is too
banged up to compete, according to
Lananna. Wimberly, also a senior,
will compete against eight other
Pac-10 foes to try and gain the Car
dinal an early advantage going into
the larger Pac-10 meet.
Any points Wimberley scores
will count toward Stanford's team
total, and Wimberly only needs to
place in the top eight to nab points.
"I think Chase has a good
chance to score and help the team,"
Lananna said.
