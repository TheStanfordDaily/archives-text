Los Angeles is the land of flash
and glamour. It's an almost mythi
cal place where budding stars flock
to make it big.
In L.A., dreams come true and
stars are made.

BASEBALL
■ Today: No. 6 Stanford (3S-12.17-4
Pacific 10 Conference) ;it UCLA
(29-21. 12-9), p.m., Jackie Robin
son Stadium.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford at UCLA. I
p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford at UCLA, 1
p.m.

What better place is there then
for sixth-ranked Stanford to notch
its name in the record books as the
first champion of the revamped Pa
cific 10 Con fere n ce ?
UCLA, the Cardinal's oppo
nent in the three-game conference
series, will not simply roll over for
Stanford (38-12, 17-4 Pac-10)
though. The Bruins also want to
write a Hollywood ending to their
comeback season.
After falling to 15-22 following
an eight-game losing streak, the
Bruins (29-27, 12-9 Pac-10) have
stormed back into the playoff race.
A good showing against Stanford
winning at least two of three

games — could propel UCLA into
the postseason.
"As I've said every week this
season, every weekend is impor
tant," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "Of course, this
weekend has added importance be
cause it's the final [Pac-10 series],
and we have a chance to win the
conference.
"Also, it could have an effect on
hosting regionals, on [postseason]
seeding and on who in the Pac-10
gets in the postseason."
Though Marquess said he thinks
the conference should have six
teams selected for the 64-team
NCAA playoffs, there is no guar
antee even five will receive post
season berths. Depending on the
outcome of Washington's series
with USC and Arizona's interstate
tussle with Arizona State, the num
ber and seeding of Pac-10 teams
could vary widely.
However, Stanford is really only
concerned with itself.
If the Cardinal, which holds a
two-game lead over USC in the
conference race, wins one game
this weekend, it is guaranteed at
least a share of the Pac-10 champi
onship. If the team wins two games,
the title — and the attendant
watches and banners — will come
to Palo Alto outright.
Stanford could also finish in first
place without even taking a game
from the surging Bruins at Jackie

Robinson Stadium. If Washington,
also scrambling to make an impres
sion on the NCAA selection com
mittee, manages to beat USC once,
the worst Stanford can do is tie.
Two Husky wins guarantees a Car
dinal championship.
In this type of pressure-packed
situation, setting a tone in the first
game is especially important.
Stanford, starting dominant
sophomore Jason Young, has the
advantage in that department.
The right-hander, now 8-3 with
a 3.23 ERA. seems to be picking up
steam as the postseason approach
es. Young has gone the distance in
his last two starts, allowing a com
bination of three runs on 11 hits
while recording 20 strikeouts.
UCLA's normal Friday starter
is not in such fine shape. Sopho
more Jon Brandt, who was invited
to this summer's USA National
Team camp along with Young and
UCLA's Saturday starter, Josh
Karp, has had arm troubles that
have kept him from making his
usual starts recently.
Though he threw a few quality
innings in a nonconference game
against San Diego Tuesday, Brandt
(7-3. 4.27 ERA) is not expected to
start tonight. Instead, Marquess
believes that if he throws at all,
Brandt will go Sunday against
Stanford freshman Brian Sager.
Taking Brandt's place tonight
will probably be normal Sunday
starter Ryan Carter.
Carter, though, is not Brandt's
equal. The six-foot-seven sopho
more left-hander is only 1-7 with a
7.58 ERA.
If Stanford cannot manage to
take advantage of this mismatch,
though. Marquess will not be
scared to call in the relief.
Freshman Mike Wodnicki and
senior Tony Cogan. who will prob
ably be two of the first called out of
the bullpen, have both turned in
quality performances lately.
Wodnicki started Tuesday's
nonconference game with Santa
Clara and went a solid three in
nings. allowing no runs on three
hits.
Cogan, the Cardinal's bullpen
leader and most trusted closer.

ended the 12-5 Stanford win in
style. Looking as dominant as he
has all season, the left-hander
struck out four and gave up no hits
in working the final two scoreless
innings.
"Cogan pitched fantastic his last
time out." Marquess said. "The
bullpen's been inconsistent — it
was hot, then it tailed off, then it's
come on of late — but it's been a
real plus for us lately."
UCLA, too, has been inconsis
tent.
The Bruins, who are always tal
ented, are historically known as an
underachieving club. The begin
ning of this year was no exception.
However, with their recent Pac-10
surge, they have become "the
hottest team in the conference,"
according to Marquess.
Whether they will be hot
enough this weekend to slow down
Stanford, looking for the Pac-10
title on a season-high 11 -game win
ning streak, is a different question.
