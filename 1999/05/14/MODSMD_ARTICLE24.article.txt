ter preparation before this week
end's NCAA Regional Champi
onships. The Cardinal won the Pa
cific 10 Conference Champi
onships after posting a perfect 8-0
record in league play.
In addition, at the end of April,
the Cardinal captured three indi
vidual titles at the Pac-10 Champi
onships at Ojai.
Freshman Marissa Irvin,
ranked third in the nation, plowed
through the field it) garner the sin
gles title. She then teamed with ju

the semifinals of the singles com

crown.

Stadium.

"Things couldn't have gone
much better in Ojai." said head
coach Frank Brennan. "In gener
al, the team is doing very, very
well."
Unfortunately, a few members
of the Cardinal's squad are now
complaining of injuries. Ashley's
sore wrist is the most worrisome,
but Irvin and freshmen Gabby
Lastra and Lauren Kalvaria have
minor problems as well.
"None of these injuries should
prevent the girls from playing,"
Brennan said. "It's just typical
end-of-the-season stuff. I think
they'll be able to play through the
pain."
The women should have a busy
weekend ahead of them. This is
the first year that 64 teams com
pete in the NCAA women's field.
Previously, eight of the 16 champi
onship participants were automat
ic selections, while the remainder
played through regional competi
tions.
Tomorrow at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium, No. 54 Oregon
(11-11) will take on No. 34 South
Florida (16-8) at 9 a.m. The win
ner of that duel will play the win
ner of Saturday's late-afternoon
match. No. 2 Stanford (23-2) vs.
No. 68 Pacific (16-8), on Sunday at
1 p.m.

nal squad start regional NCAA competition at home.
The Cardinal overwhelmed Pa
cific in the teams' sole encounter
this season. 9-(l .
"We've beaten Pacific easily he
fore," Brennan said, "and frankly,
these teams aren't Pac-10 caliber.
But we have to be ready because
these teams won their conference
championships and they're going to
be excited."
Irvin agreed.
"1 think if these were just normal
dual matches in the season, we
wouldn't get as pumped for them as
we would if we were playing USC or
IJCL.A," she said. "But we're defi
nitely not going to take them lightly.
This is do or die. Every match is a big
match."
After a brief midseason slump,
Irvin is again playing some of her
best tennis. Her overall record for
the year is an impressive 3cS-6, and
many onlookers believe she will
capture the NCAA singles title.
"I've been hitting the ball well,"
she said. "Sure, the NCAAs is the
goal, but right now, I'm focused on
the team competitions."
Ashley also hopes to challenge
for the NCAA singles title. Before
that, however, she too must com
pete for the team. Also, she must
make sure her wrist injury doesn't
worsen and keep her off the court.
"Everyone's excited for the
tournament." Irvin said. "Everyone
is pretty healthy, for the most part."
