The Stanford women's tennis
team couldn't have asked for bet
ter preparation before this week
end's NCAA Regional Champi
onships. The Cardinal won the Pa
cific 10 Conference Champi
onships after posting a perfect 8-0
record in league play.
In addition, at the end of April,
the Cardinal captured three indi
vidual titles at the Pac-10 Champi
onships at Ojai.
Freshman Marissa Irvin,
ranked third in the nation, plowed

the semifinals of the singles com

■ Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford (23-
2) vs. Pacific (16-8). Taube Tennis
Stadium.

"Things couldn't have gone
much better in Ojai." said head
coach Frank Brennan. "In gener
al, the team is doing very, very
well."
Unfortunately, a few members
of the Cardinal's squad are now
complaining of injuries. Ashley's
sore wrist is the most worrisome,
but Irvin and freshmen Gabby
Lastra and Lauren Kalvaria have
minor problems as well.
"None of these injuries should
prevent the girls from playing,"
Brennan said. "It's just typical
end-of-the-season stuff. I think
they'll be able to play through the
pain."
The women should have a busy
weekend ahead of them. This is
the first year that 64 teams com
pete in the NCAA women's field.
Previously, eight of the 16 champi
onship participants were automat
ic selections, while the remainder
played through regional competi
tions.
