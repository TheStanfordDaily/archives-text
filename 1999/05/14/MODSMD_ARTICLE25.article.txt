# Schneider and Stanford: A winning combination
## 
### Gabby Duno Staff writer 
It is amazing when one player can help
to successfully develop a sports program in
just four short years. The important im
pact of players on a growing team like the
Stanford softball team doesn't just come
from record-breaking numbers or clutch
plays. It takes players with the desire to
win and the desire to lead the team in a
positive direction.
Senior Michelle Schneider, Stanford's
starting shortstop for the last four years, is
one such player.
With her leadership and athleticism,
Schneider has earned the title of captain
the last two years and a spot in the Stan
ford softball record books. Her teammates
realize her important role on the team.
"She is one of the most solid defensive
players I have ever seen, and offensively
she's really been playing really great." said
junior catcher Kelli Wiginton.
Even so, Schneider is quick to return
the favor. She credits her teammates, es
pecially her fellow seniors, for helping to
make this team a national competitor.
"We have so many seniors graduating
this year," Schneider said. "Everything
we've done here has been a lirst."
The native of Los Alamitos had her first
softball experience playing t hall at the age
of six. Soccer, gymnastics and dance were
all a part of Schneider's childhood, but it
was softball that won her over.
"I used to wait for my dad to come
home everyday so we could go out and
practice," she said.
Hours practicing in the backyard
turned into hours practicing on real fields.
As she got older, Schneider played on two
very successful traveling softball squads,
including the Southern ( alifornia ()utlaws
with fellow Cardinal teammate Marcy
Crouch.
In high school, Schneider lettered in
soccer, tennis and softball. Her senior

year, she led her team in fielding percent
age, was named l irst team AII-ClFand was
named Los Alamitos Athlete of the Year.
I n her sophomore year, Schneider serious
ly began to consider playing softball at the
college level. Her junior year, she quit soc
cer and made the decision to focus on soft
ball.
Still, it was not just athletics that drove
Schneider to come to Stanford.
"(ioing to Stanford had always been a
goal of mine academically," Schneider
said. "When the program turned varsity, it
was like a dream come true. It had always
been my top choice — I couldn't believe it
was working out so perfectly."
Four years later. Stanford is feeling the
same way.
"Michelle is a definite leader," said
head coach John Rittman. "She works
hard and is consistent on the offense and
the defense."
In four years on l he Farm, Schneider
has started all 223 games the ( ardinal has
played a school record. She is Stan
ford's career leader in hits, doubles,
triples, runs scored and fielding assists. In
her senior season. Schneider is currently
tied for second in doubles (10) and is third
in both baiting (.309) and runs scored
(34.)
('learly. Schneider's performances over
the years have been a huge part of Stan
lord's success. Hul there are two outstand
ing characteristics that set Schneider
apart: her ability to come up big and her
desire to be a leader.
In the last two weekends, Schneider has
come through in the clutch. Against Ari
zona May 2, Schneider went 3 for 3 and
drove home the winning run to give the
C 'ardinal the I 0 victory the team's first
victory over Arizona in the program's his
tory.
Mut what the shortstop is most proud of
is how far her team has come since her
freshman year. When Schneider entered
Stanford, the Cardinal was in its second

year as a varsity sport. The team was not
fully funded and didn't even have a proper
field to practice on. For Schneider, it was a
hard adjustment. After playing with two
very successful traveling teams, wins were
harder to come by.
"The first year was a little frustrating,"
she said. "I chose Stanford for the acade
mics, and I didn't realize how much it
would affect me."
Despite that. Stanford gave Schneider
an opportunity she would not have had at
another school.
"I have had the chance to build this pro
gram." she said. "Now. I don't take any
thing for granted. We've seen this program
grow from nothing to a top 10-15 team."
This year, Stanford's success has been
overshadowed by the strength of the Pacif
ic 10 Conference. For most of the season,
all eight Pac-10 teams have been ranked in
the top 20. Not surprisingly, conference
games have been tough. But while this can
be frustrating, Schneider says the high
Pac-10 level of play is one of her favorite
things about softball.
"This year | the Pac-10] has been unbe
lievable." Schneider said. "The competi
tion is so high that every game is a big
game. It's always intense and exiting."
1 ler teammates have thrived on Schnei
der's positive attitude.
"Michelle is always the spirit of our
team — always trying to pump us up," said
fellow senior Becky Blevins.
With her last season winding down,
Schneider is grateful lor her experiences
with the Cardinal. In the fall, she will be
working in San Francisco, doing health
care consulting. Eventually, she hopes to
get a masters in Public Health and Busi
ness. With her career mapped out, Schnei
der is unsure what role softball will play in
her future.
"Coaching is definitely something I
want to do when I have kids," she said.
