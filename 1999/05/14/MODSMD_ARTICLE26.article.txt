### Jake Willens Staff writer 
The No. 5 men's tennis team (IS
-2) opens NCAA tournament play
today at 2 p.m. when it takes on Big
Sky Conference Champion Sacra
mento State at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
If the Cardinal wins today, it will
play again tomorrow at 1 p.m.
against the winner of today's Boise
State-Georgia Tech matchup.
The Cardinal has been waiting
for this moment all season long, as it
knows it now controls its own des
tiny and is only two matches away
from advancing to Athens, Ga.,
with 15 other schools from around
the nation.
"We know there are no easy
matches in the NCAAs," said head
coach Dick Gould. "Sac. State (15-
4) has a good record, they won their
conference and you can bet they'll
be fired up to play us. We just have
to come ready to play and play our
kind of tennis."
The Cardinal has had a solid few
weeks of practice since its last tour
nament in Ojai, and it is healthy
and ready for the challenge ahead.
The team has worked exceptionally
hard on its doubles play — an area
that has been its Achilles heel all
season long. Both the players and
coaches believe they are where they
need to be heading into the tourna
ment.

"We have really worked hard on
our doubles the last couple of
weeks," said senior Ryan Wolters.
"1 think we are a lot more confident
in that area and that could be a huge
plus for us. If our doubles can be a
positive force and we can win the
doubles point in important matches,
it will take a lot of pressure off the
singles and make us that much
tougher to beat."
The Cardinal hopes to establish
its doubles game as a force today
against the I lornets, and if it should
win. tomorrow's against Boise Stale
(15-11) or Georgia Tech (15-7).

MEW'S TENNIS
■ TodaytNo. 5 Stanford (18-2) vs.
Sacramento State (15-4). 2 p.m.,
Taube Tennis Stadium.

The No. 32 Yellow Jackets are
led by Atlantic Coast C onference
Coach of the Year Kenny Thome
and ACC Player of the Year Ben
jamin Cassaigne. Cassaignc is a ju
nior from Paris and lias a 17-3 dual
match record in the Jackets' No. 1
singles spot. He is the 30th-ranked
singles player in the nation and
could pose a threat to Wolters. In
addition, senior Matt Co/ad has a
13-6 dual match record in the Jack
ets' No. 2 spot and h;is been ranked
in the nation's top 30.
The Boise State Broncos won the
Big West Conference and have im
pressive wins over tournament

teams Harvard and New Mexico
State. In addition, the Broncos had
a close 4-3 loss to a tough Clemson
team. Boise State is led by junior
Leif Meineke, a feisty left-hander
from Frankfurt, Germany.
Clearly, either team will be any
thing but a walkover for the Cardi
nal/
"We know we can't take anyone
in our regional for granted." said
sophomore Scotty Scott.
"Every year there are no easy
matches. But we've had a good few
weeks of practice, our legs are fresh,
our attitude is positive, and we are
ready for any challenge ahead. I
think the coaches have done a great
job of getting us mentally and phys
ically prepared for the tournament,
now it is just time to go out and do
our job."
The team believes it has been a
little underrated all season long in
terms of national rankings and it
hopes to use that as extra motiva
tion during the tournament.
"Yes. it has been a little frustrat
ing with the rankings," said fresh
man K.J. 1 lippensteel.
"But when it comes down to it,
no one remembers who was seeded
what coming into the tournament.
You throw rankings out the window
and come ready to play your game
every day. If we all do that and we
all play aggressive Cardinal tennis
there is no one out there we can't
beat."
