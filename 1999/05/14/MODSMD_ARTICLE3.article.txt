### Alice Brown Staff writer 
As part of a visit to Stanford in order to learn more
about its numerous public service opportunities, former
U.S. Sen. John Glenn spoke yesterday at the History Cor
ner to a group of about 50 students about the importance
of being involved in the community.
Glenn plans to take what he learns at Stanford back to
the John Glenn Institute at Ohio State University, an in
stitute that will attempt to excite students about public ser
vice and encourage them to become more involved in pol
itics and government.
After being introduced by Stanford in Government
chair Elizabeth Pianca. Glenn opened the discussion by
saying, "I think there is a hazard for the future of our coun
try. ... I'm worried that too many of our young people
aren't interested in government and public service."
He spoke about the immense importance of public ser
vice and elected officials, calling them "the personnel sys
tem for implementing our Constitution."
In support of public service, Glenn said. "It is one thing

to study something, but it is another tiling to make it hap
pen."
At Stanford. Glenn is specifically studying the Haas
Center for Public Service. He has also toured the LBJ
School of Public Affairs at the I Jniversity of Texas and is
considering visiting the Kennedy School of Government
at Harvard University.
After giving a brief introduction of how his interest in
public service began, C llenn opened a period of questions
and answers.
He invited students to share with the group what it was
that inspired them to become involved in public service.
The resulting discussion covered issues including Stan
ford students' involvement in East Palo Alto and running
for elected office to the media's relationship to politics.
One point that Glenn made very clear was the impor
tance of not simply focusing on immediate problems and
solutions. In reference to East Palo Alto, he said, "it is the
longer-term solutions in t he way we set up policies that will
take care of these sorts of things" in the future.
