Provost Condoleezza Rice presented her third annual
report on the status of Stanford's women faculty at yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting, focusing on the signifi
cant progress the University has made in the hiring and
promotion of women faculty.
Her report, requested by the Women's Faculty Cau
cus. addressed tenure rates for men and women across the
University for assistant professors hired between 1974
and 1991. It found that during this 17 year period the Uni
versity's overall tenure rate was 40 percent, with women
receiving tenure 45 percent of the time and men receiving

tenure 38 percent
of the time.
"Overall the
most robust find
ing across the Uni-

versity is that we do not have differential tenure rates for
men and women." Rice said.
Rice said that steady progress is being made in leader
ship roles taken bv women at Stanford.
Her report noted that in 1991-92 only two department
chairs were women. Since that time the number has
grown to 13. Rice also pointed out that Kathleen Sullivan
will become dean of the Law School in September.
Rice said the hiring of new faculty is constrained by a
small turnover rate of I to 2 percent a year among those
with tenure. She said this is partly a result of the abolition
of mandators' retirement.
