Provost Condoleezza Rice presented her third annual
report on the status of Stanford's women faculty at yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting, focusing on the signifi
cant progress the University has made in the hiring and
promotion of women faculty.
Her report, requested by the Women's Faculty Cau
cus. addressed tenure rates for men and women across the
University for assistant professors hired between 1974
and 1991. It found that during this 17 year period the Uni
versity's overall tenure rate was 40 percent, with women
receiving tenure 45 percent of the time and men receiving

tenure 38 percent
of the time.
"Overall the
most robust find
ing across the Uni-

versity is that we do not have differential tenure rates for
men and women." Rice said.
Rice said that steady progress is being made in leader
ship roles taken bv women at Stanford.
Her report noted that in 1991-92 only two department
chairs were women. Since that time the number has
grown to 13. Rice also pointed out that Kathleen Sullivan
will become dean of the Law School in September.
Rice said the hiring of new faculty is constrained by a
small turnover rate of I to 2 percent a year among those
with tenure. She said this is partly a result of the abolition
of mandators' retirement.

Last year a study done by the ad
ministration found that even if 1(H)
percent of the faculty hired at current
turnover rates were women, it would
he 10 years before women constitut
ed 4K percent of the faculty and 38
percent of the tenured faculty.
Women currently constitute 19
percent of the faculty, up from 15.8
percent just five years ago. During

that time all schools have shown an
increase except the School of Educa
tion and the Law School, where the
percentage of women faculty has re
mained the same.
For the University as a whole, 26
percent of junior hires and 23 percent
of senior hires (those professors hired
with tenure) over the last five years
have been women.
"1 think Stanford should be ex
celling in hiring senior women and
minorities," English and Linguistics
Prof. Elizabeth Traugott said.

In an attempt to continue to diver
sify Stanford's faculty, the Faculty In
centive Fund was established in 1994.
The fund allows for a school to
apply to the provost for funding to
support an additional faculty position
when an outstanding woman or mi
nority candidate is identified through
a search process but does not meet
the criteria of a given search. Since its
inception 46 faculty have been hired
through the program.
"We are crucially dependent on
departments and their search com

mittees to improve faculty diversity,"
Rice said.
History Prof. Estelle Freedman
emphasized this point when she men
tioned that some departments at
Stanford have never had a woman
faculty member and that other de
partments have never promoted a
woman.
The members of the Senate also
voted unanimously to renew the de
gree-granting authority of the inter
disciplinary Program in Science,
Technology and Society.
