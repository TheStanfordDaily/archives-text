# Daily awards Jacobs scholarships
## Head photo editor, news editor win inaugural prize for freshmen 
### 
The Friends of The Stanford
Daily announced yesterday that
Josh Haner and Jennifer Stewart
are the first winners of the Julius
Jacobs Scholarship.
The scholarship, established in
memory of a former Daily editor,
honors two outstanding Daily staff
members who have worked on the
paper less than a year and carries a
cash award of $S(M).
Its goal is to aid new staff re
cruitment and provide an incentive
for staff members to become more
involved in the paper early in their
time at Stanford.
Candidates were nominated by

section editors and selected by a
five-member panel.
Haner, a freshman art major, is
one of the youngest staff members
in history to serve as the paper's
head photo editor. In nominating
him, former Daily Head Photo Ed
itor Miler Lee called Haner's con
tribution to the department "more
than I would have expected from
any staffer, let alone a freshman."
Stewart, an undeclared sopho
more, came to the paper in the fall
and quickly worked her way up the
news department ladder, becoming
a news editor in February. "She has
quickly learned all aspects of news

editing," News Editor Evan Nord
by wrote in his letter nominating
Stewart. "Despite her lack of expe
rience she has quickly grown into
her role."
Three freshman staff members
— Alice Brown, Anuj Gupta and
Jonathan Stull — were recognized
as finalists for the award.
Brown covers the ASSU and
edits the World & Nation section
once a week. Her clear writing and
upbeat attitude have made her
popular among editors and peers
alike, the selection committee said.
Gupta, a student affairs reporter
and World & Nation editor, drew

praise from the committee for his
diligence in pursuing and writing
news stories.
Stull, the only sports writer
nominated, follows the baseball
team. Committee members said he
has infused good insight and a fresh
writing style into arguably the most
grueling assignment in the section.
Julius Lloyd Jacobs died June 9,
1998, at the age of 84.
A longtime journalist and public
relations official who grew up in
San Francisco, he earned a bache
lor's degree in journalism from
Stanford and returned in 1946 for a
master's.
