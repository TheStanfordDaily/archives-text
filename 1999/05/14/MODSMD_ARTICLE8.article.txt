### Jamecca Marshall Contributing writer 
On your mark. Get set. Chili! Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity's Chili
Cookoff gets underway today, and
Stanford students are preparing for
a little taste of art.
"We are hoping people get cre
ative," said Seiji Yamamoto, a
sophomore electrical engineering
major and one of the coordinators
of the event. "Good chili is impor
tant, but it's all about having fun."
Having fun includes tasting "ice
cream" and "candy" chili made
with jelly beans instead of kidney
beans.
The cookoff. expected to draw

about 2(X) people, will consist of ap
proximately 11 teams competing for
the title of "Best Chili." The event,
taking place on the Row near White
Plaza, starts at 11 a.m. and continues
until 3 p.m. Spectators who sample
the contestants' cooking through
out the day must pay a dollar to vote
for their favorite concoction.
"People are going to be dressing
up, and I have a feeling that it is
going to get wild," Yamamoto said.
With five teams from the Stan
ford band promising special
recipes, a team from Terra planning
to dress in 1970s attire and a team
from Columbae bringing the vege
tarian chili, the event promises
something for everyone.

With a $10 entry fee, competi
tors will be trying to take home, be
sides the bragging rights, a new bar
becue grill. Although the standards
on what is actually chili are pretty
lax, patrons can breathe easy know
ing contestants do have to meet spe
cial guidelines.
"It'll be great chili," Yamamoto
said.
After a brief pause, he added,
"Well, it might suck."
Paying patrons will also be en
tered into drawings, where they can
win anything from Pez dispensers
to hundreds of dollars in gift certifi
cates. Prize winners will be an
nounced throughout the event.
"People can bribe the judges â€”

do whatever they want. Within lim
its, I mean," Yamamoto said. "It's
going to be cool."
Although sodas will be sold at
the event, the fraternity wants the
focus of the event to be on the chili.
Eric Watkins, a sophomore comput
er science major and Phi Psi mem
ber, said the fraternity loves chili.
Phi Psi hopes to have the cook
out annually and would like to see it
evolve into a charity event. Today,
for them, is just a practice run.
"We are just doing this for fun.
We just want to break even," said
Watkins.
"1 guarantee it'll be a lot of fun,"
Yamamotosaid. "If it's not, then we
won't do it again."
