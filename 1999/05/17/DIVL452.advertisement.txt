Like the 1906 earthquake, serious illness or injury without health insurance can be a disaster.
Seen a hospital bill lately?
Health care is expensive,
especially if you're not insured.
Imagine being hit with a serious
injury or illness, and then with
an overwhelming debt on top of
it. Choosing to be uninsured
puts you at serious personal
financial risk — one that could
interrupt or end your studies.
That's why Stanford requires
health coverage for students as
a part of enrollment.
A good health insurance pro
gram is a personal safety net.
It's important to understand
how it works, because the
money you pay the insurance
company (the premiums) is
yours. Costs and premium
prices are soaring again (they do
so periodically) so you may as
well learn to be a savvy health
care consumer. The task will
inevitably be yours as head of a
household, an executive in a
firm, as you run your own com
pany, or as a community leader.
Sharing Risk
Health insurance works like
your neighborhood firehouse —
everyone shares the cost. It's
expensive to maintain a fire
house that can respond to
emergency calls. Although a fire
can strike anyone in the
community, each person's risk
of one is small. If everyone pays
a share of the costs and calls the
firehouse only when they really
need to, the risk is shared
among the residents of the
neighborhood, and fire protec
tion is affordable.
Keeping Rates Low
Stanford's Cardinal Care
insurance program illustrates
some points about keeping costs
low. Cardinal Care has an
advantage as a large, stable
group, because the costs of
expensive hospitalizations are
distributed among many people.
Also, insurance premiums are
lower when everyone must be
insured, since the risks are
shared by all. And your dollars
buy more health care because
the insurance company has
negotiated low prices with the
best health care providers.
Premiums are lower for services
that are used by only a fraction
of the enrollees in a given time
period, such as for hospital
ization, surgery, emergency
care, outpatient treatment, lab,
and x-ray. Premiums are higher
for services that are used

regularly by many enrollees,
such as for dental care, eye
glasses and contact lenses. In
this case there are too few non
users to share the risk, so you're
better off buying the service
directly from the practitioner.
Higher costs also come from
the unnecessary use of brand
name drugs — they are increas
ingly expensive, especially
when they are marketed direct
ly to the public. That practice
increases demand, and you
pay the marketing costs, too.
