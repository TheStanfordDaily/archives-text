rule known as the "100-percent
rule" nearly caused Dean of Stu
dents Marc VVais to remove Delta
Kappa Epsilon from its house in
recent weeks.
The 100-percent rule mandates
that all housed Greek organiza
tions "have sufficient membership
at the conclusion of Spring Rush to
fill the house to 100 percent of its
rated occupancy for the following
year." according to the official
(ireek housing criteria.
University administrators as
sert that the 100-percent rule is
necessary given the current hous
ing crunch, but Greek leaders, cit
ing pressures on Rush and ques
tions about University motives,
say that the rule has significant
drawbacks.
