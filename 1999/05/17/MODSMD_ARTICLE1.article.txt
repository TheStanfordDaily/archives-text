rule known as the "100-percent
rule" nearly caused Dean of Stu
dents Marc VVais to remove Delta
Kappa Epsilon from its house in
recent weeks.
The 100-percent rule mandates
that all housed Greek organiza
tions "have sufficient membership
at the conclusion of Spring Rush to
fill the house to 100 percent of its
rated occupancy for the following
year." according to the official
(ireek housing criteria.
University administrators as
sert that the 100-percent rule is
necessary given the current hous
ing crunch, but Greek leaders, cit
ing pressures on Rush and ques
tions about University motives,
say that the rule has significant
drawbacks.
Prospects for future policy changes
Some Greek student officials ex
pressed hopes that the University's
housing criteria will he reviewed and
amended further in the future to bet
ter serve the needs of the housed
chapters.
"I'd like to see administrators and
students sit down and talk about
some alternatives," said Intersorority
Council President Stephanie Blos
som, a junior.
Interfraternity Council President
I'im Fisher, a junior, said he is formu
lating a specific plan that he hopes
would improve the 1 (K)-percent poli
cy.
"I do anticipate approaching ad
ministration with a plan next year....
I would look forward to a construc
tive dialogue," he said.
Fisher said his plan would be "not
necessarily strictly numbers-based"
and would involve a greater degree of
"give-and-take" on the part of ad
ministration.
I or example, he said, the rule
could be amended to a 95-percent oc
cupancy requirement averaged over
three quarters, which would allow for
fluctuations in occupancy levels due
to students studying overseas.
However Fisher said he does be
lieve that, in general, administrators
have displayed leniency in their poli
cies toward (ireek housing.
" They've shown overall support
for successful (ireek housing in that
it's not a one-strike-and-you're-out
deal." he said.
Rule addresses housing crunch
According to Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe, the 1 (X)-per
cent rule, which became effective this
academic year, is absolutely neces
sary for the University to be able to
guarantee lour years of housing to all
undergraduate students.
"Every single spot in a I Jniversity
house has to be filled to meet the
four-vcar guarantee, and that's the

overarching principle that the [ 1(K)-
percent] policy is orchestrated
around," Howe said.
Jane Camarillo, director of resi
dential education, said the rule has
been effective in filling vacancies that
existed in fraternity houses. It has
provided spaces for 30 to 50 addition
al undergraduates under the four
year housing guarantee, according to
Camarillo.
"Our demand for undergraduate
on-campus housing and the four-year
undergraduate housing guarantee no
longer allowed us the luxury to leave
rooms vacant," Camarillo said.
Assoc. Dir. of Residential Educa
tion Ann Porteus agreed that the 1(H)-
percent rule has proven successful in
its first year.
"I believe that every house has in
deed been filled to KM) percent capac
ity this year," she said.
Some students have claimed that
the rule is unnecessary, because most
fraternities had always filled their va
cancies with student boarders, thus
filling most houses to their capacity.
( amarillo disputed this claim, say
ing that under the old rule, some fra
ternities had taken advantage of their
vacant space.
"It is not accurate to say that most
of the fraternities had student board
ers in their vacancies," she said.
"Over the last three years, a number
of housed fraternities converted dou
ble rooms to singles for seniors or
maintained a common area room
rather than use it for student occu
pancy."
The University had allowed these
practices "as long as they were within
90 percent occupancy and paid the
full amount for rent." Camarillo said.
(.reeks face Kusli pressures
The KM) percent policy heightens
the importance of the spring Rush
process for (ireek groups, as housed
fraternities and sororities must make
every effort to ensure that they have
secured a sufficiently large pledge
class to fill their houses.
I here is some disagreement, how
ever, as to whether the rules place ex
cessive pressure or unreasonable de

mands on Greeks during Rush.
I he rule "makes it very difficult
for the fraternities. The way they re
cruit, it's a big challenge for them
It definitely puts a strain on the frats,"
Fisher said.
"Frats generally shoot for about
l(X)percent,but [with the rule] you've
got to have a much greater degree of
certainty that you will hit 100 percent.
... That's what is stressful," Fisher
added.
Administration officials disagree
with Fisher's assessment.
"I don't think it places any more
pressure than there ever has been,"
Howe said. " The goal of a Greek or
ganization is to continue on and have
a future. There's always a goal to per
petuate itself That pressure is al
ways there."
"For a chapter that's struggling
with membership, there's going to be
pressure no matter what policy you
have," she added.
According to sorority leaders, the
100-percent rule further complicates
a Rush system that is already very
challenging for housed sororities.
Women who enter spring Rush
are required to meet all sororities, re
gardless of a desire to rush only cer
tain ones.
"Because women come in forced
to rush all five sororities, we don't
know if the girls are interested in us as
a housed sorority, or if it's... because
they have to rush all five," said junior
Ali McGowen, Delta Delta Delta
president.
Due to their inability to gauge in
terest. housed sororities are placed in
a situation of uncertainty. It's difficult
to know whether they will have
enough pledges to fill their house.
"If we had the option of having
them come to just us, obviously we
would know for sure," McGowen
said.
'More chances of getting thrown off
campus'
Students have expressed conflict
ing opinions as to whether or not they
buy the administration's justification
for the existence of such strict rules.
Some believe the rules reveal the

administration 's desire to ultimately
reduce the number of housed Greek
groups.
Taxi President Nik Charov, a ju
nior, said the rule does illustrate the
administration's desire to get rid of
some fraternities.
"It's a measure of weeding out fra
ternities that are either in trouble or
in a slump ... so that only the very
strongest frats stay on campus,"
Charov said.
Senior Melissa Chud, who just
completed a year as ISC president,
disagreed. "I don't think it's inten
tionally being done to reduce the
number of housed groups on cam
pus," she said. Administrators "are
not being antagonistic towards us."
Fisher concurred. "What the Uni
versity has in mind with this policy re
gards simply the housing crunch that
they're facing. It's something to help
alleviate the housing crunch rather
than something to burden fraterni
ties," he said.
However a fraternity member
who wished to remain anonymous
held a very different view, expressing
harsh words for administrators.
"I think |the rules] are a way to
make the frats do more paperwork,
so they will have more chances of get
ting thrown off campus," the student
said.
"I think Jane Camarillo wants
more housing available at her dispos
al and no one else's," he added.
In response to such allegations,
Camarillo pointed to the fact that the
Greek housing criteria were devel
oped in a cooperative effort of ad
ministrators and Greek students.
"Students will have suspicions of
'university administrators' regardless
of our joint staff and student efforts,"
Camarillo said.
"The proof is in the criteria that
was developed in collaboration with
students in Greek organizations and
prescribes on-going communication,
collaboration and support," she con
cluded.
100-percent policy has twofold goal
Howe explained that the 100-per
cent rule has two parts — a sufficient

membership element and a sufficient
occupancy element.
First a fraternity or sorority must
have at least as many members as
there are spots in the group's house.
In fact a Greek group, as of this
year, can admit additional members
above the number of spots in the
house, as new rules provide stipula
tions allowing for extra members to
be released into the Draw.
Camarillo pointed to this change
as a major benefit of the new rules.
"With the change in allowing mem
bers to live in draw-filled housing
without depledging. the pressure of
the Rush could be relieved," she said.
Second, each housed fraternity or
sorority is expected to maintain 1(K)
percent occupancy of the spaces in its
house.
Under this rule a Greek group is
allowed to admit non-member
boarders into its house when some
members, either studying overseas or
serving as residence staff elsewhere
on campus, leave house spots open.
Howe said the University policy
has a twofold aim.
"The purpose is, I think, two
things: to ensure that the University
can meet its housing guarantee to all
eligible undergraduate students and
to ensure that Greek houses are filled
by healthy and strong Greek chap
ters," she said.
"As far as the University goes, it's
important to have strong organiza
tions maintaining these houses, hav
ing a great atmosphere for people to
live in," Chud said.
Prior to this year, housed fraterni
ties on campus were expected to
abide bv a "90-percent" rule requir
ing a 90 percent level of occupancy by
a group in its house.
The Taxis lost their house because
of an inability to meet this 90 percent
requirement over a period of three
years.
According to administration, the
change to the 100-percent policy
stemmed from both University and
Greek student demands.
From the University's perspec
tive, a 90-percent expectation created
the possibility that the remaining 10

percent of spots in Greek houses
could go unused, spaces that could
have helped alleviate the undergrad
uate housing crunch.
Taxi, Deke situations assessed
The Taxis fell victim to a contin
ued pattern of low occupancy in their
717 Dolores house that did not meet
the old 90 percent requirement.
"I Jnfortunately in the case of Taxi,
the chapter was not meeting the old
rule. They are indeed a strong frater
nal organization in leadership, com
munity service and spirit, but mem
bership numbers were never large,"
Camarillo said.
Meanwhile, with the Deke situa
tion this year, the administration ini
tially intended to remove the group
from their 592 Mayfield house, be
cause it did not believe Deke was in
compliance with the 100-percent rule.
However, upon receiving new in
formation regarding the Dekes'
membership numbers, Wais an
nounced his decision last Friday to
allow the fraternity to remain in its
house.
Howe said both situations under
scored the need for University policy
regarding occupancy numbers.
"I think they are examples of how
groups that are struggling with mem
bership need to be responsible and
accountable for filling their houses,"
she said.
Some students in Greek groups
have expressed concern that, in light
of the Taxi and Deke situations, it will
become an annual trend for a housed
group to be in danger of losing its
house due to administration rules.
Fisher admitted such a situation
"is a fear of mine."
" There is always the worry that
you might lose some more of these
Greeks that have a strong tradition
here as housed organizations," he
said.
However Fisher expressed confi
dence lor the future based on this
year's Rush numbers.
"On the whole, this year's Rush
was very successful, and if that's a sign
of things to come, I think we'll be
OK," he said.
