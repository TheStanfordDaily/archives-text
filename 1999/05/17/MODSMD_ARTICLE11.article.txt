# Profs, debate global warming accords

Two prominent economists de
bated possible U.S. ratification of
the Kyoto Protocol addressing glob
al greenhouse gas emissions before
70 students and faculty Friday after
noon in Building 320.
Both speakers believe the green
house gas reductions called for by
the treaty are not high enough to af
fect the environment, but they dis
puted whether or not such a policy
would be a step in the right direction.
The treaty would require the
United States to reduce carbon diox
ide emissions to 7 percent below
1990 levels by 2010. That number is
30 percent less than what the levels
would otherwise be.
Prof. Eban Goodstein of Lewis
and Clark College advocated ratifi
cation of the protocol, calling the
demanded reductions necessary
due to the exigency of the global
climate change situation. He
stressed that such reductions would
not force the U.S. economy into re
cession.
Thomas Gale Moore, a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institute, dis
agreed, arguing that climate change
is not a pressing issue and that ratifi
cation of the protocol would unnec
essarily hinder the economy.
Goodstein called global warming
the most serious challenge the world
faces today. He noted that "global

warming will have global effects, in
cluding an increase in damaging en
vironmental disasters such as hurri
canes."
In contrast, Moore, the author of
"Climate of Fear: Why We
Shouldn't Worry About Global
Warming," stated that "global
warming may be negligible" and that
it might even benefit society in terms
of agriculture, health and leisure.
Moore viewed the protocol as a
threat to the efficiency of the U.S.
economy, noting that technologies
to replace many of its current energy
sources are not adequately devel
oped to support the country's needs.
He also feared the economy would
have trouble adjusting to the new re
quirements.
"The world needs more energy,
not less," he said. "Richer is healthi
er."
Goodstein said ratification of the
protocol would "get the technologi
cal ball rolling" and thus speed the
transition toward the usage of alter
nate energy sources. He saw fuel
cells as an especially promising tech
nology, although other sources have
questioned the true feasibility of
such an option.
Additionally, Goodstein called
the protocol a difficult problem in
terms of political maneuvering, not
in technological plausibility. "Kyoto
won't solve the problem, that is
clear, but it is a critical first step."
