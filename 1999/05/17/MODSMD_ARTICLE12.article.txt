## Two candidates face off in divisive Israeli election 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Israel's
divisive campaign for prime minister
narrowed on election eve to a two
man race, pitting a beleaguered
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu against Ehud Barak, a
career military man likely to revive
peacemaking efforts with the Pales
tinians.
With the last two minor candi
dates dropping out yesterday, the
contest was to be settled in a single
ballot today. Netanyahu had hoped
to push the race into a runoff, giving
him two more weeks to campaign.
Trailing in the polls, a combative
Netanyahu nonetheless insisted: "I
think we're gonna win ... I know
we're going to win." I le lashed out at
Barak, accusing him of running a
dirty race and making underhanded
deals with enemies of Israel.
Barak, surrounded by cheering
supporters at a sunlit open-air news
conference in a Tel Aviv suburb,
promised to "lead to a better future
for Israel, to change and hope."
He denied any deals with candi
dates who dropped out. but made a
point of praising centrist Yitzhak

Mordechai, who had withdrawn
hours earlier.
Also quitting yesterday was ultra
nationalist lawmaker Ze'ev
Binyamin "Benny" Begin, the intel
lectual but stiffly uncharismatic son
of late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin. Dropping out. Begin said his
candidacy, which attracted only a
tiny following, was "nothing to apol
ogize for."
The exodus of minor candidates
began yesterday, when A/mi
Bishara. the first Arab ever to run
for Israeli prime minister, aban
doned his bid and said flat out he
hoped Netanyahu was finished.
The former philosophy professor
stopped short of endorsing Barak,
but said he believed Barak's left
leaning Labor party was committed
to improving the lot of Israel's Arab
citizens.
Netanyahu pounced on that pro
nouncement. saying it showed Barak
was in league with "anti-Zionist"
forces.
I he latest polls gave Barak a solid
lead. Pre-eminent pollster Hanoch
Smith, in a survey conducted for

today's newspapers, put Barak's lead
at S to 10 percentage points, with a
margin of error of 3 percentage
points.
Had Mordechai stayed in the
contest, it would have been almost
impossible for Barak to secure the 50
percent he needs to win. Citing a
"wave of hatred" unleashed by the
electioneering, Mordechai said his
big reason for pulling out of the con
test was to avert a runoff.
Even before today's nationwide
balloting began, the first votes had
already been cast. Soldiers in khaki
drab uniforms voted at battlefield
balloting stations in south Lebanon
on Saturday, and in the West Bank
and Gaza yesterday.
Israel's brand of democracy is
raucous but committed. Traditional
ly. the turnout runs to SO percent, at
least one-third higher than that in
the United States.
In the polling, 32 parties are vying
for 120 seats in the Knesset. Along
side Netanyahu's Likud and Barak's
Labor, there are three parties repre
senting immigrants from the former
Soviet Union.
