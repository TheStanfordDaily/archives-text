Kiiwuiti women get to vote
KUWAIT (Al>) — Kuwait's Cabinet
gave women the right to vote and run for
parliament yesterday, the state news agen
cy reported, putting the emirate even fur
ther ahead of its (iulf neighbors in moving
toward full demoeraey.
The decision, though, does not take
effect in time for parliament elections in
July.
Parliament was dissolved earlier this
month, and when a new body is formed
after July 3 elections, it has the right to

review all laws passed by Cabinet and
could reject the women's franchise.
If the decree stands, however, women
will be able to vote in the general elections
in 2003.
The Kuwaiti Cabinet's move was unex
pected.
Only a few women have spoken out for
their rights, and their efforts had been
futile.
Most women in this oil-rich state had
accepted the view that politics was a male
onlv domain.

Kuwait is the only Persian Gulf state
with an elected parliament. Qatar allows
women to vote, but for a council with only
advisory powers. Oman's consultative
council has two women members, but the
body is indirectly elected.
Impeachment indifference
MOSCOW (AP) — Dima Ivanov
always read the articles in Russian newspa
pers about President Clinton's impeach
ment saga. Yet he skipped over the news
about efforts to impeach his own president.

"It's all internal political games that
have no meaning for me," said Ivanov, 27,
a recent business school graduate. "(Boris)
Yeltsin's a sick fool, but look at the others,
the ones attacking him. They're even
worse."
Many Russians disillusioned by fre
quent government shakeups and political
upheaval shrugged off the impeachment
vote. Some felt powerless or alienated by
the petty politicking of the process. ()thers
were just too busy trying to make ends
meet.

Just a few hundred people, mostly
elderly hard-line supporters, gathered out
side Moscow's parliament building for all
three days of the debate to cheer for
Yeltsin's removal. Elsewhere, there were
no demonstrations or any sign of popular
reaction.
Even the Russian media focused more
on events in Yugoslavia in the weeks lead
ing lip to the vote than 011 Russian politics.
Yeltsin's impeachment trial received only
a bit more coverage in Russia than Clin
ton's did.
