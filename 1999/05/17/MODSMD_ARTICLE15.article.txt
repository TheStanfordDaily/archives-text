Weakness of SME Core
should not discourage
further innovations

THE IDEAS BEHIND the
Science, Math and Engineer
ing Core are excellent ones
that should be pursued by the Uni
versity. However, that does not
mean the program in its current
incarnation is right for Stanford
undergraduates.
The SME core was originally
designed to create another option
for non-science majors to complete
their Area 2 general education
requirement.
With sagging enrollment and
complaints from students and facul
ty, the heavily funded core is not ful
filling its promise to a significant
number of students.
The disappointing results ol SME,
however, should not leave Stanford
students, administrators and faculty
disenchanted with the notion of inte
grating and breaking down the barri
ers between the sciences, or the sci
ences and the humanities, for that
matter.
The line marking the divide
between techies and fuz/ies on this
campus is clearly drawn and often
seems unbreachable.
However, both types of students
could reap vast benefits from
increased interaction through pro
grams such as SME.
Instead of SME's current configu
ration as a year-long sequence, Stan
ford should try to build upon the
successes of established programs
that narrow the gap between techie
and fuzzy.
The immensely successful pro
gram in Human Biology, which

boasts some of the most popular
classes including Human Sexuality
and Sleep and Dreams, is an excel
lent model for bringing techies and
fuzzies together.
Joint programs or classes between
two or more departments that do
not traditionally associate would lit
this paradigm well.
New issues that are on the cutting
edge of scientific research at this
University often bring up questions
of morality, ethics or philosophy
traditionally the realm of fuzzies.
These topics would make excel
lent subject matter for a bevy of
interdisciplinary courses.
While some of these issues
already are being discussed in
bioethics or philosophy of science
classes, the University could greatly
benefit from having techies and
fuzzies interact in more informal
forums that approach these issues
through discussion.
The question of offering Area 2
credit as the SME core attempted to
do should be answered by broaden
ing the scope of classes that fulfill
this requirement.
The University would benefit
from awarding Area 2 credit for col
loquium-type classes and classes
with universal appeal that have a
strong scientific component, like
Human Sexuality.
We are encouraged by efforts like
those of Nobel Prize-winning
Applied Physics Prof. Steven Chu to
construct a forum with the goal of
breaking down the barriers between
scientific disciplines.
There is no reason why this move
ment should not be broadened at
Stanford to include the humanities
at every level, from professors'
research to undergraduate lecture
classes.
