Make your voice heard to save the Toy on Eating Clubs

The C apital Improvement Program
(( IP) was ereated as a one-of-a-kind effort
to renovate residential buildings and
serveries aeross campus.
It was originally a response to a need to
even out residential quality after the
returning residency priority was dropped
from the Draw, a policy that allowed
"lucky" Draw groups to dominate the good
houses.
In application. ( IP has done a wonder
ful job of creating spaces that are fairly uni
form in quality.
In doing so. however, at times the funk
and character that has defined undergradu
ate living for decades, like murals, lofts and
even tacked up posters, has fallen by the
wayside in the interests of a more uniform
set of choices for our residential University.
( IP has had and still has some really
awesome possibilities for improving the
day-to-day facilities for Stanford students,
which, if the ( IP planners are doing their
jobs, should probably be the primary (but
not sole) effort of any renovation to the stu
dent houses / dormitories and their
kitchens, right?
Well, in the past there has been con
tention about whether or not the student
voice was heard or listened to. At times the
funk and charm and history of residences
has been literally painted over.
Coming soon on the CIP agenda is the
renovation of Toyon Mall and the restruc
turing of its servery, currently the Stanford

Eating ('lubs.
In this case in particular, an opportunity
has been presented for students to voice
their opinions and perhaps save one of the
more popular traditions and eating options
the campus has ever seen.
Founded by students more than a centu
ry ago as an alternative food service, the
Stanford Eating Clubs (SEC) have been
asking the students what they want from
day one.
More recently, in an effort to examine
new facility possibilities, I have been shar
ing with I Jniversity administrators what the
students have been saying.
As part of the SEC General Manage
ment team for five years, I have based these
conclusions on years of close contact with
students, in-house surveys, student letters,
word-of-mouth. returning Eating Club
members and an alumni support outreach
program.
In response, the University has now
taken a proactive role in examining what
we've been telling them for years â€” people
really care, and they love the Eating Clubs!
We've been ready to take our proactive
part and invest money and staff time into
building a new and better facility and sys
tem for the students.
However, our hands have been tied. We
can't begin fundraising until we have a busi
ness plan, we can't begin our business plan
until we know where our facility might be
and how much it costs and therefore, we

MUST concentrate all our efforts on mak
ing sure the student voice is heard in this
crucial decision.
We can't get anywhere until that com
mittee decides the Eating Clubs are worth
while and should be given a chance to con
tinue serving Toyon and its neighbor grad
uate communities for many decades to
come.
A committee co-chaired by Keith Guy,
director of Housing and Dining Services,
and ASSU President Mike Levin is creating
a survey designed to fairly solicit the opin
ion and suggestions of the Stanford com
munity.
Whether you love or hate the Eating
Clubs, whether you've been a member or
not, if you simply care about options for
future students, or if you've been complain
ing that your voice has not been heard in
making your community better for you, this
is your chance to make a difference!
You can log in to the ASSU at
http://assu.stanford.edu/ and fill out the
Toyon / Eating Clubs Survey.
Phis time, your student voice will have
an impact.
Your voice will be heard and will help
the committee make an informed decision
for the future of Toyon and the Stanford
Eating Clubs.
The bottom line is that we need input
about the things you've loved and those
you'd like to change so that whoever serves
Toyon in the future is serving the students.

The future of (he Eating Clubs is not in
my hands any more, it is in yours.
This privilege to run ourselves indepen
dently has allowed us to create the magic of
special dinners, Friday afternoon BBQs
and a variety of other student-run functions
that make up the true lasting memories and
friendships that we all take with us.
However, I'm not qualified to propose
and design a building, finance it or hardly
to run the fundraising for it.
This isn't 1951 when the students could
do it themselves. Today there are too many
lawyers, square-footage requirements and
zoning regulations for us to do it by our
selves.
If the administration is really interested
in jumping up alumni donations, they
should be asking you and themselves what
serves the learning and living environment
best and act accordingly.
If you can convince them to preserve the
Eating Clubs, we'll do what we can to help
design something better than one of the
most popular dining options on campus.
So log in and make your voice heard.
You've been warned. I've been telling
many of you for years we'd someday ask
for help. This is it!
We all know you think better on a happy
stomach.
