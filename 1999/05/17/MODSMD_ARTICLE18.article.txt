## Wrestling with our possibilities

II 1A VE A confession to
make: I didn't want to
write this column. I
have a helluva lot of work
to do, and time's a-wastin'.
The next 4X hours will
involve around 300 pages
of reading, a cowboy West-

ern film, proofreading papers and an epic
silent film. I don't think that I'm in a much
different spot than most everyone around
me.
It's not that I don't want to kick back and
looly at our value system and brainstorm fun
things to do instead of worry. This week my
mind just doesn't have room for it. I have no
time for contemplation. I need another sort
of satisfaction, and that satisfaction involves
having my work done and being able to
breathe again. I would like to see a few peo
ple lor more than just a coffee date at the
Col lo and sit down for longer than it takes to
eat a meal at optimum speed.
And so the typical college student comes
to mourn the loss of free time ... not to
protest too much, just to acknowledge how
busy we are. As pampered as our lives here
may be, we take on much more than people
outside of our age cohort. Our days may
begin late, but we are adapted for work into
the wee hours, must absorb information at a
higher rate than the most inquisitive toddler
ever could and we have to compile, evaluate
and be decisive based on the info we crunch
and the experiences we've chalked up. It's
rough. Right?
A contradiction arises. We can sleep in

because we have no children or full-time
jobs. We can party without having to worry
about looking too stupid because everyone
kinda does. We have fluid social calendars
because we don't have to worry about
impressing a boss or stepping on anyone's
toes. We can choose what we will have to
show for our years here, transforming the
educational tabula rasa of our freshman year
into a potentially stellar transcript.
Yet we find ourselves increasingly tired
and overloaded. We look bleakly at gradua
tion because we do not know what leaving
the friendly confines of Stanford will mean.
We are told that the job market is so horrific
that we should practice waiting tables now..
Somehow, the prospect of the outside world
and our place in it removes any sense of
agency from creating a life. A friend told me
yesterday that he can't think of any profes
sion right now where he won't be unhappy at
30. Think of how far away you are from a 10-
year-old at 20 ... shouldn't 30 be as far
away? How can it already be so full of
doom?
Infecting our present life is a specter that
is all the more terrifying because it cannot be
isolated or confined. It is what turns busy
into frenetic and removes energy from our
lives. Imagined prospects for our future seem
to be enough to absolutely drench our pre
sent with doubt. It bleeds onto every aspect
of our lives. When love is unforgiving, the
time to step back and reevaluate is stolen
away by the desire to fix things now. Like
wise, the desire to take an art class or learn to
sail is eliminated by the requisite examples of

well-roundedness that a suitable transcript
needs, sacrificed in the interest of preserving
our proto-GPAs.
And so the time we have, the future we
perceive, is too precious for us to give life a
chance to unwind and do its thing. By spazz
ing so much about the inevitability of our
lives in the next 10 to 20 years, we make
heartbreak impossible to avoid. We some
how cannot let things work out apart from
the connotations, intentions and complica
tions that arise when individual interest and
personality interfere with a friend's, or per
haps the paper topic that just won't come
together. Paper prompts and problem sets
have evil personalities ail their own. and
there are certainly some instances in which
they seem to conflict with the very fiber of
your being. So this inability to smooth the
waters now transforms the future into little
more than a prospect of more of the same.
Without real-world responsibilities and
cash flow, we may not have the time or
resources to raise chickens or play tennis
every week or make furniture, but we do
have something. We can't deny the immedi
acy of life, but we have more freedom than
we realize and aren't fated to anything yet.
We just have to determine exactly what that
something is and do so without transforming
each new goal we discover or ambition we
excavate into an asset that must be utilized
with all deliberate speed to construct the
future that lays ahead of us.
