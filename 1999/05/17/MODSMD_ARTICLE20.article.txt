# Where we are
## Fighting the good fight in Kosovo 
### 
David Stein

I DON'T KNOW what ethnicity means to
you, but I do know what it means to the
2(X) people who protested last week the
accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade. For them, ethnicity means more
than a human life.
My definition doesn't seem to be an exag
geration. After all, their cries of "Stop the
bombing!" did not come after thousands of
Kosovars were killed or driven away from
their homeland, starting some two months
ago. They did not come after dozens of civil
ian Serbs lost their lives to imprecise missiles.
They did not even come after Serbia, its
power plants destroyed, was almost entirely
blacked out. They came after the deaths of
three Chinese citizens.
The loss of three lives is not to be taken
lightly, but in a war — lest we forget the con
text in which we speak — there does exist a
type of moral calculus. For under the cloak of
egalitarianism, where every human's life bal
ances another's, the greater the loss of life,
the greater the tragedy. To rally behind the
death of three, when thousands already lie in
their graves, borders on insincerity.

Indeed, the flyers ostensibly distributed
by the same protesters, even though depict
ing ghastly events, fail somehow to arouse
anything but the basest sympathy. By plas
tering photographs of the victims' bodies
around campus, like posters for a summer
movie, the demonstrators have made the two
women and one man killed in the bombing
not more human, not more deserving of our
grief but mere spectacles — gratuitous,
bloody shadows of their former selves. I
wonder how their families would feel know
ing that their loved ones have been reduced
to a series of tasteless black and white pic
tures. I wonder how many reams of paper it
would take to fiyer the campus with pictures
of the Kosovar dead.
But of course, the demonstrators didn't
really care that much for the Kosovars in the
first place. Why else would the brunt of their
peace-loving argument focus on the "acci
dent" of the bombing, on the targeting of the
Chinese embassy by the Americans as an
implicit attack on the totality of their people?
It seems strange that they would concentrate
on superpower politics when all they want is

peace in two tiny, poor countries, doesn't it?
Moreover, their contention that the NATO
bombings have increased the number of
fatalities and refugees extends the bound
aries of issue-avoiding rhetoric. No one can
even guess what would have happened had
the bombings not occurred — there might
have even been thousands more deaths with
out NAT O intervention — and to attempt to
establish the plausibility of this argument is
not only to argue an illusion but also to dis
play a certain shallowness of feeling toward
the majority of this war's victims.
Ouite simply, peace — that is, the cessa
tion of hostilities for all involved — was not
on the minds of the protesters. Quite simply,
the killing of the innocent, for them, meant
the killing of their people, their own. Let the
homes burn, let the women be raped, just
don't mess with us, because God forbid
atrocities the likes of which are rarely seen in
all of human history be stopped if our inter
ests are in any way threatened.
In fact, this sort of myopic disapproval has
flourished among protesters, and not just on
the Chinese side. When the three Arrnv sol-

diers were taken prisoner, U.S. critics of the
NA TO air war fretted over the possibility of
American casualties. Republicans, afraid of
letting a Democratic administration reap the
political benefits of a successfully fought war,
have clamored for disengagement. Even the
champions of war protests, the anti-Vietnam
veterans, have attacked the Balkan war as
another case of capitalistic hegemony. There
is only one war. but everyone has his or her
cause.
Self-interest, especially when lives and
independence hang in the balance, should
not be automatically deplored, even though
deplorable self-interest on the Serbians'
behalf has led the world to fill the Yugosla
vian sky with bombs. But when self-interest
for political, national or ethical grounds
detracts from the purpose and seriousness of
a military engagement — in this case, to halt
the extinction of a race of people — then the
call for peace becomes as suspicious as the
motives behind war.
It is convenient to doubt what spurs coun
tries to war. for the legacy of the l%()s brings
with it an all-encompassing skepticism of

national agendas. War must he the tool of the
oppressor, the reasoning goes, and thus must
be opposed with an equally powerful appeal
for peace. However, peace is not something
wished into existence but (hasn't the 20th
century taught us anything?) fought for with
the full energy of humanitarian concern.
That means fighting with aggressors, such as
the Serbs: that means invoking chaos to bring
order; that means people, however tragic,
dying.
In the case of Kosovo, war is the neces
sary means to achieve peace, albeit fragile,
because peace now would only mean suffer
ing later. So put aside your selfish concerns,
your vain liberalism that links you not with
advocates of peace but aligns you with the
Serbian perpetrators of aggression, and real
ize that there's something greater worth
fighting for — the lives of imperiled
strangers.
If we can't realize this, then there's really
nothing left for us to do.

David Stein would like to congratulate Gab)
on her graduation and her new life.
