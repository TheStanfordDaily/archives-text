### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team (25-2) marched
into the third round of the NCAA Championships this
weekend after dominating both Pacific (16-9) and Ore
gon (12-12), both 5-0.
I he women head to Gainesville. Fla., today to begin
preparing for the final rounds of the team tournament.
Despite the one-sided score, Saturday's match
against Pacific was a sloppy one.
"I think we played well enough, but the fact that we
haven't played a match in a while definitely showed."
said assistant coach Lele Forood. "But for most of the
players, the second sets were solid."

Freshmen Marissa Irvin. Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko
Tokuda were the first off the court, wrapping up their
matches in less than an hour.
Irvin, ranked third in the nation, carved out a solid 6-
1,6-2 triumph over Pacific's Susanne Bertel at the No. I
singles spot, while Kalvaria painted the lines with her
powerful forehand through a 6-3. 6-0 pounding of Pa
cific's Marcela Sanchez at the No. 3 singles position.
"I started off a little bit nervous," said Kalvaria, who
insisted that her recent shinsplint troubles weren't a fac
tor during the match. "We haven't played a dual match
in a while, but I did what I had to do. As big as this is,
you just have to focus on yourself and concentrate on
your match."
Tokuda crushed Pacific's Kendra Lamb at the No. 6
singles position, 6-1, 6-1. After a frustrating illness that
had kept her away from tennis until recently, Tokuda is
now healthy. She's worried, however, aboul her team
mates. many of whom are currently complaining of
minor injuries.
"I'm getting much better." she said. "But last week,
we were all in the training room bonding."
Seventh-ranked junior Tervn Ashley was visibly
bothered by a sore wrist throughout her No. 2 singles
match on Saturday. Her opponent. Pacific's Dina Da
jani, annoyed Ashley with a variety of spins and off
pace shots, forcing Ashley to over-hit.
Ashley pounced all over Dajani's weak serve, but
her powerful returns often sailed long.
The first set was close as an out-of-sorts Ashley teed
off on several shots, occasionally finding the corners but
often missing wildly. Ashley woke up. however, for the
second set, often charging the net and nailing accurate
volleys into the open court.
"It was definitely an ugly, messy match," she said
after her 6-4. 6-2 win. "But I'm not going to dwell on it
because I've only practiced a little in the past two weeks.
