### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team (25-2) marched
into the third round of the NCAA Championships this
weekend after dominating both Pacific (16-9) and Ore
gon (12-12), both 5-0.
I he women head to Gainesville. Fla., today to begin
preparing for the final rounds of the team tournament.
Despite the one-sided score, Saturday's match
against Pacific was a sloppy one.
"I think we played well enough, but the fact that we
haven't played a match in a while definitely showed."
said assistant coach Lele Forood. "But for most of the
players, the second sets were solid."

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Sunday: No. 2 Stanford (25-2) 5, Oregon (12-12)0

■ Saturday: Stanford 5. Pacific (16-9) 0

Freshmen Marissa Irvin. Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko
Tokuda were the first off the court, wrapping up their
matches in less than an hour.
Irvin, ranked third in the nation, carved out a solid 6-
1,6-2 triumph over Pacific's Susanne Bertel at the No. I
singles spot, while Kalvaria painted the lines with her
powerful forehand through a 6-3. 6-0 pounding of Pa
cific's Marcela Sanchez at the No. 3 singles position.
"I started off a little bit nervous," said Kalvaria, who
insisted that her recent shinsplint troubles weren't a fac
tor during the match. "We haven't played a dual match
in a while, but I did what I had to do. As big as this is,
you just have to focus on yourself and concentrate on
your match."
Tokuda crushed Pacific's Kendra Lamb at the No. 6
singles position, 6-1, 6-1. After a frustrating illness that
had kept her away from tennis until recently, Tokuda is
now healthy. She's worried, however, aboul her team
mates. many of whom are currently complaining of
minor injuries.
"I'm getting much better." she said. "But last week,
we were all in the training room bonding."
Seventh-ranked junior Tervn Ashley was visibly
bothered by a sore wrist throughout her No. 2 singles
match on Saturday. Her opponent. Pacific's Dina Da
jani, annoyed Ashley with a variety of spins and off
pace shots, forcing Ashley to over-hit.
Ashley pounced all over Dajani's weak serve, but
her powerful returns often sailed long.
The first set was close as an out-of-sorts Ashley teed
off on several shots, occasionally finding the corners but
often missing wildly. Ashley woke up. however, for the
second set, often charging the net and nailing accurate
volleys into the open court.
"It was definitely an ugly, messy match," she said
after her 6-4. 6-2 win. "But I'm not going to dwell on it
because I've only practiced a little in the past two weeks.


Alejandro Huerta — Daily
Freshman Marissa Irvin zeroes in on another crushing backhand during her 6-4,6-2 victory against Ore
gon's Alina Wygonowska yesterday.
The wrist's pretty sore but it's noth
ing 1 can't play through."
Another intriguing encounter
took place at the No. 5 singles posi
tion, as junior Jennifer Hciser ral
lied from a 2-5 deficit in the second
set to post a 6-1,7-5 win over Diana
D'Audney.
Heiser was irritated by D'Aud
ney's drop shots throughout the
match but seemed inspired after a
talk with assistant coach Frankie
Brennan at 2-5.
"I was ready for the match,"
Heiser said. "I just got a little impa
tient. 1 didn't think 1 should've been
down 2-5 in the first place, so 1 just
focused and put more balls in play."
The afternoon's most compelling
match, featuring freshman Gabby
Lastra against Pacific's Christiane
Barthel, was abandoned after the
Cardinal clinched the victory with
five wins.
Barthel was playing consistent
and inspired tennis, often whipping
passing shots past a flustered Lastra
and leaping to a 6-1 first-set win.
Lastra recovered, however, to take
the second set, 6-3. While this match
had spectators on the edges of their
seats, it was halted at the beginning
of the third set because the Cardinal
had already secured victory.

Lastra also found herself in a bit
of a bind during Sunday's win over
Oregon, narrowly squeaking by 7-5
in the second set for a 6-0. 7-5 tri
umph over Adeline Arnaud at the
No. 3 singles spot.
"Gabby played much better
today than she did Saturday," said
head coach Frank Brennan.
"I don't know why she had a sec
ond-set hiccup. 1 think she just
wasn't really focusing."
Overall. Sunday's match was
much cleaner and less stressful than
the match against Pacific. Every
player took her match in straight
sets.
The most competitive contest
was between Irvin and Oregon's
Alina Wygonowska. After a close
first-set tussle, Irvin powered past
Wygonowska, 6-4,6-2.
"While Marissa was never in
danger," Frank Brennan said, "it
was a good, competitive match.
"I think we all played very well."
he said. "Yesterday was not great,
but today was much better. I was
suspecting that, because we hadn't
played a match for quite some time
before yesterday."
Frank Brennan is looking for
ward to traveling to Florida and
competing against 15 of the nation's
top teams.
The second-seeded Cardinal will
face No. 16 Tennessee (18-7) on
Thursday.
