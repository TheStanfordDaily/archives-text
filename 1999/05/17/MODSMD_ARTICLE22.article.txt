### Jake Willens Staff writer 
The No. 5 men's tennis team complet
ed its successful weekend yesterday with a
solid 4-0 victory against the Georgia Tech
Yellow Jackets (16-8) at the Taube Fami
ly Tennis Stadium. With the win and with
Friday's 4-0 victory against Sacramento
State (15-5) the Cardinal won its regional
and assured itself a spot as one of the 16
teams that will compete for the national
championship this weekend in Athens,
Ga.
It was a weekend that could not have
worked out any better for the Cardinal
(20-2), as the team now leaves on Wednes
day for Athens fully healthy and playing as

well as it has all season long. Peaking at
this time of the season almost seems to he
an annual phenomenon for head coach
Dick Gould's Cardinal teams.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Sunday: No. 5 Stanford (20-2) 4. Georgia
Tech (16-8)0.

■ Saturday: Stanford 4. Sacramento State
(15-5)0.

"This team has improved throughout
the year more than any other I have been
on," said senior leader Ryan Wolters.
"Gould and [assistant coach John
Whitlinger] seem to always find a way to
have us playing our best at this time of the

year. We had a couple of great weeks of
practice between our last tournament in
Ojai and this weekend's matches, and now
we are all tuned up and ready for Athens."
The second-seeded Cardinal showed
no sign of rustiness from its two weeks off
as it asserted its dominance Friday after
noon over Sacramento State early and
never let up. The Cardinal handily won
the doubles point with 8-3 and 8-4 wins out
of its No. 1 and No. 2 teams. It was also
ahead 6-4 in the No. 3 doubles spot, a
match that was stopped after the manda
tory two matches had been won.
The Cardinal then took that momen
tum into singles and won three straight
matches to win the match 4-0. Sacramento
State failed to win a set in the entire match.

"Friday was nice because it showed all
of our doubles work has paid off," said ju
nior Geoff Abrams. "We knew our dou
bles play would be a key coming into the
NCAAsandon both Friday and Saturday
we performed the way we know we are ca
pable of. That takes a lot of pressure off
the singles."
On Saturday the (Cardinal got off to an
equally quick start against Georgia Tech.
The Yellow Jackets were a much tougher
opponent than Sacramento State, as each
individual match was closer and harder
fought. The Yellow Jackets were missing
their No. 1 player, Benjamin Cassaigne.
