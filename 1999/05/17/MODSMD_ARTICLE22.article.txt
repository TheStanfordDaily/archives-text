### Jake Willens Staff writer 
The No. 5 men's tennis team complet
ed its successful weekend yesterday with a
solid 4-0 victory against the Georgia Tech
Yellow Jackets (16-8) at the Taube Fami
ly Tennis Stadium. With the win and with
Friday's 4-0 victory against Sacramento
State (15-5) the Cardinal won its regional
and assured itself a spot as one of the 16
teams that will compete for the national
championship this weekend in Athens,
Ga.
It was a weekend that could not have
worked out any better for the Cardinal
(20-2), as the team now leaves on Wednes
day for Athens fully healthy and playing as

well as it has all season long. Peaking at
this time of the season almost seems to he
an annual phenomenon for head coach
Dick Gould's Cardinal teams.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Sunday: No. 5 Stanford (20-2) 4. Georgia
Tech (16-8)0.

■ Saturday: Stanford 4. Sacramento State
(15-5)0.

"This team has improved throughout
the year more than any other I have been
on," said senior leader Ryan Wolters.
"Gould and [assistant coach John
Whitlinger] seem to always find a way to
have us playing our best at this time of the

year. We had a couple of great weeks of
practice between our last tournament in
Ojai and this weekend's matches, and now
we are all tuned up and ready for Athens."
The second-seeded Cardinal showed
no sign of rustiness from its two weeks off
as it asserted its dominance Friday after
noon over Sacramento State early and
never let up. The Cardinal handily won
the doubles point with 8-3 and 8-4 wins out
of its No. 1 and No. 2 teams. It was also
ahead 6-4 in the No. 3 doubles spot, a
match that was stopped after the manda
tory two matches had been won.
The Cardinal then took that momen
tum into singles and won three straight
matches to win the match 4-0. Sacramento
State failed to win a set in the entire match.

"Friday was nice because it showed all
of our doubles work has paid off," said ju
nior Geoff Abrams. "We knew our dou
bles play would be a key coming into the
NCAAsandon both Friday and Saturday
we performed the way we know we are ca
pable of. That takes a lot of pressure off
the singles."
On Saturday the (Cardinal got off to an
equally quick start against Georgia Tech.
The Yellow Jackets were a much tougher
opponent than Sacramento State, as each
individual match was closer and harder
fought. The Yellow Jackets were missing
their No. 1 player, Benjamin Cassaigne.
who was out lor the day with a migraine
headache.
Cassaigne was the Atlantic Coast
Conference player of the year and
losing him for both the doubles and
singles was a blow to Georgia Tech.
"Yes, I'm sure it hurt them not to
have Cassaigne in the lineup," C Jould
said. "Hut the bottom line was we
took advantage of it and played the
kind of tennis that really never let
them into the match. Moth days I was
happy with our doubles performance
and with the production from the
bottom of our lineup."
Moth the Cardinal's doubles and
its No. 5 and No. 6 singles spots were
question marks coming into the
N( 'A As. but judging from this week
end both seemed to have met the
challenge. At the No. 5 spot sopho
more Scotty Scott played very well
on Friday and clinched the match
with his 6-3, 6-4 win against Sacra
mento State. On Saturday he then
turned around and was the first one
off the court with his 6-3,6-1 win over
the Yellow Jackets' Sergio Aguirre.
At the No. 6 spot sophomore Ali
Ansari was the first one off the court

on Friday with an easy 6-0, 6-0 win.
I le also played well in the second set
of Saturday's match against Georgia
Tech's Tim Bibhy, a match that was
stopped at 4-6. 6-2. Both Ansari and
Scott also played strong tennis at the
No. 3 doubles spot, as they were
ahead 6-4 and 5-4 when both of their
matches were stopped.
The Cardinal knows, however,
that its matches in Athens will be
tougher than this weekend's and that
it will have to build upon the week
end's strong play.
"In Athens we just have to all stay
focused on our own individual
match." Abrams said. "We can't be
looking around at other guys' match
es waiting for them to win. We each
have to take it upon ourselves to take
responsibility for our own win."
Wolters agreed. "It was nice to get
matches in this weekend to get ready
for Athens." he said. "Now it is
crunch time and we have to be ready
to step up. I like where we are as a
team right now, we just have to take
it a match, or even a game at a time."
Whitlinger believes the team is
clicking and coming together at the
right time.
"I'm just happy to be going with a
healthy team to Athens," he said.
