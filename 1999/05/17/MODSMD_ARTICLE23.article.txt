# Series proves fitting end
## Race ends with a battle 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
UCLA, an inexperienced but talented team on the
postseason bubble, had begun the first game of what it
hoped would be a season-extending sweep of Stanford
in fine style.
The young Bruins had ridden the dominating per
formance of preseason ace Ryan Carter to a 7-1 lead
heading into the eighth inning. The 6-foot-7 sopho
more was making sixth-ranked Stanford, which need
ed a win to clinch a tie for the Pacific 10 Conference
championship, look surprisingly complacent.
Soon though, after chasing Carter from the mound,
the Cardinal was playing with the enthusiasm and
abandon of a title contender.
In the eighth, the team manufactured two runs to
inch within four of the Bruins. In the ninth, the top of
Stanford's order strung three straight singles together,
senior Josh Hochgesang nailed a bases-clearing double
down the left-field line and junior Nick Day singled to
score Hochgesang and tie the game at seven.
The series was on.
No lead was safe, no outcome certain in this volatile
three-game set between a team fighting for a title and
a team fighting for its future.
"This was intense," said Stanford junior John Gall,
who went 9-for-12 with three home runs, two doubles,
four walks and nine RBIs in the series. "They had just
as big of a reason to want this as we did. They're play
ing for their season."
At times, it seemed like both teams were playing for
their lives.
Scrapping and clawing, they each forged comebacks
out of thin air. Just when the situation was most dire,
the game became most interesting.
Friday evening Stanford had no chance. UCLA was
beating the Cardinal in every phase of the game.
But the team that Hochgesang describes as having a
"never-say-die" attitude refused to give in yet again.
"It looked pretty bleak there," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "We had one hit after seven in
nings and they hit the ball well off of Jason Young. It
didn't look too good. But, we somehow found a way to
bounce back."
UCLA head coach Gary Adams was stunned fol
lowing the game. His words came slow and, even be
hind a pair of wraparound sunglasses, one could sense
his eyes were heavy.
"That was a tough, tough loss," he said. "I just told
the team, we gotta throw this out and come back to
morrow. It was a difficult loss; we just gotta come back
tomorrow and show how tough we are."
And that they did Saturday.
That is, after looking like zombies for much of the
game.
But once the Bruins came out of their funk and re
alized they could still take two games from the Cardi
nal if they actually began playing, their bats — and
their spirits — sprang to life.
Bill Scott, who now leads the Pac-10 with 25 home
runs, destroyed a Justin Wayne offering over center
field to start the eighth inning. Then, Garrett Atkins.
UCLA's cleanup hitter, slammed another Wayne pitch
over the batting screen in deep center.
After Marquess brought Wayne out of the game,
the Bruins then proceeded to score seven runs on six
hits off of four different Cardinal relievers.
Just three outs earlier, the Bruins had looked dead
and gone. It seemed like the memories of their collapse
the night before were weighing them down. Suddenly,
though, they decided to make new memories.
"Before the game we talked about how easy it'd be
to come out Hat." Adams said. "It looked like we were
for a while, but we came through. But. it's no surprise.
We said this is the type of series that'll go till the ninth
inning of the last game."
In the end, the series was over
before the ninth inning yesterday.
Sophomore Billy Jacobson's three
run home run in the seventh and
junior Craig Thompson's grand
slam in the ninth took care of that.
But truly, until Thompson's
slam, it seemed like everyone was
expecting some kind of Bruin
comeback. They were down six,
but in such a series, a six-run come
back seemed commonplace.

Stanford coasted to a 10-run
blowout win Sunday that may have
made some fans forget what a
hard-fought, intense series had
been played.
Make no mistake, though, both
UCLA and Stanford had reasons
to win and both played like it.
All weekend long, players
jawed back and forth, runners
slammed into home plate and
fielders dove to make outlandish
catches. All series, both teams
played as if their lives and their
seasons were hanging on by a
thread. Because, in some cases,
they were.
