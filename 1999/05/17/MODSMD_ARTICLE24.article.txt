# Softball slammed by Bears in grueling Pac-10 closer
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
A day of frustrations. Home
runs crushed just foul. Bases
loaded line drives snagged in left
field.
And suffering a heartbreaking
loss to No. 17 California on a grand
slam in the bottom of the seventh
after coming from behind to tie in
the top of the inning.
Two frustrating losses is the last
thing a team would wish for heading
into the postseason. The Cardinal
will travel to NCAA Regionals in
Fresno this coming weekend in an
attempt to earn a trip to the College
World Series.
But the resilient No. 15 Stanford
softball team (40-23, 10-IS Pacific
10 Conference) refuses to dwell on
the loss and already is looking to
ward next weekend.

"I think this is going to gel us
fired up even more," said junior
catcher Kellie Wiginton. "The men
tality that we have is that we just
want to go beat whoever we play. I
think it is going to turn us around."

SOFTBALL

■ Saturday: GAME I — No. 17 Cal
ifornia (44-19. 13-14 Pacific Ten
Conference) 7. No. 15 Stanford (40-
23,10-18) 1.
GAME 2 — California 6, Stanford 3.
If the Cardinal hopes to have
postseason success, the turnaround
will need to come at the plate. Stan
ford has been plagued by stranded
base runners and not being able to
put together a run-scoring rally.
"We have to do a better job of
hitting the ball," said head coach
John Rittman. "We put the runners
in place and then we don't execute

with the big hit."
The squad, however, is com
prised of talented hitters. Stan
ford's team batting average is .286.
while its opponents are batting only
.189. Rittman believes the problem
is more mental.
"I think our kids are trying so
hard that they aren't getting in
there and trusting their instincts
and their abilities. We are being a
little bit tentative and it shows,"
Rittman said.
This phenomenon was apparent
in the 7-1 loss to Cal (44-19. 13-14)
in the first game of the twin bill.
Despite finding itself down 7-1
after the first inning of game one,
the Cardinal left 10 runners on base
and had ample opportunity to stage
a comeback.
"We left way too many runners
on," Rittman said. "Even though
the score was 7-1, we could easily

have tied that game hut didn't get a
whole lot of breaks [to] go our
way"
Stanford took a 1-0 lead on a
solo home run by Wiginton in the
top of the first.
Hie lead didn't last long, howev
er, as Cal sophomore Paige Bowie
led off with a home run of her own.
The Bears continued the rally and
used six singles, a walk and an error
to tally seven runs. Cal worked its
way through 10 hitters before the
Cardinal could find three outs.
After the first inning, senior
pitcher Marcy Crouch settled down
and kept Cal scoreless, allowing
only four hits the remainder of the
game, but Stanford was unable to
add any runs of its own. The Cardi
nal left the bases loaded twice, and
was robbed of runs by stellar Cal
defense on at least two occasions.
While game one was decided

after the first inning, game two
wasn't decided until the final pitch
of the game.
The Bears tallied single runs in
both the second and third inning,
and the teams entered into the sev
enth with Cal leading 2-0.
In its biggest rally of the day, the
Cardinal put three runs on the
board. The rally began with one out
as freshman Sarah Beeson was hit
by a pitch. Freshman Robin Walker
then followed with a single to cen
ter. Senior Michelle Acosta then hit
a bouncer to the second baseman in
what looked to be a routine out.
Walker used clever baserunning,
however, to stop just in front of the
fielder to avoid the tag. By the time
the second baseman realized the sit
uation, she threw to first, but it was
too late to get Acosta, loading the
bases.
Crouch then grounded out to

short, but picked up an RBI as junior
Lauren Ciellman. running for Bee
son, came across to score. Freshman
Christina Chao came up with the
clutch hit, driving a single to right to
bring home Walker and Acosta.
The Cardinal was unable to keep
the momentum in the bottom of the
innning. however, as Cal loaded the
bases with two walks and a single.
That brought senior shortstop
Katie May to the plate.
May crushed the 0-1 pitch to
dead center for the grand slam and
the ballgame. The win was the
eighth consecutive for Cal, and the
10th in the Bears' last 11 games.
But the Cardinal must now look
toward the postseason and put all
frustrations behind it. Receiving
the third seed in the region hosted
by defending NCAA champions
No. 4 Fresno State, the Cardinal
has a tough road ahead.
"It is one of the toughest region
al by far," Rittman said.
The Fresno State Bulldogs are
the top seed in the region which
also includes No. 14 South Caroli
na, Stanford, Pacific, Texas Tech
and Florida A&M.
The Cardinal opens play against
Pacific, who it has both beat 4-1 and
lost to 3-1 earlier this season. Stan
ford has also beaten Texas Tech 1-
0 and South Carolina 8-0.
In the tournament, however,
anything can happen.
"In the postseason, every game
is a pressure game," Rittman said.
"You just have to come ready to
play and respect your opponents no
matter who they are."
And as Crouch articulated, to
win the title, the team must be able
to beat anybody.
"We have to be playing well to
make it to the World Series, so we
might as well get ready with the
best," she said. "We've been doing
it all year with the Pac-10."
