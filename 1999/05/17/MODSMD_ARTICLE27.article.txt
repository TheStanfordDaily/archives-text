# Financial aid takes electronic leap
## Upcoming changes will put loan information, applications on Web 
### Vlada Teper Contributing writer 
A series of new financial aid ser
vices for students seeks to streamline
loan applications and to communi
cate information after business hours.
The largest change planned for
the 1999-2(KX) academic year will
allow students awarded a Stafford
loan or additional Stafford loan
funds to complete their application
information via. the Web. The
process is being tested on students
still applying lor loans in the 1998-99
academic year.
"We are doing it right now as an
experiment," said Cynthia Hartley,
director of student awards at the fi
nancial Aid Office. "We want to
make sure it works right before get
ting it out to everybody."
Loan guarantor Northwest Edu
cation Loan Association, which re
ceives the application information
once a student is awarded a Stafford
loan, sponsored the change.
With the new system, a student's
Stafford loan application is made
available on the Web. When it is
available the Financial Aid C)ffice no
tifies the student via e-mail that the
application is ready for completion.
Once completed, printed, signed

and returned to NHLA. loan funds
are disbursed with an electronic funds
transfer to the student's University
account.
"We hope that this alternative can
help students more easily handle the
loan application process, especially if
they are away from home during the
summer," Hartley said. "We also
hope that the alternative will help
those who want to speed up the
process of getting their funds to satis
fy the Bursar's ()ffice or have a diffi
cult lime managing all the paper in
volved in the financial aid process."
Currently, application informa
tion is only available on line for 15
days. If the student does not complete
the application in that time, NELA
will print and mail a hard copy of the
application to the student. In the fu
ture. however, the application will
probably be available for a longer pe
riod of time.
The Web-based alternative has
proved popular even before its com
plete unveiling.
"It would be faster," said Marie
Wang, a sophomore who received
Stafford loans her freshman year.
Sohi Sohn. a current recipient ol
Stafford and Plus loans, said, "That
would be much easier. It is just more
convenient to use an application il it is

on the Web. And it comes out neater
if you can use the computer."
The participants in the 1 995-99 ex
periment who have used the Web this
year provided mixed responses.
"Some students like it. But we also
received a response from a parent
who did not like the fact that the doc
ument still has to be signed and sent."
I lartley said. "It is a promissory note,
though, and the government present
ly does not have another option avail
able."
I he new process also increases the
importance of keeping one's e-mail
and other addresses, as well as regis
tration status, up to date using Axess.
The new Web loan application is
leading up to another major change
planned for the 2(XK)-()1 academic
year. Called Master Promissory
Note, the program would use a Web
based verification system to replace
the annual paperwork associated
with re-applying for financial aid.
Students could use the Web to vet
ify the information they provided the
previous year. If information such ;is
their permanent mailing address and
intended date ol graduation has not
changed, students could then print a
copy of the old information, sign it
and return it.
I lartlev. however, said there is one

hurdle such ;i system must clear.
IJser-friendly loan applications
should still require enough thought to
discourage light-hearted borrowing.
"We do want people to be aware
that they are borrowing and the im
plications of that." Hartley said.
An additional service should take
effect prior to the Master Promissory
Note program. I'he Financial Aid Of
fice's Interactive Voice Response sys
tem in which students can answer
many of their pressing questions 24
hours a day will become available on
line as well.
I .'sing the voice response system,
students can call 5-LOAN locally or
888-FAC)-3773 from outside the Bay
Area to check the status of their fi
nancial aid or loan application as well
as the status of their Stafford. Perkins
or I University loan funds.
"We want to make this same in
formation available to students on
the Internet. This will give students
the information they need without
making a trip to Old Union," Hartley
said. The online system should be in
place by September.
The planned changes are not re
placements for the previous system.
"The\ are additions. It provides stu
dents with more alternatives," Hart
lev s;iid.
