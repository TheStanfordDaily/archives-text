People say that no one dates at Stanford. Not true,
1 "date" all the time. Here are some fabulous ideas
lor super dates I've been on:
1 took a hot boy to Miyake's for a first date. He
couldn't hear me so I didn't have to talk, I just smiled
and fell off my chair into his arms. Broken glass is
cool.

1 took another boy to a party in Suites where he
took off his shirt and groped the girl who lived there. 1 went to the bathroom and cried,
but then he walked me home and kept his shirt off the whole time.
The Dutch Goose has a special romantic ambience. "Let's Get it On" is always playing,
and dates get jealous when sketchy old drunks like Rob and Yarmo invite me to their hot
tub.
Another fun date idea is dinner at Stern Dining Hall. Build a seductress's enclave with
the potted plants. Lure him into staying several hours with the promise of Junior Mints
at Late Nite.
Drive-ins are a good place to smooch, but there's not a theater around here. So get some
couples together and buy some cardboard boxes. Each couple cuts out and paints their
.ardboard box to resemble their dream car. Then you can watch a video and pretend
you're at the drive-in.
My personal favorite location for a steamy date is the inner room of 105 in an anony
mous fraternity (T.D.C). However, you must schedule an appointment.


Lake Lag makes me so horny!
