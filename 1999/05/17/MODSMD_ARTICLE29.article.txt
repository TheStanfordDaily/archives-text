# A 						little ditty about Jack and Diane

### Bob Gates 
Suckin' on a chili dog, gallant, sexy Daily
reporter Hob Gates wandered White Plaza
during last weekend's Spring Faire, searching
for the ultimate Stanford Love Story. Stanford
students seemed to echo the sentiment,
"We're too busy for love," as they made their
busy ways through the plaza to Sweet Hall
and the Meyer Library compound.
Our intrepid reporter kept walking until he
made it to the front of the Quad. Sitting there
in front of the Poli Sci building, gazing out
onto the Oval, were Jack and Diane, two
American kids who grew up in the heartland.
They seemed like two hearts beating in just
one mind, so the courageous reporter sat
down and struck up a conversation. "Aw,
aren't you two just the sweetest things? How
did you meet?"
lack smiled and responded, "We met in
Oklahoma. I was going to be a football star."
"And 1 was going to be a debutante in the
back of his car!" laughed Diane.
"How did you end up at Stanford?" the
dauntless reporter asked.
"Well, Diane made me see that I had my
priori ties all wrong, so I gave up football and
came out here to become an intellectual.
Diane had another year of school left, but we
managed to stay together. Then she came out
here after she graduated. We broke up several
years ago, and today is the first time that
we've spent any time together in a long
while."

"Yeah, I came out here," joined in Diane,
"because I'd always wanted to go to Stanford.
In rural Oklahoma, not many people make it
out to California, but I thought, well, why
not. Now I'm going to become an engineer
and build little pink houses, sanctuaries safe
and strong!"
"Ain't that Stanford," responded the brave
but disappointed reporter. "Love really does
n't exist here. Well, at least you're still friends."
"Oh yes," said Diane. "Life goes on!"
"What are you going to do after school,
Jack?" questioned the bold reporter.
"Well, I'm certainly not going to let the days
smolder like paper and fire," Jack said with a
wan smile. "I'm thinking of staying in
California and starting a small farm where I
can be near Stanford. I've bought some land
in the hills, and I plan to grow cantaloupe
there during the day and maybe do some
writing at night. There's no bathroom there,
so I'm going to have to build a john. In fact,
I'm planning on driving the ol' '77 Cougar
down there tonight to check on my melon
camp."
"Well, it sounds like you kids are doing the
best you can. Thanks for letting me speak to
you." And the gallant, sexy reporter got up
and walked away.
But before he made it too far, he overheard
Jack softly ask Diane out for a key west inter
mezzo.
He was too far away to hear her reply, but
he laughed softly to himself. Go get 'em,
Jackie.
And so it goes....
