## Cardinal clinches Pac-10 championship 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Stanford came to Los Angeles with a goal: to win the Pacific 10
( (inference ( 'hampionship.
The Cardinal had a two-game lead over defending national
champion USC with only one conference series — a three-game
set against UCI.A — left to play.
I he Bruins, a talented yet wildly inconsistent young team, had
their own goals in mind. The team, which came in with a middling
29-27 record, needed to sweep, or at least win two of three, to earn
a berth in the postseason.
Something would have to break: one dream would have to be
shattered.
For the first time in years, the dream that died was not colored
Cardinal red.
Sixth-ranked Stanford beat IJCLA N-7 Friday in 10 innings and
14-4 yesterday to win the three-game series and the Pac-10 title, its
first since IW4.
Though UCLA won 12-7 Saturday, Stanford actually clinched
the championship outright with I JSC's 8-7 loss to Washington that
afternoon.
Regardless of how or when the team won, the Cardinal was
more than glad to bring home the title. The last two seasons. Stan
lord won the old Southern Division of the Pac-10 before losing to
Washington in the conference championship series.
"I don't care how we win it," said junior first baseman John Gall.
Stanford's series star. "lt d be more exciting to win it on the field,
for sure. Hut I've been here three years and we've had this thing
ripped from us the last series every year I've been here. So. it's nice
to win it any way we can."
Senior catcher John Salter, who went 4-for-6 with two home
runs and a double in Sunday's series-deciding victory, said the win

was similarly meaningful for the seniors on the team.
"[Josh] Hochgcsang. (Tony] Cogan and I have been talking
about it a lot. Losing to Washington twice was heartbreaking. Hut
wc finally got it on the third try," Salter said.
Friday, it seemed like the Cardinal might not get it at all.
Heeause UCLA's ace, sophomore Jon Hrandt. was sidelined
with arm troubles. Friday's pitching matchup seemed to be lop
sided at first look.
Stanford sophomore Jason Young, who has established himself

as one of the nation's top pitchers,
was facing the Bruins' struggling
third starter, sophomore Ryan
Carter.
Carter's numbers, 1-7 with a 7.58
ERA coming into the game, were
somewhat deceiving, though.
After posting a 3-1 record with a
6.39 ERA in his freshman campaign
and looking sharp in fall practice,
Carter began the season listed as
UCLA's top starter. Bruin head
coach Clary Adams expected Carter
to be one of the best left-handers in
the nation.
For most of the game. Carter
seemed to have regained the domi
nance that looked lost for much of the
year. Allowing only one hit in his first
seven innings, Carter turned the ta
bles on the Cardinal by making the
contest a quick blowout in favor of
UCLA.
However, after Stanford junior
Jeff Rizzo grounded out to third base
to begin the eighth. Carter was hit in
the face by a sharp groundball hit up
the middle by Gall. Though he shook
it off and stayed on the mound.
Carter would not last long. He gave
up a double to sophomore Joe Bor
chard down the right field line, threw
a wild pitch that allowed Gall to score
and then walked junior Nick Day.
After that walk, Adams decided

Carter, who was Hearing 150 pitches,
had done enough and brought in star
sophomore reliever Chad Cislak out
of the pen.
With Carter out of the game, the
door was open for the Cardinal.
In the eighth, Cislak walked ju
nior Edmund Muth with the bases
loaded to score Joe Borchard and
bring Stanford within four.

In the ninth, junior pinch-hitter
Craig Thompson, Rizzo and Gall hit
three straight singles to load the
bases, and Hochgesang doubled
down the left-field line to clear the
bases. Then, with two outs and
Hochgesang still on second base, ju
nior Nick Day lined a single to score
the senior third baseman and tie the
game at seven.
After senior closer Tony Cogan
shut the Bruins down in the bottom
of the ninth. Stanford came up in the
l()th looking to close the deal.
Junior Edmund Muth singled to
center field to lead off the inning.
After pinch-hitter Andy Topham
popped up. Thompson slammed a

double to right-center field. Muth, ig
noring coach Dean Stotz's stop sign,
rounded third base and slid home,
seemingly in front of Cislak's cutoff
throw. However, he was called out
and the game remained tied.
But the inning was not done.
Following a walk to junior Jeff
Rizzo, Gall singled through the box,
Thompson came around from sec
ond to score and Stanford had its first
lead of the game.
Cogan closed out the game in
style, retiring the Bruins in order to
capture the tone-setting win for the
Cardinal. Stanford scored eight
straight runs to win and clinch at least
a tie for the conference title.
Saturday, UCLA repaid the Car
dinal with a stirring comeback of its
own.
Following Friday's devastating
loss, it seemed likely the Bruins
would come out Hat. Having blown a
seven-run lead and its shot at a
sweep, the Bruins seemed to have lit
tle to play for.
For most of the game, it appeared
that the dejected young team agreed.
Buoyed by Gall's career day —
three two-run home runs in five at
bats — Stanford jumped to a 7-3 lead
after seven innings.
But UCLA, sensing its season
hanging in the balance, broke out for
a surprising nine-run eighth inning.
Pounding the Cardinal into sub
mission, the Bruins chased starter

Justin Wayne from the game and
went through four other Stanford re
lievers in the same inning.
Sunday was set for a fittingly wild
finale.
After Stanford jumped out to a 5-
0 lead on Salter's three-run home
run, UCLA got two runs in both the
fifth and sixth innings. UCLA sopho
more Bill Scott hit his third home run
of the series — one in each game —
to bring the Bruins within one run.
But the rollicking finish never
came.
Freshman starter Brian Sager
shut down the high-powered UCLA
offense and the Cardinal broke out
for five runs in the seventh and four
runs in the eighth to seal the deal and
the l()-run victory.
The first two games had most of
the action and most of the impor
tance. By Sunday, Stanford was al
ready the Pac-1() champion. But, the
Cardinal, led by the talented but in
consistent Sager, made a statement
with its climactic closing.
"Obviously there was the chance
for a letdown after we won it yester
day," said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "But the guy who picked
it up for us was Sager."
Salter agreed.
"He had great confidence today,"
he said. "Even when Scott hit that
home run, he really was never out of
control in the game. He's going to be
a great pitcher."
