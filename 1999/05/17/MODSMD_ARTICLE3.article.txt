## Cardinal clinches Pac-10 championship 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Stanford came to Los Angeles with a goal: to win the Pacific 10
( (inference ( 'hampionship.
The Cardinal had a two-game lead over defending national
champion USC with only one conference series — a three-game
set against UCI.A — left to play.
I he Bruins, a talented yet wildly inconsistent young team, had
their own goals in mind. The team, which came in with a middling
29-27 record, needed to sweep, or at least win two of three, to earn
a berth in the postseason.
Something would have to break: one dream would have to be
shattered.
For the first time in years, the dream that died was not colored
Cardinal red.
Sixth-ranked Stanford beat IJCLA N-7 Friday in 10 innings and
14-4 yesterday to win the three-game series and the Pac-10 title, its
first since IW4.
Though UCLA won 12-7 Saturday, Stanford actually clinched
the championship outright with I JSC's 8-7 loss to Washington that
afternoon.
Regardless of how or when the team won, the Cardinal was
more than glad to bring home the title. The last two seasons. Stan
lord won the old Southern Division of the Pac-10 before losing to
Washington in the conference championship series.
"I don't care how we win it," said junior first baseman John Gall.
Stanford's series star. "lt d be more exciting to win it on the field,
for sure. Hut I've been here three years and we've had this thing
ripped from us the last series every year I've been here. So. it's nice
to win it any way we can."
Senior catcher John Salter, who went 4-for-6 with two home
runs and a double in Sunday's series-deciding victory, said the win

was similarly meaningful for the seniors on the team.
"[Josh] Hochgcsang. (Tony] Cogan and I have been talking
about it a lot. Losing to Washington twice was heartbreaking. Hut
wc finally got it on the third try," Salter said.
Friday, it seemed like the Cardinal might not get it at all.
Heeause UCLA's ace, sophomore Jon Hrandt. was sidelined
with arm troubles. Friday's pitching matchup seemed to be lop
sided at first look.
