# Our real, live, breathing Stanford date
## 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
This past weekend, something incredible
happened to Schmuck and Putz.
We had a date!
After months of lining up outside sorori
ties begging for admittance, we finally caught
some bushy-haired girl's attention. You know
what they say: Can't get laid? Tri Delt!
Now, we're not saying that this girl was a
piece of work or anything special. But she was
a girl, nonetheless. She was a boozy femme
fatale, dressed in a tight mini-skirt that
revealed her meaty side. Her mascara was
smeared by her three-inch thick glasses,
which partly covered the hair-sprouting mole
on her nose. Her streaks of blue and green
dyed hair were as vivid as a summer sea.
They say that most people find their future
spouses in college. Yes, we decided, this was
the girl that we were going to marry. And to
think that Bertha was a sorority pledge!

Home run! Grand slam! Score,

baby, score!
But enough of this ballyhoo,
this hogwash. This shilly-shally
ing about that moonlit evening
in May is absurd! We're here to
give you our personal, intimate,
detailed accounts of the
evening. So, here we go, deep
into the subconscious of
Schmuck and Putz:

Putz: Bertha, light of my life,
fire of my loins. My sin, my
soul. Bertha: the tip of my
tongue taking a trip two steps
down the palate, to tap, at two,
on the teeth. Ber-tha.

As we were waiting to pick Bertha up out
side her dorm, I yelled at Schmuck to tuck in
his shirt. He was an absolute mess: his hair
was dishevelled and his tie had come undone.
Schmuck just doesn't understand the concept
of being presentable in front of a proper lady.
When she arrived, time stopped. Her heavy
steps shook the earth with a tremor that
reverberated in my heart.
When we attempted to fit her into the back
seat of Schmuck's Acura, problems arose.
After 15 minutes of heaving and hauling
Bertha, trying to fit her anywhere in the car,
we gave up. Schmuck got out some of his
rope and tied her to the car's hood. No wor
ries— we were set for any problems that
could arise.

Schmuck: After a good push through the
front door of Bob's Big Boy, we asked for an
extra-large booth. Putz and I sat across from
Bertha, so together we could gaze into her
beautifully crossed eyes. As Putz leaned over
to caress her arm, I kicked him. There was
absolutely no way that he was going to steal
my chance at a Stanford bang. Tonight, I was
going all the way!
Putz: I hate Schmuck! I still have a bruise
from that night. I was just trying to see if I
could fit both hands around her arm. That
jealous bastard! He wanted my Bertha, and
there was no way he was going to get her.
If only I could get Schmuck out of the pic
ture, I'd have Bertha all to myself. I gave him
subtle hints throughout the evening that she
was my territory. Maybe writing my name in
magic marker on her cellulite was a bit over
board. But the tension was nonetheless there.

Schmuck: Putz is the devil! How dare he
write on her luscious overflowing skin. That
was my idea! We paid our bill and planned on
going to a movie. After strapping Bertha
down, we were off to the AMC Mercado. Of
course, everything was sold out, even "Doug's
First Movie." We were hung low and dry, and
we had to think quickly. Betha was getting
anxious.
Putz: I suggested that we play charades in the
Mercado parking lot. That way, I could dis
guise my lust for Bertha in harmless signs.
As I acted out the pool scene from
"Showgirls" — my hips in full thrust, my hair
gently blowing in the wind and my pelvis in

motion — I knew that Bertha was finally
falling for me. Her nervous tic was calming
down.
Schmuck: Bertha shouted out "Porkys"—

she was close. I knew the night
was coming to an end. What
were we doing standing in a
parking lot, when there was a
bed to fill?
Putz: Nature called Bertha out
of that dismal parking lot. She
had personal duties to attend to,
and Schmuck and 1 were not
going to argue with her. We
scampered after our Tri-Delt as
she entered the Mercado theater
lobby. There we waited.

Schmuck: Let's go, I thought
Putz: We can't, 1 thought.

Schmuck: Why not? I questioned.
Putz: We're waiting for Bertha, I rationalized.
Schmuck: That's right: we were waiting for
Bertha. The love of my life. The mother of my
children. The Venus de Milo of Stanford. The
Tri-Delt's Mona Lisa. The Roseanne of my
heart.
Putz: Bertha never came out of the bathroom
that night. When we snuck into t.i women's
restroom to find her, all the stalls were empty.
The window, however, was WIDE open, and
her wiff was in the air. It was a scent that I will
never forget. It was the scent of a woman.
Perhaps some things just aren't meant to
be


Terror on the highway!
