### Abhishek Bajoria Contributing writer 
Before a crowd of about 50 people in ( üb
berly Auditorium on Friday, author Andrew
Vachss urged members of the gay communi
ty to make being gay their foremost political
identity.
Vachss was the keynote speaker for Stan
ford's annual Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Days. This year's theme is
"Fighting Back: Eradicating Violence
Against Our Community."
An attorney specializing in juvenile law.
Vachss is the author of "Choice of Evil." a
book condemning gay bashing.
He said the "lunatic Christian right be
lieves gays can be converted," which drew
laughs from the audience. He then went on
to say gays "cannot merge with a society that
is not willing to accept them."

If you raise the stakes, less people
will play — be it poker or violence.'
—Andrew Vachss, bglad speaker

Regarding gay hashing, he argued that
gays J are in a war. People are shooting at
them, and they are trying to figure out why
[the gay hashers) are doing it — so they can
get them to stop."
Vachss argued against trying to change
people and doubted that gay bashers, it edu
cated. would change their ways. I le said that
"no one's mind will be changed by debate."
According to Vachss, the only way to re
duce gav bashing is to impose higher penal
ties upon the perpetrators. "If you raise the

violence." he said.
Vachss also opposes hate crime
laws because, as a lawyer, they
make it harder for him to get crimi
nals convicted. He said that, in ad
dition to proving that the defen
dant committed the act, he also has
to demonstrate the motivation and
intent behind the crime — a diffi
cult task.

This plays into the hands ol "ju
rors who want to an exeuse to ac
quit." he saiil. adding that higher
penalties for all violent crimes, not
specific gay-friendly laws, are most
effective.
I lie major error of the gay com
munity. Vachss said, is its inability
to unite around self-interest. He
suggested that the rest of the world
views the gay community as united
when in fact it is not. Instead, the
community is split along ethnic and
class lines.

I he problem is that "gay people
don't identify with [ being J gay
first," and that is why they get tram
pled upon, he said. I his lack ol a
sense of "universality" reduces
their effectiveness as a group.
For example. Vachss attributed
the success of the National Rifle
Association in Congress to its "de
liverable" vote, not its financial
power. The NRA is not divided by
race and class, and its polities tran
scend these "petty" concerns.
Vachss called upon gays to do

the same.
He implored gays to question
their perceptions and realize that
there "are more important things"
than themselves.
In conclusion, he said "the solu
tions that 1 originally thought were
viable ones are not [viable] as long
as the outsider's perception of a gay
community is not backed by a uni
fied gay community." Unless there
is a willingness to say that "my first
identity is gay." there will be no
change.
