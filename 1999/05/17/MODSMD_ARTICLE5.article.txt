### Joshua Fried Contributing writer 
When Stanford's
Class of 20()3 arrives this
fall it will be more than
100 students larger than
planned for.and Univer
sity administrators are
planning for the far
reaching repercussions
likely be felt on the Farm.
This year. 1.740 stu-

dents — 134 more than last year and well above the
target number of 1,610 — accepted their offers of ad
mission. To date, the yield rate of students accepting
has climbed to 64.7 percent, up from 64.1 percent last
year.
To compensate for the larger-than-expected fresh
men numbers, only 31 transfer students out of 1.303
applicants were offered admission.
Last year 126 transfer students were admitted. The
admit rate for transfers fell to 2.5 percent, down al
most 7 percent.
"This year there's really not going to be room for
many transfers," said Robert Kinnally, dean of under
graduate admissions and financial aid.
Kinnally attributed the increase in yield to many
factors, including the move last year to abandon the
Early Decision II application option.
