# 1,740 accept invite to join Class of '03
## Extra space for frosh made by slashing transfer spaces 
### Joshua Fried Contributing writer 
When Stanford's
Class of 20()3 arrives this
fall it will be more than
100 students larger than
planned for.and Univer
sity administrators are
planning for the far
reaching repercussions
likely be felt on the Farm.
This year. 1.740 stu-

dents — 134 more than last year and well above the
target number of 1,610 — accepted their offers of ad
mission. To date, the yield rate of students accepting
has climbed to 64.7 percent, up from 64.1 percent last
year.
To compensate for the larger-than-expected fresh
men numbers, only 31 transfer students out of 1.303
applicants were offered admission.
Last year 126 transfer students were admitted. The
admit rate for transfers fell to 2.5 percent, down al
most 7 percent.
"This year there's really not going to be room for
many transfers," said Robert Kinnally, dean of under
graduate admissions and financial aid.
Kinnally attributed the increase in yield to many
factors, including the move last year to abandon the
Early Decision II application option.

"We didn't know what was
going to happen with one round of
Early Decision. We were being
conservative [when we offered reg
ular admission this yearj," he said.
Historically, about half of the
"regular review" applicants accept
their offers of admission, but this
year's pool included students who
may otherwise have applied Early
Decision II and were fairly certain
they would attend Stanford if given
the opportunity. The "regular re
view" yield this year was 55.5 percent.
Kinnally also cited the Office of
Undergraduate Admission's
strong effort this year to sway
prospective students.
"[Admit] Weekend itself was
tremendous. We had various new
programs, and the weather was
beautiful," he said. "Students and
faculty did a fabulous job of giving
people a lot of individual atten
tion."

According to Kinnally, Stanford
is "line with housing" and the in
coming class will place no further
strains on the already tight housing
supply. The current number of
soon-to-be enrolling freshmen and
transfer students is 30 more than
the University can accommodate.
However, Kinnally expects the
"summer melt" — the slight drop
in enrollment numbers that occurs
every summer — to alleviate any
concerns.
"Students get off the wait list at
other schools, they change their
mind about attending Stanford
right away, or there's some emer
gency," Kinnally said. "Every year
we lose 30 or 40."
The large freshman class "will
be a burden" for other offices and
departments, according to Kinnal
ly. "We got the word out as soon as
we heard, and the response has
been positive," he said.
Assoc. Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ellen Woods
predicted several difficulties. Orga
nizing advising groups for the extra

freshmen, finding enough staff for
Introduction to the Humanities
courses and combating the lack of
adequate classroom space will be
challenging.
"Freshmen have I-Hum and
Writing and Critical Thinking, and
when you add that many sections,
they all have to be in classrooms,
and that's a challenge," she said.
"We will probably have to use dif
ferent hours in the day to accom
modate."'
The Class of 2004 will feel the ef
fects as well. Kinnally expects next
year's admit rate to drop a percent

age point or two due to the higher
yield Stanford now boasts. "We
know we can increase yield, and the
only way to adjust is to admit fewer
students."
Kinnally said he has contacted
all the deans. University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice and informed them
of the situation.
"The president and provost are
very pleased about the yield," Kin
nally said. "Its always a wonderful
thing when your yield goes up. It
means Stanford is a really hot
place."
