# Priority apps evoking ire
## Students think system unfair, inconsistent at some residences

Sophomore Anne Berry is a vocalist in the Stanford
Symphonic Chorus and sits on the board of the Stan
ford Savoyards. She wanted to live in Kimball, the per
forming arts focus dormitory, next year, but was de
nied priority. Nnanna Ogbu. a sophomore who said he
is "marginally interested in American Studies," re
ceived priority in American Studies house on the basis
of an essay he wrote the day the application was due.
With Draw priority results announced over the past
two weeks, some students are questioning the equity
of the priority system.
"The idea behind priority is it ensures the house
and the students who are assigned there that the pop
ulation is committed to that particular theme," said
Kathleen Bransfield, manager of housing assignment
services. "That's why priority bumps a lower draw
n umber."
Bransfield explained that focus dormitories like
Kimball are allowed to till one-third of the dormitory
with priority residents, while theme houses — usually
based on a language or academic theme —can be
filled completely by students with priority.
But some students are upset about several prob
lems with the priority system.
A significant issue is the lack of communication be-

tween houses and priority appli
cants. Though application proce
dures arc similar at many houses,
some houses give priority to all ap
plicants while others reject any
where from a few to more than half

of the number of applicants.
Also the houses do not directly
notify applicants if they are denied
priority.
Another problem with priority
is that of hundreds of qualified peo
ple applying for a relatively small
number of priority spaces, as in
Kimball.
Junior Jesse Liu organized Kim

ball's priority application process
this year.
He said Kimball staff members
and resident fellows read the 377
applications and granted priority to
150, 70 who will get into Kimball
based on priority.
They judged on the basis of per
forming arts background, how well
the two-paragraph application was

written and the "intangible" ele
ment of how applicants would
"contribute to the overall atmos
phere," including an assessment of
whether they were applying just to
live in a nice dorm.
According to Kimball RF
Jonathan Berger, "the sheer num
hers of applicants took lis hy sur
prise, and the majority were clearly
qualified."
Berry said she is annoyed so few
applicants got priority at Kimball
and thinks more than the current
one-third of the dorm should be al
located for priority.
"I've heard many theme dorms
are a farce." she said, "in part due
to the fact that ;t lot of people are
not there because they're interest
ed in the theme."
Also, the fact that only 70 slots
in Kimball are allocated to priority
was not widely publicized.
On the other hand. Eastern Eu
ropean theme dorm Slavianskii
l)om is "lax" about giving out pri
ority. according to senior focus as
sistant Amy Kovac.
"Seventy people applied for pri
ority. and we gave it to almost
everyone." she said. Kovac just
wanted to make sure the applicant
was interested, so she viewed the
question of what people would do
for the house if they lived there as
the most important on the applica
tion.
She alleged that the few appli
cants denied priority were "not se
rious enough you can tell people
who spent five minutes on the ap
plication."
But Allison l.eidner was inter
ested in the theme. The freshman
applied for and was denied priority
in Slav Doni even though she was
excited about participating in
theme activities. She planned to
give a presentation about Slavic
composers and a demonstration of
their music.
Leidncr and other applicants
denied priority at Slav l)om were
also never told that they did not re
ceive priority. Leidncr assumed
that Slav l)om was slow in entering
results into Axcss,

Believing they are qualified,
many students assume that they
will receive priority and only find
out about denials when they in
quire. usually after the deadline to
possibly apply elsewhere.
Also, with the large number of
successful applicants to award at
Slav Doni and other houses, mis
takes entering priority results are
inevitable, and the current system
does not distinguish between a re
jection and an oversight.
I .eidncr and many other priority
applicants also had the problem of
being interested in learning more
about a theme but not having back
ground or experience in the area to
prove that interest.
A similar situation occurred in
Kimball this year, where applicants
who were not active in the arts
were the first to be denied, accord
ing to Berger.
Compounding this problem is
that some applicants are not truly
committed to the theme.
Junior Randy lish. a current
priority resident in public policy
theme dormitory Castano. said the
down side ol priority is that "Stan
ford students are pretty good at
BS-ing il they want to." He said
people who have "heartfelt de
sires" to live in a priority house and
someone who just wants good
housing can turn in equally good
applications.
"There's only so much you can
tell about people on a one-page ap
plication." he said. Along these
lines, most houses usually give pri
oritv to past residents of the house,
because the stall alrcad\ knows
they will contribute.
Castano focus assistant Kather
ine 1.00. a senior, helped read its
130 applications. She agreed it is
hard to distinguish true interest
from trying to get ;i good place to
live.
"What's most important to us is
interest." she said, "but how we
judge that is past experience."
