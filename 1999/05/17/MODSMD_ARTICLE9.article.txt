# Five bands, a lazy afternoon and beer
## Informal concert, Sun Jam, attracts passersby to Flo Mo field for afternoon of music 
### Mariam Ali Contributing writer 
The sun was shining, the grass was green, the
beer was flowing and the music was good. Five
Stanford bands gathered on the field behind Flo
rence Moore Hall to play rock, blues and jazz in an
informal concert yesterday afternoon.
The idea for "Sun Jam 99" was born at the Phi
Kappa Psi Battle of the Bands in March, when a
few campus musicians decided that playing to
gether informally would be fun.
"A bunch of us sat around and thought, let's do
this in a non-competitive way. It is great to play to
gether," said senior Kim Coffey, lead singer of
Too Much Neon.
"We began really organizing this in the past
month," added a fellow band member, senior
Danny Morrow. "And once we got funding, we

were all set."
The concert was fully sponsored by the Presi
dent's Fund, an arm of the University that gives
money to one-time events put on by Stanford stu
dents. The bands needed funding to rent stage
equipment, post flyers on campus and buy free
sodas for spectators. The keg was bought with
personal funds.
Too Much Neon musicians invited other bands
from the March contest to join the festival. Tin
Ashley, Ware Wendell and his Hep Blues Quar
tet, School of Ruckus and Good Pilgrim accepted
the invitation.
The camaraderie before the show was obvious,
as various band members teased each other about
their musical selections, set up the stereo equip
ment together and hauled ice for the sodas.
Tin Ashley opened the show at noon to a hand
ful of spectators. "Hello, please come listen to us
play," the band members called out jokingly to
passers by.
Once the band succeeded in attracting a stu
dent's attention, it was encouraged to "play quick
ly, 'cause you've got one." Amidst much laughter

about the poor turnout, musicians from other
hands began to dance and cheer loudly to make
up for the lack of an audience.
Within 30 minutes, however, students were
pouring in to listen to the music. Florence Moore
residents came with trays of juice and pancakes.
Others showed up with beach blankets and home
work.
"My friend is playing up there It is a nice
day in the sun," junior Ross Venook explained.
"I'll stay a couple of hours."
Junior Olivia Svilik sprawled on a blanket with
a statistics textbook in front of her. "This is great,"
she said. "Stanford students are really talented,
and I support any opportunity for them to express
themselves."
Since many of the band members are graduat
ing, Sun Jam is one of the bands' last big events to
gether.
"This is sort of a last senior fling," Coffey said.
Steve Kessler of Good Pilgrim looked at the
people in shorts, T-shirts and sunglasses dancing
around on the grass and grinned. "Yeah baby, this
is what I live for,"he said.
