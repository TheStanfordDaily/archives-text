Proto-Indo-European is generally held to have originated on the Eurasian
steppe and to have spread from there westward to Europe, south to Anatolia
and the Transcaucasus, and east to Central Asia (whence Tocharian and Indo-
Iranlan). However, the linguistic geography and the chronology of the Indo-
European spread point more strongly to a center of dispersal in Central Asia,
specifically the vicinity of ancient Bactria and/or Sogdiana.
Evidence Includes: the pattern of Indo-European loan vocabulary in the indige
nous languages of the Caucasus; the shape of the Indo-European family tree
and the locations of the major branches on the ground; the evident age of
Indo-European in comparison to archaeological thresholds such as the first
appearance of wheeled vehicles, the diffusion of wool to the steppe, and the
first steppe influence on Europe; the order in which centum (western) and satem
(eastern) languages entered northern Europe, central Europe, and Anatolia;
the origins of the likely ancient sisters to Proto-Indo-European; and the structural
type of Proto-Indo-European, whose typological affinities extend eastward to
Siberia. So viewed, the Indo-European spread is much like the later spreads of
Indo-lranian, Turkic, and Mongolian, all of which emanated from Central Asia.
