Rome may not have been built in a day. but
the Stanford climbing wall hasn't been built in
two years.
In 1997 the Climbing Wall Group received
$25,(XK) from students as a part of ASSU special
fees to build a climbing wall on campus for the
enjoyment of students, staff and faculty.
Since then, the project has been slowed by
continuous delays.
Sophomore Dan Arnold, the owner of the
climbing wall e-mail list, said that the ('limbing

the climbing wall was "supposed to have gotten
done last summer." but delays involving licens

moving forward.
Climbing Wall Group members and Comp-
Wall are frustrated with what they perceive as
the University's stalling tactics.
There has been an "incredible amount of
hoop-jumping and red tape associated with
