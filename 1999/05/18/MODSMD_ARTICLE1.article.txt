# Climbing Wall hits difficult obstacles
## 
### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
Rome may not have been built in a day. but
the Stanford climbing wall hasn't been built in
two years.
In 1997 the Climbing Wall Group received
$25,(XK) from students as a part of ASSU special
fees to build a climbing wall on campus for the
enjoyment of students, staff and faculty.
Since then, the project has been slowed by
continuous delays.
Sophomore Dan Arnold, the owner of the
climbing wall e-mail list, said that the ('limbing
Wall Group is not responsible for the hold-up.
"All delays have come from either lack of com
munication from the administration to the stu
dents or from direct administration mind
changes, foul-ups or delays," he said.
The first delay occurred when agreement
could not be reached on where to place the
climbing wall. According to Arnold, the group
was "promised at various times different
spaces, none of which actually worked."
After negotiating with the Athletics De
partment. it was finally agreed that the wall

would be constructed in an old racquetball
court at deGuerre Aquatics Center
Another hold-up occurred when the origi
nal liaison between the Athletics Department
and the Climbing Wall Group left her job.
"The contact person we were assigned to
within the Athletics Department quit her job
basically right in the middle of our process, so
we were forced to start all over with a new de
partment person." said junior Dennis Mur
phree, a leading member of the Climbing Wall
Group.
CompWall, a San Francisco-based compa
ny. has been hired to complete the project. Ac
cording to CompWall representative Jeff Clair,
the climbing wall was "supposed to have gotten
done last summer." but delays involving licens
ing issues have prevented the project from
moving forward.
Climbing Wall Group members and Comp-
Wall are frustrated with what they perceive as
the University's stalling tactics.
There has been an "incredible amount of
hoop-jumping and red tape associated with

working with the University adminis
tration" Murphree said.
According to Facilities Coordina
tor David Schinski, the primary rea
son that the wall has not been con
structed is that CompWall "does not
have the appropriate certificates of
insurance and licensees to enter a
contractual agreement with the Uni
versity."
The contractor, who works at
CompWall and has a personal prac
tice, has a license under his name.
Since CompWall is the company that
the University is hiring, the Universi
ty requires that the contractor have a

license under CompWall.
Group members hope that once
the licensing requirements are met,
construction can begin.
"The administration line right
now is that as soon as [CompWall]
has its building licenses in order, the
wall can be built," Arnold said.
However, there is no official date
for completion of the wall.
"We are ready to start the project
as soon as possible," Clair said, but
"the way things are progressing, hon
estly I have no idea when it's going to
be built."
According to Murphree, the de
lays are particularly frustrating be
cause the Climbing Wall Group has
been well organized throughout the
process.

"It feels like we are having to bat
tle against the University rather than
work with it to get something we both
want. I have worked on this project
for almost three years now, and it has
been one non-student-caused delay
after another the entire time."
Michael Waldo, a senior majoring
in mechanical engineering who voted
for the climbing wall special fee, is
angry over the delays.
"Nobody who voted for it will
have a chance to use it really. It's sort
of ridiculous," Waldo said.
The approximately $25,000 allot
ted to the Climbing Wall Group has
been sitting in the Project Plant Ac
count along with matching contribu
tions from the Athletics Department
and the Provost's Office.
