## Barak unseats Netanyahu in Israeli prime minister race 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Ehud Barak, the
decorated Israeli soldier who pledged to
revive Mideast peacemaking, unseated
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
Israel's elections yesterday.
A tearlul Netanyahu conceded defeat
shortly after exit polls projected a sweeping
victory for the 57-year-old Labor Party lead
er. Netanyahu also said he would give up
leadership of Likud.
Barak's victory is likely to jumpstart
Israel's stalled negotiations with the Pales
tinians — talks that were frozen during most
of Netanyahu's three-year rule.
Yesterday's vote capped a divisive five
month campaign fraught with ethnic resent
ment. The deeply personal contest between
the former army mates seeped into a cam

paign replete with epithets like "liar" and
"thief."
But after the voting ended and exit polls
showed Barak far ahead, the 49-year-old
Netanyahu acknowledged he had lost.
"I want to congratulate Ehud Barak on
his victory in the elections," Netanyahu said.
"This is how it has to be in a democracy."
TV's Channel One had Barak ahead by
58.5 percent to 41.5 percent for Netanyahu,
while Channel Two gave Barak 57 percent
to 43 percent for Netanyahu. Both polls had
margins of error of 3 percentage points.
With 1.2 percent of the actual vote count
ed an hour after the polls closed, Barak led
by an even wider margin — 69.5 percent to
30.4 percent for Netanyahu.
The Palestinians welcomed Barak's vic

tory. "The message the Israeli people sent
out tonight was that they want to make
peace with the Palestinians and that they
want change," said Saeb Erekat. the top
Palestinian peace negotiator.
Barak — unlike Netanyahu — has not
ruled out creation of a Palestinian state in
parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He
is expected to move quickly to carry out
promised West Bank troop withdrawals.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat watched
the exit polls on TV. but did not comment.
Barak has 45 days to form a coalition and
submit it to the Knesset.
If he is able to form a stable coalition —
something that eluded Netanyahu — he will
be able to move more confidently in peace
negotiations.

Earlier yesterday, Netanyahu had
refused to believe the predictions that Barak
would win.
Stumping in the working-class Jerusalem
satellite of Beit Shemesh, Netanyahu said
people who had backed two of the dropouts.
Centrist Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai
and far-right legislator Ze'ev Binyamin
"Benny" Begin, were now voting for him.
"We see a huge wave of people coming
back home," he said. "Our branch offices
are packed."
Some 7 l ) percent of Israel's 4.29 million
eligible voters cast ballots. The paper ballots
from more than 7,(XX) polling stations were
being counted by hand, and unofficial final
results were not expected before this morn
ing.

The issue that substantially divided the
candidates — reviving the peace process —
barely rippled during the campaign.
Netanyahu, who froze peace talks with
the Palestinians in December, had said they
must fulfill a long list of demands — some
dismissed by the region's U.S. peace brokers
as unrealistic — before he would bring
Israel back to the table.
He also backed a crisscross Jewish settle
ment pattern in the West Bank that would
make Palestinian statehood virtually impos
sible.
Barak wants Israel to return to its com
mitments under the Wye River land-for
security accords brokered by President Clin
ton last October and hopes to contain settle
ment.
