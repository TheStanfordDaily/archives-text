The female faculty
numbers are not
all they seem to be

UNIVERSITY Provost Con
doleezza Rice presented her
third annual report on the
status of Stanford's women faculty
last Thursday. At surface glance, it
looked good.
But take a closer look.
The report said women faculty
had an overall higher tenure rate
than men, that 13 departments now
have female chairs and numbers
continue to rise. Seems like a rosy
picture, but it's not.
How many female faculty mem
bers will sit next year on the I Jniver
sity President's cabinet, which con
sists of the president, provost and
the deans from each of the schools?
Only one —incoming Law School
Dean Kathleen Sullivan.

And in a study done by the
administration last year, even if 100
percent of the faculty hired at cur
rent turnover rates were women, it
would be 10 years before women
constituted 4K percent of the faculty
and 38 percent of the tenured facul
ty.
Female faculty comprise only 19
percent of the faculty, which is up
from 15.8 percent live years ago.
Progress, yes. But slow progress.
The numbers aren't as peachy as
they seem. Granted, the University
is making strides at ameliorating the
situation for female faculty at Stan
ford, but the work is far from done
and it is far too soon to be counting
any chickens.
So we urge the community and
the administration to avoid compla
cency.
These numbers are a step in the
right direction but also serve as a
reminder of what we still have left to
work at.
