Student action may
be what it takes to
save Eating Clubs

A SURVEY ON the ASSIJ
Web site is soliciting student
input on the future of the
Stanford Eating Clubs, and it is a per
fect opportunity for students to impact
the future of a beloved campus institu
tion.
'ITie Eating ( luhs have been serving
students for more than a century, pro
viding an alternative to the traditional
University Dining Services meal plan
options. Since that time, particularly in
recent memory, these establishments
have become a popular mainstay of

campus life and camaraderie.
But. as part of the Capital Improve
ment Plan, the fate of the eatitfg clubsT
may be in peril because of plans to ren
ovate and restructure both Toyon Hall
and its eating facilities.
Take this opportunity, whether you
have used the eating clubs or not, to
make a difference in student life here.
Make your voice heard by showing
your opinion.
The complaint is often aired that the
University does not listen to student
input.
Here is a prime way for student
input to be made, and the administra
tors are listening.
A deluge of responses could very
well tip the balances for the Hating
('I Ã¼bs.
