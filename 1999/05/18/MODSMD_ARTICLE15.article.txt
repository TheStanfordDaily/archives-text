## The 						Starbucksization of cities 
### 
Atiba Pertilla

Every time i go
home, the place
seems a little
stranger. In my neighbor
hood, not much changes;
kids play football in the
streets while old men sit
in the park and feed the
pigeons, and the people

in the stores are mostly the same, even
though their children are starting to work
behind the counter. Downtown, however,
everything seems different: old haunts are
disappearing, big chains moving in, the
character of the city slowly draining away.
Being a New Yorker seems an increasingly
tenuous identity.
Urban areas are changing across the
country, though population shifts have
tended to focus ever-greater attention on
the suburbs, where the majority of Ameri
cans now live. While many cities have
rejected the expressway-centered approach
to development, they're still dealing with
the consequences of destroying historic
neighborhoods in the name of huge public
works projects that have mostly ended up
increasing the number of traffic jams rather
than commuter efficiency.
Now. mayors focus on luring people
back to downtown, ideally with the help of
a few good retailers. They have a vested
interest in bringing commercial tenants
back to the central districts and are offering
lucrative incentives. And the stores are
coming in droves, filling up prime real
estate with stores eager to provide every
thing we're supposed to be wanting right
now. like coffee from Starbucks or a book

from Borders.
The trouble is, as more and more cities
adopt this model of redevelopment, the
urban experience becomes disassociated
from any sense of place: walk down 57th
Street in New York or through Union
Square up in San Francisco, and you're
likely to see the same stores selling theh
same products — or. if there is variation,
it's probably the result of focus groups
revealing that Midwesterners hate spices or
that shoppers in Los Angeles prefer pastel
colors.
"Downtown" is becoming a destination
for certain pre-programmed activities: hit
ting the Hard Rock Cafe, the J. Crew, the
Disney store and then getting out as soon
as possible, rather than an opportunity for
randomness, for the discovery of a hole-in
the-wall store, for an encounter with a
stranger that might scare you or make you
think.
Even the prospect of the next big super
store opening up isn't such a big deal any
more. Once you've seen a building
wrapped in scaffolding announcing the
next incarnation of Planet Hollywood is
arriving soon, all you have to wonder about
is how they'll overcome the challenge of
the layout and which celebrity's bric-a-brac
will be found inside. The decor, the music
and the menu are already familiar; indeed,
that's exactly what retailers seem to count
on, providing a safe experience for those
just passing through that doesn't stray too
far from what they've come to expect from
the exact same places in their own home
towns.
Meanwhile, as we move to this artificial

model, local shopkeepers are losing their
livelihood. "You've Got Mail" wasn't just
an excuse to show off the Upper West Side;
it also alluded to the disappearance of
neighborhood institutions like Shakespeare
& Co. thanks to the arrival of one of Barnes
& Noble's first megastores.
Unfortunately, there will probably be no
sequel. "You've Been Duped," where the
chain store rescinds its paperback discount,
suggesting one problem of cities increasing
their dependence on and their courtship of
retailers to whom Pittsburgh and Seattle
are equally interchangeable. And when the
big stores feel the pinch of an economic
downturn, they won't hesitate to pull out,
leaving depressed central districts with
nothing but a lot of pretty facades.
A few months ago I found myself on a
hillside overlooking the city of Reno,
stunned by the view of the city by night,
streetlights suddenly interrupted by the
looming hulks of the casinos, a mound of
glittering color that seemed to have no rela
tionship to the fairly ordinary pattern
around it.
It was both alluring and sobering. While
it's easy to understand the attraction of the
glitz, offering the chance to buy everything
you need to be happy, or at least to feel
happy for a day, what we risk losing in
encouraging the standardization of our
downtowns is the personality that makes
the outlying districts, where most of us will
end up, so livable to begin with.
