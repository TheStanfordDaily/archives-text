Transfers offer different perspective
I am writing to express my dismay at the
University's decision to slash the incoming
transfer class to a quarter of its historical si/e.
While 1 understand the position of the Office
of Admissions after the higher-than-expect
ed yield of freshmen. I believe the I Jniversi
tv is doing a great disservice to both the stu
dent body as a whole and to the transfers
themselves by so drastically reducing next
year's group of transfer students.
Transfers offer a unique perspective,
which is a valuable contribution to Stanford's
diversity. They bring an understanding of life
at other colleges and can offer views with a
broader point of reference than Palo Alto
alone can provide. Often transfers have
taken non-traditional paths to arrive here,
including having a family, traveling or work
ing; their perspectives cannot be represented
by more freshmen straight from high school
who lack similar experiences. I would also
argue that transfers tend to be a very moti
vated and involved group. The experience of
having only two or three years at Stanford
makes many people especially eager to con
tribute to this school and get the most out of
their time here. Former transfers are now
veil leaders, student advisers and national
rugby champions. They conduct research
and serve as senior class co-president,
docents at Jasper Ridge, teaching assistants,
resident assitants, editors at The Daily and
much more and contribute enormously to
campus life.
Not only will Stanford lose out on the
contributions of a special segment of its
undergraduate population next year, but I

believe the experience of next year's trans
fers will be a more difficult one with such a
small group to share it with. Stanford has fos
tered a strong transfer community in the
past, and I am saddened to see it fall by the
wayside. For many students w ho missed out
on the "Stanford Freshman Experience."
meeting a core group of transfers sharing a
similar experience of being new to Stanford,
but not new to college, is the basis of lasting
friendships and a base from whieh to meet
non-transfer students. The isolation and
marginalization of such a small group of
transfers next year will only be eounterpro
ductive in the end.
I hope that the Office of Admissions does
not use logistical problems such as the cur
rent housing crunch as an excuse to withdraw
support from transfers. I would like transfers
to have the chance to enrich the future of
Stanford as much as they have enriched the
past.

Survey shows sleep-deprivation
Having been a teaching assistant for Sleep
and Dreams for the past two years, I would
like to add to the comments regarding the
study conducted by Dean of Students Marc
Wais ("Surprising findings on studying, sleep
revealed in survey," May 11).
The statement that Stanford students are
not sleep-deprived is grossly incorrect. Sur
veys conducted on 350 students in Sleep and
Dreams during winter quarter revealed that

only 3.5 percent of students are wide awake
and energetic all day long. This is a clear indi
cation that nearly all students are severely
sleep-deprived.
Objective scientific studies of subjects
aged 18 to 30 have established that the need
for sleep is on average 8 hours and 15 min
utes per night. Furthermore, it has been con
clusively demonstrated that missed sleep
accumulates as a cumulative sleep debt.
Therefore, an average of 7 hours of sleep
each night over an extended period can
result in a huge sleep debt and greatly
impaired daytime function. The effect is even
worse for the 50 percent of students who
sleep less than 7 hours each night.
The implications of these figures are enor
mous. Valuable resources are invested by the
academic community and tuition-paying par
ents into educating Stanford students. But
decreased daytime alertness resulting from
sleep deprivation implies that students are
not taking from Stanford what could be
learned in the classroom. Imagine how much
more could be gleaned from a Stanford edu
cation by fully alert and functional students!
Students in Sleep and Dreams as well as
myself can attest to the fact that getting suffi
cient sleep in college is a challenge, but the
benefits far outweigh the costs. Students
were required to complete a sleep project by
recording all sleep over a period of one
month with the goal of eliminating as much
sleep debt as possible. During this project,
students averaged 7.8 hours of sleep a night,
and those who were most successful in reduc
ing their sleep debt reported being able to
stay awake all day in class and when study
ing. having more energy when socializing

with friends, not feeling groggy in the morn
ing and being able to study more efficiently.
Sleeping enough may appear to be a sac
rifice of time that could be better spent
studying or socializing. But it comes down to
a matter of prioritizing.
By giving a higher priority to sleep, the
quality of daytime activity improves greatly.
Would you rather be a semi-functional zom
bie for 18 hours each day or a fully function
al human being for 16 hours each day? I
think the answer is clear.

Friday's article on Christianity at Stanford
("Fellowship on the Farm") failed to men

Inter Varsity serves two groups of faculty
who meet on a weekly basis. About 30 facul
ty members are actively involved in these
two groups, one of which meets every
Wednesday morning in the hospital for
physicians, and another group that meets
every Friday morning in the Faculty Club for
faculty from across the University. Almost
all areas of the University are represented
among these faculty: engineering, law,
medicine, business, economics, SLAC,
Hoover, etc. The common perception that
there are few faculty who are Christians is
simply wrong.
