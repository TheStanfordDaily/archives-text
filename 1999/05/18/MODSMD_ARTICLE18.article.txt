## Wimberly takes 7th at Pac-10s 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Though most of Stanford's track
athletes stayed home to contest the
Cardinal Qualifier, the lone com
petitor who strayed from the fold,
fifth-year senior Chase Wimberly,
was the man of the hour for the Car
dinal this weekend.
With senior decathlon stalwart
Josh Gleason sidelined by injury,
Wimberly stepped up to finish sev
enth in the Pacific 10 Conference
Multi-Event Championships this
weekend in Tempe, Ariz.
Placing third in the 4(X) meters at
49.44 seconds and scoring fourth
place finishes in the 100-meter dash
(11.29) and the pole vault (13 feet, 5
1/4 inches), Wimberly accumulated
a personal best 6,215 points.
"Chase Wimberly has paid his
dues for five years here," said Stan
ford head coach Vin Lananna. "He's
run, he's jumped, he's thrown, he's
done one event after the other, and
it's been great to have him in a posi
tion where we were able to send him
to the Pac-lOs and he was able to
capitalize on it."
The two team points Wimberly
garnered with his efforts will count
toward Stanford's team total when
the team contests the Pac-1() Cham
pionships in Tempe this weekend.
"Any [team] points Chase scores
are just great," Lananna said. "It's
actually really exciting for me to see
him capitalize on that opportunity."
Wimberly's teammates back
home were no slouches, either. A
number of Stanford athletes were
able to use the Stanford-hosted Car
dinal Qualifier as a tune-up for Pac
lOs.
The most impressive mark of the
day went to senior Jeff Allen, who
bettered his NCAA provisional
qualifying mark in the 4(X) hurdles to
51.26 despite having lost a step by

stumbling over the l()th hurdle.
"Jeff is going to run faster, there's
no question about it."
Allen's mark moves him to 26th
on the NCAA list going into the Pac
-10 meet.
Qther top marks on the day went
to sophomores Ryan Carroll, whose
1:49.49 was good enough for fourth
overall, and Mark Ganek, who con
tinued his string of strong hammer
performances with a 203-10 hurling
for second place.
Sophomore Todd Beyerlein was
first in the high jump at 6-9 3/4. and
Leroy Simms capitalized on a swift
tailwind to run 10.81 in the 100 me
ters and 22.18 in the 2(X), both third
place efforts.
Stanford's fearsome foursome of
redshirting middle-distance runners
continued to impress, a positive sign
for the future of Cardinal track.
Freshman Jonathan Stevens bolt
ed to a 1:51.53 win in his heat of the
NOO meters, while junior Michael
Stember and sophomores Jonathon
Riley and Gabe Jennings scored sec
ond through fourth place finishes in
the 1,500 behind Washington State's
Bernard Lagat.
After setting a torrid pace that
took the pack through SIX) meters in
1:58. Lagat broke for the pole with
300 meters to go. The Stanford trio,
running unattached, went right with
Lagat, but the Kenyan's kick was too
much.
Stember was closest to Lagat's
3:39.79 automatic qualifier at
3:41.98, while Riley (3:42.01) and
Jennings (3:43.00) were close be
hind.
Lananna was pleased with the
progress he has seen during this
learning year for the crew and him
self alike.
"I think we've learned a lot this
year, myself included. We've learned
a lot about what we can do in pushing
the envelope," Lananna said.
