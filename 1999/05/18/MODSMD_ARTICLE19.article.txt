# Stanford enters Pac-10s with an early lead from senior's win
## Lawyer three-peats in the heptathalon 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
Tracye Lawyer was on a mis-

sion to do what no woman had
ever done before — win three
straight Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in the heptathlon.

Simply put: mission accom
plished.
Not only did the senior become
the first woman ever to complete a
three-peat, but she did it with rela
tively ease, outscoring her nearest
opponent by 134 points.
Lawyer's victory was fueled by
a tremendous first day on Friday.
Setting the Sun Devil Stadium
first-day scoring record, she set
personal bests in both the 1(H)-
meter hurdles (13..56 seconds) and
the 2(H) meters (23.51 seconds).
Her hurdles time tied current
freshman Robvn Woolfolk's
school record.
"The first day has all of my re
ally strong events," Lawyer said.
"It was just a good start to the
weekend — the hurdles especially.
Getting a (personal record) in the
hurdles was a spark for the rest of
the events on the first day."
After winning the high jump,
the shot put and the hurdles and
placing second in the 200,
Lawyer's score of 3.740 gave her
thoughts of breaking her record
score of 5.809 set at last year's Pae
-10 meet. Unfortunately, a less
than spectacular king jump to start
off Saturday's competition dashed
those hopes.

It was just a good start to
the weekend—the hurd
dies especially.'

"I was hoping It) score high
5,900, even get close to 6.000. but it
seemed that when I didn't jump
very well in the long jump — that
kind of squashed my hopes of get
ting 6.0(H)," Lawyer said. "So after
the long jump 1 was just going for
the win in the meet."
Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna was not surprised with
the victory.
"It appears that she's ready to
go to the NC'AAs," Lananna said.
"She'll also have another good sit
uation in turns of regular open

events at the Pac- 10s next week."
Lawyer is likely to compete in
the high jump, the 200 and the 1(H)
hurdles, as well as the 4(H)-meter
relay next weekend. Last year, she
scored in all four events.
While Lawyer was busy making
history in Arizona. Stanford
played host to the C ardinal Quali
fier on Saturday. The meet served
as last chance for athletes to hit

qualifying stan
dards for the
post season.
Tops among
Stanford's
women was
Mary Cobb,
who finished
third in the
1,500-meters in

a provisional qualifying time of
4:20.5. While Cobb had hoped to
dip under the 4:IS automatic stan
dard. she ran a solid race, losing to
Becky Spies of New Balance
(4:15.3) and Li/. Cotter of the
Farm Team running club, who
passed Cobb in the final 200 me
ters to finish in 4:20.1.
"I was happy with it," Cobb
said. "1 thought we were actually
going faster — 4:20 was a little bit
of a surprise — but I felt really
good so I'm exactly where I want
to be."
"I think Mary looks really well
positioned and poised to do well."
I .ananna said. "She's really turned
her season around. I think that
she's in a great position to come
around this year. I'm thrilled. I
think she's going to run very well
at the end of the year."
Other standouts for the Cardi
nal were Summer Pierson, win
ning the discus. Melissa Feinstein,
takingsecond in the pole vault and
Mary Huang, placing fifth in the
10.0(H) meters. All three athletes
hit NCAA provisional qualifying
marks.
"We accomplished our objec
tive of either resting our athletes
or tuning them up for the Pac
-10s," Lananna said.
