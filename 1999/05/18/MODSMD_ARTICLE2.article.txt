## Students launch a Web portal of their own 
### Alice Lah Contributing writer 
Stanford students are previewing a home-grown
Web site that hopes to capture the college market.
Founder Travis Bowie, co-founder Dylan Vaughn
and partner Peter Morrow of the recently launched
Web site http://www.eollege4ll .com are already nego
tiating with venture capital firms for first rounds of
funding for their product.
The site. college4ll. caters to students, offering
everything from job and internship information to
chat rooms and links to pages on travel, shopping and
investing.

The site gathers information that many college stu
dents will 112 ind useful, such as movie times and materi
al on health and fitness.
The idea for the product was initially conceived by
Bowie last summer. Working with Vaughn. Bowie's
idea gradually took shape throughout the following
months. From September of last year, the two of them
joined forces with other Stanford students to construct
the portal.
"We felt like there was a big lack of student portals,
so we decided to design one." Howie explained.
1 le describes the portal as "a Web site that gives the
student access to anything he or she could possibly
want. It provides the answer to any question."
The site was launched at Stanford last Wednesday.
According to Bowie, several thousand Stanford stu
dents have visited the site.
Currently composed of 10 members, the collegc4ll
team includes seniors Bowie, Vaughn, Nathaniel
Boswell. Georgina Clark and Andres Romero: juniors

Sundeep Ahuja, Aaron Bell, Lawrence Gentilello and
Peter Morrow and law student Alex Gould.
The team hopes for a "full national launch this up
coming fall to all college students," said Vaughn, a
symbolic systems major.
The team hopes to take the product to every uni
versity as early as this August.
Vaughn said "the timing couldn't have been bet
ter." He and Bowie, who will both be graduating this
June, will set up office this summer with Morrow to
continue developing the product. Morrow has stopped
out to work on the site.
Several of the team members plan to work full-time
in the office, which will be located in either Palo Alto
or San Francisco.
"We really hope to build this incredible business.
No one has created this type of product before," com
ments Bowie.
Vaughn optimistically noted: "We've come far. but
we still have a way to go before the final product."
