there were actually 20 teams). The varsity women
clinched second place in the petite final, which is
composed of the seventh- through 12th-place
teams. Both teams were proud of their finish and
performances in the final race.
"We had a solid race. It was our fastest and
showed the great progress we have made. The en
tire field is getting better. We showed great
progress compared to last year's times, junior

■ Saturday-Sunday: MEN — 4th place at the Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championships in Sacramento,
Calif.
WOMEN — Bth place at the Pac-10 Conference
Championships in Sacramento, Calif.

The men advanced to the grand final with ease
after finishing second to Washington in the morn
ing heat. Due to the wide gap between the Cardi
nal and the third-place team, Stanford was able to
slow down its stroke rate for the final l M) meters to
conserve energy for the afternoon.

The top three finishers of the grand finals, C ali
fornia, Washington and Oregon State, were ex
pected to dominate considering their times sur
passed those of the other teams in the field. But one
could not predict the overwhelming improvement
of the Stanford men in the final race. I hey crossed
the finish line one boat length, 3.5 seconds, behind
OSU. The Cardinal cut the gap in time with OSI I
in half by sprinting with 7(H) meters left.
The varsity women were equally happy with
their final race. Senior Vainly Johnson described
the seniors sentiment as. "an excellent race for us to
go out on."
