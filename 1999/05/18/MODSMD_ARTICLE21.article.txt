Alter clinching the I'ac-lt) title
and the accompanying automatic
bid to the NCAA Tournament.
No. 4 Stanford received a strong
hint yesterday that when tourna
ment pairings come out next Mon
day, it will receive home-field ad
vantage
The NCAA's Division 1 base
ball committee announced yester
day afternoon that Sunken Dia
mond was chosen as one of the 16
sites that will host four-team re
gionals Friday, May 2K through
Sunday, May 30.
USC's Dedeaux Field was the
only other Pac-1() stadium to be se
lected. Actually, it was the only
other field west of Texas to be
tapped for the tournament, a fact
that could bode ill for the Cardinal.

'What we want ultimately is
to have a tournament where
we have the eight best
teams in Omaha.'

"When you host a regional in
the West, you know they're going
to give you a couple of good West
Coast teams," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said. "They're
going to want to keep Long Beach
here, they're going to want to keep
[No. 12] Pepperdine here, they're
going to want to keep [No. 24
Nevada] here. So. both I JSC and
Stanford are going to have a top
California team in here."
According to Baseball Ameri

overall) also submitted a bid to
host a regional, but was turned
down, possibly because the team
does not have a strong enough con
ference record. In fact, some won
der whether the Sun Devils, whose
overall record is inflated by a bevy
of wins over weak nonconference
opponents, will make the tourna
ment at all.
"I can honestly say there were
two or three schools that came in
with astronomical bids, but the
sites were not picked for financial
reasons." committee chairman
Dick Rockwell was quoted as say
ing. "Those teams were maybe
fifth or sixth in their conference.
We set as criteria we didn't want
the fifth-place team in a confer
ence to necessarily be the team
that's hosting.
"What we want ultimately is to
have a tournament where we have
the eight best teams in Omaha [for
the College World Series]."
To better accomplish that, the
NCAA committee will not only
place each of the 64 teams in a re
gional next Monday, but will also
seed within those regionals.
For example, the 16 best teams
will each receive a No. I seed. Of
those 16. the eight teams which the
committee believes have the best
chance to make it to the College
World Series in Omaha will be
deemed "National Seeds."
No national seed can play an
other until at least the Super Re
gional. Similarly, no team can face
another from the same conference
until the Super Regional and no
