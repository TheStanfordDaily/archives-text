# Baseball to host NCAA Regionals
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Alter clinching the I'ac-lt) title
and the accompanying automatic
bid to the NCAA Tournament.
No. 4 Stanford received a strong
hint yesterday that when tourna
ment pairings come out next Mon
day, it will receive home-field ad
vantage
The NCAA's Division 1 base
ball committee announced yester
day afternoon that Sunken Dia
mond was chosen as one of the 16
sites that will host four-team re
gionals Friday, May 2K through
Sunday, May 30.
USC's Dedeaux Field was the
only other Pac-1() stadium to be se
lected. Actually, it was the only
other field west of Texas to be
tapped for the tournament, a fact
that could bode ill for the Cardinal.

'What we want ultimately is
to have a tournament where
we have the eight best
teams in Omaha.'

"When you host a regional in
the West, you know they're going
to give you a couple of good West
Coast teams," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said. "They're
going to want to keep Long Beach
here, they're going to want to keep
[No. 12] Pepperdine here, they're
going to want to keep [No. 24
Nevada] here. So. both I JSC and
Stanford are going to have a top
California team in here."
According to Baseball Ameri

ca, Arizona Slate (39-21, 12-12
overall) also submitted a bid to
host a regional, but was turned
down, possibly because the team
does not have a strong enough con
ference record. In fact, some won
der whether the Sun Devils, whose
overall record is inflated by a bevy
of wins over weak nonconference
opponents, will make the tourna
ment at all.
"I can honestly say there were
two or three schools that came in
with astronomical bids, but the
sites were not picked for financial
reasons." committee chairman
Dick Rockwell was quoted as say
ing. "Those teams were maybe
fifth or sixth in their conference.
We set as criteria we didn't want
the fifth-place team in a confer
ence to necessarily be the team
that's hosting.
"What we want ultimately is to
have a tournament where we have
the eight best teams in Omaha [for
the College World Series]."
To better accomplish that, the
NCAA committee will not only
place each of the 64 teams in a re
gional next Monday, but will also
seed within those regionals.
For example, the 16 best teams
will each receive a No. I seed. Of
those 16. the eight teams which the
committee believes have the best
chance to make it to the College
World Series in Omaha will be
deemed "National Seeds."
No national seed can play an
other until at least the Super Re
gional. Similarly, no team can face
another from the same conference
until the Super Regional and no
top-seeded team can take on an
other top-ranked team from the
same conference until the College
World Series.
This will be the eighth regional
hosted by Stanford and the fourth
in a row. However, this will be the
first year the stadium will be play
ing host to four teams instead of
six.
In fact, this is the first year any
one will be hosting only four teams
because this is the first year the
NCAA has implemented its new
tournament structure, expanding
from 4N to 64 teams.
In years past, the NCAAs fea
tured eight six-team regionals and
the eight regional winners pro
ceeded to the College World Series
in Omaha. This year, the 16 region
al winners proceed to two-team
Super Regionals June 4-6. Then,
the eight teams that survive the
two-out-of-three series move on to

Rosenblatt Stadium to play for the
NCAA championship.
Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn,
Baylor, Florida State, Houston,
LSU, Miami, Notre Dame, Ohio
State, Texas A&M, Texas Tech.
Wake Forest and Wichita State
will also host the first-round re
gionals.
Notes
Stanford junior first baseman
John Gall was named the Pac-1()
Flayer of the Week after his stand
out play in last weekend's confer
ence-championship-clinching se
ries against UCLA. Gall batted 9-
for-12 to raise his average to .332.
He also belted three home runs
and two doubles and notched 12
RBIs and nine runs scored.
Junior catcher Damien Alvara
do earned the honor in March and
sophomore Jason Young (who
won it three times in February and
March), freshman Brian Sager and
sophomore Justin Wayne have all
been named Pac-10 Pitcher of the
Week.
