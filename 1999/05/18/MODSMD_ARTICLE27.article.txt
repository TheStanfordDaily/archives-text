# Stanford targeted for unusually exceptional athletes in an unusual sport
## U.S. Bobsledding hits campus, looking for new recruits 
### 
Sure, this university is littered with
future professional athletes, na
tional team members of one brand or
another and dozens of present and
potential Olympic athletes. But let's
be realistic — the closest you're going
to come to the Olympic medal podi
um is skiing at Squaw Valley.
I Jnless, of course, you're free this
Saturday.
I he U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton
Federation is holding tryouts this
weekend at Stanford Stadium, and
they're not messing around. The
offer is simple: if you've got the ath
letic ability, you've got a decent shot
at heading into Salt Lake City in four
years as an C Mympian.
These guys, mind you. are not
looking for Joe Pickup Basketball.
They're not big on free throw shoot
ing or turning a double play in kick
ball. They're looking for uncommon
athletes: men with 4.6 second4oyard
sprints and 26-inch verticals and
women with 13.7 second 1(H) times
and 24-inch verticals.
But come in with that, and they'll
give you something that many rich
and foolish people would pay thou
sands of dollars for: the opportunity
to hurtle down a frozen, rock-hard
track in a slim metal contraption that
looks ready to crumple instantly.
Alternatively, if'you're really nuts,
you could get in on the ground floor
of an emerging winter sport, the
skeleton, which is a lot like the luge,
except headfirst. You think those
ESPN X-Ciames street luge guys are
tough? Try it when you can stare your
own oncoming death in the face.
And you could be one of those
madmen or — women. Sounds like
fun. eh'.'
Bonny Warner, class of '83 and
three-time Olympian luger herself,
said. " The thing about bobsled is that
if you're really strong and really fast,
you can make the national team in
your first year."
The national team, to put it blunt

ly, is looking for horsepower. The se
lection process being run this week
end is looking primarily for push ath
letes — the men and women that give
the bobsled its initial momentum
with a few seconds of massive exer
tion at the top of the track.

In particular, the women's bob
sled team is desperately thin and ac
tively looking to recruit new athletes.
Women's bobsledding isn't an
Olympic sport yet. but it will almost
certainly be announced as one for the
2002 Games in Salt Lake City; the
U.S. Olympic Committee is so cer
tain of the selection, it's already fund
ing the women's national team. "The
opportunities for women are enor
mous," Warner said.
Warner knows. She submitted an
application to be a torchbearer in the
1980 Olympics in Lake Placid and
ended up sliding for her country.
Applying to colleges in 1979,
Warner fired off "a college-type
essay" to apply for the torchbearer
position from California. She was se
lected, and stopped out of Stanford
her freshman winter to attend the
Games.
"Spring quarter doesn't start until
April, but the Olympic Games ended
in February in 1980, so I had two
months and nothing to do, and no
money to do it with," Warner said.
One of her fellow torchbearers, a
bobsledder, showed her the bobsled
and luge facilities, including a nearby
luge camp. The camp, with a mere
$80 fee, caught her eye. i said, i can
afford that,"' Warner said.

The luge would end up costing her
more than $80 but more than payed
for itself in experience. Warner
ended up spending seven years at
Stanford, stopping out each winter to
train and compete. Her intended civil
engineering degree became commu
nications, since Physics 51, then a re
quired civil engineering course, was
taught only in the winter.
Juggling her training with school,
a Stanford athletic career including
four years spent on the field hockey
team and, after graduation, a job re
porting for a Bay Area television sta
tion. Warner managed to win berths
on the 1984, 1988 and 1992 U.S. luge
teams. Her best finish was sixth, in
Calgary in 1988.
Currently a 727 pilot for United,
Warner's now eyeing another shot at
Olympic glory, this time as a driver
for the bobsled team, one of the
women that "steer" the weight of the
sled as it hurtles down the track by
precisely guiding the team in leans
and weight shifts.
"I'm hopeful," Warner said, "al
though at 37, I'm pushing it. Whether
or not I can make the Olympic team
as a driver, I don't know, but I can re
ally help recruit people."
Warner says Stanford athletes are
exactly the type of people that fit the
bobsledder mold. "A lot of people
getting out of college want to travel
around Europe, and wouldn't you
rather do that on someone else's dol
lar?" she said.
So consider the gauntlet thrown
down, all of you who said, "I'll never
be an Olympian." The bobsledders
are daring you to come out and show
your stuff. If you think you've got it,
here's your chance to do something
insane and nearly suicidal — for your
country. Have you got what it takes?
If you 're interested in attending the try
outs, spots tire limited, so call (925)
634-9269 as soon as possible to regis
ter. You know Jeff will.
