# Soph College flooded with '99 applications
## Too many frosh, too few spots 
### Nina Cassidy Contributing writer 
For the fourth year in a row. high demand for one of
Stanford s most successful introductory programs has
outpaced the increased resources allocated to it.
According to Angel Dodson. an administrative as
sociate in the Freshman / Sophomore Program Office,
2.076 applications were submitted for 432 spots in next
year's Sophomore College.
Both Dodson and Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldivar said they believe that the
increasing demand is a result of student satisfaction
with the program.
"Why is there demand for the college? Because it
works." Saldivar said. "From the very first year. Sopho
more College has been a success, because it taps into
what's important in undergraduate education."
The college is a program for sophomores and is a
part ol the University's increased emphasis on under
graduate education, especially during the first two
years of college life. It is intended to increase interac
tion between faculty and students and ease the transi
tion into what many consider the most difficult vear in

a student's college career.
Participants arrive two weeks he
fore the start of fall quarter and at
tend morning seminars with distin
guished faculty. In the afternoons
students attend workshops inform
ing them of academic, career and re
search opportunities available to
them.
Students are allowed to apply for
up to three courses but can only par
ticipate in one. This means that al
though more than 2,(XJ() applica
tions were received, anywhere be
tween 700 and the entire sopho
more class of 1,650 different stu
dents applied.
Last year some 1,7(X) applica
tions were received for approxi
mately 320 spots. That was almost a
100 percent increase from 1997,
when 558 students submitted 1,060
applications for about 300 spots. In

1996, the program's first year, some
350 students submitted 6<X) applica
tions.
In response to increased de
mand, program officials have re
cruited faculty to lead classes in an
expanded number of courses and
disciplines.
In January University officials
announced that the Sophomore
College course offerings had been
expanded from 27 to 35 courses, and
enrollment would also increase
from 320 to 420 students, allowing
up to 100 more students to partic
ipate.
At that time administrators were
hoping that the increase in enroll
ment would allow the majority of
sophomores who wanted to partic
ipate an opportunity to do so.
Nevertheless, despite the 25 per
cent increase in the number of slots
available in the college, more than
250 students will be denied any of
the coveted spots.
Some students wanted to partic

ipate because a particular class
grabbed their attention.
"I didn't get the chance to partic
ipate in any of the freshman semi
nars," freshman Kateri McÃŸae said.
"For me, the opportunity to interact
on a more personal level with one of
my favorite professors was too great
to pass up."
For others, it was the setting and
the environment of the college itself
that enticed them.
"The opportunity to concentrate
on one subject without having to
worry about grades, other classes or
other assignments, was what at
tracted me," freshman Anneke Post
said. "I really liked the idea of a
small noncompetitive structure."
But for all the students who par
ticipate there is a genuine commit
ment to and passion for the pro
gram.
"Sophomore College is a defining
moment lor those who participate,"
Saldivar said. "It can serve as a model
for undergraduate education."
