# Athletes, children come together to play sports
## Youth come to Farm for Olympics 
### Julie Tinker 
Smiles, sports and fun are the perfect words
to describe this year's Youth Olympics, held
this past weekend at Arrillaga Family Sports
Center. The event brought local schoolchildren
and Stanford athletes together for a day of ac
tivities.
Students from elementary schools in the
Ravenswood School District were invited to
participate in the annual event, which was or
ganized by the Captain's Council. The council
consists of varsity athletes, primarily captains,
who serve as a liaison between athletes and the
athletic department. Fifty Stanford athletes
volunteered their time for the event.
"I appreciate the outreach. The matter of
the University reaching out in to the communi
ty is important, and these athletes do a great
job," said Deon Price, a father of one of the kids
at the event.
Menlo Oaks, Beechwood, Robert McNair
and Cesar Chavez elementary schools of East
Palo Alto attended. The kids circled through
seven different sports stations and were provid
ed with lunch and T-shirts. The Amdahl Cor
poration. which supports Robert McNair Ele
mentary School, donates money to the Athlet
ics Department for community service, and a
portion of that money funded the event.
"It's the Amdahl connection with the school
that helps keep this going." said senior Lindsay
Tam, a water polo player and coordinator of
the Youth Olympics. Nike has also sponsored
the event in the past, but pulled out this year.
Despite the decrease in funding, the Stanford
athletes try to keep the yearly event going.

The kids arrived bright and early Sunday
morning and engaged in a variety of games and
activities until early afternoon. This year's
sports included basketball, football, gymnas
tics, soccer, swimming, track and field and vol
leyball. At most of the sports' stations kids
scrimmaged or learned a few basic skills from
Stanford athletes.
"1 learned how to do all different kinds of
sports. It's pretty fun." said Aerius Franklin, a
fourth grader from Robert McNair.
Track and football both included a mini ob
stacle course at their stations and kids played
dribble relays and shooting games at the bas
ketball station. Swimming was a free-for-all,
with sounds of laughter and splashing echoing
out of the stadium.
Tam said the day was successful and that it
was rewarding to see a month of planning pay
oft. "It's neat. The athletes are really sort of an
inspiration to the kids." Tam added that this
year was exceptional. "Everyone wanted to do
it. None of the athletes volunteering felt they
had to be there. They were there because they
wanted to be."
Parents and some staff from the school
shared the athletes' enthusiasm. Prisci Ila
Hamilton, a teaching assistant at Beeclnvood.
said, "This is my third year out. and each year it
gets better. A lot of the kids who don't usually
play sports get the opportunity, and they are re
ally inspired by the Stanford athletes."
But the success of the event may have been
most visible on the smiling faces of all the kids.
Marcus Williams, a fifth grader, said. "I have
been coming to this since third grade. I love it.
Stanford rocks!"
