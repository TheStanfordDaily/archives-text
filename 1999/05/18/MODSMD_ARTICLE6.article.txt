From the halls of Montezuma to the
shores 0f... Roble Field?
At approximately 6:40 p.m. yesterday, a
Marine helicopter landed on Rohle Field.
The landing was part of training exercises
done at a base in Monterey to prepare
Marines in case of medical emergencies.
"1 was in my dorm room in Schiff when I
heard a loud noise. 1 went to my window

and saw the helicopter turning. My first re
action was that it was literally going to crash
into Lagunita." sophomore David
Goehring said.
Goehring ran out of his dormitory to
join the crowd of about 1(H) people that as
sembled around the field. Swimmers left
Roble Pool and were standing in towels to
watch, as were students from a Statistics
section that had been meeting in Lagunita.
Stanford Police were waiting on the field.
After the landing, two Marines stepped

onto the field, patted each other on the back
and climbed back into the chopper.
According to Police Sgt. Tim Schnei
der. the Stanford Police had been in
formed an hour earlier that the Marines
were coming. He said this was not the first
time that the Marines had used the field.
Roble Field is a designated helicopter
alternate landing zone in Santa Clara
County. "We rarely ever use Roble Field,"
