For now, I'll snorkel 1200 miles of coral reef. Hike aTasmanian trail. Or, maybe I'll hang in a
Melbourne pub with some cruisy Aussies Then again, I could balloon over the Red Centre. Australia
is the land of the free; free to do whatever I choose. Aussie Escape Packages including air, coach pass
and extras start as low as $999: As for Europe, maybe I'll mellow some day.
