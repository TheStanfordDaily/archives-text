I love him
so much. I wonder
if he's going to pop
the big question before
we go home for the
V summer? Sigh.
I wonder if
Shurgard still has
some space left on that

To her: We haven't a clue.
To Mm: Yes, there's tons of space left.
Either bring your stuff to Shurgard, or call for
Shurgard's Storage To Go. That's our insanely handy new service
where we bring a storage container to your place, let you pack it up
and then we come fetch and store it for the summer. There.
Now one of life's really big questions has been answered.
