Dear Colleagues,
The advisory committee for a new Dean of the School of Engineering has been
formed and plans to work expeditiously. As a first and important step in the search
process, we seek the counsel of Stanford faculty, staff and students.
Which tenured member or members of the Stanford faculty do you propose for
consideration as the next Dean? What reasons do you list for suggesting the con
sideration of this person? Special thought needs to be given to potential candidates
who are women or members of ethnic minority groups.
Please send your written responses, before June 1, via email to
soe-dean@stanford.edu. If you prefer, you may fax your nomination to 725-7340,
or send mail to Building 310, Mail Code 2060. All communications will be kept
strictly confidential.
Thank you for your help and for sending your response within the next two
weeks.
Sincerely,
Gerhard Casper
