# Rinc-a-Delt addressing violence in schools
## 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
Rinc-a-Delt. the annual concert planned by the all
freshman Wilbur dormitory Rinconada, hits campus
this Saturday with a new twist.
This year's event, to be held on Wilbur Field at noon,
will be a school violence awareness concert and carni
val. promising good music, free admission, and a fun.
picnic-like atmosphere for the whole campus.
The novelty of this year's event will be held to "in
crease awareness of school violence" in light of the re
cent tragedy in Littleton. Colo, according to Rinc-A-
Delt planner freshman Brad Wolfe.
The level of success and the format of the event have
fluctuated wildly since it began 22 years ago. At its in
ception it was a free party intended to show students
that an all-freshman dormitory could throw as grand a
party as any fraternity.
Within the last decade Rinc-A-Delt has at times
charged for tickets, been held as a charity benefit and
gained recognition for featuring huge bands before they
were huge. Past performers include Phish, They Might
Be Giants, The Samples and The Red Hot Chili Pep
pers.
"We've drafted a letter explaining the significance of
Rinc-A-Delt and identifying problems that we see as
contributing to school violence," he said.
The letter will be addressed to Attorney General
Janet Reno, California Senators Barbara Boxer and Di
anne Feinstein. President Clinton and all 2(XX) presi
dential candidates.
It states that "the problem of school violence is
twofold. For one. there needs to be more anti-violence
education in the schools largely in the form of mentor
ing programs. And two, the government is not involved
enough. There needs to be closer government interac
tion with schools. They should send representatives and
see what kids have to say about school violence."
The organizers will set up a booth where people will
be able to add their signatures to the letter and also
make donations to the United Way Community Heal
ing Fund in Littleton.
"It's a good cause, so all the bands have agreed to
play for free, and they will be allowing people to get on
stage in the middle of their sets and read poetry or make
any comments they have about school violence," Wolfe
said.
These bands include hardcore alternative group
Seven; Stroke 9. which has been hailed as the next Third
Eve Blind; "fuzz pop" group Vegas di Milo; student
band The Locals, which describes its music as "poetry
rock" and features Wolfe on guitar and vocals; and Ele
mental, another student group that plays live old-school
rap.
"Stroke 9 is our headlincr." said Rinc-A-Delt
fundraiser freshman kiistv Harri
son.
" I hey're very up-and-coming,
they're signed to a huge Universal
Records contract, they're represent
ed by Bill Ciraham Presents, and
they were featured on the Md I V
soundtrack, so hopefully they'll con
tinue the tradition of breaking big
bands at Rinc-A-Delt."
Harrison addressed criticisms
that the quality of the music at Rinc-
A-Delt has devolved over time, sav
ing that "when Phish and They
Might Be (iiants played Rinc-A-
Delt. they weren't big. They were
cheap and thev played for the pub

licity. Now when people look back,
especially Rinc residents, they ex
pect Rinc-A-Delt to attract acts as
big as Phish is now."
What has made Rinc-A-Delt
such a unique success in the past is
that it has been able to identify up
and-coming bunds that make it big
shortly after their Rinc-A-Delt ap
pearances.
"All the bands hosted by Rinc-A-
Delt have been either local bands or
up-and-coming bands." Harrison
said.
"Some of them made it and some
of them didn't. Just like people say.
Wow. you guys had Phish at Rinc-
A-Delt,' hopefully someday people
will say. Wow. you guys had Stroke
at Rinc-A-I )elt.
Both Wolfe and Harrison were

quick to point out that the bands are
only half of Rinc-A-Delt. There will
also he a carnival with an Astro-
Jump and a Slip-N-Slide.
They also both emphasized the
incredible amount of time and ener
gy that Rinconada residents put into
planning and raising funds for this
event.
"Planning a concert is a big deal."
Wolfe said. "The bands expect lots
of people to be there, but it's hard to
sell bands that haven't yet estab
lished themselves in the minds of
students."
Wolfe said Rinconada residents
have raised more than $6.(K)() for the
concert.
I hev have moved mats for the
gymnastics team, sold roses for
Valentines Day. solicited donations

from other dormitories and local
businesses and held a variety of
other fund raisers throughout the
year.
"Businesses were weary of deal
ing with us because of Rinc- A-Delt's
past reputation," Harrison said. "In
the past few years, fewer people
have come than organizers said, so
businesses that advertised or donat
ed felt lied to and sort of cheated be
cause they didn't get the kind of ex
posure they were promised."
However, organizers are hopeful
about this year's turnout due to the
recent swell of nice weather, a $2,5(X)
sound system that will announce the
concert to much of the campus and
their campus-wide advertising ef
forts, which have included posters,
flyers and spots on KZSLJ.
