Rinc-a-Delt. the annual concert planned by the all
freshman Wilbur dormitory Rinconada, hits campus
this Saturday with a new twist.
This year's event, to be held on Wilbur Field at noon,
will be a school violence awareness concert and carni
val. promising good music, free admission, and a fun.
picnic-like atmosphere for the whole campus.
The novelty of this year's event will be held to "in
crease awareness of school violence" in light of the re
cent tragedy in Littleton. Colo, according to Rinc-A-
Delt planner freshman Brad Wolfe.
The level of success and the format of the event have
fluctuated wildly since it began 22 years ago. At its in
ception it was a free party intended to show students
that an all-freshman dormitory could throw as grand a
party as any fraternity.
Within the last decade Rinc-A-Delt has at times
charged for tickets, been held as a charity benefit and
gained recognition for featuring huge bands before they
were huge. Past performers include Phish, They Might
Be Giants, The Samples and The Red Hot Chili Pep
pers.
"We've drafted a letter explaining the significance of
Rinc-A-Delt and identifying problems that we see as
contributing to school violence," he said.
The letter will be addressed to Attorney General
Janet Reno, California Senators Barbara Boxer and Di
anne Feinstein. President Clinton and all 2(XX) presi
dential candidates.
It states that "the problem of school violence is
twofold. For one. there needs to be more anti-violence
education in the schools largely in the form of mentor
ing programs. And two, the government is not involved
enough. There needs to be closer government interac
tion with schools. They should send representatives and
see what kids have to say about school violence."
The organizers will set up a booth where people will
be able to add their signatures to the letter and also
make donations to the United Way Community Heal
ing Fund in Littleton.
"It's a good cause, so all the bands have agreed to
play for free, and they will be allowing people to get on
stage in the middle of their sets and read poetry or make
any comments they have about school violence," Wolfe
said.
These bands include hardcore alternative group
Seven; Stroke 9. which has been hailed as the next Third
Eve Blind; "fuzz pop" group Vegas di Milo; student
band The Locals, which describes its music as "poetry
rock" and features Wolfe on guitar and vocals; and Ele
mental, another student group that plays live old-school
rap.
"Stroke 9 is our headlincr." said Rinc-A-Delt
