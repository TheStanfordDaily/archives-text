BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AF)
Proclaiming moral victory, a
senior Yugoslav official said yester
day that Belgrade is ready to "cut a
deal" on Kosovo despite unspecified
"reservations" about the formula
put forward by the United States and
its major European partners.
Two Serb prisoners of war
released by the I Jnited States, mean
while. were handed back to
Yugoslavia in drizzling weather at a
Hungarian border post.
U.S. officials said the return was
not a payback for Belgrade's release
of three captured American soldiers

this month but done in the hope that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo
sevic would swiftly release any
NATO forces taken prisoner in the
future.
At NATO headquarters in Brus
sels, Belgium, the alliance accused
Serb forces of trying to cover up evi
dence of massacres of ethnic Albani
ans in Kosovo by ordering villagers
to dig up mass graves and bury the
bodies separately. David Scheffer, a
U.S. ambassador-at-large for war
crimes, also said there is increasing
evidence that Serbs have used ethnic
Albanians during the conflict as

human shields.
In Belgrade, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic said his
country was ready for a deal to end
the nearly 2-month-old NATO cam
paign as long as its "territorial
integrity" is preserved — meaning
no independence for Kosovo, a
province of Yugoslavia's Serb
republic.
But Vujovic did not explicitly say
Belgrade was ready to allow an
armed military force that would
include NATO troops to enter the
country to police the deal — a key
stumbling block to any agreement.
