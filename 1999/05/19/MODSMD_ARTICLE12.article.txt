A true 'Star Wars' fanatic
discovers the dark side
of hype-related burnout

WIIFN "RETURN OF the
Jedi" came to the McMin
nville Tri-C'inemas in 1983,
I saw it opening night. And the next
night. And the three after that.
For live nights, the routine was
the same. Nathan Ciarrettson's dad
would drive us to Sprouse-Ritz, a
dinky drugstore just down the high
way from the theater, where we
would each buy a pack of "Star
Wars" trading cards. Then we'd go to
the movie and plop down $2.50 each
for seats. Afterward, we'd go hack to
one of our houses and play with the
cards and our action figures until his
dad came bv again to take him home
for bed.
We didn't think about it much
then, but I truly believe that at the
time we were the biggest "Star
Wars" fans in our small Oregon
town.
Sixteen years later, George Lucas
is finally releasing a new "Star Wars"
episode. As the movie hits theaters
today, 1 find myself in an awkward
position. No less a fan now than
when I was 5 years old, I neverthe
less won't be seeing the show
tonight.
Not that 1 didn't try to get tickets.
I jlist didn't try very hard. Some
where between the release of the
second preview trailer and the time
last week when tickets for opening
day went on sale. I lost the motiva
tion to sleep out or work the phone
lines and the Internet to buy seats.
I shocked my parents this week
end by telling them I'd probably wait
a few days to see the film. What's
happened, they asked? Aren't you
the same kid who wore out three toy
lightsabers, whose first crush was on
Princess Leia, whose prized posses

sioti was once a certificate from the
bottom of an LJnderoos box (signed
by Yoda) that proclaimed "Jimmy
Tankersley is an honorary Jedi
Knight"?
Yes, I said. Even two years ago,
when Lucas re-released the original
"Star Wars" with updated special
effects and a few new scenes, I lined
up on opening night. I still miss my
Han Solo action figures. I look at the
certificate every time I'm home, just
to make sure Yoda's signature hasn't
faded.
But at Stanford, I explained to
them, that's nothing to brag about.
As "Star Wars" fanatics go on the
Farm, I'm about in the middle of the
pack.
There are guys in the sports office.
I told them, who watch a download
ed version of the trailer at least three
times a day. I don't have enough lin
gers to count the number of my
friends who can recite an entire
episode of The Trilogy.
The fact that so many hard-core
devotees are concentrated in one
space at Stanford has a lot to do with
my loss of motivation to see the film
as soon as possible. Coupled with a
new national wave of superlans will
ing to wait hours outside of Wal-
Mart in the middle of the night just
to buy the new movie's toys, they
just got to be too much.
So when a friend told me yester
day he didn't have any tickets left in
his large opening-night block, I
sighed and dropped out of the
"Phantom Menace" race. Alter lh
years of waiting, it suddenly seems
easier to hold off a couple more
days. I'll see the movie soon, maybe
even tomorrow, and probably sever
al times after.
If nothing else, the extra time will
give me a chance to find some new
trading cards.
