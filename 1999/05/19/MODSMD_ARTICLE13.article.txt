Close friends, not silk ties
1 met an awful lot of people in my four
years at Stanford. But over the last 10
years I. like many others, have lost toueh
with many of them, only to see them ;it
reunions.
Many of my closest friends from my
Stanford days are the people I met in Los
Areos eating club in the one year 1 lived in
Toyon I lall.
These are not the Princeton Eating
Clubs where members ask you whether
your tie is silk (yes. I really was asked that
question there). This is one of the few
places on campus where undergraduate
and graduate students can interact on a
frequent, friendly basis.
1 lie Hating Clubs were a major reason
that it took ;i Draw number under 600 to
get into I'ovon. Please don't let them go.

\o 4 mind control 9 here
In the May 12 article. "Searching for
Playmates," Playboy's veteran photogra
pher. David Mecey. alleges that women's
groups control women's personal deci
sions about their sexuality. Expressing his
view that women's organizations tend to
be antagonistic toward Playboy's presence
on college campuses, Mecey states,

"That's not feminism; that's mind con
trol."
We are not saying that women should
not have the choice to pose nude.
What struck us about Mecey's perspec
tive is that in his blanket statement, he
both undermines the hard work of Stan
ford's women's organizations and misrep
resents the effects of pornography on
women's freedom.
While women should be able to make
personal decisions about their sexuality,
the pornography industry is more complex
than it appears.
Some women emphasize the empower
ment and happiness they feel in their par
ticipation in pornography. Other women
feel the pain of exploitation and objectifi
cation.
Let's think about who makes the
money. Porn, as an industry, is not typical
ly owned by women.
You don't see women taking the pic
tures. You don't see women producing the
magazines and directing the films.
Although it allows some women to jump
start their careers, you also don't see
women as much more than tools used by
men to make money.
How this industry then allows women
to discover their individual sexuality and
"relieve tensions of college life" is ques
tionable.
We do not oppose pornography itself
but rather the aims and consequences of
the business.
Mecey's comment also showed utter
disrespect for the valid work that women's

organizations do. 'Mind control" involves
the limiting of options. Let us point out
that the "-isms" still surround us.
Women continue to occupy the lowest
paving jobs, we are underrepresented in
politics and business, and domestic vio
lence and rape destroy women every day.
In society, our '"-isms" are what seek to
control people's minds.
Women's groups provide a necessary
space for women to explore their identities
and empower themselves. They allow
women to discover themselves as intellec
tual, social and sexual beings. This is not
"mind control."
This is feminism.

Bon Appetit is independent
I read the front page article in this past
Friday's Daily, under the headline
"Unionization builds barriers." My eye
was caught immediately bv the sub-head
line. "Contract talks driving wedge
between Dining Service 'family.' "
Reading further on into the article, I
discovered that this was not news about
Stanford Dining Services but about Bon
Appetit. an independent vendor on cam
pus. and a wholly separate employer.
In Erica Piatt's article, the following

quotes, attributed to senior Lindsay Imai,
appear:
"Bon Appetit management have intim
idated workers and even fired workers
who have attempted to unionize."
"We wanted to inform students about
the kinds of labor practices that Stanford
employs."
"Stanford, whose motto translates into
'let the winds of freedom blow.' underpays
its workers and intimidates and fires work
ers who attempt to unionize."
Bon Appetit is not Stanford University,
and it is not connected to the Dining Ser
vices Department at Stanford.
I do not know whether Bon Appetit
management has in fact fired workers who
have attempted to unionize. Perhaps Ms.
Imai does know this to be a fact. If it is a
fact, it is certainly a violation of the
National Labor Relations Act, and the
union that was formed would have had
ample opportunity to charge Bon Appetit
with an unfair labor practice.
Whatever it is. it is not a labor practice
that Stanford employs.
And the statement "Stanford . . .
underpays its workers and intimidates and
fires workers who attempt to unionize." is
not true.
Stanford University is not involved in
the contract negotiations which are occur
ring between Service Employees Interna
tional Union. Local 715. and Bon Appetit.
