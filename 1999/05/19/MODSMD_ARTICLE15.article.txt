## April Van Scherpe Hooking up and losing out 
### 
I 1 —IVEN FROM the
I i bottom of the hill.
1 J you can see disco
lights flashing past the win
dows. The dull reverbera
tion in your teeth tells you
the house must be thump
ing. As you hike your way

up to the psychedelic snow globe, you check
yourself. Ray-Bans'? Check. Sleeveless polar
fleece? Check. Rubbers? Check. Pick up
lines?
" "Cause baby, you're so damn hot 1 need
shades."
"'Cause honey. I need you closer to
warm me up."
"They're mint flavored."
You elbow into the crowd of silhouettes,
flash your Stanford II) card fast enough to
blur the unflattering mug shot and follow the
red cups to the plastic fountainhead. Then
you notice the bass keeping time with your
pulse in unmentionable places. You check
yourself again.
You accidentally walk into a guy 's room
with a Women 's Restrootn sign on it and end
up checking your lipstick to the morning-at
the-campground sounds of a mirrorside uri
nal. Out on the dance floor, you Jreak anoth
er girl friend until the grad student leaves and
feel someone's warm beer spill down your
right arm. Finally, von nudge your friends
because a swarm of eligible bachelors lias
arrived — and it's damn well time to forget
about Jake. The Jirst one's wearing the token
sheepskin from god-knows-what fraternity
adventure, hiding traces of high school acne
behind his sunglasses and storing SO shares of
Trojan stock in his pocket, lie approaches
you pointedly from behind. You sip your
drink. You remember you're wearing velvet
pants. You smile and shake your bull.

By the end of the night, the two of you are
pressed lip sweatily against a closet in a room
where the smell of feet. Doritos and carbon
dioxide hit you the minute you walked in.
You do stuff. You wake up under a draft of
had breath. And one of you goes home with
your shirt on backwards.

The next tiny, you sigh to your friend,
"They never call."
The next day. you sigh to your friend, i
need a woman."
Your friend shrugs. "Nobody dates at
Stanford."
Your friend shrugs. "Nobody dates at
Stanford."

Why are there no relationships at Stan
ford?
People say that we're all too busy and
self-centered here. Or that the girls suck. Or
that the guys do. But as you turn your shirt
around or tuck those pristine condoms back
in your underwear drawer, it should strike
you as strange that at a college teeming with
young, sexually charged, smart-or-rich stu
dents. NO ONE IS DATING!
Because they're all hooking up.
And then they're applying the logic of
hook-ups as a dating strategy.
I he logic of hook-ups is simple. Find a
stranger or a sexy acquaintance. Make it
clear that you're available ... very available.
(Gesture as needed.) Avoid actual friend
ship. complaints, excessive conversation and
other things that tip the dynamic away from
sexual tension. Find an empty bed and get as
much as you can.
Applying this logic to relationships
doesn't work. Strangers only have potential
if you've got something in common. A rela
tionship built on sexual tension is exciting for
a while, but it's just a working relationship

that can be terminated by the first mascara
avalanche. Most importantly, a relationship
with endless availability — sexually and in
terms of schedule — can't work.
Because as much as we try to deny it.the
old stereotypes still apply. Men want.to
chase, and women want to be chased.
Men want to feel like the object of their
desire must be worked for. If the woman
could be won simply, any man could have
her. Instead, her approval is a singular prize
to be earned, not something for anyone, like
mutts spilling from a "Free Puppies" box.
She's got a discriminating palate, and you've
got game enough to please it.
Women want to be fought for, impressed
with affection. They want to know the man is
willing to stay around. They want to be men
tally cherished as well as physically craved.
Hook-ups crush the roles of chaser and
chasee. Women scream, "come and get me!"
and men partake free of investment. Rush
ing to bed (or floor) kills the chase. The next
morning, the excitement — and the relation
ship — is over.
Yet it doesn't seem fair to wait. After all.
if you'd jump in the sack with a beer-scented'
frat party favor, why not with your potential
honey?
Unfortunately, when hooking up —or
acting like it — women make themselves
utterly available and men get bored. Guys
call at the last minute and turn women into
back-up dates. Women wait for past hook
ups to ICQ self-revelatory sonnets. And
nobody's happy.
Go forth and hook up. if you want. Just
don't expect it to morph into a fantastic rela
tionship. That's a different game with differ
ent rules.
