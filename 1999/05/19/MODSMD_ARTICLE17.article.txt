						Bon Appetit 'family': fraternize, don't patronize

TWEN IY CENTS WILL not buy a
postage stamp. It won't go far toward
a pay phone call. McDonald's is
cheap, but 20 cents won't buy a hamburger
bun. With 20 cents you can't ride the bus. and
you can t make the jukebox in the Coffee
House play even one song. In this inflation
ridden world of ours, is there anything that
20 cents can still buy?
According to Bon Appetit, it's still
enough to buy a worker.
On May 31. the contract between the
workers and management of Bon Appetit
which includes the Corner Pocket. the Cof
fee House and the Business School cafe
will expire. In order to preserve hard-won
gains, the workers are bringing a new con
tract to the negotiating table before that
deadline.
Their requests are not dramatic. They
want a more reasonable insurance package.
The current one is so expensive in terms of
pay deduction that many people have to go
without benefits. They want more than three
days of sick leave each year. They want time
off for national holidays — Presidents' Day
and Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. They

want an 8 percent wage increase, which is
very moderate considering that many work
ers make between $6 and $7 an hour. So far,
the management of Bon Appetit has conced
ed only a 20-cent-an-hour wage increase.
In a poorly informed article published on
the front page of The Daily last Friday, the
title indicated that contract talks were "driv
ing a wedge between the Dining Service
'family.'" Quoting two sources, the article
concluded that the union was responsible for
current levels of frustration among the work
ers.
The Daily writer, like the Bon Appetit
management, is either consciously or uncon
sciously missing the point. The union is not
an independent entity driving a wedge
between workers. The union is the workers,
or at least most of them. It came into exis
tence because of their dissatisfaction with the
treatment and benefits they received. The
catalytic event, according to Corner Pocket
workers Miguel Torres and Carlos Gutier
rez. was when one worker, upon returning
from vacation, was told by Bon Appetit that
his salary would be reduced by a dollar an
hour. The workers had to fight for 11 months

to get their first contract passed in May 1997.
So is Bon Appetit a family? It depends on
whom you ask. As contract negotiations
came to a head two years ago, Bon Appetit
manager Mary Clark was baffled.
"We treasure them and coddle them." she
said. "We have trained them, and many
move on to other catering jobs. We believe in
the people." (The Daily, May 2V, 1997) The
use of a term like "coddle" might seem to be
somewhat patronizing to "the people." But
the actual coddling pursued by this "family
style" establishment is more dubious. Torres,
who has worked at Bon Appetit for 10 years
wonders about the closeness of these kinship
ties.
"When it's your family, you want to give
them higher wages, better health benefits,
more vacation time. Si somos una familia,
ipor (/nc no nos him dado mas dinero? If we
are a family, why haven't they given us more
money?"
A single father of two children. Torres
says the money he receives (still less than $11
an hour after a decade) just doesn't cover
expenses.
What do these wages have to pay?

Gutierrez laughs, "/.Que es que no tienen
quepagar? What is it that they don't have to
pay?" — rent, food, clothing, medical care
(for those without insurance). Jose Cruz has
also been working for Bon Appetit for 10
years. He has to work another full-time job
on top of his work in the Corner Pocket in
order to make ends meet. Furthermore, as
Torres points out, under the current policy
one can only stay home with sick children for
a total of three days a year.
Aside from frustrations with wages and
benefits, however, the workers have other
grounds for dissatisfaction with the Bon
Appetit "family." During the first year of the
union, between 15 and 20 workers were fired
and replaced without explanation. Other
methods of intimidation, especially given the
precarious immigration status of many work
ers, may also have been used. Whereas
approximately 80 percent of the Bon Appetit
staff is Latino, only one or two of the eight
managers are Latino.
The general issue of Stanford workers'
legal and economic rights both transcends
and is embodied by the current dissatisfac
tion expressed at Bon Appetit. Three

months ago, an e-mail was sent out to stu
dents residing in west campus, offering them
the chance to have custodial service on week
ends. The message indicated that, while the
workers did not wish to break up the one
blcK'k of time they had with their families and
friends, they "agreed" that the needs of the
students must come first. Fortunately,
enough students declined the offer to pre
vent schedule shifts.
In the case of Bon Appetit. no one will be
asking students, or faculty for that matter,
whether the workers deserve better benefits,
better pay and better treatment.
But that doesn't mean we can't tell them.
Torres, Hernandez, Cruz and others are not
asking for the downfall of the Bon Appetit
establishment —just a little more respect.
Let Bon Appetit know that the workers
deserve more for the service they provide the
Stanford community. Visit Mary Clark at her
Tresidder office or call her at (650) 233-7800,
ext. 425.
The call will cost you 35 cents.
