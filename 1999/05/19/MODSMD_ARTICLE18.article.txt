## HEALTH FORUM Bug, cobra and lazy cow give relaxation and peace of mind 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
1 spent my Saturday morning doing the
bug. the cobra and the la/y cow. While
they sound like they could be the latest
retro dance steps to sweep across this
lindy-hop-crazed campus, they're actually
something far more relaxing — yoga
poses.
Yoga is something 1 remember watch
ing my mother do. Il seems to come i,n and
out of vogue, but it never really goes away.
And as midterms and finals mark the
countdown to the end of spring quarter, I
welcome anything that claims to de-stress
and bring harmony and balance back into
my life.
Yoga, which is the Sanskrit word for
"union" or "peace of mind," claims to do
just that by focusing on the connection
between the body and the mind. It has
been practiced in a variety of forms in
India for thousands of years. Whatever
form it takes, yoga works by making the
body stronger and more supple, as well as
incorporating breathing and meditative
exerciscs.
I sat in on a class offered by the Yoga
Center of Palo Alto. The instructor. Larry
Hatlett. teaches a style called Hatha yoga
that is 4,(KX) years old.
It's not the most physical style, accord
ing to Hatlett. who said that some kinds of

yoga are more aerobic.
"I wouldn't rely on yoga if it were my
only source of exercise," Hatlett said. "But
1 think it's more effective to separate the
two [yoga and aerobic exercise]."
That's not to say that you won't break a
sweat in Hatlett s class. Yoga demands a
certain threshold of strength. You hold
poses for a long time, concentrating on the
muscles you're using, and always main
taining rhythmic breathing.

Yoga can help people be more
graceful and calmer in the way
they live their lives.'
— Larry Hatlett

Hatlett starts his classes by stretching
out the body. He moves about the sun-lit
studio, personally greeting each partici
pant with a hug or a handshake. Some
times he'll stop to firmly re-position a limb
that has gone astray.
Then it's time to move through a scries
of poses.
My favorite was the pole stretch, where
you grab onto a pole with both hands
while two other participants help you to
stretch out your spine by lifting the pole
and moving it back as far as you can bear.
The more experienced members are
eager to help out newcomers, offering tips

to help you correct your pose. The whole
atmosphere was congenial, warm and
friendly — but what else do you expect
when you've got a complete stranger alter
nately pressing down on your back and
massaging your shoulders?
"Let intention go," Hatlett intoned
during the last part of the class — the
relaxation part. Lying on a foam mat with
eyes closed, he instructed us to concen
trate on the sounds around us and to for
get about what he jokingly refers to as the
"triple threat" — jobs, kids and relation
ships. It worked so well I almost forgot
about my thesis project and the fact that
I'm graduating and still don't have a job
lined up.
Chatting with Hatlett after class, 1
couldn't help but notice his aura of calm.
A graduate of Stanford's Graduate School
of Business, he re-thought his calling after
a stint working with the Peace Corps.
"it changed my life," Hatlett said. He's
been teaching yoga in Palo Alto since 1975
and says there's a real need for it amid the
high-stress lifestyles of so many who call
Silicon Valley home — Stanford students
included.
"It relieves stress!" he said, smiling.
"That's the most important thing, and it's
a short-term benefit. And in the long
term, yoga can help people be more grace
ful and calmer in the way they live their
lives."
