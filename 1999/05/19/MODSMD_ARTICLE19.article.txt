# Study has implications for cancer, organ transplants
## Chinese herb found to work as potent protector for body 
### Gargi Talukder 
Two Stanford researchers have found that the
active ingredient of a Chinese herb traditionally used
to treat rheumatoid arthritis is actually a potent
immunosuppressant and a powerful tool against
tumor cells.
In studying the herb. Asst. Medicine Profs. Peter
Kao and lllenn Rosen used pure preparations of trip
tolide, the active ingredient of the Chinese herb
called Tripterygium wilfordii liook. to determine the
biological basis for its anti-inflammatory action.
They found that triptolide can prevent the cells of
the immune system from inappropriately attacking
other cells in the body, which can occur in autoim
mune diseases or in organ transplants.
Kao and Rosen have also found that triptolide has
the abilitv to kill the tumor cells often found in breast,
lung and colon cancer.
"This is a remarkable drug that could have a
remarkable future," Kao said.
Although other research groups have investigated
the anti-inflammatory properties of this Chinese herb
in the past. Kao and his colleagues were the first to
systematically compare the molecular action of pure
preparations of the herb's active ingredient to the
actions of more traditional immunosuppressants, such
as cyclosporin A. This work allowed them to under
stand how triptolide works at the molecular level.
Kao and his colleagues have shown that trip
tolide's immunosuppressant effects occur by a differ
ent mechanism than other immunosuppressant drugs.
The more traditional drugs prevent immune respons
es by blocking the proliferation of active immune
cells.
In contrast, triptolide averts the action of immune
cells by blocking their actual activation. Kao
described triptolide's effects as "extinguishing" the
action of the gene known as NF-kB, an important reg
ulator of immune cell activation.
The fact that triptolide seems to work by a differ
ent mechanism than other immunosuppressant drugs
means that it could be a useful alternative drug for
people suffering from painful inflammatory diseases
such as rheumatoid arthritis.
Traditional immunosuppressants have such severe
side effects that they often cannot be used by patients
until their situations become life-threatening.
Although Kao and his colleagues do not yet know
what side effects triptolide may have, he sees trip
tolide as "a potential way to modulate the immune

system in a productive way."
He believes that triptolide shows exceptional
promise in treating patients who have had organ
transplants and are suffering from graft versus host
disease, in which the transplanted organ causes an
immune response within the patient.
Kao and his colleagues are interested in the funda
mental biological questions surrounding immune
responses, and he believes that triptolide's unique
mechanism of action will provide key information
about the way cells of the immune system respond to
immunological cues.
Along with its anti-inflammatory properties, trip
tolide is also able to kill tumor cells.
Rosen was searching for agents that would
improve the ability of a class of compounds related to
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to kill tumor cells.
Me and his colleagues found that not only did trip
tolide cooperate with TNF to kill cancerous cells, but
it could also kill tumor cells on its own.
Triptolide is essentially able to force cells to com
mit suicide by driving them into a process known as
apoptosis.
TNF and other related compounds also force cells
into apoptosis, but they can have severe side effects
when given to patients.
Rosen and his colleagues expect that since trip
tolide does not activate the NF-kB molecule, the side
effects from taking this herbal drug may not be as
severe as those caused by TNF-relatcd compounds.
The results of Kao and Rosen's work were pub
lished in the May 7 issue of the Journal of Biological
Chemistry.
