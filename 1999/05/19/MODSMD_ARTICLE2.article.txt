Gerald J. Liberman, a former University
provost, the founder of the Operations De
partment within the School of Engineering
and an award-winning researcher, died yes
terday at age 73. He suffered from Lou
Gehrig's disease.
Among the many hats worn by Liber
man during his nearly 40 years of service at
Stanford were chair of the Operations Re
search Department, associate dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, chair of the Faculty
Senate and provost.
During his tenure Liberman presided
over challenges made in the 1980s to Stan

ford's research policies and helped guide
the Faculty Senate through the 1991 budget
cuts.
Liberman served as provost in 1992 and
aided University President Gerhard Casper
in his transition to the role of Stanford Pres
ident. After his year long stint as provost
Liberman declined to continue on in the po
sition.
"Jerry was a good and wise man who was
an exemplary citizen of the university- un
derstanding every aspect of it the way few
people do," Casper said in a press release.
"He got satisfaction out of having his fin
ger on the pulse of the university," said
Frederick Hillier. professor emeritus of en
gineering economic systems and operations

research. "He had an incredible knowledge
of who faculty members were and what
their strengths were."
Liberman first came to the Stanford in
1953 when he joined the faculty in statistics
and industrial engineering.
In 1962 Liberman chaired the interdisci
plinary program in operations research, and
he continued in the position when the pro
gram was granted full department status in
1965.
He continued as chair for 10 years until
he was named associated dean of Humani
ties and Sciences. In 1977 he was named vice
provost and dean of research, and he served

as acting provost from January to
August After his stint as
provost his duties as vice provost
were expanded to include responsi
bility for graduate students.
In the early ISMUs Liberman over
saw challenges to Stanford's re
search policy.
Former Stanford President Don
ald Kennedy worked with Liberman.
then dean of research, to confront
the research controversy.
"We dealt with issues of com
mercialization." Kennedy said. "We
faced issues such as: should Stan
ford co-invest with faculty members
in off campus research?"
Kennedy said Liberman was a
thoughtful guardian of Stanford's
values. "We worked together on an
issue regarding the State Depart
ment which wanted to restrict access
of foreign nationals to basic re
search facilities — essentially apply
ing the same restrictions as are ap
plied to weapons research — and we
thought that was an unreasonable
intrusion with no particular founda
tion."
Liberman's research focused on
reliability theory and statistical
quality control. His research ap
plied to quality control on assembly

lines and aided in determining how
often products should be sampled
and the order in which products
were selected for sampling.
In Liberman was awarded
the (ieorge F. Kimball Medal from
the Institute for Operations re
search and Management Sciences.
The award citation read. "For tens
of thousands of students, faculty,
and practitioners around the world.
Jerry Liberman is Operations Re
search."
In addition to his scholarship
and leadership. Liberman will be
remembered for his signature
phrase, "you have the rest of the
day off."
"It was a standing joke,"
Kennedy said. "It was a phrase he
used to get people's moods adjust
ed. I le said that after a person did a
good job or at then end of a long af
ternoon meeting when there really
was nothing left to do."
Liberman's frequent use of the
phrase was indicative of his skill in
interpersonal relations.
"I Ie enjoyed people." said Fred
erick Hillier. professor emeritus of
engineering-economic systems and
operations research and co-author
with Liberman. "He liked people
and everyone liked him."
"He had a lot of wisdom — he
was a very wise man. He brought
out the best in people."
