# Sexual abuse linked to HIV infection risk
##

The psychological scars of sexual abuse may
be key in understanding why people lead high
risk lifestyles that result in HIV infection and
pursue inadequate treatment once they have
contracted the disease, according to new stud
ies.
Two hundred racially diverse HIV-infected
men and women of different sexual orienta
tions were studied recently at Stanford to
determine how their personal histories made
them vulnerable to HIV infection.
Ninety-six percent of the study'participants
originally revealed that they had been sexually
abused.
"We couldn't believe the numbers," said
Cheryl Gore-Felton, a professor at the Univer
sity of Wisconsin who helped conduct the
study while at Stanford. "We told our data ana
lyst to go do the calculations again. She came
back with l )S percent."
Abuse survivors often lead lifestyles con
ducive to infection because of low self-esteem
and a loss of feeling in control, according to
AIDS experts.
"They either become super sexually active
in an attempt to 'take back the power,' or they
can't assert themselves to insist on safe sex."
said Rebecca Denison, founder and director of
a counseling service for HIV-infected women.

Depression and shame may lead abuse sur
vivors to use and abuse alcohol and drugs.
They then lose the clear judgment needed to
decide when, how and with whom intercourse
is appropriate, according to an article pub
lished in the winter 1993 issue of AIDS and
Public Policy.
The use of intravenous drugs to counter
depression also carries the risk of HIV infec
tion through shared needles.
Sexual abuse survivors infected with HIV
tend to have been abused severely, systemati
cally and for long periods of time, according to
Gore-Felton.
Family members or close friends of the fam

ily arc usually the culprits.
"Abuse victims with HIV have been abused
by people they love. The breach of trust makes
the abuse particularly devastating," she said.
Although the primary link between sexual
abuse and HIV seems to be behavioral, there is
some evidence that HIV infection from the
sexual abuse itself is occurring. Sexual violence
directly transmits HIV to approximately half
of all sexually abused children, reported a
study published in the 1993 issue of Pediatrics.
Gore-Felton said the black and Latino male
adults with HIV in her study had often been
infected in prisons, where sexual abuse is an
everyday threat.
The link between sexual abuse and HIV has
serious implications for the treatment of HIV
carriers. Abuse victims find it more difficult to
expose their bodies to physicians, said Gore-
Felton. They are embarrassed and fearful. As a
consequence, many HIV-positive abuse vic
tims do not get tested for diseases.
Abuse survivors are generally not compli
ant with the recommendations of physicians,
because their abuse history erodes their ability
to trust others. Gore Felton added.
Although new HIV drugs, known as pro
tease inhibitors, can reduce the deaths from
the disease, the medication is complicated to
take.
"Thirty-six thousand pills a year. That is
what it takes to treat AIDS. Thirty-six thou
sand pills a year." Denison said. "If you are not
psychologically prepared to deal with AIDS,
you can't address the medical aspects."
HIV carriers also need housing, health care
and basic necessities such as food to stay
healthy.
People who live in abusive homes often find
that these material needs are unavailable to
them.
"They have nowhere to go," Denison said.
"I know one girl — young, pregnant, HIV pos
itive — she was losing a lot of weight. When I
asked her what was going on. she said that if
she had meals with her family they thought she
was free-loading, if she brought groceries to
cook, her family was angry that she was there
to stav. So even food is a struggle."
