## Bug ponders digital mastery behind new 'Star Wars' 
### Garth Patil Contributing writer 
Q: In the midst of all of the recent "Star Wars" hype, /
read that for Episodes 2 and J, (ieorge Lucas will he
shooting both movies without film, using exclusively
digital cameras. How is this possible, and will there be
a reduction in quality?
\: I knew I couldn't make it through this week without
having "Star Wars" come up in the Science Bug. How
ever, I was hoping the content of the question would be
something more interesting like, "How does a light
saber work?" or "How does having *a bad motivator'
affect R2's ability to function in Episode 4?" Even
though these questions err on the side of science fiction
rather than real science. 1 would have been happy to
venture a creative guess at them.
It is true that Lucas intends to shoot the next two
prequel episodes of the Star Wars saga without film.
Breaking the tradition of the "film" industry (obviously
that's where it got it's name), he will use cameras that
translate light information to a digital signal. Unfortu
nately, the cameras he will use have not yet been creat
ed, but they will probably be based on existing technol
ogy, so I'll be able to speak somewhat intelligently
about the topic.
In the creation of "Episode 1" and other films that
incorporate special effects or post-production inclu
sions, the original negative is first scanned frame by
frame using a high-resolution scanner. Each frame is
stored by a computer as an image file. Image composit
ing software is then used to alter the original image or
add components. Once the new image is complete, a
film recorder translates the image file back to light
information and uses a series of lasers and filters to
expose a new negative.
Lucas will eliminate the step of scanning the original
negative by using a camera that creates that file directly
through the lens. Rather than on a film plane, light
through the lens focuses an image on a series of silicon
chips.
Charge Coupled Device (CCD) cameras are based
on unique electronic chips, called CCD sensors. These
components provide a higher sensitivity to the light
than common films and allow electronic storage of the
image.
A CCD chip is an array of light-sensitive elements
which are, in fact, small electronic capacitors. These
capacitors are charged by the electrons generated by
light. Each light element (photon) that reaches the
CCD array's atoms displaces some electrons, which
provides a current source. These current sources are
liicalized in small areas called pixels.

CCD system, this is accomplished by striping columns
of cells in alternating red. green and blue (RGB) filters.
Every third pixel represents one of the three colors,
depending on where it begins sampling. The fact that
the signal is sequential RGB samples rather than a true
monochrome signal limits the color quality of the sin
gle-chip cameras.
Three CCD cameras solve these problems. The cur
rent method uses a prism block incorporating dichroic
filters. If you're a faithful reader of my columns, you'll
remember how dichroic filters work from my article on
theater lights.
These filters pass certain colors and reflect others.
Three CCD cameras use three identical chips. Since
each CCD produces only one color, all components of
the signal are at full system resolution. It is probable
that Lucas's cameras will incorporate a similar three
CCD design.
A popular buz/word is "digital," which refers to the
representation of signals by a series of numbers. The
above explanation of C( 'I )s shows that they are not dig
ital devices. Light is not digital but continuously vari
able in intensity and color. Light-sensing devices may
have a digital output but only after converting an ana
log signal.
A digital camera is a device where a CCD outputs an
analog signal which is immediately converted to digital.
All subsequent processing of the signal is done digitally.
So will this transition increase or decrease the quali
ty of the movie?
Most of what these cameras do is the processing of
the raw signal produced by the CCD. Assuming that
these cameras can reach the resolution of the marriage
of film with digital scanners, doing all of this processing
in the digital domain can make a positive difference in
the final output.
