# Housing lays out new storage rules
## 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
Last June many students es
chewed the old standby summer
storage solutions like on-eampus
storage and UPS home shipping in
lavor of mobile storage units that
can be dropped off and later towed
away.
But this year, such containers
cannot be placed in front ol dormi
tories and in some cases must be
placed faraway from the residence,
according to an e-mail circulated by
facilities supervisors in late April.
"There was no coordination by
anyone | last year]," said Diana
Conklin, manager of Undergradu
ate I lousing ()perations. "( ontain
ers were popping up in large num
bers randomly, taking up parking
spaces and placed in front ol build
ings."

According to sophomore Malia
Villegas, who used a mobile stor
age service last year and will use the
same company this year, she had to
obtain a parking permit for the
storage container.
She said the benefits of the tow
away containers are ease of use,
safety and low cost.
I lowever, for each advantage of
such units there are also some not
so-pleasant disadvantages, said
Kerry Bach, manager of Housing
Services.
Bach said the storage containers
only started to proliferate last year.
Though she did not conduct an
official count. Conklin estimated
that there were dozens ol such units
on campus, which represented a in
crease by several fold over the pre
vious year,
Sam Davidson, manager of
Door to Door Storage, said the in

crease in storage rentals last year
was due to repeat customers and
advertising.
Conklin said that a letter ex
plaining the new rules was sent by
the seven facilities supervisors to
the residents they are responsible
for in late April.
The e-mail instructs students to
talk to their facilities supervisors
about where to place the contain
ers.
"Approved space is extremely
limited and. once it has been filled,
no more containers can be added.
Anv that are placed without ap
proval will have to be removed im
mediately," said the e-mail.
According to Villegas, arrang
ing a space for her container has in
deed become more difficult than
last year.
"They [Housing Services) told
me they had parents coming from

graduation complaining about the
containers," she said. "I realize
some people have them for weeks
in front of their house, hut they
were giving me a hard time because
I want it for two days."
Stanford Police Officer David
Lee said enforcement is difficult
because, "you can't give a ticket to
a box."
Still. Conklin is optimistic about
student compliance.
"We assume that once students
see there's a system in place, they'll
follow it." she said.
"There's a real feeling of coop
eration. but there is the question of
coordination."
Villegas will have to place her
tow away container behind her
house and is satisfied with the
arrangement.
"I gave them a little trouble but
in the end, it worked out." she said.
