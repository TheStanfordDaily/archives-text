## Card players put the student in student-athlete 
### 
Student athlete: it has sueh a different
meaning here at Stanford than at other
institutions. Athletes actually take their own
classes and tests (See Minnesota, who boast
ed more academic all-Americans than our
noble place of higher learning). Athletes do
not major in Underwater Basket Weaving or
Extreme Mountain Climbing.
These impressive physical specimens can
be seen gracing the seats in classes ranging
from philosophy to mechanical engineering.
How is it possible Stanford is able to produce
so many world-class athletes who find the
time to crank out a degree while devoting
their life to a passion and dream few will un
derstand?

Stanford currently has 33 sports for men
and women and a number of club sports

which sometimes go unnoticed. What kind
of sil ijin does that put on the school? Well,
the athletic department had a budget of

$38.6 million and the only sport that current
ly comes out in the black every year is foot
ball. Yes, that includes a Final Four men's
basketball team from a year ago.
Before anyone brings torches to Maples
and threatens to burn down the supposed
money-sucking, tuition-raising temple of the
body, here are a few more facts. There are
only 280 full-ride scholarships available for
the entire Athletic Department, and those
are distributed among 4(K) athletes. With a
little bit of math, it is evident many are play
ing for something more noble than money.
"The role of a student-athlete is to enjoy
the opportunity to compete in a sport which
the athlete loves and to compete with sports

manship. Not everyone has the opportunity
to be a student-athlete; it is important to al
ways remember that being an athlete is a
privilege," said junior forward Mark Mad
sen. an economics major.
Coaches hold great respect for the trials
of a student-athlete. The road-trips before fi
nals. the 6:45 a.m. off-season workouts, all
while possibly having to deal with a serious
injury. Hell, most of the time I worry if I can
get up for mya.m. class.
"There are always a couple of athletes
that might perpetuate the stereotypical
'dumb jock." but 1 believe this is mostly an
image rather than a reality at Stanford. I
think most students here are amazed that

our athletic teams are so successful in both
arenas," said wrestling head coach Chris
Horpel. "It is not easy, but one becomes a
better person for having gone through this."
While athletes at other schools are strug
gling to keep their heads above water in
terms of academic eligibility. Stanford ath
letes again excel. The top cumulative GPA
among the sports teams is 3.36 for the
women's lacrosse team and 3.47 for the
men's sailing team. Our blue-and-gold-taint
ed rivals only manage a 3.24 GPA for their
best sports teams.
"Every athlete fantasizes about a life fo-

cused completely on athletics. I low
ever. this creates a very unbalanced
lifestyle and usually prevents people
from attaining their full potential."
I lorpel said.
From the athlete's perspective,
most believe they are simply stu
dents trying to pass the same
Hum√üio core or Math 51 as any
other student. True, their legs might
not fit in the seats comfortably or
they might turn in assignments a lit
tle late because they are on the road,
but they are first and foremost stu
dents.
"1 think my peers see me a person
much more than the average fan
with whom I have no personal rela
tionship." Madsen said. "My peers
see me during the good moments
and during the tough ones. They get
to see the real me. The fans only see
the athlete. I see myself as the same
as my Stanford classmates. Many
classmates have talents outside the
classroom including music, dance,
intellectual gifts or the ability to or
ganize. My interest and talents he in

basketball."
Athletics command a huge
amount of time and commitment
which causes the athlete to compro
mise many of the opportunities of
fered at Stanford. There is not time
to go overseas or visit family on a
whim. Holidays become a luxury
and free time sometimes gets
pushed to the wayside.
"One has to make choices all
through one's life," Uorpel said.
"When one decides to not experi
ence some of the other things Stan
ford has to offer, they instead expe
rience something different, some
thing rich and precious with their
commitment to sport.
So. the next time you are next to
a person cloaked in Nike apparel or
with hair bleached from hundreds of
hours in the pool, smile, tell them
your name and shake their hand be
cause chances are they are no differ
ent than you.
"We are human. II you prick us.
do we not bleed?" said junior Mark
(ianek.a thrower on the track team
and double-major in mechanical en
gineering and English. "If we are
hungry, do we not make a Jack
run?"
