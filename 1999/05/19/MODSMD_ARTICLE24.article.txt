# Johnson, Shedlosky use different styles to lead
## 
### Monica Sergott Contributing writer 
Leaders come in many shapes
and sizes. Stanford men's and
women's crews exemplify this com
mon knowledge with senior leaders
John Shedlosky and Vandy John
son. Shedlosky is the friendly team
mate leading by example, while
Johnson epitomizes the confident
and fearless leader in the face of the
unknown.
Johnson stumbled upon crew her
junior year. A friend — who ironi
cally never took up rowing — en
couraged her to join the crew team
after a summer of mountaineering in
Peru. The trip had left her in great
shape, and she decided to give crew
a shot.
"1 joined because 1 was not happy
with just being an academic," John
son said.
Rowing came much too easy for
Johnson, and she quickly excelled
beyond anyone's expectations.
Since then she has led Stanford to
sixth- and eighth-place finishes in
the last two Pacific 10 Champi
onships. She has earned numerous
individual honors including being
selected to participate at the
Olympic Training Selection Camp.
There she proved her talent as the
most inexperienced rower of those
selected. She went on to win a
bronze at the Pre-Elite Nation's Cup
in the under-22 division.
Amazingly, amid all her success
Johnson still maintains her modesty.
She described the greatest part of
racing as "the opportunity to do
something like [compete at this
level]." Johnson will end her crew
career after leaving Stanford.

"T here are other things I want to
do at this point in my life. My hodv
would fall apart it I kept rowing.
(Yew here has given me a lot of con
fidence and opened up a lot of
doors." said Johnson.
The women's crew team should
be exceedingly thankful for that
friend.
The men's crew team is lead by a
polar opposite.
When the men's crew attack the
dining hall after practice, not only are
the plates piled higher than the aver
age football player's, but Shedlosky's
presence at the table puts an outsider
at ease with these giants, and his role
as a "silent leader" and one that leads
by example stands out.
Shedlosky's teammates view him
as both a friend and a mentor. "John
pulls hard and is always working
hard in practice. He's a great all
around guy." said teammate Will
Smith.
Shedlosky was a multi-talented
athlete in high school and came to
Stanford with hopes of continuing
with his love for sports at a varsity
level. Luckily his great athletic abili
ty matched his high hopes and he
proved to be a major contributor to
the success of the Stanford crew over
the past four years.
1 le described his favorite aspect
of competition as •"finding new limits
for myself and breaking them on a
daily basis."
But Shedlosky was not quick to
sav that the four years of grueling
6:45 a.m. practices were smooth sail
ing. "Like any sport here, it can be
discouraging and fun in the same
moment."
Shedlosky's friendly and under
standing personality is what seems

to get him through the rough spots
and shines through in his interaction
with the t«"»m. I le describes his crew
experience with a wide smile as
"doing something with guys who
I've clearly become close with at
Stanford, and all before eight in the

morning."
The senior co-captain believes
the most important aspects of crew
are commitment and a strong work
ethic; in other words, he embodies
the essential elements of a phenom
enal teammate and leader.

Over the past three years, Shed
losky has led the varsity boats to
three fourth-place finishes in the Pa
cific 10 Conference Championship.
This place does not account for the
increased funding of crew teams
around the nation, while the Stan

ford program's funds have not near
ly grown at the same rate.
They might take different ap
proaches and be seen in different
lights, but no teammate would ever
deny how valuable Johnson and
Shedlosky are to the program.
