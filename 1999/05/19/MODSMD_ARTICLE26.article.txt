Colorado was crowned champi
on. while two Western Conference
teams, Cal Poly-San Louis Obispo
and IJC-Davis, placed second and
third, respectively.
Differing from most champi
onships, only the men's and
women's A Division races were
contested at nationals.
Although many riders distin
guished themselves throughout the
weekend, Dario Falquier's third
place finish in the men's road race
was the biggest accomplishment
for the Cardinal.
The race included 140 riders
from around the country, all com
peting on an 11 -mile loop. The
course was done six times and con
sisted of two climbs, the second
one including a grueling steep sec
tion near the top.
The road race took place on Sat

urday, with clear skies and perfect
60-degree weather. In the first few
laps, the pack split near the top of
the second hill only to come to
gether again on the flats.
As energy began to wane near
the seeond-to-last lap. riders began
to string out. but Falquier managed
to stay on pace with the race's lead
ers.
With the finish line steadily be
coming a reality. Falquier began to
develop cramps but was able to
stay with a second-place Colorado
rider until the last 200 meters of the
race
The third-place finish was the
highest ever bv a Stanford male
racer in the National's road race.
Stanford rider Will Parks was 33rd
in the same event.
"The highlight of the road race
for me this year was just being in
the same race as Dario and to share
in his excitement in becoming the
best Stanford finisher in a mass
start race at Nationals ever." Parks
said.
In the other races. Stanford's
second biggest showing was a fifth
place finish in the men's team time
trial.
The Cardinal squad was led by
Scott Crawford, in a race that in
cluded over 20 other teams. Al
though Stanford has finished sec
ond in the past, the fifth-place fin
ish was impressive given this
year's personnel.
For the women. Megan Troxell
placed fourth in the women's road
race and l()th in the criterium.
These types of results have be
come the norm for the graduate
student in medicine, +>ut Erin kas
soy's 12th-place finish in the cri
terium was a pleasant surprise, es
pecially for a rider who until na
tionals considered the road race
her forte.
In the women's road race, kas
soy placed 23rd. right ahead of
teammate Anona Dutton in 25th.
With no men's criterium spe
cialist. Stanford was definitely at a
disadvantage, making the fifth
place finish all the more impres
sive.
The Cardinal, in fact, was the
best placed of any team which had
a void in any one category, and it
outseored all but Colorado and
Cal Poly in the other five events
combined.
