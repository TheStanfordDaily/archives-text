# Branner RA takes prize
## 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
Residents of Branner Hall are known for taking
pride in living in the largest freshman dorm on campus.
This year the 180-odd freshmen have something else to
boast about: having the best resident assistant.
Senior Katie Kozuki received this year's Harvey
Award, honoring the outstanding resident assistant in
an all-freshman house. The award was established three
years ago by Sue and Hob Harvey, former professors
and resident fellows at Larkin.
"It's definitely an honor." Kozuki said. She was
quick to credit the staff at Branner and the residents
themselves. "I owe a lot to them," she said.
"I think RA's sometimes get taken for granted," said

award coordinator Janet Wright, who called the award
an opportunity not only to recognize students for their
efforts, but also a way to encourage students to become
RAs in all-freshman dorms.
This year, 41 of 167 RAs staff all-freshman resi
dences.
Resident fellows or students involved in dorm gov
ernment may nominate their RAs. A selection commit
tee chose Kozuki to receive the honor, which carries a fi
nancial award of about $500. The committee consisted
of three upperclass students who lived in all-freshman
houses. Residence Dean Andy Hernandez, Wright and
Director of Residential Education Jane Camarillo.
According to Wright, nominees must help students
create an inclusive community, edu
cate future residential leaders and
help first-year students cope with the
challenges of college.
"She met all these criteria and
more." Wright said.
Brainier Residence Fellow Ken
nell Jackson called ko/uki a "dv

namo in terms of doing activities for
the dorm."
ko/uki has been instrumental in
planning the Brainier yearbook, or
ganizing trips and forming a "Bran
nerobics" exercise program.
()n Parents Weekend, she helped
take photos of parents with their chil
dren and sent the photos to the par
ents.
"She's helped bring us together as
a community," Jackson said.

Residence Dean Jim Cadina.
whose responsibilities include Bra li
ner 1 lall, credited Kozuki's calm and
intelligent perspective and the bal
ance she brings to the position.
"Being an RA is hard." Cadina
said. "Not everybody... approaches
the job in that way."
1 lernandez, who is on emergency
call during the weekends, praised
ko/uki for her level-headedness.
"She just shows a really great

sense of judgement in those situa
tions." he said.
Ko/uki called being an RA a
"multidimensional role."
"I wanted to be there in whatever
capacity needed," she said.
Ko/uki said being a Branner R A
is the "best experience of my Stan
ford career."
"We've had ups and downs, but
definitely more ups than downs," she
said, calling the year "pretty calm."
