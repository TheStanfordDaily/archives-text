# Branner RA takes prize
## 
### Jaime Adame Editorial staff 
Residents of Branner Hall are known for taking
pride in living in the largest freshman dorm on campus.
This year the 180-odd freshmen have something else to
boast about: having the best resident assistant.
Senior Katie Kozuki received this year's Harvey
Award, honoring the outstanding resident assistant in
an all-freshman house. The award was established three
years ago by Sue and Hob Harvey, former professors
and resident fellows at Larkin.
"It's definitely an honor." Kozuki said. She was
quick to credit the staff at Branner and the residents
themselves. "I owe a lot to them," she said.
"I think RA's sometimes get taken for granted," said

award coordinator Janet Wright, who called the award
an opportunity not only to recognize students for their
efforts, but also a way to encourage students to become
RAs in all-freshman dorms.
This year, 41 of 167 RAs staff all-freshman resi
dences.
Resident fellows or students involved in dorm gov
ernment may nominate their RAs. A selection commit
tee chose Kozuki to receive the honor, which carries a fi
nancial award of about $500. The committee consisted
of three upperclass students who lived in all-freshman
houses. Residence Dean Andy Hernandez, Wright and
Director of Residential Education Jane Camarillo.
According to Wright, nominees must help students
