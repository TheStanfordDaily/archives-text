# Seniors leave growing legacy for lacrosse
## 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
With three league championships
under its belt in the last five years,
the Stanford women's lacrosse team
may just appear to be keeping the
tradition of lacrosse excellence alive
at Stanford. That is not the case. The
tradition is just beginning.
Until 1994, women's lacrosse was
only a club sport on the Farm. Its im
pressive record as a club team, com
bined with Title IX, helped the team
gain varsity status under coach Kay
Cowperthwait. At first the Cardinal
struggled. Senior Stephanie Tuerk
recalled flyers urging women to
come out for the team.
"It was difficult to field an entire
team," Tuerk said. "The skill level
on the team varied greatly from girls
who had never played before to girls
who had been playing their whole
lives."
Senior co-captain Alexis Patrizio
agreed and credits current head
coach Heidi Connor, who took over
for Cowperthwait in 1997, with turn
ing a brand-new team into a team of

champions.
"When I was a freshman, we were
barely recognized by the Athletic
Department and had very little fund
ing. There really wasn't a sense of co
herence to the program, and we
were sort of just bumbling along, un
sure of what the next step would be,"
Patrizio said. "When Heidi took
over the lacrosse program, she start
ed to shape it and give it a sense of
coherence and continuity."
This spring, when Patrizio and se
nior co-captain Carey Jones gradu
ate, Stanford w ill be saying goodbye
to its first four-year women's varsity
lacrosse players. Tuerk, the third se
nior on the team, is a two-year varsi
ty letter-winner for the Cardinal.
These three women have seen
the program grow. They leave be
hind a team with a near flawless
record filled with many impressive
recruits, high school All-Americans
and team and league M VPs ready to
continue the success of Cardinal
lacrosse.
"Heidi has plunged into the
world of recruiting and has tried to
draw players with talent and experi

ence to Stanford," Patrizio said.
"She's focused on elevating the level
of lacrosse within the team, but also
on expanding to playing the stronger
East Coast teams to show that we
could compete with them."
Tuerk added that the team's
growing program is a major part of
the draw for women to come to Stan
ford to play lacrosse. It gives women
a chance to continue with a sport
they love and immediately begin to
make contributions to the team,
even as freshmen.
They all agreed that the school's
reputation and the accommodating
California weather play into the de
cision as well.
"Nowhere else can a lacrosse
player play competitive lacrosse
starting in the w inter outside without
freezing to death," Patrizio said.
With Stanford's 11 freshmen this
year and six more expected for next
year, the Cardinal is proving that it is
a team growing rapidly in populari
ty-
For the seniors, their hard work
at making a dedicated, competitive
team is finally paying off.

"The Athletic Department is tak
ing us seriously ... and the lacrosse
community is starting to recognize
us as a real varsity team," Tuerk said.
The seniors couldn't have asked
for a better way to end their careers
at Stanford. They leave their mark
with a season filled with suh high
lights including first-ever wins over
such East Coast teams as Holy Cross
and Pennsylvania and a 16-3 clob
bering of California. The women will
also take with them such titles as the
Division I Western States crown, as
well as the Western Women's
Lacrosse League title for the second
year in a row.
Although the team is reaping the
benefits of talented newcomers and
looks sure to have another successful
season next year, the seniors will cer
tainly be missed. Midfielder Patrizio
leaves Stanford with 89 career goals
and 46 assists. Jones, another mid
fielder. leaves with 86 career goals
and 29 assists. Both women will be
missed not only for their contribu
tions on the field, but also for their
leadership roles since both Jones
and Patrizio have led the team for

three years as captains. Tuerk, the
team's starting goalie, leaves after a
successful season with 148 saves for
262 shots in net.
"The best part for me was coming
in and never having played lacrosse
before, and getting the opportunity
to step into a leadership role my
sophomore year." Jones said. "Also,
winning two WWLL championships
was amazing."
"I've loved the opportunity to
continue with a sport that I really
love past high school, from playing
everyday to the team camaraderie,
seeing the team improve and show
ing everyone that we are a force to
be reckoned with," Tuerk said.
Patrizio agreed and although she
will be sad to leave, she looks with
excitement toward the future of
lacrosse at Stanford.
"When I came to Stanford, I

didn't think I would play any sport,
but I started playing and I got
hooked. I've had the unusual experi
ence of being able to play several dif
ferent positions over my career, as
well as playing with a large number
of people, which I don't think would
have been possible elsewhere," she
said. "I wish 1 could still be playing
when this team is ready to compete
nationally."
The women are confident that
they are leaving behind a team that
will soon be recognized as one of the
top 20 in the nation.
"I hope to look back on the Stan
ford lacrosse team in 10 years or so,
and see that they're winning Divi
sion I championships." Jones said.
"It'd be really nice if we were already
there, but I've absolutely loved hav
ing been a part of building this pro
gram."
