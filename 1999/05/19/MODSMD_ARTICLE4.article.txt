# Nom Comm causes ASSU
## controversy Three-person walkout stalls senate's final meeting 
### Alice Brown Staff writer 
This year's ASSU met for the last
time last night to vote on eight bills,
most significantly the enactment of
bylaws for next year's senates.
However, the final gathering
came close to premature adjourn
ment due to controversy over the sec
ond bill on the agenda.
The bill dealt with student ap
pointments to University committees
and included a complete list of all stu
dents nominated for positions by the
Nominations Commission.
Graduate senators Dave Robin
son. Harris Shapiro and Hunter Tart
objected to the nomination of law
student Scott Hemphill to the Com
mitte on Academic Policy, Planning
and Management on the grounds
that the Nominations Commission
had not followed the correct proce
dure as articulated in the associa

tion's bylaws in nominating him.
A motion lo table the bill failed,
and the bill came up for a vote. Be
fore the vote began, however, several
graduate senators left the room, re
sulting in a failure of the senate to
meet graduate student quorum.
At least one-third of graduate sen
ators must be present at each meet
ing. and with only two senators re
maining in the room, less than a third
was in attendance.
"The status of the whole ASSU is
being held in limbo by one nomina
tion, which has been thoroughly and
adequately reviewed." said Senate
Chair Adam Weiss, a junior.
In the 25 minutes that the ASSU
was unable to operate, undergradu
ate senators expressed their frustra
tion with the situation.
"This is ridiculous," said under
graduate senator Clarence Hu, a se
nior. "This is a juvenile tactic."
In reference to the fact that the

Senate still had a great deal of items
on the agenda, elections commission
er Jason Kang, a junior, said, "It's dis
appointing given that there are so
many other things that the senate has
to take care of."
Weiss agreed, stating, "There's a
question as to how the association
will operate under the new constitu
tional amendment without new asso
ciation bylaws, which are on the
agenda this evening," referring to the
newly passed separation of the Grad
uate Student Council and the under
graduate senate.
However, Kang added, "You
have to respect this strategic maneu
ver." Had the graduate students
failed to return, the meeting would
have been forced to adjourn, giving
the task of approving the student
nominations to next year's senate.
The graduate students returned
after 25 mintutes and the meeting
began again. The bill was brought to

a vote and passed.
While outside the meeting.
Robinson said "we talked extensive
ly with members of the Nominations
Commission. They convinced us that
the bylaws were followed to a degree
we were comfortable with."
He and his allies had feared that
existing I Iniversity committee mem
bers had exerted influence on the
Nominations Commission, a viola
tion of the bylaws. Robinson holds
that the committees were in fact
"meddling in the affairs of the Nomi
nations Commission," but he doesn't
know whether or not the Nomina
tions Commission was influenced.
()nce the meeting was able to pro
ceed. the bylaws were approved
unanimously. The senate also certi
fied results of the graduate senate
and graduate student council elec
tions. confirmed junior Sean Lucy, as
the financial manager and enacted
the transition to a new senate.
