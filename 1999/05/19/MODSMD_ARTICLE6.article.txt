# Another ticket
## Students frustrated with parking system 
### Robert Chiles Staff writer 
You are already five minutes late to your section
with the cute TA. and it is a 20 minute walk: That's right
— you'd better hop into your motor vehicle and drive.
However, because Parking and Transportation Ser
vices only allows student drivers to purchase parking
permits for lots in areas around their residence, when
you return to your car after section, you'll probably
have a $25 parking ticket.
Many students are frustrated with the parking sys
tem and the risk taken in parking outside their residence
lot.
"Under the current system, its difficult to drive to
classes because there's no parking for students who live
on campus other than their residence." said junior Nora
Richardson. "There are pav meters but those are always
full."
Richardson lives in Narnia, one of the most distant
houses from the heart of campus.
"If you live on the edges of campus, it's a good 20
minute walk to get to some buildings," added Richard
son. "Basically, what most people in Narnia do is we just
risk it and see if we're going to get the ticket."
Parking and Transportation Services is familiar with
the outcry, but it says there is a method to its madness.
"You're more likely to find a spot closer to your
building if we have it zoned in a smaller area around
your building," explained Leslie Quintero. manager for
Parking and Transportation Services. "The strategy is
to make those the closest, most available spots for stu
dents to park in."
All parking on campus is divided into mini-zones,
not dorm-specific regions. Quintero believes the issuing
of a universal permit would be problematic.
"We consider that every now and again, and the
main reason that we don't is to protect the residences
where there's more congestion."
Among the most used lots on campus under the cur
rent system, according to Quintero. are the West Resi-
dencc lols near Lyman (iraduate
Residence and (iovernor's ('orner.
While it may he convenient lor
centrally located students to have
their lots free from non-resident ve
hicles. others are less than happy
with the parking status quo.
(ireg (ileichman. program man
ager for parking and transit, cited
multiple reasons for the parking re
strictions on both the busy and non
busy lots on campus.
"II we do it in one place, we end
up having to do it campus-wide."
(ileichman explained. "The other
thing that it does is that it discour
ages residents from using their cars
to get around on campus."
(ileichman agrees that there are

downsides to the policy for students.
" I he positives from (the restric
tions! are you get less traffic on cam
pus and less air pollution, but the
negative is that its difficult for resi
dents to drive their car to visit a
Iriend in another dorm," (ileichman
said.
"The University wants people
using their cars for trips off campus,
not on campus."
Sophomore Eddiemae Jukes
doesn't believe that the solution to
traffic concerns resides in ticketing
student vehicles.
"I think that's a nice idea in con
cept. but in reality people want cars
lor recreational purposes," Jukes
said.
"It's much more convenient to
bike to class, and I think people
would continue to do so despite
parking changes" she said, referring

to a possible system of less strict lot
enforcement.
"I think they should be ;i little
more lenient for people who already
have Stanford parking stickers." she
said.
(ileiehman said residential lots
are enforced 24 hours a day in order
to ward off visitors who would use
residential parking for access to spe-
cial events such as sports games.
Luckily for drivers, there are sev-
eral "shared" lots, where all students
with permits can park outside the
hours of 6 a.m. and 4 p.m.
These areas include the Lagunita
and Koble lot, along with any spaces
marked Cor A.
During weekends, cars with slick-
eis can park in these/ones during all
hours of the day.
II students do need to use Aor ('
lots, daily "scratcher" permits are

available. One-day A "scratcher"
permits are $6 each, and a C permit
is $2, much less than the cost o!' a
parking ticket,
Several students were pessimistic
as to viable solutions to the problem.
' The one thing that I hate is that
people who commute to school park
in the same lots that residents do,"
said Dave Magnuson, a senior,
" That makes me not want to leave
campus during the day. because I
know that 1 won't have a spot to re
turn to."
Jukes shared Magnuson's frustra
tion.
"There's not enough spots and
there's not really a solution," she
lamented,
"At noon in my area, there's not a
spot to be found. 1 really have no
idea why all those spaces are taken
up."
