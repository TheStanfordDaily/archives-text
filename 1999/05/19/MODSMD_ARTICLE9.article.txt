## Barak 'committed to peace' 
### 
JERI JSALEM (AP) â€” Two days after his dramatic
landslide election. Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak
took up the peacemaking legacy of his slain mentor
Yitzhak Rabin, even as construction continued at two
Jewish settlements in contested Arab areas of
Jerusalem.
With political jockeying already under way to form
a new government. Barak made pilgrimages to
Jerusalem's Western Wall and to the black-granite
grave ol Rabin, the late prime minister who was mur
dered by an ultranationalist Jew opposed to ceding
lands to the Palestinians.
At both stops. Barak sounded the same themes of
peace and reconciliation that had helped propel him to
his remarkable victory over hard-line Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. Behind the scenes, even his aides
weren't ruling out an alliance with Netanyahu's hard
line Likud party.

At the tomb of Rabin, whom Barak calls his com
mander. the stocky, unassuming career military man
placed a small stone on the gravestone in the tradition
al Jewish gesture of mourning and remembrance.
During the Netanyahu years, as the peace process
foundered, the prime minister barely mentioned Rabin.
"A circle has been closed here at Yitzhak Rabin's
grave." said Barak. "A possibility has been opened to
fulfill the legacy of Yitzhak Rabin, and 1 am committed
to that path.
"I. as he. am committed to security and peace for
Israel, to a unified Jerusalem, lo a concerted struggle
against terror."
The quiet, plaintive tone was in sharp contrast to the
breathtaking tumult of the previous 24 hours.
Netanyahu, crushed in Monday's balloting, conceded
defeat even before the vote was counted and
announced lie was giving up his party's leadership.
