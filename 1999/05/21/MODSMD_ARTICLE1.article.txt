# University of California leaders concerned with financial losses at Stanford-UCSF hospitals
## UC regents discuss hospital troubles 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Regents for the University of Califor
nia cast harsh criticism yesterday upon
the merger between UC Health Care and
Stanford 1 iospital.
Since the September 1997 merger,
UCSF-Stanford Health Care announced
a budget shortfall of $10.7 million, the
need to eliminate 2,(HX) positions and a
projected second-year shortfall of $60
million.
"The fact is we failed badly in the man
agement of the operation." UC President
Richard C". Atkinson told the Associated

Press.
"This is not private money we are talk
ing about losing. This is money belonging
to the state of California." said Regent
Frank Clark, a longtime opponent of the
merger. "We should immediately set in
motion the process of dissolution and
complete termination of this ill-fated and
mismanaged merger" he told the A P.
While no other regents explicitly ad
vocated breaking up the merger, several
said they wanted to see the fiscal situation
monitored more closely.
Others counseled waiting to see the
results of USHC's revised 1999 budget
which calls for the elimination of 2.(KH)

positions.
USHC officials said as many as 8(H)
workers will he laid off, while the remain
ing positions will he reduced through at
trition. USHC' plans to cut 40 percent of
employees in central administrative ser
vices. Hospital support staff will he cut hv
2<S percent.
In a March press release, Peter Van
Etten. chief executive officer of USHC,
said the merger actually saved johs.
"The merger ol IJCSF and Stanford
hospitals." Van Etten said, "affords us
the ability to make significant infrastruc
ture cuts that will shield against larger re
ductions in patient care service areas than

would have otherwise been necessary."
USHC spokesman Mike Lassitersaid
the cuts would not affect the quality of
patient care. Critics of the layoffs, includ
ing unions representing hospital employ
ees, contended layoffs would directly im
pact patient care.
Mirroring the concerns of the UC Re
gents, the Menlo Park City Council wrote
a letter to the heads of USHC after the
first wave of layoffs in May. expressing
concern over the layoffs.
In response to the letter, Lassitersaid.
"We understand people's concern, but

we have no choice. We have to act or
we will be in worse financial trou
ble."
Among the concerns voiced bv
the regents in their meeting was the
legality of the merger between the
public IJC hospitals and the private
.Stanford hospital. Regents also said
the move was a financial mistake be

cause IJCSF was making a modest
profit while Stanford was losing
money. ()fficials now say the major
ity of USHC's deficit stems from
I i( SF.
Supporters said the merger was
necessary to remain competitive in a
managed-care world and would
strengthen two of the leading med
ical research facilities in the world.
Former USHC spokesman
Daniel Herman in a February inter
view attributed the budget shortfalls

to the cost of treating Medi-Cal pa
tients and decreases in Medicare
spending.
Despite the financial difficulties
and the criticism of the IJC regents.
I laile Debas. I K'SF vice chancellor
for medical affairs, advised against
breaking up the merger. Debas ar
gued the financial constraints which
led to the merger still exist.
