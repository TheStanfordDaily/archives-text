## UC regents discuss hospital troubles 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Regents for the University of Califor
nia cast harsh criticism yesterday upon
the merger between UC Health Care and
Stanford 1 iospital.
Since the September 1997 merger,
UCSF-Stanford Health Care announced
a budget shortfall of $10.7 million, the
need to eliminate 2,(HX) positions and a
projected second-year shortfall of $60

USHC spokesman Mike Lassitersaid

patient care. Critics of the layoffs, includ

Mirroring the concerns of the UC Re
