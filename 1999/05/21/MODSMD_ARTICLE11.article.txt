Clinton consoles families in Littleton
Lin LETON, Colo. (AP) —On a day of more school bloodshed,
President Clinton consoled grief-stricken families in the town where a
murder-suicide rampage by two teen-agers one month ago left 15
dead and shocked the nation.
Clinton said the latest shootings, injuring six students in Georgia
yesterday, were "deeply troubling to me as it is to all Americans."
"This incident again should underscore how profoundly important
it is that all Americans come together in the face of these events to
protect all ot our children from violence," the president said at the
White House before flying here.
The Columbine High School shootings on April 20 also had an
effect on the nation's debate on gun control, softening Republican
opposition in Congress to tougher measures.
The latest step came yesterday as the Senate, after angry calls from
constituents, approved a Democratic plan to require background
checks for buyers at gun shows. Vice President Al Gore cast the decid
ing vote; Clinton called him from Air Force One with congratulations.
The president, joined by his wife Hillary, talked privately with fam
ilies of victims of the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School.
Clinton was embraced by several family members when he walked
in. Others shook his hand.
The families were seated at 14 tables in the church, the Clintons
went from table to table, sitting and talking. There were about 75 peo
ple in all.
On Wednesday night, he called five Columbine students who are
still hospitalized.
Seizing on the Columbine shootings, Clinton has begun a national
campaign against school violence, urging more gun control and less
violence in movies, music and video games.
Nebraska legislature OKs execution moratorium
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — The Nebraska Legislature today became
the first in the nation to place a moratorium on executions.
The bill would put a two-year ban on executions while a study is
done to see if the death penalty is being applied fairly in the state.
Death sentences could be imposed during the two years, but no exe
cutions would take place.
The one-chamber, nonpartisan Legislature approved the bill on a
vote of 27-21 — two more than the 25 needed to pass it.
A Republican and Roman Catholic in his first year in office, Gov.
Mike Johanns must decide whether to maintain his longtime stance in
favor of the death penalty and veto the bill, or sign it into law and jos
tle his party's platform. He could also let it become law automatically
without his signature.
Johanns said he will consider the measure over the next several
days. He indicated he likely wouldn't let it become law without his sig
nature.
"I think I'm here for a purpose. I think I'm here to make difficult
decisions," he said. "With the unicameral system — which is of course
unique in the country — the checks and balances is with the gover
nor's office."
The governor reiterated his support of the death penalty: "I think
it has a place in the criminal justice system."
Johanns could choose to take no action on the Nebraska measure
and it would become law automatically. State GOP chief Chuck Siger
son has urged the governor to veto it.
"Support of the death penalty is essential to the (GOP) platform,"
Sigerson said.

Analysts said "Phantom Menace" should gross $1(X) million to $140
million by the end of its five-day opening Sunday, setting more
records.
The movie is so big that some employers decided to not fight the
Force and just pay to send their workers to theaters.
"Everyone wants to see this movie, and we thought it would be fun
to send our whole company," said Steven J. Lund, president and chief
executive of Provo, Utah-based cosmetics seller Nu Skin Enterprises,
which reserved a theater for all 1,600 employees and one guest each.
