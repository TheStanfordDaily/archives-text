## Beating stirs up racial tensions in Detroit 
### 
DETROIT (AP) â€”The arrest of
two gas station clerks in the slaving
of a man who was beaten with a tire
iron in front of his five children has
heated up long-simmering tensions
between Detroit's many Arab-
American store owners and their
black customers.
The black community "cries out
for justice for this family and for our
community." Detroit NAACP Pres
ident Wendell Anthony said.
Kalvin Porter, a black 34-year-old
electrician, was killed last Friday at a
gasoline station in a poor neighbor
hood on the city's east side. Investi
gators said the clerks attacked Porter
after he argued with them about

comments they supposedly made to
his 12-vear-old stepdaughter.
Fadhel Mazeb, 46. and Adel
Altam, 2b. were jailed without bail
on murder charges. Both are immi
grants from Yemen.
Since the beating, protests out
side the Sunoco station have forced
it to remain closed, and some blacks
have called for a boycott of Arab-
American businesses.
Arab-Americans first began to
dominate the grocery store, liquor
store and gas station business in
Detroit in the late l%()s and early
lM7()s as white business owners lied
the city in the wake of the 1%7 riots.
Metropolitan Detroit's more than

4 million people include about
2(X).(XH) people of Arab descent, one
of the largest Arab populations out
side the Middle East. The city of
Detroit has about I million people,
about SO percent of them black.
"The African-American commu
nity has too long been the victim of
mistreatment and disrespect by
some who operate and work in
stores and gas stations in our neigh
borhood." the NAAC'F s Anthony
said in a statement.
Yesterday afternoon, the two
sides met at a church gathering spon
sored by the civil rights group. Arab
store owners and other community
and religious groups. About 1(H) peo

ple attended.
"This situation was tragic, to say
the least," said Ed Deeb, president
of the Michigan Food and Beverage
Association. "We feel this is not a
racial incident but a crime issue."
Several blacks at the meeting dis
agreed.
Ruth Williams said she has seen a
pattern of racism by Arab store own
ers against black customers. "We
need to boycott these businesses,"
she said.
"There's racism involved. There's
prejudice involved," said Mary
McClendon. "An eye for an eye. a
tooth for a tooth. It's been going on
for 4(X) vears."
