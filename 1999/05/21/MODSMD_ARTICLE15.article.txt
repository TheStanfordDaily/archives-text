Former provost will be
remembered for his
scholarship and service

WHOEVER SAID that one
man can't make a differ
ence never met former
University Provost Gerald Lieber
man.
As the University community
mourns Lieberman's passing and
remembers fondly the many contri
butions he made to Stanford in his
five decades of affiliation with the
University, his loss should be a
reminder that each of us has the abil
ity to leave Stanford better off than
we found it.
Lieberman exemplified the best
in scholarship and service.
His scholarly work in the fields of
statistics and operations research
was pioneering â€” as the citation on
an award lie won in 1997 read, "For
tens of thousands of students, faculty
and practitioners around the world,
Jerry Lieberman is Operations
Research."
And he worked to create institu
tional space for the instruction of his
passion by making operations
research a full-Hedged department
in the School of Engineering.
Despite his love of scholarship,
Lieberman was always ready to take
on additional roles to aid the Uni
versity.
He served twice as provost, once
under Richard Lyman and again
during the years of transition from
Donald Kennedy to Gerhard
Casper.
I le also was vice provost and dean
of graduate studies and research,
associate dean of humanities and sci
ences and a former chair of the Fac
ulty Senate.
He was one of live faculty mem

hers who in June of 1991 proposed
that the Faculty Senate undertake a
study of education at Stanford in the
context of coming budget cuts.
In his administrative roles, he
fought both within the University
and beyond to protect academic
freedom, openness and accessibility
in an era when the federal govern
ment was increasingly trying to regu
late aspects of academia and when
there were growing incentives
toward commercialization.
One of his more notable efforts
was challenging a State Department
restriction that wanted to limit the
access of foreign nationals to
research facilities.
Not only did Lieberman excel in
these many roles, he accomplished
them with a cheerful disposition.
He is best remembered for giving
generously to others and appreciat
ing the contributions of those with
whom he worked.
His signature phrase, "you have
the rest of the day off," was indica
tive of his gratitude toward his col
leagues.
Not only did he love what he did
and the people with whom he
worked, he also loved Stanford.
He headed the committee that
planned the school's multi-year cen
tennial celebration and was an
ardent fan of Stanford sports.
Lieberman once remarked that
when he first came to Stanford, it
wasn't a great university.
However, over the years, he took
great pride in watching Stanford
become one of the nation's great
research universities and in the Uni
versity's many contributions to soci
ety.
Too modest to personally recog
nize his contributions to these ends,
we remember him for his dedication
and contributions to making Stan
ford what it is today .
