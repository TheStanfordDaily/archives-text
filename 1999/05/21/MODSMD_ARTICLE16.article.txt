Row article was on point
I would like to thank you for the excel
lent article in today's Daily ("Row on Mav
field") about the staff selection process on
the Row. It is definitely an issue which mer
its discussion among students living on the
Row.
The selection process is highly vulnera
ble to many of the charges leveled against it,
especially the allegation that nepotism
greatly affects the choice of new staff mem
bers. It is all too easy for one group (or per
haps clique is a better word) of people to get
elected to manager positions. ()nce installed
as managers, it is a simple affair for such a
group to hijack the remainder of the staff
selection process and to fill the appointed
staff positions with applicants who are their
friends (or paramours, as the article sug
gested).
The selection process is fraught with sev
eral other difficulties, including the vague
definition of staff functions and the setting
of staff compensation. Nevertheless, in my
humble opinion, calls for reform of the
selection system by the University must be
balanced with the need to preserve the
Row's unique identity and function in the
undergraduate housing system. Personally,
I have valued living on the Row because
(and I hope my friends in Residential Edu

cation will forgive me) 1 like being in a place
where Res Ed is not constantly in my face
every day and exhorting me to do this, do
that or to ( ross the Line.
Better yet. reforms in the staff selection
process should be initiated and carried out
bv the students, completely independently
of the University. Res Ed has forcibly
changed parts of the structure of under
graduate housing too many times recently
for the impetus for legitimate change in
regard to Row staff selection to be centered
there.

Stein's column was rascist
I have to respond to the racist remarks of
David Stein's column in Monday's Daily
("Fighting the good fight in Kosovo"), in
part because 1 participated in that demon
stration after seeing the posters depicting
the killing of three Chinese citizens in the
criminal attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade by our government and NATO.
The government of the People's Republic
of China has opposed the attacks on Serbia
from the day they started. Nearly every
body in this country has been slow to
respond adequately to this war, and it is

unfair to single out Chinese students for
criticism in this respect.
The attack on Yugoslavia was started in
order to enforce a dictated solution of the
conflict in Kosovo. Military planners think
about all possible consequences of their
actions. It is absurd to believe that NATO
leaders did not know this could drastically
worsen the situation of the Kosovar Albani
ans. Our government must stop the bomb
ing and seek a negotiated solution.
There will be teach-in on the war at Mis
sion High School in San Francisco tomorr
row from 2 to 5 p.m.

Safety is also a parking issue
Wednesday's article about the parking
system ("Another ticket: Students frustrat
ed with parking system") certainly raised an
important issue on the Stanford campus,
but it also left out one serious oversight
made by Transportation Services and the
Stanford Police Department: nighttime
safety.
Cireg (ileichman stated that the down
side of parking restrictions on campus is
"that it's difficult for residents to drive their
car to visit a friend in another dorm." 1

would argue that a more considerable
downside to the parking system is the fact
that many students are ticketed for parking
outside their designated parking areas when
they have no other reasonable choice.
As a female student on a campus that has
had various incidents of sexual assault this
year, one of which occurred nearby in the
Cowell Cluster, I have apprehensions about
parking more than a short distance from my
residence late at night. However, like many
other residential areas on campus, parking
around ZAP is less than sufficient. Any
available spaces are usually gone by early
evening, and students spend time patrolling
I lie lots in their cars waiting for someone to
leave.
During the day, it's easy to hop on a bike
or walk to get to your classes or a friend's
dormitory â€”at least that way you don't
have to fight for a parking space. Hut at
night, it is inexcusable to ask Stanford stu
dents to adhere to a parking system that
threatens their sense of security, let alone
ticket them for taking measures to feel less
fearful around the places they live.
There is no question that this issue needs
to be addressed in the near future. Ensuring
students' safety should be a priority at Stan
ford.
