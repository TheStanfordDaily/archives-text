# Jar on a hill
## Alden Clarke Ah, the corporate world 
### 
IN JUNE I'll start at
the San Francisco
office of I lerman Suit
& Company, one of the
world's most important
strategy consulting firms.
As an associate consul
tant I'll be manninu out

the future, using fresh thinking and a broad
range of analytical tools to develop "outside
the box" solutions to extremely demanding
business problems. I'll be mobilizing organi
zations, pushing clients to overcome institu
tional inertia and take their businesses to
the next level. Above all. I'll be listening to
the client, striving to identify his most criti
cal problems and then eliminating the ambi
guity that surrounds the decisions relevant
to the solving of those problems.
We may not live in a simple black and
white world, but by gathering hard, objec
tive data and applying rigorous analysis
methods — expanding the decision-making
process into new information spaces—l
hope to light a clear and definite path to
success for my future clients. Not all forks in
the road are equally important. That's why
consultants at Herman Snit & Company
encourage their clients to focus precious
human resources on the most critical deci
sions, namely those which are relevant to
process efficacy and new market potential. I
want to do right not only for my classmates,
not only for our nation, not only for all
humanity but for all life upon earth. I'll do
this by constantly striving to recontextualize
business problems in new analytical frame
works. cultivating new insights and break
through solutions to those problems that
matter most.

At Stanford I lived by the "work hard,
play hard" ethos. I his philosophy, along
with my superior quantitative skills, mental
toughness and competitive drive (I hate los
ing and rarely do) puts me on the fast track
for success in the glamorous, high-stakes
business world. To see just how glamorous
and high-stakes this world is, consider that
the case team I'll be joining in June is work
ing with one of northern California's biggest
office supply chains. We'll be crunching a
vast amount of consumer preference data to
assess the long-term viability of expanding
into the lucrative consumer electronics mar
ket. Everybody gets excited about winning
in the northern California home electronics
space, but actually doing it is extremely dif
ficult. Fortunately, I'm up to the task: 1 love
challenges and take tremendous satisfaction
in finding my limits — and then breaking
them —on an almost daily basis.
1 take deep satisfaction in surmounting
obstacles, but this job, from everything I've
heard, is ripe with rewards other than the
satisfaction intrinsic to developing and
implementing solutions to tough business
problems. It's true that at Herman Snit &
Company we put in extremely long hours at
the office, but we're compensated well. If
you do the math, you'll find that — even as
a first-year associate consultant — I'll be
earning almost half the hourly wage of a
shamefully underpaid public school teach
er. Who would have thought I could earn
half as much as my mom my first year out of
Stanford!?
()n top of it all, Ill constantly be learning
about new industries and assembling a port
folio of skills that allows me to think like a
general manager. I'm high-stepping it

straight to the house.
As a first-year Herman Snit & Company
consultant, I'll be working on high-impact
projects with some of the brightest and most
creative young people, drawn from Ameri
ca's premiere institutions. I've already been
put in contact with a few of the Snit rookies
who'll be arriving at the San Francisco
office in June, and our brief conversations
have, frankly, revealed them to be stunning
individuals. But I'll let their credentials
speak for themselves.
John graduated with a very prestigious
economics degree from Cornell, where he
was involved in student government and
participated on the nationally ranked bad
minton team. Sarah earned a mechanical
engineering degree from Princeton a few
years back and has since served a highly
successful tour as a brand manager for
American Standard, the country's most
important toilet manufacturer. One day, we
Snit rookies — the few who have the metal
to make it, anyway — will have all learned
how to think like General Managers, to
analyze the relative profitability of a com
pany's portfolio of businesses and to cor
rectly analyze an industry's value chain.
On this day I will become a god among
men, the intrepid leader of a catfood or
toothpaste corporation, the sort of man
about whom legends are told and who girls
ask to sign their butts.

Alden Clarke is a senior majoring in
physics and philosophy. If you feel real
good wave your hands in the air, and lick
two shots in the atmosphere.
