# '60s activists debate Kosovo
## 
### Michael Robert Fainelli Contributing writer 
The '60s arc back! Tomorrow night a debate be
tween Stanford alumni who protested the Vietnam
War will be broadcast on cable television. The topic,
however, is not Vietnam or the Black Panthers or
free love, but the war in Kosovo.
Earlier this month, Stanford activists from the
Vietnam War era gathered on campus to commemo
rate the April 3 Movement, in which Stanford stu
dents occupied the Applied Electronics Building.
But on the first day of the weekend long event, an im
passioned debate broke out on the war in Kosovo, a
debate which later received attention from the na
tional media and pointed to deep divisions in a group
once known for its solidarity.
Many of the approximately lOOalumni who met in
Tresidder I nion on May 7 had been leaders in the
1%9 effort to take over of the electronics building,
where scientists were helping to develop classified
military technology.
But instead of reminiscing about the past, keynote
speaker Marjorie Colin, class of l l >7(). focused her
speech on the Balkan crises, and her comments
sparked a two-hour discussion in
which the marijuana mellowness
associated with her era was con
spicuously absent.
The views Colin expressed then
and yesterday in an essay in the
Chicago Tribune rebuke NATO
for the bombings of Serbia. NATO
launched the air campaign in order

to protect its economic interests in
Eastern Europe, not to stop ethnic
cleansing, she said in a phone inter
view yesterday.
"Bombing people and killing
people has not stopped the ethnic
cleansing," she said. "It's made it
worse." According to Colin, the
Serbs can be brought back to the
table of diplomacy.
Some individuals at the reunion
disagreed. One of them w;is Philip
Taubman, now an editorial page

editor for The New York Times.
On May 12, he wrote a harsh cri
tique of the reunion on the editori
al page of his paper, calling the en
tire affair hackneyed, "as though a
time capsule sealed in 1% 1 J had
been opened and the political
tracts in it applied to the world
today."
On Cohn's speech, he wrote, "as
she wound through her peroration,
ending with 'Power to the People!'
I thought I had entered a time

w;irp. I was surprised at how many
of our contemporaries agreed with
her."
He said Cohn largely ignored
the brutality of Serbian President
Slobodon Milosovic and his cam
paign of ethnic cleansing.
Lenny Siegel, who was a mem
ber of the class of '70 but did not
graduate, was also present at the
reunion and said Taubman didn't
give the anti-bombing crowd a fair
say.

He agreed with Colin that the
bombing should stop. "The U.S is
not involved in this war to protect
the Albanians of Kosovo," but
rather," to establish that we are the
world's superpower and that no
body thumbs their nose at us."
The debate was videotaped by
the Mid-Peninsula Access Corpo
ration. It will be broadcast at 7:05
p.m. today evening on channel 77
for televisions with Cable Co-op
service.
