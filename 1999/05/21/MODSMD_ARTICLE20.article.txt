# Bringing it all back home
## Mark Silver Some things I almost said 
### 
TRYING to WRITE one of these
columns every week can he a diffi
cult task. 1 think. I observe, I dis
cuss, I type; yet some ideas don't ever
make it past a paragraph or two. The lucky
ones end up in print, along with enough
crapola to meet the length requirements.
Hut sometimes shorter is better. Some
times ideas should stand alone, without
any padding. Sometimes the people just
need to hear. Now is one of those times.
Descend with me into the madness.
Every night I see students sitting
around in the Coffee House; books open,
double mochas steaming, loud back
ground music blaring in their ears. With
serious, studious looks on their faces,
intense individuals concentrate on pre
tending that they're working so much
harder than you could ever imagine.
Who are they kidding? You can't work
in the Coffee House. II you're not there
getting drunk, you came for one of two
reasons: to look at people or to have peo
ple look at you. Having a book in front of
vou is fine, but don't even act like vou're

trying to read, .lust focus on your main
goal: staring at attractive people, or
unattractive people if you're into that.
1 recommend one of the stuffed arm
chairs across from the registers. They give
a commanding view of the entire estab
lishment and also allow you to curl up and
become invisible in case that really annoy
ing person comes in looking for you.
1 have a major problem with students at
Stanford who brag about their sleep depri
vation. They wear it as a badge of honor,
as if they're somehow so much cooler than
the rest of us for having been awake for so
long. You hear these people all the time:
"1 only got two hours of sleep in the
past week! I had 27 midterms to study for
and 43 papers to write! Thank God for
Late Night!"
And everyone else (the 10 or so people
who don't engage in this boastful behav
ior) encourages this kind of talk by sympa
thizing or praising the lunatics for their
impressive work ethics.
People, stop. If someone tells you he
hasn't slept since October, don't sympa

thize with him. Say something like, "Boy,
you really are stupid. Have you always
been such an idiot?" To really get your
point across, punch him in the face.
What about a cappella CDs? Why do
they exist? I can (barely) understand pay
ing money to attend a live concert but
actually buying a CD? Although this news
may come as a shock to some, each of
those songs was at one point performed by
a real, live recording artist. This artist usu
ally did it a lot better â€” can you really top
Men At Work's rendition of "Land Down
Under"? The answer is no.
As for the auditory assault I endure
daily by walking through White Plaza and
hearing a cacophony of different groups, 1
just want to say. keep it up. 1 absolutely
love hearing three different songs at the
same time, and my love of a cappella
increases exponentially with every lunch
time barrage.
The other night 1 was walking by Meyer
when 1 happened to notice a few people
standing outside the 24-hour study room,
taking a cigarette break. Now since we all

know that the only legitimate reason to
smoke is to make yourself look cool, 1 can
only assume that these individuals were
basking in their self-endowed coolness.
Here's the problem: by actually work
ing in the 24-hour study room, you've
given up any chance of being cool. Your
efforts are futile. Throw those Marlboro
Ultra Lights away and spend your money
on better things, like a social life.
The release of the new "Star Wars"
movie this week has gotten many people
on campus into a tizzy as they eagerly line
up in their Chewbacca costumes for a tick
et. I've got news for you people: this one is
not going to match up to the original. In
fact, I'm willing to bet that it doesn't even
come close. New dazzling special effects
are not going to make the movie awesome;
we all saw how George "I'm a shameless
profiteer" Lucas butchered the first trilogy
with his silly computer animation.
And that horrible name. "The Phantom
Menace"? What is that? Why not call it
"Dennis the Phantom Menace"? Or "The
Phantom Tollbooth Menace"? At least

those would he slight improvements.
It's amazing to me how many students
on campus don't like Bob Dylan. Their
ignorance is inexcusable. I recently read
something on a Dylan Web site (why do
work when you can look at Dylan Web
sites?) that sounded like a revelation from
above. The quote said one could divide all
popular music into four categories: 1)
Dylan; 2) Music that influenced Dylan; 3)
Music influenced by Dylan and 4) Crap.
The overwhelming majority of music
that people listen to at Stanford falls into
that fourth category. This awful truth is a
travesty that urgently needs to be
addressed. Wake up. people! There's a
whole wide world of Dylan out there! Save
yourselves!
You can start by throwing out those a
cappella CDs.
