# Sports to run front page every day
## New EIC Lopez to 'Show staff the money', date Reneé Zellweger, smoke more

Gil Lopez is officially The Man.
On a night when The Daily needed him most, the 6
foot 1,2(X)-pound senior sports editor delivered, rolling to
an easy victory in the race for Volume 216 editor in chief.
"He really came through for us tonight in a big way,"
said Daily Managing Editor Ann Kim. "Gil is a clutch
player. We knew if we got the hall in his hands, we'd win."
Though technically running unopposed, Lopez (1 -0,1 -
0 Pacific 10 Conference) held off tough competition from
write-in candidate Batman to secure the win.
Lopez credited his Daily teammates "This was a big
win for us as a team," he said. "1 don't really care about
personal stats as long as we get the job done."
A product of Monterey Park who grew up dreaming of
Daily fame, Lopez worked his way up from crosscountry
and basketball beat reporter to the paper's starting line
up. Though never a news editor (a trait shared by the past
136 winners of Daily EIC' elections), he rode a hot streak
from sports editing positions in Volume 214 and Volume
215 into last night's contest.
"Things are going well right now," he said. "I'm really
seeing the page well and editing to all fields."
Batman, always gracious in defeat, called him "the
toughest chain-smoking, beer-guzzling lush with ab
solutely no knowledge of how to run a news section that
I've ever faced."
He began to cry. "I can't believe I lost to a sports guy."
Next up for Lopez is Volume 216, where he will em
ploy a game plan similar to the one that led him to victo
ry last night.
"I don't know what Gil Lopez is thinking," said bas
ketball commentator and press watchdog Bill Walton.

"I lis platform hus no substance and lacks the coherent vi
sion of a man with any semblance of news experience.
1 le's horrible!"
But The 1 )aily's favorite (ionzaga. er. ( inderella story
downplayed the critiques and refused to look too far
down the road.
"I want to show that I 'm not just happy to be here," he
said. "I'm just taking things one day at a time."
