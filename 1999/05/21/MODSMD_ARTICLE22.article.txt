In celebration of the s()th an
niversary of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences, the newly creat
ed Department of Anthropological
Sciences will showcase one of the
the department foci: molecular an
thropology.
In today's symposium titled
"Molecular Anthropology: Unrav
eling the Secrets of Human
Genome Variation," the depart
ment has invited speakers from
Stanford, University of Utah,
Wayne State University, Penn
State and the National Institutes of
Health.
They will explore the results of
the recent studies of variation in
human evolution and their implica

tions for medical genetics.
The symposium is divided into
two separate panels, "Genomes
and Human History" and
"Genomes, Disease and Behav
ior."
It will discuss topics including
how population diversity affects
disease and alcoholism and how to
use DNA to understand the people
of ancient America.
Molecular anthropology "is a
growing field. It's an area that
bridges the humanities and the sci
ences," said Asst. Anthropological
Sciences and Genetics Prof. Joan
na Mountain, organizer for the
symposium.
"While molecular biology is like
the tools that give us the genetic in
formation. molecular anthropolo
gy uses that set of information to

address an
thropological
questions." Mountain added. "It
deals with both biology and
bioethics."
Although Stanford conducted
research in molecular anthropolo
gy for over 25 years in the Medical
Center, the field was started only a
year ago on the main campus along
with the creation of the anthropo
logical science department.
The symposium is third in the
series celebrating the anniversary
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, following "Ecology in
Amazon" in fall and "Medical An
thropology" in winter quarter.
The event is open to the public
at no charge and will be held from
12:45 to 5:30 p.m. in Building 320.
Room 105.
