FRESNO, Calif. — Yesterday's
softball game between Stanford (40-
24) and Pacific (38-20) was one for
the ages.

SOFTBALL
■ Yesterday: Pacific (38-20) ft, Stan
ford (40-24) 5.

And it was only the opening game
of regionals.
In the end, after 2 hours and 50
minutes, 11 total runs, 25 hits and
eight full innings. Pacific emerged
with a 6-5 victory over the Cardinal.
But numbers and statistics do not
begin to capture the drama and heart
of the game played at Fresno State's
Bulldog Diamond.
"That was one of the most roller
coaster emotional games I've ever
been around," said Pacific head
coach Brian Kolze. "It was a game
nobody deserved to lose, especially
in the opening round of the region
al."
And it was a game typical of Stan
ford's season. The Cardinal's fierce
conference schedule put the team in
challenging situations all year, and
the squad has improved as the season
progressed.
"We battled back all year long
and showed in it that game," said
Stanford head coach John Rittman.
"I wouldn't count our team out. Our
kids are going to keep their heads up

and come out tomorrow.
But, dropping the first game of the
double-elimination regional tourna
ment makes the road to the Women's
College World Series much more dif
ficult. Only one team from the region
will advance, and today the Cardinal
will face elimination in its game
against the defending champion
Fresno State. The Bulldogs defeated
Florida A&M in the nightcap by a
score of 5-0.
"We will have to beat Fresno
State anyway so playing them tomor
row. they might underestimate us
even more," said senior shortstop
Michelle Schneider. "We want this
regional more than anyone."
This desire was obvious to all in at
tendance in yesterday's game against
Pacific. The Cardinal went down 3-0
early and battled from a deficit three
times to tie the game.
Stanford staged its first comeback
in the bottom of the fifth inning down
3-0. Senior Jennie Fovle had a one
out single to center and advanced to
second on an infield single by junior
Kellie Wiginton. Schneider then fol
lowed with a single to center of her
own to load the bases.
With two out, freshman Sarah
Beeson drilled a ball to the center
field fence for a double to bring home
all three base runners to tie the game.
Though Stanford captured the
momentum, it didn't last long as in
the top of the seventh, the Tigers
again went ahead. Pacific used a sin
gle. bunt and a double to score one
run.
They threatened for more, but
both Schneider and freshman center
fielder Jessica Mendoza threw run
ners out at the plate for the second
and third outs of the inning.
Stanford's defense kept the team
in the game. In particular. .Schnei
der's play at shortstop was flawless, as
she assisted on 12 of Stanford s 24
outs.
"Their shortstop played the best
game I've seen in seven years as a
coach," Kolze said.
Trailing 4-3 going into the bottom
of the seventh, the game was still tar
from over. The Cardinal again tied
the scored in its at bat.
Mendoza led off with a single to
left and was followed by a single to
center bv Beeson. Senior Michele

Acosta followed with a ground ball to
short and as Pacific attempted a dou
ble play, Mendoza used smart base
running to head home. With a perfect
slide around the Tigers" catcher Kelly
Lowrv to avoid the tag, Mendoza
scored from second and sent the
game into extra innings.
But the Tigers were far from giv
ing up and jumped right back at the
Cardinal with two more runs in the
top of the eighth on a two RBI single
by sophomore Adrienne Ratajczak.
Stanford fought back yet again in
the bottom of the eighth with one
run, but fell short.
The game was atypical for both
Stanford and Pacific as both normal
ly rely on their pitching, not hitting, to
carry them. Yesterday, however, the
Tigers left 11 runners on base while
Stanford stranded 10. Pacific senior
pitcher
Brandee McArthur, who struck
out 13 batters when the two teams
met earlier this season, only struck
out six in eight innings yesterday.
