The entire lb-team field is stacked
with teams that can all beat each
other on any given day, so most be
lieve it would be unlikely if every
thing went according to seeding.
" This year almost every match in
the draw is impossible to predict,"
said Stanford head coach Dick
Gould. "On our side of the field. I
wouldn't bet a nickel on any match."
If the Cardinal does get by Baylor
it would be scheduled to play the win
ner of the even Texas-Georgia
matchup. Texas is ranked seventh in
the nation and Georgia is 10th. but
the Bulldogs always seem to perform
better behind the support of their
fans. Either school would be a tough
challenge.
Looking even beyond that, the
Cardinal is scheduled to play third
ranked Illinois in the semifinals, a
team that beat them earlier this sea
son at the National Indoor Champi
onships. The only other loss the Car
dinal suffered all year was against
top-ranked UCLA. The Bruins are
the No. 1 seed, and if all goes accord
ing to seeding, the Cardinal would
play the Bruins in the final.
But every player and both coach
es know that looking ahead only
hurts them - they just want to be
ready for Baylor tomorrow.
"Nothing comes easy this year,"

said senior Rvan Wolters. "As always
in Athens, each match is a dogfight
and each one of us needs to come
ready to play our own match. Right
now all our focus is on Baylor."
The Cardinal is coming off a great
weekend of tennis in which it did not
lose a single match. In its regional, it
defeated both Sacramento State and
Georgia Tech hv 4-0. The team per
formed especially well in doubles, an
area that the Cardinal has been strug
gling with all season and knows will
be a key in Athens.
"I am pleased with where we are
right now," Gould said. "As of now
everyone is healthy, we had a good
week of practice, and we are coming
off some good tennis last weekend.
Our doubles will need to perform as
well, if not better in Athens. We have
everything working now, it is just a
matter of either we are good enough
or not good enough to come away
with a championship."
Most of the Cardinal players be
lieve the key will be for each individ
ual to focus on his own match and not
to get distracted bv the fierv atmos
phere in Georgia. As has been the
case all year, the Cardinal looks for a
different guy to step in each day and
pick up anyone who is having a down
day.
"It can be tough to stay focused in
Athens," Wolters said. "Especially
for the younger guys who haven't
been through it before. But the great
thing about this team is that we know
we always pick each other up. If one
or two of us are oil on a day, we can
still win the match."
In addition, the Cardinal has been
exposed to many pressure situations
this year where it was forced to come
from behind with a few big wins
down the stretch. That will definitely
be a key in its upcoming matches.
"We've shown that we have the
ability not to panic and to fight back
in the clutch," said sophomore Ali
Ansari.
