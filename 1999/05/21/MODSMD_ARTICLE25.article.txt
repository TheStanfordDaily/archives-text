In track and field, winning a con
ference championship can be more
difficult than capturing the national
title. Though Stanford placed a close
second at last year's NCAA meet,
their seventh place showing a week
before at the Pacific 10 Conference
meet was indicative of this fact.

There are a couple of reasons be
hind this phenomenon. While it only
takes about 65 points to win the
NCAA Championship, the winning

team in this weekend's Pac-10
Championships will need to score
about twice that number.
And at nationals, the points that
Stanford does not capture get spread
out among the 30-plus competing
teams — not so at Pac-10s.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal has
been rallying around the new brand
of track and field being cultivated on
the Farm over the last year, and Stan
ford head coach Vin Lananna hopes
to show off the improvements as the
Cardinal head to Arizona State's Sun
Devil Stadium to compete in the
1999 Pac-10 Championships.
"Everything that we've had hap

that we've had and the level of com

have come to Stanford this year —

that's something that the team lias

Pac-10 meet.

closer to the top than the bottom."
Lananna said. "We need some guys

Stanford will send 23 men to com
pete in the meet. Lananna expects
big points in the throws and distance
races, while a number of Cardinal
newcomers will help round out the
squad and gather important points

for the team.
Connolly will le;id the throwing
squad as the hammer favorite and
will be joined by sophomore Mark
Ganek, who will also throw the dis
cus. Allen, also a favorite, will run the
400 hurdles.
Nutter will be joined by seniors
Jason Balkman and Jon Weldon in
