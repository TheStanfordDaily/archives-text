The Stanford women's tennis
team (25-2) headed to the I Jniversity

of Florida in Gainesville, Fla., Tues
day to begin preparing for this week
end's NCAA Championships. The
first two rounds of the tournament
were completed last weekend, and

the remaining 16 squads will compete
under the hot Florida sun during the
tournament's final rounds.
According to junior captain Teryn
Ashley, ranked seventh in the nation,
the women left early in the week in
order to get used to both the condi
tions and the time difference before
playing their first match.
"We know it's going to be hot out
there," she said. "The heat and hu
midity will be our biggest concern."
Stanford is seeded second in the
team tournament, and the Cardinal
enjoys a relatively easy path to the
final. Texas, the tournament's sev
enth seed, was upset in the second
round by Miami, clearing the Cardi
nal's path to the semifinals.

tremendous depth and consistency
but lack individual standouts. All six
of Stanford's singles players are
ranked higher than any of the Lady
Volunteers.

past Tennessee. No. 11 USC lurks as
a potential quarterfinal opponent
while both No. 3 Georgia and No. 6
California loom as a possible semifi
nal foes.
"All of these teams are very dan
gerous." Brennan said. "We won't
take them lightly. But our biggest ri
vals. top-ranked Florida and Duke,
are in the other half of the draw."
