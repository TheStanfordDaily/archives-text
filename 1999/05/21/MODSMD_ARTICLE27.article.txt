SYNCHRO
â–  Sunday: Stanford swimmers and
alumni participate in "Evening of
Champions" at DeGuerre Pool, 5
p.m.
The powerhouse team will be
joined on Sunday by Olympic gold
medallist and Stanford alum Heather
Pease, who will perform her duet and
National team member and Stanford
alum Bridget Finn who will also swim
her duet.
Both Pease and Finn are currently
training for the upcoming Olympic
trials in June. Senior Vanessa Shaw,
sophomore Paige Freiheit and Iresh
man Lindsey Wigginton are also
Olympic trial contenders.

"We want Sunday night to be a
chance for the Stanford community
and local public to come out and cel
ebrate the great success of the team,"
said Stanford head coach Gail
Emery. "The team has worked so
hard this year and we have some
great routines."
Emery, who comes with an im
pressive list of coaching titles of her
own (including US Olympic Team
coach), has spent her first year on the
Farm helping to build the synchro
program into one that will continue
to flourish and grow over the next few
years.
The "Evening of Champions," a
culinary and champagne celebration,
will also include live music and a live
auction of prizes such as a Monterey
golf package, Olympic team memo
rabilia and paraphernalia, as well as
other assorted prizes.
Seating is available both in the

bleachers and on the pool deck.
Bleacher seating for students, chil
dren and seniors is $10 in advance
and $12 at the door. Adult bleacher
seating is $15. Table seating is avail
able tor $20 per person and $150 for a
table of eight.
In IWK. the Cardinal squeezed
past Ohio State, which had dominat
ed the collegiate synchro scene for
nearly 25 years, to win the national
title. This year, the Buckeyes fared no
better when the ('ardinal not only
captured the meet title but also the
highly coveted team-event title.
This year's win has been a particu
larly special one for the small team. In
the team event, eight swimmers are
necessary and for every swimmer less
than eight, the team gets a half-point
penalty. Even with this half-point
deficit, the Cardinal was able to out
perform the Buckeyes and take
home its second national title.
