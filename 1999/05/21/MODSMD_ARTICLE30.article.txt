# Senior pitcher Tony Cogan competes in record 104th game
## Cardinal trounces San Luis Obispo 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
When senior Tony Cogan
stepped on the mound in the ninth
inning to finish off last night's 8-1

Stanford victory, lie certainly knew
what he was doing.
The crafty left-hander had taken
the mound 103 times before in his
four-year career as a C ardinal.
Last night was slightly different

than all his previous appearances,
however. Not in the result — Cogan
pitched a scoreless ninth inning,
striking out the last Cal Poly batter
to bring the crowd to its feet and a
rendition of "All Right Now" to the
air — but in the long-term impor
tance.

When the suburban Chicago na
tive took the mound to strains of the
"Blues Brothers" soundtrack,
Cogan was making his Stanford
record 104 th appearance, breaking
the previous mark of famed Cardi
nal reliever Steve ('hitren.
"In all honesty, it feels great, it re
ally does," C 'ogan said. "To be a part
of the team the way 1 have been the
past four years has been a thrill."
faking the record from a Cardi
nal legend like Chitren, who closed
both Stanford's 1987 and 1988 Col
lege World Series championship
games, made the record even more
special for ("ogan.
"Steve Chitren is the epitome of
the relief pitcher," he said. Pitching
coach loin Dunton "always talks
about Chitren when he's giving us
talks. "('hitren did this. ( hitren was
on the mound for that.' To take a
record that Chitren held is amaz
ing."
Of course. ( hitren still has some
thing Cogan doesn't have. In fact, he
has two things Cogan doesn't
the *87 and '88 NCAA titles.
Although Cogan went to ()maha
in 1997 and was the closer for last

season's powerhouse squad, he has
no ring on his finger. Last year
Cogan had a good shot but the team,
which was ranked No. 1 for a record
14 weeks by Baseball America, did
not make it to Omaha, losing twice
in the regional at Sunken Diamond.
"I can't tell you how many differ
ent scenarios I've gone over in my
mind at night," he said. "Throwing
that last strike of the College World
Series or being on the mound for the
last out. I've thought about it a lot."
The way Stanford has played in
its last 15 games, it looks more and
more like ( 'ogan's dreams could he
come reality.
Throughout the Cardinal's 14-1
stretch, the offense has been espe
cially productive. Last night, it took
Stanford five innings to get going -
the team had only one hit through
four innings - but after that it Hexed
its muscle once again.
Senior designated hitter John
Salter, who has started twice this
year including his start Sunday be
hind the plate, put together another
fine game at the plate, hitting 2-for
-3 with an RBI and a run scored.
Junior shortstop Erie Bruntlett.
batting as always in the ninth spot in
the lineup, was also productive. He
went 2-for-3 with two RBIs and a
run.
"Because of the momentum
we've had this year, it's a lot more
positive than at the end of last year
[when the team went into the post
season on a losing note,]" Cogan
said.
"This year we're not concentrat
ing on one or two guys. I acli game
someone else is stepping up to get
the game winning Int. Right now,
we're winning on heart and soul."
