Collegiate athletics has its share of healing sto
ries inspirational tales of athletes beating the
odds and overcoming injuries to play another
game. I hev are hailed as heroes, these players who
refuse to give in to hardship, whose ambition sur
passes their bodily pain.
( aley I loran is a healing story. But her healing
has been internal. Aikl her pain has been shared by
many. And her recovery, with the help of her coach
and teammates, has been in taking action.
For most Stanford students, Littleton is a name
in the headlines. It is a reminder of a frightening
trend of school violence that has sent the nation
grasping to find an explanation for the tragedy. For
many. I .ittleton exists in the past tense. For I loran.
Littleton is home.
A member of the women's soccer team, gradu
ated last spring from Columbine High School,
where she helped lead the Raiders to the state fi
nals her sophomore year. This fall. I loran brought
her tenacious defense to Stanford and used her
quickness and tackling skills to make an impact on
the ( ardinal back line.
"She's a real competitor," said head coach
Steve Swanson. "She lakes the challenge of the
battle — I think that's her greatest strength."
April 20 brought with it a battle that I loran has
struggled to deal with for the last month. News of
the shootings at Columbine left I loran with a need
to find ways to cope with her feelings. She credits
Swanson and her teammates, along with profes
sors and friends, for supporting her during the last
month.
"My team has been a real support network. My
coach has gone above and beyond his job to sup
port me — he used to call daily to check on me and
see how I was doing," I loran said. "My team has
really, really helped out a lot. My professors and
other students have all been very supportive."
According to Swanson, his team has been
brought closer together by I loran's loss and has al
ways responded extremely well in difficult situa
tions like this one. Although many of her high
school classmates chose to return to I ittleton toat
tend memorial services, Horan decided it would be
best for her to remain at school.
"She could have gone home, but I think she fell
very supported here," Swanson said.
Though she decided to stay at Stanford,
I loran's thoughts have remained on home. With
the help of her teammates, she decided to take ac
tion to help the healing process, both in Littleton
and for herself. After a talk with her coach, she de
cided to collect money from the Stanford commu
nity for I lie I lealing Fund, a Denver-based chari
ty whose proceeds benefit the Columbine victims
and their families and promote anti-violence pro
grams in schools.
"I think there's a real value to taking action and
putting all of your emotions and feelings into help
ing people and feeling like you're doing something
to make things better," Swanson said. "No matter
what you do, as long as you take action. I think it
makes you feel better. Caley has really responded
to it, and the important thing is that Caley is feeling
better about what she is doing."

According to I loran. the Stanford community's
support for I he I lealing Fund has not been as good
as she initially hoped. Though she believes that
people want to help, she thinks that Littleton may
have been forgotten after an initial outpouring of
support.
"Now that a few weeks have gone by. it's like,
we're all the way over here in California, and we
don't have to think about it anymore,'' I loran said.
I loran and a few friends set up a table in White
I'la/a to collect donations at lunch on Wednesday
and Thursday. According to Horan, her friends
and teammates have been instrumental in helping
her with her work for The I lealing Fund. By pass
ing out flyers and collecting donations, they have
been able to help l loran with the difficult task of
showing people the importance and relevance of

helping in the aftermath of the Littleton shootings.
"I think it's easy for anybody to look at a
tragedy like this and try to say how it affects you,
but you don't really know until it happens," Swan
son said. "That it happened for Caley shows you
that it really can happen anywhere. It's opened my
eyes, and it's opened the team's eyes."
For 1 Joran. taking action isn't about being a
hero or filling the obligations of a role model.
"It doesn't have anything to do with being an
athlete," Horan said. "It has to do with caring
about people in your community."
Taking action is about working to heal a deep
wound in the community and helping friends and
neighbors in the aftermath of tragedy.
Checks made out to The I lealing Fund may be
mailed or dropped off to the women's soccer office.
