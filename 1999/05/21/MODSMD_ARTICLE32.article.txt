petes in Pac-10 Championships at
Arizona State's Sun Devil Stadium.

Today and tomorrow, 24 Cardinal
athletes will be competing at Arizona
State's Sun Devilj stadium in the 13th
annual Pac-10 Championships. They
will attempting to better their sec
ond-place showing at last year's meet
which was held at Stanford. The Car
dinal has never won the team title.
Standing in their way will be a for
midable UCLA team that is after its
third-straight title as well as the
speedy contingent from USC that
placed third last year.
With Stanford's Tracye Lawyer
taking the heptahlon competition of
the meet last weekend, the Cardinal
goes in with 10 points under its belt.
Yet lust year, the ( ardinal earned 23
points in the heptathlon with four
athletes scoring. Junior Julie Tinker
was among those four, placing third
while also finishing fourth in the long
jump. With Tinker out due to injury
this season, her 11 points will be sore
ly missed.
Looking to fill that void will be
sprinters Jayna Smith, Wilsa Charles
and Robyn Woolfolk. These three
women have all had breakthrough
seasons and combined with Lawyer
should provide a respectable show
ing in the sprints and hurdles.
"I think that our sprinters and
jumpers have done a very good job ;it
being prepared going into this meet."
said Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na. "1 think a lot of the credit goes to
coach Edriek | Floreal |, who has done

a nice job. He has been really a great
addition and in five months has done
a nice job in organizing the athletes'
efforts to get them prepared for the
end of the season."
Stanford will likely make up the
bulk of its points in the distance
events and throws. In the former, a
strong squad of veterans and new
comers looks to take advantage of
the absence of former Arizona star
Amy Skieresz — an eight-time na
tional champion.
In the 1.5(H) meters. Sally Glynn
and Mary Cobb will try to prevent
USC's Grazyna Penc from becoming
the first woman ever to win four
straight Pac-10 titles. Julia Stamps
and Courtney Adams look to score
big in the 3,000 and possibly race well
enough for an NCAA berth — a feat
both accomplished last year. In the
I0.(XK) meters, senior Sarna Renfro,
still struggling to return to her old
form after it year layoff, will attempt
torepeat her victory at the IW7 meet.
All five distance runners will like
ly run the 5,000 tomorrow in an at
tempt to dominate the field.
The throwing squad of Allison
Beatty, Whitney Drumright. Maggie
Isaac, Maureen Onyeagbako. ( assie
Romuld and Summer Pierson is per
haps the strongest group ever from
Stanford. Beatty is No. I on the Pac
-10 performance list in the javelin,
Onyeagbako is fourth in the hammer
throw, and Pierson is third in the dis
cus.
Sophomore Melissa Feinstein
should also be a major factor for the
Cardinal as she defends her title in
pole-vault.
"I think that we are going to put
our best effort forward to put our
selves in a position where we can do
as well as we possibly can at the
meet." Lananna said.
"Of course we're always balanc
ing that with making sure that we
don't overextend ourselves and then
jeopardize the big prize at the end.

ual athlete."
