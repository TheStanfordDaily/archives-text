### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Two Stanford students made a
million dollars in a month. More than
a million virtual dollars, that is.
Stanford Student Enterprises has

ever stock market competition.
Sixty-eight students participated in
the month-long market simulation.
Sixty percent of contestants made
gains during the month-long contest
and the top-two contestants made
more than $ 1 ,(X.X).(XX) apiece.
The purpose of the contest was to
provide "hands on experience," said
Charles Hudson, investment devel
opment manager for SSE. "We want
ed to built student interest and let
them learn about the market."
Participants included graduates
anil undergraduates from a variety of
majors. Hudson said. T en percent of
the contestants were women, accord

mg to contest organizers.
Hudson said investment strate
gies varied among the contestants.
"Some of the people traded very
often — essentially day trading
which included a lot of seniors who
didn't have classes."
"The real thing is in a one-month
period you can make bets you can't
do in the long term." Hudson said.
"We let people experiment."
Junior Andv Lam, the second
place finisher, agreed. " Trading is a
little more aggressive in a month
long competition. but there were no
major changes in strategy," he said.
The winner ofthe investment sim
ulation. junior Lewis L.in. increased
his initial investment amount from
$1 ()().()()() to $2,233,574 over the
course of the month-long contest.
While not an economics major.
Lin has years of experience in the
stock market.
"My mother is a stock broker, and
ever since I was little I had heard tales
about her great stock picks," he said.
"Around high school I began to dab
ble in the market." In addition to the
virtual contest dollars, Lin also in
vests his own money.
Lin's strategy hinged upon Ire

quent trading. "I usually modified
[ my portfolio] a couple times a day."
Lin sees himself continuing to in
vest. "For now I plan to invest on the
side. My major is computer science,
but I am so engaged by investment
that I took an upper level economics
class this quarter."
"One of my dreams is to break
from computer science and do invest
ment banking," he said.
Lam also had extensive trading
experience prior to the contest. Dur

ing the contest Lam converted his ini
tial amount of $1(X),(XM) to a virtual
$1.549.2W.NK.
"1 traded for a major hedge fund
last summer," Lam said. "1 also had
some experience in the stock market
over the last couple of years."
Lam is not sure if lie will become a
professional trader. "It is definitely a
fun hobby, and it helps me think
about things. The complexity of the
market can be translated into real
life."
