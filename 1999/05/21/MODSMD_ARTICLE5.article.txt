## 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
After a two-month search, Hillel at Stanford has an
nounced that Debra Feldstein, currently director of de
velopment of Tufts University Hillel. has been appoint
ed the organization's executive director.
Previous to her Tufts appointment, Feldstein prac
ticed law in the Boston area and worked with the Anti-
Defamation League and other Jewish community
groups. She holds both a law degree and MBA.
"I think that she has a wide range of skills that are re
quired for the office, student work, fundraising and com
munity involvement. But at the end of the day, after a
full day of interviews, she was able to connect with stu
dents and have them like her and trust her," explained
senior and Hillel board member Jason Weiner. referring
to Feldstein's visit to Stanford as a finalist for the posi
tion.
Bob Rosenzweig, who is president of Hillel's board of
directors and also the search committee chair, praised
Feldstein for "a combination of her education, her expe
rience, her enthusiasm and her energy."
Feldstein's appointment marks a change in Hillel's
leadership structure. Unlike all previous executive di
rectors at Stanford Hillel. Feldstein is not a rabbi. While
those in her position have typically been in charge of
both administrative and spiritual tasks, Feldstein will
oversee fundraising, programming and community rela
tions. Hillel will hire a rabbi to serve as a spiritual direc
tor.
"It's a reconfiguration of responsibility. With a rabbi
as the director, it's always been necessary to support that
person with administrative support," Rosenzweig said.
"She's going to need less of that. But her talents will be
supplemented with'someone who will be steeped in Jew-
ish knowledge."
Hillel's hoard of directors de
signed this division of leadership to
better serve an organization antici
pating change. Currently, Hillel is in
talks with the University about leas
ing Dunn-Bacon House on the cor
ner of Mayfield Avenue and Cam
pus Drive. The house will be a new
Center for Jewish Life. Rosen/weig
does not expect the actual move to
take place within the next year.
"We were very interested in find
ing people who can manage an orga
nization well because we have some
important things ahead of us. She lit
the bill," Rosen/weig said.
Feldstein will start in her new po
sition in mid-Julv. According to

Weiner. her start date coincides with
the beginning of planning for the
Jewish high holidays, Rosh 1 lashana
and Yom Kippur.
"I was here for the last transition.
Transition is always a little bit rough.
[Feldstein] is starting just as high
holiday planning begins. It's plan
ning for five thousand members of
the community," Weiner explained.
"It's a large undertaking with lots of
details, and planning has to begin
from day one. Its a busy time re
gardless."
Rabbi Yoel Kahn, the current ex
ecutive director, expects a relatively
smooth transition.
"I think it's going to be great. We
have the big stuff planned for next
year, and the current staff will be
here. We think it'll he a smooth tran
sition." he Said.
Feldstein'Was selected through a

search process that began with ap
plications and recommendations
from the Jewish community. Final
candidates visited campus for a
marathon of interviews, which in
cluded meetings with selected
groups of undergraduate and gradu
ate students. Candidates also met
with select faculty, the hoard of di
rectors and Rabbi Patricia Karlin-
Neumann, associate dean of reli
gious life. The search committee
recommended Feldstein to the
board of directors, which then rati
fied the appointment.
Since she accepted the appoint
ment, Feldstein has hit the ground
running, according to Rosenzweig.
Though still completing her ap
pointment at Tufts, "she's been on
the phone a lot. talking to people
and making plans. She's already
working on it.'"
