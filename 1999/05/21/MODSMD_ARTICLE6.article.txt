# Equity for female athletes on the Farm
## Chronicle of Higher Education survey finds Stanford has high level of Title IX compliance for women athletes 
### Corinne Yates Contributing writer 
The most recent publication of the ( 'hroni
clc of Higher Education lists Stanford among
the universities that most closely comply with
the athletic aspect of Title IX. a federal law
mandating gender equiU in high schools and
colleges.
Fifty percent of Stanford undergraduates
and 43 percent of Stanford athletes are
women. This negative 7 percent difference be
tween female representation in the student
body and in athletics places Stanford among
the top 75 colleges concerning the proportion
of female students on athletic teams among the
306 Division I schools surveyed.
"Title IX is good for women's athletics, be
cause the old myth that women don't play
sports is starting to go away." said Sylvia
Bereknyei, a freshman member of the
women's swimming team.
Rankings range from a positive 10 percent
difference at the I Inited States Airforce Acad
emy to a negative 17 percent at the I Jniversitv
of Deleware. While Hi percent of the under
graduate population at the Airforce Academy
is female. 26 percent of the athletes are women.
In contrast. 58 percent of undergraduates at
the University of Delaware are women, but
only 41 percent of athletes are.
Other ranking categories included recruit
ing and operating budgets, scholarships and
pay for coaches.
While many colleges reduce men's pro
grams in order to even out the percentages,
Stanford instead tries to bring all programs up
to the same level.
"We've been lucky here and not had to cut
at all to build the women's programs." Athlet

ic Director led Leland, who has seen women's
water polo, lacrosse and synchronized swim
ming added during his time at Stanford, said in
1997. "Some programs probably had some
scholarship limitations, but none were directly
related to Title IX."
Bereknyei noted that while 15 scholarships
aie offered for the women's swimming team,
men only receive nine. She agreed, however,
that it is probablv not directly related to Title
IX.
Freshman Chuck Fairbanks from the
wrestling team said there is not much money
available for wrestling scholarships. He was
less optimistic about Title IX.
" Title IX isn't always totally fair. Wrestling
has been shafted a lot because there isn't a
women's counterpart to it like there is with
many other sports," Fairbanks said.
I Ic continued. "Unlike other schools. Stan
lord is good because it hasn't cut any sports. It
adds women's teams instead. In general, it
seems that some teams are more encouraged
so that the college will comply. I don't think
that athletic participation has to be 50-50 if the
desire to participate is not 50-50."
• "People all over try to get athletic directors
to pit male sports versus female ones, which is
inappropriate. We have a compatible depart
ment and more in common than outside peo
ple think." Leland said in 1997.
Emily Lawrence, a freshman and a member
of the women's volleyball team, also saidsome
men's athletic teams suffered because of Title
IX. but concluded that support is "not so much
a girl-guy issue."
Lawrence said. "If you go to a women's
basketball game you will see the stands com
pletely filled. It really depends on the
sport."
