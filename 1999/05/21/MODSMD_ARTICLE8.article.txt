Car Break-ins
Two car burglaries occurred
Monday night between 9 and 10
p.m. at the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center.
Sophomore Baxter Under
wood left his 19% Jeep Cherokee
locked with car alarm active when
he went to work out.
He returned to find his car's
passenger window smashed, with
doors locked and no alarm sound
ing. $50 in cash and a carrying case
with 50 CDs were stolen.
During the same time period, a
1999 Volkswagen Pasat belonging
to assistant men's soccer coach
Brian Wiese was also burglarized.
The rear driver side window
was smashed and a black bag con
taining a cell phone and a wallet
were stolen. I lowever, police later
recovered the bag with nothing
missing hidden in a nearby hedge.
Police say that it is possible that
the break-ins are related to anoth
er burglary at the Arrillaga lot on
May 4. In that ease, a wallet was
stolen from a Lexus after the thief
smashed in the passenger window.

Oddly, in each of the burglar
ies. no attempt has been made to
steal the stereo systems.
No arrests have been made and
police have no suspects.
Two indecent exposures
Two more cases of indecent ex
posure were reported on campus
May 10.
At about 4 p.m., a jogger re
ported to a daycare worker at the
Nixon Elementary School on
Stanford Avenue that she had
seen a man masturbating in a
nearby ditch.
About an hour later, a student
walking to her car from Jackson
Library reported seeing a man in
bushes near Lasuen Mall and Mu
seum Way. Although the foliage
prevented her from seeing any
thing but his torso, it was apparent
that the man was masturbating.
Police are not sure if this is only
one person or it it is related to the
incident outside C übbcrley Audi
torium. in which a man masturbat
ed and yelled at passers-by.
Four more wallet thefts
Four unlocked dorm rooms
were burglarized recently on the

east side of campus.
The first theft occurred on Fri
day, May 7 in Kimball between
5:30 and 6 p.m. Before going to
dinner, senior William Yu placed
his wallet inside his desk drawer.
The next day he noticed his wallet
was missing. After contacting po
lice and his credit card agency, it
was confirmed that a $7(M) pur
chase had been made with his
card.
Dormer's first floor was hit two
afternoons in a row between 3 and
5 p.m. by the thief. First, on Sun
day. May 9, a napping Thomas Liu
thought he heard someone enter
his room, but didn't take any ac
tion. When he woke up and went
to dinner, he noticed his Visa card
and $25 were missing.
On Monday, freshman Daniel
Lee was the victim and also lost
some cash and credit cards. His
credit card was also used for a
$700 purchase at an undisclosed
department store.
Also on May 10 between 12
and I p.m.. Whitman senior Jose
Gordon was robbed while he was
in the dorm lounge. When he got
to the Bookstore, he realized that
he was missing his credit card and

$150.
"All four are probably related.
It looks like the same person,"
said Stanford Police Sergeant Hi
lary Karp. The only description of
the suspect was given by Gordon,
who remembers having a short
conversation with a non-Whitman
resident right before leaving for
the Bookstore. The suspect is de
scribed as a white male with blond
hair. 5-foot-6, age 16-20.
Unfortunately, this petty theft
is fairly common, said Stanford
Police Sergeant Hilary Karp. "If
it's not wallets, then it's laptops or
cell phones. It's an easy crime for
the suspect, there's not the same
level of risk or punishment [com
pared to a robbery], and you can
still make a lot of money."
Authorities stress the simple
need to lock room and dorm entry
doors. "This becomes all the more
important as we move into the end
of the year when lots of people
you don't recognize are helping
friends and family more out of res
idences," said Kerry Bach, the fa
cilities supervisor for Stern and
C'owell Cluster. "It is very easy for
a thief to leave with boxes of stuff
and never be questioned."
