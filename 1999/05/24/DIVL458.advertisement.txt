Meet author Ellen Handler Spitz
Tuesday, May 25, at 7 p.m.
Mention a name from a beloved childhood picture book—Madeline, Peter Rabbit, Max and his "wild
things"—and most adults can recollect a bright image, fragments of a story, the timbre of a certain
reading voice, the sensation of being held, and best of all being
together with someone and enveloped in fantasy. Why do
y picture book images shown to us as young children linger
in our minds? How do picture books shape our lives
early on and even later into adultho °d? This book takes
up such questions. It explores the profound impact of the
experience of reading to children.

• \ picture books transmit psychological v]y\
/ j wisdom, convey moral lessons, shape I
