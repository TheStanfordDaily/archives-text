# Women's tennis crowned NCAA champs
## Cardinal fights through rain, hometown Florida to win record 10th NCAA title, Stanford's first of 1998-99 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
There's no doubt that the Stan
ford women's tennis team is a
young squad. With four freshmen in
the starting lineup, some people
might even call the team inexperi
enced. But yesterday, the second
seeded Stanford women displayed a
tenacious maturity in dismantling
the No. 1 University of Florida
Gators (31-2). 5-2.

With the victory, the Cardinal
captured the NCAA team title and
capped a remarkable season.
Yesterday's match, cut by a rain
delay midway through the after
noon. couldn't have been more dra
matic.
When the rain began to fall, the
Cardinal was in a precarious posi
tion and thus relished the opportuni
ty to rest and regroup.
While freshman and second
ranked Marissa Irvin overpowered

Florida's Whitney Laiho in the No. 1
singles match, 6-2, 6-1, junior Teryn
Ashley and freshman Gabby Lastra
succumbed to their respective oppo
nents in straight sets.
Ashley, who had sat out both the
quarterfinal and semifinal matches,
was visibly bothered by her sore left
wrist throughout her match.
When the players left the courts
to escape the rain, Florida enjoyed a
2-1 lead. Moreover, in the singles
matches that remained, Florida
boasted commanding leads.
Florida's Stephanie Hazlett won
the first set 7-6 (8-6) but was behind
4-0 in the second at the No. 4 posi
tion against Lauren Kalvaria. Gator
Traci Green won the opening set 6-4
and led 3-2 in the second set of her
No. 5 match against junior Jennifer
Heiser. At the No. 6 spot, Florida's
M.C. White lost the first set 6-3 but
enjoyed a 5-2 lead in the second set
of her match against freshman
KeikoTokuda.

Shockingly, Stanford managed to
pull out all three closely contested
matches after the 37-minute rain
delay.
Tokuda roared back for a straight
set triumph over White, capturing
four games in a row and wrapping up
the match, 6-3,7-6 (7-0).
Then, the drama intensified, as
both Heiser and Kalvaria found
themselves in compelling three-set
duels.
Heiser battled Green to a second
set tie-breaker, only to eventually
find herself down 3-6 — three match
points for Florida.
Calmly, Heiser saved all three
match points, soon taking the tie
breaker, 8-6. A despondent Green
then watched helplessly as Heiser
cruised through the third set, 6-0.
Kalvaria's three-set tussle was the
match of the tournament. After she
easily swept through the second set

6-2, she and Hazlett battled ruthless
ly in the third. Kalvaria grittily strug
gled through two match points, rally
ing from a 3-5 third-set deficit and
eventually forcing a third-set tie
breaker.
, Kalvaria was motivated by Heis
er's comeback and was determined
to mount one of her own.
"It just starts with one match to
build momentum. When you hear
the umpire say, 'Game, set. match
Stanford' and then a little later,
'Game, set, match Stanford' — it just
pumps you up so much. It really in
spired me when I saw Jennifer had
won, and she had been down three
match points in a row, and I had been
down two match points. It just fired
me up."
In the tie-breaker, Hazlett quick
ly jumped to a 4-1 lead, but a resilient
Kalvaria ripped off the next six
points to win the match and, more
importantly, give Stanford a 4-2 lead
alter singles action.
The win turned the tide of the
match.
"I think it is impossible to dupli
cate the feeling that you have when
you are down match point." Kalvaria
said. "Especially with the surround
ings here — it being a crucial match
in the championship with the Florida
fans. You have to play through it and
want it more. I now have 17 wins in a

row, and I wasn't going to let that
streak get snapped here at this time."
In doubles action, the duo of Irvin
and Tokuda clinched the 5-2 victory
for the Cardinal after closing out
their match, S-4.
A sore wrist kept Ashley, Irvin's
usual doubles partner, off the court.
Nonetheless, Irvin and Tokuda
quickly found their chemistry and
squelched the Gators' comeback bid.
After the match, the Stanford
women and head coach Frank Bren
nan were thrilled.
"I am truly in a state of shock,"
Brennan said. "We had a great group
of players and fighters and this is
what it takes to win a national cham
pionship. I can't be prouder of these
guys. They stayed loose through the
whole championship and that is why
we have the trophy. I probably un
derestimated this group. They are
very talented and very hard-nosed.
With four freshmen. I thought we
would have some ups and downs,
and this year wc would get seasoned
and learn what it's all about. Then
next year we would have a good
shot."
()! course, the Cardinal won't
have to wait until next year. With the
victory, the C ardinal avenged an ear
lier loss to the Gators this season and
snapped Florida's 61-home match
winning streak. Most importantly,
the women garnered a record 10th
NCAA championship.
"It was our day," Ashley said.
"It's unbelievable that we pulled this

out. No one really pegged us to take
this championship at the beginning
of the season. The four freshmen
played unbelievable. Jen Heiser
played so well. It was a tremendous
season."
Irvin agreed.
"The match today was unreal,"
she said. "The come-from-behind
wins were so inspiring."
Equally impressive was the Car
dinal's ability to remain focused as it
powered past Tennessee, USC and
California earlier in the weekend in
order to reach Sunday's final.
Aside from the frequent rain de
lays, Thursday's late-night en
counter with No. 16 Tennessee (18-
8) was rather uneventful. The Cardi
nal clinched the match in singles as
every player save Ashley took her
match in straight sets. No. 6 Tokuda
secured victory for the Cardinal with
a 6-2,6-2 rout of Tennessee's Meiling
Parks.
Ashley, the nation's seventh
ranked player, was hampered bv her
wrist injury during her 7-5,6-4 loss to
Tennessee's Alison Ojeda.
As a result, she sat out Friday's
match against USC (21-9). Without
one of its stars, the Cardinal was anx
ious about its match against the
Women of Troy.
Stanford's opponent, of course,
also had obstacles to overcome. USC
was competing with less than 12 1/2
hours of rest after its marathon
match against Miami didn't finish
until 3:29 a.m.

While the Cardinal took the
match by a score of 5-1, again clinch
ing the match in singles, several of
the singles contests were highly com
petitive.
The Cardinal recorded three
straight-set victories in the early go
ings to establish a comfortable lead.
At the No. 1 position, Irvin over
whelmed USC's Ditta Huber, 6-3,6-
2.
Lastra, playing at the No. 2 spot in
Ashley's absence, beat Kara
Warkentin, 6-0,7-6 (0), while sopho
more Sarah Pestieau, competing at
the No. 6 spot, downed USC's Krissy
Hamilton-Heinburg, 6-4,6-4.
Heiser's dramatic three-set loss at
the No. 4 position turned out to be
USC's sole victory. Kalvaria and
Tokuda both rebounded after suffer
ing a 4-6 first set loss to take their re
spective matches in three sets.
Saturday's semifinal encounter
with Pacific 10 Conference rival Cal
ifornia proved even more strenuous.
Ashley was again on the bench
tending to her wrist. Irvin, Kalvaria
and Tokuda, however, all quickly
wrapped up their matches in straight
sets.
The afternoon, though, was far
from over. Lastra took her match 7-5
in the third, while Pestieau was beat
en in three sets. Finally, Stanford
clinched the win with a 3-6,7-6 (5), 6-
4 victory at No. 4 singles. Heiser,
ranked 65th nationally, held off
Claire Curran (No. 98) in a three
hour, 15-minute battle.
