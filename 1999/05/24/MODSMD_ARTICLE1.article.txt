# Women's tennis crowned NCAA champs
## Cardinal fights through rain, hometown Florida to win record 10th NCAA title, Stanford's first of 1998-99 
### Bill Hanson Staff writer 
There's no doubt that the Stan
ford women's tennis team is a
young squad. With four freshmen in
the starting lineup, some people
might even call the team inexperi
enced. But yesterday, the second
seeded Stanford women displayed a
tenacious maturity in dismantling
the No. 1 University of Florida
Gators (31-2). 5-2.

With the victory, the Cardinal
captured the NCAA team title and
capped a remarkable season.
Yesterday's match, cut by a rain
delay midway through the after
noon. couldn't have been more dra
matic.
When the rain began to fall, the
Cardinal was in a precarious posi
tion and thus relished the opportuni
ty to rest and regroup.
While freshman and second
ranked Marissa Irvin overpowered

Florida's Whitney Laiho in the No. 1
singles match, 6-2, 6-1, junior Teryn
Ashley and freshman Gabby Lastra
succumbed to their respective oppo
nents in straight sets.
Ashley, who had sat out both the
quarterfinal and semifinal matches,
was visibly bothered by her sore left
wrist throughout her match.
When the players left the courts
to escape the rain, Florida enjoyed a
2-1 lead. Moreover, in the singles
matches that remained, Florida
boasted commanding leads.
Florida's Stephanie Hazlett won
the first set 7-6 (8-6) but was behind
4-0 in the second at the No. 4 posi
tion against Lauren Kalvaria. Gator
Traci Green won the opening set 6-4
and led 3-2 in the second set of her
No. 5 match against junior Jennifer
Heiser. At the No. 6 spot, Florida's
M.C. White lost the first set 6-3 but
enjoyed a 5-2 lead in the second set
of her match against freshman
KeikoTokuda.

Shockingly, Stanford managed to
pull out all three closely contested
matches after the 37-minute rain
delay.
Tokuda roared back for a straight
set triumph over White, capturing
four games in a row and wrapping up
the match, 6-3,7-6 (7-0).
Then, the drama intensified, as
both Heiser and Kalvaria found
themselves in compelling three-set
duels.
Heiser battled Green to a second
set tie-breaker, only to eventually
find herself down 3-6 — three match
points for Florida.
Calmly, Heiser saved all three
match points, soon taking the tie
breaker, 8-6. A despondent Green
then watched helplessly as Heiser
cruised through the third set, 6-0.
Kalvaria's three-set tussle was the
match of the tournament. After she
easily swept through the second set
