# NATO strikes cause weekend blackout

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Grop
ing for flashlights and explanations, Bel
graders stumbled through a long, dark week
end as NATO airstrikes deprived them of
another staple: electricity.
It was the Yugoslav capital's longest stretch
yet without power since the air campaign
began two months ago, and it left residents
numb with anger.
"It's humiliating, as if we were plunged
back into the primitiveness of the Middle
Ages," said Branka Nikolic, a doctor and
mother of two.
Nikolic, a general practitioner at the Bel
grade Clinical Center, the city's biggest hospi
tal, said the staff had struggled the night before
to get by on power from a backup generator.
The city of 2 million was spookilv quiet yes
terday, the silence broken in many areas only
by the patter of a steady rain that added to the
gloom. The story was the same across much of
Yugoslavia.
NATO shut the lights off before dawn yes
terday with a rocket attack that set ablaze the
country's biggest coal-burning power plant
near Obrenovac, 20 miles southwest of Bel
grade, local media reported.
Repair crews already had their hands full
trying to fix damage from a raid the previous
night on the nearby Kolubara station, the
country's oldest coal-fired plant. Serbian
media said four missiles struck the plant's
main distribution center and a nearby trans
former station, crippling it for weeks to come.
NATO says the power plants are legitimate
military targets because they provide electrici
ty that supports the war machine of President

Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo.
The attacks appear aimed at increasing
domestic pressure on Milosevic to accept a
Western-dictated peace plan for the embattled
province. But Belgrade residents say the
alliance is just vengeful.
"What do these NATO animals think?
They want to crush an entire nation." pianist
Buco Kovacevic said yesterday as he waited in
line for newspapers that were several hours
late.
Although the power company claimed late
Saturday to have restored electrical service to
20 percent of the city, the power was going
mostly to hospitals and other priority users. By
yesterday morning, however, the power was
out again to most of the city's neighborhoods
after the more recent attacks.
Many regions in Serbia and Belgrade also
were facing a serious water shortage because
of a lack of electricity needed to run the water
pumps.
Zora, 53, a Belgrade shop owner who
would not give her last name, said she pre
ferred to open her street-corner grocery store
rather than sit home alone in silence, staring at
a wall.
At Belgrade's flea market, in a modern res
idential area across the river from the city cen
ter, 35-year-old Rade Marinkovic found him
self starting to panic for the first time since the
airstrikes began.
Marinkovic, who said his 4-month-old
daughter had gone without warm milk for two
days, was searching for a miniature gas stove.
A salesman brushed him off, saying they had
sold out long ago.
