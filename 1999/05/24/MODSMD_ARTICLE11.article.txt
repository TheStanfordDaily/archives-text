## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF)—The Senate
intelligence committee chairman said yes
terday that Attorney General Janet Reno
should lose her job over the Justice
Department's failure to actively pursue
suspected Chinese spying in U.S. nuclear
energy labs.
Even an administration ally, Demo
cratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jer
sey, agreed Reno's job should be on the
line in light of a congressional report, due
for release this week, on Chinese espi
onage.
A Justice Department spokesman said
Reno believes she acted responsibly and
according to the Constitution.
A second Cabinet member. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, whose depart
ment oversees the labs, said tighter securi

ty measures were in place a( the labs and
it remained unclear what secrets were
stolen.
"We cannot overdramatize conclu
sions that are not conclusive yet," he said
on ABC's "This Week."
A select House committee under Rep.
Christopher Cox. R-Calif., plans to make
public tomorrow its findings on Chinese
attempts to buy and steal U.S. technology
for rocket launching and nuclear pro
grams.
The report's conclusions have filtered
out in recent weeks: that over the past two
decades. China has obtained sensitive
information about seven major weapons
in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
Republicans said someone must take
responsibility for the slow response to a

securitv breach at the Los Alamos nucle
ar weapons lab in New Mexico that first
came to light in 1995.
The Senate intelligence committee
chairman. Richard Shelby. R-Ala., point
ed to Reno, saying the attorney general
and her top lieutenants should go.
Senate Majority Leader l rent Lott, R-
Miss.. on CBS. agreed that "some heads
should roll." Somebody, he said, "made
some major mistakes here, and somebody
needs to be accountable."
GOP presidential hopelul Sen. Bob
Smith. R-N.l 1., said on ('NN's "1 ate Edi
tion" that he would press for a lull investi
gation and if officials "are held account
able. they are going to go to jail."
Torricelli. on ( BS. was nearly as criti
cal. savinu Reno's failure o! judgment in

the Los Alamos case was "inexplicable."
"I think it's time for President Clinton
to have a conversation with the attorney
general about ... whether or not it is in
the national interest for her to continue,"
he said.
The lawmakers specifically pointed to
the Justice Department's repeated denials
of requests by the FBI to wiretap Los
Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee. who is sus
pected of passing secrets to the Chinese.
The department said there were insuf
ficient grounds for a court order to moni
tor Wen. who was fired from the lab this
March, three years after he first came
under suspicion.
Justice Department spokesman Myron
Marlin said Reno had reviewed the deci
sion and fully supported it.
