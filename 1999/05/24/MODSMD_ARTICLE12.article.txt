# HMOs refuse to subsidize cost of popular medicines
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AF) — When Aetna Inc.
posted a better-than-expected first-quarter
profit last month, the nation's leading health
insurer trumpeted its success at curbing sky
rocketing prescription drug costs.
Here's Aetna's secret: In January, it
slopped routinely covering some of the most
popular medicines for many members.
Need Prozac for your depression? Sorry.
Want the No. 1 I J.S. cholesterol-lowering
drug* Lipitor? Too bad. Want the world's
prescription drug, Prilosec, to
treat-Jour ulcer? IJh-uh.
rhese arc among the l(>6 prescription
drugs that Aetna U.S. Healthcare requires
most of its members to buy themselves, or
pay for at a higher co-payment than the
druas»Aetna favors.
Nationwide, most large health plans have

also restricted coverage of some of the top
selling drugs in an effort to control costs. For
example, PacifiCare doesn't cover either of
the top two selling cholesterol-lowering med
ications, Zocor or Lipitor. Oxford Health
Flans, a major HMO in the Northeast,
charges some members a premium for the
leading allergy drug Claritin for adults.
HMO drug costs are expected to soar 20
percent this year, primarily because people
are using more medicines and the situation is
expected only to worsen. Overall health care
costs are expected to rise only 5 percent.
HMO executives say they have little
choice but to reduce access to many high
priced new drugs to keep annual premium
increases in single digits.
But that reasoning is of little comfort to
many consumers who are used to getting the

drug their doctor prescribes, or the medica
tion they have trusted for years to keep them
healthy.
"I feel like I've been penalized." said Bar
bara Lampert, 52. of suburban Chicago, who
had to switch insulin medications when she
joined Aetna in 1997.
Aetna and other HMOs say the\ often
make exceptions to allow members to get
coverage for excluded drugs if the preferred
drugs don't work or cause severe side effects.
Lampert. for example, was able to per
suade Aetna to pay for her Lipitor and
another diabetes drug, Rezulin.
But consumer advocates say patients
often have to work too hard to get the drugs
they need. And most consumers simply skip
the appeals process because they believe it's
skewed against them or is too cumbersome.

Aetna also c;ills doctors to ask them to
prescribe the lower cost drugs and sends
notices to members telling them how much
they could save bv switching.
But such steps can be a tough sell because
of pharmaceutical makers' heavy consumer
advertising and frequent sales \ isits to physi
cians' offices.
"It takes more of an educational effort on
our part." said Dr. Nicholas Hanchak.
Aetna's drug program manager.
Some consumers have no complaints
after being persuaded or forced to switch
drugs by their health plan.
This spring. Paul Fronstin's health itisui
er. the George Washington University
I leallh Plan, wanted to charge him more for
the allergy drug Claritin that he'd taken for
four vcars. So Fronstin. a Washington D.C.-

based employee benefits researcher,
switched to a newer drug, Zyrtec.
"I tried it...and it works," he said.
When Aetna started to exclude Prozac in
January, it's policy applied only to new mem
bers.
"It came down to cost," said Hanchak.
Aetna's drug program manager, noting the
company believed the alternative drugs it
covers are equal in benefit.
"I think this is terribly risky and even the
HMOs' doctors must know these types of
drugs are not interchangeable," said Jim
Coleman, a coordinator with the Recovery
Initiative, a Cincinnati mental health advoca
cy group.
"It's one of the biggest problems I have in
dealing with managed care," said Dr. Lee
Me( 'ormick, a Pittsburgh family doctor.
