Bizarre Draw results
confirm impossibility
of making it truly fair

THE DRAW IS truly a fickle
mistress for Stanford stu
dents.
With a number of big surprises
popping up in the Draw statistics
this year, we are left to ponder the
results in light of the recent changes
to the process. In the final analysis,
has anything really improved?
Receiving Draw numbers ahead
of time and having the option to stay
together as a group certainly make
the Draw process easier for some
students.
Hut for the majority of students,
who justifiably seek any means to
connive their way into the residence
of their fancy, the system is just as
complicated and just as rife with
loopholes to wriggle through.
This year, Draw-related quag
mires ranged from disputes over the
awarding of priority to ever more
complex problems involving the new
Freshman / Sophomore Residential
College.
The College, in particular,
brought up unique issues in this
year's Draw.
Students with both types of prior
ity were assigned, as well as many
who did not pursue the priority sta
tus that was supposedly requisite for
drawing into the two Sterling Quad
houses where the program will be
located.
At the very least, the houses
required a preferred Draw number,
so most of the students living there
will not do so entirely against their
will.
Furthermore, we are very wary of
the atmosphere that will be created
for incoming junior transfer students
if their small ranks are assigned to

one or both of the College's houses.
The University's plans for making
an ideal place for transfers are
already in jeopardy thanks to the
lack of a critical mass of accepted
transfers; locating them in a special
program far from the geographic
and social center of campus cannot
possibly help their adjustment.
Reflecting on the almost surreal
results of this year's Draw, what
comes first to mind is the well-worn
cliche: the more things change, the
more they stay the same.
Whereas last year it was impossi
ble to sneak into any of the houses
on the north end of the Row without
a cushy staff position or a very good
Draw number, this year singles
squeezed in with Draw numbers that
were almost unpreferred.
This was a function of the "stick
together" option, which created
small gaps in some of the most
sought-after residences on campus
when many large groups refused to
be truncated.
Similar to last year, however, is
the unpredictable nature of the
Draw, which seems to continually
exceed the irrationality inherent in a
random selection process.
Landing a spot in one of Stan
ford's finer housing options has
always been an inexact science. Now,
it seems like an art form.
Ways to outsmart the system have
always existed; now they just seem
to be more complex.
A variety of options are generally
always a good thing, but with the
Draw's growing complexity, we may
have begun overdoing it.
C hanging the Draw to make it
more equitable is increasingly
daunting in light of this year's statis
tics.
Perhaps the only possible coping
method for Stanford students in
avoiding Draw-induced angst is not
to take the process too seriously.
