# Ruminations
## Finding that one true thing 
### 
IT HAS BEEN my
intention to provide a
little food for thought
here and there, perhaps
the impetus for a discus
sion.
I promised, upon begin
ning, not to write about the

soap in the soap dispensers and have tried to
keep my loved ones out of print. And so at
the end of the spring, it's the perfect time to
reflect on what the last year has meant for
you, a chance to plumb the depths of your
psyche in the interest of discovering change
or growth.
It's a little like a commencement speech
for your year, isn't it? Take the knowledge
and experiences you have earned while on
the Farm and turn the world upside-down, or
something to that effect. But less than the
swan song of your year, let these last few
days bring together your best, which can be
then brought into the coming months.
Our environment provides us with the
constant chance to regroup and re-evaluate
before making decisions. We are always
encouraged to capitalize on our capabilities
and make the best of the talents we've dis
covered. But before we can take on the
world, we have to take on ourselves and
allow a little contemplation in the interest of
not letting this academic year pass on with
out remark or remembrance.
People say that you learn more just living
these years than you could ever remember or
absorb in a classroom, that college is what
teaches you who you are, what you need
from other people and so forth.
It shapes you irreversibly. And so if upon

reflection at the year's end, you see no
change and feel no place where you have
encountered any challenge, remember that
such things are not always readily evident.
Last summer's experience of thinking my
heart was broken into itty bitty pieces has
made the love I have found this year all the
sweeter, just as the roadblocks I've hit this
year have helped me learn which battles are
really necessary to fight. But I never knew it
at the time — we never will.
Perhaps that is one of the more difficult
aspects of this part of our lives — there is
some latent, unspoken awareness that the
things we do are indeed important, but we
can never really know. We choose at once
with abandon but with trepidation because
of it. It's kind of like life is sneaking up on
you, and before you know it, you'll be fin
ished with this chapter and on to the next, no
looking back.
Being forced into choices (as anyone who
has received a letter from the registrar about
declaring a major by junior year is familiar
with) does force us to get things done. But
we grapple with the problem of agency —
whom are we doing all of this work for, who
will reap the benefits, and will any of it real
ly be useful?
But if you are turning to these questions,
something is already happening. Perhaps a
quiet sense of foreboding, but a tentative
excitement. Pessimism is convenient at times
like this. It lets you off the hook by providing
your future with a downhill sort of inertia,
useful in tempering enthusiasm but also in
fostering doubt. Get rid of it. Not in the inter
est of letting your brain become a happy
clean slate — being critical is great — but

Mari Webel;

because it automatically turns the very nec
essary internal and private questioning \ye
must all do into a sort of mental paralysis.
As great as our potential may be, the
measure of that latent unawareness exceeds
it tenfold. And although not realizing how
g(xxl we've got it may give authoritative
types something to crow about, it's a fine set
of circumstances. Maybe acknowledging that
we proceed unaware through life would
insert a sense of wonder that we wouldn't
have if we knew now what we will know
later. Maybe we'd just get tired of thinking
about it.
But really, apart from the rhetorical gym
nastics that we can bounce through in exam
ining our lives, the important thing to take
home at the end of the day is that we do
make our own lives happen. We have poten
tial. We have creative power. We have
chances rolling out before us like the world's
own red carpet heralding our arrival. We
have a summer before us to work with and
possibility, always possibility.
Do not think that simply because you
have not yet found the thing which taps your
reserve of creativity and stamina and intel
lectual energy that you are not challenging
yourself. Likewise, if you think you've found
that "one thing," don't be so over-confident
as to think that everything will follow in the
same fashion. Don't expect to know it now,
whatever it is that gets to you, but do expect
to learn it.

and this of all times she would like to thank
Michael, for everything.
