Daily should cover real news
I am writing in response to Thursday's
front-page article about Ehud Barak ("We
knew him when"), which was more nearly
about the Masters in engineering-econom
ic systems that Barak received at Stanford
before he was worthy of being mentioned
in The Daily.
The column kicker, "Farm remembers
Israel's Barak as grad student," should
have read "Daily remembers to fill space
with an article that doesn't do justice to its
newsworthiness."
Ciranted, The Daily is a campus paper
and ought to stick to campus issues, but
this just goes to show that we at Stanford
are more likely to lay claim to the same
oxygen supply that a famous person once
breathed than to take the time to know
what's going on in the world.

Writing in the fourth century, Saint
Gregory the Theologian explained:
"When you desire education, you desire
the best thing in your life; education
guides you to virtue which is the beauty of
the mind and the beauty of your soul —
education brings you near God who is the
Divine source of truth, goodness, everlast
ing life and happiness."
Having been instructed in numerous
disciplines, this Father of the Christian

Church could boast such an ideal. Yet,
some 16 centuries later, the pursuit for
human perfection, that is, a thorough
moral, intellectual, emotional and spiritu
al development of the human personality,
has all hut lost its luster for the masses
who clamor to master a specialization.
Although the patristic philosophy of
education is not as prominent today, the
ideals that were once extolled are still held
in esteem by countless "educators" that
function in the university.
These "educators" have many forms of
address and their pupils come from
diverse backgrounds.
While they are united in a common phi
losophy, they are also the religious leaders
— priests, rabbis, imams — that coordi
nate many of the campus ministries high
lighted in The Daily's May 14 article "Fel
lowship on the Farm."
Since 19% I have had the good fortune
of coordinating the Orthodox Christian
Fellowship that has been on campus for
some seven years (recognized in the
Spring of 1997 by SAR as an official cam
pus ministry).
As a Greek Orthodox clergyman, I
minister to the needs of our multiethnic
population that unite under the umbrella
of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Work
ing alongside these religious leaders has
been encouraging since they too present
an educational curriculum for the Stan
ford community that, in the words of St.
Gregory, "brings [them] near to God who
is the Divine source of truth, goodness,
everlasting life and happiness."
For the Orthodox, like other Christian

traditions at Stanford, we regularly gather
in fellowship. Our members, regardless of
academic discipline, ethnicity or socioeco
nomic status, attempt to preserve the com
mon tenets and practices of the faith as
handed down from one generation to the
next, as suggested by the aforementioned
article.
This is a noble undertaking indeed
when placed within the context of the Uni
versity and her demands for academic
excellence.
The success of a particular ministry, in
our case the Orthodox Christian Fellow
ship, and the growth of religiosity amidst
academia is ironically dependent though
upon none other than the University.
Fortunately for us, we have been warm
ly received by former Dean of Religious
Life Bob Gregg: encouraged to our end
within the supportive environment of
SAR by the interim dean, Rev. Kelly Den
ton-Borhaug; and recognized in Meredith
Rowe's Daily article.
It seems that Orthodox Christianity has
found a place on campus.
In turn. 1 offer my gratitude to the Stan
ford community that has acknowledged
the value of a holistic education, affording
me the opportunity to stand with these
educators, who in the spirit of St. Gregory,
cultivate the spiritual, rational, moral and
emotional potential of our students.
