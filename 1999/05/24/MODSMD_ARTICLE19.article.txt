# Where we are
## A 						parting plea for academic integrity

David Stein

THE NUMBER OF speeches
beseeching us graduates in the fol
lowing weeks to save the world,
despite the countless forces aligned to make
ths salvation impossible, to follow our indi
vidual passions, despite our responsibilities
to family, community and state, to inhale the
richness of life, despite the hurtling progress
of change, will be countless, and 1 do not
wish to add my voice to the cacophony of
tempered inspiration.
Nor do I wish to offer a laundry list of the
things I've learned here. My experience, like
anyone else's, has been unique, and any
touchstone of common feeling I happen to
hit upon would seem to me as if 1 only knew
how to draw on the well of cliche. I could tell
you how much I've grown as a person or
how much I've learned about my classmates,
but these lessons are really only things I will
profit from or that you. alas, must discover
for yourself.
[•'lnstead, I'll address those we leave
tyejiind, those who must scrape our celebra
tory goo from the sandstone and retreat
once more into the interminable cycle of the
academic calendar, for thev are the ones

who constitute Stanford University, not us.
whose addresses, phone numbers. P.O.
Boxes and all other official forms of identifi
cation will be handed over unceremoniously
next year to 1,600 new hollow vessels too
eager for glory and too susceptible to disillu
sion.
Let us begin with those who devise new
academic programs. Do not think that your
flowery additions over the past four years
will generate a sea change of intellectual
development. Transforming Cultures, Ideas
and Values into the bare-bones Introduction
to tiie H' inanities track, with its emphasis
on critical thinking rather than the acquisi
tion of a historical and cultural sensibility,
invokes T.S. Eliot's damning plea, "Where is
the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?" for
you have sentenced the freshman class to
become technicians, not scholars. If a series
of seminal texts cannot be mastered by the,
ahem, best minds of a generation, then
please admit students who can accept the
requisite discipline of an education, or else,
fail the ones who cannot embrace this chal
lenge.
Indeed, the absence of failure at this

school detracts more from a student's edu
cation than any ill-conceived courses. Stu
dents arrive here as some of the most aggres
sively persistent, diligent 18-year-olds alive,
and yet they quickly learn that sliding by
does not translate into academic defeat.
Books can be skimmed, essays dashed off,
tests crammed for, and while the conse
quences won't be excellent, they won't be
exactly terrible either. Earning acceptable
grades is almost ridiculously easy here, but
"ease" and "acceptable" seem to be two
terms incompatible with the evolution of the
intellect. Professors, hang the threat of fail
ure over the heads of your students, substi
tute fear for a genuine love of learning that
has become so scarce as to be nonexistent
and hopefully their desire for knowledge,
which once gained for them admittance to
this University, will appear, if not blossom,
once again.
Moreover, while the addition of Stanford
Introductory Studies provides a much, much
needed link between faculty and students,
be wary of the seminar format in general.
One does not go to a baseball stadium to
watch the batboys play, and likewise, stu-

dents should not have to sit through a two
hour seminar or 5()-minute section to listen
to the uninformed babblings of undergradu
ates. We pay to be exposed to experts and
share in the insights they have secured after
years of rigorous study, not those of Susie or
John who, having read Plato an hour before
class, scramble desperately to say something
to bolster their class participation grades.
Learning for the immature, among whom 1
include myself, is often through a process of
imitation, but the imitation of ignorance and
silence, which all of us must endure at least
once a week, can only lead to absurdity.
I've stressed our formal academic experi
ence in my farewell column because, in the
final analysis, I feel this is the most signifi
cant aspect of our time spent here and hence
the one thing I'd most like to see bettered. 1
know many would disagree.
Most would say that the relationships
formed among friends overwhelm the aca
demic experience, and in part, 1 would con
cur. The diversity and immediacy of emo
tion. the exchange of cultures, the depth of
exploration — all these will probably remain
forever unmatched. But in that case, those

most beautiful elements of the friendships
created here, though lasting beyond our
graduation, will also remain somehow
restricted to our pasts, for we can't take
them with us and must savor them only in
our memories.
But the academic experience, if fully real
ized, does not stay behind. It continues to
reinvent itself, shaping the intellect and
encouraging the will. More important,
though, it serves as the only defense of the
self. For, if we must characterize the world
we live in.it is a world of assimilation and
absorption, where powers larger than our
selves seek to snatch us away and commit us
to agendas different than our own. This
seizure is not possible 1 believe — if I believe
anything at all — as long as the integrity of
mind, which I've granted you. Stanford, to
give me, remains, unyielding.

He is moving to Boston next year, fearful of
the weather but grateful for the companion
ship. To you, Stanford, to you, Palo Alto, I
say thank you, thank you and goodbye.
