# Unfair play in disability housing Draw?
## 
### Sarah Rapawy Staff writer 
With the Draw on the forefront of students' minds this
weekend, many are questioning the procedures of the dis
ability Draw held earlier this month.
Some students who participate in the disability Draw
do not believe that their needs are met, the goal of the spe
cial system. The dissatisfaction of some may be partly a
product of unrealistic expectations — students assuming
that the disability Draw ensures prime campus housing.
Others are debating whether students should be
ranked in the disability Draw according to their disability.
They question what degree of special treatment, if any.
should be afforded students with less obvious or less tra
ditionally recognized disabilities, such as food allergies,

eating disorders ancLasthma.
And with the advantages of two-room doubles and
Row house food at stake, some suggest that the disability
Draw is abused by students without a true "disability."
Freshman Sophia Lin, a disability Draw participant
whose needs required a single, has heard stories of abuse.
"1 know somebody whose friend's father, who is a doc
tor, faxed a note to prove needs for the Draw.. .the father
doesn't even know who this kid is,"
she said.
"In trying to be open-minded, dis
ability Draw is easy to abuse," she
added.
Teri Adams, disability specialist
at the Disability Resource Center,
evaluates the needs of disability
Draw applicants. Students must fill
out a form and provide medical doc
umentation, requesting accommoda
tions, such as a single room, open
kitchen or wheel chair accessibility.
Adams stated that medical docu
mentation is key to the approval
process. "If I was suspicious and [the
applicants] had good documenta
tion, I would not turn them down,"
she said.
Although Adams claims to ac
commodate more rather than less,
she is confident that few students
take advantage of the system. She es

timated less than 5 percent of the ap
proximately 200 applications she ap
proves annually are not legitimate. •'
While some have no problems
proving their disabilities, others have
been unsuccessful in convincing thd
DRC. An anonymous diabetic fresh
man who struggles with her insulin
count has been unable to demon-'
strate her need for an open kitchen. ■>'
Before coming to college, her he
moglobin A count had always fallen'
in a normal range. However, it has'
risen one and a half times in the past
year at Stanford.
"On an insulin pump, I have t6
count the exact number of carbohy
drates in the food I'm eating. Know
ing if there are 65 or 45 grams in the'
lasagna makes a huge difference, arid'
I need to talk to a chef to get that in-'
formation," she said.
She has encountered difficulty ac
quiring such information from Uni
versity Dining Services.
Although this student submitted
two letters from endocrinologists and
one from a nutritionist, her Draw
group was placed in Yost House. Din
ing Services provides meals at Yost;
the student said its open kitchen is "a
joke."
"The DRC said my documenta
tion didn't necessitate being off Uni
versity Dining. They told me 70 per
cent of campus wants to be off Uni
versity Dining," she said.
An anonymous junior diagnosed
with attention deficit disorder also
had documentation problems. She
has experienced sleep and concentra
tion problems while living with room
mates.
"I'm prescribed at Cowell for Ri
talin but not registered with the DRC.
I couldn't get documentation from
Cowell because it was my doctor
from home that originally diagnosed
me, but my doctor from home is relo
cating and couldn't find documenta

tion quickly," she said.
Another member of the same
group is diabetic and needs an open
kitchen. The group successfully docu
mented the diabetic's needs and was
led to believe that, if the application
made special note of the other mem
ber's problems with ADD, all needs
would be met. However, the group
was assigned to 717 Dolores, a house
with largely one-room doubles.
Even when disability needs are
met, many say housing assignments
are not a fair reflection of Draw num
bers. After the DRC determines
needs, disability Draw groups are as
signed random numbers and list their
first eight housing choices. Similar to
the normal Draw, numbers reflect
whether a group has drawn preferred
or unpreferred and any acquired pri
orities.
Mike Ginsberg, a senior with a
learning disability, needs a single to
concentrate. After his freshman year,
he drew 7(X), but ended up in Roble
Hall, where he has lived ever since.
"After that year, I never even
asked what my Draw number was,"

he said. Despite the disparity be
tween his Draw number and the as
signment to Ruble, which traditional
ly draws much worse, Ginsberg said
he "still generally thinks the DRC
does a good job."
Lin also questioned why her group
was placed in American Studies
house, an option that was not on their
preference list, with a Draw number
of 1,609. "My only requirement was
that I needed a single. We listed pref
erences that 1,609 would've gotten us
into ... we even put down Roble,"
she said.
Lin said that many students who
enter the disability Draw become
upset because they do not understand
the process.
"1 thought the process was un
clear. I didn't realize you get a ran
dom number and are placed [accord
ing to] that," she said.
Lin added that dissatisfaction
often results from unrealistic expec
tations.
"A lot of people enter the disabili
ty Draw thinking it will ensure them
better housing and exempt them

from the randomness of the process,"
she said.
And some, hoping for better hous
ing, "say they require what aren't re
ally requirements."
The diabetic freshman who was
placed in Yost knows her assignment
is largely due to her group's Draw
number of 1,489.
She was upset to hear of another
eight-person group that drew into 680
Lomita with a Draw number of 1,100.
She expected the house to draw much
better.
The group needs an open kitchen
due to a group member's allergy to
peanuts.
Although the group originally
drew into 717 Dolores, two of the
group's non-disabled members are
basketball players and are too tall for
the rooms there.
The freshman stated that the
group's move to 680 Lomita was in
consistent with DRC policy.
"They told us the only way you can
get your group moved is if the dis
abled person's needs aren't met. It's
frustrating," she said.

preference list, with a Draw number
of 1,609. "My only requirement was
that I needed a single. We listed pref
erences that 1,609 would've gotten us
into ... we even put down Roble,"
she said.
Lin said that many students who
enter the disability Draw become
upset because they do not understand
the process.
"1 thought the process was un
clear. I didn't realize you get a ran
dom number and are placed [accord
ing to] that," she said.
Lin added that dissatisfaction
often results from unrealistic expec
tations.
"A lot of people enter the disabili
ty Draw thinking it will ensure them
better housing and exempt them

from the randomness of the process,"
she said.
And some, hoping for better hous
ing, "say they require what aren't re
ally requirements."
The diabetic freshman who was
placed in Yost knows her assignment
is largely due to her group's Draw
number of 1,489.
She was upset to hear of another
eight-person group that drew into 680
Lomita with a Draw number of 1,100.
She expected the house to draw much
better.
The group needs an open kitchen
due to a group member's allergy to
peanuts.
Although the group originally
drew into 717 Dolores, two of the
group's non-disabled members are
basketball players and are too tall for
the rooms there.
The freshman stated that the
group's move to 680 Lomita was in
consistent with DRC policy.
"They told us the only way you can
get your group moved is if the dis
abled person's needs aren't met. It's
frustrating," she said.
