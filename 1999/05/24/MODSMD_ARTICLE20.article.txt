To he successful in the marathon
that is the lbur-month, 56-game col
lege hasehall regular season, teams
must he enduring and persistent.
And. to position themselves for the
sprint that organizers like to call the
NCAA hasehall tournament, teams
must finish in style.

BASEBALL
■ Saturday: No. 4 Stanford (43-13)
12. (al Poly San Luis Obispo (21-34)
<■).
■ Friday: Stanford 13, Cal I'oly San
I ,uis Ohispo 2.

Taking a cue from many of Stan
ford'sdominant distance runners, the
fourth-ranked baseball team ran a
nearly perfect race this year, staying
at the front of the national pack all
season long while still saving its
biggest kick for the end.
Capping off a year in which the
Cardinal (43-13) posted its highest
winning percentage in nine years and
won the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship by two games over the de
fending national champion, Stanford
won 15 of its final 16 games — includ
ing a three-game sweep of Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo last weekend.
The series against the Mustangs
allowed Stanford to showcase the va
riety of ways it has beaten opponents
all year.
Thursday, neither team could put
runs on the board for the first four in

nings. However, the Cardinal reeled
off eight runs in the next four to blow
out Cal Poly 8-1.
Friday night, Stanford's offense
was explosive from the beginning and
the team cruised to a 13-2 demoral
ization of the Mustangs.
In the regular-season finale Satur

day afternoon, the Cardinal played
catchup until an eight-run eighth in
ning propelled the team to a 12-9
comeback win.
Now riding the momentum of
such a finish, the team is ready to start
its "second season," regardless of
who the NCAA baseball committee

decides to send to Sunken Diamond
tomorrow for next weekend's first
round regional.
"We've been finding a way to win
all year long, regardless of the score
or how we're hitting or pitching," said

junior first baseman John Gall. "We
can look awful at times and come
back and win ball games. It's the
mark of a really good team."
Senior third baseman Josh
I lochgesang, who was named to the
All-Pac-10 team Friday along with
sophomore right fielder Joe Bor
chard. Gall and sophomore pitcher
Jason Young, also expressed his en
thusiasm with the spirit of the team.
"I've been here four years so I've
seen it all." he said. "And last year es
pecially we had a team that dominat
ed, and were supposed to. This year,
we have no real superstars but we are
still finding a way to win. At the end
of the season, we are right up there, in
terms of win-loss record, with last
year's team (41-12-1 regular season).
"And this year, we've got a little
bit more character than before. If
we're down, it doesn't matter, we'll
find a way to come back."
Saturday was a perfect example of

that mindset.
Freshman starter Brian Sager al
lowed Cal Poly's senior shortstop
Craig Ritter to put the Mustangs on
the hoard early.
Ritter. who only had two home
runs entering the game, pulled a
three-run home run over the left field
wall in the top of the second inning
and jacked a solo shot in the fifth to
give the team a 4-2 lead.
Then, just when Stanford catcher
Damien Alvarado tied the game at
four with a double to left-center field,
Cal Poly struck right back.
Junior right-hander Austin Coose
began the seventh inning in relief of
Sager and promptly gave up two runs
on two hits. In the eighth, Ritter
slapped an RBI double to right field
off of senior reliever Tony Cogan to
give the Mustangs a three-run lead.
However, as it has done all year,
Stanford clawed back. Actually, it
roared back.
Stringing together six singles, two
doubles and two walks, Stanford put
eight important runs on the board to
take a decisive 12-7 lead.
