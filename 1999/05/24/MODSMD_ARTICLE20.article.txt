Taking a cue from many of Stan
ford'sdominant distance runners, the
fourth-ranked baseball team ran a
nearly perfect race this year, staying
at the front of the national pack all
season long while still saving its
biggest kick for the end.
Capping off a year in which the
Cardinal (43-13) posted its highest
winning percentage in nine years and
won the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship by two games over the de
fending national champion, Stanford
won 15 of its final 16 games — includ
ing a three-game sweep of Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo last weekend.
The series against the Mustangs
allowed Stanford to showcase the va
riety of ways it has beaten opponents
all year.
Thursday, neither team could put
runs on the board for the first four in

nings. However, the Cardinal reeled
off eight runs in the next four to blow
out Cal Poly 8-1.
Friday night, Stanford's offense
was explosive from the beginning and
the team cruised to a 13-2 demoral
ization of the Mustangs.
In the regular-season finale Satur

day afternoon, the Cardinal played
catchup until an eight-run eighth in
ning propelled the team to a 12-9
comeback win.
Now riding the momentum of
such a finish, the team is ready to start
its "second season," regardless of
who the NCAA baseball committee

decides to send to Sunken Diamond
tomorrow for next weekend's first
round regional.
"We've been finding a way to win
all year long, regardless of the score
or how we're hitting or pitching," said
