## Florida product makes Gators pay 
### Pat Dooley Special to The Stanford Daily 
She moved to Gainesville trom
Cape Town, South Alrica. as a six
year old and almost immediately
took up the game of tennis.
Lauren Kalvaria hit her lirst ten
nis ball at the old courts in the shad
ow of Florida's football stadium,
then graduated her game to West
side Park where she honed her
skills with pro Joyce Oransky.
And when it came time, as a se
nior at Boca Raton Prep, to choose
which school she'd play tennis lor,
there was only one choice.
Florida had it all — ere-" tennis
program, great tennis coach, great
weather.
"My only thought was that I was
going to Florida," she said.
So what was Kalvaria doing rip
pi n g the heart of the Florida
women's tennis team on Sunday?
"I figured 1 couldn't visit just
one place,"she said. "1 checked out
Duke and I checked out Stanford.
It was really weird. I'd never lived
in California, I didn't know hardly
anything about Stanford. But when
I visited there, it just felt right."
The tennis courts she first
played on are gone now, but
Kalvaria, who lived in Gainesville
from 1 l )86 to 1990 before moving to
Indialantic. made a triumphant re

turn.
Her three-set win over Florida's
Stephanie Hazlett was the turning
point in Stanford's 5-2 win over the
Gators in the NCAA title mateh.
Kalvaria turned hack four match
points to earn the crucial victory
and give the Cardinal a 4-2 lead
going into doubles. Which was no
surprise and yet a total surprise to
her coach Frank Brennan.
"I've had a half-dozen parents
come up to me and say Lauren
Kalvaria is the toughest kid they
have ever seen," Brennan said. \

"Then they'd tell me some story
from the Orange Bowl or the East
er Bowl. Today, you saw it. She's
very tough."
"But when the other player has a
match point, I'm saying we've lost
that one."
But Kalvaria didn't, instead gut
ting out a 6-7, 6-2. 7-6 victory, her
17th straight dual match win.
"I started thinking about the
streak I had going," she said. "I de
cided I'm not going to let that
streak get snapped here."
Kalvaria, one of four freshmen'
who played singles for Stanford,
trailed 5-3 in the deciding set before
fighting off the four match points
and forcing a tiebreaker. In the
tiebreaker, she fell behind 4-1 be

fore running off six straight points
to win the match at No. 4 singles.
"We had both played a lot of
tough points," she said. "1 knew it
was going to be tight. I guess I was
just tougher."
