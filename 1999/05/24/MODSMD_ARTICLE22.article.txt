Making its first appearance in an NCAA final site,
Baylor (20-3) upset the Cardinal (25-3), snapping Stan
lord's IS match winning streak in postseason play. This is
the earliest exit from a final in 16 years for the ('ardinal,
except in l l >S2 and 1987, when it failed to make the finals.
Saturday's match also snapped Stanford's nine-match
winning streak this season.
The ( ardinal won the doubles point and took a 2-0
match lead when sophomore Ali Ansari won his match
ai the No. 6 singles spot, but the Bears fought back to
win four consecutive singles matches and clinch the
match.
"Baylor came at lis well," said Stanford head coach
Dick Gould. "We knew we needed to win the doubles

point, but we also knew that win was no guarantee. They
just closed the door when we were trying to come back. I
feel for my guys. We came in here and did the best we
c< >uld. We fought hard all season long and I only hope our
guys don't define the year by this loss."
Although the loss to Baylor was highly unexpected,
the Cardinal knew coming into the match that the Bears
were a team that could have been seeded a lot higher than
15. Baylor was ranked as high as No. 4 earlier in the sea
son and it showed the potential to beat any team in the na
tion.
"We definitely didn't take them lightly," said sopho
more Alex Kim. "We knew they were a dangerous first
round, and we also knew anything can happen in
Athens."
The match started out in the Cardinal's favor as it won
the doubles point that it had been struggling with all sea
son long. 1 leading into the singles it looked as if Stanford
held the momentum, especially after Ansari defeated
Mark Williams of Baylor 6-3,7-5 in the No. 6 singles spot
to give the Cardinal a 2-0 lead.
It was after Ansari's match that everything began to
change. Senior leader Ryan Wolters. the ("ardinal's No. I
singles player and the N0.4 player in the nation, then lost
4-6, 6-7 (4-7) to Baylor's Johann Jooste. Jooste broke
once in the first set to take the lead and both players were

on serve until the second set tiebreaker.
Jooste was leading the tiebreaker 4-2 when Wolters
was overruled on a questionable line call. That was the
key point in the match, as it was not only a huge point, it
also was an emotional blow to Wolters. Jooste then
closed out the tiebreaker and the match 7-4.
The Cardinal was still leading the match 2-1 until
sophomore Scotty Scott fell to Baylor's Johannes Michal
sky 4-6, 6-3, 3-6 in the No. 5 singles position. Scott was
starting to play well in the second set but appeared to
come out rather tentative in the third set. He was not hit
ting the ball deep enough and Michalksy took advantage
by playing aggressive tennis and taking control of the
match.
With the match tied at 2-2, freshman K.J. Hippensteel
was battling in the third set of his match against David
Hodge. Hippensteel had won the first set 6-4. lost a close
second set 5-7 and was even in the third. The key point in
the match came at 3-3 and deuce on HippensteePs serve
when Hodge was forced way wide by a Hippensteel vol
ley but managed to hit a brilliant passing backhand shot
down the line.
Hodge used the momentum from that backhand and
service break to go on to win the final two games and take
the match 6-3 in the third. It was only Hippensteel's sec
ond loss all season in a dual match. Like Scott, Hippen

steel too appeared to play a little timidly in the third set.
and Hodge capitalized by charging the net.
Trailing 3-2, the Cardinal knew it had to win the re
maining two singles matches to avoid elimination. Junior
Geoff Abrams was on serve in his third set against Bay
lor's Pawel Gajdzik. Kim was down a break in the third
set against the Bears' Jorge Aldret.
Abrams was never able to finish his match as Aldret
won the third set against Kim and clinched the match fro
Baylor. Kim had saved two sets points in the first set to
come back and win it 7-5, but was unable to work his
magic again in the third. His final score was 7-5, 4-6,3-6.
Abrams' match was stopped on serve at 5-4 in the third
set.
This loss was a blow to all of the Cardinal's players and
its two coaches, but lone senior Ryan Wolters appeared,
to take the loss especially hard. It was his final team col
lege match ever for the Cardinal, and it ended his run of
three consecutive national championships.
"I'm lost for words right now," he said. "When you
know how it feels to win, it is that much harder to lose.
Baylor just plain beat us. They came in thinking they
could win and they did just that. 1 won't let this ending to!
my career cloud all of the amazing moments, though. I'll!
always look back with fond memories. It has been an
amazing lour years, and I'll miss this team a lot."
