SOFTBALL
■ Saturday: Fresno State (62-8) 5,
Stanford (40-25) 2.

While it was defense that kept
Stanford alive in its heartbreaking
loss Thursday against Paeific, it was
inconsistent defense that cost the
team against the Bulldogs.
With Stanford committing four er
rors, only one of Fresno State's five
runs was earned. Senior pitcher
Becky Blevins (19-13) held the Hull
dogs to only three hits, hut the hits
came at opportune times.
"When we put I he hall in play and
forced a few mistakes by them, we
had to take advantage of them be
cause you don't get many breaks in
those kind of games," said Fresno
State head coach Margie Wright.
Fresno State put itself on the

board witli two runs in the bottom of
the third inning. Bulldog sophomore
Alicia Dowland reached first base on
a fielder's choice and was moved to
second on a sacrifice bunt. With two
outs and Dowland on second, sopho
more Becky Witt hit a bouncer down
the third base line. The ball appeared
to bounce foul past third base, but the
home plate umpire ruled the ball fair,
saying it bounced over the corner of
the bag.
As there were two outs, Dowland
was running on contact and by the
time left fielder Jennie Fovle's throw
reached home, Dowland was safe for
a run. ()n the confusion of the play, as
the Cardinal initially believed the ball
to be foul, Witt rounded the bases all
the way to third.
With the packed stadium in an up
roar, an argument ensued between
Stanford head coach John Rittman
and the umpire, and Rittman was
thrown out of the game.
Freshman Vanessa Czarnecki fol
lowed with a slap to third, and was
safe at first on an overthrow. The
error allowed Witt to cross the plate
and the inning ended with Fresno
State up 2-0.
On the mound against the Cardi
nal was Bulldog ace, junior Amanda
Scott (27-3). With a 0.24 ERA enter
