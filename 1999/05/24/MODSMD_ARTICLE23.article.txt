■ Saturday: Fresno State (62-8) 5,
Stanford (40-25) 2.

While it was defense that kept
Stanford alive in its heartbreaking
loss Thursday against Paeific, it was
inconsistent defense that cost the
team against the Bulldogs.
With Stanford committing four er
rors, only one of Fresno State's five
runs was earned. Senior pitcher
Becky Blevins (19-13) held the Hull
dogs to only three hits, hut the hits
came at opportune times.
"When we put I he hall in play and
forced a few mistakes by them, we
had to take advantage of them be
cause you don't get many breaks in
those kind of games," said Fresno
State head coach Margie Wright.
Fresno State put itself on the

board witli two runs in the bottom of
the third inning. Bulldog sophomore
Alicia Dowland reached first base on
a fielder's choice and was moved to
second on a sacrifice bunt. With two
outs and Dowland on second, sopho
more Becky Witt hit a bouncer down
the third base line. The ball appeared
to bounce foul past third base, but the
home plate umpire ruled the ball fair,
saying it bounced over the corner of
the bag.
As there were two outs, Dowland
was running on contact and by the
time left fielder Jennie Fovle's throw
reached home, Dowland was safe for
a run. ()n the confusion of the play, as
the Cardinal initially believed the ball
to be foul, Witt rounded the bases all
the way to third.
With the packed stadium in an up
roar, an argument ensued between
Stanford head coach John Rittman
and the umpire, and Rittman was
thrown out of the game.
Freshman Vanessa Czarnecki fol
lowed with a slap to third, and was
safe at first on an overthrow. The
error allowed Witt to cross the plate
and the inning ended with Fresno
State up 2-0.
On the mound against the Cardi
nal was Bulldog ace, junior Amanda
Scott (27-3). With a 0.24 ERA enter
ing the regional, Stanford had a hard

road ahead.
But in the top of the fifth, the Car
dinal began to eat away at Fresno
State's lead. Freshman Sarah Beeson
drove a double to left center to lead
off the inning. The double was Bee
son's second in as many games and
was identical to the three-RBI shot a
day earlier against Pacific.
Senior Micelle Acosta then
reached on an error by freshman sec
ond baseman Lovieanne Jung and
sophomore Ramona Shelbume, run
ning for Beeson, moved to third. Se
nior Marcy Crouch brought Shel
burne home to score with a grounder
to the second, and was safe at first as
Jung bobbled the ball. The Cardinal,
however, could not push another run
across. Senior Shane Anderson hit a
chopper to third baseman Fossatti
who stepped on third and fired to first
in time for a double play.
This defensive stop gave the Bull
dogs momentum moving into their
at-bat, and the team capitalized on its
energy. Using two hits and two Stan
ford errors, Fresno State put three
more runs on the board.
"We had to stop their momentum,
and by scoring runs after they did, it
shut the door," Dowland said.
Typical of the tenacity the team
has shown all season, the Cardinal
came back yet again with another run
in the top of the sixth.

Junior Kellie Wiginton drew a
one-out walk, senior Michelle
Schneider followed with an infield
single, and Wiginton moved to third
on a throwing error.
With a sharp single to left by a div
ing Dowland. freshman Jessica Men
doza brought Wiginton home. The
Cardinal, however, was unable to
bring the other two baserunners
home, but kept fighting through the
last pitch.
"I am really proud that we didn't
give up," Schneider said. "Especially
today, we didn't give up and believed
in the seventh inning that we were
going to come back and win the
game,"
Rittman praised his team's effort
as well.
"There were some defensive mis
takes made, but our team has battled
back all year," Rittman said. "And
today after being down, we battled
back and put ourselves in a position
to tie the game. Two very good teams
were playing today and we battled
hard, it is just unfortunate that we
came up on the short end of the
stick."
The Bulldogs went on to be unde
feated in the tournament and the cap
ture the regional title, earning a trip to
the College World Series.
Five of the eight teams in the Pa
cific 10 conference are advancing to
the CWS — UCLA, California, Ari
zona State, Arizona and Washington.
The other two spots were captured by
DePaul and Southern Mississippi.
