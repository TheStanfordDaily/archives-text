>i George I ucas sat down with gallant, sexy
'lily reporter Mob Gates and shared a I : ive
live. Mr. I ucas was surprisingly forthright,
tnest and sincere in his answers to Gates'
Ts'.ions. What follows is an abbreviated tran
• ipt of their visit:
iics: Mr. I ucas, what inspired you to create
• epic film mythology that has inspired gen
. r 11 ions of movie-goers?
ucas: I lie answer is surprisingly simple. At the
y>>' of 5, I experienced an alien abduction. I
.is kidnapped and taken aboard an alien ves
! tailed the "Nanoohopocabotle," a rough
mslation of which is the "Centennial
i trich.' I hey kept me onboard for 3 years of
if ir tini", which I estimate to last about 3.87
iinut s In this 3-year span, I was taught their
uage and introduced to their people and
'Hue. I hey released me with only one condi
i that I teach our culture about theirs so
M our universe can live within one
'■■hoigocrya," which literally means "moldy
V.i iiuls smell shitty" but in the proper
• xt I tian,slate it to mean "the Force."
1 i I you model any of your characters
i these acquaintances on the alien ship?
1 t s say ( hewbacca, for instance.
i ucas: \clually, < hewbacca was inspired by my
gieat aunt I thel with the hare lip. She had an
allergic reaction to shaving cream one fateful
I liday night that left her speaking voice per
il ■ nit Iv damaged.
Gates: Did you really think up the name
i ikin' while you were at the bar that

inspired the
Tattooine bar in
Episode IV? And
is Heinekin your
favorite beer?
Lucas: Actually, I
do not drink alco
holic beverages. In
fact, the only I

thing I drink besides water is Pepsi. Also, I have
never been inside a bar. When 1 eat out, I only
eat at Taco Bell, Pizza Hut or Kentucky Fried
Chicken. And I always I stop at Toys R Us on
the way home to buy some action figures for
the kids.
Gates: Mr. l.ucas, 1 know that this sounds silly,
but America is dying to know: is it true that
you have worn a brand new pair of Yoda
underwear every day since the release of
"Return of the Jedi"?
Lucas: (pause) The thing that captivates me
about live Alive is the ability of the grapefruit
juice to overwhelm the tastes of the other four
juices. Shouldn't they rename the drink "Four
Dead and One Alive"?
I.uke Skywalker is a lot like grapefruit juice.
It seems like the whole universe is against him,
but he keeps on fighting, lust when you think
the odds can't be any greater — you know the
part when he kisses his sister and actually likes
it — Luke comes through in the clutch.
Vanquishing the other four juices and savoring
the galaxy.
Gates: Do Boba Fett and R2-D2 get it on in
Episode II?
Lucas: You'll just have to wait to see the movie.
1 can't give it away just yet!
