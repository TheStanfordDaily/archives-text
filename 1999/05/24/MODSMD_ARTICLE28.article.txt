# We waited in line ... yoda, yoda, yoda

### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
Last Wednesday — as you all must know
unless you've been living under a rock — was
the opening of "Star Wars: The Phantom
Menace." Schmuck and Putz desperately
wanted to review this film for their loyal fans.
Unfortunately, they were never quite able to
get tickets. However, they did have quite an
experience waiting in line.
So, instead of a review of the actual "Star
Wars" prequel, we're presenting you with an
in-depth review of our own "Star Wars" romp
last Wednesday.
10 a.m.: We decide that we're going to ditch all
of our classes to go see this new hot flick. We
pack up the car with plenty of Surge and Ho
Ho's, get our sleeping bags and head off to the
AMC Mercado.
10:30 a.m.: We arrive and can't seem to find
any parking. We finally find a Radisson Hotel
10 miles away where we can park. We walk
back to the theater with our Surge and Ho
Ho's— sweat beating down our foreheads
and bodies feeling like they're about to col
lapse. But it's all right: we've made it.

11:30 a.m.: We find the end of the
line — right off some freeway exit in
downtown San Jose — and set up
camp. Schmuck puts on his Spock
ears. Putz smacks him and explains
that they're waiting to see "Star
Wars," not "Star Trek."
Noon: We make contact with the
elderly gentleman lounging in front
of us. He is wearing a white outfit and
carries a light saber. He claims that
his name is Luke. We do not question
him. He spouts out nonsensical lines
from the movie preview between
slugs of Jose Cuervo. We decide that
we want to sit next to him in the
movie. Free booze.

12:30 p.m.: The first showing of the film lets
out. Putz runs up to see what they thought of
the flick. Schmuck holds the fort down. Putz
asks them, "So, was it worth the wait?" They
beat him to a pulp. Schmuck sees his cohort is
in trouble but decides that he doesn't want to
leave the fort for fear of losing his place in line.
Schmuck begins to eat Putz's share of the Ho
Ho's, for his return is unlikely.
4:00 p.m.: Putz crawls back to his place in line.
Both arms are in a cast. Schmuck decides to
take a stroll up to the front of the line to talk to
some of the more fortunate folk.

5:10 p.m.: Schmuck makes it to the front of
the line. He has the following conversation
with a family of 5:
Schmuck: So, how long have you guys been
here?
Dad: About a month.
Schmuck: Really, that's dedication.
Mom: Well, Dad had to quit his job, and we
decided to take the kids out of school. We
knew that Star Wars was more important
than anything you could ever learn in a
classroom.
Mary lane: Mom, I'm hungry.
Mom: Shut up, you'll have popcorn when
we get into the theatre.
Billy Bob: But Mommy, you've been saying
that for a month now.
Dad: Hush, Billy Bob, don't make me get
out the saber.
Schmuck: I can go get them a Ho Ho.
Dad: No! They have to earn the force. You
don't hear Baby Rupert crying now, do you?
And he hasn't eaten for a whole month
either!
Schmuck: Is he still alive, sir?
Dad: I don't know, we'll check when we get
in the movie.

MEANWHILE AT THE FORT...
Putz sees a Stanford techie half a mile back
in line. They shout back to each other in con
versation:
Putz: What do you think our chances are of
getting in?
Girl: All we can do is pray, Putz. I'm hold
ing 23 spots for people in my dorm. Did you
get my e-mail? I was willing to wait for you
too.
Putz: Oh, that's really sweet of you. But I
really didn't want to inconvenience you.
Girl: Oh, don't worry about it. I have noth
ing else better to do. I stopped out for the
quarter.

Putz: Really? Were you having academic prob
lems?
Girl: No, I just really wanted to see this movie.
Putz: So why are you so far back in line?
Girl:: Oh, I just got out of the 2:30 showing. 1
figure I could do this for a couple of weeks.
7:30 p.m.: We inch up a bit in line. Not much

else happens ... until we both feel
taps on our shoulders. Could it
really be her? Oh, my god — it is!
It's our beloved provost,
Condoleezza Rice! Hip hip hooray!
Condi: Boys, I can't tell you how
excited I am to see you here! You
know, I am your biggest fan!
Schmuck: Hey, what are you doing
here anyway? 1 thought you were
supposed to be off helping that
Bush boy win the presidency.
Condi: Are you kidding? That was
all just a front for the media. I just
quit my job so that I could get "Star
Wars" tickets.
Putz: Oh. That's clever, 1 guess.
Schmuck: Yeah, uh, what a great

idea.
Condi: Swell, well I'll see you guys later.
11:59 p.m.:
Schmuck: I heard that they're letting people
in for the 12:01 show.
Putz: Yeah, Schmuck, but we're still about 2
miles away.
Schmuck: Do you think we can make it?
Putz: 1 don't know, Schmuck.
Schmuck: If we run real fast and beat up the
ticket takers, maybe we could still make it.
Putz: Good idea.
We spent that night in prison. It was a warm
night. Fortunately, we had the tunes of "Star
Wars" in our heads to keep us company.


Give us the force, baby!
