# Team protests old-growth sales
## 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
Stanford's Redwood Action
Team took its case against the log
ging of old-growth forests in North
ern California to the Home Depot
in San Carlos on Saturday.
About two dozen protesters,
mostly from Stanford, held signs
with slogans such as "Not one more
ancient tree" and passed out
leaflets in front of the giant lumber
and hardware retailer, criticizing
the company for selling lumber
from old-growth redwood forests.
"We're encouraging customers
to put pressure on Home Depot to
no old-growth free," not advocat

ing a boycott, said sophomore
Emily Goodwin of Redwood Ac
tion Team.
Rob Levitsky, a Palo Alto resi
dent and long-time associate of en
vironmental groups at Stanford,
pointed out that "nobody likes pro
testers in front of their business."
"We may educate some people
here today .... More importantly,
we'll make Home Depot uncom
fortable."
Chris, an assistant manager of
the San Carlos store who declined
to give his last name, rejected the
idea that Home Depot is contribut
ing to the decline of an unrenew
able resource.
"I think we make every effort to

manage the merchandise we bring
into the store," he said. "1 think
Home Depot is one of the most en
vironmentally conscious compa
nies that is operating today."
The protest was the first at the
San Carlos store to their knowl
edge, according to store employ
ees.
Customers' reactions varied,
though many were unaware of the
issues surrounding old-growth
forests.
Larry Smith of San Carlos was
sympathetic.
"If it's old growth, it shouldn't
be a staple of their product line," he
said.
Another customer, who de
clined to be named, said there are
"more important things in life."
"I wish they'd go out and help
some people instead of worrying
about the trees," he said.
1 Freshman Carolyn Kousky, a
member of Redwood Action
Team, said, "I've talked to a couple
of people so far who are sharehold
ers and were in support."
' "And of course, there are peo
ple who don't care."
Freshman Becky Chaplin said
that in California, people can have
a more immediate impact on the
issue of old-growth logging.
• u These forests that are being cut
down are two hours away," she
said.
Ray Colwell. an independent
Jacuzzi vendor who contracts with
Home Depot for space in front of
the store, said that protesters were
having an effect.
""It does affect sales — who
wants to stand out here and talk
with someone holding a sign that
says 'Home Depot sucks?' " he
said-
Goodwin said the protest was
part of a series at Home Depots na
tionwide sponsored by groups such
as. Rainforest Action Network.
Home Depot shareholders are vot
ing at the company's annual meet
ing on May 26 in Atlanta on
whether to phase out sales of old
growth lumber.
Jhe company's board of direc
tors is unanimously opposed, she
said.
The protest started with some
excitement, as two students
climbed a tower in front of the
stpre to try to hang a protest ban
ner, which prompted store officials

to call San Carlos police.
'"Home Depot is aware that
these people have a right to express
their opinions," said Sgt. John
Read of the San Carlos Police De
partment. "We're trying to avoid
people getting hurt" or arrested for
trespassing, he said.
If protesters enter the store and
refuse to leave, they can be arrest
ed, he said. The parking lot, where
Saturday's protest took place, is
considered public space.
Police stayed to mediate be
tween protesters and store employ
ees, but all sides felt that the day
went smoothly.
"They're controlling themselves
very well," said Steve, the Home
Depot store manager, who de
clined to give his last name.
