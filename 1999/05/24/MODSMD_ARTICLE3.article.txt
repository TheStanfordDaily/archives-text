Chris, an assistant manager of
the San Carlos store who declined
to give his last name, rejected the
idea that Home Depot is contribut

The protest was the first at the
San Carlos store to their knowl
edge, according to store employ
ees.
Customers' reactions varied,
though many were unaware of the
issues surrounding old-growth
forests.
Larry Smith of San Carlos was
sympathetic.
"If it's old growth, it shouldn't
be a staple of their product line," he
