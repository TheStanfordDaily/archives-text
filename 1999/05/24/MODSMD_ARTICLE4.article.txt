# Draw unpredictable as ever
## 
### Joshua Fried Contributing writer 
This year's Draw may have been
the most user-friendly to date, but
its results remained unpredictable
and its methodology enigmatic.
Draw results were posted in resi
dence offices last Friday, and ap
peared on Axess Saturday.
The number of undergraduate
students who applied for housing
through the Draw — 3,977 — and
the number left unassigned — 225
were similar to last year's figures.
However, a new option in the
1999 Draw designed to reduce the
frequency of split draw groups cre
ated skewed cutoff numbers for var
ious dorms and Row houses. The
cutoff numbers for many residences
increased, in some cases by several

hundred, due primarily to the new
feature.
"Several factors influence the
number of the last student assigned
[to a particular house], including the
number of students exempted into
the house, the size of the groups who
drew into the house, CIP [Capital
Improvement Plan], and now the
group retention feature," said Kath
leen Bransfield, housing assignment
services manager.
Of the 2,364 undergraduates
who used the group retention fea
ture, 1,824 of them indicated they
wanted to be kept together through
out their residence choices.
The option was introduced in re
sponse to concerns voiced by stu
dents who wished to avoid the

chance of being split from their draw
group at any cost.
Students in draw groups "who
value staying together more than
they value drawing separately into
more popular dorms" could indicate
on their housing application the de
sire to be kept together, according to
the Housing Assignment Services
Web site.
The feature accomplished what it
was designed to do, and a large num
ber of students were able to stay with
their draw groups.
However, when the final few spots
in a residence needed to be filled, the
computerized Draw skipped over

groups with low draw numbers that
elected to stay together until it found
a person drawing alone or a group
that avoided the new option and
could be split, rewarding those stu
dents with better assignments.
This procedure led to inflated cut
off numbers and created dense Draw
data tables that included statistics for
groups of every size.
One of the largest shifts affected
the Grove houses, which drew 1,948
for women and 737 for men. Last
year, the houses drew in the 300 range
for both men and women.
Bob, situated on the corner of
Mayfield Avenue and Campus
Drive, is a perennial favorite of Draw
participants with good numbers. This
year. Bob drew 623 for women com
pared to 119 the previous year. Bob

still claimed the top spot for men
with 213, a big jump from last year's
55.
Other residences exhibiting larger
than normal cutoff numbers included
Adelfa, Eucalipto, 553 Mayfield, 557
Mayfield, Chi Theta Chi. La Maison
Francaise, La Casa Italiana, non-eth
nic Muwekma-Ta-Ruk, Storey and
Faisan.
The new Freshman-Sophomore
College was filled largely with priori
ty applicants, drawing 1,410 for men
and 1,959 for women. According to
Bransfield, 1999 may be "the only
year the Frosh-Soph College goes
through the Draw. We definitely
filled it out of choice. Freshmen next
year may choose it again for their
sophomore year."
680 Lomita Drive, the former Phi

Delta Theta house, proved extremely
popular as a newcomer to this year's
Draw. The house drew third for both
men (263) and women (227).
The top-five men's choices also in
cluded Xanadu at second (245),
Lambda Nu at fourth (303) and Whit
man at fifth (368).
On the women's side. Lambda Nu
claimed first (120) and Xanadu sec
ond (171). Granada (264) and Storey
(276) rounded out the top five.
The least desirable residences for
women were Arroyo, Burbank, Soto,
Serra, Trancos. Twain and the non
ethnic Casa Zapata, all drawing the
assignment cutoff number of 2,796.
Slavianskii Dom and the non-eth
nic portions of Casa Zapata and
Okada drew 2,692, the assignment
cutoff number for men.
