Increased demand for gradu
ate student housing is making the
task of finding an on-campus
housing assignment more and
more difficult.
Figures released Friday indi
cate an upward trend in the desir
ability of on-campus housing,
which is generally more afford
able than off-campus, non-Uni
versity-controlled alternatives.
Nearly 250 more single stu
dents applied for University
housing in 1999 compared to last
year, and almost 3(X) more were
left unassigned.
"Obviously we are very con
cerned about the number of
graduate students who applied
for on-campus housing who were
not offered an assignment." said
Kathleen Bransfield. housing as
signment services manager. " The
demand for on-campus housing
for graduate students remains
very high."
"This is the worst housing lot
tery for graduate students ever,"
said former Graduate Student
Council member Robert Rudnit
sky. "After all the progress made
on this problem by Stanford ad
ministrators and graduate stu-
dents, this is very discouraging."
This year 3,464 single grad stu
dents and 997 couples applied for
housing, compared to 3,217 and 963
last year.
The number of unassigned single
students rose to 861 from 567. and
unassigned couples jumped from
158 to 210.
All new graduate students who
indicated they were willing to live in
any eligible residence were as
signed. Some new graduate students
who submitted limited choices were
not assigned.
Continuing graduate students
have a limited number of priority
years for on-campus housing but are
not guaranteed. The majority of the
graduate students not assigned were
continuing students with priority.
University officials have already
begun to deal with the housing
shortage.
"Earlier this spring we received
approval from the Provost's Office
to lease new apartments in order to
house an additional 250 graduate
students," Bransfield said. "We
have begun that process that will
continue throughout the summer."
Priority for University-leased
off-campus housing will go to con
tinuing graduate students. Students
who apply for the subsidized apart
ments by the May 31 deadline will
retain their original lottery number.
Biochemistry graduate student
and Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee chair Stephanie Toering
was surprised by the increase in on
campus applications.
"I've seen the off-campus mar
ket open up a little bit lately; Tor
sale' signs popping up around my
neighborhood." Toering said. "Cost
is a major consideration, but some
people choose off-campus to avoid
the lottery."
University officials plan to have
480 new units in Escondido Village
open to graduate students bv the fall
of 2(XX). Construction is beginning
this summer.
