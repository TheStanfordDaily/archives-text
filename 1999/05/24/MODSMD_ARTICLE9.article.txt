Germany elects new president
BERLIN (AP) — A federal assembly elected
Johannes Rau as the nation's eighth postwar presi
dent yesterday in a vote that marked another step in
the government's historic return to Germany's pre
war capital of Berlin.
Rau. one of Germany's most prominent Social
Democrats, was congratulated by Chancellor Ger
hard Schroeder after the results were announced in
the newly refurbished Reichstag.
The presidency is Germany's highest office, but
the post is largely ceremonial and the president is
viewed as the nation's conscience. As described by
tormer President Richard von Weizsaecker, the
president should "ask questions, encourage answers,
but never offer a prescription."
Backed by both the governing Social Democrats
and Greens parties, Rau won 690 votes in the 1,338-
member assembly in the second round, held after he
failed to win a simple majority in the first vote.
; Dagmar Schipanski, candidate for the conserva
tive opposition, won 572 votes and protest candidate
IJta Ranke-Heinemann had 62 votes.
Rau. who succeeds President Roman Herzog, will
blithe first president of the democratic German Fed
eral Republic to serve entirely from Berlin, which
gradually is assuming the role of capital from Bonn.
Prequel misses weekend record
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Proving that not even
the Force could live up to all the "Star Wars" hype,
"The Phantom Menace" grossed $61.8 million its
opening weekend, falling far short of the record
$72.1 million debut of "The Lost World: Jurassic
Park." estimates showed yesterday.
Since its release Wednesday, the "Star Wars" pre
quel amassed $102.8 million, a spectacular number
for any other film, but short of some expectations for
the eagerly awaited space adventure. Several movie
analysts had predicted a five-day gross of $120 mil
lion to $140 million.
> Still, while it settled for the No. 2 all-time spot for
a Friday-to-Sunday opening weekend, "Star Wars:
Episode I —The Phantom Menace" shattered a
number of other records. It had the highest single
day and opening-day grosses ($28.5 million on
Wednesday) and became the fastest movie to reach
$ 1 (K) million (five days, versus six for "Lost World.")
•••'The Phantom Menace" set these marks, which
are not adjusted for inflation, even though it didn't
open on a holiday weekend, as event pictures usual
ly do. "Lost World," for instance, set the three-day
opening weekend record over the Memorial Day
holiday in 1997.
Tom Sherak. distribution head for 20th Century
Fox. said the strategy was to release "The Phantom
Menace" in mid-week to first accommodate the
hardcore fans and then make room for regular
itx)vie-goers to see it over the weekend.
