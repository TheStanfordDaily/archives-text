## Schools liable for kids' harassment Court divided 5-4 on Georgia case 
### 
WASHING lON (AIM —A
sharply divided Supreme Court
ruled veslerdav that schools can he
sued when officials fail to stop stu
dents from sexually harassing each
other — a decision that four jus
tices warned could impose new
social and financial burdens on
districts nationwide.
Schools from elementary it)
college that accept federal
money can be forced to pay vic
tims i»l such harassment, the court
said. I he 5-4 ruling revived a law
suit on behalf of a fifth-grade
Georgia giil who said a classmate
harassed her lor months despite
her complaints to school officials.
But the liability can exist only
when school officials know about
and are deliberately indifferent to
sexual harassment "so severe, per
vasive and objectively offensive
that it can be said to deprive the
victims of access to the education
al opportunities or benefits pro
vided by the school.'" Justice San
dra Dav O'Connor wrote for the
court.
That legal standard is high
enough to keep children and their
parents from making a federal
case out of every playground
taunt. ()'Connor said.
The courts dissenters were not
convinced. "After today. Johnny
will find that the routine problems
of adolescence are to be resolved
by invoking a federal right to
demand assignment to a desk two
rows away." Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy wrote for the four.
The court ruled that Congress
meant to outlaw student-on-stu
dent harassment when it enacted
an anti-bias federal law known as
Title IX of the Education Amend
ments of 1^72.
Joining ()'( onnor were Justices
John Paul Stevens, David 11.
Souter. Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen (i. Brevet .
Kennedy, joined in dissent by

Chief Justice William 11. Rehn
c|uist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Clarence Thomas, said
Congress lacks the power to attach
such strings to federal money.
"Y\'e can be assured that like
suits will follow — suits, which in
cost and number, will impose seri
ous financial burdens on local
school districts, the taxpayers who
support them and the children
they serve." Kennedy said.
In the Georgia case, Aurelia
Davis sued the Monroe County
school board and two officials
over a five-month "barrage of sex
ual harassment and abuse" her
daughter LaShonda allegedly
endured from a fellow fifth-grader
at Hubbard Elementary School in
Forsyth in 1992-93.
Ihe boy. identified in court
papers as G.F.. allegedly touched
the girl's breasts, rubbed against
her suggestively and repeatedly
told her he wanted to have sex
with her.
I he lawsuit stated that LaShon
da. now a high school junior, and
her mother reported each incident
to school officials but G.F. was
never disciplined. I he boy plead
ed guilty to sexual battery after
Mrs. Davis complained to the
county sheriff.
I lie lawsuit against the school
board said the harassment caused
LaShonda's grades to fall and had
a debilitating effect on her mental
ly and emotionally.
The Supreme Court first ruled
in l c >92 that sexually harassed stu
dents may collect monetary dam
ages from their schools and school
officials under Title IX. and last
June articulated the appropriate
legal standing for determining
when such liability exists.
The June ruling said school dis
tricts can be financially responsi
ble for a teacher's sexual harass
ment of a student. Yesterday's
