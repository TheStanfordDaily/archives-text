Painful results of grad
housing Draw tempered
by positive progress

THE Nl 'MM: RS TOLD a grim
story in last year's graduate
housing lottery: more than
1.000 students requesting University
housing left without an assignment.
Students, angered by Stanford's inabil
ity to address the problem, organized a
massive protest.
(iraduate Student Council member
Robert Rudnitsky, a doctoral student
in physics, summed up the students'
complaints. "This unmet demand of
more than 1.000 students." he told Hie
Daily, "coupled with the suffering,
indicates that the University has to
start treating this as a more serious sit
uation."
A year later, the numbers look
worse. Due to an increase in students
applying for University housing, 300
more students were left unhoused on
top of last year's thousand. Rudnitsky
called it"the worst housing lottery for
graduate students ever."

The reaction this year, however,
should be different. ITiough the figures
are bad, the allegation that the Univer
sity isn't doing enough to improve
them doesn't apply anymore.
In the past year, administrators and
the CISC have worked hard to design
and implement ways to alleviate the
problem. The administration has
leased off-campus apartments for
graduates and Provost C ondoleez/a
Rice recently approved a plan to lease
250 more. Construction begins this
summer on 4NO new units in Escondi
do Village, set to open by fall of 2(XX).
Hut demand for on-campus gradu
ate housing — fueled by skyrocketing
Peninsula housing prices — seems to
be increasing faster than Stanford can
build or lease. While students wait for
new units to become available, they
see more and more of their peers lining
up for I Jniversity living.
II last year's lottery results were a
wake-up call, this year's are a
reminder. For as much work as it has
done in the past year, the I Jniversity
must continue to do more. The gradu
ate housing crisis won't go away quick
ly or quietly.
