University parking woes
still better than a campus
that requires a car

Tin: PARKING SITUATION
on campus can often seem
hopeless. Faculty complain of
the lack o! spots around the ()val, stu
dents bemoan the inadequacy of resi
dential parking and no one is happy
with parking tickets. We. however, ask
you to consider the alternative.
As convenient as ii might be for
campus residents to drive to class with
out hassle, it would be both

catastrophic for the University's aes
thetics and environmentally irrespon
sible. C ampus was designed before the
first mass-produced automobiles, and
students living on campus should be
able to walk and bike everywhere.
Safety is a more legitimate concern,
as parking at night is parking in resi
dential lots remains off-limits to stu
dents not residing in a particular com
plex. Iliis often leads to long and dan
gerous walking situations. Although
Sure Escort is not at fault for these cir
cumstances in any way. a more devel
oped, resource-endowed SURE
Escort system could help alleviate this
concern.
