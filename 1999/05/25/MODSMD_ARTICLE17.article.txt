# Sprinkle cool patience
## The 						mystique of "growing forward"

Growing for
ward. though it
may sound like
something Ned Nickerson
might do, is, in fact, the
grammatically question
able slogan behind the
Stanford Shopping Cen-

ter's current expansion campaign. I'he cam
paign includes such hold projects as
destroying the asphalt lot next to Macy's to
make room for a brand new multilevel
parking structure.
()nly a few hundred feet away. I've been
spending my Saturdays this quarter helping
to excavate what remains of the house
Leland and Jane Stanford lived in back
when our beloved campus was the Palo
Alto Stock Farm.
The house collapsed in the l l X)6 earth
quake and was only "rediscovered" about a
decade ago. Unfortunately, the task of
investigating the mansion has been compli
cated bv the University's plans to eventual
ly bulldoze the entire site in order to build a
retirement community, Stanford West
Apartments.
One has the sense that Stanford's finan
cial planners hope that it will be as wildly
successful as the Page Mill industrial park
that, in just another decade, baby
boomers with mutual fund pensions will be
beating down the doors, eager to be close to
top-notch health care and Nordstrom's.
And. as it happens, the building costs will
be funded in part from the revenue derived
from the enlarged shopping center. Con
struction may be unavoidable here, yet
never before in my four years has it hap
pened at such a rapid pace and raised so
many hackles. We may accept, grudgingly

or not, that there ought to be cheaper facul
ty housing on campus or that it would be
nice to have more classrooms, but die stick
er shock seems to include more cars and
trucks on ostensibly pedestrian paths and
the transformation of favorite haunts into
unfamiliar landscapes — trees spring up
overnight; a grassy hillside suddenly
becomes another lot filled with earth
movers.
For the faculty and others who make
their homes on the streets beyond Campus
Drive, what they see is not the short term
nuisance but rather the alteration of their
way of life as open spaces disappear and
traffic increases. Despite their investment of
time and money in their community, many
feel ignored in the process. One former
homeowner wrote to the Stanford Report
that " I'his sense of alienation is now present
and growing."
The same feeling exists among students.
Though we may not stay here long, we
inherit the discontent of our predecessors.
Events like the destruction of the Band
Shak influence our perception of the
administration; we, in turn, pass these atti
tudes down to the classes that follow. If this
sequence of events continues — and there
seems little reason to believe that it will not
an uncomfortable atmosphere of hostili
ty towards a university that stifles student
voices will inevitably taint our happiness
while we're here and our backwards glances
even after we have moved on.
In the end, what makes projects like infill
housing and the proposed destruction of the
Toyon Eating Clubs so difficult for many to
accept is that they are being done in the
name of the Stanford community.
To news that Stanford homeowners

were asking county officials to look into
proposed housing changes, the Board of
Trustees responded, "We are deeply con
cerned. Intrusion can only be harmful to the
long-term interests of all faculty and stu
dents."
It's a cunning ploy to lay claim to an eth
ical neutrality that your opponent lacks, but
we should not stand for it. By favoring cer
tain projects and diminishing others — by
encouraging e-degrees and closing the Food
Research Institute — the University is con
tinually making choices based on an ideo
logical determination of what "matters"
and what does not.
And it is in the process that leads to
those decisions that the long view fades out
and groups of people making day-to-day
choices begin to matter. Is it so unreason
able, then, to argue that individual home
owners and individual students ought to be
allowed to join that discussion?
It may seem incongruous to suggest that
students, most of us soon to be mired in
loan debt, should be agitating for the rights
of men and women pulling in salaries in the
upper five figures. Yet land use may well be
an issue that draws together students and
faculty, each with different passions, but
perhaps with the same goals. Both groups
seek to ensure that the ideal that drew them
here in the first place, of a community of
scholars living in an environment of mutual
respect, continues to thrive, not only in the
distant future, but here and now as well.

Atiba Pertilla, a senior majoring in history,
would like to say thanks to everyone who's
made "Ole 94" so much fun, including Tina
and the Boy Scouts.
