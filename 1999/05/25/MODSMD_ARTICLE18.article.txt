A square deal for workers
We arc writing to I he Daily lo express
our support for the workers of Hon Appetit
who arc currently attempting to negotiate a
better contract.
As contract negotiations resume, we
would like lo let the Stanford community
and the management ol Hon Appetit know
that we think an X percent increase in wages
(which is what the workers are asking for) is
modest considering that many Hon Appetit
workers make between $(i and $7 per hour.
In contrast, student minimum wage on
campus is $8.50 and Stanford Dining Ser
vice Workers earn at least $7.75 an hour. A
20 cent increase in wages (which is what
Hon Appetit management is currently con
sidering) is much too little.
Some til us are students who live off
campus, and we know that the cost of living
is too high and increasing too rapidly (espe
cially housing costs) to make the wages Hon
Appetit workers receive livable.
Also, $IIJ2l l J2 per month health insurance
costs for a family of four is too high for
workers who get paid so little. As a result,
many Hon Appetit workers do not have
health care. We would like to see affordable
health care for all Hon Appetit workers.
Lastly, workers at Hon Appetit currently
have only three days of sick-leave and three
paid holidays for the entire year. We feel
that this is highly inadequate and that these
numbers should increase.
Agreeing to these three requests should
not cause any problems to Hon Appetit and
we, as patrons of Hon Appetit, urge man
agement to do so before the end of the cur

rent contract on May 31. It is a simple mat
ter of human justice.

A plea to stop IM
bloodshed
I would like to inform readers of a fight
that occurred on the intramural soccer
fields on Friday.
My hope is that by telling you how quick
ly an aggressively played game turned into a
trip to the hospital and the county jail, this
incident will not be repeated. I also hope
that the IM program can learn from this
incident and work to help control future
games.
In short, the last of a series of hard fouls
(some of which were called) led to an
exchange of pushes. A substitute from the
fouled team sprinted onto the field and
threw a punch at the fouling player.
For the next 20 seconds, most players
from both teams were either throwing
punches or pulling each other away from
the fight.
When all stopped, one player had a bro
ken arm and another was unconscious.
What had started as a soccer game between
Stanford students had ended in checking for
vital signs and a hand-cuffing (of the player
accused of delivering the blow to the head).

Because the injured player ehecked-out OK
from the hospital and did not press charges,
the arrested player was released from cus
tody.
No part of the above incident should
have happened, and all involved are at fault.
Students electing to play 1M sports must
have the honor to play within the rules and
to hold their tempers when a game becomes
physical.
In addition, the IM program should have
a standing rule of immediate ejection for
any part in a fight — players leaving the
side-lines included. While not needed in the
ideal world, I have seen first-hand the
necessity of stronger enforcement in this
contact sport.
Most of you were not there tin Friday,
but you shouldn't have to look into the
rolled back eyes of a freshman, waiting for a
squeeze from his hand, and you shouldn't
have to see your friend being ducked into
the back of a police car, to want to make a
change.

Stein's column was on point
Major congratulations are in order to
Dave Stein, whose "parting plea for aca
demic integrity" was the most relevant and
noteworthy article to come out of The Daily
that I have ever seen.
His plea to elevate the often-abysmal
academic standards many students accept is
dead-on. Professors, adminstrators and stu
dents should each take note of Stein's point-

Ed suggestions to discipline seminars so that
we indeed are taught more by insightful
experts instead of by peers who, as he says,
have just scrambled "desperately to say
something to bolster their class participa
tion grades", and to seriously re-think the
supposed "improvements" of programs
such as CIV.
Of course we treasure the freedom we
are given to engage ourselves in our work at
the pace (and level of involvement) we
desire. But students here, as everywhere,
are far too willing to settle for a comfort
able. often complacent, pace which is not
why we are here.
Stein reminds us of something we must
not forget: that we are here to be challenged
and that the academic expectations of this
university must hold us to this challenge.
He is absolutely right—of the varied
complex of our Stanford experience, it is the
integrity of the mind remaining strong and
unyielding, which we must hold paramount.
