Ending six months of speculation, former Asst. Histo
ry Prof. Karen Sawislak announced yesterday that she
would not be returning to Stanford.
"I'm just not convinced that I can get a fair hearing
from the University." in a second tenure review, she said.
Sawislak has been in negotiations with the University
over the terms of her possible return since January, when
I Iniversity President (ierhard Casper offered her the op

portunily to come back and go through (he tenure process
again next year.
"It became clear to me that we were not going to be
able to agree," she said. "The University is unwilling to
take steps to ensure the fairness of any re-review
Tenure is a stressful and fraught process under the best of
circumstances."
Sawislak. noting that a faculty advisory board recom
mended in January that Casper grant her tenure outright.


SAWISLAK
requested that a second tenure re
view begin in the Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences Office, rather than
from scratch in the History Depart
ment.
"It's wrong that the burden has
shifted back to me. given that the
University (in the advisory board's
report] admitted that it made mis
takes in the process."
Provost Condoleezza Rice de
clined to comment.
"I've been hearing about this all
day," she said, but not from Sawislak
directly.
University President Gerhard
Casper also had not received any of
ficial response to his January offer
from Sawislak. and thus declined to
comment as well.
History Prof. Carolyn Lougee
Chappell, chair of the department,
was "disappointed" to hear of Sawis
lak's decision.
"Karen was a fine and valued col
league. and we were looking forward
to having her back." she said.

History doctoral student Paul
I lerman, a former teaching assistant
for Sawislak, was "sad that Professor
Sawislak decided not to return."
"I understand her decision, be
cause I don't think the University
provided her with a great option,"
Herman said. "As a student who
came to Stanford to study with her. I
am discouraged, and l think other
students will be as well."
Sawislak will be returning to the
Bay Area to "change gears," she said.
After completing her research 112 el
lowship at I larvard. Sawislak will be
enrolling this fall at Boalt Hall. UC-
Berkeley's law school, to study labor
and employment law.
• "It's a loss to the history profes
sion." said C'happell. "She should
have had an important career in his
tory ahead of her."
Sawislak said that law is "not my
first choice." She is not ruling out a
future at Stanford.
"I don't consider this finished."
she said.
Sawislak is part of a group com
plaint to the Office of Federal Con
tract Compliance Programs, a divi
sion of the U.S. Department of

Labor, alleging gender discrimina
tion by Stanford in hiring and promo
tion including tenure. From an initial
group of seven last fall, the number of
complainants has grown to 30.
"I've had six women contact me at
Harvard, asking how to join the com
plaint." she said. The investigation is
ongoing.
Sawislak also has an individual
gender discrimination complaint
against Stanford under investigation
by the Equal Employment Opportu
nity Commission.
"Both of these agencies have the
power to order remedies that could
bring me back to Stanford," she said.
And. she added. "If they're willing
to grant me tenure, I'd be willing to
hear about it."
Sawislak says she is "sad to be
leaving the University like this."
However, she said, "I feel very
positive about the organization we're
accomplished to alert the federal
government to the problems that are
[at Stanford]" regarding gender and
employment.
"It will require this kind of exter
nal intervention to change the cul
ture." she said.
