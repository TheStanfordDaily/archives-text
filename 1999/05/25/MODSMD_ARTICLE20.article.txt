## Rethinking a flawed strategy in Kosovo

has shown a callous disregard for human life,
has solidified Serbian support for the Milose
vic government, weakened its democratic
opposition and wildly escalated the abuse
and displacement of the ethnic Albanian
Kosovars.
The Clinton administration has violated
not only the United Nations Charter, to
which our country is a signatory, but
arguably also the U.S. Constitution and the
1973 War Powers Act. intended to prevent a
president from making war without the eon
sent of Congress.
Apart from the ever-swelling number of

apparent "blunders" — among them
bombed hospitals, trains, buses, and civilian
communities, not to speak of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade — NATO aircraft have
deliberately destroyed much of the country's
infrastructure, have wrought havoc with eco
logical systems, killing farm animals and
wildlife, and polluting and blocking interna
tional traffic on the Danube River.
The NATO attack has been responsible
for numerous civilian casualties, many of
them women and children. We have used
particularly abhorrent weapons, like the
radioactive "depleted uranium" projectiles
of unhappy (lull War memory that spread a
trail of contaminated dust and debris, and
the infamous cluster bombs, especially effec
tive. as our experience in Vietnam taught us,
in shredding human flesh.
Some have defended the bombing on the

grounds that Serbian violence in Kosovo has
been so horrendous that we could not stand
by and do nothing. Hut an inhumane
response even to acts of inhumanity is inde
fensible. Indeed, if our leaders' protestations
of humanitarian concern were sincere, they
would long ago have sprung to the aid of
other populations whose plight has been as
heart-rending as that of the Kosovars
among them the Kurds, the Rwandans and
the East Timorese.
It is a false dichotomy to see inaction or
the devastation of Yugoslavia as our only
options. Action can be taken that neither
appeases the Milosevic government nor
leads to the reprehensible inhumanity of the
NA IO war. We propose the following:
I. The bombing must stop. I his is the sine
(/mi non of any progress toward resolution of
the conflict.

2. Proceed In real negotiation with
Yugoslavia. The Ramhouillct "agreement"
sought to dictate terms ol unconditional sur
render thai no sovereign nation could accept
It stipulated, for example (iii ( haptci
Appendix B) that NATO "he immune troiii
all legal process." not just in Kosovo, but
throughout the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, its personnel, "immune from
any form of arrest, investigation or detention
by the authorities in the FRY" and entitled
to "enjoy... free and unrestricted passage
and unimpeded access throughout the FRY.
including airspace and territorial waters."
I'hese conditions, requiring total capitulation
as of a militarily vanquished nation, were
what NA K). very much at the behest of the
I Jnited States, its dominant power, demand
ed at Ramhouillct.
3. Diplomacy must be entrusted to the Unit-

Ed Nations, which has been marginalized
until now, not to NATO, a military force cre
ated to prevent Soviet expansion into West
ern Europe. Furthermore. Russia must be
accepted as a serious participant in the nego
tiations.
4. FinalU. wiser heads must prevail in this
country to curb our government's ambition
to require the submission of the rest of the
world to U.S. hegemony. We must recognize
that it is not and should not be the destiny of
our own or any other country to rule the
world, hut rather to join with other nations in
working to sustain organizations that can
bring about world peace and justice.
