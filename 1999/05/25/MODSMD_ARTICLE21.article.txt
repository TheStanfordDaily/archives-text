At this weekend's women's
golf NCAA Championships
there were two things that
could not be stopped: Mother
Nature and the Duke Lady
Blue Devils.

WOMEN'S GOLF
â–  Wednesday-Saturday: No.
8 Stanford finished eighth at
the NCAA Championships.

After a sudden barrage of
thunderstorms battered the
Tulsa Country Club course in
Tulsa, Okla., and forced the
cancellation of Saturdays final
round of play, Duke was de
clared the tournament champi
on. The Blue Devils, ranked
first in the country, never
trailed in the event, jumping off
to a 12-shot first-day lead and
leading wire to wire to claim the
crown in the abbreviated three
round event.
The Stanford women's golf
team, ranked eighth in the na
tional standings, finished right
on target in eighth place. It was
the sixth consecutive top-10 fin
ish for the Cardinal in NCAA
play.
After posting a blistering
288 on the 6,022 yard, par-71
layout on the first day of play,
Duke was able to overcome a
poor second round score of 309
to maintain a six-stroke lead on
No. 10 Pepperdine heading
into the third round. A plus-14
298 on the third day gave Duke
an eight-shot cushion over No.
4 Arizona State and No. 2
Georgia and a nine-stroke lead
over No. 3 Arizona going into
the final round.
That final round was not to
be as weather intervened with a
day of storms and rain. Play was
postponed at 3:40 p.m. with
most of the teams still on the
course. With no letup in sight
and darkness approaching,
NCAA officials decided to can
cel the final round and make
the third round standings final.
Duke ended up with a team
score of 895, the only team to
break the 9(X) mark. Arizona
State and Georgia tied for sec
ond at 903, with Arizona just a
stroke back at 904 after an im
pressive third-round 292.
Pepperdine fell back to fifth
place at 911 for the weekend.
Sixth-ranked Tulsa led the
second group of five at 913 with
No. 5 IJSC a shot behind at 914.
Stanford finished alone in
eighth with a score of 916 on the
strength of consecutive 304s on
the first two days and a 308 on
what was to be the final round
of play.
Individually, sophomore
Grace Park of Arizona State,
ranked sixth in the nation,
claimed a one-stroke victory
with a one-under-par 212.
The Stanford squad was led
by sophomores Stephanie
Keever and Hilary Homeyer.

No. 9 and No. 14 respectively,
both carded three-round totals
of 227 to finish in a tie for 15th.
