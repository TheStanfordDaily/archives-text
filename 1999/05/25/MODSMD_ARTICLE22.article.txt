## 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
When asked if his star athlete
Tracye Lawyer would do anything
besides the 200-meter dash, the
100-meter hurdles, the 400-relay
and the high jump at this past week
end's Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionship, Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna didn't hesitate:
"Yes, she'll drive the bus," he
said.
After winning the heptathlon
portion of the meet the previous
weekend. Lawyer certainly did lead
the way for the Cardinal, adding 24
points to the 10 she earned in the
heptathlon. I he senior's efforts
helped the team produce its sec
ond-best point total ever at the
meet. The 122.5 point tally was
good for fourth place, just half a
point behind Washington State.
UCLA won its third straight title
with 160.5, followed by USC with
140.
"Last week, the heptathlon
weekend. I was trying to go for my
third (Pac-10] win." Lawyer said.

"But 1 did all of the events that I
competed in this past weekend for
the team."

WOMEN'S TRACK
■ Friday-Saturday: Stanford finished
fourth at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.

While Lawyer's talent alone ac
counted for a third-place finish in
the 200 and fourth-place finishes in
both the high jump and hurdles, it
was a group effort that helped the
Cardinal 400-meter relay team
shock the crowd with a second
place performance. Juniors Jayna
Smith and Wilsa ('harles and fresh
man Robyn Woolfolk teamed with
Lawyer for her last-ever relay in a
Stanford uniform. Together they
took advantage of disqualifications
by both the I ISC and Arizona State
teams.
"We tied the school record [of
45.32] and that team that we tied it
with had some pretty strong per
sonnel — Jackie Edwards, a [two
time] NCAA champion, and
Chrvste Gains, an Olympic gold

medalist," Lananna said.
The sprinters all scored individu
ally as well. Charles clocked per
sonal best times in both the prelims
of the KM) (11.72 seconds) and 200
(23.98) on Friday before going on to
finish sixth in both events in Satur
day's finals. Smith placed fifth in
the 400 and the freshman Wool folk
placed sixth in the 100 hurdles.
The sprinters weren't the only
ones to step up. Sophomore dis
tance runner Julia Stamps shook off
a less-than-spectaeular season to
complete an impressive double in
the 3,000 and 5,000 meters, placing
second in both and earning 16
points.
Rather than lead her races, as
Stamps had done throughout the
season with ;i string of poor finishes,
the All-American decided to sit on
her opponents until the finish.
"Since I had to double in the
3,000 and 5,000, they wanted to
make sure that I conserved myself."
Stamps said.
In the 3.000 on Friday night.
Stamps made a move with a lap to
go. Marie Davis of ()regon was the
only runner who went with her,
eventually overtaking her with 200
meters left. Davis then held off
Stamps to finish in nine minutes,
39.88. seconds — two-tenths of a
second in front of Stamps. Stanford
freshman Colleen Flaherty placed
iliiril in 1 >:47.26.
In Saturday's 5.000 Stamps em
ployed the same strategy, making a
move with a lap to go. Again Davis
vscnl with her. but the main obsta
cle was Arizona's Tara Chaplin 40
meters ahead. I caving Davis in the
dust. Stamps fell just seven-tenths
of a second short ol Chaplin's
16:35.98.
"After the race I was like, 'Let
me do il again. Maybe I could have
caught her il I started my kick a lit
tle bit earlier.'" Stamps said.
Also placing in the 5.000 were

Stanford's junior Sally Glynn and
senior Mary Cobb, who finished
sixth and seventh, respectively. The
same duo had previously run the
1.500 meters, where they finished
fifth and sixth.
"Hie 10.000 also saw a lot of red,
with senior Sarna Renfro leading a
Stanford contingent with a third
place finish.
Freshman Caroline Annis and
senior Linn Schulte-Sasse finished
fifth and seventh.
I he Cardinal throwers chipped
in their fair share with a combined
22 points. The junior threesome ol
javelin thrower Allison Beatty
(second), hammer thrower Mau
reen Onyeagbako (third) and dis
cus thrower Summer Pierson
(fourth) accounted for 20 of those
points.
Both Beatty and Onyeagbako
threw career bests, with Onyeag
bako's 190-foot toss breaking her
own school record. It is possible
that all three will go on to compete
at the NCAAs in two weeks.
