appointing seventh-place finish.

■ Kriday-Siiturday: Stanford finished
third at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.

The meet had begun well enough
for the ('ardinal. as Friday saw a one
two-three Stanford sweep in the
1 (),(MK)-meters and a seeond-place
finish by junior Toby Stevenson in
the pole vault, catapulting the team
into third place overall.
But Friday also saw Stanford's top
hammer thrower and meet favorite
Adam Connolly stricken by a gas
trointestinal virus which sent him to
the hospital for much of the day. A

dehydrated Connolly was given flu
ids intravenously for four hours and
released.
Though Connolly was able to
come back Saturday and take second
in the hammer at 226 feet, Saturday
was also when most other teams
made their strongest moves.
Stanford was shut out of the scor
ing in the 4(X) relay, long jump. 400
hurdles and discus, and the Cardinal
had no competitors in the 1(H), 2(X)
and 400 meters.
With only the 5,000-meter run, the
high and triple jumps and the 1 .oxi
meter relay remaining, crunch time
for the Cardinal had arrived.
Then came the deluge. Freshman
Michael Ponikvar bested the field in
the high jump at seven feet, one-half
inch, and sophomore Todd Beyerlein
tied for eighth (6-8 3/4) to capture 10
1/2 points for the team. Freshman
Warrick McDowell notched a point
at eighth in the triple jump at 47-7 1/4.
I he penultimate race of the meet,
the 5,000 meters, came next. With ju
nior Brad I lauser rahbiting the pack
through the first two miles, a strong
contingent til Stanford harriers in
cluding junior Brent I lauser. seniors
Jason Balkman and Nathan Nutter
and sophomore I'honuts Murley
looked poised to capture big points
for the team.
Brent I lauser and Arizona's Ahdi
Abdirahman fought lor the lead soon
after, with Abdirahman taking the
pole. Abdirahman cruised to the fin
ish in first, but Stanford's second-,
third-, fourth- and sixth-place finishes
by Nutter (14 minutes, 3.78 seconds).
Brent I lauser (14:12.15), Balkman
(14:12.46) and Murley (14:40.87)
meant 22 points for the Cardinal,
launching the team back into third
place with 103 1/2 points.
Stanford's 1,600-meter relay
squad capped the scoring with a two

point seventh-place showing at
3:13.00.
"We probably defied the odds,"
said Stanford head coach Vin Lanan
na. "When you think of track and
field in the Pac-10. you think of IJSC
and I J( I .A. I lere we are in a position
where Stanford is a very serious con
tender."
I ISC' was the meet champion with
164 points, and UCLA was second
with 136. The third-place finish tied
for Stanford's best ever in the meet,
and 105 1/2 is the most points ever
scored by a Stanford squad at Pac
10s.
"We really did capitalize on our
opportunities," said Lananna. "It was
a complete team effort. Our objective
was to score KM) points. It was pretty
cool, because we didn't have any
where near that with 25 minutes left
in the meet."
The Cardinal distance runners
carried much of the show for Stan
ford, scoring a total of 65 points in
races 8(H) meters and longer.
Sophomore Ryan Carroll was

fifth in the H(K) at 1:51.19, and Brad
Hauser and Jake Maas took second
and fifth respectively in the 1,500, at
3:53.71 and 3:54.03.
Nutter, competing in his home
town, was tops in the 10.0(H) at
29:55.20.
Balkman was second, just six
tenths of a second back.
"I've run many a race on this track,
and near the end, Jason told me to go
ahead and take the race," said Nutter.
"This was a good warniup for the
NCAAs. It was also great to win he
fore family and friends."
Other strong performances came
from junior Mark Ganek. who was
fourth in the hammer at 207-9. fellow
sophomore Chad Wassink. who
threw the javelin 211-4 for eighth and
freshman Chris Sprague, who cap
tured seventh in the shotput at 53-8
1/2.
"Its been an interesting year for
the men." Lananna said. "We have a
big picture in mind, and the Pac-lOs
was in that picture, though certainly
not a 'be all, end all.'
