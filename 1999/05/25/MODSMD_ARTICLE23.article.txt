With four events remaining in last
weekend's Pacific 10 C onference
Championships at Arizona State, it
looked like Stanford might have
been in for a repeat of last year's dis
appointing seventh-place finish.

MEN S TRACK
â–  Kriday-Siiturday: Stanford finished
third at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.

The meet had begun well enough
for the ('ardinal. as Friday saw a one
two-three Stanford sweep in the
1 (),(MK)-meters and a seeond-place
finish by junior Toby Stevenson in
the pole vault, catapulting the team
into third place overall.
But Friday also saw Stanford's top
hammer thrower and meet favorite
Adam Connolly stricken by a gas
trointestinal virus which sent him to
the hospital for much of the day. A

dehydrated Connolly was given flu
ids intravenously for four hours and
released.
Though Connolly was able to
come back Saturday and take second
in the hammer at 226 feet, Saturday
was also when most other teams
made their strongest moves.
Stanford was shut out of the scor
ing in the 4(X) relay, long jump. 400
hurdles and discus, and the Cardinal
had no competitors in the 1(H), 2(X)
and 400 meters.
With only the 5,000-meter run, the
high and triple jumps and the 1 .oxi
meter relay remaining, crunch time
for the Cardinal had arrived.
Then came the deluge. Freshman
Michael Ponikvar bested the field in
the high jump at seven feet, one-half
inch, and sophomore Todd Beyerlein
tied for eighth (6-8 3/4) to capture 10
1/2 points for the team. Freshman
Warrick McDowell notched a point
at eighth in the triple jump at 47-7 1/4.
