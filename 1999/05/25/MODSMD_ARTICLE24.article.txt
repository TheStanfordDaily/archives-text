# Seedings reveal Card to face familiar foe
## Four conference teams earn bids 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Last year Stanford entered the
postseason on a low note, but when
the highly regarded team looked at
its first-round opponent. Loyola
Marymount. it was not concerned.
This season the third-ranked Car
dinal is not exactly concerned either.
Yesterday, however, when the
NCAA announced the baseball
tournament seedings and Stanford
saw that it would once again face
Loyola, which surprised the Cardinal
by giving it the first of its two season
ending losses last year at Sunken Di
amond. no one was sure what to feel
going into this weekend.
"We'll be favored, but [if Loyola
wins] you won't say 'Oh my God,
Loyola won the regional,'" said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess.
"To a baseball man, that's not a
shock. Not when they just beat Pep
perdine, who's the No. 1 seed at [the
USC Regional], two out of three."
Loyola (33-26), the No. 4 seed in
the regional to be held at Sunken Di
amond. will not be the only test for
the Cardinal this weekend, though.
Nevada (36-18), named the re
gional's second seed, was rated No.
24 last week. The Wolf Pack has
given Stanford all it could handle in
two meetings earlier this season. In
early March Nevada won 7-4. and on
May 4 the Wolf Pack had the lead for
much of the game before losing to
the Cardinal 16-14 in extra innings
North Carolina (40-16), which
was rated No. 20 last week before
falling out of the poll, won 16 straight
games to begin the season and
earned the No. 3 seed in the regional.
"We're obviously matched up
with some pretty good teams," said
sophomore right fielder Joe Bor
chard. "We certainly can't look past
[Loyola] and obviously Nevada and
North Carolina are two very capable
teams. We got our work cut out for
