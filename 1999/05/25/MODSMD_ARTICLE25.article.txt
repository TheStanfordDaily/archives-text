For the Stanford men's golf team, it wasn't
the way the season was supposed to end. For se
nior captain Joel Kribel, one of the most deco
rated players in Stanford golf history, it wasn't
the way a career was supposed to end.
This weekend's NCAA West Regional was
one of disappointments as Kribel and the Car
dinal failed to qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships.
The No. 2K Stanford squad finished in 15th
place for the event at 902,1 1 strokes out of ninth
place, the last qualifying spot.
Kribel, ranked third in the country, posted a

three-round total of 220, two strokes above the
necessary score of 218 to attain one of the
NCAA bids.

MEN'S GOLF
â–  Thursday-Saturday: No. 28 Stanford finished
15th at the NCAA West Reeionals.

The top two lowest individual scorers whose
teams do not qualify for the NCA As receive in
vitations to the tournament as individual medal
ists. Kribel barely missed out as Justin Peters of
Nevada and Jorge Corral of I ISC captured the
two precious berths.
In the team standings, the No. 5 Arizona
State Sun Devils led wire to wire, bookending a

second-round score of 2NN with one-under-par
rounds of 283 on the first and third days to win
by eight strokes over No. 2 IJNLV.
On the individual side. Arizona State's Jeff
Quinney posted a seven-under-par 2()9 for the
weekend to win by three strokes.
Nigel Spence of Colorado State and Michael
Kirk of UNLV shared second place at four
under-par 212.
Kribel, who tied for second at last year's
NC'AAs as an individual, fired an even-par 72
on Saturday's final round to move up from 32nd
to 20th. but fell two strokes short. He finished in
;i three-way tie for fourth among those golfers
vying for the two individual qualifiers.
The three-time All-American entered the

week at the top of all the major collegiate rank
ings and will likely receive a spot on the All-
America first team standings for the third con
secutive year.
Kribel finished the season with a scoring av
erage of 70.12, breaking Tiger Woods' record of
70.9 established in l l )%. His career stroke aver
age of 71.65 is just half a shot higher than
Woods' all-time career mark.
For the Cardinal, junior Dusty Brett fired a
75 on Saturday to move into a tie for 44th place.
Sophomore Jimmy Lee shot an 81 on the final
day to fall back to 73rd place.
Fellow sophomore Alex Aragon finished in
78th place while freshman Ned Yetten. playing
his first rounds of postseason play, placed 83rd.
