111 a two-month period, the Uni
versity lias announced the appoint
ments of three new top-ranking ad
ministrative officials. And more are
to come. Such a high turnover in the
academic administrative ranks is
nearly unprecedented in Stanford's
recent history.
Not since the late l%()s has Stan
ford seen so many top-ranking ad
ministrators come on board. From
September 1%8 to August 1%9. for
example. Stanford saw a change in
the ranks of the president. (iSH dean.

dean of humanities and sciences, vice
provost and associate dean of under
graduate education. Student Affairs
ushered in a new dean of admissions,
dean < >1 students and assistant dean of
students. Part of this turnover can be
attributed to the overall tumultuous
atmosphere at Stanford.
Though the 1990s have been rela
tively stable in terms of the adminis
tration. from February to April of this
year University President Gerhard
Casper announced the appointments
<>l Robert .loss as dean of the (iradu
ate School ol Business, Kathleen Sul
livan as Law School dean and John
I lennessv as provost, all of whom will
start this fall.
In addition I lennessy's promotion
to provost leaves a vacancy for a dean
of engineering, while the search for a
permanent dean of religious life has
lasted 14 months. Director of Com
munications Terry Shepard also an

nouneed his departure May 6.
Another recent member of the
University's upper echelons is Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Malcolm
Beaslev. who has onlv had nine

months to get comfortable in his of
fice in Building 1.
In total, the widespread turnover
in administrative ranks will touch
countless graduate and undergradu
ate students, faculty and staff.
The effect
The face of the administration will
again take on a new look next year
with three newcomers to Casper's 10-
member cabinet that consists of the
seven deans, the vice provost and
dean of research and graduate policy,
the director of the 1 loover Institution

and the director of Stanford Linear
Aeeelerator Center.
None of the departures come as a
surprise. Few top administrators stay
longer than 10 years. The outgoing
three have put in their time at Stan
lord: Michael Spence took the helm
of the GSB in 1990. Paul Brest was
promoted to Law School dean in
1987, and Provost Condoleezza Rice
came hack to Stanford in 1993.
Assistant to the President Jacque
line Wender said the focus of the
deans is internal to each of their
schools and less like an actual cabinet
for Casper. He does not necessarily
work with cabinet members on a
daily basis, so having four relatively
new administrators — deans of engi
neering. law. business and humanities
and sciences — will affect his day-to
day schedule less than the change in
provost and director of communica
tions.

Though it seems to many like
Casper just began his duties here, he
is currently serving his seventh year
as president. His predecessor, Don
ald Kennedy, served 12: Kennedy's
predecessor, Richard Lyman, served
10: while Kenneth Pitzer served only
two during the tumultuous late 19605.
During such a period of high

turnover, it is unlikely that Casper
will announce his departure this year.
"Sooner or later, I too have to as
sure that new perspectives are
brought to the University presiden
cy," Casper said regarding how long
he plans to serve as the University's
ninth president.
