# Zare rakes in three top awards
## 
### Fei Wu Contributing writer 
From finding evidence of life on
Mars to investigating the biochem
istry of memory, Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare has done it all.
After winning the Welch Award
for lifetime achievement in chem
istry, Zare received an honorary doc
torate, degree from Columbia Uni
versity. That's in addition to accep
tance into the London Royal Society,
all within the past two weeks.
The Welch Award, the largest and
most prestigious in the field of chem
istry, has been given annually since
to honor lifetime achievements
in the field. Zare will be presented
with a $3(X),(KX) prize and gold medal
lion during the foundation's annual
award banquet in October.
After hearing the news about the
Welch Award. Zare received a doc

toral degree, honoris causa, from ("o
lumbia.
Topping it all off, he has just been
invited to join the Royal Society, the
British Academy of Science, as one of
only six foreign members.
"When it rains, it pours," Zare
said, describing the awards as surpris
ing and overwhelming.
Those familiar with Zare's work,
however, are not surprised. A peek at
Zare's research career reveals a long
list of accomplishments.
Zare's most noted work involves
the application ol lasers in physical
and analytical chemistry, what he de
scribes as "applying lasers to under
stand how chemical reactions occur
and what chemical components there
are in mixtures."
I le isalsoknownfor hisanalysisof
a 1984 Martian meteorite from
Antarctica for NASA that provided
intrituiinu circumstantial evidence

that microbial life may once have ex
isted on Mars.
In addition to writing more than
6(H) scientific papers, books and chap
ters. Zare also served on the Nation
al Science Board, and is the recipient
of the National Medal of Science.
"He's had a spectacular impact on
the way people practice science," said
( hemistry Prof. John Brauman, who
nominated Zare for the Welch
Award. "Hardly anyone knows the
[laser] techniques and the fundamen
tals of science as well as he does."
Yet surprisingly, despite his long
list of achievements. Zare said his
parents discouraged him from chem
istry. Zare's father dropped out of
graduate school during the Depres
sion. never completing his doctorate.
"They thought [chemistry] wasn't
the road to happiness," Zare said.
But surrounded by chemistry books
whdn he was voung. he said he read

them "like taboo literature" and was
exeited about "seeing fireworks."
"I am certainly in a way realizing
my father's ambition." he said.
Currently, Zare is conducting 10
to 12 projects at the same time, inves
tigating everything from the reac
tions of ions with molecules to the un
derstanding of synapses in the brain.
In addition to research, Zare also
finds his passion through teaching.
"Teaching sharpens my mind and
makes me question where things
come from." Zare said.
"We're proud of the atmosphere
he creates, the science he brings, and
the wisdom he brings to the I Jniversi
ty," said C hemistry Prof. Barry Frost,
chair of the chemistry department.
"It's not just that he is a great sci
entist. but he is also a great citizen."
said Brauman. "I le embodies all the
qualities that a faculty should have at
a place like this."
