# Students awarded URO funding

Laura Sol/nick's office was swamped
yesterday. After announcing the recipients
of the spring I WI Jndergraduate Research
Opportunity grants last Friday, she was
flooded with questions from students who
received grants, as well as those who did not
and wanted to know why.
" That's an important part of the educa
tional nature of the lIRO program, that stu
dents whose proposals weren't accepted arc
able to find out why." said Sel/niek. the
URO director.
A total of $421.(XX) was awarded this
spring, in addition to the $ 14().(KK) that the
URO program awarded earlier in the year.
()ut of 30N total applications. 230 were
accepted. ()f those. 170 were major grants

and (">() were small grants. ()f those (id small
grants. 13 were given to students whose pro
posals were originally for major grants but
whose proposals did not warrant major
grants.
L.ast year's numbers were similar. In
199 ( X the IJRO reviewed 323 applications
and gave out $550.(XX) to 230 students.
Hvery year since its inception in 1974. the
program has issued major and minor grants.
Major grants may be as large as $2.5(M)
lor research lasting three academic quar
ters. Minor grants can amount toss(X). Stu
dents may use grant funds to cover a variety
of approved expenses including travel,
books, phone calls and faxes.
To receive I JR() grants, students have to
be in good academic standing and attain
sponsorship from a full or associate profes
sor.

"A lot of people come in with ideas that
are still in developmental stages and we're
able to help them by guiding them to the ap
propriate faculty resources. We really try to
have it be as supportive a process as possi
ble." Selznick said.
Though the largest number of URO
grants went to students in the natural sci
ences. history and English students also find
themselves well-funded, thanks in part to
$2.2 million that was allocated for research
in the humanities by the I Jniversity Centen
nial Campaign in 1991.
"A lot of this money goes to humanities
students who just need rent money so they
can stay near a library or some other re
source." Selznick said.
Hie I ! R() program has also spurred sev-
eral departments to institute their
own undergraduate research fund
granting programs.
"In 1985. the IJRO program was
the only source of funding for under
graduates who wanted to do inde
pendent research. Since then, several
departmental programs have
emerged under people like Charles
Kruger, [dean of research], who is
sponsoring mentorcd research pro
grams in the departments of physics
and chemistry," Selznick said.
According to Selznick, most stu
dents who receive grants, it not all, se
riously consider themselves as part i)l
the research community and are very
responsible with the money given to
them.
"First of all. students have to sub
mit a detailed budget of their expens
es. They have to sign a contract with
us. promising to allocate their funds
according to the budget. Then they
have to bring back their receipts and

return any unused money. II things
don't balance out. then their registra
tion is put on hold. We have the sys
tem we have because it works."
Selznick said such careful plan
ning is necessary because "we don't
give retroactive funding. In other
words, if a student goes to Europe
and ends up spending more than he
planned, we aren't going to reim
burse him. That's why it's very im
portant for students to plan ahead
and make out an accurate budget."
Students have had varying experi
ences with the I JR() program.
Grants can have the effect of in
troducing students to the broader
world of competing for funding, re
searching, and reporting their results.
After receivinga previous grant to
study lemurs in Madagascar. Junior
Janet Altman received $1,3(X) from
IJRO to study the stress levels of
African 112 ish as they become territori
al.
"I got a fair amount of negative re
sp< wise at first." she said, "which is un
derstandable because I had already
received a Meaglc grant, but the more

I talked to [Selznick), the more she
saw the importance of both projects.
I can tell that [Selznick| works really
hard to accommodate a lot of peo
ple."
Junior Naomi Levin received
$700 and the loan of a digital camera
to facilitate her participation in an ex
pansive archeology survey in
Corinthian, Greece, this summer.
She will work with a consortium of
university professors from around
the globe.
" The whole process was pretty
easy," said Levin, who was also able
to attain an additional grant from the
an th i t >pc >logv depart men I.
Anthropology department co
chair William Durham had high
praise for the lIKO program.
"Research funded through the
program can provide an integrat
ing capstone experience for stu
dents which extends and expands
their work done here at Stanford. It
can pul those years of work into a
more active mode. I see it as one of
the University's most outstanding
programs," Durham said.
