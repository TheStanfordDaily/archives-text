and advertisers away from newspa
pers to online services. With SO per
cent ol its $3.1 billion in revenues
from advertisement and 45 percent
ol this coming from classified ad
vertisement, this is a serious con
cern for Knight Kidder.

" There is a myth that the news
business is not a healthy business.
Bui the news business has never

Web sites. It will eventually include

papers.

content other than the special ser
vices, such as electronic libraries.

fic for advertisement, direct mar
keting and e-commerce," Kidder

In response to the concern that
the convergence of advertisement
and news on the Web could affect
the objectivity of online news, Kid
der said, " This danger is in print
form too." He then added, "What
good newspapers and online ser
vices have is the credibility of the in
stitutions."
When asked about the possibili

tute for the printed newspaper.
Kidder said. "Getting information
on the newspaper is a really easy
and last way, and 1 don't think that
