parking problems, freshmen will not

Assoc. Vice Provost for Facilities
Chris ChristolTerson announced last
night.
"We've been talking about this
issue for 15 years." Christoffcrson
told the ASSIJ Senate. "It's time to
bite the bullet."
The decision has largely been
"spurred on by the new building
we're doing, particularly the under
graduate residences." said Troy
Gilbert, assistant to the vice provost

for student affairs.
In order to mitigate the effects ul
its decision, the I Jniversils proposed
an expansion of the Marguerite sys
tem and added transportation set
vices.
"Ideally, you just won't need a
car." ( hristofferson said. "We're ex
panding the Marguerite service to
run every night, weekend and week
end days. We're creating services to
deal with ad hoc dorm projects,'' he
added.
University suggestions for new
services include ear rentals for stu
dents under the age of 21 and com
munal fleets of cars and vans avail
able for freshman.
Senator Stephen Aronowit/ ex

pressed concern about the announce
ment. "It seems really extreme to me
s;i\ ing you can't bring a car. This place
cangetreall\ claustrophobic I can't
imagine anyone living in Uranncr
without anvone having a car." he said.

Sixteen percent of freshmen have
a car when they arrive, but 4N percent
have one by the end of their first year,
which Aronowit/ suggested was

pnx)f they needed the ears.
Christofferson emphasized the
University's commitment to create
an environment where a car is unnec
essary and not compromise the fresh
man experience.
"We'll he spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars to make sure this
is viable... we've agreed to front the
services for a year to see how effec
tive they are." he said.
Services were originally sched
uled to begin in the 2000-01 school
year but will be put into effect this
coming year at the insistence of
former ASSU president Maren
Norton.
ASSU president Mike Levin
voiced confidence as to the Universi
ty's desire to accommodate student

need. "1 do think Chris cares about
what students say. I think it's really
great that new parking spaces
have been created all over campus
this past year."
"Parking is a very complicated
issue with inherent conflicts," said
Christofferson. He said that while
students want to be able to park next
to and away from dormitories. Uni
versity officials and staff complain
about the conversion of class C into
class A parking.
Class A permits are more expen
sive than class C. but they allow A
permit owners to park closer to pop
ular campus spots.
Christofferson hopes the Univer
sity's decision will alleviate parking
problems around Eseondido Road,
an area heavily inhabited by fresh
men. and around Governor's Cor
ner. which will house freshmen be
ginning next vear with the new Fresh

man / Sophomore College.
Norton acknowledged the po
tential for strong student reaction
to the decision. "I think it's going to
he a tough issue and a matter of ed
ucating students. It's tough to sell a
decision like this, but I have faith in
Stanford students to understand."
she said.
Norton said she did not see the
University's choice to make the park
ing decision public only two weeks
before summer break as a strategic
effort to avoid controversy in a time
when students are preoccupied with
finals.
"They wanted to make it public
earlier." she said, "but they didn't
want to drop a bombshell like this
without a comprehensive plan."
Gilbert assured that the first class
to be affected by the "no freshman
cars" rule will be informed in admis
sions information.
