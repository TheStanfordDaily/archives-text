Police officer pleads guilty to torture
NEW YORK (AP) — His eyes red and voice cracking, a white
police officer accused of torturing a Haitian immigrant with a wooden
stick in a stationhouse bathroom pleaded guilty yesterday after the
vaunted "blue wall of silence" came tumbling down around him.
Justin Volpe, the central figure in an explosive brutality case that
shocked the city and heightened racial tensions, pleaded guilty to civil
rights charges three weeks into his trial. Four other white officers
remain on trial.
Volpe, 27, could be sent to prison for life. No sentencing date was
set.
The officer told U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson that he
rammed a stick into the rectum of a handcuffed Abner Louima. He
also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for threatening Louima if
he ever told anyone.
Volpe said he acted in a fit of rage because he mistakenly believed
Louima had punched him while police tried to quell a brawl outside a
nightclub in August 1997.
Volpe reluctantly admitted his role only after four fellow officers
testified that he had borrowed gloves he later returned covered with
blood and that he showed off the stick and boasted, "1 took a man
down."
The top charge against Volpe — that he deprived Louima of his
civil rights by sexually assaulting him — carries a maximum sentence
of life in prison without parole, although the judge can impose a less
er term.
The plea threatened to complicate the case against the remaining
defendants.
Officer Charles Schwarz is accused of holding down Louima. a 32-
year-old security guard, in the bathroom assault. Schwarz and Officers
Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder also are charged with beating
Louima on the way to the police station after his arrest on charges he
punched Volpe. Sgt. Michael Bellomo, their supervisor, is charged
with covering up the incident.
Starr won't retry Whitewater figures
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bowing to legal setbacks, Kenneth Starr
won't retry Whitewater figure Susan McDougal and another woman
accused of hindering his investigation. The Associated Press has
learned. Both cases ended in mistrials this spring.
Yesterday, Starr informed the federal judges who oversaw the
cases of McDougal in Little Rock, Ark., and Julie Hiatt Steele in Vir
ginia, according to legal sources familiar with his decision.
The independent counsel's move came after juries handed him
consecutive setbacks in his effort to punish witnesses he contended
were uncooperative or gave false testimony that delayed his investiga
tion. Jurors deadlocked in both cases.
McDougal's brother, a fierce critic of Starr, praised the decision.
"I don't believe he would have gotten a conviction and he would
only have put my family through the misery of a retrial," William Hen
ley said in a telephone interview. "1 think he did the right thing."
Starr still has two more trials involving another witness he has
accused of being uncooperative, presidential friend and former Justice
Department official Webster Hubbell.
Hubbell. who has already served prison time on charges brought by
Starr, faces separate indictments alleging tax evasion and false testi
mony. The first of those trials is set to begin in August.
But the decisions in the McDougal and Steele cases suggest that, in
the aftermath of President Clinton's impeachment, Starr may be clos
er to winding down his five-year, $40 million-plus investigation.
Oklahoma redirects money to tornado victims
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The state Legislature has voted to
withdraw money set aside for the trial of Oklahoma bombing conspir
ator Terry Nichols and spend it instead on helping victims of this
month's deadly tornadoes.
Lawmakers said the action reflected misgivings about putting
Nichols on trial again, the state's tight budget and the need to help vic
tims of the May 3 twisters that killed 44 people and damaged or
destroyed nearly 7,(KH) homes in Oklahoma.
The House approved the measure yesterday, a day after the Senate
passed it. It is unclear whether Gov. Frank Keating will sign the bill.
He has 15 days to review it.
"He feels it puts him in a difficult position," Keating spokesman
John Cox said. He said the governor knows the state's emergency fund
needs to be replenished but also believes that if prosecutors want to
try Nichols instate court they should be able to.
Many have said a trial would be too expensive — some senators say
as much as $20 million — and redundant because Nichols has already
been convicted in the bombing in federal court and because the trial
may not produce a death sentence. Nichols is serving a life sentence.
"I certainly support the death penalty," said state Sen. Mike Fair.
"I'm not sure we can get the death penalty."
The measure reallocates $1.2 million set aside for Nichols' state
trial.
The money would have gone to both the prosecution and the
defense at Nichols' trial. Nichols is represented by a lawyer at taxpay
er expense.
The state agency that represents indigent defendants said the with
drawal of the money would jeopardize efforts to defend Nichols.
"There's going to be no way we can defend Terry Nichols." Jim
Bednar said.
Toy makers to pay $50 million
NEWARK. N.J. (AP) —Toys R Us and two toy makers said yes
terday they will pay out $50 million worth of toys and cash to settle
claims that they conspired to keep Mr. Potato Head, Barbie and other
toys out of discount stores.
Toys R Us Inc.. the nation's No. 2 toy retailer, will pay $40.5 mil
lion, and Mattel Inc. and Little Tikes Co. together will pay $9.5 million
to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. None of the
companies admitted wrongdoing in the federal lawsuit.
A third toy maker, Hasbro, agreed to pay $5.9 million to settle the
same lawsuit last year.
"Although toy makers and sellers like to view themselves as
Santa's helpers, in this case these companies were nothing more than
modern-day Scrooges," New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
told reporters in New York.
The lawsuit, initiated in 1997 by New York state and joined by oth
ers that year, followed a complaint by the Federal Trade Commission
accusing Toys R Us of using its size and clout to get the toy makers to
stop selling to discount chains.
