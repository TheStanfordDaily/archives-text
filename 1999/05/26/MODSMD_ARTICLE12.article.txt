# Huang pleads guilty to conspiracy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” John Huang, whose
fund raising for the Democratic Party triggered
the wide-ranging investigation of money in the
1996 presidential election, has been cooperating
with the Justice Department for months and will
plead guilty to conspiracy.
Huang could answer lingering questions about
the origins of more than $1 million in suspect con
tributions he brought to the Democratic National
Committee and who else knew about the money's
sources.
In exchange for his cooperation, the Justice
Department has agreed to seek a sentence of one
year's probation for Huang, with a small fine and
some community service.
Before he was hired as a party fund-raiser on
President Clinton's recommendation, Huang was
the top U.S. executive of the Indonesian-based
Lippo Group, owned by Clinton friend and bil
lionaire businessman Mochtar Riady.
Huang will admit to defrauding the Federal
Election Commission by causing Lippo employ
ees to donate $7,500 that was reimbursed by the
company's headquarters in Jakarta, Justice

Department officials said in a statement yester
day.
The money went to Los Angeles mayoral can
didate Michael Woo and a committee raising
funds for the California Democratic Party and
Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
Congressional investigators had pursued
whether Huang, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in
mainland China, gathered information for Lippo
or China during his stint as a Commerce Depart
ment official in IW.\ Lippo has business ties with
China.
The Justice Department said in a statement it
lias found no evidence that Huang engaged in eco
nomic espionage or other types of spying.
The department's statement came the same
day a congressional committee released a report
alleging China has been stealing secrets from U.S.
nuclear weapons laboratories for decades.
A frequent White House visitor who met sev
eral times with Clinton, Huang becomes the third
key figure to provide information to the campaign
finance task force. The others are Yah Lin "Char
lie" Trie, a restaurateur in Little Rock. Ark., who

entered a plea agreement last week, cutting off his
trial for allegedly obstructing the Senate's investi
gation of campaign finance abuses; and Tai
wanese-American businessman Johnny Chung,
sentenced to five years of probation.
Clinton put in a good word for Huang at the
Democratic National Committee when he sought
a fund-raising job there during the 1996 presiden
tial campaign.
Huang was in charge of raising money from
Asian-Americans, and it was his activities that
touched off the Justice Department investigation
that focused on allegations of foreign money being
channeled into campaigns.
Democrats returned $2.8 million amid ques
tions about the money's origin, including $1.6 mil
lion raised by Huang.
A legal source familiar with Huang's plea
agreement said that he also has been cooperating
with several independent counsels. The source
refused to identify them, but it was disclosed last
year that he cooperated with Independent Coun
sel Kenneth Starr's probe of longtime Clinton
friend Webster Hubbell.
