BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
— NATO warplanes attacked Slo
bodan Milosevic's villa and other tar
gets across Yugoslavia yesterday,
and the military alliance approved a
revised plan for an enlarged peace
keeping ground force in Kosovo as
soon as Serb troops depart.
A new wave of refugees — as
many as 150,000 — were reported
bound for Macedonia, and a U.N.
report detailed in graphic fashion "a
significant upsurge" in sexual vio
lence against ethnic Albanian
women in Kosovo since NATO
airstrikes began two months ago.
The U.N. Population Fund,
which sent reproductive health kits
to Kosovo in April that included
"morning after" pills for rape vic
tims, said the report was the first
attempt by a United Nations organi
zation to verify the accounts bv
refugee women.
Reports of rape as a tool of war
and sexual violence against ethnic
Albanian women have been circulat
ing for months, but psychologist
Dominique Serrano-Fitamant said
"new women arriving from Kosovo
indicate that the violence is increas
ing."
According to the accounts of 35
women she interviewed, "any resis
tance is met with threats of being
burned alive," Serrano-Fitamant
said. Kosovo men who tried to inter
vene were killed on the spot, she was
told.
The trauma led some women to
describe themselves as being forever
"dead" to their families because of
the stigma of being raped and violat
ed in Muslim society, she said.
Aid officials, meanwhile, pushed
for tent cities to be expanded in
Macedonia. In neighboring Albania,
NA TO began moving thousands of
refugees away from camps too close
to the dangerous border with Koso
vo.
NATO strikes also were reported

Tuesday on military barracks, fuel
depots and other targets in central
Serbia. Loud detonations shook the
Kosovo capital, Pristina, late Tues
day, signaling new attacks.
The state-run Tanjug news agen
cy said a 5-year-old ethnic Albanian
boy was injured when a missile
struck a neighborhood in Vucitrn in
northern Kosovo. Five projectiles
also reportedly downed a power line,
cutting off electricity in the
province's west.
The deputy chairman of the
municipal government of Srbica. 25
miles northwest of Pristina. and his
driver were injured Tuesday in an
ambush staged by "Albanian terror
ists." or the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the private Beta news agency
said. Beta said the two Serbs were
recovering at a hospital but gave no

further details.
Three ethnic Albanians were
arrested yesterday on espionage
charges in Kosovo, while five more
on the run were charged on similar
counts. Tanjug reported. The three
arrested are suspected of collecting
information on the Yugoslav army
and police troops in the province and
giving it to NATO.
At NATO headquarters in Bel
gium. the alliance's top policymak
ing body, the North Atlantic Coun
cil. approved an updated plan for the
ground force intended to head into
Kosovo once Serb forces leave.
NA TO generals now must decide
exactly how many troops will be
needed, but the NATO-led force —
earlier envisioned as 2K.(KK(-strong
— is expected to number about
S().(KK). The United States would

likely supply 7 .(XX) to S.(KM) troops.
"This force ... will speak softly,
by which I mean that it will be friend
ly to everybody ... but it will have
very sharp teeth as well as very big
teeth if anybody should try to
oppose it carrying out its mandate or
to threaten its personnel," said
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea.
Poor weather hampered NATO's
military operation yesterday, but jets
struck the Yugoslav leader's villa just
west of Belgrade for the third time as
well as artillery locations and a logis
tics support base.
Jets also fired at Mount Cer, 60
miles west of Belgrade, v\..cre a key
communications transmitter is locat
ed: at the Batajnica military airport
northwest of Belgrade: and in the
suburb Rakovica. site of a large
underground military complex.
