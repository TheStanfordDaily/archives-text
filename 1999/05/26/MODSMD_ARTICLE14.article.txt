# House catalogs 20 years of espionage
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton,
confronted by a bipartisan congressional conclu
sion that Chinese espionage has led to the theft
of top-secret information about every U.S. nucle
ar weapon, said yesterday he will put into place
more than two dozen recommendations to safe
guard America's nuclear secrets.
A special House committee catalogued 20
years of Chinese espionage and the panel's chair
man. Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.. said
China's spying campaign almost surely continues
"to this very day."
In an appearance in Texas, Clinton said his
administration was "moving aggressively to
tighten security" at nuclear laboratories and
would work with Congress to follow the recom
mendations of the committee. But he also said
the administration would continue dealing with
China on a range of matters because that, too,
was in the national interest.
"We have a solemn obligation to protect such
national security information," declared the
president.
Though the most critical thefts were said to
have occurred during previous administrations,
the findings by the bipartisan special House com
mittee brought demands by some Republican
lawmakers for the resignation of Clinton's
national security adviser and attorney general.
There also were renewed questions about why
Clinton did not move earlier to boost security at

federal weapons labs.
While defending the president's response.
Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, the panel's
ranking Democrat, said that Chinese penetration
of nuclear weapons laboratories was "a major
counterintelligence failure ... one of the worst
failures in the nation's history."
The three-volume report, covering more than
7(H) pages, concluded that by stealing nuclear
secrets China had "leaped in a handful of years
from 19505-era strategic nuclear capabilities" to a
position where its weapon designs soon will be
"on par with our own."
Dicks and another committee member, Rep.
John Spratt, D-S.C.. characterized that conclu
sion as an overstatement based on "worst case"
assumptions. They said China has yet to deploy
any warhead from information believed to have
been obtained in the 1980s, and the Chinese have
only a few nuclear weapons compared with the
thousands in the U.S. arsenal.
China denied the allegations entirely, dismiss
ing them as a "despicable attempt" to shift atten
tion from the NATO bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia.
Cox, whose committee of five Republicans
and four Democrats began investigating China's
acquisition of U.S. technology last July and by
fall turned its focus to espionage, said the find
ings in yesterday's unclassified report were
based on facts set out in a longer classified ver

sion.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who has
moved to boost security at the weapons labs,.said
"we are fixing the problem" and 30 of the 36 rec
ommendations made by the Cox committee
already have been accepted. The recommenda
tions were sent to the White House in January
before the report was declassified.
Richardson called the panel's document "a
good solid report," but said "there's no evidence
of wholesale loss of information." He disputed
the conclusions regarding China's potential use
of the stolen technology.
But even Democrats expressed concern.
"I'm baffled at how this investigation has been
handled," Spratt said, referring to a case, still
being investigated by the FBI. of the loss of
design material from one of the country's most
sophisticated warheads, the W-88, from the Los
Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico.
While that information was believed obtained
by China in the 1980s, the theft was not discov
ered until 1995 and then its impact was only slow
ly recognized, the congressional report said.
Sandy Berger. the president's national security
adviser, notified Clinton in mid-1997, prompting
the president to direct an overhaul in security at
the labs in February 1998. The first significant
security improvements, however, were not put in
place for nine months, after Richardson took
over at the department.
