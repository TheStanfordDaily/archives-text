Unfortunate terms of
Sawislak's departure
reflect badly on Stanford

FORMER ASST. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak's decision not to
return to Stanford is a tremen
dous loss to the University communi
ty-
Not only did her work in the field of
American labor history add diversity
to the American history curriculum,
but she was also widely regarded for
her dedication to her students and her
involvement in department activities.
Her decision announced this week
culminates an almost two-year long
grievance process that began in the fall
of 1997 when she was denied tenure
by then-Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven.
Although Sawislak's presence will
be sorely missed, we cannot blame her
for rejecting University President
Gerhard Casper's seemingly half
hearted offer to resume her position
and face the tenure process once
again.
The offer appeared to be a vehicle
by which the I 'niversity could avoid a
lawsuit rather than a genuine invita
tion to fairly try for tenure again.
Casper made a grave mistake in
failing to side with the majority of
those on the Advisory Board, who
had recommended that Sawislak
receive tenure outright due to infor
mational error.
Given that Casper acknowledged in
January that Sawislak received
"exceptionally incautious feedback"
from the History Department and was

"substantially misled about [her]
progress in meeting University stan
dards," Sawislak is rightfully holding
out for what she deserves—tenure
granted outright.
Given the history of this case, she
has a strong rationale for being wary
of getting a fair tenure review on a sec
ond try.
Moreover, Sawislak cannot be
blamed for not wanting to return and
again face a process in which she has
already been victimized.
Casper gave her a poor option this
past winter, and Sawislak should
receive praise for standing her ground
to fight for what she deserves.
The Sawislak case is symbolic of the
ongoing struggle for women to gain
tenure at research universities like
Stanford and of an incentive system
which places being one of the top
scholars in one's field before dedica
tion to teaching and mentoring stu
dents and future academics.
Although we will not have Sawis
lak s daily presence at Stanford, we
are pleased that she and other female
faculty members are keeping the issue
of the retention of female faculty at
the forefront of the University's atten
tion. She has personally filed a
complaint with the Equal Employ
ment Opportunity Commission and,
with a group of female faculty, has
filed a grievance with a division of the
U.S. Department of Labor charging
gender discrimination in Stanford's
hiring and promoting practices.
We wish Sawislak the best in her
studies at law school at UC-Berkeley
and hope that if she returns to Stan
ford, she will return as Assoc. History
Prof. Karen Sawislak.
