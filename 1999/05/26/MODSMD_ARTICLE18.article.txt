# Breathing Lessons
## Room of one's own on the Farm

LIKE THE majority
of converts, I am a
zealot. Eleven
months ago I lifted my
admissions packet from
the mailbox, screamed and
became such a raging pro
ponent of any and all

things Stanford that I almost forgot my
blood once ran gold and blue.
I transferred to Stanford from UC-San
Diego and have never regretted it. UCSD's
five-college system was more divisive than
unifying, the campus lay deserted on week
ends, and school spirit waned to a pulse
worthy of electroshock. If you have younger
siblings applying to UCSD, save them the
transfer fees and tell them not to go; I know
of several students who transferred out the
same year I did. However, despite my dis
satisfaction with it. there are a few things
that I miss about UCSD.
First, architecture. Every building
looked different. The library's exterior was
filmed as a space ship in "Attack of the
Killer Tomatoes," and red-tiled roofs are
nowhere to be found. Second, resident
assistants. Like at Stanford, UCSD RAs
keep students abreast of social events and
lure them there with food, but they foster
political as well as good-time awareness.
But the most delicious thing about
UCSD is that many places exist where you
can be all by yourself, often without leaving
campus.
You can trek so deep into the Enchanted
Forest of eucalyptus trees that every univer
sity building dissolves from view. On Octo
ber mornings, fog settles in low to the forest
floor like an old man easing into an arm
chair. If you gaze upwards, away from the
fallen cones and bramble, you'll feel tiny

specks of mist' decorate your face on the
way down. One or two dinosauric ravens
skulk over the patchwork of leaves, hut
other than that, your soul is free to relax
and your imagination to wander. Complete
ly and utterly alone.
Stanford surpasses other universities in
countless ways. Everyone gets involved in
extracurriculars, social networking reigns
and — believe it or not — the apathy scale
reads relatively low. Yet throughout Stan
ford life there pervades a self-referential
echo. The "we are at Stanford" or "of
course, this is Stanford" atmosphere is a
fantastically spirited answer to a question
nobody asked.
So sometimes, you need to be alone. To
escape the verbal Stanford paraphernalia
and scrape it off. To meditate and breathe
and revisit more vividly the landscape that
appears every time you close your eyes.
Where do you go?
Is there any place on this campus to feed
your psyche?
I've found a few:
1. Visit the horses. At this very moment,
out past Lake Lag and near the tennis
courts, five or six mahogany and caramel
horses are milling about in an open-air cor
ral. Also, witness hay, flies, water troughs
and all the makings of a suburban farm.
Animals do wonders for the troubled mind,
lower the blood pressure and listen to O-
Chem worries without complaint. Plus,
nothing takes your attention off finals like a
few burrs in your sock. Squirrel Factor: off
the charts.
2. Go to church. Whether you're reli
gious or not, Mem Chu's skyward columns
and intricate mosaics will floor you. The
church has a faint attic-trunk smell to it per
fect for cultivating new ideas, and the

moment the oaken door swings shut behind
you, a gust of air sweeps across your back
like an arm ushering you inside. Campus
tours cycle through the church from
approximately 11 a.m. to noon and 3to 4
p.m. The best time to go is early in the
morning, when sometimes absolutely no
one is there. At 2 in the afternoon, you'll see
a hazy red shadow on the first pew of the
east transept creep into deep violet as the
sun streams through a pane of stained glass.
Squirrel Factor: very low.
3. Language Corner elevators. For those
who really want to get away from every
thing, this little metal box in Building 260 is
a veritable sensory-deprivation tank. No
one uses the elevator late at night. Walk in,
close the door and commence pondering.
One good question to start with is why the
University chose a carpet pattern worthy of
any Las Vegas hotel. Squirrel Factor: errat
ic.
4. Ye Olde Mausoleum. On-campus
escapes are supposed to alleviate the bar
rage of Stanford-ness; why escape to the
tomb of the founders? A trip to the Stan
ford Mausoleum need not entrench itself in
campus history. At the back of the Mau
soleum crouch the building's original,
graphically feminine Sphinxes, naturally
perplexing ... er ... thought provoking.
And behind the tomb, a field of greenery,
purple flowers and the occasional shopping
cart set the scene for the rest of your deep
thinking. Squirrel Factor: moderate.
They're a little weird out here.

Last week, April Van Scherpe received a
blow to her Stanford loyalty. She just found
out that UCSD installed a Ben and Jerry's on
campus.
