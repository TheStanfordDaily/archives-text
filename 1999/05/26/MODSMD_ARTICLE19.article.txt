Profs right about Kosovo
1 1 was with great pleasure that I read
the Campus Viewpoint in yesterday's
Daily, "Rethinking a flawed strategy in
Kosovo." It raised an important philo
sophical question: should we be partici
pants in. or observers of, history?
Let us assume for a moment, as I
believe the signatories of yesterday's view
point do, that it is better to participate in
history.
When we choose to participate in histo
ry, if we are endowed with as little politi
cal agency as the average citizen, we are
left with a rather uninteresting choice: do
we support, or do we not support, a given
policy?
If, on the other hand, we are as power
ful as a politician, a businessperson or, on
occasion, the Crowd, we have a third
option: we can construct policy.
To construct policy without the power
to implement it, however, is at best campy,
at worst, pitiful. Think of Xerxes whipping
the ocean, Scarlett O'Hara shaking her
hand at the sky vowing that she will never
be hungry or Lady Thatcher participating
in the House of Lords.
Either we make a choice that a comput
er could make, become powerful or make
fools of ourselves.
Since I, for one — and I assume a good
number of you — will not have the power
of a President Clinton or a Madeleine
Albright, perhaps it would do well to
explore the second option: become
observers of history.
When we observe history, there is any

number of criteria by which we can inter
pret an event — we need not limit our
selves to the boring question of whether
we support it or not. We can ask, for
example: is it beautiful?
This question in turn gives birth to an
infinity of other questions, like what is the
beautiful, or why is this particular event
beautiful? Or, if we are not prepared to
ask this question, we can simply ask
whether an event is entertaining or inter
esting.
I find the war in the Balkans particular
ly interesting, because it is perhaps the
first aggressive war undertaken by a deca
dent civilization.
Unlike the Song dynasty fleeing to the
south of China, or Rome capitulating
before the Germanic tribes and crowning
a barbarian as emperor, we are unleashing
our sick civilization upon the world.
The values to which Clinton gives lip
service are all subordinated to his need to
preserve life: American lives and the lives
of Serbs and Albanians.
When a missile wanders, NA TO shud
ders. Ground war is out of the question.
Hut perhaps the most amusing aspect of
this war is the opposition.
Educated people who arc well aware of
the Holocaust are unable to see in Kosovo
the pattern of dispossession that leads to
the concentration camp.
When all is said and done, I prefer Clin
ton's decadence to that of his detractors —
for at least he seems to be conscious of his
nihilism.
Kike Nero, fiddling while Rome burns
— though strangely, our Rome is across
the ocean — he is attempting to fashion a

popular and interesting image upon which
future generations can meditate.
His detractors, on the other hand, insist
that moral values should dictate policy, yet
they are scarcely sure which ones. (Non
intervention? Prevention of genocide?
Internationalism? Non-violence?)
It is far too late to revive our civiliza
tion — and would we really want to be a
civilization (like Yugoslavia) that is pre
pared to kill for its values?
Our choice is to become, like Clinton,
completely decadent.

Yesterday's editorial was on target with
regard to the graduate housing crisis, but it
may have left an incorrect impression that
there was a conflict between the Graduate
Student Council and the University
administration.
It also quoted me out of context. You
included my statement that this was"the
worst housing lottery for graduate stu
dents ever," but left out the next sentence
that said, "After all the progress made on
this problem by Stanford administrators
and graduate students, this is very discour
aging."
This was a particularly surprising omis
sion, since it was relevant to your editorial
and since I took precautions to prevent
this kind of excerpting.
When your reporter called me, I
responded by e-mailing this to him with

quote marks around both sentences
together in a conscious effort to stop the
kind of sloppiness in yesterday's editorial.
Students who get quoted in your paper
know this kind of caution is warranted.
Your editorial then went on to admon
ish that grad student responses should be
different this year than last and that "the
allegation that the University isn't doing
enough to improve [the housing figures]
doesn't apply anymore."
Neither I nor any other former or cur
rent GSC members are making such an
allegation.
In the last year, the administration —
and most notably Provost Condoleezza
Rice — has responded to the graduate
housing crisis with hard work, resources,
goodwill and creativity. As I said in my full
quote, it is the fact of these diligent efforts
that makes these results so sad,
1 am no longer part of the GSC, but I
do know that they are contacting adminis
trators to find solutions, and I have tried in
retiring to help them navigate to the peo
ple most able to help.
The results of this housing lottery were
unfortunate. However, since everyone
agrees about the nature of the problem,
calm discussions are needed between seri
ous students and administrators about
solutions.
That is exactly what is happening, and it
is important for The Daily not to inadver
tently editorialize into an otherwise calm
discussion a conflict that does not exist.
