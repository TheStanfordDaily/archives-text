Nine months of much-needed renovation to the Stanford post office will
begin next fall, while temporary modules will house post office boxes and
retail sales during construction.
"1 think that mail services w ill only improve." said Chris Christofferson,
associate vice provost for facilities, who announced the proposal at last
night's ASSIJ Senate meeting.
The project will be put on the top
of the agenda, because allotted feder
al funds must be used before the up
coming fiscal year. "We're trying to
help them to make decisions fast, be
cause we want this to happen."
Christofferson said.
Plans include the creation of three
levels of service within the post office:

self-service, retail service — packag
ing materials, envelopes, etc. — and
regular postal service.
The perimeter of the post office
building will be expanded to where
the columns currently are. and mail
boxes will be put in an interior lobby
open 24 hours a day.
" This is a fantastic thing. Finally
they realize their facilities are inade
quate." said ASSU president Mike
Levin.
The University's planning office is

making suggestions as to where tem
porary modules should be placed.
Ideas include behind Bob and
Xanadu near the Florence Moore
lawn, the parking lot of Lagunita or
the parking lot behind Old Union.
Construction plans for both post
office and parking lot renovations
will be available today at 4 p.m. at 655
Serra in conference room D.
Christofferson encourages all stu
dents to come by and share their
opinions.
