# Campus Viewpoint: Sarah Eisenstein & Oeindrila Dube
## You don't know everything, but you know enough to act 
### 
WE KNOW THAT you hate the
clipboard people in White Plaza!
You know, the ones that are
always harassing you to hand over your
Nike shoes, save the stinkin" whales or sign
a petition to ban horsemeat. OK. so we have
never been out there agitating against
horsemeat, but we have tried to get you to
sign on to many other causes.
But despite most people's belief in social
justice, it is hard for them to commit localis
es they feel they do noi know verv much
about. I o paraphrase Paul L.oeb, a visiting
Haas mentor who got kicked out of Stan
ford <"or his role in a sit-in against the Viet
nam War, "Most people become disempow
ered because they are taught that they don't
know anything. Stanford students become
disempowered because they are taught that
no one can ever know enough to act."
Alter getting arrested for protesting the
cuts in IJ( -Berkeley's Ethnic Studies
Department, we returned to campus eager
to bolster Stanford students' involvement in
the protests. While many joined us — and
some had been out there protesting before
us — many more responded with skepti

cism. They wanted to know the precise bud
getary outlays for both Ethnic Studies and
other departments at UC-Berkeley, Stan
lord and other universities. They wanted
ratios, percentages, absolute numbers, costs
of professorships, enrollment figures, names
of classes being dropped and professors
retiring. While these people approved of
our decision to support the UC-Berkeley
students, nothing short of a PowerPoint pre
sentation would have convinced them to go
to the demonstrations themselves.
We are convinced that students learn
part of this skepticism through the academ
ic environment. We are taught that taking a
strong stance on an issue indicates that we
are either missing or ignoring important
information. The academic emphasis on
expertise, too. discourages people from see
ing the core of an argument. For example, in
the tall we did a presentation urging Stan
lord to divest from a mining company that is
destroying the environment in Irian Java.
Indonesia, and repressing indigenous dis
sent through torture and mass executions.
Audience members wanted to know details
about Indonesian environmental law. The

search for total information can become a
way for people to discredit the expertise of
the activist, rather than simply make an
informed decision.
Moreover, academia posits a clear dis
tinction between "reason" and "passion." It
privileges reason — which is associated with
the endless search for perfect knowledge of
an issue — over passion, which is associated
with action. In this context, students see any
action as "extreme" because it goes beyond
the bounds of reason alone.
Activism requires the faith that you
know enough about an issue and the faith
that your actions can create a better world.
We believe in having solid reasons for act
ing. but sometimes the search for complete
information becomes paralyzing and pre
vents us from protesting. But the night that
we got arrested at Berkeley made it clear
how impossible it is to avoid taking a side.
The police officers did not seem to want to
be there arresting students as we chanted.
"Defending education ain't a crime."
They kept saying. "We don't know any
thing about ethnic studies, we don't have
anything against ethnic studies, we're just

doing our job — we're neutral, we're neu
tral, we're neutral." This neutrality seemed
odd as they dragged peaceful protesters
away in pain-holds and handcuffs. An indi
vidual's contribution to injustice through
compliance with an unjust system can be
opposed to his or her individual, human
responses. An Officer Torres went against
orders and cut off our handcuffs after he
saw that our hands were swollen and discol
ored. One policewoman took off her mask
and seemed to have tears in her eyes. One
of us got arrested after standing up to offer
this officer a tissue.
People on the opposite side are not the
enemy, but they are on the opposite side.
Hiding behind the complexities of a situa
tion does not grant us a magical shield of
neutrality. Claims of neutrality are an
excuse and a way of avoiding truly learning
about the issue.
T his disengagement reminds us of what
we hear from Stanford students while we're
gathering signatures in White Plaza: "We
don't know anything about your cause, we
don't have anything against your cause,
we're just trying to learn — we're neutral.

we're neutral, we're neutral."
We do not want people to aet without
thinking, hut rather, to realize that not act
ing is a form of activism that perpetuates the
existing imbalance of power. This realiza
tion is empowering, because it frees us to act
to change the world, but it is also demand
ing. It requires us to grapple with the infor
mation that we do have. This demand is one
of the reasons we believe so strongly in eth
nic studies. Ethnic studies, by teaching the
history of injustice and struggle against
injustice, teaches that action without knowl
edge is impossible, but knowledge without
action is useless. So we hope that the next
time we ask you to commit to a cause in
White Plaza, you will evaluate the available
evidence and make an engaged and con
scious decision either to commit or not to
commit — and that you will then continue
to learn.
