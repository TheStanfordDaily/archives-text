## Socioeconomic factors increase risk for AIDS High HIV rates found in poor minorities 
### Mariam Ali Contributing writer 
I he 25 women were mainly young, poor
minorities. As they sat on the bus that took
them from East Palo Alto to San Francisco,
they did not say a word. But as the bus
stopped outside the AIDS clinic, everyone
spoke at once.
"We get Safeway vouchers lor coming,
right?"
"Do we get $5 or $10 vouchers?"
Rebecca Denison. the director of Women
Organized to Respond to Life Threatening
Diseases (WORLD), stared in shock as she
struggled to understand why Safeway vouch
ers were more important to these ladies than
the results of their HIV tests.
The lack of basic necessities like money,
health care and information about HIV trans
mission disproportionately exposes poor
minorities to the dangers of HIV. This popu
lation's vulnerability is further magnified by
social and cultural impediments to HIV test
ing and treatment.

"Many people think, 'if I can't access the services, why would I want to
find out that I have HIV?' and then continue their risky behavior."
— Maria Arguilar

"HIV is the l()th on the list of problems for
some of the poorer women 1 work with," said
Denison in reference to the East Palo Alto
women who got tested at WORLD. Denison
contracted HIV in college and now counsels
other women on dealing with the disease. "I
had the privilege of being devastated the day
I found out I had HIV. It is humbling."
Poverty further means that some minori
ties are less likely to have health insurance.
Medical professionals point out that minori
ties often cannot access doctors who can tell
them how to prevent contraction, how to get
tested or how to get proper treatment should
they be diagnosed with HIV.
"Many people think, 'if I can't access the
services, why would I want to find out that I
have HIV?' and then continue their risky
behavior," said Maria Arguilar, program
manager of the Office of AIDS, Alameda
County Public Health.
Cultural factors also appear to influence
people's likelihood to protect themselves
against HIV infection. "Ever heard of
'machismo'?" asked Fernando Sotelo, treat
ment, education and outreach coordinator at
the San Francisco AIDS Community
Research Consortium. Based on his experi
ence, he noted, "Men think they are domi
nant in some Latin cultures — they want their
way and they get their way. They don't want
to put condoms on, they feel it lessens their
manhood, so to speak."
Cultural factors further affect who seeks
medical attention. Service workers say they
see a general distrust of medical practitioners
in many minority communities, which results
in a reluctance to be tested or treated for
HIV.
"A lot of the people who are now getting
AIDS are minorities who use intravenous
drugs, or partners of," said Luther Brock, an
outreach worker at the AIDS Community
Research Consortium. "These people's expe
rience with the 'system' is parole officers —
they think that doctors are part of that 'sys

tern.' "
Referring to his own experience, Brock
added that among blacks, there is a fear that
doctors will experiment on them for research
purposes. The community has not forgotten
the notorious Tuskegee studies when
researchers deliberately infected black men
with syphilis without their consent.
In addition to cultural norms, minorities
often do not wish to get tested for the disease
for fear of social stigmatization. "People
come into the clinic all the time, and even if
they want to get tested, they are too embar
rassed to because a friend might see them,"
Sotelo said.
"People are simply afraid to come out.
They know that other people are scared of
being infected by them. They become isolat
ed — even among their own family mem
bers," said Pastor Lawrence Heart of the St.
John Baptist Church in East Palo Alto.
A lack of information about HIV trans
mission can also be added to the gloomy pic
ture of why poorer minorities contract HIV.
"The messages in the media are mainstream

messages — they have to be general by neces
sity." Arguilar said. "But if the messages are
not specific to the culture or sub-population,
if the social workers don't come from within
that culture — then the members of that
group will either ignore the messages or dis
trust them."
Among certain minority communities, lan
guage barriers prevent some people from
understanding promotional materials. "I deal
with monolingual people every day. If they
can't understand Emglish, they don't under
stand the public service messages, and often
they are afraid to go out and get informa
tion," Sotelo said.
Furthermore, minorities are often taught
about AIDS only minimally at school. In
health or sexual education classes, the issue of
AIDS is generally addressed perfunctorily,
say service workers. "The community has to
push for an issue if they want it to be taught
properly. But if the community does not
know about it — how can they push for it?"
noted Arguilar.
A lack of money, trust for doctors, HIV
education and social support all partly
explain why many minorities "forget about"
or ignore the importance of being tested or
treated for HIV. In 1998, 55 percent of all
AIDS cases affected minorities even though
minorities only account lor 26 percent of the
population, according to the Center for Dis
ease Control.
Moreover, these numbers under-report
the extent of the problem, according to stud
ies.
Currently, .i case is recorded by the Center
for Disease Control only when a person is
diagnosed with AIDS. "The unofficial count
in the field is that there are three cases of HIV
infection to every reported case of AIDS,"
said Arguilar. "Realize that HIV infections
among minorities skyrocketed relatively
recently, so 10 years from now we are going
to be seeing the full extent of the problem —
and it is going to be big."
