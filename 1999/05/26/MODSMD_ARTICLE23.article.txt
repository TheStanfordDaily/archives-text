## Study examines effects of true forgiveness on health 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
When someone makes you really angry, you feel it in your
body. The feeling is even worse when it's someone you love.
Some people liken it to a punch in the stomach or a tightening
around the heart. To make it go away, you might try to "for
give and forget." But sometimes, even saying the words "I for
give you" doesn't help, and the feeling is still there.
Education Prof. Carl Thoresen is one of the leaders of a
unique research project that aims to examine the effects of
anger and forgiveness on health — particularly the heart rate
and immune system. More importantly, the study proposes to
help participants learn how to truly forgive people who have
created pain in their lives — something Thoresen said very
few people know how to do.
"It's far more than just saying, i forgive you,' or believing
it's just a matter of 'forgive and forget,' " Thoresen said. "The
decision to forgive someone is just a step in the process. It's
easier said than done."
The Stanford Forgiveness Project is building on methodol
ogy and research begun by Fred Luskin, director of the project
and a post-doctoral student at the School of Medicine. Fund
ing from the John Templeton Foundation allowed the group
to develop a scientific approach to the study of the relation
ship between forgiveness and healing. The foundation grants
money for research in areas that science has typically ignored.
Thoresen pointed out that while studies on the relationship
between physical and mental health — or on the effects of
religious and spiritual activity on health are flourishing —
many have not adequately controlled for other possible fac
tors that could account for the generally positive correlation
between physical health and spiritual and mental well-being.
For many, forgiveness has a spiritual connotation. Thore
sen said forgiveness is a central tenet of most major religions.
It is also usually very important in the lives of people who con
sider themselves to be spiritual but do not subscribe to any
particular religion.
For the purposes of the Forgiveness Project, though, par
ticipants don't need to have a religious connection to benefit
from the act of forgiving.
"We are looking at forgiveness as one way among others to
cope with life's inevitable hurts ... from a secular perspec
tive," Thoresen said.
The project has a control group of people who undergo the
same physical assessments as the people involved in the for
giveness training. However, Thoresen said, the people in the
control group will also have an opportunity to receive forgive
ness training upon completion of the study, which is currently
at the halfway mark.
So what can participants in forgiveness training expect?
According to Dr. Stephanie Evans, one of the coordinators of
the study, the main purpose of the training is to help people
look toward the future instead of focusing on past wrongs.
Ultimately, it is about being at peace with oneself so that one
can address the grievance that has occurred.
"It's not group therapy," Evans said. "Participants don't
have to reveal their problems, though they can talk about
what's bothering them if they want to." Evans said the week
ly sessions are more like a seminar. People can ask questions
and learn about the physiology of holding onto anger.
The physiological effects of pent-up anger have been well
documented in past studies. As Thoresen explained, the "allo
static load" refers to the burden on your body of living with
chronic distress.
"The allostatic load is the cost to the body of having to con
tinually regain balance." Thoresen said. "If you're always

angry, if you're constantly reliving the moment where some
body wronged you, you jeopardize your ability to maintain
balance." He added that over time, carrying such a heavy load
can lead to disruptions in the body's cardiovascular, metabol
ic. immune and brain functions.
The idea of the study is that the physiology of people may
improve as they learn to forgive.
The project is still looking for more participants, and peo
ple of both genders are encouraged to take part. When the
study was originally announced, the research team had no
problem recruiting women. Both Evans and Thoresen said
they had to alter their tactics a little in order to attract more
men to the project. So they changed their wording from "for
giveness" to "grudge management." It worked.
"We used a different word for forgiveness. Men associate
that with weakness, or something that women do." Thoresen
said.
Evans said that when the study was advertised as a way to
learn grudge management, more men responded.
"We put it in the sports sections of newspapers." she said.
The summer program of the Forgiveness Project begins at
the end of June. More information in participating is available
