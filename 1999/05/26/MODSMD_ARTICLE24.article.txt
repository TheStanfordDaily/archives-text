# Science bug enjoys the view at 3-D IMAX theaters

### Garth Patil Contributing writer 
Q: / went to a "3-DIMAX" theater.
The 3-D effect was much more con
vincing than / remember in the past.
The goggles they gave us were unlike
the traditional red and blue glasses.
How do these new 3-D theaters
work?
A: The days of red and blue filter 3-
D glasses are over. No more stagger
ing out of Captain Eo disoriented
and unable to distinguish colors cor
rectly.
The new "3-D IMAX" theaters
actually rely on a much simpler prin
ciple than the red-blue composite
images. For those of you who
haven't made it through Physics 47
yet. let's start with a crash course in
the physics of light.
Light appears to travel in straight
lines. This linear motion suggests
that light is composed of particles

emitted by a source. However, it
became clear in the 19th century that
certain observed phenomena could
not be explained by this particle the
ory of light.
Enter the wave. Under controlled
conditions, beams of light interfere
with each other as do electromagnet
ic waves. Light's wave-like behavior
is what makes polarization possible.
Light is said to be "linearly polar
ized" when it has a definite direction
of wave oscillation. A polarizing fil
ter. which is essentially a grid of par
allel lines, filters out most of the light
that is not linearly polarized parallel
to the grid lines. In fact, light that is
linearly polarized at a right angle to
the grid lines of a polarizing filter is
not transmitted at all. How well
polarizing materials pass light or
other electromagnetic waves
depends on how that axis is turned
relative to the orientation of the elec
tric field vector of the light.
During the production of a 3-D

film, two cameras arc used. Usually
they are attached to a jig that fixes
them at a set distance, while keeping
their composition and focus synchro
nized. A device that unifies the cam
eras' settings (aperture, shutter
speed and frame rate) is also used.
The camera pair is meant to emulate
how a set of human eyes might see
the scene being shot.
Once the film has been edited
and printed, it is shown in a theater
with two projectors. These projec
tors are fixed at the same distance
and orientation as the cameras used
to shoot the film. Each projector is
fitted with a polarizing filter. The fil
ters are oriented so that each projec
tor will project light that is polarized
at a right angle from the other.
The "sunglasses" you got were
actually polarizing filters. The only
difference between these glasses and
your $2(X) sunglasses is that the
direction of polarization in the 3-D
glasses corresponds to the direction

of polarization of the light emitted by
the projectors. The orientation of the
filter on the left projector is the same
as the orientation of the filter on the
left side of the 3-D glasses. Ditto for
the right.
Applying the above principle,
you'll only be able to see what's
reflected off the screen from the left
projector through your left eye,
because the grid lines in the left filter
of your glasses are parallel to the
polarization of the light from the left
projector. You won't be able to see
what's coming from the right projec
tor through your left eye because the
light's polarization is at a right angle
to the filter.
Now you can effectively see what
the pair of cameras saw while the
film was shot. After the image is
focused onto the retina of your eyes,
the brain processes the image and
you "see" a 3D image.
How does that part work? Per
haps another time.
