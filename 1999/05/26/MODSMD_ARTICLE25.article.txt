■ Saturday: Stanford 3, UC-Santa Barbara 3

It's a rare team that has more fans show up for them
at a distant away game than for the home team.
Its a rare team that can field nearly a full squad of
rookies and walk away with a tie, even in an exhibition.
But the Stanford bowling team is a rare institution.
Over the weekend, the Cardinal bowlers headed
down to Santa Barbara for an ad hoc exhibition with the
Gauchos of I JC-Santa Barbara and walked away with a
3-3 split. The informal match, organized via e-mail with
the Gauchos, provided an excellent chance for the Stan
ford team to showcase its freshman class and remind the

California Intercollegiate Bowling Conference just what
it's missing.
The competition was "just to kind of gauge where we
are and where we're going," said junior captain Ward
Bullard. "These were really the rookies on the team;
these kids had no prior bowling experience, so that's en
couraging."
It's been a rocky but encouraging year all around for
the team. Hie squad withdrew from CIBC competition
earlier in the year due to difficulties gathering participa
tion for some of the more distant tournaments. They
plan, however, to return to league status for next year,
opening next season in October with a tournament in
Montana.
This is also the first year the squad has fielded a full
women's contingent, a development which Bullard
praised.
"The most encouraging signs were the women on the
team, particularly (sophomore] Sarah |McFarlin] and
[sophomore] Becky Novotny."
Bullard said.
Both McFarlin and Novotny won
their matchups. McFarlin triumphed
over Gaucho senior David Ham 131-
103, while Novotny's opponent
didn't show.
The other team win came from
Bullard, who leveled UCSB junior
Jen Soares 160-133.
The other three participants,
sophomore Kevin Gough and
Michael Cummings and sophomore
Mike Berman, competing in his first
bowling team event, fared more
poorly against the heart of the UCSB
order. Gough lost 119-158, Berman
fell 1 IK-186, and Cummings was cut

down 110-2(X).
Herman, who was hobbled by a
devastating bout with the flu during
the competition, highlighted the in
trepid group of about 10 Stanford
fans who made their way down to the
Gaucho lanes.
"The fan support was incredible,"
Berman said.
Billiard agreed. "We basically had
a home lane advantage even though
we were in Santa Barbara," he said.
Both the crowd and the Gauchos
themselves seemed to appreciate the
excitement of the Cardinal squad,
which extended to taking victory laps
around the bowling alley whenever a
team member had a strike.
The Gauchos "were really recep
tive to our energy." Bullard said.
"They were just saying we make
bowling fun."

"1 was pleased with our victory lap
technique," Herman said.
The overall outlook seemed good
for the Cardinal as it heads into the
summer and prime training season.
Ol" next season, Bullard said, "we're
really, really excited about making
some nioves and surprising some
people."
"We're just hoping to help con
tribute to the Sears Cup." Cummings
said.
The three-year old team, which
doesn't yet add to Stanford's Sears
total, is looking forward to more
growth in the next year and perhaps
an eventual upgrade to varsity status.
"It's time for [athletic director
Ted Leland] to wake up." Berman
said. "We might be unconventional,
but did they have a bull skull? No.
And we did."
