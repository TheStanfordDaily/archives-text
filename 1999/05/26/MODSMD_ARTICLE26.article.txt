## Women's golf reflects on NCAA Championships 
### Ben Jones Staff writer 
Mix together an extremely diffi
cult course, the nation's toughest
field and a barrage of thunderstorms
on the last day and you've got a long
weekend of golf ahead of you.
These were among the obstacles
the Stanford women's golf team had
to face as the Cardinal took to the
links at the NCAA Championships
in Tulsa, Okla.. May I^-22.
Despite the treacherous Tulsa
Country Club layout, a Duke squad
that blistered the course in winning
the national title and a final round
canceled due to inclement weather,
the Stanford team put together a se

for the second consecutive year.
Ranked eighth in the country head

Homeyer echoed many of Keev

course and her play.
" The course was really tough and
the scores were very high." said the
All-American from Edina, Minn.
"It's just hard to make birdies out
there; it was just a matter of a great
short game."
Stanford fell back to eighth in the
standings after a third-round 308.
Despite what she called "average"
play, Keever joined Homeyer in the
top-2() â€” both players tied for 15th
place at 227.

her best golf of the year for postsea
