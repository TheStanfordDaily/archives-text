# A 						wind-whipped day
## Women's golf reflects on NCAA Championships 
### Ben Jones Staff writer 
Mix together an extremely diffi
cult course, the nation's toughest
field and a barrage of thunderstorms
on the last day and you've got a long
weekend of golf ahead of you.
These were among the obstacles
the Stanford women's golf team had
to face as the Cardinal took to the
links at the NCAA Championships
in Tulsa, Okla.. May I^-22.
Despite the treacherous Tulsa
Country Club layout, a Duke squad
that blistered the course in winning
the national title and a final round
canceled due to inclement weather,
the Stanford team put together a se
ries of strong rounds, placing eighth
for the second consecutive year.
Ranked eighth in the country head

ing into the event, the Cardinal fin
ished right on track.
Although the players would have
liked some hardware to put in the
Arillaga trophy case, they leave the
tournament with a sense of satisfac
tion after a strong season and a hope
ful vision of things to come next year.
Stanford opened the tournament
with a pair of 304s to stand in sixth
place after day two despite only
mediocre play from some of its top
players.
Sophomores Stephanie Keever
and Hilary Homeyer, who have led
the Cardinal for much of the year,
struggled the first two days on the
difficult course, hut some superb
short game play kept the pair and the
Cardinal in contention.
"The first two rounds I hit it very
poorly," Keever said, "but I chipped

and putted great to hang in there
with 765."
Homeyer echoed many of Keev
er's sentiments about both the
course and her play.
" The course was really tough and
the scores were very high." said the
All-American from Edina, Minn.
"It's just hard to make birdies out
there; it was just a matter of a great
short game."
Stanford fell back to eighth in the
standings after a third-round 308.
Despite what she called "average"
play, Keever joined Homeyer in the
top-2() — both players tied for 15th
place at 227.
Junior Julie Dunn, who has saved
her best golf of the year for postsea
son play, finishing in the top 10 at
both the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships and the NCAA
West Regional, was just one stroke
back in a tie for 21st place.
Twenty-one strokes behind
leader Duke going into the final
round, the Stanford squad looked to
finish with a barrage of low scores.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, the
final round was not meant to be. as
inclement weather forced the even
tual cancellation of play.
After the area was hit by thunder
storms, play was postponed at 3:40
p.m. with most of the teams still on
the course. With no let-up in sight
and darkness approaching, NCAA
officials decided to cancel the final
round and make the third-round
standings final.
That decision may have curbed a

Cardinal run up the leader board.
"It was too bad the final round got
canceled." Keever said. "I saved my
best golf until the end."
One under-par for the day after
the front nine, Keever was only one
over for the day after 13 holes when
the weather sirens announced the
stoppage of play.
"1 was having a great day, so 1 was
pretty bummed out that it got can
celed," Keever said.
With the final round canceled, the
tournament ended with the stand
ings unchanged from the third
round. Duke claimed a wire-to-wire
victory, winning by eight shots over
Arizona State and Georgia.
For the Stanford team, which fin
ished alone in eighth place, both
Keever and Homeyer placed in the
top-2(). It was Keever's second top
-20 finish in as many NCAA appear
ances. She also placed 15th in last
year's event.

Dunn ended up in a tie for 21st.
followed by senior Michelle Sperry.
who finished tied for 48th at 234. and
junior JaeJean Ro who finished tied
for 82nd at 243.
Although they were pleased with
the eighth plaee finish, the Stanford
players said something was missing
from a potential title shot.
"I think as a team we played ok,"
Keever said, "hut not good enough
to really [make a] run at the title this
week."
Looking at this week's play, the
Cardinal players are excited at next
year's prospects. The team returns
four of its top five and six of its top
seven players which makes for an ex
perienced squad buoyed by strong
play this year.
"Overall we had a great year
where everyone really improved
their games." Keever said "We are
really excited for next year: there is
definitely a lot of potential."
