May IS.
Although the Clash fronted its first-team until hall
time. Stanford was only down I -0 following the lirst hall
of play. The ('lash scored on a corner kick followed by a
header into the goal.
"We did very well [in the first half)," said Stanford
head coach Bobby (lark. "We spent a lot of time play
ing without the ball, and we didn't let them get behind
us."
San Jose played its back-up squad in the second half,
and the ( ardinal took advantage and scored all three of
its goals after halftime.
Sophomores Corey Wool folk and Luke Rust, along
with freshman Derek Shanahan, all posted scores for the
Cardinal.
"The team fell really good about themselves, espe

kept our shape and discipline."
Stanford's final match of the spring season was Satur

Two freshman scored the Cardinal's goals — Shana
han and Michael Murphy.
Clark is encouraged by the team's spring plav
Stanford won all live of its matches.

These victories are especially positive for a Cardinal
squad that did not play any of its seven graduating se
niors in the five games.
Two of those seniors are currently playing for MLS
teams — Jamie Clark with the Clash and Simon Elliot
with the Los Angeles Galaxy.
"[Having] two seniors playing in the MLS is quite a
complement to our program." Bobby Clark said.
While the Cardinal will not see any action for several
months, it will start its '99-'OO season a little early with a
16 day preseason trip to Scotland beginning August 1 1.
"It is the perfect opportunity to add to our prepara
tion from the spring." Bobby Clark said.
The trip will mark the opportunity for Stanford's six
recruits to begin play with their new team.
Women's Soccer
The Cardinal women have now also finished their
spring season. Stanford defeated the Mexican National
Team, 3-2. May 17. but lost to Santa Clara. 4-0. Sunday.

"To get that result against a national team makes a
great statement," said Stanford head coach Steve Swan
son. "We also could have easily gotten a few more
goals."
While the loss to Santa Clara was disappointing, the
Broncos will be rated one of the top teams next year and.
according to Swanson. are considered by many to be a
"benchmark."

Sophomore Matthew Moses, shown here in last year's Final Four, and the Cardinal finished the spring
season with five victories and no losses.
Swanson also thinks that,
against Santa Clara, the team con
tinued something it had done
throughout the spring season.
"We lost shape in the second and
didn't always pressure the ball well.'"
Swanson said. "We gave goals away,
just like we have all spring."
Swanson is optimistic about the
spring season as a whole and consid

ers there to be two approaches for
teams — to play games merely for
experience or to play the "best pos
sible competition and see how [we]
measure up," which is the strategy
he prefers to follow.
Stanford has definitely done that
— the Cardinal has played matches
against a top under-18 boys team,
two teams from last year's final four
and two national squads in addition
to several games against other com
petitive schools.
The games against difficult oppo

nents have allowed Stanford to see
that it is in good shape for the up
coming season and has given players
some valuable experience before
they enter next year's title hunt.
With the spring games finished
and the season nearly at a close, Stan
ford now must prepare for next sea
son. With just a couple of weeks to
practice in the autumn before their
first game. Cardinal players must
take summer conditioning seriously
so they can work to integrate new
team members when thev return.
