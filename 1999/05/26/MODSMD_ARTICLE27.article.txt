Stanford won all live of its matches.

These victories are especially positive for a Cardinal
squad that did not play any of its seven graduating se
niors in the five games.
Two of those seniors are currently playing for MLS
teams — Jamie Clark with the Clash and Simon Elliot
with the Los Angeles Galaxy.
"[Having] two seniors playing in the MLS is quite a
complement to our program." Bobby Clark said.
While the Cardinal will not see any action for several
months, it will start its '99-'OO season a little early with a
16 day preseason trip to Scotland beginning August 1 1.
"It is the perfect opportunity to add to our prepara
tion from the spring." Bobby Clark said.
The trip will mark the opportunity for Stanford's six
recruits to begin play with their new team.

great statement," said Stanford head coach Steve Swan
