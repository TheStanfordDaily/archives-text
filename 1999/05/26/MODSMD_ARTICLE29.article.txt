# Synchro hosts first annual fundraiser
## 
### Catherine Chen Contributing writer 
The Stanford synchronized
swimming team performed at its
first annual "Evening of Champi
ons" Sunday evening.
The seven-woman team, joined
by alumnae Heather Pease and
Bridget Finn, took to the waters of
DeGuerre for ils final performance
of the year.
The event was designed by head
coach Gail Emery as a celebration
of the team's second consecutive na
tional title.
The evening began with a catered
poolside dinner and beverages pro
vided by local brewery Gordon
Biersch and Canyon Road Winery.
Senior captain Vanessa Shaw
started off the performance by
swimming her solo that earned her a
first-place finish at this year's na
tionals. Shaw topped off her amaz
ing season by winning the presti
gious I hgh Point Award at nationals
this past March.
Following Shaw, alumnae Brid
get Finn and partner Kim Wurzel
swam their duet. Both Finn and
Wurzel are currently training for the

upcoming Olympic Team Trials in
June.
Senior Emi Kanayama, junior
Julie Enos, and sophomore Kristi
Wright then teamed up with sopho
mores Paige Freiheit and Shannon
Montague and freshman Lindsey
Wigginton to perform a medley of
their trio routines.
Kanayama, Enos and Wright
swam first, to the musical "Chica
go," and Freiheit, Montague and
Wigginton finished up the medley
with a collection of songs from other
Broadway musicals.
Next, Pease and Tammy Cleland
swam their duet.
Both Pease and Cleland are gold
medalists from the 19% Olympic
Games. Pease, a 1998 graduate,
helped lead the Cardinal to its first
national title in 1995.
Included in the show were two
special educational performances.
Members of the team performed
one of the qualifying routines for
Olympic Trials and also performed
a little-known event — compulsory
figures. Four figures were shown
while Emery explained the judging
criteria to the audience.
In the figure event, swimmers
perform slow, scripted movements
before a panel of 5-7 judges. Some
scoring criteria include smoothness
between movements, tightness of
the body positions, control in move
ments (including how slowly move

ments arc performed) and flexibili
ty.
Olympic Trial contenders Frei
heit, Shaw and Wigginton, as well as
Pease, Finn, Cieland and Wurzel,
also showed off an impressive rou
tine which will serve as one of the
determining factors for choosing the
2(XX) Olympic Team.
A live auction of items such as a
Monterey golf weekend, Olympic
paraphernalia and Nike, Speedo

and Jantzen attire also helped serve
as a fundraiser for the team.
As a finale, the seven-woman
squad performed its championship
team routine.
With the graduation of Shaw and
Kanayama, next year's freshman
will have big shoes to fill. But Emery
and the rest of the team are confi
dent that the success of next year's
team will be another cause for cele
bration.
