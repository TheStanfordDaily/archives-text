# Hennessy takes flight
## Future provost will bring his problem-solving skills to bear 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
You get the feeling that if in
coming provost John Hennessy
hadn t spent t he last 25 years as an
engineer, he would have been a
stunt pilot.
Talking to him in his office
perched atop the bustling Ter
man Engineering Building is like
riding a quickly moving plane,
zooming rapidly from a broad
perspective to a focused one and
back out again. I lis vision darts
from high-level educational phi
losophy to low-level practical de
tail in the space of a minute.
"Mv view from K).(KM) feet is
that Stanford has a unique mar
riage of social sciences, humani
ties. engineering, natural sciences
and professional schools and can
grow that in a way to enhance that
across the board." said the outgo
ing dean of engineering.
I ooking at the scenery from
closer to the ground level. Hen
nessy knows he has some serious
issues to face when he moves July
l from Terman to Building l().
Concerns about the tenure
process and faculty and graduate
student housing are waiting for
him. When he takes over for ( on
doleezza Rice. Hennessy also
plans to tackle the increased role
of technology and the enhance
ment of the last two undergradu
ate years.
A new job
Provost. Hennessy said, is not


Josh Haner Daily
a job one auditions for. He was sitting
in his office one day in February when
he received an unexpected call.
" The [University] president calls
you up and says, 'Do you want to do
this job?' " Hennessy recounted.
After about a week of thinking it
over, he accepted the job.
"I went to Founder's Day, and the

provost gave a wonderful address
about how much satisfaction the job
gave her," Hennessy said. "She didn't
mean it as an advertisement, but it did
the trick."
The search committee was unani
mously pleased with the selection of
Hennessy, according to committee
co-chair Lucy Shapiro, a develop
mental biology professor.
"He reached out to undergradu
ales and people in the School of En
gineering. he's deeply committed to
leaching, he has an interest in Stan
ford's professional schools... and he
had a sense of humor," Shapiro said.
Former ASSIJ President Maren
Norton, a member of the search com
mittee. was impressed by I lennessy's
commitment to students.
•| saw him out there at Midnight
Breakfast making a real effort U> get
to know people, and I was really im
pressed how sensitive he was to the
needs of students." she said.
I he committee did not choose
Hcnnessy directly; it sent an un
ranked list ol live or six candidates to
University President Gerhard
( asper. w ho made the final selection.
"We prepared dossiers on at least
45 people ... and spent hours and
hours and hours discussing." Shapiro
siiid. I he committee tried to find a Ic
male oi minority candidate, but "in
the end we were in total agreement,"
about I lennessy. Shapiro said.
I li'iini'ss\ as dean
When I lennessy first arrived on
the I arm. the campus contained nci
tliei the building in which his current
office sits nor the president under
whom he serves. It was F/77, and
I lennessy was an assistant professor
ol electrical engineering.
()ver the next 20 years, he moved
Irom Stanford to the private sector
founding MIPS Computet Systems
and back again, becoming chair ol
Stanford's computer science depart
mcnt m IW4. In IWb he was named
dean ol the School ol I ngi nee ring.
"I have had I hive years to observe
John as dean, and I have found him to
be an outstanding contributor to I ni
\ ersitv endeavors.'" ( asper said.
Colleagues repeatedly compli
ment his problem solving abilities
and ability to enact large-scale soln
lions.
"I le'sgot great vision and a strong
creative influence," said James Hum
mer. chair ol the I leetrical Engineer

ing Department, who has worked
with I lennessy for the past 15 years.
Ilcnnessy's legacy as dean fea
tures increased use of technology in
the learning environment. Under his
auspices, the school has offered its
tirsi online degree program, a mas
ter's in electrical engineering and has
increasingly offered online classes.
•"I le has helped us transition from
a distance education operation that
centered around TV broadcasts to
one that increasingly uses the Inter
net as its delivery medium." said Jeff
Kosefl. chair of the ('ivil Engineering
I)epartment. "I le may not have pio
neered the concept of distance educa
tion. but he is taking it to another
level."
I lennessy views technology as a
learning tool.
" Technology is a way we can reach
out to students," Hcnnessy said. "I
teach my classes on line, and very few
students show up in class. At lirst you
say. 'Jec/. am I a bad lecturer? Is it in
a bad location?' but then you realize
that students like watching the classes
gathered in dorm rooms. It enhances
their learning experience."
I In inand tenure debates
Hcnnessy inherits some hot-but
ton issues with Ins new job. notably
widespread discontent with the hiring
and tenure rates ol minorities and
women.
I .asi spring six professors present
ed a report titled " The Status ol
Women on the Stanford Faculty."
which contended that Stanford does
not hire women in proportion to the
number of available female doctor
ate holders. As of September IWN.
ol Stanford's l,5 l ) 2 faculty mem
bers were women, and 22h were mi
norities.
"When we do our hiring, we're
oversampling from one gender pool
and undersampling from another,"
said Sociology Prof. Cecilia Ridge
wav. one ol the report's authors,
when presenting the report to the
Faculty Senate last spring.
According to Vice Provost for
Faculty Relations Robert Weisbcrg,
"it's goinii to take more effort. We're

not doing all that we could be doing..
.. It's about lighting like cra/y to get
the candidates you want."
Hennessy acknowledged the hir
ing problem, saying, "we solve it by
outreach, by being extremely aggres
sive in recruiting."
As a model he points to his own
school, which hired four tenure-track
women last year. In one instance, "we
had two candidates that were close, a
man and a woman, and the search
committee was split. I said. ' This isn't
a problem; it's an opportunity.' " and
the woman was hired.
Weisberg calls Hennessv's hiring
record "a model for the University...
. What he's done in engineering is
what [Humanities and Sciences] has
been trying to do."
The I Jniversity made a number of
contentious tenure decisions in the
past several years, including initial
denial of tenure to popular professors
Akhil Gupta. Karen Sawislak and
Robert Warrior.
According to Leslie Hummel, a
senior. I lennessy "must restore faith
in both the students and faculty that
the winds of freedom do indeed blow
through Stanford by ensuring that
faculty of color and female faculty are
not only hired and tenured but also
promoted to the highest levels of
leadership in the University."
Hennessy believes that the Uni
versity's tenure issues should be
solved by methods other than affir
mative action.
"We haven't done a good job
communicating with junior faculty,
counseling them to do the best possi
ble job to get tenure," he said. " That
means saying the bad things to them,
not just the good things. If someone's
teaching is not so good, tell them to
improve it.
"Sometimes students feel passion
ately about a good teacher, but the
tough realization that faculty mem
bers need to make is that [tenure is] a
lifetime decision. It's a difference in
perspective."
Building crunch
Another problem awaiting Hen
nessy is the lack of housing for faculty

and graduate students. Housing
prices in Santa Clara county are
among the highest in the nation, and
a number of departments have com
plained that lack of housing has ham
pered their ability to recruit faculty.
"There's not enough housing, pe
riod," Weisberg said. "It's one of the
two primary obstacles to easy [facul
ty] recruitment," the other obstacle
being finding employment for the
faculty member's spouse.
Hennessy calls housing "possibly
Stanford's biggest problem."
" If we d( >n't solve t he facu I tv hous
ing problem, it will be a major prob
lem for Stanford going forward. We
need to view on-campus housing as
an asset. We need that as a set of re
sources to bring in faculty."
I le faces a second housing prob
lem in the lack of available spaces for
graduate students.
" That's a crisis that snuck up on
us," he said. "I've seen students hav
ing to get part-time jobs, which addi
tionally hurts us. because it slows
down graduation rates."
Hennessy commends Casper's
and Rice's "quick action" in pledging
to build more graduate housing and
doesn't rule out plans for more con
struction.
"If we need more, we'll build
more." he said.
Norton said housing is part of a
larger problem of a lack of student
space that 1 lennessy must confront.
"Things like housing space, activi
ty space, recreational space, parking,
are all interconnected, and they're all
ever-present issues," she said.
()ne of I lennessy's greatest puz
zles in viewing the building issue has
been the surrounding community's
hostile attitude toward Stanford and
its building practices. The University
has a land-use permit that limits con
struction — a limit that Stanford will
soon try to increase. The process has
led some residents of Palo Alto and
Menlo Park to charge that the Uni
versity does not consult the commu
nity enough on such projects and to
demand that Stanford dedicate space
in the Foothills as a permanent open
space preserve.

"Boy, it really surprises me," he
said. "II Stanford hadn't been here,
we'd be driving down El Camino
through the plum trees. The price ol
being the most high-tech region in
the world is urbanization."
New projects
Hennessy's plans for the Univer
sity include increased emphasis on
the last two undergraduate years
and a new biotechnology institute.
"We've done more in a short pe
riod to change the first two years ol
college than any comparable institu
tion." he said. Changes have includ
ed launching Stanford Introductory
Studies, which offers seminars to
freshmen and sophomores, and the
creation of Sophomore College.
"I'd like to do more to enhance
the in-depth experience of the next
two years, encouraging more stu
dents to do honors research." he
said.
As a model Henncssy pointed to
a new environmental engineering
program that will bring 30 under
graduates to conduct summer re
search.
1 lennessy's biggest new plan, one
he has begun work on as dean ol the
engineering, is the biotechnology in
stitute he refers to as Bio-X.
"It will involve [Humanities and
Sciences], the Medical School and
the School of Engineering." he said.
"It's an interdisciplinary program
that will conduct research and build
curricula." The program is still in the
planning stages. 1 lennessy said.
1 le hopes that with the new pro
gram. "biology will join the other sci
ences as a support science for engi
neering."
The project has the enthusiastic
support of I lennessy's colleagues.
"Bio-X will be a project that will
bear fruition for the next several
decades," Hummer said.
An engineer takes the reins
Henncssy is the second engineer
to hold the job ol provost in the last
20 years. The other was the recently
deceased Gerald Lieberman, who
held the post twice, most recently on

an interim basis for IS months be
fore the appointment of Rice in
1992.
Shapiro said the committee suf
fered no anxiety over picking an en
gineer as the University's chief acad
emic officer.
"We looked at the person, and he
happened to be an engineer." she
said.
Hennessy knows that it is espe
cially important for him to commu
nicate well with colleagues in the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
many of whom are dissatisfied by the
University's perceived underatten
tion to their fields.
"I'm going to spend the next year
understanding why my humanities
colleagues feel the way they do." he
said.
Finding out colleagues' concerns
is not a new process for Hennessy.
"When I first became dean. I vis
ited all 200 faculty," he said. He ac
knowledged that the process would
be impossible to repeat as provost
but promised to keep in close eon
tact with all areas of the University.
1 le also tried to quell fears t hat an
engineer provost would overempha
size technology at the expense of tra
ditional learning. While technology
can be an asset, he said, "it's not
something you force fit."
Weisberg believes that having an
engineer at the helm will be useful in
facing tough issues.
"Engineers are good at looking at
factual data and drawing logical con
clusions." he said.
According to Koseff. that de
scription fits Hennessy perfectly.
"John believes strongly in the en
gineering approach to solving prob
lems." Koseff said. "He will bring
this approach to bear in dealing with
issues such as housing and the tenure
process."
All agree that Hennessy will have
a lot on his plate over the next sever
al years. In addition to his duties as
provost, he plans to keep a small re
search group and will try to continue
teaching. But from his new cockpit
in the provost's office, the visibility is
high and the view is breathtaking.
