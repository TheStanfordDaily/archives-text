# Lack of incoming transfers affects housing
## 
### Wendy Marinaccio Contributing writer 
Stanford's incoming transfer class will
be 70 percent smaller than last year's, af
fecting housing, orientation and Stanford
in general. Stanford admitted only
transfer students as a result of a high
freshman yield rate.
"It was very hard to say no to so
many." said Dean of Admissions Robert
kinnallv. "Transfers contribute to the

community in a very significant way
they bring a maturity and experience that
really adds."
He called I his ;i "blip year" and said
the Admissions Office plans to accept
fewer freshmen next year and increase
the number ol transfers admitted back to
between KM) and 130. Housing and As
signment Services manager Kathleen
Uransfield said next year's transfers will
be clustered onh in lo\on,I o\on, Kimball and
the freshman/sophomore college.

I his year transfer students are housed
in dorms all over campus, including
Wilbur. Stern. Man/anita Park. Tovon
and Roble. Housing and Assignment
Services attempts to group transfers to
gether as roommates. Bransfield said.
She s;iiil transfers find it helpful to live
with each other, because they have a
"common experience."
.lody Nyherg. a resident student af
fairs specialist, agreed transler students
are more comfortable when at least one

roommate is also a
transfer. because
"there is a better sense
of community."
Sophomore Jeremy
Smart, a transfer who

lives in Toyon and whose roommates are
also transfer students, said he attended
more transfer activities than he otherwise
would, because thev all went together.

For the most part current trans
fer students are disappointed and
surprised by the decrease.
Almost 25 transfer students lived
in Toyon this year, a grouping which
several of this year's transfer class
found beneficial.
Next year, as a result of their de

crcased numbers, groups of transfer
students in each dorm will he small
er.
Sophomore Victoria Galsterer
said transfers seemed to fill in a so
cial gap in Toyon this year, in con
trast with many of the returning
sophomores who were beginning to
get apathetic or lethargic.
Sophomore transfer Clay Floren
is hopeful that the decrease will ac
tually help transfers integrate better

into Stanford. He said transfers and
returning students often don't make
an effort to meet each other, so he
hopes if transfers "don't constitute
such a large part of the sophomore
class it will be easier to integrate
themselves a little faster."
New student orientation will also
be affected by the decrease in trans
fer students. Although the goals will
not change, the venues for the
events will be smaller, according to

Susan Tomaro, a st ude nt a 112 fa i rs of 112 i -
cer at the Dean of Students office
who helps organize orientation.
Abbv Larson, coordinating
transfer orientation this year, said
the mantra of transfer orientation
has been to "hit the ground run
ning." or help transfers assimilate
into Stanford as quickly and pain
lessly as possible.
Sophomore transfer Jenny Phan
said the reduced numbers mav

make this process more difficult.
"The key thing about being a trans
fer student is that adjusting is very
hard, and it helps to have a large
group of students to adjust with you
and go through the same thing with
you."
However the decrease in stu
dents may be helpful for transfer
orientation.
Sarah ( handler, head coordina
tor of new student orientation, said

the reduced number will be a "great
opportunity to form a support net
work for each other, and it will give
[Larson] an opportunity to know
them all."
Susan Zare, coordinator of trans
fer advising at the UAC, said acade
mically transfers will likely be unaf
fected. "We will provide the same
services." she said. "Transfers may
end up getting more individual at
tention."
