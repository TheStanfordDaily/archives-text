Stanford's incoming transfer class will
be 70 percent smaller than last year's, af
fecting housing, orientation and Stanford
in general. Stanford admitted only
transfer students as a result of a high
freshman yield rate.
"It was very hard to say no to so
many." said Dean of Admissions Robert
kinnallv. "Transfers contribute to the

community in a very significant way
they bring a maturity and experience that
really adds."
He called I his ;i "blip year" and said
the Admissions Office plans to accept
fewer freshmen next year and increase
the number ol transfers admitted back to
between KM) and 130. Housing and As
signment Services manager Kathleen
Uransfield said next year's transfers will
be clustered onh in lo\on,I o\on, Kimball and
the freshman/sophomore college.

I his year transfer students are housed
in dorms all over campus, including
Wilbur. Stern. Man/anita Park. Tovon
and Roble. Housing and Assignment
Services attempts to group transfers to
gether as roommates. Bransfield said.
She s;iiil transfers find it helpful to live
with each other, because they have a
"common experience."
.lody Nyherg. a resident student af
fairs specialist, agreed transler students
are more comfortable when at least one

roommate is also a
transfer. because
"there is a better sense
of community."
Sophomore Jeremy
Smart, a transfer who

lives in Toyon and whose roommates are
also transfer students, said he attended
more transfer activities than he otherwise
would, because thev all went together.
