# Sanity for Sixth Man?
## New plans in works for men's hoops tickets 
### Brian Eule Senior staff writer 
Alter the confusion over distribution and allotment
of last season's men's basketball student tickets and
Sixth Man Club memberships, the Stanford Athletics
Department is facing serious debate as to how to allot
student season tickets and club membership next sea
son.
Jamie Zaninovich, the director of marketing and
promotions for men's basketball, announced some ten
tative plans for such a process yesterday.
Instead of a lottery system students would be allowed
to camp out in a line next to Maples Pavilion for a max
imum of five days in advance of ticket sales and would
be granted certain priorities based on year and prior
membership.
According to Zaninovich, the de
cision was reached by a committee of
three Athletics Department admin
istrators, several Sixth Man Club
members, two Business School stu
dents, ASSU Senator Mike Dudas
and ASSU President Mike Levin.
The proposal was brought to the
committee after Zaninovich and
John Hopkins, who will do Zani
novich s job next year, reviewed a 40-
page report on students' views. The
report, provided by business stu
dents in a consulting project, was
based on about 3(X) students' re
sponses to a survey circulated to all
resident assistants.
While Zaninovich said the deci
sion was the consensus of the com
mittee, several of those involved still
have serious concerns about his an
nouncement.
"I have definite doubts about a
line." Levin said. "1 think it's going to
be a difficult thing to implement. I
think we came to consensus [at the
time] that we were going to keep dis
cussing."
Dudas, while supporting the idea
ol camping outside Maples, ex
pressed concern that the general
public was not given a proper voice,
despite the fact that the survey was

open to all students.
Zaninovich, however, said the
people who completed the survey
were the die-hard fans that the club is
designed around.
"I'm pretty confident that the
people that responded are the peo
ple we wanted to serve," he said.
The hope is that men's basketball
season student tickets will be distrib
uted in a fair manner with a better
representation of the Stanford un
dergraduate and graduate popula
tions.
"After what happened last year,
we wanted to do a better job," said
Zaninovich. "We had a system we
thought was going to work [last year).
When we learned it wasn't, we were
scrambling to make things work."
The preliminary plans include the
ideas that:
• There will be a percentage of
tickets, yet to be determined, for
which returning Sixth Man Club
members will have priority.
• There will be a percentage of
tickets, yet to be determined, for
which upperclassmen will have pri
ority, as v\ell as a small allotment for
graduate students.
• There will be no special alloca
tion for overseas students nor stu
dent athletes. A student must be pre
sent or represented in the line.
• The process will be overseen by
1 iopkinsanda University committee
with students appointed by the

ASSU.
• Tentatively, a certain amount of
individual-game student tickets will
he set aside to he sold separately
ahout one week before each two
game homestand.
• The Athletics Department is
contemplating replacing the one
pass student ticket with a strip of
game tickets, so as to he easily dis
tributed among groups.
"This was generated hy students,
addressing their primary concerns,"
Zaninovich said. "'We made sure we
played to all constituencies."
Adminstrators have expressed
reservations in the past ahout having
students camp outside Maples.
"I did express concern last year
that students spent an inordinate
amount of time camping out for tick
ets last year and appeared to take
away from their focus in academics,"
said Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Zaninovich. however, remains
dedicated to the student response
from last season and has heen exam
ining what other universities have
heen doing in such a situation.
"It's easier for us to do a lottery,
hut we are dedicated to ticket the
way the students want to ticket. It's
more work for us hut we represented
the feedback we got," he said.
The Athletics Department plans
to release finali/ed plans and details
during t he first weeks of the fall quar
ter next year.
