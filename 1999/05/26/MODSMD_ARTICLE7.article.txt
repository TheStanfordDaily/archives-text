## County wants perspective on University's land use 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
The Santa Clara County Board ol Supervisors took
several steps toward defining the future of Stanford
land use at its meeting yesterday. I lie board appointed
a group of community advisors to review the process
and defined how tightly development v\ ill be regulated
through the new general use permit and community
plan.
County supervisors approved the list of members
for the ('ommunitv Resource i Iroup. an ml hoc panel
of private citizens and local government representa
tives appointed to ad\ ise the county on Stanlord land
use issues during the process of developing the new
plans.

County supervisor Joe Simitian
said the group would not be expect
ed to make binding recommenda
tions but rather "to make sure coun
ty staff has the benefit of local think
ing."
Simitian said the group repre
sented "an unprecedented level of
community involvement at the ear
liest possible level," and noted that
Stanford has not even formally ap
plied for the general use permit yet.
"When you cut corners on com
munity involvement at the Iront end
of a process, you pay the price at the
end of the process."
He added that the group would
be "an eclectic group by design,
(with | a wide range of views, values,
concerns and perspectives... .That
diversity will be important."
Members of the resource group
were chosen using several criteria.

including their professional exper
tise in land-use-related issues or
their historical perspective on Stan
ford's development.
Resource group member Robert
Augsburger brings both of these at
tributes to the table.
"I've been on both sides — de
velopment and open space — and I
think there's room for both of
them," he said.
Augsburger came to Stanford in
1971 as vice president for business
and finance. He Co-authored a land
use policy for the University with
Robert Rosenzweig, then the vice
president for public affairs and now
another resource group appointee.
Their policy was adopted by the
Hoard of Trustees in 1973.
In 1977 Augsburger left to be
come the first executive director of
Peninsula Open Space Trust.
"I've got a lot of background on
what the issues were then and still
are," he said.
Other members of the resource

group with Stanford ties include
Dorianne Allen, a doctoral student
in biology; Assoc. Civil Engineering
Prof. Stephen Monismith, resident
fellow in Robinson; and Christina
Holloway, a member of Stanford
Campus Residential Leaseholders.
The board also approved county
planners' definition of "zoning level
of specificity," the standard to
which the new community plan and
general use permit will regulate
Stanford development.
According to a planning depart
ment report to the board of supervi
sors, "land uses such as single-fami
ly housing, multiple-family housing,
student housing, academic build
ings, open space and parks will be
designated on the campus through
the map and policies."
"While traditional zoning that
specifies density and setbacks might
be effective in the ... residential
portions of the campus," the report
said, "... 'performance standards'
that are aimed at limiting the im

pacts of development such as traffic
or flooding might be more appropri
ate in the central campus area."
"Larger or more substantial pro
jects will be required to undergo
more rigorous hearings [than] they
are now," it added.
"For the first time ever," Simit
ian explained, "we'll have a commu
nity plan that provides greater clari
ty and specificity about the use of
Stanford land." Specifically, he said,
the plan would detail "the type of
use, the allowable density and the
expected impact" of new projects.
The board also decided that each
of the seven local governments af
fected by Stanford development
will have a single "contact person"
to coordinate and facilitate that gov
ernment's input on the planning
process.
Documents relating to the plan
ning process will be available at sev
eral locations in the area, including
the reference desk at Green Library
and Palo Alto City Hall.
