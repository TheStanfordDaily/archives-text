'Cymbeline' at Shakespeare
at Stinson
Cymbeline
Shakespeare at Stinson
a casual, cozy outside setting, Shakespeare at
112 \f) Stinson delivers a feast with its performance of
tSS "Cymbeline." One can only imagine that the atmos
phere of the Globe theater must have been somewhat like
Stinson beach, though the details may be different. The actors
are fresh and enthusiastic.
"Cymbeline" is cast in quasi-modern dress with whimsical
additions. The Queen wears a black mini-skirt, stockings, high
heels and a long black cape. The villain has dark sunglasses and
a swaggering punk attitude. He draws laughs from the small but
engaged audience with his comic posturing. Imogen gives the
most convincing, ardent and sincere performance.
Celtic music, Dead Can Dance and Lorena McKennit
enhanced the atmosphere. The audience is surrounded by hills,
lovely sunset light, fragrant rose bushes and a minimal, starkly
elegant stage which becomes even more dramatic as the sun
goes down. On a blanket beneath the low slanting stage two
warmly bundled women sit with glasses of wine perched on
their Tupperware containers.
The audience gives a rousing ovation at the end, and all
would agree that they have experienced a well-done, if untradi
tional, evening of Shakespeare.
