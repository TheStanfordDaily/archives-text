## Indian planes fire on Kashmir forces Pakistan threatens retaliation as tensions grow in South Asia 
### 
DRAS, India (AP) — Raising
the stakes between the two new
nuclear powers. Indian aircraft tired
on separatist guerrillas in Kashmir
province yesterday and Pakistan
threatened retaliation. It was the
first use of air power in years in the
long-running conflict over the
Himalayan border region.
India said it had blasted at Pak
istani soldiers and guerrillas
entrenched in rugged, snowcapped
mountains in the Indian-held part of
Kashmir. Pakistan, however, denied
that its troops were involved and
said India's aircraft had bombed
Pakistani territory.
Indian aircraft began attacking
rebel positions in the 17,(KK)-foot
peaks at dawn. Later, warplanes and
helicopters were still roaring over
Dras, a village a mile from the Line
of Control that divides Kashmir
between the two nations, and the
faint thud of bombs could be heard
across the hills.
Pakistan called the airstrikes a
grave escalation of tensions. " Pak
istan armed forces reserve the right
to' respond." military spokesman
Brig. Rashid Quereshi told The
Associated Press.
American and British ambas
sadors in New Delhi met Indian
Defense Minister George Feman
des and urged restraint by both
sides. IJ.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan called on all parties to stop
the fighting, spokesman Manoel de
Almeida y Silva said at I J.N. head
quarters in New York.
It was the first major confronta
tion between the two neighbors
since they conducted nuclear tests a
year ago and declared themselves
nuclear powers. India and Pakistan
have fought three wars, two of them
over Kashmir.
Indian and Pakistani soldiers

exchange fire along their disputed
frontier almost every day. Indian
soldiers also frequently open fire to
thwart Pakistan-based guerrillas
trying to cross into Indian-held
areas to light for independence for
Kashmir.
This time. Indian satellite photos
showed that about 6(H) guerrillas had
pushed nearly four miles into India's
territory, taking advantage of the
melting snow to occupy posts Indian
soldiers had vacated at the onset of
winter.
Indian 1 lonie Minister Lai Krish
na Advani. who is in charge of inter
nal security, said "the intruders this
time comprise Pakistani army regu
lars as well as mercenaries and this
operation will be smashed."
Advani rejected the Pakistani
charge that Indian aircraft had
bombed Pakistan, saying the strikes
were "well inside" Indian-controlled
parts of Kashmir.
The government said it was con
cerned at the number and tenacity of
the infiltrators.
"This is the start of operations
and they will continue until our
defense forces reoccupy our territo
ries. Any escalation of this conflict
will be entirely the responsibility of
Pakistan." the Defense Ministry said
in a statement.
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry told
reporters that the directors general
of Indian and Pakistani military
operations would hold talks "in an
attempt to defuse the situation." But
Pakistan's army said the two direc
tors general spoke on Tuesday and
India did not warn Pakistan of the
airstrikes.
Pakistani military spokesman
Quereshi said that in the last 17 days
India had moved jet fighters, heli
copter gunships and an estimated
12.0 CX) soldiers into the area.
