# Yugoslavian leader faces prosecution by U.N. for atrocities
## Milosevic indicted for war crimes 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The
world tribunal that prosecutes war
crimes has indicted Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic for atrocities in
his homeland and will announce the
action as early as today, U.S. offi
cials said.
The officials, speaking yesterday
on condition of anonymity, said
they were told the indictment was
handed down Tuesday by the II.N.
body in The Hague, Netherlands.
"The decision has been made,"
one official said.
The action by the tribunal comes
as NATO intensifies its bombing in
Kosovo in an effort to pressure
Milosevic to withdraw his Serb
troops from the province and end
attacks on the ethnic Albanians
who live there.
The U.N. court's chief prosecu
tor, Louise Arbour, said she would
make "an important announce
ment" today, but she would not
confirm an indictment. The tribunal
never comments on indictments
before announcing them.
However, a diplomatic source at
NATO headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium, told The Associated Press
that an indictment of Milosevic
appeared to have been in the works
for several weeks.
The indictment may indeed have
been issued in secret at an earlier
date, a tactic the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal used in arranging
the capture of suspects in connec
tion with the Bosnian war-era atroc
ities it was set up to prosecute.
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said it would be inappro
priate for her to comment. And
White House spokesman Joe Lock
hart. in Yulee, Fla., where President
Clinton was on vacation, had no
comment.
Russia's ambassador to the Unit
ed Nations said an indictment of
Milosevic would only undermine
international efforts to reach a
peace deal over Kosovo.
Stressing he had only heard
reports that an indictment was
imminent. Ambassador Sergey
Lavrov said it would cause "serious
consideration in Moscow," which is
trying to broker a settlement. "This
would be counterproductive," he
told reporters.
As troubling accounts of alleged

massacres and rapes continue to
come from ethnic Albanians fleeing
Kosovo, the tribunal has faced
increasing calls from human rights
groups, politicians and others to
indict top Yugoslav officials.
On Monday, the U.S. Senate
passed a resolution urging "vigor
ous investigation" of genocide and
other war crimes in Kosovo. It
urged the tribunal to issue indict
ments of those responsible "regard
less of their position within the Ser
bian leadership."
In doing so. the court would be
bringing charges on the basis of so
called "command responsibility" —
the failure of leaders to prevent or
punish war crimes carried out by
subordinates.
Sen. Arlen Specter. R-Pa.. who

has long advocated that Milosevic
be indicted, said on the Senate floor
yesterday that such an action would
be "good news. It shows the war
crimes tribunal means business."
There had been speculation that
a negotiated settlement to end the
war could include a deal providing
Milosevic with at least limited
immunity from prosecution for war
crimes. However, the tribunal has
always vowed to follow the chain of
command to the top, and Arbour is
known for ignoring the political
consequences of indictments.
Arbour, a Canadian judge
known for her toughness, has not
confirmed reports that she may
soon leave the tribunal to take a
seat on the Canadian Supreme
Court.
