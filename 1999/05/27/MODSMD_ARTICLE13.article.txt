BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Blasts rever
berated throughout dozens of Yugoslav cities yester
day during a record number of NATO attack flights,
which zeroed in once more on President Slobodan
Milosevic's villa and hit army barracks and command
posts.
Allied jets bombarded Kosovo's capital, Pristina, its
surroundings and the northern city of Novi Sad, Serb
media reported. Sustained NATO strikes also were
reported in central and southern Yugoslavia as well as
an area north of the port of Bar in Montenegro, the pro-
Western republic that along with Serbia makes up
Yugoslavia.
NATO reported early yesterday that it had flown
650 sorties in the previous 24 hours, including a record
284 attack flights, hitting artillery, tanks and mortars in
Kosovo. It said all aircraft returned safely.
Targets also included television and radio relay sta
tions in Belgrade and several other cities. A wide
range of army barracks, ammunition storage sites,
command posts and petroleum storage sites also were
hit.
Alliance jets also focused again on Milosevic's villa
just west of Belgrade, which NATO says contains a
command and control bunker. It is believed to be
Milosevic's main hideout, but his whereabouts were
unknown at the time of the attack. It was the fourth
time NATO has targeted the villa.
The Serb-run media center in Pristina said two
children were killed and one seriously hurt Wednes
day morning when a NATO missile hit the village of
Radoste near Orahovac, 40 miles southwest of Pristi
na.
The state-run news agency Tanjug said a woman

and a child were wounded when three missiles hit
their home in the village of Gazivode, in northern
Kosovo. Tanjug also said three people were injured
when a missile hit the courtyard of a private home in
a suburb of Novi Pazar, about 1(H) miles south of Bel
grade.
Serb media also reported attacks on the cities of
Uzice, where an airfield has been targeted repeatedly:
Izbica, also near Novi Pazar: and Mount Tara. 85
miles southwest of Belgrade. The Beta news agency
said two missiles slammed into and damaged apart
ment buildings in the outskirts of Zajecar. 115 miles
southeast of the capital.
In neighboring Albania, an Associated Press Tele
vision News team at the Morini border crossing saw
several mortar rounds exploding and heard automat
ic weapons and tank fire as Serbian forces clashed
with guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
International monitors from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe reported Serb
shelling of three Albanian villages near the border
and said a man and a young woman were killed when
a mortar shell hit a house in the village of Sahani.
More than 840,000 people — mostly ethnic Alba
nians— have fled Kosovo. Before the NATO air
campaign began March 24. Kosovo had a population
of 2 million of whom 9() percent were cthnic Albani
ans.
Despite the NATO bombings. Milosevic has so far
rejected the key element of a U.S.-backed peace plan
for Kosovo — the deployment of NATO-led troops to
secure the safe return of hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled his crack
down.
