# Shooting stirs racial tensions in L.A.
## Community leaders meet with police to address concerns 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Black community
leaders spent two hours with police Chief
Bernard Parks yesterday, venting their "outrage"
over the shooting death of a homeless woman
who was waving a screwdriver.
"We don't consider a screwdriver a deadly
weapon," said Brotherhood Crusade Director
Danny Bakewell, standing in front of police head
quarters following the closed-door meeting.
"Why did they even stop this woman in the first
place?"
Friday's shooting has already initiated investi
gations by the FBI and the Police Commission.
Margaret L. Mitchell, a 54-year-old grand
mother whose advancing mental illness drove her
onto the streets, was stopped bv bicycle beat cops
and asked if she was pushing a stolen shopping
cart.
Officers Edward Larrigan. 27. and Kathy
Clark, 29. drew their weapons after Mitchell
pushed the cart at them and walked away, police
said. The officers, seeking to calm the woman,
confronted her again, according to Cmdr. David
Kalish.
Mitchell lunged at Larrigan with a screwdriver,
forcing him to jump away and fall on one knee.

Kalish said. Larrigan then shot Mitchell in the
chest. She died a short time later. The Wilshire
Division officers have been reassigned to detec
tive training, Kalish said.
Bakewell. accompanied by members of the
NAACP and the Nation of Islam, said Parks
pledged a "lull and comprehensive investigation."
Despite the chief's firing of more than 50 offi
cers in the last year, Bakewell said "there is a
holdover of a cowboy mentality, certainly a racist
mentality" in the department.
At the same time, rage in the black communi
ty "is at an all-time high," Bakewell said. "There
is a tremendous discomfort on the part of the
community that things are happening to black
people and are now moving from black men to
black women."
Bakewell nonetheless appealed for calm dur
ing the investigations. On Tuesday he joined
about 350 protesters angry over the Mitchell
shooting and a recent decision by neighboring
Riverside County's district attorney not to prose
cute officers who in December fired 23 bullets at
Tyisha Miller, killing the black teen sitting inside
a locked car with a gun in her lap. Police say she
appeared unconscious but then sat up and

reached for the weapon.
Contrary to earlier reports that officers Larrig
an and Clark were white. Los police
spokesman Lt. Anthony Alba sai(i Wednesda\
that Larrigan is of Hispanic descent and Clark is
Asian American.
The woman's son. Richard Mitchell, hired
Beverly Hills civil rights attorney Leo Terrell,
who is demanding an independent autopsy. The
coroner's office said Margaret Mitchell died from
a single shot fired at an upward trajectory that
entered her chest and exited her back.
Terrell claims he lias three witnesses who say
Mitchell posed no threat when she was shot at the
intersection of Fourth Street and La Hrea.
On Tuesday, Parks gave the Police Commis
sion a preliminary report of the incident, saying it
is being investigated but appears to be within the
department's officer-involved-shooting guide
lines. The commission will decide if that is true.
"Public opinion is molded daily and it's easier
to be Monday morning quarterbacks than it is to
be police officers, but when it's a screwdriver vs. a
gun, the public is going to want some account
ability," said Deirdre Hill, a former member and
current inspector general of the commission.
