Police brutality case will continue
NEW YORK (AP) —The judge in the city's
police torture case rejected motions for a mistrial
yesterday and told the jury that the trial would goon
without the officer who pleaded guilty the day
before.
U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson explained
to the jurors that Justin Volpe's plea ol guilty to vio
lating the civil rights of a Haitian immigrant
shouldn't he used as evidence in determining the
guilt or innocence of the remaining four officers
charged in the case.

Minutes earlier, with the jury out of the court
room. two defense attorneys had asked Nickerson to
declare a mistrial. They said the jury, knowing that
the lead defendant was guilty, would assume the
worst of the remaining defendants. Nickerson reject
ed the argument without comment.
Volpe admitted ramming a stick into the hand
cuffed victim's rectum, pulling it out and putting it
up to his face to humiliate him. He said he was angry
because he believed, mistakenly, that Louima had
punched him while police tried to quell a disturbance
outside a nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997.

Gov. vetoes execution moratorium
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Gov. Mike Johanns
vetoed a measure yesterday that would have made
Nebraska the first state to put a moratorium on execu
tions.
Johanns said the moratorium would be poor public
policy, and death row inmates would use it as a basis for
unnecessary appeals.
The bill would have put a two-year moratorium on
executions while a study was done to see if the death
penalty is applied fairly. Death sentences could have
been issued during the moratorium, but no executions

would have taken place.
It appears unlikely that lawmakers have enough
votes to override the veto.
Strawberry pleads no contest
TAMPA. Fla. (AP) — New York Yankees outfield
er Darryl Strawberry pleaded no contest to drug and
solicitation charges yesterday and awaited word on
whether he would be allowed to play baseball again.
Strawberry, 37. was sentenced to IS months of pro
bation and must be tested for drugs twice a week during
that time, along with KM) hours of community service.
