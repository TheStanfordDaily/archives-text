Post office changes
may alter image of
much-maligned service

A YEAR FROM now, every
one's favorite campus target
for griping may no longer be
a source for ill will
A plan to renovate the post office
and expand its facilities was
announced at Tuesday's ASSU Sen
ate meeting by Chris Christofferson,
the associate vice provost for facili
ties.
Beginning next fall, the post
office's interior will be modified to
extend the sides of the building and
create interior space for improved
service. Mailboxes will be placed in
an interior lobby open 24 hours a
day. A new three-tiered system will
be created within the office, with sep
arate areas for self-service, such as
stamp vending machines; retail ser
vice, where packing materials and
other supplies can be purchased; and
the one-on-one counter service that
the post office currently employs.
Though the nine-month renova
tion project is sure to cause some
inconveniences — temporary mod
ules will be set up to house post
office boxes and postal services —
this seems to be a small price to pay
for the benefits to be reaped.
The post office has gained notori

ety for its long lines and slow service.
As things are currently set up, almost
all post office customers must stand
in the same line regardless of the ser
vice they need.
With the implementation of a
three-tiered system separating the
post office's services, customers can
wait in one of three shorter lines
instead of one long line as they do
now.
Also, with similar transactions tak
ing place in each particular section of
the post office, the potential for more
efficiency of service is increased.
A changed post office may also
mean that students can no longer
bike up to check their mailboxes,
since they will be moved to an interi
or lobby.
Again, this is a change that stu
dents will have to adjust to. Clearly,
in the long run, an expansion of the
post office will provide more effi
cient service.
Of course, any configuration the
post office takes will leave some
unhappy. Anything involving stand
ing in a line and waiting will cause
customer impatience.
Hut the planned changes to the
building and the way service is pro
vided will surely alleviate a condi
tion that few are currently satisfied
with.
I Tie post office may soon become
a place that students — gasp — are
actually content with.
