# From the trenches
## Give yourselves a break this week 
### 
Erin Bouchier

Finals, finals,
finals. Got to start
planning. Have to
time manage. Over the
next week and a half I will
become one with the
library. OK, maybe the
library is pushing it — I'll
become one with the Cor-

ner Pocket. I'll get up every day at dawn and
study, study, study until midnight. I've got to
write out a schedule, planning every minute
of every day. Got to plan. Wake up at 7.
Study until 12. Lunch from 12:(X) to 12:07.
Study....
(Enter carefree dormmate)
What's up?
Oh, you know, just getting ready for
finals.
Really? It's ktiid dpSarly for that, isn't it?
Oh, I don't think so. I mean, 1 have SO
much work to do in the next week and a half.
Three papers and three finals. I have to
make sure none of it sneaks up on me.
Check it out, I've already made out a study
schedule.
Yes, you sure did. I'm not really sure what
to say about that... do you want to go out to
dinner?
I don't really have time for dinner. I'm
supposed to be studying at the Corner Pock
et right now. You know I should really stick
to the schedule.
Guess so. I hope you can pencil me in on
that schedule sometime before graduation.
(Exit disgruntled dormmate)
Gosh, that was a little rude. You would
think he would be more supportive. I guess
he's just too superficial to understand a
friend immersed in academia. I can't believe
he snickered at my schedule. Bov, is he

going to be jealous of my time management
skills when finals come around and he's
totally unprepared. No time to worry about
him. Got to get back on schedule — off to
the C0P0....
(Enter smiling friend)
What are you doing with all (hose books?
You look a little loaded down.
I'm off to study for finals.
Already? You're super-prepared — actu
ally, you look a little stressed. Do you want to
go over to the shopping center and just wan
der around for a hit, relax and blow off some
steam?
Just wander around? Are you kidding
me? Do you really think anyone has time to
wander? Um, hello? It's finals. Why don't
you ask me next fall.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
And spend three of my precious hours
helping you find the perfect pair of periwin
kle capri pants? I don't think so. Let me save
you some time: capri pants are hideous.
Whether the fad lasts for four more months
or four more years, nothing will change the
fact that they look ridiculous. Unless you're
expecting some serious floods, please save
yourself and your loved ones the embarrass
ment and pass on the capris. It would be
wiser to spend your time studying and spend
your money on some coffee.
Wow. Guess you had an opinion on that
one. Um, good luck studying, / guess.
(Exit frowning friend)
Shopping? Capris? How ridiculous. How
trivial. No time for frivolity. Must fill my
head with Karl Marx and Java Script. Study,
study, study. Become one with the C0P0....
(Enter relaxed classmate)
Don 't you look academic today. On your
way to the library or something? Hey, are

you going to that party tonight?
Library, yes. Party, no! It's finals! You
know, those big tests that count for more
than 50 percent of your grade — remember
them? And you think I should go to a party?
Are you worried that 1 would miss out on
enjoying its bacchanalian splendor: a few
people dressed up for some inane theme,
everyone else in black pants or khakis, beer
being spilled everywhere, speakers blaring,
bass pumping? Unique, don't you think? It's
going to be just like every other party, every
other weekend! Definitely not worthy of a
spot on my agenda.
Well, maybe you're right. Missing the
party won 7 mean the end of life as you know
it. Hut going would provide a chance to see
some friends and enjoy some conversation.
Friends, conversation — remember them?
Are you really planning on forgoing normal
human interaction for the next week and a
half? For your sake, I certainly hope not.
Think hack for a minute. Were academics
your sole purpose in coming to college? Ever
heard of social growth? College provides a
whole lot of it. And from the looks of it, you
could use a little studying in that area.
Wow. That was pretty harsh, but maybe I
have gone a bit overboard with my finals,
finals, finals mantra. I guess it won't kill me
to take a little time off from studying. I'll
have to revise my schedule a little bit, maybe
redistribute my time ... but I think I can fit
that party in.

science. As the finals crunch approaches,
please remember to occasionally leave your
studying cocoon and return to the real world
for a few hours. It may even improve your
grades.
