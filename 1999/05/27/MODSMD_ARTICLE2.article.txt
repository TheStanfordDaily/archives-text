# Science Quad will be done by fall

Alter a delay of more than live
months, the Science and Engineering
Quad's electrical engineering build

final building. McC'ullough Annex,

The $l2()-million project was
made possible through a donation
from William Hewlett and David
Packard — at that point the single
largest gift in Stanford's history.
Of that money $62.5 million was
allocated towards the construction of
the improved quad, and construction
began in 1996.
The entire project was originally
slated for completion in December
199 K. However construction in the
science quad has run into unantici
pated delays.
According to Dan Rogers, of the
University's capital planning and
management office, "the general de
lays were a result of specific project
related delays. Delays are to be ex
pected from a any complex project of
such magnitude."
Both the teaching center and Se
quoia Hall opened six months be
hind schedule at the beginning of the
1998 spring quarter.
The teaching center, the focal
point of the project, replaces the old
Physics Tank. It includes two large
state-of-the-art auditoriums, which
accommodate about 4(H) and 2SO stu
dents each. They also feature full
multimedia and Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network capability.
However, far from being
awestruck, student reaction to the
new facilities in the recently opened
Teaching C enter has been mainly in
different.
"It's just like any other classroom,
except that it's new and has some
high-tech gadgets." said freshman
Ati-swol I lu.
"Despite the fact that it was mod

ern, it wasn't really conducive to
learning, because it was so cramped."
said freshman David Bronner.

of the inadequacy of substitute class

proximate site of the building of the

same name that was demolished to
make room for it. mainly contains of
fices and conference rooms. There is,
however, a 49-seat classroom located
on the second floor.
The 122,(X X )-sq ua re-fix )t elect rical
engineering building will house the
department's "administration offices
and undergraduate instructional lab
oratories." Rogers added.
The McCullough Annex is de
signed to serve as the lab building of
the Materials Science Department
and boasts 33 laboratories. These

labs will be dedicated to the research
of advanced materials and will pro
vide research opportunities for grad
uate students from various science
and engineering disciplines.
The buildings will be connected
by walkways and freestanding ar
cades.
"The connective elements are the
unifying focus for this new quad."
said Rogers. "The landscaping ele
ments will provide circulation pat
terns and areas to sit. study and so
cialize."
