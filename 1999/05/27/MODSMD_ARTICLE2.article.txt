exercises and. therefore, must be fin
ished bv the beginning of June.
The $l2()-million project was
made possible through a donation
from William Hewlett and David
Packard — at that point the single
largest gift in Stanford's history.
Of that money $62.5 million was
allocated towards the construction of
the improved quad, and construction
began in 1996.
The entire project was originally
slated for completion in December
199 K. However construction in the
science quad has run into unantici
pated delays.
According to Dan Rogers, of the
University's capital planning and
management office, "the general de
lays were a result of specific project
related delays. Delays are to be ex
pected from a any complex project of
such magnitude."
Both the teaching center and Se
quoia Hall opened six months be
hind schedule at the beginning of the
1998 spring quarter.
The teaching center, the focal
point of the project, replaces the old
Physics Tank. It includes two large
state-of-the-art auditoriums, which
accommodate about 4(H) and 2SO stu
dents each. They also feature full
multimedia and Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network capability.
