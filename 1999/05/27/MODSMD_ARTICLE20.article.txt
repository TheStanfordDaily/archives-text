Spectators are also participants
It was with an unmistakable sense of irony
that I read J. Bradford Anderson's letter in
yesterday's Daily highlighting the option of
non-action, immediately after reading the
nearby Campus Viewpoint "You don't know
everything, but you know enough to act."
In the letter, which was a response to
Tuesday's Campus Viewpoint "Rethinking a
flawed strategy in Kosovo," Mr. Anderson
identified what 1 also believe is an important
philosophical question: "should we be par
ticipants in, or obervers of, history?"
I suggest the former, but what is equally
important, I think Mr. Anderson is wrong if
he thinks he can demarcate the difference.
Being spectators to the world's political
events (or are we already reading history?) is
a way of participating in those events. Does
not Mr. Anderson, in the end, choose the
"uninteresting" option of supporting the
war?
Perhaps we can really assume aesthetic
neutrality about the war, or question the lit
erary worth of bombing Yugoslavia, but can
we on these grounds condemn the moral and
political concerns of "Mr. Clinton's detrac
tors," as Mr. Anderson would have us do?
Mr. Anderson tries to paint those
opposed to the war as lost in a world of con
flicting morals, yet with regard to his list
"Non-intervention? Prevention of genocide?
Internationalism? Non-violence?" I think
Tuesday's Campus Viewpoint clearly indi
cates the authors' replies: no, yes, yes, yes.
Without further argument, Mr. Anderson
has relied on the dichotomous reasoning that
the "Rethinking..viewpoint reveals as

Hawed — there are more than the two choic
es of supporting or withholding support of
NATO's war.
What is a stake here is not only the ques
tion of NATO's war but something equally
insidious: Mr. Anderson pokes fun at those
who choose to use moral or political argu
ment to protest the world's events, while
simultaneously supporting these events on
unexplored moral grounds. Combined with
his portrayal of the choice to participate in
the world's events as uninteresting, we have
a dangerous formula for spectatorship, how
ever "interesting." The letter, on the whole,
strikes me as an attempt on Mr. Anderson's
behalf of justifying his commitment to com
parative literature over political involve
ment. 1 recommend he try both.
I think history has shown that it is not only
the policy-makers that control world events.
When people stand up in large numbers for
values they believe in, world events are
changed. Incidentally (and I have taken a
few comparative literature classes), I think it
is also beautiful.
One further question: when we write let
ters to The Stanford Daily publicizing our
choice to observe the world's events (i.e. his
tory), are we not participating in those
events?

Society can also shape policy
It was interesting to read two pieces in
yesterday's Daily that were polar opposites
regarding the layperson's attitude to policy

issues (the letter by J. Bradford Anderson
and the Campus Viewpoint by Sarah Eisen
stein and Oeindrila Dube).
It seems to me that Anderson draws a
false dichotomy between participating in,
and observing, history. Consequently, he
appears to be too dismissive about the
layperson's power to "construct" policy. The
analogy he draws with Scarlett O'Hara
proves the opposite of the implied claim:
what began with "shaking her hand at the
sky" ended with Scarlett completely trans
forming her life and fate. We are laypersons
who are fortunate to be potential partici
pants in a liberal, democratic society and
polity, with a substantial potential to influ
ence and eventually construct policy.
History is replete with examples of the
blossoming of small initiatives: the Buddha,
Christ, Gandhi and King in the moral / social
sphere. Gates and the Grameen Bank in the
economic sphere, Mao and Lenin in the
political sphere. The power of civil society is
far from dead, as Eisenstein and Dube have
shown both in their article and in their
activism.
My point is to reject Anderson's implied
exhortation to renounce participation and
turn observers of history. His view would be
more akin to the fiddling Nero than would
Clinton's, as he suggests.
A related point: there is a great danger,
not just in accepting this false dichotomy, but
also in being dismissive about the question of
whether or not to support a policy "con
structed" by others — what's more, in calling
it "boring" and "uninteresting," as Anderson
does. There is an effective counterpoint
offered by Eisenstein and Dube. They point
out that while action without knowledge can

be dangerous, knowledge without action is
useless. In other words, as members of the
civil society, there is — or ought to be — a
double imperative on us to both know more
about policy issues and to act on that knowl
edge. I do not understand why this should be
inherently boring or uninteresting; it
depends on the creativity, thoughtfulness
and passion of the person involved. In saying
this, I am not disputing Anderson's earlier
philosophical point: that there are many dif
ferent — a priori arbitrary — criteria to
interpret an event. But the next logical point
would seem to be to ask, is there a less rela
tivist view in interpreting the event? Any
attempt to proceed from such a primary "it
all depends" view would involve — short of
exalting that primary arbitrariness by putting
a full stop to further investigation — subjec
tive mechanisms prioritizing the criteria
involved. There is a primary legitimacy in
asking "is it beautiful?" to NATO's policy of
bombing Serbia, but doesn't Anderson feel
that this may not be the most relevant crite
rion? Eisentein and Dube imply that there is
a sense of right in taking an informed stance
rather than devolving to an ideational
nihilism.
To me, maintaining the false participant
observer dichotomy and also maintaining an
inordinately large preoccupation with inter
pretative criteria somehow trivializes the pol
icy issue. Whether or not NATO's stance is
the sign of a "decadent civilization," as
Anderson bluntly states, I believe that such a
trivialization of the policy issue definitely
qualifies for that ignoble phrase.
