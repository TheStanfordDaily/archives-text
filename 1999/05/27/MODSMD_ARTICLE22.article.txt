■ Friday-Sunday:No. 4 Stanford
(33-6) at Nationals in Boulder. Colo.

Although the beginning of the
season was slow, the team came
down the final stretch hard and fast,
ending the season with a 33-6 record
and a No. 4 national ranking. Stan
ford enters nationals in Boulder,
Colo., as a No. 6 seed, a place that
many team members believe is to
their advantage.
"Most people don't think we have
much of a chance, being the sixth
seed, but we like our situation." said
economics doctoral student Daniel
Eisenberg. "We are going to sneak
up on some teams and eat them for
breakfast. We've finished second the
past two years, so we'll be plenty
hungry."
Anyone would be hard pressed to
argue with this assessment, especially
after watching the team work out on
Roble Field. According to senior co
captain Onier Atesmen. practice has
been much more intense than usual
between regionals and nationals. 11c
credits this to a desire he and his fel
low captain, senior Scott Johnston,
had for the team to peak at nationals.
Stanford has had a tendency in the
past to peak at regionals. but this year
it looks to be stronger than ever as it
heads to Boulder.
"I think everybody senses that wc
can win nationals, and the natural re
sponse is to push yourself to be a bet
ter player." Atesmen said. "For many
of our younger players, defense is the
their first priority and good defense is
purely athletic."
Their athleticism will be well test
ed in a field that includes not only
Santa Barbara, but also Brown. Col
orado. Carleton and North Carolina
State. Stanford will also have to deal

with the elevation at Boulder, which
is over S.IHK) feet.
"The altitude shouldn't be much
of a factor." freshman Justin Volmert
said. "We are definitely at the height
of our physical condition, and we're
in as good of shape as any other team
out there. We'll he there a lew days
early, so we'll he acclimated when it
comes time to play."
Nationals is divided into tour
pools with four teams each, with a
round-robin to begin the tourna
ment. After pool play, it becomes a
single elimination tournament with a
round of 16. .
Stanford's pool includes N(' State,
a challenge that does not have the
Cardinal worried. Feam members
say the Wolfpaek has been known to
fold mentally, and with an aggressive
offense, the Cardinal hopes to take
them out of the game earl\.
As for taking care of the other
top teams. Stanford's game-plan is
simple but effective. All the top six
or seven teams in the country have
only one or two standout players,
with the rest of the team made of
strong, but not especially talented,
players. Stanford is different be

cause of its depth in all positions and
players. II the Cardinal is able to
take away the other two teams' big
guns, the other players will, hopeful
ly. fall like flies.
"The depth of our team has always
been a huge advantage," Atesmen
said. "If our rookies can stop up and
play well, which they have been, our
chances dramatically increase."
Another advantage for the Cardi
nal are the new "Experimental
Rules" that will be used for the first
time at nationals. I lie biggest change
under these guidelines calls for there
to be observers whose job is to make
a ruling whenever players disagree
oxer a call. I listorically. I Itimate has
been a self-officiated game. I he new
rules also call for time limits to speed
up the games.
"The experimental rules will defi
nitely help our team." sophomore
Mike Whitaker said. "We have been
training 5-6 days per week since re
gional, and the fast pace of play will
be to our advantage. Also, in games
with observers in the past, the major
ity of disputed calls have gone our
way since we call fewer fouls than any
other team."

Very, very hungry.
