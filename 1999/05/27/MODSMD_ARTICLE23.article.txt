Two >! i he three men's tennis
players were eliminated from the in
dividual singles championships in
Athens. Ga., yesterday, as senior
leader Ryan Wolters was the only
one to advance with his 3-6, 7-6. 6-4
victory over Minnesota's Tom Cha
coine.
Junior Geoff Abrams fell to
North Carolina State's Robert Ba
cone by a score of 6-2,7-5, and fresh
man K.J. Hippensteel was ousted by
the tournament's No. 2 seed, Flori
da's Jeff Morrison. 6-4,7-5.
All three Cardinal players will re
main in Athens for the doubles
championships, which begin today.
Abrams will team up with sopho
more Alex Kim to play Nenad
1 aromen and Gareth Williams of
Tulsa. Wolters and Hippensteel will
go up against Jeff Laski and Gavin
Santog of Illinois. Both opponents
play No. 1 for their respective schools
and are expected to provide a diffi
cult challenge for the Cardinal teams.
Stanford head coach felt that all
three Cardinal players picked up
their level of play as their matches
wore on. He was especially pleased
with Hippensteel's effort.
"I thought K.J. put in a hell of an
effort today," Gould said. "Williams
is one of the best players in the na
tion. and K.J. was in every point.

every game and refused to let up.
That showed me something about his
ability and character."
Although he knows he played
well. Hippensteel is still disappoint
ed.
"No matter how you play, you still
always want to come away with a
win." he said. "1 can't fault my per
formance, though. 1 just went up
against a guy who outplayed me on
the big points."
It was just the opposite in
Wolters' match. Wolters battled and
pulled out the key points in his match.
Wolters got off to a very slow start in
the first set before hanging tough and
pulling out the second in a tie-break
er.
The tie-breaker gave Wolters
confidence heading into the third set
in which he played much more ag
gressively. while Chacoine was a bit
timid.
"Ryan showed why he is so tough
today," Gould said. "He came out a
little sluggish but never gave up and
won even on a day where his game
wasn't clicking. That is the sign of a
good player — to win on off days."
Wolters was not thrilled with the
way he acheived his win. but realizes
he has a chance to pick up his level of
play.
"I know I can't afford to play the
way I did today and expect to come

away with another win," Wolters
said. "I am just glad to have advanced
and I feel confident I'll play better in
the later rounds."
Like Wolters, Abrams too came
out very slow and lethargic but
picked up his play in the second set.
Unfortunately, Abrams' effort did
not have Wolters' outcome: he lost
the second set 7-5.
"I can't be happy with my perfor
mance." Abrams said. "Beginning
with the team match in Saturday, it
was a tough tournament for me. At
least I can take away the fact that 1
fought hard and improved as today's
match went on."
Perhaps all three players were af
fected by their devastating team loss
to Baylor last Saturday. Gould said a
blow like that is hard to overcome.
"Every match is tough in the
N( A As," he said. "The draw is filled
with talented players, and if you are
off for just one set it can cost you."
The Cardinal's doubles teams
prepares to face their own chal
lenges. The Illinois and Tulsa dou
bles teams are both pairs that have
shown potential to beat tough oppo
nents all season long, according to
Gould.
"K.J. and 1 feel up to the chal
lenge," Wolters said. "We feel that so
far the tournament hasn't really gone
our way. and we hope to make up lor
that in the doubles."
Kim did not qualify for the singles
side of the draw and now that
Abrams has been eliminated, they
both can concentrate fully on dou
bles.
"After the team lost on Saturday,
I have had nothing to think about but
doubles with (ieoff," Kim said. "We
are both looking to put in everything
we have, so that when we leave we
have no regrets."
