BASEBALL
■ FridayrNo. 6 Stanford (43-13) vs.
Loyola Marymount (33-26), 7 p.m..
Sunken Diamond.

Starting Friday, 64 teams will
play as many as 112 games at 16
sites in three days — and that's just
in the first round of college base
ball's new playoff format. Some of
the participants have already de
nounced this break-neck format as
insane and strenuous.
But for all the complaints from
some baseball coaches, many are
also pleased to see the field ex
panded to include more teams, in
cluding five first-timers. An ex

panded field did not help Arizona
State, however, as last year's na
tional runner-up was left on the
sideline to watch teams like
UCLA, which was only one game
over .500, take part in this May
madness.
Nevertheless, 28 states, 30 con
ferences and one Title IX casualty
are represented (more on them
later). The Big 12 Conference and
the Southeastern Conference will
each bring six teams to the field
while the Atlantic Coast Confer
ence will he represented by five
squads. Only three other teams will
join the third-ranked Cardinal out
of the Pacific 10 Conference.
From this three-day blur of
strikeouts, hard slides, home runs
and turned double plays, only lb
teams will emerge to play for the
right to participate in the College
World Series in Omaha. Neb. As an

added bonus for surviving the first
weekend, the teams will only have
to play a best-of-three series to de
cide the final eight teams.

So many games, so little time —
the perfect recipe lor some surpris-

es around the country. That said,
here are 14 teams outside of Stan
ford's regional — which will be pre
viewed in tomorrow's Daily — to
look out for as this compressed
drama unfolds.
Miami (41-13): The fourth
ranked Hurricanes return to the
postseason for the 27th consecutive
year. Aside from being the nation's
No. 1 seed, Miami may also have
the best all-around player in col
lege baseball in junior shortstop
Bobby Hill. A leadoff hitter, he is
batting .3<S<S with nine homers, 47
stolen bases and 67 runs scored.
Florida State (48-12): So much
for the new specifications on alu
minum bats. Junior third baseman
Marshall McDougall had a day that
would make most players' careers
when he exploded for six home
runs and 16 RBls in a 26-2 victory
over Maryland May 9. Yes. that is

an NCAA record. As for the team,
it is making its 22nd consecutive
postseason appearance, second
longest behind Miami.
Cal-State Fullerton (44-11): The
Titans are a team of streaks. The
Big West conference champions
have put together winning runs of
nine, 10 and 17 games. However,
the few losses the tournament's No.
3 seed has suffered this year have
also come bundled together. In
fact, Fullerton has lost two of its last
three, and three of its last seven
games.
Alabama (46-14): The Crimson
112 ide is riding a wave of success into
the postseason, having won 10
straight games to close the season,
including four in a row to win the
SEC tournament. That powerful
season-ending push moved ninth
ranked 'Rama to the No. 5 seed in
the NCAA tournament.
Texas A&IV1 (46-14): Th e two
time defending Big 12 champions
have one of the best pitchers in the
conference in junior Casey Pos
sum. The left-hander has not over
whelmed anyone with his speed,
but his breaking pitches were good
enough to put together a 10-5
record and strike out a team-high
139 batters.
Rice (52-11): The Owls, ranked
No. I by Baseball America, will be
looking for a little redemption after
being given only the eighth seed in
the tournament. However, Rice's
dominant pitching staff could take
the ()wls far. The team allows a lit
tle more than three runs a game
and features three dominant
starters, including left-hander
Mario Ramos. The junior is 12-1
with 129 strikeouts and a 2.24
ERA.
Wichita State (57-12): The sev
enth-ranked Shockers are hosting
arguably the most loaded portion
of the bracket. They have No. 25
Oklahoma State and surging
UCLA coming to Wichita, Kan.
That is the least of their troubles as
the program was shrouded in con
troversy last month when junior
pitcher Ben Christensen viciously
beaned an opposing batter while he
was waiting in the on-deck circle.
Christensen, the team's best pitch
er with a career 21-1 mark, was sus
pended for the rest of the season,
postseason included.

Cougars lost the Conference USA

through a season in which they only
mustered a 16-13 record against

I.ousiana State (37-20-1): No

on every sorry college team in the
