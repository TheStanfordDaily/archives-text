# IMs turn to blood and gore

### Jeff Cooper Editorial staff 
MAY 29. 2032 — The Intra- )
mural Office today revealed plans '
for a new scries of IM events that i
they hope may relieve some of the i
problems the latest string of intra- ■
mural bloodshed have provoked. •
The new event — intramural ulti- 1
mate gladiatorial wrestling — will
be held in all three intramural sea- ;
sons and will consist of five-person !
teams fighting unarmed and to the
death while attempting to avoid a
variety of deadly pitfalls, poisoned j
traps and wild animals chosen in ;
advance bv student referees.

IM officials expressed opti
mism that the new event would
provide audiences and spectators
with the level of excitement and
bloodshed to which they've grown
accustomed in intramural con
tests.
"We'd been kicking around the
idea of gladiatorial wrestling for a
while, and we just felt its time had
come." said IM commissioner
Christina Blaudschun. "You
know, we figured the players were
going to beat the bejee/us out of
each other anyways, so why not
just admit what's going on?"
The new event narrowly beat
out a number of other possible op
tions raised at the latest league
meeting, including live-weapon
paintball and full-contact billiards,
in which players would be allowed
to wield cues and balls as weapons
in order to distract their oppo
nents.
Early student response to the
announcement has been extraor
dinarily positive.
"Dude, this'll give me the
chance to (expletive) beat the liv

ing [expletive] out of those [exple
tive] [expletive| Sigma ( his after
that [expletive] they pulled in the
soccer championships," said senior
class president Peter Farrell. "You
tell those [expletive] [expletive] I'm
coming for them."
Intramural participation has
risen to unprecedented levels in the
last 10 years, since the IM office
began to allow participants to use
any means available to defend
themselves against perceived fouls
and injustices. The "fend-lor-your
self" policy has directly resulted in
nearly a do/en deaths and hundreds
of serious injuries in players and
spectators alike, but the pure love
of sport seems to keep students
coming back for more.
"Everybody loves the spirit ol
competjtion." Blaudschun said,
"and Stanford students are espe
cially competitive."
The new rules have resulted in a
number of dorms fielding teams
with innovative strategies; last
year's coed football championship
was taken by an Arroyo squad com
prised entirely of professional kick
boxers.
University President Ehud
Barak, an occasional IM basketball
participant himself, had little com
ment on the announcement.
"They're doing what now'. 1 "
Barak said. "1 don't even care any
more. Those IM fields are worse
than the West Bank.
"But if I see that [expletive[ who
fouled me last week. I'm going to
slit his [expletive] throat." he
added.
One area of the new event that is
attracting a lot of attention around
campus is the requirement that all
matches will be fought in the an
cient Greek style — in the nude.

The IM office is hoping that the
all-nude policy will help avoid prob
lems such as the Graduate School
of Business' five-year domination
of the Division 1 intramural football
league, a string of championships
made possible largely by the Busi
ness School's policy of equipping all
of its intramural athletes with ar
mored robotic exoskeletons.
"There's really only so much an
average freshman dorm can accom
plish against two-ton steel-plated
robots," said junior Sean McAdam,
an RAin Branner. "We're hoping
that next year, with only unassisted
bodies competing, the playing field
will be leveled a bit.
McAdam added that Branner
would be beginning a mandatory
program ol intensive anabolic
steroid doping and raw meat for its
residents during orientation next
year.
Business School IM coordinator
Irwin Zernike said. "Hey. i! those
pansies don't want to commit the
resources necessary to achieve the
highest goals in their lives, what the
hell are they doing here?
"We're all about seeing what we
want and taking it. ll' that means
augmenting ourselves with power
ful motors or sacrificing the occa
sional first-year student lo get that
extra yard, we're going to go that
far." he said.
The IM office also hopes that the
new event will help cut back on the
staggering turnover rate among its
student referees. Since most current
event rules allow players to sum
marily execute referees who call
more than one foul a game, finding
new refs has been difficult oi late.
"We've had to resort to just
uoing into Ireshman dorms with
tranquilizer rifles and just bringing
;i whole bunch of warm bodies out
here on occasion." said IM Vice
Commissioner Dirk Lope/. "When
they wake up out on the IM lields

with a big "Referee" t-shirt, they
tend to try and bolt for the hills, so
that's why we chain 'em down.
"They get to keep the I shirt il
they make it. though," Lope/ said,
chuckling.
Sophomore Johnson Thurston,
one of only two student referees to
survive the full intramural season
this year, was impressed by the new
plans.
"In the new event, the refs are
stationed in steel cages nearby the
lields. so they have a good field of
vision. Please help me flee this liv
ing hell." I hurston said.
Blaudschun and Lope/ both
agreed that they expected to see lit
tle or no opposition to the introduc
tion of the new event. 1 he morning
of the announcement, a desultory
band of half a do/en protesters
stood listlessly around the IM Of
fices holding signs that read "For
The Love Of God. Will You People
Look At Yourselves?"' and "Why
Do I Even Bother Willi 1 his'.'
"Really, when it conies right
down to it." Blaudschun said, "peo
ple want the rush that comes with
taking a meaningless part of their
existence and lighting for it like
they were storming San Juan Hill.
Some are going to do it with boat
races, some are going to do it run
ning drugs, some are going to do il
with Star Wars trivia."
"We're just offering another op
portunity for students to express
that competitive lire that they'll
need to survive in the real world,
while giving our audiences the thrill
of watching insolent freshman be
torn apart by live wolves." she said.
"What more can you ask lor?"'

Jeff thanks the participants in last
Friday's IM soccer brawl for their in
spiring blood/list, lie plans to sleep
out for liis prime gladiatorial
wrestling slot.

plish against two-ton steel-plated
robots," said junior Sean McAdam,
an RAin Branner. "We're hoping
that next year, with only unassisted
bodies competing, the playing field
will be leveled a bit.
McAdam added that Branner
would be beginning a mandatory
program ol intensive anabolic
steroid doping and raw meat for its
residents during orientation next
year.
Business School IM coordinator
Irwin Zernike said. "Hey. i! those
pansies don't want to commit the
resources necessary to achieve the
highest goals in their lives, what the
hell are they doing here?
"We're all about seeing what we
want and taking it. ll' that means
augmenting ourselves with power
ful motors or sacrificing the occa
sional first-year student lo get that
extra yard, we're going to go that
far." he said.
The IM office also hopes that the
new event will help cut back on the
staggering turnover rate among its
student referees. Since most current
event rules allow players to sum
marily execute referees who call
more than one foul a game, finding
new refs has been difficult oi late.
"We've had to resort to just
uoing into Ireshman dorms with
tranquilizer rifles and just bringing
;i whole bunch of warm bodies out
here on occasion." said IM Vice
Commissioner Dirk Lope/. "When
they wake up out on the IM lields

with a big "Referee" t-shirt, they
tend to try and bolt for the hills, so
that's why we chain 'em down.
"They get to keep the I shirt il
they make it. though," Lope/ said,
chuckling.
Sophomore Johnson Thurston,
one of only two student referees to
survive the full intramural season
this year, was impressed by the new
plans.
"In the new event, the refs are
stationed in steel cages nearby the
lields. so they have a good field of
vision. Please help me flee this liv
ing hell." I hurston said.
Blaudschun and Lope/ both
agreed that they expected to see lit
tle or no opposition to the introduc
tion of the new event. 1 he morning
of the announcement, a desultory
band of half a do/en protesters
stood listlessly around the IM Of
fices holding signs that read "For
The Love Of God. Will You People
Look At Yourselves?"' and "Why
Do I Even Bother Willi 1 his'.'
"Really, when it conies right
down to it." Blaudschun said, "peo
ple want the rush that comes with
taking a meaningless part of their
existence and lighting for it like
they were storming San Juan Hill.
Some are going to do it with boat
races, some are going to do it run
ning drugs, some are going to do il
with Star Wars trivia."
"We're just offering another op
portunity for students to express
that competitive lire that they'll
need to survive in the real world,
while giving our audiences the thrill
of watching insolent freshman be
torn apart by live wolves." she said.
"What more can you ask lor?"'
