# Survey gauges college values
## Students become more liberal after years in college 
### Laura Blythe 
How do you feel your experience
at Stanford has shaped you as a per
son? Do you see yourself as more lib
eral or conservative? Have your
views on welfare, diversity or religion
shifted?
Two magazines. The National Re
view and the Educational Reviewer,
set out to find answers to these ques
tions. The National Review gave an
extensive questionnaire covering po
litical, cultural and religious topics to
students from 12 colleges in both
1995 and 1998 to see how student
views have changed.
While surveyed students said after
four years of college they had be
come more liberal, attitudes varied
widely on all topics.
The 12 colleges surveyed by the
Review were Liberty University in
Virginia, the Citadel, Marquette Uni
versity in Wisconsin, Indiana Univer
sity, UCLA, UC-Irvine, the Univer
sity of Wisconsin, Dartmouth Col
lege, Yale University, Brown Univer
sity, the University of Michigan and
Stanford.
The Review's aim for this project
was to compare and contrast atti
tudes a group of students held when
entering college with the views they
held nearing graduation.
Stanford political trends
Students involved in Stanford in
Government have varied views on
the politics of students here.
Dave Robinson is a doctoral stu
dent and former ASSU senator who
did his undergraduate degree at
Dartmouth. "There is not much
turnover. People are set in their
ways," he said. "The liberals that I
know are liberal. The conservatives

that I know are conservative."
Robinson said that because the
Silicon Valley isn't the most stimulat
ing place for liberals as other places
may be, he "would expect to see a
trend toward the conservative."
Sophomore Daniel Donovan and
junior Nikki Love, Stanford in Gov
ernment campus awareness direc
tors, said it has become harder to en
gage people in political issues.
Donovan said, "It seems like peo
ple have backed off of politics in gen
eral."
Religious views
Nationally, student attendance at
religious services decreased by 11
percent. However, more than 60 per
cent of seniors maintained the reli
gious affiliations with which they en
tered college.
According to Rabbi Patricia Kar
lin-Neumann, associate dean for Re
ligious Life, Stanford students are
more willing to engage in religious
discussions in informal settings, but
attendance at formal religious ser
vices has not necessarily increased.
"There's more willingness to pro
vide a forum for conversation about
religion in the dorms," she said.
"There's more inclination for people
tosharean understanding of religious
traditions with others."
Karlin-Neumann said there is a
steady stream of people who have
come to grief and bereavement pro
grams run by the Residence Deans,
Stanford's Counseling and Psycho
logical Services and the Deans for
Religious Life.
Community rights
The Review found that student
support for the ability of homosexual
couples to adopt children also in
creased, growing from nine schools in
1995 to 10 in 1998.
Students at 10 schools with a ma
jority of higher than 60 percent also
increased their support of the right of
the gay community to formal unions.

Junior Steven Aronowitz is the
former LGBCC speakers bureau co
ordinator. He said he hasn't noticed
any significant changes in student at
titudes at Stanford. However, he has
seen positive changes within Univer
sity administration, which may reflect
student support.
"The LGBCC was finally given a
full-time director. To me, that says
the IJ niversity is finally seeing and ac
knowledging the needs of our com
munity," he said.
Support for government spending
Across the country, students sup
ported increases in spending for gov
ernment programs.
Students want the government to
increase its subsidy of pensions,
health insurance and college-tuition
assistance.
Students at 11 colleges increased
their support of compulsory federal
Social Security programs.
Support for the privatization of
Social Security programs remained
divided — at Liberty, the Citadel.
Wisconsin and Marquette, support
grew: while at Dartmouth, Yale and
Brown, it decreased.
There was a slight rise in support
for increased government interven
tion in investment policies and the
stock market.
Favor for government-sponsored
health insurance also grew in a ma
jority of the schools.
More conservative views
In contrast to the push for spend
ing on some issues, many students na
tionally advocated cuts to programs
such as welfare. Students recom
mended substituting jobs, govern
ment- or private-sponsored, in place
of the benefits.
Policies supporting strategic de
fense research and development
have become more popular. Howev
er at several schools, including Indi
ana, Stanford and Yale, opinions
were mixed.
