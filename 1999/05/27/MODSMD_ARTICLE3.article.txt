# Union talks reach terms
## Workers will see contract today 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
After three weeks of negotiations
and student pressure, union repre
sentatives and Hon Appetit manage
ment came to an agreement yester
day morning. Employees will vote
on the contract today, which, if
passed, would last for three years.

According to general manager
Matthew Almedia, Bon Appetit's
proposed contract will grant workers
a yearly fixed wage increase, com
pounded 7 percent over three years,
instead of one general wage increase
after a certain amount of time and
then onlv merit based raises.
The agreement includes key eco
nomic terms that affect the food sei
vice provider's approximately fi() em
ployees as well as some language
changes in the contract that affect the
relationship between Service Em
ployees International Union and
Bon Appetit.
"[The agreement] wasn't some
thing that was easily done, said
Gabriel Hernandez, work site orga
nizer and director of SEIU Local
715.
Mindful of the previous contract s
expiration date next Monday, he
characterized negotiations as "hard
and fast" without "doing a lot of pos
turing."
"To negotiate a settlement in 32
hours is an achievement." Almedia
said.
Changing the term from "sick
days" lo "personal days" allows em
ployees to use the days for reasons
other than illness.
This is important because many
employees wanted to use the time to
take care of sick children.
"From our perspective, sick days
to personal days was quite a signifi
cant change. It's ;i brand new concept
for the company," Almedia said.
"We worked really hard to come up
with that. It's harder for us because
we have to go through the president

and vice-president."
" There were great concessions on
both sides. We reached a very fair
agreement," Almedia added. "We
wanted to make sure people were
getting enough money and good
enough benefits to sustain their
lifestyles."
The agreement also provides in
creased wages for new employees,
a premium paid at night and an
added holiday, Martin Luther King
Jr. Day.
"The union had an idea of where
they wanted the economic package
to be and the company had a limit of
where the economic package could
go. The company ended up giving
more than we wanted to but that's
OK," Almedia said.
"When you're on campus with
people who are pretty affluent and
talk about workers with almost
poverty-level wages, it has an im
pact," Hernandez said.
Lindsay lmai, a member of the
Student Labor Action Coaltion,
helped coordinate the student activi
ty, from a "galvanizing event" on
Cincode Mayo to fliers and petitions.
"In the past, the workers tried to
negotiate their contract and didn't
look for community support," she
said.
Hernandez commended the help
from SLAC and MEChA. "They
played a significant role. On behalf of
the workers, I know they appreciated
it."
