After three weeks of negotiations
and student pressure, union repre
sentatives and Hon Appetit manage
ment came to an agreement yester
day morning. Employees will vote
on the contract today, which, if
passed, would last for three years.

According to general manager
Matthew Almedia, Bon Appetit's
proposed contract will grant workers
a yearly fixed wage increase, com
pounded 7 percent over three years,
instead of one general wage increase
after a certain amount of time and
then onlv merit based raises.
