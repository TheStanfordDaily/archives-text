# 'NOTHING' BETTER THAN SEX
## PERFORMANCES 'Much Ado About Nothing' at Stanford 
### 
hundred years after it was first performed, "Much Ado About
L J/f Nothing" is coming to Stanford. An enthusiastic all-student cast is per
ejx forming Shakespeare's comedy this weekend, promising two days of
laughter under the sun.
" 'Much Ado' has always been my favorite Shakespearean comedy," said senior
Elizabeth Horn. "And Beatrice has always been a dream role for me." Horn, who
played the lead in "Threepenny Opera" last quarter, is starring as Beatrice oppo
site junior Cody Harris as Benedick.
"It's awesome," said senior Daniel Donovan.
The cast brings their experience and enthusiasm to Shakespeare's witty
romance. Harris and Horn have worked together in the Ram's Head production
of "Fool's Dream," while Harris played the lead in last fall's Gaieties. Senior Robb
Malin and junior Jyoti Bollmann are the lovers Claudio and Hero, while senior
Kevin Lemons plays Don Pedro and junior Jon Stockdale is the governor Leonato.
George Kaplan plays the evil bastard Don John.
Sophomores Sarah Meyer and MacKenzie Geidt got the idea to direct their own
independent production in a Shakespeare seminar last fall, taught by Emeritus
English Professor Ron Rebholz. Thanks to a generous private donor, Meyer and
Geidt secured the funding and assembled a talented cast. The directors chose an
outdoor stage to capture the play's Tuscan ambience — the Vidalakis Courtyard
at the Schwab Center.
Since the Drama Department and Ram's Head can only stage several shows a
year, Geidt believes that "students should take the initiative to create visions of
their own."
The cast and crew fell in love with "Much Ado About Nothing," one of
Shakespeare's last comedies and a recent Kenneth Branagh film. "It's so funny!
And it's so endearing," said Meyer. "Beatrice and Benedick are just on fire!"
With physical comedy and timeless Shakespearian wit, "Much Ado About
Nothing" promises fun and laughter. It performs at 2:00 p.m., Saturday and
Sunday in the Vidalakis Courtyard at the Schwab Center on Serra Street.
Admission is $4.
