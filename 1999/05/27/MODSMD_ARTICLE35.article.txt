# JOAN CHEN & GELING YAN
## The 						Intermission interview INTERVIEW BOOKS 
### 
irst-time director Joan Chen and co-screen
writer Geling Yan chat with Intermission about
tJS their new movie "Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down
Girl," based on a true story about a girl stranded in Tibet
during China's Youth Cultural Revolution. Chen is best
known in the United States as the opium-smoking empress
in"The Last Emperor" and as Josie Packard in "Twin
Peaks."
INTERMISSION: What made you choose this pro
ject? You said in other interviews that you felt a per
sonal connection to this project, but why now? You've
had a very long film career.
JOAN CHEN: If I didn't start now, I'd never start it.
It's a career change, and any career change takes a lot of
courage to do. It takes certain remnants of youth to do
it. It takes a certain youthful vitality to change a career.

I: Is this the same youthful
vitality that led you here from
China in 1981?
JC: Yes, that was total igno
rance. It was a very vague dream,
and that was very youthful.

GELING YAN: I think also that when one is a direc
tor, you can make your own movies, the movies you
really like and believe in, you know. And you don't have
to, well, she has some movies she's not proud 0f....
I: Which ones?
JC: Quite a few. I knew going in that they were not
going to be good.
I: Like "Tai-Pan" ?
JC: "Tai-Pan," I actually didn't know going in that it
was going to be bad. It was much later on in my career,
a few years ago. And they were movies that well, I was
settling really for mediocrity. I didn't like that at all. And
I have filmmaker in me. It was like the pressure built in
for years that it eventually exploded. And of course it
has a lot to do with having seen a story that I loved,
which was Tian Yu. So I finally decided to do it. I actu
ally majored in filmmaking and not drama in college.
I: The movie is narrated by a young male admirer.
Why did you choose that point of view?
JC: It was the style of the film. It wasn't in the short

story. We talked about wanting Xiu Xiu to be remem
bered beautifully and we wanted an angle with some
body who could bring a certain warmth to it. No matter
what she becomes later, she will always be remembered
beautifully. So it's not the parents, they're not able to tell
that, story and it's not the sister. And we thought about
this young boy and her being his first love and him
never really being able to forget her, and she will love as
long as he does. From his point of view, since he's never
been there but obsessively traces every piece of news
about her as well as everything pertaining to that move
ment, that's more like me. I haven't been there. From
this point of view then, we will be able to poeticize the
film because he hasn't been there. Through his obses
sion the stars will be bigger, the night sky will be deeper
blue instead of simply black, and the grasslands will be
greener, and flowers will be brighter. Even in the worst
of all desolation, she will always be remembered beauti-

fully. That was the intention. We
had him come back as an adult,
but that didn't work out right.
That was not in the movie —
GY: No, we actually shot it, but
left it in the editing floor. We

wanted to make the comment of, I remember writing it
down, how I want the angle of Lao Jin and Xiu Xiu to
remembered. 1 copied down the name of an English
poet named Lawrence Binyon, it says here: "They shall
grow not old as we that are left grow old. Age shall not
weary them nor the years condemn. At the going down
of the sun and in the morning we will remember them."
And that's what this angle is.
I: What other angles did you want to show?
GY: I remember you said you didn't want to make
another Cultural Revolution movie. It is about the
Cultural Revolution, but she wanted to make it different
from the other Cultural Revolutions. She wants to make
a little a fairy-tale quality in this movie. So all the colors
and everything that is half-remembered and half-creat
ed by the imagination. So it looks different from the rest
of the Revolution movies.
I: You told Parade Magazine that you were filming
in Tibet without a government permit and that there
was significant danger involved. The landscape was of
course beautiful, but it didn't seem to me that it was

essential to shoot on location.
JC: It was absolutely essential. I mean, the landscape
itself is an intrinsic part of the drama. The real isolation
of it and God's gift of that piece of sky that Lao Jin
belongs to and feels completely at home in is all totally
intrinsic to the story, without which there is no story.
I: You couldn't go somewhere else?
JC: You definitely wouldn't find the same thing. 1
wanted to do it in Tibet because, you know, no one had
seen the real Tibet. All the Tibetan movies were done
somewhere else. And I needed the Tibetan people there
and the Tibetan yaks. In the United States, you don't
even have one single yak. We would have had to do
makeup jobs on the bison and put hair on the cows to
make them look like yaks. That would have been expen
sive makeup work! And for me. I wanted to make it as
loyal to the original as possible. The movie was born
there, in Tibet.
