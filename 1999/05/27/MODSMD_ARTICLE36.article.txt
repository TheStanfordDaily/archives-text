# An abiding success
## 
### E. Lynn Harris 
one are the days of best-selling author E. Lynn Harris' self-publishing.
(Harris' switch from IBM sales executive to full-time novelist and columnist
was definitely a wise decision. Since the switch, Harris has enjoyed an envi
able writing career full of impressive accolades and achievements.
In 1991, Harris self-published his first novel, "Invisible Life," which was later
picked up by Anchor Books and published as a trade paperback Since then, Harris
has had four equally successful novels published. His novels include "And This Too
Shall Pass," "If This World Were Mine," "lust As I Am" and "Abide With Me." The for
mer two were New York Times bestsellers. "If This World Were Mine" was nominat
ed for the 1997 NAACP Image Award and won the James Baldwin Award for Literary
Excellence. Harris' novel "Just As I Am" was awarded the Novel of the Year Prize by
the blackboard African-American Bestsellers, Inc. His latest novel, "Abide With Me"
(Doubleday), is a delicately written emotional and spiritual journey for its characters
as well as its readers. Readily accessible, "Abide With Me" is guaranteed to be as equal
ly successful as Harris' previous novels.
"Abide With Me" is the third and last segment of a trilogy that began with
"Invisible Life" and was continued in "Just As I Am "You don't need to read the other
two novels to understand the last one; Harris provides enough background material
to keep you abreast of how the past happenings have shaped his characters' present.
"Abide With Me" follows and details the lives of two main protagonists whose lives,

although separate, connect and intertwine in surprising ways.
When Raymond Tyler Jr. is nominated for a federal judgeship, he is forced to
reevaluate his goals and plans. Several factors turn what Raymond originally views as
a blessing into a curse. The appointment process delves into his personal "lifestyle," a
term used to describe his homosexual relationship with his life partner, Trent
Michaels. When Nicole Springer, wife to Raymond's best friend, Jared, gets her big
chance to have a starring role on Broadway, her success is threatened by her over
trusting nature and naiVe friendliness, which jeopardizes her marriage as well as her
life. Both Raymond and Nicole have their faith and beliefs tested as they struggle to
define their lives, eventually finding themselves in ways they never thought they
would.
Although the main cast of "Abide With Me" is black, their struggles and successes
are universal. Through Raymond and Nicole, Harris illuminates the fragility of
human nature. Through them, he questions family, love, sexual orientation, friend
ship and dreams. Harris writes with a mastered skillfulness and sensitivity that makes
his characters accessible to many readers and makes their struggles believable. No
wonder he has been dubbed the most successful black male novelist in publishing
history.
