A dmittedly, Stanford is not a hotbed of hip hop music and culture.
The average Stanford student is doubtlessly more familiar with
Mozart than Mos Def. But this Saturday Stanford becomes the
envy of the Bay Area hip hop community — if but for a night — as
Okada House presents the fourth annual "Okada Hype," a tribute to the
unifying power of music and a showcase of blossoming hip hop talent.
The Mission
For the past several years, Okada Stanford's Asian-American theme
house, in conjunction with HYPE! Management, has put on "Da Hype"
(as it is commonly known) in celebration of Asian/Islander Pacific
Heritage Month. But the message stemming from "Da Hype" is more
far reaching. Amp Live, producer of the hip hop trio Zion 1, embodies
the attitude surrounding "Da Hype": "We're about positivity and peace.
When we perform, we try to promote that. When you come to see a
show, everyone is together... .It should be peaceful." This sentiment was
echoed by many of the artists performing Saturday. "How many people
listen to music?" asked turntablist Vinroc. "All different types of people.
It's the universal language." Thus the theme of "Da Hype": "Unity
Through Music — The Science of the Blend."
HYPE! Management founder Lan Phan recalls that the origin of "Da
Hype" dates back to when she first arrived at Stanford. "My experience
as an Asian American was not in-line with the traditional roles of Asian
Americans at Stanford," says Phan. Phan sought a way to overcome the
prevailing impressions at Stanford of not only Asians, but of all groups.
"The events that I found to be the most diverse were hip hop events,"
says Phan. "Through music we can bring people of different color, creed
and sexual orientation together." Just as the deejays - the forefathers of
hip hop — in the South Bronx in the early '70s were able to unite oth
erwise divided ethnic communities through the power of music, "Da
Hype" taps into the power of hip-hop music and culture to do the same
here at Stanford.
"Da Hype" also aims to dispel the narrowly contrived notion that hip
hop is strictly synonymous with the art of emceeing. Just as most bands
are unfairly defined through their lead singers' images by the popular
press, hip hop is commonly viewed as strictly a rhyming art, dominat
ed by emcees. This is a misinformed stereotype, and "Da Hype" is all
about breaking down such generalizations. "Da Hype" will feature a
wealth of talent from the four fundamental components of hip hop:
deejaying or cutting and scratching, emceeing or rhyming, breakdanc
ing (b boys and b girls) and graffiti art. Each will be placed on center
stage and recognized for its respective contribution to hip-hop culture
and music in general.
The Artists
The discipline of deejaying has only recently begun to gain main
stream acceptance as a legitimate art form. However "Da Hype" has put
these artists in the spotlight long before they were hailed as "musical
geniuses" by major music publications. This year is no exception. The
featured deejays include Shortkut and Apollo of Invisbl Skratch Picklz,

Vinroc of Fifth Platoon and Cue of Space Travelers, three of the world's
preeminent deejay battling groups. Collectively these four deejays con
stitute the Triple Threat DJs, a name that represents their skills as battle
deejays, club deejays and turntablists. Unlike the emcee, whose charis
ma is manifested through his stage presence, the turntablist creates a
collage of sound by incorporating cuts from already existing records.
While deejaying does not seem obviously conducive to crowd partici
pation, Vinroc is quick to say that many deejays can communicate with
the crowd on an equal level as emcees.
Eclipse 427, deejay for Planet Asia, appreciates the opportunity for
deejays to take center stage: "It's very helpful. The deejay is the back
bone of hip hop. It's the beginning of the hip hop movement... .The
emcee is the centerpiece of the whole thing, but it's really a 50-50 deal."
In his view, the newfound recognition that turntablists have received
has caused some to lose sight of hip hop as a collective effort. "On both
ends, there are a lot of egotistical things. A lot of turntablists don't think
they're part of hip hop," says Eclipse 427. "They need to grow the fuck
up." Vinroc disagrees. "[Turntablism] is its own genre," he comments.
"Some deejays are staying traditional, but some doesn't even sound like
hip hop." But like Eclipse 427, he is grateful for the opportunities avail
able to deejays: "It's cool. It's an interesting thing going on where we
were forgotten for a while but now we're being recognized again."
Another feature of "Da Hype" that has been conspicuously absent
from popular hip hop in recent years is the concept of the hip-hop
group — a completely self-produced unit consisting of emcee(s) and a
deejay working in tandem. This is the stuff of which hip hop legends are
made: Eric B. and Rakim, Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth, Gang Starr,
Public Enemy. The list goes on. And "Da Hype" spotlights plenty of
groups that carry on this tradition. Perhaps the most unique of these is
the Anomolies, a hip-hop crew 15 women strong. When it comes to hip
hop, the Anomolies cover all of the bases: deejays, emcees, b girls.and
