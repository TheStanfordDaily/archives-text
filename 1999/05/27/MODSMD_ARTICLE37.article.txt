A dmittedly, Stanford is not a hotbed of hip hop music and culture.
The average Stanford student is doubtlessly more familiar with
Mozart than Mos Def. But this Saturday Stanford becomes the
envy of the Bay Area hip hop community — if but for a night — as
Okada House presents the fourth annual "Okada Hype," a tribute to the
unifying power of music and a showcase of blossoming hip hop talent.
The Mission
For the past several years, Okada Stanford's Asian-American theme
house, in conjunction with HYPE! Management, has put on "Da Hype"
(as it is commonly known) in celebration of Asian/Islander Pacific
Heritage Month. But the message stemming from "Da Hype" is more
far reaching. Amp Live, producer of the hip hop trio Zion 1, embodies
the attitude surrounding "Da Hype": "We're about positivity and peace.
When we perform, we try to promote that. When you come to see a
show, everyone is together... .It should be peaceful." This sentiment was
echoed by many of the artists performing Saturday. "How many people
listen to music?" asked turntablist Vinroc. "All different types of people.
It's the universal language." Thus the theme of "Da Hype": "Unity
Through Music — The Science of the Blend."
HYPE! Management founder Lan Phan recalls that the origin of "Da
Hype" dates back to when she first arrived at Stanford. "My experience
as an Asian American was not in-line with the traditional roles of Asian
Americans at Stanford," says Phan. Phan sought a way to overcome the
prevailing impressions at Stanford of not only Asians, but of all groups.
"The events that I found to be the most diverse were hip hop events,"
says Phan. "Through music we can bring people of different color, creed
and sexual orientation together." Just as the deejays - the forefathers of
hip hop — in the South Bronx in the early '70s were able to unite oth
erwise divided ethnic communities through the power of music, "Da
Hype" taps into the power of hip-hop music and culture to do the same
here at Stanford.
"Da Hype" also aims to dispel the narrowly contrived notion that hip
hop is strictly synonymous with the art of emceeing. Just as most bands
are unfairly defined through their lead singers' images by the popular
press, hip hop is commonly viewed as strictly a rhyming art, dominat
ed by emcees. This is a misinformed stereotype, and "Da Hype" is all
about breaking down such generalizations. "Da Hype" will feature a
wealth of talent from the four fundamental components of hip hop:
deejaying or cutting and scratching, emceeing or rhyming, breakdanc
ing (b boys and b girls) and graffiti art. Each will be placed on center
stage and recognized for its respective contribution to hip-hop culture
and music in general.
The Artists
The discipline of deejaying has only recently begun to gain main
stream acceptance as a legitimate art form. However "Da Hype" has put
these artists in the spotlight long before they were hailed as "musical
geniuses" by major music publications. This year is no exception. The
featured deejays include Shortkut and Apollo of Invisbl Skratch Picklz,

Vinroc of Fifth Platoon and Cue of Space Travelers, three of the world's
preeminent deejay battling groups. Collectively these four deejays con
stitute the Triple Threat DJs, a name that represents their skills as battle
deejays, club deejays and turntablists. Unlike the emcee, whose charis
ma is manifested through his stage presence, the turntablist creates a
collage of sound by incorporating cuts from already existing records.
While deejaying does not seem obviously conducive to crowd partici
pation, Vinroc is quick to say that many deejays can communicate with
the crowd on an equal level as emcees.
Eclipse 427, deejay for Planet Asia, appreciates the opportunity for
deejays to take center stage: "It's very helpful. The deejay is the back
bone of hip hop. It's the beginning of the hip hop movement... .The
emcee is the centerpiece of the whole thing, but it's really a 50-50 deal."
In his view, the newfound recognition that turntablists have received
has caused some to lose sight of hip hop as a collective effort. "On both
ends, there are a lot of egotistical things. A lot of turntablists don't think
they're part of hip hop," says Eclipse 427. "They need to grow the fuck
up." Vinroc disagrees. "[Turntablism] is its own genre," he comments.
"Some deejays are staying traditional, but some doesn't even sound like
hip hop." But like Eclipse 427, he is grateful for the opportunities avail
able to deejays: "It's cool. It's an interesting thing going on where we
were forgotten for a while but now we're being recognized again."
Another feature of "Da Hype" that has been conspicuously absent
from popular hip hop in recent years is the concept of the hip-hop
group — a completely self-produced unit consisting of emcee(s) and a
deejay working in tandem. This is the stuff of which hip hop legends are
made: Eric B. and Rakim, Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth, Gang Starr,
Public Enemy. The list goes on. And "Da Hype" spotlights plenty of
groups that carry on this tradition. Perhaps the most unique of these is
the Anomolies, a hip-hop crew 15 women strong. When it comes to hip
hop, the Anomolies cover all of the bases: deejays, emcees, b girls.and

graffiti artists. The central

core of the group con-

sists of three emcees,
Pri the Honey Dark,

Helixx C. Armageddon

and Phe-nomenon, and
two deejays, Kuttin
Kandi and D'Jeannie of
the Lamp. In a time

when several high
profile female

hip hop artists
are better
I known for

their sexual
prowess than
musical
i ability, the

Anomolies
aim to
showcase
their
exception
al skills
and talent
while
simultane-

ously demonstrating knowledge, integrity and
dignity. Their music is about much more than
pure aesthetic value. According to the Anomolies,
they aim to expose the lies and dishonesty within
the hip hop community and reveal truth and pos
itivity through their love of the hip hop art.
Amp Live describes his group, Zion I, as "just
full of energy... original b-boy, hip hop type."
Along with producer Amp Live, DJ K-Genius and
emcee Zion form the trio, Zion I. While Zion 1 is
primarily a hip-hop group, its members have
many influences, as exhibited by its drum 'n' bass
inspired single, "Inner Light." "We're just open to
do whatever," says Amp Live. "A lot of people set
themselves in a way of doing things." By listening
to and trying different forms of music, Amp Live
believes the members of Zion I are allowing
themselves to improve as artists. Like the
Anomolies, Zion I definitely represents for a more
spiritual side — the group strives to bring integri
ty and positivity to its audience, but never com
promising its raw hip-hop style.
No hip-hop show is complete without an artist
whose ideas and vision can only be described as

other-worldly. In the

past, groups such as
Kool Keith's brain
child, Dr. Octagon,
have taken thought
and rhymes into a
whole different
realm. This role will
be more than ade
quately filled by the
Kemetic Suns on
Saturday night.
Kemetic Suns is an
amorphous collec
tive of poets, singers,
dancers and all types
of artists. The
group's name arises
from the Greek
name for Egypt, the
original city, and the
sun, giver of all life.
Kemetic Suns be-

lieves that teachings are passed down generation
to generation and the group uses its opportunities
on stage to continue this rite.
In the emcee department, the main attraction
has to be Fresno-based emcee Planet Asia. The
conception of Planet Asia's name embodies the
theme of "Da Hype." "Historians try to divide the
continents and the people of the world with labels
such as Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Egypt,"
says Asia. "All of these people were, and are, one.
The name, 'Planet Asia,' is symbolic to the body of
the original man." Planet Asia is what you might
call an emcee's emcee. He has made his name in
the classic hip-hop way: by talcing out one emcee
after another. Like many emcees, Asia shines on
wax — but his ability on the open mic sets him
apart. "His voice is on point, his delivery is on
point," says his DJ, Eclipse 427. "You can't really
break it down too much — he just has it." As far
as lyricists go, they simply do not get any better.
"Planet Asia is just ridiculous," remarks Eclipse
427. "His skill and energy and vibe... he paints a
brilliant picture of what he's going through and
what he's feeling."
Believe "Da Hype"
More than anything, "Hype" artists love what
they are doing, and they do it for the love. "I want
to be known as a guy who loves what he does and
who makes music from his heart. I don't care
about the money; as long as I'm making music
that touches people," says Vinroc. "That's what
makes me do this." They certainly aren't the high
est paid artist* around, but it is clear that the sat
isfaction derived from making music that radiates
their love and positivity and maintains their
integrity compensates more than sufficiently.
The point is that you should go to this show.
Turn off your Sarah McLachlan record for one
night and try something that is perhaps unlike
anything you have experienced before. "Da Hype"
welcomes newcomers based on the belief that
music only has the ability to make one more
understanding and better off as a person.
Listeners will immediately become engaged in the
music and the energy only to discover that soon
they have also begun to absorb the message. "The
more open you become toward music, the better
off you are, not only as an artist, but as a listener,"
stresses Amp Live. "Be ready to come out and sup
port."

the attitude surrounding "Da Hype": "We're about positivity and peace.
When we perform, we try to promote that. When you come to see a
show, everyone is together... .It should be peaceful." This sentiment was
echoed by many of the artists performing Saturday. "How many people
listen to music?" asked turntablist Vinroc. "All different types of people.
It's the universal language." Thus the theme of "Da Hype": "Unity
Through Music — The Science of the Blend."
HYPE! Management founder Lan Phan recalls that the origin of "Da
Hype" dates back to when she first arrived at Stanford. "My experience
as an Asian American was not in-line with the traditional roles of Asian
Americans at Stanford," says Phan. Phan sought a way to overcome the
prevailing impressions at Stanford of not only Asians, but of all groups.
"The events that I found to be the most diverse were hip hop events,"
says Phan. "Through music we can bring people of different color, creed
and sexual orientation together." Just as the deejays - the forefathers of
hip hop — in the South Bronx in the early '70s were able to unite oth
erwise divided ethnic communities through the power of music, "Da
Hype" taps into the power of hip-hop music and culture to do the same
here at Stanford.
"Da Hype" also aims to dispel the narrowly contrived notion that hip
hop is strictly synonymous with the art of emceeing. Just as most bands
are unfairly defined through their lead singers' images by the popular
press, hip hop is commonly viewed as strictly a rhyming art, dominat
ed by emcees. This is a misinformed stereotype, and "Da Hype" is all
about breaking down such generalizations. "Da Hype" will feature a
wealth of talent from the four fundamental components of hip hop:
deejaying or cutting and scratching, emceeing or rhyming, breakdanc
ing (b boys and b girls) and graffiti art. Each will be placed on center
stage and recognized for its respective contribution to hip-hop culture
and music in general.
The Artists
The discipline of deejaying has only recently begun to gain main
stream acceptance as a legitimate art form. However "Da Hype" has put
these artists in the spotlight long before they were hailed as "musical
geniuses" by major music publications. This year is no exception. The
featured deejays include Shortkut and Apollo of Invisbl Skratch Picklz,

Vinroc of Fifth Platoon and Cue of Space Travelers, three of the world's
preeminent deejay battling groups. Collectively these four deejays con
stitute the Triple Threat DJs, a name that represents their skills as battle
deejays, club deejays and turntablists. Unlike the emcee, whose charis
ma is manifested through his stage presence, the turntablist creates a
collage of sound by incorporating cuts from already existing records.
While deejaying does not seem obviously conducive to crowd partici
pation, Vinroc is quick to say that many deejays can communicate with
the crowd on an equal level as emcees.
Eclipse 427, deejay for Planet Asia, appreciates the opportunity for
deejays to take center stage: "It's very helpful. The deejay is the back
bone of hip hop. It's the beginning of the hip hop movement... .The
emcee is the centerpiece of the whole thing, but it's really a 50-50 deal."
In his view, the newfound recognition that turntablists have received
has caused some to lose sight of hip hop as a collective effort. "On both
ends, there are a lot of egotistical things. A lot of turntablists don't think
they're part of hip hop," says Eclipse 427. "They need to grow the fuck
up." Vinroc disagrees. "[Turntablism] is its own genre," he comments.
"Some deejays are staying traditional, but some doesn't even sound like
hip hop." But like Eclipse 427, he is grateful for the opportunities avail
able to deejays: "It's cool. It's an interesting thing going on where we
were forgotten for a while but now we're being recognized again."
Another feature of "Da Hype" that has been conspicuously absent
from popular hip hop in recent years is the concept of the hip-hop
group — a completely self-produced unit consisting of emcee(s) and a
deejay working in tandem. This is the stuff of which hip hop legends are
made: Eric B. and Rakim, Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth, Gang Starr,
Public Enemy. The list goes on. And "Da Hype" spotlights plenty of
groups that carry on this tradition. Perhaps the most unique of these is
the Anomolies, a hip-hop crew 15 women strong. When it comes to hip
hop, the Anomolies cover all of the bases: deejays, emcees, b girls.and

graffiti artists. The central

sists of three emcees,

and Phe-nomenon, and
two deejays, Kuttin
Kandi and D'Jeannie of
the Lamp. In a time

when several high
profile female

hip hop artists
are better
I known for

their sexual
prowess than
musical
i ability, the

Anomolies
aim to
showcase
their
exception
al skills
and talent
while
simultane-

ously demonstrating knowledge, integrity and
dignity. Their music is about much more than
pure aesthetic value. According to the Anomolies,
they aim to expose the lies and dishonesty within
the hip hop community and reveal truth and pos
itivity through their love of the hip hop art.
Amp Live describes his group, Zion I, as "just
full of energy... original b-boy, hip hop type."
Along with producer Amp Live, DJ K-Genius and
emcee Zion form the trio, Zion I. While Zion 1 is
primarily a hip-hop group, its members have
many influences, as exhibited by its drum 'n' bass
inspired single, "Inner Light." "We're just open to
do whatever," says Amp Live. "A lot of people set
themselves in a way of doing things." By listening
to and trying different forms of music, Amp Live
believes the members of Zion I are allowing
themselves to improve as artists. Like the
Anomolies, Zion I definitely represents for a more
spiritual side — the group strives to bring integri
ty and positivity to its audience, but never com
promising its raw hip-hop style.
No hip-hop show is complete without an artist
whose ideas and vision can only be described as

other-worldly. In the

past, groups such as
Kool Keith's brain
child, Dr. Octagon,
have taken thought
and rhymes into a
whole different
realm. This role will
be more than ade
quately filled by the
Kemetic Suns on
Saturday night.
Kemetic Suns is an
amorphous collec
tive of poets, singers,
dancers and all types
of artists. The
group's name arises
from the Greek
name for Egypt, the
original city, and the
sun, giver of all life.
Kemetic Suns be-

lieves that teachings are passed down generation
to generation and the group uses its opportunities
on stage to continue this rite.
In the emcee department, the main attraction
has to be Fresno-based emcee Planet Asia. The
conception of Planet Asia's name embodies the
theme of "Da Hype." "Historians try to divide the
continents and the people of the world with labels
such as Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Egypt,"
says Asia. "All of these people were, and are, one.
The name, 'Planet Asia,' is symbolic to the body of
the original man." Planet Asia is what you might
call an emcee's emcee. He has made his name in
the classic hip-hop way: by talcing out one emcee
after another. Like many emcees, Asia shines on
wax — but his ability on the open mic sets him
apart. "His voice is on point, his delivery is on
point," says his DJ, Eclipse 427. "You can't really
break it down too much — he just has it." As far
as lyricists go, they simply do not get any better.
"Planet Asia is just ridiculous," remarks Eclipse
427. "His skill and energy and vibe... he paints a
brilliant picture of what he's going through and
what he's feeling."
Believe "Da Hype"
More than anything, "Hype" artists love what
they are doing, and they do it for the love. "I want
to be known as a guy who loves what he does and
who makes music from his heart. I don't care
about the money; as long as I'm making music
that touches people," says Vinroc. "That's what
makes me do this." They certainly aren't the high
est paid artist* around, but it is clear that the sat
isfaction derived from making music that radiates
their love and positivity and maintains their
integrity compensates more than sufficiently.
The point is that you should go to this show.
Turn off your Sarah McLachlan record for one
night and try something that is perhaps unlike
anything you have experienced before. "Da Hype"
welcomes newcomers based on the belief that
music only has the ability to make one more
understanding and better off as a person.
Listeners will immediately become engaged in the
music and the energy only to discover that soon
they have also begun to absorb the message. "The
more open you become toward music, the better
off you are, not only as an artist, but as a listener,"
stresses Amp Live. "Be ready to come out and sup
port."

A dmittedly, Stanford is not a hotbed of hip hop music and culture.
The average Stanford student is doubtlessly more familiar with
Mozart than Mos Def. But this Saturday Stanford becomes the
envy of the Bay Area hip hop community — if but for a night — as
Okada House presents the fourth annual "Okada Hype," a tribute to the
unifying power of music and a showcase of blossoming hip hop talent.
The Mission
For the past several years, Okada Stanford's Asian-American theme
house, in conjunction with HYPE! Management, has put on "Da Hype"
(as it is commonly known) in celebration of Asian/Islander Pacific
Heritage Month. But the message stemming from "Da Hype" is more
far reaching. Amp Live, producer of the hip hop trio Zion 1, embodies
the attitude surrounding "Da Hype": "We're about positivity and peace.
