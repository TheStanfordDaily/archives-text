## THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS Robbie Williams The 						Ego Has Landed (EMD/Capitol) 
### 
certain sense of nostalgia bid
\\y me write a review on one
Robbie Williams and his "The
Ego Has Landed" release. 1 spent the sum
mer in London and was force-fed his "Take
That" boy-band-turned-latest-Messiah of
Brit-pop voice — dumping out of every
passing car or every top-40 club — on the
way to the bus stop. As 1 disengaged from
those last strains and stepped on the bus I'd
think "Free, I'm free." But no ... cruel fate
would dictate otherwise and that last song
would simply bleed into another one, blar
ing from personal or bus stereos. I was bom
barded by stories of his personal life. Yes, I
know them all — a torrid affair with one of
those queens of Brit-pop, an All-Saints girl.
I encountered his clowning visage and semi
nude physique, oscillating between some
times attractive (if you're into hair and lots
of it) and sometimes irritating (in a who-is
t his-pud-and-how-is-he-so-rich-anyway?
sort of way), at every magazine stand, on
every tube car and on the EuropeMTV that
he seems to rule.

And the result of all
of this — media
moguls be proud —
is that I know most
of his lyrics and I
even find myself
singing along to
some of them.
Maybe it is just
plain catchy, or
maybe I like the fact
that he is goofball
and is just riding
out this fame thing
for all it's worth.
He's not shy about
proclaiming his
moment in the sun
unwarranted, that
he's not in it for
"artistic integrity,"
that his having sold
more than 4 million
records is the
"biggest joke of the
decade" — this is
actually rather
amusing — those
silly Europeans.

He's pretty much a one-man show or
show boat, a cross between an Elton John on
speed and George Michael (circa his sexual
ly ambiguous early years). I've seen the
videos; on "Let Me Entertain You" he dons
full Kiss attire, sans any torso coverage —
he's seriously doing wonders for hairy men
across the globe — and hams it up for all his
Brit behind is worth. But hey, as a front
man, he harkens to those days of shameless,
heart-felt glam rock, and if one were to
apply the trickle-down theory maybe this
excessive effort in ham will feel its way
around and kick a little life into too many
apathetic rockers. I mean, they're famous,
and we deserve to be entertained for the
bucks they make.
When asked as a mere pup by his grand
mother what he wanted to be when he grew
up, dear Robbie said that he didn't know
how but at 21 he'd be internationally
famous and a millionaire. Funny, those were
my plans too. The big question concerns his
grand USA premiere — can he cut it here?
Will he enlarge his dominion of domina
tion? I'm looking at an article right now,
depicting Robbie Williams and two porn
star models drinking a cocktail off his
crotch with the quote plastered under the
three, "Will nothing stop this man?"
Evidently, god help us, nothing will. I am
even betrayed by my own integrity and am
listening to this CD again. O the harlotry of
my soul.
