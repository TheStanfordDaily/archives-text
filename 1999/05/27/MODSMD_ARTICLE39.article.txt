# Brasiliero
## Various Artists (Putumayo) 
### 
(( rasiliero" is the perfect way
to welcome the downpour
of sunshine and green that
we've seen lately. This album goes straight to
the heart and inspires a state of summer
time bliss. It is full of warm melodies, soul
ful voices and rhythm sections that can
loosen anyone's joints while making
American music seem entirely dull.
"Brasiliero" is a compilation of some of
the greatest samba and bossa nova artists in
Brazil within the last 30 years. If you liked
the music of Paul Simon's "Rhythm of the
Saints," this is a taste of it sans Simon and
with more of the delicious drum sections
and Carnival-esque choruses. Although
almost every song on "Brasiliero" is worth
listening to over and over, Rosa Passos'
"Aguas de Marco" and Clara Nunes' "Canto
Das Tres Racas" are the true musical gems of
the album.
As the insert of the album says, "Music is
more than just entertainment in Brazil. It is
the soundtrack to life, a constant ambiance
of rhythm and melody that enriches and
supports the people through good times
and bad." Many of the artists on this album
come straight from "favelas" (the slums of
Rio) or from small rural towns, and this
gives the songs a very raw and"from the
heart" feel. The translations of the lyrics are
poetic, and the topics of the songs range
from more conventional themes like
"saudade" (melancholy / nostalgia) to more
unusual things, such as a surreal dream of a
landscape (in "Take Sarava") or the fears of
the boyfriend of a widow (in "O Namorado
da viuva").
Even without understanding these lyrics,
the sound of the Portuguese language in
itself is enough to get you in the mood. The
fluid, almost lazy voices combined with a
consistently lively, hip-shaking beat creates
a sensual atmosphere that emanates heat. I
guarantee this album will make you slip into
a world devoid of problem sets and papers
and full of ocean breezes and dance-filled
nights.
