# Simply Sullivan
## Award winning teacher, renowned constitutional scholar, prolific writer, champion litigator will take over Law School's highest post 
### Ritu Bhatnagar 
Kathleen Sullivan, the next
dean of the I .aw School, may share
more in common with the average
Stanford student than one might
think. She certainly knows a great
deal about burning the midnight
oil. as her Law School colleague
and friend. Emeritus Prof. Gerald
(inilther. will attest.
"Kathleen and I were using a
particular book for sonic courses
that we were teaching." (iunther
said. "The publisher of the book
was putting pressure on the both of
us to churn out ;i teaching manual
for the book.and I still had ;i couple

of chapters of the book left to teach,
the publishers wanted the manual
written within a week, and I told
them there was no way I could do it
in that time. Kathleen didn't have
as many chapters left, and she vol
unteered."
According to (iunther. she
spent that entire week, working day
and night, to produce a 3(H)-page
teaching manual, "all in perfect
prose."
"II I tried to do that, it would
have taken me months, and she did
it in a week," (iunther said. "That
manual was so far superior to other
teaching manuals that it is used by
people teaching from other
books."

(iunther and other colleagues
are certain that Sullivan will bring
this same type of determination
and commitment to her new post.

effective Sept. 1. Sullivan, who will
be Stanford's first female academic
dean, replaces Paul Brest, who will
head the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation next year.
"She is a brilliant lawyer with
very high standards and very high as
pirations," Brest said. "She has lots
of energy, and she will be able to
bring the Law School to the next
step."
"We are on the verge of being
recognized as the best Law School.
If there's any person who can make
it better and have it be recognized,
it's Kathleen Sullivan," he said.

Interests and strengths
Sullivan was selected by Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper, who
is a constitutional scholar like Sulli
van. Recommendations were pre
sented by a committee of nine facul
ty members, a student and an alum
nus after a five-month search.
"Just as Paul Brest pushed the
Law School in new directions. Kath
leen will bring fresh perspective to
legal education, at Stanford and na
tionally," Casper told the Stanford
Report. "She is everything one
could ask for in a dean: an outstand
ing teacher and scholar, an active
lawyer and a public intellectual."
In addition to being a constitu
tional law specialist, Sullivan has
written extensively about controver
sies surrounding issues including
abortion, affirmative action and free
speech.
"1 am very concerned with free
speech and diversity within free
speech," Sullivan said. "We have a
contract with America that defends
i)ur civil rights, and it is this freedom
of speech and the balance of free
dom of religion and establishment of
religion that I am very interested in."
Gunther cites the wide range of
her interests as integral to her schol
arship and said the quality will add to
her tenure as dean.
"Just recently, Kathleen gave an
impeachment lecture at George
town, and a week later, she discussed
sex discrimination at Harvard,"
Gunther said. "She has the ability to
lecture on all different subjects and
ideas which stimulate thinking. Her
creativity and organization are phe
nomenal."
Her students are quick to praise
her "excellent" skills as a professor.
"She is a great professor, one of
the best and most popular teachers
at Stanford." said Dominique Day. a
third-year law student who has
taken both of her constitutional law
classes. "She is very accessible and
engages you in constitutional law.
She's definitely one of the most tal
ented lawyers in America. She is
very strong, very capable."
Sullivan, who outside ol the class
room and courtroom enjoys reading,
movies and hiking around Northern
California, has argued before the
Supreme Court and has been a guest
on Nightline and the News Hour
with Jim Lehrer.
She called her experiences of
standing at the podium before the
Supreme Court "both awesome and
intimate at once."
"It's a small courtroom, but with
all the drama of an ancient temple
marble columns and crimson cur
tains." Sullivan said. "The Justices

are amazingly well-prepared and
vigorous in questioning.''
Harvard Professor Lawrence
Tribe, with whom she worked exten
sively while at Harvard, called her
various public appearances and
plethora of litigation as testimonies
to "her brilliance."
"From the time I first encoun
tered Kathleen Sullivan as my stu
dent. to the times we worked togeth
er on Supreme Court litigation, to
the time I've watched from afar as
her career has soared, she has unlail
ingly struck me as amazing in just
about every respect," Tribe said.
"She is remarkably quick to grasp
and analyze the essence ol a situa
tion, tremendously insightful at dig
ging out each problem's most stub
born secrets, enormously gifted at
recombining and synthesizing the el
ements of any puzzle into a crystal
clear result, and unequaled in her
ability to convey her conclusions in
the most lucid prose, both written
and oral. It's hard to ask for anything
more." he said.
Sullivan's role
Sullivan sees her new occupation
as dean as a "tremendous opportuni
ty" to contribute to Stanford and the
legal profession.
She said she will act as a "sound
ing board" for other deans of law
schools, CEOs of businesses, alum
ni. faculty, students and academics.
"I'll have one foot in academia,
the other in business," she said.
Sullivan's occupation as dean is a
five-year appointment, but it can be
renewedindefinitely.
"I will give it my best shot for live
years and then see," she said.
She said at present, she would
not leave Stanford for a high-level
position in an administration such as
the Supreme Court, though, at the
age of 36, she was called a potential
future nominee of the Supreme
Court.
"Mv only interest at the moment
is in doing the best job I can as dean
of Stanford Law School," Sullivan
said.

Sullivan's vision
Sullivan plans to learn "as much
as [she] can" before Sept. I. She
hopes to examine and emulate many
aspects of Brest's tenure.
"Brest has supported faculty as
they develop in new directions and
produce extra-curricular innova
tions," Sullivan said. "He's also
strengthened the alumni base in
credibly and has garnered tremen
dous financial support. 1 want to ex
tend that further and study what can
be done."
Sullivan commends Brest's finan
cial campaign, which will end in Oc
tober, and said that its bringing in
$80 million was instrumental in
keeping and recruiting top faculty
members. She plans to continue
fund raising actively.
Among the issues she sees facing
the Law School today, the most im
portant involve technology, shifts in
curricular methods and presenting
law as a rewarding career.
" Technology is really changing
the face of law, and we're trying to
develop ways to ease law schools
and lawyers into this transition." Sul
livan said. "We're also straying away
from the traditional curriculum of
reading cases and the problem
method. We're taking more integra
tionist approaches. At the same
time. I see it as a law school's duty to
find ways to make law — the career
itself — a satisfying one. Accom
plishing all this should not be diffi
cult considering the distinctive facul
ty we have here."
In reference to the notorious U.S.
News & World Report graduate
school rankings, which placed Stan
ford's law school this year in a tie for
second with Harvard, following
Yale, Sullivan said her goal is to have
Stanford be "the very best." some
thing that C i lint her believes she can
achieve.
"I have lull confidence in her abil
ity to make Stanford the best." he
said. "She has an enormous amount
of respect among the faculty, and she
will challenge faculty to be the best."
"I am anxious that the world is
aware of Stanford, of our creativity

and constructivity," Sullivan said.
"The negative incidents that have
been reported in the press tend to
mar the terrific things that are going
on here."
Diversity at the Law School
First among the negative inci
dents is black professor Linda
Mabry's resignation from the Law
School last December, which she at
tributed to "the law school's racially
hostile environment" in an interview
in February. About a month later.
Prof. Thomas Kendall, who is also
black, received a condescending e
mail from an anonymous student.
"My goal as dean is to form an en
vironment that is as inclusive as pos
sible and that no one ever leaves
with those reactions," Sullivan said,
referring to Mabry's allegations that
the Law School treats "women and
people of color" unequally.
Sullivan called herself a propo
nent of diversity "of every kind" and
a supporter of affirmative action.
"Brest has been fully behind cre
ating a diverse environment at the
Law School," Sullivan said. "I am
committed to continuing that, be
cause civility of environment is very
important to me."
Brest said that in dealing with is
sues that arose out of the Mabrv and
Kendall cases, he would suggest to
Sullivan that, "You never know
what the issue of the day is going to
be."
Brest held town hall meetings this
past year in an effort to address is
sues of diversity that students were
concerned with. Sullivan plans to
keep an open dialogue with students
in this manner as well as on a more
personal level.
"I want to meet with students
from a wide range of leaders on a
regular basis," Sullivan said. "I am
attentive to issues across the board
and Ironi a wide range, and it will be
my goal to bolster an already inclu
sive environment."
"She will listen to everybody,"
Tribe said. "She takes people's con
cerns seriously, and comes up with

non-zero-sum solutions just about
every time."
Gunthei' added that Sullivan
would likely make the issue of diver
sity one of her foremost.
"She will light a candle under the
faculty about issues like diversity,"
Gunther said. "She is clearly a sup
porter of affirmative action in the
student area, and she is herself a
woman, so I know her support of di
versity will be strong. [Brest] has
been very welcoming to diverse fac
ulty, and I know [Sullivan] will con
tinue that."
Law student Day was firm in her
belief that Sullivan could provide a
considerable degree of backing be
hind the diversity issue.
"1 really do believe that anything
she believes in she accomplishes.
Lawyering is a problem-solving pro
fession," Day said. "If she decides to
take a strong lead and takes respon
sibility for the situations created for
people of color and particularly
women of color, she will succeed.
She can make everyone take that re
sponsibility, from which change will
come positively and quickly. It's a
matter of taking a stand and making
the commitment to diversity, which
she can do."
Before Stanford
Sullivan was 29 when she began
teaching at Harvard Law School,
where she became a tenured profes
sor and remained for the next 10
years. Suilivan came to Stanford as a
visiting professor in spring of 1992,
and says that she was immediately
attracted to the University's atmos
phere.
"Stanford is an ideal place," Sulli
van said. " There is a sense of new
ness, of innovation and energy. As
one of the youngest, premier Amer
ican universities, it is forward-look
ing, as it considers issues of global di
mensions. issues of race and gender.
Newness and vibrancy here is in
cumbent."
Her performance as a visiting
professor, Gunther said, was excep
tionally strong.

"As a visitor, Kathleen was
promptly getting ratings of an aver
age of 4.96, [five being the highest],"
Gunther said. "And these ratings
were given by critical students."
Day said there were a number of
qualities in Sullivan that she would
want to emulate as she embarks on
her career as a lawyer next year.
"1 hope that as an attorney, I can
look at an issue the way [Sullivan]
does and break it down and plug in
the solutions," said Day. "She can
take an issue like abortion and break
it into the five components or so and
also say these are the cases that form
the solutions. It's a beautiful way of
dissecting an issue and getting sim
ple solutions. She brings simplicity to
morass, and she brings that to class."
Sullivan is at a height in her ca
reer, and undoubtedly, the deanship
will tend to detract from scholarship
and research that she could be con
tributing to her field, but those who
know her are not too concerned.
"Being dean is time-consuming
and one thing not even Kathleen
Sullivan can do is turn the 24-hour
day into a 30-hour day," Tribe said.
"Although, if anybody could do it,
she could. I'm sure she will continue
to take teaching very seriously, and
will do great work in whatever re
search and writing projects she un
dertakes, but there's no doubt that
something will have to give, and it'll
probably be the sheer quantity of re
search tasks she commits herself to."
Sullivan will continue to teach
constitutional law as well and will
edit another edition of Constitution
al Law with Gunther.
"I'll try to do as much as I can to
stay in touch with my field as well as
learn as much as I can about the
work of my colleagues," she said.
When asked what Sullivan would
want the Law School to be in 10
years, she paused briefly before a
flood of words came out.
"I want us to be the most innovative
connection between scholarship, new
methodologies, and the practice of law,"
she said. "That connection is what Is fun
damental tothe Law School's success as an
institution."
