### Ritu Bhatnagar 
Kathleen Sullivan, the next
dean of the I .aw School, may share
more in common with the average
Stanford student than one might
think. She certainly knows a great
deal about burning the midnight
oil. as her Law School colleague
and friend. Emeritus Prof. Gerald
(inilther. will attest.
"Kathleen and I were using a
particular book for sonic courses
that we were teaching." (iunther
said. "The publisher of the book
was putting pressure on the both of
us to churn out ;i teaching manual
for the book.and I still had ;i couple

of chapters of the book left to teach,
the publishers wanted the manual
written within a week, and I told
them there was no way I could do it
in that time. Kathleen didn't have
as many chapters left, and she vol
unteered."
According to (iunther. she
spent that entire week, working day
and night, to produce a 3(H)-page
teaching manual, "all in perfect
prose."
"II I tried to do that, it would
have taken me months, and she did
it in a week," (iunther said. "That
manual was so far superior to other
teaching manuals that it is used by
people teaching from other
books."

(iunther and other colleagues
are certain that Sullivan will bring
this same type of determination
and commitment to her new post.
