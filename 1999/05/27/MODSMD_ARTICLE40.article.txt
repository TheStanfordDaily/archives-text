ne of the most surprising revela
f/yj tions of the original punk revolu
vr/ tion was that pure noise could be
beautiful. The Psychedelic Furs pioneered
this development with their tightly con
trolled drone-rock which blurred the
boundaries between gloss and dissonance.
A number of experimental bands, such
Sonic Youth and the Jesus and Mary Chain,
further developed this style, which has now
become something of a cliche. Although
distortion is now a touchstone of indie
rock, numerous groups betray the move
ment's original vision by using sloppy feed
back as a sign of "credibility."
However, in the late '80s, melodic distor
tion was a violently romantic statement,
and one of the best — and least-known —
purveyors of this aesthetic was the
Wedding Present. The UK quartet, led by
vocalist / guitarist / songwriter David
Gedge, released a string of singles on RCA
Records which passionately redefined
beauty in the context of traditional rock
instrumentation. These tracks, along with
assorted B-sides, rarities and live tracks,
have now been re-released as the two-disc
compilation, "Singles 1989-1991
The first single, "Kennedy," tells the
whole story. An irresistible bass-driven
pulse drives the song while guitars pile on
layers of churning rhythms, jagged distor
tion and chiming melodies. The half-spo
ken vocals add an edge of cocky despera

tion to the mix, giving the song's climax
real emotional punch.
The track is a masterpiece, and the com
pilation contains many more tracks of such
stature — the harrowing, relentless rocker
"Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me),"
the transcendent "Dalliance," the gorgeous
"Crawl." Even instrumentals, such as "Dan
Dare" and "Signal," have a rare, triumphant
power.
Although the group's major strength is a
rich, heavily layered sound, the romantic
pretentiousness of Gedge's voice is timeless.
Thus, he can deliver lines like "I haven't
worn a shirt like that since, oh, 1974" with
surprising dignity. For those who still want
to believe in 1977, the Wedding Present is
indispensable.
The live tracks, which comprise most of
the second disc, weigh down the compila
tion with mediocre work. Nonetheless, the
singles chronicled on the first disc are mon
uments which can stand with the best of
their generation. The Wedding Present
deserves more than anonymity — drone
rock has rarely sounded better.
