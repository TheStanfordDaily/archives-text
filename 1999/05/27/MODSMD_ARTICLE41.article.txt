ft remember how the darkness
fw) doubled. I recall lightning
struck itself." It would be
hard to find a better description of
Television, one of rock's most tragically
underappreciated bands, than this line
from the band's immortal epic "Marquee
Moon." When Tom Verlaine and Richard
Lloyd stepped up on stage, plugged in their
guitars and began to play, the sound was
dark, mysterious, elemental and achingly
beautiful — some of the most fragilely
ferocious straight-up rock and roll ever
recorded.
Born out of the same CBGB scene that
produced the Ramones, Patti Smith,
Blondie and the Talking Heads, Television
was a deliberate anomaly. Though perfectly

capable of writing the two-minute pop
thrashers that dominated the punk scene
(try "See No Evil"), the group's true interest
lay in lengthy, elaborately plotted guitar
jams that swirled and struggled toward an
ecstatic transcendence.
Some reviewers accused band members
of being hippies or a punk Grateful Dead,
but Television was after something deeper
than a night of instrumental solos and acid.
It was trying to create a new rock idiom,
one stripped of blues and folk, a rock and
roll that was both urban and Romantic,
filthy and gorgeous, complicated and yet
seductively simple.
The result was 1977's "Marquee Moon,"
one of the greatest rock albums ever. With
its modal experiments, abstractly poetic
lyrics and gloomy gothic atmosphere, the
album should have been terrible, a preten
tious mire of — shudder — jazz-rock. The
miracle was that it worked — "Marquee
Moon" rocks every bit as fierce as any punk
album but never stoops to punk cliches.
The other miracle was that the album was
almost completely ignored. Why "Friction,"
a furiously innovative five minutes of pure
rock, is not played every hour on classic
rock stations will forever remain a mystery.
However, as the newly re-released 1978
live album "The Blow-Up" indicates,
Television's Bach-like studio precision was
only half of the story. On stage Verlaine and
Lloyd went absolutely wild, exploring any
idea that popped into their heads. The first
disc, composed mainly of shorter songs,
suffers slightly from this chaos (and suffers
greatly from the poor sound quality that
obscures Verlaine's brilliant lyrics), but the
lyrical cover of "Knockin' on Heaven's
Door" hints at the majesty to come.
The second disc is dominated by 15-
minute versions of "Little Johnny Jewel"
and "Marquee Moon," which together con
stitute Television's greatest statement of
purpose and one of rock's most profound
ly religious experiences. It's almost impos
sible to describe these performances except
to say that they're not like anything you've
ever heard. They are, as Verlaine squawks,
"Too too too, to put a finger on it."
So if you've never listened to Television,
find a copy of "Marquee Moon" and pre
pare for a life-changing experience. After
that, get "The Blow-Up" and find out what
the could really do.
