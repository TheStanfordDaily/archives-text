## TIME TO 'GET REAL' Wake-up call to teen films 
### 
f** his British import from first-time film director Simon Shore
has generated plenty of critical buzz, although much of
America has never even heard of "Get Real." The sad fact that
movies like "Idle Hands" and "Jawbreaker" continue to receive all-star
treatment from studios is a telling indication of the profit-motive of film
executives. It's time to take a chance, Stanford, and seek out "Get Real," a

romantic comedy starring a host of talented unknowns.
Adapted from Patrick Wilde's play, the movie centers on Steven
Carter, played brilliantly by Ben Silverstone (young Humbert-
Humbert in "Lolita"). He's very much the high-school student
we've seen before on the big screen — Steven is a bit awkward and
lanky, but he also has a growing sexual drive that is fulfilled by the
occasional one-night stand. Steven's parents (Jacquetta May an
David Lumsden) are virtually clueless about their son's lifestyle, and

only when it's almost too late does the mother begin to realize
how drastically wrong they were about their son.
Steven's best friend, Linda, is winningly staged by

Charlotte Brittain. Yes, there are the occasional fat-girl
jokes, but Linda also harbors a welcome sense of pride
(exhibited by her rejection of the school's "player") and
lust (portrayed by her scandalous affair with a driving
instructor). Linda makes you laugh and cry, though
sometimes you wish she would break a bit more oul ot

the stereotype.
1 suppose the main reason that "Get Real" works is
the love story component. Steven is a highly popular
student at a private school, and immediately you know
his love is forbidden. You can tell by the music, and
you can assume that both their families and friends,
would reject the relationship. For the sake of space
we'll call the object of Steven's love "1" (long first

name).
J has a number of strikes against
getting involved with Steven — J is
already involved in a relationship. Plus,

the track star; meanwhile Steven is a

romance. Steven convinces Linda to collapse at a wedding recep

some liquor and a wide smile.
Would it surprise you if B's full name was John Dixon
(Brad Gorton), and John met Steven in the men's
restroom, and both boys had not yet come out to their
uptight school friends? I have a feeling the homophobes
and the closed-minded of the world just flipped the

page. But for the remaining readers, I speak the truth
when I tell you that this is the most compelling
; romance I have seen this year. OK, the competition is
"She's All That" and "Forces of Nature," but the fact
remains that "Get Real" achieves the most realism,
j despite its difficult subject matter.
