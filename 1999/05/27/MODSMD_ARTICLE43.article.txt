# LOVE'S 'LETTER' LOST

wonder if small
( town life is really
like the lives pre
sented in"The Love Letter,"
in which everyone seeming
ly knows everybody else and
the slightest alteration of the
norm throws people into a
frenzy. Does the movie (low

logically? Probably not. But given the talent
pool of the ensemble cast and the dreamy New
England setting, this film is perhaps worth a
brief and fleeting look.
Fortyish bookstore owner Helen
McFarquhar (Kate Capshaw) comes across a
mysterious — and unsigned — love note
while sifting through the mail. Of course,
being the forlorn and lonely woman she is, she
automatically assumes that the letter's meant
for her. Who could the handsome suitor be?
The aging fireman (Tom Selleck)? The 20-
year-old college intern (Tom Everett Scott,
"Dead Man on Campus")?
One has to be careful with this sort of
whimsical premise. It is just as easy to go over
board with the local flavor as it is to fall short
in developing the main characters fully.
Director Peter Chan, who has largely worked

on Chinese-language films, has a great catch
with Ellen DeGeneres as Helen's bitter manag
er. DeGeneres wryly uncorks numerous one
liners, including a hilarious gag which plays
off of her much ballyhooed sexual orienta
tion. As the post office manager, she is just as
turned on by the lyrical nature of the letter,
but Helen makes it perfectly clear to whom
the letter is supposed to be sent.
The repeated use of the letter as a focal
point for antics and hijinks is reminiscent of
"Waking Ned Devine," where a lottery ticket
sends a small Irish town into a frantic search
to find the winner. In "Letter," Loblolly by the
Sea functions as the stereotypical small town,
with few twists added to the mold. There is no
nude romp on the beach; instead, we are sub
jected to a couple of jogs on the beach —
including one in which Helen "coincidentally"
meets the man potentially behind the letter.
The letter seems to be magical. It is almost
a way to touch the inner depths of the soul.
Helen's mother, played by Blythe Danner, is
particularly moved by its words as a remem
brance of her youth. Helen's grandmother,
Gloria Stuart from "Titanic," is spunky, sur
rounded by miscellaneous goods, and views
the love letter as a sort of jigsaw-puzzle. Sound

familiar?
The romances
that spring up in .
the movie don't )
seem genuine. j-j
It's as if "Letter"

uses the con
trivance of this
anonymous note to
excuse the behavior

of the town

resi
dents.

Sometimes the results
are hilarious and thought-provoking. (What
would have happened had Helen looked
inside the postcard years ago? Isn't it ironic
that DeGeneres is fantasizing about another
man in town?) But most scenes, such as those
between Helen and her respective men, are
under-developed and hollow. "The Love
Letter" tries to be a witty romantic comedy,
but, like the note itself, the characters and the
plot are so fleeting and lightweight that they
could float away at any moment.
