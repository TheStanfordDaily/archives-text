Theater
THUR/27 - SUN/30
"Letters to a Student Revolutionary" by Elizabeth Wong, directed by John Lim.
Although Wong's play culminates in the events of the Chinese student uprising
in Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989, the core of the play is a friendship
between two women of widely disparate cultures who have in common their
youth, gender and race. 10 pm Thursday, 8 p.m. Friday & Saturday, 2:30 pm
Sunday in Prosser Studio (behind Memorial Auditorium). For tickets email

Film
THUR/27
In 1982,"My Dinner with Andre" made a whole generation stop and think about
its lives in a way no other movie of the time could even dream of: a movie con
sisting entirely of two old friends — Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory — in
conversation over dinner. That the film completely disregards what movies are
supposed to be all about makes the accomplishment all the greater. Snacks,
cookies and tea will be provided. 7:00 p.m. at the Bechtel International Center.
THUR/27
"Strangers in Good Company," one of the most heartwarming and life-affirming
films about older women ever made. A group of retired women is forced to find
shelter in an abandoned cabin when their bus breaks down on a country road.
They bond, and discuss issues pertaining to the elderly. 10 p.m. in Synergy
Lounge.
FRI/28
"Dresden," an examination of the world told through pictures and sounds. A narra
tive story unfolds within the context of the film, embedded in divergent scenes of
New York City and soundscapes that mesmerize the viewer.
Director/Writer/Cinematographer Ben Speth will be present for introductory
remarks and Q&A following the screening. 7 p.m. in the History Buildling, Room 2.
Exquisite Corpse
WED/2
A Futurist Banquet, featuring "The Roar of Ascent", "144 Cartwheels", "Blushing
Photography" and more. Food is a possibility. RSVP to zacharyh@leland by
