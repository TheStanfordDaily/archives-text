isoon-to-be Miss Sass working n the
computer cluster, when a little wren alit on the
window sill. Testifying to the magi*, of fate, the
wren twittered about an opening in
Intermission for a sex columnist. Your Miss Sass
jumped at the chance, and now nine months
and 20,726 words later, we find ourselves at the
last Free Sexx of the year.
Now, it's been Miss Sass' pleasure to share
with you gallons from her fountain of sex know
bow. And over the year, the water level has risen
as Miss Sass gleaned random info from research
and conversations with people about column
ideas. So, for this one last discussion, she
thought she would share with you 10 tidbits that
this sex guru either didn't know before or felt
must be shared.
1. If you like sex in the least, there exist three
publications you need to have. They are, in no
particular order, "Sex Tips for Girls," "The Guide
to Getting It On" and "SEXlife" magazine. The
first will give you a frivolous, 1980s take on all
things carnal, with chapters on obsession, dress
ing like a French maid and sex and Quaaludes.
Not just for girls, "Sex Tips" will whip both the
careless lover and the disillusioned one back
into shape and was a true source of inspiration
for Miss Sass. Tl|(f=«ecojgd is a more serious
source of information that talks straight about
fisting and anything else you're too shy to ask
your doctor about. And the third, a quarterly
magazine, will give you the latest low down on
sex info, as well as comics, personal stories and
photo essays, This literary triumvirate is essen
tial for anyone .timing to be modern, hep and
sexy.
2. While we're on the subject of media, track
down if you can a CD titled "Cyborgasjh." It has
a fairly wide assortment of erotic samples,
including a surly dominatrix shouting com
mantfs: and; about truck-driving lovers.
The track that contains a vtainan jmoa&irig and
screaming especially useful for putting behind
a shut bedroom door when you jhave a house
£ party. And it's all in 3»D stereo sound, so grab a
headphone splitter and get aural.
K 3. This from one of Miss Sais' professor#
$ Apparently, taking megadoses of the vitamin
je Niacin will make a girl crazy-orgasmic. He
o reported that an ex-girlfriend of his has been
taking tfie stuff and hits the ceiling over and over
again. Miss Sass isn't sure what a megadose
amounts to, but it's a worthy cause that merits a
little experimentation.
4. Speaking of trying new things, Miss Sass
thinks the French have it right, as far as kissing
goes. Depending on the region you're in Miss
Sass hears you may get as many as foui kisses
(two alternately on each cheek) in greeting C'est
trds chic, so kiss someone next time you gel a
chance.
5. Another random info source proves that
sex turns up in the strangest places: One reader
wrote to Miss Sass with questions about vihra
tors and bike seats. It seems the boy was a

mechanical engineering buff who wanted to
make a stationary bike with a vibrator built right
in. He wanted to know whether the vibrating
should take place the whole time a person rode
or if it should activate at the end of a session, as
a reward ul" sorts. Miss Sass isn't sure how the
endeavor turned out but would be thrilled to see
the Vißikti 2000 on the market anytime soon.
6. Falling under the category of "to each his
own," you never know how many different
fetishes exist until you search the Web. To
expand your vocabulary, try these tongue
twisters: cocrophilia (marked interest in excre
ment); frotteurism (masturbation by rubbing
against a stranger); infantilism (dependency on
the feeling of diapers or being dressed like a
baby); klismaphilia (dependency on being given
an enema); mysophilia (liking dirty things like
worn undies); and scoptophilia (liking to obvi
ously look at sex organs or activity). Try rattling
those off at your next cocktail party.
7. Again, thanks to the Web, Miss Sass has a
summer job idea for you. One ambitious coed
currently sells her panties off her Web page to
put herself through school. Her page advertises
several kinds of panties, as well as several differ
ent activities during which she'll wear the
panties, as per your request. While the overhead
is decidedly low for her business (she'd be wear
ing panties anyway, right?), Miss Sass is thankful
for her sake that it's only a junior college the girl
is financing.
8. Among other startling facts lies a letter
.received from a reader shofrtr alter the penile
injury column. Apparently, the poor boy bad
suffered exactly the type of fracture Miss Sass
had described, and as the result of the ill-timed
pelvic snap on the part of his girlfriend, had
been living in agony for four months. Miss Sass
urged him to see a doctor immediately, and she
urges you to take care of ypur nether regions.
Boys, do your monthly testicfe e?tatB with dili
igeoce, since ages 18—- 25 arojyoor highest risk
years. ladies, the same goes for your breast and
pelvic exams. Your parts are so much more fun
when kept in prime working order. Enough said.
9. Along the same genital safety lines, if you
| jpcedaJ fnother rea«pn tQ gp gefcyour fte* con
doms from Coweß, the reason has arrived: the
SHPRC now carries flavored condoms in straw
berry, banana and chocolate. While the thought
of sucking on a banana flavored unit sounds
dubious to Miss Sass, the strawberry and choco
late are vaguely enticing. And diid Miss Sass
mention they're free?
10. An excerpt from * 101 things not to say
during sex": "do yt»u smell something burning?"
*a little rug bum never hurt anyone; '*! think
you have it on backwards" and "are you sure 1
don't know you from somewhere?" Just some
things to keep in mind.
And there you have it. Miss Sass would like to
thank you, dear readers, for making her perpet
ual state of "sex on the brain" a justifiable one.
May the summer bring you true love and ecstasy
or at least mind-rocking sex. By the way, those
20,726 words Miss Sass has written filled exactly
69 pages — destiny, if ever Miss Sass saw it.
Best,
Krista

panties, as per your request. While the overhead
is decidedly low for her business (she'd be wear
ing panties anyway, right?), Miss Sass is thankful
for her sake that it's only a junior college the girl
is financing.
8. Among other startling facts lies a letter
.received from a reader shofrtr alter the penile
injury column. Apparently, the poor boy bad
suffered exactly the type of fracture Miss Sass
had described, and as the result of the ill-timed
pelvic snap on the part of his girlfriend, had
been living in agony for four months. Miss Sass
urged him to see a doctor immediately, and she
urges you to take care of ypur nether regions.
Boys, do your monthly testicfe e?tatB with dili
igeoce, since ages 18—- 25 arojyoor highest risk
years. ladies, the same goes for your breast and
pelvic exams. Your parts are so much more fun
when kept in prime working order. Enough said.
9. Along the same genital safety lines, if you

doms from Coweß, the reason has arrived: the
SHPRC now carries flavored condoms in straw
berry, banana and chocolate. While the thought
of sucking on a banana flavored unit sounds
dubious to Miss Sass, the strawberry and choco
late are vaguely enticing. And diid Miss Sass
mention they're free?
10. An excerpt from * 101 things not to say
during sex": "do yt»u smell something burning?"
*a little rug bum never hurt anyone; '*! think
you have it on backwards" and "are you sure 1
don't know you from somewhere?" Just some
things to keep in mind.
And there you have it. Miss Sass would like to
thank you, dear readers, for making her perpet
ual state of "sex on the brain" a justifiable one.
May the summer bring you true love and ecstasy
or at least mind-rocking sex. By the way, those
20,726 words Miss Sass has written filled exactly
69 pages — destiny, if ever Miss Sass saw it.
Best,
Krista
