Our search for delicious local Italian food arrives this
week at Spalti. Located on California Avenue, Spalti
offers old-style Italian cuisine in a soothing, modern set
ting. With its two outdoor patios, this restaurant can
accommodate many dinners while maintaining a spa
cious feel. In addition, the restaurant's friendly feel kept
us from feeling intimidated by the intense conversation
about the "Solow Model" by the business school brain at
the table behind us.
The dimly lit interior enhances the contrast between
the soft salmon colors of the sponge-painted walls and
the bright modern art hanging there. Excepting a nice
poster by Joan Miro, the majority of the paintings were
abstractions paintings by unknown artists. The L-shaped
wooden bar and its wine rack completed Spalti's authen
tic Italian feel.
"Spalti," meaning "open air" in Italian, is the obvious
name for a restaurant with two large patios. Another
obvious name would be "Patio."
The service was excellent. The waiter, who had an
"Italian" accent, was a great help in selecting our dishes.
For our appetizers, we decided to sample a variety of
dishes. First, we indulged in an extremely thinly sliced
beef carpaccio with shredded Parmesan. This tasty dish
was followed by a clam and mussel dish as well as a
portabello mushroom and chopped tomatoes dish. The
clams and mussels were fresh and light and the broth was
perfect for bread dipping. The warm portabello mush
room was covered with a salsa-textured tomato sauce. We
highly recommend it. Both of the appetizers were delec
table.
While deciding on our main courses, we came to the
dark realization that we were spending too many meals
together: we both wanted such similar dishes. David,
who chose first, enjoyed the veal Marsala. This fine cut of
meat was perfectly accompanied by a light wine sauce
and savory mushrooms. After hearing David order,
Adrien went on a limb and ordered the veal scaloppini.
Unlike most veal scaloppini, Spalti's version has thinly
sliced prosciutto and is topped with melted cheese. A
healthy application of prosciutto added much excite
ment to this traditional dish. We also tried the seafood
ravioli, the specialty of the night. Though perhaps not as
delicious as the veal dishes, the lobster and prawn-filled
pasta in cream sauce was a fine selection.
Our meal concluded with a multi-layered tiramisu
that was a fitting conclusion to a great meal. With its rea
sonable prices, friendly service, and outdoor accommo
dations, Spalti is perfect for almost all occasions.
