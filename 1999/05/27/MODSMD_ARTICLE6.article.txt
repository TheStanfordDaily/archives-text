In the tradition of comedians like David
Spade at Frost Amphitheater last year, the
Stanford Concert Network ended I lie year
with a tree comedy performance last night at
Kresge Auditorium showcasing the rowd\
talents ol Panly Shore, of "Encino Man" and
M l V fame.
"It was a great way for people to have
some fun before they have to deal with fi
nals." said senior Marc Mitchell, director of
the concert network.
Already familiar to many students for his
movie work, Shore strode onstage in dark
glasses and a hooded sweatshirt pulled over
his head in the parody of a celebrity wishing
to maintain anonymity. His routine included
comments about his neighbor. Wes Craven,
and the women in Los Angeles.
Alter some raunchy jokes about his dog.
Paulv admonished the crowd about what lie

considered were the true lessons of life.
"II you learn anything in school. .. it's you
gotta obey the woman!" he said.
Toward the end of the performance, as
students began trickling out of the auditori
um, Shore decided to make that ;i part of his
act.
"You guys don't seem to react well to the
dim stuff, which is a problem, cause it's all I
have." Shore said. "I'm a dirty guy."
Shore then shucked lus routine in favor of
direct interaction with some members of the
audience.
A man in the first row who said he was a
pediatrician suggested that Shore become a
gynecologist. Shore reacted with mock indig
nation.
In typical comedy club fashion, three
opening acts warmed-up the audience before
Shore took center stage. Comedians Dennis
