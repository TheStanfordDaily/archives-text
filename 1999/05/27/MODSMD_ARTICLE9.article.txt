# Motor boards roll onto campus
## Scooters provide transportation alternatives 
### Meredith Rowe Staff writer 
For many, they're a great form of
transportation. After all, they're fast,
lightweight, easy to maneuver and
convenient. For some students on
campus, motor scooters can replace a
bike or a car.
Motor scooters are appearing
more and more on campus recently in
the spring weather, providing stu
dents with an easy way to get to class.
"I ride my scooter when I'm going
to Fry's [Electronics], or every once
in a while I ride it to class when I have
to go somewhere far," senior Joe
I airchild said. "I use it so I can drive
up and down El ('amino. It's mainly
useful because I don't have a car., and
I basically treat it like a car."
However, it is questionable
whether or not motor scooters are ac
tually allowed at Stanford. Much like
skateboards, they appear to be
banned under campus regulations.
According to the New Stanford
farm Almanac, "no motorcycle,
motor scooter, or moped shall be dri
ven. operated, stopped, left standing
or parked within UK) feet of any of
fice, classroom, library, or residence
hall unless specifically authorized by
a traffic control device."
Additionally, "motorized vehi
cles. including motorcycles, scooters,
and mopcds. are not allowed in the
inner campus area. They may go only
where cars may go."
Motor scooter owners must pur
chase a parking permit at Transporta
tion Services, wear a helmet and be li
censed drivers.
Fairchild said he follows these reg

ulations.
"I don't drive in between the bol
lards," he said. "I try and respect
where other people want to park. I try
to put it in a place that's out of the
way. But some of the parking violates
the regulations, so that could poten
tially affect me."
These rules seem easy to violate,
though. It is hard to find a place on
campus that is actually not within KM)
feet of a dormitory, classroom, or of
fice.

Scooters, like other motor
vehicles, must be kept at
least 100 feet from all
campus buildings.

As Fairchild said, some of the
parking available for scooters is that
close to dormitories. Often he has to
park his scooter in the grass near
Toyon because there are no other
spaces available. I le also knows peo
ple with smaller scooters that "drive
everywhere," probably violating the
regulations.
Questions about the legality of
motor scooters are shedding light on
concern over the campus skateboard
ing ban. Currently, skateboarding is
not permitted in most areas on cam
pus. in accordance with Santa Clara
( ounty ()rdinance 85-30.
Several I erra residents, including
sophomore Alex Millie, are passing
around a petition to overturn the
skateboarding ban.
"The current situation — the im
position of criminal penalties like a
$ 1 (X) fine. misdemeanor charges —as
serious in the eyes of the law as. say,
marijuana possession or petty theft
—• and confiscation of skateboard
is grossly unfair," he said. "It has led
to the arrest of many ... students
commuting to and from class."
