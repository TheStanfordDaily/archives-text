# Bookstore overcharges patrons
## Some September transactions were accidentally double-billed to customers' credit card accounts 
### Jennie Berry Editorial staff 
The Stanford Bookstore may face
a legal investigation concerning the

way it handled
the accidental
overbilling of
hundreds of cus
tomers last Sep
tember.
Over a two
or three-day pe
riod in late Sep
tember, the
Bookstore dou
ble-billed many
of its credit-card
paying cus
tomers. The
overbilling was a
result of a com
puter system
error, according
to Peggy Men
delson, president
and CEO of
Stanford Book
store.
To date more
than 4(H) people
who noticed the
overbilling have
been reimbursed

Although
Bookstore
managers
learned of
the error in
November,
they have
made no
effort to
contact
customers,
correcting
only those
mistakes
brought to
them.

a combined total of $32,(XX). But the
actual number of people over
charged may be much higher.
"A lot of people don't look at
their credit cards, [so] they might

only see half of the people [over
charged]." said Santa Clara Assistant
District Attorney A 1 Weger. "It
doesn't sound like they did enough.
We'd want to see an investigation
done."
The Bookstore became aware of
the overcharging a month after it oc
curred, as some customers began to
request refunds. At that point, how
ever. the Bookstore did not notify its
customers of the billing or take steps
to correct it.
A failure to take proactive mea
sures might be grounds for a civil or
criminal lawsuit, according to Weger.
An investigation would come at a
particularly bad time for the Book
store since it is in final buy-out nego
tiations with an outside retailer.
Delay in noticing error
Mendelson said the credit card er
rors took place at the individual cash
registers as customers were making
purchases.
"It was a system error," she said.
"It was not a bank problem; it was
certainly a Bookstore issue."
The error was connected to the
Bookstore's upgrade of its computer
system in September. According to
Mendelson. the new software did not
always notify cashiers that a charge
had been transmitted and verified, so
cashiers would use the old system as
well and accidentally double-charge
some customers in the process.
The double-charges appeared as

two separate, identical transactions
on printed credit card statements.
Customers who noticed the discrep
ancy began to report their findings to
the Bookstore.
Mendelson said it took about 30
days before the Bookstore realized
that overbillings were clustered over
a specific period. She added that the

process was further complicated be
cause not every customer during this
period was overcharged.
As customers came in with com
plaints, the Bookstore reversed the
charges. The reimbursed money
came from the store's daily operating
