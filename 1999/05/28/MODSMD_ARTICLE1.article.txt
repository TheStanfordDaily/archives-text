# Bookstore overcharges patrons
## Some September transactions were accidentally double-billed to customers' credit card accounts 
### Jennie Berry Editorial staff 
The Stanford Bookstore may face
a legal investigation concerning the

way it handled
the accidental
overbilling of
hundreds of cus
tomers last Sep
tember.
Over a two
or three-day pe
riod in late Sep
tember, the
Bookstore dou
ble-billed many
of its credit-card
paying cus
tomers. The
overbilling was a
result of a com
puter system
error, according
to Peggy Men
delson, president
and CEO of
Stanford Book
store.
To date more
than 4(H) people
who noticed the
overbilling have
been reimbursed

Although
Bookstore
managers
learned of
the error in
November,
they have
made no
effort to
contact
customers,
correcting
only those
mistakes
brought to
them.

a combined total of $32,(XX). But the
actual number of people over
charged may be much higher.
"A lot of people don't look at
their credit cards, [so] they might

only see half of the people [over
charged]." said Santa Clara Assistant
District Attorney A 1 Weger. "It
doesn't sound like they did enough.
We'd want to see an investigation
done."
The Bookstore became aware of
the overcharging a month after it oc
curred, as some customers began to
request refunds. At that point, how
ever. the Bookstore did not notify its
customers of the billing or take steps
to correct it.
A failure to take proactive mea
sures might be grounds for a civil or
criminal lawsuit, according to Weger.
An investigation would come at a
particularly bad time for the Book
store since it is in final buy-out nego
tiations with an outside retailer.
Delay in noticing error
Mendelson said the credit card er
rors took place at the individual cash
registers as customers were making
purchases.
"It was a system error," she said.
"It was not a bank problem; it was
certainly a Bookstore issue."
The error was connected to the
Bookstore's upgrade of its computer
system in September. According to
Mendelson. the new software did not
always notify cashiers that a charge
had been transmitted and verified, so
cashiers would use the old system as
well and accidentally double-charge
some customers in the process.
The double-charges appeared as

two separate, identical transactions
on printed credit card statements.
Customers who noticed the discrep
ancy began to report their findings to
the Bookstore.
Mendelson said it took about 30
days before the Bookstore realized
that overbillings were clustered over
a specific period. She added that the

process was further complicated be
cause not every customer during this
period was overcharged.
As customers came in with com
plaints, the Bookstore reversed the
charges. The reimbursed money
came from the store's daily operating

revenue.
A total of about 4(X) to 450 cus
tomers came forward to request re
imbursement, most in a 1 S()-day peri
od after the overbilling occurred.
But, because the Bookstore was
relying on customers to inform them
if they had a problem, it is unlikely
that everyone was reimbursed.
"I'm not so sure how many stu
dents check their bills," said Miriam
Beyer, a freshman double-billed for
her fall books. "If it hadn't been that
big of a purchase, I don't think I
would've noticed."
Mendelson said the double
charging of 400 to 450 customers was
not a "mass" overbilling, calling such
a description "an overstatement."
She emphasized that on a day at the
beginning of the quarter, the Book
store handles approximately 6.5(X)
purchases per day. with about 58 per

cent charged to credit cards.
Accounts could have been credited
Mendelson said the Bookstore
didn't correct the bills en masse, be
cause it didn't know who the affected
customers were or how widespread
the problem was.
"There was no way to tell who was
overcharged, because it was all on
personal credit cards," she said. "We
only had the credit card numbers, not
the names or addresses of the card
holders We thought we were
doing everything we could do."
However officials from Bank of
America said the Bookstore could
have relied solely on the credit card
numbers to fix the overbilling. Bank
of America, the Bookstore's mer
chant bank, processes all credit cards
for the store.
"For the blanket statement to be
made that there's nothing that we
can't do — that's not true," said
Kathy Andreis, Bank of America
vice president manager of sales and
account management in Northern
California.
Bank of America, though, did not
get to try to address the problem, be
cause it was never notified of the
large overbilling, Andreis said.
Upon learning of a possible inves
tigation. Mendclson called Bank of
America officials yesterday, lor the
first time investigating what credit
options might be available to the
bank. She has not decided on a
course of action at this time.
If asked. Bank of America could
have sent the Bookstore a list of all
credit transactions over the two-day
period, and the Bookstore could
have used the list to identify dupli
cate charges. The store, using its ter
minals. could then have credited the
accounts of those showing duplicate
charges.
"It's a manual, manual process,"
Andreis emphasized. "It's Stanford's
judgment call."
Had Stanford consulted the bank,
however, it might have made a differ
ent judgment call.
Joe Villamil, Bank of America
manager of Northern California ac
count management, admitted he was
surprised the store did not credit
double-charged customer accounts.
"In all my time [at Bank of Amer
ica). no matter what the si/.e of the
merchant, they would always make
an effort to rectify a past mistake,"
Villamil commented. "They would
have at least done something."
Julia Beeson. a junior who was
double-billed, said she wished the
Bookstore would've taken more re
sponsibility for correcting the error:
"It would've simplified things a lot
more if the Bookstore dealt with
things since that's where the problem
originated."
Minimizing double paybacks
Mendclson added that the time

lag between the mistake's occur
rence and its discovery would make
corrections difficult it not impossible.
But, according to the Bank of Amer
ica officials, measures could have
been taken when the store discov
ered the overbilling, approximately
30 days after it occurred.
By the time cards were credited,
Andreis admitted, some customers
might have already begun charge
back proceedings. Credit card cus
tomers who are over- or double
charged can dispute a transaction
through their individual banks.
However Bank of America could
have taken steps to ensure that cus
tomers were not credited twice. Ac
cording to Andreis, if Bank of Amer
ica officials were notified that certain
customers were credited for the dou
ble-billing, they would monitor
Bookstore chargebacks to try to en
sure that it didn't pay for its mistakes
twice.
"II it's a client of this caliber," said
Andreis, "we'd definitely bend over
backwards to help out."
Both Bank of America officials
said the Bookstore would still risk
double-crediting some customers,
but they said they would recommend
crediting the accounts anyway.
No press release issued
Mendclson further stated the
Bookstore decided not to issue a
press release alerting the Stanford
community to the overbilling, be
cause Bookstore management didn't
want to concern customers.
"Because we were immediately
crediting the accounts of customers
who contacted us. we did not believe
that a press release was neces
sary .... Sometimes il you make an
announcement, it might aggravate
people more than it might help
them," she said.
Assistant District Attorney
Weger, though, characterized the ef
fect of a press release differently.
I le said a Bookstore press release
about the overbilling could have fur
thered confidence in the store by
showing how "conscientious" it was.
Students concurred.

"It's a bit disconcerting that [the
Bookstore] didn't try to tell people
about the mistake, that they had to tig
ure it out on their own," Beeson said.
"It would have been better for the
store to issue a release so that stu
dents could see the overcharging oc
curred." Beyer added. "It would be
negligent for them not to."
Police investigation proposed
Since it failed to take action when
it determined a problem existed, the
Bookstore may face legal conse
quences.
"I can't believe they couldn't call a
credit card company and ask if they
saw double-billing," Wegersaid. "It's
not very good business practice."
Weger initially became aware of the
Bookstore's practices when contact
ed as part of a Daily investigation.
Mendelson claimed she was un
aware of any legal responsibility to
try to fix the overbilling. "We had ab
solutely no intention to violate any
law." she said.
Weger countered that the Book
store should have been aware of its
responsibility to its customers. He
noted that it's not necessarily cus
tomers' duty to fix mischarges.
"Ignorance of the law is no excuse
....It's fine and well to examine
your hill for errors, but if someone il
legally takes your money, and you
don't see it... that's not justification
for a person taking your money. It
could be unfair business practices or
out-and-out theft," Weger said.
"You'd have to look at the details."
Weger continued, "I hope the
Stanford Police Department would
look into this matter and turn in a re
port to the District Attorney's Of
fice."
The police department, according
to Weger. would be the appropriate
investigative agency. He said the at
torney's office would then review a
report issued to it and decide
whether to prosecute.
Stanford Police Department Sgt.
Rick Tipton indicated that he would
take a recommendation to file a re
port seriously and that he was "inter
ested in looking into the matter."

If police launched such an investi
gation, Mendelson said the Book
store would be accommodating.
"If they want to do any inquiry, we
will be most cooperative," she said.
Bookstore could be liable
Weger explained that a store
could be civilly and / or criminally li
able if it discovered mass overbilling
and took no steps to rectify the prob
lem.
If the Bookstore is found guilty,
potential consequences include
restitution, civil damages and an in
junction, among other penalties.
Weger said that severity of
charges, if any are filed, would large
ly depend on how many people failed
to be refunded.
Members of the Bookstore's
Board of Directors could be held
legally and financially liable for any
wrongdoing. "The Bookstore is re
sponsible for its own legal and finan
cial matters," explained Mariann By
erwalter, vice president of business
affairs and chief financial officer.
History Prof. David Kennedy,
chairman of the Bookstore board of
directors, could not be reached for
comment.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt,
nonprofit corporation that is neither
owned nor controlled by Stanford,
though it is overseen by a 14-member
board of directors composed of Stan
ford faculty and staff. Shelly
Heberet, director of business devel
opment, described the Bookstore as
an "independent entity of the Uni
versity."
The board was significantly re
structured earlier this decade when
the Bookstore faced charges of ques
tionable compensation arrange
ments and stock market trading.
Managers ultimately had to pay
$1 million to the store in order to set
tle charges of mismanaged invest
ments made by the California Attor
ney General's office. Criminal
charges against the managers were
dismissed by a Santa Clara County
Municipal Court judge.
After the incident students
stopped serving on the Board of Di

rectors, and a student advisory com
mittee was created last year in order
to re-institutionalize students giving
input to Bookstore management.
Advisory committee members,
though, were not informed of the
September double-billing.
"They certainly never let us know
about the double-billing. We never
even heard a rumor to that effect."
said Jeffrey Wu, a second year law
and business student who serves on
the committee.
Buyout negotiations concluding
Current allegations of financial
wrongdoing come at a stressful time
for Bookstore administrators.
The store's Board of Directors
voted unanimously on March IS to
review buyout proposals from out
side for-profit retailers, and the
Bookstore now has picked its first ne
gotiating partner, according to
Mendelson.
"We're really on a fast track, and
our goal is to have it all completed by
our final board meeting on June 11.
Hopefully that's when the board will

vote on a final contract," Mendelson
said.
Mendelson herself plans to step
down from her position as president
and CEO this summer.
The aim of Bookstore manage
ment. according to Mendelson. is to
have the store ready to be turned
over to new owners at the end of its
1998-99 fiscal year on June 30.
The Bookstore handles approxi
mately 1.4 million transactions per
year, according to Mendelson. And
students, even those double-charged,
doubt that sales volume will drop
rapidly any time soon.
Freshman Nick Kapur, who was
double-charged for his Microsoft
Word purchase, explained that the
Bookstore is his one option: "Since it
is the only store around, I have to use
it."

If you were double-billed, you should
cull the Bookstore's accounting office
in Newark at 510-796-0774, ext.226.
Have your statement on hand so that
you can provide the account number,
the date of the purchase and the trans
action numbers.

relying on customers to inform them
if they had a problem, it is unlikely
that everyone was reimbursed.
"I'm not so sure how many stu
dents check their bills," said Miriam
Beyer, a freshman double-billed for
her fall books. "If it hadn't been that
big of a purchase, I don't think I
would've noticed."
Mendelson said the double
charging of 400 to 450 customers was
not a "mass" overbilling, calling such
a description "an overstatement."
She emphasized that on a day at the
beginning of the quarter, the Book
store handles approximately 6.5(X)
purchases per day. with about 58 per

cent charged to credit cards.
Accounts could have been credited
Mendelson said the Bookstore
didn't correct the bills en masse, be
cause it didn't know who the affected
customers were or how widespread
the problem was.
"There was no way to tell who was
overcharged, because it was all on
personal credit cards," she said. "We
only had the credit card numbers, not
the names or addresses of the card
holders We thought we were
doing everything we could do."
However officials from Bank of
America said the Bookstore could
have relied solely on the credit card
numbers to fix the overbilling. Bank
of America, the Bookstore's mer
chant bank, processes all credit cards
for the store.
"For the blanket statement to be
made that there's nothing that we
can't do — that's not true," said
Kathy Andreis, Bank of America
vice president manager of sales and
account management in Northern
California.
Bank of America, though, did not
get to try to address the problem, be
cause it was never notified of the
large overbilling, Andreis said.
Upon learning of a possible inves
tigation. Mendclson called Bank of
America officials yesterday, lor the
first time investigating what credit
options might be available to the
bank. She has not decided on a
course of action at this time.
If asked. Bank of America could
have sent the Bookstore a list of all
credit transactions over the two-day
period, and the Bookstore could
have used the list to identify dupli
cate charges. The store, using its ter
minals. could then have credited the
accounts of those showing duplicate
charges.
"It's a manual, manual process,"
Andreis emphasized. "It's Stanford's
judgment call."
Had Stanford consulted the bank,
however, it might have made a differ
ent judgment call.
Joe Villamil, Bank of America
manager of Northern California ac
count management, admitted he was
surprised the store did not credit
double-charged customer accounts.
"In all my time [at Bank of Amer
ica). no matter what the si/.e of the
merchant, they would always make
an effort to rectify a past mistake,"
Villamil commented. "They would
have at least done something."
Julia Beeson. a junior who was
double-billed, said she wished the
Bookstore would've taken more re
sponsibility for correcting the error:
"It would've simplified things a lot
more if the Bookstore dealt with
things since that's where the problem
originated."
Minimizing double paybacks
Mendclson added that the time

lag between the mistake's occur
rence and its discovery would make
corrections difficult it not impossible.
But, according to the Bank of Amer
ica officials, measures could have
been taken when the store discov
ered the overbilling, approximately
30 days after it occurred.
By the time cards were credited,
Andreis admitted, some customers
might have already begun charge
back proceedings. Credit card cus
tomers who are over- or double
charged can dispute a transaction
through their individual banks.
However Bank of America could
have taken steps to ensure that cus
tomers were not credited twice. Ac
cording to Andreis, if Bank of Amer
ica officials were notified that certain
customers were credited for the dou
ble-billing, they would monitor
Bookstore chargebacks to try to en
sure that it didn't pay for its mistakes
twice.
"II it's a client of this caliber," said
Andreis, "we'd definitely bend over
backwards to help out."
Both Bank of America officials
said the Bookstore would still risk
double-crediting some customers,
but they said they would recommend
crediting the accounts anyway.
No press release issued
Mendclson further stated the
Bookstore decided not to issue a
press release alerting the Stanford
community to the overbilling, be
cause Bookstore management didn't
want to concern customers.
"Because we were immediately
crediting the accounts of customers
who contacted us. we did not believe
that a press release was neces
sary .... Sometimes il you make an
announcement, it might aggravate
people more than it might help
them," she said.
Assistant District Attorney
Weger, though, characterized the ef
fect of a press release differently.
I le said a Bookstore press release
about the overbilling could have fur
thered confidence in the store by
showing how "conscientious" it was.
Students concurred.

"It's a bit disconcerting that [the
Bookstore] didn't try to tell people
about the mistake, that they had to tig
ure it out on their own," Beeson said.
"It would have been better for the
store to issue a release so that stu
dents could see the overcharging oc
curred." Beyer added. "It would be
negligent for them not to."
Police investigation proposed
Since it failed to take action when
it determined a problem existed, the
Bookstore may face legal conse
quences.
"I can't believe they couldn't call a
credit card company and ask if they
saw double-billing," Wegersaid. "It's
not very good business practice."
Weger initially became aware of the
Bookstore's practices when contact
ed as part of a Daily investigation.
Mendelson claimed she was un
aware of any legal responsibility to
try to fix the overbilling. "We had ab
solutely no intention to violate any
law." she said.
Weger countered that the Book
store should have been aware of its
responsibility to its customers. He
noted that it's not necessarily cus
tomers' duty to fix mischarges.
"Ignorance of the law is no excuse
....It's fine and well to examine
your hill for errors, but if someone il
legally takes your money, and you
don't see it... that's not justification
for a person taking your money. It
could be unfair business practices or
out-and-out theft," Weger said.
"You'd have to look at the details."
Weger continued, "I hope the
Stanford Police Department would
look into this matter and turn in a re
port to the District Attorney's Of
fice."
The police department, according
to Weger. would be the appropriate
investigative agency. He said the at
torney's office would then review a
report issued to it and decide
whether to prosecute.
Stanford Police Department Sgt.
Rick Tipton indicated that he would
take a recommendation to file a re
port seriously and that he was "inter
ested in looking into the matter."

If police launched such an investi
gation, Mendelson said the Book
store would be accommodating.
"If they want to do any inquiry, we
will be most cooperative," she said.
Bookstore could be liable
Weger explained that a store
could be civilly and / or criminally li
able if it discovered mass overbilling
and took no steps to rectify the prob
lem.
If the Bookstore is found guilty,
potential consequences include
restitution, civil damages and an in
junction, among other penalties.
Weger said that severity of
charges, if any are filed, would large
ly depend on how many people failed
to be refunded.
Members of the Bookstore's
Board of Directors could be held
legally and financially liable for any
wrongdoing. "The Bookstore is re
sponsible for its own legal and finan
cial matters," explained Mariann By
erwalter, vice president of business
affairs and chief financial officer.
History Prof. David Kennedy,
chairman of the Bookstore board of
directors, could not be reached for
comment.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt,
nonprofit corporation that is neither
owned nor controlled by Stanford,
though it is overseen by a 14-member
board of directors composed of Stan
ford faculty and staff. Shelly
Heberet, director of business devel
opment, described the Bookstore as
an "independent entity of the Uni
versity."
The board was significantly re
structured earlier this decade when
the Bookstore faced charges of ques
tionable compensation arrange
ments and stock market trading.
Managers ultimately had to pay
$1 million to the store in order to set
tle charges of mismanaged invest
ments made by the California Attor
ney General's office. Criminal
charges against the managers were
dismissed by a Santa Clara County
Municipal Court judge.
After the incident students
stopped serving on the Board of Di

rectors, and a student advisory com
mittee was created last year in order
to re-institutionalize students giving
input to Bookstore management.
Advisory committee members,
though, were not informed of the
September double-billing.
"They certainly never let us know
about the double-billing. We never
even heard a rumor to that effect."
said Jeffrey Wu, a second year law
and business student who serves on
the committee.
Buyout negotiations concluding
Current allegations of financial
wrongdoing come at a stressful time
for Bookstore administrators.
The store's Board of Directors
voted unanimously on March IS to
review buyout proposals from out
side for-profit retailers, and the
Bookstore now has picked its first ne
gotiating partner, according to
Mendelson.
"We're really on a fast track, and
our goal is to have it all completed by
our final board meeting on June 11.
Hopefully that's when the board will

vote on a final contract," Mendelson
said.
Mendelson herself plans to step
down from her position as president
and CEO this summer.
The aim of Bookstore manage
ment. according to Mendelson. is to
have the store ready to be turned
over to new owners at the end of its
1998-99 fiscal year on June 30.
The Bookstore handles approxi
mately 1.4 million transactions per
year, according to Mendelson. And
students, even those double-charged,
doubt that sales volume will drop
rapidly any time soon.
Freshman Nick Kapur, who was
double-charged for his Microsoft
Word purchase, explained that the
Bookstore is his one option: "Since it
is the only store around, I have to use
it."

If you were double-billed, you should
cull the Bookstore's accounting office
in Newark at 510-796-0774, ext.226.
Have your statement on hand so that
you can provide the account number,
the date of the purchase and the trans
action numbers.


Theo Alkousakis — Daily
Stanford Bookstore is an entity separate from the University.
The Stanford Bookstore may face
a legal investigation concerning the

way it handled
the accidental
overbilling of
hundreds of cus
tomers last Sep
tember.
Over a two
or three-day pe
riod in late Sep
tember, the
Bookstore dou
ble-billed many
of its credit-card
paying cus
tomers. The
overbilling was a
result of a com
puter system
error, according
to Peggy Men
delson, president
and CEO of
Stanford Book
store.
To date more
than 4(H) people
who noticed the
overbilling have
been reimbursed

Although
Bookstore
managers
learned of
the error in
November,
they have
made no
effort to
contact
customers,
correcting
only those
mistakes
brought to
them.

a combined total of $32,(XX). But the
actual number of people over
charged may be much higher.
"A lot of people don't look at
their credit cards, [so] they might

only see half of the people [over
charged]." said Santa Clara Assistant
District Attorney A 1 Weger. "It
doesn't sound like they did enough.
We'd want to see an investigation
done."
The Bookstore became aware of
the overcharging a month after it oc
curred, as some customers began to
request refunds. At that point, how
ever. the Bookstore did not notify its
customers of the billing or take steps
to correct it.
A failure to take proactive mea
sures might be grounds for a civil or
criminal lawsuit, according to Weger.
An investigation would come at a
particularly bad time for the Book
store since it is in final buy-out nego
tiations with an outside retailer.
Delay in noticing error
Mendelson said the credit card er
rors took place at the individual cash
registers as customers were making
purchases.
"It was a system error," she said.
"It was not a bank problem; it was
certainly a Bookstore issue."
The error was connected to the
Bookstore's upgrade of its computer
system in September. According to
Mendelson. the new software did not
always notify cashiers that a charge
had been transmitted and verified, so
cashiers would use the old system as
well and accidentally double-charge
some customers in the process.
The double-charges appeared as

two separate, identical transactions
on printed credit card statements.
Customers who noticed the discrep
ancy began to report their findings to
the Bookstore.
Mendelson said it took about 30
days before the Bookstore realized
that overbillings were clustered over
a specific period. She added that the

process was further complicated be
cause not every customer during this
period was overcharged.
As customers came in with com
plaints, the Bookstore reversed the
charges. The reimbursed money
came from the store's daily operating



Matt Soscia — Daily file
revenue.
A total of about 4(X) to 450 cus
tomers came forward to request re
imbursement, most in a 1 S()-day peri
od after the overbilling occurred.
But, because the Bookstore was
relying on customers to inform them
if they had a problem, it is unlikely
that everyone was reimbursed.

lag between the mistake's occur
rence and its discovery would make
corrections difficult it not impossible.
But, according to the Bank of Amer
ica officials, measures could have
been taken when the store discov
ered the overbilling, approximately
30 days after it occurred.
By the time cards were credited,
Andreis admitted, some customers
might have already begun charge
back proceedings. Credit card cus
tomers who are over- or double
charged can dispute a transaction
through their individual banks.
However Bank of America could
have taken steps to ensure that cus
tomers were not credited twice. Ac
cording to Andreis, if Bank of Amer
ica officials were notified that certain
customers were credited for the dou
ble-billing, they would monitor
Bookstore chargebacks to try to en
sure that it didn't pay for its mistakes
twice.
"II it's a client of this caliber," said
Andreis, "we'd definitely bend over
backwards to help out."
Both Bank of America officials
said the Bookstore would still risk
double-crediting some customers,
but they said they would recommend
crediting the accounts anyway.
No press release issued
Mendclson further stated the
Bookstore decided not to issue a
press release alerting the Stanford
community to the overbilling, be
cause Bookstore management didn't
want to concern customers.
"Because we were immediately
crediting the accounts of customers
who contacted us. we did not believe
that a press release was neces
sary .... Sometimes il you make an
announcement, it might aggravate
people more than it might help
them," she said.
Assistant District Attorney
Weger, though, characterized the ef
fect of a press release differently.
I le said a Bookstore press release
about the overbilling could have fur
thered confidence in the store by
showing how "conscientious" it was.
Students concurred.

"It's a bit disconcerting that [the
Bookstore] didn't try to tell people
about the mistake, that they had to tig
ure it out on their own," Beeson said.
"It would have been better for the
store to issue a release so that stu
dents could see the overcharging oc
curred." Beyer added. "It would be
negligent for them not to."
Police investigation proposed
Since it failed to take action when
it determined a problem existed, the
Bookstore may face legal conse
quences.
"I can't believe they couldn't call a
credit card company and ask if they
saw double-billing," Wegersaid. "It's
not very good business practice."
Weger initially became aware of the
Bookstore's practices when contact
ed as part of a Daily investigation.
Mendelson claimed she was un
aware of any legal responsibility to
try to fix the overbilling. "We had ab
solutely no intention to violate any
law." she said.
Weger countered that the Book
store should have been aware of its
responsibility to its customers. He
noted that it's not necessarily cus
tomers' duty to fix mischarges.
"Ignorance of the law is no excuse
....It's fine and well to examine
your hill for errors, but if someone il
legally takes your money, and you
don't see it... that's not justification
for a person taking your money. It
could be unfair business practices or
out-and-out theft," Weger said.
"You'd have to look at the details."
Weger continued, "I hope the
Stanford Police Department would
look into this matter and turn in a re
port to the District Attorney's Of
fice."
The police department, according
to Weger. would be the appropriate
investigative agency. He said the at
torney's office would then review a
report issued to it and decide
whether to prosecute.
Stanford Police Department Sgt.
Rick Tipton indicated that he would
take a recommendation to file a re
port seriously and that he was "inter
ested in looking into the matter."

If police launched such an investi
gation, Mendelson said the Book
store would be accommodating.
"If they want to do any inquiry, we
will be most cooperative," she said.
Bookstore could be liable
Weger explained that a store
could be civilly and / or criminally li
able if it discovered mass overbilling
and took no steps to rectify the prob
lem.
If the Bookstore is found guilty,
potential consequences include
restitution, civil damages and an in
junction, among other penalties.
Weger said that severity of
charges, if any are filed, would large
ly depend on how many people failed
to be refunded.
Members of the Bookstore's
Board of Directors could be held
legally and financially liable for any
wrongdoing. "The Bookstore is re
sponsible for its own legal and finan
cial matters," explained Mariann By
erwalter, vice president of business
affairs and chief financial officer.
History Prof. David Kennedy,
chairman of the Bookstore board of
directors, could not be reached for
comment.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt,
nonprofit corporation that is neither
owned nor controlled by Stanford,
though it is overseen by a 14-member
board of directors composed of Stan
ford faculty and staff. Shelly
Heberet, director of business devel
opment, described the Bookstore as
an "independent entity of the Uni
versity."
The board was significantly re
structured earlier this decade when
the Bookstore faced charges of ques
tionable compensation arrange
ments and stock market trading.
Managers ultimately had to pay
$1 million to the store in order to set
tle charges of mismanaged invest
ments made by the California Attor
ney General's office. Criminal
charges against the managers were
dismissed by a Santa Clara County
Municipal Court judge.
After the incident students
stopped serving on the Board of Di

rectors, and a student advisory com
mittee was created last year in order
to re-institutionalize students giving
input to Bookstore management.
Advisory committee members,
though, were not informed of the
September double-billing.
"They certainly never let us know
about the double-billing. We never
even heard a rumor to that effect."
said Jeffrey Wu, a second year law
and business student who serves on
the committee.
Buyout negotiations concluding
Current allegations of financial
wrongdoing come at a stressful time
for Bookstore administrators.
The store's Board of Directors
voted unanimously on March IS to
review buyout proposals from out
side for-profit retailers, and the
Bookstore now has picked its first ne
gotiating partner, according to
Mendelson.
"We're really on a fast track, and
our goal is to have it all completed by
our final board meeting on June 11.
Hopefully that's when the board will

vote on a final contract," Mendelson
said.
Mendelson herself plans to step
down from her position as president
and CEO this summer.
The aim of Bookstore manage
ment. according to Mendelson. is to
have the store ready to be turned
over to new owners at the end of its
1998-99 fiscal year on June 30.
The Bookstore handles approxi
mately 1.4 million transactions per
year, according to Mendelson. And
students, even those double-charged,
doubt that sales volume will drop
rapidly any time soon.
Freshman Nick Kapur, who was
double-charged for his Microsoft
Word purchase, explained that the
Bookstore is his one option: "Since it
is the only store around, I have to use
it."

If you were double-billed, you should
cull the Bookstore's accounting office
in Newark at 510-796-0774, ext.226.
Have your statement on hand so that
you can provide the account number,
the date of the purchase and the trans
action numbers.
