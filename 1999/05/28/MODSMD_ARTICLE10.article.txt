DRAS, India (AP) â€” Two Indi
an MiG jets crashed yesterday in
Pakistan as warplanes launched
strikes for a second straight day to
force Islamic guerrillas from the
mountainous Kashmir frontier
region.
Pakistan said it shot down both
planes over its territory. However,
India's military said one MiG-21
crashed in Pakistan due to mechan
ical failure, then a MiCi-27 flew to
assist the first pilot, and was shot
down by a surface-to-air missile.
Pakistan said one pilot was
killed and it was holding the other
as a prisoner of war.
The United States. Britain, Rus
sia. China and U.N. Secretary-Gen
eral Kofi Annan urged restraint by
both nations, which have fought
three wars since their indepen
dence from Britain in 11>47.l l >47. two
over Kashmir.
Last year. India and Pakistan
each exploded underground nucle
ar devices and declared themselves
nuclear powers, generating fears of
an arms race on the volatile South
Asian subcontinent.
Pakistan pushed hard yesterday
for international intervention in the
conflict, and a government minister
said "two nuclear-armed adver
saries are facing each other eyeball
to eyeball."
"We hope India will not go
beyond a point of no return," said
Information Minister Mushahid
Hussein.
"If we didn't have the bomb.
India would have occupied Kash
mir by now," he said. " That's what
the bomb means: deterrence for

security, for survival, for self
defense."
Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee convened an
emergency meeting of Cabinet
ministers and military chiefs yester
day, and was to hold a meeting
today of all major political parties
to seek endorsement for the mili
tary action.
India slammed Pakistan for tar
geting its aircraft, saying it was
"shameless" of Islamabad to sug
gest that India had violated peace
agreements between the two
nations.
"The present situation has been
created entirely because of Pak
istan's provocative activities," the
Foreign Office said in a statement.
India launched Operation Vijay,
or Operation Victory, to evict
about 600 guerrillas who seized
unoccupied areas in the Indian
held part of Kashmir early this
month. India says the infiltrators
are Afghan guerrillas and Pakistani
soldiers dressed like militants.
Islamabad says it does not know
the identity of the infiltrators.
India's National Security Advis
er Brajesh Mishra said. "We don't
think the situation will escalate into
a general war."
India and Pakistan went to war
immediately after independence,
when Muslim-majority Kashmir
became part of India, angering
Islamic Pakistan. India now con
trols two-thirds of Kashmir, Pak
istan holds nearly one-third, and
China has a tiny portion. India and
Pakistan each claim Kashmir in its
entiretv.
