Overcharging scandal at
Bookstore adds to history
of poor management

THE ACTIONS OF the Stan
ford Bookstore with regard to
the double-eharging of cus
tomers over two days in September
have been highly unprofessional.
Ciiven its recent history with scan
dals, we would have expected Book
store management to defuse this lat
est aberration with timeliness and
zeal. Their actions have exhibited
neither quality.
As reported on today's front page,
the Bookstore has been aware since
November that students were over
charged during two days hist
September.
Since then, the Bookstore has not
publicized anything that would
encourage students to check their
credit card statements for possible
discrepancies, even after many stu
dents reported the mistake and col
lected their refunds. VVc find this
inexcusable.
In addition, we find the excuses
offered by Bookstore management
unconvincing. Peggy Mendelson, the
Bookstore's C'FiO, said, "Sometimes
if you make an announcement it
might aggravate people more than it
might help them."
However, knowing you have been
charged double for a potentially
major purchase seems far less aggra

vating than not knowing an error
occurred.
Looking hack on the Bookstore's
recent history with money, we can
not help assuming that if students
had been undercharged for their
purchases, the time it would have
taken to call attention to and correct
the mistake would have been
tremendously expedited.
We encourage the County of
Santa Clara to proceed with an
investigation into the Bookstore's
actions. The fact that the Bookstore
has waited over six months to take
steps to rectify its error should not
prevent all affected students from
collecting the refunds that are right
ful Iv theirs.
We implore the management to
put aside the issue of the pending
buyout of the Bookstore to a for
profit firm (or at least as long as it
takes to be absolutely certain that
everyone who was double-charged
receives adequate compensation.
Finally, we urge students to make
their voices heard in this matter. As
its primary customers, demanding
that llie Bookstore pay back all the
students it has overcharged may
have a serious positive impact on the
refund process, which has already
lasted too many months.
In light of its recent treatment of
students, even the most anti-corpo
rate Stanford students may be glad
that the Bookstore is changing its
management.
