New plan to restrict
freshmen parking is
positive first step

THOUGH THE recently
announced decision to pro
hibit freshmen from bringing
cars to campus may at first seem
unfair and perhaps unnecessary, il is
a positive first step toward getting
this campus less car-dependent.
The parking crunch on campus
has grown in recent years, especially
with the construction of Schwab
Residential Center and Lyman Hall
without the addition of new parking
adjacent to the residences. To com
pound difficulties, both buildings
were erected on land that formerly
contained parking space.
Though a seemingly simple solu
tion to the parking problem would
be just to create additional spaces on
new land, this would also mean that
students would have a lengthy trek
from car to residence.
The solution offered by the Uni
versity would restrict freshmen from
having cars on campus while simul
taneously increasing transportation
services.
Granted, Stanford is situated in
suburban northern California, an
area with a culture that promotes
the necessity of cars.
But the University's plan could

put into motion a gradual shift away
from this li;iv Area car culture.
Freshmen who realize they can
survive on campus without cars may
go on to become upperclassmen
vithout cars, further alleviating the
parking crunch.
Ihe new services to be provided
including extended Marguerite
service, car and van rentals — could
also be utilized by upperclassmen
without cars.
But the unilateral banning of cars
for freshmen is a drastic move and
the University should proceed with
caution.
There is a chance that the effects
on the availability of parking spaces
could be minimal. Especially in lots
on the Row and around Governor's
Corner, where few freshmen reside,
the changed parking policy may not
be felt.
Additionally, the increased shut
tle services may not serve the needs
of students. Downtown Palo Alto
lacks many things, including a the
ater that shows multiple current
releases. Freshmen who depend on
their friends for rides to the airport
will not find an alternative in the
Marguerite.
Thus, the effectiveness of the new
measures should be monitored
closely, and il widespread student
dissatisfaction exists after two years,
the University should consider
repealing the measure.
