Room and rode on to the Coffee House to
stoke the cerebral lire with caffeine, brighter
lights and smiling folks.
I am waiting in line in the CoHo. From
behind and 011 my neck, I feel thin, dry, jerky
breath. It is unfamiliar. I turn around and see
a slumped over, tank top-wearing, capri
panted, ruminating young woman, who
appears totally unaware that her lips are
touching my collar.
1 remember that 1 haven't showered since
Tuesday. The encroaching voung woman,
whose teeth are clenched. I can tell, from the
angled bulges on the sides of her face, just
doesn't seem to think anything's amiss and is
staring quite blankly into empty space.
She appears to be suffering from some
sort of psychic carpal tunnel syndrome, agi
tated and broken from grinding through the
same thoughts too many times, as if she had
been adjudicating her own tenure hearing
tor the last 2 l > hours. She looks engrossed in
thought but not contemplative. She is oblivi
ous.
My friend looks over and whispers to me.
"Damn, look how bad she's got it. I don't
think she knows where she is. Does anybody
realize what an epidemic Lingosis has
become 011 this campus?
"Look, every 50 minutes, somebody at
Stanford falls out of life, for who knows how
long, and into a state of Lingosis. This girl

hasn't stopped trying to figure out how her
interview with Snit & Company went since
she had it — 16 hours ago.
"She's saving a lot of words, but they just
don't have anything to do with the stuff that's
around her. No matter where she is. rolling
out sentences, silently, to herself, in a futile
attempt to figure out what Mr. Suit thought
of her. In Lingosis, every utterance is
detached from the sensory landscape that
surrounds its speaker. Look at them, all
these automata talking to themselves. They
don't even know where they are.
"These folks just have too much faith in
reason. I guess you could say that Logocen
trism makes you extremely susceptible to a
nasty case of Lingosis. If you care about your
career — and who doesn't — and you
believe that hours of rational deliberation
will lead you to a good choice there, then you
are going to lose days to awkward struggle in
detached language spaces. Better to drop the
words and heed the pull of your gut.
"We are the people who manage to be so
terrifically in the zone on the dance floor, in
the chemistry lab and 011 the basketball
court. How come we get lost in our heads
everywhere else? Maybe we simply mistak
enly believe that 'thinking it through' is going
to help us more than it really will?"
What could I say? Maybe this: the slack
jawed. glassy-eyed woman isn't to blame for
being lost in words that lack relevance to
anything or anybody around her. Instead,
perhaps, she has been forcibly overcome by
an angry language.
Each of us runs an academic sweat shop
in our heads, for which words are the exploit
ed labor. We argue for particular courses of
actions with words. We reason and discover

answers with words. We formulate with
words.
We exploit words for our utilitarian pur
poses.
Now the words are pissed.
Language, invented by man as his first
and greatest technological triumph, has got
ten tired of always being put to work for the
solving of problems. As retribution, the
words will take you over and detach you. We
force the words to work, but we don't let
them play. We use words to optimize plans,
to organize, to build solutions. It's time for a
change.
We need to let them brighten our friends.
We need to let them make things new.
We need to let them make us laugh.
Why has the pleasure of language disap
peared? Why is it no longer common to
speak words whose content serves the mira
cle of one's immediate surroundings? Where
are those who would rather speak an impro
vised rhyme to an acquaintance than squan
der the gilt of language by hashing through
an argument with their advisor for the 19th
time? Where are the folks who talk about
stuff you can see or touch? Must all words
serve some distant end?
It is time to play.
Let the words out for recess.
