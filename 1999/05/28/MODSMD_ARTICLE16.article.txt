Compromising die Freiheit
As a regular reader of The Daily
online, I was appalled at the article in
Wednesday's edition where the Associate
Vice Provost for Facilities Chris Christof
ferson stated that it was "time to bite the
bullet" and not allow freshmen to be able
to park cars on campus.
I suspect it was the administration for
years and years who could not "bite the
bullet" and provide adequate parking
facilities for the increasing size of each
freshman class and for the many new
housing facilities that were being built.
1 seem to recall that as a freshman in
l%() there were thousands of acres of
unused land on campus.
I cannot believe those acres have all
been used up so that our new freshman
classes cannot even have space enough to
park their cars.
If Stanford is really committed to "let
the winds of freedom blow." are we ready
to tell incoming freshmen that they cannot
have a car on campus that will let them
seek the freedom of a weekend in San
Francisco, to explore our wonderful Pacif
ic Coastline, to drive through the grandeur
of the Sierras, to volunteer at an AIDS
support service in San Jose, to continue.a
job as an organist at a local church or just
to get away for a "mental health break"?
1 hope we never take away such free
doms!

Frosh should be driving
Part of the attraction of Stanford for
many on the West Coast is that, well, it's
close. By car, it's 40 minutes from San
Francisco, an hour from Berkeley and six
hours from Los Angeles. In short, Stan
ford is able to attract many line students
from California because they can drive
cheaply to and from wherever it is that
they are from, without having to deal with
airplanes, airport shuttles and Hare Krish
nas. By not allowing freshmen to have cars
on campus, Stanford necessarily becomes
a much less attractive school for those who
factor in ready access to their cars in
choosing a place of higher education. This
ban on freshman cars is not simply dis
crimination but. from the view of a man
who cares deeply about his University's
rank in U.S. News, totally wrongheaded.
I agree there is a parking problem on
campus, but if we must single out a group
of people's parking privileges to revoke, it
makes much more sense to target sopho
mores. There are a lot more sophomores
with cars than freshmen: by the time they
are sophomores they are probably already
dating an upperclassman and don't need a
car anyway: after their first year they
should be acquainted with the Mar
guerite's byzantine schedule; and by their
second year, students are locked in to
Stanford; it's very difficult to transfer
schools after investing a full year.
