# Bringing it all back home
## Mark Silver Finding happiness and telling it like it is 
### 
THIS IS THE end, my beautiful
friends. After weeks of whipping out
these crazy ramblings from the
smoke rings of my mind, it all comes down
to one last hurrah. 1 could tell you that I
hope you've learned something, that you've
thought about Stanford in a different way. I
could tell you that I hope you've laughed a
little or that you've been touched in some
way.
But I'd rather just talk about myself. It's
always more fun.
Earlier this year I was feeling pretty
down. A depression, albeit a mild one, had
infected my happy, well-adjusted soul. Stem
ming from a variety of reasons, the basic
diagnosis was that I knew I wasn't happy
here at Stanfordland.
Being a man of action, I called Cowell to
.schedule an appointment with a counselor to
try to hash things out. I was promptly pen
ciled in for three weeks later (gotta love
socialist medicine) and showed up to meet
with my paid professional friend.
The session went well, and I got a lot out
of it. But the gist of the counselor's advice

was relatively simple. To start moving on a
path toward happiness, I needed to do two
things. First, 1 had to stop drinking (funny
how a depressant might actually result in
depression). Unfortunately, like all Stanford
students, I was too much of a lush to have
any success in achieving this goal. Hell, they
say that alcoholics are always alcoholics.
The second piece of advice given to me
was to write. The counselor told me to keep
a journal, a private notebook filled with ran
dom thoughts and feelings that I should
keep completely to myself.
I've had some experience with serious
journal-writing (real men don't keep diaries)
before, when I was a wee junior high school
kid. Most of the entries sounded the same:
"Kelly sat next to me in homeroom today.
She is so hot. 1 got to work with Megan in
math for the whole period. She is so hot.
Sara told me I have funny ears. She is so hot.
What a good day." I was deep, man, deep.
But I plunged ahead anyway, hoping I
had matured somewhat since that glorious
era. I wrote faithfully for a while, but I had a
major problem. I didn't want to keep the

journal to myself. I wanted to share what 1
wrote with everyone, to let others in to see
for themselves what kind of crazy thoughts
were going on inside my head. I didn't like
writing just for my own catharsis. 1 wanted to
let everyone else know about it too.
Then a bolt of lightning (very, very fright
ening) struck, jarring me to my senses. The
answer was right there in front of me, in the
newspaper blowing in the wind. I immedi
ately applied for a Daily column. Fortune
smiled gently upon me, and I was accepted.
I faced a choice right from the start. 1
could have chosen to write about all of my
political and ideological beliefs, injecting my
own pseudo-intellectualism into trite pieces
about current issues and events. But this
would have been pure mental masturbation.
What good would it have done to tell you I
strongly oppose the death penalty? Or that 1
believe affirmative action is still very neces
sary? Do any of you really care about those
things?
Instead, with a few exceptions, I decided
to go a different route. I wanted to make this
column my own personal weekly journal.

written for the thousands (or maybe a tew
do/en) of Daily readers to peruse, disseet,
mock, rage against or smile at. Every week 1
got to talk about whatever I wanted, and
every week a whole bunch of people would
listen.
This was paradise for me, because one of
the major sources of my unhappiness was
my seeming inability to connect with people
at Stanford. By writing for an audience, 1
could let it all out, and maybe someone
would understand.
So has anything changed since 1 began
this long, strange trip? Well. I still have the
same few good friends I had before. Am I
more popular? Not really. Do 1 have more
sex appeal? Most likely.
But here's one major difference: 1 haven't
been this happy in a long, long time. More
than anything else at Stanford, this column
has been my passion.
Every week I got to combine two of my
favorite activities: talking and writing. Every
week I got some kind of response: e-mails,
slaps on the back, dirty looks. Every week 1
couldn't wait to let the words (low.

And I have made some new connections,
mental and physical and emotional connec
tions that I didn't think were possible for me
here at Stanford. None of these connections
would have been possible if I hadn't been
allowed to do something that I love.
I'm not saying that everything is perfect
or that 1 am now in love with Stanford. I still
think there's a lot that could be improved
about this place, and I'll keep pointing out
those failings.
But I am happy. And to be happy, all that
you need is to find something that you're
really into and milk it for all it's worth.
Thanks for listening.
And since good-bye is too good a word,
gal, I'll just say. as Winnie Cooper once
