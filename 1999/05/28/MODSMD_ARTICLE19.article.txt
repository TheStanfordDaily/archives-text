## Stanford looks to ravage Loyola to open NCAA Tourney Cardinal wants revenge on Lions after last year's suprising upset loss 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Last year Stanford roared through the regular sea
son like the king of the college baseball jungle, intimi
dating pretenders to the throne with displays of talent
and experience.
Come postseason, the Cardinal had become a meek

little lamb. In the first game of the six-team regional,
the Lions of Loyola Marymount preyed on Stanford,
beating the top-seeded Cardinal and National Pitcher
of the Year Jeff Austin 6-2.
In the last two months of this season. No. 3 Stanford
has proven it is near the head of the pack, winning 15
of its final 16 games. Hut, in what seems to be a defin
ing moment in this team's effort to rise above last sea

son's first-round collapse, the Cardinal must again face
off with the Lions to open the NCAA tournament.
"I don't think this team is better than last year's,"
said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. But, this
team is playing better than last year's was at this time
and that's really important now."
What's more, he said, "we have enough guys who
were around last year, so we won't be overconfident. 1
won't have to say anything about not looking past Loy
ola."
Tonight's game with the Lions at Sunken Diamond
will have a much different feel from last year's contest
and, the Cardinal hopes, a much different result.

■ Tonight: N0.3 Stanford (43-13) vs. Loyola Marymount
(33-26), 7 p.m.. Sunken Diamond. RADIO: KZSU (90.1
FM).

Austin was picked in the first round of the 1998 am
ateur draft leaving sophomore Jason Young as Stan
ford's staff ace. Loyola's Michael Schultz, who beat
Stanford last year as a freshman, has now taken a back
seat to the Lions' new pitching star, left-hander Billy
Traber.
Schultz, a 6-foot-7 right-hander, has not really
struggled this season; he is 7-5 with a 5.26 ERA after
recording a complete game victory to beat Pepperdine
and win the West Coast Conference tournament Sat
urday. However, Traber has been exceptional.
The all-WCC selection is 8-5 with a 3.95 ERA and
132 strikeouts in just over 116 innings on the mound.
Though Young has turned in a few inconsistent per
formances of late, the all-Pacific 10 Conference pitch
er is no slouch either. The tall right-hander is 9-3 with
a 3.46 ERA and 144 strikeouts in just under 120 in
nings.
Though the Lions are not an overpowering offen
sive team, they do cause problems on the basepaths.
Junior center fielder Matt Riordan and sophomore
catcher Scott Walter lead the squad with 21 and 12
stolen bases, respectively.
If Loyola were able to wreak havoc on the bases, it
would be one of the first teams to do so. Opponents
have only stolen 31 bases on the Cardinal all year.
The first round is bigger than just one game, though.
Nevada, the regional's No. 2 seed, and North Carolina,
seeded second, will square off in the regional's first
game at 3 p.m.
Nevada has been successful at Sunken Diamond,
beating Stanford 7-4 in February, but has never taken
on the Tarheels.
The Wolf Pack, which is hitting .333 as a team, is led

by the stellar overall play of senior Lyle Overbay and
the prodigious power of junior Don Priee.
Overbay, already named to a few Ail-American
teams, is hitting .427 with 15 home runs and 86 RBIs.
The right fielder is the Nevada and Big West Confer
ence career leader in hits, runs and RBIs.
Price, whose .363 average professes that he can hit
for average, is more known for his power. At one point
in mid-season, the first baseman had hit 16 home runs
in 15 games. Now Price has 27 home runs, a conference
record for left-handed batters.
However, the Pack's offensive attack will be tested
by one of the best pitching staffs in the nation. UNC is
allowing opposing batters to hit only .250 and is giving
up only 3.81 runs a game.
Mike Bynum will probably take the mound first for
the Tarheels. The junior left-hander is 7-1 with a 3.81
ERA.
If Bynum falters, UNC head coach Mike Fox will
probably not be hesitant to take him out in favor of any
of the team's strong relievers. Junior right-hander
Derrick DePriest has a stellar 1.85 ERA after 34 ap
pearances.
Whoever Carolina faces tomorrow will probably
have the opportunity to face Kyle Snyder, who Base
ball America named the top pitching prospect in col
lege baseball before the season. Snyder, a 6-foot-8 ju
nior who is 7-5 with a 4.04 ERA, is projected as high as
the second pick in next week's amateur draft.

'I don't think this team is better than last
year's. But, this team is playing better than
last year's was at this time and that's really
important right now. We have enough guys
who were around last year, so we won't be
overconfident.'
—Mark Marquess

Regardless of who Stanford has to face this week
end, it will simply try to concentrate on playing the
team across the field, not on replaying 1998.
Because as the Cardinal learned last year, in the
postseason it's not who storms onto the scene with
sound and fury that matters — it's who leaves the party
crowned the king that's important.
"It's do or die at this point," said sophomore right
fielder Joe Borchard. "We just want to play our best
game every day, and even if we don't, we just want to
find a way to win."

Junior catcher Damien Alvarado takes a thunderous cut in a game earlier this season. Alvardo and Stan
ford look to settle the score with Loyola Marymount, who ended their playoff hopes last year.
