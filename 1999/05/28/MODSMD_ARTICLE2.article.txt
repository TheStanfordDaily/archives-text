# Campus sees decrease in crime
## Report shows levels of all types of illegal activities are down 
### Anthony Chin Contributing writer 
Crimes of almost all types decreased on campus
last year, according to the Stanford Police Depart
ment's Annual Crime Report.
The report showed fewer total arrests as well as
fewer incidents of burglaries, theft and driving
under the influence of alcohol.
While positive about the statistics, Stanford Po

lice Chief Marvin Herrington cautioned that one
year's numbers don't tell the whole story. "Our ef
forts have paid off to some degree, but 1 know these
numbers go up and down."
Last year, burglary and theft of all types de
creased. Reports of structural burglaries decreased
from 202 to 177, while motor vehicle thefts de
creased from 35 to 28.
Bike thefts decreased for the filth straight year,
from 319 to 301. As recently as 1993, t here were 829
bikes stolen on campus in one year. I lerrington at
tributes the decrease to a combination of two po
lice actions.
"When we see a pattern, we've focused efforts,
set up surveillance and caught some people." I ler
rington said. " The other tiling that has probably

yielded more results is... moving the hike racks so
it's not as easy to he around the hikes without heing
seen."
Incidents of theft from vehicles also decreased
from 127 to 79. "What I think has happened
there is that we were successful in catching a couple
groups that were stealing from us." said Herring
ton. " Three or four people would come in and sys
tematically go through a parking lot and hit us for
stereos and other items."
1 lowcver. the numbers for violent crime in
creased slightly. The number of robberies in
creased from one to three and aggravated assaults
increased from two to four.
In addition, the number of
forcible sex offenses increased from
14 to 22. This number includes all of
fenses, whether reported to police,
University counselors or resident as
sistants. In cases where the victim
does not wish to press charges, police
are given statistics but no details of
the incident.
Although the number of arrests
for liquor law and drug violations ap
pear to have changed dramatically,
police downplayed their importance.
In one of the only major increases

included in the report, arrests for
liquor law violations went up for the
sixth straight year, but Herrington
said the majority of these cases are
simply minor-in-possession citations.
Herrington also considered the
change in drug violations to be in
significant.
"When you go from 33 to 17 —
it's a blip. If there were S(X) cases and
we cut that in half, that would be im
portant."
Herrington cautioned against
being lulled into a false sense of secu
rity. "Our community is relatively
safe, but we're like any other place in
society and we hope people will take
the normal precautions."
