# Women's throwers throw their hopes onto the field
## Pierson, Beatty and Onyeagbako strive for national respect and NCAA meet

In most sports, to be great a team must at
tack competition on both offense and de
fense.
In collegiate track and field, there is no
such thing as defense, hut, a balanced attack is
equally as important. Being strong only in the
sprints or distance events won't get you very
far.
While Stanford head track and field coach
Vin Lananna knows this, when he arrived on
The Farm in 1992 it appeared that he was
strictly building up the distance crew of the
woman's team.
That changed with one quick move; the
hiring of throws coach Robert Weir in 1994.
"After hiring Robert, 1 knew that any kids
that we had that were gixxl throwers would
get what they needed in order to perform,"
Lananna said. "It's not fair to bring an athlete
in when you don't have someone to develop

them to be as good as they can possibly be."
Lananna thought Weir, a two-time
Olympian from Great Britain, would be the
perfect fit to jumpstart a program that had
produced an athlete for every ()lympiad since
1980.
Next, Lananna and Weir brought in the
talent — a tremendous recruiting class in 19%
that included Summer Pierson, Allison Beat
ty, Cassie Romuld and Maggie Isaac along
with walk-on Maureen Onyeagbako.
"It was a phenomenal recruiting year and
we've been kind of waiting for it to click and I
think that it is now clicking," Lananna said.
With Pierson making her third straight
NCAA appearance in the discus next week in
Boise. Idaho, and Beatty and Onyeagbako
nervously awaiting word from the NCAA as
to whether they made the field in the javelin
and hammer throw, respectively,"clicking"
may be an understatement.
"What we've had in our throwing core is a
good base of student-athletes who have come

together well. There is a nice sense of com
munity among our throwers," Lananna said.
"A great deal of the credit goes to the person
who organizes and directs that part of our
program — Robert."
All three potential NCAA qualifiers agree
two factors have led to their success; a sup
portive environment and knowledgeable
coach.
For Onyeagbako, known by her team
mates as ( Tii-Chi, her relationship with Weir
has brought her beyond her own expecta
tions. While a high school standout and shot
put state champion in her home state of Neva
da. Onyeagbako wasn't familiar with the re
cruiting process. By the time she was in touch
with the coaching staff, all scholarship spots
had been filled, so she decided to walk on.
I Jpon her arrival, coach Weir watched her
perform some basic drills. Based on her
movement and technique, he could see that
she was a good candidate to throw the ham
mer. an event not contested in women's high

school athletics.
"What happened was during the time that
she walked on to the track team, just from a
work ethic, an attitude, and from the things
that I asked her to do, it just started to make
sense that this was an event that she could do
well in," Weir said.
Learning a new event was a challenge that
Onyeagbako embraced, as she had no bad
habits to unlearn. Her improvement has been
the most dramatic among the throwers, with
her 190-foot toss setting a new school record
and earning her third-place at last week's Pa
cific 10 Conference championships. Her best
last year was only 160 feet.
While Onyeagbako has reached the cusp
of the national scene in her new event. Beat
ty, the second-place finisher in the javelin last
week with a personal-best throw of 156 feet,
got her start while still in junior high.
"My junior high soccer coach was a hep
tahlete in college," Beatty said. "She told my
mom that 'they give pretty good scholarships

for the javelin and Allison has a pretty good
arm.' My mom heard that and was like,
'Scholarship! Allison do javelin.' But I really
didn't want to because I always played soft
ball."
Alter she won her regional championships
in ninth grade without much practice, her de
cision to quit Softball was made. The next big
decision came when she chose Stanford. That
too was not hard as her basketball teammate
at Mead High School in Washington, Regan
Freuen, a forward on Stanford's team, en
couraged her to commit.
Both Beatty and Pierson, who hails from
upstate New York, had to deal with the prob
lems of bad habits and improper technique in
their events during their freshman years.
While Beatty's progression was gradual, Pier
son had a big freshman year.
Unfortunately, a big first year left Pierson
struggling to improve in her sophomore year.
"Last year in general was just the
most traumatic year for me," Pierson
said. "Every once in a while you just
have a year where nothing seems to
function right. You have to really
step back from it, which is what I did

over the summer. I sorl of repriori
tized."
Weir said that although her dis
tance wasn't improving, Pierson be
came much more consistent in her
sophomore year. Their goal for this
year was keep that level of consisten
cy and work on her strength and a few
technical aspects.
With Pierson's trying season last

year, she squeaked her way into the
NCAA field as the second-to-last
entrant allowed in. She can certain
ly feel Beatty's and Onyeagbako's
anxiousness — another bonding
factor between these three friends,
as if being in the weight room to
gether for hours on end wasn't
enough.
Regardless if all three athletes

compete in Boise or not, Stanford
throwers have come a long way to
complement its already impressive
distance squad.
"Maybe we're not the UCLA cal
iber, but with what we have to work
with, I'm definitely proud," Beatty
said. "That's part of what wants me to
do well — to better the name of Stan
ford throwing."


Joaquim Marlins — Daily
Junior throwers Summer Pierson, Allison Beatty and Maureen Onyeagbako are ready for the NCAA competition, hopeully together. Although
Pierson is the only one of the trio to qualify so far, Beatty and Onyeagbako are strong candidates to also make the national meet.
