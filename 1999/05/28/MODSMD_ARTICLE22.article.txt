# The 						answer lies outside Maples Pavilion's doors

Well, the buzz is already starl
ing. You say "Sixth Man" and
ears across campus perk up.
Everyone has an opinion: Big
freshman dorms have too much of
an advantage. Prior Sixth Man
members should get some sort of
priority. Upperclassmen should get
some sort of priority. Graduate stu
dents need to be represented.
Everyone should have the same
shot. A lottery is unfair. A campout
is unfair. I'd like to pass my classes.
Classes mean nothing to me. I hate
sleeping on concrete. I love sleeping
on concrete —it beats the hell out of
Lag. The Schmegs must be stopped
or else they'll start camping out be
fore the freshman arrive for Orien
tation. I will do whatever I have to
do to get a ticket and 1 swear to God
Almighty that if you gel in my way
YOU WILL PAY!!
Ah, civility.

You want my opinion? (This
question is purely rhetorical. You're
getting it no matter what you say.)
Stop complaining. Please. Stan
ford students have done enough to
redefine the term fair-weather fan.
Creating another frenzied atmos
phere just so we can get a group of
people who won't show up for Stan
ford-Washington State will just
make us look worse.
If I had any say, first shot at Sixth
Man shirts would go to those who
show up for all football games. Now
that's dedication.
Life isn't easy. So everyone
wants a ticket into Maples? It's time
for some character-building.
My proposal is simple:
•Students form "ticket groups"
of up to eight or 10 people.
• Ticket groups must register on
line by a certain deadline.
• The basketball office runs a
Housing Draw-type lottery. Your
number indicates your spot in line.
• The start day for camping is five
or seven days before ticket sales.
Once again, the exact number of
days is left to the discretion of the
basketball office.
• Each group needs one or two
representatives present in line at all
times. The basketball office can pick
the number.

• You don't have the minimum
number of people present when
checks are made throughout the
day? Go to the end of the line. You
had a midterm and no one in your
group could cover? Bummer, move
it. You were on fire and had to put
yourself out? Sorry to hear that,
start walking.
• The box office opens, people
buy tickets.
Yes, it may be unfair that your
ticket group got a number that
wouldn't get you into a SLE dorm in
the Draw, but that's life. This way,
everyone has a shot, you have to
prove yourself a little and the Uni
versity still gets the prestige of mak
ing you camp out for it.
But wait, you say. I've been a
Sixth Man member three years run
ning, I'm a senior and 1 deserve a
better shot at the bleachers.
Forget it. Just because you were
lucky enough last year to live in the
right dorm doesn't mean squat now.
It's a whole new year, we start fresh.
Honestly, no system will ever
work well enough for the basketball
office, and it's all our fault. We're
too fickle. It's not that we want to
have our cake and eat it too, it's that
we only want the edge pieces, the re
ally good ones with all the frosting.
You think you're die-hard be
cause you heckled Khalid El-
Amin's weight? Talk to me about
Blake Pengelly and then you're on
the right track.
I've lived and breathed Stanford
sports, especially basketball. But
I've never had season tickets. I was
so uninformed as a freshman I
missed my shot. The past two sea
sons I was covering the team for the
Daily, so I was lucky and had a seat
reserved. Next year I'm running this
paper, so I'm out of luck.
But if I was lucky enough to have
a chance at getting tickets, this is the
only fair and sensible way I can fig
ure going about it.
And before anyone goes on
about how losing a week in line will
take our focus away from acade
mics, all I can say is that the campout
is the best example of supply and de
mand that I've ever witnessed.
But more importantly, it shows
heart. It shows that we really care.
That's something that needs to be
carried throughout the season. A
Sixth Man shirt isn't supposed to be
a status symbol. It means you show
up, scream loud and never let up.
Otherwise, sell me your ticket.
I'm desperate.
