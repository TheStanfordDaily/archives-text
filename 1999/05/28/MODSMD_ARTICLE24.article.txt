# Fac Sen discusses salary differences
## 
### kimberly Downs Staff writer 
A recent report on faculty salary
issues at Stanford was the center of
discussion at yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting.
The report, a result of a compre
hensive two-year study conducted by
a faculty committee appointed by
Provost Condoleezza Rice, found no
systematic differences between the
salaries of male and female faculty in
most University areas and only small
differences in the remaining few.
It also found that in the 1980s and
1990s there has been no meaningful
difference between salary increases
granted to male and female faculty.
When salary differences do exist,
they result from male faculty mem
bers beginning at Stanford with
slightly higher salaries.
The study looked for variances in
salary between men and women by
school or cluster.
The committee found that there
was no pattern of salary differences
favoring either men or women in the
schools of business, earth sciences,
engineering and law and in the natur
al sciences cluster.
In social sciences, education and
medicine, there exists a salary differ
ential in favor of men between 1 and
2 percent.
These differentials, however,
have been declining in recent years.
At the Medical School, for instance,
new compensation systems and other
institutional changes have impacted
faculty salaries.
In the humanities, men are slight
ly over-represented in the upper
quintile in a few departments. As a
result of these large salary differen
tials, a 4- to 5-percent difference in
favor of men exists.
Committee members were given
access to payroll records from 1981 to
the present to conduct their study.
Information available to the com

mittee to account for salary differ
ences consisted of faculty members'
ranks at the time of hire, current
ranks, years at Stanford, years since
highest degree, years in rank,
whether individuals were on nine- or
12-month contracts and, in some
cases, the number of research cita
tions the individual had received.
The committee, chaired by Law
Prof. Robert Weisberg, noted that
the observed salary differences may
be attributed to information the
members did not compile and review
such as faculty members' research
records, teaching records, contribu
tions to University governance, leave
histories and competitive circum
stances surrounding individuals at
the time of hire.
"The observed variables, such as
years at Stanford, remove about 77
percent of the variance in faculty
salaries, leaving 23 percent of the
variance unaccounted for by the vari
ables," said committee member and
Economics Prof. John Pencavel.
"Because such critical informa
tion relevant to accounting for varia
tions in salaries is omitted, any salary
differences between men and
women we find could be attributed to
the influence of these omitted fac
tors," Pencavel said.
Rice said she was asking deans to
look at those faculty members who
fall in the lowest quintile of the facul
ty salary distributions in their schools
to see if there are reasonable expla
nations for why the individual faculty
members fall into that category.
"If cases are found of faculty,
whether men or women, whose
placement in the lowest quintile is
not related to their records of re
search, teaching and governance
work, their salaries will be adjusted,"
Rice said.
The senate also voted unanimous
ly to give the newly formed master's
program in Financial Mathematics
degree-granting authority.
