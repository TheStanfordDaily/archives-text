More details have been released
about the Stanford post office reno
vation that is scheduled to begin
next fall and continue for nine to 12
months.
"We see this [renovation] as a
significant investment in the facility
and representative of a desire on

the part of postal officials lor signif
icant improvements in the quality
of retail service," said Chris
Christofferson, associate vice
provost for facilities.
Although the cost of the renova
tion is unknown, the U.S. Postal
Service will pay for the interior re
modeling. The Stanford Manage
ment Company, the group that
leases the building to the postal ser
vice. may also fund some structural
work.
During the renovation, mailbox
es and parcel pick-up will be moved
to modular trailers at Levin field
next to Florence Moore Hall, and
retail sales will be located in a mod
ule in the parking lot behind Old
Union.
"The post office renovation is an
excellent thing," said Mike Levin,
