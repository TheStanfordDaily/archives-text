### Shannon M. Ashford 
More details have been released
about the Stanford post office reno
vation that is scheduled to begin
next fall and continue for nine to 12
months.
"We see this [renovation] as a
significant investment in the facility
and representative of a desire on

the part of postal officials lor signif
icant improvements in the quality
of retail service," said Chris
Christofferson, associate vice
provost for facilities.
Although the cost of the renova
tion is unknown, the U.S. Postal
Service will pay for the interior re
modeling. The Stanford Manage
ment Company, the group that
leases the building to the postal ser
vice. may also fund some structural
work.
During the renovation, mailbox
es and parcel pick-up will be moved
to modular trailers at Levin field
next to Florence Moore Hall, and
retail sales will be located in a mod
ule in the parking lot behind Old
Union.
"The post office renovation is an
excellent thing," said Mike Levin,

The Stanford post office will begin renovations in
the fall; while closed for repairs post office boxes
will be moved to trailers near Florence Moore Hall.

ASSU president. "The ASSIJ
pushed for the new post office to
look nice and for both the quality of
service and the time it takes to be
served to improve."
The post office will move the
staging of mail to be delivered out
of the Stanford post office and back
to the main office near Bayshore
Expressway. This move will allow
for the expansion of retail sales.
The new facility will include ad
ditional vending machines and pos
sibly a retail sales counter in addi
tion to the traditional service line.

"The intent of the renovation is
to streamline the postal operation,
to free up traffic and to make post
office box operations run more
smoothly." said Levin.
The current building will be re
occupied by the postal service at
the conclusion of the renovation
project and will include the return
of the post office boxes relocated
during renovation.
"This is a simple expansion
which will result in a much im
proved look and feel to the retail
space. The University sees this as a
very positive move on the part of
the post office and is supportive of
these changes," Christofferson
said.
