# A 						new Joss at the gsb
## Former banker takes Business School helm 
### Evan Nordby Editorial Staff 
Robert Joss's new post as
Dean of the Graduate School of
Business might seem like an op
portunity to kick back.
Joss leaves the competitive
international corporate world to
take the helm of what is already
arguably the top business school
in the world, made up of elite
faculty and students and located
in the geographic and spiritual
heart of the late-20th century's
high-tech revolution.
It is also a homecoming for

Joss. He
earned his
master's and
doctoral de
grees at the
Business
School and
has served on
lhi> vrhnnTs

advisory board. The former
Wells Fargo executive also kept
a home in Los Altos I lilis during
the six years he lived in Australia
as CEO of Australia's oldest
bank. Westpac.
Could this be the perfect va
cation?
Hardly.
"With the increasing global
ization of business." said Joss in
a recent interview, business edu


Joss
cation also has to take a "totally
global perspective."
"We have to stay abreast of rapid
technological change," he said. "We
live in an information-based soci
ety."

Joss inherits an institution in the
best of health from outgoing dean
Michael Spence. But even with the
current preeminence of the Busi
ness School, students and faculty
are looking at a number of specific
questions that will have to be an
swered by the school in the near fu
ture.
Over the next few years. Joss will

confront the issues of expanding the
Business School's student body, the
relationship between practical in
struction and theoretical research in
business education, and the school's
relationship with the global business
world. Business School students and
faculty also anticipate an evaluation
of how the school relates to the
whole of Stanford, especially on is

sues such as student and faculty
housing and the hiring of female
and minority faculty.
Assoc. Business Prof. Mary
Barth, a member of the committee
that hired Joss, said the school must
"figure out how to do what we do
now really well, even better."
Should the Business School grow?

Stanford's Business School is
very small by the standards of elite
business schools, with roughly 360
MBA and KM) doctoral candidates
per class. Harvard has three times
that many, according to Barth.
While growth would provide
economies of scale in administra
tion and teaching loads, she said,
"The smallness of the school is an

advantage."
First-year MBA student Michael
Johnson echoed her statement.
Too much expansion would
"ruin a lot of the good things Stan
ford Business School has to offer —
[its] team-oriented, risk-taking,
friendly environment," he said.
"It would be difficult to get it
right." he added.
In Barth's opinion, the school
could grow and become more effi
cient without sacrificing its support
ive environment.
Barth and Johnson both also
mentioned the importance of main
taining the quality of students if the
school were to increase the size of
the student body.
With an acceptance rate of
around 10 percent annually, John
son said, "there have to be a lot of
qualified people in that pool they're

rejecting."
Joss agreed that the school will
grow and maintain quality.
"We clearly will grow," he said,
hut "not in any huge way." Noting
the school's limitations on physical
space, he said. "We may try to lever
age our strengths and skills in infor
mation management to reach more
people," through programs such as
distance learning. But on the whole.
"We will stay a small school."
Academic research vs. practical
experience
Business schools also struggle
with the issue of how to serve the
needs of \IBA students and corpo
rations, mans of whom are interest
ed in taking practical knowledge
hack into the business world, as well
as the needs of research-oriented
faculty and business doctoral stu
dents.
loss noted that Stanford has a
history of balancing "commercial
i eality and academic rigor" in cours
es and research. I le also pointed out
that research that seems theoretical
may eventually have practical appli
cations. For example. 30-year-old
research into options trading and
pi icing and portfolio management is
now used every day on Wall Street,
he said.
I lie Business School has also re
cently entered into a project with
the School ol I ngineering and cor
porate partners called the Supply
Chain Management Forum. Joss is
excited about the project.
loss bridges the gap between

academic and practical with his 30
years of hands-on corporate man
agement experience and his busi
ness doctoral degree.
"1 think it's an advantage to have
a foot in both worlds," he said.
Barth agreed. "He understands
an academic's life," while bringing
his outside experience.
"We've had phenomenally suc
cessful deans in the past from both
worlds." she said, so the committee
looked for the best candidate re
gardless of background.
Johnson and first-year MBA stu
dent Marjoleine Slappendel both
concurred.
Johnson said, "To build on the
strengths of Stanford and Silicon
Valley, you have to have someone
who understands a fast-paced busi
ness environment."
Instruction is also an issue.
Though the Business School has re
vamped its core curriculum in the
past two years, Johnson noted some
classes needed further refinement.
"The core needs a little work, but
it's getting better. When you're pay

ing so much money, you expect all
[classes] to be very high quality," he
said.
Slappendel said the balance be
tween what is essential to a business
education and what should be elec
tive is also a topic of discussion
among students.
Joss intends to incorporate more
high-tech innovations into the Busi
ness School to expose students to
the power of technology "through
the ordinary operations of the
school," as well as courses.
Stanford and the outside world
While Stanford Business School
usually receives high rankings from
U.S. News and World Report, the
school gets rankings between five
and 10 in Business Week's poll, the
other major annual ranking of busi
ness schools.
Deans are traditionally forced to
worry about these outside assess
ments. However, Slappendel said
that Business Week's lower rank
ings are not necessarily a cause for

concern. She explained the maga
zine's assessment relies heavily on
particular recruiters' opinions.
"They don't ask high-tech firms,
only investment banks and other big
businesses," she said.
Johnson agreed.
"Employers hate us — they only
get a few people," because many
students are attracted to the entre
preneurial opportunities in Silicon
Valley.
In turn, "recruiters give us very
low marks, because they can't get
people to join their companies or
even to go back to the East Coast,"
he said.
But for many Stanford business
students, this is not a problem.
"We're in an unbelievably good po
sition, right in the epicenter of a
worldwide technological revolu
tion," said Johnson.
The increasing globalization of
business is also important to stu
dents, faculty and Joss himself and
will be another major thrust of edu
cation and research at the Business
School in the future.

Housing and faculty issues
Though graduate students have
recently been pushing for more Uni
versity housing, business students
have been largely uninvolved. Most
business students come out of well
paying jobs for the brief, two-year
MBA program and will return to
even better-paying jobs upon gradu
ation.
The new Schwab Residential
Learning Center, largely devoted to
business students, is popular, ac
cording to Slappendel. Mostly first
year business students live there;
second-year students generally
move off campus. Thus, students do
not feel the impetus to work with
other graduate students for in
creased housing, Johnson said. But
he lamented the lack of a sense of a
unified graduate community at
Stanford.
"The Business School is isolat
ed," Johnson said. "I think it gets
very bad press, or people don't real
ize it exists. I'd love to have more in
teraction with undergraduates or
the [other schoolsl."

Joss said that on the housing
issue, "The Business School has to
be a part of the University solution,"
though he was unaware of the
specifics of the problem.
Recruitment and retention of fe
male and minority faculty members
is also at the forefront of Stanford
debate.
Joss noted that he helped rede
fine a number of jobs at Wells
Fargo, such as branch manager, dur
ing his tenure there, to open them
up to a broader pool of applicants
many of whom were new to the
banking industry. This allowed
Wells Fargo to "open up more av
enues for women and minorities."
he said.
Joss said female and minority
faculty hiring would be one of his
priorities, though he pointed out
that the pool of candidates cannot
be expanded by redefining the job
description, as he did at Wells
Fargo.
"It will be a challenge," he said.
Joss' initial appointment, like
that of all deans, is for five years.
