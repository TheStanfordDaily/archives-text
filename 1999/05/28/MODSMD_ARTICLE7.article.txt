Rash of vehicle burglaries
Seven vehicle break-ins occurred around campus last week, mostly con
centrated in the north and west parts of campus.
Last ITiursday, a wallet was taken from a truck with a camper attached
in the Stock Farm parking lot. The car was locked, but there were no signs
of forced entry.
On Saturday morning, around 2:30 a.m., a locked Jeep Wrangler parked
by the Electioneer Road tennis courts was also broken into with no signs of
forced entry. A Sony CD player was reported stolen from the car.
An athletic hag from a car in the Toyon parking lot and a collection of
CDs from a car in the Roble parking lot were also stolen over the weekend.
Two unkx'ked vehicles were also burglarized last week. On Saturday, a
wallet was taken from a Volvo in the Lyman parking lot, while an unlocked
University vehicle had a cellular phone stolen from it in the 655 Serra lot on
Tuesday afternoon.
Finally, on Wednesday night, a locked Ford Explorer parked at the Pui
chon building west of Campus Drive had its window smashed but nothing
was taken. Bandy said the car alarm may have been set off and driven the
suspect away.
Police have no suspects in these cases. Bandy said it is possible that there
is a burglar walking around north campus looking for easy thefts. "Resi
dents who see someone wandering through a parking lot looking at cars
should call 911."

License plates stolen from Toyon lot
Ten cars with out-of-state license plates had their plates stolen during the
past week in the Toyon parking lot.
"This is not all that uncommon," said Stanford Police Lieutenant Del
Bandy. "Every once in a while, usually during the last few weeks of school,
someone decides to make a license plate collection."
Since the police have entered the plates as stolen goods, this seemingly
innocent collection of license plates could potentially be dangerous. "It can
be a felony to be in possession of stolen property," said Bandy.
Besides collection purposes, Bandy said that license plates are often
stolen by car thieves, who drive around looking for a car similar to the one
they have taken. Then they exchange the plates so that they have "cold
plates," or ones which are no longer on record with the police as belonging
to a stolen vehicle.
However, given the time of year and the large number of thefts in a short
time frame, police do not consider the gathering of "cold plates" to be a mo
tive for this crime.
Police have no suspects and have made no arrests.
Plates from Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho. Michigan, North Car
olina, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Virginia were taken.
