## Controversial restoration of 'The Last Supper' unveiled in Milan Giving Leonardo a new lease on life 
### 
MILAN. Italy (AP) — Italy
proudly put a cleaner, brighter
"The Last Supper" on show to the
world yesterday, the result of a 22-
vear scraping and scrubbing that
brought light and color to Leonar
do da Vinci's grease- and grinie
blackened masterpiece.
Critics condemned the restora
tion — which took nearly two
decades longer than Leonardo
spent painting the fresco — saying
it removed traces of earlier
retouchings they believe may have
at least been faithful to the origi
nal.
The latest restoration was at
least the 10th.
Culture Minister Giovanna
Melandri presided over a VIP-only
showing late yesterday, part of
events that included a Mass, full
page newspaper ads touting the
project and previews for the press.
"What we have brought to light
are Leonardo's original and bril
liant colors," declared Pinin Bram
billa Barcilon, who spent half her
professional life overseeing the
work in the refectory of Santa
Maria delle Grazie church in
downtown Milan.
With scaffolding and curtains
removed and floodlights focused
on the fresco. Leonardo's work
showed new life and colors yester
day — a much more vibrant ver
sion of the previously almost
blackened wall.
Restorers used high-tech sci
ence. special chemicals and micro
scopes to remove piled-on paint
and varnish of earlier restorations,
flake by flake, to reach Leonardo's
original.

In areas of the 15-foot-tall, 30-
foot-long painting, 90 percent of
the original survived, according to
Pietro Marani of the Milan com
mission of artistic and historical
heritage.
Overall, however, the painting
is now "18 to 20 percent Leonardo
and NO percent by the restorer."
said James Beck, an art history
professor at Colombia University
in New York City.
"They scraped everything away
and repainted it themselves," said
Beck. a longtime critic of many of
Italy's restoration techniques.
"She repainted the head of
Christ, which I thought was pretty

drastic." Beck said of Brambilla.
"People seem to like it. but that's
not the issue. It's a post-modern
painting now. and not a Renais
sance painting."
Working on commission for
Duke Ludovico Sforza from 1494-
98, Leonardo rendered his inter
pretation of Christ's last meal with
his apostles by painting on bumpy,
dry plaster, using pigments mixed
with egg and oil.
By 1566. architect Giorgio
Vasari noted that the painting was
decaying and looked like nothing
more than a "blinding spot."
History heaped further indigni
ties on it. Workmen in the 17th

century cut away Christ's legs and
feet to widen a door. Napoleon's
troops boarded their horses in the
hall. In l l )43. an Allied bomb hit
the building, bringing down the
roof and one wall, but the painting
was spared.
The nine known previous
restorations, often badly executed,
added to the miseries of the mas
terpiece. as did humidity, dust and
pollution, Marani said.
To guard the refurbished work,
visitors will he directed through
special filtering systems and dust
absorbing carpets before reaching
the refectory. Reservations will be
necessary for the 15-minute visits.

Following 22 years of high-tech work, Italian ministers in Milan yesterday unveiled a restored version
of Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" that is remarkably bright and clean. Critics claim, however,
that the restored work is not faithful to da Vinci's original.
