An Open Letter to the Stanford Community from the Asian
American Community at Stanford
As members of the Asian Pacific American community at
Stanford, we wish to express our outrage and categorical rejection
of the racist e-mail message that was circulated this past weekend.
The hatred expressed against the African American, Chicano/a,
and Latino/a members of our community, and indeed the entire
Stanford community, is an affront to our aspirations fora diverse
and civil society.
We stand in solidarity with other community members who share
in the anger and frustration of this offense. We strongly reject the
attempts to divide and pit segments of our community against one
another. The e-mail message strategically positioned a Thai grad
uate student specifically, and Asian Pacific Americans in general,
against other people of color. Furthermore, we reject the notion
that students of Asian, Pacific Island, or European descent are in
any way uniquely entitled to housing or other services at the
University. We are appalled by attempts to manipulate Asian
Pacific Americans for selfish and divisive purposes.
We are reminded that Asian Pacific Americans have been, and
continue to be, targets of violence, exclusion, and exploitation. In
times of economic hardship and xenophobia, Asian Pacific
Americans have been scapegoated and victimized. These attempts
continue to this day and are readily apparent in our current dis
course on national security and campaign finance. We reiterate
our rejection of these sentiments and renew our continued struggle
with other people of conscience for social justice and civil rights. It
is our hope that this most recent assault on the Stanford commu
nity will not derail but only strengthen the continuing efforts to
institutionalize values of diversity and community here at Stanford.
We reaffirm the urgent need for 1) more women and minority fac
ulty and a diverse tenured faculty; 2) institutionalized financial
support for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity; 3) institu
tionalized funding of ethnic centers, of other student centers, and
of student educational and cultural programming; and 4) attention
to the housing and recruitment
of all graduate and undergraduate students. Only by continuing to
progress towards these positive goals can we ensure that Stanford
meets its mission of teaching, learning, and research for all its
members.
Once again, we denounce the abhorrent opinions expressed in the
e-mail message targeting members of the Stanford community and
reject attempts to divide and manipulate the University communi
ty. We seek to work constructively with all people of good will to
ensure a safe and respectful living and learning environment.
