Office of the President
The ASSU would like to thank Dean of Students Marc Wais and Vice Provost
for Student Affairs James Montoya for organizing the forum Sunday night to
address the racist, derogatory email that so many of us received Saturday
morning. Like the rest of the student population, we were personally
disgusted by both the email and the website that it linked to. Although,
as Stanford students, we must be able to think freely, we also must avoid
statements that are constructed out of hate and that attack the freedom of
others. The Stanford community should use this email-and other incidents
like this—to realize how hurtful racism is and to come closer together as
a community.
We urge the student body to trust that this matter will be thoroughly
investigated and that campus authorities will do everything they can to
punish the person responsible to the fullest extent of the law.
In the weeks and months to come, the ASSU will work with various students
and administrators to facilitate student discussion celebrating diversity.
The campus community should not only focus on matters of race after
incidents like this email occur. Racial identity and discrimination are
issues that impact all of our lives every day.
If any Stanford student would like to talk about this incident further,
please do not hesitate to contact us at president@assu.stanford.edu.
