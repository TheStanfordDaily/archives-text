will be established:
• a Lower Level Portal (near Current Periodicals,
facing Galvez Mall), and
• the Meyer Library elevator (to Green South)
♦ Circulation services will be available at two
different desks: one at the Lower Level Portal
and one on the first floor of Meyer Library. Patrons
will be able to pay bills and pick-up recalls, holds,
and pages at the Meyer location only.
