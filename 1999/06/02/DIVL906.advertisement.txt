PLEASE DO MOT AEAfJDON
YOUR Qm OR OTHER P&l
While University housing policy prohibits keeping
pets in or about Campus residences,
some students still have them
Despite good intentions
some of those pets will be lost or abandoned on Campus,
if students cannot take them home, travelling, or to a new apartment/career.
They reproduce and, with their offspring,
may die of starvation and disease
Critters left behind in student housing may die of dehydration and starvation,
before they are found too late in the summer
If you or a friend are in this predicament,
please find a way to keep your pet or find a good home for it.
If you cannot work it out, or you find a lost or abandoned animal,
/ \ V\ wi " wor k with y° u to a good home for it
