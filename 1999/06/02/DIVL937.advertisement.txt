Ewia
Hellenic Cuisine
420 Emerson Street
Palo Alto, CA 94301
(650) 326-0983
It might have taken Odysseus 10 years to return from the
Trojan War and eat a good meal, but we only had to drive
into Palo Alto to dine in the Greek splendor of Ewia.
Located off of University Avenue in downtown Palo Alto
(next to l : &A's!), Ewia offers upscale Hellenic cuisine at
upscale prices. If you have the "dinars," we recommend you
journey to Ewia and taste a meal fit for the gods.
The sanie way that Ewia blends traditional and modern
Greek cuisine, its interior combines Old World d£cor with
touches of modernity. The prevalent decorative themes
were the ancient Greek pots, the wooden barrels along the
wall and the open grill. These features all contribute to the
feeling of a village eating experience. Rest assured that
modern elegance and intimacy were manifest throughout.
Along the back wall of the restaurant, there was a display of
differently shaped colorful glass bottles against a bright
white background. This touch of the new gave the restau
rant a vibrant appearance that enhanced the contemporary
appeal of the restaurant.
The menu offers a wide variety of authentic Greek dish
es composed mostly of fish, lamb and vegetables. The selec
tions never get boring: the chef injects new life into the
menu by varying some of the options every so often. Our
Greek waiter Antoni selected a delicious assortment of
appetizers for our enjoyment. Included in this array were
dolmathes, grape leaves stuffed with ground lamb, rice and
leeks; Spanakotiropita, filo stuffed with spinach and feta
cheese; Kalamarakia, crispy calamari severed with a garlic
potato spread; and three dipping sauces. One was a yogurt
cucumber base, one was an eggplant base and one was
humus. These came with some warm pita bread and were
each delicious. In fact, all of the appetizers were outstand
ing.
For our main courses we had the warrior-like courage to
order our own selections. Adrien ordered Arnisia Paidakia,
rib-cut, mesquite-grilled lamb chops served with potatoes.
Adrien expected the best from the Greeks — famous for
their lamb dishes — and was not at all disappointed. But as
delicious as the aroma wafting from his dish was, the heat
emanating from it was problematic. David was so busy
enjoying his food that he didn't notice his face was burning
hot, as was the rest of his physique. For his main course,
David had the Psari Sta Karvouna, mesquite-grilled bass
with a light oregano sauce, which was first presented as a
whole before being deboned. David thoroughly enjoyed the
soft meaty quality of the fish.
We concluded our meal with the waiter's recommenda
tion of a refreshing yogurt sorbet. Although it was very
good, it tasted suspiciously like frozen Dannon. Overall, we
found Ewia to be outstanding in both its d£cor and cuisine
and look forward to returning quite shortly. We are both in
agreement that Ewia is the best restaurant in Palo Alto.
Sinharitiria!
Quick Notes:
Distance: 5 minutes
Parking: Valet or lots in front
Ambiance: Delightful
Service: Excellent
Liquor: Full bar and wine list (including Greek wine)
