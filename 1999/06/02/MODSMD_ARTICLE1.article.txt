# Bookstore may face civil charge
## 
### Jennie Berry Editorial staff 
Stanford Police have declined to
formally investigate the Stanford
Bookstore's business practices, but
this does not appear to be the end of
the store's potential legal troubles.
The Bookstore accidentally dou
ble-charged more than 400 cus
tomers earlier this academic year,
and upon learning of the overbilling.
it neither notified customers of the
problem nor attempted to credit ac
counts of those double-charged.
Stanford Police Sgt. Rick Tipton
called the Bookstore's failure to take

action "bad business practice." but
after talking to store security, he said
he found no evidence of criminal in
tent by Bookstore management to
overcharge customers.
No more police investigation into
Bookstore practices is predicted.
"This appears to be a civil matter, so
unless a victim steps forward, we
would not pursue it," Tipton ex
plained.
However a victim may soon step
forward.
Crosby Grant, a psychology co
terminal student, said he plans to file
a formal complaint with the Santa
Clara Countv District Attorney's

Office. Earlier this year Grant wrote
a letter to the Bookstore requesting
that the overbilling be made public.
"When the Bookstore chose not
to seek out and re-compensate your
defrauded customers, [it] made a
choice that is wrong," said Grant,
who was double-charged last fall.
"The Bookstore may not have cred
ited this situation, but the Bookstore
chose to perpetuate this mechanism
to defraud [its] customers."
A1 Weger, Santa Clara assistant
district attorney, said a complaint by
(irant or any other person would not
be ignored.
"It's our job to look into a com

plaint â€” look into potential viola
tions of the law," Weger noted.
If charged in a civil matter, the
Bookstore would most likely look at
a charge of unfair business practices,
according to Weger.
Unfair competition, under the
law, is any practice whose harm to
victims outweighs its benefits. If
found guilty the Bookstore could
face a range of penalties: fines, resti
tution or an injunction issued to en
sure a similar practice does not occur
again.
Since Friday, when a story about
the overbilling incident appeared in
The Daily, nine people have contact
ed the Bookstore about the way it
handled double-charges.
This number will likely increase,
because the Bookstore is now taking
steps to determine the exact number
of people overbilled.
Peggy Mendelson, president and
CEO of Stanford Bookstore, con

tacted Bank of America about the
double-billing for the first time last
week. The merchant bank for the
Bookstore has since agreed to pro
vide a list of credit card transactions
that occurred over the fall double
billing period.
The Bookstore plans to put the
list of customers to good use.
"We anticipate being able to re
view this list, which will likely in
clude between 17,(XK) and 20,(KM) in
dividual transactions, possibly in
stances of duplicates," said Mendel
son. "Then we will compare this list
to the accounts we have already
credited and issue refunds immedi
ately to any ... where a credit is still
due."
This process of reviewing trans
actions is especially difficult, be
cause the number of days where
double-charging occurred is larger
than previously anticipated. The
Bookstore once said the overbilling
spanned a two-day period in late
September; the double-charging pe
riod has now been changed to the
first five days of October, 1998.
Although it will take a lot of time
and effort to correct the double
billing mistakes, Mendelson said she
doesn't foresee any negative conse
quences of the double-charge show
ing up in current Bookstore negotia

tions to be managed by an outside
vendor.
"I do not believe this problem
will have any impact on our current
negotiations, because large compa
nies deal with system problems rou
tinely and understand that situations
like this can occur."
However student leaders said
they are not so understanding when
it comes to how the Bookstore han
dled the double-billing.
"I'm disappointed that the Book
store didn't do anything up to this
point, and 1 would hope it would do
everything in its power to notify peo
ple who were affected or potentially
affected with all due speed," said se
nior Maren Norton, a member of the
Bookstore advisory committee and
former ASSU president.
Current ASSU President Mike
Levin concurred.
"It's a no-brainer," said Levin.
"The best course of action would be
to find a list of double-charged stu
dents and refund them."
