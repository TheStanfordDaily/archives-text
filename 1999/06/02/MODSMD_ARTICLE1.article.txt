# Bookstore may face civil charge
## 
### Jennie Berry Editorial staff 
Stanford Police have declined to
formally investigate the Stanford
Bookstore's business practices, but
this does not appear to be the end of
the store's potential legal troubles.
The Bookstore accidentally dou
ble-charged more than 400 cus
tomers earlier this academic year,
and upon learning of the overbilling.
it neither notified customers of the
problem nor attempted to credit ac
counts of those double-charged.
Stanford Police Sgt. Rick Tipton
called the Bookstore's failure to take

action "bad business practice." but
after talking to store security, he said
he found no evidence of criminal in
tent by Bookstore management to
overcharge customers.
No more police investigation into
Bookstore practices is predicted.
"This appears to be a civil matter, so
unless a victim steps forward, we
would not pursue it," Tipton ex
plained.
However a victim may soon step
forward.
Crosby Grant, a psychology co
terminal student, said he plans to file
a formal complaint with the Santa
Clara Countv District Attorney's

Office. Earlier this year Grant wrote
a letter to the Bookstore requesting
that the overbilling be made public.
"When the Bookstore chose not
to seek out and re-compensate your
defrauded customers, [it] made a
choice that is wrong," said Grant,
who was double-charged last fall.
"The Bookstore may not have cred
ited this situation, but the Bookstore
chose to perpetuate this mechanism
to defraud [its] customers."
A1 Weger, Santa Clara assistant
district attorney, said a complaint by
(irant or any other person would not
be ignored.
"It's our job to look into a com

plaint â€” look into potential viola
tions of the law," Weger noted.
If charged in a civil matter, the
Bookstore would most likely look at
a charge of unfair business practices,
according to Weger.
Unfair competition, under the
law, is any practice whose harm to
victims outweighs its benefits. If
found guilty the Bookstore could
face a range of penalties: fines, resti
tution or an injunction issued to en
sure a similar practice does not occur
again.
