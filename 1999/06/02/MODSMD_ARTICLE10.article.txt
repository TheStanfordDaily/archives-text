### 
BELGRADE. Yugoslavia
(AP) — A senior Yugoslav minister
accused NA TO of trying to torpedo
a Kosovo peace plan by intensifying
bombings on the eve of talks
between Slobodan Milosevic and
international envoys, and the army
announced yesterday that a top gen
eral had been killed.
The Yugoslav air force deputy
chief of staff. Gen. Ljubisa Veliek
ovic. died while inspecting units in
"the first line of defense" against
NATO air attack, the Army
supreme command information ser
vice said.
It was unclear whether the death
was the result of an attack by
NATO, which has been bombing
Serb military targets since March 24.
The Yugoslav military usually does
not report its casualties.
Velickovic, 53. graduated from
the Yugoslav military academy and
the Soviet general staff academy in
Moscow. I le previously served as air
force commander and deputy
defense minister. A state funeral was
set for today in his hometown of Crl
jenac, bO miles southeast of Bel
grade.
In the Yugoslav capital. Goran
Matic, a government minister who is
believed close to Milosevic, accused
NATO of trying to undermine
peace negotiations.
Every time a breakthrough
seems near, he said, there is "an
intensification of the bombing that
iiirns these diplomatic efforts use
less." Matic said.
; NATO, for its part, showed no
letup in the air bombardment, strik
ing Serb military targets across
Kosovo and elsewhere as talks on
the Kosovo conflict heated up in
Bonn, Germany.
Alliance jets also fired across the
border into Albania, hitting govern
ment bunkers, injuring a refugee
and narrowly missing a group of for

eign journalists as fighting raged
between Serb and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.
In Germany. Russian special
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin met
Tuesday with U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott and Fin
land's president to assess prospects
fora political settlement after Bel
grade announced it had accepted the
"principles" of an international
peace plan.
Chernomyrdin and Finland's
Martti Ahtisaari were expected in
Belgrade today for more talks with
Milosevic on the plan proposed by
the G-S group of major industrial
ized nations and Russia.
Military officials from more than
30 nations were in Belgium, drafting
plans for an international security
force in Kosovo that would ensure
that ethnic Albanians can return to
their homes safely.
The group meeting at NATO's
military headquarters —l c ) NATO
nations and 12 partner countries —
will help create a force of 50,(XX),
nearly double the number originally
envisioned more than two months
ago.
While Yugoslavia has said it
accepts the principles of the G-8
plan, it remains unclear whether
Belgrade will sign off on Western
demands for an armed military force
with NATO as its core in Kosovo to
police the peace agreement and
supervise the return of 850,(XX) eth
nic Albanian refugees.
Yesterday, the commander of the
Kosovo-based Third Army, Col.
Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, said
changes to key elements of the G->S
plan were necessary.
Amid talk of peace, NATO
planes launched attacks in Kosovo,
including the area around the Alba
nian border where Kosovo Albani
ans are trying to open a supply corri
dor from hideouts in Kosovo.
