# Clinton announces anti-violence study

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clin
ton. brandishing a cartoonish magazine ad
fora video game "more fun than shooting
your neighbor's cat." ordered a government
investigation yesterday into whether — and
how — the entertainment business markets
violence to children.
"Our children are being fed a dependable
daily dose of violence," Clinton said, that
amounts to the typical child witnessing 40,(XX)
plav murders and 200,000 dramatized acts of
violence by his 18th birthday.
Such a barrage blurs the line between
"fantasy and reality violence" for too many
young people, the president said.
"I know this stuff sells," Clinton exhorted
Hollywood from a lectern in the Rose Gar
den. "But the time has come to show some
restraint, even if it has a short-term impact on
the bottom line."
The $1 million, 18-month review by the
Justice Department and Federal Trade Com
mission is the latest initiative from a presi
dent grasping for solutions to an increasingly
deadly spate of shootings in the nation's
schools.
Having already introduced new gun con
trols. Clinton trained on the entertainment
industry's business practices the same micro

scope he focused on cigarette companies, and
their juvenile-aimed Joe Camel ads, when he
cracked down on teen smoking.
Clinton said federal investigators will
"study the extent to which the video game,
music and movie markets do actually market
violence to children" and whether those
industries only laxly restrict sales to minors.
FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said his
staff will, as in probes of the tobacco and
alcohol industries, look into the entertain
ment companies' internal marketing records
even if it takes subpoenas.
Douglas Lowenstein, president of the
Interactive Digital Software Association,
promised cooperation with a "fair-minded
review."
On the dais with Pitofsky, first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Attorney Gen
eral Janet Reno, Clinton held up several col
orful video-game ads that he considered
offensive.
The president's Rose Garden announce
ment came three weeks after he and Mrs.
Clinton convened a meeting of movie-indus
trv lobbyist Jack Valenti and five dozen of
the nation's leading educators, officials,
entertainers and gun makers to brainstorm a
national campaign against youth violence.
