# Russia may be forced to abandon Mir

### 
MOSCOW (AP) — In the strongest sign yet
that Russia's era of space glory may be ending,
cosmonauts will abandon the Mir space station in
August and let it eventually burn up in the atmo
sphere unless new funding is found, officials said
yesterday.
The 13-year-old Mir saw a series of accidents in
IW7. including a fire and a near-fatal space colli
sion. but has been running relatively trouble-free
since then. When it is abandoned in August, it will
be the first time the station has been unmanned
since it was launched.
Its biggest obstacle lately has been financial:
The government can no longer come up with the
$250 million needed each year to keep the space
station up and running.
"We can't keep the station aloft, because we
have no money," Sergei Gorbunov, a Russian
Space Agency spokesman, said on NTV television
vesterdav.

The decision must still be approved by Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin. The cash-short government
has agreed to finance the Mir only through
August, and says it should be discarded then
unless private funding is found. Efforts to raise the
money have failed.
The Russian Space Agency has been under
pressure from its U.S. counterpart NASA to aban
don the Mir and concentrate its meager resources
on the international space station. Because of
Russia's failure to build its segments on time, the
first permanent crew isn't expected to he able to
move into the international space station until
next March, almost two years behind schedule.
A panel of top Russian space officials met yes
terday at the Mission Control Center in Korolyov,
outside Moscow, to make their recommendations
on the Mir's future.
They decided that the best option would be for
the three-man crew to depart in August, leaving it

to circle the Earth unmanned until early next year,
when it is expected to burn up in the atmosphere,
said Vyacheslav Mikhailichenko, a spokesman for
space agency.
Space officials had said previously that it would
be too dangerous to leave the space station
unmanned. Memories of a previous unhappy
experience in February 1991, when Soviet ground
controllers lost control of the unmanned. 40-ton
Salyut-7 space station, stoked fears that the 130-
ton Mir could cause havoc on the ground with a
fiery return.
Pieces of the Salvut fell on a sparsely populat
ed area in Argentina's Andes mountains near the
Chilean border, but caused no injuries or damage.
Mikhailichenko said there was no cause for
worry.
"Prior to the crew's departure, they will install
and test new equipment allowing ground con
trollers to ensure a trouble-free flisht," he said.
