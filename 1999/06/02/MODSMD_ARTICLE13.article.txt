Merger of Microsoft rivals won't pose a threat
WASHINGTON (AP) — Seeking to soothe a judge's concerns
about implications of the $10 billion merger of two of Microsoft's
biggest rivals, a government witness said yesterday the deal is too lit
tle, too late to pose a credible threat to the software giant.
The testimony of Franklin Fisher, an economist, clearly was aimed
at easing misgivings that U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
had expressed earlier in the Microsoft trial, when he said America
Online's purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. "might be a
very significant change in the playing field."
Final testimony in the trial began yesterday, with the government
using Fisher as a lens to focus the judge's attention on the Microsoft
Corp.'s alleged aggression toward rivals and away from the impact on
the AOL-Netscape alliance.
America Online Inc. currently distributes a version of Microsoft's
Internet Explorer browser to its more than 17 million subscribers and
is contractually obligated to continue until Januarv 2001.

Agassi advances to semifinals of French Open
PARIS (AP) —The ever-changing Andre Agassi has a new look
every match: a goatee at the start of the French Open, clean-shaven
for the second round, a full heard by the quarterfinals.
What hasn't changed is the sweet rhythm he's found in his game,
except perhaps to get better and better, and yesterday he rode that
beat into the semis.
It was hardly the most thrilling victory of the day — that belonged
to five-time champion Steffi Graf in her 6-1, 6-7 (5-7). 6-3 quarterfi
nal victory over No. 2 Lindsay Davenport — but it was certainly the
most dominant.
I wo years ago. Agassi considered retirement. Iwo weeks ago, he
almost pulled out of the French Open.
Now he stands within two victories of what he calls "the greatest
thing 1 could achieve" — winning a Grand Slam title that has escaped
the grasp of his rival. Pete Sampras, and that defied the likes of Jimmy
Connors and John McEnroe.

GM develops "auto black box system'
WASHINGTON (AP) — General Motors Corp. has a device in
many of its new cars that functions like the black box recorder in air
planes: It collects data as a car crashes.
Doctors and government officials say that information can help
them better understand how the human body tolerates car crashes. It
could then be applied to construct safer cars, improve the treatment
of crash victims and write government auto safety standards that
would better protect crash victims.
The existence of the so-called auto black box system also is raising
sensitive privacy questions about whethei such information can be
used in litigation.
The most sophisticated version of GM's device, known formally as
a sensing and diagnostic module, is in hundreds of thousands of GM
cars from the 1999 model year, GM says.
The module will be in almost all GM vehicles within the next few
years, the company says.
