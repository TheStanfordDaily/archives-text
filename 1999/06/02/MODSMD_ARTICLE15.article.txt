## Editor's farewell Making tracks 
### 
Last train leaving
station sees editor in
chief wave goodbye

THERE IS a small town in
Northern California, nestled
in the Siskiyou Mountains,
where the population and elevation
both number about 2,000. It's a place
where grocery store clerks tell you
where to find the best swimmin'
holes and kids go fishing in the river
that runs through ( ilv Park.
By all accounts, it should have
been abandoned long ago. Dun
smuir is a railroad town, one of the
last of a dying breed. While other
cities on the 1-5 corridor have
embraced the freeway and the
money it brings, Dunsmuir has insu
lated itself from the truck stop men
tality and retained a distinctive char
acter. It boasts no major industries,
no fancy tourist attractions, not even
a McDonald's.
All it has is the romanticism of an
invention whose time has passed,
carried on by some of the best peo
ple in the world.
Camping in the state park just
down the interstate from that town
last weekend, I reflected on 15
weeks of editing The Daily while
watching the trains thunder bv on an
hourly basis. There couldn't be two
more different worlds, I thought,
than the tranquillity of a sleepy
mountain town and the constant
stress of a daily newspaper.
Hut back in the office on my final
night of editing. I realized that while
they seem at odds, my favorite news
paper and my favorite railroad town
have a lot in common. I'lie Daily,
like Dunsmuir. is among the last of a
dying breed the heyday of news
papers has long since passed. But
like that small town, the paper and
its piand tradition arc carried on bv

some wonderful people.
Years of running HO-scale trains
around a bedroom track with my
dad and brother gave me an affinity
for the railroad; my love of newspa
pers dates back further, to mornings
at the breakfast table when parents
tired of telling me Dodger scores
taught me to read them myself. The
fact that Grandpa Jim wrote a news
paper column didn't hurt, either.
But even the deepest-rooted love
for papers (or the thrill of seeing my
work in print) couldn't have kept me
at The Daily. It was the people who
did that. Over the last three years,
and particularly this volume, I have
had the fortune of working with a
group of journalists so talented, so
energetic, so simply fun to be
around, that my descriptions will
never do them justice. They are the
soul of this paper, and working with
them is what made all the late nights
and tough calls worthwhile.
1 will miss this job. I will miss wak
ing up every morning to a paper that
we worked so hard the night before
to put out. I will miss reading pages
at midnight and scrambling.to meet
deadline. Most of all, though. I will
miss the chance to work so closely
with the people who bring the
romanticism of newspapers to life.
As the sound of the boxcars lulled
me to sleep on a clear night last
weekend, I was thankful for the
peaceful oasis that is Dunsmuir. Sit
ting in the office now, with papers
piled around and the final deadline
approaching, it seems a little strange
to feel that same appreciation fora
newspaper. But I guess that's what
beine a romantic is all about.
