Bookstore responds
I rid;i> 's story concerning accidental dou
ble-charges for some credit card purchases
made at the Bookstore last September states
thai the Bookstore is in negotiations fora
"buyout."
As noted by History Prof. David
Kennedy in his letter published in I he Daily
itn April 7. Stanford I 'diversity Bookstore is
noi for sale. I lie Board is evaluating propos
als lor a third party to manage the stores.
We are continuing efforts to assure that
anyone whose charges were affected by the
system problem last September is quickly
reimbursed, including working to identify
purchasers who may not have reviewed their
credit card statements.
I urge students, faculty and staff who are
concerned about this issue to review their
statements as soon as possible and to contact
the Bookstore immediately if a problem is
apparent.
We regret this inconvenience to our cus
tomers.

Another Bookstore story
After reading Friday's article on misman
agement at the Bookstore, I thought I should
share my own "mismanagement" experience
that is particularly relevant to graduating
seniors.
I bought the obligatory graduation
announcements for my family in late April. I
was sent a reminder to pick up the package
about a week later.
When I came in, they told me that the
package had been sent to my home, as I
requested. A month later, however, my par
ents still had not received it.
When I went in a couple of days ago, they
found the package in the back room, with the
shipping orders still intact. I reported the
mistake to customer service so they could see
it other packages had received the same fate
as mine.
I suggest that all seniors waiting for pack
ages should check back at the store, even if
they told you it was in the mail.
Overall, I am extremely disappointed in
how the Bookstore handled the situation. I
had to ask about the package, they never
seemed to check the front of the package

(where il plainly displayed a shipping
receipt).
Additionally, senior announcements
serve only one temporal role. By mismanag
ing package distribution, the Bookstore
made the announcements useless. Their only
solution, for those in the same predicament,
is to refund shipping ($7).
Without direct competition in the Stan
ford announcements market, il seems that
the Bookstore takes little care of its cus
tomers.

Car dependence unnecessary
Wah-wah. how will I get to Safeway?
All around me I hear people crying out in
distress for the freshman class of 2(KK). won
dering to each other, with 110 parking, how
will their experiences at Stanford be trans
formed.
It should be indicative of something
when, by the end of the year, the number of
freshmen with cars jumps from 16 percent to
48 percent.

Why docs everyone perpetuate the illu
sion that cars make them last, when they just
keep us from discovering more efficient,
healthier modes of transportation? ( ars pro
vide too easy of a solution for people able to
afford them.
For example, a couple of weeks ago I read
in lhe Daily students ranting because the
limited parking on campus made it difficult
for them to drive from their on-campus resi
dences to class.
Does this indicate to anyone that there
are too many cars overall?
Besides, is life outside of Stanford really
so inaccessible?
For the past two years I have been living
off-campus and commuting by bike. As I ride
to school every day, I smile at other people
and feel satisfied that I can create transporta
tion with my own energy.
Forcing new students to interact with the
surrounding communities without cars may
cause people to realize that there are no
insurmountable blocks to experiencing life
outside of Stanford.
Discomfort leads to personal growth and
increased awareness of others.
