Another Bookstore story
After reading Friday's article on misman
agement at the Bookstore, I thought I should
share my own "mismanagement" experience
that is particularly relevant to graduating
seniors.
I bought the obligatory graduation
announcements for my family in late April. I
was sent a reminder to pick up the package
about a week later.
When I came in, they told me that the
package had been sent to my home, as I
requested. A month later, however, my par
ents still had not received it.
When I went in a couple of days ago, they
found the package in the back room, with the
shipping orders still intact. I reported the
mistake to customer service so they could see
it other packages had received the same fate
as mine.
I suggest that all seniors waiting for pack
ages should check back at the store, even if
they told you it was in the mail.
Overall, I am extremely disappointed in
how the Bookstore handled the situation. I
had to ask about the package, they never
seemed to check the front of the package

(where il plainly displayed a shipping
receipt).
Additionally, senior announcements
serve only one temporal role. By mismanag
ing package distribution, the Bookstore
made the announcements useless. Their only
solution, for those in the same predicament,
is to refund shipping ($7).
Without direct competition in the Stan
ford announcements market, il seems that
the Bookstore takes little care of its cus
tomers.

Car dependence unnecessary
Wah-wah. how will I get to Safeway?
All around me I hear people crying out in
distress for the freshman class of 2(KK). won
dering to each other, with 110 parking, how
will their experiences at Stanford be trans
formed.
It should be indicative of something
when, by the end of the year, the number of
freshmen with cars jumps from 16 percent to
48 percent.

Why docs everyone perpetuate the illu
sion that cars make them last, when they just
keep us from discovering more efficient,
healthier modes of transportation? ( ars pro
vide too easy of a solution for people able to
afford them.
For example, a couple of weeks ago I read
in lhe Daily students ranting because the
limited parking on campus made it difficult
for them to drive from their on-campus resi
dences to class.
Does this indicate to anyone that there
are too many cars overall?
Besides, is life outside of Stanford really
so inaccessible?
For the past two years I have been living
off-campus and commuting by bike. As I ride
to school every day, I smile at other people
and feel satisfied that I can create transporta
tion with my own energy.
Forcing new students to interact with the
surrounding communities without cars may
cause people to realize that there are no
insurmountable blocks to experiencing life
outside of Stanford.
Discomfort leads to personal growth and
increased awareness of others.
Maybe in the middle of the night when
you're up doing problem sets and eraving
milk and cookies, the easiest thing is to click
a button and shift into D, but transportation
services do exist to get people on and off
campus from early to late in the day.
At any rate, the objective is merely
delayed, not denied altogether, and after
nine months the University will welcome the
freshman cars onto campus.
When 1 see gas prices go up I think good
thoughts of a world where the roads are
grassy.
1 applaud the administration for its deci

Defending those not yet here
The proposal to ban future freshmen
from parking their cars on campus (which
essentially bans them from having cars) has
not been met with very much vocal opposi
tion from the faculty, staff or current stu
dents. How convenient, as none of them will
be affected. There has not been any opposi
tion from those who will be affected because
they do not yet exist.
As a matter of fact, I suspect that we will
never hear from those people, because they
will have chosen to attend Harvard, UC-
Berkeley, etc. instead of Stanford. Fora Uni
versity that makes headlines when the accep
tance rate of admitted students drops by a
couple of percentage points, it's amazing to
me that Stanford would risk driving away the
16 percent of freshmen who have cars.
When I was an undergraduate, I used my
car regularly to participate in off-campus
musical organizations, to drive back occa
sionally to my hometown, to purchase vari
ous things I needed from places that were not
accessible by public transit, to attend con
certs and theaters and even to participate in
organized search efforts in the hills fora stu
dent who had been missing and later found
murdered.
No public transportation system that
exists here would have allowed me to do
those things, and Stanford undergr. Is are
too isolated from the outside world already.
In a place like Boston or New York, most
student lifestyles are possible without a car,
but in our neck of the woods, lack of a car
would prevent many students from doing the
diverse and unusual things that are usually
viewed as sought-after qualities in our
"cream of the crop" student body.
People may make the case that freshmen
do not need to do many things that require
cars and therefore cars are not really neces
sary for freshmen. The debate will not be
very vocal, as those future freshmen who
would oppose the idea will vote with their

feet (or their wheels) and choose not to
attend Stanford.
Stanford is a great university, but there
are other great universities out there as well
that either allow cars or are in less rural
areas, and Stanford is not great enough that
students will give up their cars to attend.

New parking policy flawed
When my friends and I picked up The
Daily on May 26 and saw the headline,
"Freshmen in 2(XX) will do without cars." we
asked if it was a Chappie spoof. I find this
proposal so wrought with flaws that I can
only hope it's a joke or an attempt to gener
ate student input.
Acknowledging that solving the parking
problems on campus will disadvantage some
one, here's why I believe freshmen should
not be singled out:
•This plan solves a largely upperclass
problem by taking something away from
freshmen. I think it's embarrassing that the
school would even propose such an idea. It
destroys a great part of Stanford culture —
the lack of stratification between classes.
•About half of all freshmen live in all
frosh houses. I lived in one and know that
there is a constant scramble for rides and
heavy reliance on staff cars.
Freshmen are already concentrated in
groups with few cars. To put them in groups
with no cars, except for the staffs, would
wreak havoc on life in all-frosh dormitories
(and make staffing them very unappealing).
Even freshmen in four-class dormitories
tend to form all-frosh social groups, so their
lives would be severely impacted as well.
•The very features that make Stanford
appealing to many — laid-back seclusion,
dorm-centered communities, smallish stu
dent population — also make it incredibly
stilling.
We all have to get away to shed some
stress and keep our perspective.
Impromptu weekend road trips, late
night ventures to the City or food runs to
Lyon's are not the sort of activities one can
plan in advance to arrange fora rental car or
fleet of vans.
•What about freshmen with compelling
reasons to go off campus like work, family or
regular medical needs? Will there be special
permits for them? Will this system be as suc
cessful as the disability Draw? How will this
plan affect freshman participation in East
Palo Alto tutoring programs or other activi
ties with regular off-campus destinations?
•The assurance that the first class affected
by this proposal would be informed in admis
sions information belies the administration's
awareness that this plan has extremely nega

tive consequences, so much so, that it could
be a reason to attend another school.
As a Stanford ambassador who goes to
college fairs and talks to prospective appli
cants, I can vouch for the fact that people do
consider specific campus policies and conve
niences when choosing a school. Proximity to
a city and ease of getting there are big factors
on many students' minds, particularly when
they know how suburban Stanford is. I
would not want to skew the incoming class
toward people without a desire to get off
campus.
It could turn away students from larger
cities who like Stanford's academics but want
to retain some city life. And if that's the case,
I wonder what effect it would have on diver
sity. I really believe this policy could have
far-reaching consequences that have not
been considered.
•Finally, I question how much this plan
would really solve the parking problems on
campus. I lived in Wilbur Hall and there
were always spots available on the east side.
There are definitely problems in south and
west campus, but with most freshmen con
centrated in east residences, I just don't think
this will do the job.
Even if the plan worked, it's unfair and
the consequences are unacceptable.
None of these concerns are allayed by
hundreds of thousands of dollars in extended
Marguerite hours, rental cars or fleets of cars
and vans.
Dorm programming may survive intact,
but quality of life for freshmen would plum
met.
I hope that rather than begrudgingly sup
porting this decision, students will speak up
for their future classmates who have no
voice. How would your freshman experience
have been without cars?
We've gone without this "solution" for 15
years. I hope Associate Vice Provost for
Facilities Chris Christofferson will take a
couple more to get student suggestions and
create a new, equitable plan.

Sophomore, psychology
Article missed religious group
I have two comments on the May 20 arti
cle "Flourishing faith."
1. Is there a hint of racism, or at least of
elitism, in the portrayal of unenlightened
Mexican immigrants ("young families ...
recently arrived within the last 10 years")
who don't share the "progressive" ideas you
attribute to Stanford Catholics?
2. There is another thriving Catholic
group in Palo Alto that was not mentioned in
the article. The community of St. Ann is an
amateur choir of about 20 and a congrega
tion of about 100. Every Sunday, we sing

Mass and Vespers in Gregorian chant and
share a meal.
We've always been closely associated
with Stanford. The group started in the early
'60s as part of the Stanford Catholic commu
nity, and it still attracts many students and
distinguished faculty members, including
Rene Girard, William Mahrt, George Brown
and the late Prof. Emeritus Antony
Raubitschek, at whose funeral we recently
assisted.
A few of us are specialists in music or his
tory, but most of us are non-specialists
who've made the traditional forms of
Catholic worship part of our daily lives. After
more than 1,000 years, the texts and music
have lost none of their relevance and beauty.
You mentioned the importance of good
music but dismissed Latin (and so, by exten
sion, the entire Gregorian repertoire) as
something associated with a vaguely defined
"right-wing" agenda, with people "who'd
just as soon have women in veils."
I've directed the group quite a few times,
and as far as I recall, have never been threat
ened with repression by the right wing or told
to wear a veil.
A few of our alumnae do wear veils; they
are now contemplative nuns, vocations
which are in notoriously short supply in more
"progressive" circles.

Proposing housing solutions
Although I do not oppose the use of a
housing lottery for small matters (the nicer
view, the slightly shorter walk to campus,
etc.), the current value of a year in subsidized
campus housing is too great to justify its dis
tribution in a sweepstakes.
Having recently lost the lottery, my wife
and I will now have to pay at least $300 to
$350 more — or roughly $4,000 a year — for
a comparable off-campus apartment. This
corresponds to a pre-tax income (remember
the marriage penalty) of over $6,(XX) or in
other words, about half of my annual
stipend.
1 challenge readers to name another
industry in the world in which half of a work
er's salary is determined on a yearly basis by
random lottery.
I also challenge University President Ger
hard Casper and the Housing Services lead
ership to try making a long-term (say, four
year) budget for their own families under the
assumption that each year, with a 60 percent
probability, fully half of their post-tax
salaries will be taken from them. Wouldn't it
be better to know in advance?
Moreover, moving students on and off
campus each year is absurdly inefficient.
Apartment hunting in this area is a long and

draining process — it can easily consume all
of a student's spare time fora month. Why
force anyone to go through this more than
once?
The obvious solution — fixed number of
on-campus years: The University should
phase out the lottery and provide guaranteed
on-campus and / or nearby and heavily subsi
dized housing to all students for three years
or half the number of years of their degree
programs.
Students with children should be guaran
teed on-campus or nearby housing options
and heavily subsidized housing throughout
their stay.
Solution two — advance lottery picks:
Students who want to know in advance
where they'll stand financially if they attend
Stanford (i.e., all prospective students) could
request to have Stanford choose its lottery
numbers in advance for all five years and tell
them upfront exactly which years they will be
allowed to live on campus (there are many
ways of doing this).
Solution three — higher on-campus hous
ing rates: The revenue could then be used to
subsidize off campus housing for all students
and lower the on / off-campus gap to a level
at which the amount of available on-campus
housing would accomodate the demand. An
on-campus unit of housing is an indivisible
resource, but money is not.
Solution four — need-based housing: The
University could grant housing according to
a financial need formula based on stipend
size, spouse's income, etc.
Non-solution one — Casper's plan: Sink
an enormous amount of resources into build
ing dirt-cheap on-campus housing for S(K)
graduate students (about 7 percent) and con
tinue to ignore the needs of those with low
lottery numbers.
If the administration still believes that its
Eva Peron-style handouts to the few will
either disguise or compensate for its inability
to help the many, it is time to say. President
Casper, the game is up. We're not fooling
anybody.
We can no longer claim that lottery num
bers, as the basis of a student's right to finan
cial survival, are any less discriminatory than
other arbitrary criteria (race, eye color,
department, etc.).
In fact, they are significantly worse in that
in addition to denying us fair and equal treat
ment, they deny us something else that we all
hold dear: the right to plan our budgets and
our lives in advance.
We must reconsider the outmoded lottery
system.
None of us is free until each of us is free,
and we cannot rest until we have a proposal
that assists high-numbered and low-num
bered students alike.

Another Bookstore story
After reading Friday's article on misman
agement at the Bookstore, I thought I should
share my own "mismanagement" experience
that is particularly relevant to graduating
seniors.
I bought the obligatory graduation
announcements for my family in late April. I
was sent a reminder to pick up the package
about a week later.
When I came in, they told me that the
package had been sent to my home, as I
requested. A month later, however, my par
ents still had not received it.
When I went in a couple of days ago, they
found the package in the back room, with the
shipping orders still intact. I reported the
mistake to customer service so they could see
it other packages had received the same fate
as mine.
I suggest that all seniors waiting for pack
ages should check back at the store, even if
they told you it was in the mail.
Overall, I am extremely disappointed in
how the Bookstore handled the situation. I
had to ask about the package, they never
seemed to check the front of the package

(where il plainly displayed a shipping
receipt).
Additionally, senior announcements
serve only one temporal role. By mismanag
ing package distribution, the Bookstore
made the announcements useless. Their only
solution, for those in the same predicament,
is to refund shipping ($7).
Without direct competition in the Stan
ford announcements market, il seems that
the Bookstore takes little care of its cus
tomers.

Car dependence unnecessary
Wah-wah. how will I get to Safeway?
All around me I hear people crying out in
distress for the freshman class of 2(KK). won
dering to each other, with 110 parking, how
will their experiences at Stanford be trans
formed.
It should be indicative of something
when, by the end of the year, the number of
freshmen with cars jumps from 16 percent to
48 percent.

Why docs everyone perpetuate the illu
sion that cars make them last, when they just
keep us from discovering more efficient,
healthier modes of transportation? ( ars pro
vide too easy of a solution for people able to
afford them.
For example, a couple of weeks ago I read
in lhe Daily students ranting because the
limited parking on campus made it difficult
for them to drive from their on-campus resi
dences to class.
Does this indicate to anyone that there
are too many cars overall?
Besides, is life outside of Stanford really
so inaccessible?
For the past two years I have been living
off-campus and commuting by bike. As I ride
to school every day, I smile at other people
and feel satisfied that I can create transporta
tion with my own energy.
Forcing new students to interact with the
surrounding communities without cars may
cause people to realize that there are no
insurmountable blocks to experiencing life
outside of Stanford.
Discomfort leads to personal growth and
increased awareness of others.
Maybe in the middle of the night when
you're up doing problem sets and eraving
milk and cookies, the easiest thing is to click
a button and shift into D, but transportation
services do exist to get people on and off
campus from early to late in the day.
At any rate, the objective is merely
delayed, not denied altogether, and after
nine months the University will welcome the
freshman cars onto campus.
When 1 see gas prices go up I think good
thoughts of a world where the roads are

Defending those not yet here
The proposal to ban future freshmen
from parking their cars on campus (which
essentially bans them from having cars) has
not been met with very much vocal opposi
tion from the faculty, staff or current stu
dents. How convenient, as none of them will
be affected. There has not been any opposi
tion from those who will be affected because
they do not yet exist.
As a matter of fact, I suspect that we will
never hear from those people, because they
will have chosen to attend Harvard, UC-
Berkeley, etc. instead of Stanford. Fora Uni
versity that makes headlines when the accep
tance rate of admitted students drops by a
couple of percentage points, it's amazing to
me that Stanford would risk driving away the
16 percent of freshmen who have cars.
When I was an undergraduate, I used my
car regularly to participate in off-campus
musical organizations, to drive back occa
sionally to my hometown, to purchase vari
ous things I needed from places that were not
accessible by public transit, to attend con
certs and theaters and even to participate in
organized search efforts in the hills fora stu
dent who had been missing and later found
murdered.
No public transportation system that
exists here would have allowed me to do
those things, and Stanford undergr. Is are
too isolated from the outside world already.
In a place like Boston or New York, most
student lifestyles are possible without a car,
but in our neck of the woods, lack of a car
would prevent many students from doing the
diverse and unusual things that are usually
viewed as sought-after qualities in our
"cream of the crop" student body.
People may make the case that freshmen
do not need to do many things that require
cars and therefore cars are not really neces
sary for freshmen. The debate will not be
very vocal, as those future freshmen who
would oppose the idea will vote with their

feet (or their wheels) and choose not to
attend Stanford.
Stanford is a great university, but there
are other great universities out there as well
that either allow cars or are in less rural
areas, and Stanford is not great enough that
students will give up their cars to attend.

New parking policy flawed
When my friends and I picked up The
Daily on May 26 and saw the headline,
"Freshmen in 2(XX) will do without cars." we
asked if it was a Chappie spoof. I find this
proposal so wrought with flaws that I can
only hope it's a joke or an attempt to gener
ate student input.
Acknowledging that solving the parking
problems on campus will disadvantage some
one, here's why I believe freshmen should
not be singled out:
•This plan solves a largely upperclass
problem by taking something away from
freshmen. I think it's embarrassing that the
school would even propose such an idea. It
destroys a great part of Stanford culture —
the lack of stratification between classes.
•About half of all freshmen live in all
frosh houses. I lived in one and know that
there is a constant scramble for rides and
heavy reliance on staff cars.
Freshmen are already concentrated in
groups with few cars. To put them in groups
with no cars, except for the staffs, would
wreak havoc on life in all-frosh dormitories
(and make staffing them very unappealing).
Even freshmen in four-class dormitories
tend to form all-frosh social groups, so their
lives would be severely impacted as well.
•The very features that make Stanford
appealing to many — laid-back seclusion,
dorm-centered communities, smallish stu
dent population — also make it incredibly
stilling.
We all have to get away to shed some
stress and keep our perspective.
Impromptu weekend road trips, late
night ventures to the City or food runs to
Lyon's are not the sort of activities one can
plan in advance to arrange fora rental car or
fleet of vans.
•What about freshmen with compelling
reasons to go off campus like work, family or
regular medical needs? Will there be special
permits for them? Will this system be as suc
cessful as the disability Draw? How will this
plan affect freshman participation in East
Palo Alto tutoring programs or other activi
ties with regular off-campus destinations?
•The assurance that the first class affected
by this proposal would be informed in admis
sions information belies the administration's
awareness that this plan has extremely nega

tive consequences, so much so, that it could
be a reason to attend another school.
As a Stanford ambassador who goes to
college fairs and talks to prospective appli
cants, I can vouch for the fact that people do
consider specific campus policies and conve
niences when choosing a school. Proximity to
a city and ease of getting there are big factors
on many students' minds, particularly when
they know how suburban Stanford is. I
would not want to skew the incoming class
toward people without a desire to get off
campus.
It could turn away students from larger
cities who like Stanford's academics but want
to retain some city life. And if that's the case,
I wonder what effect it would have on diver
sity. I really believe this policy could have
far-reaching consequences that have not
been considered.
•Finally, I question how much this plan
would really solve the parking problems on
campus. I lived in Wilbur Hall and there
were always spots available on the east side.
There are definitely problems in south and
west campus, but with most freshmen con
centrated in east residences, I just don't think
this will do the job.
Even if the plan worked, it's unfair and
the consequences are unacceptable.
None of these concerns are allayed by
hundreds of thousands of dollars in extended
Marguerite hours, rental cars or fleets of cars
and vans.
Dorm programming may survive intact,
but quality of life for freshmen would plum
met.
I hope that rather than begrudgingly sup
porting this decision, students will speak up
for their future classmates who have no
voice. How would your freshman experience
have been without cars?
We've gone without this "solution" for 15
years. I hope Associate Vice Provost for
Facilities Chris Christofferson will take a
couple more to get student suggestions and
create a new, equitable plan.

Article missed religious group
I have two comments on the May 20 arti
cle "Flourishing faith."
1. Is there a hint of racism, or at least of
elitism, in the portrayal of unenlightened
Mexican immigrants ("young families ...
recently arrived within the last 10 years")
who don't share the "progressive" ideas you
attribute to Stanford Catholics?
2. There is another thriving Catholic
group in Palo Alto that was not mentioned in
the article. The community of St. Ann is an
amateur choir of about 20 and a congrega
tion of about 100. Every Sunday, we sing

Mass and Vespers in Gregorian chant and
share a meal.
We've always been closely associated
with Stanford. The group started in the early
'60s as part of the Stanford Catholic commu
nity, and it still attracts many students and
distinguished faculty members, including
Rene Girard, William Mahrt, George Brown
and the late Prof. Emeritus Antony
Raubitschek, at whose funeral we recently
assisted.
A few of us are specialists in music or his
tory, but most of us are non-specialists
who've made the traditional forms of
Catholic worship part of our daily lives. After
more than 1,000 years, the texts and music
have lost none of their relevance and beauty.
You mentioned the importance of good
music but dismissed Latin (and so, by exten
sion, the entire Gregorian repertoire) as
something associated with a vaguely defined
"right-wing" agenda, with people "who'd
just as soon have women in veils."
I've directed the group quite a few times,
and as far as I recall, have never been threat
ened with repression by the right wing or told
to wear a veil.
A few of our alumnae do wear veils; they
are now contemplative nuns, vocations
which are in notoriously short supply in more
"progressive" circles.

Proposing housing solutions
Although I do not oppose the use of a
housing lottery for small matters (the nicer
view, the slightly shorter walk to campus,
etc.), the current value of a year in subsidized
campus housing is too great to justify its dis
tribution in a sweepstakes.
Having recently lost the lottery, my wife
and I will now have to pay at least $300 to
$350 more — or roughly $4,000 a year — for
a comparable off-campus apartment. This
corresponds to a pre-tax income (remember
the marriage penalty) of over $6,(XX) or in
other words, about half of my annual
stipend.
1 challenge readers to name another
industry in the world in which half of a work
er's salary is determined on a yearly basis by
random lottery.
I also challenge University President Ger
hard Casper and the Housing Services lead
ership to try making a long-term (say, four
year) budget for their own families under the
assumption that each year, with a 60 percent
probability, fully half of their post-tax
salaries will be taken from them. Wouldn't it
be better to know in advance?
Moreover, moving students on and off
campus each year is absurdly inefficient.
Apartment hunting in this area is a long and

draining process — it can easily consume all
of a student's spare time fora month. Why
force anyone to go through this more than
once?
The obvious solution — fixed number of
on-campus years: The University should
phase out the lottery and provide guaranteed
on-campus and / or nearby and heavily subsi
dized housing to all students for three years
or half the number of years of their degree
programs.
Students with children should be guaran
teed on-campus or nearby housing options
and heavily subsidized housing throughout
their stay.
Solution two — advance lottery picks:
Students who want to know in advance
where they'll stand financially if they attend
Stanford (i.e., all prospective students) could
request to have Stanford choose its lottery
numbers in advance for all five years and tell
them upfront exactly which years they will be
allowed to live on campus (there are many
ways of doing this).
Solution three — higher on-campus hous
ing rates: The revenue could then be used to
subsidize off campus housing for all students
and lower the on / off-campus gap to a level
at which the amount of available on-campus
housing would accomodate the demand. An
on-campus unit of housing is an indivisible
resource, but money is not.
Solution four — need-based housing: The
University could grant housing according to
a financial need formula based on stipend
size, spouse's income, etc.
Non-solution one — Casper's plan: Sink
an enormous amount of resources into build
ing dirt-cheap on-campus housing for S(K)
graduate students (about 7 percent) and con
tinue to ignore the needs of those with low
lottery numbers.
If the administration still believes that its
Eva Peron-style handouts to the few will
either disguise or compensate for its inability
to help the many, it is time to say. President
Casper, the game is up. We're not fooling
anybody.
We can no longer claim that lottery num
bers, as the basis of a student's right to finan
cial survival, are any less discriminatory than
other arbitrary criteria (race, eye color,
department, etc.).
In fact, they are significantly worse in that
in addition to denying us fair and equal treat

We are continuing efforts to assure that
anyone whose charges were affected by the

reimbursed, including working to identify
purchasers who may not have reviewed their

Another Bookstore story
After reading Friday's article on misman
agement at the Bookstore, I thought I should
share my own "mismanagement" experience
that is particularly relevant to graduating
seniors.
I bought the obligatory graduation
announcements for my family in late April. I
was sent a reminder to pick up the package
about a week later.
When I came in, they told me that the
package had been sent to my home, as I
requested. A month later, however, my par
ents still had not received it.
When I went in a couple of days ago, they
found the package in the back room, with the
shipping orders still intact. I reported the
mistake to customer service so they could see
it other packages had received the same fate
as mine.
I suggest that all seniors waiting for pack
ages should check back at the store, even if
they told you it was in the mail.
Overall, I am extremely disappointed in
how the Bookstore handled the situation. I
had to ask about the package, they never
seemed to check the front of the package

(where il plainly displayed a shipping
receipt).
Additionally, senior announcements
serve only one temporal role. By mismanag
ing package distribution, the Bookstore
made the announcements useless. Their only
solution, for those in the same predicament,
is to refund shipping ($7).
Without direct competition in the Stan
ford announcements market, il seems that
the Bookstore takes little care of its cus
tomers.

Car dependence unnecessary
Wah-wah. how will I get to Safeway?
All around me I hear people crying out in
distress for the freshman class of 2(KK). won
dering to each other, with 110 parking, how
will their experiences at Stanford be trans
formed.
It should be indicative of something
when, by the end of the year, the number of
freshmen with cars jumps from 16 percent to
48 percent.

Why docs everyone perpetuate the illu
sion that cars make them last, when they just
keep us from discovering more efficient,
healthier modes of transportation? ( ars pro
vide too easy of a solution for people able to
afford them.
For example, a couple of weeks ago I read
in lhe Daily students ranting because the
limited parking on campus made it difficult
for them to drive from their on-campus resi
dences to class.
Does this indicate to anyone that there
are too many cars overall?
Besides, is life outside of Stanford really
so inaccessible?
For the past two years I have been living
off-campus and commuting by bike. As I ride
to school every day, I smile at other people
and feel satisfied that I can create transporta
tion with my own energy.
Forcing new students to interact with the
surrounding communities without cars may
cause people to realize that there are no
insurmountable blocks to experiencing life
outside of Stanford.
Discomfort leads to personal growth and
increased awareness of others.
Maybe in the middle of the night when
you're up doing problem sets and eraving
milk and cookies, the easiest thing is to click
a button and shift into D, but transportation
services do exist to get people on and off
campus from early to late in the day.
At any rate, the objective is merely
delayed, not denied altogether, and after
nine months the University will welcome the
freshman cars onto campus.
When 1 see gas prices go up I think good
thoughts of a world where the roads are
grassy.
1 applaud the administration for its deci
sion.

Defending those not yet here
The proposal to ban future freshmen
from parking their cars on campus (which
essentially bans them from having cars) has
not been met with very much vocal opposi
tion from the faculty, staff or current stu
dents. How convenient, as none of them will
be affected. There has not been any opposi
tion from those who will be affected because
they do not yet exist.
As a matter of fact, I suspect that we will
never hear from those people, because they
will have chosen to attend Harvard, UC-
Berkeley, etc. instead of Stanford. Fora Uni
versity that makes headlines when the accep
tance rate of admitted students drops by a
couple of percentage points, it's amazing to
me that Stanford would risk driving away the
16 percent of freshmen who have cars.
When I was an undergraduate, I used my
car regularly to participate in off-campus
musical organizations, to drive back occa
sionally to my hometown, to purchase vari
ous things I needed from places that were not
accessible by public transit, to attend con
certs and theaters and even to participate in
organized search efforts in the hills fora stu
dent who had been missing and later found
murdered.
No public transportation system that
exists here would have allowed me to do
those things, and Stanford undergr. Is are
too isolated from the outside world already.
In a place like Boston or New York, most
student lifestyles are possible without a car,
but in our neck of the woods, lack of a car
would prevent many students from doing the
diverse and unusual things that are usually
viewed as sought-after qualities in our
"cream of the crop" student body.
People may make the case that freshmen
do not need to do many things that require
cars and therefore cars are not really neces
sary for freshmen. The debate will not be
very vocal, as those future freshmen who
would oppose the idea will vote with their

feet (or their wheels) and choose not to
attend Stanford.
Stanford is a great university, but there
are other great universities out there as well
that either allow cars or are in less rural
areas, and Stanford is not great enough that
students will give up their cars to attend.

New parking policy flawed
When my friends and I picked up The
Daily on May 26 and saw the headline,
"Freshmen in 2(XX) will do without cars." we
asked if it was a Chappie spoof. I find this
proposal so wrought with flaws that I can
only hope it's a joke or an attempt to gener
ate student input.
Acknowledging that solving the parking
problems on campus will disadvantage some
one, here's why I believe freshmen should
not be singled out:
•This plan solves a largely upperclass
problem by taking something away from
freshmen. I think it's embarrassing that the
school would even propose such an idea. It
destroys a great part of Stanford culture —
the lack of stratification between classes.
•About half of all freshmen live in all
frosh houses. I lived in one and know that
there is a constant scramble for rides and
heavy reliance on staff cars.
Freshmen are already concentrated in
groups with few cars. To put them in groups
with no cars, except for the staffs, would
wreak havoc on life in all-frosh dormitories
(and make staffing them very unappealing).
Even freshmen in four-class dormitories
tend to form all-frosh social groups, so their
lives would be severely impacted as well.
•The very features that make Stanford
appealing to many — laid-back seclusion,
dorm-centered communities, smallish stu
dent population — also make it incredibly
stilling.
We all have to get away to shed some
stress and keep our perspective.
Impromptu weekend road trips, late
night ventures to the City or food runs to
Lyon's are not the sort of activities one can
plan in advance to arrange fora rental car or
fleet of vans.
•What about freshmen with compelling
reasons to go off campus like work, family or
regular medical needs? Will there be special
permits for them? Will this system be as suc
cessful as the disability Draw? How will this
plan affect freshman participation in East
Palo Alto tutoring programs or other activi
ties with regular off-campus destinations?
•The assurance that the first class affected
by this proposal would be informed in admis
sions information belies the administration's
awareness that this plan has extremely nega

tive consequences, so much so, that it could
be a reason to attend another school.
As a Stanford ambassador who goes to
college fairs and talks to prospective appli
cants, I can vouch for the fact that people do
consider specific campus policies and conve
niences when choosing a school. Proximity to
a city and ease of getting there are big factors
on many students' minds, particularly when
they know how suburban Stanford is. I
would not want to skew the incoming class
toward people without a desire to get off
campus.
It could turn away students from larger
cities who like Stanford's academics but want
to retain some city life. And if that's the case,
I wonder what effect it would have on diver
sity. I really believe this policy could have
far-reaching consequences that have not
been considered.
•Finally, I question how much this plan
would really solve the parking problems on
campus. I lived in Wilbur Hall and there
were always spots available on the east side.
There are definitely problems in south and
west campus, but with most freshmen con
centrated in east residences, I just don't think
this will do the job.
Even if the plan worked, it's unfair and
the consequences are unacceptable.
None of these concerns are allayed by
hundreds of thousands of dollars in extended
Marguerite hours, rental cars or fleets of cars
and vans.
Dorm programming may survive intact,
but quality of life for freshmen would plum
met.
I hope that rather than begrudgingly sup
porting this decision, students will speak up
for their future classmates who have no
voice. How would your freshman experience
have been without cars?
We've gone without this "solution" for 15
years. I hope Associate Vice Provost for
Facilities Chris Christofferson will take a
couple more to get student suggestions and
create a new, equitable plan.

Article missed religious group
I have two comments on the May 20 arti
cle "Flourishing faith."
1. Is there a hint of racism, or at least of
elitism, in the portrayal of unenlightened
Mexican immigrants ("young families ...
recently arrived within the last 10 years")
who don't share the "progressive" ideas you
attribute to Stanford Catholics?
2. There is another thriving Catholic
group in Palo Alto that was not mentioned in
the article. The community of St. Ann is an
amateur choir of about 20 and a congrega
tion of about 100. Every Sunday, we sing

Mass and Vespers in Gregorian chant and
share a meal.
We've always been closely associated
with Stanford. The group started in the early
'60s as part of the Stanford Catholic commu
nity, and it still attracts many students and
distinguished faculty members, including
Rene Girard, William Mahrt, George Brown
and the late Prof. Emeritus Antony
Raubitschek, at whose funeral we recently
assisted.
A few of us are specialists in music or his
tory, but most of us are non-specialists
who've made the traditional forms of
Catholic worship part of our daily lives. After
more than 1,000 years, the texts and music
have lost none of their relevance and beauty.
You mentioned the importance of good
music but dismissed Latin (and so, by exten
sion, the entire Gregorian repertoire) as
something associated with a vaguely defined
"right-wing" agenda, with people "who'd
just as soon have women in veils."
I've directed the group quite a few times,
and as far as I recall, have never been threat
ened with repression by the right wing or told
to wear a veil.
A few of our alumnae do wear veils; they
are now contemplative nuns, vocations
which are in notoriously short supply in more
"progressive" circles.

Proposing housing solutions
Although I do not oppose the use of a
housing lottery for small matters (the nicer
view, the slightly shorter walk to campus,
etc.), the current value of a year in subsidized
campus housing is too great to justify its dis
tribution in a sweepstakes.
Having recently lost the lottery, my wife
and I will now have to pay at least $300 to
$350 more — or roughly $4,000 a year — for
a comparable off-campus apartment. This
corresponds to a pre-tax income (remember
the marriage penalty) of over $6,(XX) or in
other words, about half of my annual
stipend.
1 challenge readers to name another
industry in the world in which half of a work
er's salary is determined on a yearly basis by
random lottery.
I also challenge University President Ger
hard Casper and the Housing Services lead
ership to try making a long-term (say, four
year) budget for their own families under the
assumption that each year, with a 60 percent
probability, fully half of their post-tax
salaries will be taken from them. Wouldn't it
be better to know in advance?
Moreover, moving students on and off
campus each year is absurdly inefficient.
Apartment hunting in this area is a long and

draining process — it can easily consume all
of a student's spare time fora month. Why
force anyone to go through this more than
once?
The obvious solution — fixed number of
on-campus years: The University should
phase out the lottery and provide guaranteed
on-campus and / or nearby and heavily subsi
dized housing to all students for three years
or half the number of years of their degree
programs.
Students with children should be guaran
teed on-campus or nearby housing options
and heavily subsidized housing throughout
their stay.
Solution two — advance lottery picks:
Students who want to know in advance
where they'll stand financially if they attend
Stanford (i.e., all prospective students) could
request to have Stanford choose its lottery
numbers in advance for all five years and tell
them upfront exactly which years they will be
allowed to live on campus (there are many
ways of doing this).
Solution three — higher on-campus hous
ing rates: The revenue could then be used to
subsidize off campus housing for all students
and lower the on / off-campus gap to a level
at which the amount of available on-campus
housing would accomodate the demand. An
on-campus unit of housing is an indivisible
resource, but money is not.
Solution four — need-based housing: The
University could grant housing according to
a financial need formula based on stipend
size, spouse's income, etc.
Non-solution one — Casper's plan: Sink
an enormous amount of resources into build
ing dirt-cheap on-campus housing for S(K)
graduate students (about 7 percent) and con
tinue to ignore the needs of those with low
lottery numbers.
If the administration still believes that its
Eva Peron-style handouts to the few will
either disguise or compensate for its inability
to help the many, it is time to say. President
Casper, the game is up. We're not fooling
anybody.
We can no longer claim that lottery num
bers, as the basis of a student's right to finan
cial survival, are any less discriminatory than
other arbitrary criteria (race, eye color,
department, etc.).
In fact, they are significantly worse in that
in addition to denying us fair and equal treat
ment, they deny us something else that we all
hold dear: the right to plan our budgets and
our lives in advance.
