# Breathing Lessons
## The 						genealogy of murals 
### 
April Van Scherpe

SOMEWHERE ON
the Row. there is a
house with two extra
windows. You wouldn't
know it just passing by.
( ountless bikers, wayward
tourists and perhaps even
an administrator or two

have traversed Mayfield Avenue and never
noticed a thing. No one can see them from
the outside.
The first window sprang up last quarter,
born unceremoniously of dull graphite on a
scrap of heavy drawing paper, then the
sketch ctupt onto the Avail, and two
later the most poetic sight at 553 was the
artist sweeping broad blue strokes across the
standard issue, residential white nothingness.
Today, if you walk into 553 Mayfield's
second floor double on the Columbae side,
you'll see one irompe I'ocil portal pointing
you towards a blazing sunset on some far
away beach. The other window, exhaled like
an encore after resounding applause, reveals
the beach at night.
()ne glance away from the mural and into
any day planner makes students reel with the
stunned realization that the year is ending.
There are non-calendrical signs, as well.
From a distance, the foothills look like a
vinaigrette jar as nature floats thick yellow
layers ol mustard flowers on top. Fro-yo tol
erance is approaching the maximum. Stu
dents buy cases of Crystal Geyser for the
packing boxes, not the water. We're finally
paying our phone bills.
Even if debts, exams and shipping fees
dampen the last few moments of the school

year, leaving Stanford will be a little like
waking up from a very pleasant dream.
Although your last view of your hallmate
may be a pungent, food-crusted, wild-haired
blur of a study beast who scarfs down three
rancid Snickers bars before holing back up in
the Den of Caffeine, it will be your last view.
Most of us forgot to psyche ourselves up for
the end of the chapter; much is left undone.
Part of the disappointment of leaving is
that, fora little while, the creative force that
is 6,(KK) vibrant minds will disband. When we
scatter to homes, jobs and vacations, what
will replace for us the chalky sidewalk poet
ry of mysterious nightly author Ashen, or the
random strokes of genius like a /uijiur mac/w
cartoon sub in for our absent Thinker?
And as the year ends, so go with it all of
the little stories and fragments of memories
wound lip in a year of close proximity,
scholastic anguish and unexpected joy. We
will forget most of the details. And when we
forget, we will wonder just what it was that
moved us from being the people who
unpacked in the fall to the changed people
packing it all up next week. Our lives, each
moment that comprised the year, have made
us different and, for the most part, better.
It's impossible to remember every tortur
ous problem set. every 2 a.m. cup of coffee,
every kiss at Full Moon on the Ouad. every
live-digit phone call or every pajama'd
philosopher that changed you over the past
year; memory leaves a few remnants behind
in the form of new philosophies and revela
tions. You might not remember the argu
ment. but you learned that honor and
respectability have no correlation whatsoev
er to inheritance or intelligence. You might

not care to recall the face, but you learned
that friends fall into three categories — con
venient. casual and die hard — and that next
year only the latter will ask you first
your summer, not your car. You learned that
people are inherently generous, except when
you're looking for laundry quarters. And you
learned that. ves. there ARE snakes in the
foothills.
Life lessons emerge from our moments
here, and a few tales remain yet untold. I
wonder about Ashen — in producing podry
for us. did s/he ever get caught? What was it
like to run home in a cloud of chalk dust? Or
to emerge one morning to find your words
mottled in an assault of rain? What is each of
those stories that no one remembers but
which mattered so much?
In 553. the story went like this. Barefoot
and paint-splattered atop an empty bed
frame, the artist filled a blank room with the
smell of acrylics, the sound of masking tape
unveiling a horizon and eventually, a congre
gation of the curious who came to watch, talk
and try their own hands at a hobby long for
gotten. They finger painted, they laughed,
and they got to know each other. Once again,
a window appeared where there had been
none before — between people.
In this story, there is a happy ending. The
details of its creation may fade, but hopeful
ly, the mural will remain.

Help lis convince Housing Services to pre
serve the mural at 553 by sending an email to
(ivansche@lelcm(l. The artist is Yana Green
stein. Thanks to my readers, my friends and a
few who have, since the start of this column,
become both.
