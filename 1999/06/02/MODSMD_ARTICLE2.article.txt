Naked and nude are distinc
tive terms in the Studio Art De
partment at Stanford.
Richard Randall, professor of
Art and Art History at Stanford,
teaches Art 50, Clay Modeling:
The Figure, in Stanford's Studio
Art Department. "There's a dif
ference between naked and nude.
In this class we have nude mod
els," Randall said.
The students, initially unfamil
iar with creating art based on
nude models, gradually become
comfortable with the subjects of
their artwork.
"We need a nude model to op
erate. like we need a table or a
chair to operate," Randall said.
Casey Alt. a senior who has
created art based on nude mod
els, said the nudity was not an
issue for him. "You get lost in the
technicality of the artwork. It's
more about the art than it is about
looking at a nude person." Alt
said. "You know they're not
there to put on a show for you.
They are super-professional."
Mary Ann Wiesinger. a sopho
more in Art 50, said she really en
joyed the class, "because you can
see shapes and dimensions you
don't normally see with clothes.
It's really important to be able to
see flexing, relaxing, movement,
muscles, shapes and dimen
sions."
If nude modeling sounds like
easy work, it is not. "They work
really hard to give you a good
pose, and it's amazing how long

thcv can sit and hold the pose,"
Alt said.
Randall did some nude model
ing in college and said thai while
it doesn't pay a lot of money, it's
a lot of work. "Standing, holding
a pose for two hours or more,
pretty soon your feet go to sleep,
or your hip hones go to sleep, or
you get a cramp," Randall said.
Many conservative areas in
the United States would not he
comfortable bringing nude mod
els into an art studio, according to
Randall, who attended a conserv
ative college in Minnesota where
nude models had to wear tights.
"I tried to get around that, and 1
had a model come in their under
wear. I almost got fired for that,"
Randall said.
The models brought to Stan
ford for Art 50 during the past 15
to 20 years are from the Palo Alto
Models Guild.
Randall said studio art nude
modeling is more about project
ing an aura of energy than it is
about having a calendar art body
to model after.
"Some of the most interesting
models we bring in have absurd,
sculpturally interesting propor
tions. The last thing you want is a
calendar art model. They're real
ly boring," said Randall. "One of
the most interesting models we've
had looked like a spider with real
ly skinny legs and a big body."
Randall explained the quali
ties that are evident in good mod
els. "They have charisma or per
sonal projection that makes them
a delight to work with. First you
have to get at ease with the

model, and then you begin to no
tice the interesting qualities
about them."
Randall asks his students to go
beyond the physicality of the
nude model they are shaping
their clay after, and to find quali

ties in the model to express in
their art.
"You have to learn to imitate
the model. After that you have to
learn how to invent artwork that
is relevant to the model." Randall
said.
