RESPIRAR" Jose tells
K M me. He takes a breath and grins. He
isn't nervous, just teasing me. Our
paths converged while I was in El Salvador
doing research for my honors thesis last sum
mer. We became friends, and it is with his
permission that I share his story here.
1977
Jose was born in Quezaltepeque, El Sal
vador, on Sept. 6, 1977. He was the oldest of
six children. His parents had problems, and
his mother often lied with him to stay with
family members in both urban and rural
zones of the municipality. At one point she
moved in with another man, but then
returned to his father.
***
On Sept. 14, 1977, / entered the world with
scrawny legs, pigeon toes, a pointy head and
jaundiced skin. My father, a novice in new
born aesthetics, pasted the nickname "Chick
en " upon my fragile identity.
"I only wanted to give you back during the
first couple of weeks," he grins mischievously.
"Don't listen to him," says my mother, "he
would wake you up every night just to parade
you around to visitors."
1980
"Nunca tuve un hogar estable," Jose tells
me. (I never had a stable home.) His mother
saved up and eventually managed to open a
post selling vegetables in the informal merca
do. "I didn't even have a cradle," he tells me,
"I slept in a shopping basket."
"There is no way to compare the mind of
un niho del mercado" a child of the market,
"to that of un nino de casaa child of the
house, he explains. "For an niho del mercado
there is no Santa Claus, no stork.

For the first three years of my life we lived
in a comfortable white house in Los Altos,
California. After the birth of my first brother,
my next concrete memory of our little white

house was one evening when I found myself
sitting amidst all of my belongings. A moving
van pulled up, some mean man took my toys
and my parents deposited me into my car seat
and drove me to our new house, a mile away.
1988
The day Jose's mother took him away
from his father for the last time was the day
he entered the gangs. He was 9 and a half
years old. The gang he entered was based in
the market where he helped his mother. At
that time, he says, "gangs didn't kill. Rather,
they grabbed you, beat you and made you
join in order for the gang to grow... Now
they have to kill or it is an embarrassment."
***
The very act of growing up with the last
name Wiener was probably the hardest single
task of my first decade. It is hard to say
whether constant taunts made me into a
hypersensitive child or whether my innate
hypersensitivity doomed me to interpret every
childish rhyme as a fundamental attack. With
the additional burden of sex education, fifth
grade became the most emotionally trying
year of my elementary school career.
1991
Things changed in 1991, Jose remembers
vividly, when he was 12 and a half years old.
That year, he says,"a brother' came from
Los Angeles to begin the rotting of Quezal
tepeque. He came deported. He came ruined
from the Eighteen of L.A."
Marco, "El Peluco," told Jose and his
friends that he belonged to the Barrio Eigh
teen and that 'i am going to teach you what
a real gang is." With that, Jose participated in
the first "bautismo" in Quezaltepeque.
Marco and four other deported gang mem
bers kicked him and beat him. When they
were done, Jose was initiated into the Eigh
teen and began to "baptize" others.

I// the junior high school context I still

melted for smiles from my popular ex-best
friends. I was silently chagrined by the social
ineptness of some of the girls with whom I
hung out during lunch recess. In 1991, when I
was in the eighth grade, I had my Bat Mitz
vah, a Jewish coming-of-age ceremony. I
stood in front of my family and friends and
gave my first public speech. They showered
me with attention I craved and gifts I didn 't
need.
1993
The first time Jose used a knife "not for
apples or oranges but for people" he was 13
years old. As its littlest member, the gang
would send him ahead on his bike, knife in
hand. "Like the devil," he says,"I was bap
tized with other people's blood." In 1993, at
age 17, Jose began to buy weapons. That
year, "El Diablo," a member of the Mara
Salvatrucha (the rival gang of the Eighteen),
was deported to Quezaltepeque. The fight
ing was getting more serious. Jose received
orders to kill, referred to as "los verdes."
***
Every day when I rode my bike home
from junior high, my classmate Loni would
try and convince my best friends to ride off
and ditch me. So I suppose that it was not until
the ninth grade that the taste of confidence
really began to solidify on my tongue. It came
when I realized my own capacity to give.
When I was almost 17,1 sold ruby red grape
fruits to my next-door neighbors in order to
pay for two months administering immuniza
tions in Paraguay.
1995
By the time Jose was 18, Marco "El Pelu
co" had been murdered in prison. More and
more members of the Eighteen began to die.
When all but two of its original members
were dead, Jose became in charge. He was by
now famous in both the prison and the gang.
"When I stabbed someone," he tells me, "I
licked the blood off of the knife."

"Brothers came to me shot and crying.
They began to die. It makes me sad ... they
went with the devil." He remembers one
boy, "El Repollito." "I watched him enter
the gang, and on Feb. 14,1 watched him die.
1 wish we had all gone to jail, then my 'broth
er 1 wouldn't have died."
***
When I look back on my freshman year at
Stanford, what gets called up first is the rather
painfid daily interaction I had with my room
mate. There was a series of frat parties I pre
tended to enjoy. February Nth was another
Valentine's Day spent mourning the absence
of flowers, chocolates or, at very least, a soul
mate. In my freshman writing class, I did my
first Stanford research paper on effective
methods of gang intervention.

"Everybody wanted me dead," Jose
explains, "but the bullets never touched me."
He was sent to prison three times for rob
bery. When he got out, he began to use drugs
and drink even more heavily. One day, he
saw a woman with a chain on her neck and
got on a bus to rob her. He changed his mind
and got off without touching her. But a man
got off after him, and pulled out a knife. He
slashed Jose in the throat, missing the jugular
by only half a centimeter. Jose was sent to
the hospital, where he received 20 stitches.
When he left the hospital, he says, "1 would
do everything necessary to kill el sehor ... I
never encountered him. I was going to cut off
his testicles and give them to his family as a
gift." This was three years ago, Aug. 4,19%.
***
The summer after my freshman year, I
taught for six weeks in a summer school pro
gram at my old high school, my first paid job.
On Aug. I, 1996, one of the teachers involved
with the program told me that my casual
demeanor and punchy sense of humor were
the reason that sexism still existed. In tears, I
repeated the story to my family as we got on

an airplane for Costa Rica. Expletives fol
lowed.
***
On Aug. 30,1996. Jose was running in the
market with a bomb in his hand, poised to
kill another boy. "I was kissing the grenade,
calling it 'linda' and 'mi amor.' 1 showed it to
my friends, told them it had to kill someone
from the MS." He walked some 20 steps but
for some reason could not throw the
grenade. It exploded, and Jose stood up.
"My brother-in-law sat looking at me,
shocked. Finally he screamed, There is
blood pouring from your arm!' 1 only
remember yelling, 'Ay, mi manof There
were not even fingers there, only parts of
bones."
1999
On June 13, the day I graduate, Stanford
University is going to tell me that 1 am the
future of the country, and in today's global
reality, perhaps the future of the world. And
the diploma they place in my hand on that
day will indeed be a potent weapon.
June 13th will also mark the two-year
anniversary of the week Jose pulled himself
out of a cycle of violence in which I. indirect
ly, play a part. Since that time, he has begun
doing outreach work with members of the
Eighteenth Street gang in the local prison
where he was incarcerated three times.
The tlipside of the system that is privileg
ing me is the system that is brutalizing Jose.
As long as Stanford University gauges its
success in terms of what it has done for the
privileged few, it is passively condoning a
merciless life for the many.
1 do not only question what I have gotten
out of my four years here. I question what
Jose has gotten out of them. I do not only
question why I have deserved to be here. I
question why Jose has not.
