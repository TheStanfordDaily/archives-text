# Stanford students respond to recent racist e-mail
## 
### 
Ihe brainpower at this University is
amazing. People have an immense capacity
loi understanding, seeing connections and
thinking critically. Why. then, does our
administration fail to recognize the connec
tions between a possible Labor Department
investigation of hiring and promotion prac
tices. former I aw I'rol. Linda Mabry's resig
nation from the Law School, Native Ameri
can Asst. I nglish Prof. Robert Warrior's
tenure denial, a hunger strike for ethnic stud
ies at IJC Berkeley, labor historian Karen
Sawislak's decision to leave and not go
through another tenure battle, black lesbian
feminist Asst. I nglish Prof. Sharon I lol
land's decision to leave and the racist e-mail
sent out this weekend?
All these in the past five months. Count
them. I IVI As much as the administration
would like to believe, these events are not
isolated.
Add to these the innumerable events I've
seen during my four years at Stanford. You'd
think that we'd have come somewhere.
Indeed, we got lull time directors for the
Women's ( enter and LGBCC We got the
Program in Comparative Studies in Race
and Lthnicity. We fought five years and
finally got ramps and an elevator to some of
Ihe communit) centers. Hut I've also seen
many tenure battles, "chinks suck" scribbled
in the Asian American Activities Center,
homophobic grafitti at the Bollards eating
club, the suicide of ;i queer ( hicana English
professor. Ihe withet ing away ol the Stanford
( entei loi ( hicana/o Research, the disman
tling ol the I ood Research Institute and the
appointment «>1 former (iov. Pete Wilson as
a I loover fellow.
When we arc supposedly a University on
the cutting edge, why do we deprioriti/e
work against racism, sexism and homopho
bia.' Why don't we take the opportunity to
pioneei innovative research on these issues?
lo train ourselves, the future leaders of
Amciica. to ileal effectively and construc
tively with these "isms"? Why does it take a
racist and inflammatory e mail for the Stan
lord administration to call a community
meeting? Why does it take students hunger
striking and getting arrested before the UC-
Berkeley administration will listen?
I challenge University President Gerhard
Casper, Provost elect John Itennessy, Vice
Piovost for Student Alfiars James Montoya
and Dean ol Students Marc Wais to see the
connections between all these events. To see
that these are all reasons loi people of color,
women and i|ueer people to stay away from
Stanford. And to lake initiative to prevent
lurthei similar incidents.
I his means more than simply tracking
clown the author of the e-mail. I his means
working consistently and proactively to hire
and retain faculty of color and women; to
encourage innovative scholarship in ethnic
studies queei studies. Southeast Asian stud
ies. Islamic Studies; to confront race and
gcndei and sexuality and disability in our
dormitories in meaningful ways; to attract
and train graduate students who will them
selves be excellent and innovative scholars.
Stanford cannot be a premiere university if it
continues to address these issues only in cri
sis.
It is timc for the new cleans and provost to
lake a true leadership role and reflect on
what they can do to pro actively combat
i acism, sexism and homophobia on this cam
pus.
When I come back in the fall. I want to
sec new initiatives and policies, because I am
tired, and I do not want to go on a hunger
strike. I do not want to take over a building,
I do not want to spend my academic time
lighting for the right to be here, the right to
have professors who do not look like me (I
am white) or the right to study Southeast
Asian or Native American literature or Chi
cana/os on the border.
I know deep down that this will not hap
pen. So I challenge my fellow students to
hold the administrators accountable to this.
Ask them what they are doing, push them to
take action and join me and others when we
need to make noise because they are not
mo\ ing. Join a race dialogue, learn about the
Stanford Center for Chieatia/o Research or
work with incoming Provost Hennessy to
understand the connections between recent
tenure denials and the general climate for
underrepresented groups at Stanford.

I felt troubled and saddened when I left
the meeting called by Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James Montoya and the Student
Affairs ()ffice on Sunday night. The content
of the racist e-mail that had been sent to sev
eral Stanford addresses a day and a half ear
lier had upset students much more than I had

anticipated. It was touching to witness their
frustrations, unci it was educational to hear
their concerns. They seemed, for the most
part, people who had devoted a lot of their
time and energy to addressing issues related
to race and ethnicity.
It was my impression, however, that Stan
lord came under unwarranted criticism from
some of the meeting's participants. The Uni
versity, it was suggested, does not do enough
lo promote diversity on campus, this fact,
ironically, was thrown in the face of people
who obviously cared about the issue at least
as much as those members in the audience
who were voicing their criticism.
We should not lose sight of the fact that
Stanford has already done a lot to address
racism on campus. While the measures taken
may be far from perfect. I believe that it is
the responsibility of each one of us. not just

the administration's, to create a safe, hate
free environment for ourselves. It takes per
sonal effort to do so. and the fact that so few
students came on Sunday to the meeting
shows that we still care too little to make that
effort. The llniversity can initiate I.(XH) pro
grams to promote diversity, they will have no
impact if only a few concerned students
attend them. Discussions about ethnicity do
not only affect ethnic minorities but indeed
all of us. so the next time you see a liver
advertising a talk at the Black Community
Services Center, go and check it out for your
sell The next time you arc given the chance
to express your views on a wall in White
Plaza, do .not deface it with worthless com
ments. Ihe next time you hear about a dance
at Casa Zapata, head over there and make
some new friends.
Constructively approaching people that
seem different from us helps us discover how
similar we all are. As a student of ethnic con
flict. I know that bridging gaps is not easy to
do. and as a Stanford student. I realize that
devoting time to activities not directly relat
ed to our fields can be difficult. I lowcver. we
owe it to ourselves to try to become
acquainted with, and respectful of. people
who are different from us, thereby making of
this University a home for all its students.

We write this letter in response to the
recent racist e-mail that was widely circulat
ed on campus. First and foremost, we would
like to emphasize that the nature of the e
mail is such that people of color are not the
only victims. The Web site link on the e
mail contained racist. anti-Semitic and
homophobic language. It also touches the
white community by purporting to be writ
ten on its behalf. Moreover, it attempts to
divide the communities of color by claiming
to be on behalf of the Asian community.
University President Gerhard Casper, in
his campus e-mail, mentioned that the
meeting on Sunday night was for the "Stan
ford community, especially those that were
the target of the e-mail." Why was he excus
ing white and Asian-American students
from being targets of this e-mail's message?
Racism and intolerance are not problems
that rest solely with communities of color,
and the burden of combating these issues
should not be entirely incumbent upon
them. Racism and intolerance arc every
body's problems, and all communities need
to be part of the solution.
I Jnfortunately, this heinous act is not an

isolated incident. T his is but one of a num
ber of hate crimes that have occurred on
campus over the past few years. Does the
administration remember "chinks suck"
written in the Asian American Activities
Center's meeting room? What about "all
fags should die" etched into a table at the
Suites' eating clubs? And what came of the
IW4 Flicks incident where moviegoers
screamed "go home, beaners!" after the
showing of a "No Grapes" film? What fol
lowed these incidents? Yes, some students
were censured, but what strides were made
to prevent similar (or worse) occurrences
from happening again? What actions were
taken to educate people about racism and
homophobia? In the past few years we have
seen and experienced some visible action by
the administration. This action, unfortu
nately, has only been temporary and the

administrative support fades as initial
responses fade. Consequently, the Stanford
campus is left unchanged. No sustained
institutional transformations transpire.
Reactive action on the part of students and
administration does not result in necessary,
sustained change. T his most recent incident
has merely blown the dust off of long-stand
ing issues, issues that can only be remedied
with proactive, institutional change.
Principally, the I 'niversity administra
tion must understand that it is crucial for
them to show a commitment toward diver
sity on all levels of the Stanford campus. If
its aim is to produce educated and well
rounded leaders, its primary objective must
be to introduce students to an accurate
cross-section of the world beyond Stanford.
This world — the real world — is com
prised ol people of all races, ethnicities and
sexual orientations.
A large part of this change entails diver
sifying the faculty and (enuring women and
people of color. The current standards by
which professors' work is judged, however,
is highly biased. Opinions about what is
excellent teaching and scholasticallv accom
plished do not respect the efforts by profes
sors who work on issues that are seen to be
outside of the hegemonic mainstream. T he
acceptance of diversity in this institution
should merit equal importance in setting
high standards. These truths have already
been painfully realized with the denial of
tenure to professors like former Asst. His
tory Prof. Karen Sawislak and Asst. English
Prof. Robert Warrior. Without efforts to
support the cause of diversity and research
that aims to challenge the historical institu
tionalization of racism in our society,
women, students and professors of color
will never be welcomed as full members.
Furthermore, because residences are at
the core of student community, discussion
of race and ethnicity should be central to
Residential Education. Additionally,
human and financial support need to be gar
nered for ethnic centers and to expand eth
nic studies. For the preceding to be realized,
it is necessary to have an administration that
is responsive to students' needs. On that
note, the racist e-mail should at the very
least emphasize the salience of these issues.
Ultimately, we want to encourage ALL stu
dents to become informed and proactive.
We thank the Office of Student Affairs
and the Vice-Provost for organizing the
meeting on Sunday night. We also applaud
some recent efforts at diversity, such as the
hiring of full-time directors at the LGBCC
and the Women's Center. However, we

would additionally welcome the opportuni
ty to meet with President Casper to further
discuss these important issues.
We remind faculty, students and stall
that this is our University. We have a
responsibility to educate one another to cre
ate an environment that is conducive to stu
dent success. Successful graduates, in turn,
strengthen the University, create responsi
ble citizenry and ensure that racism does
not continue to permeate society. II we lail
to accomplish this, the University is tailing
to educate us.

An incident occurred this weekend that
sent a wave ol shock and outrage across
Stanford I 'niversity. On Saturday morning
an as of yet unidentified individual sent a
racist, inflammatory c mail targeting gradu
ate students of color to as many as 30.0(H)
leland account users. Specifically, it accused
African Americans and I .atinos of receiving
"preferential treatment" in the graduate
student housing lottery "because [ofj the
color of their skin.'' In addition, this e-mail
encouraged divisiveness among students on
campus, stating that white students and
Asian students should "stand up and light
for what's right." I his is a direct affront to
all students by suggesting that some mem
bers of the Stanford communit) are not a
welcomed and valued part of the Universi
ty.
As African-American and I atino gradu
ate students at Stanford, we are outraged
and disgusted by this direct attack upon us
both personally and collectively. In addition
we are similarly appalled that a valued
member of the community. Prisdha Dhar
ma. has allegedly been falsely targeted as
the source of this e-mail. Truly we recognize
that as a community when one member is
victimized we all suffer. ()ur hope is that as
we struggle to reconcile this incident per
sonally and collectively we will remember
all of the individuals affected.
In light of this hateful act, we intend to;
1) Endorse the University's continued expe
dient attention to this incident; 2) Illustrate
the broader context from which this inci
dent erupted; and 3) Provide recommenda
tions for future I 'niversity action.
From the moment students, faculty and
staff received this e-mail, we have experi
enced feelings of violation. Students, staff
and faculty met on Sunday with Vice
Provost Jim Montoya and other key student
affairs administrators. At this meeting,
many individuals expressed their concerns
about the incident and Jacqueline Wender,
assistant to the president, shared portions of
University President Gerhard Casper's let
ter denouncing the incident.
However, while Casper's response con
veyed his sense of outrage, his noticeable
absence from Sunday's meeting suggests a
lack of personal investment in this issue.
Several students present asked about the
absence of Casper. While Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Jim Montoya asserted that
he was the initiator of the meeting and felt
personally compelled to meet on Sunday,
the president's lack of appearance at the
meeting was never fully explained. I he hol
iday weekend may have made it awkward
for some people to attend the meeting, but
we feel that the president has a responsibil
ity to this community. Many administrators
were there and served as "representatives"
for the president, but given the severity of
this situation what was most needed was not
micro-management but LEADERSHIP.
This was a time of crisis, and our president
was not there.
In his statement regarding this incident
Casper urged the Stanford community "to
be particularly careful before generalizing
from an incident like this." While we agree
that caution is necessary, it is important to
expose the reality that this is not an isolated
incident. We need only look at recent
events to sec that for many people, issues of
intolerance are a daily reality on this cam
pus. The irresponsible comments on the
Leadership 2(HH) "Race and Ethnicity" wall
in White Plaza illustrate this trend. T he low
percentage of tenure among women and
faculty of color, as well as the current
inquiry by the U.S. Department of Labor
into the t Jniversity's tenure policy also high
light this issue. Additionally, the perceived
transition from a centralized institutional

commitment to affirmative action to a
decentralized system of departmentally
defined "diversity" underscores the prob
lem further. These facts raise doubt about
the central coordination of the University's
commitment to the recruitment AND
retention of graduate students from histori
cally underrepresented groups.
We share in the anger and outrage of the
entire Stanford ommunity regarding this act
of violence against the campus as a whole,
and African-American and Latino graduate
students in particular. The incident must be
used to compel each and every member of
this community to initiate and participate in
open and honest dialogue about the envi
ronment that allowed for such hatred to be
expressed.
In order to create a more tolerant and
inclusive community, we call on all mem
bers of Stanford to address the following:
1. The racism of Saturday's e-mail and
the climate from which it arose is not simply
an issue for students of color but a problem
that affects ALL community members.
2. The First Amendment protects free
dom of speech, but with this right comes
responsibility. We urge all members of this
community to exercise this responsibility to
create a new community climate in which
there is support, encouragement and appre
ciation of diversity and the richness it brings
to the prestige of our institution. Moreover,
a clear and decisive policy regarding hate
speech must be outlined and defended by
the I 'diversity.
3. We want to emphasize that the issue of
racism is clear in this act of hate speech and
must not get lost under the rhetoric of crim
inal computer-usage violations. The individ
uals who received this e-mail must be
appraised of their rights in regard to filing
charges against the writer(s) of this act of
hatred.
4. The housing shortage affecting gradu
ate students appears to have been the impe
tus for this particular destructive e-mail.
I his reality shows the need for the Univer
sity to deal more efficiently with issues
affecting graduate students. While the Uni
versity has recently begun construction of
additional graduate housing on campus, has
increased some of the graduate student
stipends and has taken steps to provide lim
ited subsidies for off campus housing, this
incident underscores that there is still more
that must be done. Until graduate students
are supported as a more integral part of this
institution, dissatisfaction and hostility may
continue to rise.
The circumstances outlined throughout
this letter point to Stanford's need to con
tinue efforts to provide a more proactive
approach to maintaining an inclusive com
munity. While there are dedicated individu
als and supportive spaces at Stanford, the
University must remain vigilant in develop
ing a comprehensive and integrated
approach to addressing issues of race, eth
nicity, gender and sexuality in all areas of
campus life.
While some individuals may feel that we I
are over-analyzing this situation, we must!
emphasize that the racist e-mail did not!
occur in isolation of other issues on this
campus. As students of color, we do not
have the privilege of allowing this act to
pass without response. NO ONE can be
silent. NO ONE should have the privilege
to be silent. If we value our humanity, if we 1
value our community, then the time to act is •
NOW. As a graduate student coalition, we
urge faculty to voice their outrage and act
with us. We urge staff to voice their outrage
and act with us. We urge students OF ALL
RACES to voice their outrage and act with
us.
Stanford's excellence depends upon
every individual's commitment to building
community.

An incident occurred this weekend that
sent a wave ol shock and outrage across
Stanford I 'niversity. On Saturday morning
an as of yet unidentified individual sent a
racist, inflammatory c mail targeting gradu
ate students of color to as many as 30.0(H)
leland account users. Specifically, it accused
African Americans and I .atinos of receiving
"preferential treatment" in the graduate
student housing lottery "because [ofj the
color of their skin.'' In addition, this e-mail
encouraged divisiveness among students on
campus, stating that white students and
Asian students should "stand up and light
for what's right." I his is a direct affront to
all students by suggesting that some mem
bers of the Stanford communit) are not a
welcomed and valued part of the Universi
ty.
As African-American and I atino gradu
ate students at Stanford, we are outraged
and disgusted by this direct attack upon us
both personally and collectively. In addition
we are similarly appalled that a valued
member of the community. Prisdha Dhar
ma. has allegedly been falsely targeted as
the source of this e-mail. Truly we recognize
that as a community when one member is
victimized we all suffer. ()ur hope is that as
we struggle to reconcile this incident per
sonally and collectively we will remember
all of the individuals affected.
In light of this hateful act, we intend to;
1) Endorse the University's continued expe
dient attention to this incident; 2) Illustrate
the broader context from which this inci
dent erupted; and 3) Provide recommenda
tions for future I 'niversity action.
From the moment students, faculty and
staff received this e-mail, we have experi
enced feelings of violation. Students, staff
and faculty met on Sunday with Vice
Provost Jim Montoya and other key student
affairs administrators. At this meeting,
many individuals expressed their concerns
about the incident and Jacqueline Wender,
assistant to the president, shared portions of
University President Gerhard Casper's let
ter denouncing the incident.
However, while Casper's response con
veyed his sense of outrage, his noticeable
absence from Sunday's meeting suggests a
lack of personal investment in this issue.
Several students present asked about the
absence of Casper. While Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Jim Montoya asserted that
he was the initiator of the meeting and felt
personally compelled to meet on Sunday,
the president's lack of appearance at the
meeting was never fully explained. I he hol
iday weekend may have made it awkward
for some people to attend the meeting, but
we feel that the president has a responsibil
ity to this community. Many administrators
were there and served as "representatives"
for the president, but given the severity of
this situation what was most needed was not
micro-management but LEADERSHIP.
This was a time of crisis, and our president
was not there.
In his statement regarding this incident
Casper urged the Stanford community "to
be particularly careful before generalizing
from an incident like this." While we agree
that caution is necessary, it is important to
expose the reality that this is not an isolated
incident. We need only look at recent
events to sec that for many people, issues of
intolerance are a daily reality on this cam
pus. The irresponsible comments on the
Leadership 2(HH) "Race and Ethnicity" wall
in White Plaza illustrate this trend. T he low
percentage of tenure among women and
faculty of color, as well as the current
inquiry by the U.S. Department of Labor
into the t Jniversity's tenure policy also high
light this issue. Additionally, the perceived
transition from a centralized institutional

commitment to affirmative action to a
decentralized system of departmentally
defined "diversity" underscores the prob
lem further. These facts raise doubt about
the central coordination of the University's
commitment to the recruitment AND
retention of graduate students from histori
cally underrepresented groups.
We share in the anger and outrage of the
entire Stanford ommunity regarding this act
of violence against the campus as a whole,
and African-American and Latino graduate
students in particular. The incident must be
used to compel each and every member of
this community to initiate and participate in
open and honest dialogue about the envi
ronment that allowed for such hatred to be
expressed.
In order to create a more tolerant and
inclusive community, we call on all mem
bers of Stanford to address the following:
1. The racism of Saturday's e-mail and
the climate from which it arose is not simply
an issue for students of color but a problem
that affects ALL community members.
2. The First Amendment protects free
dom of speech, but with this right comes
responsibility. We urge all members of this
community to exercise this responsibility to
create a new community climate in which
there is support, encouragement and appre
ciation of diversity and the richness it brings
to the prestige of our institution. Moreover,
a clear and decisive policy regarding hate
speech must be outlined and defended by
the I 'diversity.
3. We want to emphasize that the issue of
racism is clear in this act of hate speech and
must not get lost under the rhetoric of crim
inal computer-usage violations. The individ
uals who received this e-mail must be
appraised of their rights in regard to filing
charges against the writer(s) of this act of
hatred.
4. The housing shortage affecting gradu
ate students appears to have been the impe
tus for this particular destructive e-mail.
I his reality shows the need for the Univer
sity to deal more efficiently with issues
affecting graduate students. While the Uni
versity has recently begun construction of
additional graduate housing on campus, has
increased some of the graduate student
stipends and has taken steps to provide lim
ited subsidies for off campus housing, this
incident underscores that there is still more
that must be done. Until graduate students
are supported as a more integral part of this
institution, dissatisfaction and hostility may
continue to rise.
The circumstances outlined throughout
this letter point to Stanford's need to con
tinue efforts to provide a more proactive
approach to maintaining an inclusive com
munity. While there are dedicated individu
als and supportive spaces at Stanford, the
University must remain vigilant in develop
ing a comprehensive and integrated
approach to addressing issues of race, eth
nicity, gender and sexuality in all areas of
campus life.
While some individuals may feel that we I
are over-analyzing this situation, we must!
emphasize that the racist e-mail did not!
occur in isolation of other issues on this
campus. As students of color, we do not
have the privilege of allowing this act to
pass without response. NO ONE can be
silent. NO ONE should have the privilege
to be silent. If we value our humanity, if we 1
value our community, then the time to act is •
NOW. As a graduate student coalition, we
urge faculty to voice their outrage and act
with us. We urge staff to voice their outrage
and act with us. We urge students OF ALL
RACES to voice their outrage and act with
us.
Stanford's excellence depends upon
every individual's commitment to building
community.

Ihe brainpower at this University is

thinking critically. Why. then, does our
administration fail to recognize the connec

land's decision to leave and the racist e-mail
sent out this weekend?
All these in the past five months. Count
them. I IVI As much as the administration
would like to believe, these events are not
isolated.
Add to these the innumerable events I've
seen during my four years at Stanford. You'd
think that we'd have come somewhere.
Indeed, we got lull time directors for the
Women's ( enter and LGBCC We got the
Program in Comparative Studies in Race
and Lthnicity. We fought five years and
finally got ramps and an elevator to some of
Ihe communit) centers. Hut I've also seen
many tenure battles, "chinks suck" scribbled
in the Asian American Activities Center,
homophobic grafitti at the Bollards eating

When we arc supposedly a University on
the cutting edge, why do we deprioriti/e
work against racism, sexism and homopho
bia.' Why don't we take the opportunity to
pioneei innovative research on these issues?
lo train ourselves, the future leaders of
Amciica. to ileal effectively and construc
tively with these "isms"? Why does it take a
racist and inflammatory e mail for the Stan
lord administration to call a community
meeting? Why does it take students hunger
striking and getting arrested before the UC-
Berkeley administration will listen?
I challenge University President Gerhard
Casper, Provost elect John Itennessy, Vice
Piovost for Student Alfiars James Montoya
and Dean ol Students Marc Wais to see the
connections between all these events. To see
that these are all reasons loi people of color,
women and i|ueer people to stay away from
Stanford. And to lake initiative to prevent
lurthei similar incidents.
I his means more than simply tracking
clown the author of the e-mail. I his means
working consistently and proactively to hire
and retain faculty of color and women; to
encourage innovative scholarship in ethnic
studies queei studies. Southeast Asian stud
ies. Islamic Studies; to confront race and
gcndei and sexuality and disability in our
dormitories in meaningful ways; to attract
and train graduate students who will them
selves be excellent and innovative scholars.
Stanford cannot be a premiere university if it
continues to address these issues only in cri
sis.
It is timc for the new cleans and provost to
lake a true leadership role and reflect on
what they can do to pro actively combat
i acism, sexism and homophobia on this cam
pus.
When I come back in the fall. I want to
sec new initiatives and policies, because I am
tired, and I do not want to go on a hunger
strike. I do not want to take over a building,
I do not want to spend my academic time
lighting for the right to be here, the right to
have professors who do not look like me (I
am white) or the right to study Southeast
Asian or Native American literature or Chi
cana/os on the border.
I know deep down that this will not hap
pen. So I challenge my fellow students to
hold the administrators accountable to this.
Ask them what they are doing, push them to
take action and join me and others when we
need to make noise because they are not
mo\ ing. Join a race dialogue, learn about the
Stanford Center for Chieatia/o Research or
work with incoming Provost Hennessy to
understand the connections between recent
tenure denials and the general climate for
underrepresented groups at Stanford.

I felt troubled and saddened when I left
the meeting called by Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James Montoya and the Student
Affairs ()ffice on Sunday night. The content
of the racist e-mail that had been sent to sev
eral Stanford addresses a day and a half ear
lier had upset students much more than I had

anticipated. It was touching to witness their
frustrations, unci it was educational to hear
their concerns. They seemed, for the most
part, people who had devoted a lot of their
time and energy to addressing issues related
to race and ethnicity.
It was my impression, however, that Stan
lord came under unwarranted criticism from
some of the meeting's participants. The Uni
versity, it was suggested, does not do enough
lo promote diversity on campus, this fact,
ironically, was thrown in the face of people
who obviously cared about the issue at least
as much as those members in the audience
who were voicing their criticism.
We should not lose sight of the fact that
Stanford has already done a lot to address
racism on campus. While the measures taken
may be far from perfect. I believe that it is
the responsibility of each one of us. not just

the administration's, to create a safe, hate
free environment for ourselves. It takes per
sonal effort to do so. and the fact that so few
students came on Sunday to the meeting
shows that we still care too little to make that
effort. The llniversity can initiate I.(XH) pro
grams to promote diversity, they will have no
impact if only a few concerned students
attend them. Discussions about ethnicity do
not only affect ethnic minorities but indeed
all of us. so the next time you see a liver
advertising a talk at the Black Community
Services Center, go and check it out for your
sell The next time you arc given the chance
to express your views on a wall in White
Plaza, do .not deface it with worthless com
ments. Ihe next time you hear about a dance
at Casa Zapata, head over there and make
some new friends.
Constructively approaching people that
seem different from us helps us discover how
similar we all are. As a student of ethnic con
flict. I know that bridging gaps is not easy to
do. and as a Stanford student. I realize that
devoting time to activities not directly relat
ed to our fields can be difficult. I lowcver. we
owe it to ourselves to try to become
acquainted with, and respectful of. people
who are different from us, thereby making of
this University a home for all its students.

We write this letter in response to the
recent racist e-mail that was widely circulat
ed on campus. First and foremost, we would
like to emphasize that the nature of the e
mail is such that people of color are not the
only victims. The Web site link on the e
mail contained racist. anti-Semitic and
homophobic language. It also touches the
white community by purporting to be writ
ten on its behalf. Moreover, it attempts to
divide the communities of color by claiming
to be on behalf of the Asian community.
University President Gerhard Casper, in
his campus e-mail, mentioned that the
meeting on Sunday night was for the "Stan
ford community, especially those that were
the target of the e-mail." Why was he excus
ing white and Asian-American students
from being targets of this e-mail's message?
Racism and intolerance are not problems
that rest solely with communities of color,
and the burden of combating these issues
should not be entirely incumbent upon
them. Racism and intolerance arc every
body's problems, and all communities need
to be part of the solution.
I Jnfortunately, this heinous act is not an

isolated incident. T his is but one of a num
ber of hate crimes that have occurred on
campus over the past few years. Does the
administration remember "chinks suck"
written in the Asian American Activities
Center's meeting room? What about "all
fags should die" etched into a table at the
Suites' eating clubs? And what came of the
IW4 Flicks incident where moviegoers
screamed "go home, beaners!" after the
showing of a "No Grapes" film? What fol
lowed these incidents? Yes, some students
were censured, but what strides were made
to prevent similar (or worse) occurrences
from happening again? What actions were
taken to educate people about racism and
homophobia? In the past few years we have
seen and experienced some visible action by
the administration. This action, unfortu
nately, has only been temporary and the

administrative support fades as initial
responses fade. Consequently, the Stanford
campus is left unchanged. No sustained
institutional transformations transpire.
Reactive action on the part of students and
administration does not result in necessary,
sustained change. T his most recent incident
has merely blown the dust off of long-stand
ing issues, issues that can only be remedied
with proactive, institutional change.
Principally, the I 'niversity administra
tion must understand that it is crucial for
them to show a commitment toward diver
sity on all levels of the Stanford campus. If
its aim is to produce educated and well
rounded leaders, its primary objective must
be to introduce students to an accurate
cross-section of the world beyond Stanford.
This world — the real world — is com
prised ol people of all races, ethnicities and
sexual orientations.
A large part of this change entails diver
sifying the faculty and (enuring women and
people of color. The current standards by
which professors' work is judged, however,
is highly biased. Opinions about what is
excellent teaching and scholasticallv accom
plished do not respect the efforts by profes
sors who work on issues that are seen to be
outside of the hegemonic mainstream. T he
acceptance of diversity in this institution
should merit equal importance in setting
high standards. These truths have already
been painfully realized with the denial of
tenure to professors like former Asst. His
tory Prof. Karen Sawislak and Asst. English
Prof. Robert Warrior. Without efforts to
support the cause of diversity and research
that aims to challenge the historical institu
tionalization of racism in our society,
women, students and professors of color
will never be welcomed as full members.
Furthermore, because residences are at
the core of student community, discussion
of race and ethnicity should be central to
Residential Education. Additionally,
human and financial support need to be gar
nered for ethnic centers and to expand eth
nic studies. For the preceding to be realized,
it is necessary to have an administration that
is responsive to students' needs. On that
note, the racist e-mail should at the very
least emphasize the salience of these issues.
Ultimately, we want to encourage ALL stu
dents to become informed and proactive.
We thank the Office of Student Affairs
and the Vice-Provost for organizing the
meeting on Sunday night. We also applaud
some recent efforts at diversity, such as the
hiring of full-time directors at the LGBCC
and the Women's Center. However, we

would additionally welcome the opportuni
ty to meet with President Casper to further
discuss these important issues.
We remind faculty, students and stall
that this is our University. We have a
responsibility to educate one another to cre
ate an environment that is conducive to stu
dent success. Successful graduates, in turn,
strengthen the University, create responsi
ble citizenry and ensure that racism does
not continue to permeate society. II we lail
to accomplish this, the University is tailing
to educate us.

Ask them what they are doing, push them to
take action and join me and others when we
need to make noise because they are not
mo\ ing. Join a race dialogue, learn about the
Stanford Center for Chieatia/o Research or
work with incoming Provost Hennessy to
understand the connections between recent
tenure denials and the general climate for
underrepresented groups at Stanford.

I felt troubled and saddened when I left
the meeting called by Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James Montoya and the Student
Affairs ()ffice on Sunday night. The content
of the racist e-mail that had been sent to sev
eral Stanford addresses a day and a half ear
lier had upset students much more than I had

anticipated. It was touching to witness their
frustrations, unci it was educational to hear
their concerns. They seemed, for the most
part, people who had devoted a lot of their
time and energy to addressing issues related
to race and ethnicity.
It was my impression, however, that Stan
lord came under unwarranted criticism from
some of the meeting's participants. The Uni
versity, it was suggested, does not do enough
lo promote diversity on campus, this fact,
ironically, was thrown in the face of people
who obviously cared about the issue at least
as much as those members in the audience
who were voicing their criticism.
We should not lose sight of the fact that
Stanford has already done a lot to address
racism on campus. While the measures taken
may be far from perfect. I believe that it is
the responsibility of each one of us. not just

the administration's, to create a safe, hate
free environment for ourselves. It takes per
sonal effort to do so. and the fact that so few
students came on Sunday to the meeting
shows that we still care too little to make that
effort. The llniversity can initiate I.(XH) pro
grams to promote diversity, they will have no
impact if only a few concerned students
attend them. Discussions about ethnicity do
not only affect ethnic minorities but indeed
all of us. so the next time you see a liver
advertising a talk at the Black Community
Services Center, go and check it out for your
sell The next time you arc given the chance
to express your views on a wall in White
Plaza, do .not deface it with worthless com
ments. Ihe next time you hear about a dance
at Casa Zapata, head over there and make
some new friends.
Constructively approaching people that
seem different from us helps us discover how
similar we all are. As a student of ethnic con
flict. I know that bridging gaps is not easy to
do. and as a Stanford student. I realize that
devoting time to activities not directly relat
ed to our fields can be difficult. I lowcver. we
owe it to ourselves to try to become
acquainted with, and respectful of. people
who are different from us, thereby making of
this University a home for all its students.

We write this letter in response to the
recent racist e-mail that was widely circulat
ed on campus. First and foremost, we would
like to emphasize that the nature of the e
mail is such that people of color are not the
only victims. The Web site link on the e
mail contained racist. anti-Semitic and
homophobic language. It also touches the
white community by purporting to be writ
ten on its behalf. Moreover, it attempts to
divide the communities of color by claiming
to be on behalf of the Asian community.
University President Gerhard Casper, in
his campus e-mail, mentioned that the
meeting on Sunday night was for the "Stan
ford community, especially those that were
the target of the e-mail." Why was he excus
ing white and Asian-American students
from being targets of this e-mail's message?
Racism and intolerance are not problems
that rest solely with communities of color,
and the burden of combating these issues
should not be entirely incumbent upon
them. Racism and intolerance arc every
body's problems, and all communities need
to be part of the solution.
I Jnfortunately, this heinous act is not an

isolated incident. T his is but one of a num
ber of hate crimes that have occurred on
campus over the past few years. Does the
administration remember "chinks suck"
written in the Asian American Activities
Center's meeting room? What about "all
fags should die" etched into a table at the
Suites' eating clubs? And what came of the
IW4 Flicks incident where moviegoers
screamed "go home, beaners!" after the
showing of a "No Grapes" film? What fol
lowed these incidents? Yes, some students
were censured, but what strides were made
to prevent similar (or worse) occurrences
from happening again? What actions were
taken to educate people about racism and
homophobia? In the past few years we have
seen and experienced some visible action by
the administration. This action, unfortu
nately, has only been temporary and the

administrative support fades as initial
responses fade. Consequently, the Stanford
campus is left unchanged. No sustained
institutional transformations transpire.
Reactive action on the part of students and
administration does not result in necessary,
sustained change. T his most recent incident
has merely blown the dust off of long-stand
ing issues, issues that can only be remedied
with proactive, institutional change.
Principally, the I 'niversity administra
tion must understand that it is crucial for
them to show a commitment toward diver
sity on all levels of the Stanford campus. If
its aim is to produce educated and well
rounded leaders, its primary objective must
be to introduce students to an accurate
cross-section of the world beyond Stanford.
This world — the real world — is com
prised ol people of all races, ethnicities and
sexual orientations.
A large part of this change entails diver
sifying the faculty and (enuring women and
people of color. The current standards by
which professors' work is judged, however,
is highly biased. Opinions about what is
excellent teaching and scholasticallv accom
plished do not respect the efforts by profes
sors who work on issues that are seen to be
outside of the hegemonic mainstream. T he
acceptance of diversity in this institution
should merit equal importance in setting
high standards. These truths have already
been painfully realized with the denial of
tenure to professors like former Asst. His
tory Prof. Karen Sawislak and Asst. English
Prof. Robert Warrior. Without efforts to
support the cause of diversity and research
that aims to challenge the historical institu
tionalization of racism in our society,
women, students and professors of color
will never be welcomed as full members.
Furthermore, because residences are at
the core of student community, discussion
of race and ethnicity should be central to
Residential Education. Additionally,
human and financial support need to be gar
nered for ethnic centers and to expand eth
nic studies. For the preceding to be realized,
it is necessary to have an administration that
is responsive to students' needs. On that
note, the racist e-mail should at the very
least emphasize the salience of these issues.
Ultimately, we want to encourage ALL stu
dents to become informed and proactive.
We thank the Office of Student Affairs
and the Vice-Provost for organizing the
meeting on Sunday night. We also applaud
some recent efforts at diversity, such as the
hiring of full-time directors at the LGBCC
and the Women's Center. However, we

would additionally welcome the opportuni
ty to meet with President Casper to further
discuss these important issues.
We remind faculty, students and stall
that this is our University. We have a
responsibility to educate one another to cre
ate an environment that is conducive to stu
dent success. Successful graduates, in turn,
strengthen the University, create responsi
ble citizenry and ensure that racism does
not continue to permeate society. II we lail
to accomplish this, the University is tailing
to educate us.

An incident occurred this weekend that
sent a wave ol shock and outrage across
Stanford I 'niversity. On Saturday morning
an as of yet unidentified individual sent a
racist, inflammatory c mail targeting gradu
ate students of color to as many as 30.0(H)
leland account users. Specifically, it accused
African Americans and I .atinos of receiving
"preferential treatment" in the graduate
student housing lottery "because [ofj the
color of their skin.'' In addition, this e-mail
encouraged divisiveness among students on
campus, stating that white students and
Asian students should "stand up and light
for what's right." I his is a direct affront to
all students by suggesting that some mem
bers of the Stanford communit) are not a
welcomed and valued part of the Universi
ty.
As African-American and I atino gradu
ate students at Stanford, we are outraged
and disgusted by this direct attack upon us
both personally and collectively. In addition
we are similarly appalled that a valued
member of the community. Prisdha Dhar
ma. has allegedly been falsely targeted as
the source of this e-mail. Truly we recognize
that as a community when one member is
victimized we all suffer. ()ur hope is that as
we struggle to reconcile this incident per
sonally and collectively we will remember
all of the individuals affected.
In light of this hateful act, we intend to;
1) Endorse the University's continued expe
dient attention to this incident; 2) Illustrate
the broader context from which this inci
dent erupted; and 3) Provide recommenda
tions for future I 'niversity action.
From the moment students, faculty and
staff received this e-mail, we have experi
enced feelings of violation. Students, staff
and faculty met on Sunday with Vice
Provost Jim Montoya and other key student
affairs administrators. At this meeting,
many individuals expressed their concerns
about the incident and Jacqueline Wender,
assistant to the president, shared portions of
University President Gerhard Casper's let
ter denouncing the incident.
However, while Casper's response con
veyed his sense of outrage, his noticeable
absence from Sunday's meeting suggests a
lack of personal investment in this issue.
Several students present asked about the
absence of Casper. While Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Jim Montoya asserted that
he was the initiator of the meeting and felt
personally compelled to meet on Sunday,
the president's lack of appearance at the
meeting was never fully explained. I he hol
iday weekend may have made it awkward
for some people to attend the meeting, but
we feel that the president has a responsibil
ity to this community. Many administrators
were there and served as "representatives"
for the president, but given the severity of
this situation what was most needed was not
micro-management but LEADERSHIP.
This was a time of crisis, and our president
was not there.
In his statement regarding this incident
Casper urged the Stanford community "to
be particularly careful before generalizing
from an incident like this." While we agree
that caution is necessary, it is important to
expose the reality that this is not an isolated
incident. We need only look at recent
events to sec that for many people, issues of
intolerance are a daily reality on this cam
pus. The irresponsible comments on the
Leadership 2(HH) "Race and Ethnicity" wall
in White Plaza illustrate this trend. T he low
percentage of tenure among women and
faculty of color, as well as the current
inquiry by the U.S. Department of Labor
into the t Jniversity's tenure policy also high
light this issue. Additionally, the perceived
transition from a centralized institutional

commitment to affirmative action to a
decentralized system of departmentally
defined "diversity" underscores the prob
lem further. These facts raise doubt about
the central coordination of the University's
commitment to the recruitment AND
retention of graduate students from histori
cally underrepresented groups.
We share in the anger and outrage of the
entire Stanford ommunity regarding this act
of violence against the campus as a whole,
and African-American and Latino graduate
students in particular. The incident must be
used to compel each and every member of
this community to initiate and participate in
open and honest dialogue about the envi
ronment that allowed for such hatred to be
expressed.
In order to create a more tolerant and
inclusive community, we call on all mem
bers of Stanford to address the following:
1. The racism of Saturday's e-mail and
the climate from which it arose is not simply
an issue for students of color but a problem
that affects ALL community members.
2. The First Amendment protects free
dom of speech, but with this right comes
responsibility. We urge all members of this
community to exercise this responsibility to
create a new community climate in which
there is support, encouragement and appre
ciation of diversity and the richness it brings
to the prestige of our institution. Moreover,
a clear and decisive policy regarding hate
speech must be outlined and defended by
the I 'diversity.
3. We want to emphasize that the issue of
racism is clear in this act of hate speech and
must not get lost under the rhetoric of crim
inal computer-usage violations. The individ
uals who received this e-mail must be
appraised of their rights in regard to filing
charges against the writer(s) of this act of
hatred.
4. The housing shortage affecting gradu
ate students appears to have been the impe
tus for this particular destructive e-mail.
I his reality shows the need for the Univer
sity to deal more efficiently with issues
affecting graduate students. While the Uni
versity has recently begun construction of
additional graduate housing on campus, has
increased some of the graduate student
stipends and has taken steps to provide lim
ited subsidies for off campus housing, this
incident underscores that there is still more
that must be done. Until graduate students
are supported as a more integral part of this
institution, dissatisfaction and hostility may
continue to rise.
The circumstances outlined throughout
this letter point to Stanford's need to con
tinue efforts to provide a more proactive
approach to maintaining an inclusive com
munity. While there are dedicated individu
als and supportive spaces at Stanford, the
University must remain vigilant in develop
ing a comprehensive and integrated
approach to addressing issues of race, eth
nicity, gender and sexuality in all areas of
campus life.
While some individuals may feel that we I
are over-analyzing this situation, we must!
emphasize that the racist e-mail did not!
occur in isolation of other issues on this
campus. As students of color, we do not
have the privilege of allowing this act to
pass without response. NO ONE can be
silent. NO ONE should have the privilege
to be silent. If we value our humanity, if we 1
value our community, then the time to act is •
NOW. As a graduate student coalition, we
urge faculty to voice their outrage and act
with us. We urge staff to voice their outrage
and act with us. We urge students OF ALL
RACES to voice their outrage and act with
us.
Stanford's excellence depends upon
every individual's commitment to building
community.

Ihe brainpower at this University is
amazing. People have an immense capacity
loi understanding, seeing connections and
thinking critically. Why. then, does our
administration fail to recognize the connec
tions between a possible Labor Department
investigation of hiring and promotion prac
tices. former I aw I'rol. Linda Mabry's resig
nation from the Law School, Native Ameri
can Asst. I nglish Prof. Robert Warrior's

feminist Asst. I nglish Prof. Sharon I lol
land's decision to leave and the racist e-mail
sent out this weekend?
All these in the past five months. Count
them. I IVI As much as the administration
would like to believe, these events are not
isolated.
Add to these the innumerable events I've
seen during my four years at Stanford. You'd
think that we'd have come somewhere.
Indeed, we got lull time directors for the
Women's ( enter and LGBCC We got the
Program in Comparative Studies in Race
and Lthnicity. We fought five years and
finally got ramps and an elevator to some of
Ihe communit) centers. Hut I've also seen
many tenure battles, "chinks suck" scribbled
in the Asian American Activities Center,
homophobic grafitti at the Bollards eating
club, the suicide of ;i queer ( hicana English
professor. Ihe withet ing away ol the Stanford
( entei loi ( hicana/o Research, the disman
tling ol the I ood Research Institute and the
appointment «>1 former (iov. Pete Wilson as
a I loover fellow.
When we arc supposedly a University on
the cutting edge, why do we deprioriti/e
work against racism, sexism and homopho
bia.' Why don't we take the opportunity to
pioneei innovative research on these issues?
lo train ourselves, the future leaders of
Amciica. to ileal effectively and construc
tively with these "isms"? Why does it take a
racist and inflammatory e mail for the Stan
lord administration to call a community
meeting? Why does it take students hunger
striking and getting arrested before the UC-
Berkeley administration will listen?
I challenge University President Gerhard
Casper, Provost elect John Itennessy, Vice
Piovost for Student Alfiars James Montoya
and Dean ol Students Marc Wais to see the
connections between all these events. To see
that these are all reasons loi people of color,
women and i|ueer people to stay away from
Stanford. And to lake initiative to prevent
lurthei similar incidents.
I his means more than simply tracking
clown the author of the e-mail. I his means
working consistently and proactively to hire
and retain faculty of color and women; to
encourage innovative scholarship in ethnic
studies queei studies. Southeast Asian stud
ies. Islamic Studies; to confront race and
gcndei and sexuality and disability in our
dormitories in meaningful ways; to attract
and train graduate students who will them
selves be excellent and innovative scholars.
Stanford cannot be a premiere university if it
continues to address these issues only in cri
sis.
It is timc for the new cleans and provost to
lake a true leadership role and reflect on
what they can do to pro actively combat
i acism, sexism and homophobia on this cam
pus.
When I come back in the fall. I want to
sec new initiatives and policies, because I am
tired, and I do not want to go on a hunger
strike. I do not want to take over a building,
I do not want to spend my academic time
lighting for the right to be here, the right to
have professors who do not look like me (I
am white) or the right to study Southeast
Asian or Native American literature or Chi
cana/os on the border.
I know deep down that this will not hap
pen. So I challenge my fellow students to
hold the administrators accountable to this.
Ask them what they are doing, push them to
take action and join me and others when we
need to make noise because they are not
mo\ ing. Join a race dialogue, learn about the
Stanford Center for Chieatia/o Research or
work with incoming Provost Hennessy to
understand the connections between recent
tenure denials and the general climate for
underrepresented groups at Stanford.

inquiry by the U.S. Department of Labor
into the t Jniversity's tenure policy also high
light this issue. Additionally, the perceived
transition from a centralized institutional

commitment to affirmative action to a
decentralized system of departmentally
defined "diversity" underscores the prob
lem further. These facts raise doubt about
the central coordination of the University's
commitment to the recruitment AND
retention of graduate students from histori
cally underrepresented groups.
We share in the anger and outrage of the
entire Stanford ommunity regarding this act
of violence against the campus as a whole,
and African-American and Latino graduate
students in particular. The incident must be
used to compel each and every member of
this community to initiate and participate in
open and honest dialogue about the envi
ronment that allowed for such hatred to be
expressed.
In order to create a more tolerant and
inclusive community, we call on all mem
bers of Stanford to address the following:
1. The racism of Saturday's e-mail and
the climate from which it arose is not simply
an issue for students of color but a problem
that affects ALL community members.
2. The First Amendment protects free
dom of speech, but with this right comes
responsibility. We urge all members of this
community to exercise this responsibility to
create a new community climate in which
there is support, encouragement and appre
ciation of diversity and the richness it brings
to the prestige of our institution. Moreover,
a clear and decisive policy regarding hate
speech must be outlined and defended by
the I 'diversity.
3. We want to emphasize that the issue of
racism is clear in this act of hate speech and
must not get lost under the rhetoric of crim
inal computer-usage violations. The individ
uals who received this e-mail must be
appraised of their rights in regard to filing
charges against the writer(s) of this act of
hatred.
4. The housing shortage affecting gradu
ate students appears to have been the impe
tus for this particular destructive e-mail.
I his reality shows the need for the Univer
sity to deal more efficiently with issues
affecting graduate students. While the Uni
versity has recently begun construction of
additional graduate housing on campus, has
increased some of the graduate student
stipends and has taken steps to provide lim
ited subsidies for off campus housing, this
incident underscores that there is still more
that must be done. Until graduate students
are supported as a more integral part of this
institution, dissatisfaction and hostility may
continue to rise.
The circumstances outlined throughout
this letter point to Stanford's need to con
tinue efforts to provide a more proactive
approach to maintaining an inclusive com
munity. While there are dedicated individu
als and supportive spaces at Stanford, the
University must remain vigilant in develop
ing a comprehensive and integrated
approach to addressing issues of race, eth
nicity, gender and sexuality in all areas of
campus life.
While some individuals may feel that we I
are over-analyzing this situation, we must!
emphasize that the racist e-mail did not!
occur in isolation of other issues on this
campus. As students of color, we do not
have the privilege of allowing this act to
pass without response. NO ONE can be
silent. NO ONE should have the privilege
to be silent. If we value our humanity, if we 1
value our community, then the time to act is •
NOW. As a graduate student coalition, we
urge faculty to voice their outrage and act
with us. We urge staff to voice their outrage
and act with us. We urge students OF ALL
RACES to voice their outrage and act with
us.
Stanford's excellence depends upon
every individual's commitment to building
community.
