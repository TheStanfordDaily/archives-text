## Wise owls reveal how brain adapts to changes 
### Joanne Wu Editorial staff 
Living up to its reputation as one
of nature's wisest creatures, the barn
owl has recently become the subject
of Stanford researchers.
By placing prism eyeglasses on
the owls and later removing them,
the scientists were able to analvze

how the owls' brains adapted to
changes in their visual field. They
discovered that owls retain neurolog
ical maps that help them integrate
their new vision with auditory cues,
allowing them to readjust to differ
ent views of their environment.
"In our experiments, we induce
the brain to create several alternative
space maps by exposing owls to dif

ferent kinds of experiences. ... The
brain learns the maps based on expe
rience," said Neurobiology Prof. Eric
Knudsen. who co-authored the study
with Weimin Zheng, a postdoctoral
fellow in medicine. Their research
appeared in the May 7 issue of Sci
ence.
Over the past three years. Knud
sen and his team have explored how

the owl's brain learns to respond
accurately to sound, and in their
newest study, they have determined
how cells in the owl's brain actually
forget incorrect responses as well.
Barn owls were chosen as the
experimental subjects due to their
highly developed auditory and visual
systems.
" The barn owl hunts at nii>ht and

depends on its ability to localize
sounds in order to find prey. Because
its lite depends on sound localiza
tion. you can imagine that it is pretty
good at it." Knudsen said. "The
brain's map of auditory space is
much sharper in resolution in the
barn owl than in any other species.
Because the map is so sharp, we are
able to see changes in the map eilsilv
and with high confidence."
Prism eyeglasses were used to
shift the owl's visual field so that
even when the owl looked straight
ahead, the objects it saw were, in
reality, either to the right or left of
where it appeared.
Knudsen explained. "The owl
cannot turn its eyes in its sockets, so
the prisms create a chronic misalign
ment between what the owl sees and
what it hears. Over a period of
weeks, the owl's brain shifts its map
of auditory space to match its opti
cally displaced visual world. This
brings its auditors' and visual worlds
hack into agreement."
The researchers call the owl's
adjusted neurological map the
learned map. and the owl's neurolog
ical map without prism glasses the
normal map. In order to follow the
activity in the owl's brain as it adjust
ed to a world seen through prism
glasses. Knudsen measured the elec
trical signals generated by the brain.
"We monitor the brain's impulses
with a very fine electrode that we
place next to nerve cells at different
places in the brain's map." Knudsen
said. "The pattern of impulses that
are evoked by sounds from different
locations in space is changed as the
map changes and adjusts."

The research focused on the ICX
region of the brain, which is the area
where auditory learning takes place
in the owl. The site is rich in
GABAergic neurons, which are
inhibitory nerve cells. Through
experiments. Knudsen and Zheng
confirmed that these neurons are
responsible for suppressing the nor
mal map when the glasses were
applied.
When these neurons were
blocked, the owls lost their learned
responses and reverted to normal
responses. This reveals that the nor
mal map was never lost, even when
the prism glasses were on: it had only
been temporarily suppressed. This
helps explain how the owls were able
to readjust to the normal view of the
world after the glasses were
removed.
"The alternative maps are
dynamically regulated by changes in
both excitatory and inhibitory influ
ences. and that the capacity to form
alternative maps depends critically
on the richness of the animal's expe
rience during the adolescent period
of life." Knudsen explained.
According to Knudsen. in further
studies, researchers "intend to dis
cover the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that control learning
and how these mechanisms are regu
lated over the course of life."
Knudsen and Zheng's research
may also carry implications for stud
ies on the human brain.
Knudsen said. "My guess is that if
the owl's brain is capable of this
degree of plasticity, then ours is too.
and that the mechanisms that under
lie the plasticity are shared.
