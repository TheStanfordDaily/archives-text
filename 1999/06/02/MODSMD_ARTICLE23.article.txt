# Fat-free does not necessarily mean risk-free
## Science bug crunches down on the facts behind Olestra 
### Garth Patil Contributing writer 
(J: I've heard mixed opinions about a J'al supplement called
Olean. How does it work'.' Is it a healthy alternative to Jat and
can it help me lose weight?
A: After its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in
19%. Olestra. a product of Procter and (iambic (P&G). has fall
en under heavy fire for its effect on the gastrointestinal system.
You'll find "Olean " the marketing name for Olestra, in many
snack foods such as potato chips. 11 passes through the body
without being digested or absorbed, so it has no calories. I his is
because its molecule is too large to pass through the wall ot the
colon.
Unlike other fat substitutes, it can withstand high cooking
temperatures, as in frying potato chips. One ounce of Olestra
potato chips would have no fat and just 70 calories, compared to
10 grams of fat and 150 calories in conventional chips. It is also
supposed to match the texture and flavor of fat better than the
.other substitutes.
Before its release to the public, more than 2.000 people in lim
ited test markets complained to P&G that Olestra caused gas
trointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and anal leakage.
There is a high risk of diarrhea and abdominal cramping. In
one study, half the subjects developed diarrhea after eating three
ounces of potato chips made with Olestra. Other studies found
that even one ounce of chips caused diarrhea and cramps in some
people.
In the test markets, at least IS people experienced such severe
symptoms that they went to the hospital or visited their doctors.
P&G claims that all those cases were just coincidences.
Over the past few years, we've definitely seen many flip-flops
in authorities' recommendations of fat content in a healthy diet.
The most recent conclusions are that while it's prudent to mod
erate fat intake, the elimination of fat entirely or trying to keep
consumption very low isn't healthy. Fats carry fat-soluble vita
mins that play vital roles in the body's processes and are difficult
to otherwise supplement.
Olestra's inhibition of the absorption of these carotenoids.
which are thought to protect consumers from heart disease and
cancer, may be its most serious long-term threat.
In one of P&G's own studies, eating 16 ()lestra potato chips a
day for S years reduced blood carotenoid levels by 50 percent. In
another study, six chips a day lowered beta carotene levels by 50
percent. P&G's claim that they will fortify the product with Vita
mins A. D. E and K misses the point. It's only recently that we are
discovering micro nutrients and nutritional factors found in natu
ral foods. No one knows which substances to replace, how much
to replace or how good the replacements are.
Recently, P&G spokespersons have been trying to persuade
media that their new studies show Olestra snack foods cause the
same gastrointestinal symptoms as similar products that contain
fat.
However, critics claim that these new studies were designed in

such a way to actually miss the negative data previously record
ed.
If the intent of using products that contain Olean is to lose
weight, you're probably on the wrong track. The notion that con
suming a product in which the fat is not absorbed by the body will
aid in weight loss has been proven incorrect in similar products.
Like foods with artificial sweeteners, consumers of fake-fat foods
may feel justified in treating themselves to more calories or high
fat foods. Many people also find themselves thinking that it's OK
to eat a whole package of a fat-free product, for example, forget
ting the fact that the carbohydrates and protein within the prod
uct also contribute calories.
Rather than using fat alternatives that may end up bolstering
your calorie intake, try eating wholesome foods in a common
sense manner and get into the routine of regular aerobic exercise.
Down the road, relying on a quick-fix like Olean can cause
greater problems than the ones you're trying to avoid.
This will be my last appearance as Science Hug. id like to thank
all those who submitted questions, answered or unanswered. I
hope that the Science Hug does not die with my departure. If you re
interested in the job, all it takes is an inquiring mind and typing
skills.
So farewell, and remember to never stop asking questions.
