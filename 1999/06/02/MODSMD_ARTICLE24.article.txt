# Treatment finally lets sleepy people rest easy

Loud, heavy snoring can certainly be an
annoyance, but it is a fairly innocuous one,
right? Wrong.
Snoring of this type, especially when
accompanied by choking or gasping sounds,
turns out to be a symptom of the sleep disorder
know as obstructive sleep apnea. In its severest
forms, OS A is life-threatening.
Researchers at Stanford have developed a
new treatment to fight OSA. which focuses on
shrinking the extra tissue that causes airway
obstruction via a relatively non-invasive
method that minimizes both cost and patient
discomfort.
The new technology, called somnoplas
tysm. involves the use of radiofirequency ener
gy to heat internal tissue at the tongue's base.
The heat causes a lesion that will be reab
sorbed when the tongue heals. Through this
process, tongue size decreases, and a smaller
tongue is less likely to cause airway blockage
during sleep.
The co-director of Stanford's Sleep Disor
ders Center, Dr. Nelson Powell, lauds somno
plastysm as, "a breakthrough in the treatment
of sleep apnea."
Powell headed a recent study to test the
efficacy of the treatment. His study yielded
impressive results: after undergoing a series of
treatments, patients showed, on average, a 17
percent reduction in tongue volume. Powell s
results are reported in the May issue of Oto
laryngology â€” Head and Neck Surgery.
Apneic episodes occur in OSA patients
when the decrease in muscle tone brought on
by sleep causes tissue of the tongue and soft
palate to relax, thereby blocking the upper air
way and making it difficult or impossible to
breathe. As air is forced through a smaller
hole, tissue tone is decreased even further,
causing additional blockage.
Powell explained, "The opening may start
out the size of a quarter and then gets to be the
size of a straw. It takes years for the tissue to
completely block the airway, and that's called
sleep apnea."
People suffering from OSA usually com
plain of chronic daytime fatigue. This perva
sive sleepiness is a consequence of the brief,
but frequent, arousals an OSA patient experi
ences as he gasps for air to clear his obstructed
throat. In the most severe cases of sleep apnea,
arousals can occur at a frequency of more than
100 times each hour. Not only does chronic
fatigue lead to a decreased quality of life, it can
also be dangerous. Severe sleep apnea increas
es the likelihood that a person will have an
automobile accident by seven times.

OS A is estimated to afflict 20 million peo
ple in the United States. Not only are apnea
patients forced to grapple with chronic fatigue,
they are also more likely to have high blood
pressure and heart disease. Tellingly, sleep
apnea is associated with about 38,000 cardiac
deaths each year.
Powell's study focused on the response of
IS patients with sleep apnea ranging from mild
to severe.
Prior to receiving a series of six treatments,
the study group averaged about 40 incidences
of disrupted breathing every hour they were
asleep. Following treatment, a decline of more
than 50 percent in apnea episodes was record
ed for the group.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indi
cated that tongue volume of the study's
patients had indeed decreased. Normal tongue
function, including speech and swallowing abil
ity, were not harmed by this pnKedure. Each
treatment is an outpatient procedure lasting
30-45 minutes. Patients reported minimal dis
comfort as a result of the treatments, and after
being monitored fora night, they can resume
normal activity. Somnoplastysm is an attrac
tive alternative to surgery, which often sports a
painful recovery and requires hospitalization.
On May 10 and 11, Powell presented his
findings to the American Thoracic Society
Workshop on Alternative Therapy in Pitts
burgh.
Hopefully, somnoplastysm will be able to
bring much-needed relief to those who suffer
from sleep apnea. "This is the study that every
one in the sleep community has been waiting
for," said Powell.
