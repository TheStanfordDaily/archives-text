## Stanton stresses his love of service and of learning 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Timothy Stanton, who guided the
the Haas Center of Public Service to
national prominence, continues to
blaze trails. Stanton, the center's di
rector since 1993, announced yester
day that he will step down from his
post to become the center's first se
nior fellow.
Stanton has worked with the Haas
Center for nearly 14 years since its
creation in 1985. Prior to assuming
the directorship, he served as acting
and associate director.
Nadinne Cruz, current associate
director of the center, will serve as its
interim head until a new director is
named, probably next spring. James
Montova, vice provost for student af
fairs. will head the search.
Stanton said the idea of creating a

senior fellowship dates back five
years. He said the Haas Center com
missioned a study on creating the fel
lowships and"the results of the study
were very positive."
The full-time position will allow
Stanton to continue his community
service work.
"It is a fortunate opportunity for
me," Stanton said "1 will be carrying
on and putting more time into my
projects. This will give me the oppor
tunity to build on my work in South
Africa." Stanton is also deeply in
volved in South Bay community de
velopment projects, among others.
Stanton said the new director will
find the Haas Center in a period of
change. The center currently pre
sents "a pretty wonderful opportuni
ty," he said. "It is at a jumping off
point for new development."
The new director. Stanton said.

should "hopefully ... be effective in
different worlds: academic, student,
communities and lund raising."
"I hope they have deep under
standing of service and service learn
ing. as well as a value of people and
community." Stanton said.
Stanton has a long history of in
volvement with Stanford and has
seen the relationship between Stan
ford and the community change. "I
was an undergraduate in the l%()s.
There was a lot of involvement and
students lived in East Palo Alto and
were members of the community. A
lot of their involvement was political.
It is a different environment today."
However Stanton believes that
current students have a high level of
involvement in community service.
Stanton's personal experience
with service at Stanford gives him a
"personal connection and credibility"
said Heather Ramirez, service learn
ing coordinator at the 1 laas Center.
Ramirez said one of Stanton's
strengths is his integration, of Stan
ford's academic mission with service
opportunities.

Suzanne Abel, director of devel
opment and external relations al the
Haas Center, concurred. "He has
done an excellent job of integrating
the academic mission of the Univer
sity with service."
Stanton stressed the link the Haas
Center and the University have de
veloped. "A number of faculty have
stepped forward to link academics
with service." he said. "I have had a
wonderful response from my col
leagues. Haas can get some credit,
but the faculty deserves some as
well."
In addition to the link between the
academic service. Abel credits Stan
ton with, "making the Haas Center a
home for people with diverse per
spectives on community service. It
was a great accomplishment for him
as a leader."
Abel said Stanton's influence on
the center has been "enormous."
"He has been here for many
years," Abel said. "He has really
shaped the center in many ways. I
hope in new role he will continue to
do that."
