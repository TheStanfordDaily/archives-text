# Sixth Man ticket distribution still under discussion
## 
### Jason Engleman Staff writer 
Students are still debating the best
way to distribute Sixth Man Club
memberships as the Department of
Athletics tries to finalize its plans be
fore the end of the quarter.
ASSU Senator Serge Kassardjian
is concerned that the priority system
will decrease freshman involvement
with the Sixth Man club.
"[Freshmen] are usually the peo
ple who are most enthused about
being at Stanford." Kassardjian said.
Senior computer science major
1 )avid Wiesen. who was a member of
Sixth Man for two years, worries that
officials "really need to pay attention
to people cutting in line."
Still most students involved be
lieves. the proposals are a step in the
right direction.
"I think we've addressed the
needs that we've heard through the
student body," said junior Doug
Mooney. a Sixth Man Club member
who has acted as a liaison between
students and the Athletics Depart
ment. Mooney and other students
have joined with University officials
on a committee to reform the Sixth
Man ticket distribution process.
Wiesen is especially happy with
the committee's decision to re-intro
duce camping out in front of Maples
for Sixth Man tickets. That way.
Wiesen said. "You get the most ded
icated people getting the Sixth Man."
John 1 lopkins. who will be taking
over Jamie Zaninovich's position
overseeing the Sixth Man next year,
stressed that the process has not been
completed. Zaninovich is the direc
tor of marketing and promotions for
men's basketball.
"We have not issued all the final

rules and regulations," Hopkins said.
He added that the committee is try
ing to announce official rules "before
the summer break."
Hopkins said the Athletics De
partment is trying to transfer some
powers concerning Sixth Man Club
ticket distribution to the ASSU.
"We're trying to legitimize the Sixth
Man Club through the ASSU," Hop
kins said.
Zaninovich announced last week
that Sixth Man tickets would be dis
tributed differently next year.
This year tickets were awarded by
means of a lottery because, according
to Mooney, "cheating had gotten out
of hand."
In the proposed plan the lottery
system would be eliminated. Stu
dents could camp out next to Maples
Pavilion fora maximum of five days
and wait in line to purchase tickets.
Also students would be granted pri
orities based on Sixth Man experi
ence and class level. The ASSU
would be increasingly involved with
ticket distribution.
With the proposed changes Stan
ford will mimic Duke University's
policy for passing out student tickets.
According to Mooney, groups may
not be larger than 8 or 10 people.
Also groups will have to pre-register
before they get in line and will have
to present a list of their members
when they register to wait in line.
"We will hold them to that,"
Mooney said.
He further said that a certain
number of tickets will be allocated
for graduate students, because "we
realize they can't necessarily wait in
line."
Mooney said staff may be sta
tioned in front of Maples to eliminate
any cutting in line.
