# New print system designed eases computer use for PCs
##

â€¢ Last week saw the release of a new PC printing ac
count system from Residential Computing. Available for
printing to residential laser printers, the new system sig
nificantly improves printing support for Windows users
;|nd provides a foundation for future improvements to
Residential computing services.
Prior to this new software printing from a Windows PC'
Required two steps. A person would first have to print
their document from within the Windows operating sys
tem. They would then have to log into a web page where
ihev could release their print job to the printer and au
thorize that their Stanford Card Plan be charged for it.
"The new process is better because to streamlines this
process." said Brad Andrews, assistant director of soft
ware development at Residential Computing.
Under the new system, a small print utility, called
PDnotifv. runs on P(' users'computers and waits for them
to print a document. Once a printer receives a job from
their printer, the printer talks to the computer directly
through PDnotify.
This direct communication allows for the authentica
tion of the person's identity to be automatically done
through PC 'Leland, which eliminates step one.
Authorization of the charge to PC users Stanford ( ard
Plan account is handled by PDnotify in the form of a box
that pops up and asks users if they are sure they want to
print and charge their account.
This eliminates the time-consuming process in step

two of logging into a Web page and releasing the print job
each time the person wants to print. It also obviates the
importance of logging into and out of PCLeland each
time a person uses a Windows P('
Marc Reyhner, a senior and RC'(' in Soto, said the new
printing system is "a definite improvement over the old
system," and that he wishes it had been available to him
when he was a freshman.
PDnotify for the Mac. which w ill replace MacAuthen
ticator, is currently under testing and will be ready for the
residence clusters and incoming students by the end o! the
summer.
Andrews noted that MacAuthenticator is not current
ly below par with respect to PDnotify and will be re
placed. because it does not use MacLeland for identity au
thentication.
The new printing system is the culmination of Resi
dential Computing's long-standing desire to provide stu
dents with a simple and powerful networked printing sys
tem.
The main objectives of the system were to bring to
campus the ease of use for Windows PC' networked print
ing that lias existed for years with Man networked print
ing and to link the printing system with the PC/ MacLe
land campus security infrastructure.
()nce PDnotify for the Mac is finished, there will be a
standard printing scheme across campus for all Mac and
Windows PC users. In the future ResComp hopes to
adapt the system for greater campus wide use, including
the ability of campus guests to charge printing services to
a credit card or other alternative method of payment.
