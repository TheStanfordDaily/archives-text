"1 want my students to know that
once 1 am their professor, I am al
ways their professor," said German
Studies Prof. Elizabeth Bernhardt.
Bernhardt articulates a common
theme that runs deep within the var
ied teaching styles of this year's
prestigious Gores and Dinkelspiel
award winners — a devotion to their
students.
The Dinkelspiel awards for dis
tinctive contributions to undergrad
uate education and the Gores
awards for excellence in teaching
are the most prestigious awards that
a faculty member or student can re
ceive on the Farm.

This year's recipients of the
Dinkelspiel awards are Drama
Dept. Lecturer Richard Powers,
Bernhardt and seniors Claudia
Aranda and Boris Bershteyn.
Winners of the Gores award are
Assoc. History Prof. Mary Lou
Roberts, Asst. French and Italian
Prof. Joshua Landy and doctoral
students Joseph Brown of psycholo
gy, Sonia Gonzalez of Spanish, and*
Rebecca Whelan of chemistry.
Professors and students nomi
nate colleagues in an open process,
and a committee reviews the possi
ble candidates.
Bernhardt's own experiences in
college inspired her to become a
professor. "When I was an under

graduate, I had lots of trouble learn
ing German and learned Spanish
quite easily, and I realized that this
was because of my Spanish profes
sor."
As Director of the Stanford Lan
guage Center, Bernhardt has several
goals for her students. "I want them
to be excited about languages. I want
them to want to visit Germany alter
taking my class, and I want them to
stay in contact with me."
Powers was also excited about
receiving a Dinkelspiel. On the
dance floor and in the classroom.
Powers tries to be committed to his
students.
"I am very, very fond of my stu
dents here at Stanford and devoted
to them." he said. "My memories of
the Farm are overwhelming, and 1
can't think of anything more worth
doing than teaching here at Stan
ford."

Colleagues credit Powers with\
"bringing the gift and the joy of\
dance to the Stanford community."
1 le was "surprised and pleased" on
hearing that he was the recipient. "I
did not think that a dance teacher
could receive the Dinkelspiel."
Alt hough his undergraduate de
gree focused on product design.
Powers began teaching because he
believed he could "do the most
amount of good and least amount of
harm." He said. "I felt I was able to
do more good in passing on the
ideals of dance than in product de
sign. even though I had half a dozen
patents."
Recipients of the Gores awards
were equally ecstatic.
"I was thrilled," Roberts said.
She has taught for more than 20
years, nine of which were Stanford.
"Prof. Roberts is the bomb!" ex
claimed Anisha Ambadour, who is

in Roberts' History Area One class.
Freshman Catherine Dunlop
added, "Prof. Roberts makes history
■really interesting and funny. She has
\i really innovative teaching style that
rakes the class come alive. I remem
t'r once during a lecture on technol
(*y she started talking on a cellular
pkme. It was really hysterical."
Vl was just always a teacher,"
Roberts said, about how she began
her Career as a professor. "Even
when I was working in an office, I
was teaching everyone else. I just al
ways winted to teach."
Rorerts said she tries to convey
that sIH cares about her students
and enj(vs what she does.
Next War Roberts will be work
ing at Pr«ceton at the Institute for
AdvanceiiStudy on a book about
"the newvWnan in France."
Landy vas also "thrilled and
shocked" oi hearing that he was the

Gores junior award recipient
"This is my life. I love to teach.
Receiving the Gores award was the
greatest compliment anyone could
pay me," he said.
Landy said he came into teaching
by "accident", but his students
might say it was fate. "1 came to the
States to do a Ph.D. program and
teaching was part of the program."
Landy said. "Along the way I real
ized that I really loved to teach. This
was the thing that I really wanted to
be doing," he said.
Landy's fondest memories of the
Farm include his experience in
structing Area One classes. "I got
invited to a lot of faculty night din
ners. and 1 came to the conclusion
that Stanford has the best students
in the country. They are enthusias
tic. excited, passionate and ener
getic. They make il all worthwhile,"
he said.
