# Holland takes leave of absence from the English Department
## 
### Alice Brown Staff writer 
Assoc. English Prof. Sharon Holland
announced last week that she will be taking
a leave of absence from Stanford to be a
visiting professor at SUN Y Albany.
Holland has not officially resigned from
the University, however. "I am on leave
from the department, but things could
change." Holland said. "I doubt it. but they
might."
One of the main reasons Holland gave
for her departure and hesitancy about re
turning to Stanford was the University's
tenure process. She would be up for tenure
review next year had she decided to stay.
The English department has been "un
able to tenure anyone for 10 years," Hoi

land said. " That's a rough statistic."
Holland, who is black, is a professor of
American literature, specializing in
African American literature and feminist
theory.
She said her experience at Stanford has
been "positive in terms of my colleagues...
. People have been good to me."
However, fellow English professor
Robert Warrior said. "Sharon's experi
ence here has not always been positive."
Warrior and Holland are quite close:
"Sharon's the best friend that I've made
since I came to Stanford," Warrior said.
Their friendship made it difficult for
Holland to watch Warrior being denied
tenure earlier this year by the Dean of I lu
manities and Science's ()flice.
"I've watched a lot of people go through

a lot of heartache on the issue of tenure,"
1 lolland said, 'it's taken a toll on people in
so many different ways."
Provost Condoleezza Rice expressed
her desire to see Holland come back to
Stanford. "Sharon is someone whose ca
reer I've taken an interest in.and I really
do hope she returns," Rice said.
Both Warrior and Assoc. English Prof.
Paula Moya expressed distress over Hol
land's departure.
"I'm very disappointed," Moya said. "I
think it will be a great loss."
Warrior said he supports her decision to
leave but echoed Moya that her departure
is a "tremendous loss for Stanford." He
went on to say, "I don't know anyone who
lias done more lor students." 1
Warrior hopes that with Hol
land's departure, "everybody ;it
Stanford will give more thought to
the issue of tenure."
Ihe influence of the tenure
process in Holland's decision to
leave raises the familiar issue of
gender and racial discrimination in
the tenure process. According to
\Varrior, there have been more than
30 recent gender discrimination
complaints filed against the I Jniver
sity with the United States Depart
ment of Labor.

Mark Sanders, head of Stan
ford's branch of the NAACI\ said,
"getting a feeling from NAACI'
membership in general, we're all
pretty disappointed in what has
happened."
Sanders is also disappointed in
the I Jniversity.
"I'm disappointed that the Uni
versity hasn't stepped up to the
plate, especially after seeing stu
dents express their feeling of being
upset over" the tenure process,
Sanders said.
Rice responded to such criti
cisms of the tenure process, saying.
"I think that our tenure process is
fair. It's very tough. Init it's entirely
fair."

According to a report Rice deliv
ered lo the Faculty Senate last
month, from 11J74l l J74 to IWI the Uni
versity's overall tenure rate was 40
percent, with women receiving
tenure 45 percent of the time and
men receiving tenure 38 percent of
the time.
"Having been through the
process myself as a junior faculty
member, I remember it as mysteri
ous and difficult," Rice said.
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences Malcolm Beasley
added that "it is a very carefully ex
amined process." I le went on to say.
"I'd be willing to talk to anyone
about specific concerns that people
may have."
