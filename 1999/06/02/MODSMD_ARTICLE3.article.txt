### Alice Brown Staff writer 
Assoc. English Prof. Sharon Holland
announced last week that she will be taking
a leave of absence from Stanford to be a
visiting professor at SUN Y Albany.
Holland has not officially resigned from
the University, however. "I am on leave
from the department, but things could

so many different ways."
Provost Condoleezza Rice expressed
her desire to see Holland come back to

"I'm very disappointed," Moya said. "I
think it will be a great loss."
Warrior said he supports her decision to
