## Ethnic studies at Stanford evaluated and needs longer underkicker 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
I his year's senior class may be the
last to graduate in this millenium, hut
they will be the first to include gradu
ates in Asian American and Chi
cana/o studies.
While ethnic studies activists are
encouraged by this progress, most ac
knowledge that there is a long path
ahead to achieving a level of quality
in ethnic studies that is often present
at Stanford's peer institutions. UC-
Berkeley's recent ethnic studies con
flict highlighted for many the prob
lems within Stanford's own ethnic
studies program. This comes 011 the
heels of the administration's denial of
tenure to Asst. English Prof. Robert
Warrior, one of only three Stanford
professors teaching in the area of Na
tive American Studies.
"The Native American Studies
Program is now facing a crisis, be
cause Prof. Warrior has been denied
tenure." said Albert Camarillo, pro
fessor of history and Comparative
Studies in Race in Ethnicity director.
"This drastically hurts the already
few course offerings in this area.
There needs to be an effort to recruit
and retain more faculty to teach in
these areas."
Concern lor the welfare of ethnic
studies has long prevailed at Stan
ford. The University's formal re
sponse began as a committee chaired
by Political Science Prof. Daniel Oki
moto in 1997. which proposed the es
tablishment of the CRSE Depart
ment.
Within this department students
can major in ('SRE itself or any ol the
four ethnic programs — Asian-
American Studies. African and
African-American Studies, Chi
cana/o Studies and Native American
Studies, in addition to the option of
completing an Individually Designed
Major in Jewish Sltidies.
I he process of developing such
programs, however, has not come

without struggle, according to Rick
Yuen, assistant dean and director of
the Asian American Activities Cen
ter. In the '70s and '80s, only courses
taught by graduate students and visit
ing lecturers from Bay Area Asian
communities offered interested stu
dents any exposure to Asian Ameri
can Studies.
Asian American Studies contin
ued, complemented by the introduc
tion of an Asian theme dorm, initial
ly Junipero, now Okada, and the es
tablishment of the Asian America
Activities Center, which was first
housed in the Fire Truck House. No
faculty with specialties in the area
were being hired, however, and
events eventually escalated to a stu
dent protest and takeover of the
President's Office, with students
making several demands, including
the hiring of a tenured professor to
teach Asian American Studies.
Since that time three professors
specializing in Asian American Stud
ies have been hired, and. along with
the support of adjunct faculty, there is
considerable hope for growth, ac
cording to Gordon Chang, assoc.
prof, of history and chair ol the Asian
American Studies Program.
African and African American
Studies at Stanford was horn amidst
the same kind of controversy. In
19bS, at a speech given by the provost
in Memorial Auditorium days after
the assassination of Martin Luther
King, Jr., 70 Black Student Union
members stormed the stage and com
mandeered the microphone, de
manding. among other things, pro
portional representation of minori
ties in incoming classes and a greater
commitment to recruiting minority
students and hiring minority faculty.
Since then, the African and
African American Studies Program
has developed as part of part of
( SRE, but according to students, not
to the extent visible at other schools
of Stanford's caliber and not to stu
dents' satisfaction.

"These programs are supposed to
get stronger under C'SRE. but we'll
see. Of course it's all very new. but it
doesn't seem to be a priority with the
University." said sophomore Maria
ma White-Hammond, a member of
the BSU.
"Students have made more than a
show of good will in terms of helping
the I Jniversity," she said, "but faculty
in other departments have enough to
do already without the added respon
sibility of ethnic studies. That's the
University's responsibility."
Faculty responsibility includes
the issue of the faculty teaching
courses in the CSRE catalogue.
CSRE does not hire any of its own
faculty; it cross-lists pertinent cours
es from all the University's depart
ments to produce a group of classes
from which students can form a
major. Today there are between 140
and 150 courses, according to Ca
marillo, with <SN students working on
CSRE majors and 12 doing minors.
"Ethnic studies has been, and
continues to be. seen as a non-main
stream type of resesareh," said Ca
marillo. "Therefore it's more diffi
cult to get departments to appoint.

maintain and therefore promote,
people who do ethnic studies work.
This is not a problem unique to Stan
ford or Berkeley. All universities suf
fer from a shortage of faculty in these
areas."
Chicana/o Studies has had a simi
larly difficult time gaining ground.
Although students had always ex
pressed the need for courses and
scholars in this area at Stanford, it was
not until l 994 when four women went
on a hunger strike demanding a ( hi
cana/o Studies curriculum of some
sort that any progress was made, ac
cording to junior Genevieve Aguilar.
Aguilar teaches a course titled
Trends and Traditions in Chicana/o
Activism with fellow student activist
Maribel Ledezma.
"In the years following the hunger
strike, a curriculum committee was
formed to realize the goal of Chi
cana/o Studies Program, but it was
not until 1997 that the program was
made a reality," Aguilar said.
Though Aguilar remains opti
mistic about the program's expan
sion. she stressed the need for the
University's continued commitment
to developing the area.

In May of 1994, more than 250 students rallied in support of four Chi
cana students on hunger strikes. The students demanded a Univer

community center in East Palo Alto and a high-level job for Cecilia
Burciaga, a Chicana senior administrator laid off earlier that year.
