# South Asian funds, classes gain ground
## 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
Although the push to bring some
form of a South Asian Studies pro
gram to Stanford has been years in
the making, it has not been until re
cent months that these efforts,
largely conducted by students and
faculty in tandem, have come to a
head, in the form of funding and
new classes.
Issues of tenure have also been
especially pertinent, particularly in
the denials of tenure to Assoc. An
thropology Prof. Akhil Gupta, a de
cision that was reversed, and, most
recently. Asst. English Prof. Suvir
Kaul.
Beginning in the early 1970s with
student and faculty efforts, the initi
tative for South Asian studies has
continued throughout the past
three decades, culminating this year
in what appears to be a serious fac
ulty and student initiative to
strengthen the University's focus on
that region.
In recent years students and fac
ulty have coalesced around a plan to
jointly implement more classes with
a South Asian focus in the hopes of
sending a message to University ad
ministration about the need for
such classes.
Working with that general senti
ment, a small group of students,
made up of now-graduate Tej Nan
dury, juniors Guru Sethupathy and
Ankur Shah and sophomore Aimer
Khan, has spent the past year meet
ing with administrators, faculty and
other students to develop a pro
gram of study and a funding base,
founded primarily in. but not limit
ed to, Silicon Valley corporations.
Since then the Stanford adminis
tration has given the Institute for
International Studies' Asia / Pacific
Research Center $250,000 for re
search and new seminars and lec
tures on topics related to South

Asia. "While this is a very small
step." Sethupathy said, "it is defi
nitely a step in the right direction."
Once this type of interest and
support was communicated be
tween student activists and the ad
ministration, the coordinators of
this venture organized an open
meeting through Sanskriti. Stan
ford's South Asian student organi
zation. to publicize their actions and
gain more student support.
The turnout for this meeting
was, for the coordinators and in
volved faculty, encouraging, with
more than 30 people from the Stan
ford community present. There stu
dents were given a chance to sug
gest ideas for new classes and talk
about their experiences in Stan
ford's few South Asia-related class
es.
"The future depends on a solid
core group of students that are com
mitted to this effort and are willing
to pursue this consistently as well as
on communication with faculty,"
Sethupathy said. "The students'
support, especially from under
classmen is absolutely crucial."
The coordinators of this meet
ing, Sethupathy said, also used it to
urge students to attend the latest
addition to the roster of Stanford
courses in South Asian studies â€” a
class called Anthropology 131:
"Silent Voices: The Perspectives of
India's Underclass."
The class was organized with the
sponsorship of Gupta by students
who had spent time in India
through a Stanford-sponsored pro
gram and who wished to share
something of their experience with
fellow undergraduates
Students viewed this night-time
lecture series as a good way to drum
up student interest and prove to the
administration that there was con
siderable student support for any
