# South Asian funds, classes gain ground
## 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
Although the push to bring some
form of a South Asian Studies pro
gram to Stanford has been years in
the making, it has not been until re
cent months that these efforts,
largely conducted by students and
faculty in tandem, have come to a
head, in the form of funding and
new classes.
Issues of tenure have also been
especially pertinent, particularly in
the denials of tenure to Assoc. An
thropology Prof. Akhil Gupta, a de
cision that was reversed, and, most
recently. Asst. English Prof. Suvir
Kaul.
Beginning in the early 1970s with
student and faculty efforts, the initi
tative for South Asian studies has
continued throughout the past
three decades, culminating this year
in what appears to be a serious fac
ulty and student initiative to
strengthen the University's focus on
that region.
In recent years students and fac
ulty have coalesced around a plan to
jointly implement more classes with
a South Asian focus in the hopes of
sending a message to University ad
ministration about the need for
such classes.
Working with that general senti
ment, a small group of students,
made up of now-graduate Tej Nan
dury, juniors Guru Sethupathy and
Ankur Shah and sophomore Aimer
Khan, has spent the past year meet
ing with administrators, faculty and
other students to develop a pro
gram of study and a funding base,
founded primarily in. but not limit
ed to, Silicon Valley corporations.
Since then the Stanford adminis
tration has given the Institute for
International Studies' Asia / Pacific
Research Center $250,000 for re
search and new seminars and lec
tures on topics related to South

Asia. "While this is a very small
step." Sethupathy said, "it is defi
nitely a step in the right direction."
Once this type of interest and
support was communicated be
tween student activists and the ad
ministration, the coordinators of
this venture organized an open
meeting through Sanskriti. Stan
ford's South Asian student organi
zation. to publicize their actions and
gain more student support.
The turnout for this meeting
was, for the coordinators and in
volved faculty, encouraging, with
more than 30 people from the Stan
ford community present. There stu
dents were given a chance to sug
gest ideas for new classes and talk
about their experiences in Stan
ford's few South Asia-related class
es.
"The future depends on a solid
core group of students that are com
mitted to this effort and are willing
to pursue this consistently as well as
on communication with faculty,"
Sethupathy said. "The students'
support, especially from under
classmen is absolutely crucial."
The coordinators of this meet
ing, Sethupathy said, also used it to
urge students to attend the latest
addition to the roster of Stanford
courses in South Asian studies — a
class called Anthropology 131:
"Silent Voices: The Perspectives of
India's Underclass."
The class was organized with the
sponsorship of Gupta by students
who had spent time in India
through a Stanford-sponsored pro
gram and who wished to share
something of their experience with
fellow undergraduates
Students viewed this night-time
lecture series as a good way to drum
up student interest and prove to the
administration that there was con
siderable student support for any
initiative in the area of South Asian
studies. The class, consistently at
tended by about 15 to 20 people,
was, in that respect, a success. Next
year a similarly structured class or
ganized by a separate group of stu
dents and faculty w ill be offered.
This new class will probably con
sist of South Asian scholars from
Stanford and other institutions
speaking to the group every other
week; discussions on the speakers
being held in the interim periods.
Work is also being done to estab
lish a Web site on South Asia at
Stanford, detailing all South Asia
related activities, from student
groups to speakers and seminars, as
well as hosting a colloquium for
Stanford students who have done
work in India through the Haas

Center and other programs.
Additionally the appearance of a
number of smaller classes dealing with
sundry South Asian issues, including
diaspora and literature, has shed a fa
vorable light on the movement.
This student effort, however, will
be strengthened by improvements
being made to the History 186A:
"Modern India" class taught every
other year by Gupta and History
Prof. Mark Mancall. The class focus
will be widened to include all of
South Asia, as opposed to the cur
rent curriculum, which is dominated
by India, and higher-level courses
will begin with the introductory
course as a prerequisite.
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Purni
ma Mankekar will also be working
with Mancall and Gupta on the
"Modern India" course in addition
to the other classes on South Asia
she currently teaches.
One of the particular problems
for this course, Mancall said, has

been the dearth of graduate stu
dents to serve as section leaders for
this course. Without graduate stu
dents in South Asian studies, there
is no pool at Stanford from which to
draw teaching assistants. Still "it is
most important for students to real
ize that the faculty is working on this
and we are optimistic," Mancall
said. "But this is not a quick process.
It is an intellectual activity that
draws on years of experience, so it
takes time to develop. Wherever we
turn, there's a need."
Another area of development on
the minds of those concerned cen
ters around religious studies.
"You expect coming to a school
as prestigious as Stanford that peo
ple would be more aware of an area
that is home to one billion people,
but though the Religious Studies
Department has been receptive, this
doesn't seem to be a priority for the
University," said junior Nauman
Khan, who is involved in the closely

related effort for strengthened Is
lamic studies.
Although there is also a particu
lar interest in developing the lan
guage and literature aspects of
South Asian studies further, this de
velopment has been prevented by
what concerned groups view as
major obstacles.
First only introductory courses
are offered in South Asian lan
guages, preventing students serious
about the study of these languages
from pursuing their interest at Stan
ford. Though there has been a great
deal of interest on the part of the
Hindi teacher, Tej Singh, to teach
both a first and second-year course,
the University has not allowed it.
saying that one could be taught each
year, but not both.
Second, with few South Asian
scholars currently teaching at Stan
ford, there is strong student senti
ment that the University is not com
mitted to retaining the faculty nec

essary for developing South Asia as
an area of study.
The denial of tenure to Kaul,
whose departure was termed a
"tremendous loss" by Mancall,
speaks directly to this issue.
Though Kaul's area of expertise
is in 18th-century British literature,
he taught a freshman seminar this
year on South Asian writing in Eng
lish, and, according to Mancall.
would have been an integral part of
the expanded "Modern India"
course.
The issue of tenure is a large one
first visited in this arena with
Gupta. When the University denied
Gupta tenure in 1996. many of his
students and colleagues opposed
the decision, which was eventually
reversed.
However. Kaul said. "It is very
difficult to link issues of tenure to is
sues of the University's commit
ment to developing any area of
study because the University won't

allow that link to be made."
' The University is committed to
the development of a certain form of
Asian Studies, specifically of the Pa
cific Rim, compared to Berkeley,
where there is also a major commit
ment to South Asia," Kaul said.
"Having said that, 1 have seen inter
est in other departments." 1
A number of students have also
mentioned this support, which
comes from classes loosely focused
on South Asian studies in individual
departments, but it lacks the overar
ching support of the University in
the opinions of many to gain any sig
nificant ground.
As Khan stated, "The University
has never taken the initiative to de
velop studies of the Middle East and
South Asia, but that may change
with the shifting political climate.
Still it is appalling if Stanford stu
dents don't have classroom support
to understand these issues and oth
ers of the area."

ford. Though there has been a great
deal of interest on the part of the
Hindi teacher, Tej Singh, to teach
both a first and second-year course,
the University has not allowed it.
saying that one could be taught each
year, but not both.
Second, with few South Asian
scholars currently teaching at Stan
ford, there is strong student senti
ment that the University is not com
mitted to retaining the faculty nec

essary for developing South Asia as
an area of study.
The denial of tenure to Kaul,
whose departure was termed a
"tremendous loss" by Mancall,
speaks directly to this issue.
Though Kaul's area of expertise
is in 18th-century British literature,
he taught a freshman seminar this
year on South Asian writing in Eng
lish, and, according to Mancall.
would have been an integral part of
the expanded "Modern India"
course.
The issue of tenure is a large one
first visited in this arena with
Gupta. When the University denied
Gupta tenure in 1996. many of his
students and colleagues opposed
the decision, which was eventually
reversed.
However. Kaul said. "It is very
difficult to link issues of tenure to is
sues of the University's commit
ment to developing any area of
study because the University won't

allow that link to be made."
' The University is committed to
the development of a certain form of
Asian Studies, specifically of the Pa
cific Rim, compared to Berkeley,
where there is also a major commit
ment to South Asia," Kaul said.
"Having said that, 1 have seen inter
est in other departments." 1
A number of students have also
mentioned this support, which
comes from classes loosely focused
on South Asian studies in individual
departments, but it lacks the overar
ching support of the University in
the opinions of many to gain any sig
nificant ground.
As Khan stated, "The University
has never taken the initiative to de
velop studies of the Middle East and
South Asia, but that may change
with the shifting political climate.
Still it is appalling if Stanford stu
dents don't have classroom support
to understand these issues and oth
ers of the area."
Although the push to bring some
form of a South Asian Studies pro
gram to Stanford has been years in
the making, it has not been until re
cent months that these efforts,
largely conducted by students and
faculty in tandem, have come to a
head, in the form of funding and
new classes.
Issues of tenure have also been
especially pertinent, particularly in
the denials of tenure to Assoc. An
thropology Prof. Akhil Gupta, a de
cision that was reversed, and, most
recently. Asst. English Prof. Suvir
Kaul.
Beginning in the early 1970s with
student and faculty efforts, the initi
tative for South Asian studies has
continued throughout the past
three decades, culminating this year
in what appears to be a serious fac
ulty and student initiative to
strengthen the University's focus on
that region.
In recent years students and fac
ulty have coalesced around a plan to
jointly implement more classes with
a South Asian focus in the hopes of
sending a message to University ad
ministration about the need for
such classes.
Working with that general senti
ment, a small group of students,
made up of now-graduate Tej Nan
dury, juniors Guru Sethupathy and
Ankur Shah and sophomore Aimer
Khan, has spent the past year meet
ing with administrators, faculty and
other students to develop a pro
gram of study and a funding base,
founded primarily in. but not limit
ed to, Silicon Valley corporations.
Since then the Stanford adminis
tration has given the Institute for
International Studies' Asia / Pacific
Research Center $250,000 for re
search and new seminars and lec
tures on topics related to South

Asia. "While this is a very small
step." Sethupathy said, "it is defi
nitely a step in the right direction."
Once this type of interest and
support was communicated be
tween student activists and the ad
ministration, the coordinators of
this venture organized an open
meeting through Sanskriti. Stan
ford's South Asian student organi
zation. to publicize their actions and
gain more student support.
The turnout for this meeting
was, for the coordinators and in
volved faculty, encouraging, with
more than 30 people from the Stan
ford community present. There stu
dents were given a chance to sug
gest ideas for new classes and talk
about their experiences in Stan
ford's few South Asia-related class
es.
"The future depends on a solid
core group of students that are com
mitted to this effort and are willing
to pursue this consistently as well as
on communication with faculty,"
Sethupathy said. "The students'
support, especially from under
classmen is absolutely crucial."
The coordinators of this meet
ing, Sethupathy said, also used it to
urge students to attend the latest
addition to the roster of Stanford
courses in South Asian studies — a
class called Anthropology 131:
"Silent Voices: The Perspectives of
India's Underclass."
The class was organized with the
sponsorship of Gupta by students
who had spent time in India
through a Stanford-sponsored pro
gram and who wished to share
something of their experience with
fellow undergraduates
Students viewed this night-time
lecture series as a good way to drum
up student interest and prove to the
administration that there was con
siderable student support for any
initiative in the area of South Asian
studies. The class, consistently at
tended by about 15 to 20 people,
was, in that respect, a success. Next
year a similarly structured class or
ganized by a separate group of stu
dents and faculty w ill be offered.
This new class will probably con
sist of South Asian scholars from
Stanford and other institutions
speaking to the group every other
week; discussions on the speakers
being held in the interim periods.
Work is also being done to estab
lish a Web site on South Asia at
Stanford, detailing all South Asia
related activities, from student
groups to speakers and seminars, as
well as hosting a colloquium for
Stanford students who have done
work in India through the Haas

Center and other programs.
Additionally the appearance of a
number of smaller classes dealing with
sundry South Asian issues, including
diaspora and literature, has shed a fa
vorable light on the movement.
This student effort, however, will
be strengthened by improvements
being made to the History 186A:
"Modern India" class taught every
other year by Gupta and History
Prof. Mark Mancall. The class focus
will be widened to include all of
South Asia, as opposed to the cur
rent curriculum, which is dominated
by India, and higher-level courses
will begin with the introductory
course as a prerequisite.
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Purni
ma Mankekar will also be working
with Mancall and Gupta on the
"Modern India" course in addition
to the other classes on South Asia
she currently teaches.
One of the particular problems
for this course, Mancall said, has

been the dearth of graduate stu
dents to serve as section leaders for
this course. Without graduate stu
dents in South Asian studies, there
is no pool at Stanford from which to
draw teaching assistants. Still "it is
most important for students to real
ize that the faculty is working on this
and we are optimistic," Mancall
said. "But this is not a quick process.
It is an intellectual activity that
draws on years of experience, so it
takes time to develop. Wherever we
turn, there's a need."
Another area of development on
the minds of those concerned cen
ters around religious studies.
"You expect coming to a school
as prestigious as Stanford that peo
ple would be more aware of an area
that is home to one billion people,
but though the Religious Studies
Department has been receptive, this
doesn't seem to be a priority for the
University," said junior Nauman
Khan, who is involved in the closely

related effort for strengthened Is
lamic studies.
Although there is also a particu
lar interest in developing the lan
guage and literature aspects of
South Asian studies further, this de
velopment has been prevented by
what concerned groups view as
major obstacles.
First only introductory courses
are offered in South Asian lan
guages, preventing students serious
about the study of these languages
from pursuing their interest at Stan
ford. Though there has been a great
deal of interest on the part of the
Hindi teacher, Tej Singh, to teach
both a first and second-year course,
the University has not allowed it.

The denial of tenure to Kaul,
whose departure was termed a
"tremendous loss" by Mancall,
speaks directly to this issue.

is in 18th-century British literature,
he taught a freshman seminar this
