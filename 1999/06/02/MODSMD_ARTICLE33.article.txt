# Challenging entrepreneurs
## 
### Rebecca Sullivan 
The engine has been ignited in the
rocket ship of entrepreneurial aspira
tions at Stanford. Last Thursday, stu
dent teams received awards for their
entries in the annual Entrepreneur's
Challenge, sponsored bv the Busi
ness Association of Stanford Engi
neering Students.
A $25,000 cash prize was divid
ed among the top three projects
chosen from the original 68 entries.
ImaCien. composed of electrical
engineering and business students,
shared first place with Summit, an
all-female group of MBA students.
A team that calls its project "Mus
ic Cop.com" took third place.
BASES' mission statement is to
"provide an environment for Stan
ford engineering students to learn
about entrepreneurial business," said
Ted Acworth, a doctoral student in
mechanical engineering and a vice
president of BASES.

The awards banquet, held at the
Stanford Park Hotel, concluded the
four-month long process of project
development and planning. Students
from all disciplines had the opportu
nity to share their skills and formu
late business ideas individually and
through a series of instructional
workshops.
The Challenge "has been in
credibly helpful in developing our
business," said junior William
Spencer, member of a team called
"Woosh." The requirements for
concrete business plans meant that
teams had to work under constant
deadline pressures. Teammate
Ralph Garvin emphasized the use
fulness of being in contact with the
investment community and its crit
ical eye.
The teams entered the competi
tion in February and went through
three rounds of judging, which re
sulted in the final awards last week.
Mike Lyons, an associate professor

in industrial engineering, said, "We
are very excited and pleased with
the award given to
Music Cop.com." The product was
initially developed in Lyons' In
dustrial Engineering 273 course,
"Technology Venture Formation."
last fall.
Music Cop.com is a software prod
uct that permits music producers to
search for unauthorized copies of
music on the Internet. Lyons said
that due to the team's involvement
with Entrepreneur's Challenge, they
are now "talking to a number of in
vestors" who are interested in the
product.
ImaCien has received a jump-start
as well, with its $10,000 award. Head
ed by electrical engineering student
Rob Batchko, the team plans to
make low-cost laser-projection dis
plays for highway billboards. The dis
plays use optics research developed
in the physics department, Acworth
said.
