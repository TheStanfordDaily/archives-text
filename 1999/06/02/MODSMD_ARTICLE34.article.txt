# Former folk singer talks of his conversion to Islam
## 
### Lilly Irani Contributing writer 
In the heat of noon yesterday. White
Plaza filled with about 150 students, facul
ty and other members of the Stanford
community eager to see Yusuf Islam, for
merly known as Cat Stevens, speak about
his journey to the Islamic religion. The
crowd was speckled with women wearing
the cluuior, ;i typical sign of Islamic faith, as
well as old fans, stalled passers-by and stu
dents just interested in the Islamic religion.
The crowd broke into applause as
Islam, bearded and wearing a beige suit
and Hush Puppies, took the microphone
and greeted his audience.
*"Bch esnieh Allah, rahnuineh r/ihim. In
the name of God, most gracious, most
merciful," he began, greeting audience
members with the first line of Muslim
prayer.
Seated and relaxed despite the bright
sun. he told the story of the search for spir
ituality that led him to the Islamic religion
and addressed various rumors circulated
about him since his conversion.
"What makes a rock star put his head to
the ground in a religion that seems ex
tremely alien? You'd have to know the
kind of person I was to understand who I

am today, and in the show business it's
hard to build a person's identity." Islam ex
plained.
Growing up in London's West End as
Stephen Demitri Georgiou. Islam was
raised Greek Orthodox but attended
Roman Catholic schools, a background to
which he attributed his religious tolerance.
In his late teens he entered the music busi
ness in the wake of the Beatles and the
Rolling Stones and took the name Cat
Stevens. At that time, though, his concerns
were economic, not spiritual.
"I couldn't imagine anyone going to the
record store and asking for that Stephen
Demitri Georgiou album. And in Eng
land. and I was sure in America, they loved
animals.'* Islam said, explaining his name
change.
In his early twenties Islam contracted a
near-fatal case of tuberculosis. Influenced
by the trends toward vegetarianism and
transcendental meditation, he began to
search lor answers to his questions about
the world.
"I found that my songs were asking
questions." Islam said. "But I wasaverseto
religious dogma .... I wanted a more spir
itual way ol finding what's right and
wrong."
During this personal search, Islam

wrote some of his most well-known songs,
such as "Peace Train."
"In 'Peace Train." I never said where
the train was going. I didn't know. The
train was a symbol, rolling on the edge of
darkness," Islam said.
In his search for answers, Islam turned
to Buddhism. Eastern mysticism and even
Pythagoras of his own Greek heritage.
However, it was not his own search, but his
brother David's travels that led him to the
Islamic religion. After returning from a
trip to Jerusalem, David bought a copy of
the Koran as a present for his brother.
For Islam reading the Koran was a
shocking experience. 1 le described his sur
prise at learning that Muslims believed in a
single God. I le was also struck that when
described in the Koran. Jesus, David.
Noah and other Christian figures are treat
ed with as much respect as they are in the
Bible. One year after lie began his reading
of the Koran, Islam converted and
changed his name.
"The more I read the Koran, the more
I realized that deep down I understood the
words." Islam said. "There is one Lord,
one family of humanity."
Though his new religion required him
to change his lifestyle. Islam emphasized
that, contrarv to rumor, lie was not re

quired to denounce his music.
"1 didn't read anything in the Ou'ran
against singing, but the Koran forbade a lot
of things, like fornication and drinking. I
thought, 'The music business is full of
that,"' Islam said.
Islam consulted with an imam, a Mus
lim leader, to discuss his doubts about re
maining in the music business. The imam
advised him to continue recording albums
but to stop performing live, because fan
enthusiasm for live performers sometimes
approaches idolatry, according to Muslim
tenets.
"Mohammed forbids frivolous enter
tainment. But there are times and circum
stances when music is right. Socially cohe
sive. moral times, when we're emphasizing
what's good, are times for music," Islam
explained.
"When 1 stopped my music career, peo
ple thought I'd gone crazy. I knew exactly
what I was doing. I just couldn't explain it,"
Islam said.
The White Plaza audience reacted
warmly to Yusef Islam's words of faith.
"When a person chooses religion and
decides that this is going to be their road to
living a worthy, directed life, the name of
the religion doesn't matter," freshman
Christine Hoffman said.
