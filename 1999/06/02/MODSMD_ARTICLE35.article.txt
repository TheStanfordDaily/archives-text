Ladies and gentlemen of the class of '99:
Wear clothes.
If I could offer you only one tip for the future, clothes would be it.
The long term benefits of clothes have been proven by my mom, whereas the rest of my
advice has no basis more reliable than my own drunken hallucinations.
Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to
make sense out of sorority rush. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never
crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on an idle Tuesday when
you're looking fora parking spot by Suites and you realize you don't have a car.
Do one thing every day that scares your neighbors.
Sing. Actually, please don't.
Don't be reckless with poodles. They have feelings too.
Gyrate.
Don't waste your time on integrity. Nine out of 10 people in insane asylums have integrity.
Remember compliments you receive. Share them with your friends and random acquain
tances. Tell everyone on the subway how hot you are. Return insults. When in doubt, say "1
know you are but what am I."
Keep your old love letters. Blow them up poster size, then give them to your ex-boyfriend's
new girlfriend. She'll probably recognize his original sonnet.
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what to do with your life. The most interesting people I
know didn't know as seniors what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most inter
esting 40-year-olds 1 know still don't. They tell me about it all the time as they wrap themselves
up in a blanket and roll their shopping carts down University Avenue, mumbling "Give 'em the
Axe! The Axe! The Axe!"
Remember, there's always consulting.
Get plenty of silicone. Be kind to your boobs. In most guy's minds, they're all you've got.
Jazz hands.
Maybe you'll marry, probably not because you're ugly and you snore. Maybe you'll have chil
dren, I hope not. The only way to know is to play MASH.
Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. But remember, after graduation you are no longer
in a fraternity or the LSJUMB. Nudity is not acceptable.
Dance, even if your moves come from Backstreet Boys videos.
Read the Cliff Notes. Even if they're long.
Do not read The Daily. It will only confuse you.
Get to know your parents. Parents spelled backwards = free food. Be nice to your siblings.
When your start-up company fails, you can sleep on their couch.
Understand that friends come and go, but the shoes you borrowed from them and forgot to
return before graduation are yours forever.
Live in New York City once, but leave before you have to strip to pay rent. Live in Northern
California once, but leave before you always call San Francisco "the City," even when you're in
a foreign country.
Travel.
Send your bill to the Bings.
Accept certain inalienable truths: the Draw will screw you over, Wilbur food is hepatitis
infested, and the URO will pay lor you to practice interpretive dance in Micronesia. And when
in Micronesia, you'll imagine that you spent four years in Bob, Wilbur food rocked and you
actually dated.
Respect inflatable penguins.
Don't expect anyone else to support you, unless you have really big boobs.
Don't mess too much with your hair. Trends come and go, but spiral perms are always bad
news.
Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it.
1 recommend the Psychic Friends Network.
But trust me on the clothes.
