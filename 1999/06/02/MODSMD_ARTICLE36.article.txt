# A
						fond farewell from two special pricks
## 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
As you probably already know, this year's
graduation speech will be delivered by
American poet laureate Robert Pinsky. What
you probably haven't heard is that Schmuck
and Putz were asked to give the commence
ment address months before Pinsky
Schminsky ever was considered for the
honor.
Unfortunately, some of the best laid plans
in life go awry: Harvard paid us more. But
just so you don't feel deprived, we present you
this week in our final column with excerpts
from our would-be commencement oration
— in the form of a poem of course:
You do not do, you do not do,
Any more, black shoe.
Goodbye, Farewell, Au Revoir, Adieu,
We come to bring advice to you:
We see you off with our friend Condi,
To I-bank, to consult, to design Mondi,
Before you leave, be sure to give a kiss to your PHE,
And have a chat with Casper over wine and brie.
When you ever decide to insult,
Make sure you choose an unpopular cult,
Not the Women's Center, sororities or frats,
Trust us, kiddos, they'll beat you with bats.
We moved along from films to Diversions,
Though some may opt to call it Perversions,
Our one pathetic critic for one,
Get a lite and do something, hon.
Frederprick took your pictures in White Plaza Watch,
Some people spoke right out of their crotch.
You read the ramblings of Brittney and Bob,
They won't be back next year—they're getting a job.
Our artist in residence, the lovely Abby Shaw,
Is taking off next year to do something raw,
Little did Hustler know she could draw
Such acts that came so close to breaking the law.

They edited us a bit to avoid scandal,
They tried to keep us down with a firm handle,
Lucky for us, Jim understood,
And let us say what no other would.
Dining Services now spits in our food,
Cowell Health Center thinks that we're crude,
Making fun of Tri Delts might not have been shrewd,
Because we were lewd, we'll never be screwed.
Some of you atheletes are headed to the pros,
The poets among you will end up writing prose,
Still others, more ambitious, are off to L.A.,
In hope of becoming an actor one day.
Ahh, the life of the child actor is not for me,
It's no loss that Princeton stole J IT,
But Natalie Portman is off to Harvard Square,
The Star Wars queen hopefully won't pull out her hair.
The Farm is clearly the place to be,
With the horses, the profs, you and me,
Together as one we celebrate our Tree,
And make fun of all with clever Sand P.

We come to the final words of our story,
It's been exciting in these moments of glory,
If you've been at all inspired by our works,
Page us, fax us, contact our agent — just one of our
perks.



Make us proud and go get 'em, kiddos!
