# A 						trip down memory lane with the sexy gallant
## 
### Bob Gates 
For this, his last column of a filmy, opaque Diversions career,
gallant, sexy reporter Bob Gates has decided to stop drunk dri
ving his golf cart around campus in search of a story and switch
from the third to the first person.
Yes, today 1 would like to walk down the aisle of memory
instead of the white line used to test my sobriety and bring to
my loyal readers some of the Stanford experiences that I have
had that were truly "funny."
Who out of the class of '99 will ever forget that first night at
Stanford, when we gathered as a group for the first time and fol
lowed the Band to the Quad. ... As we jumped with Cardinal
pride to the tune of "All Right Now," our eyes moved ever
upwards until our gaze rested on the cross atop MemChu, where
a completely naked man braced his arms on the horizontal
beam so that he faced outward as he thrust his pelvis to the
rhythm of his own drummer towards his adoring masses below.
The distance and the darkness of the late hour combined to
assure his anonymity. But my new roommate's camera with its
telephoto lens revealed to us the exhibitionist tendencies of our
fearless leader, Gerhard Casper.
Who could ever forget the first time that they stood atop
Hoover Tower....
Who could ever forget the first time they sat atop the Claw?

Who could ever forget the Flood. ... We answered our
University's cry for help and salvaged books from the basement
of Green Library. We frolicked in the raging torrent that was the
Row. We ran to Lake Lag to stick three-foot long straws in the
mud to ensure the tiger salamander's air supply. When the water
had subsided, we lied about how the Flood had ruined our bicy
cles and forced the University's insurance to buy us new ones.
Which of us who has ever checked his or her PO box will for
get reaching into his or her aforementioned box and grabbing
hold of a certain amorous postal employee's tendency to hit on
post office customers....
Who of us from the South will ever forget the first lecture they
had from their resident fellow on political correctness....
Who will ever forget the last time they said goodbye to their
parents before they came to Stanford.... I said goodbye to my
mother at the airport at home, and 1 told her to steel herself
because I had decided that 75 percent of my college education
was going to take place outside of the classroom. Well, that
ended up being more like 85-90 percent, and, honestly, I would
n't trade any of those percentage points back. (Because if I did,
I wouldn't be able to make as much fun of my management con
sultant friends. Damn sell-outs. All of you.)
SO, I'll end this column here. But before I fade into the galac
tically stupid, I urge each and every one of you to tell those you Â»
love you love 'em, take the unit minimum every spring quarter
and smile every once in a while.
