# University reacts to racist e-mail
## Investigation into incident ongoing 
### Nina Cassidy Anuj Gupta Contributing writers 
After an unidentified haeker pos
ing as a Stanford doctoral student
sent a racist, vulgar e-mail to nearly
everyone on campus. University offi
cials are conducting investigations
into the incident.
They are promising swift discipli
nary measures for the perpetrator.
Meanwhile many students are de
manding the University take strong
action to deal with the situation.
In a statement sent to all 3().(XX)
Leland e-mail users, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper said, "When
and if the perpetrator of this unso
licited mail is identified, we shall use
all the means available to us to take

appropriate action. University poli
cies concerning computer and net
work use are well articulated."
Dean of Students Marc Wais said
the incident is being treated as a vio
lation of multiple University policies.
Wais cited the Fundamental Stan
dard. which calls on students to act as
"good citizens" and the Computer
and Network Usage Policy, which
dictates that University software
users must respect "rights of other
computer users." as applicable to the
situation. Failure to meet the policies
of the Fundamental Standard can re
sult in removal from the University.
"The University plans to pursue
this case under the Fundamental
Standard, the Computer Network
Usage Policy and that the party or
parties are held accountable for their
actions within the limits of the law,"
Wais said.
The e-mail, which contained
racial slurs for blacks and Latinos,
was sent at 6 a.m. Saturday morning.
and appeared from the sender ad
dress to have been sent by Prisdha
Dharma, a doctoral student in Engi
neering-Economic Systems and Op
erations Research.
I iowever Dharma set up an auto
response message that was sent to
anyone who attempted to e-mail him.
" I can assure you that it was a forgery
and I did not send any such e-mail...
I would like to apologize if anyone
was offended by that e-mail and reaf
firm that I do not hold any such views
as expressed in that offensive e
mail," the message read.
In his statement Casper con
firmed that Dharma is not believed
to have been involved.
"In the world of information tech
nology it is very easy to mislead about
identities. The Stanford police at pre
sent do not believe that the alleged
source is the author, and the comput
er security specialist has concluded
that the message was not posted from
his account," Casper said.
The initial e-mail also contained a
link to a Getx'ities Web site that
claimed to be Dharma's homepage.
The Web site included a picture of
Dharma. as well as an anti-Semitic,
anti-black document "praising God
for AIDS."
The document was labeled as an
excerpt from Dharma's current dis
sertation. In actuality it was discov
ered to be a near word-for-word tran
scription of a speech given by Geor
gia white supremacist J.B. Stoner at
an Aryan Nations Congress in 1994.
The Web site has since been shut
down, although it is unclear who shut
it down.
According to computer security
officials, the e-mail was sent Saturday
morning from a server in Escondido
Village.
Stanford Police Chief Marv Her
rington said that his department is
now treating that server as a crime
scene, and police are fingerprinting
the area. Officers are also taking
steps to ensure Dharma's safety.
The content of the message iin

mediately provoked strong reactions
from students and University offi
cials alike.
"I was outraged and immediately
saddened," said Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James Montoya. "1
knew that it would be devastating to
members of our community that
someone would use this kind of lan
guage and send such a hateful mes
sage."
"It was shocking. When I first got
it I just sat there.... You always
know that things like that happen,
that sentiments like that exist, but it's
just shocking to have them presented
right before your eyes," said junior
Mark Sanders, a Black Student
Union representative.
Sophomore Tiana Murillo, co
chair elect of MEChA, the Chi
cano / Latino student group on cam
pus, described her reaction as one of
"initial disgust that anything that is so
pernicious and hateful to so many
groups could have been written.'"
Immediate outcry at the e-mail's
content from hundreds of students
prompted University administration
to hold an open meeting on Sunday.
The meeting, which was marked
by tension, brought more than 100
students together with Montoya,
Wais, and representatives of the
Computer Security Office and Stan
ford Police in a conference room at
Tresidder Union.
Murillo called the University's
promises for diversity discussions
stemming from the incident "hypo
critical."
"Students here at the University
need to get a diverse array of per
spectives. In order to do this we need
diverse faculty, but the University
continues to deny tenure to people of
color," she said.
Many students also expressed
anger that Casper was not present at
the meeting to listen to their con
cerns, even though Assistant to the
President Jacqueline Wender was
present.
"The University should foster a
sense of commitment and must de
vote more attention to diversity, and
there needs to be a frank and open
dialogue— I would like for Casper

to have a personal dialogue with the
students to address these concerns,"
said freshman Rita Rico.
Montoya said he would commu
nicate student concerns to Casper.
"I will be conferring with Presi
dent Casper as a direct result of this
meeting ... because we know that we
will want to make certain that there
are opportunities for students to dis
cuss their concerns," he said.
Some students also said they be
lieved that this incident has the po
tential to affect race relations on
campus. "Something like this has the
potential to increase racial tension on
this campus. A lot of times people
forget how deep this problem really
is," Sanders said.
Wais acknowledged this possibili
ty, saying that administration will try
to alleviate the tension by keeping in
touch with students. However he said
that the timing of the incident com
plicates the situation.
"I'm kind of looking at this prag
matically in terms of the timing.
There's only so much we're going to
do since it is Memorial Weekend and
so close to finals," he said.
Montoya admitted that the meet
ing forced the administration to real
ize the problem of race relations on
campus may be greater than previ
ously imagined.
"We need to create opportunities
for students, faculty and staff to dis
cuss these issues The message
that we take home from the meeting
is that there is still so much work to be
done toward helping students of
color feel like they belong here at
Stanford," he said.
This weekend's e-mail was not the
first one to stir racial tensions at Stan
ford this year. In February an anony
mous e-mail was sent to students of
Law School visiting Prof. Kendell
Thomas, who is black. It questioned
Thomas' abilities as a scholar, profes
sor and lawyer due to his race.
At that time Law School students
were angered not only by the anony
mous e-mail but also by Law School
Dean Paul Brest's response. Brest
denounced the attack on Thomas but
defended the author's First Amend
ment rights of anonymity.

er security specialist has concluded
that the message was not posted from
his account," Casper said.
The initial e-mail also contained a
link to a Getx'ities Web site that
claimed to be Dharma's homepage.
The Web site included a picture of
Dharma. as well as an anti-Semitic,
anti-black document "praising God
for AIDS."
The document was labeled as an
excerpt from Dharma's current dis
sertation. In actuality it was discov
ered to be a near word-for-word tran
scription of a speech given by Geor
gia white supremacist J.B. Stoner at
an Aryan Nations Congress in 1994.
The Web site has since been shut
down, although it is unclear who shut
it down.
According to computer security
officials, the e-mail was sent Saturday
morning from a server in Escondido
Village.
Stanford Police Chief Marv Her
rington said that his department is
now treating that server as a crime
scene, and police are fingerprinting
the area. Officers are also taking
steps to ensure Dharma's safety.
The content of the message iin

mediately provoked strong reactions
from students and University offi
cials alike.
"I was outraged and immediately
saddened," said Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James Montoya. "1
knew that it would be devastating to
members of our community that
someone would use this kind of lan
guage and send such a hateful mes
sage."
"It was shocking. When I first got
it I just sat there.... You always
know that things like that happen,
that sentiments like that exist, but it's
just shocking to have them presented
right before your eyes," said junior
Mark Sanders, a Black Student
Union representative.
Sophomore Tiana Murillo, co
chair elect of MEChA, the Chi
cano / Latino student group on cam
pus, described her reaction as one of
"initial disgust that anything that is so
pernicious and hateful to so many
groups could have been written.'"
Immediate outcry at the e-mail's
content from hundreds of students
prompted University administration
to hold an open meeting on Sunday.
The meeting, which was marked
by tension, brought more than 100
students together with Montoya,
Wais, and representatives of the
Computer Security Office and Stan
ford Police in a conference room at
Tresidder Union.
Murillo called the University's
promises for diversity discussions
stemming from the incident "hypo
critical."
"Students here at the University
need to get a diverse array of per
spectives. In order to do this we need
diverse faculty, but the University
continues to deny tenure to people of
color," she said.
Many students also expressed
anger that Casper was not present at
the meeting to listen to their con
cerns, even though Assistant to the
President Jacqueline Wender was
present.
"The University should foster a
sense of commitment and must de
vote more attention to diversity, and
there needs to be a frank and open
dialogue— I would like for Casper

to have a personal dialogue with the
students to address these concerns,"
said freshman Rita Rico.
Montoya said he would commu
nicate student concerns to Casper.
"I will be conferring with Presi
dent Casper as a direct result of this
meeting ... because we know that we
will want to make certain that there
are opportunities for students to dis
cuss their concerns," he said.
Some students also said they be
lieved that this incident has the po
tential to affect race relations on
campus. "Something like this has the
potential to increase racial tension on
this campus. A lot of times people
forget how deep this problem really
is," Sanders said.
Wais acknowledged this possibili
ty, saying that administration will try
to alleviate the tension by keeping in
touch with students. However he said
that the timing of the incident com
plicates the situation.
"I'm kind of looking at this prag
matically in terms of the timing.
There's only so much we're going to
do since it is Memorial Weekend and
so close to finals," he said.
Montoya admitted that the meet
ing forced the administration to real
ize the problem of race relations on
campus may be greater than previ
ously imagined.
"We need to create opportunities
for students, faculty and staff to dis
cuss these issues The message
that we take home from the meeting
is that there is still so much work to be
done toward helping students of
color feel like they belong here at
Stanford," he said.
This weekend's e-mail was not the
first one to stir racial tensions at Stan
ford this year. In February an anony
mous e-mail was sent to students of
Law School visiting Prof. Kendell
Thomas, who is black. It questioned
Thomas' abilities as a scholar, profes
sor and lawyer due to his race.
At that time Law School students
were angered not only by the anony
mous e-mail but also by Law School
Dean Paul Brest's response. Brest
denounced the attack on Thomas but
defended the author's First Amend
ment rights of anonymity.
