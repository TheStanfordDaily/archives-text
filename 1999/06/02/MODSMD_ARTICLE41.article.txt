# Cruising 'round the ivory tower

### Michael R. Fainelli Contributing writer 
The French cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard once
wrote, "All you need to know about American society
can be gleaned from an anthropology of its driving be
havior." There's some truth to that statement in sub
urban landscapes like Stanford. You can certainly tell
a lot about some of the University's most prominent
figures from what they drive.
One could imagine our scholarly president rolling
to work in a pristine luxury sedan, imported from Ger-

many, or perhaps a stately

Lincoln Town Car—

almost anything

sounds more plausible than the four-door 1985
Chevrolet Caprice Classic that President Gerhard
Casper actually drives.
The Caprice, complete with Stanford license plate
frames, is provided by the University for business.
Casper admits that "the boat is really awful," and when
off-duty he cruises in a Toyota.
On most days the cardinal-red Chevy is parked be
hind Memorial Church in Casper's personal spot and
radiates Stanford spirit in direct sunlight. "The color
used to be gray," says Casper. "When somebody drove
into it while it was parked behind Mem Chu I had it re
painted in the right color — red."
Often parked next to the ungainly Caprice is a jet
black Mercedes, a beast and a beauty side by side. The
sleek 19% E-320 is the property of Provost Con-

doleezza Rice.

"It is named Helmut (nickname
Moot) after the former German C'hancel-
L lor who unified Germany," says Rice, a
I world-renowned expert on Russian and
Eastern European affairs. Rice also
keeps a moribund 1985 Buick, which she
drove for 12 years before'upgrading to

the Ben/. She named it Misha
after Mikhail Gorbachev, the
former head of the Soviet

Union, who also saw his glory days
in the previous decade.

Moot, like ils owner, makes a winning impression.
Glancing into the near opaque windows, there is no
clutter. There are no crumbs, no crumpled candy wrap
pers and no cups on the seats, the floor or dashboard.
The exterior is equally impeccable and has not a single
scratch. The ultra-competent Condi has the driving
record to match. "No parking tickets in 2K years of dri
ving." she says.
Impressive, but the streak is easier to maintain
when you're provost. According to Vice Provost for
Facilities Chris Christofferson. a handful of senior
level administrators, including Rice, have a special
permit which allows them to park just about anywhere.
The K permit is also good for the sweetest spots behind
Memorial Church.
Christofferson. the same official who decided lasl
week to revoke parking privileges for freshmen arriv
ing in the year 2000, has a regular permit, but that's
good enough for getting around Stanford in his 1995

white Jeep
wagon. He says he loves going to ski resorts on the
weekends and the Jeep is ideal for the often snowy
trek. It beats the Marguerite.
Saabs are the preferred means of automotive trans
portation for James Montova. vice provost for Student
Affairs. He just bought a 1999 silver model after do
nating his 1957 red one to charity. Why such loyalty to
the Swedish auto maker? Montova explains that in
some ways. Saabs reflect his personality. "Saabs are
quirky, yet stylish and dependable." he says.
Montoya's driving record is almost as impressive as
Rice's. "Believe it or not. 1 have never been cited for
moving violations, but this year I received two $25
parking tickets," he said. An excusable aberration,
considering that Montova doesn't have same parking
privileges as the provost or the president. "1 purchase
a parking sticker like everyone else and hunt!"
