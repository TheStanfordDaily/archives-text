## Cardinal baseball sweeps Regional play at home Day named Most Outstanding Player of tournament as Card sweeps past LMU, North Carolina, Nevada 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
As Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said before last week
end's NCAA Regional, "we're a
good team, no one considers us a
great team like they did last year."
However, after the Cardinal
swept through the regional last
weekend, knocking off Loyola
Marymount 10-2, North Carolina 7-
4 and Nevada 7-4 to advance to this
weekend's Super Regional against
USC, some people might want to re
consider.
By winning seven straight games
and IM of its last 20. this year's good
team has already surpassed last sea

son's supposedly great one, which
lost twice — including once to Loy
ola Marymount — to exit the first
round early.

BASEBALL

■ Sunday: No. 3 Stanford (46-13) 7
Nevada (38-20) 4.

■ Saturday: Stanford 7. North Car
olina (41-18) 4.

■ Friday: Stanford 10, Loyola Mary
mount (33-27) 2.

In fact, while last year's team fea
tured a number of great individuals,
including certain major leaguers
Jeff Austin, Chad Hutchinson and

Jody Gerut, this Stanford squad is
almost certainly a better team.
"We haven't relied on one or two
guys to do everything." said junior
left-fielder Nick Day, named the
Most Outstanding Player in the Re
gional. "Every game it's been some
one else [who plays well]. That's re
ally made us great as a team."
Sunday's regional-clinching vic
tory against Nevada highlighted the
formula Stanford has been using in
its winning run the last two months:
solid, sometimes great pitching
from a young staff and offensive
production from throughout the
lineup.
Freshman Brian Sager took the
mound against the Wolf Pack to nail
down the regional in his first post
season start. Though he was wild at
times — he walked one batter and
hit three — the tall right-hander was
also effective.
"I knew 1 had the stuff to get
them out. it was just about establish
ing my tempo and getting into that
groove," Sager said.
In a little less than eight innings,
he allowed only four runs on four
hits. However, only two of those
runs were earned — an unusually
sloppy Stanford defense made four
errors on the day.
"Sager has pitched phenomenal
for us all year." Marquess said.
"He's come up really big for us in
some big games. I don't consider
him a freshman anymore. That was
a great pitching performance, but
that wasn't unusual."
When Sager tired in the top of
the eighth inning. Marquess turned
to another freshman, reliever Dan
Rich, with Nevada's cleanup hitter
coming to the plate.
Rich, who came into the game
with a 3.24 ERA in 14 appearances,
was not intimidated. The left-han
der struck out Don Price, who led
the Big West Conference in home
runs, RBIs and slugging percentage,
on three pitches to end the inning.

against North Carolina.
In the ninth. Rich was also tear
less. While he struggled hv falling
behind batters in the regular season,
Rich began each of the three at-bats
with a strike.
Then with the crowd standing
and clapping, he got Arona Taele to
pop up. Chris Nickerson to strike
out and Jarell Mclntyre to ground
out. end the game and send Stanford
rolling on the road to the College
World Series.
On offense. Stanford continued
its team-wide focus; each Cardinal
batter got at least one hit and six dif
ferent Stanford players scored.
Junior Craig Thompson went 3-
for-5 in the leadoff spot, junior Ed
mund Muth had two hits and two
RBls, and Day was l-for-3 with two
RBIs, but no one player truly stood
out.
That is nothing new for Stanford,
though.
"We've been playing this way all
year long." said junior first baseman
John (Jail.
The few times when the Cardinal
has not been playing so well, such as
for most of Saturday's contest with
North Carolina, the team still has
found a way to win.
For most of the game with the
Far Heels, which featured the win
ners from Friday's two first-round
contests, the teams were squared off
in a pitcher's duel — rare for college
baseball.
Stanford sophomore Justin
Wayne, who allowed three runs on
four hits, pitched a solid six innings.
However 6-foot-7 Kyle Snyder
who was rated the nation's best
pitching prospect entering the sea
son— got the better of the matchup,
allowing only one earned run in just
under eight innings.
It was the last one and one-third
innings that will haunt North Caroli

na, however.
The Tar Heels' star reliever, ju
nior Derrick DePriest, was able to
induce Stanford third baseman Josh
Hochgesang to ground out and end
the eighth inning after coming in for
Snyder.
The ninth inning was not so kind.
DePriest gave up a double to ju
nior catcher Damien Alvarado to
lead off the inning, then fell victim to
two errors from shortstop Clay
1 100 per on the same play.
Hooper misplayed Muth's
ground ball, then threw the ball
wide of first and into the Stanford
dugout, scoring Alvarado to bring
the Cardinal within one run.
Alter the 6-foot-H submarine
pitcher got the inning's second out
off junior Eric Bruntlett's ground
ball to third base, he gave up two
straight hard-hit singles to Thomp
son and junior Jeff Rizzo. Thomp
son's hit into right field scored Muth
from third to tie the game.
With men on first and second.
DePriest looked ready to dispose
of Gall — like he had done with
every other right-handed batter in
the tournament — and end the
game. He started the All-Pac-1()
team member off with two sliders
for strikes — the first in on his
hands, the other on the outside cor
ner.
Then, with two outs and two
strikes. DePriest left a pilch over the
plate and Gall pulled it down the
left-field line. The wind, which had
pushed every hard-hit ball hit to
center and right back into the field,
carried Gall's shot over the left-field
fence and the Cardinal to a surpris
ing 7-4 lead.
"He made me look silly [with the
two sliders]," said Gall, who is bat
ting .325 with 10 home runs, seven in
his last eight games. "So I knew he
was going to come back with it. He
just left it out over the plate. 1 knew
it was gone the moment I hit it."
As Gall's shot left the stadium, so

did any chance fora Carolina win.
Stanford senior Tony ( ogan. the
team's most reliable reliever, picked
up his seventh win of the year by
pitching three innings of two-hit
ball.
"We've come back a lot of times
this season and I've been in there
fora lot of them." C'ogan said. '"It's
nothing new to lis so I had a feeling
we would do it going into the
ninth."
Last year, after losing to Loyola
Marymount 6-2 in the first game of
the regional. Stanford was forced to
climb out of the loser's bracket. It
never made it out.
The Cardinal got revenge Friday
evening with a convincing 10-2 win
that sent the Lions on their way back
to Los Angeles.
Loyola started sophomore Billy
Traber. who was its ace this season,
instead of sophomore Michael
Schultz, who beat the Cardinal with
a stellar performance last year.
Traber was anything but stellar
Friday. In just under four innings, he
gave up eight runs on seven hits, five
walks and a hit batter. Three errors
by shortstop Curt Fiore did not help
anything, but Traber never helped
himself.
Setting a tone for the weekend,
Stanford's Jason Young helped
himself and the whole Cardinal
pitching staff by tossing his eighth
complete game of the year. In nine
innings. Young gave up only two
runs on six hits while striking out
seven Lion batters.
Home plate umpire Ron Ridd
was giving both pitchers a few inch
es off the inside corner of the plate,
but only Young used it to his advan
tage. busting batters with almost
unhittable inside fastbalis.
"A complete game — we'll cer
tainly take that in this day and age of
the aluminum bat." said pitching
coach Tom Dunton. "The way he
can pitch inside with those alu
minum bats is j list amazing."
