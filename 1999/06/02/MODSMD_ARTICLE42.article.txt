## Cardinal baseball sweeps Regional play at home Day named Most Outstanding Player of tournament as Card sweeps past LMU, North Carolina, Nevada 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
As Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said before last week
end's NCAA Regional, "we're a
good team, no one considers us a
great team like they did last year."
However, after the Cardinal
swept through the regional last
weekend, knocking off Loyola
Marymount 10-2, North Carolina 7-
4 and Nevada 7-4 to advance to this
weekend's Super Regional against
USC, some people might want to re
consider.
By winning seven straight games
and IM of its last 20. this year's good
team has already surpassed last sea

son's supposedly great one, which
lost twice — including once to Loy
ola Marymount — to exit the first
round early.

■ Sunday: No. 3 Stanford (46-13) 7
Nevada (38-20) 4.

olina (41-18) 4.

■ Friday: Stanford 10, Loyola Mary
mount (33-27) 2.

In fact, while last year's team fea
tured a number of great individuals,
including certain major leaguers
Jeff Austin, Chad Hutchinson and

Jody Gerut, this Stanford squad is
almost certainly a better team.
"We haven't relied on one or two
guys to do everything." said junior
left-fielder Nick Day, named the
Most Outstanding Player in the Re
gional. "Every game it's been some
one else [who plays well]. That's re
ally made us great as a team."
Sunday's regional-clinching vic
tory against Nevada highlighted the
formula Stanford has been using in
its winning run the last two months:
solid, sometimes great pitching
from a young staff and offensive
production from throughout the
lineup.
Freshman Brian Sager took the
mound against the Wolf Pack to nail
down the regional in his first post
season start. Though he was wild at
times — he walked one batter and
hit three — the tall right-hander was
also effective.
"I knew 1 had the stuff to get
them out. it was just about establish
ing my tempo and getting into that
groove," Sager said.
In a little less than eight innings,
he allowed only four runs on four
hits. However, only two of those
runs were earned — an unusually
sloppy Stanford defense made four
errors on the day.
"Sager has pitched phenomenal
for us all year." Marquess said.
"He's come up really big for us in
some big games. I don't consider
him a freshman anymore. That was
a great pitching performance, but
that wasn't unusual."
When Sager tired in the top of
the eighth inning. Marquess turned
to another freshman, reliever Dan
Rich, with Nevada's cleanup hitter
coming to the plate.
Rich, who came into the game
with a 3.24 ERA in 14 appearances,
was not intimidated. The left-han
der struck out Don Price, who led
the Big West Conference in home
runs, RBIs and slugging percentage,
on three pitches to end the inning.
