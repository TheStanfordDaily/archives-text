# Baseball turns in team effort
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
It was quite easy to get excited about Stanford's
stirring two-out. ninth-inning rally Saturday after
noon against North Carolina. The season hung in
the balance, hanging by the thread of one last out
and two more strikes.
Just a couple of more pitches from top-notch Tar
Heel relief pitcher Derrick DePriest and the Cardi
nal would be forced to regroup in an hour and play
an elimination game against Nevada — no picnic,
seeing as the last time these two teams squared off,
it turned into four-plus hours of batting practice be
fore Stanford won 16-14.
Just one more out and Stanford would have to
play a second game in bitterly cold and wind-swept
conditions that turned Sunken Diamond into Can
dlestick Park.
Then junior designated hitter Craig Thompson
lined a ball that sliced just out of the reach of out
stretched second baseman Chris LeMarsh into
right field to score junior center fielder Edmund
Muth from third base and tie the game at four
apiece.
Two batters later, junior first baseman John (iall
turned on a two-strike pitch and sent it on its wind
swept way over the left field fence as the Sunken
Diamond crowd exploded in bedlam, giddy at the
impossibility of it all, the fact that Stanford stun
ningly had a 7-4 lead. The equally giddy Cardinal
players were busy celebrating at home plate, mak
ing like a bunch of Little Leaguers and mobbing
Gall as he completed his grand tour of the bases.
"I think the magnitude of the game — being
down two runs in the ninth inning and down to our
last out to tie it and then the big three-run home run
— I think it's one of the bigger wins that we've had
since I've been at Stanford." said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess, who has
been here for 32 seasons as a play
er and coach. "As far as playing in
front of our fans, that was a real big
win for us."
Yes, it was easy to get excited
about all of this (and for North Car
olina, devastatingly difficult to re
cover from, as the team saw its sea
son end later that night against the
Wolf Pack), except for one thing:
They've been doing it all season
long.
"The only difference is all you
guys are here," Gall wryly pointed
out in the postgame news confer
ence. looking out at all the media
that had invaded Sunken Diamond

this weekend.
Indeed, this was only Stanford's
15th comeback victory. While
some marveled at how this team
pulled one out without the star
power of last year's squad, it was
simply another day at the office for
this plucky group of ballplayers.
Not to downplay the impor
tance and impressiveness of Satur
day's rally — it put them in the dri
ver's seat of this regional as the
lone undefeated team, an opportu
nity they did not relinquish as they
polished oil Nevada 7-4 Sunday af
ternoon to advance to next week
end's super regional. 1 hey also did
it against a pitcher that was one of
the top relievers in the Atlantic
C'oast Conference and had not al
lowed a hit to a right-handed batter
in five innings of work in this re

gional — until Gall's crushing
blow, of course.
Asa result,the Cardinal already
has three times as many postseason
victories as last year's team, the
one that was supposed to be des
tined for great things.
"Last year was a team of supers
tars," said junior left fielder Nick
Day, who was named the regional's
Most Outstanding Player. "We had
five or six superstars whereas this
year, we have our stars — we've got
John Gall, we've got Josh Hochge
sang, we've got Joe Borchard —
but everyone one through nine is
able to contribute more this year
than last year."
It was also their 20th victory in
the last 21 games. To say they're
peaking at the right time is like say
ing the sky is blue. They have
pulled it off without relying on any
one player or on one particular
style of play. They can coolly bend
you with the will of a Jason Young
breaking ball or plow you with a
liorchard moon shot. I feck, the No.
7 hitter in Stanford's lineup won
the regional's Most Outstanding
Player award.
A one-trick pony, the Stanford
baseball team is not.
"I think what makes this team
special is that it truly has been a
team effort," Marquess said. "It's
been Bnmtlett. it's been Riz/.0, it's
been Day, it's been Thompson,

John Salter, who hasn't played very
much, came up big at UCLA off the
bench. It's been about 12 or 13
guys. From a coaching standpoint
and from a team standpoint, it real
ly brings the team together because
it's not just a couple of guys.
"We've picked each other up all
year long and that's special. That
doesn't happen all the time. The
chemistry has to be right and the
guys have to play well and like each
other. You can have great teams
and that doesn't happen. This is a
special group."
And clearly, the Cardinal has
also picked up on the notion that it
isn't over until it's over. It has been
able to stretch all 27 of its outs to
the limit, with Saturday's game
being the latest example.
But baseball being the cruel and

fickle game that it is. this run of good
fortune could end very quickly.
Today's rally boys could become to
morrow's also-rans. North Carolina
learned that lesson the hard way Sat
urday after pulling out a 12-inning
win over Nevada Friday afternoon.
After finishing this weekend's re
gionals 3-0, however. Stanford stands
two victories away from another (ol
lege World Series appearance.
And when you've perfected the
late-inning comeback as the Cardi
nal seemingly has, there is no rea
son to think it can't pull it off. It's
certainly made for an entertaining
season of Stanford baseball.
"It's definitely turned what could
have been a good team into a great
team." Day said of the team's rally
ing power. "Hopefully, we can all
keep contributing into next week."
