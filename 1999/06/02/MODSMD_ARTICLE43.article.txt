# Baseball turns in team effort

### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
It was quite easy to get excited about Stanford's
stirring two-out. ninth-inning rally Saturday after
noon against North Carolina. The season hung in
the balance, hanging by the thread of one last out
and two more strikes.
Just a couple of more pitches from top-notch Tar
Heel relief pitcher Derrick DePriest and the Cardi
nal would be forced to regroup in an hour and play
an elimination game against Nevada — no picnic,
seeing as the last time these two teams squared off,
it turned into four-plus hours of batting practice be
fore Stanford won 16-14.
Just one more out and Stanford would have to
play a second game in bitterly cold and wind-swept
conditions that turned Sunken Diamond into Can
dlestick Park.
Then junior designated hitter Craig Thompson
lined a ball that sliced just out of the reach of out
stretched second baseman Chris LeMarsh into
right field to score junior center fielder Edmund
Muth from third base and tie the game at four
apiece.
Two batters later, junior first baseman John (iall
turned on a two-strike pitch and sent it on its wind
swept way over the left field fence as the Sunken
Diamond crowd exploded in bedlam, giddy at the
impossibility of it all, the fact that Stanford stun
ningly had a 7-4 lead. The equally giddy Cardinal
players were busy celebrating at home plate, mak
ing like a bunch of Little Leaguers and mobbing
Gall as he completed his grand tour of the bases.
"I think the magnitude of the game — being
down two runs in the ninth inning and down to our
last out to tie it and then the big three-run home run
— I think it's one of the bigger wins that we've had
since I've been at Stanford." said Stanford head
