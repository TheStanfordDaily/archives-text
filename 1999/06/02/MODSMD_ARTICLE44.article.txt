### Jake Willens Staff writer 
Senior Ryan Wolters. captain of
the men's tennis team, capped off his
collegiate career with a fitting ending

when he and freshman K.J. Hippen
steel won the NCAA Doubles
Championship Sunday in Athens,
Ga.
In a year in which Wolters and the
Cardinal had a disappointing loss in

the round of 16 to Baylor, after hav
ing won four consecutive National
Championships, Wolters did his best
to make up for it — he not only came
away with his first individual NCAA
title, he also reached the semifinals in
the singles draw before losing to the
No. 1 seed, James Blake of Harvard.

"After our tough team loss, to see
Ryan walk off those courts a winner
was a special thing," said Stanford as
sistant coach John Whitlinger. "He
and K.J. really played superb doubles
all week long and they deserved that
title. I couldn't be more happy for
both of them. Ryan deserves to walk
away from college tennis a winner."
With their title, Wolters and Hip
pensteel earned themselves a wild
card into the doubles draw of the I J.S.

Wolters and Hippensteel were
named Ail-Americans, and Wolters
was one of the three finalists for the

came up to me and congratulated me
on being All American alter our dou
bles match against UCLA. 1 was so
happy for Ryan because he definitely
deserves both of his honors. He con
ducts himself with class out on the
court. It was also great that Whit was
inducted, he's been a coach I've en
joyed working with all year long."
The road to the finals was a diffi
cult one for Wolters and Hippen
steel, as their first three matches were
against teams that had beaten them
earlier this season. In the first round,
they defeated Jeff Laski and Gavin
Santag of Illinois, 7-5, 6-7. 6-2. The
Illinois duo had beaten Wolters and
Hippensteel 6-4.6-4 in the All-Amer
ican tournament in Austin, Texas.
The Cardinal duo knew this match
was going to be tough, but it was Hip
pensteel's return and Wolters' serve
that were the key to their win.
" The first two sets were back and
forth," Wolters said. "We came out a
little slow, but on the big points K.J.
seemed to always put the return right
where we needed it.and 1 had my
best first serves. That turned out to be
our closest match of the tournament,
maybe it was good for us to toughen
us up for later rounds."

After their victory over the Illinois
team, Wolters and Hippensteel were
faced with the tournament's No. 3
seed, Jean-Noell Grinda and Ming
Lee from UCLA. The Grinda/Lee
duo had also defeated Wolters and
Hippensteel earlier in the season dur
ing dual match play. But this time the
Cardinal duo came out on fire and
did not lose serve once during their 6-
2.6-1 victory. In this match, the Car
dinal team really started to get things
rolling.
"1 think our second-round UCLA
match was the start of our run," Hip
pensteel said. "It was after this win
when we decided we were as good as
anyone left in the tournament and
our confidence level went way up.
We may have come out a little tight in
the first round, but after we beat
Grinda and Lee everything
changed."
In the quarterfinals, Wolters and
Hippensteel defeated Ed Carter and
Jeff Williams of Arizona State, 6-2,7-
5. They got off to an exceptional start,
putting them in control right away.
They were down 5-3 in the second set
before winning the final four games
and the match. It was in this second
set that they lost serve for the last
time in the entire tournament.
"Getting off to that fast start in the
Arizona State match really set a
trend for the remainder of the tour

nament," Wolters said. "When you
get ahead early, it takes a lot of pres
sure off. I had played two singles
matches earlier in the day, so it would
have been difficult to go a third set in
this match. We pulled through and
won the final four games, though."
It was in their semifinal match
against No. 1 seed Lief Meineke and
Lesslie Moodie of Boise State that
Wolters and Hippensteel played
their best tennis of the tournament.
They won the match 6-2,6-1 and had
every single aspect of their game
clicking. According to Whitlinger, it
was the best performance of doubles
all year long.
"This was a pretty match to
watch," said Whitlinger. "It was the
best overall match from start to fin
ish. I have seen the two of them play.
Everything was gelling and clicking."
Wolters and Hippensteel took
that momentum into their final
match against Nenod Toroman and
Gareth Williams of Florida. They
won the match 6-3,6-2, again not los
ing serve and returning exceptionally
well. Hippensteel was down 40-0 on
one of his service games in the first set
and Wolters was down 40-0 in the
final game of the match, but both
won five straight points to light off
the break.
"To be honest, 1 am pretty sur
prised we were able to put an entire

week of solid doubles together,"
Wolters said. "All season long we
have shown moments where we
show our potential, but those mo
ments have not been as consistent as
we would have liked. This week we fi
nally put it all together in consecutive
matches and played the kind of dou
bles we knew we were capable of."
Wolters' title was perhaps even
more impressive considering he was
in the singles side of the draw and was
often forced to play three matches a
day. In singles, Wolters had a solid
tournament before being ousted in
the semifinals by No. 1 seed James
Blake of Harvard, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1.
Wolters got off to an extremely fast
start in the first set by playing aggres
sively. According to Whitlinger, he
continued to be offensive minded in
the second and third sets, but seemed
to miss a lot of shots within inches of
the line.
"I was happy with the way 1
played in singles," Wolters said.
"Against Blake, 1 just went up
against a player who was a little bet
ter on that day. He deserved to make
it to the finals. I was disappointed, but
1 knew I had to immediately get fo
cused again mentally for the final two
rounds of doubles. 1 ended up finish
ing my college career in a positive
way. The title meant a lot to K.J. and
myself."

have shown moments where we
show our potential, but those mo
ments have not been as consistent as
we would have liked. This week we fi
nally put it all together in consecutive
matches and played the kind of dou
bles we knew we were capable of."
Wolters' title was perhaps even
more impressive considering he was
in the singles side of the draw and was
often forced to play three matches a
day. In singles, Wolters had a solid
tournament before being ousted in
the semifinals by No. 1 seed James
Blake of Harvard, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1.
Wolters got off to an extremely fast
start in the first set by playing aggres
sively. According to Whitlinger, he
continued to be offensive minded in
the second and third sets, but seemed
to miss a lot of shots within inches of
the line.
"I was happy with the way 1
played in singles," Wolters said.
"Against Blake, 1 just went up
against a player who was a little bet
ter on that day. He deserved to make
it to the finals. I was disappointed, but
1 knew I had to immediately get fo
cused again mentally for the final two
rounds of doubles. 1 ended up finish
ing my college career in a positive
way. The title meant a lot to K.J. and
myself."

Ryan Wolters overcame his individual semifinal loss to help frehs
man K.J. Hippenteel in doubles play. This is the second consecutive
year that Stanford has claimed the doubles crown.
Senior Ryan Wolters. captain of
the men's tennis team, capped off his
collegiate career with a fitting ending

when he and freshman K.J. Hippen
steel won the NCAA Doubles
Championship Sunday in Athens,
Ga.
In a year in which Wolters and the
Cardinal had a disappointing loss in

the round of 16 to Baylor, after hav
ing won four consecutive National
Championships, Wolters did his best
to make up for it — he not only came
away with his first individual NCAA
title, he also reached the semifinals in
the singles draw before losing to the
No. 1 seed, James Blake of Harvard.

"After our tough team loss, to see
Ryan walk off those courts a winner
was a special thing," said Stanford as
sistant coach John Whitlinger. "He
and K.J. really played superb doubles
all week long and they deserved that
title. I couldn't be more happy for
both of them. Ryan deserves to walk
away from college tennis a winner."
With their title, Wolters and Hip
pensteel earned themselves a wild
card into the doubles draw of the I J.S.
Open this August. In addition, both
Wolters and Hippensteel were
named Ail-Americans, and Wolters
was one of the three finalists for the
Arthur Ashe Sportsmanship Award.
Whitlinger capped off the awards
he was inducted into the college Hall
of Fame for his career as a player.
"It will be very special to be able to
plav with Wolly in the Open," Hip
pensteel said. "That will be an excit
ing atmosphere and a great experi
ence. As far as our awards, I was ac
tually really surprised when people

came up to me and congratulated me
on being All American alter our dou
bles match against UCLA. 1 was so
happy for Ryan because he definitely
deserves both of his honors. He con
ducts himself with class out on the
court. It was also great that Whit was
inducted, he's been a coach I've en
joyed working with all year long."
The road to the finals was a diffi
cult one for Wolters and Hippen
steel, as their first three matches were
against teams that had beaten them
earlier this season. In the first round,
they defeated Jeff Laski and Gavin
Santag of Illinois, 7-5, 6-7. 6-2. The
Illinois duo had beaten Wolters and
Hippensteel 6-4.6-4 in the All-Amer
ican tournament in Austin, Texas.
The Cardinal duo knew this match
was going to be tough, but it was Hip
pensteel's return and Wolters' serve
that were the key to their win.
" The first two sets were back and
forth," Wolters said. "We came out a
little slow, but on the big points K.J.
seemed to always put the return right
where we needed it.and 1 had my
best first serves. That turned out to be
our closest match of the tournament,
maybe it was good for us to toughen
us up for later rounds."

After their victory over the Illinois
team, Wolters and Hippensteel were
faced with the tournament's No. 3
seed, Jean-Noell Grinda and Ming
Lee from UCLA. The Grinda/Lee
duo had also defeated Wolters and
Hippensteel earlier in the season dur
ing dual match play. But this time the
Cardinal duo came out on fire and
did not lose serve once during their 6-
2.6-1 victory. In this match, the Car
dinal team really started to get things
rolling.
"1 think our second-round UCLA
match was the start of our run," Hip
pensteel said. "It was after this win
when we decided we were as good as
anyone left in the tournament and
our confidence level went way up.
We may have come out a little tight in
the first round, but after we beat
Grinda and Lee everything
changed."
In the quarterfinals, Wolters and
Hippensteel defeated Ed Carter and
Jeff Williams of Arizona State, 6-2,7-
5. They got off to an exceptional start,
putting them in control right away.
They were down 5-3 in the second set
before winning the final four games
and the match. It was in this second
set that they lost serve for the last
time in the entire tournament.
"Getting off to that fast start in the
Arizona State match really set a
trend for the remainder of the tour

nament," Wolters said. "When you
get ahead early, it takes a lot of pres
sure off. I had played two singles
matches earlier in the day, so it would
have been difficult to go a third set in
this match. We pulled through and
won the final four games, though."
It was in their semifinal match
against No. 1 seed Lief Meineke and
Lesslie Moodie of Boise State that
Wolters and Hippensteel played
their best tennis of the tournament.
They won the match 6-2,6-1 and had
every single aspect of their game
clicking. According to Whitlinger, it
was the best performance of doubles
all year long.
"This was a pretty match to
watch," said Whitlinger. "It was the
best overall match from start to fin
ish. I have seen the two of them play.
Everything was gelling and clicking."
Wolters and Hippensteel took
that momentum into their final
match against Nenod Toroman and
Gareth Williams of Florida. They
won the match 6-3,6-2, again not los
ing serve and returning exceptionally
well. Hippensteel was down 40-0 on
one of his service games in the first set
and Wolters was down 40-0 in the
final game of the match, but both
won five straight points to light off
the break.
"To be honest, 1 am pretty sur
prised we were able to put an entire

week of solid doubles together,"
Wolters said. "All season long we
have shown moments where we
show our potential, but those mo
ments have not been as consistent as
we would have liked. This week we fi
nally put it all together in consecutive
matches and played the kind of dou
bles we knew we were capable of."
Wolters' title was perhaps even
more impressive considering he was
in the singles side of the draw and was
often forced to play three matches a

tournament before being ousted in
the semifinals by No. 1 seed James

sively. According to Whitlinger, he
