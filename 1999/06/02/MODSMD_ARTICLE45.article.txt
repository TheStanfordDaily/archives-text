weekend, defeating Carleton in the finals for the sec
ond straight year. The 17-9 victory capped another
stellar year of play for the team and concluded a 7-0
weekend at the Jockey Ultimate Player's Association
College Nationals in Boulder. C 010.
"We peaked at just the right time." said senior captain
Mary I hint Martin. "We played the best that we have all
season."
The top-seeded Stanford squad began the tournament
by rolling through its pool in the first round of competi
tion. handily defeating Kansas. Georgia, UC-San Diego,
Illinois and Swarthmore.
In the live games, each played to 15 points, Stan
ford allowed their opponents only 16 total points.
After a precise 15-2 victory over seventh-seeded
Brown in the semifinals, the team faced third-seeded
Carleton in the finals, in a rematch of last year's cham
pionship game. With last year's 19-1K last-second vic
tory in their mind, and with Carleton's legendary fan
base on hand to cheer. Stanford could have been ex
cused a twinge of nervousness before the final.
I hat nervousness was to prove unfounded, though, as
Stanford's 12 returning starters led the squad to a decisive
triumph.
