at Boise State.

of representing Stanford Track and
Field at the national level. With last
year's surprise second-place finish
looming fresh in the minds of the
Cardinal competitors, Stanford is
poised to make another run at a top
level performance.
Stanford returns two reigning na
tional champions to the meet. Ju
nior Toby Stevenson shocked the
prognosticators last year with his
victory in the pole vault at IS feet. 2
1/2 inches, while Brad Hauser led a
one-two-three sweep of the 10,000
meters at 28 minutes, 31.30 seconds.
Such a sweep has only been dupli
cated twice before at the NCAAs.
Joining those two will be seniors
Jason Balkman and Nathan Nutter
and junior Brent Hauser, who will
all double in the S,(HX)- and 1(),(XK)-
meter races. Brent Hauser and Nut
ter were second and third, respec
tively, in last year's 10k sweep.
Senior Adam Connolly will
throw the hammer and freshman
Michael Ponikvar will compete in
the high jump. Senior Jake Maas

will race the 1.5(H) meters.
Stanford head coach Vin 1 anan
na said he has not focused much on
the team's potential score at the
NCAA meet this season. But even

Michael Stember. he still thinks

grab points.
"What we've decided to do is
prepare each of the competing guys
to perform at their highest level and
we'll see what the points come out to
be," Lananna said.
"1 hope we can be a top-five
team."
Stanford's best hopes for big
points come in the S,(KX) and K).(HH),
where Nutter and the Hausers com
bined to score 28 of the Cardinal's
51 total points last year.
Though Brad Hauser will not de
fend his K).(HH) meter title. Lananna
hopes to place all three of his 10.0(H)-
meter runners in the top five and put
another three runners in the scoring
in the 5.0(H). 1 lis runners have loftier
goals.
"I think Brad, Brent. Jason and I
all have the goal of winning a race."
said Nutter, a team captain. "The
races — especially the K).(HH)
could go any which way. but at least
one of us has a good shot to win."
The pole vault is an area where
Stanford could propel itself to a su

vaulter entering the meet, he has
