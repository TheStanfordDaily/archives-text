MEN'S TRACK

■ Tomorrow-Saturday: Athletes
compete in NCAA Championships
at Boise State.

of representing Stanford Track and
Field at the national level. With last
year's surprise second-place finish
looming fresh in the minds of the
Cardinal competitors, Stanford is
poised to make another run at a top
level performance.
Stanford returns two reigning na
tional champions to the meet. Ju
nior Toby Stevenson shocked the
prognosticators last year with his
victory in the pole vault at IS feet. 2
1/2 inches, while Brad Hauser led a
one-two-three sweep of the 10,000
meters at 28 minutes, 31.30 seconds.
Such a sweep has only been dupli
cated twice before at the NCAAs.
Joining those two will be seniors
Jason Balkman and Nathan Nutter
and junior Brent Hauser, who will
all double in the S,(HX)- and 1(),(XK)-
meter races. Brent Hauser and Nut
ter were second and third, respec
tively, in last year's 10k sweep.
Senior Adam Connolly will
throw the hammer and freshman
Michael Ponikvar will compete in
the high jump. Senior Jake Maas

will race the 1.5(H) meters.
Stanford head coach Vin 1 anan
na said he has not focused much on
the team's potential score at the
NCAA meet this season. But even
after redshirting sophomores Jo
nathon Riley (the nation's leading
American collegian ;it 5 .(HK) meters)
and Gabe Jennings (second place at
last year's NCAA 1.5(H) meters), as
well as junior All-American
Michael Stember. he still thinks
each competing athlete is ready to
grab points.
"What we've decided to do is
prepare each of the competing guys
to perform at their highest level and
we'll see what the points come out to
be," Lananna said.
"1 hope we can be a top-five
team."
Stanford's best hopes for big
points come in the S,(KX) and K).(HH),
where Nutter and the Hausers com
bined to score 28 of the Cardinal's
51 total points last year.
Though Brad Hauser will not de
fend his K).(HH) meter title. Lananna
hopes to place all three of his 10.0(H)-
meter runners in the top five and put
another three runners in the scoring
in the 5.0(H). 1 lis runners have loftier
goals.
"I think Brad, Brent. Jason and I
all have the goal of winning a race."
said Nutter, a team captain. "The
races — especially the K).(HH)
could go any which way. but at least
one of us has a good shot to win."
The pole vault is an area where
Stanford could propel itself to a su
perior team performance. Though
Stevenson is not the top-ranked
vaulter entering the meet, he has
come through in the clutch numer
ous times for the Cardinal, as last
year's victory indicates.
"Toby goes in as the defending
champion, hut he's certainly not the
favorite," said Lananna. "Toby's ap
proach is always to only worry about
what he can do and then just see
what everyone else does. He'll put a
good mark on the board, and we'll
just have to see what happens from
there."
Depending on the weather,
Stevenson will likely have to at least
match last year's IK-2 1/2 mark from
last year's meet to contend for the
title.

Another wild card lor Stanford
comes in the form of freshman
Ponikvar. Injured for much of the
year, he was one of the last high
jumpers allowed into the meet. Nev
ertheless, his season-best mark ot
2.21 meters (seven feet, three inch
es) places him just one centimeter
out of the top eight competitors.
Ponikvar thinks it will take a per
sonal best effort to score in the meet.
"It's hard to set a goal height-wise
because you never know what the
conditions will be like,' Ponikvar,
the Pacific 10 Conference champion
in the event, said. "My goal is to have
the best jumping day of my life."
Connolly, the third-ranked
thrower in the hammer field and the
top-ranked American collegian, will
trv to bounce back from the sickness

that led to his second-place finish at
Pac-lOs.
Having thrown a personal best
236-6 earlier in the season, Connolly
is having the strongest and most con
sistent throwing year of his life and
looks to continue that trend in Boise.
"All of our field event athletes
have their best performances at the
end of the season," Lananna said.
"Adam's got more in there than
what he's thrown thus far. If he stays
cool and concentrates on what he
can do instead of worrying about the
other guys, he will do quite well."
"We need to treat this as a regular
meet but with a little more intensi
ty," said Nutter.
"But as with any meet, it will all
come down to how we each feel on
that day."
