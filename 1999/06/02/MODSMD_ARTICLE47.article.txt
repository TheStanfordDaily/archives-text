able to win."

out her junior career would be far
less humble.
Hut while Irvin is a confident per
son both on and off the tennis court,
she always keeps her ego in check.
"Marissa's got a good head on her
shoulders," said senior teammate
Marisa MacLennan. "She's very
humble. She'll never go over the top
with her tennis."
Irvin, who grew up in Santa Mon
ica with her parents and younger
brother, didn't pick up a tennis rack
et for the first time until she was nine.
She didn't begin to approach the
sport seriously until a few months
later.
No one else in her family played
tennis, although Irvin's father was a
three-time Ail-American volleyball
player at UCLA.
"I just always loved the outdoors
and sports," she said. "I'd always
prefer to be outside doing some ac
tivity like a soccer game in the street
than inside drawing or something."
Irvin immediately displayed a
knack for the game, precociously es
tablishing a national reputation by
the time she was 11. She was a top
ranked junior throughout high
school, concluding her senior cam
paign by capturing both the Califor
nia Interscholastic Federation sin
gles championship and the nation's

top ranking in the 18-and-unders.
Irvin attended the competitive
private high school Harvard-West
lake. She managed to travel to na
tional and international tourna
ments while maintaining high
grades, hut the complicated time
management process of athletics
didn't make her life easy.
"The school was supportive," she
said, "but I didn't get any special ex
tensions or special treatment. Most
of the other top juniors were practic
ing four hours a day; 1 just practiced
one or two."
Although she was often away
winning national tournaments, Irvin
made an effort to have a relatively
conventional high school experi
ence.
"I tried to keep my tennis life and
school life completely separate," she
said. "My best friend didn't even see
me hit until our senior year, when
she came early to pick me up to go to
the beach and I was still practicing.
They didn't know and they didn't re
ally care to know."
Irvin is glad she didn't sequester
herself at an elite tennis facility, for
she relished her high school years
and her Santa Monica home.
"I love the beach," she said. "We
went to the beach as often as possi
ble."
During her first three years at
Harvard-Westlake, the coach didn't
allow her to play for the team be
cause her travel schedule conflicted

with the team's practice schedule. Fi
nally, Irvin was able to play her se
nior year, leading the squad through
an impressive season.
"I 'm so glad that I was able to play
on my high school team my last
year," Irvin said. "That's one thing 1
missed about other sports — the
team aspect."
Irvin was one of six juniors select
ed to the United States Tennis Asso
ciation National Team in 1997, a
prestigious honor. That year, along
with doubles partner Alexandra
Stevenson, Irvin garnered the U.S.
Open Junior Doubles Champi
onship in front of a supportive
crowd.
"Winning [the team champi
onship! in Gainesville and the U.S.
Open Junior Doubles were probably
the best moments in tennis I've had
so far." she said.
Although most of her teammates
on the national squad now play pro
fessionally. including Stevenson and
Aubrie Rippner, Irvin chose to play
college tennis for the Cardinal.
"I was sort of vacillating between
UCLA and Stanford," she said, "but
at Stanford, there's such a strong
academic reputation and the tradi
tion of tennis is unmatched. When I
came to campus, I felt at home. I only
thought about going professional for
a little while because everyone
around me was doing it. For me, col
lege tennis was a natural progres
sion."

Irvin made an impressive debut
onto the college tennis scene,captur
ing the National Collegiate Tennis
Championships, the Rolex Indoors
and the Pacific-10 Conference Indi
vidual Championships, finishing the
season ranked second in the nation.
Having accomplished so much
her first year. Irvin has been encour
aged by some to take the profession
al route. While she hasn't squelched
the option, she certainly hasn't en
dorsed it yet.
"I'm going to play some pro tour
naments this summer as an ama
teur," she said. "We'll see what hap
pens. My goal is to play the U.S.
Open. I love Stanford. The tennis
team is really close and I have made
some unbelievable friends."
One of the elements of Stanford
life that Irvin appreciates is her par
ticipation in both Cornerstone and
Athletes in Action.
"I've always been religious." she
said. "It's really exciting meeting
other students who share my be
liefs."
Irvin. however, keeps her religious
beliefs to herself. Unlike ATP profes
sional Michael Chang, Irvin doesn't
think that God cares whether or not
she wins a tennis match.
"God never takes sides; he's not a
Cardinal or a Bear," she said. "I
don't want to be preachy. My faith
just keeps me grounded. It puts
things in perspective. Tennis is not
the most important thing."

than inside drawing or something."
Irvin immediately displayed a
knack for the game, precociously es
tablishing a national reputation by
the time she was 11. She was a top
ranked junior throughout high
school, concluding her senior cam
paign by capturing both the Califor
nia Interscholastic Federation sin
gles championship and the nation's

top ranking in the 18-and-unders.
Irvin attended the competitive
private high school Harvard-West
lake. She managed to travel to na
tional and international tourna
ments while maintaining high
grades, hut the complicated time
management process of athletics
didn't make her life easy.
"The school was supportive," she
said, "but I didn't get any special ex
tensions or special treatment. Most
of the other top juniors were practic
ing four hours a day; 1 just practiced
one or two."
Although she was often away
winning national tournaments, Irvin
made an effort to have a relatively
conventional high school experi
ence.
"I tried to keep my tennis life and
school life completely separate," she
said. "My best friend didn't even see
me hit until our senior year, when
she came early to pick me up to go to
the beach and I was still practicing.
They didn't know and they didn't re
ally care to know."
Irvin is glad she didn't sequester
herself at an elite tennis facility, for
she relished her high school years
and her Santa Monica home.
"I love the beach," she said. "We
went to the beach as often as possi
ble."
During her first three years at
Harvard-Westlake, the coach didn't
allow her to play for the team be
cause her travel schedule conflicted

with the team's practice schedule. Fi
nally, Irvin was able to play her se
nior year, leading the squad through
an impressive season.
"I 'm so glad that I was able to play
on my high school team my last
year," Irvin said. "That's one thing 1
missed about other sports — the
team aspect."
Irvin was one of six juniors select
ed to the United States Tennis Asso
ciation National Team in 1997, a
prestigious honor. That year, along
with doubles partner Alexandra
Stevenson, Irvin garnered the U.S.
Open Junior Doubles Champi
onship in front of a supportive
crowd.
"Winning [the team champi
onship! in Gainesville and the U.S.
Open Junior Doubles were probably
the best moments in tennis I've had
so far." she said.
Although most of her teammates
on the national squad now play pro
fessionally. including Stevenson and
Aubrie Rippner, Irvin chose to play
college tennis for the Cardinal.
"I was sort of vacillating between
UCLA and Stanford," she said, "but
at Stanford, there's such a strong
academic reputation and the tradi
tion of tennis is unmatched. When I
came to campus, I felt at home. I only
thought about going professional for
a little while because everyone
around me was doing it. For me, col
lege tennis was a natural progres
sion."

Irvin made an impressive debut
onto the college tennis scene,captur
ing the National Collegiate Tennis
Championships, the Rolex Indoors
and the Pacific-10 Conference Indi
vidual Championships, finishing the
season ranked second in the nation.
Having accomplished so much
her first year. Irvin has been encour
aged by some to take the profession
al route. While she hasn't squelched
the option, she certainly hasn't en
dorsed it yet.
"I'm going to play some pro tour
naments this summer as an ama
teur," she said. "We'll see what hap
pens. My goal is to play the U.S.
Open. I love Stanford. The tennis
team is really close and I have made
some unbelievable friends."
One of the elements of Stanford
life that Irvin appreciates is her par
ticipation in both Cornerstone and
Athletes in Action.
"I've always been religious." she
said. "It's really exciting meeting
other students who share my be
liefs."
Irvin. however, keeps her religious
beliefs to herself. Unlike ATP profes
sional Michael Chang, Irvin doesn't
think that God cares whether or not
she wins a tennis match.
"God never takes sides; he's not a
Cardinal or a Bear," she said. "I
don't want to be preachy. My faith
just keeps me grounded. It puts
things in perspective. Tennis is not
the most important thing."
