Unforgiving is the sports world.
While the women of Stanford's
track and field team have worked
hard all year to earn a trip to the out
door national championships held
today through Saturday in Boise,
Idaho, points will only be awarded to
those who place in the top eight.

WOMEN'S TRACK

■ Tomorrow-Saturday: Athletes
compete in NCAA Championships
at Boise State.

The Cardinal women are well
aware of that. Each of the seven ath
letes who qualified look tocontribute
points to try to better the team's ninth
place finish at last year's meet.
No athlete from the Stanford con

tmgency is putting more pressure on
herself to help the cause than senior
heptathlete Tracye Lawyer. Fresh off
her third-straight Pacific 10 Confer
ence championship, Lawyer has one
goal left to fulfill in her illustrious
Stanford career — a national title.
"The number one reason I'm
going is to win the meet. If it happens
that I do go over my [personal
record], that would he great,"
Lawyer said.
That personal record of 5,K()9
points is definitely in danger of being
broken. Yet to reach the 6,(X)0-point
mark, a goal Lawyer has set, she will
have to be clicking on all cylinders.
"I think that she was on track for
breaking6,(XJC) points at the Pac-lOs,"
said Stanford head track and field
coach Vin Lananna. "With a greater
level of competition and with a gun to
her head, which it will be at the

NC "A As, I 'm hoping that she'll have a
big first day like she did at the Pac
l()s."
Big points also may arise from the
3,(XX). an event that Stanford aluma
Monal C'hokshi won last year. In this
year's race, redshirt sophomore Sally
Cilynn and sophomore Julia Stamps
will toe the line with big hopes.
Cilynn, who qualified in the 1,5(K)
and S,(XX) meters as well hut chose to
stick with the 3.IXX). looks to cap a
breakthrough year kick-started with
a fifth-place finish at cross country
NCAAs. Her seed time of 9:18.4 is
just four seconds off the best time in
the nation.
While Cilynn has had a good out
door season from start to finish.
Stamps struggled early. Time and
time again she tried to hit the auto
matic standard in the 3,(MX) meters to
qualify for NC AAs but fell apart at
the end of races. At the Pac-lOs two
weekends ago. she finally put it to
gether. earning second-place finishes
in both the 3.(XX) and S,(XX) with
strategically sound races.
"I think that Julia has, in the last
weeks, really turned her season
around." said Lananna. "It is one
thing to not have a great season and
sit around feeling sorry for yourself
and another thing to do something
about it."
With a tight field in tonight's
3.(XX), it is unlikely that any of the
women will look to take an early lead.
The strategic nature of the race may
favor Stamps, the 19th seed. She
showed at Pac-lOs that she has the pa
tience and the kick to win without
leading from start to finish.
Of all of the Stanford athle.tes. no
one has more championship experi
ence than Mary Cobb. The eight
time Ail-American redshirted last
outdoor season, but in 1997, she was
the runner-up in the S,(XX) meters in a
personal best 16:04.53.
Her climb back to the national
level since that performance has not
been easy. Early in the season it
looked as if she would not earn a trip
to Boise. Yet. Cobb bounced back.
After a couple of tune-ups running
relay legs, Cobb stepped up to the
