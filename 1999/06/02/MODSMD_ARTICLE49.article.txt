# Super Regional last hurdle to Omaha for Stanford
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Sadly, fora conference which has
more College World Series titles
than any other and which features
the IWK NCAA champion and run
ner-up, the Pacific 10 Conference
will have only one representative in
Omaha next week.
The NCAA baseball committee
made sure of that when it placed the
storied conference's two best
chances to make it to the series,
Stanford and I JSC. in the same
bracket.
However, by placing the two con
ference rivals together, the commit
tee also made sure it would have at
least one great matchup in this year's
Super Kegionals, the eight, best two
of-three matchups between the 16
teams left in the NCAA tourna
ment.
Alter two series this season, two

of the most honored teams in college
baseball are tied 3-3. Stanford took
two of three in a noncon fere nee se
ries at Dedeaux Field in February,
and the Trojans enacted revenge by
winning two in a crucial Pac-10 series
at Stanford in April.

BASEBALL

■ Friday: Super Regional: Game 1
Stanford (46-13) vs. USC (36-24). 7
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.

■ Saturday: Game 2 — Stanford vs
I JSC I p.m. at Sunken I diamond.

■ Sunday: Game 3 (if necessary)
Stanford vs. USC I p.m., at Sunken
Diamond.

Hut after this weekend, when the
Cardinal and Trojans lock up in a
three-game series at Sunken Dia
mond. one of these will be off to
()maha for the ('ollege World Series

with a year's bragging rights in hand.
The other will be headed home for
the summer.
"The tough thing about it that the
NCAA made it so the best two teams
from the Pac-1() both can't go to
C )maha," said junior left-fielder Nick
Day. "As far as the matchup goes, we
know they're a good team and they
can swing the bat. and they know
we're a good team. It'll be exciting,
but I think we'll come out on top."
With fans certain to pack the
stands to see the Cardinal play as
they did last weekend, this do-or-die
three-game set promises to be one of
the more memorable Stanford series
ever.
"This will be an outstanding
weekend for college baseball." said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We were elated by the fan
support we received here at region
al, and we're eager to do it again this
weekend."
Certainly, though, the C 'ardinal is
not eager to face the Trojans' ace,
Barry Zito. But, as usual, Zito is
scheduled to start Friday against
Jason Young.
Zito, who was undefeated in the
Pac-1() and has won 10 straight
starts, is 12-2 with a 3.44 ERA. The
junior left-hander averages 13.2
strikeouts per nine innings.
In the team's series-opening 10-1
win in April, Zito lived up to his rep
utation. The 1999 Pac-10 Pitcher of
the Year gave up seven hits in seven
innings but struck out nine batters
and allowed only one run.
Young, who was supposed to give
Zito a run for his money, did not
have his best stuff. He was pulled in
the fifth after giving up six runs on
five hits, including two home runs.
He also made sure his name will be a
Trojan rallying cry after throwing at
a USC batter following each homer.
Young, however, is rolling into
this game. After throwing a strong
seven-strikeout complete game Fri
day. the sophomore is now second
on Stanford's single-season strike
out list, only live behind Kyle Peter

son's 1997 record.
Though the two teams are even
after six games. US( never brought
out its most dangerous weapon: ju
nior catcher Erie Munson.
Munson. Baseball America's pre
season player of the year, was out for
much of the season with a broken
hand. Munson. projected to be
picked near the top of this week's
Major League Draft, is back and as
good as ever.
In USC's 12-7 win over Pepper
dine Sunday, he was 3 for 5 with a
home run. two RBIs and four runs
scored. In the Trojans four games
over the weekend. Munson was X
l'or-16 with four RBIs.
The Cardinal, too. has a number
of hitters entering the weekend on a
high.
Junior Nick Day. named the
Stanford regional's Most Outstand
ing Player, went 4 for 11 with six
RBIs in the Cardinal's three games,
and junior Craig Thompson, also
named to the All- Tournament team,
was 5 for 12. Junior Edmund Mutli
hit 4 for 10 and sophomore Joe Bor
chard was 4 for 11 with four runs
scored.
Stanford might need senior Josh
Hochgesang to step up his offense,
however. The third baseman had
only one hit over the weekend.
Regardless of who is hot and who
is not. the history between these two
teams bodes well fora hard-fought,
competitive series. Some of the best
college baseball games in history
have been between the C 'ardinal and
the Trojans, and this year has fea
tured a few stellar contests itself.
The only problem is that the next
great Stanford-USC game will not
be in Omaha. The teams will not
have the chance to face each other in
Rosenblatt Stadium with an NCAA
title on the line.
Instead. Stanford and DSC will
face each other this weekend in a
Super Regional at Sunken Diamond
with only the winner receiving an
invitation to the College World Se
ries.

Junior Nick Day was named Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA
Regional at Sunken Diamond. Day was 4 for 11 with six RBIs over the
course of the weekend Regional play.
