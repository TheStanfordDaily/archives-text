# Cowell challenged by complex care
## 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
This year's Gaieties joking cap
tured a common campus perception:
sick students, according to Cowell
Student Health Services, can only be
suffering from mononucleosis or a
pregnancy.
But many students say Cowell's
medical care is no laughing matter.
Student experiences at the health
center suggest that Cowell can make
simple diagnoses, hut it does not ef
fectively address serious medical
concerns that fall outside the range
of typical complaints.
Challenged by unusual problems
Some students say that Cowell is
either unable to assess the severity
of their injuries or unwilling to take
their illnesses seriously.
"1 have a lot of stomach prob
lems, but every time I complained of
nausea or stomach pains they gave
nie a pregnancy test," said a junior

who preferred not to be identified.
"I told them that wasn't a possibility,
but they said. "We've had a number
of immaculate conceptions/"
The same student also went to
Cowell after a bout of food poison
ing during the California strawberry
bacteria scare. Cowell staffers told
her to go home and rest, but her res
idence assistant was forced to take
her to the emergency room in the
middle of the night. She ended up
spending four days at the Medical
Center.
Other students echoed the senti
ment that Cowell staffers were un
helpful when presented with unusu
al injuries or illnesses.
Biren Kamdar, a sophomore,
sought treatment at Cowell fora
deep gash in his shin. "My leg was
gushing blood. The nurse practition
er bandaged it up. but as far as diag
nosis he didn't know what he was
doing."
A doctor did see Kamdar. but the
doctor did not give him a timetable
for recovery, urge him to seek fur
ther treatment or even advise him on
whether or not he should use crutch
es.
"Mv uncle, who is a doctor, was
actually really, really concerned,"
Kamdar said. "Shin wounds are
more serious. Because there is less
flesh there... they heal more slowly.
II the Cowell people knew how seri
ous [my injury) was, il would have
changed my approach to it." Kam
dar. a local resident, eventually had
x-rays taken outside of Cowell.
Many students have questioned
the ability of same day care to pro
vide adequate medical services for
such serious ailments.
Unfortunately, as the anony
mous junior pointed out, "When
you're really sick, and you don't
have time to make an appointment,
that's where you have to go."
Students happy with the basics
Students with less urgent or more
easily diagnosed concerns are fre
quently much happier with ( owell's

service.
Nalini Calamur, a sophomore,
went to the same-day clinic after
scraping her face on the pavement
after a rollerblading fall. " The nurse
was really good. She definitely
helped calm me down and told me
how to take care of it."
When Kamdar went to the same
day clinic after breaking his arm, he
was quickly cared for by a doctor.
"She obviously knew what she was
talking about," he said.
The anonymous junior noted that
whenever she had made an appoint
ment for minor problems she had al
ways received good care.
Nurse pract hurts' role examined
Not all students are pleased with
the role of nurse practitioners at
Cowell. but Ira Friedman, Cowell's
director, argued that these nurses
are more than capable of providing
quality care.
I he ('owell stall is comprised of
live doctors, four nurse practition
ers. four physicians assistants and
two nursing assistants.
Nurse practitioners and physi
cian's assistants have more training
than registered nurses and are re
quired to undergo a standard ac

creditation process. At Cowell both
are equipped to serve primary care
needs.
Friedman suggested that any stu
dents' distrust of nurse practitioners
was unfounded. "The nurse practi
tioners at Cowell ... practice in de
fined areas of expertise. They are re
ally able to do most of the tasks of
primary care and have particular
skills and interest in some areas that
are very important to students."
Friedman further asserted that
nurse practitioners, contrary to
some students' impressions, are
more than willing to make outside
referrals.
"[Nurse practitioners] routinely
consult with their colleagues,
whether that's physicians or other
nurse practitioners, and refer stu
dents with more complicated prob
lems to primary care physicians here
or specialists here or at the Medical
Center," Friedman explained.
"They are very good at knowing
their own limits and helping the pa
tient get the diagnosis and informa
tion that he or she needs."
The use of nurse practitioners or
physician's assistants in staffing stu
dent health centers is a fairly stan
dard practice among universities.

Duke University's Student
Health Center employs roughly the
same number of doctors, nurse prac
titioners and physician's assistants as
Cowell.
Cowell works wifh Medical Center
Some students question how well
Cowell uses resources at the Medical
Center.
Judging from the way in which
Cowell handled his shin injury,
Kamdar said the nurse practitioner
or doctor who attended him did not
"have the awareness to realize what
constitutes a serious injury and the
humility to refer patients to more
knowledgeable doctors at the hospi
tal."
Stanford, like other universities
such as Yale, Duke and Brown, has
the advantage of a medical school
and teaching hospital on campus.
Stanford student access to many
of the advantages of a hospital, such
as appointments with specialists, are
available only through Cardinal
Care or the approval of a student's
insurance company.
"'A lot of people's logic about
Cowell being bad is that we're next
to one of the best hospitals in the
world," Kamdar commented.
Bui Friedman countered that
Cowell enjoys a close relationship
with the hospital.
"I'd say we have a very dynamic
and active collaboration with the
Medical Center," Friedman said.
"Students are routinely referred to
and from Cowell and the Emer
gency Room."
Friedman also pointed out that
the Medical Center and Cowell
share medical staff.
Staff physicians at Cowell are em
ployed by the Medical Center and
are members of the clinical faculty.
Their credentials to practice are

monitored by a committee at the
Medical Center, and they are held to
the same standards in that regard as
faculty physicians.
How Cardinal Care stacks up
Student health insurance at Stan
ford offers benefits comparable to
those offered by Yale and Duke.
All of these universities required
a general health fee and allowed stu
dents to purchase insurance through
the university, in plans similar to
Cardinal Care, to complement rou
tine coverage.
Cardinal Care. Stanford's com
prehensive health insurance plan, is
geared to students, all of whom are
required to have health insurance.
Cardinal Care's coverage is similar
to that provided by typical insurance

companies or health maintenance
organizations. A full year of Cardi
nal Care coverage costs $784.
In contrast Yale's health fee was
$684 per calendar year, while
Duke's was $586.
Although Stanford's plan seems
more expensive. Cardinal Care is
comparable to the insurance pro
grams that Duke and Yale students
can purchase after paying their
health fees.
The coverage obtained from
health fees for Yale and Duke stu
dents is slightly more extensive than
that available to registered Stanford
students through Cowell, but cover
age for emergency room care and
hospitalization is not provided. Such
coverage is available through Duke's
student insurance plan, which costs
$778 per calendar year, over and

above the required health fee.
No 24-hour care at Stanford
One service that Stanford, unlike
Yale. Duke and Brown, does not
offer is a 24-hout care facility.
Such a facility did exist at Stan
ford in the past but was the victim til'
budget cuts due to underutilization.
At Yale. Duke and Brown, none
of the 24-hour infirmaries provide
the services of hospitalization. All
accommodate less than 23 students
and are monitored b\ nurses.
Friedman said that these univer
sities were unusual. "Almost ail uni
versities have closed their overnight
infirmaries, and few il any have
longer hours of service for drop in
care than we do. Because we are a
residential university, we have con
tinued to stress havine late hours."
