( rueial wins over UCLA. California, Washington and
\ri/ona Slate put the Cardinal in a position to clinch
the title at home when they faced Arizona Feh. 27. The
l 'S K * victory over the perennial conference contender
\oivised the demons of last year's home and road
drubbings b\ the Wildcats and vaulted the Cardinal
into the N( 'AA Tournament for the fifth straight year.
Stanford controlled the game from the opening sec
onds. setting its preferred half-court tempo over the
running st\le ol senior Jason ferry and the Wildcats,
lunioi forward Mark Madsen dominated underneath
.is the ( ardinal defense stilled the opposing offense.
\S the closing seconds ncared. the crowd sensed the
unpeiuling \ictory. When the final horn sounded, the
Stanfoul faithful poured onto the court to celebrate
t ln-11 champions. With the spring-mounted hardwood
it Maples l'a\ ilion bouncing under hundreds ol jubilant
leet. Stiinlord head coach Mike Montgomery, celebrat
ing Ins >2iul birthday, made the final cut to bring down
the netsloi the Pac lOchampions.

4 ln tho longest national championship water polo match
in historv. ilie Stanford women lost the title in a heart
breaking 7 (> match against I'SC. I he I rojans won the
match aiul their lust ever national title on a skip shot 1:39
into the tilth overtime period.
Sianlonl sophomore I lilarv Gallogly seored with just

nine seeoiuls left in regulation to send the game into overtime. Senior goalie
I leathei ( rarv then seored with 59 seconds left in the second overtime on a
length of the pool shot, her second career score as a goalie, to send the match
into sudden death.
Stan lord's defense, stingy all year behind (Vary, survived 7 minutes, 39 sec
onds ol sudden death plav before letting up the game winner to I 'S( "s ( hris
tine Zador.
I he match was close throughout, with no team ever leading by more than
one goal.
( Vary, who had 11 saves and a goal in the championship, and sophomore
Kiis kohlik were named to the all-tournament second team. Freshman
Margi I )ingcldcin and sophomore Kelly Shouey were named to the third
team.
5 Although both the men's and women's swimming teams came into their
respective season's as defending champions and swam their seasons as de
fending championships, when it came down to it. they both fell short. Men's
and women's NC 'A As in Indianapolis and Athens. (ia. respectively — held
triumphs and heartbreaking defeat for both teams. The men took second to
the Auburn Tigers; the women also fell just short of first to top-ranked Geor
gia.
I he men had a scare at the Pacific 10 Championships, where cross-bay
rival California threatened Stanford's 17-year win streak, but the men pre
vailed in the end. clinching the title in the last relay and extending the longest
victory streak in any sport in Pac-10 history.
I he Stanford women recorded their 13th Pac-10 title in the 13-year histo
ry ol the meet, beating out I'SC by 355.5 points. Two Cardinal relays and
three individuals all set Pac-10 records.
The highlight of the men's NCAA Championships was senior co-captain
l)od Wales' 100-yard butterfly title. Wales not only won the event, but also
broke Olympian Pablo Morales' American record in 45.98 seconds. Senior
l ate Blahnik captured the 200 backstroke crown for the second year in a row.
I he women look their 11 th consecutive top-two finish at Nationals. Stan
lord s ( atherine fox and its 200 medley relay team broke American records.
6 A season of missed chances, lowered expectations, and rebuilding team
depth at every level might not seem to lend itself to many great year-end
moments.
Hut try ;is we might, we just can't deny the thrill of beating Cal.
I he 101st Big Game proved a redemption on many levels for the belea
guered ('ardinal. I he 10-3 victory allowed the defense, shaky throughout the
season, to shine, especially in its pass rush — the team racked up nine sacks
in the game. The offensive baekfield, devastated by injury, mustered sparks
and key plays galore despite its inexperience. And of course, the victory ren
dered the (lolden Bears one win shy of eligibility for the postseason.
As mam have pointed out. this fourth-straight Big Game victory means
an entire Stanford class will graduate this year never having known the
shame of defeat at the hands of Cal. Tod I iusak's 7-yard touchdown pass to
I rov Walters with 10 minutes, 2<S seconds remaining in the third quarter re
versed a three-point Golden Bear lead, and the suddenly-iron Cardinal de
fense made the points count.
A jubilant Stanford crowd flooded Memorial Stadium as the final seconds
ticked avvav. despite a heavy security presence on the field and flying clods of
turf tossed by Cal fans. An overreaction to a victory that, after all. boosted
the team to only 3-8? Perhaps. But for that Saturday, the Cardinal team
caught sight of glory and showed the potential for great things to come.

2liveryone knew this year's men's soceer team was something special, but
no one would have imagined the kind of season it produced.
A squad heavy on defense rolled to an impressive but by no means dom
inating 14-4-2 regular-season record before being named host fora first
round game against San Jose State.
What unfurled was a triple-overtime free-for-all, and the Cardinal
walked away with its first-ever N( AA tournament victory.
After victories over San Diego, second-seeded Virginia and Maryland,
Stanford was headed fora showdown with Indiana. The Hoosiers dominat
ed the match and took home the trophy with a 3-1 win. but Stanford soccer
had made more than just a dent in the national picture.
C 'onsider it a warning.

3 Stanford women's tennis head coach Frank Bren
nan knew that he had a talented squad. With four
freshman on the line-up — Marissa Irvin. Lauren
Kalvaria, Gabriela Lastra and Keiko Tokuda — the
team was destined for NCAA glory. But the team did
not expect to attain its l()th NCAA title in this "devel
oping" year.
At the NCAA Championships in Gainesville, Fla.,
Stanford charged through its opening rounds before
facing the top-ranked Florida Gators in the final.
Irvin. the IT As Rookie of the Year as well as the
Pac-1() Player of the Year, opened up championship
play with a straight set win over Stephanie Nickitas.
Stanford fell behind 2-1 after losses by Stanford captain
Teryn Ashley and Gabriela Lastra.
The Stanford players battled — they swept all the
remaining matches to win 5-2. Alter winning the first
set, Tokuda lound herself down 5-2 in the second set to
Jessica Lehnhoff. She came back after a rain delay to
pull out a 7-6 second set victory. Although Stanford's
Jennifer Heiser faced three match points, she, too,
fought hard fora win. The Cardinal's Lauren Kalvaria
posted her 17th straight singles win to bring the score to
4-2. Irvin and Tokuda's teamed up for an 8-5 doubles
win and clinched the team championship.
Irvin came back the following week to finish as the
runner-up in the individual competition.

7 Stanford's national athletic domination extends much
farther than its varsity programs, and the women's
rugby team's first-ever Division I national title put a tri
umphant exclamation point on that fact. After claiming the
Division II title in 1998, the team capped its first Division 1
season with a 43-31 overtime victory over Princeton in the

championship game.
The team's playoff run. which came altera l()-game winning streak to end
the regular season, included one of the program's defining wins, a hotly con
tended last-second triumph over Air Force in the national quarterfinals.
In the Sweet Sixteen at Colorado Springs, the team faced Westchester in
half a foot of snow, an unexpected challenge in the late April weather. After
a 32-5 win. the team went on to challenge Air Force, a win which energi/ed the
team on its way to the Final Four at Penn State.
The semifinal game, a 34-20 victory over Marquette, proved a challenge to
the Cardinal, hut Princeton took the team down to the wire. The Tigers had
won two national championships in the last four years. The Cardinal, though,
proved too strong in the extra period and sealed the victory.
BNovember8 November 22,1998 — a great day to be a Stanford basketball fan. With al
most no time on the clock, senior Regan Freuen stepped to the foul line in
front of a star-struck Stanford crowd with the Cardinal lied with the No. 1 Pur
due Boilermakers. With a couple of warm-up bounces and Freuen hurled the
dreams of a whole school at an orange hoop. As the ball broke through the
nylon net, the crowd roared in elation.
After an 0-3 start, it seemed the Cardinal was in fora long game against
heavily-favored Purdue. Stanford had faced three top 25 ranked teams and
were not able to overcome the inexperience of new starters and a new team
dynamic. The veteran play of their opponents had proved too much for the
young Cardinal squad and the experience of Purdue seemed insurmountable.
Led by freshman Lindsey Yamasaki's 18 points, though, the Cardinal were
able to hang with the Boilermakers. In the closing seconds, Freuen demon
strated the leadership that helped make her final season her best — and Stan
ford had shocked the women's basketball world.
9 They lost seven players to the baseball draft. The pitching staff was pep
pered with freshman and sophomores. While it was not supposed to ex
actly be a rebuilding year, they certainly were not expected to match last year's
record of 42-14-1.
Someone forgot to tell the team it wasn't supposed to be that good.
Instead, they went 46-13, won the Pacific 10 Conference title by two games
over defending national champion USC, and are two victories away from the
College World Series. While veterans like senior third baseman Josh Hochge
sang and junior first baseman John Gall have done the job with the bats, it has
been the pitching staff that has been the most pleasant surprise.
There may have been more talented teams, but most of them can't boast a
winning percentage of .779 — which doesn't even do this year's team justice.
1 the Stanford swimming program has proven over the years
1. v/that it has speed, power and explosiveness. But with the synchronized
swimming team's second straight national title this year. Stanford can add
grace, control, and precision to that laundry list of Cardinal qualities.
The team's second national title came with a second straight victory over
perennial powerhouse Ohio State, this one 92-91. Senior Vanessa Shaw, a
four-time Ail-American, proved her leadership abilities by claiming the solo
championship and. with Lindsey Wigginton. taking second place in the duet
competition. Shaw received the Individual High Point Trophy for the tourna
ment.
The national crown was less an individual triumph than a team victory,
however. Stanford won its first-ever team event title with a 98.217 to Ohio
State's %.2(X). All seven members of the team were named All-Americans.
