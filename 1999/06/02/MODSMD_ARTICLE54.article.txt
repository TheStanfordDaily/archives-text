## REAL REELS Stanford documentary film screening 
### George Kaplan 
her thesis film, Stanford graduate student
Sarah Harbin defied a U.S. ban prohibiting
Americans from traveling to Cuba. Harbin cir
cumvented more than a travel ban. She survived the loss of
her cash and passport during a robbery and the malfunc
tion of her new microphone. Getting equipment repaired
in Fidel Castro's country is no easy task, considering that
the U.S. has had an embargo against exporting goods and
services there for 40 years.
Harbin's film, "Sonata for the Left Hand," is one of 11
thesis documentaries by second-year graduate students in
Stanford's documentary film and video program that will
screen June 12 in Cubberley Auditorium
"Sonata" follows American Ben Treuhaft as he leads a
brigade of piano tuners to Cuba to refurbish old Soviet and
U.S. pianos. The instruments are in a constant state of dis
repair, thanks to the island's tropical humidity and the
embargo. Before Treuhaft, a broken string on a piano
meant a bad note forever.
Treuhaft, a self-described "piano tuner with a Red
streak," is irreverent

and engaging as he
does whatever it
takes to help
Cuba's gifted musi
cians make beauti
ful music.
The 11 short
films represent the
culmination of a
school year's work
for the documen
tary program's sec
ond-year students.
While small com
pared to such
heavyweight Hol
lywood-oriented
programs as UCLA
and USC, Stanford
weighs in big at
awards time. Only
students at New
York University
have garnered
more student acad
emy awards in the
past 14 years.
Harbin isn't the

only documentary
student to have faced

difficult conditions abroad for their thesis film. Jessica
Woodworth lived for weeks in Mongolia, with tempera
tures dipping to -40 degrees, for "Urga Song," her lyrical
film about artists in a rapidly-changing Mongolia.
Closer to home, Vanessa Warheit's "Constructing
Experience: The Many Lives of Treasure Island," takes a
reflective, sometimes ironic look at one of the world's
largest artificial islands, located right here in San Francisco
Bay.

After the Stanford
screening, Warheit
hopes to get the film
broadcast on local TV
stations, but she also
thinks the piece will
have appeal outside
the area. "Treasure
Island's history
speaks to a lot of
other issues besides
those that pertain to
the Bay Area," she said.
"Like demilitarization

and the role of artifacts in remembering places."
Edward Engel explores the nature of eccentricity and its
applicability to himself in his piece, tentatively titled "A
Different Drummer."

"Eccentricity is some
thing we can't really
define," said Engel.
"But, like pornography,
we think we know it
when we see it. But do
we?"
In the film, Engel
visits three Bay area
iconoclasts, including a
motivational speaker

who dubs himself "Positive

Paul" and a tour guide who is the founder of a Martin Van
Buren fan club, dedicated to perhaps the most obscure of
the U.S. presidents.
Other films include "Caves of the Mind," about manic
depression, "We are the Bears," about high school cheer
leading, "Slender Exis-tence," about anorexia nervosa,
"Shift-ing Traditions," about

intermarriage within the
American Jewish commu
nity, "A Cloak of Protection
for the Earth," about a
Berkeley artist's dream of
covering the earth in prayer
shawls, "Excluded from
Grace," about the inner
conflict of three Southern
Californians who have
