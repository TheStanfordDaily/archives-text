xT\ hat happens when three people are trapped on a remote Alaskan
island? This is the fulcrum of director John Sayles' latest film,
"Limbo."
The story begins when lounge singer and single parent Donna De Angelo
(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) moves with her daughter Noelle (Vanessa
Martinez) to start a new life in Alaska. There, she falls in love with fisherman Joe
Gastineau (David Strathairn). Joe has been in emotional limbo for 25 years, strug
gling to find meaning in life after a traumatic accident at sea.
The tensions among the trio are inspected microscopically when they become
stranded in the Alaskan wilderness. Limbo — emotional and physical —
becomes the focus of the movie as their fates unfold. The performances race
across emotional states and drive the momentum of the film. Noelle in particular
becomes lifelike when she is reduced to tears on-camera.
"Limbo" has the feel of a French film because of its character exploration and

slower pace. (Not surprisingly, it was recently selected for competition at this
year's Cannes Film Festival.) Although murder, drugs and death do make appear
ances in the film, they are overshadowed by internal struggles.
Be warned that the movie fails to produce a concrete ending. You will leave the
theater yearning fora tangible conclusion. Unfortunately, "Limbo" ends so
abruptly that it actually leaves the audience in limbo — waiting fora clue or sig
nal that it is time to leave the theater.
While its finale is not fully satisfactory, "Limbo" presents its characters so real
istically that we can examine them for ourselves, long after the credits have rolled.
How we see their struggles, and ultimately how we see the ending, is up to us.
