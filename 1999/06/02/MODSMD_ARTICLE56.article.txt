# DIRECTOR JOHN SAYLES
## An Intermission encounter 
### 
t's hard to believe that the writer of the
112 C/j cult film "Piranha" was also awarded a
Genius Grant by the Mac Arthur
Foundation. But John Sayles is a man of many tal
ents.
He's staying at the Pan Pacific Hotel to promote
his latest movie, "Limbo," and we're running late
(not because of me). I'm wondering how our talk
will go since I know that he's probably going to be
jet-lagged. Sayles flew in from France two days
before, where his film was screened at the Cannes
Film Festival.
On the day of our interview, he's already done six
hours of interviews after flying up from LA in the
morning. Before I even introduce myself, he reaches
out to shake my hand. I'm surprised that he seems
totally relaxed. I almost mistake him for the actor
who played the fisherman in his latest movie
"Limbo."
I a*k him if he's tired from having been on the go
for so long. "Have I?" he asks. He's being serious. "It
only feels like I've done a half-day's work."
Born in upstate New York in 1950, Sayles didn't
initially set out for Hollywood, but fora psychology
degree at Williams College. After graduation, he
worked as an orderly and a meatpacker to support
his writing career. (He thinks he took one literature
course in college, but he's not even sure of that.)
In 1975, he published his first novel, "The Pride

of the Bimbos." Since then, he's published two other
books, worked as a scriptwriter for the legendary
Roger Gorman (remember "Lady in Red"? Sayles
wrote thatl), directed many movies, including "The
Secret of Roan Inish," as well as three music videos
for Bruce Springsteen. He was also nominated for
an Oscar for Best Screenplay in 1996 for "Lone
Star," but lost to the Coen brother's "Fargo."
Given his success, it's hard to believe that an
interview with Sayles might feel down-home and
without pretense. Then again, this is exactly what
one might say about a John Sayles movie.
His passion for films comes from an interest in
people: talking with them, studying them, writing
about them. He got the idea for his latest movie,
"Limbo," from a conversation with a fisherman in
Alaska. The movie explores the emotions of two
people who fall in love after a series of personal dis
asters. Sayles explains his curiosity for them in this
way: "I started thinking about risk itself and how
people fail. After they risk and fail, what are their
reactions?" He explains that while some people
might plunge into another relationship, others
might be more guarded. This dichotomy was the
starting point for "Limbo."
Later, as an example of diverging reactions, he
recalls a conversation with a woman in Guatemala
whose children had died at a very early age. Her

reaction was very different than that of an American
mother, Sayles explained. She didn't seem to wonder
"why me," but recognized death as a part of the
world she inhabited.
Sayles carries his introspective nature into his
work and often leaves some plot elements deliber
ately vague. "Limbo" is no exception. When asked
about the nebulous ending of his movie, Sayles
reveals precious little. Instead he refers to the last
scene of the movie "The Graduate."
"If you're an optimist," Sayles said, "and you love
the characters, you say, they'll be fine ... these people
come together despite their baggage, facing a very
uncertain future..." In this same way, he believes
that audiences will interpret the ending of "Limbo"
according to their own view of the characters, and
that the clues to guide them are there in the film.
"For me a lot of this movie is about getting out
of those limbos in life: you want to quit your job,
but you have to feed your kids... What I want to say
is that in life, to get out of those limbos, you have to
take a chance." It's up to the audience to discern
what chances certain characters will or will not take.
As far as Sayles' own future is concerned, he is
taking a break from movies to focus on his writing.
As we wind down our interview, one tiling is clear:
limbo is not something that Sayles personally expe
riences. He seems to glide from one endeavor to
another — writing to screenwriting to directing — :
effortlessly.
