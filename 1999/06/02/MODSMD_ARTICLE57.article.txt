Craig Bierko (" Til There Was You"), as dean-guy Douglas Hall, simply doesn't command as strong a screen presence as
Harrison Ford or Samuel L. Jackson. Douglas is a corporate cyberfiend who has helped mastermind virtual reality technology
that transports people back to 1937 Los Angeles. We see this world quite often and what a world — the streets are filled with

old Model-Ts, the cab drivers say "thank you" and lindy-hop dancing (of course, there must be the obligatory swing
scene) is the latest fad.

Douglas' co-worker, Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl, "Shine"), is murdered outside a bar, and
the bartender confronts Douglas by claiming that Douglas killed Hannon. What could Douglas stand to
gain? Well, for one, three days before his death, Hannon altered his will to leave the company entirely to
Douglas.

This is where things get convoluted. I'd try to simplify them for you now, but (a) I don't want to pro
vide too many spoilers and (b) the complexities are too forced and unnecessary in the first place. A mys
terious woman named Jane (the lovely Gretchen Mol from Rounders ) appears and is revealed to be
Hannon's daughter. Douglas starts to take a liking to the girl; the feeling may be mutual. Detective Larry
Mcßain (Dennis Haysbert) initiates his investigation as the audience representative — essentially, he acts

I as an indicator of how difficult this puzzle is to solve from the outside looking in.
J Vincent D'Onofrio (the man / alien in "Men in Black") delivers a sinister treat as Ashton, who hails from
the virtual reality world of 1937 Los Angeles. Ashton interacts with both Hannon and Douglas, providing
a foil to their naive approaches to life.

Director Josef Rusnak, teaming with co-producer Roland Emmerich ("Godzilla," "ID4" and "Stargate"),
' has turned Daniel Galouye's novel "Simulacron 3" into a disorganized mess. Despite its engaging theories,
"The Thirteenth Floor" borrows too heavily from past films in its genre. The consistently gloomy present day
is reminiscent of the far superior "Dark City," while the traveling between worlds assumes a form reminiscent

of the TV show "Sliders."
The subject of virtual reality in films deserves a much-needed rest. It almost makes me think that, much
like with aliens, someone is trying to ready us for the real truth on the matter of reality. "The Thirteenth Moor
tries to quench our ever-rising thirst for technology-laden special effects but instead it only serves as an
I unwanted dessert to a five-course meal at Bcppo's.
