# SUB-PAR ASS KICKING
## 'Black Mask' is weak stuff 
### 
**S*77i * s an interesting movie indeed. It sounds pretty cool as
you're walking into it, thinking to yourself, wow, Jet Li finally has
his first starring role in a U.S.-released movie, and he gets to wear
a superhero costume and kick people's asses. Alas, screenwriters Gordon Chan Ka-
Seung and John Chan Kin-Chung decided to throw in a plot, and all is ruined.
Li is part of a group of government-trained killers who undergo a special

surgery that enables them to feel no pain. When the men in charge of this
operation decide to terminate it, a few members of the group, including Li,
manage to escape. While the escapees secretly plot revenge, Li changes his
name and vows never to return to his past life of violence and crime.
Masquerading as a librarian, he forms a friendship with a policeman
named Rock, and the two soon join forces to help fight Li's former part
ners, who are going on a killing spree to eliminate drug lords. They plan to
steal government files as incentive for the higher authorities to give them

the antidote for their poisoned bodies. Apparently, as we discover in the middle of
the movie, Li and his former associates ail have poisoned bodies that will die with
in a year without this mysterious antidote.
Quite a predicament. But Li, not being one to fuck around, decides to don a
cardboard black mask and hat, knowing that mere humans would be no match for
these nerveless hitmen. One would think that the Black Mask, with all of his
resourcefulness, could construct a better costume. He doesn't. Even more annoy
ing is the fact that he is caught between two women\ — his former lover who is
now one of the bad guys and one of his fellow librarians, whom he takes prisoner

at first but eventually lets tag along, complete with backwards baseball cap and
shades. The final showdown between the Black Mask and his former commander
has many a martial arts battle leading up to it, and once it's all over, you're left
wondering how the worst storyline of all time made it into this film.
Li, however, is a badass. Watching him in any Hong Kong movie (no, not
"Lethal Weapon 4," that's weak stuff too) will demonstrate this to you in full kung
fu effect. The action sequences are the only reason to see this movie, but

even they are weak: action director Yuen Wo-Ping has choreographed way
too many of the action scenes in mid-air. Watch the Black Mask jump up,
kick some guys, jump off of a wall, fly like Superman into another guy,
remain in midair and do a flip, then land on someone's face.
Admittedly, these scenes were a hell of a lot better than watching the Black
Mask disarm a bomb with a pager or throw metal razors into the throats
of assailants wearing rollerblades, but still You desperately want to see

Li live up to his full ass-kicking potential, but this movie won't let him.
In conclusion, if you're gonna see this movie, I suggest seeing it loaded. That
way, you might not pay too much attention to the plot. Otherwise, stay home and
rent "Hard Boiled" or "The Street Fighter." Let Chow Yun Fat show you how to get
it done with guns. Let Sonny Cheeba show you how to get it done with fists. This
is the true stuff of action flicks. Or better yet, go watch "Star Wars." What kind of
psycho goes to a movie theater now and doesn't watch "The Phantom Menace"?
