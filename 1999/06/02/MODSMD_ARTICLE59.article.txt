# SHOCK WITHOUT BITE
## 'Dry Cleaning' needs a wash

/yyyr ry Cleaning" ("Nettoyage a sec") is a crazy movie that explores possibly every less
[(//J than-normal sexual situation, from incest to drag, from heterosexual adultery to
homosexual adultery, from strange advances to straight-out rape.
Stanislas Merhar is the heart of this movie as Loi'c, half of the "Queens of the Night" drag rou
tine that also includes his sister Marylin, played by Mathilde Seigner. When the Queens bring their
act to a provincial town in France, they mesmerize a straight-down-the-line, no-frills married cou-

ple, Nicole and Jean-Marie Kunstler. The couple, played by Miou-Miou (crazy movies don't need last names) and Charles
Berling, have been dry cleaning for 15 years when Loi'c turns their world upside down.
Loi'c is the best character in the film. The husband and wife, although played well, lack depth. While Loi'c is an abandoned
child trying to get people to love him, the Kunstlers are just boring people that are finally seeing potential in what they
thought was a boring world. Their entire transformation from boring small-towners into two sides of a bizarre love triangle
is surprisingly predictable. Loic, on the other hand, manages to surprise with his piercing honesty.
But saying the movie was predictable doesn't mean that you won't be shocked. Merhar, in an interview, claims that "there
was not a single moment where we tried to provoke for the gratuitous pleasure of provocation." Au contraire, mon petit
bijou. This movie was one deliberate provocation after another. Maybe gay sex scenes are the norm in European film, but
American audiences will probably be surprised by the graphic nature of Loi'c's love scene with another man. I felt the sex was
largely unnecessary: after Loic's advances, the point had already been made. Or maybe I'm just close-minded.
There was one particularly poignant scene: the Kunstlers go to Basel, following the Queens to their new gig. The married
couple makes a grand entrance with Jean-Marie in a coat and tie and Nicole in a dress, only to be confronted by jewelry, drag
and studded leather.
But this scene was the exception, not the rule. Most of "Dry Cleaning" was all shock, no substance.
