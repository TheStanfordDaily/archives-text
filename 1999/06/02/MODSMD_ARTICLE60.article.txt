## THIS WEEK'S MUSIC REVIEWS Pizzicato Five Playgirl & Playboy (Matador) 
### 
x-^T / a' izzicato Five remain something
of an enigma to Americans
whether they recognize it or not.
The latest release, "Playboy & Playgirl," pro
vides me with a new excuse to find out
about the band and compose an unneces
sary haiku:
Japanese pop stars
Is that a wig you're wearing?
Twee is hip, again.
"Have you been a fan since the beginning?"
"Yes."
"No, you haven't."
The official stateside introduction of
Pizzicato Five in 1995 by Matador Records,
"Made in U.5.A.," consisted of a collection of
songs previously released in Japan. From
this record came the remarkable and mem
orable American single, "Twiggy Twiggy."
The group dates back to the early '80s how
ever, and had numerous Top 40 hits in Japan
before trendy L.A. radio stations even had
"Twiggy Twiggy" constantly on the airwaves.
"When Sasaki Matniko and Kamomiya
Ryo resigned did it break your heart?"
"Yes."
"You don't even know who I'm talking
about."
The line-up for Pizzicato Five originally
consisted of Konishi Yauharu, Takanami
Keitaro, Kamomiya Ryo and Sasaki Mamiko
on vocals. They released their first album,

"Audrey Hepburn
Complex," in 1985 and sev
eral followed, including
"Bossa Nova 2001" pro
duced in part by (here's
where the link between known Japanese
musicians must be made) Oyamada Keigo
of Cornelius fame. In 1988, Tajima Takao
joined as vocalist and the focus has since
remained on the duo of Tajima and Konishi.
"What do you think of the music of
Pizzicato Five?"
"Their music is so aaiia..."
The music of Pizzicato Five is purpose
fully retro pop — no one should describe
them so viscerally, as if they were all instinct
and no intention. "Playgirl & Playboy" espe
cially is smoothly and precisely produced, a
mix of every popular style of music from the
'60s you can't remember along with obvious
elements of the present. Postmodernism is
here to slay. Of course, as recontextualiza
tion inevitably exposes itself, there's the risk
of sounding solely like a cheap imitation.
Pizzicato Five, however, has a distinct voice
in the (increasingly generic) genre of
Japanese '60s-style pop.
The record is thirteen songs long with
gameshow-esque announcing sometimes
interjected between tracks. The first song,
"La Depression," initially sounds like a com
mercial jingle, but upon reading the lyric
translations, you'll discover the theme is
much more serious: there's a cute-rich-fiin
boy shortage and the dreadful consequence
is — a boring world. The second track,
"Rolls Royce," breaks that light-hearted
mood by featuring the theme of shattered
illusions, accentuated by an ominous strain
of strings. But if you don't like boys or cars,
don't despair, there still may be something in
store for you on "Playboy 8c Playgirl."
"Which are your favorite new songs?"
it rp • j>
...IWi
"You can't pick 'Twiggy Twiggy"' It's not

new."
Tom Jones is groovy and all, but you may
prefer a cooler sound. Tajima Takao's clear
vocals, the pulsing bassline and soulful back
ing voice of Suzuki Momoko make "Such A
Beautiful Girl Like You" my favorite. If
you're more on the a-go-go tip, ready steady
for the title song "Playboy Playgirl." I'm not
sure that it's at all a-go-go music, but you
can dance to it (and two-thirds of the
album) like it were. And there's also an end
less supply of sentimental lyrics to satisfy
either your romantic or cynical tendencies (I
won't attempt to discern whether they are
sincere or sarcastic).
What's left to say? "Playboy & Playgirl" is
boss, (late-late-late) '90s boss. If you want
"real" '60s pop buy some old vinyl; I mean,
no one's asking you to neglect the original
inspiration of Pizzicato Five's British mod
kick. But you may as well. Hell, you'll never
know the difference. Although the makers of
"Austin Powers" have surely seen "Casino
Royale," you don't need to have the same
research power to enjoy Pizzicato Five.
That's the beauty of pop. You may not
believe it now, but trust me on the pop
thing.
