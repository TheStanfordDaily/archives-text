# Harry Connick Jr.
## Come By Me (Sony / Columbia) 
### 
the six years since Harry
( (£) Connick Jr. released his last Big
Band album, much has hap
pened to swing music. Groups like Big Bad
Voodoo Daddy and the Cherry Poppin'

Daddies have brought hard-edged swing
into the mainstream, and a postmortem
rush on Frank Sinatra albums reintroduced
a nation to the music that captivated its par-
and grandparents. Meanwhile, Connick
— the man once dubbed the savior of swing
— has been dabbling in movies, funk,
orchestral ballads and fatherhood.
Connick finally gets back to the
Big Band in "Come by Me," a collection of
classic and original charts that vaults the
crooner back to the top of the swing world.
Unlike his hard-jivin' counterparts, Connick
excels at every tempo, whether in the rollick
ing "Come by Me," a poignant take on
"Danny Boy" or the simply laid-back
"Nowhere with Love." He and his musicians
— including many of the Big Band mainstays
Connick fans will remember from past
albums - are on the top of their games, and
at 31, his ever-smooth voice has a newfound
maturity. Without a doubt, Connick is the
King of Swing once again.
