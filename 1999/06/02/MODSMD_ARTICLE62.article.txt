## LOVE LINE GETS NASTY 'The Poorman' vs. MTV 
### Colleen Bazdarich 
, ou may have gone to see Adam Carolla ami
Dr. Drew of MTV's I.oveline at Frost
<* Ampitheater a couple of weeks ago. You may
have even made up some bullshit story about weird dis
coloration on your genitalia or sleeping with your
boyfriend's mother. Hut you still missed out on talking
with the raunchy I)} who first started I.oveline back in
the early '80s. And he missed out on the money you
paid to see the show that he created.
His Loveline spew about visits to "the sushi bar"
(take a guess — ) and taking a dump made KROQ DJ
James "The Poorman" Trenton the crass idol of every
junior high loser in the Southland area circa early '90s.
We Los Angeles brats went crazy over this sick and
twisted Poorman. My friend Jen even built a shrine to
her radio in his honor. I am sure Trenton would get per
verse pleasure knowing that at 12 I used to take my
radio with me under the covers so my parents wouldn't
know I was up past bedtime listening to Poortnan's love
advice.
Trenton started Loveline in 1983 when KROQ radio
was a burgeoning station, and Dr. Drew was brought
onto the show a year later. The Poorman and Drew did
Loveline for nine years together, keeping the show alive
through a corporate buyout oj KROQ by CBS-affiliat
ed Infinity Broadcasting, which also owns the Bay
Area's Live 105. The duo brought KROQ some of its
highest ratings ever until 1993 when a feud with the
new KROQ owners over the direction of Loveline (iron
ically, Poorman envisioned the show going on to
national radio and television) and a prank he pulled on
one of the station's other DJsgot the Poorman fired. The
show has since gone on to nationally syndicated radio
and of course, M TV. Thus far the Poorman gets noth
ing of Loveline's current profits and isn't ever men
tioned as the show's creator. Claiming that he has been
royally screwed over by the bullies of big corporation
and his old friend Dr. Drew, Trenton filed suit against
MTV earlier this year for $40 million.
I got to talk to the Poorman last week over the phone
from his house in Newport Beach. He had the same
charmingly childish and crude voice I loved as a kid —
maybe just a little more bitter.
Intermission: How did Loveline come about?
The Poorman: Well I thought it up one night or
one time hack in 1983 — KROQ gave me this late
night time slot midnight to 3a.m. on Sunday night. I
said let's try this thing where people call up with love
problems and we give them advice. It was really pop
ular from the first time we tried it — eventually the
show just became Loveline. We didn't even have a
doctor for the first year. That's why I get infuriated
when I see Dr. Drew telling people that he created the
show. 1 mean he wasn't even there during the first
year.
I: So were you friends with Dr. Drew before he
came on the show?
TP: No I met him at a party — people would call
in with love problems and they'd go "Poorman, 1
have this weird ooze between my legs." I knew 1
couldn't keep saying "take an aspirin" for the rest of
my life. 1 realized that at some point you may need
some technical advice. So I met Drew at a party and
one thing led to another.
I: But now in interviews Dr. Drew never men
tions you.
TP: That's why he's such a little slimeball thief. Of
course I am never mentioned. Why mention a guy
who discovered you? 1 put that little fuck on the air
for 10 years. 1 have tremendous issues with that piece

of shit. To me, that guy giving advice to the country,
it annoys me because he is such a slimeball — that
guy is America's doctor and everybody just thinks he
is the coolest dude. It makes me angry because he is
also ripping off my property.
I: Yeah, so how did that happen? How much
longer did you and Dr. Drew do lx>veline? How did
the show do while you were a DJ?
TP: Like another nine years. It did great from the
word go. The highest ratings they ever had in L.A.
radio was my last ratings book before I was thrown
off the station — they got one ratings book where
like 27 percent of all radios on at thai hour were lis
tening to Loveline. it was phenomenal. And then I
got fired Drew said at the time that he would stand
by me because I discovered him and created the show
and introduced him to his wife. She was a KROQ
bikini girl. I was in Drew's wedding, i created the
bikini girls, I created Loveline. My brain gets him laid
and gets him money and Drew will be sure and not
mention me in any article now.
I: When did you take action about it?
TP: Well I think it was Dec. '93.1 said OK lam off
KROO but give me my show back. I don't want
Loveline aired on KROO anymore and they wouldn't
do that so I filed suit against Infinity Broadcasting.
The bottom line is give me back iny property —
nobody will do one thing. I mean I have called tons
of people over the years and said, "Do you know what
the story behind Loveline is?" They don't give a shit.
I: So you filed another suit against MTV.
TP: About three months ago in federal court. They
have made a motion to dismiss. The judge will rule
on that in three weeks.
I: What's it like to be the little guy suing these
huge corporations?
TP: It makes me feel like this country sucks basi
cally— lam not intimidated in the least but on the
other hand it has probably cost me a lot of job oppor
tunities since I haven't sucked their corporate butt
hole — here are these big bullies and what I don't like
is scumbags like Dr. Drew just fall right in line and
screw over people. If they really wanted me off the
show at least they could have bought me out of my
brilliant concept that I worked for 10 years on the air.
I did the show and created the formula. I made it
number one — these guys won't offer a penny of
income while they continue to exploit the property.
It's also kind of funny that with all their money and
with all their powers they can't think of their own
ideas. They have to rip off me — if they want they
can just get me a bunch of marijuana and I'll sit on
the beach where I live. I'll sit and smoke out and I'll
come up with other shows for them. They can hire
me as a consultant since obviously they can't think of
their own shows. Honestly I don't even know how I
am going to react if they make me a cash settlement.
My feeling is, I want to do my show again — I am
furious at these companies for stealing my show. I
don't like going around suing people but on the other
hand I don't like them ripping me off either.
Poorman now hosts a show called "World Premiere
Television" on KCRA 62 in Southern California. The
show lakes a home-grown approach to television, show
ing independent shorts and music videos from unsigned
bands. The Poorman loves Stanford students. If you
want to submit a piece to be aired, give him a call at:
(949) 722-8785. He's waiting patiently.

show has since gone on to nationally syndicated radio
and of course, M TV. Thus far the Poorman gets noth
ing of Loveline's current profits and isn't ever men
tioned as the show's creator. Claiming that he has been
royally screwed over by the bullies of big corporation
and his old friend Dr. Drew, Trenton filed suit against
MTV earlier this year for $40 million.
I got to talk to the Poorman last week over the phone
from his house in Newport Beach. He had the same
charmingly childish and crude voice I loved as a kid —
maybe just a little more bitter.
Intermission: How did Loveline come about?
The Poorman: Well I thought it up one night or
one time hack in 1983 — KROQ gave me this late
night time slot midnight to 3a.m. on Sunday night. I
said let's try this thing where people call up with love
problems and we give them advice. It was really pop
ular from the first time we tried it — eventually the
show just became Loveline. We didn't even have a
doctor for the first year. That's why I get infuriated
when I see Dr. Drew telling people that he created the
show. 1 mean he wasn't even there during the first
year.
I: So were you friends with Dr. Drew before he
came on the show?
TP: No I met him at a party — people would call
in with love problems and they'd go "Poorman, 1
have this weird ooze between my legs." I knew 1
couldn't keep saying "take an aspirin" for the rest of
my life. 1 realized that at some point you may need
some technical advice. So I met Drew at a party and
one thing led to another.
I: But now in interviews Dr. Drew never men
tions you.
TP: That's why he's such a little slimeball thief. Of
course I am never mentioned. Why mention a guy
who discovered you? 1 put that little fuck on the air
for 10 years. 1 have tremendous issues with that piece

of shit. To me, that guy giving advice to the country,
it annoys me because he is such a slimeball — that
guy is America's doctor and everybody just thinks he
is the coolest dude. It makes me angry because he is
also ripping off my property.
I: Yeah, so how did that happen? How much
longer did you and Dr. Drew do lx>veline? How did
the show do while you were a DJ?
TP: Like another nine years. It did great from the
word go. The highest ratings they ever had in L.A.
radio was my last ratings book before I was thrown
off the station — they got one ratings book where
like 27 percent of all radios on at thai hour were lis
tening to Loveline. it was phenomenal. And then I
got fired Drew said at the time that he would stand
by me because I discovered him and created the show
and introduced him to his wife. She was a KROQ
bikini girl. I was in Drew's wedding, i created the
bikini girls, I created Loveline. My brain gets him laid
and gets him money and Drew will be sure and not
mention me in any article now.
I: When did you take action about it?
TP: Well I think it was Dec. '93.1 said OK lam off
KROO but give me my show back. I don't want
Loveline aired on KROO anymore and they wouldn't
do that so I filed suit against Infinity Broadcasting.
The bottom line is give me back iny property —
nobody will do one thing. I mean I have called tons
of people over the years and said, "Do you know what
the story behind Loveline is?" They don't give a shit.
I: So you filed another suit against MTV.
TP: About three months ago in federal court. They
have made a motion to dismiss. The judge will rule
on that in three weeks.
I: What's it like to be the little guy suing these
huge corporations?
TP: It makes me feel like this country sucks basi
cally— lam not intimidated in the least but on the
other hand it has probably cost me a lot of job oppor
tunities since I haven't sucked their corporate butt
hole — here are these big bullies and what I don't like
is scumbags like Dr. Drew just fall right in line and
screw over people. If they really wanted me off the
show at least they could have bought me out of my
brilliant concept that I worked for 10 years on the air.
I did the show and created the formula. I made it
number one — these guys won't offer a penny of
income while they continue to exploit the property.
It's also kind of funny that with all their money and
with all their powers they can't think of their own
ideas. They have to rip off me — if they want they
can just get me a bunch of marijuana and I'll sit on
the beach where I live. I'll sit and smoke out and I'll
come up with other shows for them. They can hire
me as a consultant since obviously they can't think of
their own shows. Honestly I don't even know how I
am going to react if they make me a cash settlement.
My feeling is, I want to do my show again — I am
furious at these companies for stealing my show. I
don't like going around suing people but on the other
hand I don't like them ripping me off either.
Poorman now hosts a show called "World Premiere
Television" on KCRA 62 in Southern California. The
show lakes a home-grown approach to television, show
ing independent shorts and music videos from unsigned
bands. The Poorman loves Stanford students. If you
