Congratulations Graduating Seniors!
Please, keep Stanford moving toward the 50% diversion
from the landfill goal by donating clothing, food and other
reusables to charity and recycling ALL paper products,
cans and bottles during move-out.
Commonly Asked Questions
about reducing, reusing, recycling, buying recycled, and composting
Q: Local charitable organizations no longer take electronic equipment (TVs, VCRs. cellular
phones, etc.) in need of repair. Where can these be recycled?
Ai There are retail electronic shops that will repair your electronic equipment for a fee. Sometimes the cost of
repair is more than the cost of new equipment, which can generally be determined up front. Most repair businesses
have found that it is not profitable to try to repair and sell freely donated electronic equipment (with the exception
of higher value computer equipment). Call the County Recycling Hotline (1-800-533 8414) for information about
companies that do repair work In your area.
Recycling of electronic equipment however Is different from repair and reuse of the equipment. Recycling gener
ally means that the material is broken down and re-formed into the same product or a new one. Electronic equip
ment like TVs and VC.Rs have too many Intricate parts for recycling to be economical. It is labor intensive to sep
arate the multiple, and sometimes minuscule, materials types for recycling and markets are not readily available for
small quantities of some of the material types. Therefore, recycling of electronic equipment is not common at
this time.
Q: Why can't I recycle everything?
A: This is by far the most asked question. The shortest answer is that not everything has a market. Remember
that recycling is a business with the economics driven by supply and demand - just like any other business. Is there
a demand by a manufacturer for a particular material? Are they willing to pay for this material, like they would any
other type of raw material? Of course, what often drives the manufacturer's demand for a material type is the con
sumer's demand for the end product. By buying products containing recycled materials, we "close the loop". When
the loop is closed, markets are developed and recycling those materials makes more economic sense. In short,
in order for anything to be recycled, it must have a market to be sold to. Be a part of the solution. Buy Recycledl
Q: Can I recycle my plastic binder or broken
plastic cup?
A: We only accept containers that are labeled as #1 PETE or
#2 HDPE Plastic. Any unlabeled plastic container or product
cannot be recycled because we do not know what type of plas
tic it is made of. Many plastic products are made of a combi
nation of plastics which makes them inherently unrecyciable.
Also, be aware that plastic products can be made with recycled
content in them, but it doesn't mean that they are recyclable.
They must have the correct identification code on them which
is usually located on the bottom of the container.
Q: Can we can recycle books? I went to
try to sell all of mine back, but they didn't
take them all.
A: The problem with recycling books are the
bindings. Qlue and other materials in the bind
ing do not break down in the pulping process.
The paper Inside the book can either be white
paper or semi glossy paper. If you tear off the
binding or tear out the pages, you can recycle
the paper in your mixed paper bin and throw the
binding in the garbage.
