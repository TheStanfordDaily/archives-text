## Turning the worst year into the best years 
### 
I left my car in California as an
incentive to come back.
After enduring the first year of
what everyone insisted had been
the start of the-best-years-of-my
life, I trusted my car to the Wilbur
parking lot and boarded a plane
back to Ohio.
With quivering emotions press
ing heavy on my heart, 1 stared at
the lighted placard until it blinked
off, and with the freedom to un
buckle my seat belt I crumpled in
my seat with relief.
My first year at Stanford had
been the low point of my life.
To all of you reading this as you
bask in the sunshine and nostalgia
overflowing all over campus. 1 must
sound like an awfully misdirected,
dismal soul. Well, I was — then. As
I am about to tearfully graduate
from Stanford, clearly something

along the way changed all of that.
This is the story of how I learned to
love this place.
From the start, I found so many
people that I met absolutely amaz
ing. In the first weeks as we got to
know each other, I was impressed
by what 1 felt was an atmosphere of
intellectual energy mixed with a
sense of compassion and charity. I
liked it here.
Hut as the weeks wore on, I
began to fear those amazing people
for whom I had held so much re
spect. They became almost like
cold opponents.
1 flubbed my first chemistry quiz
and, confiding this to a new friend,
got questioned over the quality of
my public school education. A little
later, someone berated me for not
living up to my responsibilities as a
hedonistic college student and
made me feel guilty when he caught

me studying. And then, one after
noon over smoothies at Juice Club,
a friend told me 1 was a traitor to
my race. Not knowing what else to
do. I took this as constructive criti
cism.
That first year I was everywhere,
doing everything, desperately try
ing to find a niche and a passion. 1
took everyone's criticism and in
gested it and shaped myself by it.
I took solace in the practice
rooms at Braun, and I would hang
out there with a bunch of other
music fiends who, like me, could
only find time in their schedules to
practice after midnight. And then,
one evening riding my bike home, 1
got hit by a car. As my dear room
mate tried to console me as I lay in
the hospital, I almost wished 1
could go back to high school.
Looking back, I'm sure many of
us felt the same way I did. The rea

son why most of the hurtful ex
changes emerged between me and
my friends was because everyone
had been looking for their direc
tion, just like me. Freshman year
was in many ways like eighth grade.
Even the bravest, most confi
dent among us know it's nice to be
in a safe, familiar place where we
are each big fish in our own little
ponds. As if going home to Ohio
reset all of my confidence and
dreams, I spent the summer think
ing about what it would take to
make me happy.
In Ohio and in hindsight, I real
ized that my unhappiness came
from my desperate dependence on
everyone else. I clung to the idea
that being at Stanford made me,
me. I had fallen into a pit of utilitar
ian friendships and validations.
Maybe I wanted to meet the
challenge, maybe I missed my car

— I ended up returning in the fall. 1
returned armed with the conviction
that whatever I did from that point
on would be my own. After 1 got
back, somewhere along the way, I
re-learned this was right.
In four years, Stanford tore me
down and helped me build myself
up again. If being here has taught
me anything, it is that I — like each
one of us — am an independent and
valuable individual because 1 be
lieve I am, not because people and
posts tell me so.
We leave the protection of Stan
ford in the next few days, and we
are told that because we attended
this top university we are now qual
ified to participate in the world. Be
cause of what we know, they say,
we owe it to the world to partic
ipate.
1 hope that each of us takes what
he or she has learned from this

place and recognizes that it is not
our degrees that give value to the
contributions we can make to the
world, nor does not having a degree
like ours indicate any frailties.
What Stanford has given us is sim
ply the start of something bigger.
As we set off, I hope each of us can
remember the compassion, confi
dence, and energy that we had be
fore all this started. And I hope that
we all live by what we remember.
It's time now to cut the cord and
bust out of here. I leave grateful
and teary-eyed, because Stanford
has done its job. It let me discover
that there is much that 1 can do.

Tienlon Ho is graduating with a de
gree in political science and a minor
in biology. She wishes the best of
everything to all you guys and gals
— particularly to the one going to
Siberia.
