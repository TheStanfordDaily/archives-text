						cub reporter reflects on the trade 
### 
The Constitution guarantees the rights of only
two professions outside of government: lawyers
and journalists. Both, the country's founders
said, were essential in a democratic society to check
against tyranny.
Lofty goals for two professions at the bottom of the
barrel of American esteem, some two hundred plus
years later.
It's a sad irony I face often in these, my rookie days
of being a reporter. And my concern over it has
prompted me to talk about being a reporter — a rare
thing in this profession. I'm told.
Save for conversations with fellow reporters in
dingy bars over hard drinks — where we try to recre
ate the old. "Sweetie, Get me rewrite" days — re
porters are mostly mum when talking about them
selves.
Hut I'm supposed to work for you. the public. And
I can't do that il you don't know where I'm coming
from with a notebook in my hand and a pencil behind
my ear. I lence. to start off my career, this list of per
ceptions and misperceptions of my profession, that of

ficially speaks for one cub journalist, but one who has
a feeling he's not unlike many of his colleagues:
1. We're not in this for a Pulit/er-at-any-cost. We real
ize. more than most think, that the subjects ol our arti
cles are people with feelings and families. No one
writes an article without thinking about what will hap
pen after presstime.
2. We're scared about the future of our profession. Not
the Internet (which, like newspapers, will naturally
discriminate the good from the bad), but two frighten
ing trends: the shrinking coverage of local news and
the growing number of conglomerates that own not
just media companies, but weapons plants, paper mills
and theme parks and have strong ties to the elite in
business and government.
3. We make mistakes. We also respect newspapers that
don't bury their corrections boxes in the fine print and
readers who forgive us for making an error.

4. Like anyone, we like phone calls returned. We also
respect honesty. If you don't want to talk, tell us up
front.
5. With the exception of one sap from Kentucky, we
are loyal to our sources and we are willing to go to jail
to protect their confidentiality. We are not police
agents and we will not assist in government investiga
tions.
6. We recognize that news organizations must of
course make a profit to survive. But we're worried
that, all too often, the bottom line is being forced to be
the only line and good, hard-hitting stories are being
rejected because they might anger advertisers and
stock-holders. A journalist doesn't like straddling the
median between the editorial and the business depart
ments. We got in this profession to write.
7. We don't like hiding behind the amorphism of our
bylines. As a reader, you most certainly have the right
to criticize. But pleae also try to see where we're com

ing from when we report and listen as well as speak.
K. We don't enjoy reporting on crime, violence and
war. We do it because "all this had news" should al
ways be newsworthy. It should always be of interest to
us and no one should expect it to happen.
9. We're patriotic. We believe in the ideals that this na
tion was founded on: freedom to investigate power and
freedom to criticize. And we believe in the ideals this
nation has come to accept, like equal opportunity.
10. The overwhelming majority of us never wanted to
report on Monica Lewinsky, 112 ar too many esteemed,
talented journalists were thrust into the pack. We were
just as fed up as you.
