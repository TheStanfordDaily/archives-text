# TOP 10 moments in sports 1999
## 
### 
IFor immortality and historical impact, it was perhaps
surpassed. But as a shared moment of sheer athletic
joy, no moment this year compared to the men's bas
ketball team's first-ever Pacific 10 Conference crown.
Crucial wins over UCLA, California, Washington and
Arizona State put the Cardinal in a position to clinch
the title at home when they faced Arizona Feb. 27. The
98-83 victory over the perennial conference contender
exorcised the demons of last year's home and road
drubbings by the Wildcats and vaulted the Cardinal
into the NCAA Tournament for the fifth straight year.
Stanford controlled the game from the opening sec
onds. setting its preferred half-court tempo over the
running style of senior Jason Terry and the Wildcats.
Junior forward Mark Madsen dominated underneath
as the Cardinal defense stilled the opposing offense.
As the closing seconds neared, the crowd sensed the
impending victory. When the final horn sounded, the
Stanford faithful poured onto the court to celebrate
their champions. With the spring-mounted hardwood
at Maples Pavilion bouncing under hundreds of jubilant
feet. Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery, celebrat
ing his 52nd birthday, made the final cut to bring down
the nets for the Pac-10 champions,
4 ln the longest national championship water polo match
in history, the Stanford women lost the title in a heart
breaking 7-6 match against USC. The Trojans won the
match and their first-ever national title on a skip shot 1:39
into the fifth overtime period.
Stanford sophomore Hilary Galloglv scored with just

nine seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime. Senior goalie
I leather ( rary then scored with 59 seconds left in the second overtime on ;i
length-of-the-pool shot, her second career score as a goalie, to send the match
into sudden death.
Stanford's defense, stingy all year behind Crary, survived 7 minutes. 39 sec
onds of sudden death play before letting up the game winner to US( "s ( hris
tine Zador.
The match was close throughout, with no team ever leading by more than
one goal.
Crary. who had 11 saves and a goal in the championship, and sophomore
Kris Koblik were named to the all-tournament second team Freshman
Margie Dingeldein and sophomore Kelly Shouey were named to the third
team.
5 Although both the men's and women's swimming teams came into their
respective season's as defending champions and swam their seasons as de
fending championships. when it came down to it. they both fell short. Men's
and women's NC A As — in Indianapolis and Athens. Ga. respectively — held
triumphs and heartbreaking defeat for both teams. The men took second to
the Auburn Tigers: the women also fell just short of first to top-ranked (ieor
gia.
The men had a scare at the Pacific 10 Championships, where cross-bay
rival California threatened Stanford's 17-year win streak, but the men pre
vailed in the end, clinching the title in the last relay and extending the longest
victory streak in any sport in Pac-1() history.
The Stanford women recorded their 13th Pac-10 title in the 13-year histo
ry of the meet, beating out USC by 355.5 points. Two Cardinal relays and
three individuals all set Pac-10 records.
The highlight of the men's NCAA Championships was senior co-captain
Dod Wales' 1 (H)-yard butterfly title. Wales not only won the event, but also
broke Olympian Pablo Morales' American record in 45.98 seconds. Senior
Tate Blahnik captured the 200 backstroke crown for the second year in a row.
The women took their 11th consecutive top-two finish at Nationals. Stan
ford's Catherine Fox and its 2(X) medley relay team broke American i ecords.
6 A season of missed chances, lowered expectations, and rebuilding team
depth at every level might not seem to lend itself to many great year-end
moments.
But try as we might, we just can't deny the thrill of beating Cal.
The 101st Big Game proved a redemption on many levels for the belea
guered Cardinal. The 10-3 victory allowed the defense, shaky throughout the
season, to shine, especially in its pass rush — the team racked up nine sacks
in the game. The offensive backfield, devastated by injury, mustered sparks
and key plays galore despite its inexperience. And of course, the victory ren
dered the Golden Bears one win shy of eligibility for the postseason.
As many have pointed out. this fourth-straight Big Game victory means
an entire Stanford class will graduate this year never having known the
shame of defeat at the hands of Cal. Tod Husak's 7-yard touchdown pass to
Troy Walters with 10 minutes, 28 seconds remaining in the third quarter re
versed a three-point Golden Bear lead, and the suddenly-iron Cardinal de
fense made the points count.
A jubilant Stanford crowd Hooded Memorial Stadium as the final seconds
ticked away, despite a heavy security presence on the field and flying clods of
turf tossed by Cal fans. An overreaction to a victory that, after all, boosted
the team to only 3-8? Perhaps. But for that Saturday, the Cardinal team
caught sight of glory and showed the potential for great things to come.

2 Everyone knew this year's men's soccer team was something special, but
no one would have imagined the kind of season it produced.
A squad heavy on defense rolled to an impressive but by no means dom
inating 14-4-2 regular-season record before being named host for a first
round game against San Jose State.
What unfurled was a triple-overtime free-for-all, and the Cardinal
walked away with its first-ever NCAA tournament victory.
After victories over San Diego, second-seeded Virginia and Maryland,
Stanford was headed for a showdown with Indiana. The I loosiers dominat
ed the match and took home the trophy with a 3-1 win. but Stanford soccer
had made more than just a dent in the national picture.
Consider it a warning.

3 Stanford women's tennis head coach Frank Bren
nan knew that he had a talented squad. With four
freshman on the line-up — Marissa Irvin, Lauren
Kalvaria, Gabriela Lastra and Keiko Tokuda — the
team was destined for NCAA glory. But the team did
not expect to attain its 10th NCAA title in this "devel
oping" year.
At the NCAA Championships in Gainesville, Fla.,
Stanford charged through its opening rounds before
facing the top-ranked Florida Gators in the final.
Irvin. the ITA's Rookie of the Year as well as the
Pac-10 Player of the Year, opened up championship
play with a straight set win over Stephanie Nickitas.
Stanford fell behind 2-1 after losses by Stanford captain
Teryn Ashley and Gabriela Lastra.
The Stanford players battled — they swept all the
remaining matches to win 5-2. After winning the first
set. Tokuda found herself down 5-2 in the second set to
Jessica Lehnhoff. She came back after a rain delay to
pull out a 7-6 second set victory. Although Stanford's
Jennifer Heiser faced three match points, she, too,
fought hard for a win. The Cardinal's Lauren Kalvaria
posted her 17th straight singles win to bring the score to
4-2. Irvin and Tokuda's teamed up for an 8-5 doubles
win and clinched the team championship.
Irvin came back the following week to finish as the
runner-up in the individual competition.
7 Stanford's national athletic domination extends much
farther than its varsity programs, and the women's
rugby team's first-ever Division 1 national title put a tri
umphant exclamation point on that fact. After claiming the
Division II title in 1998, the team capped its first Division I
season with a 43-31 overtime victory over Princeton in the

championship game.
The team's playoff run, which came after a l()-game winning streak to end
the regular season, included one of the program's defining wins, a hotly con
tended last-second triumph over Air Force in the national quarterfinals.
In the Sweet Sixteen at Colorado Springs, the team faced Westchester in
half a foot of snow, an unexpected challenge in the late April weather. After
a 32-5 win, the team went on to challenge Air Force, a win which energized the
team.on its way to the Final Four at Penn State.
The semifinal game, a 34-20 victory over Marquette, proved a challenge to
the Cardinal, but Princeton took the team down to the wire. The Tigers had
won two national championships in the last four years. The Cardinal, though,
proved too strong in the extra period and sealed the victory.
BNovember8 November 22.1998 — a great day to be a Stanford basketball fan. With al
most no time on the clock, senior Regan Freuen stepped to the foul line in
front of a star-struck Stanford crowd with the Cardinal tied with the No. 1 Pur
due Boilermakers. With a couple of warm-up bounces and Freuen hurled the
dreams of a whole school at an orange hoop. As the ball broke through the
nylon net, the crowd roared in elation.
After an 0-3 start, it seemed the Cardinal was in for a long game against
heavily-favored Purdue. Stanford had faced three top 25 ranked teams and
were not able to overcome the inexperience of new starters and a new team
dynamic. The veteran play of their opponents had proved too much for the
young Cardinal squad and the experience of Purdue seemed insurmountable.
Led by freshman Lindsey Yamasaki's 18 points, though, the Cardinal were
able to hang with the Boilermakers. In the closing seconds, Freuen demon
strated the leadership that helped make her final season her best — and Stan
ford had shocked the women's basketball world.
9 They lost seven players to the baseball draft. The pitching staff was pep
pered with freshman and sophomores. While it was not supposed to ex
actly be a rebuilding year, they certainly were not expected to match last year's
record of 42-14-1.
Someone forgot to tell the team it wasn't supposed to be that good.
Instead, they went 46-13, won the Pacific 10 Conference title by two games
over defending national champion t JSC, and are two victories away from the
C ollege World Series. While veterans like senior third baseman Josh Hochge
sangand junior first baseman John Gall have done the job with the bats, it has
been the pitching staff that has been the most pleasant surprise.
There may have been more talented teams, but most of them can't boast a
winning percentage of .779— which doesn't even do this year's team justice.
1 n r ° rlain| y l ' lc S tan ' or( J swimming program has proven over the years
J vythat it has speed, power and explosiveness. But with the synchronized
swimming team's second straight national title this year. Stanford can add
grace, control, and precision to that laundry list of Cardinal qualities.
The team's second national title came with a second straight victory over
pi; ,'nnial powerhouse Ohio State, this one 92-91. Senior Vanessa Shaw, a
four-time Ail-American, proved her leadership abilities by claiming the solo
championship and, with Lindsey Wigginton, taking second place in the duet
competition. Shaw received the 1 ndividual I ligh Point Trophy for the tourna
ment.
The national crown was less an individual triumph than a team victory,
however. Stanford won its first-ever team event title with a 98.217 to Ohio
State's 96.21K). All seven members of the team were named All-Americans.
