# 10,000 sweep not enough for men
## Track second at NCAA meet 
### Ben Allen Senior staff writer 
Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna has a knack for defying
the odds. When the Cardinal track
team was predicted to finish tenth
at last year's NCAA Champi
onship meet, his squad rose to the
challenge and captured second
place, nearly stealing the victory
from top-dog Arkansas.
This year, though the prognosti
cators were kind enough to offer
Stanford a fourth-place finish at
the meet, Lananna's squad still
wasn't satisfied. Scoring 52 points
to Arkansas' 59, the Cardinal once
again made a strong run at the na
tional title during the four-day af
fair and showed the nay-savers that
Stanford should never be counted
out.
The one constant in the last two
years for Stanford has been the
amazing one-two-three sweep of
the 10,000 meter run. When Brad
Hauser. Brent Hauser and Nathan
Nutter teamed up to grab 24 points
in the NCAA l()k last year, it was
only the fourth time in NCAA his
tory that such a sweep had taken
place.
When Nutter, Jason Balk man
and Brent Hauser repeated the
feat on the first day of competition
this year, the back to back sweep
was unprecedented. No team in
history has ever asserted such
dominance in the event in two con
secutive seasons.
Allowing Arizona's Abdi Abdi
rahman to set the early pace in the
10,000, the Stanford trio worked
together to stay in the hunt for
much of the contest. Then, with
800-meters remaining. Nutter and

company blew the race wide open.
"We knew the race would go
down to the final 1000 meters,"
Nutter said. "It actually came
down to the final 800 meters, and
our strategy was to key off each
other."
Unleashing a kick that only his
teammates could bear. Nutter led
Balkman and Hauser through the
final two circuits, crossing the
stripe in 29 minutes. 11.96 seconds.
Balkman was second at 29:12.91.
while Hauser captured third in
29:14.07. The next runner was
more than 7 seconds back.
"This was definitely the high
light of my career," said Nutter.
"It's such an exciting feeling to
cross the finish line."
Balkman was equally ecstatic.
"It's exciting, almost surreal."
said Balkman. "You really don't
expect it to happen, but with all the
hard work, it did happen. I'm not
disappointed in finishing second. I
would do it again if we went 1-2-3."
The 24 points garnered by the
sweep was enough to hold Stan
ford in the lead through the first
three days of competition.
Then, on Friday, it was time for
junior I'oby Stevenson to soar.
Last year's surprise winner in the
pole vault, Stevenson was ranked
fifth entering this year's competi
tion and not a favorite to win.
As other vaulters were daunted
by high winds. Stevenson took the
fewest attempts to clear 17 feet. 10
1/2 inches, a mark posted by three
other competitors. Stevenson's
mark was then one-upped by Jacob
Davis of Texas, who missed his
only attempt at 18-2 1/2, Steven
son's last attempted height.
As the last vaulter left in the
competition, Davis then asked for
the bar to be raised one centimeter.
He cleared that height on his sec
ond try.
Stevenson s second-place finish
was good for eight points.
Later that night. Nutter. Balk
man and Brent I lauser made an en
core appearance in the 5.000 me
ters. joining Brad Hauser to see
what further havoc they could
wreak.
The group snagged another 13
points, as Brad Hauser (14:01.82) fin
ished second behind the scorching
kick of Washington State's Bernard
Lagat (14:01.09). Brent Hauser was
tilth in 14:0(5.74. Balkman's 14:11.73
was good enough for eighth and Nut
ter ran 14:23.43 for 14th.
On the tinal day of competition,
Stanford had only three athletes re
maining to compete, seniors Jake
Maas and Adam Connolly and
freshman Michael Ponikvar.
Maas. who was recently named
to the All Pac-1() Academic first

team, was impressive in his sev
enth-place showing in the 1.500-
meter run. His 3:51.56 mark con
tributed two points to the Cardinal
cause and earned him All-America
status.
Connolly, perennially Stan
ford's biggest threat in the throws,
launched the hammer 236-1 for
fourth place. Notching another 5
points toward Stanford's total,
Connolly was pleased with the ef
fort.
"The competition in the ham
mer at the NCAA's is always great
with world championship stan
dards being met or surpassed,"
Connolly said. "I would have need
ed a substantial personal-best to
move up in the standings."
Ponikvar gained valuable cham
pionship experience, clearing 7-1
3/4 to finish 13th in the high jump.
To the Cardinal's dismay, the
final day also saw an inundation of
points for Arkansas. With the finals
of their strongest events being con
tested on Saturday, the Razorbacks
manufactured 36 points to put
them in the lead for good.
Still. Stanford once again over
achieved. Sending only eight ath
letes to compete, the Cardinal

came away with nine All-America
awards, including two apiece for
Brent Mauser and Balkman.
Lananna was proud, to say the
least.
"All the athletes that competed
did a great job," Lananna said.
"Stanford performed at a high level
during the four days. The men's
team put forth a gutty, courageous
effort."
And with Balkman and both
Hausers returning for their final
track season in 2000, a third 10k
sweep and possibly even a team
championship could be in the
works. Though Stanford will lose
Nutter and Connolly to graduation,
currently red-shirting sophomores
Gabe Jennings and Jonathon Riley
and junior Michael Stember will all
be back next year to help fight for
the top spot.
But seizing the first place trophy
will take another odds-defying ef
fort from Lananna's squad. Stan
ford will have to wrestle the honor
away from Arkansas, which has
won the last eight titles and owns
more NCAA hardware than any
other squad. And the last time
Stanford won the NCAA title?
1934.

kick of Washington State's Bernard
Lagat (14:01.09). Brent Hauser was
tilth in 14:0(5.74. Balkman's 14:11.73
was good enough for eighth and Nut
ter ran 14:23.43 for 14th.
On the tinal day of competition,
Stanford had only three athletes re
maining to compete, seniors Jake
Maas and Adam Connolly and
freshman Michael Ponikvar.
Maas. who was recently named
to the All Pac-1() Academic first

team, was impressive in his sev
enth-place showing in the 1.500-
meter run. His 3:51.56 mark con
tributed two points to the Cardinal
cause and earned him All-America
status.
Connolly, perennially Stan
ford's biggest threat in the throws,
launched the hammer 236-1 for
fourth place. Notching another 5
points toward Stanford's total,
Connolly was pleased with the ef
fort.
"The competition in the ham
mer at the NCAA's is always great
with world championship stan
dards being met or surpassed,"
Connolly said. "I would have need
ed a substantial personal-best to
move up in the standings."
Ponikvar gained valuable cham
pionship experience, clearing 7-1
3/4 to finish 13th in the high jump.
To the Cardinal's dismay, the
final day also saw an inundation of
points for Arkansas. With the finals
of their strongest events being con
tested on Saturday, the Razorbacks
manufactured 36 points to put
them in the lead for good.
Still. Stanford once again over
achieved. Sending only eight ath
letes to compete, the Cardinal

came away with nine All-America
awards, including two apiece for
Brent Mauser and Balkman.
Lananna was proud, to say the
least.
"All the athletes that competed
did a great job," Lananna said.
"Stanford performed at a high level
during the four days. The men's
team put forth a gutty, courageous
effort."
And with Balkman and both
Hausers returning for their final
track season in 2000, a third 10k
sweep and possibly even a team
championship could be in the
works. Though Stanford will lose
Nutter and Connolly to graduation,
currently red-shirting sophomores
Gabe Jennings and Jonathon Riley
and junior Michael Stember will all
be back next year to help fight for
the top spot.
But seizing the first place trophy
will take another odds-defying ef
fort from Lananna's squad. Stan
ford will have to wrestle the honor
away from Arkansas, which has
won the last eight titles and owns
more NCAA hardware than any
other squad. And the last time
Stanford won the NCAA title?
1934.
