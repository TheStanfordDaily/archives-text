# 10,000 sweep not enough for men
## Track second at NCAA meet 
### Ben Allen Senior staff writer 
Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna has a knack for defying
the odds. When the Cardinal track
team was predicted to finish tenth
at last year's NCAA Champi
onship meet, his squad rose to the
challenge and captured second
place, nearly stealing the victory
from top-dog Arkansas.
This year, though the prognosti
cators were kind enough to offer
Stanford a fourth-place finish at
the meet, Lananna's squad still
wasn't satisfied. Scoring 52 points
to Arkansas' 59, the Cardinal once
again made a strong run at the na
tional title during the four-day af
fair and showed the nay-savers that
Stanford should never be counted
out.
The one constant in the last two
years for Stanford has been the
amazing one-two-three sweep of
the 10,000 meter run. When Brad
Hauser. Brent Hauser and Nathan
Nutter teamed up to grab 24 points
in the NCAA l()k last year, it was
only the fourth time in NCAA his
tory that such a sweep had taken
place.
When Nutter, Jason Balk man
and Brent Hauser repeated the
feat on the first day of competition
this year, the back to back sweep
was unprecedented. No team in
history has ever asserted such
dominance in the event in two con
secutive seasons.
Allowing Arizona's Abdi Abdi
rahman to set the early pace in the
10,000, the Stanford trio worked
together to stay in the hunt for
much of the contest. Then, with
800-meters remaining. Nutter and

company blew the race wide open.
"We knew the race would go
down to the final 1000 meters,"
Nutter said. "It actually came
down to the final 800 meters, and
our strategy was to key off each
other."
Unleashing a kick that only his
teammates could bear. Nutter led
Balkman and Hauser through the
final two circuits, crossing the
stripe in 29 minutes. 11.96 seconds.
Balkman was second at 29:12.91.
while Hauser captured third in
29:14.07. The next runner was
more than 7 seconds back.
"This was definitely the high
light of my career," said Nutter.
"It's such an exciting feeling to
cross the finish line."
Balkman was equally ecstatic.
"It's exciting, almost surreal."
said Balkman. "You really don't
expect it to happen, but with all the
hard work, it did happen. I'm not
disappointed in finishing second. I
would do it again if we went 1-2-3."
The 24 points garnered by the
sweep was enough to hold Stan
ford in the lead through the first
three days of competition.
Then, on Friday, it was time for
junior I'oby Stevenson to soar.
Last year's surprise winner in the
pole vault, Stevenson was ranked
fifth entering this year's competi
tion and not a favorite to win.
As other vaulters were daunted
by high winds. Stevenson took the
fewest attempts to clear 17 feet. 10
1/2 inches, a mark posted by three
other competitors. Stevenson's
mark was then one-upped by Jacob
Davis of Texas, who missed his
only attempt at 18-2 1/2, Steven
