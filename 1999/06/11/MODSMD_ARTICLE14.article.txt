# Baseball wins trip to Omaha

### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Out of the 323 games Stanford
and USC had played going into last
weekend, more than a few had been
memorable.
None, though, had as much riding
on them as last weekend's contests.
With a trip to the College World
Series on the line at Sunken Dia
mond. the two Pacific 10 Conference
rivals squared off for the first time in
NCAA Tournament plav in a series
that will stick in the minds of both
schools for a while.
However, by beating USC 1 -0 in a
game for the ages Friday and outlast
ing the Trojans 5-3 Saturday, Stan
ford earned the right to march on and
make new memories in Omaha. Neb.
USC, which was looking to defend
the NCAA title it won last season,
could only pack up and head for a
long summer in the Southland.
"We start in October and our goal
is to go to the World Series," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. But. "it's a long, long season.
[There are] a lot of ups and a lot of
downs. This is a real special team.
They earned the trip."
.lust barely.
While Stanford swept through the
best two-of-three series, it was not a
runaway by any means. Huoved by
exceptional pitching performances
from its top two starters, the Cardinal
did just enough to win.
Friday evening the Trojans gave
Stanford one and only one chance to
win the game. But the Cardinal took
advantage of that single opportunity
to win a classic postseason pitcher's
duel.
USC's Barry Zito, picked ninth in
the major league draft two days be
fore the game, lived up to his advance
billing. Placing his looping curve ball
and stellar change-up perfectly on the
corners, the junior left-hander was
unhittable.
Through four innings, the Pac-10

Pitcher ol the Year was perfect.
Through live innings, Stanford still
had no hits.
In the sixth, the game changed.
Leading off the inning. Stanford's
Erie Bruntlett reached on a fluke
double.
The junior shortstop hit a high but
weak popup into shallow centerfield
for what seemed to be a routine out.
USC center fielder Brad Tieehurst
never saw the ball once it got up into
the lights. As shortstop Seth David
son and second baseman Dominic
Correa raced out to help Tieehurst,
the ball fell in and Bruntlett — who
had been dutifully running out the fly
ball — coasted into second base.

Marquess, sensing this might be
Stanford's only chance to sneak a run
in. sent leadoff man Billy Jacobson to
the plate to move Bruntlett to third
base. The sophomore center fielder
did his job to perfection on the fir.i
pitch, deadening a high fastball ii.m
the dirt for a textbook sacrifice.
With one out. Zito went to work
to try to get out of the only jam he had
been in all game. He started junior
Jeff Rizzo off right, keeping him
guessing with two breaking balls.
Zito then tried to see if Rizzo would
make a mistake and chase a pitch.
"I gave him a fastball that was sup
posed to be off the plate," Zito said.
But it was Zito who made the mis

take, leaving the fastball on the outer
half of the plate.
Rizzo slapped it into the left-field
corner, scoring Bruntlett, giving
Stanford a 1-0 lead and bringing the
packed crowd to its feet.
Zito calmly set the Cardinal down
in order in the seventh and eighth in
nings, but his complete game, two
hit. eight-strikeout performance was
not enough. One pitch, the outside
fastball in the sixth, and one pitcher,
Stanford's Jason Young, did him and
the Trojans in.
Young, who gave up eight hits in
his nine innings on the mound, lived
