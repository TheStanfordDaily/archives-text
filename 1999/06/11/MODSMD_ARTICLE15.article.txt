# Women take 13th place in NCAA championship meet
## Lawyer wins heptathalon title 
### Harry Cooper Staff writer 
Trayee Lawyer strengthened her case
as one of the most dominant Stanford
athletes ever by claiming the NCAA title
in heptahlon this past Friday and Satur
day.
The victory was a fitting ending to her
career at Stanford, highlighted both by
excellence in track and field as well on the
soccer field.
The three-time Pacific 10 Conference
champion entered the competition as the
favorite and beat her nearest opponent.
Christi Smith of Akron, by a score of
5,855 to 5.773. Lawyer's tally was a career

best.
As Lawyer usually does, she got off to
a fast start on Friday with wins in both the
100-meter hurdles and 200-meter dash
(in a tie with Ellannee Richardson of
Washington State) and third place finish
es in the shot put and high jump.
"My first day events are the best."
Lawyer said.
"So 1 definitely wanted to go into the
second day having people think about
how many points ahead of the I was.and
put the pressure on them rather than
me."
Lawyer kept pouring it on Saturday
with a season best jump of 19 feet 9 1/4
inches to earn fifth place in the long jump.

With only two events to go. the javelin
and 800-meters, Lawyer had a command
ing lead on the 20 person field, but with a
sub-par performance in the javelin (109-
8), Lawyer would have to have a strong
effort in the 800.

'(Lawyer) is the backbone of our
of our women's program'
— Head coach Vin Lanana

Though she finished 16th. her time of
2:26.<57 earned her enough points for the
victory.
"It's great getting a career-best and
being able to win." Lawyer said.
Stanford head coach Vin Lananna was
proud, but not surprised, of Lawyer's
achievement.
"She is a great competitor, and is the
backbone of our women's program."
Lawyer's ten points for the victory
provided the majority of Stanford's
points.
The team's total of 17 was good for a
tie for 13th place in the nation with Lou
siana Tech. Texas won the competition
with 62 points, followed by UCLA with
60 and USC with 58.
The Cardinal's other points came in
Friday's 3,000-meter final. Redshirt
sophomore Sally Glynn and sophomore
Julia Stamps worked together to finish
fifth and sixth in times of 9 minutes, 40.06
seconds and 9:40.82. respectively.
For Glynn, the race capped a year
marked by Ail-American honors in each
of the three seasons: cross country, in
door and outdoor track. Stamps also
grabbed All-America honors, her fourth
award since she arrived on the Farm last
fall.
In the javelin, junior Allison Beatty
got her first NCAA experience with a
13th place throw 158-7. a career best.
Stanford's other athletes were Mary
Cobb, who finished 11th in the 5.000.
Summer Pierson, who finished 15th in the
discus, and Melissa Feinstein. 18th in the
pole vault.
All three athletes' performances were
well shy of their season and personal
bests.
The meet capped a great year for the
program. With a 3rd place team finish at
cross country NCAAs in the fall and
Lawyer's victory in the heptathlon, Stan
ford reaffirmed its standing among the
top in the nation.
