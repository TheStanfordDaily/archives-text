# Titans first up for Card
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Coaches always hope the postseason be
comes a familiar place for their teams. Hut for
Stanford, this NCAA tournament is getting a
little ridiculous.
In the first two rounds, the Cardinal took on
Loyola Marymount. Nevada and USC — all
teams Stanford has played multiple times in the
last few years.
As a reward for sweeping through the tour
nament with a perfect 5-0 record to advance to
the College World Series, sixth-seeded Stanford
now gets to play third-seeded Cal-State Fuller
ton Saturday evening in the first round of col
lege baseball's ultimate showcase.
Of course, the Cardinal might remember
beating the Titans in two out of the three games
the teams played at Fullerton in early February.
If not. the team might recall the series they
played last year or the year before that.
"Isn't it fun." said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess jokingly. "We go from USC to Fuller
ton."
But no Cardinal is in any mood to argue. Rid

ing the high of last weekend's sweep of the Tro
jans. the defending national champion. Stan
lord is taking a few days to enjoy its fourth trip
to Omaha this decade and eleventh trip overall.
After all. it seems everything is going Stan
ford's way — even the rankings. For the first
time since last year's talented team went into a
tailspin at the end of the season. Baseball Amer
ica rates Stanford as the No. 1 team in the coun
try.
And why not? The Cardinal is as hot as any
team left standing: it is in the midst of a nine
game winning str<!ak and has won 21 t>f its past
22 games.
For the most part. Stanford (48-13) has not
put up such a gaudy record on the strength of its
hats. Last weekend, the team swept USC be
hind only eight hits. The heart of Stanford's
order, its 3-4-5 hitters, did not even get a hit. But
the Cardinal's young arms have picked up the
slack.
Sophomore Jason Young (3.14 ERA), who
will start against Fullerton Saturday, pitched a
scoreless, 10-strikeout complete game to pick
up his 11th win of the year last Friday.
Sophomore Justin Wayne, whose
15-1 eareer record is the best in Stan
lord history, posted his ninth win of
the season Sunday by striking out 12
Trojans and allowing only two runs in
eight innings. Wayne will probably
start in Stanford's second game,
against either Florida State or Texas
A&M depending upon Saturday's
results.
Stanford's third starter, freshman

Brian Sager. will probably not get a
start in Omaha unless the Cardinal
loses. The games are spread out
enough to allow teams to use only
two starting pitchers. However.
Sager (6-0. 3.98 ERA) should be an
effective weapon out of the bullpen.
This formidable trio of starting
pitching will be put to the test this
week. Florida State (53-12), Texas
A&M (52-16) and Fullerton (49-12)
the three teams in Stanford's
bracket — will all be looking to take
advantage of Rosenblatt Stadium's
shallow fences and usually helpful
wind.

Fullerton — the Series Champion
in 1979, 1984 and 1995 — is batting
.344 as a team and scoring an average
of 9.5 runs a game, both school
records if they stand.
The Titans will also be a complete
team again. No. 1 starter Adam John
son (10-3,3.22 ERA. 133 K), reliever
Marco Hanlon (6-1, 4.11 ERA) and
starting infielders David Bacani and
Chad Olszanski have been reinstated
to the team after serving a week's
suspension for throwing rocks off a
hotel roof during the regional at
Notre Dame.
Florida State's team offense is not

famous, but the offensive explosions
of second baseman Marshall Mc-
Dougall are quite well known. Mc-
Dougall. named the Atlantic Coast
Conference's Most Valuable Player,
set NCAA records by hitting six
homers and driving in 16 runs in one
game against Maryland.
The Seminole pitching staff is
even more impressive. No. 1 starter
Nick Stocks (12-2.3.09 ERA) and the
rest of the formidable staff — which
has allowed an average of only three
runs a game — will be trying to lead
Florida State to its first College
World Series title in 16 appearances.
