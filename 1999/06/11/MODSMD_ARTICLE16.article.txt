# Titans first up for Card

Coaches always hope the postseason be
comes a familiar place for their teams. Hut for
Stanford, this NCAA tournament is getting a
little ridiculous.
In the first two rounds, the Cardinal took on
Loyola Marymount. Nevada and USC — all
teams Stanford has played multiple times in the
last few years.
As a reward for sweeping through the tour
nament with a perfect 5-0 record to advance to
the College World Series, sixth-seeded Stanford
now gets to play third-seeded Cal-State Fuller

team left standing: it is in the midst of a nine
game winning str<!ak and has won 21 t>f its past
22 games.
For the most part. Stanford (48-13) has not
put up such a gaudy record on the strength of its
hats. Last weekend, the team swept USC be
hind only eight hits. The heart of Stanford's
order, its 3-4-5 hitters, did not even get a hit. But
the Cardinal's young arms have picked up the
slack.
