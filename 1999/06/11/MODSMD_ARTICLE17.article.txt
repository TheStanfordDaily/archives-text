# Cogan gets last title shot
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
It was probably a scenario that pitcher Tony
Cogan had gone over in his mind at night.
With Stanford holding a 5-2 lead, they were
just three outs away from a College World Se
ries appearance. So. it was only lilting that they
turned to the senior left-hander to close the
door on the contest and provide an appropri
ate conclusion to his final home game.
Cogan. who had broken the school record
for career appearances two weeks earlier,
knew what he was up against. Starter Justin
Wayne had just pitched a phenomenal eight in
nings in which lie struck out 12 batters and held
the potent USC offense to two runs.
The sophomore left-hander had shown no
signs of slowing down so if Cogan let this lead
slip away. Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess would have been second-guessed all the
way to a winner-take-all third game the next
day.
Fortunately, it did not come to that. Cogan
would not allow it. Not now. not at this point in
his career. He got out of the inning allowing
only one inconsequential run and bidding the
Sunken Diamond fans a fond farewell indeed
"1 have lots of faith in our relief guys."
Wayne said. "Congratulations to Tony. Com
ing into a big spot like that was huge."
Cogan was only a sophomore the last time

Stanford stormed into the CWS, and there he
received a baptism bv fire. His first Series ap
pearance came against eventual national
champion LSIJ, a high-powered offensive ma
chine that showed no mercy to opposing pitch
ers. Already down 7-2. Cogan was in a lost
cause as he allowed three more runs in two in
nings of work as Stanford was polished off 10-
5 on its way to getting eliminated three days
later.
After seeing last year's team inexplicably
fade at the end of the season, it looked like
Cogan's only CWS memories would be of
being a bit player in LSD's national champi
onship hit parade.
Even though he led Stanford in appear
ances with 30 and had the second-lowest ERA
on the team at 3.08. it looked like his efforts
would be for a young team that was still a year
away. Even though he had picked up as many
saves this season, seven, than in the previous
two seasons combined, it looked like it would
mean little with defending national champion
USC coming to town.
But when Saturday's situation presented it
self. Cogan knew exactly what to do. He was
the veteran of this young pitching staff and
knew all too well how precious these opportu
nities were. If anyone was going to bring them
back to Omaha, it was going to be Cogan — a
point well understood by Wayne.
"We have a great closer in
Cogan." he said. "At the same time,
it wasn't my time. It was Tony's
time."
Indeed, it was Tony's time to
bring the perfect ending to Satur
day's game and allow for this re
markable season to continue. And it
was also fitting that the final out was
a ground ball to fellow senior Josh
Hochgesang, who threw to junior

first baseman John Gall for the out.
Those two were also on the 1997
team and will be looking to reac
quaint themselves with the cozy
confines of Rosenblatt Stadium in
Omaha starting Saturday night
against Cal-State Fullerton.
Cogan said two weeks ago after
setting the appearances record how
he dreams of throwing that last
strike of the CWS or being on the
mound for that final out.
He may fulfill that dream yet, but
for now he can savor the next-best
thing — being on the mound for the
final out that got the Cardinal there.
