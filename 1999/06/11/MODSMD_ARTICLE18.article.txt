## Cobb keeps racer's focus 
### Barry Cooper 
Last year on Nov. 24, the Stanford
women's cross country team came
just shy of a repeat of its 1996 cham
pionship season. It was handed its
first defeat of the year when the No.
2-ranked women from Brigham
Young edged it by two points at the
NCAA Championships at Furman
University in Greensboro, S.C.
That race was an emotional con
clusion to a memorable season, one
in which the CCardinal was ranked No.
1 until the very end. Reality did not
turn out as sweet as the women had
dreamed. For the captain of this
year's squad, senior Mary Cobb, sec
ond place was not an easy feeling.
"It was hard because we prepared
all season to come out on top," Cobb
said. "It was a shock. There was no
reason why we shouldn't have won. It
was a fluke."
Unlike her teammates, Mary
Cobb could not use that motivation
moving into the track season. Just
two months after her 22nd-place per
formance at crosscountry Nationals,
which earned her a third-straight All-
American award, she suffered a
stress fracture in a metatarsal in her
left foot.
Different from the more common
injury of runners, stress fractures in
the shins, Cobb had no warning signs.
Mary remembers, "One morning I
just woke up and my foot really hurt."
It was not the best of news for
Cobb, especially considering that she
feels her all out speed is an asset bet
ter taken advantage of on the track
than on the cross country course.
She speaks the truth. In 1997 she
112 inished second in the S,(XX) meters at
the outdoor NCAA Championships.
When Cobb was told by the team's
doctor that she would not be able to
compete until this fall, she was disap

pointed to say the least.
Fortunately, Cobb seems to view
things in their proper perspective.
"It was good in a lot of ways. It was
good to have a break. When I came
back to training I knew it was some
thing I wanted," Cobb said.
Not running for a while seems to
have focused ( obb more than ever.
"I am really enjoying running and
I'm more comfortable now with run
ning as a part of my life than ever be
fore," Cobb said. "I know how happy
it makes me feel."
Not only is Cobb back in action
and running strong, but she has been
handed the responsibility of being
captain this season to a team with six
freshman faces. Cobb gladly accept
ed the job.
"Its exciting. You're a role model
and you've got to help the freshmen
with questions. The best part is being
captain of this team. Our team is very
young and fresh and alive. I'm so
lucky," explained Cobb.
But Cobb isn't just a happy-go
lucky girl. Nor is she shy about talking
about touchy subjects.
"I don't know why I ran 22nd," at
Nationals she said. "It was not my
goal to finish (22nd). The competi
tion is good, but I see myself better
than I placed. I don't know what hap
pened. but 1 don't want it to happen
again."
Lananna was not as hard on Cobb.
"Athletics is about ups and downs.
Cobb just didn't have her best day at
NCAAs," Lananna said.
Despite what Lananna says, Cobb
will not forget the meet last year.
"It's really hard to forget about it
and I'm not going to forget about it. It
makes you hungrier," she said.
And that hunger has carried over
into this season.
"I'm feeling really great so far. My
goal for each race is to be strong. I'm

not worrying about the outcome so
much, but it does matter. Yet, I'm not
going to beat myself up. I am willing
to take the risks required to succeed.
At Nationals, 1 definitely want to be
up there."
One thing the past year has clear
ly taught Cobb is not to take anything
for granted. Still, that has not stopped
her from setting goals for after this
season.
"I want to be at an even higher col
legiate level," she said. "I want to win
[an NCAAI title for myself. That's
what I'm striving for."
After college, Cobb has high aims
as well.
"Competing in Olympic trials and
making the team is something I've al
ways been dreaming about."
Assistant coach Beth Alford-Sul
livan thinks she has a great shot.
"Cobb came to Stanford the same
year as I," said Alford-Sullivan.
"Over four years her intensity level
has been consistently high. What has
really grown is her perspective. Cobb
has everything in the right perspec
tive. Wherever she sets her goals is
what she can achieve. Talent-wise
she's phenomenal."
Thus far, five Ail-American sea
sons have not kept Cobb from her
academics. A pre-med student, she
plans to earn her degree in psycholo
gy. Eventually, she plans to attend
medical school to study either psy
chology or pediatrics.
If her running career continues in
the way its headed, eventually may be
later than sooner. Sydney is calling in
2(XH). One thing is certain: the future
is bright for Cobb.
