# Graduate Students Respond to Racist E-mail
## 
### 
An incident occurred this weekend that sent a wave of shock and outrage across
Stanford University. On Saturday morning an tis of yet unidentified individual sent
a racist, inflammatory e-mail targeting graduate students of color to as many as
30,000 leland account users. Specifically, it accused African Americans and Latinos of receiv
ing "preferential treatment" in the graduate student housing lottery "because [of] the color
of their skin." In addition, this e-mail encouraged divisiveness among students on campus,
stating that white students and Asian students should "stand up and fight for what's right."
This is a direct affront to all students by suggesting that some members of the Stanford com
munity are not a welcomed and valued part of the University.
As African American and Latino graduate students at Stanford, we are outraged and dis
gusted by this direct attack upon us both personally and collectively. In addition we are sim
ilarly appalled that a valued member of the community, Prisdha Dharma, has allegedly been
falsely targeted as the source of this e-mail. Truly we recognize that as a community when
one member is victimized we all suffer. Our hope is that as we struggle to reconcile this inci
dent personally and collectively we will remember all of the individuals affected.
In light of this hateful act, we intend to: 1) Endorse the University's continued expedient
attention to this incident; 2) Illustrate the broader context from which this incident erupt
ed; and 3) Provide recommendations for future University action.
From the moment students, faculty, and staff received this e-mail, we have experienced
feelings of violation. Students, staff and faculty met on Sunday with Vice Provost Jim
Montoya and other key student affairs administrators.. At this meeting, many individuals
expressed their concerns about the incident and Jacqueline Wender, Assistant to the
President, shared portions of Gerhard Casper's letter denouncing the incident.
However, while President Casper's response conveyed his sense of outrage, his noticeable
absence from Sunday's meeting suggests a lack of personal investment in this issue. Several
students present asked about the absence of President Casper. While the Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Jim Montoya asserted that he was the initiator of the meeting and felt per
sonally compelled to meet on Sunday, the President's lack of appearance at the meeting was
never fully explained. The holiday weekend may have made it awkward for some people to
attend the meeting, but we feel that the President has a responsibility to this community.
Many administrators were there and served as "representatives" for the President, but given
the severity of this situation what was most needed was not micro-management, but LEAD
ERSHIP This was a time of crisis, and our President was not there.
In his statement regarding this incident, President Casper urged the Stanford community
"to be particularly careful before generalizing from an incident like this." While we agree
that caution is necessary, it is important to expose the reality that this is not an isolated inci
dent. We need only look at recent events to see that for many people, issues of intolerance
are a daily reality on this campus. The irresponsible comments on the Leadership 2000
"Race and Ethnicity" wall illustrate this trend. The low percentage of tenure among women
and faculty of color, as well as the current investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor into
the University's tenure policy also highlight this issuee. Additionally, the perceived transition
from a centralized institutional commitment to Affirmative Action to a decentralized system
of departmentally defined "diversity," underscores the problem further. These facts raise
doubt about the central coordination of the University's commitment to the recruitment
AND retention of graduate students from historically underrepresented groups.
We share in the anger and outrage of the entire Stanford Community regarding this act of
violence against the campus as a whole, and African American and Latino graduate students
in particular. The incident must be used to compel each and every member of this commu
nity to initiate and participate in open and honest dialogue about the environment that
allowed for such hatred to be expressed.

In order to create a more tolerant and inclusive community, we call on all members of
Stanford to address the following:
• The racism of Saturdays e-mail and the climate from which it arose is not simply
an issue for students of color, but a problem that affects ALL community members.
• The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but with this right comes
responsibility. We urge all members of this community to exercise this responsibili
ty to createa new community climate in which there is support, encouragement
and appreciation of diversity and the richness it brings to the prestige of our insti
tution. Moreover, a clear and decisive policy regarding hate-speech must be out
lined and defended by the University.
• We want to emphasize that the issue of racism is clear in this act of hate-speech
and must not get lost under rhetoric of criminal computer-usage violations. The
individuals who received this e-mail must be appraised of their rights in regard to
filing charges against the writer(s) of this act of hatred.
• The housing shortage affecting graduate students appears to have been the impetus for
this particular destructive e-mail. This reality shows the need for the University to deal
more efficiently with issues affecting graduate students. While the University has
recently begun construction of additional graduate housing on campus, has increased
some of the graduate student stipends and has taken steps to provide limited subsidies
for off campus housing, this incident underscores that there is still more that must be
done. Until graduate students are supported as a more integral part of this institution,
dissatisfaction and hostility may continue to rise.
The circumstances outlined throughout this letter point to Stanford's need to continue
efforts to provide a more proactive approach to maintaining an inclusive community. While
there are dedicated individuals and supportive spaces at Stanford, the university must remain
vigilant in developing a comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing issues of race,
ethnicity, gender and sexuality in all areas of campus life.
While some individuals may feel that we are over-analyzing this situation, we must empha
size that the racist e-mail did not occur in isolation of other issues on this campus. As stu
dents of color, we do not have the privilege of allowing this act to pass without response. NO
ONE can be silent. NO ONE should have the privilege to be silent. If we value our human
ity, if we value our community, then the time to act is NOW. As a graduate student coalition,
we urge faculty to voice their outrage and act with us. We urge staff to voice their outrage
and act with us. We urge students OF ALL RACES to voice their outrage and act with us.
Stanford's excellence depends upon every individual's commitment to building community.
