# Golfer Kribel joins the ranks of Cardinal elite
## 
### Ramona Shelburne Contributing writer 
For most athletes, playing along
side 01 even just meeting a profes
sional athlete is only a dream. For
Stanford golfer Joel Kribel. it is old
hat.
Kribel has twiee played in the U.S.
Open and onee participated in the
Masters. While there. Kribel had the
opportunity to tee off with the likes
of Masters champion Phil Mickelson.
IW7 British Open winner Justin
Leonard and 1997 PGA Champi
onship winner Davis Love 111.
Yet Kribel claims that he was not
intimidated.
*'l played with liger [Woods)
when he was here, and he's the guy
that everybody's looking at. Once 1
got to know him on a personal level,
I wasn't intimidated or overwhelmed
[by professional golfers]."
Rather than just enjoy the
scenery, Kribel used his PGA Tour
experiences as a learning tool.
"Anytime you have a chance to
play with somebody better than you.
it helps you to evaluate where you
stand, what you need to do to im
prove your game. I really appreciat
ed how many of the professionals
went out of their way to help me."
Playing in the U.S. Open and the
Masters also reinforced Kribel's de
sire to one day turn professional.
"Playing in those tournaments
gave me a taste of what's out there
and made me more hungry to get
there again."
But Kribel did not always envi
sion himself as a professional golfer.
Alter narrowing his choices down to
baseball or golf, Kribel finally settled
on the latter.
"I had to make a choice, it was
tough. At that time, there weren't as
many golfers my age who were really
good whereas there were a lot of
good baseball players my age."
Judging from his performances at
Stanford and the promising PGA
lout career that awaits him. it seems

the choice was a good one.
At Stanford, kribel has been a
mainstay for Cardinal coach Wally
Goodwin. Kribel has twice earned
First Team All-American honors
and last year finished second at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships and fourth at the NCAA Re
gional Tournament.
"I never have to worry about Joel.
I Ic gets over his problems on the golf
course very quickly." Goodwin said.
"From the standpoint of mental
toughness, he's right up there with
the best I've ever coached."
I ligh praise indeed from someone
who has coached PGA Tour profes
sionals Woods and Casey Martin,
among others.
This season, the senior has been
the captain of the Stanford golf team
both on and off the course. Kribel has
been the team's most consistent
golfer, finishing in the top 10 in each
of Stanford's first three tournaments.
"He's the motor that drives the
boat." said C loodwin.
Kribel is currently ninth after his
individual ranking fell due to his
eighth-place finish at the Wolfpack
Classic, the first time he has placed
out of the top five in his last 12 colle
giate tournaments.
"So far 1 feel like I've played pret
ty well but it goes without saying that
there's room for improvement," Kri
bel said.
Though most golfers would be
happy with the season he has turned
in so far, Kribel is always looking for
ways to improve.
"In golf, you learn to play from ex
perience. After each shot, you have
to think about what you did right,
what you did wrong, and what you
could do differently the next time
you have that shot." Kribel said.
"Golf is so individually based, it's up
to you to decide what your going to
work on."
The willingness to work hard has
always been in Klibel's nature. A
self-described perfectionist, his com
petitive nature has carried him from

local tournaments in Northern Cali
fornia as a teenager to medalist hon
ors at the 1998 U.S. Amateur Open.
"My dad gave me every opportu
nity to play whatever I wanted as a
kid." Kribel said. "I was very fortu
nate in that way. because he gave me
that opportunity, I've never needed
outside motivation. Whatever sport I
played. I had to be good at."
Like most successful athletes. Kri
bel seems to perform better when
placed under pressure — a charac
teristic which is especially important
in an individually based sport like
golf.
According to Goodwin, Kribel
has always had the right mindset to
be a successful golfer.
"When I saw him play as an 11th
grader, I thought, 'God, I hope this
kid never changes his swing or his ap
proach to the game.'"
Kribel's ability to perform under
pressure is part of the reason that his
future in golf is so bright. Unlike
team sports where the team can still
win if its star has a bad day, golfers
are accountable only to themselves.
If a golfer has a bad round, he does
not make any money that week.
Kribel hopes to turn professional
next summer and has the potential to
do very well.
"There's only a small difference
between the skill levels of the golfers
on tour." Goodwin said. "From what
I've seen, Joel's right up there with
Tiger and Casey."
Playing with world-class golfers at
the U.S. Open and the Masters has
shown Kribel where he is going and
what he needs to do to get there.
Given his willingness to work hard
and competitive nature, there ap
pears to be no limit on where he can
g°-
