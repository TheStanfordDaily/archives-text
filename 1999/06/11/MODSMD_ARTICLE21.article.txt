## 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial Staff 
Never in senior Tracye Lawyer's
wildest freshman dreams, as a walk
on to the soccer team and a jumper
on the track team, did she expect to
accomplish so much on the Farm.
Although it may have been her
destiny to become a great athlete —
her father, a political science proles
sor. played basketball and track at
Princeton, her mother was a stand
out track athlete in high school and

her two brothers both ran track in
college and one played football —
Lawyer has exceeded even her own
expectations.
Lawyer is an important part of
both the women's soccer team and
the women's track team.
Athletics have been an important
part of her family and. not surpris
ingly, she learned many of her skills
at the hand of her two older brothers
growing up in Santa Barbara.
Lawyer remembers rough-hous
ing with them, but more importantly

looking up to them, hoping she
would one day he as good an athlete
as they were.
"They made me tough,'" Lawyer
said. "Hut it paid off through the
years, I'm not a wimp."
Now, however, they are her
biggest fans along with her parents.
Last weekend, her father surprised
her and made the five-hour drive
Ironi Santa Barbara to watch Stan
ford play Santa C lara and her moth
er routinely flies from Texas to
watch Lawyer compete.

"I was lucky because I had cool
parents who just let me go," Lawyer
said. "I am so lucky to have been
able to play two sports, it's been a
great lesson for life."
Lawyer also receives "hundreds
of e-mails" from her brothers, who
keep close track of how Stanford and
their star little sister are doing.
They have had a lot to follow.
Coming out of Kate High School
in Santa Barbara, Lawyer was quick
ly made into a heptathlete on the
Stanford track team. In hii>h school.

she competed in lour out ot the
seven events and picked up the other
three quickly.
Since then, she has gathered four
All-America honors in the event in
the past two years, both in the indoor
and outdoor seasons. She is the 1997
and 199,8 winner of the Pacific 10
Conference heptathlon and she took
second place in the event at nation
als last year and was sixth in the high
jump. The California State high
jump champion her sophomore year
of high school. Lawyer is still
stronger at jumping and hates the
8(X)-meter race.
As for soccer, Lawyer was the
second leading scorer for the Cardi
nal last year and was named I irst-
Team All Pac-10. This year she has
been instrumental in the Cardinal's
(5-1-2) success and leads the team in
scoring.
Lawyer, a biology major, does
have plans after she graduates to
train for at least a year in track to try
and make the 2(M)0 Olympics. She
plans to eventually become a pedia
trician. her lifelong dream, but
hasn't figured soccer out of the equa
tion yet.
"Soccer is my favorite sport and I
feel I have a lot of room to improve,"
Lawyer said. "I have a better chance
to make the Olympics in track but
soccer is still there and always will
be."
It hasn't always been that way.
After a frustrating freshman year.
Lawyer considered quitting the
team and concentrating solely on
track. However, head coach Steve
Swanson was brought in as the new
coach and Lawyer changed her
mind.
Because of her experience as a
freshman, she has tried especially
hard to make the rookies I'eel wel
come. Lawyer attributes much of the
team's success to the chemistry it
feels off the field.
"It's all coming together,"
Lawyer said. " The first year was a
sort of experiment, last year many

people were injured but this year
everyone is healthy and we all un
derstand the strategy and what
works well."
Playing two sports has never been
a burden for Lawyer and skills de
veloped in each sport have helped
the other. Her speed and jumping
ability has helped her soccer game
and the heavy conditioning regimen
during soccer season has helped her
track skills, especially in the dreaded
8(X)-meter race.
"Everyone on the soccer team
has different roles and I am the
speedy person who can jump high."
said Lawyer. "While in track, soccer
has really helped my fitness level."
Her jumping ability is a useful
asset as Lawyer has score many goals
off of headers. Her speed, paired
with forward redshirt junior Kelly
Adamson's quick footwork, have
proved deadly on the front line this
season.
"Kelly is awesome and has in
credible creativity on the front line,"
Lawyer said. "We work well togeth
er."
Despite all of Lawyer's accom
plishments in both soccer and track,
the best is yet to come.
"I've never trained for one sport
very long." Lawyer said. After soc
cer is over in December. Lawyer be
gins training immediately for the in
door track season. "I don't know
what I've lost in soccer because of
training for track oi vice versa. I
don't know my lull potential yet. It
will he interesting to see how well I
can do."
II the past is any indication.
Lawyer will do just fine.

This piece originally ran September
30, IWB. In track, Lawyer went on to
capture the 19W NCAA heptathlon
title, as well us her third consecutive
Pac-10 heptathlon title. The
women's soccer team lost in the first
round of the NCAA playoffs to
HYU.
