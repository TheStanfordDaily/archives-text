# Gaw plays quiet hero for Stanford soccer
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
RIC HMOND. Va.— "110 per
cent in everything."
For anyone who has watched
Shan Gaw on the soccer field, this
motto should come as no surprise.
"That means on the field and off
the field." the senior explained. "It
means to go above and beyond
what is expected and go above and
beyond what I think 1 can do. I
think when you go above and be
yond the call of duty in whatever
you do. whether it be writing a
paper or mowing the lawn, it car
ries over and becomes a regular
thing."
This personal philosophy has
driven all aspects of Claw's life, and
fortunately for the Stanford soccer
team, it has particularly driven his
play on the field,
Gaw is one of the Cardinal's un
sung heroes. I le does not lead Stan
ford in scoring goals. He is not the
leading assist man. nor does he take
the ball uplield with fancy loot
work.
"I am the sitting midfielder."
Gaw laughed. "I don't have the
most glamorous job. 1 do some of
the dirty work."
But Gaw certainly does more
than "sit" on the field.
Gaw wins balls.
This season, he frustrated oppo
nents by shutting dovv n some of the
top midfielders in the country, in
cluding Creighton's Richard Mul
rooney, St. John's Stefani Miglio
ranzi and Virginia's Jason Moore.
Stanford head coach Bobbv

Clark understands the importance
of Gaw's contributions.
"Shan could be one of the hard
est players to replace next year be
cause I don't think we appreciate
the ability he has to win the ball in
the midfield." Clark said.
Gaw has settled into this role for
the Cardinal the past two years
after playing a more offensive posi
tion his first two seasons. But in the
spring of Claw's second season, it
was Clark who helped him realize
this talent of winning balls.
"After [the l l )%] season, I re
member asking Shan. 'What do you
think you are good at?' And he said
I'm good on the ball, good techni
cally. good at passing.'" Clark said.
"I then said. 'What do you think
you are best at?" And he gave that
blank stare, and I said. What you
are best at is winning the ball.' I
think he suddenly realized i am
brilliant at this.'"
This strength on the field comes
as no surprise to those who know
(law's personality.
"Shan is one of the most stub
born guys in the business. You
can't dominate him. It is a tremen
dous trait." Clark explains.
Gaw articulates this trait as his
tenacity.
"I hate to lose." he bluntly ad
mits. "I hate to lose both games and
individual battles."
And while Gaw is the epitome
of intensity on the field, his role in
the clubhouse is quite different.
"I guess I am a joker." he ex
plains. "1 like to have fun in the
locker room, joking and laughing,
but when there is something seri

ous. I will say it."
Clark stresses that this quiet
leadership is one of Gaw's main
contributions to the team.
"He is a leader on and off the
field. He doesn't say much, hut if
Shan does, everyone listens. He
doesn't always say it with words.
Sometimes it is the way he acts. But
he isn't scared to stand up for what
he thinks is important. He is very
much a leader."
As a fifth-year senior, Gaw's ex
perience has naturally contributed
to this leadership role.
I'he fifth-year status is a result of
a medical redshirt during his first
year on the Farm. In his very first
practice during the preseason of his
freshman year in 1994, Gaw went
down with a torn anterior cruciate
ligament. He was sidelined for four
months and did not see time in a
game until the following year. Then
during 1996. Clark's first season.
Gaw was sidelined for another
month with a sprained medial cru
ciate ligament — this time in his
other knee.
Redshirting his true freshman
year gave Gaw an extra year of eli
gibility. And though frustrating at
the time, perhaps everything hap
pens for a reason, as Gaw was then
able to train under Clark for three
years and play a huge role in Stan
lord's 1998 playoff run.
Gaw, however, was brought to
Stanford before the Clark era.
He met Colin Lindores, Stan
ford's head coach before Clark, at a
West Coast Olympic Development
Camp in the summer before his se
nior year in high school. Playing in

ODP vv;is the first time Ciaw began
to receive national attention, and
also became the first time he con
sidered playing soccer in college.
"I wasn't even planning on
going to college to play soccer. I
was just going to go and study,"
(law said.
But the national camps attract
ed the attention of colleges, and
Stanford University, not Stanford
soccer, won the prize.
"None of the other schools had
the Stanford appeal," Gaw ex
plained. "It might not have been

the best soccer school, but its Stan
ford."
But Gaw has played a crucial
role in the turnaround of the Stan
ford soccer program.
Last season he was voted team
MVP by his teammates and was
named to the second team NSC'A A
Far West Region All-America
team. This season he received All-
MI'SF second team honors.
And now that his Stanford soc
cer career is over, the product de
sign major is not sure what lies
ahead.

"I haven't really thought about
it. I have no idea how the whole
(Major League Soccer] thing works
really," Gaw admits. "But it" some
one wants me. I'd play for them.
"But, it is a weird thought that I
might just hang up my boots and
never play again."

Solid play, not fancy footwork or impressive numbers, made Shan Gaw a standout on the men's soccer
team. Stanford took second in the NCAA, losing to Indiana in the national title game.
