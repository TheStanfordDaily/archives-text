# King Arthur leaves court with an epic performance
## 
### Brian Eule Senior staff writer 
Under the "Arthur Lee File,"
buried in this year's basketball
yearbook, is the heading and re
sponse, "My parents were right
when they told me: college would
go by quickly."
And for Lee, it has.
Saturday night. King Arthur's
court was in session for one last
time in Maples Pavilion, as the No.
b Cardinal rolled by the No. 7 Ari
zona Wildcats 98-83 in the final
home game of the season.
For Lee, a career-high 29-point
performance 50 percent from
the field, 50 percent from behind
the three-point line and a perfect
12 of 12 from the free-throw line —
was ;i good way to end a career in
Maples, among thousands ol fans
chanting his name.
It's good to be the king.
The man who came to Stanford
almost four years ago, intent to
challenge point guard Brevin
Knight every day in practice, has
brought several things to this cam
pus with him.
Last year, it was a trip to the
Final Four with his "Miracle
Minute" win against Rhode Island
in the NCAA tournament.
Saturday night, it was Stanford's
first-ever Pacific 10 Conference
title.
"This is the best feeling ever."
Lee said, after spending a good hall
hour running around Maples with
Stanford's student section.
"To do it on Senior Night. I can't
even describe it with words. We
talked about it all season long."
Furthermore. Lee got to go up
against long-time rival Jason Terry
and prove just whose house this
was Lee's house.
Just about a month ago, lerrv

took the Cardinal for a ride in the
MeKale Center, defeating Stan
lord. 78-76, with a last-second shot
and a 29-point performance of his
own.
But he made one mistake. He let
Lee have the last laugh.
"We were thinking about pay
back all week long," Lee said.
"'l'hey really gave it to us down
there. So we had someone in
[Terry's] face all night so it
wouldn't he easy for him."
But as one poked fun as the
other shot free throws, and as the
roles reversed moments later, it
was clear that these two were more
than rivals they were friends.

'It was a fitting perfor
mance for Art Lee. I think
the whole thing worked out,
if you could write a script.'
— Head coach
Mike Montgomery

Despite the fact that lerrv
played high school ball in Seattle,
Wash., and Lee played in Southern
California, Lee said he was con
stantly aware of Terry and his sta
tus as the two made their decisions
of where to go to college.
Lee chose to come to the small
est arena in the conference to hack
up one of the best guards in the
conference.
"I just remember coming in here
and being a freshman." he said last
night. He was just "watching
lirevin and waiting for m\ time."
While his time certainly came
long ago. Saturday night didn't
hurt in reminding everyone that
Lee is ready for his final NCAA
tournament.
**11 was a fitting performance for

Art Lee," said Stanford head coaeh
Mike Montgomery. "I think the
whole thing worked out, if you
eould write a script."
Maybe the kid from L.A. would
know a thing or two about that ...
Opening Scene: It's early in the
morning. The sun is rising and a car
travels North on the 1-5. Two men
share stories, smile, and enjoy
some time away from work.
Since Lee's freshman year, his
father has made this six-hour drive
for almost every home game, along
with Bruce Seaton (senior Mark
Seaton's father).
On a Thursday night, the two fa
thers are forced to leave immedi
ately after the game's conclusion,
heading back to Southern Califor
nia in order to arrive at work by K
a.m. It's a lot of driving, but it's
worth seeing their sons grow into
men.
Closing Scene: The entire stu
dent section has engulfed Stan
ford's Pac-1() Champions, the first
time the school has claimed such a
title, and Lee is high-living as many
as he can. Alter jumping up on a
table and pumping his fist, he
somehow sneaks out of the crowd,
with basketball in hand, runs
around the mass of black Sixth
Man shirts at center court, and
finds his father. 1 le gives him a hug.
Curtain Call: Alter a final Pac
-10 roadtrip to the Oregon schools,
Stanford is ready for the I W-)
NCAA tournament. It's a chance
to get back to the Final Four. It's a
chance to top a Lac-10 title.
It's a chance to show the country
who is the kine.
