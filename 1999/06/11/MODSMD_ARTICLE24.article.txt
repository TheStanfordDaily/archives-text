# Veteran Fruen guides young women's hoops
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Senior staff writer 
Former Stanford great Jamila
Wideman dribbled the ball quickly
up the court, dodged a lunging de
fender and passed off to Stanford
all-time leading scorer Kate Starbird
on the wing. Starbird. double
teamed. tossed the ball out to Regan
Freuen. who put the ball through the
hoop with her familiar pigeon-toed
jump shot.
Then Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer blew her whistle, and
practice continued with shooting
drills and sprints.
After three years of playing Pa
cific 10 Conference championship
and Final Four basketball with Ail-
Americans like Wideman and Star
bird, Freuen now faces the skilled
veterans only in practice, where they
work out with the team.
When game time arrives, Freuen
takes the floor with players two,
three and four years younger than
she. And after three years of cham
pionship-level basketball. Freuen
now plays on an unranked team that
is third in the Pac-10.
"It's been hard; 1 haven't lost this
many games my whole career here,"
Freuen said. "I don't deal with losses
very well."
Freuen has been an asset even in
the team's losses, according to Van-
Derveer. because of her persever
ance. "She goes 'damn' and keeps
working." VanDerveer said.
Freuen has found her role on the
young team, both as a breakout
player and a locker-room leader
whom VanDerveer calls a "second
coach."
VanDerveer pointed to the im
portance of having a player on the
team with a connection to Stanford's
win nine tradition.

"That's the thing with Regan -
she can explain to our team, 'look,
this is why we're doing this.... This
has worked/ " she said.
Freuen noted that "1 can help be
cause I've been in every role: I've
not played, I've redshirted. I've
come off the bench and I've start
ed."
Indeed. Freuen, a fifth-year se
nior. has traveled a varied path
through Stanford's recent basket
ball history. As a freshman, Freuen
saw little time behind players like
Starbird and Vanessa Nvgaard.
During her sophomore year, her ef
fectiveness was hampered by injury,
and she missed her entire third year
due to a stress fracture in her right
hip.
Last year she started the final 13
games and gave a valiant 19-point ef
fort in the team's first-round tourna
ment loss to I larvard.
"It wasn't easy for her." Van-
Derveer said. "She didn't play a lot
as a freshman, [then] she was hurt a
lot. She's a great example tor deter
mination and sticking with things."
This year, alternating between a
starting and a reserve role. Freuen
has sparkled.
She hit the winning free throw in
November to beat then-No. 1 Pur
due. scored a career-high 34 points
to lead Stanford to a dramatic win at
I ( I .A lasi month and had 21 points
in last night's 82-73 win over Ore
gon.
"When you're on those streaks,
the basket just gets bigger and big
ger." she said.
Freuen's recent individual high
lights cannot measure up to her early
team successes, however.
"Going to three Final Fours was
an incredible experience; it's memo
ries for a lifetime." she said.
Freuen admits that the team is

not likely to make it back to the
Final Four in this, her final season.
She does believe, however, that the
team has great potential.
"We've shown that we can play
with the top teams," she said. "At
this point, our problems are more
mental than physical."
VanDerveer said that she and
Freuen are both often frustrated by
the team's youth.
"It's hard to communicate some
times to young players and young
teams that sometimes if they just
worked a little bit harder - gave just
a little bit more - how much more
they would enjoy it," VanDerveer
said.
Freuen agrees that "with younger
players, it's not always possible to
understand the whole picture."
After another few weeks of pro
viding an example for her young
teammates, however, Freuen's 90-
odd game Stanford career will be
over, and the last link to Stanford's
Final Four streak will be gone.
"I'm not focusing right now on
the fact that Saturday is my last
home game." Freuen said. "But 1
know that as the game approaches,
and when my family and friends
show up and I see the crowd. Ill get
emotional."
But Freuen knows that, wherever
she may be next March, she can al
ways call Maples Pavilion home.
While she may have to turn in her
Stanford uniform, she can always
come back to practice and torment a
new generation with the Wideman
to Starbird to Freuen connection.
