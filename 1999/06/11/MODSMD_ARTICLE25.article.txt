# National team can't tear Crary from Cardinal polo
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
Senior Heather Crary is a part of the Stanford tradi
tion of excellence in more ways than one.
Crary grew up just miles away from campus. She's
been to almost every football game since she was seven
years old. Her grandfather, Sherman Crary. played
football for the Cardinal in 1929. Now, as a senior co
captain of the Stanford women's water polo team,
Crary represents the best Stanford has to offer in the
way of athletics, academics and most of all - leadership.
"I always felt like [Stanford] was my school and 1 be
longed here," Crary said. "I wanted to go to Stanford,
wherever it was, and it just happened to be near home."
Now Crary is filling her role as a successful scholar
athlete and wearing the Cardinal colors with pride.
"She loves playing polo, she loves Stanford athletics
and she just exudes pride in her role," said Stanford
head coach John Tanner. From Crary "you get the

sense that it's an honor to he a part of the Stanford tra
dition."
Crary is so happy with life and sports at Stanford that
she gave up the chance to play with the U.S. Women's
National team to finish out her senior year.
"I was on the [national] team for about five days,"'
Crary said. "But I would have had to miss my senior
year. I just wanted to move on and [playing with the
U.S. team] didn't fit in with my schedule."
But more importantly, the National team couldn't
take the place of the Stanford squad in Crary's heart.
"That team is nothing compared to the Stanford
team." Crary said. "I get great friendships and people I
really like to be with all the time. The National team
was more like a job. II I'm going to spend this much
time doing something, it has to be fun."
Crary said her New Year's resolution every year is to
"make sure I'm always having fun." But that's not to
say that having fun interferes with Crary's dedication to
winning.

"I love to win. but the main part is the team and I'd
do anything for this team. It's about being able to share
both victories and losses with your team. The games are
only fun because of who you're playing with and this is
the best team I've ever been on."
Crary contributes quite a bit in and out of the water
toward making her team so good.
"I'm a more silent, strong, backbone in the water'
type of captain. [My teammates] know they can look to
me because I've always been that reliable person in the
background."
Her calm, solid and consistent attitude and perfor
mance provide a locus of confidence and stability lor
the team.
"People admire Heather's calmness." Tanner said.
"She's not somebody who leads cheers or is very vocal.
But when she says something her words are carefully
chosen."
And the message seems to be getting across because
Crarv has definitely instilled her teammates with conli

dence and admiration.
"Heather is solid as a rock." said senior Nicole Cilaz
er. "It's especially fitting she's the goalie because she's
the last line of defense. She's always back there to sup
port you. both in and out ot the water.
Crary also works hard to create an open atmosphere
on the deck.
"We have a lot of distinct personalities on this
team." Crary said. "And 1 think its important to have an
open arena where you can act the way you want to act
and say what you want to say."
For Crary, that also translates into doing what you
want to do in life, no matter what anyone else says.
"There's no reason to suffer through something you
don't like just because someone wants you to or be
cause you think you should." Crary said. "If you're not
enjoying something and it's not making you happy, you
should find what you love."
And in whatever she chooses to do in the future,
there's no doubt that Crary will be a success.
"Heather is good at everything she does," Tanner
said. "She's successful in everything she sets out to do."
But Crary's most successful role is the one she fills as
a dependable friend and leader for the people in her
life.
"She'll always be a person that others strive to be
like because she excels in all areas," Cilazer said. "I tell
her she's my hero, and I think that's true of a lot of peo
ple."
Besides being a hero for her teammates, there's one
particular legacy Crary will leave the team with that
sums up her love of fun and her dedication to excel
lence â€” the freshman initiation synchronized swim
ming routine performed during the men's Big Splash
match against Cal.
Crary thought up the stunt her sophomore year and
it has been a tradition ever since.
"I hope it continues because of what it stands for."
Crary said. "It's the initiation onto the team. It's the
first thing that really gets the freshmen to be a part of
the team and of what's going on. But there's also the fun
aspect of it."
Crary will leave the program with some perspective
of her own.
"I'm going to miss spending so much time with peo
ple I love so much. After these four years, 1 know just
what dedication, hard work and an awesome group of
people can accomplish. And I hope wherever I go 1 can
always have something like that."
