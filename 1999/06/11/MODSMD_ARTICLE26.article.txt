32 years ago, it would have read the same thing: 1(X) but
terlly. first place. Wales.
On the second day ot the 1999 NCAA Men's Swim
ming and Diving Championships in Indianapolis, Stan
ford senior co-captain Dod Wales won the 100 butterfly in
45.89 seconds, the same event his father, Ross Wales, won
lor Princeton in 1967 at the NCAA Championships held
at Michigan State with a time of 50.26.
I his is the lirst time in the history of NCAA swimming
that father and son have won the same event at the na
tional meet. I he N( A A not only recognized this amazing
(eat. but also asked Ross Wales to present the awards to
the top eight finalists in the 100 fly. shaking his eldest son's
hand and handing him the national champion medal with
tears in his eyes.
"My dad s usually not an extremely emotional per
son. Dod Wales said. "My mom takes care of that for all
four of us in the family."
"I m not emotional except when it comes to my family,
especially my boys," Ross Wales added. "This has been a
long time coming [for Dod]."
Ross Wales and his wile. J.J., as well as Dod's younger
brother, C raig, and a handful of aunts, uncles and cousins
all attended the competition. Craig, a butterllyer on the
Princeton swim team, llew in from New Jersey to see Dod
compete.
"It meant a lot to have my family, my brother here. It
really touched me that they took a couple moments to ex
plain that [my dad] won this, too," Dod Wales said. "It has
been fun to swim fly. because it reminded me of him. It's
fun to please him and make him proud, and I think that
swimming 11 y is the easiest way to do that."
Dod's mother also swam competitively but never up to
the level that Ross did. After securing his butterfly crown.
Ross Wales went on to train and qualified for the 1968
Olympics in the same event. The Olympic Trials were
held at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach where the
Pacific 10 Conference championships are consistently
held. The pool is also the site where Stanford head coach
Skip Kenney and Ross Wales met when Ross was training
and Kenney was first coaching. Ross Wales' Olympic at
tempt was successful: he came home bearing the bronze in
the 1 (X) fly.
But even though Ross has had much success, Dod's
swimming achievements are almost as exciting and satis
fying. Yet it is not swimming alone that makes Ross proud
of Dod: it is the kind of person that Dod is that is the most
gratifying.
"The best way that [Dod] makes me proud is by being
himself. That makes me about as proud as I can imagine."

Ross said. "The fact that he is an outstanding swimmer is
an added blessing and the combination of the two is inde
scribable."
The admiration between father and son is mutual, and
Ross is one of Dod's two greatest role models and teach
ers. The other is Pablo Morales, an Olympian and former
Stanford swimmer and assistant coach.
Ross, even after his swimming career was over, still re
mained involved in the sport. He was president of I ISA
Swimming and is currently the vice president of FIN A. the
world governing swimming body. So. as Dod was growing
up. he not only competed from the age of eight, but also
went to many important competitions.
In 1984. Dod attended the Olympic Trials with his fa
ther. Those 1 rials were held at the same pool where this
year's N( A As were held — the Indiana I Iniversitv / Pur
due I Jniversity Natatorium. This was one of the first times
that the younger Wales saw Morales swim and a year
when the swimming great made the I J.S. Olympic Team.

L ast year. Morales became an assistant coach to the
Stanford team and made being highly successful in the 100
fly more than just a possibility for Wales.
"When Pablo Morales became an assistant coach. 1 re
ally learned how to swim the 1(K) butterfly, both mentally
and with the physical stroke." Dod Wales said. "He was
more of a teacher than my dad was."
Yet Dod's victory is not only historic because of the fact
of the father-son win. but also in the record books. With
his time of 45.89. Dod broke Morales' American record
46.2b. set in 1986. And.in addition leaving his mark twice
in history, Wales clocked the fastest time in the nation,
breaking the fastest time he swam at Pac-lOs early in
March of 46.66.
"About a year ago. I set the goal of breaking Pablo's
record." Dod said. "I felt that I put too much pressure on
myself in the last month. In the prelims, I was a little too
emotional. I wanted it a little too bad. I was out of rhythm.
This evening. I swam like I knew I was capable, and I was

fortunate to put four good laps together."
Though this was something that Ross always thought
was possible when Dod was "an eight year-old and had the
perfect stroke," it wasn't necessarily something that Dod
always considered. In fact, during his senior year in high
school at St. Xavier's in Cincinnati, although the younger
Wales had always had a natural talent for the butterfly, it
didn't feel right to him anymore. So, Wales stopped swim
ming fly and concentrated on his sprinting. Only during his
junior year at Stanford did Dod resume his fly — it just
seemed to feel right again.
This past weekend, it was more right than it ever has
been in so many ways — for Dod Wales' family, for
NCAA swimming history and for the nation.
" This was the goal for the year." Wales said. "I'm glad
it's in the books now."
