# Softball warrior Crouch makes hard work pay off
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
How many athletes wake up to
run at 8 a.m. every morning, by
choice, during the off-season?
How many softball players seek
out extra conditioning with the base
hall team during their off-season?
This fall. Stanford senior Marcy
Crouch took it upon herself to do this
on top of the standard softball fall
training.
This amazing work ethic has led
Crouch to be a key player, not only in
the circle but off the field as well.
What Crouch contributes to the Car
dinal. however, goes beyond her im
pressive pitching and offensive statis
tics.
"Marcy is a great leader and works
very hard." said senior pitcher Becky
Blevins. "When the people you look
up to work hard, it drives you that
much more."
Her coach agrees.
"Marcy's work ethic and desire to
win are second to none," said Stan
ford head coach John Rittman. "She
is definately a competitor. Every time
she steps into the circle or the box,
Marcy is all about winning."
I he Huntington Beach, Calif, na
tive has been one of the keys to the
growth of the Stanford softball pro
gram over the last three years.
When she signed with the Cardi
nal. Stanford softball was in its first
year as a varsity sport and was not yet
fully funded. However. Crouch was
attracted bv the academics of Stan
ford and the appeal of a building pro
gram. as well as the competition of
the Pac-10 and location near home.
Through the summer before her
senior year, however. Crouch had her
mind set on attending Notre Dame.
But. "After my recruiting trip to
Notre Dame. I didn't love it. 1 loved
Stanford, and it had everything to
offer. I am very happy with the deci

sion," she said.
Crouch has already left her mark
in the Stanford books. Going into the
1999 season, she held the highest life
time batting average for a Cardinal
(.294) and, sharing the pitching duties
all four years with fellow senior
Becky Blevins, Crouch had compiled
a lifetime 2.05 ERA.
I'his year she is pitching the best of
her career, as evidenced by the three
perfect games she has already record
ed this season. Her ERA entering the
weekend is 0.72, and she has struck
out 81 batters, while only walking 29.
"Marcy is having an outstanding
year in the circle," Rittman said. "She
has really blossomed and kept oppos
ing hitters off balance all year."
Her catcher, junior Kellie Wigin
ton. cites Crouch's knowledge of the
game as key to her success.
"Marcy does a lot of thinking
about what she wants to throw, and it
has been very effective," Wiginton
said.
"Mv favorite thing about pitching
is the game within the game — the
mental game of pitching," Crouch
said.
Crouch has always challenged
herself on the playing field. Growing
up. her dad. Cary. had her plav on
teams with older girls.
"When I was in second grade. I
played with fifth, sixth and seventh
graders. I had no choice but to get
better and by fourth grade I made the
All Star team." Crouch said. "It
helped me to always play against kids
who were better than me. 1 loved it
it gave me something to work for. I
saw where I wanted to be."
Crouch not only leads by example,
but her teammates take note that she
often adopts the role of a coach.
"She is like another coach for us
on the field," said junior Lauren Gell
man. "She knows every aspect of the
game so well, from fielding to hitting
to pitching, that she can help everv

one improve.
Crouch credits her knowledge of
the game to her father who was her
coach growing up on her club team,
the Southern California Outlaws.
"I would ride to games with my
dad every weekend, and we always
discussed softball in the car." Crouch
said. "I learned the game and learned
to be like his assistant coach."
The Crouch tandem led the Out
laws to two national championships,
at the 12-and-under and 14-and
under level, while the club finished
second at 16 and under and fifth at 18
and under.
This success at the club level was
matched by incredible achievement
at the high school level. As the leader
of the Marina High School softball
team. Crouch guided her squad to
two Division I OF championships
and was named OF player of the
year both times.
In her spare time, between club
and high school softball. Crouch also
excelled in volleyball and soccer. Her
Marina soccer teams, on which she
played sweeper and captained her ju
nior and senior year, won OF during
her sophomore, junior and senior
seasons. Crouch earned CIF defen
sive player of the year honors her
final two years.
These achievements in all three
sports earned Crouch the title of Cal
ifornia Athlete of the Year after her
senior year in high school, and she
was named "the best three-sport ath
lete in Orange County history" bv the
Los Angeles Times.
Through it all. Crouch has never
lost sight of team goals.
"She is truly the ultimate team
player," Rittman said.
