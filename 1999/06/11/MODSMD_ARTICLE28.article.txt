### Jake Willens Staff writer 
Senior Ryan Wolters, captain of
the men's tennis team, capped off his
collegiate career with a fitting end
ing when he and freshman K.J. Hip
pensteel won the NCAA Doubles
Championship Sunday in Athens.
Ga.
In a year in which Wolters and
the Cardinal had a disappointing
loss in the round of 16 to Baylor,
after having won four consecutive
National Championships, Wolters
did his best to make up for it — he
not only came away with his first in
dividual NCAA title, he also
reached the semifinals in the singles
draw before losing to the No. 1 seed.
James Blake of Harvard.
"After our tough team loss, to see
Ryan walk off those courts a winner
was a special thing," said Stanford
assistant coach John Whitlinger.
"He and K.J. really played superb
doubles all week long and they de
served that title. I couldn't be more
happy for both of them. Ryan de
serves to walk away from college
tennis a winner."
With their title, Wolters and 1 lip
pensteel earned themselves a wild
card into the doubles draw of the
U.S. Open this August. In addition,
both Wolters and Hippensteel were
named Ail-Americans, and Wolters
was one of the three finalists for the
Arthur Ashe Sportsmanship Award.
"It will be very special to be able
to play with Wolly in the Open."
Hippensteel said. "That will be an
exciting atmosphere and a great ex
perience. As far as our awards. I was
actually really surprised when peo
ple came up to me and congratulat
ed me on being All American after
our doubles match against IJCLA. I
was so happy for Ryan, because he
definitely deserves both of his hon
ors. He conducts himself with class
out on the court."
The road to the finals was a diffi
cult one for Wolters and Hippen

steel. as their first three matches
were against teams that had beaten
them earlier this season. In the first
round, they defeated Jeff Laski and
Gavin Santag of Illinois, 7-5.6-7,6-2.
The Illinois duo had beaten Wolters
and Hippensteel 6-4, 6-4 in the All-
American tournament in Austin,
Texas.
" The first two sets were back and
forth." Wolters said. "We came out a
little slow, but on the big points K.J.
seemed to always put the return
right where we needed it, and I had
my best first serves. That turned out
to he our closest match of the tour
nament. maybe it was good for us to
toughen us up for later rounds."
After their victory over the Illi
nois team. Wolters and Hippensteel
were faced with the tournament's
No. 3 seed, Jean-Noell Grinda and
Ming Lee from UCLA. The Grin
da/Lee duo had also defeated
Wolters and Hippensteel earlier in
the season during dual match play.
But this time the Cardinal duo came
out on fire and did not lose serve
once during their 6-2, 6-1 victory. In
this match, the Cardinal team really
started to get things rolling.
"I think our second-round
UCLA match was the start of our
run." Hippensteel said. "It was after
this win when we decided we were as
good as anyone left in the tourna
ment and our confidence level went
way up."
In the quarterfinals, Wolters and
Hippensteel defeated Ed Carter and
Jeff Williams of Arizona State, 6-2.
7-5. They got off to an exceptional
start, putting them in control right
away. They were down 5-3 in the sec
ond set before winning the final four
games and the match. It was in this
second set that they lost serve for the
last time in the entire tournament.
"Getting off to that fast start in
the Arizona State match really set a
trend lor the remainder of the tour
nament." Wolters said. "When you
get ahead early, it takes a lot of pres
sure off. I had played two singles

matches earlier in the day, so it
would have been difficult to go a
third set in this match. We pulled
through and won the final four
games, though."
It was in their semifinal match
against No. 1 seed Lief Meineke and
Lesslie Moodie of Boise State that
Wolters and Hippensteel played
their best tennis of the tournament.
They won the match 6-2,6-1 and had
every single aspect of their game
clicking. According to Whitlinger, it
was the best performance of doubles
all year long.
"This was a pretty match to
watch," said Whitlinger. "It was the
best overall match from start to fin
ish. I have seen the two of them play.
Everything was gelling and click
ing."
Wolters and Hippensteel took
that momentum into their final
match against Nenod Toroman and
Gareth Williams of Florida. They
won the match 6-3,6-2, again not los
ing serve and returning exceptional
ly well.
"To be honest, I am pretty sur
prised we were able to put an entire
week of solid doubles together,"
Wolters said. "All season long we
have shown moments where we show
our potential, but those moments
have not been as consistent as we
would have liked. This week we final
ly put it all together in consecutive
matches and played the kind of dou
bles we knew we were capable of."
Wolters' title was perhaps even
more impressive considering he was
in the singles side of the draw and
was often forced to play three
matches a day. In singles. Wolters
had a solid tournament before being
ousted in the semifinals by s Blake,
2-6,6-2,6-1. Wolters got off to an ex
tremely fast start in the first set by
playing aggressively. According to
Whitlinger, he continued to be of
fensive minded in the second and
third sets, but seemed to miss a lot of
shots within inches of the line.
"I was happy with the way I

played in singles," Wolters said.
"Against Blake. I just went up
against a player who was a little bet
ter on that day. He deserved to make
it to the finals. I was disappointed.

but I knew 1 had to immediately get
focused again mentally for the final
two rounds of doubles. 1 ended up
finishing my college career in a posi
tive way. The title meant a lot to K.J.

and myself."
