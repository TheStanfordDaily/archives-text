## Twelve things I learned at Stanford 
### 
The lirst night I ever spent on
campus was pretty traumat
ic. It had absolutely nothing
to do with being away from home. It
stemmed from the fact that the
seven boxes I had sent out to school
were lost at the Stanford post office
(where they find it mandatory to
keep every item for at least three
days, more if it is really urgent or
heaven-forbid marked "priority").
As a result. I was forced to spend
mv first night with just a borrowed
sheet. Unfortunately, it is really
hard to get comfortable when you
are rolled up in a single sheet, shiv
ering, trying to cling to a green.
Teflon-coated mattress. It wasn't
until later that my sister gave me a
worthwhile piece of advice: never
use the post office to ship anything.
Four years here have not found me
a job or probably even made all that
much smarter, but one thing 1 have
gathered is a lot of advice.
My high school jazz band direc

tor was well aware of my propensity
to play the wrong notes at the right
time as I was learning to play the
trombone. But instead of telling me
to "fake it."he told me to play
"strong and wrong." And he's right.
II you look like you know what you
are doing, and you act like you
know what you are doing, people
usually think you do know what you
are doing. I figure that is probably
how half the senior class managed
to graduate.
In m\ yearbook the same band
director also told me to. "Learn
how to weld." He said that the
world will always need welders and
that 1 really shouldn't bank too
much on the trombone gig. I guess
it's always good to have a mar
ketable skill.
"High school heroes, real life
zeros." That's a friends way of
pointing out that there is no reason
to worry about those people who
seem to have it all together in their

little protected sphere. They will be
the ones left reliving their glory
days instead of living them. My
friend Lisa once noted, "Joan of
Arc was burnt at the stake at 19.
That means at 14 she left her peas
ant village and then led her nearly
unbeatable army between the ages
of 15-1N! I feel like an underachiev
er at 20!" No matter what you do,
someone is always doing a little
more. Admire and be inspired by
those people. All of us have some
thing great within if we are willing
to sacrifice some amount of comfort
to find it.
The best academic advice 1 ever
received at Stanford was, "Ques
tion why you do everything you do,
and if you aren't learning from it or
having fun, don't do it." Learning
can happen anywhere and you can
justify playing with LSJIJMB as a
good use of time as long as you are
enjoying it. Evaluate everything
vou do. If vou ever net stuck in a

place where you are not learning or
having fun. it is time to learn how to
weld.
The best social advice 1 ever re
ceived at Stanford was, "Don't sweat
the petty and don't pet the sweaty."
Always a good one to remember and
takes very little explanation. Don't
worry about little things. Avoid
sketchy men at fi at parties.
As a freshman 1 was always ago
nizing over the small things. I re
member the day that I let my neigh
bor Carolyn cut my hair. Her
overzealous chopping left my hair
six inches shorter than I wanted it.
As she gave me the mirror she said,
"Hair. It grows." So true, so true.
Most things have a way of fixing
themselves. And even if they don't,
in the words of my advisor. "Never
apologize." When you have done
the best you can there really is noth
ing more you can do.
When I was struggling with the
decision of whether to studv music

or law my best friend said. "There
are many things in life that will
catch your eye, but only a few that
will catch your heart — pursue
those." And she is right. All the
money and status in the world won't
matter if you give up your dreams.
Maybe you'll never be famous, and
maybe you'll never be rich, but if
you're happy, what does it matter?
One of the least wealthy, least fa
mous people I have known was an
old philosophy teacher of mine. He
lived to teach and the year he
stopped teaching he died. He once
said, "People are weird. They think
that everybody has this fixed quan
tity of love inside themselves. And
they think that people can't love
more than one person, because they
are afraid that all the love will have
been used up on the first person."
People love, that is just the way we
are. But people also leave, and peo
ple change and people die. And if
you live in fear of the consequences,

afraid to love, you're not really
alive. Never close yourself off from
love. Never find yourself living
alone in a crowd, surrounded by
people, but touched by no one.
Lastly. "Accept and move on."
That is some of the most sound,
least followed advice in the world,
and it was my sister who gave it to
me. People need to learn to accept
their lives a little more. Bad things
happen, even to good people. And
sometimes good things happen to
bad people. That's the way it goes.
The sooner you are able to accept
the randomness of some of life and
the decisions you have made about
the rest, the sooner you are free to
move forward. And moving for
ward is what it is all about.
