## Fours years of (nearly) epic proportions 
### 
I would like to say that my four years here have been
made of the stuff of which epics are made. Friends
have been loved and lost. Police were dodged after
steam tunneling through Meyer Library. Sleep was
forsaken for 36 hours during The Game. I've traveled
and seen cities that made New York look like Palo
Alto. But to describe these things as "epic" would be
too ambitious. After all, it would underestimate the
magnitude of the adventures that still lay before me.
Now, as the last hours lade in the twilight of my un
dergraduate years. I know that I will leave with the
confidence in the decisions that I have made and the
humility of failures I have endured. My future will be
determined by a strange mix of fate and self-determi
nation â€” something very similar to the forces that
brought me to Stanford and molded mv experience
here.
I cried out of happiness for the first time when I

opened Stanford's admission letter in April 1995.
Maybe this means I should have gotten out more as a
high school student, but that letter validated all of my
hard work and late nights. The first time I cried out of
total despair was my freshman year of college, after
Francesca Beard had passed away. The spirit of Rin
conada was uprooted, to say the least. But in the fol
lowing weeks, I saw the most beautiful expression of
compassion as the dorm coped with the death of one of
our friends. I will never forget the free hugs and tears.
Helping Frankie's parents move out her things. Then
redecorating her half of the double with stuffed ani
mals, posters, and plants donated from the rest of the
dorm so her roommate wouldn't feel the stale empti
ness of the concrete walls as much.
Strange circumstances involving a Draw number of
76 brought me to Synergy the following year, where I
happened to make several friends who were either

graduating or stopping out the next year. Determined
not to be left behind, I decided to study overseas. Of
course, it was May and most of the deadlines had
passed. But I came across one that could bring me to
Hong Kong. A few months later. I was strolling down
a Cantonese street eating freshly cooked siu mai. And
the unexpected story line continued, bringing me into
the stairways of the Political Science department and
the folds of a commencement gown.
This unfolding of events is definitely not shocking.
But it is pleasant to see that these adventures hap
pened almost of their own accord. Perhaps the most
important thing I've learned in my years here is that
planning just doesn't get you very far. Adventures
have their own way of manifesting themselves. Other
events can turn everything upside down.
1 don't know what's in store for me after graduation.
The emptiness of the road before me has often made

me want to plan in order to find some sense of stabili
ty. To reach out to some mirage of grandness possible
with only a bachelor's degree. But aspirations for
grandeur become addictive and only create a hotbed
for disappointment.
I am grounded now, despite the imminent pomp
and circumstance.
And I leave Stanford with no plans but only the con
fidence in the decisions I have made in the past - and
the adventures that I will have in the future.

iherese Lee, a senior graduating in political science,
hopes tluit she will have several adventures (with decent
salaries) to choose from in the near fatare. She would
also like to thank her family very much; they are her
source of confidence and humility.
