# FOUR YEARS IN THE LIFE OF STANFORD SENIORS
## 9798 
### 
•SEPTEMBER
Two hundred fifty members of
the media barraged the University
as the presidential family brought
its only daughter to campus. It was
President Clinton's first appear
ance at Stanford.
I he ( lass of 2001 had an experi
ence like no other, having to pass
through metal detectors and wear
special badges to see University
President Gerhard Casper's Con
vocation.
•OCTOBER
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawis
lak filed her first grievance protest
ing her tenure denial at the deans'
level in the School of Humanities
and Sciences. The History Depart
ment had voted nearly unanimous
ly to tenure Sawislak. a specialist in
American labor history.
Business Prof. Emeritus Myron
Scholes was awarded the 1997
Nobel Memorial Prize in Econom
ic Sciences for his role in the devel
opment of a widely applied pricing
formula for options.
Physics and Applied Physics
Prof. Steve Chu raised the number
of this year's winners to two when
he won the Nobel Prize in Physics.
This was Stanford's third physics
Nobel Prize in three years. Chu
won it for devising a method for
trapping and cooling atoms that al
lows them to be studied more close
ly-
"l'm really not a great physi
cist," Chu said. "I'm the same guy I
was yesterday."
In his annual State of the Uni
versity address, Casper introduced
his new Presidential Lectures and
Symposia in the Humanities and
Arts, which brought artists Christo
and Jeanne-Claude and critic
Harold Bloom to campus, among
others. He also announced a $12-
million initiative to add four new
professorships in the humanities
and arts.

•NOVEMBER
Stanford emerged victorious in the
Sand Hill Road battle when voters
on November 4 approved its Mea
sure O, giving it permission to ex
pand Sand Hill and Quarry Roads
to four lanes within Palo Alto city
limits and extend them both to El
Camino Real.
The University will now spend
$342 million over five years to im
plement its plan, which includes
building 1,100 units of housing for
senior citizens, faculty and staff
along Sand Hill.
It also has plans for expanding
the Stanford Shopping Center by
80,000 square feet.
A hallmark of the Big Game
since its inception in the early
19(M)s, the Lake Lagunita bonfire
was given the ax this fall for the
fifth straight year.
The cancellation came on the
heels of a recent study that con
cluded there was no way to contin
ue the tradition without harming
the tiger salamander, an endan
gered species that lives in the lake
bed.
The 100 th Big Game had to set
tle for a 4-cubic foot version in Ar
rillaga Amphitheater.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal foot
ball team defeated UC-Berkeley
by a narrow margin of 21-20, snap
ping a five-game losing streak be
fore a sellout crowd of 85,(HX) at
Stanford Stadium.
•DECEMBER
Housing applications were
made available to all unhoused
Greek organizations, including
sororities, who have not been
housed since 1944.
•JANUARY
Provost Condoleezza Rice an
nounced that Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven would
be stepping down from his position
in the spring. Shoven said he will
return to teaching and research
upon completion of his five-year

term as dean.
•FEBRUARY
El Nino left the campus reeling,
flooding streets and University
buildings. The Row became a
water park as students rafted down
Campus Drive on mattresses and
rolled down slippery slopes in
garbage cans.
Classes and midterms were can
celed as students, faculty and ad
ministrators fought to recover from
the water damage.
Green Library, Jonsson Library
of Government Documents, Cub
berley Auditorium and Braun
Music Center were submerged in
up to 2 feet of water.
Hundreds of student volunteers
showed up in the middle of the
night to help in the Green Library
rescue efforts. By 11:30 a.m.. a total
of 3,000 boxes of materials had
been moved to higher ground.
"It was very gratifying to see: the
University was in a time of need ...
and students rallied to help," said
Dean of Student Affairs Marc
Wais.
However, the flooding still dam
aged 12(),(HK) books from Green —
most of which have been saved
using a freeze-drying process —
and 1().(H)() recordings at the Braun
Archive of Recorded Sound.
•MARCH
Residential Education Director
Jane Camarillo announced that the
Delta Delta Delta and Kappa
Alpha Theta sororities would be
housed in ATO and Alpha Sigma,
respectively.
This was a marked victory for
those who had fought for the return
of sorority housing after 56 years.
However, it was a significant loss
for those in the Alpha Sig commu
nity, and a huge uproar immediate
ly followed. Protests and petitions
were filed, charging that the admin
istration had not done enough to
solicit student input in deciding

which houses would go to sorori
ties.
•APRIL
After both Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven and
Provost Rice declined to reverse
the decision on Sawislak's appeals,
she filed another one to President
Casper and the Advisory Board of
the Academic Council for a final
review of her case in April.
"I have no doubt that she should
have gotten tenure," said History
Prof. George Fredrickson. "She
has a very strong case."
Her tenure denials and rejected
appeals spurred student mobiliza
tion across campus, and more than
KK) protesters marched in White
Plaza to protest the lack of faculty
diversity on campus.
A bittersweet farewell was bid

to Alpha Sig's last Exotic Erotic
Ball, where hundreds of scantily
clad partygoers went to experience
the debauchery honored in Rolling
Stone magazine as one of the top
college parties in the nation.
•MAY
The Anthropology Depart
ment's application to the Provost's
Office to split into two departments
was approved.
The issue of dividing into cultur
al and social anthropology and an
thropological sciences was sched
uled to go before the Board of
Trustees in June.
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion Board of Directors voted
unanimously to become part of the
University. The merger will be put
to a final vote by the association's
72.000 members this summer.
More than 800 graduate stu

dents were left unhoused after the
spring housing lottery. More than
1.000 attended a rally for housing
less than a week later, calling for
several University policy changes,
including more flexible move-in
and move-out dates and buying
more off-campus property.
•JUNK
Gwendolyn Dean was chosen to
fill the half-time directorship posi
tion at the I esbian. (iay and Hisex
ual Community ( enter.
Physicist Malcolm Beasley was
announced the new dean of hu
manities and sciences. He previ
ously was the Theodore and Syd
ney Rosenberg Professor of Ap
plied Physics and. by courtesy, a
professor of electrical engineering.
Psychology Prof. Ellen Markman
became the new associate dean for
the social sciences.
