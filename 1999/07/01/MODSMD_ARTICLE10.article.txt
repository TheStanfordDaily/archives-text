Campus authorities and the Stan
ford Police Department are continu
ing their investigation of an e-mail
message containing racial epithets
sent to thousands of computer ac
counts on campus.
The message, sent May 29, ap
peared to have been sent from the
Leland account of Prisdha Dharma,
a doctoral student in the EESOR de
partment. It was later determined
that his password had been stolen
and that the message was sent in his
name.
In a statement to the Stanford
Report on June 16, Stanford Police
Lieutenant Del Bandy said. "At
least two accounts were violated."
Bandy indicated that California
computer crime charges would apply
along with any actions taken by the
University.
Campus computer security per

sonnel are continuing their investi
gation. according to David Brumley,
a systems developer at Stanford
Computing and Communication
Services.
"Stanford was originally consid
ering getting help from the FBI be
cause it's easier for them to get sub
poenas and search warrants, but
they're not planning on involving the
FBI at this time," Brumley said.
"The reason is.. .because much of
the information the FBI could get
[would he for the FBI only and]
could not just be given to Stanford."
On the other hand, local police
would be able to turn over most of
the information they obtain to Stan
lord.
University administrators re
sponded quickly after the e-mail was
distributed.
Dean of Students Marc Wais stat
ed that he"was outraged and imme
diately saddened."
University President Gerhard

Casper sent a message to all 30.000
Leland e-mail accounts saying that
'â€¢[The University] will use all the
means available to us to take the ap
propriate action."
ASSU President Mike Levin and
Vice-President John Mills said that
computer security personnel are
doing everything they can and were
optimistic that the guilty party would
he identified.
"I am confident that the perpetra
tor will he caught soon, and that the
University's response will be swift
and appropriate." Levin said.
Following the incident. Dharma
set up an auto-responder on his e
mail account, ostensibly as a re
sponse to the flood of e-mails from
offended parties who thought he had
sent the message.
Dharma said previously that he
would very much like to "reaffirm
that [he | did not hold any such views
as expressed in [that] offensive e
mail.
