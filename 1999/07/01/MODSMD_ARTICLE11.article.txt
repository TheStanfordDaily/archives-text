## Friends remember Fletcher's accomplishments 
### Elizabeth Khuri-Yakub Contributing writer 
"She was a great friend, always
there when you needed her, really
competent and caring," remarked
Kathy Eisenhart, professor of
Strategy and Organization in the
School of Engineering.
Ann Fletcher, Stanford's Asso
ciate Provost and friend to many,
died of cancer on June 2. She was
51.
A 23-year employee of the Uni
versity, Fletcher began working at
Stanford as the International Grad
uate Admissions coordinator in the
graduate admissions office in 1976.
In 1985 she became dean of
graduate studies and in 1992 she be
came staff associate for faculty af
fairs. Fletcher became assistant
provost in 1994 and associate
provost in 1995.
As the associate provost, she
worked closely with Provost Con
doleezza Rice in administrative
areas such as faculty affairs, advis
ing, student housing and faculty
student matters. She was also an ac
tive member of several University
task forces.
Prior to her years at Stanford,
Fletcher worked at Operation
Crossroads Africa, an organization
that promotes intense cross-cultur
al training that takes place in New

York City and Africa, and the Insti
tute for International Education in
New York City.
"Ann was a very professional,
principled person who spoke her
mind, was utterly reliable, and all of
this in a warm, low-key manner,"
said University President Gerhard
Casper.
Fletcher was also a prolific
writer and wrote a number of
books, among them, "Belgium, A
Study of the Educational System of
Belgium and a Guide to the Acade
mic Placement of Students in Edu
cational Institutions of the United
States" and "Education in Israel."
These works reflected her back
ground in international relations
and political science.
Vice Provost of Faculty Rela
tions Robert Weisberg recalled
many of the important contribu
tions Fletcher made to the Univer
sity.
"Because of her sharp analytical
mind, her deep human judgment
and understanding and her im
mense knowledge of Stanford, Ann
was assigned some of the knottiest
problems in the University," said
Weisberg.
"And because of those qualities,
she solved them superlatively. In
my administrative work, not only
could I rely on her â€” I always
learned from her."

Former Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ramon Saldi
var spoke about his professional ex
perience with Fletcher.
"One of my first tasks as Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion was to head a task force to
study and make recommendations
for the improvement of Advising
for Undergraduate Students at
Stanford. Ann was a tireless partic
ipant in the work of the task force
and vital to its efforts.
"The fact that advising is today
much improved at Stanford is a tes
tament to the caring work that Ann
put into the effort. She genuinely
cared about the students and
worked to make sure that we were
always thinking of their needs first.
1 will always remember fondly
Ann's gracious good cheer and
dedication to the efforts to improve
advising," Saldfvar said.
Rice echoed Saldfvars senti
ments.
"Ann was an extremely impor
tant part of the Stanford communi
ty. People often turned to Ann be
cause she was such a wonderful
problem solver. She was a warm
and caring person."
Fletcher is survived by her hus
band Joe Fletcher, daughter Lind
say, son Evan, her parents Bill and
Mary Schrenker, and her sister
Janet Bender.
