# Gingrich joins Hoover Institution
## 
### Joanne Wu Editorial staff 
Former Speaker of the House of
Representatives Newt Gingrich
joined the ranks of Republican
elites in early June, when he was ap
pointed as a Hoover Institution
Distinguished Visiting Fellow.
As a Hoover Fellow. Gingrich
will concentrate on the areas of
technology, society and public poli
cy â€” interests he pursued during
his 22-year career as a congress
man.
Gingrich reacted with excite
ment to the position. "I am delight
ed to join the fellows at the Hoover
Institution." he said. "Hoover is
home to some of the most brilliant
minds in the world today, and is
playing an important role in shap
ing our future. I look forward to ex
ploring the innovation of Silicon
Valley, and relating its successes to
the direction public policy should

take in the information age."
Hoover Director John Raisian
explained the selection of Gingrich
as a fellow: "[Gingrich] is a superb
generator of ideas and vision relat
ing to the well-being of our society.
The Institution's theme of 'Ideas
Defining a Free Society' coincides
with [Gingrich's] talents and inter
ests."
"His specific interest of looking
at technology in our locale is also a
terrific fit as we engage one anoth
er. [Gingrich] is a leading figure in
the United States, and we are de
lighted to have him join as a col
league." Raisian added.
GOP consultant Dan Schnur
noted benefits to both Gingrich and
the Hoover Institution that arise
from Gingrich's new position. In a
previous statement. Schnur said.
"It's a great move both for Gingrich
and for Hoover. Hoover gets prob
ably the most recognizable conserv
ative spokesman in the country.

and Gingrich gets what's certainly
the most respected conservative
platform in the country to speak
from."
Gingrich's press secretary, Mike
Shields, discussed Gingrich's accep
tance of the fellowship: "Hoover is a
very esteemed, conservative and
richly traditioned institution. . .it is
an institution on the rise, and cap
tures the imagination of a lot of peo
ple. Another advantage is that it is
located in Silicon Valley, where our
future is being formed. It is a very
exciting environment for Gingrich
to think, learn and teach policy."
"From the capitalists and entre
preneurs of the area, he hopes to
learn about the kinds of obstacles
they must overcome and how new
structures for interaction between
people are created," Shields added.
"He can learn a lot of lessons
here and take these lessons of the
information age from the technolo
gy area and apply them to the gov
ernment."
Shields explained the link be
tween the areas of technology and
bureaucracy: "Looking at the Inter
net, you see that it is very stream
lined and decentralized, giving
everyone the same amount of
power and giving them a connec
tion to each other," he said. "This is
antithetical to the conditions in
Washington, where there is a very
centralized command structure.
We should learn to move in the di
rection of the information age and
decentralize."
For most of the year, Gingrich
will probably work from Georgia
and Washington D.C., but he will
come to at least Stanford six to
eight times a year.
Richard Sousa, a Hoover associ
ate director, explained Gingrich's
new role.
"He will be doing a number of
things. He'll be meeting with other
fellows, meeting with people in Sil
icon Valley, writing, studying,
learning more and offering his in
sights on technology and communi
cations."
As part of his work, Gingrich
will be collaborating with the
Hoover Institution's 60 resident fel
lows, including George Shultz, sec
retary of state in the Reagan and
Bush administrations, economist
and Nobel Prize winner Milton
Friedman, nuclear physicist Ed
ward Teller, who helped develop
the atomic and hydrogen bombs,
former California Governor Pete
Wilson and former U.S. Attorney
General Edwin Meese.
