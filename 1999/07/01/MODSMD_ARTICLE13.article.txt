# New structure honors Packard
## SEQ building named 
### Jill Singer 
Before David Packard, co
founder of the Silicon Valley-based
computer enterprise Hewlett-
Packard Co., died in March 19%. he
made it abundantly clear that he did
not want any structures or streets
named after him. He epitomized
modesty and humility and eschewed
ostentation and boasting, and his
wish to remain "anonymous" was
honored by his family — until now.
The Packard family has made an
exception to Packard's "rule," and
as a result, Stanford's electrical engi
neering building in the new Science
and Engineering Quad will bear
David Packard's name.
The Board of Trustees approved
the decision on June 11 and Electri
cal Engineering Department Chair
man James Plummer made the an
nouncement at the Department's
commencement ceremony.
The reason behind the family's
decision to make this exception re
mains unclear. The University said
that the Packards are "a very private
family."
"The family's natural tendency
would be to honor [Packard's] wish
es, but I think they would make an
exception just because of his close
connection with the University,"
Plummer speculates.
Packard and his friend William
Hewlett started Hewlett-Packard
Co. in 1938 in a garage. They gradu
ated from Stanford the following
year. From that time, the partners
exhibited an immense capacity for
philanthropy, donating over $300
million total between the two over
the years.
Packard donated $77.4 million
alone in 1994 toward the completion

of the Science and Engineering
Quad, which explained why the de
partment's decision to honor
Packard with the new building was
nearly unanimous.
Dave Glenn, associate vice presi
dent for development, said that the
faculty and staff agreed wholeheart
edly that the building should be
named after Packard.
"Since David Packard was so im
portant to the School of Engineer
ing, it seemed perfectly fitting that
something within the sphere of engi
neering be named after him." Glenn
said.
"Since Hewlett and Packard
made the ultimate gift that made the
SEQ possible, it seemed appropri
ate to name a key part of it after Mr.
Packard." Glenn added.
As a Stanford graduate, Packard
remained closely tied to the Univer
sity and his generosity helped trans
form Stanford into the world-class
research institution it is today. But as
a child of the Depression, sources
say he valued hard work and he
seems to have shunned excessive
recognition for the work that he
loved.
Buildings on campus funded by
Packard bear the names of his men
tor, engineering Prof. Fred Terman
and Packard's wife, for whom he
founded the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital after her death
in 1987.
The steel and glass Packard
building will feature a new cafe and
a set of displays detailing the history
of the electrical engineering depart
ment and its relation to the rise of
the Silicon Valley.
The new building will be fully
completed in the fall, according to
the schedule.
