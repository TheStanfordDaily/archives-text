## Soccer world converges on U.S. for World Cup 
### Emil Dizon 
Although soccer in the United
States may not have the presence it
does in other nations, this year's
FIFA Women's World Cup serves as
a reminder that it is emerging in pop
ularity in America.
When the United States hosted
the men's World Cup in 1994, Amer
ican awareness of soccer rose, espe
cially with a United States team that
defeated powerhouse Columbia in
the first round and lost to Brazil in a
close second round match on Inde
pendence Day at Stanford Stadium.
Since then, the United States Soc
cer Federation has pushed to capital
ize on the newfound popularity of
"the beautiful game."
With the creation of Major League
Soccer, the United States now has a
professional league that heightens
visibility of the sport in America. Pro
fessional stars from around the world,
as well as American stars, play in the
twelve-team league.
Capping off the run of soccer to
popularity was the U.S. men's team
qualification for the 1998 World Cup
in France. Now that the team estab
lished itself as one of the top teams in
the CONCACAF zone, the U.S.
looked ready to make the second
round again.
But all hopes then dashed away as
three first round losses resulted in a
last place finish among the qualifiers
and an early flight home.
The magic of 1994 rises again this
year, as the 16 best women's national
teams come to America to compete
for soccer's ultimate prize, and so far,
the public has welcomed the soccer
world with open arms.
Over 560,000 tickets have been
sold for the entire tournament. Al
though the only sell-outs of the com
petition have been at U.S. games,
many other teams have marveled at
the numbers of spectators at their
games, which have averaged more
than 30,000 per session.
"I compliment the US and its peo
ple for the fantastic atmosphere," said
Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo
after his team's match against Japan
at Soldier Field.
"It was great to play here at Sol
dier Field. I give all my best to the
American fans and the organizers of
this event."
Although the Women's World
Cup has only been played twice be
fore. many see this year's tournament
as a way of presenting women's soc
cer to the world.
"This tournament demonstrates
that women can play at the interna
tional level," said Carrie Tavlor, 26,

who played soccer for Michigan in
college and now lives in Cincinnati, to
ESPN.com. "I'm hoping this will
translate into a women's professional
league."
"The World Cup is good for the
sport," Everett Hay, 37, told
ESPN.com at last Sunday's first
round session at Foxboro Stadium.
"It's going to get the women involved,
and that's good, because there are

a lot of countries where women
don't play soccer."
Women's involvement in
sports stands to reap a hefty
reward from this year's World

Cup. Over the past few years,
women's sports have emerged in
America with the birth of the
Women's National Basketball Asso-

ciation, as well as record attendance
numbers at NCAA women's nation
al championship events.

The World Cup's visit to the Bay
Area could not come at a better time.
The San Jose Sports Authority de
clared 1999 a celebration of

women's sports. In addi
tion to hosting the World
Cup competition. Spar
tan Stadium in San Jose

also served as site of the
World Cup draw and the '
U.S.-International All-Star ex
hibition match last February.

Spartan Stadium will also host the
1999 NCAA Women's College Cup
soccer tournament, bringing the best
collegiate women's teams to San Jose
to contend for the national champi
onship.
SJSA estimates that the local
economy will receive an influx of over
$55 million from these well known

events. In addition, the
SJSA hopes that this

year's events will reinforce the posi
tive messages associated with
women's sports.
The World Cup has won over
many supporters over the past three
weeks and looks to take that success
to Pasadena following this week's
semifinal matches. The tournament's
official theme, "This is my game. This
is my future. Watch me play," has
come to represent much of what the
fans think of the tournament.
