Stanford welcomes the world, again.
The 1999 FIFA Women's World
Cup has once again put the United
States at the center of the soccer world.
The field of sixteen teams that arrived
in America a few weeks earlier has now
trimmed to eight, all vying for spots in
the final games at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena.
Like the Fourth of July five years
ago, this national holiday will once
again feature an elimination game with
the United States, likely to battle Brazil
on Foster Field at Stanford Stadium.
Only this time, it's the women who will
be playing instead of the men.
Excitement runs rampant amongst
fans of both teams. The United States,
whose games have accounted for the
only capacity crowds in the tourna
ment, has stormed through the first and
second rounds.
In order to reach this matchup at
Stanford stadium, the U.S, winners of
group A must defeat Germany (1-1-1)
in its quarterfinal match.
The Germans have had strong fin
ishes in the last two World Cups (2nd
in 1995, 3rd in 1991) and were just sec
onds away from winning group B when
Maicon of Brazil scored in stoppage
time of the second half to earn both
teams a draw.
"They are dangerous on counters,
very efficient in the back, and they have
clearly tried to model their program
after the one used by the U.S," said U.S.
Assistant Coach Lauren Gregg.
"I think our team is strong that on a
good day we can beat any other team,
including the USA, and I hope we show
well on Thursday," said German coach
Tina Thuene-Meyer after the match
against Brazil.
Yet the Germans will have to play
the rest of the World Cup without their
captain, Martina Voss. The midfielder
missed the first two games of the tour
nament and saw little time in the game
against Brazil.
German forward Inka Grings is cur
rently tied for third in scoring with three
goals. She also leads the tournament in
shots on goal with 15.
For the United States, tied for the
lead in goals scored with Norway (13),
three players, Mia Hamm, Kristine
Lilly and Tiffeny Milbrett, are all tied
for sixth in scoring as well.
The scoring attack is paced by veter
ans like Hamm, the all-time career goal
scoring leader in international play,
Lilly, Julie Foudy and Michelle Akers.
all of whom have recorded countless
caps with the national team.
