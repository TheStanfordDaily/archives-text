# Stanford to host Independence Day Battle
## 
### 
Not only does the United States
have the firepower to plunge through
the tournament, Briana Scurry, the
U.S. goalkeeper, leads the tournament
with 33 goals against average.
Giving the United States an extra
edge are the fans who have supported
the team in record numbers throughout
their campaign. Their opening game
against Denmark at Giants Stadium in
New Jersey attracted 78,972 spectators,
the largest crowd to attend a sporting
event in the stadium's history.
"These crowds have been very im
pressive to us," said U.S. coach Tony
DiCiccio before the first round game
against Nigeria in Chicago, which also
sold out at 65,080 fans. "This event is re
ally catching on in the mainstream of
America."

The U.S. fans have much to cheer
about. After winning the 1996
Olympics and the 1997 and 1998 U.S.
Cups, the United States came into the
tournament as a favorite to hoist the
Cup at the Rose Bowl and so far have
not showed any signs of slowing down.
"It is such a great feeling, especially
knowing that our fans are going to be
there," said U.S. defender Carla Over
beck before the game against Den
mark. "They are constantly cheer
ing, they know your name, and that is
extremely uplifting as a player, just
knowing that you have 80,000 people
backing you and wanting you to win. "
Brazil, on the other hand, has begun
to stake its claim to be just as strong as
the men's team of their soccer-crazy
homeland, which won the World Cup

in 1994 and finished second in 1998.
After a strong fourth place finish at
the 1996 Olympics, the Brazilians
stormed through qualification, winning
the 1998 South American Champi
onship and finishing second at the 1998
U.S. Cup.
These two teams last met in the 1998
U.S. Women's Cup, where the U.S. de
feated Brazil 3-0 to win the tournament
for a fifth consecutive year.
Six of the top 15 scorers in the tour
nament would play in a USA-Brazil
game. Brazil's Sissi leads all scorers
with 6 goals, while her teammate Pret
inha is tied for third with 3 goals.
Also among the top scorers for
Brazil is Katia Da Silva, who is tied for
sixth with two goals.
The Brazilians won Group B after

earning a draw against Germany June
27 at Soldier Field in Chicago. With
the Germans leading 3-2 in stoppage
time of the second half, Maicon of
Brazil found herself in front of a loose
ball in the German penalty box that re
bounded off two players' heads. She
blasted the ball into the goal with a
powerful strike that assured Brazil of
first place.
"We were patient and lucky enough
to keep our heads together and get a
score at the end," said Brazil coach Wil
son DeOlivera, after the game against
Germany.
"In Brazil, there's a saying that God
is Brazilian. This proves it once more."
"Certainly the dark horse of the
1999 World Cup," said U.S. assistant
coach Lauren Gregg of the Brazilian
squad to ESPN.com. "They show the
flair and style of the men's team."
Like the Americans, the Brazilians
have been overwhelmed by the fan sup
port of this year's World Cup.
"It was a bit of a shock to play in the
packed stadium," Sissi told ESPN.com
after Brazil defeated Mexico in the first
round in New Jersey. "But it was shock
in a good way. The large crowd was
very helpful to us."
"The most people my players have
ever seen is between 15-18,(X)0." DeO
livera told ESPN.com. "Usually, we
play in front of only one thousand or
two thousand people."
Brazil takes on Nigeria in the quar
terfinals, second place finishers in
group A behind the United Staes.
As the winners of the 1998 African
Women's Championship, the Nigeri
ans posted a 2-1 record in the first
round of the World Cup. defeating
North Korea and Denmark.
Although they suffered a 7-1 loss to
the United States in their second game,
the Nigerians have plunged into the
quarterfinals for the first time in tour
nament history and hope to make an
impact upon the field.
"I know victory shall be ours," for
ward Mercy Akide, who leads her team
with two goals in the competition, told
ESPN.com.
The Nigerians present a challenge to
any opponent with their style of play
which could be described as a combina
tion between the Bad Boys era of De
troit Pistons basketball and the run and
gun style of a WAC football game.
Currently, the Nigerians lead the
tournament in fouls committed (75),
and offside calls (17).
"They're very athletic, very physical
and very combative," said U.S. assis
tant coach Lauren Gregg to espn.com.
"They can produce competi

tive results and you have to be on your
toes because of their attacking flair.
They might not be as organized as other
teams, but they have some great ath
letes."
World-class soccer is no stranger to
Stanford Stadium. In 1984, the Stadiurti
served as one of the soccer venues for
the Summer Olympics. In 1994, the Sta
dium was once again employed for soc
cer use as a venue in the men's World
Cup.
At a capacity of 86,(XX), Stanford
Stadium is the largest privately owned
facility for American football.
In addition to serving as the home of
Stanford University football, the Stadi
um also hosts the annual East-West
Shrine Game, brining some of the na
tion's best football players together in
an all-star game benefiting Shriners
Hospitals for crippled children.
The July 4th game will be followed
by a Major League Soccer game be
tween D.C. United and the San Jose
Clash.
The other semifinal is likely to pit
Norway against China at Foxboro Sta
dium in Massachusetts.
China, who came into the World
Cup as the number one seed, is second
in the tournament in goals scored. With
second place finishes at the 1996
Olympics and the 1998 Goodwill
Games, the Chinese are strong con
tenders for the cup, especially after de
feating the United States in two out of
their three meetings this year before
the World Cup.
They boast the second and sixth
highest scorers in the competition in
Sun Wen (5 goals) and Yan Jin (2
goals), as well as one of the top goal
keepers in Hong Gao (.67 GAA).
"For me, this competition is differ
ent from my first two (World Cups)."
said Sun Wen before China's first game
against Sweden, "and I believe that this
is the climax of my career in soccer."
Norway should also prove to be a
worthy team. After winning the 1995
World Cup. the Norwegians won the
bronze medal at the 19% Olympics.
"I want people to see in our team
that we have a lot of good individual
players," said Norway coach Per-Math
ias Hogmo. "We beat a lot of spectacu
lar teams on the field. We play attrac
tive, attacking football."
"We are playing very well right
now," said Norway Midfielder Unni
Lchn. "It is fun to play, and we are
pulling together as a team."
After edging out Russia, the Norwe
gians trounced both Canada and Japan
by a combined score of 11-1 to advance
to the quarterfinals.

event in the stadium's history.
"These crowds have been very im
pressive to us," said U.S. coach Tony
DiCiccio before the first round game
against Nigeria in Chicago, which also
sold out at 65,080 fans. "This event is re
ally catching on in the mainstream of
America."

The U.S. fans have much to cheer
about. After winning the 1996
Olympics and the 1997 and 1998 U.S.
Cups, the United States came into the
tournament as a favorite to hoist the
Cup at the Rose Bowl and so far have
not showed any signs of slowing down.
"It is such a great feeling, especially
knowing that our fans are going to be
there," said U.S. defender Carla Over
beck before the game against Den
mark. "They are constantly cheer
ing, they know your name, and that is
extremely uplifting as a player, just
knowing that you have 80,000 people
backing you and wanting you to win. "
Brazil, on the other hand, has begun
to stake its claim to be just as strong as
the men's team of their soccer-crazy
homeland, which won the World Cup

in 1994 and finished second in 1998.
After a strong fourth place finish at
the 1996 Olympics, the Brazilians
stormed through qualification, winning
the 1998 South American Champi
onship and finishing second at the 1998
U.S. Cup.
These two teams last met in the 1998
U.S. Women's Cup, where the U.S. de
feated Brazil 3-0 to win the tournament
for a fifth consecutive year.
Six of the top 15 scorers in the tour
nament would play in a USA-Brazil
game. Brazil's Sissi leads all scorers
with 6 goals, while her teammate Pret
inha is tied for third with 3 goals.
Also among the top scorers for
Brazil is Katia Da Silva, who is tied for
sixth with two goals.
The Brazilians won Group B after

earning a draw against Germany June
27 at Soldier Field in Chicago. With
the Germans leading 3-2 in stoppage
time of the second half, Maicon of
Brazil found herself in front of a loose
ball in the German penalty box that re
bounded off two players' heads. She
blasted the ball into the goal with a
powerful strike that assured Brazil of
first place.
"We were patient and lucky enough
to keep our heads together and get a
score at the end," said Brazil coach Wil
son DeOlivera, after the game against
Germany.
"In Brazil, there's a saying that God
is Brazilian. This proves it once more."
"Certainly the dark horse of the
1999 World Cup," said U.S. assistant
coach Lauren Gregg of the Brazilian
squad to ESPN.com. "They show the
flair and style of the men's team."
Like the Americans, the Brazilians
have been overwhelmed by the fan sup
port of this year's World Cup.
"It was a bit of a shock to play in the
packed stadium," Sissi told ESPN.com
after Brazil defeated Mexico in the first
round in New Jersey. "But it was shock
in a good way. The large crowd was
very helpful to us."
"The most people my players have
ever seen is between 15-18,(X)0." DeO
livera told ESPN.com. "Usually, we
play in front of only one thousand or
two thousand people."
Brazil takes on Nigeria in the quar
terfinals, second place finishers in
group A behind the United Staes.
As the winners of the 1998 African
Women's Championship, the Nigeri
ans posted a 2-1 record in the first
round of the World Cup. defeating
North Korea and Denmark.
Although they suffered a 7-1 loss to
the United States in their second game,
the Nigerians have plunged into the
quarterfinals for the first time in tour
nament history and hope to make an
impact upon the field.
"I know victory shall be ours," for
ward Mercy Akide, who leads her team
with two goals in the competition, told
ESPN.com.
The Nigerians present a challenge to
any opponent with their style of play
which could be described as a combina
tion between the Bad Boys era of De
troit Pistons basketball and the run and
gun style of a WAC football game.
Currently, the Nigerians lead the
tournament in fouls committed (75),
and offside calls (17).
"They're very athletic, very physical
and very combative," said U.S. assis
tant coach Lauren Gregg to espn.com.
"They can produce competi

tive results and you have to be on your
toes because of their attacking flair.
They might not be as organized as other
teams, but they have some great ath
letes."
World-class soccer is no stranger to
Stanford Stadium. In 1984, the Stadiurti
served as one of the soccer venues for
the Summer Olympics. In 1994, the Sta
dium was once again employed for soc
cer use as a venue in the men's World
Cup.
At a capacity of 86,(XX), Stanford
Stadium is the largest privately owned
facility for American football.
In addition to serving as the home of
Stanford University football, the Stadi
um also hosts the annual East-West
Shrine Game, brining some of the na
tion's best football players together in
an all-star game benefiting Shriners
Hospitals for crippled children.
The July 4th game will be followed
by a Major League Soccer game be
tween D.C. United and the San Jose
Clash.
The other semifinal is likely to pit
Norway against China at Foxboro Sta
dium in Massachusetts.
China, who came into the World
Cup as the number one seed, is second
in the tournament in goals scored. With
second place finishes at the 1996
Olympics and the 1998 Goodwill
Games, the Chinese are strong con
tenders for the cup, especially after de
feating the United States in two out of
their three meetings this year before
the World Cup.
They boast the second and sixth
highest scorers in the competition in
Sun Wen (5 goals) and Yan Jin (2
goals), as well as one of the top goal
keepers in Hong Gao (.67 GAA).
"For me, this competition is differ
ent from my first two (World Cups)."
said Sun Wen before China's first game
against Sweden, "and I believe that this
is the climax of my career in soccer."
Norway should also prove to be a
worthy team. After winning the 1995
World Cup. the Norwegians won the
bronze medal at the 19% Olympics.
"I want people to see in our team
that we have a lot of good individual
players," said Norway coach Per-Math
ias Hogmo. "We beat a lot of spectacu
lar teams on the field. We play attrac
tive, attacking football."
"We are playing very well right
now," said Norway Midfielder Unni
Lchn. "It is fun to play, and we are
pulling together as a team."
After edging out Russia, the Norwe
gians trounced both Canada and Japan
by a combined score of 11-1 to advance
to the quarterfinals.
