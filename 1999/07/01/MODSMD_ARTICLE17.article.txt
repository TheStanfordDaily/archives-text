# Stewart a champion once again
## 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
The 99th installment of the U.S.
Open golf tournament was what a
national championship is supposed
to be.
First there was the course, storied
Pinehurst No. 2. The 7,175 yard, par
-70 layout, designed by fabled archi
tect Donald Ross added some much
needed flair to the typical U.S. Open
track. Sure, there were the fairways
so narrow that players had to walk
single file, and of course the putting
surfaces were slipperier than marble
staircases.
But then there were the crowned
greens and closely mowed chipping
areas which forced players to dig
deep into their bags of short game
tricks.
Then there were the players, from
the game's dominant young stars
David Duval and Tiger Woods to
unheard professionals and amateurs
who played their way into this most
"open" of tournaments through
local and sectional qualifying.
And finally there were the intan
gibles. Phil Mickelson, playing each
day with a beeper attached to his golf
bag — ready to leave the course at a
moment's notice, as his wife Amy
neared her due date on Open Sun
day. Father's Day.
Payne Stewart. Open champion
in 1991. struggled for a good part of
the year but looked to recapture the
magic that he always brings to the
year's toughest events.
Stewart had been around the
leader board all week and came into
the final day at one-under-par with a
slim one stroke lead over Mickelson
and a two shot advantage over
Woods.
The players jockeyed for position
throughout the final nine. Stewart
responded to the pressure by cover
ing Mickelson's long putt on the 16th
and then rifling his tee shot on the
par-three 17th to within four feet
where he would make birdie to take
an on shot lead.
For Stewart, the chance to take
home another Open crown was
sweet redemption after losing last
year's Open at the Olympic Club in
San Francisco, despite holding a four
shot lead going into the final round.
Former Stanford standout
Woods played strong all week, post
ing the best showing in the Open of

his young career, a lie for third place.
Woods had a chance to capture
the title down the stretch but was
hurt by his inability to convert short
putts on the closing nine, ineluding a
two and a half foot par putt on num
ber 11 to lose a shot to the field.
Teeing off first on 18, Stewart hit
what looked like a solid drive, but
his ball ended up buried deep in the
bermuda rough, just right of the
fairway. Mickelson responded with
a clutch tee shot under pressure,
splitting the fairway with a high
fade.
After reaching his ball, in a typical
U.S. Open buried lie, Stewart had no
alternative but to play back into the
fairway with a short iron. Stewart
was faced with a pitch shot of less
than one hundred yards to the
crowned green. His approach was
well played, stopping 20 feet or so
from the hole.
As the two players walked to the
18th green amidst a thunderous roar
from the surrounding grandstands, it
was one of those moments when you
know something magical is about to
happen. After four rounds of play by
a field that began with 156 players, it
was all to be decided on the 18th

green.
Mickelson took a long time sur
veying his 20 foot birdie putt. Off the
putter face, the putt looked as if it
might find the bottom of the cup, but
barely missed the hole.
It was now all up to Stewart. If he
made his putt, the tournament was
over. If he missed, the two men
would return Monday morning for
an 18 hole playoff.
The same massive gallery which
had rivaled a Super Bowl crowd's
noise only moment's earlier was now
deathly still.
Stewart's putt was perfect and
dropped dead-center into the hole.
In a flurry of fist-pumping and jubila
tion, Stewart electrified the crowd
once again with his victory stroke.
As Mickelson came to offer his
congratulations, Stewart embraced
the young pro and ordered him to go
home and be a great father.
The scene ended with Stewart
embracing his wife Tracey. The pain
of not winning on tour since 1995 and
the agony of Olympic the year be
fore were all gone — washed away in
a sea of applause and emotion that
captivated the champion and those
who saw the tournament.
