# Cardinal falls in emotionally charged CWS
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Stanford was so close to playing
for its third National Champi
onship.
But Karl Jernigan's home run
was so far away.
After staging a thrilling come
back from a 7-2 deficit in the sev
enth inning, the Cardinal (50-15)
could not hold a two-run lead in the
ninth or tenth innings as Jernigan's
three-run shot gave Florida State
(57-14) a 14-11 victory and moved
the Seminoles into the champi
onship game against top-seeded
Miami.
"My hat is off to Florida State,"
said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. But, "I am very proud of
our team. I thought we played well
today. 1 was sorry to end it. We
wanted a chance to play in the
championship game."
After destroying CalState -
Fullerton 9-2 in its first game of the
College World Series and banishing
No. 2 seed Florida State to the losers
bracket with a 10-6 win June 14,
Stanford was looking towards a shot
at the NCAA title.
However June 17 the Cardinal
squandered its chance to eliminate
the Seminoles — and move to the
championship game with sopho

mound — by losing to Florida Slate,

than the score would attest.
In the double elimination format
of the CWS, Stanford and Florida
State had to square off again the fol
lowing day. The winner earned a
tangle with the top-seeded Hurri
canes and the loser received a return
ticket home.
With elimination on the line.
Marquess predictably tabbed
Young — the staffs most talented
and clutch performer — to keep the
Cardinal moving on.
Despite struggling through a
rough first four innings in which he
gave up seven runs on 11 hits.
Young settled down and actually
got stronger as the game wore on.
He allowed no hits through the
next four innings as his fastball inex
plicably sped up and his curveball
picked up added bite.
"I'm not sure why I was having a
hard lime early," Young said. "1
don't think I was in my groove early.
I'm not sure what got me into it, but
I got my groove back and estab
lished my location."
All the while, Young's pitch
count, which skyrocketed through
the first four innings, was inching up
into scary territory. Though Young
