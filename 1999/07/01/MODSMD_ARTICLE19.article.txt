# Cardinal falls in emotionally charged CWS
## 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Stanford was so close to playing
for its third National Champi
onship.
But Karl Jernigan's home run
was so far away.
After staging a thrilling come
back from a 7-2 deficit in the sev
enth inning, the Cardinal (50-15)
could not hold a two-run lead in the
ninth or tenth innings as Jernigan's
three-run shot gave Florida State
(57-14) a 14-11 victory and moved
the Seminoles into the champi
onship game against top-seeded
Miami.
"My hat is off to Florida State,"
said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. But, "I am very proud of
our team. I thought we played well
today. 1 was sorry to end it. We
wanted a chance to play in the
championship game."
After destroying CalState -
Fullerton 9-2 in its first game of the
College World Series and banishing
No. 2 seed Florida State to the losers
bracket with a 10-6 win June 14,
Stanford was looking towards a shot
at the NCAA title.
However June 17 the Cardinal
squandered its chance to eliminate
the Seminoles — and move to the
championship game with sopho
more ace Jason Young on the

mound — by losing to Florida Slate,
8-6, in a game much more lopsided
than the score would attest.
In the double elimination format
of the CWS, Stanford and Florida
State had to square off again the fol
lowing day. The winner earned a
tangle with the top-seeded Hurri
canes and the loser received a return
ticket home.
With elimination on the line.
Marquess predictably tabbed
Young — the staffs most talented
and clutch performer — to keep the
Cardinal moving on.
Despite struggling through a
rough first four innings in which he
gave up seven runs on 11 hits.
Young settled down and actually
got stronger as the game wore on.
He allowed no hits through the
next four innings as his fastball inex
plicably sped up and his curveball
picked up added bite.
"I'm not sure why I was having a
hard lime early," Young said. "1
don't think I was in my groove early.
I'm not sure what got me into it, but
I got my groove back and estab
lished my location."
All the while, Young's pitch
count, which skyrocketed through
the first four innings, was inching up
into scary territory. Though Young
had made throwing a complete

game look commonplace through
out the season — routinely throwing
140 or 150 pitches — he had already
thrown 100 pitches by the fourth in
ning and 150 by the seventh.
However, Marquess left him in
the game.
"We are definitely concerned
about pitch counts," Marquess said.

But, "I asked him how he felt,
and he said he was fine. I thought he
had a better fastball in the eighth
and ninth innings than the fifth
through the seventh.
"It was a gutsy performance by
him."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
guts alone would not allow Young to
finish the game.
With a 9-7 lead to work with in
the bottom of the ninth inning,
Young walked the Seminoles'

pudgy senior catcher, Jeremiah
Klosterman, on a full count.
Then, again with a 3-2 count, ju
nior Kevin Cash took Young deep
to left-center field to tie the game
and force Marquess to pull the right
hander.
After Stanford's closer, Tony
Cogan, got out of the ninth un
scathed, the Cardinal bounced hack
again by scoring two runs to take an
11-9 lead.
However Cogan could not stop
Florida State and its star second
baseman Marshall McDougall.
McDougall, who was named
Most Outstanding Player of the
CWS, led off the l()th with a long
home run to left-center, his second
of the game.
With one out Cogan allowed an
other solo home run to left-center —
this one coming off the bat of junior
designated hitter Sam Scott.
Though the senior closer shut
down Florida State in the 11th and
12th innings, the Stanford offense
could not post any more runs.
Cogan walked reserve shortstop
Bobbv Spano to open the bottom of
the 13th and then allowed a single to
freshman Ryan Barthelemv that
moved Spano to third base with no
outs.
Marquess moved the Stanford
outfield in, knowing that any long fly
ball would score Spano from third
base and end the game.
However, Jernigan made sure
that it didn't matter where the out
field was playing. The moment his
line-drive, game-winning home run
left the bat, the Seminoles stormed
from their dugout to celebrate at
home and the Cardinal began walk
ing slowly towards the dugout and a
summer of what-ifs.
