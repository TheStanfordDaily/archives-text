# What a great ride it was

### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
Stanford's 14-11 season-ending loss to Flori
da State at the College World Series was not a
fitting end.
The only end truly befitting this scrappy, un
derappreciated Stanford baseball team would
have featured the Cardinal in a celebratory pile
on the mound of Omaha's Johnny Rosenblatt
Stadium.
However, since only one team can end the
postseason a winner.
Stanford's defeat in the semifinal game of
the College World Series was the only type of
loss that this Cardinal team could lake pride in.
For a team which fought back time and
again, which overcame a woefully inexperi
enced pitching staff and squeezed the most oui
of each player, only a loss in extra innings on
the last swing of the bat would have been right.
After the game it made everything hurt so
much more.
Senior closer l onv Cogan. who threw N.S
pitches in his longest stint ol the year, chucked
his glove at the ground in diseusi as the game
winninu home run sailed out to left field.

Sophomore Ail-American Jason Young beat
his head against the green dugout wall and
stared at a dirt floor liberally scattered with
sunflower seeds after giving up the game-tying
homer in the ninth.
Players unabashedly wept as they sat in the
dugout, shocked that the game and season had
ended so abruptly. Others openly cursed how
close they had come. All five players who
showed up at the postgame press conference
seemed to have tears welling in their eyes.
But once they had time to reflect, maybe
they could realize that a team which had staged
mammoth comebacks all season to beat teams
could not have lost any other way.
Down by five runs in the seventh inning.
Stanford was most certainly teetering on the
ropes.
Seminoles starter Jon McDonald allowed
the Cardinal five hits from the second through
the sixth inning. But Stanford could not push
any runners across the plate.
Florida State was looking at only nine more
ouis until it could play lor what it hoped would
be its first title in 17 trips to ()maha

Catcher Damien Alvarado reflects on the Cardinal loss to Florida State.
However Stanford, itching to get
back into the game, would not let the
Seminoles record even three outs
before the Cardinal could take back
the lead it last held in the second in
ning.
Taking advantage of anything
and everything it was given, Stanford
loaded the bases on three straight
walks in the seventh inning.
Junior first baseman John Gall,
perhaps Stanford's best clutch per
former, then lined an improbable
grand slam just over the fence to
bring the team within a run.
Then, reliever Mike Dißlasi hit
Damien Alvarado with a pitch. Ju
nior Nick Day made him pay for the
two-out mistake by blasting a triple

of the center-field wall.
Junior Edmund Muth followed
that up with a two-run blast that rode
the fabled Rosenblatt Stadium jet
stream straight out of the park.
Stanford only got three hits in the
seventh inning. But the team took
advantage of three walks and a hit
batter to score seven runs.
Seven runs on three hits. That's
the definition of making something
out of nothing.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
Florida State was able to capitalize
on just as many Cardinal mistakes.
Jason Young, running on fumes
in the ninth inning, walked Semi
noles catcher Jeremiah Klosterman
with a two-out lead. The next batter
hit the game-tying home run.
In the 13th inning Tony Cogan,
also extended past his usual time,
walked Florida State's Bobby Spano

— who proceeded to third on a sub
sequent single to set up the game
winning run.
Most importantly, though, Stan
ford did not lose in a blowout or by
throwing in the towel. The Cardinal
lost in a battle, not just for the game
but truly for the National Champi
onship.
Stanford gave it a valiant effort
and, in the process, helped produce
one of the better games in CWS his
tory.
As Marquess said in the emotion
al postgame press conference, "I am
very proud of our team. We did
come back and try to win it. It was a
great year. 1 think this is our best
team as far as chemistry. Not talent
wise, but for the chemistry.
"I was sorry to see it end."
So was everyone else, coach. It
was a great ride.
