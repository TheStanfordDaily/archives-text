# What a great ride it was

Stanford's 14-11 season-ending loss to Flori
da State at the College World Series was not a
fitting end.
The only end truly befitting this scrappy, un
derappreciated Stanford baseball team would
have featured the Cardinal in a celebratory pile
on the mound of Omaha's Johnny Rosenblatt
Stadium.
However, since only one team can end the
postseason a winner.
Stanford's defeat in the semifinal game of
the College World Series was the only type of
loss that this Cardinal team could lake pride in.
For a team which fought back time and
again, which overcame a woefully inexperi
enced pitching staff and squeezed the most oui
of each player, only a loss in extra innings on
the last swing of the bat would have been right.
After the game it made everything hurt so
much more.
Senior closer l onv Cogan. who threw N.S
pitches in his longest stint ol the year, chucked
his glove at the ground in diseusi as the game
winninu home run sailed out to left field.

Sophomore Ail-American Jason Young beat
his head against the green dugout wall and
stared at a dirt floor liberally scattered with
sunflower seeds after giving up the game-tying
homer in the ninth.
Players unabashedly wept as they sat in the
dugout, shocked that the game and season had
ended so abruptly. Others openly cursed how
close they had come. All five players who
showed up at the postgame press conference
seemed to have tears welling in their eyes.
But once they had time to reflect, maybe
they could realize that a team which had staged
mammoth comebacks all season to beat teams
could not have lost any other way.
Down by five runs in the seventh inning.
Stanford was most certainly teetering on the
ropes.
Seminoles starter Jon McDonald allowed
the Cardinal five hits from the second through
the sixth inning. But Stanford could not push
any runners across the plate.
Florida State was looking at only nine more
ouis until it could play lor what it hoped would
be its first title in 17 trips to ()maha
