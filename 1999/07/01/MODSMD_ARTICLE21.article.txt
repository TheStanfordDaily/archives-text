## Celebrating Ellington Big band lives on in Jazz Festival opener 
### Valentine Ding 
When Louie Bellson joined Duke Elling
ton's hand in May of 1951. he knew he was to fill
the void left by the departure of Sonny Greer,
the renowned drummer, who for 28 years had
been a member of the Ellington group. Feeling
that the transition must be hard for Duke, he
expected him to ask him to play and sound just
like Sonny Greer had. Duke, however, said
right from the top, "I want to hear from you."
Last weekend, almost half a century after he
learned to play in Duke's orchestra. Louie Bell
son brought his own band to the Stanford cam
pus and let everyone hear again the uniquely
Ellingtonian sound — a grand musical tapestry
woven of many distinct voices.
The June 23 night concert, aptly named "Big
Band Ellington!." kicked off a three-day con
cert series entitled, "Ellington @ 100!," which
also marked the beginning of the 27th annual
Stanford Jazz Workshop and Festival.
A tribute to the centennial birthday of the
madly beloved Ellington, who died in 1974, the
concert was also a personal homage to Duke,
paid in the language of music. Among featured
artists, besides Bellson, were Maurice Peress, a
friend and collaborator of Duke's and Barrie
Lee Hall, proudly known as "the last musician
hired by Ellington for his orchestra."
Thanks to these virtuosi, the cavernous

Memorial Auditorium pulsated with the big
band vitality. With Peress as conductor, the first
part of the concert celebrated the classical
grandeur of Ellington's jazz music. Legendarily
long and vibrant pieces were chosen to demon
strate Duke's between-pop-culture-and-art
culture approach, which injected the elements
of high art to the folk realm of jazz music.
Among the selections, (there were only
three in this portion of the program), the most
well-known was "Black." the opening section
of "Black, Brown and Beige," an epical explo
ration of the Black life in America. The 55-
minute-long musical saga was never written
down nor played again after Ellington's band's
1943 debut at Carnegie Hall.
The June 23 performance was made possi
ble by Peress' painstaking reconstruction from
the 1943 Carnegie Hall recording. Classical
progression alternated with animated syncopa
tion. the piece seemed to be telling the day-by
day story of African-Americans - among the
pain and routine, there is joyful wonder and en
thusiasm, and that's where the jazz feelings are.
Though categorized as "symphonic suite,"
"Black. Brown and Beige" rocks and swings,
because it's essentially about "the uplift of
human spirit," according to the late vocalist Joe
Williams in a recorded introduction to the or
chestra's 1997 performance.
The second half of the concert featured

seven Ellingtonianly danceable and listenable
numbers. Pieces like "Take the A train", "Pre
lude To A Kiss" and"It Don't Mean a Thing If
It Ain't Got That Swing" were masterfully re
vived in solo, duo and multi-section harmony.
The chord had a lot of improvisations and the
arrangement was proper and timely. The im
pact of the individual player was so over
whelming one couldn't help but begin to ac
knowledge the fact that only an all-star big band
can revive the rich and diverse sound that be
longs to Ellington.
The concert culminated in the image-evok

ing piece called "Caravan," one of Duke's most
cherished feats. The peak was reached during
Bellson's intoxicating, 7-minute-long drum
solo. The sticks, as if having their own life, spun
in his hands. Bellson fully exhausted the possi
bilities of the voices a drum set can create. He
was playing out the whole spirit, attentively and
passionately.
The Stanford Jazz Festival continues
through August 7th. For ticket information and
