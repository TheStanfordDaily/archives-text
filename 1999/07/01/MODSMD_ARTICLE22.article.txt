# South Park delivers irony along with lots of obscenity
## Delightfully offensive movie version of cartoon pokes fun at everything, including self

For a truly satisfying cartoon
movie experience, funnel "The Little
Mermaid," "Les Miserables" and
"Street Fighter" through the head of
a potty-mouthed yet precocious ado
lescent boy. Let them churn just
enough to become slightly twisted.

splash with a healthy dose of irony
and season lightly with innocent
Charlie Brown appeal. Leave in the
sun until sour, then serve. Or just go
see "South Park: Bigger. Louder and
Uncut."
The film, by the creators of the
original "South Park" television se
ries, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, is
more than just an extended "South
Park" episode. Satisfyingly offensive
and ludicriously real. "South Park:
Bigger, Louder and Uncut." is, in its
own twisted way, an immensely cre
ative and almost classy film.
One of the most charming ele
ments of "South Park: Bigger Loud
er and Uncut" is its self-referential
humor. The film opens as the South
Parkers Stan, Kyle, Cartman and
Kenny skip through the streets of
their mid-west town to sneak into an
R-rated cartoon movie.
The they see movie is essentially a
meditation on flatulence staring the
Canadian actors Terrance and
Phillip. It improves the children's al
ready graphic vocabularies im
mensely, much to the dismay of their
school teachers and parents.

Then Kenny expires in an unfor
tunate farting accident only reinforc
ing the parents' concern over their
children's corruption by the media.
This leads to the creation of "Moth
ers Against Canada," spearheaded
by Kyle's mom and supported by the
South Park mothers. Canada be
comes the focal point in a vicious at
tack by the mothers of America on
what they perceive as the degrada
tion of family values through the in
fluence of the Canadian media.
Meanwhile, as the country barrels
towards war. Stan. Kyle and Cart
man find out that Terrance and
Phillip, taken hostage by their moth
ers, are to be executed. In response
they form the underground group La
Resistance focused on freeing Ter
rance and Phillip. They enlist the
help of "the mole," a chain smoking
French kid. the only character more
jaded than the South Park kids them
selves. "Was I smiling when my
mother pierced my heart with a coat
hanger in the womb?" he mutters.
A third plot thread focuses on
Kenny's misfortunes. Rejected by
Heaven he plumes to depths of Hell

where he runs into Satan, who is in
volved in an unsatisfying domestic
relationship with Saddam Hussain.
While Satan complains their rela
tionship lacks communication and
Saddam's only in it for the sex. Sad
dam packs their bags because the
apocalypse is coming. "South Park"
style.
The intensity of the film is amaz
ing, constantly rushing on to the next
punch line before you've recovered
from the last joke. However, what re
ally keeps it moving are the brilliant
songs. Always funny, from Stan's
Chailie Brownish "there's the girl
that I like" to Satan's woeful Little
Mermaid-like singing as he seeks to
be part of the above ground world,
every song is well placed and won
derful as Disney musical interludes
are dreaded.
Ultimately, "South Park: Bigger.
Louder and Uncut" has a message -
the movie aims to explode high ten
sion issues by pushing stereotypes to
the max. Hence it generously ladles
out the knee-jerk patriotism, xeno
phobia, homophobia, racism and
anything else one could possibly be

offended by. There are a few scenes
where offense is excessive even to
the most lenient, notably in the Sad
dam Hussain and Satan scenes
where the gay-sex jokes are taken to
an incessant extreme.
But "South Park: Bigger, Louder
and Uncut" is not a movie without a
mission, and in the end all the ob
scenity boils down to a pro-tolerance
theme as families are reunited, good
triumphs over evil and swearing
turns out to be not so bad after all.
