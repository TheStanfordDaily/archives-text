## Card future is bright 
### Jonathan Stull Staff writer 
After the disappointment of los
ing to Florida State in the College
World Series wears off, the Cardinal
should settle down for an optimistic
and upbeat offseason.
After the highly talented 1998
Cardinal baseball team did not make
it to Omaha for the CWS and follow
ing the loss of the team's top three
starting pitchers, its unflappable cen
ter fielder and experienced double
play combination to the major
"leagues, the 1999 edition of Stanford
baseball managed to finish third in
the nation.
Quite a ride from a team with nu
merous doubters nationally and
within the Pacific 10 Conference it
self— defending national champion
USC was picked by everyone to win
the Pac-10 entering the season.
Amazingly, next year could be
even better.
Much depends on which drafted
juniors and Stanford signees take a
pass on the major leagues.
Of course seniors Josh Hochge
sangand Tony Cogan. drafted in the
7th and 12th rounds, respectively,
will be gone.
However questions remain about
the three juniors who were drafted
— center fielder Edmund Muth in
the 22nd round, second baseman
Jeff Rizzo in the 35th round and first
baseman John Gall in the 50th
round.
All indications point to Rizzo
signing. Drafted by his hometown
San Diego Padres, it seems that
Rizzo — a fifth-round pick in the
19% draft — is anxious to begin his

career.
Muth and Gall seem to be more
up in the air.
No indication has been made
whether or not Muth is planning on
returning.
Gall, the last collegiate player
chosen and the sixth-to-last player
picked overall in the late May draft,
is a more difficult case to consider. It
appeared that Gall was going to sign
and play pro ball regardless of his po
sition in the draft.
Gall, who is Stanford's all-time
career hitting leader and went 11 for
15 with 6 RBIs in the College World
Series, is playing for Team USA
again this summer — a sign he is con
sidering returning to Stanford next
year.
The rest of the lineup is pretty
well locked in.
Sophomore Billy Jacobson will
probably see increased time in the
outfield alongside sophomore slug
ger Joe Borchard and juniors Nick
Day and. possibly, Craig Thompson.
Junior Eric Bruntlett and his solid
defense w ill probably anchor the in
field again at shortstop.
Junior Damien Alvarado, who
did an excellent job of shepherding
the young pitching staff all year, will
again be behind the plate.
Depending on whether or not
Rizzo and Gall take off, the rest of
the infield could have quite a differ
ent flavor.
Though the expectations will be
sky-high, the pitching staff should be
the team's strength. Sophomores
Jason Young and Justin Wayne and
freshmen Brian Sager, the team's
top three starters, will return after
shining this season.
