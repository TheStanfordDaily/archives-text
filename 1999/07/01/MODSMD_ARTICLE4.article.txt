## Stanford Bookstore enters contract with Follett Independent organization to manage day-to-day operations 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
institutions (including Harvard and
Yale) have entered into bookstore
operating agreements that have im
proved services," she said.
Under the terms of the contract, a
transition team will begin working
with the current Bookstore staff to
make sure that operations continue
as usual. According to Hebert, Fol
lett expects to hire most of the cur
rent Bookstore employees to serve
under the new system.
Hebert adds that 268 employees
were employed by the Bookstore
before the agreement was signed.
She estimates that approximately 20

Starting today the Stanford Uni
versity Bookstore will no longer be
internally operated, but rather man
aged by Follett Higher Education
Group.
While all of the stores currently
owned by the Bookstore will retain
their current names and services,
Follett will assume management re
sponsibility for all of them.
"We want to stress that the Book
store was not sold," said Shelley
Hebert, Stanford's Director of Busi
ness Development. "Follett does
not own the Bookstore. It only has a
management contract."
Included in the agreement are
the Main Campus store, Tresidder
Express, the Track House, the
Bookshop at the Iris and B. Gerald
Cantor Center for the Visual Arts,
the University Shop at Stanford
Shopping Center and Stanford
Bookstore Palo Alto.
"We have been working collabo
ratively on the selection process with
the Bookstore for several months
and strongly endorse the selection,"
said Mariann Bverwalter, Universi
ty vice president for business affairs
and chief financial officer.
"We share a common goal of con
tinuing to have a first-rate, academic
bookstore at Stanford that not only
meets the needs of faculty and stu
dents but offers competitive prices
for the entire campus community."
The agreement, announced on
June 1 f>, comes after months of spec
ulation that the Bookstore was in
talks with a number of corporations.
It also comes soon after the Book
store appeared to be facing legal
questions surrounding the way in
which it handled the overbilling of a
number of credit card-paving cus
tomers last October.
"Follett is very pleased to have
been selected to manage the book
stores at Stanford University and is
committed to providing the highest
level of service to Stanford's stu
dents. faculty and alumni," said
James Baumann. Follett's president.
Hebert added that such an agree
ment was first sought so that Stan
ford Bookstore could compete ef
fectively with other college book
stores and because a third party op
erator could meet Stanford's needs
well.
"Working with the University,
the [Bookstore] Board considered
the fact that many of Stanford's peer

positions will be eliminated, most of
them upper management positions.
"Because Follett will manage the
Bookstore's operations, some posi
tions will no longer be needed be
cause they would duplicate function
within the company.'" she said.
She added that around 40 stu
dents work at the Bookstore each
quarter and that that number is ex
pected to continue after the agree
ment takes effect.
"We are communicating with all
employees to provide them with a
high comfort level as they are joining
Follett." said Jane Kennedy. Fol
lett's vice president of human re
sources.
Hebert said that Follett plans to
install a local director who will over

see its operations on campus. And,
because corporate operations fall
under the jurisdiction of Follett, the
current Board of Directors will exist
in a "reduced" capacity and will pri
marily consult Follett.
"An committee which will consist
of students, faculty, administrators
and several current Bookstore
Board members will help ensure
that the Bookstore continues to pro
vide quality merchandise and ser
vices that meet the needs of the
Stanford Community.

"It was important to the Book
store's Board of Directors and the
University that the company in
volved have a strong commitment to
maintaining the academic character
of the Bookstore," Hebert said.
"Follett has a long history of a focus
on academic book sales."
History Prof. David Kennedy,
chair of the current Bookstore
Board of Directors added, "Follett's
exclusive focus on academic book
stores will assure that the Stanford
community continues to have one of
the country's finest university book
stores."

According to Hebert, Follett is
committed to maintaining and
building upon the success of the
Bookstore. To that end. they have
pledged to retain the 7 percent re-

bate for all student book purchases
and a number of other services, in
eluding the Microdisc computer re
pair service.

Suggested new services include a
"Buy 10 get one free" program on
non-academic books, a faculty/staff
sales discount, a greater student ac
cess to used books and improved on
line services for all customers.
"We look forward to providing
products and services that will meet
or exceed the University's expecta
tions," Baumann added.
Future plans include a major ren
ovation of the main campus store
and improvements to Tresidder Ex
press.
The collaboration with Follett
comes at a time when the Bookstore
seemed to be in legal trouble. As re
ported in The Daily in June, the
Bookstore accidentally double
billed a number of its customers be
cause of a computer malfunction in
the credit card transmission system.
Because the Bookstore did not
take the sufficient and decisive steps
needed to rectify the problem, there
were some questions raised as to
whether legal action might be taken.
Hebert insists that this is no longer a
problem.
"To mv understanding, the re
maining double billed customers
were identified last month and their
accounts credited," she said.
Hebert added that Follett will
continue to honor this agreement as
well and that any customer who was
overbilled and has not yet come for
ward may do so and have their ac
count credited promptly.
In terms of negotiations. Hebert
said that these issues did not. to the
best of her knowledge, cause any po
tential collaborators to lose interest.
"No one pulled out of the bidding
because of this issue." she said.
The agreement also comes when
current Bookstore President and
CEO Peggy Mendelson had an
nounced plans to retire. According
to Hebert, that will have to wait.
"[Mendelson] will first help make
sure that the transition [with Follett]
is a smooth one." Hebert said.
"Though she hasn't set a definitive
date as yet. she will retire at some
point in the future."
Mendelson's position and duties,
though no longer fully needed under
the new corporate system, will be
absorbed by the local Follett Direc
tor.
As the nation's largest manager
of academic bookstores. Follett cur
rently operates stores at 585 colleges
and universities, including at UC-
Berkelev and University of Notre
Dame.
