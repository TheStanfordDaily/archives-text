Graduation on June 13 was the usual spectacle. The heat was intense,
pounding down on the black swathed graduates. Beach balls and dime store
paraphernalia littered the grass, and the soon-to-be graduates, dressedUn a

nancially strained parents.
NotabFes were beach scenes, pink boa-ed Pi Beta Phi women, men in tights,
a "one hundred twenty thousand dollar for a ride" sedan chair and disco
dancers.
After the students were finally coerced to sit down, University President
Gerhard Casper opened the ceremony with statistics libout the Class of '99. As
the Class of '99 passed beach balls and cheered for him, Casper expressed
thanks for, "reminding me of my name."
After Casper finished his welcoming address, Pfovost Condoleezza Rice
awarded the Walter J. Gores Award for excellence in teaching, the Eloyd W.
Dinkelspiel Award for distinguished contribution to undergraduate education
and The Kenneth M. Cuthbertson Award for exceptional service to the Uni
versity. The awardees stemmed from several departments, ranging from dance
to psychology, % > > |

will add to the history that has made the world whajl it is today, like another
layer to a topographical map. Rather than taking a light, inspirational ap
proach, Pinsky fcSSused on the universal needs of society, saying that "caring for
the young ones and honoring tie wisdom of the old ones" are life two great re
quirements for the human animal.
