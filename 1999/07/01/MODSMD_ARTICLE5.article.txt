### Elizabeth Khuri-Yakub Contributing writer 
Graduation on June 13 was the usual spectacle. The heat was intense,
pounding down on the black swathed graduates. Beach balls and dime store
paraphernalia littered the grass, and the soon-to-be graduates, dressedUn a
wacky array of costumes, stormed the field armed with signs saluting the»fi
nancially strained parents.
NotabFes were beach scenes, pink boa-ed Pi Beta Phi women, men in tights,
a "one hundred twenty thousand dollar for a ride" sedan chair and disco
dancers.
After the students were finally coerced to sit down, University President
Gerhard Casper opened the ceremony with statistics libout the Class of '99. As
the Class of '99 passed beach balls and cheered for him, Casper expressed
thanks for, "reminding me of my name."
After Casper finished his welcoming address, Pfovost Condoleezza Rice
awarded the Walter J. Gores Award for excellence in teaching, the Eloyd W.
Dinkelspiel Award for distinguished contribution to undergraduate education
and The Kenneth M. Cuthbertson Award for exceptional service to the Uni
versity. The awardees stemmed from several departments, ranging from dance
to psychology, % > > |
This yep's commencement speaker was United States Poet Laureate
Robert Pitifc&y. A graduate of Stanford with a master's in 1966 and a doctorate
in 1967, Pinsky now teaches creative writing at Boston University.
Pjpky spoke about the need to respect one's elders and how the Class of '99
will add to the history that has made the world whajl it is today, like another
layer to a topographical map. Rather than taking a light, inspirational ap
proach, Pinsky fcSSused on the universal needs of society, saying that "caring for
the young ones and honoring tie wisdom of the old ones" are life two great re
quirements for the human animal.

remarked, "Pinsky was more sophisticated than maybe
Stanford was ready for." One anonymous student called it
a "self-aggrandizing waste of time," while Meghan Hig
gins. a graduate in English and international relations said,
"I thought he gave a good speech on a very relevant sub
ject."
Following the speech. Casper conferred the degrees.
The newly graduated students then opened up their voice
boxes for a sweaty, jubilant rendition of the Stanford
Hymn. After a benediction by Acting Dean of Religious
Life Kelly Denton-Borhaug, the graduates were free to
party, dance around, cry, express thanks and think about
how these past few years have left an indelible mark on
their lives.
As the ceremony concluded, Casper gave some parting
words of advice. "Remember as you leave here today that
Stanford stands for common purpose, for fortitude, faith
and good cheer.. .It stands for a continuoQs commitment
to the power of reason and the unceasing process of in
quiry."
Post graduation, most students expressed a sense of re
lief. Gentry Underwood, a graduate in symbolic systems,
remarked, "I was relieved in a strange way, due to the in
tensity of the previous days. Now I'm actually going to
move on with my life, rather than be in limbo."
Becky Spain, graduate in political science, agreed, "I'm
glad to be able to take a deep breath and finally get some
sleep."
