## Summer transitions 
### 
I had just finished my freshman
year in high school the last time
Stanford hosted a World Cup
game. But the similarities between
that summer and this summer end
at just that — the World Cup.
In 1994 it was the men playing in
stead of this summer's women.
Then, soccer still seemed like a fair
ly new concept (I come from a fam
ily of tennis fans). That summer, I
was fourteen, and of course, I felt
like every other fourteen-year-old
just let out of school — like I was on
top of the world.
I remember being in downtown
Los Gatos with some friends one af
ternoon, just a couple of days be
fore the much anticipated U.S.-
Brazil match-up. We were celebrat
ing a friend's birthday (she had just
turned 15, and it was a big thing, of
course). As we walked down Main
Street, there, lo and behold, was the
Brazilian soccer team, (and the
greater half of Los Gatos), partying
it down in front of my favorite ice
cream store.
Double-choco fudge I was not
going to get that day. But I guess 1
could settle for dancing in the
streets with Brazilian soccer play
ers.
For me. each summer has mem
ories like this one — remembrances
of occurrences that aren't terribly
important, but are. somehow, per
fect. And.for some reason, the fact
that these memories have their
backdrop in summer make them all
the more vivid. Perhaps it's because
I see summer as a period of transi
tion. one in which we can take time
to consider what's past, and to think
upon what is to come, that these
memories arc all the more fond.
The stories in our first issue show
that this summer will indeed be a
time of transition, as we speed to
wards the upcoming school year

and the millennium. Change is evi
dent for two important struetures
on eampus—the bookstore and the
LGBCC. as both witness transi
tions in direction and management.
Reporter Jonathan Stull looks at
the heart-breaking loss for Stanford
baseball, (captured in the emotion
ally charged accompanying pho
tos). but speculates on the year to
come, and what will be different.
And reporter Valentine Ding looks
at how Duke Ellington's work af
fects jazz at Stanford to this day.
For the individuals on campus
this summer, many of whom are vis
iting from other schools, 1 hope our
weekly publication can act as an in
troduction of sorts to Stanford and
its people. This is what we're all
about — what do you think? And
for those of you who are already
well-familiarized with what we're
all about, we still want to know:
what do you think?
Your responses to our work
mold our paper, so remember us
every Thursday when you pass by a
newspaper stand. And. if you're so
inclined, join our staff and have an
influence on what we print and
what others read.
As for this summer, there
weren't any Brazilian soccer play
ers in LosGatos(l looked). I've just
turned 20 and am wondering why
people still mistake me for 14. And
I'm not quite sure I still feel on top
of the world (summer isn't as fun
when you're working two jobs). But
I do still love double-choco fudge.
Some things, thankfully, never
change.
