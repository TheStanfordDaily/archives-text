# Thefts of credit cards and cash from dorms continue
## Stanford Police warns students to lock doors 
### Anh Bui Contributing writer 
A serial burglar who takes stu
dent credit cards from unlocked
rooms has hit the Stanford campus
again, this time at the Chi Theta Chi
and Sigma Chi houses. These thefts
appear to be a continuation of a
credit card theft spree that started
this May.
The most recent burglaries were
reported on June 14. In each house,
credit cards were taken from unoc
cupied rooms in which the doors
were left open.
A picture of the possible culprit
was taken earlier this year at Arti
choke Joe's, a gambling center in
San Bruno, where the suspect ob
tained a cash advance on one of the
stolen credit cards. Hoping the pic
ture will allow someone to identify
the criminal, or at least make resi
dents more careful about leaving
their doors open, police have posted
the picture in the main residential
buildings around campus.
The suspect is a 20-year-old white
male, who is 5 foot 6 inches tall with
medium build and short, slightly
wavy blond hair. He appears to be a
student.
Between 15 and 20 burglaries and
thefts have been committed since
May. and they are attributed to this
suspect. The thefts started in the
houses in the Cowell cluster, moving
to the dormitories on Escondido
Road. Burglaries then began to
occur on the Row and eventually in
Florence Moore Hall. Although the
burglar has hit a couple of times a
week during the school year, with
the crimes being committed on any
day, including holidays such as
Memorial Day.the thief has not re
turned to any of the houses he previ
ously hit.
This summer, laptops have been
taken from one of the computer
camps, and a room in Mirrielees was
burglarized with some clothes taken.
One of the Resident Fellow's apart
ments was broken into, and around
$5,000 worth of property was stolen.
Given his movements and the
quick nature of each crime, the sus

pect appears to be someone who is
very familiar with the campus.
"He knows his way around cam
pus," said Rick Tipton, a sergeant
with the Stanford Dept. of Public
Safety Investigation Unit who is han
dling this case. "He could be a stu
dent, a former student or even a
friend of a student who came here on
campus and noticed that everyone
was leaving their doors open."
In each case, the burglary is simi
lar: the suspect enters an unlocked
room and takes credit cards, and
sometimes cash, out of a wallet in the
room. Often, he will not take the
wallet itself, so the victim is un-aware
of the theft until days later.
After taking the credit cards, the
criminal will then go to a gas station
and attempt to purchase a gallon of
gas in order to see whether the cred
it card is still valid. If it is, he goes on
to other places to use the credit
cards.
"These burglaries occur in the
early afternoon," said Tipton. "He
checks out the credit cards during
the late afternoon and starts using
them to make purchases the same
evening."
The burglar only seems to use the
stolen cards for the day following the
theft.
Initially, the stolen credit cards

were used at the Stanford Shopping
Center, where one of the items pur
chased included a leather coat. After
using the credit cards from three to
four thefts at one center, the thief
would move on to a different place.
Stolen student credit cards have
been used at the Hillsdale Shopping
Center and at gambling centers in
San Mateo County, where he would
get cash advances. It was at one of
these latter places that a video cam
era caught the criminal on tape and
produced the picture police are using
to try to apprehend him.
The best current help the police
have to offer, however, is some old
advice: lock your doors.
"I have no idea why students
leave their doors open," said Tipton.
"Locking your door is half the battle.
You can stop a lot of the theft by just
locking the door."
Also, "people, especially stu
dents, have a tendency not to be
aware of the things going on around
them," said Clark Vitt, facilities su
pervisor for Mirrielees and Wilbur
Hall.
It all comes down in the end to
common sense: "If you lived in a city,
would you ever leave your door un
locked?" said Tipton. "We don't live
in a Utopia. Even a closed area [like
Stanford] is still victimized."
