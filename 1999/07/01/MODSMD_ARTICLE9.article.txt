# Silverstein claims MacArthur award

Talking with Assoc. Prof Eva Sil
vcrstcin is a fun experience to learn
how physicists look at the world.
"It's a precise, elegant world," she
mused in her Spartan, modest-sized
office at Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center "In the language of math
ematics, everything is simple and
beautiful."
As a theorist Silverstein said that
the quest for such a world was basi
cally her source of motivation. And
she was happy that she had found her
interest, which generated passion
and has subsequently brought her
achievement.
Silverstein was told on June 23
that she had won a grant from the an
nual Mac Arthur Fellowship Pro
gram for her theoretical studies
which, according to the Mac Arthur
Foundation, "provide key insights
into the age, structure, dynamics and
eventual fate of the universe."
At age 28, she is the youngest
among this year's 32 Mac Arthur Fel
lows. The award is five years' no
strings-attached, financial support
totaling $235,(XX).
The greatness of the grant lies not
in the total freedom the recipients
have to spend the money, nor in the
sheer size of the amount, but rather,
in its awe-inspiring nickname, "the
genius grant."
The Mac Arthur Foundation has
made it clear that the grant is de
signed to encourage "exceptionally

talented and promising individuals"
in all possible fields that may con
tribute to humanity.
Silverstein's work, theoretical
physics, many say, has an impact on
how we understand our cosmic exis
tence.
"In high school, I read a lot of
books on physics theory from Barnes
and Noble," recalled Silverstein.
"Not the textbook.. .interesting sto
ries that use theories to describe
physics phenomena."
Her interest in physics was
sparked in casual reading and doing
experiments in class. Concerning her
belief in theory, she said, "Theory is a
set of ideas that stretches outward to
cover a lot of issues." She likes the
idea of theory being simple, beautiful
and useful.
"String theory is the best-looking
theory now," Silverstein explained of
the work for which she won the
Mac Arthur award.
This theory is about the string-like
components of matter that vibrate in
multi-dimensional space. Thanks to
recent breakthroughs in its math
ematical formulation, the theory
now looks to cover issues as big as the
unification of quantum mechanics
and general relativity, a great
achievement in the realm of physics.
When Silverstein first started on
string theory, it had several versions.
Each had a consistent framework
which incorporated quantum me

chanics.
"String theory was not as popular
as it is now," she acknowledged.
Her long-term collaborator is
Shamit Kachru, an assistant profes
sor in particle theory at UC-Berke
ley, who studied with Silverstein
under the same doctoral advisors at
Princeton University. Together
Kachru and Silverstein made re
markable progress in reducing the di
mensions required in string theory, a
process called "compactil'ication."

In the meantime, a more compre
hensive theory (conveniently
dubbed "M theory," with the M
standing for "magic," "mystery,"
"matrix" or "membrane") came out,
which assimilated all the string theo
ries into a bigger structure. And now,
"in simple situations, string theory
has been given a precise, exact defin
ition in a very surprising way," said
Kachru.
"A series of breakthroughs did
change how people look at you. In
the early '90s not so much work was
done, and now (string theory| is sud
denly the hottest thing," Silverstein
said of the response to the progress.
