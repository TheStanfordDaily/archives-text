# Spurs end Knick mania in NY
## 
### Jeff Cooper Editorial staff 
As a native of Boston, too young
to have fully enjoyed the gloating
pride of a decade of championship
basketball, far too young to remem
ber the glory days of Bruins hockey,
but old enough to bear the scars of
Red Sox and Patriots near-misses ga
lore, I found myself torn in these
NBA Finals.
The New York Knicks and San
Antonio Spurs seemed to be a pitiful
mismatch: a taller, stronger jugger
naut. that had dominated teams in
side all season, set against a scrappy,
hard-running jigsaw of a team, whose
improbable run to the playoffs
seemed destined to screech to a halt.
As I'm working in New York City.
I had plenty of Knicks coverage
swirling around me. and plenty of
time sweating in the subway to pon
der the question: "Should I Be Root
ing For The Knicks?" Within me. the
battle raged. Pro-Knick and Anti-
Knick.
Pro: The Knicks were the under
dogs. All lovable sports teams are un
derdogs. More to the point, all
Boston teams in championships, un
less they have Larry Bird or Bobby
Orr, are underdogs. How could the
true sports fan in me root for the jug
gernaut over the losers-turned-final
ists?
Con: This New York team, as the
daily coverage made abundantly

clear, was not lovable. Underdogs,
yes. But with the "reformed" Latrell
Sprewell. the arrogant Patrick Ewing,
and the insufferable whining and
showboating of Larry "Not Your
Grandmama, But Sure Plays Like
Her" Johnson, the Knicks clocked in
on the charisma scale at just under
Andrew Dice Clay.
Pro: Well, then, no need for love.
Without any emotional investment in
the game, though, surely I should be
rooting for the team that comes in on
a hot streak. The Knicks had already
clawed their way over supposedly-su
perior opponents like the Indiana
Pacers. Could I love the team that
kept winning?
Con: Ah. but the Indiana Pacers
were coached by beloved Boston
Celtic legend Larry Bird. Any defeat
that Larry suffered, my city suffered
with him. Indeed, the Pacers series
was one more reason to hate the
Knicks — they'd damaged our ex
savior. Plus, of course, San Antonio
was coming in having won 10 straight
playoff games. You couldn't get
much hotter than that.
Pro: The Knicks had ex-Massa
chusetts star Marcus Camby coming
off the bench, the man who'd
brought the Minutemen to an
NCAA final in 19%. If I could root
for Larry with the Pacers. I could root
for Marcus, the Camby-man, with
the Knicks.
Con: Of course, Massachusetts
had lost that championship, and
Camby had brought the taint of cor
ruption to the school after investiga
tions in the years after revealed that
he'd accepted thousands of dollars in
gifts from agents before he turned
pro. an NCAA violation. Perhaps I
could root for him, but it felt vaguely
dirty, and drenched in sweat on the
subway, I needed all the clean I could
get.
Pro: The Spurs' star. Tim Duncan,
had been the first pick in the 1997
draft — a pick that Boston had the
best odds to win the in NBA draft lot
tery. They'd lost (and fans around
Boston sat back in their La-Z-Boys
and sighed. "Of course"), and Dun
can had headed to the Spurs. I cer
tainlv couldn't root for the Fish That
Got Away, for Duncan represented
the lost hopes of a slipping Celtics
franchise.
Con: I actually kind of liked Tim
Duncan. He played with the expres
sion and tlair of a man filling out tax

reports, true, but he had moves like a
jaguar and a work ethic and unselfish
ness rarely seen in the slow-down,
me-first NBA of the late 90s. Why not
root for him and hope the league fol
lowed his lead?
Pro: If I couldn't love the team, at
least I could love the region. As a
Northeasterner. it stung my pride to
see some second-rate, tourist
crammed. middle-of-nowhere city in
Texas, of all places, take any sort of
championship from a proper city.
Send the cowboy-boot-shod fans
back home!
Con: It just don't work that way.
I've been raised hating the Yankees
and the Jets with such a passion that I
can't bring myself to root for any
sports team from New York. I
couldn't stand the attitude, couldn't
stand the fans, couldn't stand the
city's "We're Number One" attitude.
Oh. just because you've got eight mil
lion people, you think you're the best,
huh? Damn pushy New Yorkers.
Pro: Of course. I acted the same
way about Boston teams as New
Yorkers did about the Knicks.
Con: Yeah, so?
Pro: The Boston Globe liked the
Knicks.
Con: The New York Post liked the
Knicks.
Pro: John F. Kennedy. Jr., famous
Bostonian. followed the Knicks from
his courtside seats.
Con: Didn't I get enough of that
family back at home?
Pro: New York Knicks City
Dancers liked the Knicks.
Con: New York City Sanitation
Department liked the Knicks.
Pro: Bill Bradley played for the
Knicks.
Con: Did I mention Larry John
son?
Pro: The Alamodome's pink-and
teal color schemes is among the ugli
est in pro sports.
Con: Madison Square Garden or
ange and blue didn't exactly stand out
as a city fashion highlight.
Pro: "Knickerbockers" probably
the funniest team name in the NBA.
Con: You've got me there.
The debate seemed to rage end
less. But looking up at the"I Still Be
lieve" banner hanging off the Gar
den. I couldn't help a pang of sympa
thy for the city, that had thrown so
much into a team with so little.
But. then again, that nught've just
been the Italian sausage.
