# Young staying close to the Farm after selection by Golden State
## 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
Think tall things in the Bay Area. A few come quickly
to mind: the Transamerica building in San Francisco,
Hoover Tower and Tim Young.
While the first two aren't going anywhere in the near
future, the third is soon to be on the move. But Young
won't be straying far from the Farm after being drafted by
the Golden State Warriors in the second round of the
NBA draft held June 30.
The 7-foot-2, 250-pound Stanford graduate averaged
11.7 points and 8.1 rebounds per game during a stellar col
legiate career, in which he led the Cardinal to four
straight NCAA tournament appearances, including a
spot in the 1998 Final Four.
Young's name appears 15 times throughout the Cardi
nal basketball record book including the top spots in ca
reer games (132), career consecutive starts (125) and
blocked shots (167). His tallies include 1,544 total points

and 1,070 rebounds.
This past season, Young averaged 10 points and just
over 7 rebounds a game, a steady force in the middle of
Stanford's dominant inside game.
Young was an integral part of the celebrated Cardinal
lineup which included Arthur Lee, Kris Weems, Peter
Sauer and Mark Madsen that helped elevate the basket
bail programs to new heights over the past two seasons.
With Young in the middle the Cardinal reached the,
national semifinal game in 1998, narrowly losing to even
tual national champion Kentucky in overtime.
Pegged among the nation's top teams after returning
all five starters in 1998-1999, the Cardinal underachieved
in the post-season, losing to Gonzaga in the second round.
For Young though, it was a great ride and at the con
clusion of his career, Young took his place among Stan
ford's basketball greats.
"[Young's] a presence," said Warrior's head coach P.J.
Carlesimo of this year's 56th overall draft choice. "He's
got good size and does a little bit of everything — passes

the ball well, shoots the ball well, he can block some
' shots."
"He worked out very, very well for us," Carlesimo
| said. "Obviously we know him very well [and] he's ab
' solutely a first-rate person."
ESPN analyst Jay Bilas calls Young, "a true center
i who, at seven feet, can step out to 17 feet and hit an open
jumpshot."
For a big man, Young has the ability to both pass the
ball well and mix it up underneath the boards,
i Young, who graduated in 1999 with a degree in Eng
| lish, is the 21st Cardinal player selected in the NBA draft
! joining the ranks of former Cardinal stars Brevin Knight
; and Adam Keefe.
He is only the third player selected in the second
round of the draft along with Arthur Harris, drafted by
the Seattle Supersonics in 1968 and Kimberly Belton,
drafted by the Phoenix Suns in 1980.
i He joins five other Pacific 10 Conference players taken
in this year's draft. Highlighting that list are UCLA guard

Baron Davis selected by Charlotte with the third pick
overall and Arizona guard Jason Terry who went to At
lanta at the 10th pick.
Forward Francisco Elson of California, Center Todd
MacCullough of Washington and forward A.J. Bramlett
of Arizona were all taken in the second round along with
Young.
While Young's selection was a bright spot for the Car
dinal, the draft was also somewhat disappointing as senior
guards Arthur Lee and Kris Weems were not chosen.
Both still have potentially bright professional careers
in either the U.S. or Europe and one cannot rule out the
possibility of a future in the NBA.
Forward Peter Sauer, the fourth of Stanford's senior
starters this past year has already signed to play profes
sionally with a team in Greece.
The departure of these four starters leaves coach Mike
Montgomery to build a starting lineup around returning
power forward Mark Madsen, who is competing this sum
mer with the U.S. team at the World University Games.
