Felicitaciones, Pero Loco!
That is what Cardinal power for
ward and 1999 College Hoops Insid
er first team Ail-American Mark
Madsen is hearing on the streets of
Spain.
"Mad Dog." along with eleven
other all-star collegiate basketball
players were announced June 25 by
the USA Basketball Men's Colle
giate Committee to represent the
United States in the 1999 World
University Games to be held July 3-
12 in Palma de Mallorca. Spain.
Led by head coach Oliver Pur
nell of the University of Dayton,
this dynamic dozen including guard
Scoonie Penn (Ohio State), center
Brendan Haywood (UNC). forward
Kenyon Martin (Cincinnati) and
Stanford's Mark Madsen has seen
nothing but success along the road
to gold.
With last night's 97-88 win over
Lithuania (3 - 1). USA (4 - 0) ad
vances one step closer to its sixth
consecutive gold medal, improves
its all time World University Games
record to 106-6 (.946) and boasts a
more than impressive 36 -game win
ning streak.

Wednesday night's battle of the
undefeated teams resulted in a win
for the US, placing them in sole pos
session of first place in Pool Band a
definite medal round appearance,
in which the top two teams of each
of the four pools meet head to head.
They plan to close out preliminary
play on July <S when they match up
against Greece.
Stanford's Madsen hit 2 for 4
from the field and grabbed three
boards with one assist in his 12 min
utes of play.
In Monday night's lopsided 102-
43 game against the Czech Repub
lic. Madsen came off the bench to
grab three rebounds, steal two pass
es. block a shot, and score six points
en route. Madsen's best showing yet
was on July 4. when the US defeat
ed Nigeria 97-58. Playing 13 min
utes. he scored 2 for 3 from the
floor, grabbed four boards and
blocked one shot. How's that for
fireworks?
With twelve of the nation's best,
it was not difficult for Purnell to pre
dict his team's success. "The main
thing is that we have a lot of parity
among the group. Obviously I like
our size and ability to pound the ball
inside."

No doubt Madsen provides
much of the inside force. Cardinal
teammate David Moseley sees that
as a key asset Madsen provides the
U.S. team. "[Madsen] is a force on
the hoards, very intense and gives
them a greater presence inside. He's
just ferocious!"
In addition to his strength, Mad
sen has proven to be a gracious
leader and dedicated player on and
off the court. "They chose [Madsen]
because he's a great spokesperson
for our country," said senior for
ward Ryan Mendez. 'i admire his
work ethic. He looks ahead of him
and gives it all he's got. He com
mands leadership and respect."
Moseley agrees. "As a representa
tive for the U.S., [Madsen] breaks
down stereotypes."
Men's Basketball Assistant
Coach Eric Reveno sees this experi
ence as one of growth and develop
ment for Madsen that will benefit
his play and overall team perfor
mance next year.
"[Madsen] is at the verge of be
coming one of the elite top 10-15
best players in the country. He's
right there. His attitude makes him

team."
Of course, growth comes with
work, raising the bar.
"Hopefully he's getting a good
mix of being excited and being chal
lenged with this opportunity to
compete with the best. With a guy
like [Madsen], having his weakness
es exposed is tremendous. He has
the drive to work on those and be
come even more dedicated that he
already is," Reveno added.
"This will add another dimen
sion to his game. 1 know he's work
ing on that outside jumper and play
ing with these guys will help him de
velop different aspects of his game."
Moseley said.
Reveno agrees, "We always like
it when our guys have the opportu
nity to play internationally. It gives
us more experience and allows
them to develop their skills more. It
is great competition on a daily basis

that really tests them."
Yet above all the leadership and
technical skills on court, it all comes
down to food and culture.
"Half jokingly, I'd say [the USA
Basketball Committee] chose
[Madsen] because he speaks Span
ish and he likes to talk. I bet he's the
team translator," Reveno joked.
"I'm really looking forward to
going back to Spain," said Madsen,
who served his Mormon mission in
Spain. "It's a great country with

In answering what the thing he
likes most about sports is, Madsen
said, "The camaraderie of a team
and having the opportunity to com
pete."
It is no wonder Moseley says "we
have been through so much, and re
ally bonded. You feel like he's your
brother. You play for each other."
With the experience Madsen and
incoming freshman Casey Jacobsen
are gaining playing in the Men's and
Junior Men's World University
Games, next year's Cardinal Squad
should be ready to take on the
World.
Quarterfinals will be held Satur
