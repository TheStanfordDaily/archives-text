United States in the 1999 World

Led by head coach Oliver Pur
nell of the University of Dayton,
this dynamic dozen including guard
Scoonie Penn (Ohio State), center
Brendan Haywood (UNC). forward
Kenyon Martin (Cincinnati) and
Stanford's Mark Madsen has seen
nothing but success along the road
to gold.
With last night's 97-88 win over
Lithuania (3 - 1). USA (4 - 0) ad
vances one step closer to its sixth
consecutive gold medal, improves
its all time World University Games
record to 106-6 (.946) and boasts a
more than impressive 36 -game win

Wednesday night's battle of the
undefeated teams resulted in a win
for the US, placing them in sole pos
session of first place in Pool Band a
definite medal round appearance,
in which the top two teams of each
of the four pools meet head to head.
They plan to close out preliminary

Stanford's Madsen hit 2 for 4

thing is that we have a lot of parity
among the group. Obviously I like
our size and ability to pound the ball
inside."

No doubt Madsen provides
much of the inside force. Cardinal
teammate David Moseley sees that
as a key asset Madsen provides the
U.S. team. "[Madsen] is a force on
the hoards, very intense and gives
them a greater presence inside. He's
just ferocious!"
In addition to his strength, Mad
sen has proven to be a gracious
leader and dedicated player on and
off the court. "They chose [Madsen]
because he's a great spokesperson
for our country," said senior for
ward Ryan Mendez. 'i admire his
work ethic. He looks ahead of him
and gives it all he's got. He com
mands leadership and respect."
Moseley agrees. "As a representa

down stereotypes."
Men's Basketball Assistant
Coach Eric Reveno sees this experi
