En fuego. In the zone. II there is a
place in sports where everything goes
right. Tiger Woods is there.
The former Stanford star fired a
one-under-par 71 on Sunday to cap
ture the Motorola Western Open title
and regain the number one spot in the
world rankings, overtaking David
Duval.
He finished at 15-under, 273 for
the event, winning his second West
ern Open crown on the 7,073 yard
Dubsdread Course at Cog Hill Golf
and Country Club, his tenth career
victory.
If Tiger continues his play over the
last month, he will need an addition to
his house to store all the giant card
board checks and tournament tro

The win was Woods' third in his
last four weeks of play, as he previ

event in Germany and the Memorial
Tournament crown. The lone blem

His performance also firmly estab

the eight tournaments in which he has
taken a lead into the final round. Play

learning that when Tiger is in the lead,
the real tournament may be for sec
ond place.
"I love feeling the pressure. I love
it," Woods said with a smile afer the

final round. " There's no better posi
tion than being up front. Everyone is
looking at you and you get all the
pressure in the world. You can go
nothing but down."
Weir, who began the day with
three birdies in the first seven holes,
eventually faltered on the back nine
and finished alone in second place at
276.
'it was a great experience for me,"
said Weir who is seeking his first tour
nament title, but has played well this
year.
Beginning on the eighth hole,
Woods taught Weir a lesson about
the difference between playing well
and winning tournaments.
His lead pared to one after lipping
out a birdie putt on number seven.
Woods walked to the eighth tee with
