## Tiger captures second Western Open crown 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
En fuego. In the zone. II there is a
place in sports where everything goes
right. Tiger Woods is there.
The former Stanford star fired a
one-under-par 71 on Sunday to cap
ture the Motorola Western Open title
and regain the number one spot in the
world rankings, overtaking David
Duval.
He finished at 15-under, 273 for
the event, winning his second West
ern Open crown on the 7,073 yard
Dubsdread Course at Cog Hill Golf
and Country Club, his tenth career
victory.
If Tiger continues his play over the
last month, he will need an addition to
his house to store all the giant card
board checks and tournament tro
phies.
The win was Woods' third in his
last four weeks of play, as he previ
ously captured a European PGA

event in Germany and the Memorial
Tournament crown. The lone blem
ish on his record of late was a third
place finish at the U.S. Open, just two
strokes behind champion Payne
Stewart.
His performance also firmly estab
lishes Tiger as one of the best players
in the world when playing under pres
sure.
Starting the final round with a four
stroke lead. Tiger's margin was cut to
one by upstart challenger Mike Weir.
Woods responded on the eighth hole
by burying an eight foot birdie putt.
His lead extended to two strokes;
Woods never looked back.
Tiger's victory was his seventh in
the eight tournaments in which he has
taken a lead into the final round. Play
ers on the PGA Tour are quickly
learning that when Tiger is in the lead,
the real tournament may be for sec
ond place.
"I love feeling the pressure. I love
it," Woods said with a smile afer the

final round. " There's no better posi
tion than being up front. Everyone is
looking at you and you get all the
pressure in the world. You can go
nothing but down."
Weir, who began the day with
three birdies in the first seven holes,
eventually faltered on the back nine
and finished alone in second place at
276.
'it was a great experience for me,"
said Weir who is seeking his first tour
nament title, but has played well this
year.
Beginning on the eighth hole,
Woods taught Weir a lesson about
the difference between playing well
and winning tournaments.
His lead pared to one after lipping
out a birdie putt on number seven.
Woods walked to the eighth tee with
a look of grim determination on his
face. His drive found the left side of
the fairway, and he dropped an ap

proach shot within eight feet of the
pin.
Woods' birdie putt was good all
the way as he lifted his putter in cele
bration and pumped his fist.
"It was an important hole,"
Woods said. "From a confidence
standpoint, it made me feel really
good. I could answer his birdie with
one of my own."
From there in. Woods closed the
door, making a superb recovery par
on number 10 while Weir bogeyed
and then birdieing Nos. 11 and 15.
Woods narrowly missed holing his
second shot for eagle on the par-four
18th but settled for a tap-in par and
the three-stroke victory.
Fans applauded generously as
Woods walked up the 18, a much
calmer reaction than in 1997, when
they stormed through the ropes to
congratulate Tiger on his way to his
first Western Open title.
Behind Weir, Brent Geiberger

finished alone in third place at 277.
Vijay Singh, defending PGA Cham
pion, finished fourth at 278, and
Dicky Pride finished fifth, carding a
four day total of 279.
The win returns Woods to the top
spot in the Sony World Golf Rank
ings, but Tiger looks at the victory as
far more important than his rise in the
standings.
"1 can tell you one thing that's
more important [than the top rank
ing]," said Woods, "and that's win
ning. Being No. 1 in the world and not
winning like I was doing in all of *98,
that's not that great. I don't like going
home and knowing the fact that
somebody beat me."
At Stanford Woods starred his
freshman and sophomore years,
earning first team All-America selec
tions. While he left school to become
a professional after only two years.
Woods name is found throughout the
Cardinal record book.
He captured the 1996 Pacific 10
Conference title as well as the indi
vidual title at the NCAA tourna
ment.
