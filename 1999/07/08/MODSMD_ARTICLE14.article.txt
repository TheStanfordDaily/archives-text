## Warped Tour: punk rock goes mainstream Once underground punk tour disappoints with increased display of commercialism 
### Jung Lah Contributing writer 
On July 3 the annual punk rock
festival sponsored by Vans and
known as the Warped Tour made
its way to the parking lot of Oak
land Coliseum for its fifth year of
punk rock summer camp.
At least, that's how it's advertis
ing itself this time around, and al
though the name still holds true to
some extent, the annual festival
may be seeing its last year of glory
before total commercialization
takes over.
What started out as a somewhat
underground concert tour back in
'95, featuring the likes of then-un
knowns Sublime and No Doubt,
has become a full-fledged nation
wide attraction whose lineup
sounds a lot like Live 105's BFD or
KROQ's Weenie Roast.
The crowd isn't just made up of
punk kids anymore — you can be
sure to find throngs of pre-teen girls
screeching every time a band on

stage dishes out its latest radio hit.
And walking amongst the endless
booths of sponsors, from commer
cial radio stations to the concession
stands selling $3 Gatorades, one
can truly feel like there is nothing
groundbreaking about this day
long show. Unless, that is, you're
talking about how they constrain all

musical acts to strict, half-hour long
sets in order to squeeze in as much
music as possible. Rock on.
To be fair, however, the Warped
Tour definitely still shows hints of

its former glory, from the assem
blage of athletes skating and motor
biking themselves silly on various
ramps and obstacle courses to the
variety of musical acts. In addition,
there was a yo-yo demonstration,
mod-art, paintball and a showcase
for women's extreme sports.
Since many of the bands were
playing simultaneously it was im
possible to see every band in its en
tirety, but some did make this
year's go-around. Dropkick Mur
phys, a bunch of Irish lads out of
Boston, played early in the day to
the sound of thundering bagpipes in
the background and got the crowd
fired up with their energy and East
Coast accents.
Next up was the Living End,
whose stand up acoustic bass, Aus
tralian roots, and covers of "Back in
Black" and "Tainted Love," were a
change of pace from the 3rd-wave,
melodic punk sound dominant dur
ing the day. Sevendust's mix of
metal and rap sounded like a sorry
rip-off of "Rage", but the fast

paced songs that the Vandals bust
ed out on the main stage made it
feel like a real. Warped Tour. Al
though these are hardly the Van
dals of the '80s. they played a great
variety of both old and new songs,
all with the lightheartedness that
has become their trademark.
While the Vandals were finish
ing up their set, the Bouncing Souls
were starting theirs off on one of
the side stages. One of the most fun
performances of the day, this East
Coast band, newly signed to Epi
taph, also played a nice blend of old
and new material, pleasing the pit
frenzied who fans screamed out all
of the words.
One of the day's true highlights
was 7 Seconds ripping it up on the
local stage. Fresh off recording
their first album in four years,
Kevin Seconds and his fellow band
mates embodied the old school
punk spirit in the same way they
have been doing for the last nine
teen years. Amongst the stage div
ing fans and sing-along anthems,
Kevin even stopped at one point to
tell one mosh-happy punk to "chill
out and stop being a goon." And in
true punk fashion, the band closed
their set with Kevin teaching the
crowd the words to one of their new
songs, "Here We Go Again Kids,"
which soon had the place chanting
right along with him during the cho
rus of "Here we go kids, time to
help us sing along."
The next few acts included Ice-
T, who tried to convince the audi
ence that he used to be punk back in
the day in between his furious set of
profanity-laced hip hop; Zebra
head, an Orange County band
whose mix of punk and rap is as in
novative as Sevendust's is not; and
Suicidal Tendencies, who im
pressed many with their refusal to
play their huge hit, "Institutional
ized."
Pennywise's headlining status
and new-found radio fame did not
detract from a nicely played,

though hardly standout, set featur
ing a Minor Threat cover and an in
vite for scores of fans to come on
stage and sing along to "Bro
Hymn," their tribute to dead ex
bassist Jason Thirsk. Less Than
Jake, another one of the headliners,
put on the best performance of the
day by far with a huge circle-pitting,
floating crowd bearing witness to
flame breathing, a stage diving Spi
derman. blasts of confetti and, of
course, lots of horn-tinged punk
ska. Their enthusiasm was un
equalled, and they were definitely
the band having the most fun out
there.
Blink, who once used to put
forth as much energy into their sets
as Less Than Jake did on Saturday,
sadly played only a mediocre per
formance at best, laced with jokes
about blow jobs and sex with moms.
Apart from last year's radio hit,
"Dammit," Blink basically played
only new material off their latest
album, "Enema of the State," in
cluding this year's radio hit,
"What's My Age Again?"
Unfortunately, girls showing the
band their breasts up in front pro
vided more excitement than Blink's
actual performance, and the set it
self was woefully short (as were

most of the day's sets). As Blink
ended and fans began exiting the
parking lot to go watch the A's-An
gels game. Black-Eyed Peas threw
out a nice hip hop finale, heard by
few, but epitomizing Warped
Tour's attempts at drawing larger
and more diverse audiences.
The fact that Eminem and his
"music" (which is a disgrace to real
hip hop artists everywhere) played
this year's Warped is proof enough:
Warped Tour is no longer a punk
festival, but rather, a love-fest for
the masses.
If you didn't catch it this year, it
is probably not worth going to in
the future.

sadly played only a mediocre per
formance at best, laced with jokes
about blow jobs and sex with moms.
Apart from last year's radio hit,
"Dammit," Blink basically played
only new material off their latest
album, "Enema of the State," in
cluding this year's radio hit,
"What's My Age Again?"
Unfortunately, girls showing the
band their breasts up in front pro
vided more excitement than Blink's
actual performance, and the set it
self was woefully short (as were

most of the day's sets). As Blink
ended and fans began exiting the
parking lot to go watch the A's-An
gels game. Black-Eyed Peas threw
out a nice hip hop finale, heard by
few, but epitomizing Warped
Tour's attempts at drawing larger
and more diverse audiences.
The fact that Eminem and his
"music" (which is a disgrace to real
hip hop artists everywhere) played
this year's Warped is proof enough:
Warped Tour is no longer a punk
festival, but rather, a love-fest for
the masses.
If you didn't catch it this year, it
is probably not worth going to in
the future.
