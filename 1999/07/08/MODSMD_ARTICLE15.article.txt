# Stellar cast saves Summer of Sam
## Misguided Spike Lee film entertaining yet overly ambitious 
### Eno Sarris Contributing writer 
The best thing about "Summer
of Sam" is its cast, a common fea
ture of Spike Lee "joints."
Lee's abilty to pick a good one,
which can be seen from "Jungle
Fever" to "Malcolm X," continues
in his newest, a film which chroni
cles the summer that David
Berkowitz terrorized New York as

the Son of Sam. Mira Sorvino is per
fect as the close-to-home Italian-
American princess, while John
Leguizamo is utterly convincing as
her slimy two-timing husband Vin
nie. The crowning performance,
though, goes to Adrien Brody as
Richie, a former every-day Bronx
kid that comes back with a British
accent and a new punk rock style
that blows his friends away.
Once the Son of Sam starts his
spree, the movie begins its rambling
journey. His killings create hysteria
in a little Bronx neighborhood, with
brunettes who fear his wrath flock
ing to beauty salons to dye their hair
blonde, and their boyfriends orga
nizing lynch mobs to find the serial
killer.
Lee attempts too much, though,
when he tackles the story of the en
tire neighborhood. There is just too
much to tell. The story of Vinnie
cheating on his wife could be a
movie in itself. Vinnie's depth en
compasses much of the Italian-
American story as well, with his de
sire to be a good husband and a
good Catholic conflicting with his
idea of manhood. Richie's story

could, and maybe should, be a
movie in its own right. Richie is a
great character as an aspiring star
moonlighting at a gay strip bar. and
Jennifer Esposito's performance as
his girlfriend supports him perfect
ly-
There's more, too. There's the
story of the neighborhood don,
played well by Ben Gazarra.
There's Sorvino's character strug
gling to keep the family business
alive in a recession. There's Lee's
character, a television reporter
played horribly by the director, try
ing to make a name for himself
throughout all the mayhem of the
summer of 1977.
"Summer of Sam" also tackles is
sues of ethnic, sexual and religious
identity. Ambitious, no? But a little
ambition goes a long way. For all its
failures, its length, and its some
times rambling pace, "Summer of
Sam" is an overall success. Go see
these wonderful performances from
talented actors (excluding, of
course, Lee himself) and try to ig
nore your watch.
