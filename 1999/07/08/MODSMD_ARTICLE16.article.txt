## Trip down Arlington Road Psychological thriller gets your brain moving 
### Rito Treviño Contributing writer 
"Arlington Road" is the kind of movie that
gets you thinking. It presents us with some de
cent reasons to fear local acts of terrorism —
even after the dust has settled on tragic events
like the Oklahoma City bombing. If nothing
else, this flick will make you feel slightly more
paranoid about your neighbors.
The audience feels unsettled from the very
start, when little Brady Lang (Mason Gamble)
goes walking down a picture-perfect suburban
street covered in blood after a firecracker acci
dent. The boy's neighbor, a college professor
named Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), discov
ers him and takes him to the hospital. There
Faraday meets Brady's parents. Oliver (Tim
Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack).
For Faraday, meeting the Langs is a blessing
because his own boy. Grant (Spencer Treat
Clark), finally has a peer to play with. Faraday
and his son have been living in trauma ever
since Faraday's wife, an FBI agent, was killed

by a right-wing group. Faraday has recently
been focusing his heated emotion into the col
lege course he teaches on terrorism.
Faraday begins to wonder about his neigh
bors when they act suspiciously about the mail
and during dinner conversations. He does a lit
tle digging into the Langs' past, and he doesn't
like what he finds. Naturally, Faraday doesn't
want his son around potential criminals, but his
"investigation" is getting a little intrusive. The
audience starts wondering whether Faraday's
worst nightmares are coming true or whether
his own obsessiveness is turning him into the
kind of person his neighbors should fear.
Most appealing about this movie are the
things that run beneath the surface. Like the
Langs, some things aren't what they seem to
be. "Arlington Road" moves along very pre
dictably for a while, so you're convinced that
it's your standard Hollywood "mad bomber"
or "evil neighbor" movie. But toward the end
the plot takes some wicked turns and throws in
enough dramatic irony to stun the audience
and really drive its points home.

But the problem with a complicated finish is
that it takes a while to set up. After the bloody
introduction, "Arlington Road" trudges along
for at least an hour building up the characters.
This isn't good for a summer movie, where the
viewer is screaming for instant gratification in
the form of action or comedy.
I think that people who enjoy a good psy

chological thriller will be well entertained by
"Arlington Road." It won't give you explosion
after explosion, but when the action does
come, it really counts.
