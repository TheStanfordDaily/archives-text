# The 						Art of Noise fails at "The Seduction of Claude Debussy"
## Concept album based on the life of Debussy lacks the originality and intelligence of the composer 
### Kyla Farrell Editorial staff 
"It's the soundtrack to a film that
doesn't exist that wasn't made about
the life of Claude Debussy... it's the
soundtrack to a dream the art of
noise had about a planet where the
inhabitants breathed music ... it's a
soundtrack to a film about a charac
ter searching for a script who only
has one line to say. "be natural or
die,"... it's an album about finishing
to all temperamental intents and
emotional purposes ..." this state
ment loudly proclaims the liner notes
to the Art of Noise's new album.
"The Seduction of Claude Debussy."
Give me a break.
The British band claims to have
produced the soundtrack for the 21st
century, with all the earnest self-con
ciseness of a SAT score driven high
school junior. However, underneath
the glitz and convoluted philosophiz
ing, the music incites as much revolu
tion as the background mu-zac in the
blue-beaded aromatherapy shop
where your grandmother buys her
new age bubble bath.
"The Seduction of Claude De

buss>." essentially a concept album
loosely based around the music of
Claude Debussy, celebrates his
achievements as one of the most rev
olutionary European composers of
his day and the man who "set 20th
century music on its way."
The album, produced by Trevor
Horn, opens pleasantly enough with
impressionistic piano chords, sym
phonic violins and sweepingly ambi
ent synthetic noise. The first indica
tion that "The Seduction of Claude
Debussy" is not going to be your gar
den variety waterfalls and ocean
sounds relaxation tape comes in the
first minute of the album when an
overlaid voice states, "imagine an
actor saying the following."
This assertion is immediately fol
lowed by the defining, and most se
ductive moment of the CD when an
other deep, rich male voice (John
Hurt) interrupts with, "imagine me
saying the following. When Debussy
died on March the 25th, 1918 in
Paris, it was being bombarded by the
Germans, and it was raining."
Then, an operatic female voice
(Sally Bradshaw) kicks in with the
theme that will plague the rest of the

CD. This opening brings promise —
the voices are both beautiful, espe
cially Hurt's. His seductive voice
makes you want to crawl into a warm
corner and chew on your teddy
bear's ear while he reads you "The
Wind in the Willows."
Unfortunately, his lines on the
CD are not nearly as poetic as those
of Kenneth Grahame's children's
classic. Rather, they run from trite
sayings to unnecessary babble, and
tend to distract from the music rather
than in any way augment it. Also, an
annoying trend which persists
throughout the album is his poignant
sayings which tend to be accompa
nied by dramatic pauses in the music,
followed by sweeping violins or ama
teurish synthesizer. This makes
whatever impact his words might
bring mundane and predictable.
Not every Art of Noise revelation
is as pithy as the band would have
you to believe. For example, on track
eight, "The Holy Egotism of Ge
nius," the narrator proclaims. "De
bussy understood that a work of art
or an effort to create beauty was al
ways understood by some people as
a — (long dramatic pause) — per

sonal attack (screeching dramatic vi
olins)."
Speaking of revelations, the
album hits a low point on the intelli
gence scale in track three "Dreaming
In Color." The synthesized chorus
comes across as slightly cheesy, and
coupled with a plaintive saxophone it
is a little much. As the narrator pro
claims, "our emotions take their
color from how we live, how we love
and how we dream," the chorus
backs him up with, "I dream in
color/I touch the sky/now I wonder
why/deeper and deeper in color."
Touching the sky and dreaming in
color seem like pretty cliched things
for the granddaddy of modern music
to be wasting his time with. Plus, this
track doesn't even contain the pleas
ant operatic quality found in much of
the rest of the album.
The mixed-bag track of the CD is
track seven, "Metaforce." Jarringly
placed in the center of the album, it
busts up the flow of the CD with its
"I'm ready for radio play" cheerful
ness and strange pseudo rap thread.
Much faster than the other songs
which flow together with their oper
atic voices and lack of defined begin

nings and ends, "Metaforce" comes
across as obviously packaged for
popularity. However, the lyrics are
almost embarrassing, featuring such
gems as "Yo, there's something
about the air in the evening
time/Certain sounds that 1 seem to
hear I wanna rhyme."
All this and more for you from the
self-proclaimed "missing link be
tween The Monkees and Talking
Heads, Abba and Kraftwerk. Frank
Zappa and The Archies." A bold
claim, but when it comes right down
to it,"The Seduction of Claude De
bussy" bleeds convention. It's a
pleasant yet unmemorable listening
experience. Debussy really did revo
lutionize modern music through his
rejection of the methodology of the
post-Wagnerians who came before
him. He painted with his music,
weaving together themes and instru
ments much like the impressionistic
painters of his time used distinct
brush strokes to create a unified
whole. However, the Art Of Noise
does not innovate, merely imitates.
