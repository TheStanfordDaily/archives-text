## How to choose between Stanford or adventure? Reflections inspired by the hit TV show "Felicity" on the different paths life can take 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
The premise of the popular television
drama "Felicity" is based on a seemingly
ridiculous choice: reject Stanford's academic
rigor to follow a cute stranger to New York
City.
It is a choice many Stanford students, my
self included, would consider romantic for a
moment before the thought of failure brings
us back to the gravity of our goals. Buried in
our books, we study, assured that our path to
success is certain, already paved by our pre
decessors in medical school or investment
banks. Felicity's (Keri Russell) choice is
unique and risky because she cannot see into
the future, because her reason for going to
New York City is like a schoolgirl's dream. In
a fictional situation, no one's life is in danger,
no one is throwing away years of hard work.

We get to watch her live out her fantasy, but
we learn that her life is not so different from
our own.
Throughout her first year at college, Felic
ity's adventures have brought her excite
ment, lessons, love. Her reason for going to
New York City does is not the reason she
stays, as she eventually realizes that she and
her cute stranger will not be a reality. But she
makes great friends. She falls in love with her
resident assistant. She questions her choices.
Starting to hit more close to home? I ini
tially came to Stanford for reasons I could not
quite explain. Still, now, I do not know
whether it really was the weather, the urge to
start somewhere anew, or the reputation that
had parents and relatives beaming. Or per
haps there was a different reason, a sense of
knowing that things would work out here,
that I would find everything I hoped to find.
Perhaps the same was for Felicity when

she made her choice. The cute stranger could
have been an excuse for her move to New
York City. In her heart, the choice may have
been that sense of knowing. When Felicity
began to accept that she and her crush, Ben
(Scott Speedman), would not be a couple, it is
not so much the realization she mourned, but
the loss of an idea, a dream, and the justifica
tion for making such a crazy decision.
At that moment, I could feel part of Felic
ity's innocence start to fade, and I felt sad, in
the way that dreamers feel sad when some
one loses hope in even the most foolish idea.
For it is not Ben she has lost, but the idea of
being able to control her own destiny.
We have all felt it before â€” the surprise
that our plans do not quite work out as we
had so carefully imagined. We begin to doubt
ourselves and our abilities to make the right
decisions. And soon, we look around our
lives and wonder how everything fell so per

fectly into place. Ironically, like Felicity, the
reasons I stay at Stanford are not the reasons
I came. But for whatever reasons I did come,
I know my choice was the right one.
In the long run it will not matter to Felici
ty that her cute stranger never became much
more. Soon, Ben will only be a prop for the
greater lesson behind the experience. What
she will remember is the choice that will in
fluence and shape the rest of her life. True ap
preciation of life, I hope, begins where our in
nocence ends, when we accept that our lives
are never certain. The great and minute
choices we make every day map out the paths
of our future, in ways that are irreversible and
uniquely ours.
And in our search for love, and for our
selves, what we truly seek to find is happiness
in our choices.
"Felicity" airs Tuesday nights at 9pm on
KOFY 20 (WBN).
