# You got to 'Get Skintight'
## Teen superstars return to roots with new album 
### Josh Samuels 
On "Get Skintight." The Donnas have
constructed a rich third album that's full of
fun. More professional, more sophisticated
and more original than the groups earlier
works. "Get Skintight" will squeeze the dis
dain out of any Donnas critic.
"Get Skintight" sounds like a fusion of The
Donnas' sound with that of their alter ego
band. The Electrocutes. Formed in 1993 at
Palo Alto's David Starr Jordan Middle
School, and composed of singer Brett Ander
son (Donna A.), drummer Torry Castellano
(Donna C.), bassist Maya Ford (Donna F.)
and guitarist Allison Robertson (Donna R.).
the Electrocutes were far more reliant on
noise and pain for their songs.
In 1994 Darren Rafelli, owner of the Su
perteen label, saw the Electrocutes perform.
He had been writing songs for a conceptual all
girl rock group, and asked The Electrocutes if
they'd like to record them. Because of the dis
crepancy in style. The Electrocutes chose to
form a new band around Raffelli's material,
taking on the Donna stage names.
The two bands co-existed for several years,
with Rafelli providing the material for The
Donnas original self-titled album while The
Electrocutes existed independently. Howev
er. with The Donnas growing success, includ

ing tours of Europe and Japan, the Electro
cutes eventually fizzled. Rafelli and The
Donna's co-wrote 1998's "American Teenage
Rock 'n' Roll Machine," but the tunes on
"Get Skintight" are entirely homegrown, al
lowing a distinct Electrocutes influence to
seep into the album.
Nonetheless, the typical Donnas subject
matter is still at play. With song titles like
"Hook It Up." "Hot Boxin'" and the title
track "Skintight,"' it's all about expendable
rocker boys, hot meat and smokin' cheeba for
these Palo Alto High School graduates.
The production in general is light years be
yond their earlier albums. While the campy
sound of The Donnas and "American
Teenage Rock 'n' Roll Machine" was fun. the
comparatively big sound of "Get Skintight"
packs a lot more pump. Donna A.'s vocals
have more depth and seem less forced, and
the guitar work is crisper and more sophisti
cated. The songs, while still pretty basic, are
less formulaic than they were in "American
Teenage Rock "n' Roll Machine," and the gui
tar. bass, and drum solos don't sound pasted
on.
The songs are more diverse than in previ
ous Donnas offerings as well. Cruising on a
slow, steady pelvic rocking riff and packed
with tongue-in-cheek lines like, "Am I not old
enough, am I too young/ You don't think I

know how to eat dim sum." "You Don't
Wanna Call" gives the standard '50s "I been
stood up" ballad a metal upgrade. "Too Fast
For Love" is a verifiable rump-shaker with its
soaring guitar line and singer Donna A.'s
growling vocals. It's almost pleasant when the
group tries to harmonize, and the high
pitched backing vocals that were peppered
liberally in "American Teenage Rock 'n' Roll
Machine" actually help the song. The
Donna's characteristic humor is also present
on the album, as in"I Didn't Like You Any
way": "I think that nasal spray got to your
brain/1 knew you were lame from your wallet

chain."
In "Get Skintight," the post-high school
Donna's have proved themselves a rock pow
erhouse that is actually more talented without
the help of the band's former collaborator.
Although they still have a lot of room to ex
pand musically, at the rate with which their al
bums keep improving, they will be rock titans
in no time. Throw your stupid prejudices
aside; the Donna's are gonna kick your butt.
