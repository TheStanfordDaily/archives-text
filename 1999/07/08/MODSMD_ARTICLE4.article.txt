## Dekes fail to meet requirements, lose house 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
The Delta Kappa Epsilon frater
nity will lose its house at 592 May
field, University officials in the
Dean of Students Office and the Of
fice of Residential Education an
nounced July 2.
In a letter addressed to current
DKE president, senior Patrick
Sherman, which was sent to all
DKE members via e-mail and
overnight express, University offi
cials said that the decision arose out
of the fraternity's failure to meet
four conditions that were necessary
for the Dekes to maintain housing.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Students Morris Graves, upon re
viewing the status of DKE at the
closing of this academic year, DKE
did not fulfill the minimum mem
bership requirement and did not
meet June deadlines for paying its
financial obligations or submitting
its financial reports.
The conditions, outlined in a
May 6 letter drafted to DKE mem
bers, informed them that their hous
ing for the upcoming year was con
tingent on the fraternity meeting
certain conditions. According to
Graves, some conditions were dif
ferent from those listed in the
Greek Housing Criteria to suit the
particulars of the DKE case.
"The May 6 letter spelled out
specific stipulations for the Dekes,"
Graves said. "When we reviewed
their case again, we found some
shortcomings and a failure to meet
the guidelines and deadlines we set
out for them."
House lost before
DKE previously lost its house in
spring of 1997 due to a hazing inci
dent, but regained it in the fall of
1998. Graves called the one-year
suspension "unprecedented," and a
July 1 letter from the Dean of Stu
dents Office states that "Greek or
ganizations [are] typically suspend
ed for five years."
DKE members were notified this
past April that their housing status
was in jeopardy, as a result of ques
tions concerning the Dekes' "num
bers and membership." Director of
Residential Education Jane Camar
illo said to The Daily in May.
According to Greek housing cri
teria, every housed fraternity and
sorority "must have sufficient mem
bership at the conclusion of Spring
Rush to fill the house to KM) percent
of its rated occupancy for the fol

lowing year."
After a meeting with DKE offi
cers, Camarillo said in the May 10
article that there was a "shift in
numbers" on the fraternity's roster,
bringing them to a few members
above the 33-member minimum.
This was one of the factors that
prompted her and Dean of Students
Marc Wais to allow DKE to remain
housed for the upcoming year.
"In spring, both [Wais] and I
were confident that [DKE] could
meet the conditions in their letter of
May 6," Camarillo said.
DKEs enter fall Draw
This recent announcement re
verses the May 6 decision, and DKE
members will now enter the waiting
list round of the Draw, which is the
standard housing assignment proce
dure for unassigned students.
592 Mayfield is now available as
a residence on the waiting list, how
ever, DKE members cannot be as
signed to the house, according to
Manager of Housing Assignment
Services Kathleen Bransfield.
Bransfield said that the deadline
for entering this Draw is July 9, and
that students will be notified of their
assignments later this month.
"It may be that some of the
Dekes won't be assigned in this
round either, and if that happens,
they will go through walk-ins,"
Bransfield said.
Wais said that all guaranteed and
preferred year statuses of the Dekes
will be respected.
ASSU Vice President John Mills
expressed concern about the draw
backs the Dekes will encounter in
entering the Draw now.
"They were told by the adminis
tration at the end of Spring Quarter
that they would be able to keep
their house, and to have that deci
sion reversed at this late date is truly
frustrating, given that they will now
enter the Draw at a severe disad
vantage," Mills said.
"Fraternities in general will also
most likely react negatively toward
this decision, as it does unfortunate
ly handicap the presence of the
Greek community on this campus."
Graves said that fraternity and
sorority members need to remem
ber that preferred and guaranteed
housing is a "privilege, not a right."
and that Greek organizations "must
comply by certain guidelines" to re
tain that privilege.
Mills said that he was "surprised
at the timing of the decision."
"I think most students would be

sympathetic toward the plight of the
Dekes, given that they now have to
enter the Draw at such a late date,"
he said.
Camarillo said that the Dekes
were aware of the circumstances
and risks involved before leaving
campus for the summer.
"The entire membership and
pledge class of the DKE fraternity
were well aware of the conditions
and deadlines that had to be met
and the consequences of not meet
ing them," she said.

'It was our first year back in
housing, and basically, the
University expected us to
act perfectly/

Wais said that the administra
tion's decision "should come as no
surprise," and that it was "fair and
reasonable, given the chapter's his
tory and circumstances." The July 1
letter informing DKE members of
their removal from the house em
phasized that, "DKE was given an
extension of the deadline to submit
their final roster after Rush ... no
other chapter was given such an ex
tension."
"They understood what was ex
pected, and we are enforcing those
guidelines," Wais said. "I'm disap
pointed with this outcome."

Student response to decision
Junior Tim Springer, former
DKE vice president and a current
member, was displeased with the
outcome as well.
"This decision, while legalistical
ly within bounds, violates the spirit
of cooperation that the administra
tion of Stanford University, in par
ticular the Dean of Students Office,
espouses," Springer said. "The deci
sion forces a fraternity, in its ab
sence and without a chance to de
fend itself, from the house it worked
very hard to regain."
Springer said that the violations
of the conditions were "beyond the
control" of DKE members, and the
administration should have consid
ered that.
He said that the failure to meet
minimum occupancy was because,
"two of our active members unex
pectedly deactivated. And the two
new recruits were not allowed to
take their place."
"We don't want to make people
who don't want to stay, stay,"
Springer said.
Wais said that the two recruits
were not allowed to join, because
one of the conditions stipulated in
the May 6 letter was that the Dekes
could not deviate from their adjust
ed roster, since they were given an
extended deadline to resubmit the
roster.
The letter stated that, "If at any
time before the end of this quarter,

over the summer, and through the
1999/2000 academic year the mem
bership falls below the 33 eligible
members identified on the adjusted
roster, the house will return to Uni
versity draw housing immediately."
"Part of their argument in May
was the strength of their numbers,"
Wais said. "There is always this
problem in fraternities and sorori
ties with members deactivating be
tween spring and summer. In the
case of the Dekes, it was specifically
stipulated that they could not
change their adjusted roster."
Springer also said that the reason
the financial reports were not hand
ed in by the deadline was because
one of the deactivated members
was the fraternity's financial man
ager.
"A rational being would have ex
pected that the University would
have allowed us a little room to re
group our finances after this deba
cle," Springer said. "Rather, they
applied the clause in the letter and
removed us from housing."
Springer said that the Dekes'
first year as a housed fraternity
posed certain difficulties that the
University should have taken into
consideration before making this
decision.
"It was our first year back in
housing, and basically, the Univer
sity expected us to act perfectly,"
Springer said. "We hadn't lived to
gether before. We were still learn

ing how to function cohesively even
though a lot of us were still figuring
out how it all works.
"The path of least resistance
would have been to supply the
Dekes with housing next year and to
give them a year to straighten up,"
Springer said. "If the University was
acting in the best interests of the stu
dents involved, I imagine that arbi
tration or discussion of the matter
would at least have been consid
ered."
The July 1 letter outlines "three
clear warnings" given to the Dekes
about "their tenuous status as a
housed fraternity," including sus
pension in spring of 1997 due to a
"significant hazing incident," rec
ommendations made about insuffi
cient spring of 1998 Rush numbers
and this year's adjusted roster poli
cy.
Inter-Fraternity Council Presi
dent Tim Fisher, a senior, said that
he is concerned about DKE's loss,
but hopes to gain something "posi
tive" from the outcome.
"It is pointless, 1 believe, to point
fingers of blame or see to determine
whether or not a certain process was

fair or unfair," Fisher said. "Noth
ing positive can come from such ac
tivities. If Greeks were to draw any
thing positive from this event, it
would be a heightened awareness of
the particular challenges we face as
Greek groups."
DKEs may regain house
As an unhoused fraternity, DKE
will be able to apply for housing in
spring of 2000, as other Greek orga
nizations do. However Camarillo
stated that, "they will not be given
any special status in that applica
tion."
She added that, "The DKE fra
ternity has every potential to suc
ceed as an unhoused fraternity as
evidenced by the number of healthy
unhoused Greek organizations.
Whether they succeed is truly up to
the effort that they put into it."
Graves said that the Dekes
should use unhoused fraternities
and sororities as models by which
they can pattern their activities.
"A house does not make a fra
ternity," Graves said. "It shouldn't
be about a physical location; it
should be about a spirit of brother
hood."
Mills said that he did not think
"the failure of the Dekes to meet

and maintain their minimum mem
bership requirements is representa
tive of the health of campus Greek
organizations in general."
Fisher agreed and called Stan
ford's Greek community a "strong"
one, "by many accounts, stronger
than those of most other universi
ties." However, he did express con
cern over what he sees as a trend of
the declining numbers within
Greek groups not just at Stanford,
but at other universities as well.

The DKE fraternity has
every potential to succeed
as an unhoused fraternity.'

Director of Res Ed

"[The DKE] occurrence is part
of an international as well as local
trend, a trend I find quite distress
ing," Fisher said. "The effect of this
trend is particularly acute. . .[at]
Stanford, which lacks, I would
argue, a sufficient link to the past
... The Greek community is a de
clining interest over the past sever
al years. The loss of yet another
house due to membership brings
this issue once again to the fore

front."
In a May 17 Daily article. Fisher
said that he would like to improve
the 100-percent rule, which went
into effect this past academic year.
"I do anticipate approaching the
administration with a plan next
year ... I would look forward to a
constructive dialogue," he said in
the May article.
Graves said that the declining
numbers should not be indicative of
the "health of Greek organizations."
"Membership in Greek organi
zations is at a modest level," Graves
said. "One of the factors contribut
ing to that may be the nature of the
current student body, and also that
there are many student groups
other than Greek ones to get in
volved in. But just because we've
reached a low doesn't mean that
Greek organizations can't provide
that same rewarding experience
that so many alumni talk about."
Fisher agreed.
"Greeks face an interesting and
peculiar challenge." he said.
"Greek groups face the challenge
of combating negative stereotypes
and making visible the positive
things they have to offer potential
members. To do so will perhaps be
this (upcoming) year's primary
goal."

ly within bounds, violates the spirit
of cooperation that the administra
tion of Stanford University, in par
ticular the Dean of Students Office,
espouses," Springer said. "The deci
sion forces a fraternity, in its ab
sence and without a chance to de
fend itself, from the house it worked
very hard to regain."
Springer said that the violations
of the conditions were "beyond the
control" of DKE members, and the
administration should have consid
ered that.
He said that the failure to meet
minimum occupancy was because,
"two of our active members unex
pectedly deactivated. And the two
new recruits were not allowed to
take their place."
"We don't want to make people
who don't want to stay, stay,"
Springer said.
Wais said that the two recruits
were not allowed to join, because
one of the conditions stipulated in
the May 6 letter was that the Dekes
could not deviate from their adjust
ed roster, since they were given an
extended deadline to resubmit the
roster.
The letter stated that, "If at any
time before the end of this quarter,

over the summer, and through the
1999/2000 academic year the mem
bership falls below the 33 eligible
members identified on the adjusted
roster, the house will return to Uni
versity draw housing immediately."
"Part of their argument in May
was the strength of their numbers,"
Wais said. "There is always this
problem in fraternities and sorori
ties with members deactivating be
tween spring and summer. In the
case of the Dekes, it was specifically
stipulated that they could not
change their adjusted roster."
Springer also said that the reason
the financial reports were not hand
ed in by the deadline was because
one of the deactivated members
was the fraternity's financial man
ager.
"A rational being would have ex
pected that the University would
have allowed us a little room to re
group our finances after this deba
cle," Springer said. "Rather, they
applied the clause in the letter and
removed us from housing."
Springer said that the Dekes'
first year as a housed fraternity
posed certain difficulties that the
University should have taken into
consideration before making this
decision.
"It was our first year back in
housing, and basically, the Univer
sity expected us to act perfectly,"
Springer said. "We hadn't lived to
gether before. We were still learn

ing how to function cohesively even
though a lot of us were still figuring
out how it all works.
"The path of least resistance
would have been to supply the
Dekes with housing next year and to
give them a year to straighten up,"
Springer said. "If the University was
acting in the best interests of the stu
dents involved, I imagine that arbi
tration or discussion of the matter
would at least have been consid
ered."
The July 1 letter outlines "three
clear warnings" given to the Dekes
about "their tenuous status as a
housed fraternity," including sus
pension in spring of 1997 due to a
"significant hazing incident," rec
ommendations made about insuffi
cient spring of 1998 Rush numbers
and this year's adjusted roster poli
cy.
Inter-Fraternity Council Presi
dent Tim Fisher, a senior, said that
he is concerned about DKE's loss,
but hopes to gain something "posi
tive" from the outcome.
"It is pointless, 1 believe, to point
fingers of blame or see to determine
whether or not a certain process was

fair or unfair," Fisher said. "Noth
ing positive can come from such ac
tivities. If Greeks were to draw any
thing positive from this event, it
would be a heightened awareness of
the particular challenges we face as
Greek groups."
DKEs may regain house
As an unhoused fraternity, DKE
will be able to apply for housing in
spring of 2000, as other Greek orga
nizations do. However Camarillo
stated that, "they will not be given
any special status in that applica
tion."
She added that, "The DKE fra
ternity has every potential to suc
ceed as an unhoused fraternity as
evidenced by the number of healthy
unhoused Greek organizations.
Whether they succeed is truly up to
the effort that they put into it."
Graves said that the Dekes
should use unhoused fraternities
and sororities as models by which
they can pattern their activities.
"A house does not make a fra
ternity," Graves said. "It shouldn't
be about a physical location; it
should be about a spirit of brother
hood."
Mills said that he did not think
"the failure of the Dekes to meet

and maintain their minimum mem
bership requirements is representa
tive of the health of campus Greek
organizations in general."
Fisher agreed and called Stan
ford's Greek community a "strong"
one, "by many accounts, stronger
than those of most other universi
ties." However, he did express con
cern over what he sees as a trend of
the declining numbers within
Greek groups not just at Stanford,
but at other universities as well.

The DKE fraternity has
every potential to succeed
as an unhoused fraternity.'
â€” Jane Camarillo,
Director of Res Ed

"[The DKE] occurrence is part
of an international as well as local
trend, a trend I find quite distress
ing," Fisher said. "The effect of this
trend is particularly acute. . .[at]
Stanford, which lacks, I would
argue, a sufficient link to the past
... The Greek community is a de
clining interest over the past sever
al years. The loss of yet another
house due to membership brings
this issue once again to the fore

front."
In a May 17 Daily article. Fisher
said that he would like to improve
the 100-percent rule, which went
into effect this past academic year.
"I do anticipate approaching the
administration with a plan next
year ... I would look forward to a
constructive dialogue," he said in
the May article.
Graves said that the declining
numbers should not be indicative of
the "health of Greek organizations."
"Membership in Greek organi
zations is at a modest level," Graves
said. "One of the factors contribut
ing to that may be the nature of the
current student body, and also that
there are many student groups
other than Greek ones to get in
volved in. But just because we've
reached a low doesn't mean that
Greek organizations can't provide
that same rewarding experience
that so many alumni talk about."
Fisher agreed.
"Greeks face an interesting and
peculiar challenge." he said.
"Greek groups face the challenge
of combating negative stereotypes
and making visible the positive
things they have to offer potential
members. To do so will perhaps be
this (upcoming) year's primary
goal."
The Delta Kappa Epsilon frater
nity will lose its house at 592 May
field, University officials in the
Dean of Students Office and the Of
fice of Residential Education an
nounced July 2.
In a letter addressed to current
DKE president, senior Patrick
Sherman, which was sent to all
DKE members via e-mail and
overnight express, University offi
cials said that the decision arose out
of the fraternity's failure to meet
four conditions that were necessary
for the Dekes to maintain housing.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Students Morris Graves, upon re
viewing the status of DKE at the
closing of this academic year, DKE
did not fulfill the minimum mem
bership requirement and did not
meet June deadlines for paying its
financial obligations or submitting
its financial reports.
The conditions, outlined in a
May 6 letter drafted to DKE mem
bers, informed them that their hous
ing for the upcoming year was con
tingent on the fraternity meeting
certain conditions. According to
Graves, some conditions were dif
ferent from those listed in the
Greek Housing Criteria to suit the
particulars of the DKE case.
"The May 6 letter spelled out
specific stipulations for the Dekes,"
Graves said. "When we reviewed
their case again, we found some
shortcomings and a failure to meet
the guidelines and deadlines we set
out for them."
House lost before
DKE previously lost its house in
spring of 1997 due to a hazing inci
dent, but regained it in the fall of
1998. Graves called the one-year
suspension "unprecedented," and a
July 1 letter from the Dean of Stu
dents Office states that "Greek or
ganizations [are] typically suspend
ed for five years."
DKE members were notified this
past April that their housing status
was in jeopardy, as a result of ques
tions concerning the Dekes' "num
bers and membership." Director of
Residential Education Jane Camar
illo said to The Daily in May.
According to Greek housing cri
teria, every housed fraternity and
sorority "must have sufficient mem
bership at the conclusion of Spring
Rush to fill the house to KM) percent
of its rated occupancy for the fol

lowing year."
After a meeting with DKE offi
cers, Camarillo said in the May 10
article that there was a "shift in
numbers" on the fraternity's roster,
bringing them to a few members
above the 33-member minimum.
This was one of the factors that
prompted her and Dean of Students
Marc Wais to allow DKE to remain
housed for the upcoming year.
"In spring, both [Wais] and I
were confident that [DKE] could
meet the conditions in their letter of
May 6," Camarillo said.
DKEs enter fall Draw
This recent announcement re
verses the May 6 decision, and DKE
members will now enter the waiting
list round of the Draw, which is the
standard housing assignment proce
dure for unassigned students.
592 Mayfield is now available as
a residence on the waiting list, how
ever, DKE members cannot be as
signed to the house, according to
Manager of Housing Assignment
Services Kathleen Bransfield.
Bransfield said that the deadline
for entering this Draw is July 9, and
that students will be notified of their
assignments later this month.
"It may be that some of the
Dekes won't be assigned in this
round either, and if that happens,
they will go through walk-ins,"
Bransfield said.
Wais said that all guaranteed and
preferred year statuses of the Dekes
will be respected.
ASSU Vice President John Mills
expressed concern about the draw
backs the Dekes will encounter in
entering the Draw now.
"They were told by the adminis
tration at the end of Spring Quarter
that they would be able to keep
their house, and to have that deci
sion reversed at this late date is truly
frustrating, given that they will now
enter the Draw at a severe disad
vantage," Mills said.
"Fraternities in general will also
most likely react negatively toward
this decision, as it does unfortunate
ly handicap the presence of the
Greek community on this campus."
Graves said that fraternity and
sorority members need to remem
ber that preferred and guaranteed
housing is a "privilege, not a right."
and that Greek organizations "must
comply by certain guidelines" to re
tain that privilege.
Mills said that he was "surprised
at the timing of the decision."
"I think most students would be

sympathetic toward the plight of the
Dekes, given that they now have to
enter the Draw at such a late date,"
he said.
Camarillo said that the Dekes
were aware of the circumstances
and risks involved before leaving
campus for the summer.
"The entire membership and
pledge class of the DKE fraternity
were well aware of the conditions
and deadlines that had to be met
and the consequences of not meet
ing them," she said.

Wais said that the administra
tion's decision "should come as no
surprise," and that it was "fair and
reasonable, given the chapter's his
tory and circumstances." The July 1
letter informing DKE members of
their removal from the house em
phasized that, "DKE was given an
extension of the deadline to submit
their final roster after Rush ... no
other chapter was given such an ex
tension."
"They understood what was ex
pected, and we are enforcing those
guidelines," Wais said. "I'm disap
pointed with this outcome."

Student response to decision
Junior Tim Springer, former
DKE vice president and a current
member, was displeased with the
outcome as well.
"This decision, while legalistical
ly within bounds, violates the spirit
of cooperation that the administra
tion of Stanford University, in par

In a May 17 Daily article. Fisher
said that he would like to improve
the 100-percent rule, which went
into effect this past academic year.
"I do anticipate approaching the
administration with a plan next
year ... I would look forward to a
constructive dialogue," he said in
the May article.
Graves said that the declining
numbers should not be indicative of
the "health of Greek organizations."
"Membership in Greek organi
zations is at a modest level," Graves
said. "One of the factors contribut
ing to that may be the nature of the
current student body, and also that
there are many student groups
other than Greek ones to get in
volved in. But just because we've
reached a low doesn't mean that
Greek organizations can't provide
that same rewarding experience
that so many alumni talk about."
Fisher agreed.
"Greeks face an interesting and
peculiar challenge." he said.
"Greek groups face the challenge
of combating negative stereotypes
and making visible the positive
things they have to offer potential
members. To do so will perhaps be
this (upcoming) year's primary
goal."
