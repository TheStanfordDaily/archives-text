## Future bright for graduates Technology job market especially strong 
### Joanne Wu Editorial staff 
"An English major? Well, that
sounds fun. but what are you plan
ning to do with that after you gradu
ate?"
1 his seems to be a common ques
tion asked of fuzzy majors at Stan
ford. particularly because the labor
market seems to increasingly cater
to computer and engineering ma
jors.
Yet. with the economy booming
and employment rates higher than
ever, it appears that the graduates of
1999 can enter the job market with
high hopes for success, no matter
what degree they possess.
The June 1999 statistics from the
U.S. Department of Labor reveal
that payroll employment is up. and
unemployment rates have been
below 4.5 percent since last Novem
ber. Employment in everything ex
cept manufacturing and mining has
increased..
The economy is currently "ex
tremely healthy." said Economics
Asst. Prof. Charles Jones.
Still, some students find the job
search experience to be harrowing.
Part of this bias may stem from the
fact that while the market is experi
encing growth in most areas, new
career openings are concentrated in
the information-technology field.
According to the Department of
Labor, it appears that computer, en
gineering and management services
account for a disproportionate
number of new jobs.
"There has been a recent eco
nomic boom, and this helps all areas
of the job market," explained Eco
nomics Assoc. Prof. Avner Greif.
"[However], the information sector
of the economy alone has con
tributed something like 30 percent
of the total GNP growth in the re
cent years."
With this expansion of the tech
nology market, computer and engi
neering skills are under particularly
high demand and basic technologi
cal skills are often required in any
job position.
"Job opportunities are greater
for those with modern technological
skills and aptitudes," said Prof. John
Pencavel. chair of the Economics
Department.
Certainly, companies within the
Silicon Valley and all over the Unit
ed States are looking for people
with basic computer competency.

Eileen J. Weber, director of In
ternal Operations at The Women's
Sports Foundation, an organization
dedicated to increasing opportuni
ties for women and girls in sports,
said, "Anyone above a basic clerk
must have good computer skills â€”
word processing, spreadsheet.
PowerPoint. It always depends on
the position, but technical skills are

in high demand."
"There is a notorious shortage of
technical talent in today's market
place due to the exploding number
of open positions as compared to a
limited pool of able candidates. If
viewed as a supply and demand
ratio, the odds are certainly in the
techno-savvy applicant's favor,"
said Alenda Chang, the recruiting
manager at Homestead Technolo
gies in Menlo Park, a company that
makes software for building Web
pages.
Moreover, the demand for these
skills is not limited to Silicon Valley.
"These greater opportunities for
high-tech workers operate through
out the U.S. (and in other coun
tries)," Pencavel said. "We are more
conscious of it here in the Bay Area
because of the heavy presence of the
high-tech industry in the region."
Greif agreed. "It is not just a local
phenomenon."
While most students say that the
job market did not influence their
own choice of major, they also con
cur that people with technological
majors have an easier time acquir

ingajob.
Ehrin Johnson, a 1999 graduate
in biology, said that it is "definitely
easier" for technological majors,
"especially in engineering areas
such as electrical engineering and
computer science" to find a job.
"1 found that there is an abun
dance of job opportunities for tech
majors," said senior Renny Hwang,

who is majoring in computer sci
ence.
Starting salaries in engineering
fields begin in the $40,0(X)-$50.(XX)
range. Preliminary results of a salary
survey by the National Association
of Colleges and Employers shows
that the average starting salary for
new employees with bachelor's de
grees in computer science is $44,867
per year, graduates with chemical
engineering degrees make an aver
age of $47,561, and those with elec
trical engineering degrees earn
$45,368. On the other hand, political
science graduates make an average
of only $28,873 and psychology
graduates earn about $26,545.
Pencavel explains this salary dif
ference as a way of balancing the
basic elements of economics. "De
mand and supply are equated by
means of higher salaries and other
perks for those with scarce and valu
able skills compared to those who
lack such skills," he said.
Still, the job market is not only
open to technological majors. For
