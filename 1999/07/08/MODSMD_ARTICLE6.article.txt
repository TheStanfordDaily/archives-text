# University to work with UNext.com
## 
### Abhishek Bajoria Joanne Wu Contributing writers 
Stanford is joining UNext.com,
an Internet education company, in a
venture to develop business curricu
lum that will be taught over the In
ternet.
Along with the University of
Chicago. Columbia University and
the London School of Economics
and Political Science. Stanford has
promised to extend the services and
knowledge of its professors to
UNext.com in the development of
their classes. Negotiations between
Carnegie Melon University and
UNext.com are currently underway.
With the move to collaborate
with UNext.com, Stanford is contin
uing its technologically adept repu
tation. Geoffrey Cox, vice provost
for Institutional Planning, Learning
Technology and Extended Educa
tion explains that this action is just
another step in Stanford's long
standing distance learning program.
He considers it "an extension of
an existing model." because "Stan
ford has a long history of providing
distance learning."
According to Cox. "At meetings
with faculty chairs, we've had ex
pressions of interest" about the col
laboration with UNext.com.
The faculty will work directly
with UNext.com this fall to develop
courses specifically for them and
their international student clientele,
said Cox. Kenneth J. Arrow, a Nobel
Prize winner in Economics and pro
fessor emeritus at Stanford, is on
IJNext.corn's academic advisory
board. The courses will be broadcast
over the Internet to customers of
UNext.com worldwide.
The students enrolled in these
courses, however, will not receive
Stanford University credit, nor will
they have any direct contact with the
professors. Students at Stanford will
be an external group and will not be
affected by these happenings, said
Cox.
UNext.com does plan on creating
a new university named Cardean
University that will provide credit
for the courses taken online.
UNext.com will pay Stanford di
rectly for the services provided and a
right to use the University logo.
"The profits will come back to the
University for distribution like other
revenue, but it has not yet been de
termined to which specific area the

money will go," Cox said.
Furthermore, as reported in the
Chronicle of Higher Education,
each participating institution will re-

ceive royalties
amounting to a
minimum of $20
million over five
to eight years.
Also, if
UNext.com goes
public, the univer
sities could con-

vert the royalties into stock, giving
them opportunities to profit from
Wall Street's fever for Internet start
ups.
Computer Science and Electrical
Engineering Prof. Mary Baker said
that any profit the University makes
usually "comes back to the depart
ments and professors. Typically,
[distance learning programs] work
out well."
Compensation for individual pro
fessors has yet to be determined.
The professors who will participate
in this program have not been cho
sen either.
At the University of Chicago, the
universities' involvement with the
start-up company is hotly debated
bv some professors. One point of
contention is that one of the three
principle owners of UNext.Com was
Michael Milken, a Wall Street fi
nancier who paid more than $1 bil
lion in fines for securities law viola
tions in the 19S()s.
However. Cox explained that
Milken's original share in the com
pany has been bought out. so Milken
is no longer a participant in
lJNext.com.
Even though that gray area has
been resolved, for the University of
Chicago, there are other issues to de
bate. UNext.com is based in Illinois,
and the president of the company.
Andrew Rosenfield. is a trustee of
the University of Chicago. There
fore, it was called into question
whether it was appropriate for him
to be profiting personally from his
ties to the university. Furthermore,
several prominent faculty at the Uni
versity of Chicago are investors in
the firm, so they stand to gain from
the company's involvement with the
university as well.
Marvin Zonis. a business school
professor at the University of Chica
go. said in a previous statement to


Cox
The Chronicle that, "the issue of the
University of Chicago lending its
name to another institution to make
a profit is a very problematic issue."'
While the controversy over using
a university's name and education
for the purpose of profit remains in
contention in Chicago, at Stanford,
there has not been much debate
over the issue.
Cox explained that the heavy de
bate over UNext.com taking place
in Chicago has to do with the fact
that "people in the company have
closer ties to the University of
Chicago."
Here at Stanford, connections to
the company are not a concern, and
Rosenfield also said in a previous
statement to The Chronicle that
Milken plays no active role in
UNext.com.
The professors at the University
of Chicago ask if it is acceptable for
a university to sell its professors'
work and then hope to use it for high
profits on Wall Street.
But Cox said he was unaware of
complaints from any of the faculty
and said, "we [the faculty and staff]
are enthusiastic about it."
