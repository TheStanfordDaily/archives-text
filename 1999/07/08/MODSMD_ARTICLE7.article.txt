## Stanford Bursar plays with fire 
### Jill Singer 
Have you ever wondered what
Stanford administrators do in their
spare time? Can you imagine Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya tooling around a racetrack
or President Gerhard Casper boo
gie-boarding on a Saturday after
noon?
"You'd be surprised at some of
the hobbies," said Jon Erickson.
University Bursar. "Some people
like to fly, so they have a private air
craft that they fly around. Some like
skydiving or rock climbing. I just like
to blow things up."
Firecrackers, that is. It seems that
the University Bursar is in fact a li
censed pyrotechnics expert on the
side— a lucrative avocation that
found him in charge of one of the
Peninsula's main Fourth of July fes
tivities.
Erickson recently put in a lot of
his off-hours into his hobby after the
Downtown Association of San Jose
hired him to help execute theFourth
of July fireworks extravaganza for
the city of San Jose, held at
Guadalupe River Park. He calculat
ed that about 18 hours of manpower
was needed for each minute of the

18-minute show, and that 20 py
rotechnicians were on hand to help.
They started initial set-up Saturday
morning, and were on site by 9 a.m.
Sunday, loading every shell by hand.
The spectacle got underway at

around 9:35 p.m. Erickson said that
two different types of fireworks dis
plays are popular. One kind, a static
display where the fireworks go off
like a billboard, was not used this
year.
"We did not do that," Erickson
explained. "We used aerial
fireworks exclusively, the kind that
you can see shoot into the sky. We
shot off about 8(X). or about half a

ton of fireworks up in the sky. It was
a good-sized show."
About 60,(XM) spectators crowded
into the park itself and thousands of

others who were
within a mile ra
dius were able to
see the sparkling
bursts of fire in the
night sky. In addi
tion, as most popu
lar fireworks
shows in recent
years are coordi-

nated with music, the soundtrack for
the show was simulcast on KGO
FM.
So, what was Erickson's role in all
this fanfare? He does not work indi
vidually nor is he connected with a
specific company He jokingly called
himself "an independent contrac
tor" and explained that this unusual
freelance work is "just something
I've done as a hobby for 20-some
odd years now."
He laughed and said, it's "not ex
actly an employment opportunity
like working for the University."
Erickson is also involved in coor
dinating shows at Stanford. He put
