## NBA finals put Big Apple in the Spotlight Spurs end Knicks' dream run 
### Jen Labrocca 
I don't know if anyone realizes
what the New York Knicks have ac
complished. They have dreamed the
impossible dream.
The Knicks were the eighth seed
coming into the playoffs - the last
seed. They were the team that was
looked upon as an easy win on the
road to a championship ring. Howev
er. they had finished the regular sea
son with a 6-2 run. They were an
eighth seed on their way up.
Miami, the Eastern Conference
regular season champion, was re
warded with a number one seed and
what should have been a first round
cake walk against the Knicks. They
got a bit more than bargained for.
The Knicks-Heat series was made
even more intriguing by the matchup
of coaches as Miami was led by Pat
Riley, the former Knicks coach who
had left the Big Apple for sunny
weather and what he believed was a
better shot at another championship
ring.
Although I still love Pat Riley,
every time the Knicks play the Heat,
I want to be able to say that I told you
so.
Watching Allan Houston's
buzzer-beating running jumper fall
into the net to give the Knicks the se
ries title in a nail-biting fifth game ,
one thought stood out in my mind.
Pat Riley, I told you so.
As if the David and Goliath victo
ry over the top-seeded Heat was not
enough, the Knicks continued their
improbable run with a sweep of the
Atlanta Hawks. They steamrolled
the fourth seed in four games. This
was the first time an eighth seed ever
made it to the Conference Finals.
Next upon New York's hit list was
none other than the Indiana Pacers.
Other than maybe the Red Sox, there
is no team that is more hated in New
York. Again and again, the Pacers
have dashed New York star Patrick
Ewing's championship hopes.
As if the Knicks were not playing
against the odds already. Ewing tore
his Achilles tendon in Game 2,
knocking him out for the rest of the
series. Without the 7-foot center, the
Pacers were probably counting on a
run away series victory.
Just when you thought things
could not get any worse for the
Knicks. they did. Larry Johnson, who
had been a consistent force in the

paint and had begun to find his range
from beyond the three point line, in
jured his knee early in the second
quarter of game 6.
But. Ewing had told the team to
bring him his ring, and the team lis
tened. In six games, the Little Engine
that Could did it again. The Knicks
took the series 4-2. Reggie Miller
would have to wail another year to
make choking signs at Spike Lee.
Even avid Knicks fans were just
hoping for a victory here and a victo
ry there. No one expected them to
beat Miami, then Atlanta and then
Indiana. After each series, people
were just waiting for the run to end.
But now the Knicks had made it
all the way to the NBA finals. If you
were not a believer before, you were
one now.
It hurt me to hear NBC calling the
Spurs and Knicks matchup worse
than the Alamo. Had they been
watching the same team that I had?
It was obvious after watching the
first quarter of play in Game 1 that
the Knicks were not going to fall like
the Texans at the Alamo. The Knicks
were up by six to end the first quarter
of play.
Unfortunately, after the first two
games in San Antonio, the Spurs led
the series 2-0: I had friends getting
out their brooms. Allan Houston told
them to put those away.
In Game 3, Houston had 34 to
bring the Knicks a
89-81 victory at Madison Square
Garden, ending the Spurs' playoff
win streak at 12. Knicks fans had re
newed hope and Spurs fans felt a lit
tle more fearful.
The Spurs went on to take the
next two games and won the series
and championship 4-1. The Knicks
faced a daunting team. The Spurs are
one of the tallest teams in the league,
with star forward Tim Duncan at 7-
foot playing right next to 7-foot-1
David Robinson in the league's most
dominant frontcourt.
The Knicks are one of the shortest
teams in the league with Patrick
Ewing. Without him, their most dom
inant inside force is journeyman
Chris Dudley.
I saw a sign in the crowd during a
game in San Antonio that said, "It's
All About Heart." The funny thing
was it was a Spurs fan who held the
sign.
The Spurs do have heart, especial
ly David Robinson. But, I'm not sure

if that sign belonged at a game in
which the Spurs were playing the
Knicks.
If any team has demonstrated
heart throughout the playoffs, it has
been the Knicks. Against unfath
omable odds, the Knicks made it to
the finals. No matter what the an
nouncers said, no matter what the
fans said, no matter what anyone
said, the Knicks believed in them
selves. They proved it to everyone
else that they deserved to be there.
Although I first believed it to be
an insult, the series did turn out much
like the battle of the Alamo. The
Knicks. like the ragged band of Tex
ans, fought courageously to the end.
But they were no match for the big
ger, stronger San Antonio team.
One player from the list of great
players who never won the NBA
Championship was to be taken off
the list this year: either Robinson or
Ewing.
After ten years of battling with
criticism, hardship, and injury, the
Admiral now has the ring on his fin
ger. Congratulations David Robin
son. You deserve it. Congratulations
San Antonio Spurs. You must de
serve it — you beat the New York
Knicks.
Even though Ewing did not get his
ring and the Knicks lost against the
Spurs, I am proud to be a New York
Knicks fan. Wear your Knicks t-shirts
and jerseys with pride.
