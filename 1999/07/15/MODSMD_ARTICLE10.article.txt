## 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
Translate "mad dog" into Spanish
and you get "pero loco." Pair Mark
"Mad Dog" Madsen of Stanford with
a squad of elite players from other
universities around the country and
that translates into a gold medal.
The United States squad did just
that in capturing the title at the World
University Games in Palma de Mal
lorca. Spain on July 12.
The U.S. capped an undefeated
run through the tournament by win
ning the gold medal game 79-65 over
Yugoslavia. The win gave the U.S. its
sixth consecutive World University
Games championship and extended
its current win streak to 40 games.
"I'm both ecstatic and relieved to
get the gold," said U.S. coach Oliver
Purnell of the University of Dayton
after the final game. "I'm just very
pleased to continue to make U.S.A.
basketball the number one basket
ball program in the world.
"I'm happy with the players. I just
told them that I enjoyed the ride. It
was a pleasure coaching them and
just a great experience for me," he
added.

The U.S. team started the game
hot on both ends of the floor, shoot
ing 58.1 percent from the field in the
first half, while holding the Yugoslav

side to just 31 points.
The push to the gold was punctu
ated by a strong second half perfor
mance by the U.S. team. Leading 42-
31 at halftime. the U.S. opened with a
13-2 run over the first six minutes of
the second half, creating a lead that
the Yugoslavian team could never
erase.

The U.S. led 79-59. with just over a
minute to play before a final six point
eruption from Yugoslavia trimmed
the final margin to 14 points.
"I felt that if we came and played
pretty solid basketball we would win
here tonight," Purnell said. "And we
played more than solid basketball.
"Our defense was as good as it's
been. To hold them to 31 points in the
first half and then to hold them to
about one field goal in the first seven
minutes of the second half was the
ballgame," he said.
In the final the U.S. was led by for
ward Kenyon Martin of Cincinnati,
who paced the team in scoring for the
third consecutive game. Martin
poured in 21 points and pulled down
seven rebounds against Yugoslavia.
Martin's teammate Pete Mickeal
followed with 12 points on four of five
shooting from the floor, while Matt
Santangelo of NCAA tournament
Cinderella Gonzaga finished with
nine points.
For the second straight game, col
legiate star Scoonie Penn. who led
Ohio State to a Final Four appear
ance this year, was unable to play due
to a stomach illness. His replacement,
Erick Barklev of St. John's, filled his

shoes well, scoring seven points,
while dishing off 10 assists, one shy of
the tournament record set by Andre
Goode of the U.S. in 1983.
Stanford's Madsen was limited to
just six minutes of playing time in the
final game but pulled down two re
bounds. He was unable to convert on
two field goal attempts.
Despite the somewhat limited
playing time, Madsen comes away
from the tournament with a tremen
dous sense of accomplishment as well
as experience as he returns for his se
nior season to lead the Cardinal.
"It's an unbelievable feeling."
Madsen said after the game. "I never
dreamed I would be able to go up to
the podium and accept the gold
medal for the U.S.A.
"It was a tremendous journey;
everyone on this team contributed. It
was wonderful to just come together
as a team and just make this happen,"
he said.
Men's basketball Assistant Coach
Eric Reveno sees this experience as
one of growth and development for
Madsen that will undoubtedly add to
both his play and his leadership abili
ties on the court.
"[Madsen] is at the verge of be

coming one of the elite top 10-15 best
players in the country. He's right
there. His attitude makes him an all
star that adjusts to fit his team," he
said.
"Hopefully he's getting a good
mix of being excited and being chal
lenged with this opportunity to com
pete with the best. With a guy like
[Madsen], having his weaknesses ex
posed is tremendous. He has the
drive to work on those and become
even more dedicated that he already
is," Reveno said.
For Madsen, the journey was a
sweet return to Spain, a country with
which he is quite familiar.
"I'm really looking forward to
going back to Spain," said Madsen
before the tournament, who served
his Mormon mission in Spain. "It's a
great country with great food. I'm
looking forward to being a member
of this team and going over to repre
sent the United States.
"To me, this is one of the highest
honors. To be able to go out there in
the name of the U.S.A. and compete
for the country is a very unique op
portunity, and I'm thankful that I
have the privilege to be on this team,"
Madsen said.
