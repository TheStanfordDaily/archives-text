Like McGwire's 70th homer,
Jordan's astonishing dunk from the
free throw line, and the 1980 U.S.

men's Olympic hockey team cap
turing the gold medal, the U.S.
women's World Cup victory should
join the pantheon of sports' most
evocative visual images.
American defender Brandi

Chastain, after driving the final
penalty kick past a diving Chinese
goalie, rips off her jersey in celebra
tion, falling to her knees before
being overcome by a wave of emo
tion and her jubilant teammates.
A crowd of over 90,000, the
largest ever for a women's sporting
event, roars so loudly that the
sound reverberates off the moun
tains surrounding the stadium.
All of this for an event that is
only eight years old, one which was
virtually unknown to the American
public until a little over a month
ago?
You better believe it.
The Women's World Cup,
played across the U.S. for the last
three weeks, created a fervor for
both soccer and women's athletics,
all of which came to a crescendo
July 11 at the Rose Bowl in Pasade
na, CA.
The U.S. defeated China in what
was to be an unforgettable and

moving final game; the two sides
battled through regulation and two
overtime periods in a scoreless
draw.
Although play during regulation
was somewhat sloppy as both teams
battled to control the ball, the emo
tion of the final minutes was
enough to last a lifetime.
The game was eventually decid
ed on penalty kicks, with the U.S.
taking the crown by a margin of five
kicks to four.
Moments before Chastain's
goal, U.S. goalkeeper Brianna
Scurry made a phenomenal diving
save to stop China's third shooter,
Liu Ying, which set up the victory.
With the U.S. shooting first, all
that Chastain, the last shooter in the
rotation, needed to do was to con
vert her effort to end the game and
the tournament.
When her shot found the back of
the net, Chastain exploded in a
wave of emotion, including tearing

away her jersey to reveal a black
sports bra.
"Momentary insanity," Chastain
said of her celebration. "I just lost
my mind. I thought, "My God, this is
the greatest moment of my life on
the soccer field.'"
"You saw the courage of the
American team today." said U.S.
National Team Coach Tony DiCic
co after the game. "They just fought
and fought and fought.
"There are two champions here
today, and only one is taking home
a trophy," he said.
"Each of us have hearts too large
for our chests," said an emotional
Chastain after the win.
Following the game, fans rained
confetti on the players who ran a
victory lap carrying three large
American flags amidst chants of
"U-S-A".
It was a proud moment for
America, for women and for sports
â€” an image that will last a lifetime.
