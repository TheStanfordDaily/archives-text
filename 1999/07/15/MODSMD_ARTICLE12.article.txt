## Ani DiFranco: folksinger turned rock star Singer dishes out funk and free speech generously at recent concert 
### Kyla Farrell Editorial staff 
So, you thought Ani DiFranco
had sold out didn't you? Just writ
ten her off as anothei tragic loss of
individualism to the music busi
ness? Or that she was getting old,
with her husband, her three-piece
backup band and her shiny pop
songs?
DiFranco just proved you wrong
at her July 9 show at Berkeley's
Greek Theater. She may not be the
scrappy little punk that she used to
be, but Ani has matured into some
thing even better — a scrappy little
rock star.
Having come a long way from
the 19-year-old strumming her gui
tar at open mikes, DiFranco now
may be the biggest independent
label artist to play large venues.
And this concert showed the influ
ence of that fame, from the TV
cameras and bright lights to the
massive sound equipment and
three-piece back up band. She
summed up her transformation in
the following lines, sung during

"My 10": "See where I have
grown/I have grown in front of
you."
And grown she has. Despite her
diminutive stature, Ani fills the en
tire stadium with her presence. She
displayed incredible control over
the audience, holding them silent
and on the brink of tears one mo
ment and ready to jump up and jam
the next.
James Brown's former saxo
phonist. Maceo Parker, set the tone
for most of the concert with his
hour-long opening set of funk and
soul. Parker's band was tight, spin
ning out scrumptious James Brown
and Parliament licks, as well as
their own tunes. Towards the end of
their set, Parker invited DiFranco
on as a guest vocalist on Sly and The
Family Stone's "Simple Song,"
(which DiFranco managed to com
plicate greatly, to everyone's de
light). The funk-folk fusion started
there and blossomed over the
course of the evening.
The funk came in full force dur
ing tunes like "Cradle and All,"
"Shy," "Anticipate" and"The

Diner." DiFranco even brought up
Parker's son to collaborate with her
on "Break it Down." As he aptly
put it, "On this stage tonight there's
a black guy, two white guys, a Jew
ish girl and an Italian girl. Music has
no boundaries."
DiFranco held her own in a solo
acoustic version of "Shameless,"
and the heavy percussion of "Not
So Soft" provided some excellent

homegrown energy.
One of DiFranco's greatest
strengths is her lyrics, and she did
not disappoint with her new songs.
She has not lost her ability to de
scribe the injustices of life with bit
ing clarity. For example, in "Hello
Birmingham," a fierce new number
about the murder of a Buffalo doc
tor who performed abortions and
the bombing of an abortion clinic in

Alabama, Ani sings: "They stuffed
God down the barrel of a gun/After
him, they stuffed his only son." In
another new song, about gun vio
lence, she offered this solution:
"Open fire on Hollywood."
The latest incarnation of
DiFranco's band forged sturdy
backdrop for Ani to shine against.
Post-Stonchansky drummer Dar
ren Hahn was awfully perky, and
bassist Jason Mercer rounded out
the band well. Keyboardist Julie
Wolf added tasteful, synthesized
burps around DiFranco's clipped
guitar lines, as well as the occasion
al stint on the accordion, as in the
rollicking Ani-Julie duet "Angry
Anymore." However, she also saw
fit to break out her pet harmonica
keyboard thing a little too often,
which was a tad cheesy at times.
The flow of her songs was amaz
ing. each one commenting on the
one before and adding to the over
all joyous tapestry of the show.
DiFranco has managed to fuse
folksy funk with rock star show
manship. The result? A more right
eous babe than ever.
