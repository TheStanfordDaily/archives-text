# Muppets don't get lost in space
## Lastest Muppet movie fanciful and funny 
### Rito Trevi√±o Senior staff writer 
1 was a big fan of the Muppet movies as a little kid. "The
Muppet Movie," "The Great Muppet Caper" and"The
Muppets Take Manhattan" were classics, and they're
even funnier to me now that I can pick up the humor
aimed at adults.
Then came the Muppet movies based on literature.
"The Muppet Christmas Carol" and "Muppet Treasure
Island" made the old stories appealing to children, but
they didn't have the originality and chaotic fun that was
born on television in"The Muppet Show."
So, when I learned that "Muppets From Space," a new
Muppet original, was being released this summer, 1 was re
ally curious about it. After seeing the flick, I'm not sure
that the Muppets are set to make a huge comeback, but at
least I can say that they've got some of that old spirit again.
In this movie, Gonzo (Dave Goelz), who has histori
cally been classified as a unique "whatever," is in search of
his true species. He gets contacted by two cosmic fish who
explain that he's an alien "whatever," and that his family
is coming to see him. He just has to make sure that they
land in the right place.
The very cool Muppet gang goes along for the ride, of
course. Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) and Fozzie
Bear (Frank Oz) give Gonzo moral support. Gonzo's
good friends Rizzo the Rat (Steve Whitmire) and Pepe the
Prawn (Bill Barretta) lend a mischievous hand, and Miss
Piggy (Frank Oz) tries her hand at television journalism by

interviewing Gonzo for a reality show called "UFO
Mania."
The villains in this movie are Ed (Jeffrey Tambor), a
government agent who wants to learn more about the
alien presence and his assistant, Bobo the Bear (Bill Bar
retta). They don't quite have the scare factor of some pre
vious baddies, but their childish antics are a good prod at
our fascination with government secrecy.
As with previous Muppet flicks, there's a handful of
crazy cameos. David Arquette plays a mad scientist who
tortures laboratory rats in a maze (one of the movie's fun
niest moments). Ray Liotta is a gate guard who gets se
duced by Miss Piggy. Even Katie Holmes and Joshua
Jackson show up for a "Dawson's Creek" moment.
While just about every Muppet from"The Muppet
Show" is here, the really funny characters are the newer
ones. Rizzo and his lab rat buddies resemble an insane mix
of prison inmates. Pepe has a little Taco Bell Chihuahua
thing going. There's even a rasta-man addition to the Elec
tric Mayhem Band.
This Muppet movie is a little too predictable (nothing
like Kermit amnesia), but it doesn't fail to be entertaining.
I only worry that this movie may flounder in this summer
of big blockbusters and R-rated comedies. It's a good
movie to take the kids to in between "Tar/an" and "In
spector Gadget," and for a Muppet fan, it's at least worth
a video rental.
