# Keep eyes open for 'Eyes Wide Shut'
## Kubrick's last masterpiece troubling but leaves viewer begging for more 
### Kyla Farrell Editorial staff 
"Eyes Wide Shut" may be the most antici
pated movie of the summer. Star cast, famous
director — you know the spiel, have read the in
terviews, gotten excited by the hype. And when
it comes right down to it, "Eyes Wide Shut"

won't disappoint, but it will leave you torn.
First off, let's deal with the sex factor. Mar
ried couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman
play married couple Dr. William Harford and
wife Alice. Yes, they get naked, and yes, they
make out. We've all seen it in the trailer. But be
yond that, the film is not all that shocking.
Actually, it's a highly moral film about the
pitfalls of extramarital sex and wandering out
side the boundaries of marriage and home. In
terestingly, it combines this with a prim, pro
family core message.
The plot, based on Arthur Schit/.ler's 1920s
novel "Traumnovelle" ("Dreamstory," in Eng
lish) revolves around Harford's sexual travails.
The film takes place in Manhattan, where
Harford is troubled by his wife, Alice, who con
fesses to an almost-relationship with a naval of
ficer.
"Eyes Wide Shut" is a deeply personal re
flection on the part of director Stanley Kubrick.
One gets the feeling that this film is a depic

tion of the mind and mores of Kubrick — the di
rector's personal attachment to this film is evi
dent through its entirety.
But mostly, the reaction to the film is some
where between wanting to see it again and being
slightly alienated and repulsed. It is definitely a
movie-to-see, but not an easy one to process.
What mostly defines Kubrick films is their

memorability, and "Eyes Wide Shut" is no ex
ception. It's a cinematic event best expirenced
for yourself — don't just take my word for it!
