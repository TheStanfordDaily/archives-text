Schultz is of mixed blood —
Mexican, A/.tec, Kickapooand Ital
ian. Born in El Paso, Texas, she has
traveled extensively in the South
west and Northwestern States to
learn more about the native cul
tures of which she is so fond. Her
own indigenous bloodline, research
and travel experiences have
brought about her specific style of
artwork.
The pieces, consisting mostly of
mixed media masks, are formed
from clay, then are fired, painted
and adorned with real horse hair,
natural domestic bird feathers and
jewelry that she makes from glass,
bone, shell, brass and leather. Each

piece is then individually hand
painted. All her masks are her orig
inal work and are hand-formed.
