## Plummer steps in as new dean of engineering 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
No sooner had he moved into his
office in the new Packard Electrical
Engineering building was Engi
neering Prof. James Plummer in
formed that he had to move again.
This time he will be moving into
the Terman Engineering Building,
as the newly-appointed Dean of En
gineering.
Plummer will succeed former
Engineering Dean and recently ap
pointed Provost John Hennessy on
Sept. 1.
"I am honored to be asked to do
this job." Plummer said. "I hope to
build on our strengths and move
forward with the help of the faculty,
administration and students."
University President Gerhard
Casper said that "[Plummer] has
demonstrated his abilities as an out
standing researcher and as a
leader."
"His interest in continuing to ex
pand the horizons of the School of
Engineering, his commitment to
teaching and his personal qualities
make him superbly qualified to be
the next dean," Casper added.
Plummer has been associated
with Stanford for more than 30
years, earning both master's and
doctoral degrees in 1967 and 1971,
respectively. Currently the John M.
Fluke Professor of Electrical Engi
neering. he has served as the Elec
trical Engineering Department
Chair since 1997.
His research lies in computer
chip technology. Specifically, he
uses a variety of materials and tech
nology to see, as he characterizes it,
"how far chips can go." He has writ
ten more than 3(X) articles and holds
several patents.
Plummer will lead a school that is
generally considered one of the best
in the country, with eight of its nine
departments ranked in the top 10
nationwide, three of them at num
ber one. The school's faculty con
sists of 68 members of the National
Academy of Engineering and five
recipients of the National Medal of
Science.
An ambivalent reaction
Plummer said that he was both
pleased and saddened when the
University president called him two
weeks ago and asked him whether
he would do the job.
"It was quite a surprise," Plum
mer said. "But how often does that
sort of thing happen?"

One might think that he would
have jumped at the opportunity im
mediately, but Plummer said that it
didn't come without serious consid
eration.
"It is not a job that I was seeking.
To be honest, I'm sad to be leaving
the [Electrical Engineering] depart
ment," he said.
"Most faculty enjoy teaching and
their research and dislike participat
ing in administration," Plummer
added. "Though I feel similarly, I
couldn't pass up such a tremendous
opportunity to build for the future
and to make a difference."
Plummer leaves the department
for the deanship during what he
characterizes "a time of internal
change." In particular, there is a siz
able faculty turnover that will re
quire about a third of the faculty to
be replaced within the next five
years.
"The decisions that will need to
be made will profoundly affect the
department for at least the next 25
years and beyond," Plummer said.
His departure also coincides with
the department's efforts to improve
the undergraduate program in elec
trical engineering. Plummer cites an
improvement in curriculum and im
proved research opportunities as
proposed changes.
"The electrical engineering de
partment will be undergoing consid
erable change in the next several
years," Plummer said. "I wish it the
best of luck."
Plans for the future
Plummer will use the summer
months to think about how he
would like to lead the school when
he takes office. Two important di
rections he sees today are biology
and faculty.
"For a long time, engineers
worked most closely with chemists
and physicists because that was the
nature of the field," he said.
"But now, biology is becoming
increasingly important. That is why
Bio-X has such potential."
Bio-X, Stanford's initiative to in
crease the amount of collaboration
among researchers in medicine, bio
logical sciences, physical sciences
and engineering, was made public
this past year.
"The [school] will play a substan
tial role in the initiative," Plummer
said.
He also sees faculty hiring and
selection to be one of his most im
portant functions as dean.
"Centers of academia like Stan

ford operate on a 'bottoms-up' type
of administration. Consequently, it
is important to have excellent facul
ty and staff," he said.
"I think that my job's greatest
challenge will be having to prioritize
all of the wonderful suggestions,
thinking strategically and making
wise decisions for the future."
With praise from his colleagues
Plummer comes highly recom
mended by colleagues and adminis-

trators.
Hennessy said that he "[is] de
lighted that [Plummer] is willing to
take on the challenge of leading our
premier engineering school. He is a
world-renown researcher, an out
standing teacher and a superb
leader."
Materials Science Prof. John
Bravman, recently tapped to lead
the new Freshman / Sophomore
College this fall, also had words of

praise for Plummer.
"[Plummer] is the gold-standard.
He does it all, extremely well. Best
of all, he's a good friend who I can
always turn to for advice and guid
ance," Bravman said.
Past administrators concurred.
Former engineering dean James
Gibbons, who held the post from
1984 to 1995, said in a press release
that Plummer is "firm, thoughtful
and can focus on what will make the
school successful in the future."
Students have also recognized

Plummer for his contributions to
the University as a whole. He has
won the Graduate Teaching Award,
the Tau Beta Pi Undergraduate
Teaching Award and a Best
Teacher Award from the Society of
Women Engineers.
A harried search
According to Casper, the search
committee was given a little over a

month to find and select a candidate
for the job.
"Their schedule was extremely
tight and [the search committee]
worked very hard. All members of
the committee displayed extreme
dedication and flexibility in accom
plishing the task during the end-of
the-year turmoil," he said.
The committee, chaired by Elec
trical Engineering Prof. Mark
Horowitz and outgoing Provost
Condoleezza Rice, had access to

the results of the last dean search in
1995 and also looked at candidates
from outside the University.
But, in the end, the committee
chose, in accordance with the last
search and a long-standing Univer
sity tradition, a candidate from the
Stanford faculty.
"[Plummer] was on everybody's
list," Horowitz said. "All the mem
bers of the committee are quite
pleased with the announcement."

challenge will be having to prioritize
all of the wonderful suggestions,
thinking strategically and making
wise decisions for the future."
With praise from his colleagues
Plummer comes highly recom
mended by colleagues and adminis-

trators.
Hennessy said that he "[is] de
lighted that [Plummer] is willing to
take on the challenge of leading our
premier engineering school. He is a
world-renown researcher, an out
standing teacher and a superb
leader."
Materials Science Prof. John
Bravman, recently tapped to lead
the new Freshman / Sophomore
College this fall, also had words of

praise for Plummer.
"[Plummer] is the gold-standard.
He does it all, extremely well. Best
of all, he's a good friend who I can
always turn to for advice and guid
ance," Bravman said.
Past administrators concurred.
Former engineering dean James
Gibbons, who held the post from
1984 to 1995, said in a press release
that Plummer is "firm, thoughtful
and can focus on what will make the
school successful in the future."
Students have also recognized

Plummer for his contributions to
the University as a whole. He has
won the Graduate Teaching Award,
the Tau Beta Pi Undergraduate
Teaching Award and a Best
Teacher Award from the Society of
Women Engineers.
A harried search
According to Casper, the search
committee was given a little over a

month to find and select a candidate
for the job.
"Their schedule was extremely
tight and [the search committee]
worked very hard. All members of
the committee displayed extreme
dedication and flexibility in accom
plishing the task during the end-of
the-year turmoil," he said.
The committee, chaired by Elec
trical Engineering Prof. Mark
Horowitz and outgoing Provost
Condoleezza Rice, had access to

the results of the last dean search in
1995 and also looked at candidates
from outside the University.
But, in the end, the committee
chose, in accordance with the last
search and a long-standing Univer
sity tradition, a candidate from the
Stanford faculty.
"[Plummer] was on everybody's
list," Horowitz said. "All the mem
bers of the committee are quite
pleased with the announcement."
