## Meningitis scare hits campuses nationwide 
### Joanne Wu Editorial staff 
A rare but deadly disease has hit
certain college campuses in growing
numbers over the past academic
year, and, most notably, in the last
month. While meningococcal dis
ease. also known as meningitis, only
affects one out of KK).(MK) Americans
annually, certain college campuses
have reported 83 cases in the past
academic year, six of which were
fatal.
These outbreaks of meningitis oc
curred at Dartmouth College, Muh
lenberg College, Eastern Illinois
University, Lehigh University, and
the Universities of lowa, Minnesota
and Wisconsin at Madison.
"There has been an increase in the
total number of cases in the U.S be
tween 1991 and 1997 by about 50 per
cent," said Dr. Robyn Tepper, a
physician at Cowell Student Health
Center.
"Over the last 10 to 15 years, there
appears to be more cases of
meningococcal disease seen in young
adults (of college age) and more
small outbreaks on college campus
es," said Dr. John Turco, director of
Dartmouth College Health Service.
At Dartmouth, there were two cases
of meningitis in the past year, one of
which was fatal.
At Stanford students have avoid
ed meningitis, at least so far.
"A meningitis outbreak can occur
anywhere. Luckily, we have not had
one here recently," said Tepper.
"Cowell is actively involved in the
surveillance of meningococcal dis
ease and other infectious diseases on
campus, in conjunction with the
American College Health Associa
tion."
Even though an outbreak has not
occurred, Cowell is taking preventa
tive measures against the disease.
"We are planning a Cowell health
flier dedicated to vaccinations, and
we will include information on the
meningitis vaccine," Tepper said.
With the increase in meningitis
cases on other college campuses, re
search has been stepped up to look
into possible risk factors in contract
ing the disease. Certain conditions
unique to college campuses lead to a
higher chance for meningococcal in
fection among students.
"It is believed that college stu
dents have an increased risk of the
disease because of crowded dormito
ry conditions, active and passive

smoking, alcohol consumption and
going to bars," Topper said.
These activities weaken the
body's immune system, leaving it
more open to meningococcal infec
tion.
In studies conducted by the feder
al Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, it was found that menin
gitis rates are particularly high
among college freshmen, especially
those who live in dormitories. Fresh
men living in dorms are five times
more likely to contract the disease
than other college students on aver
age.
Health experts believe that col
lege freshmen share a similar living
condition to military recruits, who
also experienced frequent meningo
coccal cases before 1971. at which
point they were required to be im
munized.
Health experts also said that both
recruits and freshmen live in stressful
environments and go through sleep
deprivation and altered social behav
iors, factors that may contribute to
their susceptiblity to the disease.
The high incidence of meningitis
in the college setting may also have to
do with its mode of transmission.
"Meningitis is transmitted
through droplets of respiratory se
cretions through the air or by direct
contact with an infected person —
kissing, sharing drinking glasses and
cigarettes." Tepper said. "Since the
bacteria cannot survive outside of the
body for more than a few minutes, it
is not spread by casual contact, such
as in a classroom, restroom or swim
ming pool."
One major problem with menin
gitis is that its symptoms are very sim
ilar to those of the common flu, so
that many people with the disease
never go to the hospital until it is too
late.
"Early on, this disease presents
with flu and cold symptoms but then
can lead to fever, headache and
rash," Turco said. "It is often difficult
to distinguish from a viral illness."
Twelve percent of those who con
tract the disease die from it, and
many others suffer permanent brain
damage, kidney failure, hearing loss
or limb damage that requires ampu
tation.
"What's striking about this dis
ease is its rapid progression," said Dr.
MarJeanne Collins, director of stu
dent health at the University of
Pennsylvania, in a statement to the
Chronicle of Higher Education. "In
eight to 24 hours, someone could go
from being perfectly well to being
dead."
Despite the seriousness of menin
gitis. it does have a treatment.
"When recognized and treated
early with antibiotics, this bacteria is
usually very successfully treated."
Turco said, "but often it is not recog
nized early, and then antibiotics may
not be able to reverse the disease.
What is not well understood is why
some people are able to get sick from
the bacteria, whereas most people
who come into contact with this bac
teria do not get ill."
"Five to 11 percent of people can
carry the meningococcal bacteria in
their nose and throat at any time, but
never become ill." Tepper said.
Meningitis can also strike at any
time of the year. "The disease has a
peak in late winter and early spring

but our two cases occurred in June,"
said Turco.
The recent high number of menin
gitis cases has raised debate over
whether vaccines should be adminis
tered to all students. The vaccine is 85
percent effective against meningo
coccal bacteria strains C, Y and W
-135, but not against strain B. which
accounts for 30 percent of college
cases.
Craig Roberts, an epidemiologist
at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, said to The Chronicle, "On
a nationwide basis, you're talking $65
a shot for 14 million college students
or 1.2 million entering freshmen.
That's a phenomenal amount of
money that could be put to much bet
ter use."
At the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, two to three cases of
meningitis are seen every year. This
year, three students developed the
disease, and one died from it.
"I personally think that it makes
sense for all college students to get
the vaccine," Turco said. "It isn't a
perfect vaccine, since it is effective

against only two of the three most
common types of meningococcal
bacteria, and it only lasts three to five
years, but it is presently the best we
have."
"We had two confirmed cases of
meningococcal illness in June ... the
state epidemiologist recommended
that we vaccinate all students living
on campus this summer, which ■ ~
have done," Turco added.
"The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention does not recommend
routine vaccination of the general
population at this time," Tepper said.
"The routine vaccination of college
students is currently controversial.
The American College Health Asso
ciation is making an effort to educate
parents and students about the dis
ease and the availability of the vac
cine, so that they can make an in
formed decision."
In the meantime, Tepper deliv
ered some advice.
"To reduce your risk, one should
live a healthful lifestyle — eat well,
rest, exercise — to keep the immune
system at its best."
