# Solar car team speeds into action
## 
### Michelle Wang 
The Third Degree Burner is a
sleek, aerodynamic race car built
from state-of-the-art equipment.
What sets it apart from other race
cars is that it doesn't need pit stops
for refueling. The car is powered by
the sun.
Built by members of the Stan
ford-Berkeley Solar Car Project,
the car sped into action last month
as the team competed in Sunrayce
'99, an intercollegiate competition
of solar-powered vehicles.
The nine-dav. 1425-mile race
began in Washington. D.C. and
ended in Orlando. FL. on June 29.
The race was the culmination of a
two-year project, with the first year
spent building a trailer to house the
car and the second year building
the car itself. For co-team leader
Brandon Stafford, Stanford '96, the
project was a full-time job.
"I definitely have learned more
from it than from any other class
es," Stafford said. "I get to see the
results of what I'm doing."
Team Stanley (a contraction of
Stanford and Berkeley) finished
first in the qualifiers and 13th in the
race. The University of Missouri-
Rolla won the competition. Of the

53 U.S. and international schools
that entered the race. Team Stan
ley was one of the 29 teams that
qualified to compete.
Co-team leader Alex Tung, a se
nior, manned the Third Degree
Burner along with Lawrence Ong.
a UC-Berkelev student. Materials

Science Prof. John Bravman is the
team's advisor.
During the race, solar-powered
cars drove alongside regular vehi
cles on public roads. At one point, a
van pulled up next to the Third Pe
gree Burner, slid open its door, and
videotaped the car. Small crowds of
spectators gathered, some wonder
ing if the unusual looking solar
powered cars could fly.

"Sunrayce provides students
(with) the challenge of taking an
idea from the paper to the pave
ment as they design, build and race
a vehicle that is powered exclusive
ly by the sun." U.S. Secretary of
Energy Bill Richardson said.
The Third Degree Burner was

equipped with a radio logger to
monitor the amount of energy the
car collected and consumed. The
data was then sent via radio modem
to team members who followed in a
van. The team members in the van.
equipped with computers and a
topographic map of the race route,
advised the driver.

Stanford and UC-Berkeley students work on their solar car.
Rainy weather dominated every
day of the solar car race, preventing
the cars from performing to their full
potential. During testing, the Third
Degree Burner reached a high speed
of 75 mph. but during the race, the
lack of sunlight limited the car to an
average of 18.5 mph.
Team Stanley built a car so effi
cient that it could average 45 mph on
the power of a hairdryer. The trailer,
which housed the car. had a remov
able roof allowing sunlight to enter
and charge the car's batteries.
At night, team members made re
pairs on the car and played frisbee in
their free time. Team members slept
wherever they could. According to
sophomore Joel Segre, the most "lux
urious" accommodations was a med
ical school, with couches and bath
rooms. While in Atlanta, the team
resorted to sleeping in a parking
garage. "I woke up in the morning
with a car parked next to me," Segre

said.
Undergraduate members of the
team balanced the project with their
classes, although sometimes, acade
mics were a second priority. In the
weeks just before the race, which in
cluded finals week, some students
skipped classes and pulled all
nighters, frantically finishing the car.
"My roommate always thought it
was weird when he saw traces of car
bon-fiber, kevlar and aircralt-grade
aluminum stuck to my clothes when I
stumbled into the room at three a.m.
on a weeknight," said Segre.
Returning members of the Solar
Car Project are already excited about
building a completely new car for
Sunrayce 2(K)1. The Solar Car Project
is funded by the ASSU Special Fee
and donations from various compa
nies. For the next competition, the
team will try to raise more money in
order to compete against other
schools with larger budgets.
In the 2(X)1 race, Stanford and
Berkeley will compete separately, as
each school now has enough re
sources to support its own team.
