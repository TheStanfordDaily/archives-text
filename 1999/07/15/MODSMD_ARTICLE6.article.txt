When most people brush their
teeth, eat their food or change their
clothes, they do not give a second
thought to the hands required to do
such daily activities. But Pema
Tshering probably did.
Born and raised in Bhutan.
Tshering lost both of his hands in
an accident. However, through the
efforts of the Stanford University
Medical Center, the Stanford Uni
versity Rotary Club, Swissair and
anonymous donors. Tshering was
given a pair of prosthetic arms. He
recently left Palo Alto to return to
his homeland after two months of
being fitted with his new arms and
learning how to use them.
Current technology allows pros
thetic limbs to provide fine motor
control. "With prosthetic arms and
Occupational Therapy training, a
patient can do just about anything
except play the flute or violin." said
Dr. Benjamin Mandac, the Stan
ford physician who was involved in
the initial evaluation of Pema.
Tshering lost his hands when he

was flying a kite in Thimphu, the
Bhutanese capital. The kite got
caught in some power lines, causing
electricity to come charging down
through the kite string and burning
off Tshering's hands. Both arms
had to he amputated at the elbow.
Unable to do even such simple
things as washing or feeding him
self. Tshering dropped out of
school and gave up on traditional
games such as basketball, soccer
and archery. He became an invalid,
completely dependent on his fami
ly.
The standard medical proce
dure to help such a victim in the
United States would be to provide
mechanical prosthetic arms and to
train him or her in their use. In
Bhutan, one of the poorest nations
in the world, the lack of medical,
technical and educational assis
tance for the handicapped means
that their futures are likely to be
dim.
However. Tshering. now 17.
