# Stanford community aids Bhutanese boy
## 
### Anh Bui Contributing writer 
When most people brush their
teeth, eat their food or change their
clothes, they do not give a second
thought to the hands required to do
such daily activities. But Pema
Tshering probably did.
Born and raised in Bhutan.
Tshering lost both of his hands in
an accident. However, through the
efforts of the Stanford University
Medical Center, the Stanford Uni
versity Rotary Club, Swissair and
anonymous donors. Tshering was
given a pair of prosthetic arms. He
recently left Palo Alto to return to
his homeland after two months of
being fitted with his new arms and
learning how to use them.
Current technology allows pros
thetic limbs to provide fine motor
control. "With prosthetic arms and
Occupational Therapy training, a
patient can do just about anything
except play the flute or violin." said
Dr. Benjamin Mandac, the Stan
ford physician who was involved in
the initial evaluation of Pema.
Tshering lost his hands when he

was flying a kite in Thimphu, the
Bhutanese capital. The kite got
caught in some power lines, causing
electricity to come charging down
through the kite string and burning
off Tshering's hands. Both arms
had to he amputated at the elbow.
Unable to do even such simple
things as washing or feeding him
self. Tshering dropped out of
school and gave up on traditional
games such as basketball, soccer
and archery. He became an invalid,
completely dependent on his fami
ly.
The standard medical proce
dure to help such a victim in the
United States would be to provide
mechanical prosthetic arms and to
train him or her in their use. In
Bhutan, one of the poorest nations
in the world, the lack of medical,
technical and educational assis
tance for the handicapped means
that their futures are likely to be
dim.

boy's intelligence, the professor, who
desired to remain anonymous, asked
the Stanford University Rotary Club
if something could be done to help
him.
The Rotary Club rarely helps sin
gle individuals, preferring instead to
create scholarships or support com
munity programs. Nevertheless, the
professor convinced the organization
that this boy deserved their help.
"We had the facilities to make a
difference, and we wanted to deploy
them on this recommendation," said
Kenneth Kaufman, the founder of
the University Rotary Club.
A total of $25,(XX) was raised by
the Rotary Club, Stanford Medical
Center and anonymous donors to pay
forTshering's treatment. Swissair do
nated round-trip flight vouchers for
Tshering and his older brother,
Rinzin, which were worth more than
$4,(XX). Tshering's parents were not
able to join their sons on this journey.

but they were kept updated on their
son's progress.
After two weeks of intensive mod
ifications of the initial prosthesis, the
team from Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital Rehabilitation Technology
and Therapy Center spent nearly two
months working with Tshering to
train him in the use of his new arms
and hands.
While here, the Tshering brothers
did have their share of fun. Coming
from a landlocked country, Pema and
Rinzin were able to visit their first
beach here, as well as watch such
summer movies as "Star Wars:
Episode 1 —The Phantom Menace."
"I think there was a significant cul
ture shock coming here," said Man
dac, "but they seemed to adapt well."
The brothers left on a June 17
flight back to Bhutan, where Tshering
plans to return to school and perhaps
become an engineer.
"Doctors tell me," said Tshering to
the University Rotary Club, "that
once I'm trained to use my new arms,
I will be able to do anything I want
to."
