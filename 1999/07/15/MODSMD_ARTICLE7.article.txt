# Stanford Hospital nurse uses humor to heal
## 
### Jill Singer 
According to Patty Wooten, a re
lief nurse at Stanford University Hos
pital, laughter may really be the best
medicine.
The phrase is cliche, and the idea
may sound outdated, especially in
today's society, where pain is regard
ed as an enemy that can often be van
quished with a simple pill. But in re
cent years, research has begun to
show that humor may indeed have
the power to heal.
"Before you can use humor in a se
rious setting like health care,"
Wooten said, "you must know your
audience." She said that it is impor
tant to assess whether the patient and
the family are open to humor as ther
apy."
Wooten has long been a supporter
of humor-based healing. In fact, nurs
ing is not Woolen's only passion —
she is also a trained clown and the for
mer president of the American Asso
ciation for Therapeutic Humor. In ad
dition she is the founder of a company
called Jest For the Health of It, a busi
ness that provides education and con
sultation services to help people un
derstand and harness what she calls

"the therapeutic value of laughter."
Wooten is well-known and well
received in this area of study. She
often educates patient support groups
and doctors nationwide and interna
tionally about "how they can use
humor in an appropriate manner."
In her lectures she not only focus
es on healing illnesses, but also on pre
venting and coping with stress and
avoiding burnout — all done, of
course, through laughter and positive
emotions.
This theory has recently gotten a
pop-culture boost with the release of
"Patch Adams," starring Robin
Williams. The movie depicts the real
life story of a clown-physician named
Patch who encourages a humorous,
personalized approach to medicine.
Wooten has always taken a per
sonal approach to medicine — in her
thirty years as a nurse, she has worked
in critical care, in hospices and in
homes. Now she uses her gentle, jest
ing bedside manner to help comfort
patients at the hospital. Wooten en
gages her skills as a clown and as a hu
morist to help break bad news, to pro
vide distractions from pain and to ac
tually create biochemical change.
Some of the most profound re

search in this field is being done by
clinical immunologists who seek to
identify the biochemical changes that
occur after laughter. Studies have
found, says Wooten, that laughter re
sults in a decrease in serum Cortisol, a
substance that increases with stress,
which weakens the immune system.
In a similar way, laughter, humor and
positive emotions are used as an anti
dote to stress and illness, biologically
strengthening the power of the im
mune system.
However, not ali patients are open
to this sort of comical approach.
"Start small," Wooten advised.
"Share a cartoon. Use a one-liner to
see if they laugh ... If they give you
humor back again, then that shows to
me that they are willing to share in this
joking repartee."
"The work is serious, and the situ
ation is serious, but quite often, the
patients welcome the comic relief,"
she said.
However, she noted that, "It's im
portant to take care of [the patient's]
physical and emotional comfort first
before you think about using humor."
Wooten became interested in this
field 22 years ago, when she was going
through a tough time in her own life.

She had recently been divorced and
was raising a three-year-old son on
her own. Working in a brain surgery
Intensive Care Unit only served to
deepen her depression.
"What I did for my own mental
health (was that) I went off to clown
school," she said.
As a clown, she found that she had
a profound effect on patients, espe

dally those in nursing homes. She
eventually did her own research to
discover whether this kind of thera
peutic humor can help professionals
with burnout.
Wooten has written two books:

Compassionate Laughter: Jest For

area of laughter therapy, Norman

Cousins was the editor of the
"Saturday Review" in the l%()s.

a seemingly irreversible connective
tissue disease. He took control of
his condition and hoped to capital
ize on the capacity of the human
body to transform positive emo
tions into tangible, biochemical
change.
Cousins devised a regimen that
stressed the interplay between mind
and body in an illness.
His ideas stemmed from a com
mon belief that is especially touted b\

textbook: 'if negative emotions can
cause distress, then positive emotions
can enhance the healing process."
