# Stanford land acts as conservation site for native birds
## 
### Uma Sanghvi 
Recent work by the Santa Clara
Valley Audoban Society
(SCVAS), in conjunction with
Stanford, has resulted in a record
number .of births among threat
ened bird species native to the
Stanford area.
For three years, Stanford land
has been the site of a conservation
initiative to counter an alarming
decline in numbers of native "cav
ity nester" birds.
These birds require a protected
hole in which to make their nest
and have witnessed a reduction in
population due to the degradation
of their natural habitat and compe
tition from aggressive, non-native
species.
Orchestrating the effort to as
sist native populations of cavity
nesters are Garth Harwood and
Carol Hankermeyer, volunteer co
coordinators of the SCVAS Blue

bird Recovery Program.
Perhaps the best-known of the
cavity nesters are bluebirds.
SCVAS chose to headline this bird
in spearheading efforts to recover
populations of native cavity
nesters because, as Hankermeyer
explained, "Bluebirds are charis
matic, high-profile birds. They ap
peal to people."
"While bluebirds are our mar
quee bird, we are just as excited
about the other species of cavity
nesters," Harwood added. "In fact,
lesser-known birds such as the
chestnut-backed chickadee and
American Kestrel have experi
enced rates of decline more than
twice that of the Western Blue
bird."
Other native cavity-nesters, like
the Kestrel and Ash-throated Fly
Catchers are targeted by SCVAS
as well.
"The decline in bluebirds is a di
rect result of human develop

ment," Hankermeyer said. "As we
get more 'civilized,' we are seri
ously impacting the cavity nester
habitat. For example, when dead
trees are removed, potential nest
ing sites for these birds are elimi
nated."

Hankermeyer also cited
the decline of farming

communities and
trends such as a

preference for

I
metal fence
posts instead
of the older
wooden ones
as part of the
environmen
tal stress

faced by cavity
nesters.

"Rapid increases in pop
ulations of European bird species
like the Starling and English
House Pharaoh also put pressure
on native bird species," Harwood

said.
For years, SCVAS has recog
nized the open grasslands of Stan
ford as a prime habitat for resusci
tating the waning population of
Western Bluebirds and other cavi
ty nesters.

"We see Stanford land
holdings as being partic
ularly important be
cause they are situat
ed in a highly urban
ized area, yet these
are some of the most
underdeveloped land

holdings on
the urban
ized penin
sul a , "
Harwood

said.
In 1997 SCVAS obtained a per
mit from the Stanford Manage

ment Co. to establish a bluebird
"trail" in the satellite dish area at
Stanford. This trail consists of tree
nest boxes, which accomodated
adult bluebirds and denied access
to larger species of birds. These
nest boxes serve as protected cavi
ties for bluebirds to nest and raise
young.
Monitors observe nest boxes
for activity and check for nests,
eggs and newly hatched chicks.
They also record the numbers of
fledglings, or baby birds who have
just left the nest.
In 1998 monitors counted 32
bluebird fledglings and 16 violet
green swallow fledglings in the
Stanford dish area alone, a result
that is encouraging for Bluebird
Recovery Program coordinators.
"Stanford Management Co. has
played a great role in this area by
permitting us to put boxes up. We


Samuel Kim — Daily
have seen good numbers of fledg
lings from Stanford boxes," Han
kermeyer said.
Field monitors Michael Arago,
Mary Beth Arago and Dave
Weber have witnessed the daily
life-and-death struggle of these
native birds to conquer the odds.
"Competition in the area is
fierce, especially with the intro
duction of aggressive European
species like Starlings," Michael
Arago said.
Arago said the other major
threat to the survival of the birds is
predatory mammals. "Raccoons
are fairly acrobatic; they climb
well with their sharp claws, and
have long arms to reach inside the
nest box holes."
Arago attributed the presence
of raccoon-related predation on
one section of the trail to the pres
ence of human residences in that
area, whose debris attracts rac

coons.
Modifications are currently
being made on the current nest
box -architecture to address this
issue.
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich is
the faculty sponsor of the project.
Biology Prof. Alan Launer, who
often serves as a policy advisor on
conservation issues to the Univer
sity, considered the results of the
Bluebird Recovery Program "very
encouraging. The Stanford nest
boxes have been much more suc
cessful than ever dreamed possi
ble."
"We have been really happy
that Stanford jumped on board
and embraced our program.
They've got nothing to do but
win." Arago said. Arago encour
aged anyone interested to contact
the Santa Clara Valley Audoban
Society to get involved.
"Baby birds will break your
heart. My wife and I have devel
oped an incredible appreciation
for these beautiful creatures."
