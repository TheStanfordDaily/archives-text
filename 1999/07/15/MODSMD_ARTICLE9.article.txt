Surely, the furnishing plans for the
Rosenberg At hletic Hall of Fame at the
Arillaga Family Sports Center did not
include five Waterford crystal cups in
sured for a total of $150.000.
For the fifth consecutive year. Stan
ford has won the Sears Director's Cup.
which is awarded to the most widely suc
cessful athletic program in NCAA Divi
sion I by the National Association of
College Directors of Athletics. Such a
mark has established Stanford as the
premier athletic program of the 19905.
Since its inception six years ago, only
one other school. North Carolina, has
won the cup.
Although only garnering one national
championship in the previous academic
year (women's tennis), strong finishes
from many Stanford athletic teams have
once again distanced the Cardinal from
the rest of the competition. This year's
runner-up, Georgia, finished 250 points
behind Stanford in the final standings.
Winning national championships,
however, has become commonplace at
Stanford, as the Cardinal has won at
least one national championship in each
of the last 23 years.
Throughout the past 14 years. Cardi
nal athletic teams have won 50 national
championships. This year, 21 of the 33
teams finished in the national top ten,
including NCAA runner-up finishes in
men's cross-country, men's soccer, men's
water polo, men's indoor track and field,
women's swimming and diving, men's
swimming and diving, and men's track
and field.
And all this at a school with one of the
most renowned academic reputations in
the world? Mix that with talented ath
letes and dedicated coaches, staff and
donors, and it's clear to see that Stan
ford has assets like no other university

in the nation.
Ted Leland. Director of Athletics,
said that Stanford has the ability to at
tract athletes who are not only talented
athletically, but are also academically
driven.
"We've created a marketing niche," he
said. "Very high academic standards
combined with big time athletics. And
we're the only ones who can do it across
the board."
Regan Fruen, '99, who played for the
women's basketball team, told Stanford
Magazine she shared the same senti
ments when deciding to attend Stanford.
"You can't compete with the athletics,
and you can't beat the academics." she
said.
Such a philosophy has brought many
talented athletes to Stanford, which Le
land said is crucial to the success of the
program.
"The key is having great athletes," he
said. "We've been lucky to have kids
that will win the big one for you."
Nurturing the high caliber athletes
that plow onto the Farm each year are a

staff of coaches that have worked at
Stanford for many years and provide an
atmosphere geared towards success.
"Our coaches provide a great learning
environment." 1 Jand said. "I think we
have a set of \ allies — integrity, being
honest, hard work, being able to balance
academics and athletics, and treating
each student athlete as an individual."
With 12 NCAA Championship coach
es. three of whom coached national
teams in the 1996 Olympics. Stanford's
coaching stall not only has high visibili
ty, but also the long tenures on the Farm
to provide a comiottable environment
for the student athletes.
The 12 coaches who have won NCAA
championships at Stanford have a com
bined tenure of 221 years (an average of
18.4 years per coach). And it seems that
as long as the talent keeps rolling in, the
coaches will sta\ satisfied.
"It's hard to beat the type of student
athletes we get to work with." said Mark
Marquess in an interview with Stanford
Magazine, Stanford's baseball coach for
the past 23 years. Li's a very special

place. That's why we all stay so long."
But, in addition to the people running
the athletic program, a great deal of fi
nancial support goes into making all the
success of Stanford sports possible. With
an endowment of $170 million and a
1998-99 budget of $38.6 million, Stan
ford's athletic department ranks among
the top in the nation in these two cate
gories.
Yet, unlike some other schools, the
Athletics Department receives no Uni
versity funding aside from the money
given to run physical education classes.
As a result, Leland said that donors and
sponsors play a major role in ensuring
the success of the department. With
costs including 280 scholarships, com
pensation for 79 coaches, one million
square feet of indoor facilities and 94
acres of outdoor fields, financial support
is a crucial element to the program's
continued prowess.
In recent years $75 million has gone to
construction projects on athletic facili
ties, including Stanford Stadium, Mal
oney Field, Taube Family Tennis Stadi

um, Angell Track and Field and current
renovations to the swimming facility.
And, as expected, the facilities con
tribute to the satisfaction of many cur
rent and potential student athletes.
"I've had the luxury of seeing other
colleges." said Troy Walters, a wide re
ceiver on the football team, in the latest
issue of Stanford Magazine, "and the fa
cilities here are just tremendous. It helps
motivate you."
Another comforting asset to the stu
dent athletes at Stanford is the environ
ment provided bv other undergraduates.
Aside from the band, the sixth man club.
Axe Committee and other groups. Le
land said that Stanford students estab
lish a comfortable atmosphere where
student athletes, even if they are Ail-
Americans or national players of the
year, feel at home, rather than feeling
too much like celebrities.
"Stanford students really believe that
there are many ways to measure excel
lence," Leland said. "They've not been
ones to venerate stars. That helps our
athletes keep their heads screwed on the
right way."
"At other places, all the players are to
gether," said Walters. "But this helps
you develop relationships outside of
football. It's a real positive."
But while all of these aspects of the
athletic program are reasons to cele
brate, next year's campaign for the Cup
has already begun, as 14 athletes identi
fied as the top athletes in the nation in
their respective sports make their way to
The Farm, according to Leland.
And with Stanford's combination of
high caliber athletics and world
renowned academics, it seems that Wa
terford would do itself a favor in relocat
ing to Palo Alto. That way, ihey could
save shipping costs on those crystal cups,
which do not seem to be heading any
where else anytime soon.

Marquess in an interview with Stanford
Magazine, Stanford's baseball coach for
the past 23 years. Li's a very special

place. That's why we all stay so long."
But, in addition to the people running
the athletic program, a great deal of fi
nancial support goes into making all the
success of Stanford sports possible. With
an endowment of $170 million and a
1998-99 budget of $38.6 million, Stan
ford's athletic department ranks among
the top in the nation in these two cate
gories.
Yet, unlike some other schools, the
Athletics Department receives no Uni
versity funding aside from the money
given to run physical education classes.
As a result, Leland said that donors and
sponsors play a major role in ensuring
the success of the department. With
costs including 280 scholarships, com
pensation for 79 coaches, one million
square feet of indoor facilities and 94
acres of outdoor fields, financial support
is a crucial element to the program's
continued prowess.
In recent years $75 million has gone to
construction projects on athletic facili
ties, including Stanford Stadium, Mal
oney Field, Taube Family Tennis Stadi

um, Angell Track and Field and current
renovations to the swimming facility.
And, as expected, the facilities con
tribute to the satisfaction of many cur
rent and potential student athletes.
"I've had the luxury of seeing other
colleges." said Troy Walters, a wide re
ceiver on the football team, in the latest
issue of Stanford Magazine, "and the fa
cilities here are just tremendous. It helps
motivate you."
Another comforting asset to the stu
dent athletes at Stanford is the environ
ment provided bv other undergraduates.
Aside from the band, the sixth man club.
Axe Committee and other groups. Le
land said that Stanford students estab
lish a comfortable atmosphere where
student athletes, even if they are Ail-
Americans or national players of the
year, feel at home, rather than feeling
too much like celebrities.
"Stanford students really believe that
there are many ways to measure excel
lence," Leland said. "They've not been
ones to venerate stars. That helps our
athletes keep their heads screwed on the
right way."
"At other places, all the players are to
gether," said Walters. "But this helps
you develop relationships outside of
football. It's a real positive."
But while all of these aspects of the
athletic program are reasons to cele
brate, next year's campaign for the Cup
has already begun, as 14 athletes identi
fied as the top athletes in the nation in
their respective sports make their way to
The Farm, according to Leland.
And with Stanford's combination of
high caliber athletics and world
renowned academics, it seems that Wa
terford would do itself a favor in relocat
ing to Palo Alto. That way, ihey could
save shipping costs on those crystal cups,
which do not seem to be heading any
where else anytime soon.
