## All-Star Game at Fenway recalls baseball's historic past 
### Rick Opaterney 
Baseball's boys of summer gath
ered with the boys of summers past
on the infield grass at Fenway Park
in Boston prior to the start of last
Tuesday's All-Star Game.
Together, they surrounded one
of the game's greatest living lumi
naries, Ted Williams, in a scene that
evoked memories of all that is good
about the game of baseball. Players
were overwhelmed by simply being
in Williams' presence; the tears that
rolled down Teddy Ballgame's face
conveyed his own gratitude.
He bantered with the game's cur
rent stars, joking with Mark McG
wire and talking about hitting with
Tony Gwynn.
Williams, who has suffered two
strokes in recent years, was support
ed by Gwynn as he rose from a golf
cart to deliver the game's ceremoni
al first pitch to another former
Boston great, Carlton Fisk.

With that pitch, baseball fans
were given an enduring image that
clearly defined the game's timeless
and pure nature. This transcends all
of the game's current turmoil, the
imminent resignation of Major
League umpires and the revived
controversy about Pete Rose's sta
tus regarding the Hall of Fame.
Gwynn, likely this generation's
greatest hitter, and Williams, ar
guably the best hitter of all time,
stood in the midst of the game's rich
history at Fenway, a park with a
strange history of its own.
The field's bizarre configuration
includes a 37-foot-high left field wall
known as the "Green Monster," an
area in straight-away right field that
lies 380 feet from home plate, and
an angled union of outfield walls in
center field.
This is the field where the 1975
World Series was extended to seven
games by Fisk's body language and
willpower, which kept a long fly ball

to left on the inside of the foul pole.
It is where Williams homered to
right in the final at-bat of his career
in 1960 and where Babe Ruth once
pitched.
Of course it is also where the
Babe's curse on the Red Sox mani
fested itself countless times during
the past century. Red Sox fans have
experiencedincomparable
heartache ever since the sale of
Ruth to the Yankees in 1920. Fen
way saw Bucky Dent's miraculous
home run in the 1978 playoff game
against the Yankees and Bill Buck
ner's heartbreaking error in Game
Six of the 1986 World Series.
Maybe it is the grand history
which Fenway conveys that inspired
Colorado's Larry Walker to take a
piece of right field with him from
this year's All-Star Game.
Walker said, "I hope the grounds
crew doesn't get too mad because 1
tore this piece of grass out of right
field. I'm taking it home, and I'm

going to have it forever."
I made my way to Fenway for the
first time about a year ago to see the
Red Sox play the Toronto Blue Jays
in a game dominated by former Bay
Area players I had watched while
growing up: Jose Canseco, Dennis
Eckersley, Tony Phillips and Ed
Sprague.
Physically, it may not be the most
comfortable place to watch a ball
game as 33,000 people are packed in
tighter than in any other stadium in
America. As if that weren't enough,
the fans' view is obscured by pillars
which populate the lower box sec
tions.
However, no ballpark can match
the intimacy and culture of Fenway.
Red Sox fans remember their he
roes and their goats. They notice
the seemingly insignificant contri
butions of the young rookie and the
aging veteran. They remain at the
park into the late innings even
when the home team is behind in an
apparently hopeless position. Per
haps that is because Boston fans
have been the victims of the im
probable.
The only places that may rival
the history of Fenway are Cooper
stown and Yankee Stadium.
Baseball's choice of Cooper
stown for its Hall of Fame is based
on the fallacious myth that the city
was once the site of the game's ori
gins.
Yankee Stadium underwent ren
ovation in the '70s. But Fenway has
remained basically unchanged since
it opened 87 years ago, giving it a
genuine and lasting link to the past.
Furthermore, Yankee Stadium's
past is filled almost exclusively with
triumph. However, it is consistent
victory and triumph that often pro
duce complacency.
Fenway's history, although
marred by pain, unites anyone who
steps onto its hallowed grounds. It is
the universal pain and sense of loss
that actually creates optimism »for
the future. The experience of loss
from time to time fosters an assur
ance that people can still be capti
vated and have their hope revived.
Boston summers have never ex
tended into the off season, but there
is always the certainty that summer
is never too far away. The fated his
tory of baseball at Fenway pro
motes a belief in the romantic possi
bility of the game which is ultimate
ly what makes baseball unique.
Baseball is a game that is free
from the restrictions of time. It is a
game which allowed Fisk to hit a
game-winning homer after mid

night 24 years ago and some of this
century's greatest players to gather
on a cool July night just over one
week ago.
Well, on June 12 somewhere
within the history-rich air of Fen-

way Park, there was, in fact, a base
ball game.
Boston's Pedro Martinez earned
MVP honors as he struck out five
batters in two innings as the Ameri
can League's starting pitcher, lead
ing the Junior Circuit to a 4-1 victo
ry. His five strikeouts included a
string of four consecutive to start
the game as he fanned Barry Larkin.
Walker, Sammy Sosa, and the
mighty McGwire.
The American League scored
two in the home half of the first on
RBI singles by Cleveland's Jim
Thome and Baltimore's ageless Cal
Ripken, Jr.
That, as it turned out, was all that
the American League needed as
their masterful pitching held the
National League to one lone run
scored in the third inning. Former
Stanford star Mike Mussina repli
cated half of Martinez's perfor
mance, striking out Sosa and McG
wire back to back in the fifth.
With the Fenway likely to give
way to a more fan and revenue
friendly stadium in the next few
years, the old ballpark gave Ameri
ca a cherished glimpse into the
game's vast history during the All-
Star Game. Martinez was undoubt
edly the brightest star of the
evening, but it was Fenway's uni
verse in which he performed that ul
timately stole the show.

Yankee Stadium underwent ren
ovation in the '70s. But Fenway has
remained basically unchanged since
it opened 87 years ago, giving it a
genuine and lasting link to the past.
Furthermore, Yankee Stadium's
past is filled almost exclusively with
triumph. However, it is consistent
victory and triumph that often pro
duce complacency.
Fenway's history, although
marred by pain, unites anyone who
steps onto its hallowed grounds. It is
the universal pain and sense of loss
that actually creates optimism »for
the future. The experience of loss
from time to time fosters an assur
ance that people can still be capti
vated and have their hope revived.
Boston summers have never ex
tended into the off season, but there
is always the certainty that summer
is never too far away. The fated his
tory of baseball at Fenway pro
motes a belief in the romantic possi
bility of the game which is ultimate
ly what makes baseball unique.
Baseball is a game that is free
from the restrictions of time. It is a
game which allowed Fisk to hit a
game-winning homer after mid

night 24 years ago and some of this
century's greatest players to gather
on a cool July night just over one
week ago.
Well, on June 12 somewhere
within the history-rich air of Fen-

way Park, there was, in fact, a base
ball game.
Boston's Pedro Martinez earned
MVP honors as he struck out five
batters in two innings as the Ameri
can League's starting pitcher, lead
ing the Junior Circuit to a 4-1 victo
ry. His five strikeouts included a
string of four consecutive to start
the game as he fanned Barry Larkin.
Walker, Sammy Sosa, and the
mighty McGwire.
The American League scored
two in the home half of the first on
RBI singles by Cleveland's Jim
Thome and Baltimore's ageless Cal
Ripken, Jr.
That, as it turned out, was all that
the American League needed as
their masterful pitching held the
National League to one lone run
scored in the third inning. Former
Stanford star Mike Mussina repli
cated half of Martinez's perfor
mance, striking out Sosa and McG
wire back to back in the fifth.
With the Fenway likely to give
way to a more fan and revenue
friendly stadium in the next few
years, the old ballpark gave Ameri
ca a cherished glimpse into the
game's vast history during the All-
Star Game. Martinez was undoubt
edly the brightest star of the
evening, but it was Fenway's uni
verse in which he performed that ul
timately stole the show.
