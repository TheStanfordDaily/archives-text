Once again, Stanford University
will become the center of the
women's sports world, as it hosts the
Bank of the West Classic next week
at Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
This year has already been a busy
year for big time women's sports at
Stanford. Last spring, Stanford
served as the host institution for the
1999 NCAA Women's Final Four in
San Jose. Also, three weeks ago, the
U.S. Women's Soccer Team
trounced Brazil in the semifinals of
the FIFA Women's World Cup at
Stanford Stadium, a game that drew
over 73,000 fans to the Farm.
For the third year in a row. Stan
ford hosts the Bank of the West Clas
sic, the only Bay Area stop on the
Women's Tennis Association
(WTA) tour.
Like many other hard court tour
naments this time of year, the Bank
of the West Classic serves as a major
tune-up event for the U.S. Open in
New York in August.
Defending champion Lindsay
Davenport is no stranger to success
at this tournament. Currently ranked
#1 in the WTA rankings, Davenport
also holds four Bank of the West
Classic titles (1994, '96, '97, '98). With
her victory at Wimbledon last
month, Davenport has established
herself as the player of the moment.
Though she has won only two sin

gles titles this year, she started the
year off on a streak, winning in Syd
ney and racking up 12 consecutive
straight-set victories starting with last
year's U.S. Open and ending in the
quarterfinals of this year's Aus
tralian Open. The streak is the fifth
longest in the open era.
Answering to the challenge of un
seating Davenport are a collection of
talented players including Venus
Williams. Williams, the defending
runner-up, who is currently ranked
#3 in the WTA Tour, could give Dav
enport a tough match just like last
year's final.
She has made the quarterfinals in
six out of her last eight Grand Slam
tournament appearances and has
won four singles titles this year, in
cluding a win over sister Serena at the
Lipton Championships. Her strong
presence on the tour is characteristic
of a lot of young talent currently
dominating the tour.
One of these young upstarts hop
ing to claim victory next week is
Anna Kournikova. The 18-year old
Russian has caught the attention of
many in the tennis world.
This year, she and Martina Hingis
won the Austrailian Open doubles
title over Natalia Zvereva and Lind
say Davenport. She also reached the
semifinals of the IGA Superthrift
Tennis Classic in Oklahoma City
earlier this year, where she lost to
Amanda Coetzer.

She is also one of only eight play
ers to have defeated both Martina
Hingis and Steffi Graf in singles play.
In addition, other players who
have prevailed in doubles at the tour
nament in the past have now
emerged as strong singles players.

Conchita Martinez, who along with
Davenport won the doubles title in
1997, won the Polish Open last week
and is currently ranked 18th on the
tour. Last year, she also defeated
Davenport in the semifinals of the
Australian Open.
One of the interesting features of
the Bank of the West Classic is that it
uses two side-by-side courts at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium. On Monday
and through Thursday, there will be
simultaneous action on both courts.
