## Braveheart on the Links 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
The French do some things very
well. Wine. Fashion. Mayonnaise.
Then, there are things they do not do
well. The two world wars come im
mediately to mind.
For most of this century, champi
onship golf has been another of
France's weaknesses.
Standing on the tee of the final
hole of the British Open, journeyman
pro Jean Van de Velde had an oppor
tunity to change all that. All the 33
year-old, ranked 159 th in the world,
needed to do was make six, a double
bogey on the par four hole.
Van de Velde had played brilliant
ly for the first seventy one holes of the
tournament, holding a five stroke
lead after five rounds and leading al
most throughout the final round.
The Frenchman came to 18 with a
three stroke lead having battled all
day in fierce winds and rain. Ameri
can Justin Leonard was already in the
clubhouse tied with Scotsman Paul
Lawrie, who had posted the week's
best score 67 in the final round to fin
ish at six-over-par.
All he needed to do was make six.
That's where the adventure began.
Van de Velde's drive found the
right hand rough, leaving him two op
tions: an easy layup short of the green
or a risky two iron from the rough
which brought any number of scores
into play.

He chose the latter, pushing the
long iron shot right of the green. The
ball caromed off the grandstands sur
rounding the green and ended up in
the long rough, short of the Barv
Burn, a small creek running in front
of the green.
From there. Van de Velde chun
ked his pitch shot into the water.
Rolling up the legs of his pants and
wading into the water. Van de Velde
contemplated playing the ball from
the three inch deep creek, but
thought better of it and elected to
take a drop short of the burn.
His fifth shot found a bunker to
the right of the green, and after blast
ing out. Van de Velde was left with an
eight foot putt for a seven.
Eight feet just to keep from losing
the tournament altogether and gain a
spot in a playoff with Leonard and
Lawrie, who ten minutes earlier had
been thinking about the plane ride
home and how they would spend the
second place prize money.
Eight feet for all of France's golf
ing glory.
As the rain began to pound hard
er. the thousands of fans in the stands
fell deathly silent. The Frenchman
rammed his putt in the back of the
hole, pumping his fists in celebration.
Never before had a professional
golfer been so elated with a triple
bogey.
Van de Velde finished with a 72-
hole total of 290, six-over-par forcing
a three man playoff with Leonard and

the equally unheralded Lawrie, who
had begun the day 10 strokes off the
lead before his improbable 67 moved
him baek into contention.
In the unique British Open playoff
format, the three would play four
holes, the treacherous 15th-18th. the
player with the lowest aggregate total
winning the Claret Jug.
In a light rain the players teed off
on 15. Van de Velde hooked his drive
deep into the gorse bushes lining the
left hand rough, while Leonard and
Lawrie also pulled their tee shots into
the deep rough on the left side.
After an exhaustive search. Van
de Velde found his ball, declared it
unplayable, and, after taking a penal
ty stroke and drop from the bush,
played back out into the fairway.
Leonard and Lawrie were also
forced to lay up short of the green on
the long par four, both eventually set
tling for bogey. Van de Velde made a
somewhat remarkable six after his er
rant tee shot to fall one stroke behind.
From there, the players moved to
the 249-yard 16th. one of the longest
par threes in championship golf.
After missing the green, all three
made bogey as play moved to the 460-
yard, par-fourl7th — Carnoustie's
most difficult hole which yielded only
one birdie during the final round. It
was Lawrie that made that birdie.
All three players found the fair
way with their tee shots. Leonard,

playing first, fired a long iron to the
front of the green. Both Van de Velde
and Lawrie hit spectacular iron shots
and were left with short birdie at
tempts, tripling the birdie count at 17
in a matter of seconds.
That left only the monstrous 487-

yard, par-four 18th left to play. By this
point, the Scottish crowd, disheart
ened by Van de Velde's collapse ear
lier in the evening had worked them
selves into a frenzy as their country
man stood on the 18th tee on the
verge of winning the Open.
Although the Open is played al
most exclusively in Scotland, a Scot
has not held the Claret Jug since
Tommy Armour captured the crown

in 1931.
In the grandstands surrounding
the green, obscured from the teebox
by a light mist that covered the fair
way, fans were actually doing the
wave. Yes, Virginia, the same Scots
who wear kilts and eat haggis, were
doing the wave.
All three players found the center
of the narrow fairway with their dri
ves. Leonard, playing first from the

fairway knew he needed a spectacular
shot to set up a birdie chance. His two
iron shot came up well short of the
green and fell into Bary Burn, the
same narrow stream which had felled
Van de Velde's chances.
The next few moments will be re
membered for decades in Scottish his
tory and lore. Lawrie's three iron shot
was struck perfectly, bouncing on the
front quarter of the firm green and

rolling within three feet of the pin.
The crowd, already at a fever pitch,
exploded in a resounding roar surely
heard across the United Kingdom.
All Lawrie needed to do was tap in
his three foot birdie put to claim his
first British Open crown.
For the next year, the Claret Jug
will be staying with Lawrie in Scot
land, the birthplace of golf — it's
rightful home.
