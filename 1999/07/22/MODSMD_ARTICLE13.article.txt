## Even gizmos can't save 'Inspector Gadget' Movie lacks the fun, humor and imagination of the original Saturday morning cartoon 
### Kyla Farrell Editorial staff 
Alright kiddies, are you psyched
for a fun ride in the Gadget-mobile?
That's right, just step this way to the
land of "go Gadget" adventure!
Fasten yoin ' !vlt and pant with
anticipatio ; r the millions of
laughs, the beautiful women and the
stalwart hero in this great Disney
movie. Are you ready? But wait,
first a word from our sponsors...
Eager viewers must be warned
that "Inspector Gadget" go goes
nowhere fast. In fact, it's mired in
the gridlock of the predictably mun
dane theatricality that tends to
plague Disney live action films, and
it doesn't even capture any of the
whimsy or irreverence of the origi
nal Saturday morning cartoon.
Let's start with a quote form the
press release that sums up the movie
quite accurately, "when setting out
to make inspector Gadget.' the
goal was to create a seamless blend
between visual effects, special ef
fects and CG (computer generated)
effects."

All very well and good, except
somewhere along the line, Disney
forgot to include a plot or interest
ing and convincing characters.
For those of you not familiar
with the cartoon, John Brown
(Matthew Broderick) is a well

meaning but not too bright security
guard at the local laboratory. He's
hopelessly in love with Dr. Brenda
Bradford (Joely Fisher), a scientist
who's working on a secret robot
project at the lab. and he also yearns
to be real cop. Suddenly one night.

drawn into the thick of a confronta
tion between Brenda and the bad
guy Rupert Everett (Sanford
Scolex), Brown gets blown up. He is
chosen to become Inspector Gad
get. a human/machine/goofy techno
cop, since Brown isn't doing too
well without being hooked up to
machine at this point in the film. As
you can imagine, the newest addi
tion to the police force bungles in an
attempt to cause lots of laughs and
finally saves the day.
Noticeably absent from the film
are Penny, Gadget's niece, and
Brain, her super dog. Marginalized
to only a minor role in the film, the
cuteness and entertainment that
they added to the cartoon are sorely
missed.
Also disappointing was Scolex's
performance. Disney usually pro
duces such brilliant villains, but they
dropped the ball on this one too.
Everett is completely passe, flat and
boring. As for Fisher, her shining
moment comes when she is cloned,
for absolutely no reason, as Robo-
Gadgct, the obnoxious, ditsy jazzer
cise machine.

Worst, however, is the Gadget-
Mobile (voice of D. L. Hughley).
Gadget's funk-soul ghetto blaster
car annoys endlessly, right down to
its Skittles dispenser. Essentially
the stock, perky sidekick found in
most Disney films, his main pura
pose seems to be to endlessly re
mind the audience that this is a Dis
ney film they're watching, as he
states two or three times. At least
he doesn't sing.
For what it's worth, Brodcrick
puts in a wonderful performance as
Gadget, far eclipsing the efforts of
his fellow actors. He is dewy eyed,
well meaning, kind hearted and has
a retractable neck â€” everything you
want and more from your movie
hero. And, admittedly, the special
effects are good.
Maybe the crew was just bitter
because they didn't get to work on
"Tarzan," or maybe everyone just
has their faces glued to their com
puter screens, but "Inspector Gad
get" definitely passed up the oppor
tunity to be a funny, irreverent film.
My advice: stick to watching the car
toon show.
