## 'California' proves to be conglomeration of busting tunes Ex-Faith No More lead singer tackles the far flung future on this fanciful album 
### Michael Baer Contributing writer 
Swing. Lounge. Arabic music.
Sample-heavy metal. All figure
heavily into "California," the third
and latest album for the Northern
Californian quintet, Mr. Bungle.
And, surprisingly, it works. Really.
Mr. Bungle refers to a "Califor
nia," which is not the state, but
rather a land of a far-flung future, in
which robots struggle with their
own mortality. Conceptually, the
album could be best described as
"Blade Runner: The Musical." Did
I mention it actually works?
Okay, so it doesn't sound too be
lievable, but keep in mind that Bun
gle lead singer Mike Patton is the
same Mike Patton who pioneered
funk-metal with Faith No More,
seemlessly adding hip-hop, pro
gressive rock, classical music and
even country into the band's mix.
Faith No More was a wonderful
band, one of the few late '80s metal
bands with the brains and creativity
to match its chops, but after losing
commercial and critical success, not

to mention band members, the
band limped to an end last year.
In terms of genre busting, how
ever, Faith No More was just the tip
of the iceberg. Mr. Bungle actually
preceded Patton's entry into Faith
No More, and it was from his first
band that Patton got his musically
wide and daring tendency.
Now. with no more Faith No
More, Patton has brought the ac
cessibility of Faith to Mr. Bungle,
while abandoning most of the
metal-based song structures he uti
lized for his more popular band. In
stead. other genres and styles arc
mined for their sounds, from the
ridiculous to the sublime, from the
grave to the wacky.
Blue-eyed soul. Polka. Show
tunes. Doo-wop. All of this is fused
into a seamless, distinct style, which
is not only listenable, but unexpect
edly catchy.
Don't be surprised if, after lis
tening to this album, you wind up
with "The Air-Conditioned Night
mare," "Pink Cigarette," or "None
of Them Knew They Were Ro
bots," stuck in your head or on your

lips.
Like the best rock operas, this
disc is all over the place, dealing
with sexuality, mortality, morality

and. yes, androids. Included are ref
erences to Benjamin Franklin,
Demi Moore, reductionism and the
15th century spiritual text "Ars

Moriendi." or "The Art of Dying
Well." Again, in its own strange,
twisted way. it works.
However, like many other roek
operas, this album has the unfortu
nate distinction of having lyrics
which, while as interesting as the
music, are often quite difficult to
understand.
Also, there arc places where the
band tries too hard to combine mu
sical elements that are just not
made to go together. Although al
ways interesting, an album like this
should not only be interesting, but
also fun. Fortunately, both aspects
prevail over most of "California."
Minor complaints aside, this disc
is a keeper. You shouldn't be put
off by the unusual mixture Mr.
Bungle has concocted. Compared
to the simple-minded punk/
pop/metal that passes for "alterna
tive" these days. Bungle offers
something truly different.
We can only hope that a music
buying public weaned on Green
Day. Bush. Offspring and Korn,
will be able to handle something
like this.
