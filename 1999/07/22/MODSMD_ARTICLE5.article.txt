## Bravman adds vice provost to his duties 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
Materials Science and Engineer
ing Prof. John Bravman said that he
was on the road and would call
"early in the evening" for an inter
view on his recent appointment as
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education.
His call clocked in at 11:1)0 p.m.
local time. No doubt late for most of
the world. Bravman's day is still far
from over.
Until last week's announcement
by Provost John Hennessy. Brav
man was serving, in addition to de
partment chair, as the Director of
the Center for Materials Research, a
senior associate dean for student af
fairs for the School of Engineering,
the Chair-elect for the Faculty Sen
ate. the Dean for the new Freshman
/ Sophomore College and as a re
searcher and professor.
Now he will have to add Vice

Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion to his list, beginning this Sep
tember. While he will give up his de
partmen chairmanship, his faculty
senate position and his directorship
for the Materials Research Center.
Bravman plans on retaining his old
schedule as much as possible.
"We will see how the work load
goes." he said, "I don't believe in
doing anything cut-rate."
Bravman's work ethic has paid
off, many-lold. Hennessy said when
he announced his decision to ap
point him as vice provost that Brav
man has "had involvement in virtu
ally every aspect of education. He is.
if not the best teacher in the School
of Engineering, pretty close to being
the best."
University President Gerhard
Casper said that he is "absolutely de
lighted" that Bravman decided to
take the position.
"[Bravman'sJ commitment to the
Universitv has been extraordinary,"

he added.
The five-year post was previously
held by English and Comparative
Literature Prof. Ramon Saldivar.
Saldi'var was the first to hold the po
sition. which was created on the rec
ommendation of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education.
"I'm thrilled and honored to take
on the important task of ensuring
that Stanford's unparalleled efforts
at the undergraduate level continue
to move forward," Bravman said.
This is Bravman's 24th year at
Stanford, starting with his enrolling
as an undergraduate student in 1975.
Maintaining student interaction
Bravman said that he was pleas
antly surprised when Casper asked
him whether he might consider sign
ing on for a new responsibility.
"1 was delighted to be asked."
Bravman said. "(The job] should
also tie in very nicely with my in
volvement with the Freshman /

Sophomore College."
While Bravman is optimistic
about his new job, it does not come
without reservation.
"I do feel badly about leaving my
chairmanship of the [Materials Sci
ence and Engineering] depart
ment," he said. "I still feel like there
is much more yet to be done."
Teaching, one of Bravman's well
known passions, is something that
will have to be sacrificed in the short
term.. 'it's very hard for me to
contemplate giving up teaching, but
1 think for the most part it is going to
go by the wayside for a while," Brav
man said. "I'll probably teach a
course a year."
Bravman. who greatly values his
relationships with students, will also
see those relationships take on a dif
ferent form
"The new position does not lend
itself well for direct student interac
tion," he said. "This is one of the rea
sons whv I want to continue with mv

deanship in the School of Engineer
ing. It is one of my best opportuni
ties to still see and relate with hun
dreds of students and be a strong ad
vocate for each of them."
"Student interaction is extremely
important to me," he added. "1

tember.
never want to lose that part of my
job."
In the end. however, Bravman
proclaimed that the potential bene
fits of the new post far outweigh the
negative effects.
"It's a tremendous opportunity,"
he said.
Sustaining and building
Bravman said that many of the
changes that have been made for un
dergraduate education in recent
years "have been transformative."
"I hope to sustain and build upon
the success that has been established
thus far," Bravman said.
He cites Stanford Introductory
Studies, including the new freshman
and sophomore seminar series, as
one particularly strong point.
"We don't want that to die out.
[SIS] is off to a great start," he said.
For the future Bravman said that
he plans to implement a number of
new pilot programs to overhaul the
opportunities in undergraduate re
search. Working in conjunction with
the Dean of Research's office, he
will seek funding to bolster opportu
nities for undergraduate students to
engage in research activities.
"[Research] is an important part
of education," he said.
Bravman also intends to enhance
the Science, Mathematics and Engi
neering Core, taken by non-science
majors to fulfill general education
requirements in the sciences.
Bravman said that the "SME
core, and technical education for
non-science majors, is one area of
particular personal interest."
The University reacts
Both faculty and administrators
have been supportive of Bravman's
appointment.
Hennessy said that Bravman
"brings a real wealth of experience,
as well as a passion for working with
students that I think is truly extraor
dinary."
"[Bravman's] experience makes
him the ideal choice for this position.
I look forward to working with him
to continue the dramatic enhance
ment of our undergraduate experi
ence," Hennessy said.
Outgoing Vice Provost Saldivar
said that he is "delighted with the
appointment of John Bravman as
the next vice provost."
"I know [Bravman] to be a won
derful teacher, an excellent scholar

and someone sincerely dedicated to
creating the best possible education
for our students," he said.
Newly appointed Dean of Engi
neering James Plummer also agrees.
"[Bravman] is the perfect choice.
He's a gifted teacher, cares deeply
about his students, is full of creative
ideas and is very effective in imple
menting those ideas," Plummer said.
"I fully expect that we'll see the
very positive changes in undergrad
uate education initiated in the past
few years amplified during [Brav
man's] tenure."
Materials Science and Engineer
ing Prof. William Nix calls Brav
man's appointment "brilliant and
that there is no one more committed
to teaching or undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford."
"Bravman is eminently qualified
for the position," he said.
Student perspectives
Bravman's students had nothing
but high praise for him.
Electrical Engineering senior
Alex Tung, who has worked with
Bravman through class and the new
Freshman / Sophomore College,
said that the new post will be "per
fect for [Bravman]."
"I know that he will do a great
job," Tung said. "I do fear for his
sanity, though. He goes all out for
his students. He is one of the most
dedicated professors I know."
Bravman, in his "spare" time,
also serves as the adviser to the Stan
ford Solar Car Project, of which
Tung was the past year's director.
Tung said that even though Brav
man's schedule was hectic, he al
ways made time for the students.
"He is very approachable and
will do what it takes for his stu
dents," he said.
Industrial Engineering senior
Emily Card concurs.
"[Bravman] will be an excellent
administrator, because he places
student needs at the forefront," she
said. "He is a supporter of students
in all disciplines and helps them find
resources to make their endeavors
possible."
"[Bravman] serves as a friend
and mentor. He is comfortable in an
advising / teaching role but also sit
ting at a baseball game with students
or enjoying a conversation over din
ner." she said.
A history 24 years and counting
Bravman has barely left campus
since he enrolled as an undergradu
ate student. He went on to receive
his master's and doctorate in materi

als science and engineering at Stan
ford.
"The University has changed a
lot since then. For one, the student
body is much more diverse than it
once was,"he said.
Bravman's freshman advisor.
Chemical Engineering Prof. Chan
ning Robertson remembers him as a
young student, sitting on the Stern
Lawn 24 years ago.
"He was an imposing figure even
then," Robertson said. "He is, as you
well know, a tall man."
In 1985 Bravman was named as
sistant professor for the Materials
Science and Engineering Depart
ment, and by 1995 he was named a
full professor.
"The years have gone by really
fast," Bravman said. "I eive the ad
ministration high marks for the im
provements that it has made to un
dergraduate education since then."
Bravman said that since 1980,
and especially under the guidance of
Casper and former Provost Con
doleezza Rice in the 19905, Stanford
has begun to take undergraduate ed
ucation more seriously.
"The requirements weren't near
ly as good when 1 was a student, but
I think we have a much stronger sys
tem in place today," he said. "The
opportunities available are tremen
dous."
Since his hiring 14 years ago,
Bravman's career has also
"evolved" in a serious way.

Bravman was elected president
of his professional society, the Mate
rials Research Society, in 1994.
Bravman's research has focused on
the mechanical behavior of thin film
materials and the reliability of mi
croscopic structures found in com
puter chips and other microelec
tronic circuitry.
His group's recent work has fo
cused on the development of tiny
electronic components, called
micro-electro-mechanical systems.
These systems, now an extremely ac
tive research area, are producing
many new useful devices. One such
example is the more reliable ac
celerometers being used for trigger
ing the release of automobile
airbags.
Bravman's work earned him his
deanship within the department in
1993. Three years later he took on

the duties of department chair.
Then, in 1997, Bravman was
named the Bing Centennial Profes
sor, a university-wide position that
recognizes the highest level of excel
lence in teaching.
The position, awarded for a
three-year term, has only been
awarded twice in its history. Stu
dents sent a stack of letters in sup
port of his nomination for this high
honor. The selection was made with
the unanimous recommendation of
the deans of the Schools of Humani
ties and Sciences, Earth Sciences
and Engineering.
One student who wrote in sup
port of Bravman recollected one in
stance that stood out to her.
Wendelin Wright said during her
junior year, due to an earlier power
outage, she had worked all night to
finish a problem set for one of Brav

man's classes. Knowing that Brav
man comes to work early in the
morning, she called him at 5:30 a.m.
Not only was he there, but he was
available immediately to answer her
questions.
"His lectures are engaging and
crucial to the understanding of the
course material," said Wright. "The
lecture handouts that he spends
hours preparing are far superior to
the available textbooks. His door is
always open to students for them to
express their questions and con
cerns."
The Bing Professorship was
Bravman's eighth award for teach
ing. He has received, among others,
the Walter J. Gores Award for Ex
cellence in Teaching, the School of
Engineering Distinguished Advisor
Award and has been honored by
both the Society of Black Scientists

and the Society of Women Engi
neers.
Bravman has used his teaching
experience in a variety of initiatives
to improve the quality of education
at Stanford.
"Over the past five years, (Brav
man] and I have worked closely on
all of the major new initiatives in un
dergraduate education at Stanford,
from the creating of Sophomore
College to the implementation of
the new Introduction to the Human
ities and of the Freshman Seminars,
as well as numerous other under
graduate programs," Saldivar said.
"We are lucky to have [Bravman]
as the new Vice Provost." he said.
Bravman, according to adviser
Robertson, was one student "des
tined for success."
Bravman assumes his new re
sponsibilities on Sept. 1.
