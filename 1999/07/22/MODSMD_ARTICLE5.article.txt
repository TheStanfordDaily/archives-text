## Bravman adds vice provost to his duties 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
Materials Science and Engineer
ing Prof. John Bravman said that he
was on the road and would call
"early in the evening" for an inter
view on his recent appointment as
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education.
His call clocked in at 11:1)0 p.m.
local time. No doubt late for most of
the world. Bravman's day is still far
from over.
Until last week's announcement
by Provost John Hennessy. Brav
man was serving, in addition to de
partment chair, as the Director of
the Center for Materials Research, a
senior associate dean for student af
fairs for the School of Engineering,
the Chair-elect for the Faculty Sen
ate. the Dean for the new Freshman
/ Sophomore College and as a re
searcher and professor.
Now he will have to add Vice

Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion to his list, beginning this Sep
tember. While he will give up his de
partmen chairmanship, his faculty
senate position and his directorship
for the Materials Research Center.
Bravman plans on retaining his old
schedule as much as possible.
"We will see how the work load
goes." he said, "I don't believe in
doing anything cut-rate."
Bravman's work ethic has paid
off, many-lold. Hennessy said when
he announced his decision to ap
point him as vice provost that Brav
man has "had involvement in virtu
ally every aspect of education. He is.
if not the best teacher in the School
of Engineering, pretty close to being
the best."
University President Gerhard
Casper said that he is "absolutely de
lighted" that Bravman decided to
take the position.
"[Bravman'sJ commitment to the
Universitv has been extraordinary,"

he added.
The five-year post was previously
held by English and Comparative
Literature Prof. Ramon Saldivar.
Saldi'var was the first to hold the po
sition. which was created on the rec
ommendation of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education.
"I'm thrilled and honored to take
on the important task of ensuring
that Stanford's unparalleled efforts
at the undergraduate level continue
to move forward," Bravman said.
This is Bravman's 24th year at
Stanford, starting with his enrolling
as an undergraduate student in 1975.
Maintaining student interaction
Bravman said that he was pleas
antly surprised when Casper asked
him whether he might consider sign
ing on for a new responsibility.
"1 was delighted to be asked."
Bravman said. "(The job] should
also tie in very nicely with my in
volvement with the Freshman /

Sophomore College."
While Bravman is optimistic
about his new job, it does not come
without reservation.
"I do feel badly about leaving my
chairmanship of the [Materials Sci
ence and Engineering] depart
ment," he said. "I still feel like there
is much more yet to be done."
Teaching, one of Bravman's well
known passions, is something that
will have to be sacrificed in the short
term.. 'it's very hard for me to
contemplate giving up teaching, but
1 think for the most part it is going to
go by the wayside for a while," Brav
man said. "I'll probably teach a
course a year."
Bravman. who greatly values his
relationships with students, will also
see those relationships take on a dif
ferent form
"The new position does not lend
itself well for direct student interac
tion," he said. "This is one of the rea
sons whv I want to continue with mv

deanship in the School of Engineer
ing. It is one of my best opportuni
ties to still see and relate with hun
dreds of students and be a strong ad
vocate for each of them."
"Student interaction is extremely
important to me," he added. "1
