# New Frosh / Soph College prepares for fall debut
## 
### Uma Sanghvi 
Materials Science Prof. John Bravman, recently named Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education, will remain dean of the
newly created Freshman/Sophomore College in the Sterling
Quad. Although Bravman will be involved with the transition to
his new job as vice provost in the upcoming months, he never
considered giving up Freshman / Sophomore College position

and considers his two appointments "a natural overlap of re
sponsibilities."
When plans for the College were revealed earlier this year,
members of the student body and ASSU leaders expressed crit
icism and doubts regarding location and participant enthusiasm,
among other things. Some speculated that College administra
tors would have a difficult time getting incoming freshmen and
rising sophomores to commit to the College as their first choice
of residence for the 1999-2000 school year.

Not so. said Bravman. "The response of the freshmen has
been just great, as about 175 listed the college as their first choice,
and 135 listed it second. We have 101 freshmen slots."
The success of administrators in interesting freshmen in the
College may be rooted in efforts during Admit Weekend to mar
ket it.
Jane Camarillo, director of residential education said. "John
Bravman was a panelist for a program during Admit Weekend,
which described the different residential experiences. He de
scribed this new [Stanford Introductory Studies] residential ini
tiative to prospective freshmen and their parents. Additionally
the option was listed in the publication, "Approaching Stan
ford", which lists housing options available to all new students."
Funding sources for the Freshman / Sophomore College
have also been a subject of debate. Finance Director for the
School of Humanities and Sciences Adam Talley announced
earlier this year that the program would cost $180,(XX) annually.
In February Res Ed staff members Ashish Vora and Corey Grif
fin wrote a letter to the Daily expressing their concern over the
appropriation of funds to the college.
"The economic aspects of this program are truly ludicrous;
$180,(XX) has been budgeted for this first year. It is a pathetic
demonstration of University bureaucracy that this outrageous
sum of money is being funneled into a new program while an al
ready established and exemplary program like Res Ed is con
stantly denied the extra funding it could desperately use," wrote
Vora and Griffin.
However Bravman contends, "Rumors to the contrary, there
is not a great deal of funding [for the new program], but certain
ly enough to make the project successful."
Bravman will be moving into a new residence close to Sterling
Quad later this summer after work has been done on the house,
including modifications for disability access.
Associate Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Ellen
Woods explained the motivation for having the College Dean
close by: "The Dean's home is another site where we can bring

people together in a hospitable setting for various reasons, in
cluding dinners and other types of events. There's more of a
homey atmosphere than in a dorm lounge or dining hall."
Camarillo reported that during spring quarter, Bravman
chose two post-doctoral "college directors" to live in Adams and
Schiff Houses, where the program will be piloted. The college di
rectors are Sharon Palmer, the director of Freshman and Sopho
more Programs, and J.B. Shank, who teaches in Introduction to
the Humanities.
"The goal was to select people who had a sincere interest in
undergraduate life, particularly in the first and second year." Ca
marillo remarked. Woods added, "Their willingness and desire
to be part of a community was at the forefront."
The college directors will move into their apartments in mid-
August. Complementing Palmer and Shank will be a student
staff.
"The student staff structure consists of six college assistants
who will have the combined functions of the [residence assistant]
and [head advising associate] positions," Camarillo explained.
"There will be two residence computer coordinators and one
peer health educator for the College. As in other houses with
frosh, the College will also have resident tutors."
In addition to the current repertoire of staff in place to over
see the College, Woods indicated that last week an assistant dean
was hired. Hesitant to name the new administrator, Woods in
stead desired to "wait until she is officially on board to announce
her." Camarillo added, "The assistant dean will not be a live-in
position but rather will be the primary programmatic support for
the College and assistant to the dean."
Preparations for the College have begun in earnest.
"Meetings with the college assistants to discuss the joint mis
sion of the staff and dean" have taken place and details of pro
gramming were discussed from the time the College Directors
were appointed, according to Camarillo. She added, "bringing
the conceptual work of the College to fruition is quite a deliber
ate process."
