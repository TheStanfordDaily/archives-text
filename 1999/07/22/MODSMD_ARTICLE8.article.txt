# Tenure examined

### Neela Dasgupta 
In recent years tenure cases at
tracting public scrutiny at the Uni
versity seem to largely involve pro
fessors in the humanities. Some pro
fessors are speculating why this is the
case.
The tenure cases of English Asst.
Prof. Robert Warrior, former Histo
ry Asst. Prof. Karen Sawislak and
Anthropology Assoc. Prof. Akhil
Gupta raised questions and contro
versy about the University's tenure
process.
Tenure issues in engineering
have not attracted as much publicity
or student response as cases in the
humanities. Certainly this is not be
cause all junior faculty in engineer
ing departments receive tenure.
According to a report to the Sen
ate of the Academic Council re
leased in May 1999, of faculty hired
from 1986 to 1991, 30.6 percent of
School of Engineering faculty apply
ing for tenure were denied tenure
compared to 57 percent of School of
Humanities and Sciences faculty.
Some University officials say that
the main reason for fewer publicized
tenure cases in the engineering
school is the wide range of opportu
nities that exist for these professors
both within and beyond the acade
my. Offers from other universities,
fledgling companies or industrial
labs lead to, fewer complaints by ju
nior faculty.
"If a computer science professor
does not get tenure, for instance, he
may be giving up thousands of dol
lars from a faculty salary to work for
a startup company and get millions,"
Aeronautics and Astronautics Chair
George Springer said.
Professors in the humanities
agree that a relative dearth of op
portunities after tenure denial cause
the entire process to be more dra
matic.
"While humanists can continue at
libraries or institutions to research,
these options are less attractive fi
nancially. In some previous cases,
when humanities professors were
turned down for tenure, they com
pletely abandoned their field of spe
cialty because opportunities to pur
sue it simply did not exist." said His
tory Assoc. Prof. Gordon Chang.
Some professors speculate that
tenure cases are not publicized in the
engineering school, because outside
funding allows for fewer rejections.
Countering that notion. Prof.
Jean-Claude Latombe. chair of the
Computer Science Department, said

the computer science department
has in several instances used outside
funds to support new professorships
without spending the money on
tenured professorships.
"A few years ago, the School of
Engineering and Computer Science
Department made a significant ef
fort to provide our new faculty mem
bers with significant startup funds,"
Latombe said, "but most of the pro
fessors whose tenure cases were re
cently considered did not benefit
from similar funds.
Robert Weisberg, Vice Provost
of Faculty Relations at the Law
School, furthermore maintained
that this extra money does not affect
tenure but can only increase the
number of available positions.
"Business, law, medicine and en
gineering are more tied to the corpo
rate world and naturally tend to
have wealthier alums than, for ex
ample, the humanities portion of the
humanities and sciences." Weisberg
said. "But those differences only af
fect, at most, the availability of slots
for initial hires."
English Department Administra
tor Dagmar Logic also emphasized
that more money does not equal
more tenured professors.
"Since tenure is based on scholar
ship and teaching, funding is irrele
vant," Logie said.
Certain adminstrators instead
suggested that tenure cases in the
humanities may be more publicized
and controversial, because the na
ture of the departments cause evalu
ation to be more subjective.
"The humanities, bv their very
nature, tend to be very self-critical
and internally contentious about
their scholarly standards and about
the foundational principles of their
work," Weisberg said. "You don't
see, for example, a lot of fights about
the 'canon' in engineering.... the
likelihood of a tenure case provok
ing intellectual or ideological con
troversy is greater in the humani
ties."
History Prof. Jack Rakove also
stated that the phrase "humanities
scholarship" is a subjective phrase in
tenure policies.
But still the School of Humanities
and Sciences does try to assess qual
ity. According to the Humanities
and Sciences Faculty Handbook,
judging of creative writing, dramatic
or musical composition and art. for
instance, involves comparing these
works to those by other profession-
als in similar disciplines.
While the School of Humanities
and Sciences and the School of En
gineering each have unique policies,
once the cases leave the school, they
go through the Provost and the Ad
visory Board and undergo the same
procedures.
Professors in engineering said
tenure does not often become an
issue in the school, because junior
faculty are signaled early on about
their chances of receiving the honor.
"Each new assistant professor in
CS is coached by a mentor (a
tenured faculty) and has a yearly
counseling meeting with his / her
chair," Latombe said.
"An assistant professor who real
izes that he / she is unlikely to get
tenure may very well pursue anoth
er opportunity before the tenure
case is considered." Latombe ex
plained.
Chang noted that the humanities
also have a mentoring program, bui
it is up to each individual junior fac
ulty member to take advantage of
such resources.
Rakove said. "Compared to pro
fessors at other schools, most junior
faculty at Stanford have a pretty rea
sonable expectation of getting
tenure. Of course, since this is an
elite school, it has to be tough and
fair."
