## Workers break ground all over campus 
### Amy Lin 
Taking advantage of having
fewer students on campus, the Uni
versity began several construction
projects at the beginning of summer
quarter.
Construction currently under
way includes work in front of the
Oval on Serra Mall, the Escondido
Village Graduate Housing con

struction project occurring on sites
east of Mirrielees apartments and
work on the northeast corner of Es
condido Road and Campus Drive.
According to Kelly Rohlfs, Fa
cilities Engineer and Project Rep
resentative of the Serra Mall pro
ject, the section of Serra Street that
crosses between the Quad and the
Oval is being narrowed. After re
construction, all of Serra Street will

be the same width as the section of
Serra Street that is in front of
Hoover Tower. The area of Serra
Street by the Oval will also be out
fitted with granite curb and asphalt
block sidewalk.
Construction on Serra Mall
began on June 15 and occurs be
tween the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.
Rohlfs plans for work to be com
pleted the day before fall classes
start.
Efforts have been made to
lessen the inconveniences posed to
pedestrians and students.
"Some days, [the street] will be
closed for paving asphalt," said
Rohlfs, "but we don't close all the
[detour] routes off at the same
time."
To decrease the impact of noise
on a seminar going on in the Grad
uate School of Business, workers
involved in demolition work moved
further down the street toward
Lomita Mall.
The Escondido Village Gradu
ate Housing construction project
also began on June 15th. Part of a
Capital Improvement Plan estab
lished by Housing and Dining Ser
vices for student residences, the
project will add 508 units of single
graduate housing.
One hundred and thirty-nine
housing units will be built east of
Mirrielees along with 127 units cre

ated on the corner of Campus Drive
and Escondido Road, which are
scheduled to be completed at the
end of August 2000.
Two hundred and forty-two
units are being built next to Build
ing 36 in Escondido Village and are
expected to be completed by De
cember 2000.
Total construction costs stand at
$67 million.
Noise and dust issuing from the
EV construction sites have not gen
erated many complaints.
"There were some complaints at
the beginning," remembered Diana
Conklin, manager of Undergradu
ate Resident Facilities, speaking of
residents 1 reactions to construction
preparations that began in May.
"People thought it would start
later."
Since then Conklin has not
heard of any concerns. "I think peo
ple are being patient for what we
are going to get more graduate stu
dent housing," Conklin said.
Clark Vitt, Housing Facilities
Manager, credited the lack of prob
lems to an "extensive outreach to
the community" via information
disseminated from a Web site and a
hotline.
"I've talked to some students
and they've said, yeah, it's noisy,"
Vitt said, "but I have not directly
gotten any complaints."
