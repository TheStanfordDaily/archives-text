Ideals regarding exercise abound
in American culture, ranging from
the traditional adage of "get 30 min
utes of exercise every day" to the
more personalized "run two miles,
do 50 pusb-ups and 50 crunches each
day." Now, several researchers are
espousing a new goal: take 10,000
steps a day.
The 10,(XX) mark was first used by
researchers at the Cooper Institute
for Aerobics Research in Texas.
These researchers determined the
number of steps needed to burn
enough calories to consider an indi
vidual "active."
The goal has since been adopted
by many other exercise researchers,
including Assoc. Prof. Abby King,
from the department of Health Re
search and Policy at the Stanford
School of Medicine.
"There's nothing magical about
the number 10,000," King empha
sized. "It was about the number [of
steps] researchers found necessary
for people to get health benefits
from physical activity."
Some of those advantages include
weight control and prevention of
chronic diseases, such as cardiovas

cular disease, adult-onset diabetes,
hypertension and even cancer. Re
search has also shown that regular
exercise helps people fight depres
sion.
Although the process of counting
steps was initially used only for re
search purposes, there are practical
applications of step counting in im
proving public health.
In order to benefit from exercise,
"regularity is key," said King. Re
searchers are hoping that the 10,000
step target will be a better motiva
tional factor than traditional goals in
pushing people to be regular exercis
ers.
According to the behavioral liter
ature, study participants responded
best when they had something that
they could control and felt that they
could change, said King. A step
counter, telling someone how many
steps he or she had already taken,
would then be a motivational device
by letting the user know exactly how
many more steps needed to be taken
to reach the concrete 10,(XX) step
goal. •
Given that the average American
is classified as under-active, taking
only 3,000 to S,(XX) steps a day, most
people need to more than double
their daily number of steps in order

to benefit from physical activity.
Thus, any sort of additional encour
agement to exercise — in the form of
step counters or otherwise — is wel
come.
King has used step counters in her
research on low income, minority
women, as well as on the elderly.
Both groups have found step coun
ters simple and easy to use, accord
ing to King. Some patients become
so attached to their step counters
that they anxiously ask for another
one if they lose it.
Another reason for using step
counts as a measure of physical ac
tivity is that it takes into account how
much people walk in their daily rou
tines.
"When you walk around the
workplace, or you walk from the car
to your house, you usually don't con
sider that a part of your 30 minutes of
recommended daily physical activi
ty," said King. "But you are moving
about."
This technique is also starting to
get more attention, with a recent
USA Today article about exercise in
the form of 10,000 steps.
"After such publicity, I wouldn't
be surprised if someone came up
with a book on how to get 10.(XK)
steps in one day," said King.
