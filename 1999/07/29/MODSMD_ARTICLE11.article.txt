Board of Trustees and the Athletics Board, at a speaking engagement.
Indeed, Lodato contributed
valuable and innovative concepts to
the Athletic Department.
"One of the achievements he was
most proud of was founding the
DAPER Investment Fund, a unique
new way of raising money for Stan
ford athletics," said Lodato's son,
Mark Lodato. "So far, that fund has
donated more than $10 million to
Stanford athletics," he noted of the
Fund, which began with only
$300,000,
Besides his work in athletics,
Lodato was also involved in many
other areas of the University.

"What struck most people who
met him or worked with him was
both his patience and persistence,"
said Mark Lodato. "These qualities
allowed him to work in the Univer
sity system to see projects through
and achieve his goals."
Lodato's numerous contribu
tions to the University earned him
both the Gold Spike Award in 1988
and the first Outstanding Service
Award given by Stanford, which
now bears his name.
As an undergraduate student,
Lodato was a member of the Zeta
Psi Fraternity, graduating from
Stanford in 1949 with a bachelor's in
economics. Then, in 1954. he earned
a master's in education at Stanford,
followed in 1956 by a master's in po

litical science from Princeton Uni
versity. Outside of Stanford, Lodato
worked as an early shopping center
developer and as a venture capital
ist.
"The University has always been
close to his heart, and he wanted to
find a way to improve the quality of
life for students, both academically
and athletically," Mark Lodato said.
A memorial service open to all
