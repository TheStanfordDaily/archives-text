### Emil Dizon Contributing writer 
The Bank of the West Classic
has boomed into full swing as large
crowds have come to Taube Family
Tennis Stadium to see the tourna
ment, now in its third year at Stan
ford.
The tournament began with one
less player, as Monica Seles suf
fered a left forearm injury on July
24. She had to cancel her Federa
tion Cup match on July 25 and with
draw from the tournament, giving
sth seed Barbara Schett a first
round bye.
The July 27th evening session,
however, showed that the tourna
ment has not lost any steam, draw
ing the first sellout of the tourna
ment. In the first singles match
Russian youth Anna Kournikova
defeated Mirjana Lucic of Croatia,
6-4, 6-2. Lucic committed 21 un

forced errors in the match, thirteen
in the first set, as Kournikova seized
the momentum early by amassing a
4-0 lead in the first set before Lucic
could break serve. Kournikova hit
nine winners in the first set.
"I started off really well," said
Kournikova. "1 had to really show
her that I'm going to fight. I've been
practicing really hard the past two
weeks."
"I went for too much at the be
ginning of points," said Lucic. "I
didn't think I was serving too well; I
wasn't really mixing up the serving
as much as I should have."
"She tried to hit the ball really
hard and make winners," said
Kournikova of Lucic, "while I was
trying to be patient."
In the night's other match, Jen
nifer Capriati defeated Spain's
Conchita Martinez, 5-7,6-4,6-4 in a
hotly contested match that had a
number of momentum changes.

As the two players exchanged
winners and unforced errors,
Capriati earned a service break in
the final set, and although Martinez
almost broke back, Capriati won on
her fourth match point as she
rushed to the net and took Martinez
three steps off the sideline with a
backhand volley.
Martinez returned a high, short
ball, which Capriati put away with a
forehand smash, sending the capac
ity crowd onto their feet in praise of
the competitive match.
"That's what I should have done
the first match point," Capriati said.
She added that she wanted to play
more points like that.
Afternoon play on July 27 went
by without any upsets, as Sandrine
Testud of France defeated wild
card Iva Majoli of Croatia, 6-1,6-1.
In other action Katarina Srebotnik
of Slovenia defeated Jane Chi of
Idaho, 6-3, 6-1; Corina Morariu of

Florida defeated French qualifier
Anne Gaelle Sidot, 6-1, 6-4; and
Columbian qualifier Fabiola Zulu
aga defeated Thai qualifier Tama
rine Tanasugarn, 3-6, 6-4,6-3.
Former Stanford player Anne
Kremer of Luxembourg advanced,
as her opponent, Dominique Van
Roost of Belgium, had to retire with
an injury, 6-0,1-0, ret. In the other
singles match that day, Lisa Ray
mond of Pennyslvania defeated
Cara Black of Zimbabwe, 3-6, 6-1,
6-2.
The play that night, however, got
a little spicy after the match be
tween Irina Spirlea and Chanda
Rubin.
Rubin won the match, 6-4, 6-4,
but it was Spirlea who turned some
heads when she volleyed the ball
into the net on match point. She
then smacked the ball into the box
seats across from the chair umpire
on Court 1, apparently at a fan who

said something during the point.
Spirlea then stormed off the
court and left Taube Family Tennis
Stadium without attending the
post-match press conference. Her
hitting the ball into the stands could
cost her up to $ 1 ,(XK), tournament
officials said.
In the other singles matches that
night, hard-hitting Amy Frazier of
St. Louis hit 23 winners en route to a
6-2,6-4 victory over Anke Huber of
Austria. Huber, who grunted in
frustration at many points through
out the match, committed 20 un
forced errors and four double faults.
"She was hitting the ball fast and
deep, and 1 came up short," said
Huber. "I think I should have put
more pressure with my return."
Frazier said she was happy with
her serve and hopes to keep up a
consistent ground game against
Barbara Schett in the second round
of play on July 28.
