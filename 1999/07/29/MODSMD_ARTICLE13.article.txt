# A 						night of tennis on the Farm
## 
### Emil Dizon Contributing writer 
Sure, it may be past 10 p.m. on a
Monday night, but at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium a strong contingent
of children are still up, watching a
doubles match at the Bank of the
West Classic between the team of
Larissa Neiland and Mirjana Lucic
and the team of Corina Morariu and
Lindsay Davenport, the number one
player in the world. The children sit
on the large section of bleachers next
to court two. where the match is tak
ing place.
The match has gone to three sets,
and at about 10:36 p.m., Davenport
and Morariu finally win the match.
Suddenly, amidst the post-match ap
plause. the clatter of feet on the wood
en bleachers echoes throughout the
stadium, as the youths joust on the
bleacher railing, reaching their pro
grams out to Davenport with requests
for autographs. She happily goes over
and signs as many as she can amid the
shrieks of the kids, who are all proba
bly up way past their bedtimes.
"There's a lot of kinds here," said
Amy Fraizer, who signed autographs
after her win over Anke Huber on
July 26, "and that's great to see."
Amidst all the programs and other
momentos, Davenport and a few
other players in this tournament sign
after their matches, the Bank of the
West Classic seems to have found a
solid venue for the coming years.

With the popularity of tennis on
the Peninsula, combined with the ex
cellence of varsity tennis at Stanford,
the tournament has a site where ten
nis is as popular as it can get.
Seven of the top 20 players in the
Women's Tennis Association rank
ings are playing in the tournament.
However, Monica Seles, who was
scheduled to play in the tournament,
had to withdraw after suffering a left
forearm in jury on July 24. She also did
not play in her Federation Cup match
on July 25.
Adding a local flavor to the tour
nament is Anne Kremcr of Luxem
borg. a member of Stanford's 1997
NCAA Champion women's tennis
team. After turning pro last year. Krc
mer made the third round at Wimble
don this past June and earned wins
over Seles in Eastbourne and Aran
txa Sanchez-Vicario at the Lipton
Championships.
Ranked 34th in the world, Kra
mer said she looked forward to re
turning to Stanford for this week's
competition.
She played in the tournament as
an amateur in 1997, when she defeat
ed Mary Pierce in the first round. She
missed the 1998 event due to her play
ing in an International Tennis Feder
ation event, a common type of event
for new professionals before they at
tempt to play WTA tour events.
Kremer, who turned pro in Sep
tember of 1998. said her parents were
concerned with her decision to turn

pro, given her ranking at that time
and her being on scholarship at Stan
ford. Yet she has made solid progress
in her first year on tour, winning 4ITF
events and amassing career winnings
of $124,938 entering this year's tour.
Kremer's return match was rather
quiet compared to Tuesday night's
session, which brought the tourna
ment's first sellout. Perhaps receive
ing the largest ovation was Russian
youth Anna Kournikova, who took
the court to the joy of many teenage
boys who hooted and hollered
throughout Kournikova's match, the
loudest after Kournikova finished her
match with Lucic.
"It's always like this," she said. "I
like it."
The male contingent even fol
lowed her to the pressroom, their
faces glued to the glass windows in
awe of the young professional.
In addition to the hoopla sur
rounding Kournikova, the crowd was
treated to another exciting match, as
Jennifer Capriati and Conchita Mar
tinez battled for 2 hours and 36 min
utes. The crowd got behind the un
seeded Capriati, as she found the
strength to rush the net in a flury that
won her the match.
"They were great; they really were
behind me," said Capriati.
"It just seemed that I was doing all
the running. They helped keep me
pumped up. They like the underdogs.
They like to see someone get back on
top."
