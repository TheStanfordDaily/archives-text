## Beaubien, Heifferon anchor national waterpolo team 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
Scanning the rosters of the U.S. teams at the
World University Games is a little like thumb
ing through a freshman face book. You cannot
go more than a few names down the list with
out finding another Stanford athlete.
From basketball to men's and women's vol
leyball, the performances of the Cardinal ath
letes over the last month in Palma de Mallorca,
Spain have clearly shown that the last five
Sears Directors' Cup trophies now residing in
Arrillaga Family Sports Center are anything
but a fluke.
Men's water polo was no exception as
Layne Beaubien and Brian Heifferon, two of
Stanford's top performers from the last year,
led the U.S. squad to a fourth place finish, mak
ing for five of the team's seven goals.
The U.S. lost the bronze medal game to
Hungary by a score of 13-7 to finish just out of
the medal race. Ahead of the Hungarian team,
Italy took home the silver medal, while host na
tion Spain claimed the gold.
"I'm really glad we made the medal round,"
said Beaubien, the U.S. team's captain from
Coronado, Calif. "But fourth is a hard place to
fall — it's bittersweet."
Hungary jumped out to an early three goal
lead in the match scoring at 5:40,4:08 and 3:30
before Beaubien could stop the bleeding with
the U.S.'s first goal at 2:54 during a man-up op

portunity.
After Hungary scored again, the U.S. squad
rebounded with another goal from Beaubien
and a goal by Adam Wright to narrow the lead
to one after the first quarter of play.
Hungary extended its lead with a goal com
ing at 4:33 in the second quarter, but Heifferon
of Fullteron, Calif, responded with team
U.S.A.'s fourth goal of the match. Hungary,
however, did not allow the U.S. to stay close,
scoring again to widen its lead to two goals at 6-
4 after two quarters of play.
After Heifferon tallied the first goal of the
third quarter on an uncontested opening ball,
Hungary reeled off four consecutive goals to
effectively put the match out of reach. Ryan
Flynn of the U.S. squad broke the Hungarian's
scoring streak, but they responded with their
11th goal of the match at :31 remaining in the
period.
Both teams managed one goal in the final
quarter until Hungary scored with 11 seconds
remaining to make the final 13-7, avoiding a re
peat of the 12-7 defeat of the Americans in the
Games' opening bracket.
Apart from the strong fourth place showing,
Beaubien said, "the thing that was good about
us was that we won the games that we needed
to win."
Teams that had beaten the U.S. in the open
ing rounds of play did not fare as well in the
final rounds of the tournament.
Beaubien, who was a senior this past year.

and Heifferon, who will return to the Farm for
his senior season this upcoming academic year,
anchored the Cardinal squad that narrowly lost
to Southern California in this vear's NCAA

championship game.
The duo finished first and second on the
team in scoring with Beaubien, tallying 44
points to Heifferon's 42.
