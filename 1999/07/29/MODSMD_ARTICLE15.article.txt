Gabc Gardner and Andv Witt have spent
virtually the entire month of July represent
ing U.S. volleyball on the world's stage. They
began in the first week of this month, playing
overseas in the World University Games in
Spain and are presently competing in the
Pan Am Games in Winnipeg, Canada.
For Gardner, a 6-8 outside hitter who will
be a senior at Stanford in the fall, after trans
ferring from Southern California, it was his
second University Games. Together with
Witt, also a senior outside hitter on the farm,
he led the U.S. to a respectable sixth place
finish in the competition, in which other
countries fielded teams largely composed of
national team members, contrasting to the
U.S. team, made up entirely of college play
ers.
The U.S. team began the Games with five
consecutive wins to place first in their Group
C division. Witt, from Santa Ynez, Calif.,
starred in the second match, a 3-2 (25-23,21-
25, 22-25, 29-27,15-13), tallying 32 kills and
four blocks.
Two of those kills served to preserve the
match against Italian match points in the
fourth game.
"In those pressure situations, 1 always
want the ball," Witt said, after the thrilling
fifth game. "Those moments make the game
fun."

Coming off the five-game match, the U.S.
efficiently beat China in three straight
games, 25-17, 25-23, 25-13. In the second
game Witt recorded the last five kills of the
second game, allowing the U.S. to take a rel
atively easy third game to win the match.
On July 7 the U.S. clinched a spot in the
medal round with a five-game victory, (33-
35, 27-25. 16-25. 25-13, 16-14), against Bel
gium. In the second game, a Gardner kill tied
the score at 25, and the U.S. followed with
two aces by Brandon Taliaferro of UCLA.
Gardner again came up big with his team
behind two games to one. getting four kills
and serving up two aces to lead the U.S.
team's rally as they won games four and five
to close out the match.
Team U.S.A. continued to play impres
sively, beating Greece 3-0 (25-23, 25-16. 25-
17) to extend their record to 5-0, winning the
Group C title in the final game of pool play.
Greece presented a strong challenge in the
first game until, with the score tied at 20. Witt
put down a kill to put the U.S. up for good.
U.S. medal hopes ended with the team's
first match of the medal round against host
country Spain.
After dropping the first two games of the
match, the U.S. mounted a valiant effort to
extend the match to a full five games before
falling victim to Spain 20-18 in the fifth set.
With the two teams tied at 17 in the third
game, Taliaferro recorded three straight

aces and Gardner closed out the game with a
kill. Gardner's kill with Spain serving for the
match at 19-18 in the fifth postponed elimi
nation from medal contention, but Spain
came back to put away the U.S. on their next
match point.
U.S. errors turned out to be the team's
greatest obstacle as they finished with 17 ser
vice errors in the match.
After beating Poland in another five
game match 3-2 (11-25. 25-22, 19-25. 26-24.
15-11), the U.S. fell to Russia in three con
secutive games 25-21, 25-12, 25-20 to finish
the Games in sixth place.
The U.S. finally showed the effects of
playing virtually every day of the tourna
ment and playing four five-game matches in
their first seven games. Russia dominated at
the net as the U.S. was never close in the final
two games.
Gardner and Witt were both also selected
for the 12-player U.S. team that is currently
competing in the Pan Am Games. The U.S.
dropped its opening match 25-19, 25-19. 25-
20 to Argentina despite Gardner's match
high 12 kills.
The July 26 match against Columbia
opened ominously as two critical mistakes by
the U.S. late in the first game helped Colum
bia take the game 25-20. However, the U.S.
rebounded to win games two and four before
finishing the match with a 15-12 win in game
five.
