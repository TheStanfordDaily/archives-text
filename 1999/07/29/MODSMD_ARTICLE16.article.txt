## GWAR you ready to rumble? Death metal band amazes and appalls audience at Edge 
### Josh Samuels Contributing writer 
It's Parliament meets Frank Zappa meets
Rob Zombie. It's an industrial opera. It's vol
canic hell. Its name is GWAR. and it satiated
the lusty, satanic yearnings of a full house of
Edge patrons on July 22.
The crowd was diverse, ranging from lanky
ravers on their night off to grizzled metal
heads. In one corner a seven-year-old accom
panied by her mother was given the low-down:
. "Is this your first GWAR concert?" asked
the grizzled metal head.
"Yes," replied the wide-eyed young one,
eyes a-sparkle.
"'Cause you know, these guys are the real
thing."
The girl was later devoured by a giant ori
fice that emerged from center stage.
For the uninitiated, GWAR. which stands
for "God What A Racket," is a troupe of per
formers who don farcically barbaric costumes

and play painful music, while enacting scenes
of comic violence and sexuality.
According to myth, the members of
GWAR used to be mischievous space bandits
who were exiled to Earth as punishment for
their misdeeds. Although the retinue varies,
the July 22 show had many of the regulars —
Oderus Urungus and Scroda Moon on lead
vocals. Beefcake the Mighty on bass, Balsac
"Jaws of Death" and Flattus Maximus on gui
tars, Jizmak da Gusha on drums and the irre
sistible Slymenstra Hymen on vocals. In addi
tion the Sexecutioner and several others were
on hand as "dancers'Vgeneral minions.
The word "concert" is a bit of a misnomer
for what GWAR does. "Show" is far more ap
propriate. The actual music is of negligible
quality, and volume overshadows melody ex
ponentially. Vocals are barely distinguishable
beneath the musicians' extravagant head
gear. However, the music really only serves as
an excuse for the on-stage antics, most of
which involve the violent deaths of large pup

pet-costumes inhabited by GWAR minions.
The show began when a team of archaeol
ogist puppets came on-stage. After some brief
puppet foreplay, they unwittingly uttered the
magical mantra, "Gwar, Gwar, Gwar," and
the band burst forth through the (paper) walls
in all their horrid glory, eliciting an ecstatic
ejaculation of joy from the Edge's patrons
that is seldom witnessed at traditional con
certs.
After a clouded attempt at introducing a
plot, a fairly predictable, yet nonetheless de
lightful, pattern emerged: a monster more evil
than the band members enters, someone en
gages in battle with it, utilizing the most so
phisticated of oversized styrofoam weaponry
available and eventually decapitates it, pokes
its eye out or puts a foreign object in its rec
tum.
Examples of such evil beasties included a
massive pointy toothed toilet, the Jaegermeis
ter reindeer and Elvis. In the throes of death,
each monster drenches the audience in a tor

rential rain of fake blood, spurting as far as 20
feet from the stage. Indeed, after the show it
seemed as if everyone was wearing pink tie
dyed shirts.
It's difficult to pinpoint just what was the
highlight of the show. The mosh scene was ro
mantic and painful. The adrenaline ran high,
as equal amounts of testosterone and estrogen
smashed like atoms into one another amid the
fray. The rivulets of fake blood spurted by the
band congealed into slick puddles on the floor,
posing an additional hazard. Piercings were
guarded religiously.
Believe me. The pain was real, but the fun
universal.
