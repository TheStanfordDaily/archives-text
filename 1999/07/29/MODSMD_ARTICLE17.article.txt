# Mime makes noise without saying a word
## Marcel Marceau's highly anticipated return to San Francisco proves winning 
### Josh Samuels Contributing writer 
At 76, Marcel Marceau has had
quite a career. He's been a profes
sional mime for over 50 years, he's
started his own school of mimeolo
gy, and he even appeared in "Bar
barella" with Jane Fonda. Damn.
Marcel Marceau. that veritable
Renaissance man, has returned to
San Francisco's Theatre on the
Square after a 15-year hiatus.
Born in France, Marceau was
originally inspired to pursue his
unique career by silent screen leg
ends like Charlie Chaplin and
Buster Keaton. For his San Fran
cisco run, Marceau selected three
programs from a repertoire of 26
pieces. Each program runs for five

days, through August 8.
The performance is divided into
two sections. In the first act,
Maceau performs pantomimes of
style, which are vignettes of classi
cal mime, highlighting Marceau's
technical skill. In "Soliloquy of
Three Lost Souls," Marceau flips
between three characters dis
cussing solutions to their pitiful ex
istences.
Because no words are ex
changed, the interaction between
the characters is quite complex, but
somehow, not at all confusing. This
isn't particularly surprising though,
considering that Marceau is the
man. Other acts from this part of
the program include "The Creation
of the World," "The Seven Deadly
Sins" and "Youth, Maturity, Old

Age, and Death."
The second act showcases the
antics of Marceau's alter-ego, Bip.
"Bip travels by sea," "Bip as a
street musician" and "Bip commits
suicide" are but a few of the many
scenes played. The highlight of the
July 21 performance was"The
Maskmaker," in which Bip, in a
somewhat cliched piece, tries on a
variety of masks. However not only
does Marceau maintain the illusion
of his sundry masks, but when one
gets "stuck," the result is magical.
It is awe-inspring to witness
Marceau's ability to retain the ma
niacally happy guise of the mask
with his face while simultaneously
expressing exasperation, exhuas
tion and the hopelessness with the
rest of his body.
