# Tape trading acts as an increasingly popular media exchange
## 
### Jay Reitz 
The popularity of Jam Bands has dramati
cally increased recently due to tape trading, al
though they are still largely ignored by com
mercial radio, MTV and the music industry as
a whole. Indeed, hands like String Cheese In
cident, moe.. Disco Biscuits, Aquarium Res
cue Unit and Phish have built up a fanbase
through intense touring and the availability of
live tapes of their performances — something
that brings them popularity and accessiblity
fast.
The art of tape trading often baffles and
alarms those who are unfamiliar with the
hobby. People wonder where all the tapes
come from, how much they cost and why the
tape trader isn't in jail for being some kind of
"music bootlegger." In truth tape trading is
more a matter of dedication and interest than
money or crime.
Tape trading has progressed tremendously
since Deadheads pioneered the practice in the
mid-'7os. Back then, traders met at trading
clubs through ads placed in the back of maga
zines. Many traded with the same partners for
years on end.
Today the tape trading scene is a true In
ternet success story. There are several web
sites devoted to tape trading, many of which
have sections for "newbies."

Pauseßecord.com is an excellent resource for
anyone new to the scene, as it covers all as
pects of Jam Bands, not just tape trading. Jeff
Tiedrich's Resources for Tape Traders
(http://www.resourcesfortapers.com/) is per
haps the most complete site for traders, al
though Tiedrich's site has a Grateful Dead
slant to it (oh no!).
The media of trading is changing as well.
There was a time, quite recently, when tape
trading meant analog cassettes and Maxell
XL2-9()s were the brands of choice. Everyone
listened to the same crappy-sounding shows.
Now, there are a host of other formats, nearly
all of which offer significant benefits over
analogs. The following is a summary of the
digital formats:
• Digital Audio Tape, or DAT, was intro
duced in the late '80s, touted as the next gen
eration of digital media, but it proved too cost
ly for the masses. But DAT is ideal for tape
trading. It's digital, so there is no generational
loss (read: copies don't hiss), tapes are three
hours long, so both sets can fit on one tape, and
the tapes are really small and cool.
DAT is the media used by serious tapers
and traders. Disadvantages include the high
price of decks ($650 - $1200 for new ones) and
sketchy reliability.

• CD-R is taking trading by a storm. The dri
ves are cheap ($230 and up), the discs are
cheap (less than $1 in bulk) and the discs will
last 100 years or more. You can play CDs on
anyone's stereo, and they sound as good as
DATs. The main problem with CD-R is that a
disc only holds 74 minutes, which means three
discs per average show.
• MiniDiscis becoming popular with the main
stream music crowd and has begun to spill
over into trading. However, MD is not an ideal
format for trading. Though digital, MD relies
on compression to fit 74 minutes on a tiny disc.
The compression is hardly audible on the first
generation, but each copy introduces progres
sively more digital artifacts. Plus, MD suffers
from the 74 minute media size of CDs, and
media costs are about $3 a disc. Conclusion:
much better than "schwag-alogs" but not
worth the hassle.
Whatever the media, shows are always
traded for free. No one should profit off music
which bands have allowed their fans to record.
Most traders are aware that bands take signif
icant financial risks in allowing recording.
The best way to get started in the trade
business is by building a collection from offers
placed on rec.music.phish. An alert "newbie"
can net several such offers a day and quickly
establish material with which to trade with.

A typical offer works like this: a good na
tured trader offers to spin a show for a given
number of people who reply, you send the
trader blank tapes — CDs or DATs (depend
ing on the offer) in a padded mailer with re
turn postage and a self addressed label, and a
week or two later, you get the mailer back,
with the shows now spun onto the tapes.
Everyone likes to get mail, and the Stanford
post office is much more manageable with the
knowledge that you have three hours of new
music waiting just beyond the angry postal
clerk.
For the most part, tape trading communi
ties are some of the most pleasant and egali
tarian groups you will encounter on the Inter
net. Most traders are reliable, fast and courte
ous. However, there are a few bad traders out
there who prey on people's trust. If you be
lieve you have been taken advantage of, con
tinue to send the trader e-mails and post your
story on a public forum. Most times, public hu
miliation will shame them into filling their half
of a trade.
A Stanford mailing list has been estab
lished for those interested in tape trading. Ac
ceptable topics for discussion include all as
pects of taping, tape trading and local shows.
