# Run as fast as you can from 'Runaway Bride'
## New Julia Roberts flick falls short of lofty expectations set by 'Pretty Woman' 
### Sylvia Lin Contributing writer 
Nine years after the release of the
1990 blockbuster, "Pretty Woman,"
Garry Marshall teams up once again
with Julia Roberts, Richard Gere
and Hector Elizondo to attempt an
other romantic comedy hit — "Run
away Bride," to be released in the
aters July 30. Yet despite the glam
our and hype of its returning stars,
"Runaway Bride" is only a tepid pro
duction in comparison to its prede
cessor.
The story begins with Ike Gra
ham (Gere), a reporter reputed to be
detested by the opposite sex for his
often disparaging and offensive arti
cles, desperately searching for a story
for USA Today. Amidst his search
for the ultimate story, he comes
across an interesting tale in a bar re

garding a young woman who repeat
edly leaves her grooms at the altar.
This tip leads him to Hale, Maryland,
home of the "man-eater" Maggie
(Roberts). Once again, Maggie is en
gaged, and this time, Ike is intent on
following her until she drops another
groom — a key in obtaining the
story. What ensues in the next hour
and a half are the lessons not only of

self-discovery, but also the the un
folding of a groom from whom Mag
gie will not run away.
Unfortunately, even the familiar
big grin and distinct laugh of Julia
Roberts cannot rescue this film from
its many cheesy and drawn out
scenes. There are the superfluous
characters (Elizondo's Fisher) and
scenes that are at odds (those be
tween Maggie and her father) that
disrupt the movie's continuity.
Perhaps, as viewers, we become
unfairly biased due to the fame and
popularity of "Pretty Woman," yet
this comparison does not come un
warranted. The multiple and blatant
references to its predecessor are a
clinching factor that only encourages
the longing for the return of Vivian
and Edward, Roberts' and Gere's
previous roles.
However, "Runaway Bride" does

offer some memorable and comedic
moments that are highlighted by
Maggie's grandmother's wisdom of
wedding nights, sports fanatics and
Fed Ex deliveries. Perhaps one of the
most refreshing aspects of the film is
Maggie's sincere and wonderously
unique friend, Peggy Fleming,
played by Joan Cusack. Her com
ments, expressions and character are
colorfully portrayed and a pleasure
to watch. In addition, director Mar
shall cleverly depicts the contrast be
tween the lush tranquility of Hale to
its counterpart of New York City —
a distinction that enables the self-dis
coveries of the two leading charac
ters.
So watch it because of Roberts'
and Cusack's performances. Gere's
Graham is endearing at times, but his
character and the film itself will like
ly leave you thinking that a) You

liked him better as the business ty
coon, Edward, in "Pretty Woman"
b) He looked better in "Pretty
Woman" and c) You liked "Pretty
Woman" more.
