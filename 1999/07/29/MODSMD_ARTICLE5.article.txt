## University ready to accomodate extra freshmen 
### Michelle Wang 
The University is preparing for
the arrival of 1,759 new freshmen
this fall, according to Robert Kin
nally, dean of undergraduate admis
sion and financial aid.
The incoming Class of 2003 is the
largest entering class since at least
1950.
"1 think that Stanford is prepared
to accommodate all of the stu
dents," Kinnally said. "It has taken
a tremendous amount of work on
the part of the staff in many offices."
The unexpected number of
freshmen has since created a hous
ing shortage. To compensate Stan
ford has only admitted 31 transfer
students, compared to 126 last year.
Rooms in Roble Hall originally
reserved for transfer students will
now be occupied by freshmen. Ad
ditional living spaces were made by
converting freshman singles to dou
bles in Branner Hall and Lagunita
Court. In addition study rooms in
each of the Florence Moore houses
will be used as residential rooms.
"The increased number of fresh
men is distributed throughout the
housing system, so the immediate
impact on any one house or staff is
lessened," said Jane Camarillo, di
rector of residential education.
Sophomore Sohi Sohn said, "I'm
frustrated with the fact that the Uni
versity continues to make this mis
take of letting more people in than

they can accommodate. Not only is
it unfair to the freshmen — two or
more people living in what was orig
inally a single — but the upperclass
men have limited housing choices as
well."
The 21 transfer students who de
cided to come to Stanford will live in
Toyon, Kimball and the Freshman /
Sophomore College at Sterling
Quad. Camarillo said the purpose of
grouping transfer students together
is so that they can identify with each
other.
Housing Assignment Services
Manager Kathleen Bransfield said
that the increased number of fresh
men should not affect housing for
returning unassigned students, "as
long as [they are] willing to live any
where." The results of the second
draw were announced July 17 and
walk-ons are assigned housing the
first week of school.
Academic programs such as In
troduction to the Humanities and
Writing and Critical Thinking have
also had to adjust to the large fresh
man class. Some I-Hum classes,
such as Structured Liberal Educa
tion and Word and the World, are
already at capacity, so more stu
dents will be placed in the other
courses.
"Courses are larger than we'd
like, but section size will stay the
same," Area One Director Harry
Elam said.
Five extra postdoctoral fellows

were hired to lead new sections, so
as to maintain class sizes of no more
than 15 students. According to
Elam, because Area One adminis
trators were notified of the in
creased class size while they were al
ready in the process of hiring faculty,
finding five additional instructors
was not difficult. About 600 people
applied for 26 available positions.
The Writing and Critical Think
ing program also wants to maintain
an average of 15 students per class
by adding more classes.
"We have had to hire more in
structors, and the number we need
to hire keeps growing as the news of
the size of the class keeps coming,"
said Ron Rebholz, director of Writ
ing and Critical Thinking.
The Registrar's Office is still in
the process of creating the Fall
Quarter Time Schedule.
According to Scheduling Coor
dinator Amalia Precy Pamintuan,
the increased number of freshman
classes has made scheduling more
difficult.
An added factor is that I-Hum
sections require an overhead projec
tor and VCR. To address this, equip
ment has been added to classrooms
and rooms formerly used as offices.
Pamintuan said that increased I-
Hum and Writing and Critical
Thinking sections will not reduce
the number of sections allotted to
other classes.
"We are under control," she said.

One concern is that the increased
number of students will lead to less
individual advising. Freshmen are
assigned to an Advising Associate,
who is an upperclass student, and a
Freshman Adviser, a member of
Stanford faculty, staff, or alumni.
"We try to keep the groups at
reasonable levels so the advisers
have time to pay attention to stu
dents," said Dandre DeSandies, as
sociate director at the Undergradu
ate Advising Center.
To meet the goal of one adviser

for every six students, about 75
more freshman advisors are still
needed.
The UAC also plans to hire an
additional full-time adviser.
Finally, the increased number of
students will not reduce financial
aid awards, because the Financial
Aid Office can request increased
funding if necessary.
"We will meet every student's
need," said Cynthia Rife, director of
student awards and university man
ager of financial aid.
