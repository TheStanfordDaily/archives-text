# Professors argue against existence of water on the moon

No water may exist on the moon, according to a letter writ
ten by Electrical Engineering Prof. Von Eshleman and Geo
logical and Environmental Sciences Prof. George Parks and
published in the June 23 issue of Science Magazine
The researchers questioned analysis of data collected by
two spacecraft, Clementine and Lunar Prospector, in the last
few years.
"Scientists with the Lunar Prospector measured the
amounts of elemental hydrogen on the moon, found an abun
dance at the polar regions, and said this was indicative of
water. This, however, is only circumstantial evidence," Eshle
man said.
Eshleman and Parks also said that a current NASA project
would therefore provide ambiguous results. On July 31 NASA
intends to crash the Lunar Prospector spacecraft into a south
polar crater to produce a plume of material. If the plume con
tains traces of water and hydroxyl ions, it will prove the exis
tence of lunar ice.
Instead, Eshleman and Parks claim that water is probably
not present as vapor or ice on the moon, but rather it exists as
a component of hydrous minerals. Their basic reasoning is that
lunar dust reacted long ago to absorb any water in such forms.
Eshleman emphasized that lunar dust is anhydrous —
without water in any form — but that it is capable of absorbing

large amounts of water and chemically incorporating the hy
drogen and oxygen atoms into mineral crystals.
"Even though the material is dry, it has a great proclivity for
water," he said.
Parks used thermodynamic calculations and experiments
on earth to validate this idea. The geochemist compared the
situation to the reaction between water vapor and lime.
"Lime is an anhydrous material. You have to store it in a
closed container because otherwise it will react with water
vapor in the air to form calcium hydroxide, a hydrous sub
stance," he said.
The researchers predict that if they arc correct and the
south polar crater is covered with hydrous material instead of
water ice, the crash of the Lunar Prospector could melt the ma
terial to produce a plume of water vapor and hydroxyl ions,
even though water was not previously there.
Re-analysis of radar data collected from Clementine seem
to support Eshleman and Parks' theory. Specifically, signals
from the moon do not have the characteristic signature of
water ice.
"Radar signals from the poles of Mercury, the three moons
of Jupiter (especially Europa), and other areas with ice have
shown similar patterns, but there are no such patterns from the
moon — only small variations, interpreted as ice," Eshleman

said.
Richard Simpson, a senior re
search associate in the Electrical
Engineering Laboratories, was the
first to reinterpret the Clementine
numbers to show that these tradi
tional "ice signals" were absent
from lunar radar data.
Water did, however, once exist
on the moon; it usually comes to
planets and moons through comets,
Eshleman and Parks explained.
"A comet has lots of water in the
form of ice," Parks said. "When a
comet hits a planet, the impact rais
es the temperature, and some parts
of the comet evaporate to become
water vapor in the atmosphere,
while some of it stays on the planet
surface as ice."
After water arrives at a planet or
moon, the researchers believe, it
then moves around the surface until
it is absorbed by dust. When the
minerals cannot absorb any more
water, the leftover water becomes
ice. This, Eshleman, said, is why
Mercury has ice on its surface.
"We think all water has been ab
sorbed on the moon, but comets
have hit Mercury more recently, so
ice is still lingering. Since Mercury is
closer to the sun. there is a higher
concentration of comets, a gravita
tional focus," he said.
Interest for this type of research
stems from hope of establishing a
human base with a ready source of

water on the moon.
"Water is an important resource
for habitation," said Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Leonard Tyler. "It's
too heavy to take with you, but once
you have it, you can use it for suste
nance and break it down to use as
fuel."
If Eshleman and Parks' theory is
correct, water does not exist in a free
state, but it could still be released.
"Other scientists were hoping
there would just be ice they could
melt because that's a cheap process.
If all that exists are these hydrous
minerals, though, they would have
to use solar energy to heat the min
erals and regenerate water, hydro
gen and oxygen; but it would de
pend how desperate they are, and
what the energy cost is," Parks said.
At present, the researchers and
other professors have general ideas
about how to further verify the the
ory of water absorption.
"If we could collect samples from
the poles, we could see if the hy
drous process is happening," Parks
said.
Although 4(X) kilograms of mate
rial has been brought back from the
moon by Apollo and Luna, none of
the samples have come from cold
spots, like the north and south poles.
Obtaining such samples, however,
would be difficult.
"There could be an experiment
where we send out land rovers to
look for ice, but the problem is ice
only exists where there's no sunlight
and so there is no solar power,"
Tvler said.
