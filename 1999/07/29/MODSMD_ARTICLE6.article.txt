# Professors argue against existence of water on the moon

No water may exist on the moon, according to a letter writ
ten by Electrical Engineering Prof. Von Eshleman and Geo
logical and Environmental Sciences Prof. George Parks and
published in the June 23 issue of Science Magazine
The researchers questioned analysis of data collected by
two spacecraft, Clementine and Lunar Prospector, in the last
few years.
"Scientists with the Lunar Prospector measured the
amounts of elemental hydrogen on the moon, found an abun
dance at the polar regions, and said this was indicative of
water. This, however, is only circumstantial evidence," Eshle
man said.
Eshleman and Parks also said that a current NASA project
would therefore provide ambiguous results. On July 31 NASA
intends to crash the Lunar Prospector spacecraft into a south
polar crater to produce a plume of material. If the plume con
tains traces of water and hydroxyl ions, it will prove the exis
tence of lunar ice.
Instead, Eshleman and Parks claim that water is probably
not present as vapor or ice on the moon, but rather it exists as
a component of hydrous minerals. Their basic reasoning is that
lunar dust reacted long ago to absorb any water in such forms.
Eshleman emphasized that lunar dust is anhydrous —
without water in any form — but that it is capable of absorbing

large amounts of water and chemically incorporating the hy
drogen and oxygen atoms into mineral crystals.
"Even though the material is dry, it has a great proclivity for
water," he said.
Parks used thermodynamic calculations and experiments
on earth to validate this idea. The geochemist compared the
situation to the reaction between water vapor and lime.
"Lime is an anhydrous material. You have to store it in a
closed container because otherwise it will react with water
vapor in the air to form calcium hydroxide, a hydrous sub
stance," he said.
The researchers predict that if they arc correct and the
south polar crater is covered with hydrous material instead of
water ice, the crash of the Lunar Prospector could melt the ma
terial to produce a plume of water vapor and hydroxyl ions,
even though water was not previously there.
Re-analysis of radar data collected from Clementine seem
to support Eshleman and Parks' theory. Specifically, signals
from the moon do not have the characteristic signature of
water ice.
"Radar signals from the poles of Mercury, the three moons
of Jupiter (especially Europa), and other areas with ice have
shown similar patterns, but there are no such patterns from the
moon — only small variations, interpreted as ice," Eshleman
