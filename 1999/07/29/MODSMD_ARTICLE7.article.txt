# Kennedy reflects on his indirect path
## Reknowned professor remembers how he fell in love with history 
### David Arulanantham Staff writer 
At a university well known for producing world fa
mous engineers and physicists, there's at least one story
of a student who started out in the sciences and then
went on to a successful career in an entirely different
field.
As a teenager getting ready to begin his first year at
Stanford in 1959. History Prof. David Kennedy had
plans to become an electrical engineer. After all, he en
tered higher education at a time when America was be
gining to strongly encourage its young to pursue scien
tific disciplines.
However upon arriving at Stanford, Kennedy, the
author of the recently published "Freedom from Fear:
The American People in Depression and War, 1929-
1945." slowly took a different course.
The freshman engineering curriculum didn't seem to
interest him as much as he thought it would. Then in his
sophomore year, he studied abroad at the Stanford pro
gram in Italy, where he took some classes from History
Prof. Wayne Vucinich, now a professor emeritus, and
found them more to his liking. At this point he strongly
considered changing his field of study. Vucinich. in turn,
encouraged him to abandon engineering and become a
history major.
The next year, back at Stanford, Kennedy took a
class called "The American Character." which "so
deeply stimulated [mvj interest in history that [1] decid
ed to become a professional historian," Kennedy said.
Kennedy later went on to attain a Ph.D. in American
history at Yale University and join the faculty at Stan
ford. However, the irony of his transformation still re
mains with him.
"My running joke with [Vucinich] is that if he hadn't
steered me away from electrical engineering into histo
ry. now I'd be a Silicon Valley millionaire," he said.
Perhaps so. but the study of American history also
wouldn't be quite the same.
Since coming to Stanford in 1967, Kennedy has
taught a number of courses on U.S. History and pub
lished three books, all of which have received critical ac
claim.

First, he wrote a piece that had been his doctoral the
sis at Yale, "Birth Control in America: The Career of
Margaret Sanger," for which he won a Bancroft Prize.
The next book, "Over Here: The First World War
and American Society," was written during the height of
the Vietnam War. when the social unrest prompted by
America's involvement in the conflict reached its peak.
According to Kennedy, he wanted to write a book using
a war as a lens through which to examine American so
ciety. It was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
"Freedom from Fear: The American People in De
pression and War. 1929-1945" is the latest work in a se
ries called "The Oxford History of the United States," a
multi-volume collection which aims to detail the period
from the American Revolution to the present.
"I was asked to do this book by the editors of this se
ries ... and I said "ves' right away because it was my in-
