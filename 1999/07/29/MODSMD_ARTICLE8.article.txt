# Entrepreneur challenge helps build new startup

Editor's Note: This is the first in a se
ries of articles covering the progress
of recent startups by Stanford stu
dents.
Although Yahoo! may be one of
the more famous startups that orig
inated on the Stanford campus, the
entrepreneurial spirit continues to
remain strong on the Farm.
An indication of Stanford's
startup fever is the growing partic
ipation in the Stanford Entrepre
neur's Challenge, hosted by the
Business Association of Stanford
Engineering Students, a student
run organization in the School of
Engineering. The Challenge is a
contest in which Stanford students
work in teams to build a new busi
ness venture.
BASES provides the competing
teams with resources for team
building, business development
and networking. The team with the
winning business plan is awarded
$25,000 in seed money to begin its
startup adventure.
The 1998 winners of the Chal
lenge. a team of six graduate stu
dents, has taken its winning busi
ness plan and used it to launch a
bio-informatics company. InGenu
itv Systems.
The six graduate students. Neil
Abernathy. Richard Chen, Ray
mond Cho, Ramon Felciano. Marc
Hun and Dan Richards, met at a se
ries of entrepreneurial classes at
Stanford and eventually put to
gether a business plan for the 1998
Challenge. The six students ended
up winning the contest and receiv
ing the $25,000 for their company.
"What was most useful about
participating in and ultimately win

ning the BASES challenge was the
contacts we were able to make,"
said Richards. The six were able to
pitch their business plan to venture
capital firms, and they now have
several million dollars in funding.
The goal of InGenuitv is to pro
vide biomedical information in a
format that is more computational
ly accessible than is currently possi
ble with standard Medline-tvpe
search engines.
Richards, a biomedical doctoral
student, describes the company's
product as a set of "knowledge
bases," like databases, "only bet
ter." The company's founders are
focusing on organizing information
on biological molecules, which is
often difficult to tabulate and pre
sent in an understandable way.
InGenuity is using object-ori
ented technology to present infor
mation on biomolecules as a "net
work of relationships," rather than
a simple database of information.
Biological molecules will be repre
sented through their functional re
lationships to other molecules and
systems. Users will be able to inves
tigate their subjects of choice bv
simply clicking around to the vari
ous relationship paths set up by the
program, allowing researchers to
make more sophisticated queries
than is now possible with standard
search engines.
In a market that doesn't seem to
be quite as fond of biotechnology
startups as in past years. InGenu
ity's progress can in part be attrib
uted to the fact that its product is a
blend of biotechnology and infor
mation technology, according to
Richards.
The hybrid nature of the compa-
