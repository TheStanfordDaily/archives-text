Stanford has been named the na
tion's trendiest college by the Kaplan
Newsweek College Catalog 2000,
which will make its debut later this
month. The Catalog, a $25 book pub
lished by Kaplan/Simon & Schuster,
boasts 1,362 pages with entries for
1,100 colleges and universities.
The results are based on the first
ever National High School Guidance
Counselor Survey of 4,500 high
school college counselors.

"'Trendy' was used to show the
popularity of a college among our
high school counselors," said Laura
Sigman of Kaplan, the organization
that designed and conducted the sur
vey.
Kaplan emphasized that Stan
ford's ability to attract celebrities is
not the source of its trendiness.
According to Kaplan's press re
lease, "The nation's trendiest college
is Stanford University â€” and not be
cause Chelsea Clinton attends."
Instead, the survey suggests that

Stanford's appeal comes from its ex
cellence in a variety of fields.

Stanford stood out in the survey
because it was most frequently cited
by high school counselors for "its Di
vision One excellence in sports, cou
pled with Ivy League academics and
resources," according to Kaplan's
press release.

Stanford also received high marks
for its location and the diversity of its
student body.
"Stanford has a very diverse stu
dent body. Also, great location and
bountiful resources contribute to its
popularity," Sigman said.
Perhaps there is legitimacy in the
survey's results.
In a welcoming letter to this year's
new students, published in the "Ap
proaching Stanford" handbook.
University President Gerhard
Casper declared that 90 percent of

Stanford students indicated that
Stanford was their first choice, as op
posed to 69 percent for other highly
selective private universities.
Kaplan says the purpose of its col
lege catalog is to make a "guide en
abling [high school] students to
search for their ideal college through
detailed indexes sorting schools by
cost, size and selectivity."
