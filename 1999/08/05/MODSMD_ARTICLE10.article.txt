# Study links suppression of emotional expression to memory impairment
## 
### Uma Sanghvi Contributing writer 
Recent evidence from the Stan
ford Psychology Department sug
gests a link between the regulation of
emotional expression and memory.
Psychology Asst. Prof. James
Gross and psychology doctoral stu
dent Jane Richards have shown, in
recent studies, that suppressing emo
tional reactions may impair short
term memory.
In their work published in the cur
rent issue of Personality and Social
Psychology Bulletin, 58 undergradu
ate women viewed slides of men with
physical injuries. These photos were
taken from crime scenes and car ac
cidents. Participants also heard audi
tory information during the presen
tation of each slide.
Half the subjects were asked to
"behave in such a way that a person
watching you would not know you
are feeling anything at all," thereby
quelling any natural emotional reac
tion that might have arisen from
viewing the traumatic images. The
other subjects were not given any
specific instructions on how to react
to the occasionally gruesome pho
tographs.
After a "distractor task" at the
end, participants were given a sur
prise quiz. They were presented with
a slide and asked to recall the audito
ry information that had accompa
nied that image.
The subjects who had been asked
to suppress their emotional expres
sion were significantly less likely to
remember auditory details than the
subjects who were able to divulge
their revulsion and discomfort.
Richards and Gross duplicated
these results in a second experiment,
this time with 85 female undergradu

ates. In a study similar to the first.
Richards and Gross confirmed that
memory for visual details is also dis
rupted when emotional expression is
curbed.
11 also appears that this phenome
non is observed in men. Richards ex
plained, "One study found that al
though men tend to
be 'hiders,' this does not release
them from the ill-effects of emotion
al suppression."
Emotional suppression causes
classic stress-induced heightened
cardiovascular activity, including in
creased heart rate, blood pressure
and sweat gland activity.
However, Richards explained,
"our statistical analysis showed that
increases in cardiovascular activity
does not account for the observed
cognitive effect."
Although a full understanding of
this phenomenon has yet to be de
veloped, Richards and Gross specu
late that our finite attention capacity
is at least part of the explanation.
Richards postulates, "it may be
that simply keeping a straight face is
resource consumptive." If this is the
case, then emotional suppression is a
distraction, shifting our attention
away from our environment.
Gross speculates, "although sup
pression seems to compromise mem
ory, we think there is another form of
regulation 'reappraisal' that is less
cognitively costly."
Gross explained that "response
focused emotional regulation," of
which one type is expressive suppres
sion, involves the constant monitor
ing of one's emotions. This may con
tinually divert cognitive resources
away from awareness of one's sur
roundings. On the other hand, "an
tecedent-focused emotional regula
tion" is a "one-time only interven

tion," employed before emotions
even get started.
For example, if a person can sense
that an emotionally-charged situa
tion is about to develop, and he re
evaluates the situation before be
coming emotionally involved, he
may be able to transform something
otherwise emotionally upsetting into
a benign interaction. This latter
method of "reappraisal" is predicted
to exact less cognitive damage than
hiding feelings.
These findings suggest that we
pay a cognitive price for hiding our
feelings. Richards suggests, "Rela
tionships depend so much on memo
ry, but hiding emotion washes out
details."
She added that we often find our
selves in social situations refraining
from disclosure of our true emotion
al status. However, the success of our
interpersonal relationships with
friends, significant others, bosses and
others may well hinge on our aware
ness and memory of our interactions
and environment. It may be that
those of us who are less likely to di
vulge our inner emotional status are
less likely to remember emotional
events from our own life.
This hypothesis was tested in an
other study that Richards and Gross
have submitted for publication. Sub
jects were given surveys to rate how
much they suppress their feelings in
emotional situations. Subjects kept a
diary for 14 days, each day recording
an emotional event that had oc
curred. At the end, participants were
asked to recall the details of their
emotional state during events which
had occurred over the course of the
past two weeks. Results indicated
that people who had rated them
selves more likely to repress their
feelings were also less likely to re
member the recorded events of the
past two weeks.
In future studies, Richards and
Gross are interested in how different
ways of regulating emotions may dif
ferentially interact with memory
processes.
Richard said, "We want to better
understand first the major strategies
that people use to regulate their emo

tions in everyday life, and second,
what their implications are, not only
for memory for emotional events, but
also for other aspects of cognitive
function as well, such as test-taking
behavior and performance during job
interviews." 1
In addition neuro-imaging tech
niques may be employed to visualize
neural activity during emotional sup
pression. Results may shed light on
how hiding feelings may trigger an
"attentional shift" in the brain.
In the meantime we may be wise
to closely assess our own ways of reg
ulating emotion.
