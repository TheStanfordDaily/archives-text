Dear Editor,
I was a bit startled by the July 22 article, "New Frosh /
Soph College Prepares for Fall Debut," that reported a high
level of interest in the new Freshman / Sophomore college
among incoming students.
The news itself was hardly a surprise. Formerly a student
representative on the college's implementation team, I fully
expect it to become a remarkably successful venture. In
stead, it was The Weekly's odd negative spin on apparently
good news that shocked me.
After reporting that demand for freshman spots in the
college is almost double the number of available slots, The
Weekly opined, in a straight news story, that this "success
may be rooted in efforts" by the administration to "market"
the college during Admit Weekend. The other explanation
— that the college simply attracted students on the merits of
its program — was not pursued by the article.
Still, it is worth exploring precisely what The Weekly

meant by its veiled criticism of "marketing." Should the ad
ministration reconsider the practice of informing incoming
freshmen about innovative offerings for them? Surely, The
Weekly is not suggesting this. Its editors would, in fact, be the
first to justly criticize the University for neglecting to inform
the community about its initiatives.
Perhaps the article implies that the college was aggres
sively advertised to admits and their parents at the expense
of other programs. If so, The Weekly failed to cite a single
fact in support of this allegation.
The facts, as I remember them, tell a different tale. There
was no evidence of salesmanship at a program where admits
learned about their housing options. Materials Science Pro
fessor John Bravman, the inaugural dean of the college, sat
on the same panel with representatives from the Structured
Liberal Education program, from four-class houses and
from all-freshman houses. His presentation did attract many
audience questions, probably because the core concept of
the college — delivering enhancements to introductory edu

cation into the residences — is extremely compelling.
In all fairness, I must point out that I saw no technically in
accurate facts in the article, which makes it easy to dismiss
my comments as a tempest in a teapot. 1 would do so myself,
were this style of reporting not characteristic of the way the
Daily covered and criticized the college throughout winter
and spring. Even when the program met its recruiting targets
in the face of relentless editorial attacks, it still got bad press.
To be sure, in an institution that relies on open debate,
bad press is not necessarily so bad at all. The Weekly, of
course, has the right to scrutinize the administration's poli
cies. In fact, that's the job of an independent student news
paper. However, by stubbornly refusing to give the college a
fair chance. The Daily risks painting itself, and student voice
in general, as a tireless advocate of the status quo without the
enthusiasm and imagination to support innovation.
