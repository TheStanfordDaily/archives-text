## For Davenport, Stanford event is money in the 'bank' World No. 1 captures second straight title 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
Lindsay Davenport may hail from southern
California, but she's starting to get used to
things here up North.
The number one ranked player in the
world, fresh from winning her second grand
slam title at this year's Wimbledon, Davenport
captured her second consecutive Bank of the
West Classic at Stanford's Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium.
With a resounding staight sets win over
Venus Williams, who had been playing strong
all week. Davenport firmly established herself
as the world's number one, as well as one of the
top hard court players. Going back to last
year's event. Davenport has now won 13
matches in a row on hardcourts in her native
state.
In a match of powerful serves and ground
strokes, the two battled to a tiebreak in the first
set with Davenport prevailing 7-6 behind a 7-1
score in the tiebreak.
Davenport rebounded to take the second
set 6-2 for her eighth win in eight tries against
Williams and a repeat of the 1998 Bank of the
West result.
Davenport used a variety of different shots
as well as some muscle of her own to counter
Williams' power game which had over
whelmed opponents in previous rounds.
With her singles victory at Wimbledon,
Davenport became the first American since
Chris Everet and only the eighth woman since
1975 to hold the number one ranking in the
world.
This win marks her 23rd career victory, in
cluding the two grand slams and the gold
medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in At
lanta.
Davenport, the Bank of the West's number
one seed, received a bye in the first round and
after straight set wins over Chanda Rubin and
her own doubles partner Corina Morariu, Dav

enport defeated Amy Frazier to reach the
event's final.
Williams, the tournament's second seed,
came to Stanford with four Women's Tennis
Association titles under her belt this year.
After a much hyped career as a junior player,
Williams has had a breakthrough season this
year, reaching the number four spot in the
rankings.
Also receiving a bye in the first round,
Williams defeated Katarina Srebotnik to set
up a showdown with fellow teen phenom
Russian Anna Kournikova in the quarterfi
nals. Before a packed stadium, Williams
pulled off a straight sets win behind a booming
serve and powerful groundstroke winners.
Finally, Williams, who holds the record for
the fastest serve on the WTA tour, took out
South Africa's Amanda Coetzer to set up the
match with Davenport in the finals.
Williams seemed unfazed by her previous
record against Davenport going into the match
and fended off allegations that Davenport
held a distinct mental advantage when the two
met head to head.
"You just have to go out and play tennis,"
Williams said.
Although she said she had been distracted
in the second set after easy first sets against
Kournikova and Coetzer, Williams insisted
she would be focused for the Davenport
match.
"Sometimes, I have too much fun out
there," Williams said. "Against Lindsay, I
don't think it will be quite so fun."
In the final, Davenport ensured that
Williams had no time for lax play, taking an
early lead and holding off Williams to win the
first set tiebreak. Davenport's strong play in the
second set ended the match before Williams
could muster a significant counter-attack.
On the doubles side, Davenport, taking the
court just moments after her victory teamed
with Morariu to defeat Kournikova and Elena
Likhovtseva 6-4,6-4.
