# New football season ticket plan comes with heavy price
## 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
It works on the home shopping
network — why not on the football
field?
The Stanford Athletic Depart
ment announced a new plan on July
30 which gives football season ticket
holders the option to return their
tickets for a full refund if they are not
satisfied with the team's results.
The program is designed to opti
mize Stanford fans' experience, giv
ing the consumer the ultimate say in
the team's success.
Think Coach Willingham should

throw the ball more on third down?
Hey, come turn in your tickets.
Ashamed that Stanford got beat by
San Jose State again this year?
We've got your money right here.
The guarantee plan is not without
significant caveats. Season ticket
holders must be sure to request the
new system when purchasing their
tickets — not all tickets are guaran
teed.
Also, in order to receive the re
fund, ticket holders must return
their tickets before the season's final
two games — Big Game against Cal,
followed the next week by another
home game against Notre Dame.

This leaves the ticket holder hav
ing seen home games against only
Washington State, Oregon State,
San Jose State and UCLA — two
perennial Pac-10 bottom dwellers;
one team Stanford has, with the ex
ception of last year, dispatched with
relative ease every year in recent
memory; and one premier oppo
nent.
Most fans could watch these four
games and leave feeling unsatisfied
even if Stanford won all four. Big
Game and the Notre Dame show
down are the whole reason for buy
ing season tickets in the first place.
What's a Stanford football season

without Big Game?
The most disconcerting element
of the plan is the message that such a
decision sends about the Stanford
football program and its prospects
for success in 1999.
The Stanford squad is composed
of a group of extremely talented
players who give their hearts on the
field every down of every game dur
ing the season. By offering potential
ticket refunds to unsatisfied fans, the
Athletic Department is, in essence,
admitting that there is potential for
another losing season.
Is this sending the right message
to players and fans? Do Florida

State, Nebraska and Michigan
worry about refunding fans after a
disappointing season?
If you are Joe Fan and the team is
down by six with 45 seconds remain
ing, what incentive do you have to
stand up on your seat and scream
your lungs out when there's always
the option of turning in your tickets
for a total refund?
Money back guarantees are for
the space age, year 2000 chipper,
dicer, shredder that makes cole slaw
and does your laundry while you sip
mai tai's by the pool at some
Caribbean resort. TTiey're not for
football games.
