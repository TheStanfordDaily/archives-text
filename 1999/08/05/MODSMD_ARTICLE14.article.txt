## Jackson joins coaching ranks 
### Ricky Opaterny 
With the dawn of another women's basketball season
just beyond the horizon, the Cardinal announced on July
28 the hiring of Tia Jackson as an assistant coach to re
place Tonya Booker, who departs after two seasons with
Stanford.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer said, "[Tia] is very en
thusiastic and has a great love for the game. Her proven
record as a coach along with her professional playing ex
perience makes her an asset to the program."
Jackson arrives on the Farm after spending three
years as an assistant coach at Virginia Commonwealth
University. Jackson served as a restricted-earnings coach
with the Rams before being promoted to a full-time po
sition for the 1998-99 season, where she bolstered the
team's recruiting efforts.
Jackson's Rams finished last season with an 11-17
record, ending the season with a 58-45 loss to power
house Old Dominion in the semifinals of the Colonial
Athletic Association conference tournament. Despite
the defeat, the Rams held the Monarchs to their lowest
point total of the season.
An honorable mention All-American as a high school
senior, Jackson finished with 3,108 career points for
Mardela Springs High School in Maryland. She went on
to star as a forward at the University of lowa, where she
was named as an honorable mention for the All-Big Ten
Conference team during her junior and senior years.
As a junior, Jackson led lowa to the Final Four in 1993
contributing 21 points in a loss to Ohio State. She was se
lected to the Mideast Region's all-tournament team for
her performance.
Four games into Jackson's senior year at lowa, she
suffered a season-ending injury. She decided to return
for a fifth season and led the team in scoring during the
1994-95 season with a 13.7 points per game average. She
finished eighth on lowa's all-time scoring list with 1,160
career points, while also placing seventh in steals with
168.
After graduating from lowa in 1995 with a B.A. in
media studies and film, Jackson went on to work at Vir
ginia Commonwealth beginning in 1996.
With the birth of women's professional basketball
leagues in the U.S. following the 1996 Olympics, Jackson
had the opportunity to resume her playing career. She
was selected ninth overall in the WNBA's inaugural draft
by the Phoenix Mercury, a team coached by the leg
endary Cheryl Miller.
Jackson played for the Mercury during the league's
first season in the summer of 1997, appearing in 26 regu
lar season games and reaching the league's semifinal
round with Phoenix. Playing in the Mercury front court,
Jackson averaged 12.3 minutes and 2.8 points per game.
Slowed by injuries, and unable to play up to her previ
ous level, Jackson was waived by the Mercury, following
training camp in 1998.
Although she likely could have found another spot in
the league, Jackson opted to pursue her duties as a coach
and became involved in both on and off-campus work at
Virginia Commonwealth.
The Cardinal exited early from the NCAA tourna
ment in March for the second consecutive year, falling to
Maine 60-58 in their first round game. Stanford is coming
off a dismal 18-12 year in which they finished out of the
top 25 rankings for the first time in 12 years.
However, the outlook is promising for the Cardinal
who only lost one player, Regan Freuen, to graduation.
Stanford will add freshman point guard Jamie Carey

to its cast of 13 returning players.
"[Carey] runs the halfcourt offense," VanDerveer
said.
"She can shoot the three. She's kind of a Jamila Wide
man with a three-point shot."
Despite the emergence of Milena Flores last season,
Carey's presence will likely move Flores from the point
to the off guard position. As a junior during the 1998-99
season, Flores earned All-Pacific -10 Conference honors
and posted seven double-doubles in points and assists.
Additionally, she reached fifth in the Stanford records
for career assists, ending the season with 466.
Sophomore Lindsey Yamasaki should continue to im
prove after leading the team in scoring as a freshman last
year with an average of 14 points per game. However, she
is coming off surgery to repair a damaged patella tendon,
leaving her health to be tested in the fall.
Carey should mix well with the young returning squad
to pose a formidable challenge to the rest of the Pac-10.
The only questions facing the team involve the extent
to which Yamasaki is able to recover from surgery and
the necessary improvement of the Cardinal's inside
game.
Juniors Carolyn Moos and Sarah Dimson, though
they both recorded good number last year, will need to
continue improving this season to strengthen Stanford's
presence under the basket.
Jackson and Carey will undoubtedly be key additions
to the team this season. Carey should be able to make an
immediate contribution to the Cardinal's play this sea
son, while Jackson's experience in scouting and on-court
coaching will prove to be an intangible resource for the
team.
