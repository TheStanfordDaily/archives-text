### Emil Dizon Contributing writer 
For Lori and Ronnie Fair, soc
cer's all in the family. Lori, a mem
ber of the U.S. Women's World
Cup team, can now congratulate
sister Ronnie, a Stanford women's
soccer team member, on her recent
athletic achievement.
Last week, the U.S. Soccer Fed
eration named Ronnie to the
Under-21 (U-21) Women's nation
al team. The team will compete in
this month's Nordic Cup in Ice
land.
A two time, all Pacific-10 con
ference selection, Fair had six goals
and two assists in 20 appearances
for Stanford last season.
This national team will be the
second U-21 national team the
Stanford midfielder from Los
Altos has made. Fair has also
played on the U-20 national team
in 1998 and earned two caps for the
U.S. national team that same year.
On Aug. 2, the U.S. began the
tournament with a 1-0 victory over
Finland in Stjorn, Iceland.
Fair started the game on a de
fenders' line that only surrendered
two shots on goal by the Finns.
The game's lone goal came
when Notre Dame's Jen Streiffer
blasted the ball in from 20 yards out
in the 22nd minute.
"We were pleased with the re
sult," said Coach Lauren Gregg,
whose team sits second in Group 2
behind Denmark, which defeated
Germany, 3-1.

"Finland's low pressure and
condensed defense can be frustrat
ing to play against, hut our players
stayed focused, got a goal and got
the job done."
"Although this is one the
youngest teams we've brought to
the Nordic Cup, it's a team that
promises to uphold the tradition of
excellence of our women's national
team program," said Gregg.
"They have prepared hard aU
year and have had great success to
date. We have some wonderful at
tacking personalities."
The Nordic Cup is an eight
team tournament that brings some
of the strongest U-21 women's na
tional teams together. The teams
compete in two groups of four in
the preliminary round.
At the conclusion of this round,
the groups' winners play each
other for the championship, while
the second place teams play for
third place, the third place teams
play for fifth place, and the fourth
place teams play for seventh place.
"It's important that all of our
women's national teams strive for
the same standard," said Gregg,
who has served as an assistant
coach on all three U.S. world
championship teams.
"These players are clearly in
strumental in our quest to win in
the future.
"You will see some of them
compete for residency spots and
positions on our Olympic roster,
and an even larger number on our
next Women's World Cup team."
