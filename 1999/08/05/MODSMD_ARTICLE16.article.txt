## 'Dick' proves comic Watergate scandal unzipped by teenagers 
### Michael Baer Contributing writer 
"Dick: The Unmaking of the President" is
marketed as a wacky '70s comedy about Wa
tergate — "Clueless" meets "All the
President's Men."
However, a more accurate description
would be "Forrest Gump" meets Oliver
Stone's "Nixon." Like "Forrest." "Dick"
takes a fictional story and seenilessly weaves
it into history, with the main characters as
hidden and unwitting forces in the events of
the time.
Like "Nixon," "Dick" tells the story of
Watergate, showing us the President's advi
sors and their collective downfall, hypothe
sizing how certain events occurred. As
"Dick" director Andrew Fleming ("Three
some") notes, "Nobody has proof that they
didn't."
The way things happen in "Dick," is that in
1972. two stereotypically styled and man
nered fifteen-year-olds stumble across G.
Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer of "The Simp
sons" and "This is Spinal Tap"), while Liddy
is directing the break-in at the Democratic
National Committee at Watergate.
Of the girls, it is the awkward and intro
verted Arlene Lorenzo (Michelle Williams of
"Dawson's Creek"), who lives in the Water
gate and Betsy Jobs (Kirsten Dunst from
"Wag the Dog" and "Interview with the
Vampire"), who comes up with the idea of
taping the hotel door unlocked so they can
sneak back in after hours.
Unfortunately for the burglars, the taped
door is found, and police show up. Soon
thereafter, on a tour of the White House, the
girls bump into Liddy once again, much to the

chagrin of the White House staff who are in
on the break-in. President Richard "Call me
Dick" Nixon (Dan Hedaya of "First Wives
Club") decides to make them White House
dog-walkers, so he can find out what they
know and make sure they don't tell anyone
else.
However White House access, combined
with their general cluelessness, means that
Betsy and Arlene keep stumbling across
things they shouldn't. It takes them a while to
figure things out. and before they put two and
two together. Arlene falls for the President.
Her love message to Dick explains not
only how they finally find out his knowledge
of Watergate, but also one crucial aspect of
the scandal itself. The SALT I breakthrough
with Soviet General Secretary Brezhnev and
the end of the war in Vietnam are given simi
larly far-fetched explanations.
Although such scenes might make a few
eyes roll, it is ultimately this type of historical
fictionalization which makes the film so fun,
in spite of the fact that many of the jokes go
limp.
Although the timeline, (not to mention
the reasoning), behind the events at the end
of the Nixon presidency is questionable, the
characterization of the important players in
the scandal is right on the mark. Hedaya and
the quietly arrogant Henry Kissinger (Saul
Rubinek). both of whom had smaller parts in
Oliver Stone's "Nixon." play their roles to
the letter.
Other White House staff also fare well in
their roles, as they protect their President and
worry that the girls know too much. Much of
the staff is played by current and former cast
members of "Saturday Night Live" and "Kids
in the Hall." as are the "muckraking bastards

from the Washington Post," Boh Woodward
(Will Ferrell) and Carl Bernstein (Bruce Mc-
Culloch).
The reporters provide the most comedic
aspects of the film; according to "Dick."
Woodward and Bernstein uncover the scan
dal in spite of their petty rivalry and general
incompetence.
The pop culture of the 70s. slightly — and
one might argue unnecessarily — exaggerat
ed. is generally used well, capturing the era in

spirit, if not minutiae, with some nods to cur
rent times. The use of '70s music in the sound
track is wonderful, especially in the priceless
finale.
Overall, "Dick" is a satisfying film. I
wouldn't demand that you see it tonight, but
if you do miss it in the theaters, be sure to give
it a try on video.
