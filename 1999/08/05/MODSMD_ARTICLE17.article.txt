# 'Thomas Crown': an affair to remember
## Pierce Brosnan stars as billionaire looking for thrills and adventure outside the law 
### Michael Baer Contributing writer 
Pierce Brosnan says he wants to
escape being typecast as James
Bond.
So. he took a role in the new re
make based on 1968's "Thomas
Crown Affair," as an elite, jet-set,
billionaire businessman who in
dulges himself in a little, multimil
lion dollar burglary after mergers
and acquisitions gets a bit too dull.
Too close? Hardly.
Crown is a much more human
character than Bond. Could we envi
sion a flick in which 007 pays regular
visits to his psychiatrist (Faye Dun
away, who co-starred in the original

"Thomas Crown")?
Although he's slick, he's neither
sleazy nor a cardboard cut-out char
acter. He keeps at his original mis
sion. but he alters his overall plans
once his antagonist, insurance inves
tigator Catherine Banning (Rene
Russo of "In the Line of Fire"),
shows up. NYPD investigators
(Denis Leary of "Wag the Dog,"
Frankie Faison of "Silence of the
Lambs") contribute to both the in
vestigation and the movie, but mini
mally; it's pretty much Thomas and
Catherine from the moment they
meet.
At the start of the movie.
Crown's day starts out like any
other, a quick stop to admire a paint

ing at the museum, then off to work,
decimating willing opponents who
are ready to pay $30 million more,
(or sell for $30 million less), than he
would ask in their deals. In Banning
he senses a worthy opponent, and,
later, a kindred soul. Their cat-and
mouse courtship is handled well and
intrigues the viewer, while not alto
gether avoiding the cliches which
hamper such films as. well, the
"James Bond" series.
Unlike the original "Thomas
Crown," in this movie it is a painting,
not bank money, which is stolen, and
that sets up a wonderful story in
volving delightful theft and investi
gation scenes. These start from the
first, in which, after a hard day at

work. Crown just waltzes into the
museum and picks up a $ 1 (K) million
Monet. Of course, there's an elabo
rate set-up, but it is set up so won
derfully that his waltz seems plausi
ble. at least within the context of the
film. In spite of this good start,
"Crown" saves the best for last.
Throughout the film, the acting is
very good, the story is very interest
ing and the photography is breath
taking. And yet it all never really
gels until the captivating third act,
when Crown lays out his hand and
Banning must decide whether or not
she can trust a man she's been hired
to nail. Will Banning trust him? Will
Crown bet his life on that trust?
In many films, the last scene is the

payoff. In this one, it's the last half
hour. Does that make this worth
your $8? Well, "Crown" has more
than a few of the same techniques of
classic caper films, (as well as the
naked bodies of the costars, a tech
nique used by any movie director
hoping for a mainstream audience).
However, the film also manages
to serve those techniques in a know
ing and original manner, with intelli
gent dialogue. And it is all served in
a fascinating, fun, thrilling plot
which never confuses the audience.
Considering what else is out
there, I'd say "The Thomas Crown
Affair" is a pretty safe bet.
