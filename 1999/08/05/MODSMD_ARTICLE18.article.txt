## Mxpx brings punk show to your living room Even without the screaming teenage girls, live album is fun as an actual concert 
### Jung Lah Contributing writer 
A lot of the time, a punk rock
band's ability to put on a good live
show is a lot more important to them
than being able to sell millions of
records.
Magnified Plaid, better known as
Mxpx, follows this time-tested for
mula on their latest offering from
indie label Tooth and Nail Records:
just play straight forward rock n' roll
and have a lot of fun.
After four full-length albums, an
album full of B-sides and demos, an
inclusion on multiple compilations,
Mxpx has released "At the Show," a
new album showcasing twenty-three
live tracks recorded in Washington
DC and Philadelphia in 1998. Pro

duced, engineered and mixed by the
Descendants' Bill Stevenson and
Stephen Egerton, this record is a
musically tight-sounding represen
tation of Mxpx at their best — live
and full of energy.
The recordings are crystal clear,
the sound levels are excellent, and
the crowd in the background is into
the performance enough to have
their presence felt, but not so much
so that they become annoying.
The songs Mxpx plays on the
record are mostly from "Life in
General" and "Slowly Going the
Way of the Buffalo." the band's last
two full-lengths. This material defi
nitely has more of a pop-punk feel
than some of their older stuff, but its
accessibility does not detract from
its super-fast drum beats and nicely

composed harmonies. One of the
newer songs, "Fist Vs. Tact," is a
straight up hard-core piece that has
vocalist Mike Herrera yelling out in
distinguishable lyrics, harkening
back to the old-school Mxpx sound.
Fortunately, songs from the band's
early albums are not entirely ne
glected on the track listings. Their
inclusion gives a great feel for how
the band sounded back in 1992,
when they were still in high school,
pounding out three-chord sing
along choruses and furious back
ground vox.
Admittedly, there is nothing that
different about the live versions of
these songs compared to their stu
dio-recorded counterparts.
Mike and guitarist Tom's various
insertions of "Right!" and "Yeah!"

along with sped up tempos and a bit
of audience participation is certainly
enough to please any loyal Mxpx fan.
But it is probably not enough of a dif
ference to be worth the money for
anyone who bought the band's last
album just to hear the song "I'm Ok,
You're Ok." That single, along with
popular swing song "Chick Magnet."
are included on "At the Show."
But also included are the jam ses
sion-like. instrumental "The Theme
Fiasco," a great upbeat cover of the
Ramones song, "KKK Took My
Baby Away." and the girls-are-evil
anthem "GSF." The presentation
may not be shocking or particularly
innovative, but it certainly is well
performed and fun to listen to —
which, of course, is the point of the
album in the first place.

It's always nice to hear a band
who knows how to enjoy them
selves. Mxpx puts on a solid show,
and perhaps the most disheartening
moment of the album is after the last
song, when the crowd is chanting for
an encore but then the record simply
ends. This phantom encore seems
almost intentionally left out. A puz
zling moment, but nothing to cry
about. The rest of "At the Show"
will be sure to please anyone with a
penchant for melodic punk, and
apart from the crowd surfers and
screaming teenage girls, this is as
close to being at an Mxpx show as
vou can get.
