## Bank of the West pairs high-tech with high society

They were four well-dressed ladies, obviously mid
dle-aged, who sat in front of me on the grass, pouring
champagne from a bottle into plastic glasses as they
passed around fresh sushi and hors d'oeuvres. In the
background a live swing band belted out the hits from
decades past.
"Where was I?" you ask.
A garden party in Menlo Park? Nope.
How about the celebration for another Internet
start-up's IPO? Come on, sports writers don't get invit
ed to those shin-digs.
A professional sporting event? You got it.
There I was, last Friday night at the Bank of the West
Classic at Stanford's Taube Family Tennis Stadium,
surrounded by fans who were, shall we say, quite differ
ent from the famed Dog Pound at Cleveland Municipal
Stadium or the Bleacher Bums of Chicago's Wrigley
Field.
If there was an event that captured every stereotype
of Silicon Valley society in one fell swoop, this was it.
From the high-tech corporate sponsors to the upscale
food items to the investment and venture captial firms
which set up booths along the stadium's entrance — you
felt a little like you were trapped in a Nordstrom's com
mercial.
I guess I'm a purist when it comes to sports. Candle
stick Park will always be Candlestick Park.
And while I'm a little too young to call them the
Brooklyn Dodgers, I wonder if Wimbledon, the oldest
and most revered of professional tennis tournaments,
needs all of these trappings.
Despite the obvious influence of coporate America,
the one thing that should not be lost in all of this is that
the event featured some great tennis as well.
The July 30 quarterfinal match pitted Venus
Williams of the U.S. against Russian Anna Kournikova

in a showdown of two of the game's brightest young
stars. Behind a booming serve and powerful ground
strokes, Williams moved onto the semifinals with a
straight set win.
The future of women's tennis was on display as both
players, each under 20 years old, showcased the talents
which have put them atop the world rankings.
One of the most interesting parts of the night was the
cheering from the boisterous sold-out crowd of 4,500
fans. Kournikova, a crowd favorite wherever she plays,
especially among the 15-45 year old male demographic,
was the clear favorite over Williams, a native Californ
ian.
Whatever happened to the Cold War on the playing
fields? This was certainly no Rocky IV with chants of U-
S-A booming throughout the stadium. It just goes to
show you that hormones win out over ideology every
time.
But the tennis remained. It was evident watching
Kournikova and Williams trade lashing forehands that
if you took away all the coporate logos, maybe even the
prize money, that these two would be out there playing
for the sheer love of the game.
Such determination was clearly on display in the
night's second contest — a quarterfinal doubles match
between Chanda Rubin of the U.S. and her partner
Sandrine Testud of France and Americans Lisa Ray
mond and Marie Joe Fernandez.
By the time the match had started, a huge chunk of
the crowd had piled out of the grandstands. About as
many fans remained in the seats as were pressed against
the glass of the pressroom trying to catch a glimpse of
Kournikova in her post-match press conference.
Yet Rubin and Testud, Fernandez and Raymond
played well into the night under the lights in front of a
small crowd of dedicated fans.
You could almost imagine the court without all the
trappings and the luxury tents. Just four women playing
tennis for the game itself.
