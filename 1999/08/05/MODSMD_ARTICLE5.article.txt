## New wing of Green Library ready for use Official opening set for October after ten-year long renovation 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
One of the final chapters of the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake has
been closed and history written as the
new Green Library west wing opens
to the public.
Green West, officially dubbed the
Bing Wing, was named after Univer
sity benefactors Peter and Helen
Bing. The new facility underwent
Aug. 2 what Deputy University Li
brarian Karen Nagy terms a "soft
opening," which allows the building
to be used by patrons and configured
for general use later this year.
The official opening of the reno
vated facility is slated for mid-Octo
ber.
"We are very excited to finally be
opening [Green West] up." Nagy
said. "After such a long wait. I
wouldn't be lying to say that we are
ready to use the new building."
The opening caps a ten-year, near
ly $50 million reconstruction project
initially prompted by damage sus
tained during the 1989 earthquake.
Since then, the historic West Wing
has undergone internal and external
modifications to. as Nagy said, "dra
matically improve the infrastructure
of the building."
Both the Bing Wing and the other
wing, now called Green Library East,
have had their physical spaces and ser
vices redone to better serve patrons.
"The renovation project was un
dertaken to bring the structure up to
current building safety codes, to
beautify the original vision of the
building and to make the facility suit
able for taking the University into the
next century, both academically and
technologically." Nagy said.
Before the earthquake, Green
West housed nearly 1 million vol
umes. The University's first step was
to build the Stanford Auxiliary Li
brary to store the collection before
construction could begin.
Major seismic damage from the
quake forced the University to shut
down Green West, which first opened
in 1919. In the decade since its closure,
the repair project has been plagued by
what Nagy terms "all sorts of compli
cated delays."
The University faced a challenge
in fundraising the project. Officials
worked with state agencies to give the
project a "historic renovation" status,
which consequently allowed the Fed
eral Emergency Management

Agency to provide some funding.
Then, in 1995, construction en
countered further difficulties when
the project's initial architects went
bankrupt, and the University had to
find a new design team.
Nagy said that patrons can expect
tours and orientation sessions to fa
miliarize them with the new resources
now available from.
A new complex
The Bing Wing is a five-story
structure that will, in conjunction with
Green East and Meyer Library, serve
the needs of library users at Stanford.
Nagy said.
The first floor contains the Social
Sciences Resource Center, which
consists of social science reference
materials, as well as the Jonsson Col
lection of Government Documents,
formerly housed in the basement of
Meyer Library.
There is a Humanities and Area
Studies Resource Center on the sec
ond floor and reading rooms for the
University's special collections and
archives.
The third and fourth floors contain
offices for technical processing and li
brary friends and donors, as well as
additional reading rooms.
The fifth floor houses the Bender
Room, which Nagy called "an ab
solutely beautiful reading room that

looks out over the Quad." This room
is also home to the "Gentleperson's
Reading Room." funded by Stanford
Bookstore, when it donated $100,000
and 10,000 books in 1997, in honor of
its centennial anniversary.
Green West's opening will also ne
cessitate a reorganization of both
Green East and Meyer.

According to Green Library offi
cials, the goal of the redeployment is
to place library collections adjacent to
the associated centers and programs.
For example, major disciplinary col
lections in the humanities will be kept
adjacent to the Humanities and Area
Studies Reading Room.
The move is scheduled to start by
the middle of this month and is ex
pected to continue for three or four

months. All collections will remain
available to users during the reloca
tions.
In Green East the Current Period
icals reading room will be moved
from the basement and integrated
with the reference desk to form a new
Information Center on the first floor.
The South Mezzanine and the

connecting area that currently con
tains the Jonsson Library will be filled
with general collections.
Meyer Library will largely house
technical services and academic com
puting resources.
There will also be a new entrance
to Green on the Hoover Tower-fac
ing side of the building.
Nagy said that Green West will
have increased student study areas
and include several hundred reader
seats, each equipped with computer
power and networking capabilities.
Almost every seat in the library
will provide Internet, catalog, data
base and other electronic resource ac
cess to laptop computer users.
A re-organization of services and a
renovation of existing space is also
planned, beginning with the redesign
of Green East's first floor services
area this summer.
Melding the old and the new
The original library was dedicated
in 1919 as the new building of Stan
ford University Libraries. Formerly
referred to as the Main Library,
Green West took its name following
the completion of Cecil H. Green Li
brary, now Green East, in 1989.
University Archivist Maggie Kim
ball said that the Main Library was
built to last 50 years based on the size
of its collections, even though its life
has been considerably longer.
"The building really exceeded

everyone's expectations, as the reno
vated library is doing today," Kimball
said.
Kimball added that visiting alumni
and University veterans have nothing
but praise for the renovated Green
West.
"[Alumni] response is very posi
tive. Everyone feels like this is a defi
nite improvement," she said.
Kimball said that it was imperative
during the restoration that much of
the original structure be preserved
which equipping the facility techno
logically for the 21st century.
"When students enter from the en
trance facing the Quad, they will see
the grand staircase, refurbished simi
larly to that of 1919," Kimball said.
Other rooms, such as the Bender
Room on the fifth floor, possess the
exact floor plan as when the building
opened, with a twist.
"The skylight covers, which give
the room so much light today, were
removed for the first time since World
War II," she said. "I think that the
[Bender Room] is among examples of
positive improvements upon the orig
inal building."
Green West is not the only build
ing on campus that has been restored
to its "early period" form while being
prepared for the next century. Build
ing 30 is another such building.
"There is a rationale to melding
the 'old' and the 'new,'" Kimball said.
"I think that we have succeeded
here."

Bookstore, when it donated $100,000
and 10,000 books in 1997, in honor of
its centennial anniversary.
Green West's opening will also ne
cessitate a reorganization of both
Green East and Meyer.

According to Green Library offi
cials, the goal of the redeployment is
to place library collections adjacent to
the associated centers and programs.
For example, major disciplinary col
lections in the humanities will be kept
adjacent to the Humanities and Area
Studies Reading Room.
The move is scheduled to start by
the middle of this month and is ex
pected to continue for three or four

months. All collections will remain
available to users during the reloca
tions.
In Green East the Current Period
icals reading room will be moved
from the basement and integrated
with the reference desk to form a new
Information Center on the first floor.
The South Mezzanine and the

connecting area that currently con
tains the Jonsson Library will be filled
with general collections.
Meyer Library will largely house
technical services and academic com
puting resources.
There will also be a new entrance
to Green on the Hoover Tower-fac
ing side of the building.
Nagy said that Green West will
have increased student study areas
and include several hundred reader
seats, each equipped with computer
power and networking capabilities.
Almost every seat in the library
will provide Internet, catalog, data
base and other electronic resource ac
cess to laptop computer users.
A re-organization of services and a
renovation of existing space is also
planned, beginning with the redesign
of Green East's first floor services
area this summer.
Melding the old and the new
The original library was dedicated
in 1919 as the new building of Stan
ford University Libraries. Formerly
referred to as the Main Library,
Green West took its name following
the completion of Cecil H. Green Li
brary, now Green East, in 1989.
University Archivist Maggie Kim
ball said that the Main Library was
built to last 50 years based on the size
of its collections, even though its life
has been considerably longer.
"The building really exceeded

everyone's expectations, as the reno
vated library is doing today," Kimball
said.
Kimball added that visiting alumni
and University veterans have nothing
but praise for the renovated Green
West.
"[Alumni] response is very posi
tive. Everyone feels like this is a defi
nite improvement," she said.
Kimball said that it was imperative
during the restoration that much of
the original structure be preserved
which equipping the facility techno
logically for the 21st century.
"When students enter from the en
trance facing the Quad, they will see
the grand staircase, refurbished simi
larly to that of 1919," Kimball said.
Other rooms, such as the Bender
Room on the fifth floor, possess the
exact floor plan as when the building
opened, with a twist.
"The skylight covers, which give
the room so much light today, were
removed for the first time since World
War II," she said. "I think that the
[Bender Room] is among examples of
positive improvements upon the orig
inal building."
Green West is not the only build
ing on campus that has been restored
to its "early period" form while being
prepared for the next century. Build
ing 30 is another such building.
"There is a rationale to melding
the 'old' and the 'new,'" Kimball said.
"I think that we have succeeded
here."
