## Fellows discuss salaries, status, living expenses; dispute resolutions Postdoctoral fellows gather for town meeting 
### Gargi Talukder 
Postdoctoral fellows from all over
the University, including the Biology
Department, the School of Engineer
ing and the Medical School, gathered
in Fairchild Auditorium for a town
meeting on Aug. 2 to discuss issues
such as salary, the cost of living in Palo
Alto and the official status of post
doctoral fellows at Stanford.
The meeting was organized by the
Stanford University Postdoctoral As
sociation, which was founded about a
year ago to promote social and pro
fessional interactions among the
1,2(X) postdoctoral fellows at Stan
ford. The town hall meeting was open
to the Stanford community and was
attended by more than 250 postdoc
toral fellows, graduate students, fac
ulty and administration.
Members of SUPD asked all the
postdoctoral fellows in the audience
to fill out a survey, which included
questions about their current salary
level, their living expenses and their

relationships with their principal in
vestigators.
The first speaker, Mark Siegal, a
biology postdoctoral fellow, outlined
the three main goals of the political
action committee of SUPD: develop
strategies to increase postdoctoral
salaries, clearly define the employ
ment status of postdoctoral fellows
and develop a set of guidelines for dis
pute resolutions involving postdoc
toral fellows.
Monica Torres, a postdoctoral fel
low in the Medical School, presented
data comparing the minimum salary
range of postdoctoral fellows at Stan
ford to the minimum salaries set by
the National Institutes of Health.
Torres said that although the min
imum salaries of first-year Stanford
postdoctoral fellows do match the
NIH standards, there is a marked dif
ference between the Stanford mini
mum and the NIH minimum for post
doctoral fellows with more than one
year of experience. For example, by
the time postdoctoral fellows reach

their fourth year of training, the NIH
minimum salary is $4,(XX) greater than
the Stanford minimum salary.
Torres further explained that if
cost of living is taken into account, the
Stanford minimum postdoctoral
earnings is the lowest in the U.S. out
side of Manhattan.
One of the changes that SUPD is
promoting is a raise in the Stanford
minimum salary for postdoctoral fel
lows. One suggestion proposed by the
group is to take the NIH minimum
salary and add the cost of living ex
penses in Palo Alto to set the Stanford
minimum salary.
Torres did note that many post
doctoral fellows at Stanford receive
supplements to their salary, which
raise them above the Stanford mini
mum salary. SUPD plans to use the
results of the survey distributed dur
ing the meeting to determine the av
erage postdoctoral salary at Stanford.
A member of the audience sug
gested that rather than a salary in
crease that would simply "cost us

more in taxes," the University should
subsidize housing for postdoctoral
students. Torres answered bv quoting
the official University policy regard
ing housing, which states that due to
the limited amount of housing avail
able on campus, postdoctoral fellows
are a "minimum priority" with "no
realistic chance" for subsidized hous
ing.
Kent Grindstaff, a postdoctoral
fellow at the Medical School, intro
duced the topic of the official status of
postdoctoral fellows at Stanford.
There is no universal classification
for postdoctoral fellows across the
University, but most are designated
as "non-matriculated, non-degree
seeking students." Grindstaff noted
that Stanford is the only university in
the country that classifies its postdoc
toral fellows as students, rather than
as staff.
"However." Grindstaff said,
"Postdoc status is actually a very gray
area. The University does not really
look at us as real students."

As an example of the nebulous na
ture of postdoctoral status. Grindstaff
reiterated the point that although stu
dents at Stanford do have some
chance of receiving subsidized hous
ing. postdoctoral fellows have virtual
ly no chance of getting Stanford subsi
dized housing.
Graduate students also do not
have to pay taxes on the parts of their
stipend that go toward tuition. How
ever. Grindstaff said, some postdoc
toral fellows — depending on their
funding — have to pay taxes on not
only their tuition, but also on any re
imbursement received for attending
professional meetings.
SUPD proposed that the Univer
sity institute a universal classification
for postdoctoral fellows, either as
University staff or as a completely
separate classification, so that all post
doctoral fellows on campus will have
an official, concrete designation.
