# Parking congestion continues

A suspicious piece of paper sits
on the windshield of your car as you
return from work. Hoping it might
just be a flyer advertising a new fla
vor of Jamba Juice, you reach for it
slowly, slowly, and see those dread
ful words: Santa Clara County
Parking Citation.
Police officers doled out 34,498
parking citations last year, accord
ing to Sgt. David Lee from the Pub
lic Safety Department. This is actu
ally a decrease from previous years,
with 38,546 tickets issued in 1996
and 35,896 in 1997.
Still, the overall high number of
citations highlights an issue many
students contend with — restricted
campus parking. Currently, resi
dents on campus cannot purchase
permits for residences other than
their own, and they cannot buy per
mits for "A." "C" or "Z" lots, which
are convenient parking areas for lo
cations like the Medical Center and
Tresidder Union.
Several students expressed frus
tration about this policy.
"There are times, in the winter
rain, or when I'm returning from
off campus and need to go straight
to class, that I think a universal

parking permit would be conve
nient," senior Amy Schultz said.
Louise Aryapour, Business
Manager of Parking and Trans
portation Services, however, ex
plained that "A" lots are reserved
for commuters, who are more de-

serving of parking spaces because
of other trade-offs they make.
"Resident students enjoy the
convenience of living on campus
and are not effected by a long corn

mute, traffic congestion and ex
tremely high housing costs," she
said.
Many students who understand
Aryapour's reasoning still feel that
while "A" lot restrictions are ac
ceptable, residential lots should

only require one standard permit.
