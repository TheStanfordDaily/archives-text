# Parking congestion continues
##

A suspicious piece of paper sits
on the windshield of your car as you
return from work. Hoping it might
just be a flyer advertising a new fla
vor of Jamba Juice, you reach for it
slowly, slowly, and see those dread
ful words: Santa Clara County
Parking Citation.
Police officers doled out 34,498
parking citations last year, accord
ing to Sgt. David Lee from the Pub
lic Safety Department. This is actu
ally a decrease from previous years,
with 38,546 tickets issued in 1996
and 35,896 in 1997.
Still, the overall high number of
citations highlights an issue many
students contend with — restricted
campus parking. Currently, resi
dents on campus cannot purchase
permits for residences other than
their own, and they cannot buy per
mits for "A." "C" or "Z" lots, which
are convenient parking areas for lo
cations like the Medical Center and
Tresidder Union.
Several students expressed frus
tration about this policy.
"There are times, in the winter
rain, or when I'm returning from
off campus and need to go straight
to class, that I think a universal

parking permit would be conve
nient," senior Amy Schultz said.
Louise Aryapour, Business
Manager of Parking and Trans
portation Services, however, ex
plained that "A" lots are reserved
for commuters, who are more de-

serving of parking spaces because
of other trade-offs they make.
"Resident students enjoy the
convenience of living on campus
and are not effected by a long corn

mute, traffic congestion and ex
tremely high housing costs," she
said.
Many students who understand
Aryapour's reasoning still feel that
while "A" lot restrictions are ac
ceptable, residential lots should

only require one standard permit.

dorm, some feel uncomfortable
moving around campus alone on
foot or on a bike.
"When I'm returning late at
night. I don't feel entirely safe rid
ing my bike back to GovCo, where
I have lived for the past two years,"
Schultz said.
Students unable to park their car
at other residences noted that this
was especially a problem around

one or two in the morning, after the
SURE Escort Service shuts down.
According to Aryapour, each
resident can only have a permit for
their own lot because space is so
limited.
"We are trying to protect resi
dent spaces for those who live in
high demand areas." she said.
However, the restrictions do not
seem to be alleviating parking con
gestion. Some students find them
selves in a dilemma because they
have no room to park in their own
lot and do not have a permit to park

in another lot.
"One time there was no parking
in the lot where I had a parking per
mit, so I had to park by the bollards
and as a result, I got a $25 parking
ticket," junior Vyl Chan said. "It's
not fair when you paid for a permit
and still get ticketed because there
are no parking spaces available."
As students complain about full
residence lots, the problem seems
to be a need for more parking
spaces.
Aryapour. however, noted a
problem with this easy solution.
"We must also adhere to Santa
Clara's General Use Permit, which
limits the number of parking spaces
we are allowed to build on cam
pus." she said.
Furthermore. Aryapour said
that many lots on campus are actu
ally not being fully utilized, and can
be incorporated into a answer to
parking problems.

"We are hoping our new Park
and Ride Marguerite Services,
starting Oct. 4. will promote the use
of our less expensive, under-used
lots, making more room available in
central campus," she said.
Other universities have had to
deal with similar parking problems.
At UC-Berkeley. for instance, stu
dents residing on campus cannot
purchase a permit unless they un
dergo a petition process.
"[Non-commuter] students must
write a letter to qualify their need
for parking on campus," said Bar
bara Cooper, asst. manager of UC-

Berkeley parking administration.
Even when resident students are
approved to hold a permit, they can
only park at the dorm where they
live.
UC-Berkeley students' parking
permits, designated for commuters,
are effective for peripheral lots
Monday through Friday (10 a.m. - 5
p.m.) at a rate of $49 per month.
Extra night/weekend parking can
be purchased for an additional
$24.50 per month.
In comparison Stanford students
can purchase dorm permits for $10
per month, valid 24 hours a day, 7

days a week.
With permits valid around the
clock, however, enforcement must
also be around the clock. The Dep
tartment of Public Safety has made
recent changes that may increase
the number of citations given out.
"Our daytime community ser
vice officers just started using a
hand-held ticket writer that looks
like a calculator. It's more efficient
because officers can spend less time
writing out each ticket," Lee said.
However, contrary to popular
belief, "all personnel who issue
parking citations within this depart

ment do not have a quota." Lee
said.
Although tickets generate about
$1 million for the county, they do
not provide any money for the Uni
versity.
"All parking citation revenues
go directly to Santa Clara County.
Neither Stanford University or the
Stanford Police Dept do not receive
any revenues from this operation,"
Lee explained.
"We have been unsuccessful in
our attempts to claim some of this
potential source of revenue."
Aryapour said.
