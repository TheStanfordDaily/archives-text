# Cash used as incentive to decrease local traffic

In efforts to reduce Peninsula
traffic. Stanford has been providing,
among other measures, financial in
centives for University employees
to find alternative means for getting
to work each day. as a part of the
"Clean Air Cash Rewards Pro
gram."
This fall, the University will pay
employees $144 to not drive to work
and will award up to $144 credit to
wards a carpool permit. This is an in
crease from the $90 amount work
ers received last year for keeping
their cars at home.
The Clean Air Credit program
was started in 1995. The net original
credit amount, after taxes, was set at
the cost of a "C" parking permit.
The credit amount has gone up over
the years as the cost of "C" permits
has increased.
Stanford is under strict limits to
curb the traffic congestion problem
in the area. Business Manager
Louise Aryapour of Parking and
Transportation Services explained,
"We must adhere to Santa Clara

County's General Use Permit,
which limits the number of parking
spaces we are allowed to build on
campus as well as monitors and con
trols the traffic generated by the
Stanford population."
At a recent Santa Clara commu
nity forum on future Stanford devel
opment plans, one resident ex
pressed a dissatisfaction with the
$144 sum. suggesting more people
may participate in the program if
the cash incentive was higher.
Aryapour explained. "While we
are constantly improving our incen
tives to the Clean Air participants,
we are limited by the funds available
to significantly boost the program."
"The only source of funding for
these incentives is our permit fees."
Aryapour added. Increases in Clean
Air incentives would mean equal in
creases in permit prices, a prospect
that may not be too popular among
the Stanford community, according
to Aryapour.
Currently, Stanford pays 2.51)0
employees to leave their cars at
home.
