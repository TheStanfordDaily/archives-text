## Therapy eases insomnia 
### Rajat Bhatnagar 
Would you be surprised if you
found out that 30 percent of people
today have trouble falling or remain
ing asleep?
The statistic is accurate according
to the Stanford Medical Center, and
that is why doctors and researchers at
the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic
are trying to find new ways to combat
sleeplessness.
At the beginning of this year. Dr.
Derek Loewy and acting Assoc. Prof,
of Psychiatry Rachel Manber found
ed the Insomnia Program at the Sleep
Disorders Clinic with the intention of
counseling insomniacs all over the
Bay Area and developing more effec
tive treatments.
According to Loewy. insomnia,
which is characterized by difficulty
falling asleep or awakening several
times during the night or very early in
the morning, is the most common
sleep disorder. Currently, wide
spread effective treatment of insom
nia is not available at the primary care
level.
Loewy and Manber's eight-week
treatment program, which consists
primarily of group therapy sessions, is
the first of its kind in the United
States. Its purpose is to develop a
technique that is more accessible to
patients.
"We want to come up with a stan
dardized treatment approach for in
somnia ... that we can then dissemi
nate to other public care profession
als in the community, such as nurse
practitioners, so that patients with the
need for insomnia treatment don't
have to go to a sleep specialty clinic."
explained Loewy.
The Insomnia Program relies on
cognitive-behavioral therapy, a treat
ment that helps patients adjust their
behaviors to facilitate sleeping, rather
than drug treatments.
"Research has shown that in head

to head trials between drug therapy
and behavioral therapy, both show
improvement up to about a year. But
after that, only the behavior therapy
maintains its gains." Loewy said.
Loewy explained that drug treat
ments slowly lose effectiveness as the
body develops tolerance to the medi
cine overtime.
At the Stanford Sleep Disorders
Clinic doctors first check potential
patients to make sure that they suffer
from insomnia and not another type
of sleep disorder. Then, patients in
the Insomnia Program meet in
groups of five to seven once a week.
The doctors seek, through group
therapy, to help the patients establish
a normal sleep-wake cycle with a reg
ular pattern, so that the patients can
sleep at night.
The directors of the Insomnia Pro
gram also try to correct common mis
conceptions about insomnia: for ex
ample. many people believe that nap
ping. drinking caffeine during the day
or drinking alcohol at night will help
them sleep properly.
However all of these disturb the
body's natural sleep cycle and can
even cause other problems, accord
ing to Loewy.
Although traditionally one-on
one counseling has been used in in
somnia treatments. Loewy believes
that group therapy also has its bene
fits. For example, group members can
provide support for each other re
garding their problems.
In the future. Loewy and Manber
plan to expand the research aspect of
their program. As people complete
the program, doctors will acquire
data and feedback so that they know
which techniques are most effective.
The main goal now is simply gaining
more exposure for the program with
in the immediate community.
"We find that there's a huge need
for [insomnia therapy], but the only
limitation is awareness," Loewy said.
