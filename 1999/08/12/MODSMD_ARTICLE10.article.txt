## 
### David Arulanantham Staff writer 
A large collection of letters, manuscripts,
photographs and hooks related to famed Cali
fornia writer and Nobel Prize winner John
Steinbeck has been recently acquired by the
Stanford Libraries.
The materials, purchased with a gift from the
Wells Fargo Foundation to the Stanford Li
braries, belonged to the family of Steinbeck's el
dest sister, Esther Steinbeck Rodgers. Known
as the Wells Fargo Steinbeck Collection, it in
cludes nearly 4(X) of the author's letters to his
family, unpublished poems and stories from his
early years, family photographs and a set of first
editions of his works personally inscribed to his
sister. Esther.
The importance of this collection to the Uni
versity can not be understated, say those re
sponsible for its acquisition.
"The Wells Fargo Steinbeck Collection
marks a quantum leap forward in the size and
quality of Stanford's holdings of Steinbeck ma
terial," said William McPheron, curator for
British and American literature at Stanford.
"It is a remarkable collection, unique in its
detailed revelation of Steinbeck's relation to his
immediate family throughout the course of his
life, from his childhood in Salinas and his stu
dent days at Stanford to his final years, after he

received the Nobel Prize and became a promi
nent national figure."
It will also come as a great boon for other re
searchers.
"Steinbeck is a major American literary fig
ure, and this collection in particular is virtually
new research material... it has not been used
for teaching or research and has not been avail
able to scholars," said Roberto Trujillo, head of
Special Collections.
Other universities that house collections on
Steinbeck include San Jose State University, the
University of Texas at Austin and the Universi
ty of Virginia.
Steinbeck wrote a number of internationally
acclaimed novels, including "Of Mice and
Men," "Cannery Row" and"The Grapes of
Wrath." Many of his works centered around the
people and places of California's Salinas Valley,
where he grew up.
He attended Stanford briefly in the 19205,
but left without finishing a degree. His profi
ciency as a writer earned him the Nobel Prize in
Literature in 1962.
According to McPheron, the acquisition of
these documents is part of Stanford's effort in
the past few decades to build a collection of pri
mary sources on Steinbeck because of the au
thor's stature in American literature, his focus
on California and his link to Stanford.
The recently acquired collection has been

under consideration for the past one-and-a-half
years, said Trujillo.
"We compared this collection to the holdings
Stanford already had on Steinbeck and deter
mined that indeed, this new collection would fit

our collection program and support Stanford's
teaching and research programs," he said.
The Wells Fargo Steinbeck collection he
came available to patrons Aug. 9 in the Depart
ment of Special Collections in Green Library.
