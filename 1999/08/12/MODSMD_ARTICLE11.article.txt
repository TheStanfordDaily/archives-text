## Battle over free speech continues at KPFA 
### Kyla Farrell Editorial staff 
KPFA. the Berkeley-based free
radio station, returned to the air on
Aug. 5 after the station's three
week lockout by its overseeing ad
ministrative organization, the Paci
fica Foundation.
However, as KPFA DJ and Stan
ford Communications lecturer
Larry Bensky stated at an Aug. 5
teach-in at the Unitarian Hall in
Palo Alto, "there's no sense of suc
cess for me in going back on the air
because this is just one skirmish in a
long battle."
Complex issue
A long, complicated skirmish it
has been.
"I've heard some stuff about
KPFA â€” that it's a non-commercial,
politically active station, but I'm re
ally not sure what's been going on
exactly," said Stanford junior Josh
Samuels, echoing the sentiments of
many Stanford students.
Berkeley may seem relatively
distant to the average Stanford stu
dent, however, as Stanford sopho
more Leanne Farrell said "some
times at Stanford it seems like we get
caught up in what's going on on cam
pus and forget that there's a bigger
world out there. It's important to re
alize that fighting for free speech
didn't end in the '60s but continues
today."
A large support group for the sta
tion is located in Palo Alto, as the
Aug. 5 packed teach-in attests. Ben
sky and other KPFA staff members
spoke to irate supporters on the cur
rent state of the negotiations be
tween KPFA and Pacifica. Uneasy
peace has been reached for now, but
the history of the struggle shows
that, with KPFA's passionate and
vocal listeners, nothing remains sta
ble for long.
KPFA catapulted into the na
tional spotlight on July 13 when
Dennis Bernstien. KPFA newscast
er. was arrested on air at the conclu
sion of his "Flashpoints" radio mag
azine show. He was removed from
the KPFA news room by armed
guards for violating a Pacifica-im
posed gag rule when he questioned
the organization's policies on the
air.
In the ensuing demonstration, 53
staff and community members were
arrested, and the station was taken
off the air by the Pacifica Founda
tion, which replaced programming
with archival tapes. This action

sparked three weeks of demonstra
tions, rallies and public outcry di
rected at Pacifica, while DJs and
KPFA staff members found them
selves locked out of the KPFA sta
tion.
Progressive coverage
The nation's oldest community
broadcaster, KPFA. is a non-com
mercial station started in 1949 by
pacifists. The founders were inter
ested in using radio to promote free
speech in opposition to the largely
corporate-dominated air waves.
The station's statement of intent,
as written on a sign inside the studio,
is "to promote cultural diversity and
pluralistic community expression.
To contribute to a lasting under
standing between nations and be
tween individuals of all nations,
races, creeds and colors. To pro
mote freedom of the press and serve
as a forum for various viewpoints.

To maintain an independent listen
er-supported funding base."
The non-profit Pacifica founda
tion was also established in 1949 to
hold KPFA's broadcast license, and
it now runs four other stations as
well in New York, Los Angeles,
Washington. D.C. and Houston.
KPFA has been broadcasting at
its frequency of 94.1 FM ever since,
covering controversial topics and al
ways providing an eclectic mix of
music, poetry, art criticism and po
litical news. The station also hosts a
pioneering apprenticeship pro
gram, providing a stepping stone for
women and minorities into the
broadcasting world.
However conflict has been fester
ing for years between Pacifica and

local stations over issues of democ
racy and local control, the expanse
of foundation budgets at the ex
pense of local stations, and Pacifica's
desire to make programming more
"mainstream" and less overtly left
wing.
Old struggle over control
The roots of the current struggle
between KPFA and Pacifica stretch
as far back as 1992, when Pacifica
began to make inquiries into mov
ing towards more NPR-like nation
al programming. At that time, man
agement began a gradual shift to
wards today's structure, in which
the Pacifica National Board dictates
policy for the stations. This shift cre
ated tension between the manage
ment and the stations, since in the
previous democratic model, the Na
tional Board had answered directly
to the individual station managers.
The pace began to pick up in
1998, when Lynn Chadwick was ap
pointed executive director of Pacifi
ca. Together, with Mary Frances
Berry, the Pacifica board chair,
Chadwick was instrumental in en
acting the changes to Pacifica man
agement that have outraged KPFA
broadcasters and supporters.
On Feb. 28. 1999 The Pacifica
National Board met in Berkeley
and decided, against local staff and
community protest, to remove local
advisory board members from its
national governance board.
Local advisory boards, which
met once a month to hear the con
cerns of listeners and volunteers,
had previously been the backbone
of community input into Pacifica
national policy. As a result of this
action, Pacifica became a complete
ly self-appointing body, with no

local representation.
This change in Pacifica's struc
ture prompted criticism from many.
"It just doesn't make any sense to
me that a station which supposedly
is for the people should be run in
such an undemocratic manner,"
said Stanford junior Maris Brenn-
White.
Firings incite protests
On March 31 KPFA's General
Manager, Nichole Sawaya, was

fired by Pacifica. Underlying the re
moval was the suggestion that the
station was not trying to reach be
yond its predominately leftist listen
ers.
Later that evening, a shot was
fired through the window of the
Pacifica office next door to the
KPFA station. No one was injured,
the gunman was never found, and
Chadwick, who had become the In
terim Acting General Manager of
KPFA, posted guards inside the sta
tion as a result.

Bensky, despite Chadwick's or
ders not to discuss the dismissal on
air, did so and was immediately
fired by Pacifica. One thousand
people demonstrated outside oi
KPFA on April 15, the station's
fiftieth birthday. Another mass
demonstration followed on May l ),
with 2,(XX) protesters gathering in
Berkeley's Martin Luther King. Jr
Park.
"What I don't understand is how
Pacifica has gotten away with all the
stuff it's been doing for so long, es
pecially with so many people up in
arms about it. And 1 haven't heard
anything anywhere about why they
decided to start firing people in the
first place. It's a big mystery." said
Jared Cluff. Class of 1999.
The firings continued on June IS.
with Pacifica's cancellation of Rob
bie Osman's popular folk music
show, "Across the Great Divide."
after he discussed the previous fir
ings on air.
Osman had been a DJ at KPFA
for over two decades. Two hours of
dead air replaced Osman's show
while hundreds protested outside
the station.
Point of no return
Tension continued to increase

when Pacifica replaced unarmed
guards with armed special investiga
tors on June 26. On July 12, an e
mail written by Houston Pacilica
Board member Michael Palmer dis
cussing the immediate sale of KPFA
for $70 million was inadvertently re
ceived by the San Francisco-based
media watchdog group. Media Al
liance, adding more fuel to the al
ready bright flames of outrage.
The situation climaxed on July
