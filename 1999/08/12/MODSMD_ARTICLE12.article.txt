## 'Mickey Blue Eyes' incites laughs and delight Grant bats his eyes, looks flustered and wins with that good old Englishman charm 
### Michelle Wang 
In his latest romantic comedy,
"Mickey Blue Eyes," Hugh Grant
once again charms audiences with his
trademark stammering and fluttering
eyelashes.
Grant stars as Michael Felgate, an
art dealer whose fiancee, Gina
(Jeanne Tripplehorn), is the daughter
of a mobster, Frank (James Caan).
Gina is adamant that Michael
should not follow in the footsteps of
her previous boyfriends, who were all
coerced by her relatives to join the
mob. The movie follows the antics of
Michael as he succumbs to the pres
sure of Gina's relatives, especially her
Uncle Vito, the head of the Graziosi
crime family.
As a favor, Michael auctions a
painting by Vito's son, unwittingly
laundering money for them. When
the Mafia returns the favor by burn
ing down the rival auction house,

Sotheby's, Michael realizes too late
what he has gotten himself into. All
the while, he attempts to hide his in
creasing involvement in the mob from
Gina.
Frank takes Michael under his
wing, teaching him how to survive in
the family and providing humorous
lessons on how to be a mobster.
Frank's calm self-assurance offsets
Michael's endearing awkwardness.
To blend into crime society. Michael
poses as Mickey Blue Eyes, a reputed
mobster. This charade is a highlight of
the movie, particularly Michael's
English-accented butchering of mob
ster lingo.
In 'Mickey Blue Eyes," Grant is a
charming English gentleman in over
his head by the events around him.
But he goes beyond his previous
comedic roles of "Four Weddings and
a Funeral," "Nine Months" and "Not
ting Hill" by being more willing to hu
miliate himself. In one scene, Michael

tries to distract Gina from seeing a
mobster painting by doing a goofy
semi-striptease (which does not get
very far). These antics, along with his

understated delivery of hilarious
lines, carry the movie.
Tripplehorn is beautiful, smart
and sexy, but her performance is

somewhat bland. As the daughter of a
mobster, she would benefit from hav
ing more personality. She and Grant
lack onscreen chemistry, but this ma\
be because the romantic aspect of the
movie is secondary to the humor, in
fact. Grant seems to spend more time
onscreen with her father. Frank, than
with her.
The movie both employs and
mocks traditional stereotypes of
mobsters and Englishmen and in
cludes a talented supporting cast. The
owner of the auction house is delight
fully clueless, and the other members
of the Mafia, especially the head of a
rival family, are tough and comic.
Overall. "Mickey Blue Eyes" is a
unique comedy, succeeding in elicit
ing laughter.
Unfortunately, when the movie
briefly shifts to dramatic scenes, non
of the characters are very convincing.
Fortunately, this doesn't happen
much.
