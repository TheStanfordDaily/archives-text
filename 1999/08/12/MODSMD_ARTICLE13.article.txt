# Be ignorant of 'Bliss'
## Face to Face sells out for radio play 
### Jung Lah Contributing writer 
If I had a chance to talk to lead
singer and songwriter Trever Keith
of the southern California punk
rock band Face to Face, and I was
sure that he wouldn't beat me up,
the conversation might go some
thing like this:
Me: So, Trever, how come your
new album, "Ignorance Is Bliss,"
sucks so much?
Trever: Excuse me?
Me: Can I ask you why you com
pletely changed your musical style
to churn out thirteen songs of ultra
generic, alt-rock?
Trever: OK, you caught me. We
sold out. But we actually prefer the
term, "expanding our musical hori
zons."
And so on. I admit that perhaps
I'm being a bit harsh. Face to Face's
latest offering, distributed by BMG.
is just a radical departure from their
previous work. There is a difference
between growing musically and
catering to mainstream audiences
with songs fit to debut on LIVE 105
any day now.
Face to Face's last record, "Big
Choice," was their major label
debut, and their most successful re
lease to date. It showcased what the
band does best, namely, fast and
punky tunes. "Ignorance Is Bliss,"

however, is just a slowed-down,
cheesy version of "Big Choice."
Not only is it impossible to con
sider the new material punk rock,
but it is also puzzling as to why the
band decided to head down this par
ticular musical path.
Fast does not always equal more
energy, but the slower, new material
hasn't sacrificed tempo for technical
musician showmanship or sultry
emotional injection. To be honest,
punk is not the most difficult of gen
res to perform, so the slow tempo
makes the song writing sound mo
notonous and uninspired.
There is very little variety here,
and the same-ness of the tracks re
flects poorly upon the band's deci
sion not to include a single hard
edged rock 'n roll song, with perhaps
the exception of "I Know What You
Are." This song's liveliness provides
the only signs of life on the album,
but its chorus of "You're boring and
predictable" seems like a reference
to the rest of the album.
"Ignorance Is Bliss" does little to
showcase Face to Face's talent. The
closing lines of the record's last
song. "Maybe Next Time," have
Keith singing. "There's still a need
for something more. Wait until next
time."
Take Keith's advice; maybe next
time. Face to Face will come upon
something innovative and exciting.
