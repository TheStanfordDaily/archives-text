## Record-breaking week highlights baseball season 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
Ladies and gentlemen, baseball
is once again the national pastime.
After being plagued by the strike
in 1994, skyrocketing player salaries
and a free agency market which
leaves players changing teams more
often than you swap partners at a
square dance, the grand old game
has returned to its grand old self.
Baseball's renaissance began last
year with the epic home-run race
between sluggers Mark McGwire of
the St. Louis Cardinals and Sammie
Sosa of the Chicago Cubs. Their
race to eclipse Roger Maris' 37-
year-old record of 61 home runs en
ergized the game and returned
baseball to the forefront of media
and public attention.
Add to that the World Series vic
tory by the New York Yankees,
baseball's most legendary organiza
tion, and it almost felt like we'd re
turned to an earlier time with stars
such as Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays
and Sandy Koufax.
While this season has been with
out the crescendos of excitement of
last year, this past week will go
down as legendary in baseball histo
ry. Three of the game's greats added
their names to the record book, with
Mark McGwire joining the 500-
home-run club and Tony Gwynn
and Wade Boggs reaching the

3,(XX)-hit plateau.
First there was McGwire, this
generation's most prolific slugger
who blasted home runs S(X) and 501
on Aug. 5 in a win over San Diego,
earning him a berth in an extraordi
nary group of players. Becoming a
member of the 500-home-run club,
the standard for the game's power
hitters, McGwire joins Aaron, Ruth
and Mays as well as Ted Williams,
Mike Schmidt and others who rede
fined the game in the era of the
longball.
Such redefinition was clearly ev
ident last year when McGwire
rewrote the record books by blast
ing 70 home runs in one season,
eclipsing Maris' mark in a race
which captivated national audi
ences.
McGwire becomes the first play
er who began his career in the 1980s
to reach the 500 homer plateau, as
well as the player to reach 500 the
quickest. His record-setting pace
was so fast, that after hitting homer
number 499, McGwire could have
gone 0 for his next 312 at-bats and
still beat Babe Ruth's mark.
As McGwire reached the 500
mark, talk inevitably begins about
the drive to 600 and Aaron's record
of 755 career home runs. It is impos
sible to say whether McGwire, who
turns 36 two days before the season
ends, will reach this level, but keep
in mind that each group of 100 home

runs he has hit have come in succes
sively fewer games. Few sluggers
can match this accelerating home
run pace.
As they say in the commercials,
"chicks dig the longball," but Mc-
Gwire's achievement was not the
only memorable milestone of the
week. Two of the game's premier
contact hitters, who make their liv
ings not with home runs, but with
shots that stay in the ballpark,
reached the 3,CXX) hit level — the
gold standard for contact hitters.
Within days of each other, Wade
Boggs and Tony Gwynn joined the
elite ranks of the 3,000-hit club,
Gwynn lining a single to right
against Cincinatti and Boggs culmi
nating a three-hit night with a home
run to reach 3,000 — the first player
to reach that mark with a home run.
These two players, who came
into the league within four months
of each other in 1982, established
themselves as the best in each
league when it came to hitting for
average. Boggs in the American
League, Gwynn in the National, put
up marks unheard of since the leg
endary Ty Cobb — each hitting over
.350 for four consecutive years.
Gwynn, whose 3,000 th hit came
just a day after McGwire's achieve
ment on both his mother's birthday
and the anniversary of his 2,000 th
hit, has come to represent every
thing that is right about the game in

this era. The Padres 1 star has spent
his entire career with the organiza
tion, even commenting on how
playing for only the Padres made his
achievement even sweeter.
A professional, leader and role
model in the clubhouse, Gwynn has
become the icon of the unassuming
star in an era of big names, big con
tracts and Gotham-size egos.
Boggs, who has taken a more cir
cuitous route to his goal, has experi
enced the joy and sorrow of winning
and losing a World Series and being
the best in the game at his position

and struggling through a multi-year
slump.
The accomplishments of both
hitters as well as McGwire have
highlighted what has been a stellar
follow-up to 1998's season with tight
pennant races in both leagues and
superb play in New York, Cleve
land, Houston and Cincinatti.
With potential labor difficulties
on the horizon in 2001 and the con
tinuing saga of difficulties with the
league's umpires, baseball's stars
continue to illuminate its dark
spots.
