On Aug. 5, No. 2 seed Paul Goldstein, Class
of 1998, defeated No.l seeded U.S. teammate
Cecil Mamiit, 4-6,6-0,6-3, to win the gold medal
in men's singles at the 1999 Pan American
Games.
Goldstein became the first American to win
the gold medal in men's singles since 1983, when
Greg Holmes, that year's NCAA singles cham
pion, captured the prize. The Goldstein-Mamiit
final is the first-ever all-American gold medal
match in men's singles at the Pan Am Games.
Both Goldstein and Mamiit admitted that it
was difficult to play a teammate and a friend in
the final.
"We knew going in that we had gold and sil
ver wrapped up, so that took the burden off,"
said Goldstein. "It was a difficult match to play.
I thought we both competed well and handled
ourselves well, and hopefully we were good rep
resentatives of our country."
Although Mamiit began the match by break
ing Goldstein's serve to take a 1-0 lead, Gold
stein broke Mamiit's serve back to tie the set at
2-2.
After Mamiit won the first set, Goldstein

reeled off seven straight games, winning the sec
ond set and then taking a 1 -0 lead in the third set.
Goldstein then broke Mamiit's serve to take
a 3-1 lead, but Mamiit immediately broke back
and held serve to tie the score at 3-3. Goldstein
again broke Mamiit's serve, taking a 5-3 lead
and then served out the match at love to capture
the gold medal.
The Pan Am gold medal match was the
eighth career meeting between Goldstein and
Mamiit since they first met in 1990 at the USTA
National Boys' 14 Championships. The Aug. 5
win gives Goldstein his second victory in three
matches with Mamiit since both players turned
professional.
Goldstein competed for Stanford from 1995
through 1998. He is the only player in the histo
ry of the NCAA Team Tournament to play on
four national championship teams. Goldstein
was also an NCAA singles finalist in 1998, losing
to Bob Bryan.
As a professional, Goldstein extended three
time U.S. Open singles champion Pete Sampras
to four sets in the second round in the 1998 U.S.
Open. He also defeated 1997 U.S. Open finalist
and British Davis Cup star Greg Rusedski en
route to the third round of the 1999 Australian

Open.
Goldstein is currently ranked No. 109 in
ATP Tour singles rankings.
Mamiit became the first freshman since John
McEnroe to win the NCAA singles title when
he captured the title in 1996 at the USC. Cur
rently ranked No. 81 in the ATP Tour singles
rankings, Mamiit gained his first ATP Tour sin
gles title earlier this year, defeating Andre Agas
si and Michael Chang during the course of the
tournament.
Before the Pan Am Games, Scott McCain,
the U.S. men's tennis coach, said, "We have one
goal in Winnipeg, and that's to win as many
medals as possible for the United States. [These
players] are four of the most talented young
Americans in men's tennis and have bright fu
tures ahead of them. They are all eager to take
the courts, represent their country and win some
medals."
McCain's hopes were certainly fulfilled as
the United States finished the Pan Am Games
tennis competition with five gold medals, equal
ing the U.S. record. Twins Bob and Mike Bryan,
who left Stanford in 1998, also captured the
bronze medal in men's doubles.
Bob Bryan was a member of Stanford's 1997

and 1998 NCAA Team Tournament champion
squad and won the 1998 NCAA singles title, de
feating Goldstein in the final. Bryan also teamed
with his twin brother Mike to capture the 1998
NCAA doubles title.
Bryan joined Alex O'Brien of Stanford as
the only other player to win all three NCAA
tournament titles. In his first year as a profes
sional, Bryan is ranked No. 189 in the ATP Tour
singles rankings and No. 13 in team doubles
rankings with his twin.
Mike Bryan clinched Stanford's 1998 NCAA
Team Tournament title at No. 2 singles and
helped Stanford to the NCAA Team Tourna
ment Title in 1997, also playing No. 2 singles.
Bryan is currently ranked No. 399 in the ATP
Tour singles rankings.
His doubles results with his twin brother also
include winning the first 17 matches as a profes
sional and winning over reigning Australian
Open Double champions Patrick Rafter and
Jonas Bjorkman.
The Pan Am Games are held every four
years, the year before the Olympic Summer
Games. Over S,(XX) athletes from 42 Western
Hemisphere nations competed in 41 different
events, including all 35 Olympic sports.
