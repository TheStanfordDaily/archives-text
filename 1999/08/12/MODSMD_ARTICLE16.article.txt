# Stanford opens season second in national soccer poll

The road to Ericsson Stadium for the 1999
NCAA Men's College Cup has just turned a
shade of red. Cardinal red.
Coming off a record-breaking 1998 season,
the NCAA runner-up Stanford men's soccer
team received the No. 2 ranking in the presea
son National Soccer Coaches Association of
America Division 1 poll. Ranked ahead of the
Cardinal is Indiana, the defending NCAA
champion who bested Stanford in last year's
championship game.
Although this is one of Stanford's highest
rankings ever in a preseason men's soccer poll,
head coach Bobby Clark said that the rankings
do not tell the entire story.
"Preseason rankings mean very little," he
said. "A lot of that was earned by last year's
squad. This year's squad is a very different sit
uation."
Four Stanford seniors from last season
have joined the professional ranks, with Jamie
Clark playing for Major League Soccer's
(M LS) San Jose Clash, Sean Elliott joining the
Los Angeles Galaxy, and Shan Gaw and
Adam Seligman playing A-League soccer (the
farm system for MLS).
Bobby Clark said in the April edition of
Goals, a newsletter for Stanford men's soccer,
that his team needs the most work in the areas
of crossing and finishing. He added that the
team worked a great deal on those aspects last
spring.
"We worked a lot in the spring on crossing
and finishing," he said. "Getting crosses into

the box and people on the end of them."
Coach Clark named midfielders T.K. Ink
body and Derek Shanahan, who combined for
nine points last season (four goals, one assist),
as key players in that process. He also men
tioned Aaron Biddle, who did not play last
year, and Sean Sylvis, who saw limited playing
time before suffering a season-ending broken
leg as potential contributors to the Cardinal's
offensive attack.
Defensively, Stanford ranked second in the
nation during last year's regular season with a
.411 goals-against average. Their mark of 12
shutouts was also second in the country.
"I think we'll be well organized again," said
Bobby Clark. "We pride ourselves on being a
blue-collar team."
Junior Adam Zapala will return this season
as one of the most prolific goalkeepers in the
school history. He currently holds school
records in shutouts (27) and goals-against av
erage (0.61). Stanford will also return defend
er Lee Morrison, who started all 23 matches
last season as a freshman and tallied 13 points
on five goals, three assists.
The Cardinal welcomes a talented class of
seven newcomers, three of whom have played
on U.S. junior national teams. In addition to
new talent coming out of the high schools,
Stanford welcomes transfer Ryan Nelsen from
Greensboro College in North Carolina. At
Greesnboro last season, Nelsen scored 32
points (twelve goals, eight assists) en route to
leading his team to the NCAA Division 111
Final Four. This past summer, Nelsen played
for the New Zealand national team in the
FIFA Confederations Cup.

Bobby Clark said he hopes Nelsen can
make an impact on this year's squad.
"We've got some pretty special players
coming on," he said. "When you take a trans
fer student, you got to feel he can contribute."
This week, the squad will head for Scotland
for a 16-day trip, during which they plan to
play seven games. The team will be in resi
dence at Aberdeen University.
"The foreign tour provides us with a won
derful opportunity to play games against qual
ity foreign opposition," Bobby Clark said in
the newsletter. "We must take full advantage
of this situation which will present itself every
four years."
Stanford's regular season schedule will pit

the Cardinal against three ranked teams this
fall, including non-conference games against
No. 5 Santa Clara and No. 18 St. Louis and a
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match
with No. 11 Washington.
"A lot of people are excited," Bohbv Clark
said of the team coming off a runner-up finish
at last year's NCAA College Cup. "At the
same time, that's a pretty hard act to follow."
His players, though, seem up to the chal
lenge.
"[lt was a] tremendous achievement last
year getting to the championship game," said
Bobby Clark. "At the same time it whetted the
appetite of the returning players to repeat it
and take it a little further."
