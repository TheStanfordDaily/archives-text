Fair and U.S. capture Nordic Cup
With Stanford's Ronnie Fair
starting at defense, the U.S. Under
-21 national soccer team won the
Nordic Cup title with a 2-1 overtime
victory over Norway Aug. 8 in
Reykjavik, Iceland.
The U.S. scored just six minutes
into the sudden-death period to end
the game and reclaim the title,
which Norway had won in 1998.
After Norway scored in the
game's 75th minute, the U.S. an
swered just five minutes later to
knot the game at one and eventual
ly force overtime.
Fair, a vital member of the Stan
ford women's soccer team, made
her fourth start of the tournament in

the final, playing all 96 minutes of
the match. Her effort keyed the U.S.
defense, which held the Norwegians
to just one goal.
The U.S. and Norway have
played in the Nordic Cup final the
last three years with the Americans
capturing the title in 1997, the Nor
wegians answering back in 1998 and
this year's U.S. victory.
The win completes a unique
triple this year for the U.S. women's
soccer program. The national team
captured this year's Women's
World Cup and the Under-18 na
tional team won the gold medal at
last week's Pan Am Games.
