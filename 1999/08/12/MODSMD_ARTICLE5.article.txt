## Top executives resign from UCSF-Stanford 
### Sylvia Lin Contributing writer 
UCSF-Stanford Health Care Pres
ident Peter Van Etten and Executive
Vice President William Kerr an
nounced their resignations on Aug. 9.
The departure of UCSF-Stanford
Health Care's top two executives fol
lows six days after University of Cali
fornia President Richard Atkinson
and University President Gerhard
Casper issued a letter calling for a "re
assessment" of the current merger.
The letter also announced that a
final decision of the merger's future
would be made by the UCSF-Stan
ford Board of Directors by Oct. 1,
which would determine whether or
not the two institutions should remain
merged.
In the interim, management of
UCSF-Stanford Health Care has
been turned over to David Hunter of
the Hunter Group Consulting Firm,
in hopes of affecting a financial turn

around.
According to Dr. Eugene Bauer,
dean of the School of Medicine, the
1997 merger between the two institu
tions was initially created to increase
clinical integration and cost-reduc
tion plans for the four teaching hospi
tals: Stanford Hospital, Lucile
Packard's Children's Hospital, Uni
versity of California at San Francisco
and Mount Zion.
The joint venture began with a
promising start by amassing a small
profit by the end of its first year. Soon,
however, deficits began to rise. In the
past year angered union workers and
employees have charged the hospitals
with "unnecessary spending" as the
cause for the increasing debts.
Bauer announced that operating
losses occurred in response to in
creased expenses for drugs, supplies
and labor, as well as the diminishing
payments received by Medicare,
MediCal and HMOs, which affected
UCSF-Stanford Health Care, a non

profit private sector.
Despite the explanations, state
Sen. Jacqueline Speier (D-San
Mateo) and Assemblywoman Carole
Migden (D-San Francisco) are calling
for an audit of the UCSF-Stanford
records, which will be made public at
a hearing on Aug. 13.
Specific concerns have been di
rected at Mount Zion Hospital, which
reportedly is responsible for approxi
mately $50 million of the total pro
jected $60-million loss. UCSF-Stan
ford's administration initially re
sponded to the deficits by laying off
2,(XX) positions between UCSF and
Stanford and has even suggested clos
ing the Mount Zion Hospital alto
gether, according to Bauer.
However, multiple community
and political organizations have tried
to preserve what they believe to be a
significant hospital which treats a vast
majority of inner-city patients unable
to afford health care. The hospital
also serves as an important academic

tool in training residents and conduct
ing research.
Following months ot repeated
concerns, Atkinson and Casper sub
mitted their letter to the hospital's
Board of Directors. Faced with these
various political and financial de
mands, Van Etten and Kerr an
nounced their resignations.
"Peter and Bill wanted to facilitate
any organizational changes resulting
from the study requested last week,"
UCSF-Stanford Board of the Direc
tors Chairman Isaac Stein stated fol
lowing the announcement.
The same announcement that also
designated Hunter as the interim
manager has conjured up reactions
among the UCSF-Stanford faculty
and staff.
"It's difficult to accept that two,
world-cited academic institutions
have to turn again to an outside con
sultant to correct their administrative
deficiencies." stated Dr. Karl Blume,
chair of the Bone Marrow Trans

plants Department at Stanford Hos
pital.
In a press release, Mary Garcia,
lead materials assistant in the Supply


Peter Van Etten
Distribution Department at Stanford
Hospital, also expressed concern with
the decision to bring Hunter in as the
interim manager.
"How could the [board] abdicate
their responsibilities to their patients
to an outside consulting firm?" she
said in a press release. "1 can't believe
that among all the managers at
UCSF, Stanford and Lucile Packard
hospitals, there is not a single health
care professional that can run this
Health System for a few weeks. This
is the height of irresponsibility."
The Hunter consulting fees have
neared $3 million, raising anxieties of
exacerbating the financial drought.
However, hospital spokesman Mike
Lassiter re-affirmed Stein's state
ment by addressing the need for
"continuity of management," which
is served by the Hunter Group, a firm
that has been working closely with
UCSF-Stanford since last year and is
familiar with its structure.

Bauer also added in his recent
UCSF-Stanford Status Report that
Hunter intended to use operational
leadership under Malinda Mitchell,
chief operating officer for Stanford
Hospital, and not "fuss with what's
working well but focus as much atten
tion to the $170-million cost-reduc
tion project."
In addition, Bauer assured faculty
and staff that Hunter intended to
meet with him on a weekly basis and
may even meet regularly with acade
mics as well.
Now, as UCSF-Stanford wavers in
a stage that Bauer labeled as a "peri
od of inevitable uncertainty," the ad
ministration, along with Hunter, is
faced with pending decisions.
By the end of this week, various
parameters will be established by the
board to state the goals for the insti
tutions and how to preserve them.
The board may decide as early as next
week whether to discontinue some of
Mount Zion's services. The decision
of whether or not to keep Mount
Zion altogether may be made at an
Aug. 27 board meeting.
