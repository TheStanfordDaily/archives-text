# Coffee House undergoes change
## 
### Jill Singer 
Anyone who has walked by the
Coffee House recently would have
noticed that instead of being filled
with students and music, it is eerily
empty. This situation reflects the fact
that the Coffee House is still awaiting
reconstruction for major renova
tions.

Although Bon Appetit, the com
pany that runs the Coffee Hoase,
plans on re-opening the place before
the arrival of freshmen this fall, con
struction was delayed due to prob
lems in obtaining a permit. However,
this month. Bon Appetit has re
ceived permission from the Universi
ty to start construction, set to begin
today.

The process to obtain permits
began in January but encountered
setbacks.
"The permits [were] all but signed
except for one minor problem," ex
plained Matthew Almeida, manager
of Bon Appetit. "The county and the
University still need[ed] to decide to

what extent the Coffee House will be
fire-protected." In the end, he said,
the delay [was] "for the benefit of
both the University and the county."
However, "nobody in their wildest
dreams imagined that it would take
this long to get a building permit,"
said Charles Turner, interim manager
of Bon Appetit.
Almeida added, "In California,
the entire construction industry is
backlogged two-and-a-half months,"
he said, citing "a boom economy" and
"so much business to be done, not
enough people to do it" as the causes
for the delay.
Even with all the delays, the re
opening date is scheduled for Sept. 20.
When asked if this is a reasonable
goal. Almeida said yes.
"I have great faith in our general
contractor," he said.
A new Coffee House
Certain changes are in store for the
interior design of the Coffee House.
"The space has been entirely gut
ted and plans are in the works to redo
the area where the food is prepared
and served," said Leonie Batkin. who
oversees operations at the Stanford
Management Company.

The purpose of the renovation, she
said, is to rearrange the way service is
done, to increase the efficiency and to
quicken the flow of traffic.
Turner envisions "bringing the
CoHo out of the '60s and 70s and into
the new century."
He said that multiple reasons exist
for the renovation of the Coffee
House, but that for the most part, it
was a decision of necessity. The initial
Coffee House was built simply as a
coffee hangout, and over the years, it
has evolved into much more for Stan
ford students. Turner said the old fa
cilities were unable to keep up with
these changes.
"We are limited to the same basic
style," said Turner. "The breakdown
of server space versus customer space
will stay the same; the floor plan won't
change. The raised platforms weren't
leveled and the murals are intact.
"We've ordered new standard
[high-backed] chairs mainly because
the old ones were dangerous and
falling apart," said Turner. The ta
bles will remain, as will the old sofas
and chairs. The kitchen equipment is
being replaced by stainless steel facil
ities, including a large wood table that
used to take up the entire space where
food was prepared. The new design
and the modern equipment will be
easier to keep clean.
The raised platform that faces the

back patio will feature bar counters
with laptop outlets, said Turner. Ac
cording to Turner, the old round ta
bles were an inefficient use of such an
unusual space, and he anticipates that
the bar counters will make the Coffee
House more user-friendly for stu
dents who are put off by the silence of
Green Library or by the sterility of the
Corner Pocket.
Turner described the new lighting
scheme as "not as funky. We are not
looking to make it a sterile environ
ment, but it will change to some ex
tent."
This includes new carpeting and
flooring, too.
The most important task renova
tors face is making the layout of the
Coffee House more efficient in order
to decrease congestion near the
counter. Though most customers
enter through the side facing Dinkel
spiel Auditorium, the main cash regis
ter was located on the side facing the
back patio of Tresidder, Turner ex
plained, creating a backward flow of
traffic.
"The cash register is now the first
thing [students will] meet," said Turn
er, when they come in from the en
trance by Dinkelspiel.
Student concerns
Like most things abbreviated at
Stanford, the term CoHo does not

just stand for the Coffee House — it
represents Stanford traditions. Since
the Coffee House's inception a little
less than 30 years ago, it has served as
a nightly student hangout, a provider
of caffeine fixes, a lively study spot
and an occasional concert venue.
So in June, when a small sign ap
peared on the door of the Coffee
House announcing that it was closed
for renovations until the new school
year, some students were not happy.
"I was looking forward to finally
being able to hang out at the CoHo
without having midterms and papers
looming over my head," said junior
James Sung. "I was pretty bummed
when I heard it would be closed.
There's not much to do on campus,
especially during the summer."
Other students were concerned
about another change — the Coffee
House will begin serving Starbuck's
coffee in the fall.
"This makes me worry that the
University has gone into cahoots with
yet another commercial giant," said
senior Hannah Goldie. "I'm sure
there's something beneficial coming
out of this deal, but I can't think of
what it might be."
Junior Shauna Taradash voiced
similar concerns.
" I'd like to know why they chose to
change," she said, 'it does worry me
that Starbucks has such a monopoly

on the Stanford campus. Not only do
we have two Starbucks on the out
skirts of campus, [but] some dining
halls are serving it too."
Students also worried that the Cof
fee House would be converted into a
typical Starbucks, complete with
modular furniture and bright lighting.
"The CoHo had a great atmos
phere that made it what it was." said
Goldie. "Now I'm scared that it's
going to become another carbon
copy Starbucks."
Turner hoped to dispel some of the
myths that have arisen. He said that
while Java City coffee is being com
pletely replaced by the Starbucks
brand, Bon Appetit will still own the
Coffee House.
The Baker Street Cafe in Tresid
der Union will continue serving Java
City coffee and become a licensed
Java City outfit. Turner anticipates a
higher quality of coffee from both lo
cations as a result.
Of the overall changes to the Cof
fee House, students seem the most
concerned that the Coffee House re
open as scheduled.
"I think it is very important that
the Coffee House be open when the
new frosh get here," said sophomore
Thomas Stripling. "When 1 first got
here, it was really the only place we
knew of that we could go and hang
out besides the dorm."
