The University has expanded the
summer quarter session, offering new
courses this summer and also plan
ning additional programs for next
summer.
"Wc are constantly looking for
ways to academically enhance the
campus during the summer quarter,"
said Roberta Bassett, assistant dean
of summer session. "Summer is be
coming an increasingly important
academic quarter as students look to
pack in as much as they can to their
academic experience."
There are approximately 1,350
Stanford students enrolled this sum
mer, and over 4(X) people in the Sum
mer Visitors Program, which offers
open enrollment to students from
other universities and graduate
schools.
"This year's overall summer en
rollment ... is up by about 13 percent
from last summer," Bassett said.
The summer session also
launched two new study-abroad pro
grams this year.
"Both these courses allow faculty
to bring their passions and interests to
their classes on-site and in an envi
ronment that gives hands-on learning
to the students," Bassett said.
In Classics 126: Alpine Archaeol
ogy in the Swiss and Italian Alps, stu

dents do not just learn about archae
ology from a textbook. Classics lec
turer Patrick Hunt actually leads the
12 students in the class on an excava
tion of Roman ruins and roads. The
trip takes place from Aug. 7-21.
The other new study-abroad pro
gram is aboard a yacht, sailing off the
coast of Turkey. English Prof. David
Vann teaches English 90A: Creative
Writing in the Mediterranean from
July 25 to Aug. 6. The class was in
tended to be a seminar, with students
reading and writing short stories
while visiting ruins in Turkey. How
ever, since only one student enrolled
this year, it was taught as an indepen
dent-study course instead.
Bassett noted that there was much
more initial interest in the class than
the enrollment indicates. However,
she speculated that the political insta
bility in Turkey decreased the num
ber of students who actually decided
to take the class.
Prior to the introduction of these
two new programs, the only study
abroad program Stanford offered
during the summer was in China. In
the Stanford University-Peking Uni
versity Program, students spend five
weeks at Stanford and in China.
In addition to the study-abroad
programs, on-campus classes are also
