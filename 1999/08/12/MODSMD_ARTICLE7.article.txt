# Summer session offers new programs, classes

The University has expanded the
summer quarter session, offering new
courses this summer and also plan
ning additional programs for next
summer.
"Wc are constantly looking for
ways to academically enhance the
campus during the summer quarter,"
said Roberta Bassett, assistant dean
of summer session. "Summer is be
coming an increasingly important
academic quarter as students look to
pack in as much as they can to their
academic experience."
There are approximately 1,350
Stanford students enrolled this sum
mer, and over 4(X) people in the Sum
mer Visitors Program, which offers
open enrollment to students from
other universities and graduate
schools.
"This year's overall summer en
rollment ... is up by about 13 percent
from last summer," Bassett said.
The summer session also
launched two new study-abroad pro
grams this year.
"Both these courses allow faculty
to bring their passions and interests to
their classes on-site and in an envi
ronment that gives hands-on learning
to the students," Bassett said.
In Classics 126: Alpine Archaeol
ogy in the Swiss and Italian Alps, stu

dents do not just learn about archae
ology from a textbook. Classics lec
turer Patrick Hunt actually leads the
12 students in the class on an excava
tion of Roman ruins and roads. The
trip takes place from Aug. 7-21.
The other new study-abroad pro
gram is aboard a yacht, sailing off the
coast of Turkey. English Prof. David
Vann teaches English 90A: Creative
Writing in the Mediterranean from
July 25 to Aug. 6. The class was in
tended to be a seminar, with students
reading and writing short stories
while visiting ruins in Turkey. How
ever, since only one student enrolled
this year, it was taught as an indepen
dent-study course instead.
Bassett noted that there was much
more initial interest in the class than
the enrollment indicates. However,
she speculated that the political insta
bility in Turkey decreased the num
ber of students who actually decided
to take the class.
Prior to the introduction of these
two new programs, the only study
abroad program Stanford offered
during the summer was in China. In
the Stanford University-Peking Uni
versity Program, students spend five
weeks at Stanford and in China.
In addition to the study-abroad
programs, on-campus classes are also
being added. Professors who want to
teach new classes next summer will
submit course proposals by autumn
quarter.
"We would like Stanford faculty to
be aware of the opportunity they have
in the summer quarter to try out new
courses or to offer something they
know would be popular with stu
dents," Bassett said.
"We see summer as a time for fac
ulty innovation and experimentation,
as well as a time for students to devel
op their majors or minors, fulfill a re
quirement or retake a course," she
added.
Junior Beth Robionowitz, who en
rolled in summer session because she
"did not feel like taking a break from
academic learning," likes the smaller
class sizes during the summer.
"It's great to have a class of 20 to 30
students, as opposed to 3(X) during the
other quarters," Robionowitz said.

This summer has also seen an ex
pansion in the Summer College, a
program designed for high school stu
dents. This year, 275 students are in
Summer College, compared to the
250 last year. Students take classes
with undergraduates and commute or
live in Roble Hall.
Tina Gridiron, Program Director
for the Summer College, said, "The
only thing that is different about the
program for me since I participated in
1995 is that we are in a new building,
Roble, instead of Branner Hall, and
we have more staff and more students
than we did in 1995. Over the past
four years, the program has grown
tremendously."
High school juniors and seniors
apply to Summer College by submit
ting an essay, transcript, resume and
two letters of recommendation.
About half of the students who apply
are admitted each year.
"The [high school] students take
the same classes as all other college
students," Gridiron said. "However,
there are a few courses that are creat-

Ed by departments with the high
school students in mind."
New programs for both high
school and undergraduate students
are already being planned for next
summer. They will be institutes,
which are intensive three- to four
week programs.
A summer drama institute, direct
ed by Drama Assoc. Prof. Rush
Rehm, will be open to undergraduate
and high school students.
In addition. Political Science
Assoc. Prof. Rob Reich is developing
a summer philosophy institute for
high school students.
These institutes exemplify a de
parture from the 10-week courses
Stanford traditionally offers. Bassett
wants to increase the variety of class
formats students can choose.
"I hope we see not only more
courses, but different structures of of
ferings for students — shorter term
workshops and institutes, study
abroad options, domestic off-campus
courses and evening courses," Bassett
said.
