Editor's Note: This is the second
article in a series covering the
progress of recent startups by Stan
ford students.
Online commerce is a common
place occurrence these days â€”
books, clothes, CDs and even gro
ceries are all available over the Inter
net.
However, electronic retailing
wasn't always such an accepted no
tion. Five years ago, three Stanford
undergraduates came up with the
idea of selling sporting goods online.
As they explored the industry, how
ever, they soon realized that the
world wasn't quite ready for their
idea.

"You have to remember, the In
ternet was still pretty new four years
ago," said Robert Chea, one of the
Stanford entrepreneurs. "There
wasn't much support at that time for
selling things online. The technology
wasn't as sophisticated, and the pub
lic just wasn't ready to buy things
over the computer."
Instead, Chea, Brett Allsop and
Andrew Chen, who all graduated in
1993, decided to start the Web devel
opment company, CedroGroup,
named after the Stanford undergrad
uate dorm, Cedro, where they met.
CedroGroup's primary focus was to
build websites for sporting goods
manufacturers. After a few years,
CedroGroup had designed websites
for more than 1(X) sporting-goods
manufacturers and trade associa

tions.
"But we knew that there were
major opportunities in the industry,"
said co-founder Chen, "and we kept
pushing the e-commerce idea."
Since some clients were inexperi
enced with the Web, CedroGroup
published an e-commerce newsletter
every other month. It contained in
formation on the analysis and use of
web traffic statistics (such as hits and
visitors), usability information and
trends in the field.
"We used this as a tool to migrate
the industry towards e-commerce,"
said Chen.
Eventually the three decided that
the market was ready fore-com
merce, and they transformed Ce-

droGroup into an e-commerce site
for sporting goods. They launched
Sportsite.com in June of 1998,
changing the name to Fogdog Sports
in November of that year.
"The dictionary defines 'fogdog'
as the ray of light sometimes seen
burning through fog," Chief Execu
tive Officer Tim Harrington said in a
press release announcing the name
change. "At Fogdog Sports, it means
we promise to guide you through the
vast world of sporting goods to find
the right product to match your per
formance needs."
As one of the first online sporting
goods stores, Fogdog Sports has in
fluenced the way sporting-goods
manufacturers sell their goods on
line.
"I like to believe that we were the
ones to push the sporting goods in
dustry to e-commerce," said Chen.
Earlier this year, Fogdog pub
lished a set of e-commerce certifica

tion standards to help sporting
goods manufacturers evaluate the
websites selling their products.
Fogdog Sports wanted to help
brands avoid "fly-by-night compa
nies that may not be there in a few
months," said Chen. Traditional
commerce manufacturers choose re
tailers to sell their products based on
criteria such as store location and
size to ensure that their brands are
being sold by the best retailers.
E-commerce manufacturers still
need to make sure that the e-retail
ers they deal with are trustworthy
and follow certain standards.
The certification standards sup
ported by Fogdog Sports provides a
set of guidelines for manufactures to
follow when they consider partner
ships with e-retailers, including stan
dards for site quality, site security,
customer service and marketing.
The Sporting Goods Manufactur
ers Association has agreed to work
with Fogdog to develop these e-com
merce criteria for the entire industry.
Along with their role in e-com
merce, Fogdog Sports has decided to

jump into the international arena.
Allsop has gone to London to set up
Fogdog International.
"The foreign enterprise is still
nascent," said Chea, "but it has been
easier in a way because the foreign
companies already know our U.S.
brand name."
Although they have come a long
way from their Stanford undergrad
uate days, these Stanford entrepre
neurs still maintain ties to the Uni
versity, as they work with master's
and undergraduate students in In
dustrial Engineering. Fogdog has
also worked with Stanford Consult
ing, a student-run organization that
works with both local and interna
tional companies to develop market
ing and management strategies.
Chea credits the success of their
venture, at least in part, to their start
in the Stanford community.
"The technology that we were ex
posed to definitely shaped the way
we thought about things. The idea
that we could be creative and didn't
have to follow a normal job was part
of the culture."
