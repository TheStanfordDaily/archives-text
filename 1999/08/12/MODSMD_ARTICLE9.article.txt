# Researchers find gene that causes narcolepsy
## 
### Anh Bui Contributing writer 
A Stanford research team led by
Psychology Assoc. Prof. Emmanuel
Mignot has recently discovered a ge
netic basis for narcolepsy, a sleeping
disorder that causes extreme daytime
sleepiness or even unexpected physi
cal collapse from sudden muscle
weakness.
This finding can lead not only to
treatments for sleep disorders, in
cluding narcolepsy and insomnia, but
also can provide insight into the mol
ecular basis of how and why people
go to sleep.
In the Aug. 6 issue of the science
journal Cell, Mignot and his col
leagues explained how they traced
narcolepsy to defects in the hypocre
tin receptor 2 gene, which encodes
for a specific receptor located on the
surface of neurons in the hypothala
mus.
Receptors are essentially anten
nae that allow a cell to receive signals
from its environment. With a defec
tive receptor, such messages would
not be recognized. In this case, the
hvpocretin receptor 2 binds to pep
tides known as hypocretins or orex
ins, molecules that have been found
to control eating behavior and are
now implicated in promoting wake
fulness as well.
Mignot and his research team
spent 10 years working with Dober
man pinschers and Labrador retriev
ers in order to pinpoint the location of
the narcolepsy gene. Mignot said his
first reaction to the discovery was
sheer relief.
"It was such a long research
process," said Mignot. "Now. the
search is finally over."
Identification of the gene was ac
complished using positional cloning,
a technique that involves following
chromosome segments through suc
cessive generations of animals and
seeing which part of the chromosome
was passed down to narcoleptics. Be
cause only the physical location of the
gene was being tracked, researchers
did not need to know exactly what
they were looking for.
"For example, say I wanted to find
you." explained Mignot. "First, I
would find out that you were in the
U.S. Then I would discover you were
in California, then the Bay Area, and
then Palo Alto.
"Continuing on. I would discover
what street you lived on, and then
what house and what specific room

you were in. I'd find you without hav
ing a clue about who you were or
what you looked like."
Dogs are one of the few species
besides humans known to develop
narcolepsy, a disease which affects
roughly 135,000 Americans. Howev
er, Dobermans and Labradors are
special in that their type of narcolep
sy can be caused by a defect in a single
gene.
According to Mignot, narcolepsy
in humans is much more complicated,
since it is triggered not only by sever
al genes, each of which only partly
contributes to a person's susceptibili
ty to the disorder, but also by envi
ronmental conditions. Narcolepsy
behaves more like heart disease or di
abetes than the clear-cut autosomal
recessive disorder it is in dogs.
Mignot noted that most human
narcoleptics will not have an actual
defect in the hypocretin receptor it
self. "But there's no reason not to be
lieve that some of them would."
added Mignot.
The fact that the receptors them
selves might not be damaged opens
up the possibility of using drugs that
increase the concentration of
hvpocretins in the brain to treat nar
colepsy. Or. one could develop sleep
ing pills that work by blocking the re
ceptors.
"I am sure that hvpocretins are in
volved [in humans]," said Mignot.
"How they do so. I don't know yet.
But this study helps us understand
this disease a little more."
The role of hvpocretins is corrob
orated by a completely independent
study conducted on mice by Dr.
Masashi Yanagisawa of the Universi
ty of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center. Yanagisawa was actually
looking at the role of hvpocretins in
feeding behavior, but noticed that
mice, which had a disrupted gene for
hypocretin production, would often
fall over motionless while exercising
or feeding. These animals had devel
oped narcolepsy. Yanagisawa's study
will appear in Cell on Aug. 20.
"These two findings are differ
ent," explained Mignot. "because
they found the peptide, and we found
the receptor for the peptide. We
helped each other by supporting each
others' conclusions."
Now. Mignot and his team plan to
search through blood samples donat
ed by humans in an effort to find the
human version of hypocretin recep
tor 2. "My goal is to help people with
narcolepsy," said Mignot.
