## Women's volleyball primes for Christmas in Hawaii 
### Emil Dizon Contributing writer 
In any given season, the phrase.
'Stanford women's volleyball," has
symbolized the very best in women's
:ollegiate volleyball. Although last
year's finish in the NCAA regional
semifinal did not demonstrate the
Cardinal's reputation as one of the
oest teams in the nation, this year's
squad sets out to return Stanford to
come December, at the NCAA
Championships in Hawaii.
With five returning starters, the
Cardinal have their sights set on the
school's fifth NCAA title. In the
A VCA-US A Today Top 25 Coaches'
Poll, the Cardinal received the #2
ranking, just behind Penn State, last
year's NCAA runner-up. The Cardi
nal is also ranked first in the Pacific-10
Conference preseason coaches' poll
with 89 out of a possible 90 points, six
points ahead of UCLA.
Stanford comes into the 1999 sea
son with a host of emerging, talented
players in addition to seasoned veter
ans. Although losing many key play
ers from the 1997 team, last year's
squad gained valuable experience in
amassing a 27-4 record and winning
the school's fifth straight conference
title.
Preseason planning
Now back on campus for presea
son workouts, head coach Don Shaw
said his practice sessions currently ori
ent the freshmen and get the veterans
re-acquainted with the team's game.
He said his team will practice with
freshmen Logan Tom and Ashley Ivy
until Aug. 23, when the two join the
U.S. Junior National Team. The two
will not return to the Cardinal squad
until after the team's games against
Houston and Texas.
"It's hard," said Tom. "It's like I
just got here, and then I'm getting
shipped out."
"We've got to cover a lot of mate
rial early," said Shaw. "These fresh
men do a good job playing hard and
:ommunicating."
Shaw also said the players on the
earn who have dealt with injuries
Juring the past year have progressed
►veil. He expects Robyn Lewis to re
oin the team in September and said
that Lindsey Yamasaki is progressing
slowly, but well, following leg prob
ems. He added that Kerri Walsh's
shoulder has been holding well in
these opening days of practice,
though she is not letting loose on it
yet.

Hitters and blockers
Stanford's net play, according to
Shaw, has been one of its greatest
strengths with its strong hitting and
blocking. The outside hitting position
contains some of Stanford's most ex
perienced players. Three-time
AVCA All-American Walsh's career
on the Farm began in a flurry' in 19%,
when she was named most outstand
ing player of the NCAA tournament.
Coming into her senior season, Walsh
returns as the 1998 Pac-1() player of
the year, ranking second in the con
ference in hitting percentage (.379)
and digs (3.3 per game).
She ranked eighth in the Pac-10 in
kills (3.85 per game) and ranks third
in Stanford history in single-season
kills and single-season hitting per
centage. Her statistics hardly show
that she battled a shoulder injury
most of last season.
"It's amazing to think she's been a
three-time, first team All-American
and hasn't been healthy 1 (X) percent,"
said Shaw. "I would love to see her
show everybody what she's capable of
doing without any pain."
However the other outside hitting
spots could go to a variety of players.
Shaw said he hopes that senior Sarah
Clark, who started all 31 matches last
season, will contribute effectively to
the team this season.
"Hopefully, she's going to be more
consistent this year and as a senior, re
ally give us solid play at her position,"
said Shaw.
Jaimi Gregory rounds out this
year's senior class. An outside hitter
who dealt with leg injuries through
out last year, Gregory returns to this
year's squad as one of its veterans.
"The seniors want to go out and
make this their best year and lead the
team to as good a season as it can
have," said Shaw. "Jaimi's going to do
a lot in terms of leadership and expe
rience to make that happen."
In addition to the three seniors,
Stanford also holds four other outside
hitters, all capable of contributing to
the Cardinal's run at the national
championship.
Returning for her sophomore sea
son is Michelle Chambers, who was
an All-Pac-1() freshman selection,
who started for the Cardinal at the be
ginning of conference play. Cham
bers tallied 270 kills, 208 digs and 67
blocks last season.
"What she did day in and day out.
both effort and performance-wise,
was a pleasant surprise." said Shaw.
"She earned a starting spot because ol
her consistency. She's going to be
tough to move out of there."

Three newcomers round out Stan
ford's outside hitting arsenal. Red
shirt freshman Yamasaki comes to
the team after leading the women's
basketball team in scoring and re
bounding.
"We're planning on having her at
some point, but we don't know
when," said Shaw. "She's an out
standing outside hitter and has great
ball-control."
In addition to Yamasaki. Stanford
adds two prized freshmen to its col
lection of hitters. Tom. who received
Gatorade National High School Play
er of the Year honors, is the third na
tional player of the year to join the
Cardinal in the past four years. She
has significant national team experi
ence, playing on the World Champi
onship qualifying team last winter
and on the U.S. Junior National team
in 1996, where she led the team in
blocks and kills.
"I think that she's going to give us
another serious threat out there," said
Shaw. "It's because she has great ball
control skills and is so versatile — she
has everything it takes to be a great
volleyball player."
Ivy, Stanford's other freshman,
comes to the team after being named
the 1998 Dallas area player of the
year. She played alongside Yamasaki
and Tom on the U.S. Junior National
Team.
"Being left-handed is a major
bonus for Ashley, because we haven't
had many lefties in our program over
the years," said Shaw. "She will learn
a lot playing behind and against Kerri
and has a bright future in our pro
gram."
Stanford's hitting line put up big
numbers last season, ranking first in
the conference in hitting percentage
(.292) and seventh in the nation
(.295). The team was also second in
the conference in kills (16.89 per
game) and 16th nationally (17.04 per
game).
Junior Jenn Detmer returns to
lead a solid middle blocker rotation.
A member of the all Pac-10 team last
season, Detmer ranked fourth in the
conference in hitting percentage
(.367) and blocks per game (1.5). '
"Jen had a great season, as evi
denced by her all-conference selec
tion." said Shaw. "Yet she's still just
scratching the surface of becoming an
elite-level player. She can affect a
game or a match single-handedly with
her abilities at the net."
"I just have to help the team in
every aspect." said Detmer. "Not to
just have the best numbers."
Sophomores Sarah Sandrik and
I ara Conrad will also contribute to

the middle blocker position. Stanford
was first in the conference and fourth
in the nation in blocks during last
year's regular season.
Setters and defensive specialists
Stanford's powerful hitting line
will need quality play from the back
court if the Cardinal is to prevail
against teams that hit just as well. At
the setter position, two juniors, Lewis
and Lindsay Kagawa, will vie for the
starting job.
Lewis, last year's starter, has had to
deal with a foot injury and surgery
that kept her out of spring practice.
Last season, she recorded her 1 ,CXX)th
career assist and ranked eighth in the
conference in assists (12.15 per
game). Kagawa, who filled in for
Lewis, showed strong efforts in spring
practice last year, according to Shaw.

"She's really worked on her block
ing skills so she can be a better front
court player for us. She's going to be
pushing hard to be the starting set
ter," he said.
Adding to Stanford's backcourt
will be Emily Lawrence, who takes
over at defensive specialist after
Sarah Neal's graduation last year.
A test every step of the way
Stanford's high ranking in the polls
will receive challenges every step of
the way this season. In addition to
playing in a Pac-1() Conference with
four ranked teams, Stanford has four
non-conference matches against top
15 teams, including #13 Texas, #7
BYU, #4 Hawaii and #6 Pacific.
"I think every game is going to be
a test," said Detmer. "We're going to
have to get better every game and
peak in December."
