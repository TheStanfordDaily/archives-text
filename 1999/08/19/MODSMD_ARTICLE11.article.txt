## EI Nino rains on Tiger's PGA Championship victory 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
Tiger Woods walked away with
the trophy, the world number one
ranking and a giant cardboard
check for $630,000. But it was
Spain's Sergio Garcia who left the
PGA Championship with the glory,
the hearts of the fans and what
should be the springboard to a stel
lar golf career.
The 19-year-old Spanish phe
nom put up quite a fight in his first
ever PGA Championship, falling
one stroke short of former Stanford
golfer Woods, who captured his
second career major and fourth vic
tory of the year.
At the start of the back nine Sun
day, it looked like Woods would
overpower the Medinah Country
Club Course and cruise to his first
major win since he lapped the field
at the 1997 Masters tournament.
Tiger stood at 15-under par after
dropping a birdie putt on number
11 and held a four-stroke lead over
Garcia.
That's when the excitement
began. Garcia rifled his tee shot on
the 219-yard, par-three 13th to
within fifteen feet. With Woods
looking on from the teebox, Garcia
drained the birdie putt and pumped
his fist in excitement, staring right
at Tiger, who had just made his first
bogey of the day, three putting
from 60 feet on number 12.
Tiger, who claims he didn't no
tice the mano y mano gauntlet that
Garcia threw down with the stare,

proceeded to fire his six iron tee
shot over the green and make dou
ble bogey.
Woods' seemingly insurmount
able lead was now down to just one
shot. Both players seemed to calm
down and regain their composure,
but Garcia made a critical mistake,
bogeying the par-four fifteenth
hole after hitting his drive into a
group of Medinah's over 4,000
trees.
As Garcia played the 16th hole,
one group ahead of Woods, the
drama and intensity again reached
a crescendo. After his drive found
the rough against the base of a tree,
Garcia pulled off a Merlin-like es
cape.
The easy play was a chipout to
the fairway, but not for a player

whose personal slogan is "suerte o
muerte," Spanish for 'luck or
death.' .
Lashing out of the rough eyes
closed with a six-iron, Garcia went
galloping across the fairway to see
his ball land on the green, setting up
a two putt par and a crucial save.
Despite the heroics, Garcia was
unable to pare Tiger's one stroke
advantage and Woods parred in,
two putting the 18th to finish at 11 -
under par and claim the champi
onship.
"Almost," Garcia said after the
round. "I can only tell you it was the
best week of my life. I've never had
so much fun playing golf."
Garcia's play draws the in
evitable speculation of a coming ri
valry with Woods â€” the game's
most recognized young player,
challenged by a superbly talented
teenager who has already made a
name for himself in some of golf's
biggest events.
As Garcia said, "I said when 1
turned pro that I wanted to be the
No. 1 golfer in the world. So, I knew
I would be a rival for Tiger."
Woods definitely felt the heat
from Sergio, dubbed El Nino by the
Spanish press.
"I couldn't come into the club
house the way I wanted to," Woods
said. "Sergio was playing well. He
has a tremendous amount of fight.
You can see by the way he plays,
just the way he walks around the
golf course."
The two will get a chance to meet
again at next month's Ryder Cup

matches at the Country Club in
Brookline, Mass., as Woods leads
an American squad against the Eu
ropean team which will almost
surely feature Garcia.
While Woods and Garcia capti
vated the crowds with their play,
Americans Jay Haas and Stewart
Cink finished tied for third at 280,
eight-under par, three strokes be
hind Woods.
Canadian Mike Weir, an un
known professional who played

brilliantly for the first three days of
the event and entered the final day
tied with Woods, struggled to a
final-round 80 and finished eight
strokes back.
One day after the event, Ameri
can captain Ben Crenshaw an
nounced his two captain's selec
tions to the Ryder Cup Team. Vet
erans Tom Lehman and Steve Pate
were added to the roster of 10 play
ers who qualified for the team over
the past two seasons of play.
