The Cardinal women's soccer team has been
ranked among the top teams in the country in
preseason polls.
Soccer America placed the Cardinal highest
at No. 13 in the nation, while the team was
ranked No. 21 and No. 18, respectively, by the
National Soccer Coaches Association of Amer
ica and Soccerbuzz.
Stanford is coming off a 11-7-2 season in
which they lost to Brigham Young in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament last fall. After
starting the season 6-2-1, the team went on to
open Pacific-10 Conference play with a 1-4
record before recovering late in the season to
finish 5-4 in the Conference.
The strong finish propelled Stanford into the
NCAA's for the eighth time this decade, which
revealed the desire and the ability of a young
Cardinal team to overcome early obstacles.
Last season's standout Tracye Lawyer has

been lost to graduation. However expectations
for the 1999 season are high, as the squad adds
an impressive recruiting class of six freshmen.
Joining the returning 16 players on the 1999
team are Allyson Marquand (Irvine, CA),
Becky Myers (St. Charles, IL), Marcia Wallis
(Los Gatos, CA), Kelsey Carlson (Citrus
Heights, CA), Callie Withers (Los Altos Hills,
CA) and Katherine Harrington (Fort Worth,
TX).
Marquand, Myers, and Wallis played for the
United States Under-18 Women's National
Team.
Adding to the youthful mix of players will be
returning sophomores Martha West, Amy
Sauer and Erin Maurer. Maurer started at for
ward for the Cardinal last year and finished third
on the team in scoring with five goals and three
assists.
With half the team in either their freshman or
sophomore seasons, Stanford already has the
foundation to be a dominant team for the next
three years. This has been re-enforced by many

soccer publications, which have ranked Stan
ford's recruiting class for 1999 among the top
five in the entire nation.
"[The freshmen recruits] are extremely hard
workers, have tremendously competitive atti
tudes and are positive players, always putting
the team first," said head coach Steve Swanson.
"I have always maintained that with good
people you can accomplish great things. When
you add [the recruits] to the core of returning
players, you can't help but be excited about the
future of our program."
In the past spring season the team faced stiff
competition from college powerhouses Santa
Clara and Portland, rival UC-Berkeley and
World Cup teams from Japan and Mexico.
This difficult series of matches did include an
inspiring 3-2 victory by Stanford over Mexico.
Swanson used these opportunities to place play
ers in different positions, providing his team
with difficult challenges.
The regular season certainly will not be a
cake-walk, as Stanford faces one of the toughest

schedules in the nation. Despite the challenging
road that lies ahead for the Cardinal, Swanson
stresses the importance of consistency in having
a successful season.
Some of the team's junior and senior players
are returning after eventful summers. Senior de
fender Ronnie Fair spent the summer playing
for the U.S. Under-21 Women's National Team.
Also returning is junior goalkeeper Carly
Smolak, who finished last season second in the
Pac-10 in goals-against average.
The returning defenders, who include
Christy Arnold, Jen O'Sullivan, Natalie Kim
and Sauer. helped limit opponents to 185 shots
last season, while the Cardinal got off 3(H of its
own. The defensive effort resulted in the Cardi
nal keeping opponents scoreless in eight match
es last year.
Stanford opens their season at home on Aug.
27 at 7:30 p.m. This game will be followed a
week later by a showdown with what Soccer
America calls the No. 1 team in the country â€”
Santa Clara.
