## A 						summer of transitions: Rice reflects upon the future's changes and challenges 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
For former University Provost
Condoleezza Rice it's been one of her
busiest summers. She's supposed to be
in the middle of a sabbatical.
Rice, currently on a one-year acad
emic leave of absence from the Uni
versity, has been spending most of her
time in her much-publicized role ad
vising Texas Gov. George W. Bush on
foreign policy issues connected with
his bid for the 2(XX) presidential race.
"It's one heck of an interesting way
to use a sabbatical," she said.
Spending much of her lime on the
road this summer. Rice has been
working with the campaign a great
deal. While she doesn't expect to work
full-time as the campaign accelerates
in the months ahead. Rice does expect
that she might need to become more
involved.
"Campaigns are very difficult to
pace." Rice said. "Candidates need to
consider carefully how speeches and
policy stances are given and kind of
play it by ear."
Following a six-year tenure as
provost. Rice was succeeded by Engi
neering Prof. John Hennessy on July 1.
Effective that same day was her ap
pointment as a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
Although she is on leave from her
professorship in the Political Science
Department. Rice plans to be on cam
pus in September to work at Hoover.
She also will continue her work in in-

dustry. serving on a number of corpo
rate hoards, including that of Chevron
Corp. and the International Advisory
Council for J.P. Morgan.

Budding relationships
Rice said that the majority of her
time thus far on the campaign has been
spent helping Bush react to foreign
policy issues. Citing Kosovo and the
most recent issues in Taiwan as exam
ples, Rice said that looking at current
foreign policy has been especially im
portant so far in the campaign.
"The international scene has been
more active than expected," she said.
As new stances are solidified and
the campaign progresses. Rice said
that Bush will begin to give foreign
policy speeches. But. because of the
presidential race thus far, the timing
will be more complex.
"Bush should really be one among
many at this point in the race, but he's
not — he has a very high profile," she
said. "One needs to consider how to
best make use of support and keep the
momentum high into the election.
That can be tricky."
Rice joins a number of other Stan
ford and Hoover-affiliated personali
ties. including former Secretary of
State George Shultz and Economics
Profs. Michael Boskin and John Tay
lor.
And as for the anticipated next
step, namely any potential involve
ments should Bush be elected. Rice
said that there isn't one. at least not
yet.
"I am someone who all my life
hasn't planned the next step. 1 didn't
plan to become provost, and I didn't
plan any past governmental involve
ments that I've had. I'm going to stick
bv that." she said.

"I won't plan for something that
hasn't happened yet."
Shultz, who served as, in addition to
Secretary of State, chairman of then-

President Reagan's Economic Policy
Board, Secretary of Treasury and Sec
retary of Labor said, "I have seen
[Rice] academically, politically and so
cially to have good, strong and sensible
views."
"She has [Bush's] confidence. They
make a good partnership, and Bush
knows that," Shultz added.
"I have tremendous respect for
[Bush]. I think that he would make an
excellent president," Rice said.
"Everything is up in the air at this
point, and I don't see a point in spend
ing any time thinking about my future
role with him as yet."
A tremendous opportunity
Rice is noticeably excited about the
possibility of continuing her work at
Hoover.
"I am really looking forward to
doing things like writing and going to
seminars — all the stuff I couldn't do
when 1 was provost. It is a tremendous
opportunity." she said.
"One of the greatest things about
working here is the ability to talk with
people who have interests that are
both alike and different from yours.
That stimulates your own thinking."
While at Hoover, Rice plans to con
tinue pursuing her research interests,
which include the politics of eastern
and central Europe and the former
Soviet Union and international securi
ty policy.
She is currently working on a book
called "Turning Point." which is about
major turning points leading to the
end of the Cold War; Rice also plans to
write a number of articles.
"In some ways I'm glad that 1 was
out of politics for those years," Rice
said. "I think that there was a clean
break from that world and conse
quently, I think that I have fewer pre
conceptions from the world before
that I was trained in."
Hoover Institution Director John
Raisian said that they were "eager to
have [Ricej on any terms "
"Condi is a truly gifted person. She
brings Hoover her wealth of quality
ideas and her talent as a speaker. All in
all. it is a big win for us and for her,"
Raisian said.
"Even though she is relatively
young, she is a very experienced and
very polished individual. We're lucky
to have her." he added.
Raisian said that, to his knowledge,
Rice is the first female African Amer
ican to become a Hoover fellow, at
least in the past ten years.
Research aside. Rice views Hoover

as more of a resource than anything
else.
"I'm looking forward to sharpening
my mind and intellect... throwing
ideas around, having them challenged
... challenging other people in a set
ting where that's encouraged," she
said.
Pillars of a new order
Policy-wise, Rice wants students to
know that she is someone who has re-

alistic views about the international
system. While she wants to promote a
strong American role, she doesn't
think of herself as a "grand strategist."
"I tell my students that policy mak
ing is 90 percent blocking and tackling
and 10 percent intellectual. An awful
lot of policy making is mundane," she
said.
"The last time 1 entered the foreign
policy scene, I was fortunate that it ex
ploded. It would be foolhardy to think
that type of occurrence could happen
again."
Specifically, Rice named three im
portant considerations that she feels
should be addressed in the next centu
ry's foreign policy scheme: the rebuild
ing of the American military, a redefi
nition of the purpose of the military
and the impact of globalization.

"We are in a tremendous transition
right now from the old Cold War to
something new." Rice said. "Whatev
er the outcome, what will be important
are the power balances underneath
the policy ... strategic relations with
the other 'great' powers like Russia,
China, Europe. Japan, maybe India."
"Some are allies, others are uncer
tain. But getting these relationships
right is important."
Rice feels that military cutbacks,
have cut too deeply into the armed)

forces.
"If the military pay grades are 15
percent below that of civilians, it's no
wonder why we can recruit people in.
Sergeants on food stamps, the Air
Force cannibalizing one plan to fly an
other — change is needed," she said
But a simple increase in military
spending is, in her view, not a one-shot
deal. Questions surrounding the mili
tary's purpose, especially after the fall
of the former Soviet Union, need to be
answered.
"People are uncomfortable that the
military is really everywhere - Haiti,
Kosovo. Our military can't be just
'Dial 911 America,'" Rice said. "We
want to involve ourselves in the hu
manitarian civil war but is that really
the proper role for our military?"
And, at the same time, Rice's cor

porate experience has brought her to
see the impact of globalization, name
ly the effects of private capital on other
markets and countries.
"Countries were variously pre
pared for globalization. The U.S. was
almost perfectly prepared, and Russia
wasn't positioned so well. The world is
too dependent on private capital, but
that's the way it should be. Sometimes
capital can be Draconian and ruthless
in its choices," Rice said.
"If winners and losers in this game

are countries, it could have unstabling
effects. We need to address these is
sues now, for later," she said.
"1 like to think of this as several pil
lars of some new order that we have
time to shape, but not forever. Even
tually these things will harden and our
ability to shape them will be limited,"
she added.
"We need to prioritize and focus
our energies on what we feel is impor
tant for the future."
Provost reflections
"It seems like a long time ago, but 1
had a great time," Rice said of her six
year tenure as provost, the second
longest in Stanford's history.
"Gerhard [Casper] took a
gamble — I had never been a depart

ment chair and was young for the job
in a lot of ways. I did have experi
ences — my work in government and
industry — that were different than
others that worked well for me in
being provost," she said.
Rice highlighted her work with
Stanford Introductory Studies, revi
sions of the curriculum, inter-school
cooperation such as the Bio-X initia
tive and her interactions with students
as some of the best parts of her time in
the position.
"One of the things that I learned in
this job was that the best leaders create
the environment for good people to do
good things. That is the strength of any
positive progress or institution," she
said.
Rice's bottom-line, yet ultimately
successful, economic concerns did
raise eyebrows when she announced
plans in 1993 to slash the budget by $20
million over a three-year period.
"There were difficult aspects of the
job. We did have lo make budget
cuts — hard things like laying people
off — which was tough. But. you have
to establish priorities and your actions
have to reflect your strategic direction.
In the end. it was a necessary thing."
Rice said.
Rice's insistence on "restructuring"
and "strategic planning" coupled with
a few explosive decisions in the early
1990s often landed her in a maelstorm
of protest.
In April of 1995. the University laid
off Chicana administrator Cecilia Bur
ciaga, then-resident fellow at Casa Za
pata. Chicano students a three-day
hunger strike, making demands that
stymied the University at its highest
levels. Rice's handling of the situation
ended the stand-off but won her few
allies. One student negotiator said at
the time that "Condi closed all doors."
Rice also had further occassion to
clash with students, this time over
whether the University should ban
California table grapes. Student pro
testors hoped the University, as an in
stitution. would take a stand against
"the pesticide exposure and the poor
living conditions of California grape
workers."
As a response, the University
pledged in 1988 to have the Dean of
Students Office and University Dining
Services sponsor residence-based edu
cation and voting.Students continued
to protest, feeling the University's
stance to be insufficient.
Then, in 1995. the Offices of the
University President and Provost re
affirmed the status-quo policy. Rice
said at the time that "Stanford should

not be in the business of championing
any moral / political cause just because
one group wants it." It remains a cam
pus issue that claims a remarkable
amount of student attention.
Her time as provost was also often

recognized with issues of tenure, as
many found her policies and decisions
regarding tenure cases to be contro
versial. These were especially evident
with tenure cases surrounding former
History Asst. Prof Karen Sawislak and
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta
(who later received tenure), among
others.
When asked about tenure issues at
a senate meeting last May, Rice said
that she is "completely opposed to af
firmative action at the time of tenure
as a matter of principle. It would be a
slippery slope that we would be very
sorry to go down."
In spite of difficult times. Rice may
very well be remembered for her ded
ication to the needs of the student,
calling on each young scholar to "find
your passion and follow your heart."
In a farewell column to the commu
nity, printed in The Daily this May.
Rice wrote: "Embrace your time here.
Allow it to transform you. Stanford is
a remarkable place because of the
people here, including you. and be
cause of the bonds that unite us — a
love of learning and a love for this
great University."
A good team
Rice found working with Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper to be a
"fabulous" experience.
"We will always be the best of

friends. We were alike and un-alike in
many ways. We had the same values,
the same sense of humor and the same
sense of how you work in a relation
ship like that," she said.
"It was the most open working rela-

tionship I've ever had."
Shultz had high praise for Rice.
"Her work as provost is universally
regarded as outstanding. She did it
well," Shult/ said.
Raisian concurred.
"Condi complimented Casper's
leadership. She was a quick study of
the workings of a University," he said.
"The University is stronger — more
financially prosperous — because of
her."
Rice said that she could have con
tinued with the position hut would not
have had a career in international pol
itics to return to if she did.
"I realized somewhere along the
way that 1 didn't want to go on to a uni
versity presidency, which is what 1
thought that I wanted when 1 accepted
the job," Rice said. "The premium was
getting back to international issues
and the pull back was irresistible."
A decorated career
Rice has served on the Stanford
faculty since 1981 as a professor in the
Department of Political Science.
In addition to her numerous arti
cles and books, she has addressed au
diences in settings from the U.S. Am
bassador's Residence in Moscow to
the Commonwealth Club and the 1992
Republican National Convention.
Outside of Stanford. Rice is an ac
tive participant in industry as a mem

ber of a number of corporate boards of
directors and advisory bodies.
In the public sector. Rice served
from 1989 to 1991 during the period of
German re-unification and the final
days of the Soviet Union in the Bush
Administration on the National Secu
rity Council and as Special Assistant to
the President for National Security
Affairs.
Rice is also a Fellow of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences
and has been awarded honorary doc
torates from Morehouse College. Uni
versity of Alabama and University of
Notre Dame.
Looking ahead
Rice said that she hasn't entirely
decided on what she plans to do when
her sabbatical ends.
"1 like to take things as they come. 1
finally decided to take my sabbatical,
but I may decide to take a bit longer
from the University and work in the
private sector. It's still an option — I
haven't decided vet." she said.
In terms of politics. Rice's mind is
clear.
"1 am admiring of those who put
themselves on the line for elected pol
itics. but I'm kind of a specialist. M\
kind of policy has to be centered in
the executive branch. Since I don't
plan to run for president. Congress
may not be the best place for me."
Rice said.
"Whatever 1 decide to do. eventu
ally I will return to teaching and to
Stanford. In a short period of time — I
don't know how long— I will miss it
and will want to get back. I could never
leave altogether."
Raisian also offered his opinions on
Rice's future.
"Every few years she transitions to
something else. There's no ceiling in
sight for her." he said. "I know that she
will have every opportunity that she
wants come her way."
Shultz agreed.
"Condi is a very able person —
very bright, experienced and a foun
tain of common sense." he said.
"She has the ability to go far in any
thing she undertakes."
Outside of the office. Rice w ants to
get back to playing the piano and some
tennis and plans on attending as many
Stanford sporting events as possible.
She also looks forward to more
time with her family.
Rice said. "It's been a very demand
ing and busy six years."
"It's going to be nice not to have an
inbox for a while."

Outside of Stanford. Rice is an ac
tive participant in industry as a mem

ber of a number of corporate boards of
directors and advisory bodies.
In the public sector. Rice served
from 1989 to 1991 during the period of
German re-unification and the final
days of the Soviet Union in the Bush
Administration on the National Secu
rity Council and as Special Assistant to
the President for National Security
Affairs.
Rice is also a Fellow of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences
and has been awarded honorary doc
torates from Morehouse College. Uni
versity of Alabama and University of
Notre Dame.
Looking ahead
Rice said that she hasn't entirely
decided on what she plans to do when
her sabbatical ends.
"1 like to take things as they come. 1
finally decided to take my sabbatical,
but I may decide to take a bit longer
from the University and work in the
private sector. It's still an option — I
haven't decided vet." she said.
In terms of politics. Rice's mind is
clear.
"1 am admiring of those who put
themselves on the line for elected pol
itics. but I'm kind of a specialist. M\
kind of policy has to be centered in
the executive branch. Since I don't
plan to run for president. Congress
may not be the best place for me."
Rice said.
"Whatever 1 decide to do. eventu
ally I will return to teaching and to
Stanford. In a short period of time — I
don't know how long— I will miss it
and will want to get back. I could never
leave altogether."
Raisian also offered his opinions on
Rice's future.
"Every few years she transitions to
something else. There's no ceiling in
sight for her." he said. "I know that she
will have every opportunity that she
wants come her way."
Shultz agreed.
"Condi is a very able person —
very bright, experienced and a foun
tain of common sense." he said.
"She has the ability to go far in any
thing she undertakes."
Outside of the office. Rice w ants to
get back to playing the piano and some
tennis and plans on attending as many
Stanford sporting events as possible.
She also looks forward to more
time with her family.
Rice said. "It's been a very demand
ing and busy six years."
"It's going to be nice not to have an
inbox for a while."

Miler Lee — Daily
At a rally for graduate student housing, Rice takes the time to speak with
concerned students.
For former University Provost
Condoleezza Rice it's been one of her
busiest summers. She's supposed to be
in the middle of a sabbatical.
Rice, currently on a one-year acad
emic leave of absence from the Uni
versity, has been spending most of her
time in her much-publicized role ad
vising Texas Gov. George W. Bush on
foreign policy issues connected with
his bid for the 2(XX) presidential race.
"It's one heck of an interesting way
to use a sabbatical," she said.
Spending much of her lime on the
road this summer. Rice has been
working with the campaign a great
deal. While she doesn't expect to work
full-time as the campaign accelerates
in the months ahead. Rice does expect
that she might need to become more
involved.
"Campaigns are very difficult to
pace." Rice said. "Candidates need to
consider carefully how speeches and
policy stances are given and kind of
play it by ear."
Following a six-year tenure as
provost. Rice was succeeded by Engi
neering Prof. John Hennessy on July 1.
Effective that same day was her ap
pointment as a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
Although she is on leave from her
professorship in the Political Science
Department. Rice plans to be on cam
pus in September to work at Hoover.
She also will continue her work in in-

dustry. serving on a number of corpo
rate hoards, including that of Chevron
Corp. and the International Advisory
Council for J.P. Morgan.

Budding relationships
Rice said that the majority of her
time thus far on the campaign has been
spent helping Bush react to foreign
policy issues. Citing Kosovo and the
most recent issues in Taiwan as exam
ples, Rice said that looking at current
foreign policy has been especially im
portant so far in the campaign.
"The international scene has been
more active than expected," she said.
As new stances are solidified and
the campaign progresses. Rice said
that Bush will begin to give foreign
policy speeches. But. because of the
presidential race thus far, the timing
will be more complex.
"Bush should really be one among
many at this point in the race, but he's
not — he has a very high profile," she
said. "One needs to consider how to
best make use of support and keep the
momentum high into the election.
That can be tricky."
Rice joins a number of other Stan
ford and Hoover-affiliated personali
ties. including former Secretary of
State George Shultz and Economics
Profs. Michael Boskin and John Tay
lor.
And as for the anticipated next
step, namely any potential involve
ments should Bush be elected. Rice
said that there isn't one. at least not
yet.
"I am someone who all my life
hasn't planned the next step. 1 didn't
plan to become provost, and I didn't
plan any past governmental involve
ments that I've had. I'm going to stick
bv that." she said.

"I won't plan for something that
hasn't happened yet."
Shultz, who served as, in addition to
Secretary of State, chairman of then-

President Reagan's Economic Policy
Board, Secretary of Treasury and Sec
retary of Labor said, "I have seen
[Rice] academically, politically and so
cially to have good, strong and sensible
views."
"She has [Bush's] confidence. They
make a good partnership, and Bush
knows that," Shultz added.
"I have tremendous respect for
[Bush]. I think that he would make an
excellent president," Rice said.
"Everything is up in the air at this
point, and I don't see a point in spend
ing any time thinking about my future
role with him as yet."
A tremendous opportunity
Rice is noticeably excited about the
possibility of continuing her work at
Hoover.
"I am really looking forward to
doing things like writing and going to
seminars — all the stuff I couldn't do
when 1 was provost. It is a tremendous
opportunity." she said.
"One of the greatest things about
working here is the ability to talk with
people who have interests that are
both alike and different from yours.
That stimulates your own thinking."
While at Hoover, Rice plans to con
tinue pursuing her research interests,
which include the politics of eastern
and central Europe and the former
Soviet Union and international securi
ty policy.
She is currently working on a book
called "Turning Point." which is about
major turning points leading to the
end of the Cold War; Rice also plans to
write a number of articles.
"In some ways I'm glad that 1 was
out of politics for those years," Rice
said. "I think that there was a clean
break from that world and conse
quently, I think that I have fewer pre
conceptions from the world before
that I was trained in."
Hoover Institution Director John
Raisian said that they were "eager to
have [Ricej on any terms "
"Condi is a truly gifted person. She
brings Hoover her wealth of quality
ideas and her talent as a speaker. All in
all. it is a big win for us and for her,"
Raisian said.
"Even though she is relatively
young, she is a very experienced and
very polished individual. We're lucky
to have her." he added.
Raisian said that, to his knowledge,
Rice is the first female African Amer
ican to become a Hoover fellow, at
least in the past ten years.
Research aside. Rice views Hoover

as more of a resource than anything
else.
"I'm looking forward to sharpening
my mind and intellect... throwing
ideas around, having them challenged
... challenging other people in a set
ting where that's encouraged," she
said.
Pillars of a new order
Policy-wise, Rice wants students to
know that she is someone who has re-

alistic views about the international
system. While she wants to promote a
strong American role, she doesn't
think of herself as a "grand strategist."
"I tell my students that policy mak
ing is 90 percent blocking and tackling
and 10 percent intellectual. An awful
lot of policy making is mundane," she
said.
"The last time 1 entered the foreign
policy scene, I was fortunate that it ex
ploded. It would be foolhardy to think
that type of occurrence could happen
again."
Specifically, Rice named three im
portant considerations that she feels
should be addressed in the next centu
ry's foreign policy scheme: the rebuild
ing of the American military, a redefi
nition of the purpose of the military
and the impact of globalization.

"We are in a tremendous transition
right now from the old Cold War to
something new." Rice said. "Whatev
er the outcome, what will be important
are the power balances underneath
the policy ... strategic relations with
the other 'great' powers like Russia,
China, Europe. Japan, maybe India."
"Some are allies, others are uncer
tain. But getting these relationships
right is important."
Rice feels that military cutbacks,
have cut too deeply into the armed)

forces.
"If the military pay grades are 15
percent below that of civilians, it's no
wonder why we can recruit people in.
Sergeants on food stamps, the Air
Force cannibalizing one plan to fly an
other — change is needed," she said
But a simple increase in military
spending is, in her view, not a one-shot
deal. Questions surrounding the mili
tary's purpose, especially after the fall
of the former Soviet Union, need to be
answered.
"People are uncomfortable that the
military is really everywhere - Haiti,
Kosovo. Our military can't be just
'Dial 911 America,'" Rice said. "We
want to involve ourselves in the hu
manitarian civil war but is that really
the proper role for our military?"
And, at the same time, Rice's cor

porate experience has brought her to
see the impact of globalization, name
ly the effects of private capital on other
markets and countries.
"Countries were variously pre
pared for globalization. The U.S. was
almost perfectly prepared, and Russia
wasn't positioned so well. The world is
too dependent on private capital, but
that's the way it should be. Sometimes
capital can be Draconian and ruthless
in its choices," Rice said.
"If winners and losers in this game

are countries, it could have unstabling
effects. We need to address these is
sues now, for later," she said.
"1 like to think of this as several pil
lars of some new order that we have
time to shape, but not forever. Even
tually these things will harden and our
ability to shape them will be limited,"
she added.
"We need to prioritize and focus
our energies on what we feel is impor
tant for the future."
Provost reflections
"It seems like a long time ago, but 1
had a great time," Rice said of her six
year tenure as provost, the second
longest in Stanford's history.
"Gerhard [Casper] took a
gamble — I had never been a depart

ment chair and was young for the job
in a lot of ways. I did have experi
ences — my work in government and
industry — that were different than
others that worked well for me in
being provost," she said.
Rice highlighted her work with
Stanford Introductory Studies, revi
sions of the curriculum, inter-school
cooperation such as the Bio-X initia
tive and her interactions with students
as some of the best parts of her time in
the position.
"One of the things that I learned in
this job was that the best leaders create
the environment for good people to do
good things. That is the strength of any
positive progress or institution," she
said.
Rice's bottom-line, yet ultimately
successful, economic concerns did
raise eyebrows when she announced
plans in 1993 to slash the budget by $20
million over a three-year period.
"There were difficult aspects of the
job. We did have lo make budget
cuts — hard things like laying people
off — which was tough. But. you have
to establish priorities and your actions
have to reflect your strategic direction.
In the end. it was a necessary thing."
Rice said.
Rice's insistence on "restructuring"
and "strategic planning" coupled with
a few explosive decisions in the early
1990s often landed her in a maelstorm
of protest.
In April of 1995. the University laid
off Chicana administrator Cecilia Bur
ciaga, then-resident fellow at Casa Za
pata. Chicano students a three-day
hunger strike, making demands that
stymied the University at its highest
levels. Rice's handling of the situation
ended the stand-off but won her few
allies. One student negotiator said at
the time that "Condi closed all doors."
Rice also had further occassion to
clash with students, this time over
whether the University should ban
California table grapes. Student pro
testors hoped the University, as an in
stitution. would take a stand against
"the pesticide exposure and the poor
living conditions of California grape
workers."
As a response, the University
pledged in 1988 to have the Dean of
Students Office and University Dining
Services sponsor residence-based edu
cation and voting.Students continued
to protest, feeling the University's
stance to be insufficient.
Then, in 1995. the Offices of the
University President and Provost re
affirmed the status-quo policy. Rice
said at the time that "Stanford should

not be in the business of championing
any moral / political cause just because
one group wants it." It remains a cam
pus issue that claims a remarkable
amount of student attention.
Her time as provost was also often

recognized with issues of tenure, as
many found her policies and decisions
regarding tenure cases to be contro
versial. These were especially evident
with tenure cases surrounding former
History Asst. Prof Karen Sawislak and
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta
(who later received tenure), among
others.
When asked about tenure issues at
a senate meeting last May, Rice said
that she is "completely opposed to af
firmative action at the time of tenure
as a matter of principle. It would be a
slippery slope that we would be very
sorry to go down."
In spite of difficult times. Rice may
very well be remembered for her ded
ication to the needs of the student,
calling on each young scholar to "find
your passion and follow your heart."
In a farewell column to the commu
nity, printed in The Daily this May.
Rice wrote: "Embrace your time here.
Allow it to transform you. Stanford is
a remarkable place because of the
people here, including you. and be
cause of the bonds that unite us — a
love of learning and a love for this
great University."
A good team
Rice found working with Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper to be a
"fabulous" experience.
"We will always be the best of

friends. We were alike and un-alike in
many ways. We had the same values,
the same sense of humor and the same
sense of how you work in a relation
ship like that," she said.
"It was the most open working rela-

tionship I've ever had."
Shultz had high praise for Rice.
"Her work as provost is universally
regarded as outstanding. She did it
well," Shult/ said.
Raisian concurred.
"Condi complimented Casper's
leadership. She was a quick study of
the workings of a University," he said.
"The University is stronger — more
financially prosperous — because of
her."
Rice said that she could have con
tinued with the position hut would not
have had a career in international pol
itics to return to if she did.
"I realized somewhere along the
way that 1 didn't want to go on to a uni
versity presidency, which is what 1
thought that I wanted when 1 accepted
the job," Rice said. "The premium was
getting back to international issues
and the pull back was irresistible."
A decorated career
Rice has served on the Stanford
faculty since 1981 as a professor in the
Department of Political Science.
In addition to her numerous arti
cles and books, she has addressed au
diences in settings from the U.S. Am
bassador's Residence in Moscow to
the Commonwealth Club and the 1992
Republican National Convention.
Outside of Stanford. Rice is an ac
tive participant in industry as a mem

ber of a number of corporate boards of
directors and advisory bodies.
In the public sector. Rice served
from 1989 to 1991 during the period of
German re-unification and the final
days of the Soviet Union in the Bush
Administration on the National Secu
rity Council and as Special Assistant to
the President for National Security
Affairs.
Rice is also a Fellow of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences
and has been awarded honorary doc
torates from Morehouse College. Uni
versity of Alabama and University of
Notre Dame.

Rice said that she hasn't entirely
decided on what she plans to do when
her sabbatical ends.
"1 like to take things as they come. 1

but I may decide to take a bit longer

Her time as provost was also often

recognized with issues of tenure, as
many found her policies and decisions
regarding tenure cases to be contro
versial. These were especially evident
with tenure cases surrounding former
History Asst. Prof Karen Sawislak and
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta
(who later received tenure), among
others.
When asked about tenure issues at
a senate meeting last May, Rice said
that she is "completely opposed to af
firmative action at the time of tenure
as a matter of principle. It would be a
slippery slope that we would be very
sorry to go down."
In spite of difficult times. Rice may
very well be remembered for her ded
ication to the needs of the student,
calling on each young scholar to "find
your passion and follow your heart."
In a farewell column to the commu
nity, printed in The Daily this May.
Rice wrote: "Embrace your time here.
Allow it to transform you. Stanford is
a remarkable place because of the
people here, including you. and be
cause of the bonds that unite us — a
love of learning and a love for this
great University."
A good team
Rice found working with Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper to be a
"fabulous" experience.
"We will always be the best of

friends. We were alike and un-alike in
many ways. We had the same values,
the same sense of humor and the same
sense of how you work in a relation
ship like that," she said.
"It was the most open working rela-

tionship I've ever had."
Shultz had high praise for Rice.
"Her work as provost is universally
regarded as outstanding. She did it
well," Shult/ said.
Raisian concurred.
"Condi complimented Casper's
leadership. She was a quick study of
the workings of a University," he said.
"The University is stronger — more
financially prosperous — because of
her."
Rice said that she could have con
tinued with the position hut would not
have had a career in international pol
itics to return to if she did.
"I realized somewhere along the
way that 1 didn't want to go on to a uni
versity presidency, which is what 1
thought that I wanted when 1 accepted
the job," Rice said. "The premium was
getting back to international issues
and the pull back was irresistible."
A decorated career
Rice has served on the Stanford
faculty since 1981 as a professor in the
Department of Political Science.
In addition to her numerous arti
cles and books, she has addressed au
diences in settings from the U.S. Am
bassador's Residence in Moscow to
the Commonwealth Club and the 1992
Republican National Convention.
Outside of Stanford. Rice is an ac
tive participant in industry as a mem

ber of a number of corporate boards of
directors and advisory bodies.
In the public sector. Rice served
from 1989 to 1991 during the period of
German re-unification and the final
days of the Soviet Union in the Bush
Administration on the National Secu
rity Council and as Special Assistant to
the President for National Security
Affairs.
Rice is also a Fellow of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sciences
and has been awarded honorary doc
torates from Morehouse College. Uni
versity of Alabama and University of
Notre Dame.
Looking ahead
Rice said that she hasn't entirely
decided on what she plans to do when
her sabbatical ends.
"1 like to take things as they come. 1
finally decided to take my sabbatical,
but I may decide to take a bit longer
from the University and work in the
private sector. It's still an option — I
haven't decided vet." she said.
In terms of politics. Rice's mind is
clear.
"1 am admiring of those who put
themselves on the line for elected pol
itics. but I'm kind of a specialist. M\
kind of policy has to be centered in
the executive branch. Since I don't
plan to run for president. Congress
may not be the best place for me."
Rice said.
"Whatever 1 decide to do. eventu
ally I will return to teaching and to
Stanford. In a short period of time — I
don't know how long— I will miss it
and will want to get back. I could never
leave altogether."
Raisian also offered his opinions on
Rice's future.
"Every few years she transitions to
something else. There's no ceiling in
sight for her." he said. "I know that she
will have every opportunity that she
wants come her way."
Shultz agreed.
"Condi is a very able person —
very bright, experienced and a foun
tain of common sense." he said.
"She has the ability to go far in any
thing she undertakes."
Outside of the office. Rice w ants to
get back to playing the piano and some
tennis and plans on attending as many
Stanford sporting events as possible.
She also looks forward to more
time with her family.
Rice said. "It's been a very demand
ing and busy six years."
"It's going to be nice not to have an
inbox for a while."

Miler Lee — Daily
At a rally for graduate student housing, Rice takes the time to speak with
concerned students.
For former University Provost
Condoleezza Rice it's been one of her
busiest summers. She's supposed to be
in the middle of a sabbatical.
Rice, currently on a one-year acad
emic leave of absence from the Uni
versity, has been spending most of her
time in her much-publicized role ad
vising Texas Gov. George W. Bush on
foreign policy issues connected with
his bid for the 2(XX) presidential race.
"It's one heck of an interesting way
to use a sabbatical," she said.
Spending much of her lime on the
road this summer. Rice has been
working with the campaign a great
deal. While she doesn't expect to work
full-time as the campaign accelerates
in the months ahead. Rice does expect
that she might need to become more
involved.
"Campaigns are very difficult to
pace." Rice said. "Candidates need to
consider carefully how speeches and
policy stances are given and kind of
play it by ear."
Following a six-year tenure as
provost. Rice was succeeded by Engi
neering Prof. John Hennessy on July 1.
Effective that same day was her ap
pointment as a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
Although she is on leave from her
professorship in the Political Science
Department. Rice plans to be on cam
pus in September to work at Hoover.
She also will continue her work in in-

dustry. serving on a number of corpo
rate hoards, including that of Chevron
Corp. and the International Advisory
Council for J.P. Morgan.

Budding relationships
Rice said that the majority of her
time thus far on the campaign has been
spent helping Bush react to foreign
policy issues. Citing Kosovo and the
most recent issues in Taiwan as exam
ples, Rice said that looking at current
foreign policy has been especially im
portant so far in the campaign.
"The international scene has been
more active than expected," she said.
As new stances are solidified and
the campaign progresses. Rice said
that Bush will begin to give foreign
policy speeches. But. because of the
presidential race thus far, the timing
will be more complex.
"Bush should really be one among
many at this point in the race, but he's
not — he has a very high profile," she
said. "One needs to consider how to
best make use of support and keep the
momentum high into the election.
That can be tricky."
Rice joins a number of other Stan
ford and Hoover-affiliated personali
ties. including former Secretary of
State George Shultz and Economics
Profs. Michael Boskin and John Tay
lor.
And as for the anticipated next
step, namely any potential involve
ments should Bush be elected. Rice
said that there isn't one. at least not
yet.
"I am someone who all my life
hasn't planned the next step. 1 didn't
plan to become provost, and I didn't
plan any past governmental involve
ments that I've had. I'm going to stick
bv that." she said.

"I won't plan for something that
hasn't happened yet."
Shultz, who served as, in addition to
Secretary of State, chairman of then-

President Reagan's Economic Policy
Board, Secretary of Treasury and Sec
retary of Labor said, "I have seen
[Rice] academically, politically and so
cially to have good, strong and sensible
views."
"She has [Bush's] confidence. They
make a good partnership, and Bush
knows that," Shultz added.
"I have tremendous respect for
[Bush]. I think that he would make an
excellent president," Rice said.
"Everything is up in the air at this
point, and I don't see a point in spend
ing any time thinking about my future
role with him as yet."
A tremendous opportunity
Rice is noticeably excited about the
possibility of continuing her work at
Hoover.
"I am really looking forward to
doing things like writing and going to
seminars — all the stuff I couldn't do
when 1 was provost. It is a tremendous
opportunity." she said.
"One of the greatest things about
working here is the ability to talk with
people who have interests that are
both alike and different from yours.
That stimulates your own thinking."
While at Hoover, Rice plans to con
tinue pursuing her research interests,
which include the politics of eastern
and central Europe and the former
Soviet Union and international securi
ty policy.
She is currently working on a book
called "Turning Point." which is about
major turning points leading to the
end of the Cold War; Rice also plans to
write a number of articles.
"In some ways I'm glad that 1 was
out of politics for those years," Rice
said. "I think that there was a clean
break from that world and conse
quently, I think that I have fewer pre
conceptions from the world before
that I was trained in."
Hoover Institution Director John
Raisian said that they were "eager to
have [Ricej on any terms "
"Condi is a truly gifted person. She
brings Hoover her wealth of quality
ideas and her talent as a speaker. All in
all. it is a big win for us and for her,"
Raisian said.
"Even though she is relatively
young, she is a very experienced and
very polished individual. We're lucky
to have her." he added.
Raisian said that, to his knowledge,
Rice is the first female African Amer
ican to become a Hoover fellow, at
least in the past ten years.
Research aside. Rice views Hoover

as more of a resource than anything
else.
"I'm looking forward to sharpening
my mind and intellect... throwing
ideas around, having them challenged
... challenging other people in a set
ting where that's encouraged," she
said.
Pillars of a new order
Policy-wise, Rice wants students to
know that she is someone who has re-

alistic views about the international
system. While she wants to promote a
strong American role, she doesn't
think of herself as a "grand strategist."
"I tell my students that policy mak
ing is 90 percent blocking and tackling
and 10 percent intellectual. An awful
lot of policy making is mundane," she
said.
"The last time 1 entered the foreign
policy scene, I was fortunate that it ex
ploded. It would be foolhardy to think
that type of occurrence could happen
again."
Specifically, Rice named three im
portant considerations that she feels
should be addressed in the next centu
ry's foreign policy scheme: the rebuild
ing of the American military, a redefi
nition of the purpose of the military
and the impact of globalization.

"We are in a tremendous transition
right now from the old Cold War to
something new." Rice said. "Whatev
er the outcome, what will be important
are the power balances underneath
the policy ... strategic relations with
the other 'great' powers like Russia,
China, Europe. Japan, maybe India."
"Some are allies, others are uncer
tain. But getting these relationships
right is important."
Rice feels that military cutbacks,
have cut too deeply into the armed)

forces.
"If the military pay grades are 15
percent below that of civilians, it's no
wonder why we can recruit people in.
Sergeants on food stamps, the Air
Force cannibalizing one plan to fly an
other — change is needed," she said
But a simple increase in military
spending is, in her view, not a one-shot
deal. Questions surrounding the mili
tary's purpose, especially after the fall
of the former Soviet Union, need to be
answered.
"People are uncomfortable that the
military is really everywhere - Haiti,
Kosovo. Our military can't be just
'Dial 911 America,'" Rice said. "We
want to involve ourselves in the hu
manitarian civil war but is that really
the proper role for our military?"
And, at the same time, Rice's cor

porate experience has brought her to
see the impact of globalization, name
ly the effects of private capital on other
markets and countries.
"Countries were variously pre
pared for globalization. The U.S. was
almost perfectly prepared, and Russia
wasn't positioned so well. The world is
too dependent on private capital, but
that's the way it should be. Sometimes
capital can be Draconian and ruthless
in its choices," Rice said.
"If winners and losers in this game

are countries, it could have unstabling
effects. We need to address these is
sues now, for later," she said.
"1 like to think of this as several pil
lars of some new order that we have
time to shape, but not forever. Even
tually these things will harden and our
ability to shape them will be limited,"
she added.
"We need to prioritize and focus
our energies on what we feel is impor
tant for the future."
Provost reflections
"It seems like a long time ago, but 1
had a great time," Rice said of her six
year tenure as provost, the second
longest in Stanford's history.
"Gerhard [Casper] took a
gamble — I had never been a depart

ment chair and was young for the job
in a lot of ways. I did have experi
ences — my work in government and
industry — that were different than
others that worked well for me in
being provost," she said.
Rice highlighted her work with
Stanford Introductory Studies, revi
sions of the curriculum, inter-school
cooperation such as the Bio-X initia
tive and her interactions with students
as some of the best parts of her time in
the position.
"One of the things that I learned in
this job was that the best leaders create
the environment for good people to do
good things. That is the strength of any
positive progress or institution," she
said.
Rice's bottom-line, yet ultimately
successful, economic concerns did
raise eyebrows when she announced
plans in 1993 to slash the budget by $20
million over a three-year period.
"There were difficult aspects of the
job. We did have lo make budget
cuts — hard things like laying people
off — which was tough. But. you have
to establish priorities and your actions
have to reflect your strategic direction.
In the end. it was a necessary thing."
Rice said.
Rice's insistence on "restructuring"
and "strategic planning" coupled with
a few explosive decisions in the early
1990s often landed her in a maelstorm
of protest.
In April of 1995. the University laid
off Chicana administrator Cecilia Bur
ciaga, then-resident fellow at Casa Za
pata. Chicano students a three-day
hunger strike, making demands that
stymied the University at its highest
levels. Rice's handling of the situation
ended the stand-off but won her few
allies. One student negotiator said at
the time that "Condi closed all doors."
Rice also had further occassion to
clash with students, this time over
whether the University should ban
California table grapes. Student pro
testors hoped the University, as an in
stitution. would take a stand against
"the pesticide exposure and the poor
living conditions of California grape
workers."
As a response, the University
pledged in 1988 to have the Dean of
Students Office and University Dining
Services sponsor residence-based edu
cation and voting.Students continued
to protest, feeling the University's
stance to be insufficient.
Then, in 1995. the Offices of the
University President and Provost re
affirmed the status-quo policy. Rice
said at the time that "Stanford should

not be in the business of championing
any moral / political cause just because
one group wants it." It remains a cam
pus issue that claims a remarkable
amount of student attention.
Her time as provost was also often

recognized with issues of tenure, as
many found her policies and decisions
regarding tenure cases to be contro
versial. These were especially evident
with tenure cases surrounding former
History Asst. Prof Karen Sawislak and
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta
(who later received tenure), among
others.
When asked about tenure issues at
a senate meeting last May, Rice said
that she is "completely opposed to af
firmative action at the time of tenure
as a matter of principle. It would be a
slippery slope that we would be very
sorry to go down."
In spite of difficult times. Rice may
very well be remembered for her ded
ication to the needs of the student,
calling on each young scholar to "find
your passion and follow your heart."
In a farewell column to the commu
nity, printed in The Daily this May.
Rice wrote: "Embrace your time here.
Allow it to transform you. Stanford is
a remarkable place because of the
people here, including you. and be
cause of the bonds that unite us — a
love of learning and a love for this
great University."
