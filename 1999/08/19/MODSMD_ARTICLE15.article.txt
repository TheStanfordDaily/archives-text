## R.E.M. feels fine at Shoreline Aug. 13 concert delivers satisfying mix of old and new songs 
### Ricky Opaterny Contributing writer 
"Somebody somewhere said that today
is the end of the world," lead singer Michael
Stipe announced to a near-sell-out crowd at
Mountain View's Shoreline Amphitheater
during R.E.M.'s concert on Aug. 13.
If that in fact was the end. then it was a
glorious and very fitting one for the band's
two-decade run. as it evolved from a south
ern college band to rock super stardom. It is
likely that this was the band's final Bay Area
appearance, but despite their inevitable
demise, the show was an exemplary perfor
mance which highlighted the band's greatest
work.
They opened with the mellow and myste
rious "Airportman," before going into the
fast and electric "Lotus," both from the
band's latest album "Up," which was re
leased last October.
Ten songs from their set were drawn
from "Up," including the band's first perfor
mance of "Sad Professor" on their current
tour, which spanned 20 European venues
before arriving in the United States last
week.
"Sad Professor" is about an old professor
realizing his own personal problems and the
isolation that they produce. This led into

"The One I Love," the bands first, top-ten
single from the 1987 release, "Document."
Surprisingly included in the set were "Pil
grimage" from the band's debut release
"Murmur" and "Find the River," a moving
song that re-affirms life and includes the line,
"The ocean is the river's goal." It can safely
be said that R.E.M. has undoubtedly
reached the ocean and has been swimming
in it for years.
The only unreleased song played by the
band was"The Great Beyond," which they
wrote for the upcoming movie, "Man on the
Moon." The movie focuses on the life of co
median Andy Kaufman, who is featured
prominently in the lyrics of the band's song
of the same name.
"Man on the Moon," with its belief in the
unlimited potential of life and numerous his
torical allusions, closed the band's regular
set before they returned for a six-song en
core.
After leaving the stage for a few minutes.
Stipe returned and attempted to play a solo
version of "Hope" on the acoustic guitar.
However, he ended up playing an abbreviat
ed version, forgetting verses and inverting
much of what he could remember. This was
followed by guitarist Mike Mills and Stipe
collaborating on the ballad, "Why Not
Smile."

R.E.M. eventually concluded with, "It's
the End of the World as we Know it (And 1
Feel Fine)," a fast-paced, stream of con
sciousness song with apocalyptic under
tones. After the song ended, the band
paused briefly before repeating the chorus
multiple times to the close the show.
Though placing emphasis on their most
recent work, the band's set list was strong
throughout. Stipe was upbeat the entire
evening, dancing wildly on stage and inter
acting with the audience. At one point, he
acknowledged a fan as "our sad professor,"
after the audience member commented that
Stipe's comparison of his fumbling with the
microphone stand to his own personality
was "a poor analogy."
The band, now reduced to three mem
bers after drummer Bill Berry retired in late
1997, was augmented by drummer Joey
Waronker, who plays for Beck and is joining
R.E.M. on their tour.
The band, which often sings about reflec
tions on childhood and society, exuded con
fidence and left the crowd very satisfied.
During "End of the World," Mills ran up
into one of the aisles, symbolically connect
ing the enduring status of the band with gen
erations of fans who continue to admire
R.E.M.'s alternative nature and refusal to
sell out to the forces of popular music.
