# Play with Ataris

The sound of The Ataris is probably nothing new to
those who are used to rock with a lot of pop in its punk.
Produced by Joey Cape of Lagwagon, The Ataris'
latest release, "Blue Skies, Broken Hearts' Next 12
Exits" offers up 14 songs that could easily be charac
terized as having the Fat Wreck melodic punk sound.
Indeed, the band put out an EP last year through Fat
Wreck Chords, although The Ataris' second full
length is released by Kung Fu.
But there is something superior about "Blue Skies"
that sets it apart from the scores of new school punk
releases scattering the local Tower Records. For
starters, The Ataris is made up of four talented musi
cians who tour with dedication. They don't cater to
any kind of audience expectation. And it's also some
what impressive to see one band sing so many songs
about girls.
Track eight, "The Last Song 1 Will Ever Write
About A Girl," is clearly a lie, seeing as the next six
songs are also about girls. The running female theme
does get a tad monotonous at times, but well-placed,
overtly cheesy lyrics and numerous '80s references
make up for any hints of redundancy that might slip
through.
The Ataris doesn't serve up anything visionary
here, but it's definitely a solid record. Their homage to
"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure," with a song ti
tled, "San Dimas High School Football Rules," is
merely an added bonus.
