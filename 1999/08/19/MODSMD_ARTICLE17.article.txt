# 'Brokedown Palace' in need of major repairs
## Danes stars in film that is too much like 'My So Called Life' in a Thai prison 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
If you believe everything you see
in the movies, life in a Thai prison is a
lot like kindergarten. There's nap
time, meal time, time to paint and
even time set aside each day for dress
ing up the prison dog in a pink gown.
"Brokedown Palace's" story be
gins with best friends Alice (Claire
Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckin
sale) setting off from small-town,
midwestern America to exotic
Bangkok, Thailand for a post-gradua
tion, pre-real world vacation.
After a few days exploring the
magic and wonders of Thailand, the
pair meets up with Nick Parks
(Daniel Lapaine), a seductive and
handsome Aussie expatriate living in
Bangkok.
The inevitable romantic conflict
begins as both girls are smitten by

Parks' charm. Parks eventually asks
the girls to accompany him on a week
end getaway to Hong Kong, and sur
prise, surprise, the duo is arrested at
the airport after the Thai authorities
find a kilo of heroin in Danes' pack.
Now, if the willing suspension of
disbelief hasn't kicked in at this point

in the movie, get ready to fire that bad
boy up. The girls are whisked away to
a prison known as the "brokedown
palace" for its inhumane conditions
and, after a sham interrogation and
confession, are sentenced to lengthy
prison terms.
The most glaring irony of the

movie is the prison itself. Despite
published reports worldwide about
the inhumane conditions in Thai pris
ons, life for the girls is pretty cushy.
They spend their days lounging
about, conversing with a pair of fel
low, English-speaking inmates and
enjoy visits from parents and high
school friends.
But soon, the girls begin to realize
the gravity of their situation and that
the "we're American, don't Ameri
can laws apply to us?" defense isn't
going to fly with the Thai authorities.
Enter "Yankee" Hank, played by
Bill Pullman, fresh from saving the
world from alien invaders. Pullman
plays a fellow American lawyer who
lives in Thailand, and he agrees to
take the girls' case and delves into the
mystery of Parks, who has disap
peared and the suspect confession
that both girls were forced to sign.
From this point on, it's a legal

thriller of sorts set in the world of the
Thai justice system, rather than John
Grisham's American South.
On the whole, the characters fall
well short of expectations. Danes,
who has received acclaim for her
work in previous films, never seems to
grasp the enormity of her character's
situation. No matter how had it gets,
she is not without a chummy smile
and witty remark. You definitely get
the feeling that she's going for "Mv So
Called Life" in a Thai prison.
Beckinsale turns in the movie's
best performance, playing the naive,
high school goody-goody to perfec
tion and shows at least some emotion
at her plight in prison.
While not without some impres
sive visuals and dramatic crescendos
(not every eye in the house was as dry
as mine), "Brokedown Palace" leaves
one with many a suspicion and quite a
few unfulfilled expectations.
