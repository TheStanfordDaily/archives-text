## Psychological study on prisoners investigated 
### Neela Dasgupta Contributing writer 
Drugs may have been illegally ad
ministered to teenage prisoners in a
1997 Stanford psychiatry research
study, state officials said on Aug. 19.
In the study, 61 male inmates,
aged 14 to 18 and convicted of violent
offenses, were given, over a period of
seven weeks, varying doses of De
pakote, a prescription drug used to
control epileptic seizures and manic
episodes.
Psychiatry Prof. Hans Steiner,
who headed the study, intended to
see if the drug would reduce aggres
siveness in young prisoners.
According to an official statement
released by the Medical Center News
Bureau, "The goal was to reduce neg
ative emotions, such as anger, and in
doing so, to reduce reactive violence
and crimes and improve youth's in
volvement in school and other Cali
fornia Youth Authority programs."

Conflicts with state laws
Conducted at a CYA correctional
center in Stockton, the research may
have broken state laws and has pro
voked controversy. According to a
current state statute, "no biomedical
research shall be conducted on any
prisoner in the state." However, an
other state law, intended to help
AIDS/HIV victims, states that exper
imental drugs can be used if they
medically benefit the wards.
In Steiner's application for study
approval, he noted that youth cur
rently treated with the medication
"report [an] increase in self esteem
and well-being, especially when their
mood improves. We expect similar
results in this study."
Previous tests have shown that
Depakote can cause vomiting, hair
loss, depression, inability to sleep and
dizziness. The inmates tested, howev
er. have not displayed such side ef
fects, according to J.P Tremblay, as

sistant director of CY A.
Steiner's study
Steiner's study became a center of
attention when state authorities
claimed that appropriate measures
were not taken to approve the study.
Tremblay acknowledged that "a
legal review was not done by our de
partment." Steiner could not be
reached for comment.
The study is also under fire be
cause of controversy surrounding
consent by the inmates. While all of
the wards participated voluntarily,
some parents of the underage
teenagers did not respond to the offi
cial mailed consent forms within 30
days. In those cases, the CYA con
sented for them, Tremblay said.
State administrators voiced con
cern about civil rights violations.
"The Governor is not going to
stand for inmates' being used as
guinea pigs," said Hilary McLean, a

spokeswoman for Gov. Gray Davis.
"We are slamming the doors on stud
ies of this nature."
Although California law prohibits
minors from giving consent on their
own, the inmates' decisions may still
have fallen under ethical bounds, ac
cording to Asst. Prof. Jon Merz at the
Center for Bioethics at the Universi
ty of Pennsylvania.
"One problem in ethics is whether
a 14-year-old is recognized as having
the capacity to make a valid judg
ment. It's generally accepted that he
or she is, but California law doesn't
necessarily give minors the decision
making power," Merz said. "It's a sit
uation where law departs from ethi
cal standards."
Merz added that the problem with
consent may not have been age, but
rather the fact that all participants
were incarcerated.
"Are they really free to give con
sent without coercion?" Merz said.
"Some kids might be afraid of the

consequences if they refused to con
sent. They must have had limited op
tions."
The Stanford Center for Biomed
ical Ethics had no comments about
the situation.
Following the rules
Stanford representatives maintain
that the University followed thor
ough procedures for approval of the
research. The Stanford Human Sub
jects Committee reviewed the drug
testing plans in the spring and sum
mer of 1996. In addition, the Univer
sity contacted the Office for Protec
tion from Research Risks, the FDA
and the Department of Health and
Human Services to obtain guidance
on proper actions to take, according
to the Medical Center News Bureau.
The study received approval from
a prison expert, who served as an ad-
vocate for the teenage prisoners.
"Since the risks are relatively
low, the benefit-risk ratio is favor
able," the prison expert said in a re
port, which was cited in a press re
lease.
Steiner's project was also re
viewed and approved by another
medical institution, and it received a
letter of approval from the CYA.
This letter, written by Dan Cashman,
the CYA Medical Director at the
time, did not verify that legal statutes
were met, Tremblay said.
Tremblay suggested that the tests
did not receive proper scrutiny be

Stanford, which has a good reputa-

tion for research projects.
"There was an assumption that
Stanford had done a comprehensive
review on state laws, but there was
miscommunication on both sides,
and something slipped through the
cracks," he said.
Aside from a vitamin administra
tion study in the early 19905, this was

the first research study done with
CYA authorization involving med
ication, Tremblay said.
"There may not have been clear
policy on how a legal review should
be done," he said.
Inconsistent Policies
Red Hodges, overseer of a study
measuring the effect of vitamins on
incarcerated teens long before the
Steiner project, expressed frustration
about how easy it was for Steiner to
conduct research.
Hodges has been lobbying end
lessly to do further studies on how
nutrients can be used to lessen vio
lent behavior.
"We have to roll over getting nu
trients (into the CYA), and these
guys go in under the cover of dark
ness because they're scientists â€” and
they're giving kids drugs, for Christ's

sake," Hodges said to the San Jose
Mercury News. "1 say. no, no.
They've got to do the same thing we
did and get a law changed first."
The 1997 tests received attention
when Steiner sent a request to the
CYA to do a follow-up study on the
inmates. Greg Zermeno. appointed
to the position of youth authority di

rector by Gov. Davis in March of
1997, then became curious about the
initial study.
The CYA's renewed interest in
what they previously approved may
be a political move, Ruthann
Richter, a medical center spokes
woman, told the Mercury News.
"The CYA is re-evaluating a posi
tion they took three years ago on the
part of a new director and new ad
ministration. who are taking a differ
ent tact politically," she said.
The Next Step
Gov. Davis has asked the attorney
general and the new inspector gener
al to investigate Steiners study and
the legal implications. The CYA is
also currently running an internal in
vestigation on how research is ap
proved. The entire investigation may
take a couple of months, Tremblay
said.
To ensure that any new research
projects undergo thorough investi
gation, the CYA implemented a
new policy a few months ago dictat
ing that a board, agency and the
governor's office must give their
seals of approval before testing be
gins.
"Before, in practice, if a re
searcher came in and wanted to do
some kind of socioeconomic or de
mographic study and wanted to inter
view the inmates, they could just ap
proach the research bureau and basi
cally get approval there," Tremblay
said.
