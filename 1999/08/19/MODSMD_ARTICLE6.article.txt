# Poverty harms humans more than apes
##

Monkeys and apes may form a
healthier society than humans, ac
cording to Biology Prof. Robert
Sapolsky.
Sapolsky said that because mon
keys and apes of low social classes
suffer less disadvantages than poor
people, their societies tend to pre-

>ent fewer health risks.
In an article in the June 24 issue
Df USA Today, Sapolsky concluded
hat poverty creates a constant

health risk for humans, while pri
mates on the low-end of the social
spectrum can experience a variety
of effects.
Among primates, dominance hi
erarchies — where there may be a
No. 1 animal and a No. 10 animal —
are based on an unequal distribu
tion of resources, according to the
article.
"In a troop of baboons, for ex
ample, rank determines access to
food or how often you're socially
groomed," Sapolsky wrote in the
article. "It determines whether you
can sit in the shade in the heat of
day or in a safe place when a preda
tor lurks."
Low-ranking individuals in this
system may be subject to more
physical stress because they work
harder and eat less, but with vari
ables such as how long the current
hierarchy lasts, the meaning of sub
ordination in different groups and
diverse animal personalities, low
ranked monkeys are not always at
the bottom of the barrel.
In human societies, however,
where "the closest equivalent to
low social status among primates is
low socioeconomic status," Sapol
sky said in the article, there is a
more direct relationship between
social rank and disease patterns.
Without the variables of the
apes' society, poverty inevitably
leads to poor health among hu

mans.
"Being a low-ranking primate
tends to have fewer detrimental
health effects than being a low so
cioeconomic status, westernized
human because a low SES is simply
less subject to social modifiers than
is low social rank in a non-human
primate," Sapolsky said.
The article said that poverty
consistently leads to bad health be
cause it prevents access to quality
health care, preventive medicine or
education about nutrition, and
often leads to less social support
and more stress.
The result, Sapolsky said, is that
while apes can hope for a new rank
ing system to take over or make
friends with which to share their
burdens, lower-ranked humans on
the SES scale cannot hope for vari
able circumstances.
"With humans, the SES / health
gradient comes with few 'it de
pends'," he said. "In a wide range of
societies, poverty is a terrible
health risk, a sledgehammer with
few qualifiers or subtleties."
Sapolsky was able to compare pri
mate societies to human culture be
cause he studies primates in the
Serengeti of East Africa for three
months each year. He uses such
techniques as behavioral observa
tion, tissue biopsies, blood samples
and cardiovascular measures to
conduct research.
