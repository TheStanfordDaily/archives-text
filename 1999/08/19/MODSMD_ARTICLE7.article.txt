# Legalized abortion linked to reduction in crime rates

### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
A new study co-written by Law
School Prof. John Donohue is re
ceiving nationwide attention. The
unpublished study, "Legalized
Abortion and Crime," suggests that
the legalization of abortion in the
1970s has contributed to a decrease
in crime in the past decade.
The two researchers, Donohue
and economist Stephen Levitt of the
University of Chicago, argue that
women whose children would have
been most likeiy to commit crimes as
young adults chose to abort their
pregnancies in the 19705, thus de
creasing the amount of young crimi
nals in the 19905.
The study is currently being cir
culated among economists and
criminal-law experts, and it has re
ceived acclaim from Judge Richard
Posner of the 7th U.S. Court of Ap
peals in Chicago.
In a statement to the Associated
Press, Posner called the study "a
striking, original, rigorous and per
suasive — although not conclusive
— demonstration of the common
sensical point that unwanted chil
dren are quite likely not to turn out
to be the best citizens."
Donohue and Levitt have been

working on this study for the past
two years, and they have already
published several papers together.
"We never thought we would be
besieged by the press over this,"
stated Donohue. "It is surprising.
For a long time I dwelled in relative
obscurity."
For the past two weeks, Dono
hue has been invited for interviews
on both television and radio pro
grams. His house and office were
flooded with calls, even as he pre
pared for his trip to Yale University,
where he will be spending fall se
mester as a visiting professor.
Along with praise, Donohue and
Levitt have also received criticism
from pro-life groups who claim that
the study supports abortion rights.
In a statement to The Guardian,
David O'Steen, executive director
of the National Right to Life Com
mittee, called the study "bizarre,"
and he claimed that it does not give
a convincing argument for abortion
rights.
"You mean killing babies in the
1970s led people in the 1990s to do
less shoplifting? I can't believe that
any significant percent of the popu
lation would argue that we should
kill unborn babies to affect whatev
er they say is being affected," O'Steen
stated.
Claiming that the point of the
study is not to support abortion,
Donohue stated that the study mere
ly explains a causal relationship be
tween abortion and crime rate.
"I am very removed from the
whole abortion debate. I am just a sci
entist trying to figure out what the
facts are, and I leave the debate up to
other people," Donohue stated.
However, the controversial thesis

has some critics calling the study
racial eugenics, because it suggests
that a decrease in poor minority chil
dren born in the 1970s contributed to
the drop in crime.
"I don't think it's our job as econo
mists and scientists to withhold truth
because some people are not going to
like it," Levitt said.
Levitt argued that the aborted
children would have been the ones
"most likely to be unloved by their
mothers, to have faced intense pover
ty and to have had tough lives."
The researchers state that legal
ized abortion may account for as
much as half of the overall crime drop

in the United States between 1991
and 1997. Donohue also suggested
that the study allows for skepticism
about the other asserted causes for
decreased crime.
"People say that increased incar
ceration and increased policing on
our streets are the reasons why crime
is falling, but perhaps these are not
the root causes," Donohue said. "The
negative implication of the study is
that perhaps we should not be spend
ing so much money on police and
prisons."
Donohue believes that a goal is to
reduce the number of unwanted chil
dren.
