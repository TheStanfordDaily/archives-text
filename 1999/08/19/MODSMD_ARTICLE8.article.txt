## New research greatly reduces risks of in vitro fertilization 
### Neela Dasgupta Contributing writer 
Women may no longer have to
fear the risks involved with multiple
births if they undergo a new in vitro
fertilization procedure developed
and used by Stanford researchers in a
recent study.
With this technique, known as
blastocyst transfer, women are just as
likely to get pregnant if doctors trans
fer two embryos into the womb in
stead of three or more, according to
the new study.
Virtually eliminating the chance of
triplets — which can be risky to preg
nant women — the approach can
maintain, or even increase, a woman's
chance of getting pregnant, said Gy
necology and Obstetrics Assoc. Prof.
Amin Milki, the lead author of the
study.
"There are two major gambles
with IVF," Milki said. "The first gam
ble is getting pregnant versus not get
ting pregnant. Once you achieve a

pregnancy, the woman's second
worry begins — how pregnant am I?
This technique won't decrease her
odds of conceiving and at the same
time avoids her risks of having
triplets."
Traditionally, doctors have trans
ferred three to six three-day-old em
bryos into the uterus, in the hope that
at least one will develop into a healthy
fetus. However this sometimes leads
to the conception of three or more fe
tuses, which can threaten the preg
nancy and may force women to opt
for selective reduction, the removal of
one or more fully-formed fetuses, to
give the pregnancy a better chance of
success.
In more recent studies, however,
the embryos are kept alive for five
days instead of the typical three days,
allowing them to reach the blastocyst
stage, at which point the doctors can
discern which embryos are the most
viable. Then the doctors only need to
transfer two or three embryos into the
woman's uterus.

"We can see the embryos undergo
differentiation, and the best ones
have a well-defined, inner-cell mass
(which eventually becomes the fetus)
and well-developed outer cells (which
ultimately becomes the placenta),"
said Gynecology and Obstetrics Asst.
Prof. Barry Behr, co-author of the re
port.
A year ago, Behr, director of Stan
ford's IVF and Assisted Reproduc
tive Technology Laboratory, devel
oped the special nutrient-rich culture
medium that allows embryos to sur
vive five days, making the transfer
possible. The blastocyst transfer, he
said, relies on a survival-of-the-fittest
mechanism among the embryos.
"The analogy I like to make is with
a marathon," Behr said. "If you look
at who's ahead at the five-mile mark,
there is little correlation to who will
win the 30-mile race. That's what doc
tors have been trying to do with three
day-old embryos. With our method,
you are looking at the runners a mile
before the finish line — these are em

bryos fit to live the longest."
In the newest study, Milki and
Behr set out to determine whether
two embryos might serve the purpose
as well as three, avoiding the need for
selective reduction. When Stanford
first began offering the procedure in
1998, 55 women chose to participate
in the study and undergo blastocyst
transfer.
Milki and Behr's results show that
women who had two embryos trans
ferred had just as good — in fact
slightly better — chances of getting
pregnant as those who had three em
bryos transferred. Of the 29 patients
who chose to have a two-embryo
transfer, 62 percent achieved a viable
pregnancy, with all of them passing
the first trimester mark.
Among the 24 women who chose a
three-embryo transfer, 58 percent
conceived a viable pregnancy and
were referred to obstetricians for pre
natal care, the researchers reported in
the August issue of the journal Fertil
ity and Sterility.

"This is the first data that shows
that you can reduce the number of
embryos while maintaining or in
creasing the pregnancy rate," Behr
said.
The results also suggested that
transferring only two embryos al
lowed women to avoid high-risk,
triplet births. Among the women who
had two-embryo transfers, 39 percent
conceived more than one fetus (all
twins). Among those who had a
three-embryo transfer, 79 percent
conceived more than one fetus — 50
percent twins and the other 29 per
cent triplets.
The patients who chose to transfer
three embryos were counseled about
the risks associated with multiple ges
tations, and all those who conceived
triplets elected to selectively reduce
one embryo to minimize the overall
risk of pregnancy, Milki said.
Since the researchers compiled
data on the initial 55 patients, the
Stanford IVF Clinic has performed
blastocyst transfer on an additional 55
women, with similar results, Milki
said.
Behr pointed out that the success
rate may be due not only to the selec
tion process, but also to the time the
embryo is placed back into the uterus.
"In nature a three-day embryo is
normally going down the fallopian
tube, but traditionally, we have put it
straight into the uterus. At five days,
the blastocyst would normally be in

the uterus — since this is physiologi
cally natural, there is probably a syn
chrony between the uterine lining
and the fetus," Behr said.
The researchers have received in
ternational recognition for their
work. Behr gave a lecture in France
on July 26, and he will soon give talks
in Boston, Tokyo and New York
about the blastocyst transfer proce
dure.
Although the doctors have clinical
evidence that the technique is work
ing and that it could be implemented
worldwide, they are still currently
doing research to figure out the basis
behind how the technique works.
