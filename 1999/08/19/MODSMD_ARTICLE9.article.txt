# Proposal could lessen loans

### Rajat Bhatnagar 
On Aug. 5, Congress passed a
$792 billion tax cut, which is the
largest tax cut in 18 years and also is a
proposal that could have a significant
impact on college students.
According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, if passed, the bill
would offer tax breaks amounting to
$7.2 billion over the next 10 years to
students nationwide. The bill would
also expand interest deduction for
student loans.
Right now, students can deduct
the interest on their loans from their
taxable income for only five years.
The bill would eliminate this time re
striction, allowing students to deduct
the interest from their taxable in
come until their loans are repaid.
Also, more people would be eligi
ble for these benefits. Current restric
tions make the deduction available
only to children of married couples
with a combined income of less than
$60,(XX). The bill would increase the
limit to $80,000.
The legislation would also aid stu
dents and parents with college-sav
ings plans. Interest on money instate
college-savings accounts would be
made tax-free starting in 2(X)1.
However, Cynthia Hartley, direc
tor of Student Awards and manager
of Financial Aid, said the plans "that
would become tax-free would be the
state programs, and not the private
programs which serve many people."

The private college-savings ac
counts would be made only tax-de
ferred, meaning that taxes are paid
not as interest accumulates, but
rather as money is withdrawn.
Given that private college-savings
accounts will not be made tax-free,
the bill is likely to have the least ben
efits where state programs are not al
ready operating.
"There probably isn't going to be
much initial impact for many people
in California, at least [as the Califor
nia program is just starting]," Hartley
said. "But for those [parents] funding
their children from other states, it cer
tainly could be beneficial."
Another noteworthy provision of
the bill is that it would renew govern
ment tax credits for universities'
money spent on research and devel
opment projects. Stanford gains
these credits as it makes research
partnerships with businesses in the
private sector.
Republican congressmen hope to
spend the time between now and
Sept. 8, when the bill reaches the
president's desk, drumming up public
support from their constituents to
bolster unity and promote their legis
lation.
However in a statement to the As
sociated Press on Aug. 6, President
Clinton promised to veto the bill, de
claring that this bill "threatens Social
Security and Medicare and imperils
the prosperity that has brought real
benefits to American families."
