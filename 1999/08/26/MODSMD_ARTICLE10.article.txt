##

The University's total endow
ment value has increased from $4.4
billion to $5.5 billion for the most re
cent fiscal year, a growth that re
flects wise investing and increased
alumni donations, according to the
Stanford Management Company.
"[The Development Office] has
been doing an exceptional job, and I
would expect new gifts to continue
to add to Stanford's endowment,"
said Laurance Hoagland, CEO of
Stanford Management Company.
From 1998 to 1999, the endow
ment fund grew by over $1 billion,
up from the previous year's growth
of approximately $85 million, ac
cording to Nacubo. a non-profit or
ganization that performs studies on
university endowments.
According to results of the annu
al endowment study from Nacubo,
the 1998 fiscal year showed an aver
age return of 18 percent.
Last year's totals showed Har
vard University with the highest en
dowment pool in the nation, fol
lowed by Yale University, Prince
ton University and Stanford. The
official endowment figures for Har
vard, Yale and Princeton are still
being tabulated for Nacubo's offi
cial report in October.
"After 17 years of the most ex
traordinary stock market returns in

U.S. history, it would not be surpris
ing to see the environment become
much more difficult for generating
strong returns," Hoagland said.
With about 50 percent of the en
dowment riding on domestic and in
ternational stocks, the global econo
my affects the endowment directly.
According to the Stanford Man
agement Company, as recently as
February of this year, interest from
Stanford's endowment posted slug
gish gains with only a slight yield of
1.3 percent, partly due to the Asian
financial crisis.
The Stanford Management
Company maintained that invest
ments abroad are long-term and
that the emerging markets overseas
have recovered dramatically.
Last year, total gifts to the Uni
versity, including donations from
alumni and all other sources,
reached a new record, totaling
more than $3(X) million, a number
that ranks among the best in the na
tion.
In the past seven years, Stanford
has raised over $2 billion in cash and
pledges, with about a quarter of that
going towards the growth of the en
dowment. Alumni gifts have gone
from $241 million in '95-'% to $312
million in '96-'97 to $319 in '97-"9 K.
Although donations have not in
creased significantly, these overall
totals are second only to alumni do
nations at Harvard.
