# Heightened security raises concerns at SLAC
## 
### Rajat Bhatnagar 
The Department of Energy's man
date that U.S. scientific institutions in
crease security measures as a result of
potential Chinese spying could affect
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
"The Department of Energy has
looked carefully at the roles the labs
play and has tried to craft their securi
ty procedures to match the require
ment of the lab," said Burton Richter,
outgoing director of SLAC.
As SLAC conducts no govern
ment classified work on site, the re
strictions on SLAC have been mini
mal. according to Richter. But some
are concerned about the potentially
negative effects increased security
measures could have on both SLAC
and on other U.S. scientific institu
tions.
Investigations around Lee
Much of the concern over Chinese

spying began
on March 8
when Wen
HoLee,aTai
wan- bo r n
computer sci
entist then
working at the
Los Alamos
nuclear labo
ratory, was
fired for sus-

pected security violations.
The Department of Energy re
vealed that Lee was under investiga
tion since 19% for releasing informa
tion in the 1980s concerning one of
the U.S.'s most sophisticated nuclear
weapons, the W-88. The Department
charged that Lee had moved several
thousand classified nuclear computer
codes from a secure computer system
to an insecure system with access to
the Internet, and that he then may
have disseminated the codes to Chi

ncse officials.
Lee denied spying for China, and
no formal charges were brought for
ward by the Department.
However an internal investigation
is underway in the Department of
Energy to explain why nearly three
years elapsed between the FBI identi
fying Lee as a possible spy and the
Department taking any action.
Security measures around SLAC
In the wake of these revelations of
the insecurity of U.S. scientific institu
tions, government officials are pres
suring scientific organizations to im
prove security measures. As SLAC is
funded by the Department of Energy,
the laboratory is required to abide by
the Department's regulations.
Some SLAC officials disagree
with the Department of Energy's po
sition of increasing regulation. Wolf
gang Panofsky, director emeritus of
SLAC, said that "spying is part of the

international morass of today, and the
United States has by far the largest
budget for spying."
The Department of Energy's most
important security measure affecting
SLAC has been the introduction of
security discussions with SLAC staff
members.
Press Consultant and Assistant to
the Director of SLAC P. A. Moore
said that SLAC is "conducting sensi
tivity sessions for all of the staff to
make them aware of security issues,
export control issues and things of
that nature."
So far, three sessions have been
conducted. The first addressed gener
al security concerns. A legal counsel
led the second presentation on export
control issues, and a SLAC computer
security expert conducted the third
meeting on computer systems.
Three tiers
Moore said that the Department

of Energy "classifies facilities as ei
ther Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 â€” Tier 1
being weapons labs. Tier 2 being labs
that conduct some classified work and
Tier 3 labs like SLAC which do ab
solutely no classified work on site."
Richter stated that since SLAC
falls in the third tier, "we have had no
new regulations that hamstring our
efforts to work on our science and
work with our international collabo
rators."
Richter emphasized that many
"restrictions on our activities are no
different than the restrictions that
have been for many, many years in
the past, so I think they are perfectly
reasonable."
However other institutions face
stricter regulations.
"There's continuous [govern
ment] investigations, one after anoth
er. into the weapons labs, which sends
the message that the labs aren't being


Richter
trusted," Panofsky said. "It clearly
doesn't do the scientific work any
good."
SLAC could be effected by re
strictions on other institutions in the
future, as much of SLAC's scientific
work is done in collaboration be
tween SLAC and Tier 1 labs. Richter
said, in an address to the National
Academies of Science Symposium,
that the "[Department of Energy's]
science labs need to be able to work
with the weapons labs for their mutu
al benefit," and that he worries about
new restrictions which would prohib
it this collaboration.
However Panofsky warned that
"it is too early to tell because the re
strictions on the weapons labs are not
in place; they are still being argued
about."
Restrictions on foreign workers
Another danger, according to
Panofsky, is that restrictions could be
placed on foreign nationals working
in science laboratories.
"We have lots of foreign nationals
in our accelerator division and all
over the place. When there is a design
meeting, we don't know whether or
not we can send one of those fellows
over there without any preliminary
red tape," Panofsky said.
Panofsky believes that in the fu
ture, there will be more bureaucratic
procedures to get foreign nationals
approved for collaboration efforts.
That is why Panofsky believes that
some of "the restrictions at SLAC are
certainly not beneficial and certainly
not necessary."
Restrictions on the dissemination
of information will also be increased.
The Department of Energy has stat
ed that sensitive information, even if
it is not classified, should not be dis
cussed with foreign nationals. Ac
cording to the Export Control laws,
foreign nationals include all foreign
ers, with the exception of those grant
ed residence status in the U.S.
"In the past this provision has
been largely ignored, but recently,
[the Department of Energy] has pro
mulgated these rules but leaves the
people in the dark as to which sub

jects would actually be covered,"
Panofsky said. "As a practical matter,
this would only affect discussion of
very detailed technical matters. Sepa
rately, actual physical exports of such
high technology items, such as high
powered microwave tubes and simi
lar items, are prohibited unless li
censed."
Panofsky said that the Depart
ment of Energy's enforcement of Ex
port Control laws "has a high nui
sance value and little effectiveness."
"In my view, while the govern
ment has a legal basis to justify such
restrictions on information, empha
sizing it is unwise for three reasons,"
Panofsky said.
"It is totally ineffective since in
formation conveyed in any discus
sion in the unrestricted presence of
American and foreign residents can
obviously be transmitted further
abroad.
"It is extremely confusing because
what can or cannot be talked about in
the presence of foreign nationals de
pends on very detailed rules which
are generally inaccessible. [And], en
forcement of export regulations is up
to the Department of Commerce,
and having the Department of Ener
gy promulgate separate rules is inap
propriate."
Richter added in his speech to the
National Academies of Science Sym
posium that "there is considerable
danger that this authority [to declare
information sensitive] will be used
too broadly. Ambiguity creates con
fusion, and the whole notion of sensi
tive, unclassified information is by its
nature ambiguous."
Panofsky said that these types of
restrictions on the flow of scientific
information could hamper scientific
progress.
"There should be a free exchange
of scientific ideas, excepting for those
items which are directly associated
with nuclear weapons design, intelli
gence sources and military
plans.. .but clearly the present net is
being cast much wider," Panofsky
stated.
Richter said in his speech that "sci
ence has lived and advanced by the
free exchange of ideas and people.
Some restrictions are necessary in the
name of national security, but they
should be drawn as narrowly as possi
ble."

spying began
on March 8
when Wen
HoLee,aTai
wan- bo r n
computer sci
entist then
working at the
Los Alamos
nuclear labo
ratory, was
fired for sus-

pected security violations.
The Department of Energy re
vealed that Lee was under investiga
tion since 19% for releasing informa
tion in the 1980s concerning one of
the U.S.'s most sophisticated nuclear
weapons, the W-88. The Department
charged that Lee had moved several
thousand classified nuclear computer
codes from a secure computer system
to an insecure system with access to
the Internet, and that he then may
have disseminated the codes to Chi

ncse officials.
Lee denied spying for China, and
no formal charges were brought for
ward by the Department.
However an internal investigation
is underway in the Department of
Energy to explain why nearly three
years elapsed between the FBI identi
fying Lee as a possible spy and the
Department taking any action.
Security measures around SLAC
In the wake of these revelations of
the insecurity of U.S. scientific institu
tions, government officials are pres
suring scientific organizations to im
prove security measures. As SLAC is
funded by the Department of Energy,
the laboratory is required to abide by
the Department's regulations.
Some SLAC officials disagree
with the Department of Energy's po
sition of increasing regulation. Wolf
gang Panofsky, director emeritus of
SLAC, said that "spying is part of the

international morass of today, and the
United States has by far the largest
budget for spying."
The Department of Energy's most
important security measure affecting
SLAC has been the introduction of
security discussions with SLAC staff
members.
Press Consultant and Assistant to
the Director of SLAC P. A. Moore
said that SLAC is "conducting sensi
tivity sessions for all of the staff to
make them aware of security issues,
export control issues and things of
that nature."
So far, three sessions have been
conducted. The first addressed gener
al security concerns. A legal counsel
led the second presentation on export
control issues, and a SLAC computer
security expert conducted the third
meeting on computer systems.
Three tiers
Moore said that the Department

of Energy "classifies facilities as ei
ther Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 â€” Tier 1
being weapons labs. Tier 2 being labs
that conduct some classified work and
Tier 3 labs like SLAC which do ab
solutely no classified work on site."
Richter stated that since SLAC
falls in the third tier, "we have had no
new regulations that hamstring our
efforts to work on our science and
work with our international collabo
rators."
Richter emphasized that many
"restrictions on our activities are no
different than the restrictions that
have been for many, many years in
the past, so I think they are perfectly
reasonable."
However other institutions face
stricter regulations.
"There's continuous [govern
ment] investigations, one after anoth
er. into the weapons labs, which sends
the message that the labs aren't being


Richter
trusted," Panofsky said. "It clearly
doesn't do the scientific work any
good."
SLAC could be effected by re
strictions on other institutions in the
future, as much of SLAC's scientific
work is done in collaboration be
tween SLAC and Tier 1 labs. Richter
said, in an address to the National
Academies of Science Symposium,
that the "[Department of Energy's]
science labs need to be able to work
with the weapons labs for their mutu
al benefit," and that he worries about
new restrictions which would prohib
it this collaboration.
However Panofsky warned that
"it is too early to tell because the re
strictions on the weapons labs are not
in place; they are still being argued
about."
Restrictions on foreign workers
Another danger, according to
Panofsky, is that restrictions could be
placed on foreign nationals working
in science laboratories.
"We have lots of foreign nationals
in our accelerator division and all
over the place. When there is a design
meeting, we don't know whether or
not we can send one of those fellows
over there without any preliminary
red tape," Panofsky said.
Panofsky believes that in the fu
ture, there will be more bureaucratic
procedures to get foreign nationals
approved for collaboration efforts.
That is why Panofsky believes that
some of "the restrictions at SLAC are
certainly not beneficial and certainly
not necessary."
Restrictions on the dissemination
of information will also be increased.
The Department of Energy has stat
ed that sensitive information, even if
it is not classified, should not be dis
cussed with foreign nationals. Ac
cording to the Export Control laws,
foreign nationals include all foreign
ers, with the exception of those grant
ed residence status in the U.S.
"In the past this provision has
been largely ignored, but recently,
[the Department of Energy] has pro
mulgated these rules but leaves the
people in the dark as to which sub

jects would actually be covered,"
Panofsky said. "As a practical matter,
this would only affect discussion of
very detailed technical matters. Sepa
rately, actual physical exports of such
high technology items, such as high
powered microwave tubes and simi
lar items, are prohibited unless li
censed."
Panofsky said that the Depart
ment of Energy's enforcement of Ex
port Control laws "has a high nui
sance value and little effectiveness."
"In my view, while the govern
ment has a legal basis to justify such
restrictions on information, empha
sizing it is unwise for three reasons,"
Panofsky said.
"It is totally ineffective since in
formation conveyed in any discus
sion in the unrestricted presence of
American and foreign residents can
obviously be transmitted further
abroad.
"It is extremely confusing because
what can or cannot be talked about in
the presence of foreign nationals de
pends on very detailed rules which
are generally inaccessible. [And], en
forcement of export regulations is up
to the Department of Commerce,
and having the Department of Ener
gy promulgate separate rules is inap
propriate."
Richter added in his speech to the
National Academies of Science Sym
posium that "there is considerable
danger that this authority [to declare
information sensitive] will be used
too broadly. Ambiguity creates con
fusion, and the whole notion of sensi
tive, unclassified information is by its
nature ambiguous."
Panofsky said that these types of
restrictions on the flow of scientific
information could hamper scientific
progress.
"There should be a free exchange
of scientific ideas, excepting for those
items which are directly associated
with nuclear weapons design, intelli
gence sources and military
plans.. .but clearly the present net is
being cast much wider," Panofsky
stated.
Richter said in his speech that "sci
ence has lived and advanced by the
free exchange of ideas and people.
Some restrictions are necessary in the
name of national security, but they
should be drawn as narrowly as possi
ble."
