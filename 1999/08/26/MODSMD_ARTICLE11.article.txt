# Heightened security raises concerns at SLAC

The Department of Energy's man
date that U.S. scientific institutions in
crease security measures as a result of
potential Chinese spying could affect
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
"The Department of Energy has
looked carefully at the roles the labs
play and has tried to craft their securi
ty procedures to match the require
ment of the lab," said Burton Richter,
outgoing director of SLAC.
As SLAC conducts no govern
ment classified work on site, the re
strictions on SLAC have been mini
mal. according to Richter. But some
are concerned about the potentially
negative effects increased security
measures could have on both SLAC
and on other U.S. scientific institu
tions.
Investigations around Lee
Much of the concern over Chinese

spying began
on March 8
when Wen
HoLee,aTai
wan- bo r n
computer sci
entist then
working at the
Los Alamos
nuclear labo
ratory, was
fired for sus-

pected security violations.
The Department of Energy re
vealed that Lee was under investiga
tion since 19% for releasing informa
tion in the 1980s concerning one of
the U.S.'s most sophisticated nuclear
weapons, the W-88. The Department
charged that Lee had moved several
thousand classified nuclear computer
codes from a secure computer system
to an insecure system with access to
the Internet, and that he then may
have disseminated the codes to Chi

ncse officials.
Lee denied spying for China, and
no formal charges were brought for
ward by the Department.
However an internal investigation
is underway in the Department of
Energy to explain why nearly three
years elapsed between the FBI identi
fying Lee as a possible spy and the
Department taking any action.
Security measures around SLAC
In the wake of these revelations of
the insecurity of U.S. scientific institu
tions, government officials are pres
suring scientific organizations to im
prove security measures. As SLAC is
funded by the Department of Energy,
the laboratory is required to abide by
the Department's regulations.
Some SLAC officials disagree
with the Department of Energy's po
sition of increasing regulation. Wolf
gang Panofsky, director emeritus of
SLAC, said that "spying is part of the

international morass of today, and the
United States has by far the largest
budget for spying."
The Department of Energy's most
important security measure affecting
SLAC has been the introduction of
security discussions with SLAC staff
members.
Press Consultant and Assistant to
the Director of SLAC P. A. Moore
said that SLAC is "conducting sensi
tivity sessions for all of the staff to
make them aware of security issues,
export control issues and things of
that nature."
So far, three sessions have been
conducted. The first addressed gener
al security concerns. A legal counsel
led the second presentation on export
control issues, and a SLAC computer
security expert conducted the third
meeting on computer systems.
Three tiers
Moore said that the Department

of Energy "classifies facilities as ei
ther Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 â€” Tier 1
being weapons labs. Tier 2 being labs
that conduct some classified work and
Tier 3 labs like SLAC which do ab
solutely no classified work on site."
Richter stated that since SLAC
falls in the third tier, "we have had no
new regulations that hamstring our
efforts to work on our science and
work with our international collabo
rators."
Richter emphasized that many
"restrictions on our activities are no
different than the restrictions that
have been for many, many years in
the past, so I think they are perfectly
reasonable."
However other institutions face
stricter regulations.
"There's continuous [govern
ment] investigations, one after anoth
er. into the weapons labs, which sends
the message that the labs aren't being
