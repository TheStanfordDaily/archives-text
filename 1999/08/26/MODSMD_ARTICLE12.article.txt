# Startup home to Stanford students

Editor's Note: This is the third article in a series covering
the progress of recent startups by Stanford students.
Two Stanford alumni have made building a website as
easy as clicking a mouse.
Justin Kitch, Class of 1994, and Thai Bui, Class of
19%, are the founders of Homestead, Inc. Homestead is
a free online service that allows users to make their own
websites. All that is needed is a web browser to get to
www.homestead.com.
The site contains a palette of "elements," which in
clude text and graphics, clip art, chat rooms and anima
tion. Users don't have to install special software or learn
any programming languages — they can just drag and
drop the elements they want into their own personal
site.
When all the elements are in place, Homestead tech
nology automatically converts the site into standard
HTML. The site is hosted at Homestead.com and is
available from anywhere in the world. After the website
is built, the publishing process only takes a few seconds.
The palette of elements is "ever-expanding" said Bui,
who co-founded Homestead while he was still an under
graduate. It is also possible to download images from
outside of Homestead into the website, password protect
the site so that only select people have access and invite
others to contribute to the site.
Different advertisers sponsor the elements, which is
how Homestead is able to make the service free to its
users. Kitch sees Homestead as a way to allow people to
collaborate over the Internet without having to learn the
technical programming side of programming.
Kitch emphasized the community aspect of Home
stead as a difference between Homestead and other web
hosting sites.
"Other services only allow people to make home
pages static sites with biographical information and a few
links. We allow people to develop online communities —
sites where people can actively collaborate," Kitch said.
"Groups can work together over the Internet — a club,
for example, can build a site, and the members of the club
can collaborate over the Web to add to the site and tailor
it for their specific needs."
Members of the Homestead community include
artists displaying their work, families looking for distant
relatives and individuals organizing high school re
unions.
Homestead has received praise from its users and was
awarded both the Investor's Choice and the People's
Choice awards at Upside Media's Internet Showcase in
January of 1998.
Homestead is actually Kitch's second company. After
graduating with a bachelor's degree in Science Technol
ogy and Society and a coterminal master's degree in com
puter science, Kitch founded an educational software
company called Kartoffelsoft (which means potato in
German) with his friend, Matt Harad.

The atmosphere of Homestead's headquarters re
flects Kitch's origins in educational software for children.
The stairs, doorways and banisters are painted in bright,
primary colors. Beanbags in those same bright colors are
piled strategically on the ground floor of the building —
rumor has it that they make an excellent cushion for peo
ple catapulting off the second floor banister.
Conference rooms that otherwise look very re
spectable are named after dances — over the door of one
is the title, "Cha Cha," and another is called "Tango."
And every other Thursday, the development team
dresses up according to a previously agreed theme. A
couple of weeks ago, it was superhero day and members
of the development team were running around the office
in spandex, masks and brightly colored capes.
Bui acknowledged that the atmosphere at Homestead
can seem loose. r
"We like to keep things purposefully flexible," said
Bui. "This industry has a very quick pace, and we need to
make sure that we can develop products and designate
resources to have as quick of a turnaround as possible."
The Homestead offices may be decorated in the col
ors of a kindergarten classroom, but the growth of this
company has been anything but child-like.
Since it was founded two years ago, Homestead has
expanded to 95 employees, "and we are still growing,"
Kitch said. In fact, their offices are so crowded that desks
have been placed along almost every inch of available
wall space — even hallways and storage closets have
been appropriated. The company plans to move into a
new building as soon as it is completed.
Although such close quarters could conceivably cause
tension in a workplace, the spirit at the Homestead of
fices is very congenial, according to its founders.
Kitch and Bui set a tone of playful informality, and
employees can be heard teasing each other about things
ranging from undergraduate institutions to desk decora
tions (a model of the chess set from Star Trek the Next
Generation sits on one desk, while a plastic rhinoceros
wearing a birthday hat can be seen on another).
Despite their informality, it is obvious that these em
ployees are devoted to their work. Visitors are greeted
with a friendly smile, but attention quickly returns to the
computer screen.
"The atmosphere around here can be a little weird,"
said Bui, "We're at work, but we work with our friends,
so it all kind of blends home and office."
The camaraderie and playfulness that the employees
of Homestead exhibit may be due in part to the youth
fulness of the company — the average age of a Home
stead employee is 26.
"Age doesn't really count for much in this business,
because everything is so new. We have the most experi
ence in this work, even though we're young and the com
pany itself is only two years old," said Kitch.
A large number of the employees of Homestead are
Stanford graduates, and Kitch. He said that Homestead
recruits heavily from Stanford, especially for its develop
ment team. Homestead also offers internships to Stan
ford students.
