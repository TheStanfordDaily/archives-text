## S2K: Stanford football looks to build on talent and experience in '99 
### Ricky Opaterny Contributing writer 
After a 1998 season defined by a
mid-season slump and many near
misses, including a heartbreaking loss
to then No. 1 UCLA, the Stanford
football team enters the 1999 season
with the goal of playing consistently
throughout the season.
With the start of training camp on
Aug. 14 and the team's Sept. 4 season
opener at Texas quickly approaching,
Stanford has begun to address the
problems that plagued the team a
year ago.

Strength at quarterback
Playing from behind last season
put an immense burden on the pass
ing game and on senior quarterback
Todd Husak. Husak responded
impressively throwing for 3,092 yards,
becoming the third Stanford passer
ever to reach the 3,(XX) yard mark in
one season. Husak enters the season
as the team's top quarterback , sup
ported by juniors Randy Fasani and
Joe Borchard, as well as freshman
Chris Lewis.
Borchard and Fasani both proved
to be valuable assets last year.
Borchard orchestrated Stanford's

winning drive in the final minute of
the team's 37-34 defeat of North
Carolina last September. Fasani, who
was used primarily in goal-line situa
tions in 1998, has shown impressive
mobility in training camp and should
see more time behind center this year.
Lewis, the Gatorade High School
Player of the Year, will likely redshirt
this season, though no definite
announcement has been made yet.
Commenting on his group of back
up quarterbacks, head coach Tyrone
Willingham said. "Our basic thought
process for camp is just trying to iden
tify where they're at, try to bring them
as far along as we can for the total
offense and not work towards ... any
perceived strengths."
Along with the quarterbacks,
Stanford returns an impressive core
of wide receivers. Senior Troy Walters
is back for his final season after play
ing in only six full games last season.
Walters, the school's all-time leader in
receiving yards, will be the focus of
opponents' defenses throughout the
season.
Fortunately, Stanford also has for
midable threats in senior De√üonnie
Pitts and junior Dave Davis. Pitts
established himself as a go-to receiver
last year with Walters in and out of
the lineup. He finished the season
with 74 catches for over 1,000 yards.
Also fitting into the air attack will be
senior tight end Russell Stewart who
provides a large target in the middle
of the field for Husak.
There are undoubtedly high expec
tations for the passing game, which
will basically have the same make-up
as last year.
Willingham said, "the strength [is]
the number of guys that have played
coming back. Naturally I think with
the experience that we've gained at
quarterback, that might be a good
group. We're going to see when we get
into actually playing the game [if] our
receivers as good as they've been
billed to be."
Rounding out the offensive line
With Stanford forced into passing
situations all too often last season, the
running game was never able to
emerge. Junior Coy Wire developed
into Stanford's top running back last
year before going down with a dislo
cated thumb that forced him out of
the final five games. Wire should be
ready for the Texas game, despite
recently suffering a thigh contusion
that has been keeping him out of
practice. Joining him in the backfield
will be senior fullback Emory Brock.

In addition to Wire and returning
running backs Juan-Carlos Lacey,
Brian Allen and Eddie Gayles, the
Cardinal will add freshman Kerry
Carter to the mix. Although he played
in only one game last season. Carter
was one of the top recruits in the
country. In Carter and defensive end
Louis Hobson, Stanford signed its
first two recruits ever from Canada.
Carter attracted attention after
rushing for 2,3(X) yards in a Canadian
summer-league season. At 6'2" and
225 pounds. Carter should provide the

Cardinal with an effective backup
running back. During training camp,
Carter has displayed impressive
hands and can give Stanford another
offensive weapon, catching passes out
of the backfield.
The offensive line is anchored by
seniors Mike McLaughlin at center and
Jeff Cronshagen at left tackle. The
experienced line, which also includes
junior Zack Quaccia and sophomore
Eric Heitmann, should help set up an
improved ground game for the
Cardinal. A strong running attack will
be necessary to balance the developed
passing attack and to avoid placing
pressure on Husak to throw the ball
virtually every down as he did last year.
Working with the line this year will
be new offensive line coach Tom
Brattan, who joins the Cardinal after

spending the last seven years on the
Northwestern coaching staff.
Brattan's lines helped lead the
Wildcats to ranked finishes in both
the 1995 and 1996 seasons, including a
Rose Bowl appearance in 1995, when
their offense was one of the best in
the nation.
The Cardinal suffered a great loss
on special teams with the graduation
of punter and place kicker Kevin
Miller. Junior Mike Biselli will assume
the place-kicking job after serving on
kickoffs last season. He has yet to to

attempt a field goal or PAT in a game
situation. Biselli will certainly be test
ed early in the season and his ability
to make key field goals will play a sig
nificant role in close games.
Junior Sean Tolpinrud will handle
the punting duties, despite not having
seen any actual game action in two
years with Stanford. In his attempt to
fill Miller's void, Tolpinrud will have
to be effective if the Cardinal are to
have a chance at containing the oppo
sition this season.
The defensive line
On the defensive side of the foot
ball, Stanford will have to limit their
opponents' scoring this season to
keep the offensive unit in the game
after giving up an average of 33.2

points per game in the 1998 season.
Willingham emphasized stopping the
run this season as opponents out
gained the Cardinal on the ground by
more than a two to one ratio.
Up front, all four starting defensive
linemen will return from one year
ago, although senior defensive end
Riall Johnson has been moved to out
side linebacker and will be replaced
by junior Austin Lee. The line will be
led by senior tackle Willie Howard,
who appears to have improved upon
the excellent quickness and pursuit

ability that he displayed last season.
Howard's continued emergence and
the experience of the line should put
pressure on the opposition to throw
the ball quickly, while containing the
run.
In the secondary, Stanford returns
players at every position, including
strong safety junior Tim Smith. Smith
moves to that position from free safe
ty, where he played last year, as part of
a completely revamped secondary
under new defensive backfield coach
Denny Schuler.
Schuler arrives on the Farm with
27 years of college coaching experi
ence, after spending last season with a
Northern lowa team that ranked 17th
defensively among all Division 1-AA
colleges.
One cornerback position will be

tilled by senior Chris Johnson, a
returning starter. It looks as though
senior cornerback Frank Primus and
sophomore free safety Tank Williams
will join Smith and Johnson in the
backfield.
Smith will be the leader of the sec
ondary which began to play well dur
ing the second half of last season. He
recorded 109 tackles last year, while
leading the Pacific-10 Conference
interceptions with six. However Smith
has been limited in training camp
after undergoing minor surgery on his
left knee last month. He is practicing
lightly with a brace on his knee in one
of the two daily practices.
Consequently, the new secondary
may not become accustomed to play
ing together until after the season
actually starts.
When asked if Smith would be at
full strength for the Texas game,
Willingham said, "Well, that you
never know ... we think to the best of
his abilities, yes, [Smith will be ready
for Texas]."
Going up against Texas
While Stanford continues workouts
in preparation for its opening game
against the Longhorns, Texas will have
already played one regular season
game going into the match-up with the
Cardinal. Texas will open their season
at home on Aug. 28 against North
Carolina State. That early opening
game, along with the Longhorns' extra
week of practice, appear to give them a
distinct advantage.
Willingham addressed the Texas
edge, saying, "When you play your
second game is when you show the
most improvement... [in] the second
game, they have a better feel for the
rhythm, level of blocks and the inten
sity of the game, so it is a clear advan
tage for them."
Despite losing running back and
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky
Williams to graduation, the
Longhorns are ranked No. 18 in the
AP's preseason poll.
Quarterback Major Applewhite
returns to lead the team after an out
standing freshman season in 1998, and
he is sure to test the re-organized
Stanford secondary.
Including the Longhorns, Stanford
will play three teams currently ranked
in the top 25 in their first four games,
with match ups at No. 4 Arizona on
Sept. 18 and at home against No. 16
UCLA on Sept. 25. Other ranked
opponents this season will include
USC, Arizona State and Notre Dame.
Instead of ending the season with Big

Game against rival Cal, the Cardinal
will play the Bears at Stanford
Stadium on Nov. 20. before closing
out the regular season the next week
end with a home game against the
Irish on Nov. 27.
These match-ups will allow the
Cardinal to see how they compare
with some of the top teams in the
country. This will provide invaluable
experience, as Stanford will be able to
evaluate and solidify their lineups on
both sides of the football.
With the Cardinal picked to finish
eighth in the Pac-10, such a difficult
early-season schedule could end up
being disastrous, but it will also provide
the opportunity for the Cardinal to
prove that they have improved upon
last year's inconsistency. However vic
tories early in the season against their
tough opposition could easily propel
Stanford into the national rankings.
Echoing the belief that Stanford
could gain nationally ranked status this
season, Willingham stated his goal for
the 1999 season.
"I think there's is a long-term goal
... we want to be in a major bowl when
the season is over," he said. "I think we
want to be one of those teams that,
hopefully, is in the Rose Bowl, but if
not there, then in one of the major
bowls [offered to the Pac-10]."

These match-ups will allow the
Cardinal to see how they compare
with some of the top teams in the
country. This will provide invaluable
experience, as Stanford will be able to
evaluate and solidify their lineups on
both sides of the football.
With the Cardinal picked to finish
eighth in the Pac-10, such a difficult
early-season schedule could end up
being disastrous, but it will also provide
the opportunity for the Cardinal to
prove that they have improved upon
last year's inconsistency. However vic
tories early in the season against their
tough opposition could easily propel
Stanford into the national rankings.
Echoing the belief that Stanford
could gain nationally ranked status this
season, Willingham stated his goal for
the 1999 season.
"I think there's is a long-term goal
... we want to be in a major bowl when
the season is over," he said. "I think we
want to be one of those teams that,
hopefully, is in the Rose Bowl, but if
not there, then in one of the major
bowls [offered to the Pac-10]."

Senior Todd Husak returns at quarterback for the Cardinal.
After a 1998 season defined by a
mid-season slump and many near
misses, including a heartbreaking loss
to then No. 1 UCLA, the Stanford
football team enters the 1999 season
with the goal of playing consistently
throughout the season.
With the start of training camp on
Aug. 14 and the team's Sept. 4 season
opener at Texas quickly approaching,
Stanford has begun to address the
problems that plagued the team a
year ago.

Strength at quarterback
Playing from behind last season
put an immense burden on the pass
ing game and on senior quarterback
Todd Husak. Husak responded
impressively throwing for 3,092 yards,
becoming the third Stanford passer
ever to reach the 3,(XX) yard mark in
one season. Husak enters the season
as the team's top quarterback , sup
ported by juniors Randy Fasani and
Joe Borchard, as well as freshman
Chris Lewis.
Borchard and Fasani both proved
to be valuable assets last year.
Borchard orchestrated Stanford's

winning drive in the final minute of
the team's 37-34 defeat of North
Carolina last September. Fasani, who
was used primarily in goal-line situa
tions in 1998, has shown impressive
mobility in training camp and should
see more time behind center this year.
Lewis, the Gatorade High School
Player of the Year, will likely redshirt
this season, though no definite
announcement has been made yet.
Commenting on his group of back
up quarterbacks, head coach Tyrone
Willingham said. "Our basic thought
process for camp is just trying to iden
tify where they're at, try to bring them
as far along as we can for the total
offense and not work towards ... any
perceived strengths."
Along with the quarterbacks,
Stanford returns an impressive core
of wide receivers. Senior Troy Walters
is back for his final season after play
ing in only six full games last season.
Walters, the school's all-time leader in
receiving yards, will be the focus of
opponents' defenses throughout the
season.
Fortunately, Stanford also has for
midable threats in senior De√üonnie
Pitts and junior Dave Davis. Pitts
established himself as a go-to receiver
last year with Walters in and out of
the lineup. He finished the season
with 74 catches for over 1,000 yards.
Also fitting into the air attack will be
senior tight end Russell Stewart who
provides a large target in the middle
of the field for Husak.
There are undoubtedly high expec
tations for the passing game, which
will basically have the same make-up
as last year.
Willingham said, "the strength [is]
the number of guys that have played
coming back. Naturally I think with
the experience that we've gained at
quarterback, that might be a good
group. We're going to see when we get
into actually playing the game [if] our
receivers as good as they've been
billed to be."
Rounding out the offensive line
With Stanford forced into passing
situations all too often last season, the
running game was never able to
emerge. Junior Coy Wire developed
into Stanford's top running back last
year before going down with a dislo
cated thumb that forced him out of
the final five games. Wire should be
ready for the Texas game, despite
recently suffering a thigh contusion
that has been keeping him out of
practice. Joining him in the backfield
will be senior fullback Emory Brock.

In addition to Wire and returning
running backs Juan-Carlos Lacey,
Brian Allen and Eddie Gayles, the
Cardinal will add freshman Kerry
Carter to the mix. Although he played
in only one game last season. Carter
was one of the top recruits in the
country. In Carter and defensive end
Louis Hobson, Stanford signed its
first two recruits ever from Canada.
Carter attracted attention after
rushing for 2,3(X) yards in a Canadian
summer-league season. At 6'2" and
225 pounds. Carter should provide the

Cardinal with an effective backup
running back. During training camp,
Carter has displayed impressive
hands and can give Stanford another
offensive weapon, catching passes out
of the backfield.
The offensive line is anchored by
seniors Mike McLaughlin at center and
Jeff Cronshagen at left tackle. The
experienced line, which also includes
junior Zack Quaccia and sophomore
Eric Heitmann, should help set up an
improved ground game for the
Cardinal. A strong running attack will
be necessary to balance the developed
passing attack and to avoid placing
pressure on Husak to throw the ball
virtually every down as he did last year.
Working with the line this year will
be new offensive line coach Tom
Brattan, who joins the Cardinal after

spending the last seven years on the
Northwestern coaching staff.
Brattan's lines helped lead the
Wildcats to ranked finishes in both
the 1995 and 1996 seasons, including a
Rose Bowl appearance in 1995, when
their offense was one of the best in
the nation.
The Cardinal suffered a great loss
on special teams with the graduation
of punter and place kicker Kevin
Miller. Junior Mike Biselli will assume
the place-kicking job after serving on
kickoffs last season. He has yet to to

attempt a field goal or PAT in a game
situation. Biselli will certainly be test
ed early in the season and his ability
to make key field goals will play a sig
nificant role in close games.
Junior Sean Tolpinrud will handle
the punting duties, despite not having
seen any actual game action in two
years with Stanford. In his attempt to
fill Miller's void, Tolpinrud will have
to be effective if the Cardinal are to
have a chance at containing the oppo
sition this season.
The defensive line
On the defensive side of the foot
ball, Stanford will have to limit their
opponents' scoring this season to
keep the offensive unit in the game
after giving up an average of 33.2

points per game in the 1998 season.
Willingham emphasized stopping the
run this season as opponents out
gained the Cardinal on the ground by
more than a two to one ratio.
Up front, all four starting defensive
linemen will return from one year
ago, although senior defensive end
Riall Johnson has been moved to out
side linebacker and will be replaced
by junior Austin Lee. The line will be
led by senior tackle Willie Howard,
who appears to have improved upon
the excellent quickness and pursuit

ability that he displayed last season.
Howard's continued emergence and
the experience of the line should put
pressure on the opposition to throw
the ball quickly, while containing the
run.
In the secondary, Stanford returns
players at every position, including
strong safety junior Tim Smith. Smith
moves to that position from free safe
ty, where he played last year, as part of
a completely revamped secondary
under new defensive backfield coach
Denny Schuler.
Schuler arrives on the Farm with
27 years of college coaching experi
ence, after spending last season with a
Northern lowa team that ranked 17th
defensively among all Division 1-AA
colleges.
One cornerback position will be

tilled by senior Chris Johnson, a
returning starter. It looks as though
senior cornerback Frank Primus and
sophomore free safety Tank Williams
will join Smith and Johnson in the
backfield.
Smith will be the leader of the sec
ondary which began to play well dur
ing the second half of last season. He
recorded 109 tackles last year, while
leading the Pacific-10 Conference
interceptions with six. However Smith
has been limited in training camp
after undergoing minor surgery on his
left knee last month. He is practicing
lightly with a brace on his knee in one
of the two daily practices.
Consequently, the new secondary
may not become accustomed to play
ing together until after the season
actually starts.
When asked if Smith would be at
full strength for the Texas game,
Willingham said, "Well, that you
never know ... we think to the best of
his abilities, yes, [Smith will be ready
for Texas]."
Going up against Texas
While Stanford continues workouts
in preparation for its opening game
against the Longhorns, Texas will have
already played one regular season
game going into the match-up with the
Cardinal. Texas will open their season
at home on Aug. 28 against North
Carolina State. That early opening
game, along with the Longhorns' extra
week of practice, appear to give them a
distinct advantage.
Willingham addressed the Texas
edge, saying, "When you play your
second game is when you show the
most improvement... [in] the second
game, they have a better feel for the
rhythm, level of blocks and the inten
sity of the game, so it is a clear advan
tage for them."
Despite losing running back and
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky
Williams to graduation, the
Longhorns are ranked No. 18 in the
AP's preseason poll.
Quarterback Major Applewhite
returns to lead the team after an out
standing freshman season in 1998, and
he is sure to test the re-organized
Stanford secondary.
Including the Longhorns, Stanford
will play three teams currently ranked
in the top 25 in their first four games,
with match ups at No. 4 Arizona on
Sept. 18 and at home against No. 16
UCLA on Sept. 25. Other ranked
opponents this season will include
USC, Arizona State and Notre Dame.
Instead of ending the season with Big

Game against rival Cal, the Cardinal
will play the Bears at Stanford
Stadium on Nov. 20. before closing
out the regular season the next week
end with a home game against the
Irish on Nov. 27.
These match-ups will allow the
Cardinal to see how they compare
with some of the top teams in the
country. This will provide invaluable
experience, as Stanford will be able to
evaluate and solidify their lineups on
both sides of the football.
