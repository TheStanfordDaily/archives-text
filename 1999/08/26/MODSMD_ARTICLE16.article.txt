## Bonfire Madigan burns bright The 						Weekly talks with the dynamic, San Francisco band 
### Rebecca Gould 
If you haven't yet stumbled across San Fransico-based
Bonfire Madigan's soothing cello and lullabic vocals, sprin
kled with gut-hatched wailing, you are starving your soul of
the most nourishing elixir the contemporary music scene has
to offer.
Twenty-four-year-old Madigan Shive, a cellist with a mes
merizing, dynamic voice and a theatrical and hypnotic stage
presence teams up with contrabassist Sheri Ozeki and per
cussionist Tomas to create a sound which is emotionally and
lyrically provocative.
Their first full length album, "From the Burnpile," was re
leased by Kill Rock Stars in 1998. Bonfire Madigan blends
their unique sounds with various multimedia performers —
DJs, film clips and even trapeze artists. The band is currently
working on their new album, "Saddling the Bridge," which
will be released this October.
Weekly: As an artist, how do you describe yourself?
Madigan: I think what we're doing is something like creat
ing scenes of sound-scaped songs — new radio poetry for the
commute, the club, the study, the bedroom, the film, the rally,
the recital, the turntable, the coming century. I'm really in
terested in the way contemporary music hears the string sec
tion, rhythm and the female voice.
Tomas: Cello, contrabass and small drums magnifying the
emotional dust of dream states.
Weekly: How did you first get involved in music and when?
M: Music has always been very important to me. My fa
vorite thing to do as a young child was sit next to my Uncle
Philip at the piano and sing. I started my first band around the
same time, organizing the kids on my block to hit Tupperware
or strum my little half size guitar simultaneously. We were
called the 12th Street Band. By the time I was in my teens, I
was writing songs with friends in high school. The most re

warding thing was to haul the cello out to the ocean with my
pal KC and compose with the tide as our living and breathing
metronome. It keeps perfect lunar time. Singing with a sunset
and seagulls creates the most unbelievable kind of three part
harmony.
Weekly: How, if at all, has identifying as queer affected
your artwork?
M: I feel that in general, overly creative types tend to be
queer people, or at least feel no inhibition in expressing a
need to show society that queer relationships are as natural,
valid and important to cultures as say inter-racial, inter-reli
gious, inter-generational or inter-class relations are. Ac
knowledging my queerness publicly has affected my work as
much as openly and artistically recognizing my sex, race, class
background, etc.
Weekly: Give us a few words about the other BM band
members.
M: Sheri and Tomas have become simply invaluable to me.
It's the most unearthly thing to have people willing to write a
new language with you and sing it back to strangers while
you're developing a new vocabulary every moment. That's
what musical collaborating is like. The fire is to me what plas
tic might have been to Yoko. They fuel the bonfire in this
Bonfire Madigan band!
T: Sheri's an amazing producer and bass player, a natural
musician with a wealth of creativity and a passion for fine roll
up tobacco. I spin records to stay sane and write letters and
poems on a Sterling Corona manual typewriter.
Weekly: What is the connection between you and your lis
tener?
T: When I play, it's an experience within and "of the
music." Music is actually comprised of the performer and the
audience so we're playing with each other in unison.
M: There are times though when I sing or play cello for my
self alone and it is a real catharsis and actually the best time

for writing, but you learn everything about what you're trying
to express by sharing it with someone else.
Weekly: What's the deal with your new album?
T: I'll let Madigan explain.
M: There are two main compositional pillars that I loosely
call minimalistic symphonic trilogies, which are the album's
conceptual anchors. But I think it can be summed up in a Bini
proverb I recently came across which says "rivers ever remain
small that do not stretch their fingers to the sea." I also see
this next record as a bridge to the next one which has, for
years, been more than half written. This would be the secret
and infamous, (at least in mine and my cohorts' minds),
"Covert Constellations."
Weekly: Where are you all planning to go from here?
M: I want to tour again in Europe in the spring with the
new album as a trio. I love touring — bringing the music to
converse with people. So there should be plenty of that in the
future — including West Coast dates in late October.
T: We'll go where the Song will take us. Perhaps do some
electronic-melancholic freeforms next. Dark blue indigo
music.
M: Oh yes.
