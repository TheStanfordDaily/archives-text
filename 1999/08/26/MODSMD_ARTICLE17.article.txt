# Save the universe from evil aliens in 'Quake II'
## N64 version of the original computer game shakes it up with multi-player fun 
### Alex Teekell 
Join the Space Marines, see
strange new worlds, meet interesting
alien peoples and kill them. Thus is
the foundation of "Quake II"for the
N64, the sequel to the popular com
puter game "Quake."
You are a Special Operations
Space Marine as you navigate
through 15 new levels against alien
Strogg on a "reconnaissance" mis
sion. Your objectives are to infiltrate,

destroy and survive.
"Quake II" offers the typical shoot
em up action that has become so pop
ular with the advent of games like
"Doom" and it contains similar
weaponry (both were produced by ID
software and have guns with the title
of BFG). But the saving grace of
"Quake II" is truly the hours of fun
(read: trash talking) provided by the
multi-player option for the game.
The multi-player option allows up
to four players to play against each

other in multiple formats, from death
match and frag teams to flag wars and
deathtag. The single player option is
fun but fairly standard. The multi
player option is great with a group of
friends, but nothing that is incredibly
different from other multi-player ac
tion games.
To aid you in your mission, numer
ous power-ups are available through
out each of the levels, including nine
different weapons, various types of
armor, silencers, power amplifiers

and highly sought after invulnerabili
ty. You'll need all of them to success
fully fight the 12 kinds of Strogg foes
you will encounter, each with their
own weapons and patterns of attack,
ranging from easy to hard to defeat.
Various passwords also exist to un
lock special options for the game in
single and multi-player modes.
The textures of the different envi
ronments are detailed, as are the indi
vidual characters, but the graphics for
"Quake II" are not up to par with

their PC counterparts.
Play control combines both the
joystick and the directional C buttons
to look and move with, of course, the
other buttons being used for weapon
selection and firing. A nice feature is
that games can be either saved for
those with data cartridges and pages
to spare or continued from passwords
for those without.
