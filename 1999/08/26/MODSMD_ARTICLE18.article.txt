# Editor's Farewell
## Taking a look back 
### 
Nine issues and two months later, it's official. I can say
with full confidence that after editing this summer's Week
ly, I've been "sucked in," as the Daily-ites like to call it —
code for unsuspecting Daily writers and editors who un
wittingly become hooked to the day-to-day workings of
writing and editing the Stanford newspaper.
I didn't plan this, of course. When I agreed to be a news
editor last volume and the editor this summer, I assumed
my life would remain fairly ordinary. There was a time
when I actually did live in my dorm room instead of the
Daily's newsroom. I feasted on Wilbur food instead of the
Polio's across the Daily office. I went to bed around mid
night, instead of my customary 2 a.m. under the Daily's
deadline-filled schedule.
But don't get me wrong — I'm not complaining. The
key factor in this whole business is that I like it. There's
some type of strange force that keeps me coming back into
the newsroom, writing articles and editing the night away,
all the while liking every bit of it. I can't really explain it —
all I know is that it's happened to many others, and now it's
happened to me.
Looking back on my past two years at the Daily, I can
definitely say this summer has been one of the most differ
ent experiences I've had so far. It's a bit disconcerting
knowing you're responsible for everything in the paper. I

ran to the news stands after the first issue of the Weekly
came out, fearing an obvious error plastered on the cover
or in main headlines. But after a while, this anxiety has less
ened as the Weekly has continually brought with it new re
wards and challenges.
I've found this summer that the best part of an editor's
job is learning from the people you work with, as the whole
staff gets to know the paper (along with the AP style guide)
a little bit better. Working with a talented staff this summer
has made me a stronger writer and editor — invaluable
lessons I couldn't have learned any other way.
And in reading and editing the news, sports and enter
tainment sections this summer, I've become more attuned
to the University's administration and their policies, to
Stanford athletes who continue to out-perform, and to the
films and music that have raised up a stir this summer.
As I return this fall to a different position as news man
aging editor, I do so knowing that this summer has
changed the way I read through a story or examine the lay
out of a page. I'm hoping I can bring what I've gained this
summer to the job and in the process, to learn more from
a different set of people.
So, here's to a volume more of living at the Daily, eat
ing at Polio's and sleeping at dawn. I know that I'm going
to love every minute of it.
