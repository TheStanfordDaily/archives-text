## Staff prepares for Class of 2003 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
1,753 freshman and 21 transfer
students will be arriving at Stanford
for new student orientation on Sept.
17.
The orientation staff has been at
work with preparations for this event
since this past spring quarter. Six stu
dents, led by Head Orientation Coor
dinator Sarah Chandler, are working
full time through the summer to orga
nize the five-day event.
"This year we had a special chal
lenge," said Chandler. "We had to ac
count for Yom Kippur, which falls on
the Sunday of orientation (Sept. 19)."
To give students the choice to ob
serve Yom Kippur while attending
orientation, the staff made several
schedule changes, moving more
mandatory events to earlier days and
allowing for more optional activities
on Sept. 19 and Sept. 20.
"Since Yom Kippur is a solemn
time for reflection, some events are
just not appropriate," said Chandler.
In addition to schedule changes,
the staff has also changed part of the
academic advising program. Rather
than presenting the program in
Memorial Auditorium, students will
remain with their advisors after din
ner and listen to a presentation in
their dorm.
"Students often comment that
they need more time in the resi
dences," stated Chandler. "They are
often tired on the first night, and we
lose people in transition between din
ner and the presentation."
Another addition to orientation
this year is the parent lounge, where
parents can rest and interact with
other parents during the first day of
orientation in the lounge in Tresidder
Union.
"In evaluations, parents often say
that they liked talking to other par
ents at orientation," Chandler said.
"This is a place where they can go if
they get overwhelmed."
Chandler said that the staff is try

ing to make orientation less over
whelming this year by making these
changes to the program.
"Everyday we field phone calls
from parents and students, trying to
assure them that they will be safe and
happy at Stanford," she said. "It's a
very personalized job."
A few days before the freshmen
arrive, orientation volunteers will ar
rive on campus to begin preparations.

An Le, a junior who volunteered
during orientation last year, will be
volunteering as a Head Orientation
Volunteer this year.
"The point of my job is the keep
the orientation volunteers motivat
ed," Le said. "The volunteers have
fun themselves; they get to know one
another while they're helping out the
incoming frosh. It's a good program
either way you look at it."
