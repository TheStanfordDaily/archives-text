# University takes thorough measures against Y2K bug
##

Many people expect explosions,
computer crashes, delays and black
outs as the calendar hits the ominous
day of Jan. 1, 2(XX). At Stanford,
though, students will be able to con
tinue to check their e-mail and regis
ter for classes on schedule, according
to Stanford officials.
Most facilities on campus are at
the final stage of testing local critical
systems, according to the Stanford
edition of Y2K News, an electronic
newsletter about campus-specific
Y2K readiness efforts and methods
that major industries are using to
deal with the bug.
"We're rolling ahead and right on
schedule," said Jerry Weitz, Director
of Information Systems Architec
ture. "We should be prepared for the
new millennium well before it ar
rives."
As a result, administrators expect
no delays in beginning winter quarter
next year. Undergraduate residences
will open as scheduled on Sunday,
Jan. 2, and classes will begin on Tues
day, Jan. 4, said outgoing Provost
Condoleezza Rice in a June letter to
students, faculty and staff.
While the last critical systems
should be ready by the end of Sep
tember, % percent of all central busi
ness systems, including SNAP (pay
roll), NSI (student information sys
tem) and CHRIS (human re
sources), have already been evaluat
ed, fixed and tested for Y2K related
issues, according to the newsletter.
Checking central systems for Y2K
bugs was relatively easy at Stanford
compared to other universities be
cause the systems were built with
SPIRES, a database designed to sup
port four-digit entries, Weitz said.
Developed at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center and brought to
the University in the 19705, SPIRES
stores these digits internally and thus

allows full expression of dates.
Many programs, however, did
have problems that needed correc
tion.
"In our student systems, we used
particular terminology to describe
the year and quarter; for instance,
quarter 1, year 96. If someone want
ed to search for all years greater than
1999,2(XX) would not appear because
it would be stored as (X)," Weitz said.
Extensive efforts have been made
to rectify such problems. After Infor
mation Technology Systems and Ser
vices assessed and fixed problems in
the SUNet system (the centrally
managed portion of Stanford's net
work), ITSS developed a completely
independent version of SUNet just
for Y2K testing.
The Year 2000 Team, a joint ef
fort of the Internal Audit depart
ment and the ITSS Division, also cor
rected problems with embedded
chips throughout campus.
"Embedded chips are systems
like computers without the monitor
and keyboard â€” they're in things
like cars and elevators," Y2K Project
Manager Karl Heinz said.
Such chips, which have date func
tions, are parts of medical equipment
in Stanford Hospital, including life
support systems, automatic dosage
suppliers and heart pacemakers.
"We went through medical litera
ture and catalogues to research the
products and found a few pieces of
failure, but those pieces mostly failed
in their recording function, not in
their major operation," Weitz said.
Although testing has been quite
comprehensive, the team is prepar
ing further by formulating contin
gency plans for all of the separate
schools and administrative units.
However team leaders feel that these
plans probably will not be used be
cause systems have been tested so
many times.
