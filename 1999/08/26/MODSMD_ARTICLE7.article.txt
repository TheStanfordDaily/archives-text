# U.S. News' college rankings place Stanford at sixth
## 
### Jed Rose Contributing writer 
In what has become the ranking
system that most universities love to
hate, U.S. News and World Report
has pumped out a new formula for the
ranking of undergraduate schools.
Under the new formula this year,
Stanford took sixth place on the an
nual totem pole, five spots below the

first-place position the University
once held when U.S. News and World
Report rankings were first introduced
in 1988. Stanford dropped two places
from its fourth ranked position last
year.
Robert Kinnally, dean of Under
graduate Admissions, attributed
Stanford's shift in the rankings to the
method that U.S. News employs for
conjuring the overall score.

"They have to keep changing it be
cause they have to sell magazines,"
said Kinnally.
In addition to the yearly under
graduate college rankings, U.S. News
also has specialty rankings released
each year within their special college
issue. Stanford placed fifth for a "best
value" for an undergraduate educa
tion, a category in which Stanford was
first last year.

In U.S. News' formula, academic
reputation carries the greatest weight
— 25 percent — because the maga
zine takes into account that a diploma
from a distinguished college helps
graduates get good jobs or gain ad
mission to top graduate programs.
A school's reputation is deter
mined by giving surveys to presidents,
provosts and deans of admission at
different institutions. Each individual

was asked to rate peer schools' acade
mic programs on a scale from 1 (mar
ginal) to 5 (distinguished).
For national schools, graduation
and retention rates accounted for 20
percent of the overall ranking, as did
faculty resources. Student selectivity
counted for 15 percent of the ranking,
and financial resources counted for 10
percent. Alumni giving and gradua
tion performance (the difference be
tween actual and predicted gradua
tion rates) each counted for 5 percent.
U.S. News' ranking method this
year also incorporated a new factor—
"standardization." This was seen as
the major reason for large fluctua
tions in the rankings this year, such as
the California Institute of Technolo
gy moving from number nine to num
ber one, becoming the only other
West Coast school besides Stanford
to attain that ranking.
This new aspect of school evalua
tion examined how much a school
spends on each student. U.S. News
did not report any specific numbers
for universities' expenditure per stu
dent in its magazine edition.
Since Caltech's undergraduate
population is less than a graduating
class at Stanford, incorporating "stan
dardization" may have given Caltech
an advantage over universities of
comparable size to Stanford.
"Good for them. I think that's

great," said Kinnally, concerning Cal
tech's recent claiming of the number
one spot.
One factor that has remained con
sistent in the U.S. News ranking
methodology is the academic reputa
tion score.
Stanford has consistently placed
first in a peer evaluation from univer
sities across the nation.
"We get a lot of press in a lot of dif
ferent arenas. Through the Hoover
Institution, other think tanks and
through our athletic programs," Kin
nally said.
This year, Stanford tied for first
place with Harvard and MIT for rep
utation, with a ranking of 4.9 out of a
maximum of 5.
Stanford's improvements this
year, according to U.S. News, include:
a student to faculty ratio that dropped
from 15/1 to 7/1, a record-low accep
tance rate and a record-high yield (the
ratio of students who enroll to those
admitted).
The student to faculty ratio change
is probably due to an alteration in
U.S. News' definition of what consti
tutes faculty, according to Kinnally.
Kinnally hypothesized that U.S.

News may count TAs or librarians as
part of the faculty.
"We provide objective data and
make it available to the public
through numerous forms of media,"
said Kinnally, referring to The Un
dergraduate Admissions web site
which features numerous statistics.
Stanford students generally did
not consider the ranking system accu
rate.
"I've never really gone along with
rankings—so much depends on what
specific field you are studying," said
junior Erin Schmidt.
"I've never put much credence in
[rankings]," said senior Lyen Huang.
"They seem pretty arbitrary.
"It's the whole environment at a
college and how it works for each stu
dent individually that determines
whether [he] will be happy there, [not
rankings]," Schmidt added.
"I think it's a shame that they mis
represent Stanford," said coterminal
student Renny Hwang of the rank
ings, "but it's not a big deal, because
we know what a good school it is any
way."
Kinnally also said the rankings
have raised interest among some

unanticipated sources.
"Comedy Central called us this
morning. That's hysterical, no pun

intended," Kinnally said with a
smile. "I'm sure it's about U.S.
News."
