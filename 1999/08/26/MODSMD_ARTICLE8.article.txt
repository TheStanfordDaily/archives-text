# UCSF-Stanford postpones decision on Mt. Zion
## 
### Neela Dasgupta Contributing writer 
The decision on whether or not to
keep Mt. Zion Hospital open has
been delayed and will not be ad
dressed at the Aug. 27 meeting of the
UCSF-Stanford Health Care board
of directors.
Dean of the UCSF Medical Cen
ter, Haile Debas, will not have rec
ommendations ready and still needs
more time to prepare, said Melodie
Jackson, managing editor at the Stan
ford Hospital news bureau.
A new date for the decision has
not yet been set.
Mt. Zion went under public and
administrative scrutiny after a May
report on operating losses showed
that the medical center was responsi
ble for $56 million of the $60 million
operating losses since the merger of
UCSF and Stanford facilities in 1997.

The report furthermore stated
that Mt. Zion will need a total of $3(X)
million by 2030 to meet state codes if
it is maintained as a full hospital.
Decision postponed before
This is not the first time a decision
on the center has been postponed.
On July 23, the board was offered $5
million to keep Mt. Zion open, and
they decided then to wait three
weeks before settling the issue. The
Mt. Zion Board of Trustees and the
Mt. Zion Health Fund together
pledged $5 million to keep the hospi
tal functional through the end of
2001.
Board of Trustees Chairman
David Melnick explained that much
of the $56 million losses were from
depreciation and high overhead
charged by the hospital system. Some
costs charged also appeared incor

rect, like expenses for a radiology on
cology unit that does not exist there.
"We have suspicions about the ac-

curacy of the numbers," Melnick said
in a July 24 San Francisco Examiner
article.
Before the July meeting, 40 speak
ers told the board how important Mt.
Zion was to its community because it
provides medical education at UCSF
and also prevents emergency rooms

in San Francisco from being over
whelmed.
"The presentations were extreme
ly useful," Stanford Board of
Trustees member Isaac Stein said.
According to the May report on
losses, there are other options for Mt.
Zion. The center's inpatient and
emergency room services could be
moved to the UCSF medical center
on Parnassus Heights. Mt. Zion could
also be used for 72-hour "short-stay"
hospitalizations, which would save
$10 million annually.
Worker response
An Aug. 27 decision about Mount
Zion would have come at a pivotal
moment in the evaluation of the
UCSF-Stanford Hospital merger.
On Aug. 3, Stanford President
Gerhard Casper and U.C. President
Richard Atkinson asked the hospital

system's board of directors for an in
vestigation into the losses.
Only a week later, UCSF Health
Care Chief executive Peter Van
Etten and chief operating officer
William Kerr announced their resig
nations, giving a private consulting
group control of the hospital system.
Neither executives were available for
comment.
The consulting group now in
charge, Hunter Group, has caused
even more heads to turn.
Some health-care workers be
lieve that the firm puts profits first
and cuts patient care jobs in most of
the hospitals for which they have
consulted.
On Aug. 12, members of the Ser
vice Employess International Union
and community leaders in Santa
Clara County put on a rally and
spoke out in front of Stanford Hospi
tal to voice such concerns.
