# Stanford seeks new General Use Permit
## 
### Valentine Ding 
To renew its General Use Permit,
Stanford will present the draft of a
new land use plan to Santa Clara
County on Sept. 20.
With the prospect of campus
growth in the next ten years, the state
government and some environmental
protection agencies are concerned
about the potential impact on sur
rounding areas and Stanford's ability
to balance expansion with open land
preservation.
Strains on land use have arisen
with the worsened housing situation
caused by the general growth of Stan
ford's neighbors.
"The student body itself won't
have a major growth in the next few
years," said Hunter Tart, a member of
the Graduate Student Council. "But
[the trend is that] more and more
graduate students are demanding to
live on campus."
According to Provost John Hen
nessy, Stanford's future land use
would also include academic build
ings in addition to housing.
Hennessy said at an Aug. 7 com
munity forum that Stanford will aim
to fulfill the mission of being a promi
nent teaching and research institu
tion.
"New facilities are often needed to
do state-of-art research." he said at
the forum.
Stanford owns 8,180 acres of land.
1.7(X) acres of which are being used as
the core campus. Viewed from the air.

the far west and southwest part of
Stanford lands are open space.
The University's land use is ruled
by six government jurisdictions, each
of which supervises an area of the
Stanford lands. Currently Stanford is
planning to use the land associated
with Santa Clara County. The Uni
versity must reach a compromise in its
land use plans with the county in
order to be re-issued a General Use
Permit (GUP), which was first grant
ed to Stanford in 1989.
"What we are looking for in Stan
ford's land use plan is some certain
ties in the next ten years," said Sarah
Jones, Santa Clara County planner.
"We want to know how much land ex
actly Stanford will need and whether
the [surrounding] community is un
comfortable with the growth."
In addition to a more specific plan,
the county also "hopes to see Stan
ford drawing an urban growth bound
ary." Jones said, which is the equiva
lent of a pledge to preserve the Uni
versity's current open land.
"We will have two plans," said
Larry Horton, director of Govern
ment and Community Relations.
"There will be a community plan,
which includes land use designations
and land use policies, and a GUP ap
plication, which includes locations
and numbers of housing units and
sizes, categories of uses, and locations
of all academic and academic support
facilities."
After Stanford disclosed the gen
eral elements of the plans at a corn

munity forum on Aug. 7, the Palo
Alto Daily News reported that "Stan
ford's new long-range planning docu
ment. . .won't contain one thing many
residents want —a pledge to preserve
open space in the foothills."
"It is flat-out wrong," said Horton,
responding to the article. "Stanford
treasures and protects open space. It
has been a careful steward of its land
for well over a century and the excel
lent stewardship will continue."
As for the suggestion by the Santa
Clara County Planning Office, Hor
ton said, "We are continuing to study
the issue of an urban growth bound
ary. . .1 am not aware of an urban
growth boundary being applied to a
single landowner, nor am I aware of a
similar line for the communities on ei
ther side of Stanford lands."
The boundary suggested by the
county is set along Junipcro Serra
Boulevard, which basically separates
the central campus from the undevel
oped land.
Recently, Stanford agreed to lease
the land west of Junipero Serra to the
Carnegie Foundation at a nominal
fee of $ 1 a year for 51 years. The foun
dation. which has no ties to Stanford,
will build its Advancement of Teach
ing think tank on the site. According
to a spokesperson at the foundation,
the cluster of buildings they are plan
ning will take up to 20,000 square feet,
and there will be 35 employees.
"I'm disturbed [by the land
lease]," said Denice Dade of the
Committee for Green Foothills, a
non-profit environmental protection
organization.

"The foothills are the signature of
the community, and they should be
preserved," said Dade.
Instead of leasing the land west of
Junipero Serra, Dade believes Stan
ford could have considered alterna
tives, like using land somewhere on
the central campus. She insisted that

the University should be flexible.
"Stanford may need to grow, [but
it] may not need that much land to
grow," said Dade.
"That's ridiculous," Horton re
sponded. "We have to use the land for
our proper academic purposes.
Carnegie Foundation thinks the site is

ideal, and they are preparing a pro
posal for the county."
The foundation expects to start
construction in the spring of 2000.
But first, it has to wait for the county
to evaluate its proposal. Stanford's
community plan and GUP applica
tion, which will come out on Sept.

20, will also be studied and evaluat
ed in the county's Environment Im
pact Report. In the meantime, all
the plans and reports will he dis
cussed in a series of community
meetings and public hearings. The
whole process could last until De
cember of 2(XX).
