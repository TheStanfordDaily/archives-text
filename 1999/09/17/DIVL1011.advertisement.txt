Everybody loves to trash teenagers, right?
Maybe they don't realize that we do care.
That we can make a difference.
Get involved in Crime Prevention.
Clean up parks. Teach younger kids.
Start a school or neighborhood watch.
And help make your community
safer and better for everyone.
Together, we can prove them wrong
by doing something right.
