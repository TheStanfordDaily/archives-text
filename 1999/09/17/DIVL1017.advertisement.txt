LOOKING FOR TRUE LOVE? You
haven't known real love until
you've known Mine. lAM a
faithful companion who can
understand your heart better
than anyone. You don't have to
be lonely. Let me be the reliable
friend that will comfort you.
There's nothing I'd love more
than to be with you forever.
I AM just a prayer away. -- JC
"For Cod so greatly loved the world that He gave His only
begotten Son, so that whoever believes in (trusts, clings to,
relies on) Him shall not perish - but have eternal life."
- John 3:16
Come and experience God's Love!
