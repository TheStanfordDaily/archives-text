Welcome to Stanford University!
You've worked very hard to yet here, but as you know,
so has everyone else. All those shiny happy faces
around you are used to being in the top of their class,
and there lies the challenge for you to remain there.
Doubtless, the university environment presents a
w ide range of opportunities tor personal development
and experience, but the core of university-level study,
(much like those AP classes), involves an ongoing
commitment to reading and comprehension. And
staying ahead ol the curve is still your best strategy.
We would like to present for your consideration the
C-Pen 200. It is shaped like a pen, but it does some
thing that no other pen can do. It can read. How? It
is a powerful computer with a 2Mb memory that
accurately copies printed text, translates it into a
computer format, and transfers it to your PC. So you
can note down that sonnet, theory, or philosophical
argument in seconds, not hours.
Even though it weighs less than six ounces, it is capa
ble of scanning text at 100 characters per second and
storing up to 250 pages. Better still, it performs addi
tional PDA functions such as an address book fea
ture. Interestingly, despite being the most advanced
pen on the planet, it is also intuitively simple to use.
The New York Times addressed this simplicity rather
effectively, by declaring that the C-Pen 200 works like
a digital variation on the popular yellow highlighter.
So why take notes when you can take the C-Pen with
you instead? Use it at the library, the lecture hall, at
your desk when you're pulling an all-nighter.
for a small investment of just $199,
you'll never be at a loss for words.
