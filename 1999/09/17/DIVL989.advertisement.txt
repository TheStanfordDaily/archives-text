The Daily
is looking
for writers,
artists and
photographers
Try your hand at journalism working for one of the top collegiate papers in the country.
No experience is necessary, you get paid and the time commitment is flexible.
When a world leader drops in to visit, you're the shmuck covering the story.
When the band drops their pants, you're there with a camera. For better or for worse.
When you're ready to join up, stop by - we're training new staff all next week.
INTERESTED? Visit our table at the activities fair tomorrow,
come to "Daily 101X" next week, or call Robin at 725-2100 ext. 305.
