This year, the ASSU and SSE are undertaking an ambitious
effort to consolidate their presence on the Internet in the
form of a revamped ASSU Online. As one of the most
technically advanced student associations in the world, the
ASSU and SSE have a wealth of ideas just waiting to be
explored by people with the know-how and the passion to
do so. Specifically, we're looking for programmers and
designers to help us create a significantly enhanced online
presence.

With a dozen student-run businesses and a $9 million
endowment to manage, we offer Stanford students a
wide range of services every day. Sunday Flicks. The
Stanford Store. Lecture Notes. Custom Apparel. Our
staff manages budgets, markets products, and runs
with new ideas. The program introduces twelve
energetic, creative, and enthusiastic freshmen to a
year-long lesson on the business world. This is hands
on, real-life business experience. Because business
matters.
