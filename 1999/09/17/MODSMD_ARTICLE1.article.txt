# Casper to leave presidency next August
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Gerhard Casper, who an
nounced on Sept. 14 that he will step
down as University president effec
tive Aug. 31, 2(MM), will return to
teaching at Stanford after a one
year sabbatical. However, he may
need to begin holding office hours

sooner than he expected.
"Last night, [two students] came
to my house and rang the doorbell..
. and said they wanted to talk to
me." Casper said. "I came and we
sat up on the terrace, and they want
ed to dissuade me from stepping
down.
"That students would feci that
they can do that and come directly

and express their feelings on this
was really, incredibly moving."
While Casper declined to comply
with these students' requests, his tie
sire to foster "informal interac
tions" with students during his
tenure here at Stanford has been an
aspect of his position that he consid
ers to be "very important."
"Talking to students in the main
quad, having discussions in the
dorms, doing bedtime stories, doing
Gaieties." Casper said, "all of it was
very enjoyable ... all of those as
pects have been and are very, very

satisfying."
Casper's move to teaching will
likely allow him to continue inter
acting with students. "Given the
emphasis I have placed on the cre
ation of Stanford Introductory
Studies, I shall, in the years remain
ing. devote most of my efforts to our
undergraduates."
Behind Casper's decision
Casper, who came to the I Jniver
sity in IW2. said that he "slowly
came to the conclusion to step

down, and that he has always con
sidered seven to eight years to be an
"appropriate time" for his tenure.
He said he decided to leave dur
ing the "course of this summer."
"In the last couple of years in the
fall. I looked at my situation and de
cided. 'yes. I'll do another year," and
this year. I concluded I should not."
Casper said.
"I've known that he's been think
ing about this for some time." said
Political Science Prof, and former
Provost Condolee/za Rice. "We
would muse about it often. I knew

he had an internal clock, and this
summer was his time to reflect and
decide on that."
In coming to this decision.
Casper said that he was most con
cerned with preventing a possible
"burn-out," after working in admin
istrative positions for the past 20
years.
"The important thing is that you
make sure you do not burn out,"
Casper said. "I'm not burned out
now. This is more like a fire preven
tion on my part. I want to make sure
that 1 do not burn but. and I certain
ly have detected at times signs of
weariness on my part."
While a number of Casper's col
leagues expressed surprise concern
ing what many felt to be an unex
pected announcement, Yale Uni
versity President Richard Levin, a
Stanford alumni, said, "Over the
years, I've had conversations with
him that led me to not be surprised,"
he said.
Casper cited the past 20 years
that he has spent in administrative
positions as one of the reasons for
his decision.
"I am not president of Stanford
because 1 wanted this as my career,"
he said. "I was asked whether 1
would come and be the president,
and I thought this was a great thing
to do and 1 loved doing it. I was quite
committed to doing it for as long as
made sense.
"But as 1 said. 1 have been in
leadership positions for 20 years
now, and 1 am b 1 and not getting any
younger. I would like to take a pause
and see what am I going to do for the
rest of my days at the University."

current biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy said that he supported
Casper's decision and understood
his desire to step down.
"Every person has to decide what
the right time is tor them," Kennedy
said. "There has to be a sense of
one's capacity and the needs of
one's family gets factored in."
Other factors
Casper informed the Board of

Trustees of his
decision at a reg
ularly scheduled
meeting on Sept.
10, during which
the trustees also
passed a resolu
tion on UCSF-
Stanford calling
for separate man-

agement of the northern and south
ern halves of UCSF-Stanford.
, Casper said the problems sur
rounding UCSF-Stanford have
"nothing to do with my decision."
He added, however, that "it
would be absolutely misleading to
say the merger hasn't been very dif
ficult at times."
Provost John Hennessy said that
"factors" such as the UCSF-Stan
ford problems could "make the
challenge in being president all the
more challenging, difficult and tir
ing."
• "[Casper] is a president who real-
Jy wants to take responsibility and
be involved in all decisions," Hen
nessy said. "He takes weight on him
self, and these sorts of challenges
could lead to shorter terms.... The
burdens of being president have ac
celerated ... and the issues sur
rounding UCSF-Stanford and the
Labor Department probably play a
factor."
Rice University Director of
Communications and Assistant to
the President Terry Shepard, Stan
ford's former director of communi

cations, said that the UCSF-Stan
ford troubles were "probably one
issue among many."
Casper's last year
Casper cited resolving the
UCSF-Stanford problems as one of
his goals for the upcoming year, as
well as working to obtain a new
General Use Permit for Stanford.
"1 also hope that we shall make
significant progress toward placing
the Center for Bioengineering, Bio
medicine and Biosciences on the
Stanford map," he said. "I shall con
tinue to do preparatory work for a
campaign for undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford. If the Board of
Trustees approves the campaign, I
hope to play a role in the fundraising
effort."
Kennedy said he felt Casper
would be facing several different is
sues this year, specifically UCSF-
Stanford, which could bear great im
portance on Stanford and other in
stitutions.
Richard Atkinson, President of
University of California, said he
looks "forward to working closely
with [Casper] in the coming months
as we address the relationship be
tween our medical centers and
many other issues of common inter
est."
Casper affirmed that there "is
much difficult work to do in the year
ahead."
"I am looking forward to it.and I
assure everyone that 'lame duck" is
not a role I have played in the past or
that I have any inclination to plav in
the future."
Reactions to the news
Many of Casper's colleagues,
both at Stanford and at peer institu
tions, regarded the news with sur
prise and sadness in seeing him go.
"1 was very saddened by his deci
sion," said Dean of Students Marc
Wais. "I think we're losing a great
president — one who has had a
tremendous impact on Stanford and
the student experience, both in and
outside of the classroom."

"He is a really terrific person and
my closest friend in the university
system," Levin said. "1 feel very sad
that he's leaving."
Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback
said that he was "completely sur
prised and somewhat shocked"
when he heard of his decision.
"I thought he was doing a re
markable job as president, and I had
no idea something like this was com
ing."
Chair of the Board of Trustees
Robert Bass said that Casper's an
nouncement came as a "surprise for
the Board of Trustees."
A Board of Trustees statement
said. "While we wish it were not so,
we respect his judgment and accept
his decision with profound gratitude
for his extraordinary leadership of
Stanford."
A number of his colleagues said
that the great amount of time and
energy he devoted to his position
was "astounding."
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya said he "under
stood [Casper's] decision," due to
the "incredible demands and the
sheer amount of energy he devoted
to the job."
"Eight years is a significant
amount of time, and lie has tireless
ly devoted it to the Stanford com
munity."
Shepard concurred.
"1 was somewhat surprised to
hear about his decision in some
ways," he said. "But he has put in
eight years and has worked incredi
bly hard. He's earned a promotion."
Praise from colleagues
In a Board of Trustees' state
ment, Casper was praised for his "in
tellectual and administrative lender
ship ... from curriculum, to faculty,
to students, to alumni, to manage
ment, to our lands and buildings,
and to the resources that will assure
Stanford's excellence for the fu
ture."
Many cited Casper's greatest suc
cess as his dedication to the im
provement of undergraduate educa

tion, and the variety of programs de
veloped under his tenure for fresh
men and sophomores.
"I particularly admired the way
in which he continued and extended
the quality of education," Kennedy
said.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
commented on Casper's legacy.
"1 believe that when we look
hack at the Casper era, we will find
that this man has left a profound
mark on Stanford, especially on un
dergraduate education."
Casper also said he considered his
focus on undergraduate education to
be his most important accomplish
ment. He added that he would want
to be remembered for "what was im
portant to him" — the most signifi
cant of which he considers to be Stan
ford Introductory Studies.
"I think SIS stands for not just
looking at the first two years of the
undergraduate experience, but it
also stands for my view of the Uni
versity," Casper said. "Students are
given an early chance to participate
in the pursuit of knowledge and are
treated as partners in it."
Wais said that felt that Casper's
dedication to "enhancing the under
graduate experience" was one of his
most important contributions to
Stanford.
"Stanford students ought to be
eternally grateful," Wais said.
"They now have the opportunity to
work with professors through re
search and seminars in their first and
second years. Casper has changed
the fabric of Stanford as a research
and teaching institution."
Montoya cited Casper's desire to
maintain student contact and his
continuing appearances in "ASSU
discussions, class officers' events,
residences, campaign stops for tree
candidates" as representative of his
"commitment to being visible."
"[Casper's] accomplishments are
endless," said Montoya. "He has
limitless energy and has instituted so
many programs for undergraduates
during his time here — it is evident
that [Casper] has made student con
tact a high priority."

Shepard lauded Casper's han
dling of the indirect cost scandal
when he initially entered his posi
tion in 1992.
"[Casper] had a tough situation
to come into in 1992," Shepard said.
"It's hard to describe how dire
things appeared then, and how he
brought calm and confidence and
set about the situation. He proved in
the end that all the scare headlines
weren't true."
Shepard also said that Casper's
focus on Stanford's "identity" helped
to mold the institution as a whole.
"[Casper] helped Stanford redis
cover its history, as he applied
lessons to current times, which gave
Stanford a sense of its history and
gave it identity as an institution. He
has had success on so many fronts,"
Shepard said.
Robert Berdahl, chancellor of
UC-Berkeley, where Casper spent
two years as an assistant professor of
political science, said, "I have had
the great privilege of working with
Gerhard Casper in sister institutions
for well over a decade ... The entire
higher education community is
going to miss his leadership."
Future plans
After a one-year sabbatical fol
lowing this year, Casper plans on re
turning as a professor to the Stan
ford campus, where he would like to
engage himself in undergraduate
education.
Hugo Sonnenschein, president of
the University of Chicago, where
Casper was provost from 1989 to
1992 and dean of Chicago's Law
School from 1979 to 1987, said that
Casper would affect undergraduate
education in "a different way"
through his role as a professor.
"Through teaching, he will pow
erfully influence the institution, and
will continue to be a very important
presence in students' lives," Son
nenschein said.
The upcoming search
According to Bass, the search for
Casper's successor is in very prelimi

nary stages at this point. Bass will
begin the process by appointing a
search committee, consisting of a
combination of trustees, faculty
members, students, alumni and staff.
The search committee then will
"advertise for the position and seek
input from numerous sources."
"We'll develop a list of folders of
names suggested and then narrow
down the list," Bass said. "The
search committee will wrestle with
all sorts of issues in the process."
Casper was only one of two pres
idents brought in from other institu
tions. Bass said that it was "too pre
mature" to tell who within the Uni
versity would be interested.
"The president can come from
the inside or the outside," Bass said.
"We look for the most qualified in
dividual.
Kennedy said that he thinks "the
provost will be looked at hard by any
one who's thinking about a succes
sor."
"You can expect an intense focus
on [Hennessy]. He'll either be a
first-year president or a second-year
provost."
Hennessy said he had not given
the matter any consideration, and
that he is "focusing on the upcoming
year and planning for that."
Bass said that he expected to
have Casper's successor chosen
near the end of this academic year.
A time of transition
This past year has brought a vari
ety of new individuals to Stanford's
top posts in its academic schools and
administration. With Casper leaving
the next year, the University will
have a relatively new administra
tion.
History Prof. Mark Mancall said
that he feels such a cycle is "nor
mal."
"It is essential for the health of
the institution — the president has
to have a provost with whom he or
she can work — the provost has to
serve as a transition from one presi-


Bass
dent to the other, so it's a symbiotic
relationship of sorts," he said.
Casper's legacy
On Sept. 14 Casper addressed
his departure in his trademark,
tongue-in-cheek style.
"After the Texas football game.
I concluded mv tenure at Stanford
had to end. and I informed tlu
trustees," he said wryly. "But b\ tin.
time we had won against Washing
ton State, it was too late, and 1
couldn't go hack on my decision.
Casper's combination of wit. in
tellect and dedication was soiu
thing many said they would miss.
"It's a real loss when someone
who's doing the remarkable job
[Casper] has been doing leaves
Zoback said. " That's a loss p.
od. I'm sure an outstanding succv
sor will be found, but nevertheless,
there is tremendous affection and
respect for President Casper among
faculty, students, and alumni."

nounced on Sept. 14 that he will step

nounced on Sept. 14 that he will step
down as University president effec
tive Aug. 31, 2(MM), will return to
teaching at Stanford after a one
year sabbatical. However, he may
need to begin holding office hours

sooner than he expected.
"Last night, [two students] came
to my house and rang the doorbell..
. and said they wanted to talk to
me." Casper said. "I came and we
sat up on the terrace, and they want
ed to dissuade me from stepping
down.
"That students would feci that
they can do that and come directly

and express their feelings on this
was really, incredibly moving."
While Casper declined to comply
with these students' requests, his tie
sire to foster "informal interac
tions" with students during his
tenure here at Stanford has been an
aspect of his position that he consid
ers to be "very important."
"Talking to students in the main
quad, having discussions in the
dorms, doing bedtime stories, doing
Gaieties." Casper said, "all of it was
very enjoyable ... all of those as
pects have been and are very, very

satisfying."
Casper's move to teaching will
likely allow him to continue inter
acting with students. "Given the
emphasis I have placed on the cre
ation of Stanford Introductory
Studies, I shall, in the years remain
ing. devote most of my efforts to our
undergraduates."
Behind Casper's decision
Casper, who came to the I Jniver
sity in IW2. said that he "slowly
came to the conclusion to step

down, and that he has always con
sidered seven to eight years to be an
"appropriate time" for his tenure.
He said he decided to leave dur
ing the "course of this summer."
"In the last couple of years in the
fall. I looked at my situation and de
cided. 'yes. I'll do another year," and
this year. I concluded I should not."
Casper said.
"I've known that he's been think
ing about this for some time." said
Political Science Prof, and former
Provost Condolee/za Rice. "We
would muse about it often. I knew

he had an internal clock, and this
summer was his time to reflect and
decide on that."
In coming to this decision.
Casper said that he was most con
cerned with preventing a possible
"burn-out," after working in admin
istrative positions for the past 20
years.
"The important thing is that you
make sure you do not burn out,"
Casper said. "I'm not burned out
now. This is more like a fire preven
tion on my part. I want to make sure
that 1 do not burn but. and I certain
ly have detected at times signs of
weariness on my part."
While a number of Casper's col
leagues expressed surprise concern
ing what many felt to be an unex
pected announcement, Yale Uni
versity President Richard Levin, a
Stanford alumni, said, "Over the
years, I've had conversations with
him that led me to not be surprised,"
he said.
Casper cited the past 20 years
that he has spent in administrative
positions as one of the reasons for
his decision.
"I am not president of Stanford
because 1 wanted this as my career,"
he said. "I was asked whether 1
would come and be the president,
and I thought this was a great thing
to do and 1 loved doing it. I was quite
committed to doing it for as long as
made sense.
"But as 1 said. 1 have been in
leadership positions for 20 years
now, and 1 am b 1 and not getting any
younger. I would like to take a pause
and see what am I going to do for the
rest of my days at the University."

current biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy said that he supported
Casper's decision and understood
his desire to step down.
"Every person has to decide what
the right time is tor them," Kennedy
said. "There has to be a sense of
one's capacity and the needs of
one's family gets factored in."
Other factors
Casper informed the Board of

Trustees of his
decision at a reg
ularly scheduled
meeting on Sept.
10, during which
the trustees also
passed a resolu
tion on UCSF-
Stanford calling
for separate man-

agement of the northern and south
ern halves of UCSF-Stanford.
, Casper said the problems sur
rounding UCSF-Stanford have
"nothing to do with my decision."
He added, however, that "it
would be absolutely misleading to
say the merger hasn't been very dif
ficult at times."
Provost John Hennessy said that
"factors" such as the UCSF-Stan
ford problems could "make the
challenge in being president all the
more challenging, difficult and tir
ing."
• "[Casper] is a president who real-
Jy wants to take responsibility and
be involved in all decisions," Hen
nessy said. "He takes weight on him
self, and these sorts of challenges
could lead to shorter terms.... The
burdens of being president have ac
celerated ... and the issues sur
rounding UCSF-Stanford and the
Labor Department probably play a
factor."
Rice University Director of
Communications and Assistant to
the President Terry Shepard, Stan
ford's former director of communi

cations, said that the UCSF-Stan
ford troubles were "probably one
issue among many."
Casper's last year
Casper cited resolving the
UCSF-Stanford problems as one of
his goals for the upcoming year, as
well as working to obtain a new
General Use Permit for Stanford.
"1 also hope that we shall make
significant progress toward placing
the Center for Bioengineering, Bio
medicine and Biosciences on the
Stanford map," he said. "I shall con
tinue to do preparatory work for a
campaign for undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford. If the Board of
Trustees approves the campaign, I
hope to play a role in the fundraising
effort."
Kennedy said he felt Casper
would be facing several different is
sues this year, specifically UCSF-
Stanford, which could bear great im
portance on Stanford and other in
stitutions.
Richard Atkinson, President of
University of California, said he
looks "forward to working closely
with [Casper] in the coming months
as we address the relationship be
tween our medical centers and
many other issues of common inter
est."
Casper affirmed that there "is
much difficult work to do in the year
ahead."
"I am looking forward to it.and I
assure everyone that 'lame duck" is
not a role I have played in the past or
that I have any inclination to plav in
the future."
Reactions to the news
Many of Casper's colleagues,
both at Stanford and at peer institu
tions, regarded the news with sur
prise and sadness in seeing him go.
"1 was very saddened by his deci
sion," said Dean of Students Marc
Wais. "I think we're losing a great
president — one who has had a
tremendous impact on Stanford and
the student experience, both in and
outside of the classroom."

"He is a really terrific person and
my closest friend in the university
system," Levin said. "1 feel very sad
that he's leaving."
Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback
said that he was "completely sur
prised and somewhat shocked"
when he heard of his decision.
"I thought he was doing a re
markable job as president, and I had
no idea something like this was com
ing."
Chair of the Board of Trustees
Robert Bass said that Casper's an
nouncement came as a "surprise for
the Board of Trustees."
A Board of Trustees statement
said. "While we wish it were not so,
we respect his judgment and accept
his decision with profound gratitude
for his extraordinary leadership of
Stanford."
A number of his colleagues said
that the great amount of time and
energy he devoted to his position
was "astounding."
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya said he "under
stood [Casper's] decision," due to
the "incredible demands and the
sheer amount of energy he devoted
to the job."
"Eight years is a significant
amount of time, and lie has tireless
ly devoted it to the Stanford com
munity."
Shepard concurred.
"1 was somewhat surprised to
hear about his decision in some
ways," he said. "But he has put in
eight years and has worked incredi
bly hard. He's earned a promotion."
Praise from colleagues
In a Board of Trustees' state
ment, Casper was praised for his "in
tellectual and administrative lender
ship ... from curriculum, to faculty,
to students, to alumni, to manage
ment, to our lands and buildings,
and to the resources that will assure
Stanford's excellence for the fu
ture."
Many cited Casper's greatest suc
cess as his dedication to the im
provement of undergraduate educa

tion, and the variety of programs de
veloped under his tenure for fresh
men and sophomores.
"I particularly admired the way
in which he continued and extended
the quality of education," Kennedy
said.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
commented on Casper's legacy.
"1 believe that when we look
hack at the Casper era, we will find
that this man has left a profound
mark on Stanford, especially on un
dergraduate education."
Casper also said he considered his
focus on undergraduate education to
be his most important accomplish
ment. He added that he would want
to be remembered for "what was im
portant to him" — the most signifi
cant of which he considers to be Stan
ford Introductory Studies.
"I think SIS stands for not just
looking at the first two years of the
undergraduate experience, but it
also stands for my view of the Uni
versity," Casper said. "Students are
given an early chance to participate
in the pursuit of knowledge and are
treated as partners in it."
Wais said that felt that Casper's
dedication to "enhancing the under
graduate experience" was one of his
most important contributions to
Stanford.
"Stanford students ought to be
eternally grateful," Wais said.
"They now have the opportunity to
work with professors through re
search and seminars in their first and
second years. Casper has changed
the fabric of Stanford as a research
and teaching institution."
Montoya cited Casper's desire to
maintain student contact and his
continuing appearances in "ASSU
discussions, class officers' events,
residences, campaign stops for tree
candidates" as representative of his
"commitment to being visible."
"[Casper's] accomplishments are
endless," said Montoya. "He has
limitless energy and has instituted so
many programs for undergraduates
during his time here — it is evident
that [Casper] has made student con
tact a high priority."

Shepard lauded Casper's han
dling of the indirect cost scandal
when he initially entered his posi
tion in 1992.
"[Casper] had a tough situation
to come into in 1992," Shepard said.
"It's hard to describe how dire
things appeared then, and how he
brought calm and confidence and
set about the situation. He proved in
the end that all the scare headlines
weren't true."
Shepard also said that Casper's
focus on Stanford's "identity" helped
to mold the institution as a whole.
"[Casper] helped Stanford redis
cover its history, as he applied
lessons to current times, which gave
Stanford a sense of its history and
gave it identity as an institution. He
has had success on so many fronts,"
Shepard said.
Robert Berdahl, chancellor of
UC-Berkeley, where Casper spent
two years as an assistant professor of
political science, said, "I have had
the great privilege of working with
Gerhard Casper in sister institutions
for well over a decade ... The entire
higher education community is
going to miss his leadership."
Future plans
After a one-year sabbatical fol
lowing this year, Casper plans on re
turning as a professor to the Stan
ford campus, where he would like to
engage himself in undergraduate
education.
Hugo Sonnenschein, president of
the University of Chicago, where
Casper was provost from 1989 to
1992 and dean of Chicago's Law
School from 1979 to 1987, said that
Casper would affect undergraduate
education in "a different way"
through his role as a professor.
"Through teaching, he will pow
erfully influence the institution, and
will continue to be a very important
presence in students' lives," Son
nenschein said.
The upcoming search
According to Bass, the search for
Casper's successor is in very prelimi

nary stages at this point. Bass will
begin the process by appointing a
search committee, consisting of a
combination of trustees, faculty
members, students, alumni and staff.
The search committee then will
"advertise for the position and seek
input from numerous sources."
"We'll develop a list of folders of
names suggested and then narrow
down the list," Bass said. "The
search committee will wrestle with
all sorts of issues in the process."
Casper was only one of two pres
idents brought in from other institu
tions. Bass said that it was "too pre
mature" to tell who within the Uni
versity would be interested.
"The president can come from
the inside or the outside," Bass said.
"We look for the most qualified in
dividual.
Kennedy said that he thinks "the
provost will be looked at hard by any
one who's thinking about a succes
sor."
"You can expect an intense focus
on [Hennessy]. He'll either be a
first-year president or a second-year
provost."
Hennessy said he had not given
the matter any consideration, and
that he is "focusing on the upcoming
year and planning for that."
Bass said that he expected to
have Casper's successor chosen
near the end of this academic year.
A time of transition
This past year has brought a vari
ety of new individuals to Stanford's
top posts in its academic schools and
administration. With Casper leaving
the next year, the University will
have a relatively new administra
tion.
History Prof. Mark Mancall said
that he feels such a cycle is "nor
mal."
"It is essential for the health of
the institution — the president has
to have a provost with whom he or
she can work — the provost has to
serve as a transition from one presi-


Bass
dent to the other, so it's a symbiotic
relationship of sorts," he said.
Casper's legacy
On Sept. 14 Casper addressed
his departure in his trademark,
tongue-in-cheek style.

had to end. and I informed tlu
trustees," he said wryly. "But b\ tin.

ton State, it was too late, and 1

Casper's combination of wit. in
tellect and dedication was soiu

"It's a real loss when someone
who's doing the remarkable job
[Casper] has been doing leaves
Zoback said. " That's a loss p.
od. I'm sure an outstanding succv
sor will be found, but nevertheless,
there is tremendous affection and
respect for President Casper among
faculty, students, and alumni."

tive Aug. 31, 2(MM), will return to
teaching at Stanford after a one
year sabbatical. However, he may
need to begin holding office hours

sooner than he expected.
"Last night, [two students] came
to my house and rang the doorbell..
. and said they wanted to talk to
me." Casper said. "I came and we
sat up on the terrace, and they want
ed to dissuade me from stepping
down.
"That students would feci that
they can do that and come directly

and express their feelings on this
was really, incredibly moving."
While Casper declined to comply
with these students' requests, his tie
sire to foster "informal interac
tions" with students during his
tenure here at Stanford has been an
aspect of his position that he consid
ers to be "very important."
"Talking to students in the main
quad, having discussions in the
dorms, doing bedtime stories, doing
Gaieties." Casper said, "all of it was
very enjoyable ... all of those as
pects have been and are very, very

satisfying."
Casper's move to teaching will
likely allow him to continue inter
acting with students. "Given the
emphasis I have placed on the cre
ation of Stanford Introductory
Studies, I shall, in the years remain
ing. devote most of my efforts to our
undergraduates."
Behind Casper's decision
Casper, who came to the I Jniver
sity in IW2. said that he "slowly
came to the conclusion to step

down, and that he has always con
sidered seven to eight years to be an
"appropriate time" for his tenure.
He said he decided to leave dur
ing the "course of this summer."
"In the last couple of years in the
fall. I looked at my situation and de
cided. 'yes. I'll do another year," and
this year. I concluded I should not."
Casper said.
"I've known that he's been think
ing about this for some time." said
Political Science Prof, and former
Provost Condolee/za Rice. "We
would muse about it often. I knew

he had an internal clock, and this
summer was his time to reflect and
decide on that."
In coming to this decision.
Casper said that he was most con
cerned with preventing a possible
"burn-out," after working in admin
istrative positions for the past 20
years.
"The important thing is that you
make sure you do not burn out,"
Casper said. "I'm not burned out
now. This is more like a fire preven
tion on my part. I want to make sure
that 1 do not burn but. and I certain
ly have detected at times signs of
weariness on my part."
While a number of Casper's col
leagues expressed surprise concern
ing what many felt to be an unex
pected announcement, Yale Uni
versity President Richard Levin, a
Stanford alumni, said, "Over the
years, I've had conversations with
him that led me to not be surprised,"
he said.
Casper cited the past 20 years
that he has spent in administrative
positions as one of the reasons for
his decision.
"I am not president of Stanford
because 1 wanted this as my career,"
he said. "I was asked whether 1
would come and be the president,
and I thought this was a great thing
to do and 1 loved doing it. I was quite
committed to doing it for as long as
made sense.
"But as 1 said. 1 have been in
leadership positions for 20 years
now, and 1 am b 1 and not getting any
younger. I would like to take a pause
and see what am I going to do for the
rest of my days at the University."

Casper spoke to a crowded room of press representatives at the
Sept. 14 meeting, where he announced his decision to step down
from the presidency next summer.

Maples Pavilion.
current biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy said that he supported
Casper's decision and understood
his desire to step down.
"Every person has to decide what
the right time is tor them," Kennedy
said. "There has to be a sense of
one's capacity and the needs of
one's family gets factored in."
Other factors
Casper informed the Board of

Trustees of his
decision at a reg
ularly scheduled
meeting on Sept.
10, during which
the trustees also
passed a resolu
tion on UCSF-
Stanford calling
for separate man-

agement of the northern and south
ern halves of UCSF-Stanford.
, Casper said the problems sur
rounding UCSF-Stanford have
"nothing to do with my decision."
He added, however, that "it
would be absolutely misleading to
say the merger hasn't been very dif
ficult at times."
Provost John Hennessy said that
"factors" such as the UCSF-Stan
ford problems could "make the
challenge in being president all the
more challenging, difficult and tir
ing."
• "[Casper] is a president who real-
Jy wants to take responsibility and
be involved in all decisions," Hen
nessy said. "He takes weight on him
self, and these sorts of challenges
could lead to shorter terms.... The
burdens of being president have ac
celerated ... and the issues sur
rounding UCSF-Stanford and the
Labor Department probably play a
factor."
Rice University Director of
Communications and Assistant to
the President Terry Shepard, Stan
ford's former director of communi

cations, said that the UCSF-Stan
ford troubles were "probably one
issue among many."
Casper's last year
Casper cited resolving the
UCSF-Stanford problems as one of
his goals for the upcoming year, as
well as working to obtain a new
General Use Permit for Stanford.
"1 also hope that we shall make
significant progress toward placing
the Center for Bioengineering, Bio
medicine and Biosciences on the
Stanford map," he said. "I shall con
tinue to do preparatory work for a
campaign for undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford. If the Board of
Trustees approves the campaign, I
hope to play a role in the fundraising
effort."
Kennedy said he felt Casper
would be facing several different is
sues this year, specifically UCSF-
Stanford, which could bear great im
portance on Stanford and other in
stitutions.
Richard Atkinson, President of
University of California, said he
looks "forward to working closely
with [Casper] in the coming months
as we address the relationship be
tween our medical centers and
many other issues of common inter
est."
Casper affirmed that there "is
much difficult work to do in the year
ahead."
"I am looking forward to it.and I
assure everyone that 'lame duck" is
not a role I have played in the past or
that I have any inclination to plav in
the future."
Reactions to the news
Many of Casper's colleagues,
both at Stanford and at peer institu
tions, regarded the news with sur
prise and sadness in seeing him go.
"1 was very saddened by his deci
sion," said Dean of Students Marc
Wais. "I think we're losing a great
president — one who has had a
tremendous impact on Stanford and
the student experience, both in and
outside of the classroom."

"He is a really terrific person and
my closest friend in the university
system," Levin said. "1 feel very sad
that he's leaving."
Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback
said that he was "completely sur
prised and somewhat shocked"
when he heard of his decision.
"I thought he was doing a re
markable job as president, and I had
no idea something like this was com
ing."
Chair of the Board of Trustees
Robert Bass said that Casper's an
nouncement came as a "surprise for
the Board of Trustees."
A Board of Trustees statement
said. "While we wish it were not so,
we respect his judgment and accept
his decision with profound gratitude
for his extraordinary leadership of
Stanford."
A number of his colleagues said
that the great amount of time and
energy he devoted to his position
was "astounding."
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya said he "under
stood [Casper's] decision," due to
the "incredible demands and the
sheer amount of energy he devoted
to the job."
"Eight years is a significant
amount of time, and lie has tireless
ly devoted it to the Stanford com
munity."
Shepard concurred.
"1 was somewhat surprised to
hear about his decision in some
ways," he said. "But he has put in
eight years and has worked incredi
bly hard. He's earned a promotion."
Praise from colleagues
In a Board of Trustees' state
ment, Casper was praised for his "in
tellectual and administrative lender
ship ... from curriculum, to faculty,
to students, to alumni, to manage
ment, to our lands and buildings,
and to the resources that will assure
Stanford's excellence for the fu
ture."
Many cited Casper's greatest suc
cess as his dedication to the im
provement of undergraduate educa

tion, and the variety of programs de
veloped under his tenure for fresh
men and sophomores.
"I particularly admired the way
in which he continued and extended
the quality of education," Kennedy
said.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
commented on Casper's legacy.
"1 believe that when we look
hack at the Casper era, we will find
that this man has left a profound
mark on Stanford, especially on un
dergraduate education."
Casper also said he considered his
focus on undergraduate education to
be his most important accomplish
ment. He added that he would want
to be remembered for "what was im
portant to him" — the most signifi
cant of which he considers to be Stan
ford Introductory Studies.
"I think SIS stands for not just
looking at the first two years of the
undergraduate experience, but it
also stands for my view of the Uni
versity," Casper said. "Students are
given an early chance to participate
in the pursuit of knowledge and are
treated as partners in it."
Wais said that felt that Casper's
dedication to "enhancing the under
graduate experience" was one of his
most important contributions to
Stanford.
"Stanford students ought to be
eternally grateful," Wais said.
"They now have the opportunity to
work with professors through re
search and seminars in their first and
second years. Casper has changed
the fabric of Stanford as a research
and teaching institution."
Montoya cited Casper's desire to
maintain student contact and his
continuing appearances in "ASSU
discussions, class officers' events,
residences, campaign stops for tree
candidates" as representative of his
"commitment to being visible."
"[Casper's] accomplishments are
endless," said Montoya. "He has
limitless energy and has instituted so
many programs for undergraduates
during his time here — it is evident
that [Casper] has made student con
tact a high priority."

Shepard lauded Casper's han
dling of the indirect cost scandal
when he initially entered his posi
tion in 1992.
"[Casper] had a tough situation
to come into in 1992," Shepard said.
"It's hard to describe how dire
things appeared then, and how he
brought calm and confidence and
set about the situation. He proved in
the end that all the scare headlines
weren't true."
Shepard also said that Casper's
focus on Stanford's "identity" helped
to mold the institution as a whole.
"[Casper] helped Stanford redis
cover its history, as he applied
lessons to current times, which gave
Stanford a sense of its history and
gave it identity as an institution. He
has had success on so many fronts,"
Shepard said.
Robert Berdahl, chancellor of
UC-Berkeley, where Casper spent
two years as an assistant professor of
political science, said, "I have had
the great privilege of working with
Gerhard Casper in sister institutions
for well over a decade ... The entire
higher education community is
going to miss his leadership."
Future plans
After a one-year sabbatical fol
lowing this year, Casper plans on re
turning as a professor to the Stan
ford campus, where he would like to
engage himself in undergraduate
education.
Hugo Sonnenschein, president of
the University of Chicago, where
Casper was provost from 1989 to
1992 and dean of Chicago's Law
School from 1979 to 1987, said that
Casper would affect undergraduate
education in "a different way"
through his role as a professor.
"Through teaching, he will pow
erfully influence the institution, and
will continue to be a very important
presence in students' lives," Son
nenschein said.
The upcoming search
According to Bass, the search for
Casper's successor is in very prelimi

nary stages at this point. Bass will
begin the process by appointing a
search committee, consisting of a
combination of trustees, faculty
members, students, alumni and staff.
The search committee then will
"advertise for the position and seek
input from numerous sources."
"We'll develop a list of folders of
names suggested and then narrow
down the list," Bass said. "The
search committee will wrestle with
all sorts of issues in the process."
Casper was only one of two pres
idents brought in from other institu
tions. Bass said that it was "too pre
mature" to tell who within the Uni
versity would be interested.
"The president can come from
the inside or the outside," Bass said.
"We look for the most qualified in
dividual.
Kennedy said that he thinks "the
provost will be looked at hard by any
one who's thinking about a succes
sor."
"You can expect an intense focus
on [Hennessy]. He'll either be a
first-year president or a second-year
provost."
Hennessy said he had not given
the matter any consideration, and
that he is "focusing on the upcoming
year and planning for that."
Bass said that he expected to
have Casper's successor chosen
near the end of this academic year.
A time of transition
This past year has brought a vari
ety of new individuals to Stanford's
top posts in its academic schools and
administration. With Casper leaving
the next year, the University will
have a relatively new administra
tion.
History Prof. Mark Mancall said
that he feels such a cycle is "nor
mal."
"It is essential for the health of
the institution — the president has
to have a provost with whom he or
she can work — the provost has to
serve as a transition from one presi-


Bass
dent to the other, so it's a symbiotic
relationship of sorts," he said.
Casper's legacy
On Sept. 14 Casper addressed
his departure in his trademark,
tongue-in-cheek style.
"After the Texas football game.
I concluded mv tenure at Stanford
had to end. and I informed tlu
trustees," he said wryly. "But b\ tin.
time we had won against Washing
ton State, it was too late, and 1
couldn't go hack on my decision.
Casper's combination of wit. in
tellect and dedication was soiu
thing many said they would miss.
"It's a real loss when someone
who's doing the remarkable job
[Casper] has been doing leaves
Zoback said. " That's a loss p.
od. I'm sure an outstanding succv
sor will be found, but nevertheless,
there is tremendous affection and
respect for President Casper among
faculty, students, and alumni."
