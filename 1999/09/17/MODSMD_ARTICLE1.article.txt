# Casper to leave presidency next August
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Gerhard Casper, who an
nounced on Sept. 14 that he will step
down as University president effec
tive Aug. 31, 2(MM), will return to
teaching at Stanford after a one
year sabbatical. However, he may
need to begin holding office hours

sooner than he expected.
"Last night, [two students] came
to my house and rang the doorbell..
. and said they wanted to talk to
me." Casper said. "I came and we
sat up on the terrace, and they want
ed to dissuade me from stepping
down.
"That students would feci that
they can do that and come directly

and express their feelings on this
was really, incredibly moving."
While Casper declined to comply
with these students' requests, his tie
sire to foster "informal interac
tions" with students during his
tenure here at Stanford has been an
aspect of his position that he consid
ers to be "very important."
"Talking to students in the main
quad, having discussions in the
dorms, doing bedtime stories, doing
Gaieties." Casper said, "all of it was
very enjoyable ... all of those as
pects have been and are very, very

satisfying."
Casper's move to teaching will
likely allow him to continue inter
acting with students. "Given the
emphasis I have placed on the cre
ation of Stanford Introductory
Studies, I shall, in the years remain
ing. devote most of my efforts to our
undergraduates."
Behind Casper's decision
Casper, who came to the I Jniver
sity in IW2. said that he "slowly
came to the conclusion to step

down, and that he has always con
sidered seven to eight years to be an
"appropriate time" for his tenure.
He said he decided to leave dur
ing the "course of this summer."
"In the last couple of years in the
fall. I looked at my situation and de
cided. 'yes. I'll do another year," and
this year. I concluded I should not."
Casper said.
"I've known that he's been think
ing about this for some time." said
Political Science Prof, and former
Provost Condolee/za Rice. "We
would muse about it often. I knew

he had an internal clock, and this
summer was his time to reflect and
decide on that."
In coming to this decision.
Casper said that he was most con
cerned with preventing a possible
"burn-out," after working in admin
istrative positions for the past 20
years.
"The important thing is that you
make sure you do not burn out,"
Casper said. "I'm not burned out
now. This is more like a fire preven
tion on my part. I want to make sure
that 1 do not burn but. and I certain
ly have detected at times signs of
weariness on my part."
While a number of Casper's col
leagues expressed surprise concern
ing what many felt to be an unex
pected announcement, Yale Uni
versity President Richard Levin, a
Stanford alumni, said, "Over the
years, I've had conversations with
him that led me to not be surprised,"
he said.
Casper cited the past 20 years
that he has spent in administrative
positions as one of the reasons for
his decision.
"I am not president of Stanford
because 1 wanted this as my career,"
he said. "I was asked whether 1
would come and be the president,
and I thought this was a great thing
to do and 1 loved doing it. I was quite
committed to doing it for as long as
made sense.
"But as 1 said. 1 have been in
leadership positions for 20 years
now, and 1 am b 1 and not getting any
younger. I would like to take a pause
and see what am I going to do for the
rest of my days at the University."
