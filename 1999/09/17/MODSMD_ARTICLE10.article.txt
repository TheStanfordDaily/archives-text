### Kimherly Downs Editorial staff 
Senior Shauna Harrison, a col
lege assistant in Stanford's new
Freshman / Sophomore College,
can't wait for her residents to ar
rive.
"We are all really excited to put
our planning into action," said
Harrison, who is helping organize
field trips and social events for the
105 freshmen and 75 sophonntttes
who are moving into Sterling Quad
this weekend.
The Freshman / Sophomore
College is Stanford's first attempt
at a two-year residence-based aca
demic program.
It is part of a recent trend to
ward strengthening ties between
faculty and undergraduates and
developing the academic interests
of first- and second-year students.
The college will connect resi
dential life with the mentoring and
academic activities offered
through Stanford Introductory
Studies courses, which include In
troduction to the Humanities,
Freshman and Sophomore Semi
nars, the Science. Mathematics and
Engineering Core and Writing and
Critical Thinking.
College residents will have pri
ority for Freshman and Sopho
more Seminars held in their dorms,
and will have the chance to partic
ipate in study groups organized
around common courses and in
workshops on summer employ
ment.
Four Introduction to the Hu
manities seminars will also be held
in the College.
"We're trying first and foremost
to enhance the quality and quanti
ty of interaction that students have
with faculty in their undergraduate
years," said John Bravman. vice
provost for undergraduate educa
tion.
Bravman has found affiliates for
the college among Stanford's facul
ty.
He described the affiliates as
"people that I can count on to be
part of the intellectual life of the
college."
Bravman intends to hold two to
three functions a week within the
College that affiliates, students and
other members of the faculty may
attend.
He also intends to hold dinners
at his house across the street from
Sterling Quad in order to meet all
of the participants in Freshman /
Sophomore College.
Bravman expressed concern
about assisting sophomores in de
ciding on their major, one of the
most important decisions in their
college careers, he said.
"We want to help sophomores
find ways to think about their acad
emic goals," he said.

Sophomore Leah Riggins is
looking forward to this aspect of
the program.
"One reason I chose to partic
ipate in the College is that it is sup
posed to 'facilitate the process of
selecting a major,' " she said. "My
hope is that academic exploration
within the residential setting will
help me to decide what to do with
the rest of my time at Stanford."
She and her fellow sophomores
TMfticfptArinir m the program will
have the opportunity to share their
experiences in selecting a major
through the Sterling Scholars pro
gram 011 speaking skills. It will
focus on improving oral presenta
tion skills and culminate in a
spring-quarter symposium on in
tellectual and academic explo
ration.
A hope for the College is that
sophomores will be able to act as
mentors to the freshmen.
Sophomore Flissa Port is look
ing forward to this role.
"My draw group and I decided
that freshmen add a lot of excite
ment to dorm life." she said.
"Therefore, we all love the idea of
living with, and getting to know, a
portion of the freshman class."
Riggins echoed this enthusiasm.
"I actually look forward to living
with freshmen. Last year was defi
nitely a good experience, but some
advice from upperclassmcn would
have been useful. This year, my
dormmates and I will have the op
portunity to help new students ad
just to life at Stanford."
Harrison hopes to make the
first-year program a memorable
experience.
"I think that with the energy and
creativeness of our staff we can
offer out residents a new twist to
residential life," said I larrison.
Bravman is excited as well to get
the year off to a start.
He said that the College will be
a work in progress for a couple of
years and that he will look forward
to student input as to how he and
the staff of Sophomore College can
best serve the needs of freshmen
and sophomores.
Riggins is looking forward to
this role.
"I think it will be fun to help de
sign the program ourselves," she
said. "There is some allure to being
the first group to do this."
The College, which is being
housed in the Adams and Schiff
dormitories in Sterling Quad, was
planned to have 90 freshmen and
90 sophomores, but these figures
were revised when ISO freshmen
listed the college as their first
choice for housing and only 60
sophomores did the same.
The high demand from fresh
men to live in the college excluded
the possibility of transfers being
housed there.
