# Soph College hits snag
## Ever-expanding program too large for some 
### Anitha Reddy Contributing writer 
The rapidly expanding
Sophomore College may have
grown too big for its own good.
This year's College class of
3K4 students was the largest ever, a
size that some University adminis
trators say may have detracted from

its small-group atmosphere.
The increased size of the College, which grew from
27 classes last year to 36 this year, has created logistical
problems for an administration striving to retain the in
timacy and intellectual climate of previous years. Ad
ministrators are seriously considering reducing the size
of the program.
"A clear consensus has arisen between the provost,
the president and the deans that Sophomore College is
not going to grow/' Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman said.
There was a growing consensus the program should
slightly contract and that size issues created tension be
tween the academic goals of the program and some stu
dents' desire for more social events, he said.
Unlike last year, when Stern Hall and Toyon Hall
housed students, this year's students were housed in
four residences: Wilbur Hall. Stern, Toyon and Sterling
Quad.
"The rationale for splitting up the students was to try
to regain the intimacy of earlier sophomore colleges,"
said Sharon Palmer, director of freshman and sopho
more programs.
Despite efforts of administrators to emphasize each
dorm as an individual intellectual community, a few stu

dents planned a party for all sophomore college partic
ipants. Originally scheduling the party for the Toyon
lounge, organizers e-mailed the sophomore college list
and asked students to donate money toward alcohol,
food and decorations.
The students cancelled the party after meeting with
Palmer.
"She said we're adults and we could do what we
chose, but she strongly advised against having the
party," said one student involved with the party who
wished to remain anonymous. "She said she was not
threatening us. but later she said. '1 guess I am trying to
scare you.'"
"There were no provisions for security, it was adver
tised online and during sophomore college students are
guests of the University. Also, unlike the regular year,
there is no staff," Palmer said.
After explaining to the students that they would be
liable for any damages or incidences ol underage drink
ing, they decided to cancel the party, she said.
"It just didn't seem in keeping with the intellectual
spirit of sophomore college." Palmer added.
"As Sophomore College expands, it inevitably starts
to include people who aren't so in tune with the goals of
the College." said Wendy Wright, assistant director of
the College in Wilbur Hall. Wright was a student in the
first Sophomore College in 1995.
"Students actually e-mailed me saying that they
couldn't recommend this program to freshman due to
the lack of social activities," Bravman said. "It's not our
goal to have a balanced academic and social experience.
It is designed to be an intellectually intense experience.
"Issues of alcohol and responsibility are more likely
