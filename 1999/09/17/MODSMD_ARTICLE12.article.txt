# Construction faces mixed success
## Coffee House still not finished, other projects fare better 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
The 1.700 freshmen who arrive
on campus today will find one of
Stanford's most popular student
hangouts eerily quiet.
The Stanford Coffee House will
stay closed for at least two months
due to a construction project origi
nally scheduled to next
week.
Coffee House managers said in
August that, despite summer de
lays, the project was scheduled to
open on Sept. 20.
"Hie delays have been caused
by the lengthy permitting process,"
said Julie Skelton, the manager of
the construction project.
Skelton said the Coffee I louse is
"a breath away" from getting the
permit. C'onstruction, which should
last about 60 days, should begin in
the next lew days.
Other summer construction
projects fared better.
Crews have renovated four
houses on Lake Lagunita: Lambda
Nu, Kappa Alpha, Enchanted
Broccoli Forest and Narnia.
Sixty-three additional graduate
student mid-rise apartments that
have been seismically retrofitted
have been completed in Escondido
Village.
In both cases, construction
ended on schedule and the resi
dences are ready for occupancy as
the school year begins and students
arrive on campus.
Construction is also underway
on three new building sites in Es
condido.

"We had a pretty good summer,
and the beginning construction is
off to a good start."' said Rodger
Whitney, the director of Student
I lousing Services.
Workers will finish the first site
by September 2000, and the other
two will be finished the following
December.
Casa Italiana and 680 Lomita
"gained di<!Tfrilitf fltecss. and crews
remodeled and painted Cro.thers
Hall.
"We're very proud of all that's
happened in housing this summer,"
Whitney said.
In Sterling Quad, workers
added a new grill to Ricker Dining,
which should "improve the quality
of dining," Whitney said.
The grill is part of a large-scale
effort to ready Sterling Quad for
the new Freshman / Sophomore
College. " There are a number of
things we're doing to make the pro
gram successful," Whitney said.
Construction projects on Cam
pus Drive near Cowell Student
Health Center and on Escondido
Road also aim to be completed by
the time students arrive, and both
projects are running on schedule.
Sidewalks along Escondido
Road also underwent heavy con
struction during the summer, and
Whitney said "the word we're get
ting is that these projects will be
closed and ready for a normal
opening."
Kelly Rohlfs, project manager
for several other construction
works, said Scrra Mall construction
between Lasuen Mall and Lomita
Mall is on schedule and will be

open Sept. 17.
She added that work on Lomita,
between Serra Mall and Via
Pueblo, has just begun and will fin
ish Nov. 30.

Her third project is Serra Grove,
between the Science and Enegi
neering Quad and Serra Mall,
which crews should complete by
the end of October.
