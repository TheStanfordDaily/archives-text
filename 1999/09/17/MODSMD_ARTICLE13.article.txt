# Earthquake-safety strides pay off
## Ten years after Loma Prieto quake, University better prepared 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
On Oct. 17, Stanford and the rest
of the Bay Area will celebrate the
10th anniversary of the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake, which measured
an impressive 7.1 on the Richter
scale.
Since then, Stanford has in
creased efforts to promote aware
ness of earthquakes and earthquake
safety procedures. Each student is
given a "Be 'Quake Safe' at Stan
ford" brochure upon moving into
residences, developed hv Stanford
Environmental Health and Safety.
In the introduction, Keith Guv.
director of Housing and Dining Ser
vices. writes, "Now that you live in
earthquake country, you need to
think deliberately and frequently
about what to do when the next

quake occurs."
Roni Gordon, a University
health and safety specialist, ex
plained that the "Quake-Safe"
brochure is divided into three sec
tions — preparedness, response, and
recovery — the steps to take when
dealing with disasters and emergen
cies.
By following the preparedness,
response and recovery procedures,
each student should take responsi
bility for his or her own safety, Gor
don said.
Preparedness involves making
sure dorm rooms are safe and exits
are clear. Non-structural hazards,
such as falling heavy objects and fur
niture. can cause as many injuries as
structural damage.
Response involves being aware
of the "duck and cover" procedure,
which is outlined in the "Quake

Safe" brochure.
"Standing in doorways is no
longer recommended." Gordon
said.
After the emergency, recovery
involves knowing how to avoid haz
ards and where and how to report
damage and injuries.
On the back of each earthquake
safety brochure and printed in cam
pus directories and almanacs are
"Emergency Wallet Cards," which
provide basic safety information for
earthquakes and other emergencies.
They contain emergency phone
numbers and instructions and tell
how to obtain and report informa
tion.
Another major feature of the
University's safety plan is the collec
tion of Emergency Assembly Points.
"There are signposts all over cam
pus to mark new EAPs," Gordon

said. Assembly points are marked by
a blue triangle enclosed in a white
circle.
"Residential staff will be dis
cussing earthquake and fire safety
during the lirst house meetings of
the quarter.
Also, the police department has
been responsible for conducting
emergency 'drills' to familiarize stu
dents with the locations of the Emer
gency Assembly Points and to dis
cuss how people should respond iji
the event of fire or earthquakes;'
Guy said.
A new Web site is also being dC
veloped. The site will be "a tremen
dous addition for those who are. not
on campus." said Gordon.
This site will provide emergency
information and updates on cons-,
tions at Stanford after a disaster
curs.
