# Flailing Floyd buffets Northeast

### 
MONTAUK, N.Y. (AP) — Cre
ating havoc even at half-strength.
Tropical Storm Floyd raced into the
Northeast with gusty winds and
drenching rain Thursday, grounding
hundreds of flights, closing school for
3 million students, even postponing a
IJ.N. meeting on war.
Its winds falling below hurricane
force to 65 mph by evening, Floyd
headed for Long Island and New
England after rolling through the
Carolinas in the morning.
At least seven deaths have been
blamed on Floyd, six from traffic ac
cidents in the Carolinas and one man
presumed drowned in the Bahamas.
While still a hurricane, Floyd
drilled ashore at Cape Fear, N.C.,
knocking out power to more than 1.4
million in the Carolinas and flooding
highways and basements with more
than a foot of rain. But damage to
buildings was modest.
"We're most fortunate," said
George Lemons, a National Weather
Service forecaster in Raleigh. N.C.
From there, Floyd's winds weak
ened steadily to less than half its fear
some peak of 155 mph. The mini
mum wind speed for a hurricane is 74
mph.
At 5 p.m. ED'T. the storm was 10
miles south of Atlantic City. N.J.,
moving north-northeast at nearly 30
mph.
But even the gentler Floyd was
threat enough for New York and
New Jersey authorities, who declared
states of emergency. Public schools
were closed in Washington. Balti
more. all of New Jersey, Philadelphia
and New York City — a part of the
country more accustomed to snow
days.
Il was the first time anyone could
recall all schools in New Jersey and

New York City closing because of a
hurricane.
The wind set a Ferris wheel spin
ning on its own at Ocean City, Mil,
and overturned an empty truck on
the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. New
York City sent its municipal employ
ees home early, urged business to
close and shut down the upper deck
of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.
Hundreds of airline flights were
canceled along the East Coast,
grounding tens of thousands of pas
sengers. Amtrak suspended all train
service south of Washington, and ser
vice farther north was disrupted by a
mudslide and fallen trees. Ferry ser
vice was canceled from Cape Cod to
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.
"The message is. don't fool with
Mother Nature," said New York City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone.
"Stay home if you can."
The New York Stock Exchange
stuck to regular hours, but the I I.N.
Security C'ouncil suspended its delib
erations at 2 p.m. and postponed a
meeting on protecting civilians in war
zones. U.N. officials said it was the
first time in recent history that a for
mal. open meeting of the Security
("ouncil was derailed by bad weather.
On the eastern end of Long Is
land. directly in the storm's projected
path, residents made last-minute runs
for flashlights and emergency sup
plies and hammered plywood over
windows.
It was expected to be Long Is
land's harshest storm since Septem
ber 1985. when Hurricane Gloria
caused an estimated SI3O million in
damage and knocked out power to
750.000 homes and businesses.
" They're getting panicky," said
I iarold I lerbert of I lei b's Market in
Montauk, on the easternmost tip of

Long Island, as his customers lined
up lor batteries, water, ice and cold
cuts. "I don't think this hurricane isas
had as some of them."
Authorities ordered the evacua
tion of Fire Island, off the south coast
of Long Island, but not all its 2.(KK)
residents obeyed.
Dave l eraro, armed with candles,
flashlights, batteries and a cell phone,
hunkered down with his wife in their
l ire Island home a mere 150 feet
from the white-capped Atlantic.
"I'm going to ride this one out."
said Feraro, who risked a ticket for ig
noring the order.
In Atlantic City, N.J., the Miss
America Pageant had no immediate
plans to curtail Saturday's indoor
pageant, but city officials feared the
storm might force them to cancel Fri
day's pageant parade.

The Pentagon said <S.(KK) members
of the National Guard in Florida,
Georgia. South Carolina, North Car
olina and Virginia were mobilized to
help communities recover from Hur
ricane Floyd. National Guardsmen in
Delaware, New Jersey and New
York were put on alert.
Nowhere along the Atlantic coast
did Floyd strike as hard as it did in the
Bahamas. Authorities there Finally
got to assess the damage Thursday
and said hundreds of homes were
flattened and roofless on several is
lands. Thousands of people faced the
prospect of weeks without telephone,
electricity or reliable water service.
"The trees were skinned like ba
nanas," said Michelle Rolle, a resi
dent of Abaco, an island in the Ba
hamas. 'This hurricane was by far the
worst we've seen."
