### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
Overseas Studies
is greatly expand
ing its Latin
American pres
ence this year with
a new program in
Buenos Aires, Ar
gentina, and an

». extension of its Santiago, Chile
• program through spring quarter.
The program also reopens the
Moscow program this fall, one year
after it was suspended due to the
l>economic crisis in Russia.
*S. The Buenos Aires program
joins Latin American programs in
'• Santiago and Puebla, Mexico. As in
the Puebla program, participants
'. will study at a local university, in
*' this case the Universidad Torcuato
*. di Telia, founded in 1991.
\ "This is an opportunity for stu
\ dents to get in on the ground floor

of something new, because the in
stitution itself is so new," said Lucia
Hammar, academic program offi
cer for Overseas Studies. She said
that she and others who traveled to
the site were impressed with the
quality of academics at the Argen
tine university.
The program runs during spring

quarter and al
lows up to 15
Stanford stu
dents to take a
modified version
of the Argentine
university's aca
demic offerings
in order to fit
into Stanford's

quarter-based academic calendar.
Course offerings will focus on po
litical science, international rela
tions, economics and Argentine
culture.
Hammar said that Buenos Aires
and the Puebla program, started in

January 1998, provide new oppor
tunities to interact more closely
with students overseas.
"Stanford students are really in
terested in getting to know local
students," she said.
Overseas Studies hopes that stu
dents interested in Latin America
will design study programs that in
corporate time in two or even three
of the programs.
"The three programs are struc
tured to provide quite distinct
learning opportunities in very dif
ferent cultures," said Russell
Berman, director of the Overseas
Studies Program.
The Santiago program has the
fewest language requirements and
is located in Stanford's own over
seas center, while the Puebla and
Buenos Aires programs require
greater Spanish language profi
ciency but allow immediate inte
gration into overseas communities.
Berman said.
