# Parking changes down road
## Marguerite expands, frosh enjoy last year with cars 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
If the free parking that sprouted up near the center of
campus this summer seemed too good to last. well, it
was. Free two-hour parking spaces in the Tresidder lot,
created this summer during renovations, will vanish as
construction ends.
But not all of the news coming out of Parking and
Transportation Services is had. The Marguerite Mid
night Express bus service, which is free to users, will have
expanded service this year, running until midnight on
weekdays and until 2:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
In addition, new "C" class parking for commuters will be
created on Panama Street near Roble Field, on land
once used for tennis courts.
Perhaps the most significant parking event this year,
at least for freshmen, is actually a non-event.
This will be the last incoming class of freshmen who
will have the undisputed right to permit parking at their
residence during their first year. The I Jniversity has de
cided not to allow freshmen to park on campus next
year, unless thev can demonstrate that they need a car.

perhaps because of a medical condition or an off-campus
job.
The University hasn't decided under exactly what cir
cumstances freshmen might qualify for an exemption
and what process they will have to go through to get one.
"We haven't gotten that far yet." said Susan Law,
parking and transit operations coordinator, adding that
a committee might be formed to study the issue this year.
The Tresidder lot is being divided into two lots, with
the goal of making the crosswalk in the middle safer for
pedestrians. "A" class parking will be separated from
visitor pay parking, which will be upgraded with pay ma
chines rather than meters, allowing credit card payments
for parking.
For those who just won't be satisfied without some
free parking news, there's even some of that in the mix
this year: the department will continue a program start
ed last year that offers limited free residential-class park
ing on a space-available basis in locations far from the
center of campus on Bowdoin St. (East Campus) and
Searsville Rd. (West Campus).
Those permits are intended to reduce central campus
congestion.
