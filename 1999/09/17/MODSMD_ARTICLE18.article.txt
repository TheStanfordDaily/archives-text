# Housing, open space to be in land-use plan
## 
### Evan Nordby Senior staff writer 
Stanford's new land-use plan
will include "lots of housing" and
some protections for open space in
the foothills when it is released
Monday.
When the University releases its
new general use permit and com
munity plan Monday, it "will be
coming in for lots of housing" for
graduate students, faculty, post
doctorate fellows and hospital resi
dents, said Larry Horton. Universi
ty director of community and gov
ernment relations.
The University is also planning
for growth in academic facilities,
especially in information technolo
gy and interdisciplinary scientific
research, Horton said.
Santa Clara County planners
recommended in a report Sept. 2
that Stanford include new, high
density housing in Escondido Vil
lage for "all graduate students and
post-doctorate fellows who wish to
live on the campus."
To encourage on-campus hous
ing construction, housing might be
exempted from caps on new cam
pus building square footage includ
ed in the general use permit.
For open space protection, the
county also recommended that
Stanford divide its lands into three
areas — an area within an "acade
mic growth boundary" roughly
along Junipero Serra Boulevard
for u'lvp' ii-velopnv'nt: an area
outside the boundary solely for
uses such as water reservoirs, radio
antennas and other "low-intensity"
uses: and completely protected
"cnviromentally sensitive" areas.
"I'm hoping that Stanford will
follow the recommendations of the
county," said Denice Dade. Santa
Clara County legislative advocate
for the Committee for Green
Foothills.
The plan, written over the past
year by Stanford planners with
input from the public and Santa
Clara ('ounty. will govern Stanford
development lor the next 10 years
if the county approves it.
Since 1%2. Stanford develop
ment has been governed bv a suc
cession of general use permits. The
permits have limited building
square footage, parking spaces and
other development on the Stanford
central campus and have sharply
restricted development in the
foothills. But tliev have allowed

Stanford considerable leeway for
development.
Some area residents have been
concerned with the free rein Stan
ford seemed to have under the old
permits.
"Areas that we thought were
going to be developed as parks are
now earmarked for housing," said
Sandra Pearson, a member of the
Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders association at a coun
ty planning commission meeting in
January.
To address those concerns,
Stanford held community forums
on housing, transportation, open
space preservation and academic
trends over the summer to gather
input while drafting the plan.
"There were useful suggestions
made," Horton said, "and we've
tried to incorporate them into our
plan."
Perhaps the largest community
concern is open space. The unde
veloped two-thirds of Stanford's
8,200 acres is the largest area of
open land in the area. Stanford has
received kudos from many local
residents for its stewardship of the
foothills.
Many area residents would like
Stanford to permanently dedicate
the foothills to open space. But
University officials are bound by
the terms of the Founding Grant to
devote land only to "the founda
tion and maintenance of the Uni
versity."
Norton told the Stanford Re
port in July that the open-space
protections the University would
offer would last "at least as long" as
the period covered by the next
General Use Permit.
Dade said that this sort of long
term planning should last longer
than 10 or 15 years.
Once a community plan is in
place, she said, it should be "the
foundation of what future develop
ment will look like — not easily
changed."
"Why couldn't [open space] be
considered good academic plan
ning?" Dade asked, referring to the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve
as an example. Plus, she said "es
tablishing a beautiful backdrop for
your university makes sense."
The first of a series of public
hearings on the new plan is sched
uled for 6:30 p.m. Sept. 29 at the
Cubberley Community Center
Multi-Purpose Room, 4000 Mid
dlcficld Road, Palo Alto.
