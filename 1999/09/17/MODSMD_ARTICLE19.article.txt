# Frosh bond over Stoppard's 'Arcadia'
## 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
Building from the modest success
of the program's first year, the
Freshman Book Program is bringing
playwright and Academy Award
winning screenwriter Tom Stoppard
to campus in January.
Freshmen will be invited to read
Stoppard's play "Arcadia." The plav
examines the nature of reality by
tackling themes such as truth. New
tonian physics, literature, math
ematics and"the disruptive influ
ence of sex on our orbits," according
to Amazon.com.
Now in its second year, the Fresh
man Book Program gives every
freshman a copy of a work during
fall quarter and brings the author to
address students.
"I think it's a rare opportunity
notjusttoread a book but to also en
gage the writer," said Assoc. Prof.
Harry Elam, director of the Area

One Program.
Cheryl Ross, associate director of
the Area One Program, said that
"one of the purposes of this program
is to give a unifying book to the
freshman class for them to have
something to share."
According to Elam. the work was
chosen to encourage freshmen to
think about some of the themes of
Area One: culture, civilization and
the essence of humanity.
"We want them to do that not in
the classroom but to engage the
work on their own." said Elam.
Last year, the inaugural program
brought Charles Johnson, author of
"Middle Passage," to campus. Win
ner of the 1990 National Book
Award. "Middle Passage" traces the
literal and philosophical journey of a
free black man who stows away on a
slave ship bound for Africa in the
early 18(K)s.
Though Elam considered the
program a modest success, others.

particularly students, believed it was
disorganized and the author's visit
not well publicized.
"I didn't go to see the speaker,"
said sophomore Tim Cao. "They
were not clear in their direction of
the program."
Sophomore Rohan Radhakrish
na agreed. "The -Hum TAs just
threw the book at us and said free
book'."
Some believe the timing of the
book program could improve.
"'['here is just too much happen
ing fall quarter. No one wants to
read an extra book." said sopho
more Anjali Patel.
According to Ross, the Area One
Program is aware of the problems
last year and is taking measures to
rectify them.
"The organization of the pro
gram is definitely different this
year," she said. "We had a whole
training program for the fellows who
teach I-Hum. They all know about

the book, the author and how to in
corporate the work into the curricu
lum."
Area One coordinators also
spoke to freshman advisors and en
couraged them to discuss the book
with their advisees, said Ross.
With or without better coordina
tion. some students believe the suc
cess of "Shakespeare in Love," for
which Stoppard won his Academy
Award, will draw much attention to
the book program.
"Many people have read Shake
speare in high school and are drawn
to things Shakespearean. This is
something that a lot of people are in
terested in," Radhakrishna said of
this year's book and author.
"If it's the writer of 'Shakespeare
in Love." I'll come," said Patel.
Stoppard is scheduled to address
students on Jan. 10 at 7 p.m., at a lo
cation to be determined. All stu
dents and staff of Stanford are wel
come.
