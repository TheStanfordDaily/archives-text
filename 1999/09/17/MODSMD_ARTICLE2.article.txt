Karen Sawisiak savages the Uni
versity's tenure process in an op

Sawisiak wrote,
"I do not think it
is possible for
such an evalua
tion to proceed
with any sort of
real fairness or
objectivity.

The Chronicle published Uni
versity documents from Sawis
lak's tenure battle on its Web site.
chronicle.com. The documents,
published for the first time, show
that virtually all outside assess
ments of Sawislak's scholarship,
teaching and mentorship put her
in the top of her profession.
"You're lucky to have her."
wrote one professor.
lop University officials de
clined to comment on the piece.
Sawisiak was denied tenure in
the spring of 1997, and appealed
over a series of problems in her
tenure process. A faculty advisory
board recommended in January

that University President Gerhard
Casper grant her tenure outright,
but Casper only offered her the op
portunity to come hack and go
through the tenure process again
ill is year.
She announced in May that she
would not return and instead en
rolled in law school at UC-Berke
lev this fall.
Sawislak focused on a state
ment in Casper's letter offering her
another chance at tenure, relating
it to a systemic gender bias in Uni
versity hiring and promotion al
leged in two recent complaints to
the U.S. Department of Labor.
"1 particularly disagree with the
advisory board majority's sugges
tion that, if the dean decides to re
ject the recommendation of the de
partment and the school's appoint
ments and promotions committee,
the burden ol proof somehow
shifts to the dean to demonstrate
that he has 'compelling' reasons to
do so," Casper wrote.

Sawislak wrote, "How can a
great university ... decide the
question of who warrants promo
tion in a way that seems like so
much hocus-pocus?
"Stanford administrators swear
up and down ... that their tenure
process is fair. I think they sincere
ly believe that. But how can the
rest of us be sure?"
Sawislak is part of a group com
plaint to the Office of Federal Con
tract Compliance Programs, a divi
sion of the U.S. Department of
Labor, alleging systemic gender
discrimination bv Stanford in hir
ing and promotion including
tenure.
From an initial group of seven
last fall, the number of com
plainants has grown to 30.
She also has an individual com
plaint filed against the University
with the Equal Employment Op
portunity Commission. Both in
vestigations are ongoing.
