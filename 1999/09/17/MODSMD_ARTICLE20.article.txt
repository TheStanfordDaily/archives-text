# Stanford drops while CalTech tops U.S. News rankings
## 
### Jed Rose Contributing writer 
In what has become the ranking
system that most universities love to
hate, U.S. News and World Report
has introduced a new formula for
the ranking of undergraduate
schools.
Stanford took a respectable sixth
place on the annual totem pole. But
it is a far cry from the first-place po
sition the University once held
when U.S. News and World Report
rankings were first introduced.
Stanford dropped two places
from its fourth-ranked position last
year.
Robert Kinnally, dean of under
graduate admissions, attributed
Stanford's shift in the rankings this
year to the method that U.S. News
employs for determining the overall
score. "They have to keep changing
it because they have to sell maga
zines." said Kinnally.
In addition to the yearly under
graduate college rankings, U.S.
News also has specialty rankings re
leased each year within their special
college issue. Stanford placed

among the top five for "best value"
for an undergraduate education, a
category in which Stanford was first
last year.
Since 19%, Stanford has held the
first-place position for overall un
dergraduate engineering programs,
but this year, the University placed
second to MH".
Another Year, Another Method
With Stanford posting improve
ments in many fields, some expected
Stanford's rating to improve.
However, U.S. News' ranking
method this year incorporated a
new factor: "standardization." This
was seen as the major reason for
large fluctuations in the rankings
this year, such as the California In
stitute of Technology moving from
ninth to first.
This new aspect of school evalua
tion examined how much a school
spends on each student. U.S. News
does not report any specific num
bers for Stanford's expenditure per
student in its magazine edition.
CalTech's total undergraduate
population is less than the size of a

single graduating class at Stanford,
so incorporating "standardization"
could give CalTech an advantage
over universities of comparable size
to Stanford.
By The Numbers
One factor that has remained
consistent in its method throughout
the lifetime of the U.S. News rank
ing methodology is the reputation
score.
Stanford has consistently placed
first in a peer-evaluation from uni
versities across the nation.
"We get a lot of press in a lot of
different arenas, through the
Hoover Institution, other think
tanks and through our athletic pro
grams." Kinnally cited.
Academic reputation carried the
greatest weight (25 percent) in the
U.S. News ranking formula because
the magazine took into account that
a diploma from a distinguished col
lege helps graduates get good jobs
or gain admission to top graduate
programs. A school's reputation
was determined by surveying the
presidents, provosts and deans of

admission at different institutions.
Each individual was asked to rate
peer schools' academic programs on
a scale from one (marginal) to five
(distinguished).
This year. Stanford tied for first
place honors again, with a ranking
of 4.9 out of a maximum of 5. This is
a distinction shared only with Har
vard and MIT.
Areas of improvement that are
reported in this year's rankings for
Stanford include: a student-to-faeul
ty ratio that dropped from 15 to 1 to
7 to 1. a record-low acceptance rate
and a record-high yield (the ratio of
students who enroll to those admit
ted).
The sharp change in the student
to-faculty results from more
changes in the way U.S. News gath
ers its data from universities.
The ranking of undergraduate
schools has been protested by many,
ranging from student groups to
Stanford faculty to President
Casper. From the perspective of
many universities, getting rid of the
subjective formula that U.S. News
