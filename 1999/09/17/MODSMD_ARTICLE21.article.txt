# After a decade, West Wing of Green to reopen
## 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
After 10 years of renovation following the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the new Green
Library west wing, or Bing Wing, will officially
open to the public in mid-October.
The Bing Wing, named after University
benefactors Peter and Helen Bing, has been
open to use by students and other patrons since
the Aug. 2 "soft opening."
"We are very excited to finally be opening
[Green West] up," Deputy University Librarian
Karen Nagy said in an August interview. "After
such a long wait. I wouldn't be lying to say that
we are ready to use the new building."
During the earthquake in 1989, Green West,
which opened in 1919, experienced major seis
mic damage, necessitating a decade-long clo
sure.
The resulting $5()-million reconstruction
project, funded in part by the Federal Emer
gency Management Agency, has transformed
the historic West Wing both externally and in
ternally.
Additionally, the other Green wing, now
called Green Library East, has been redone to
improve service.
Students, faculty and other library visitors
will find new technology resources, several
study areas and tours and orientation sessions in
the Bing Wing.
The first floor of the five-story building is
home to the Social Sciences Resource Center,
which holds social science reference materials,
and the Jonsson Collection of Government
Documents.
On the second floor, there is a Humanities
and Area Studies Resource Center and there
are reading rooms for the University's special
collections and archives.
Offices for technical processing and library
friends and donors are found on the third and
fourth floors, in addition to more reading

rooms.
Finally, the fifth floor features the Bender
Room, a reading room that overlooks the Main
Quad. The room also holds the "Gentleperson's
Reading Room," funded by a IW7 Stanford
Bookstore donation in honor of its centennial
anniversary.
To meet students' needs. Green West will
also feature increased study areas and include
several hundred reader seats, each equipped
with computer power and networking capabili
ties.
Almost every desk in the wing will provide
Internet, catalog, database and other electronic
resource access to laptop computer users.
Due to the opening of Green West, librari
ans need to reorganize Green East and Meyer
Library. According to Green Library officials,
the reorganization will place library collections
near their associated centers and programs.
For example, works and collections relating
to the humanities will be located adjacent to the
1 iumanities and Area Studies Reading Room.
1 he current Green Periodicals reading room
will be moved from the basement to the first
floor in Green East, forming a new Information
Center along with the front desk.
1 lie South Mezzanine will be filled with gen
eral collections.
Meyer Library will be used mainly for tech
nical services, such as multimedia editing or lan
guage labs, and academic computing resources.
As Nagy said in August, the goal of the new
West wing will be to provide patrons with safe
ty. comfort and technology.
"The renovation project was undertaken to
bring the structure up to current building safety
codes, to beautify the original version of the
building and to make the facility suitable for
taking the University into the next century, both
academically and technologically." she said.
