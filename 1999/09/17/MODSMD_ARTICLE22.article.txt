# EE prof. to lead Engineering
## Plummer named Dean 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
For a little more than two weeks
now - since Sept. 1 - professor
James Plummer has had to grow
accustomed to a new title: dean.
Plummer, the John M. Fluke
Professor of Electrical Engineer
ing, is the successor of former engi
neering dean and recently appoint
ed provost John Hennessy.
"I am honored to be asked to do
this job," Plummer said. "I hope to
build on our strengths and move
forward with the help of the facul
ty, administration and students."
University President Gerhard
Casper said that Plummer was cho
sen for the position in part due to
"his abilities as an outstanding re
searcher and as a leader."
Casper added that Plummer's
"interest in continuing to expand
the horizons of the School of Engi
neering. his commitment to teach
ing and his personal qualities make
him superbly qualified to be the
next dean."
Plummer's lengthy experience
at Stanford strengthened his
canidacy. He has written more
than 300 articles and holds several
patents. His reseach focuses on
computer-chip technology.
As head of the engineering de
partment, Plummer will lead a
school that is reputed to be one of
the best in the country, with eight
of its nine departments ranked in
the top 10 nationwide, three of
them at number one.

Plummer said that he was both
pleased and saddened when the
University president called him
two weeks ago and asked him
whether he would do the job.
"It was quite a surprise," Plum
mer said. "But how often does that
sort of thing happen?"
Plummer said he accepted the
position only after serious consid
eration.
"It is not a job that I was seek
ing. To be honest, I'm sad to be
leaving the [Electrical Engineer
ing] department," he said.
"Most faculty enjoy teaching and
their research and dislike participat
ing in administration," Plummer
added. "Though I feel similarly. I
couldn't pass up such a tremendous
opportunity to build for the future
and to make a difference."
Some of Plummer's most im
portant responsibilites will include
overseeing an upcoming period of
intense change, in which a large
faculty turnover will result in near
ly a third of faculty being replaced
over the next five years.
Additionally, he will play a role
in faculty hiring and selection.
"The decisions that will need to
be made will profoundly affect the
department for at least the next 25
years and beyond," Plummer said.
His departure also coincides
with the department's efforts to
improve the undergraduate pro
gram in electrical engineering.
Plummer cites an improvement in
curriculum and improved research
opportunities as proposed changes.
" The electrical engineering de
partment will be undergoing con
siderable change in the next sever
al years," Plummer said. "I wish it
the best of luck."

Plummer has been associated
with Stanford for more than 30
years, earning master's and doctor
al degrees in 1 967 and 1 971, respec
tively. I le has served as the Electri
cal Engineering Department Chair
since 1997.
