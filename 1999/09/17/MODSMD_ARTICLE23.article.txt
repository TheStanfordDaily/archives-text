# John Bravman adds another job to long list of duties
## Materials Science prof. takes over as vice provost for undergraduate education 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
University President Gerhard
Casper's imminent departure is
only the latest in a series of recent
changes in top administrative posts.
This summer. Materials Science
and Engineering Prof. John Brav
man became the new Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education.
Provost John Hennessv. who took
his position in July, named Brav
man to the post.
Bravman replaces English and
Comparative Literature Prof.
Ramon Saldivar as vice provost.
Saldivar was the first to hold the
five-year post, which was created
on the recommendation of the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education.
Bravman is well known on cam
pus for his role in Sophomore Col
lege and as dean of the new Fresh
man / Sophomore College.
When he appointed Bravman
the new vice provost. Hennessy
called him "if not the best teacher in
the School of Engineering, pretty
close to being the best.
The two know each other well.
Both new administrators hail from
the Engineering School (Hennessy

was its dean before becoming
provost). an uncommon situation.
Stanford's last three provosts were
social scientists, and there has been
only one other provost from the en
gineering department in the past
two decades.
Before his appointment as vice
provost, Bravman served as depart
ment chair, director of the Center
for Materials Research, senior as
sociate dean lor student affairs for
the School of Engineering and
chair-elect for the Faculty Senate.
In order to focus on his new job, he
is giving up his department chair
manship. faculty senate position
and directorship of the research
center.
This is Bravman's 24th year at
Stanford, starting with his enrolling
as an undergraduate student in
1975. He went on to receive his
master's and doctorate in materials
science and engineering at Stan
ford.
"The University has changed a
lot since then. For one. the student
body is much more diverse than it
once was,"he said.
In 1985 Bravman was hired as an
assistant professor in the Materials
Science and Engineering Depart
ment. By 1995 lie was named a full

professor.
"The years have gone by really
fast." Bravman said. "I give the ad
ministration high marks for the im
provements that it has made to un
dergraduate education since then."
Bravman said that since 1980,
and especially under the guidance
of Casper and former Provost Con
doleezza Rice in the 19905, Stan
ford has begun to take undergradu
ate education more seriously.
"The requirements weren't
nearly as good when I was a stu
dent. but I think we have a much
stronger system in place today," he
said. "The opportunities available
are tremendous."
Bravman's research has focused
on the mechanical behavior of thin
film materials and the reliability of
microscopic structures found in
computer chips and other micro
electronic circuitry.
His group's recent work has fo
cused on the development of tiny
electronic components, called
micro-electro-mechanical systems.
These systems, the subject of a
great deal of current research, are
producing many new useful de
vices, such as more reliable ac
celerometers to trigger automobile
air bags.

John Bravman proves he's a "brave man" by adding yet another title to his repertoire: vice provost for
undergraduate education.
