# Former DKE house to be filled by unassigned students
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Some students with unassigned
housing this fall might find them
selves in a hit of a different situation
than they expeeted when they re
turn: living in the former Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity house.
"The house has been converted

over to undergraduate co-educa
tional housing," Dean of Students
Mare Wais said.
DKE lost its house at 592 May
field in early July.
In a letter addressed to current
DKE president senior Patrick Sher
man which was sent to all DKE
members via e-mail and overnight
express, University officials said that

the decision arose out of the frater
nity's failure to meet four conditions
that were necessary for the Dekes to
maintain housing.
According to Assoc. Dean of Stu
dents Morris Graves, on reviewing
the status of DKE at the closing of
this academic year. DKE did not ful
fill the minimum membership re
quirement and did not meet June

deadlines for paying its financial
obligations or submitting its finan
cial reports.
The conditions, outlined in a May
6 letter drafted to DKE members,
informed them that their housing for
the upcoming year was contingent
on the fraternity meeting certain
conditions.
According to Graves, some con
ditions were different from those
listed in the Greek Housing Criteria
to suit the particulars of the DKE
case.
"The May 6 letter spelled out spe
cific stipulations for the Dekes,"
Graves said. "When we reviewed
their case again, we found some
shortcomings and a failure to meet
the guidelines and deadlines we set
out for them."
DKE previously lost its house in
spring of 1997 due to a hazing inci
dent, but regained it in the fall of
1998. Graves called the one-year
suspension "unprecedented," and a
July 1 letter from the Dean of Stu
dents Office states that "Greek or
ganizations [are] typically suspend
ed for five years."
DKE members were notified this
past April that their housing status
was in jeopardy, as a result of ques
tions concerning the Dekes' "num
bers and membership." Director of
Residential Education Jane Caniar
illo said to The Daily in May.
According to Greek housing cri

teria, every housed fraternity and
sorority "must have sufficient mem
bership at the conclusion of Spring
Rush to fill the house to 1(H) percent
of its rated occupancy for the follow
ing year."
After a meeting with DKE offi
cers, Camarillo said in the May 10 ar
ticle that there was a "shift in num
bers" on the fraternity's roster,
bringing them to a lew members
above the 33-member minimum.
This was one of the factors that
prompted her and Wais to allow
DKE to remain housed for the up
coming year.
"In spring, both [Wais|and 1 were
confident that [DKE| could meet
the conditions in their letter of May
6," Camarillo said.
This recent announcement re
versed the May 6 decision, and DKE
members entered the waiting list
round of the Draw, which is the stan
dard housing assignment procedure
for unassigned students.
Graves said that fraternity and
sorority members need to remem
ber that preferred and guaranteed
housing is a "privilege, not a right."
and that Greek organizations "must
comply by certain guidelines" to re
tain that privilege.
Camarillo said that the Dekes
were aware of the circumstances and
risks involved before leaving cam
pus for the summer.
"The entire membership and

pledge class of the DKE fraternity
were well aware of the conditions
and deadlines that had to be met and
the consequences of not meeting
them," she said.
Wais said that the administra
tion's decision was "fair and reason
able, given the chapter's history and
circumstances." The July 1 letter in
forming DKE members of their re
moval from the house emphasized
that, "DKE was given an extension
of the deadline to submit their final
roster after Rush— No other chap
ter was given such an extension."
' They understood what was ex
pected, and we are enforcing those
guidelines," Wais said. "I'm disap
pointed with this outcome."
As an unhoused fraternity, DKE
will be able to apply for housing in
spring of 2(KX), as other Greek orga
nizations do. However, Camarillo
stated that "they will not be given
any special status in that applica
tion."
"The DKE fraternity has every
potential to succeed as an unhoused
fraternity as evidenced by the num
ber of healthy unhoused Greek or
ganizations. Whether they succeed is
truly up to the effort that they put
into it," she added.
