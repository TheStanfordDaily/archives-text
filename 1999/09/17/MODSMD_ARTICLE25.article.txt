# Follett takes over management of Stanford Bookstore
## Higher Education Group plans renovations, new services for University's six store properties 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
As of July 1. management of the
Stanford Bookstore changed over
from internal management to the
Follett Higher Education Group.
While all of the stores currently
owned by the Bookstore will retain
their current names and services,
Follett will assume management
responsibility for all of them.
"We want to stress that the
Bookstore was not sold," said Shel
ley Hebert, Stanford's director of
business development. "Follett
does not own the Bookstore. It
only has a management contract."
Included in the agreement are
the Main Campus store, Tresidder
Express, the Track House, the
Bookshop at the Iris and B. Gerald
Cantor Center for the Visual Arts,
the University Shop at Stanford
Shopping Center and Stanford
Bookstore Palo Alto.
"We have been working collab
oratively on the selection process
with the Bookstore for several
months and strongly endorse the
selection." said Mariann Byerwal
ter, University vice president for
business affairs and chief financial
officer.

"We share a common goal of
continuing to have a first-rate, aca
demic bookstore at Stanford that
not only meets the needs of faculty
and students hut offers competitive
prices for the entire campus com
munity."
The agreement, announced on
June 16, comes after months of
speculation that the Bookstore was
in talks with a number of corpora
tions. It also comes soon after the
Bookstore appeared to be facing
legal questions surrounding the
way in which it handled the over
billing of a number of credit card
paying customers last October.
Hebert added that such an
agreement was first sought so that
the Bookstore could compete ef
fectively with other college book
stores and because a third-party
operator could meet Stanford's
needs well.
"Working with the University,
the [Bookstore] Board considered
the fact that many of Stanford's
peer institutions (including Har
vard and Yale) have entered into
bookstore-operating agreements
that have improved services," she
said.
Under the terms of the contract,
a transition team will begin work

ing with the current Bookstore
staff to make sure that operations
continue as usual. According to
Hebert. Follett expects to hire
most of the current Bookstore em
ployees to serve under the new sys
tem.
Hebert adds that 268 employees
were employed by the Bookstore
before the agreement was signed.
She estimates that approximately
20 positions will be eliminated,
most of them upper-management
positions.
"Because Follett will manage
the Bookstore's operations, some
positions will no longer be needed
because they would duplicate func
tions within the company," she
said.
She added that around 40 stu
dents work at the Bookstore each
quarter and that that number is ex
pected to continue after the agree
ment takes effect.
Hebert said that Follett plans to
install a local director who will
oversee its operations on campus.
And. because corporate operations
fall under the jurisdiction of Fol
lett, the current Board of Directors
will exist in a "reduced" capacity
and will primarily consult Follett.
Associate Vice President for

Business and Finance Mary Ryan
will be responsible for interacting
with Follett representatives and for
making sure that the terms of the
contract are met.
Final discretion will rest with
Follett and its local director on
campus. A commitment to acade
mics was an important characteris
tic sought in the management com
pany.
Suggested new services include
a "Buy 10 get one free" program on
non-academic books, a faculty
/staff sales discount, greater stu
dent access to used books and im
proved online services for all cus
tomers.
Future plans include a major
renovation of the main campus
store and improvements to Tresid
der Express.
As the nation's largest manager
of academic bookstores, Follett
currently operates stores at 585 col
leges and universities, including
those at UC-Berkeley and the Uni
versity of Notre Dame.
