## Stanford 101: Farm traditions exposed 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
You're here, vou got in, you
picked out some semi-attractive yet
reasonably priced bedding and
you're getting the hangol Stanford.
Congratulations, you made it.
But now is not the time to rest on
your laurels.
As you're learning the ropes
here on campus, its imperative that
you learn a few fundamental tradi
tions. These will soon become sec
ond nature, like clapping too fast
and jumping at just the right time
when The One. The Only, the Truly
Incomparable. Leland Stanford Ju
nior (pause) University Marching
Band plays "All Right Now."

square dance at MuFul JnSun. Yes.
it's cheesy. Yes. you'll look like a
redneck. But get out there and do
si-do your tiny little heart out. It will
be one of those I Inllmark memories
for years it) come, unforgettable if
only for the fact that you actually
put aside your embarrassment and
kept your laughing at the caller to a
minimum.
Soon alter comes lull Moon on
the Ouad, your one chance for
guilt-free tongue jousting with a
total stranger. You submit because
you're supposed to. In order to be
come a Stanford man or woman, ac
cording to legend, a freshman must
kiss a senior in the Ouad under the
light of the full moon.
It's a little slea/ier and not quite
as poetic as it sounds, but he a good
sport. Hopefully the moon won't
provide enough light for anyone to
recognize you later and incriminate
you in any way.
All the while, you'll see and be
seen at Stanford's one regular
weekly social outit g. I licks. These
almost-up-to-date movie offerings
screened in Memorial Auditorium
are a great opportunity to check out
male pattern baldness trends
among those in the orchestra seats,
as well as your one shot to nail that
obnoxious prep school kid in your I
Hum class during the pre-show
paper light. Word has it that to
achieve the nirvana of true senior
status one must successfully float a
paper airplane from the balcony
and hit the movie screen.
Halloween sets the scene for a
less wholesome, frenzied rite as the
student body heads on down to the
resting place of our beloved
founders. Mom. Dad and little I e
land. and dances on their graves. A
little morbid and ungrateful, per
haps. but the Mausoleum provides
a perfectly eerie backdrop for the
wickedness of the holiday.
Once November rolls around,
all the cosmic energy on campus fo
cuses on one deliciously malicious

goal: lo beat Cal. Out comes the
name-calling, the Axe wielding and
the most high-schoolesque display
of Stanford spirit you will get out of
a group of semi-apathetic smart
people.
Four years ago. Stanford re
claimed the Axe a hallowed arti

Big Game Week includes many
can't-miss-or-vou're-lame events
such as Gaieties, a student-written
comedy revue that takes the oppor
tunity to playfully go for the Cal
jugular. Gaieties also sends more
visible Stanford icons up in flames

in a joking, pseudo-plot filled musi
cal. And when they say "Branner
sucks," they're only teasing. Don't
take it personally.
