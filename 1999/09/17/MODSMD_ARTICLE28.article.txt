# 1,750 freshmen flock to the Farm

Today, 1,750 new faces appear on
campus. Some will get lost on the
way to Tresidder. Some will escape
near-death by bicycle. Others will
meet their future best friends. All arc
freshmen.
With so many entering students,
the Class of 2003 is the largest in
Stanford history. They hail from 49
states (all but North Dakota). Cali
fornia sent the most freshmen to
comprise 39 percent of the class, fol
lowed by Texas (7.4 percent), Wash
ington (4.3 percent) and New York
(3.9 percent).
Thirty-nine countries are home to
11S international freshmen, includ
ing Singapore, Hong Kong. Canada,
Korea, Japan and Brazil. This year
saw an increase in the number of
freshmen from western European
countries such as England, France
and Switzerland. There are fewer
students from China and Thailand.
The ethnic distribution has
changed little since last year. Ap
proximately half the class is Cau
casian. while 24 percent are Asian-
American. Nine percent of the fresh
men have a Mexican-American
background, followed by eight per
cent who are African-American.
Men and women are very nearly
equally represented. The number of
those who graduated from private
schools has gone up five percent
from last year.
"It's a wonderful group that's
coming in, and I'm really excited to
meet them," said Dean of Admissios
and Financial Aid Robert Kinnally.
" These are absolutely amazing, tal
ented. bright, young people who will
bring a lot as individuals."
Sophomore Joe Narens of the
New Undergraduate Student Infor
mation Project has seen forms sent in
by freshmen listing such talents as fig
ure skating and archery.
"We have a really good assort
ment of people who have interesting
hobbies," said Narens.
I.ike last year, many of the fresh
men have musical talent, although
they have not necessarily expressed
interest in a music major. The Office
of Undergraduate Admissions has
been working with the music depart
ment to increase the number of en
rolled students with either musical
talent or plans to major in music.
In keeping with the diverse inter
ests of the Class 0f2003, New Student
Orientation will expose freshmen to
the opportunities available to them
at Stanford. I lead Orientation Vol
unteer Lindsay Gervacio hopes that
new students will "actively search for
what drives them [and] look beyond
the orientation activities."
University programs have geared

up to accommodate the large num
bers. In particular, the Introduction
to the Humanities Program, which
most freshmen take to fulfill the
Area One general education re
quirement, has increased its staff.
The Language Center will end up
testing about 100 more students than
usual for language placement on
Sunday. However, Director Eliza
beth Bernhardt said that this year's
large class would have resulted in
even more language tests adminis
tered, were they not offset by a 10
percent increase in freshmen coming
to Stanford with Advanced Place
ment or SAT II credit.
Upon learning that her class is the
largest ever at Stanford, freshman
Geetika Agrawal replied, "I think it
might actually be exciting to have
more people and be part of a larger
class. It will bring more diversity and
energy to the school."
However, fellow freshman Nita
Singh offers a different perspective.
"Truthfully, I'm kind of disap
pointed. only because I think a small
er student body would be a lot more
suitable for me and my needs. Of
course, there will be a lot more peo
ple to meet, but with a smaller class,
you have a lot more opportunities to
get to know more people on a per
sonal level and not feel so insignifi
cant.
"That was kind of a big reason
why I chose Stanford in the first place
â€” because I heard how people get
more involved and receive more at
tention from advisors, professors and
so forth in a smaller school setting."
The large freshman class results
from an unexpectedly high yield rate
among those admitted. From 1998 to
1999, the yield jumped from 64 per
cent to 71 percent.
"We did have some new pro
grams which increased the yield, and
we enhanced existing programs,"
said Kinnally. "It's absolutely a
happy surprise. But it raises the ques
tion, what about next year?" He
noted that the admissions office will
have to wait and see how many appli
cations are received but predicted a
lower admit rate in 2000.
The University compensated for
the increased number of enrolling
freshmen by drastically reducing the
spots available for transfer students.
Usually, about 1 (X) students transfer
to Stanford. Last year, for example,
there were 96 transfers. For the 1999-
2(KK) school year, there are only 21
transfer students.
Cutting back on the number of
transfer students also helped Resi
dential Education avoid a crunch, es
pecially with former all-frosh dorms
Faisan and Soto changing to four
class status due to the opening of the
new Freshman-Sophomore College.
