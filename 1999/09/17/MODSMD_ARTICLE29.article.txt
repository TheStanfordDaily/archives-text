# Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match
## Freshman housing selects roommates with the utmost care 
### Christina Harvey 
When matching new roommates, sophomore
Joe Narens was aiming for more than just people
who wouldn't shave each other's heads for spite.
"I was really surprised at how much went into
it." said Narens. the New Undergraduate Student
Information Project junior coordinator. "It really is
a time-consuming process."
Narens used the housing and roommate prefer
ence forms filled out by freshmen to guide him
while assigning housing and matching roommates,
but he said much of the process is still random.
Freshmen this year had three house choices:
four-class dorms, all-freshman dorms or the new
Freshman / Sophomore College. They could also
select between a single-sex fl<x>r or a co-ed floor.
"We try to optimize their choices, but since the
all-frosh houses are limited, we can only assign so
many people and the rest are randomly assigned to
their next choice of housing." Narens said.
Narens said requests to be in a specific dorm are
usually ignored, except for medical considerations.
"The assignments really are random." he said.
()ncc the freshmen were assigned to the dorms.
Narens got to play matchmaker, the highlight of his
job. he said.
"The most important factor in placing room
mates together is making sure they aren't from the
same region of the countrv." he said. "We want to

create a diverse campus, and pairing roommates
from different places creates that atmosphere right
from the start. "Where you grow up has a great im
pact on who you arc," Narens said. I le also made
an effort to pair people of different ethnicities, un
less a mini>rity specifically asked to live with anoth
er minority of the same race.
"But even then there's no guarantee," he said.
He also tried to match bedtimes, neatness, social
personality and music preferences.
"The theory is that if two people like the same
music, they won't argue over it,"he said. "We also
feel that music sometimes goes beyond musical
taste. It says something about your personality."
Narens pointed out that if two people look per
fect together on paper, that will override every
other consideration except the regional one.
Narens said he realizes the system is imperfect,
and a person's responses on a form may be very dif
ferent from who he or she actually is. I lowever, he
said, the goal is to allow roommates to co-exist as
peacefully and happily as possible.
"We're trying to create a certain element of di
versity so individuals can learn from each other,"
he said, "and | find] enough in common that they
can live with each other."
Religion is an important factor that gets thrown
into that "diversity category." Narens said.
"In most cases, we don't even know."he said.
As might be expected. Branner is the most diffi

cult dorm for roommate matching — so difficult
that the senior coordinator does it instead of
Narens. However, the fact that Branner is the
largest all-frosh dorm isn't what makes it difficult.
"It's the triples," Narens said, almost groaning.
"We go through the same process, hut because
there are three roommates, we have to be extra
careful. We have to make sure it won't be two peo
ple who get along really well and one person who
feels left out."
Narens assigns roommates to quads in Roble,
which he said is easier. "You've got more room for
error because of that extra person," he said.
Unlike many universities, Stanford does not
offer the incoming freshmen contact information
about their new roommates.
"That's because we're switching roommates up
until the very beginning of the year for medical rea
sons like wheelchair access or bad asthma," he said,
noting that dorm reassignment is made on a case
by-case basis. "It would be too bad to make friends
with your new roommate and then find out at the
last minute that the whole thing was changed."
But there's a more important reason, Narens
said.
"We like to think everyone's coming in on the
same foot, not knowing anyone," he said. "If some
people are already friendly with each other and
creating cliques, others will feel more left out. This
process keeps things more equal for everyone."
