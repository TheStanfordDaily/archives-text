# Merger future uncertain
## Trustees' decision opens door to UCSF-Stanford split 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
If UCSF-Stanford Health Care were a hospital pa
tient. it would belong in the intensive care unit.
The Stanford Board of Trustees took a step last
week that could lead the way to splitting the financially
troubled merger, calling for site-specific accounting
and management for UCSFand Stanford hospitals.
The recommendation ends a turbulent summer for
IJCSF-Stanford. In the last three months, the organiza
tion's top two officials resigned, a state senate commit
tee audited the merger and the presidents of the I Uni
versity of California and Stanford co-authored a letter
pledging to "reassess" the 1997 consolidation.
But the merger was in trouble long before students
finished final exams in June. After recording modest
profits in its first year. I J( 'SF-Stanford lost $10.7 million
in the first financial quarter ol 1999.
Administrators responded by cutting 2.(KX) posi
tions at UCSF-Stanford hospitals and projected a SMl
million shortfall for the 1999 fiscal year. Thursday, the
San Francisco ( hronicle reported that the organization
had already tallied a $66-million deficit by July.
In an interview last spring with Faculty Focus, a
USCF-Stanford publication, former CEO Peter Van
Etten said the merger did not contribute to the short
fall.
"The merger has provided and will continue to pro
vide the opportunities to improve both financial per
formance and patient care," he said.
But now, the survival of the merger is in doubt.
"The current structure has not allowed the flexibili
ty for Stanford and UCSF todeal with the complexities
unique to their respective institutions." the Board of
Trustees said in a press release last week. "Some modi
fication to the structure ... is essential if it is to achieve
its purpose."
New management
On Aug. 9 UCSI -Stanford President Van Etten and
Executive Vice President William Kerr announced
their resignations.
David I luntei. chief executive officer of the 1 lunter

(iroup. a hospital management consulting firm known
for turning around troubled mergers, took control of
the organization.
I lunter announced an ambitious cost-cutting plan,
calling for IK'SI'-Stanford to cut expenditures by $170
million, which would return the organization to the
break-even point by next year. The organization would
gain nearly $112 million by cutting 16 percent of its
workforce.
Among its main tenets was the conversion of a
money-draining San Francisco hospital to a daytime
medical clinic.
IJCSF-Stanford spokesman Mike Lassiler said the
I lunter (.iroup was a natural choice to assume manage
ment of I J(\SF Stanford.
"The Hunter (iroup was already working with
[UCSF Stanford]." Fassiter said. "They helped us with
our recovery plan and it is natural for them to help us
bring it to fruition."
1 lowever. unions representing workers at hospitals
within the merger are critical of the new managers.
"When I lunter (iroup comes in they are known for
slash and burn," said Joe 1 indsay, director of the acute
care division of the California Nurses Association.
"They identify quick fixes where they think they can
show some changes. And because of the way hospitals
operate, [those changes are] on the backs of employ
ees."
Opposition
The Nurse's Association doesn't stand alone in its
opposition. Soon after UCSF-Stanford completed the
first round of layoffs, unions, politicians and university
leaders lined up to denounce them.
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a
resolution opposing the layoffs and calling for full dis
closure of the financial records. The Menlo Park City
Council followed suit, calling on Menlo Park Mayor
Paul Collacehi to write a letter expressing concern over
patient care.
During a May meeting of the University of Califor
nia Board of Regents, regent Frank Clark called for the
dissolution of the merger. Clark, a long-time merger
