# Merger future uncertain
## Trustees' decision opens door to UCSF-Stanford split 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
If UCSF-Stanford Health Care were a hospital pa
tient. it would belong in the intensive care unit.
The Stanford Board of Trustees took a step last
week that could lead the way to splitting the financially
troubled merger, calling for site-specific accounting
and management for UCSFand Stanford hospitals.
The recommendation ends a turbulent summer for
IJCSF-Stanford. In the last three months, the organiza
tion's top two officials resigned, a state senate commit
tee audited the merger and the presidents of the I Uni
versity of California and Stanford co-authored a letter
pledging to "reassess" the 1997 consolidation.
But the merger was in trouble long before students
finished final exams in June. After recording modest
profits in its first year. I J( 'SF-Stanford lost $10.7 million
in the first financial quarter ol 1999.
Administrators responded by cutting 2.(KX) posi
tions at UCSF-Stanford hospitals and projected a SMl
million shortfall for the 1999 fiscal year. Thursday, the
San Francisco ( hronicle reported that the organization
had already tallied a $66-million deficit by July.
In an interview last spring with Faculty Focus, a
USCF-Stanford publication, former CEO Peter Van
Etten said the merger did not contribute to the short
fall.
"The merger has provided and will continue to pro
vide the opportunities to improve both financial per
formance and patient care," he said.
But now, the survival of the merger is in doubt.
"The current structure has not allowed the flexibili
ty for Stanford and UCSF todeal with the complexities
unique to their respective institutions." the Board of
Trustees said in a press release last week. "Some modi
fication to the structure ... is essential if it is to achieve
its purpose."
New management
On Aug. 9 UCSI -Stanford President Van Etten and
Executive Vice President William Kerr announced
their resignations.
David I luntei. chief executive officer of the 1 lunter

(iroup. a hospital management consulting firm known
for turning around troubled mergers, took control of
the organization.
I lunter announced an ambitious cost-cutting plan,
calling for IK'SI'-Stanford to cut expenditures by $170
million, which would return the organization to the
break-even point by next year. The organization would
gain nearly $112 million by cutting 16 percent of its
workforce.
Among its main tenets was the conversion of a
money-draining San Francisco hospital to a daytime
medical clinic.
IJCSF-Stanford spokesman Mike Lassiler said the
I lunter (.iroup was a natural choice to assume manage
ment of I J(\SF Stanford.
"The Hunter (iroup was already working with
[UCSF Stanford]." Fassiter said. "They helped us with
our recovery plan and it is natural for them to help us
bring it to fruition."
1 lowever. unions representing workers at hospitals
within the merger are critical of the new managers.
"When I lunter (iroup comes in they are known for
slash and burn," said Joe 1 indsay, director of the acute
care division of the California Nurses Association.
"They identify quick fixes where they think they can
show some changes. And because of the way hospitals
operate, [those changes are] on the backs of employ
ees."
Opposition
The Nurse's Association doesn't stand alone in its
opposition. Soon after UCSF-Stanford completed the
first round of layoffs, unions, politicians and university
leaders lined up to denounce them.
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a
resolution opposing the layoffs and calling for full dis
closure of the financial records. The Menlo Park City
Council followed suit, calling on Menlo Park Mayor
Paul Collacehi to write a letter expressing concern over
patient care.
During a May meeting of the University of Califor
nia Board of Regents, regent Frank Clark called for the
dissolution of the merger. Clark, a long-time merger

opponent, cited concern over the loss
of public funds.
Other regents stopped short of
calling tor a breakup of the merger,
hut several advocated closer moni
toring of UCSF-Stanford's financial
situation.
In August. University of Califor
nia President Richard Atkinson and
Stanford President Gerhard Casper
issued a joint letter which said they
would "reassess the structure" of the
merger.
The letter offered few specific rec
ommendations but set an Oct. 1
deadline for the assessment of the
merger.

Mount /.ion in peril
The merger's success could hinge
on a San Francisco hospital that state
auditors blame for nearly all of
UCSF-Stanford's losses.
An audit by the California State
Senate's Committee on Government
Oversight pins the majority of the
projected $6()-million shortfall on
Mount Zion Hospital, a fact that
clearly troubled Stanford trustees
who said they should not be expected
to "subsidize" a University of Cali
fornia hospital.
Though never mentioning Mount
Zion by name, the Board of Trustees
emphasized in its press release last
week that one of the merger's basic
tenets was that neither university
should be expected to subsidize the

other.
Under one of the most controver
sial components of the cost-cutting
plan endorsed by the Hunter Group,
Mount Zion would be converted to a
daytime medical clinic.
Officials for UCSF-Stanford are
also courting public funds to shore up
the hospital's fiscal situation, though
the organization's private, non-profit
status could keep the organization
from receiving the money.
Site-specific management and ac
counting, as recommended by the
Stanford Board of Trustees, may
open the door to public funds.
San Francisco may be willing to
contribute to Mount Zion Hospital,
the director of public health told state
lawmakers on Sept. 2, the Chronicle
reported. But Lassiter said UCSF-

Stanford heard no further details.
Union and community leaders op
pose plans to close or downgrade the
status of Mount Zion.
Mount Zion "has to remain open
as a full-service hospital." said Cali
fornia Nurses Association
spokesman Lindsay. "It is a relatively
small community hospital. It services
immigrant and working-class com
munities. It will be a disaster if it clos
es."
UCSF-Stanford officials deny that
they are ignoring community needs,
even if they convert the hospital to a
day clinic. The organization spends
more than seven percent of its rev
enue on charity care, UCSF-Stanford
officials say, while other California
hospitals donate an average of 1.3
percent.

A hostile environment
UCSF-Stanford joins hospitals
statewide in its financial troubles.
"Other hospitals continue to have
difficulties," said current UCSF-
Stanford spokesman Mike Lassiter.
Federal funding is unlikely to im
prove soon, he said.
UCSF-Stanford officials earlier
this year attributed that climate to a
combination of low HMO reim
bursement rates and a decrease in
federal funding for Medicare pa
tients.
Hunter, the interim president and
CEO of UCSF-Stanford, said the
merged hospitals face an especially
difficult situation.
"The financial problems being ex

perienced by UCSF-Stanford Health
Care are a microcosm of those being
laced by most academic medical cen
ters across the country," Hunter said
in testimony given to the committee
on government oversight.
The Board of Trustees affirmed
last week that it agrees the merger is
not the cause of UCSF-Stanford's fi
nancial woes. But based on the
Board's actions to separate site man
agement and accounting, merger de
tractors and supporters agree that the
organization's composition will
change, if it survives.
I lunter is confident it will.
"In my experience managing
mergers." he said. "UCSF-Stanford
is progressing well on the maturation
curve and will succeed if it stays the
difficult course it must pursue."

"The merger has provided and will continue to pro
vide the opportunities to improve both financial per
formance and patient care," he said.
But now, the survival of the merger is in doubt.
"The current structure has not allowed the flexibili
ty for Stanford and UCSF todeal with the complexities
unique to their respective institutions." the Board of
Trustees said in a press release last week. "Some modi
fication to the structure ... is essential if it is to achieve
its purpose."
New management
On Aug. 9 UCSI -Stanford President Van Etten and
Executive Vice President William Kerr announced
their resignations.
David I luntei. chief executive officer of the 1 lunter

(iroup. a hospital management consulting firm known
for turning around troubled mergers, took control of
the organization.
I lunter announced an ambitious cost-cutting plan,
calling for IK'SI'-Stanford to cut expenditures by $170
million, which would return the organization to the
break-even point by next year. The organization would
gain nearly $112 million by cutting 16 percent of its
workforce.
Among its main tenets was the conversion of a
money-draining San Francisco hospital to a daytime
medical clinic.
IJCSF-Stanford spokesman Mike Lassiler said the
I lunter (.iroup was a natural choice to assume manage
ment of I J(\SF Stanford.
"The Hunter (iroup was already working with
[UCSF Stanford]." Fassiter said. "They helped us with
our recovery plan and it is natural for them to help us
bring it to fruition."
1 lowever. unions representing workers at hospitals
within the merger are critical of the new managers.
"When I lunter (iroup comes in they are known for
slash and burn," said Joe 1 indsay, director of the acute
care division of the California Nurses Association.
"They identify quick fixes where they think they can
show some changes. And because of the way hospitals
operate, [those changes are] on the backs of employ
ees."
Opposition
The Nurse's Association doesn't stand alone in its
opposition. Soon after UCSF-Stanford completed the
first round of layoffs, unions, politicians and university
leaders lined up to denounce them.
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a
resolution opposing the layoffs and calling for full dis
closure of the financial records. The Menlo Park City
Council followed suit, calling on Menlo Park Mayor
Paul Collacehi to write a letter expressing concern over
patient care.
During a May meeting of the University of Califor
nia Board of Regents, regent Frank Clark called for the
dissolution of the merger. Clark, a long-time merger

opponent, cited concern over the loss
of public funds.
Other regents stopped short of
calling tor a breakup of the merger,
hut several advocated closer moni
toring of UCSF-Stanford's financial
situation.
In August. University of Califor
nia President Richard Atkinson and
Stanford President Gerhard Casper
issued a joint letter which said they
would "reassess the structure" of the
merger.
The letter offered few specific rec
ommendations but set an Oct. 1
deadline for the assessment of the
merger.

Mount /.ion in peril
The merger's success could hinge
on a San Francisco hospital that state
auditors blame for nearly all of
UCSF-Stanford's losses.
An audit by the California State
Senate's Committee on Government
Oversight pins the majority of the
projected $6()-million shortfall on
Mount Zion Hospital, a fact that
clearly troubled Stanford trustees
who said they should not be expected
to "subsidize" a University of Cali
fornia hospital.
Though never mentioning Mount
Zion by name, the Board of Trustees
emphasized in its press release last
week that one of the merger's basic
tenets was that neither university
should be expected to subsidize the

other.
Under one of the most controver
sial components of the cost-cutting
plan endorsed by the Hunter Group,
Mount Zion would be converted to a
daytime medical clinic.
Officials for UCSF-Stanford are
also courting public funds to shore up
the hospital's fiscal situation, though
the organization's private, non-profit
status could keep the organization
from receiving the money.
Site-specific management and ac
counting, as recommended by the
Stanford Board of Trustees, may
open the door to public funds.
San Francisco may be willing to
contribute to Mount Zion Hospital,
the director of public health told state
lawmakers on Sept. 2, the Chronicle
reported. But Lassiter said UCSF-

Stanford heard no further details.
Union and community leaders op
pose plans to close or downgrade the
status of Mount Zion.
Mount Zion "has to remain open
as a full-service hospital." said Cali
fornia Nurses Association
spokesman Lindsay. "It is a relatively
small community hospital. It services
immigrant and working-class com
munities. It will be a disaster if it clos
es."
UCSF-Stanford officials deny that
they are ignoring community needs,
even if they convert the hospital to a
day clinic. The organization spends
more than seven percent of its rev
enue on charity care, UCSF-Stanford
officials say, while other California
hospitals donate an average of 1.3
percent.

A hostile environment
UCSF-Stanford joins hospitals
statewide in its financial troubles.
"Other hospitals continue to have
difficulties," said current UCSF-
Stanford spokesman Mike Lassiter.
Federal funding is unlikely to im
prove soon, he said.
UCSF-Stanford officials earlier
this year attributed that climate to a
combination of low HMO reim
bursement rates and a decrease in
federal funding for Medicare pa
tients.
Hunter, the interim president and
CEO of UCSF-Stanford, said the
merged hospitals face an especially
difficult situation.
"The financial problems being ex

perienced by UCSF-Stanford Health
Care are a microcosm of those being
laced by most academic medical cen
ters across the country," Hunter said
in testimony given to the committee
on government oversight.
The Board of Trustees affirmed
last week that it agrees the merger is
not the cause of UCSF-Stanford's fi
nancial woes. But based on the
Board's actions to separate site man
agement and accounting, merger de
tractors and supporters agree that the
organization's composition will
change, if it survives.
I lunter is confident it will.
"In my experience managing
mergers." he said. "UCSF-Stanford
is progressing well on the maturation
curve and will succeed if it stays the
difficult course it must pursue."
