# Join the world of Cardinalingo
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Staff writer 
Listen up: Stanford students speak a different lan
guage from the outside world. Call it Stanfordese,
Farmonics, or Cardinalingo.
Whatever the name, you will soon he speaking this
unique tonque. In principle, this regional language
consists o! taking two or more words and rendering
them into catchy little rhythmic smaller words.
Why? We don't know. We just do it. All of us.
So. to get you hooked on Stanford Phonics, here is
a short dictionary to get you through the next few
days. You may want to carry it around with you:
Co Ho: The Coffee House. A traditional Stanford
hangout in Tresidder Union that serves food and
drinks such as coffee and sandwiches.
Co Po: The Corner Pocket. Another traditional Stan
ford hang out in Tresidder that serves piz/a.

smoothies and Iro yo (see below). I lowcv
er, they are not technically located in a
J J a

corner nor do they sell pockets. Dis
cuss this amongst yourselves.

Dink: Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The auditorium located across

from the Co I 10.
Flo Mo: Florence
Moore I fall. A bin dor-

mitory located just oil
of the Row, named

after a woman
named Florence
Moore. She gave
Stanford lots of
money. Good
brunch. Great ice

cream.
Fro Yo: Frozen
Yogurt. Served

at the Co Po. A
substitute for

ice cream.
Many Califor
nians are
scared of ice

cream be
cause it has
fat in it:
thus, they
eat fro vo.

Mem Aud: Memorial Auditorium. An auditorium lo
cated across from Hoover Tower. They show F licks
there every Sunday night. Flicks are cheap movies
with paper fights included.
Mem Chu: Memorial Church. A non-denomination
al church located in the Quad.
MuFulJnSiin: Music and Fun under the Sun. Event
that takes place during Orientation. Find out about a
lot of Stanford clubs.
Pro Fro: Prospective Freshman. You were one of
these once. The official term is now "admits." This
term is disliked bv most students, as there is no po
tential Stanfordese word for it. If you host a pro fro,
you are a pro fro I lo Ho (house host). If you coordi
nate the dorm's pro fro ho group, you are a pro fro ho
do co. Whoa.
Res F.d: Residential Education. The people who

put on many programs in your dormitories
all year. No relation to the horse, Mr. Ed.

Tres Ex: Tresidder Express. The on
campus store, located in Tresid
. der. They sell Cheetos, deodorant
| and other tasty things.

That should he enough to
get you through the first few

weeks. To test your knowl-

edge, look at the follow-

ing paragraph

My pro fro from
Flo Mo slopped at the
Co Po to get a fro yo on
Iter way back from

MuFuUnSun. She
ran into a friend that

worked for Res
Comp in a building
between the Co 110
and Dink.

If this made
sense, congratu
lations! And if
you realized

that there is no
building be
tween the Co
Ho and Dink,

you're way
ahead of the
game.
