### Kimberly Downs Editorial staff 
Sharon Palmer just can't seem to
get away from Stanford.
Once an undergraduate here, she
has progressed to the position of
College Director for the new Fresh
man / Sophomore College as well as
to the position of director of Fresh
men and Sophomore Programs.
Her position as college director
will see her guide students in both
their academic and residential lives,
which makes her role essentially the
same as a resident fellow in a dormi
tory.
She and her husband. Andy Di
mock. will both be the college direc
tors for the Adams dormitory in
Sterling Quad. J.B. Shank and his
wife Alison will be the college direc
tors for Schiff. the other dorm in
Sterling Quad housing the partici
pants of Freshmen / Sophomore
College
"I am excited to have the chance
to live with and interact with under
graduates." Palmer said. "I'm espe
cially eager to have student contact
that will show me the administrative
work I'm doing in Freshmen Sopho
more programs actually affects real
people."
She went on to add that. "I had a
great experience at Stanford as an
undergraduate, and would love to
be able to create an even better ex
perience for these students."

She expects that there will be a
lot of excitement and energy in liv
ing with freshmen and said. "No
doubt there will be the usual quota
of crises, but we've got a great resi
dence staff to deal with those."
Though Palmer has never been a
resident fellow before, she expects
the experience to he positive he
cause her husband has had a great
deal of residence life experience at
hoth Yale University and Wesleyan
University.
"I bring the Stanford hack
ground: he brings the experience of
living with students and staff," she
said.
Palmer and her fellow college di
rector. Shank, were selected for
their positions last spring by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman.
Jane Camarillo, director of resi
dential education, told The Daily
that. "The goal [for choosing college
directors] was to select people who
had a sincere interest in undergrad
uate life, particularly in the first and
second year."
Ellen Woods, Associate Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion, added that "their willingness
and desire to be part of a communi
ty was at the forefront."
Sharon said that she'll have the
traditional responsibilities of a resi
dent fellow and that at the same
time she hopes to have a hand in
some of the pilot programs in Fresh

man / Sophomore College, such as
having a few residence-based intro
ductory seminars.
"I think the most important thing
will be to listen to the ideas of the
student residents," Palmer said.
"All Stanford students have inter
esting things to contribute, and I
think we can make something won
derful if we build on what each per
son brings to the dorm."
Shauna Harrison, a senior and a
College Assistant for the program
said. "I think Sharon [and] J.B.
Shank are perfect CDs for the Frosh
/ Soph college. They have the ener
gy and ideas we need as we start the
new college."
She added that the college direc
tors have already been a lot more in
volved in the dorm than any other
resident fellows she has seen and
that "all of our college directors are
very interested in the new program
and very willing to help us in any
way."
Outside of her job. Sharon likes
to cook, canoe, knit and read con
temporary fiction. She also hopes to
pursue her interest in the outdoors
by going camping with Dimock and
their cocker spaniel Lizzie.
Dimock is currently finishing his
doctorate in English from Yale.
He's also a runner, avid conversa
tionalist and Boston Red Sox fan.
They moved into the resident fel
low cottage attached to Adams in
mid-August.
