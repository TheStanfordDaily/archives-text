# It could happen to you
## Upperclassmen reveal their embarassing moments 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Getting used to life at Stanford can be quite
an adjustment. Life without parents, rules and
the comforts of your own home can often lead
to embarassing situations...
"One night during freshman year, 1 was in
my boyfriend's room when someone started
knocking on the door. As we weren't in the
most appropriate situation to immediately an
swer the door, my boyfriend decided that if it
had been his roommate, he would have let
himself in — and if it was someone else, we
could just pretend we weren't in there. A few
seconds later, the door opened and the RA
walked in, observed the situation, said 'Oh,
you are in here,' turned around and left. 1 could
never look the RAin the eye again."
"My freshman year 1 lived in Larkin. One
morning, the first week of school, the showers
were all full in Larkin North, so rather than
waiting, I decided to go shower in Larkin West.
After the shower, I went across the catwalk
back to Larkin North and realized I hadn't
brought my keys with me. I was wet, wrapped
in my towel with my arms full, knocking on the
door. Ten minutes and many amused bikers
later, someone finally opened the door for
me."
"I went to the Jello-party at the Deke
house, drank a bit too much, walked home and
decided to go check my post office box. I bare
ly got my bike unlocked, managed to get on it
only to go 20 feet down the sidewalk before
swerving into the hedge. I made it about a hun
dred feet before a cop picked me up of the
ground, got my bike, [warned] me about the
danger of California's BUI (biking under the
influence) laws and then walked me home all
scratched up. I found pine needles in my
clothes the next day and everyone in my dorm
ragged on me for weeks."
"We decided to raid Junipero one evening,
so about all 30 freshman and some upperclass
men from Arroyo dressed up all in black with
bandanas and water pistols and hoses, and ran
over to Junipero. Upon entering Junipero, we

shot whoever happened to be in the hall at the
time, some poor frosh girl and Marc Wais. Of
course we were freshman and this was week
two of school so we didn't know he was the
Dean of Students — so that was, umm, a bad
move. Wais was pretty pissed, especially since
we ruined the art mural on the windows."
"The Arroyo pool table had a broken leg,
so some of us decided to throw it from the third
story balcony. Apparently some people in
Cedro thought that it was an earthquake — we
learned it's against the honor code to throw a
'two ton' object off a balcony."
"One girl got her head locked in a U-Lock
and the police, fire and ambulances had to
come help her. It was a big scene and we found
out that the jaws of life could not be used be
cause it might injure bystanders, so a diamond
tip saw was used. It made the Palo Alto paper
as a story reminiscent of 'I Love Lucy.'"
"Spring my frosh year, I got extremely
drunk at the band's spring all-campus rally.
When I came back to my room, I tossed a
bleach bottle that was in my way across our
room, onto my roommate's futon. The cap was
loose, leaked all night, and burned a 6-inch
hole through his comforter cover."
"I went to Meyer Library for the first time,
and didn't know that you had to swipe your
card and then go through the turn-style. I just
waltzed through the "out" side and all of the li
brary people yelled at me like 1 was trying to
sneak in or something."
"While I was running with the band the first
night, a bollard jumped up and hit me."
"I was so lost my first day of classes my blind
RA showed me the way to my CIV (now 1-
Hum) lecture! Talk about the blind leading
the blind "
"At a party in an all-freshman dorm, I was
among the number of underage people in the
posession of alcohol. However, I was the only
one swift enough to greet the cop who busted
the party with a 'Hello, officer.' My parents
were mast thrilled with the MIP."
