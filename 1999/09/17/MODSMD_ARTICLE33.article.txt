# Are there any questions?

### 
As helpful as your resident assistant
may be, your first few weeks at Stanford
can be a little disorienting. To make your
first weeks at Stanford as worry-free as
possible, we compiled this list of answers
to some of the most frequently asked Ori
entation week questions:
Q: How do I pay my University hill and
ensure my financial aid?
A: To pay your bill, go to the Oak West
lounge on the second floor of Tresidder
Union. ('Phis is only set up during orienta
tion). If you already have a check for the
amount due, just look for the big box in
which to deposit your yellow envelope. If
you suspect an error in your bill or need to
get loan disbursements or pick up schol
arship money, there are several specific
counters to assist you. But if you have
questions, come early — lines can get
long. For those who have no clue where to
begin, there is even a "No Clue" line to
stand in.
Q: What happens if I miss an Orientation
activity?
A: Relax. Orientation programs are rec
ommended but not mandatory. Every op
portunity to get to know Stanford and the
people around you will pay off in the long
run, but things may come up that prevent
you from attending every activity. Pick
the activities that you think are important
or sound interesting and attend those.
O: Do I need to take a math, chemistry or
foreign language placement test?
A: Math: If you do not have AP credit or
college transfer credit and wish to take a
math class, you need to take the math

placement test. Those who have AP cred
it are encouraged to take the test as well
for placement purposes. Math placement
tests last an hour. Take them on comput
ers in dorm clusters. Plan to take the test
before you meet with your adviser. Your
score, which you will get as soon as you
finish the test, is personal information
that you use strictly to decide which math
class you will enroll in at Stanford. Check
your Orientation calendar for times and
locations.
Chemistry: If you want to take chem
istry at Stanford and do not have A P cred
it or transfer credit, you should lake the
online placement exam, which also takes
about one hour. Your score is confiden
tial and will be used to place you in a
chemistry course on campus. Check your
Orientation calendar for limes and loca
tions.
Foreign languages: The University re
quires all students to achieve competency
in a foreign language equal to a third
quarter, first-year course. If you have
studied a foreign language and plan to
take the same language at Stanford, you
need to take the placement test to deter
mine which class to take. Some students
have completed the written section of the
test online over the summer. The oral
exam is still required, and times for these
tests are listed in the Orientation guide.
Students who have not taken the online
section should contact the department of
that language.
Q: How do I find my way around campus?
A: An excellent question, since navigat
ing around an N,ISO-acre campus where
every building looks vaguely like Taco

Bell can trip up even those who are handy
with a compass.
First, some words of warning: Hoover
Tower serves as a poor landmark because
it looks the same from all four sides. Our
best advice: Carry a map with you, and
don't be afraid to ask for directions. We
all did when we were frosh.
Q: If I'm having trouble with a class, can I
get a tutor?
A: The answer is probably yes. The Cen
ter for Teaching and Learning gets about
2.(MX) requests for help each year and is
usually able to accommodate them. In ad
dition, the CTL offers math and chem
istry tutoring. Writing tutors are also
available, but students are encouraged to
try to make appointments for these.
In addition, many dorms have tutors,
and some departments offer tutoring for
their classes. For tutoring information,
call the CTL at 723-1326. Another option
is to check the Community Information
Board near the BASS ticket agency booth
in Tresidder Union. There you can find
people who are willing to tutor in various
subjects, particularly foreign languages.
Q: How do I add my e-mail address,
phone number and room number to the
directory?
A: You can add information to update
your file on the online whois system by
signing into your Axess account on the
World Wide Web. Once you have logged
on, go to the "Demographics" prompt.
After editing the appropriate informa
tion, make sure to update the database.
The new information should appear with
in 24 hours in the directory.
