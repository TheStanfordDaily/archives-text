# This old house: who's been sleeping in my bed?

Welcome to Stanford, and wel
come to your new dormitory — your
home for the next nine months. As
you become acquainted with the
campus, you will begin to discover
that there is a lot of history here. Your
dormitory is definitely no exception.
Here is a brief history of each dor
mitory or house that will be home to
freshmen during this 1997-98 school
year.
Branner Hall
Branner sucks. Period. That is
how everybody feels, unless you actu
ally live there; it is an unofficial Stan
ford rule. Branner is the largest all
frosh dorm on campus, and every
year, the Brannerites are generally
known to be the most boisterous, ob
noxious group of frosh on campus.
Their annoying chants at football
games and their annual disruption of
Gaieties, the Big Game week musi
cal, have annoyed other students for
decades.
However, Branner was not always
known for its obnoxiousness. The
dormitory opened in 1924, named
after John Casper Branner, Stan
ford's president from 1913-15. Origi
nally an all-women's dormitory, the
dorm changed between all-male and
all-female several times before even
tually becoming one of the first coed
dorms on campus. When only women
lived there, the urinals in the bath
rooms were reportedly made into
flower pots of a sort. During one of
the all-female periods, current
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor made her home there.
Recently, Branner has been home
to its "Branner Presents" speaker se
ries, which brings people from the
campus and beyond to discuss issues
and events. The dorm also puts out a
semi-yearly literary magazine.
Though Branner features two-room
triples today, only two people origi
nally were to be assigned to each set

of rooms.
Florence Moore Hall
Otherwise known as Flo Mo, this
dormitory opened in the fall of 1956.
The dorm made headlines for its in
credible cost. The structure with
seven different divisions — Alondra,
Cardenal, Faisan, Gavilan, Loro,
Mirlo and Paloma — cost over $2.65
million to build. Of that, over $1 mil
lion was donated by Florence Moore.
Her husband, Robert Moore, joins
her in having a residence named after
him, a row house called Robert S.
Moore South or, more commonly,
Bob.
Over the years, Flo Mo has flip
flopped between being an all-male
and an all-female residence; it cur
rently is coed. It has been renovated
several times. An improvements pro
ject was completed in 1975, costing
$1.3 million. Housing for about 1 (K)
students was also added in the 1975
renovation.
Flo Mo may best be known for two
things. First, it houses the only resi
dential Introduction to the Humani
ties track: Structured Liberal Educa
tion or SLE. Second, ice cream is
served daily in the dining hall. The
often recounted story is that Florence
Moore gave the money to build the
residence on the condition the dessert
be served every day.
Lagunita Court
The set of dorms, which also
shares its name with Stanford's occa
sionally full artificial lake, was con
structed in 1933. Today it is home to
five different four-class sections:
Adelfa, Eucalipto, Granada, Naranja
and Ujamaa.
Occasionally referred to affection
ately as "the fire trap," Lagunita has
seen at least one major fire in its his
tory. The resident fellows' apartment
in West Lagunita burned down in
November 1974. The fire, which
caused $ 12,(XX) in damage, was ruled
to be accidental.

In March of 1976, the Olivo Mag
nolia house, as it was called then,
changed its name to Ujamaa, a
Swahili word meaning "familyhood."
Ujamaa is the African-American eth
nic theme dorm.
Roble Hall
The oldest active dormitory on
campus, Roble Hall arguably has the
most interesting history of any dorm
on campus.
Roble — which means "oak" in
Spanish — opened in its current loca
tion in 1918 as a women's residence.
When it was constructed, records
showed it was built entirely with rein
forced concrete. However, it was dis
covered in a 1987 review of dormito
ries for earthquake safety that the
records were incorrect.
After discovering that the exteri
or walls were made of a hollow clay
tile with a reinforced concrete floor
and frame, Roble was determined to
be the least safe building on campus
in the case of an earthquake.
It was so unsafe, in fact, the Uni
versity decided to close the dormito
ry. On Dec. 19, 1987, it closed its
doors and its residents were relocat
ed when they came back from winter
break. Many of the 294 displaced stu
dents tried to convince the university
to let them stay through the year, say
ing they would take their chances.
However, their pleas were to no
avail.
Stern Hall
Lucie Stern Hall, the concrete
block of dormitories located on the
eastern portion of campus, opened in
1949. The $ 1.2-million dormitory was
partially built on money given by
"Aunt" Lucie Stern, a Palo Alto so
cialite known for her weekly dinner
parties for Stanford students.
A long-time Stanford benefactor,
made an honorary member of the
student body in 1941 by the ASSIJ,
Stern passed away in 1946. She left a

bequest in her will for $4(X),(KX) to
build a men's dormitory, and ulti
mately another $2(K).(KX) from her es
tate was given to Stanford to build the
dorm that would bear her name.
Stern Hall's unique, very square
architectural style has been much
maligned since before its opening.
Renovated in 1995, Stern now is the
color of a slightly pale pumpkin. Six
different houses are in Stern: Bur
bank, Donner, Larkin, Serra, Twain
and Casa Zapata, the Chicano/ Lati
no theme dorm. Stern is also home to
Lucie's Late Night Pizza.
Wilbur Hall
Wilbur Hall, built in 1956, was
named after Ray Lyman Wilbur, who

became Stanford's president in 1916.
He retired as president in 1941, but he
actually stayed on as president until
1943 while a replacement was found.
He also served as the Secretary of the
Interior under U.S. President Her
bert Hoover, a Stanford alumnus,
from 1929 to 1933.
Wilbur has been known as a
perennially unpopular residence.
However, it gained a new life after
renovation in 1993. It consists of eight
houses: Arroyo, Cedro, Junipero,
Okada, Otero, Rinconada, Soto and
Trancos.
Sterling Quad
This will be the first year that

freshmen will reside in Sterling
Quad: the dorm once reknowned
only for its distance from the heart
of campus and now known as the
home of the Freshman / Sopho
more College.
Built in 1982 and named after
Stanford's fifth president. J.E. Wal
lace Sterling, Sterling Quad's four
houses were originally coed and
home to all undergrads except the
freshmen class.
Of the four houses in the dorm,
Schiff and Adams have been select
ed to house the participants of the
new Freshman / Sophomore Col
lege.
The two adjacent houses. Potter
and Robinson, will retain their sta
tus as coed, upperclass dorms.
