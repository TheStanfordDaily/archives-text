# Can't wait for Full Moon on the Quad
## A 						note to the lovelorn, unscrewed roommates on dating at Stanford 
### Patrick Bernhardt Senior staff writer 
This weekend, hundreds of
hours will be spent preparing the
Stanford class of 2002 for the chal
lenges awaiting them over the next
four years. But for the all the pomp
and circumstancc, the message you
should take away is simple:
"Freshmen, welcome to the
Farm, where the winds of freedom
blow, everyone hates the Weenies,
and no one ever dates."
There is no disputing the first
two parts of that message. There
are also few disputes with the third.
Some — in the minority — will try
to refute the third with anecdotes
or by parading about with their sig
nificant others, attempting to
prove the claim a myth.
The problem, however, is not
imagined. It is sufficiently serious
to merit concern from even the
highest of Stanford officials. Ad
dressing Sophomore College. Stan
ford's summer seminars for sec
ond-year students, one year. Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
offered hope to the romantically
disenfranchised.
"You can make a choice,"
Casper proclaimed. "You can go
out on a date."
Statistics would indicate that the
solution might be that simple. 11er
ant Katchadourian. a professor of
psychiatry, behavioral sciences and
human biology, conducted an in
depth, decade-long study on the
Stanford class of 1981.
Ten percent of his sample set

married another Stanford student.
An additional 10 percent married
someone they met in graduate
school — presumably, for some
portion of the group, also at Stan
ford.
However, statistics offer little
help to those caught on the losing
end — like my freshman room
mate.
Soon after arriving on campus,
my roommate noticed an incredi
bly attractive woman in his Chem
31 class. She was, he relayed, a Pre-
Med Goddess — a PMG.
He could not, however, muster
the chutzpah to ask her out. He
plotted and planned for weeks for
the perfect opportunity to dazzle
her with his witty banter and hope
fully become her life-long soul
mate. His chance finally came with
our dormitory's annual Screw
Your Roommate.
The SYR — its name derived
from the ancient fraternity parties
where members set up their friends
with the ugliest women they could
find — is. these days the most im
portant social event for anyone
seeking love. Almost every dormi
tory, at some point during the year,
will hold one.
It goes something like this: you
will convince your roommate to
ask out the date of your choosing,
and everyone will pretend it's a
blind date, ignoring the fact you
didn't have the courage to make
the date yourself.
For the PMG. 1 recruited a mu
tual female friend to ask the PMG
out for mv roommate. While 1 sat

in the room, she placed the call on
my speakerphone. The question
was posed. The obligatory pause
was allowed while the PMG and
whoever else happened to be in her
room traded glances and quickly
dove for the freshman face book.
Out of courtesy, my accomplice re
peated my roommate's name and.
in deference to its complexity,
spelled it.
The pause seemed to last forev
er. Finally the PMG drew in an au
dible breath on the other end and
quickly, but clearly so as not to con
fuse the message, replied:
"I'msorrybutlhavetogooutoftown
thatweekendbye." Silence — and
eventually a dial tone — followed.
"Well." 1 said after hanging up
the phone, "maybe it's her grand
mother's Wth birthday."
"Yeah," my accomplice replied
sharing a look that did not convinc
ingly convey her agreement.
My roommate took the rejec
tion well when I told him, shrug
ging off the defeat and turning back
to his calculus, but, as I discovered
later, it weighed heavy on his mind.
Later that night, after we had
both gone to bed, he laid staring at
the ceiling. The pressure of class,
the SY Rand other things that I was
never fully aware pushed him over
a line. He admitted — as many
other Stanford students do — his
desperation in a single sentence re
peated every night for the next six
months in what, by his own admis
sion, was the most pathetic time of
his life.
"Pat," he whined. "1 need a

woman."
I have witnessed too many good
men and women reach this point.
For my roommate there were other
PMGs, but none induced the same
enthusiasm.
Deflated, many victims of Stan
ford's social environment, such as
my roommate, never seem to re
cover, They drift hopelessly
through four years of half-hearted
hopes of happiness.
But the problem isn't irre
versible. Life, unlike an honors the
ses, is best without extensive plan
ning.
My roommate spent his entire
freshman year pining over women
he knew only from afar, but Fate
eventually smiled on him. Eight
days before the end of the year, he
met a woman in the most informal
of settings: our dorm lobby. Within
an hour of meeting, this woman ap
peared at our door. Before 1 could
even politely excuse myself, phone
numbers were exchanged, and a
date was made.
Despite finals, the two of them
saw each other often and success
fully carried their budding ro
mance into the next year.
It seems that President Casper's
words might well hold the solution
to the dating problem at this uni
versity: let go of your insecurities
and Fate may smile upon you.
If it doesn't, you can console
yourself as the rest of us unlucky
souls do. Remember: if you don't
find love in this environment, I,6(XJ
new freshmen arrive one year from
today.
