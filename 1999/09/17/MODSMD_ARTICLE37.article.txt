# Keep yourself safe from crime on campus
## 
### Frank Guinan Jennifer Stewart Staff writer 
Greetings from cheery resident
assistants, helping hands from smil
ing Orientation Volunteers and in
troductions to 1(X) new light-hearted
faces. Stanford seems like a pretty se
cure place to many new students.
In making the transition to cam
pus life, however, freshmen and
transfer students often become over
ly trusting and rather careless during
their first few days on the Farm.
And why shouldn't they? In a re
cent study of 58 schools called
"Crime at College: the Student
Guide to Public Safety," Stanford
was ranked one of the 15 safest cam
puses in the nation.
But don't be fooled. Crime does
occur here on the Farm — and the
atmosphere of Orientation can be
the ideal time for crooks to make
their mark.
In most cases, however, simple
precautionary measures can help
deter theft from ruining a good first
year.
Lock up that hike
For the past decade and a half, the
number one reported crime on cam
pus has been bicycle theft.
Bike theft soared as high as 8(X)
bikes a year in the early to mid
nineties. However, the number has
dropped in recent years due to a re

cent $1-million project devoted to
improving facilities for bicyclists.
Last year nearly 4(X) bicycles were
stolen. Two hundred thirteen were
stolen in 1997.
Since 1995, Stanford's bicycle
program has created enclosures for
550 bikes and installed or upgraded
3,(XX) bike rack spaces, said the Stan
ford Report.
In addition to creating new
spaces, the program has also freed up
existing spaces by cracking down on
abandoned bikes. Abandoned bikes
occupy bike racks and can make
other hikes vulnerable to theft.
But Stanford Police speculate the
actual number of thefts is twice that
number, because many do not both
er to report their stolen bikes.
To avoid becoming one of the
many unfortunate victims, the police
advise students to lock up their bicy
cles. Although U-locks are the most
effective locking devices, Stanford
police also recommend a safety de
vice known as "Bad Bones," which
span the length of the lock and can
make it five times stronger.
In recent years the Stanford Po
lice have worked to be more visible
and catch more bike thieves. Police
stress the necessity of registering
bikes. As Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer told the Daily in
1998, "without a victim, we can't
prosecute [a thief]."
Dorm room safetv

Ideally, dorm residences are sup
posed to be locked up after midnight.
This is usually not the case, however,
since students go in and out of their
dorms well after that time. Many
choose to prop the door open as they
make their early morning rounds.
Fortunately, burglars do not usu
ally try their luck in the dorms after
midnight. Instead, many know when
students won't be in and hit the
dorms while most students are at
lunch, dinner or in the shower.
In the last two years there have
been an average of nearly 150 struc
tural burglaries.
There is, however, a simple solu
tion to keep from becoming a statis
tic— keep doors locked whenever
rooms are empty, even if it will be for
a short period of time.
Concerns about assault
Compared to property crime,
"body crime" (like aggravated and
sexual assault) is relatively rare on
the Stanford campus.
Most sexual assaults are acquain
tance (or date) rape and often in
volve alcohol, say police.
The Department of Public Safety
strongly recommends using routes
highlighted on the Suggested Travel
Routes Map. They may take longer,
but they're well traveled, adequately
lighted and located in open areas.
SU RE Escort Service is also avail
able and will accompany students by
motorized cart anywhere on campus.

Students can contact the free service
by calling 725-SURE.
Perhaps the most important
crime-busting tip is personal aware
ness and responsibility. If a situation
feels suspicious or threatening,
change directions, go to a populated
area, call a friend to meet you or call
9-911 from a campus phone or 911

from an off-campus phone.
If you are the victim of a crime,
call the police immediately — when a
crime goes unreported, a criminal
may attack again. Also make sure to
report any suspicious persons, vehi
cles or activities to the police.
In order to help those who have
been sexually assaulted, the Sexual

Assault Resource Center located in
Cowell Student Health Center is
open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday for information and
counseling. In addition the Campus
Sexual Assault and Recovery Team
is available 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (also in
Cowell) and operates 24-hour crisis
services.
