## University stresses education, not enforcement 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Freshmen arriving at Stanford will
soon be given a crash course in learn
ing how to live with roommates,
dorm food and alcohol.
After the wave of recent alcohol
related deaths, university adminis
trators across the nation are cracking
down on alcohol consumption.
While Stanford has not embraced
the extreme measures used at other
institutions, it has a two-year-old pol
icy focusing on alcohol use on cam
pus.
While Stanford's official alcohol
policy dictates that minors (those
under age 21) must not be served al
cohol, even Stanford police captain
Marvin Moore acknowledges that
underage drinking occurs.
Moore stressed that the Stanford
police's policy embraces education
about alcohol.
"This is a learning environment
where people are learning how to
make decisions," said Moore, "and
incorporated into our enforcement
posture is the learning and education
al component. The best solution is ed
ucation because it helps young peo
ple understand dangerous drinking."
The police department collabo
rates with the dean of students as well
as Cowell Health Center to educate
students about alcohol, said Moore.
One of the programs which Stan
ford uses to educate new students
about alcohol is the video
"Up2U@Stanford." The video,
which addresses drinking and alco
hol-related issues, is shown in student
residences as part of orientation for
new students. Residence staff then
lead a discussion about alcohol use.
One of the missions of the Stan
ford police department is to ensure
that alcohol use does not become a
problem at the University. As of now,
Moore does not believe that Stanford

has a disproportionate number of
problems with alcohol.
"Based on what 1 consider real,
true problems [with drinking]. Stan
ford does not have more than any
body else," said Moore. "Do we have
a number of kids doing underage
drinking? Yes. Do we sometimes
have lite and death situations regard
ing underage drinking? Yes."
Moore believes that the key to
preventing problems with alcohol use
is moderation in alcohol consump
tion.
"You have to have a handle on al
cohol and not let alcohol have a han
dle on you. This all depends on mod
eration."
However, the police department
will not hesitate to intervene if alco
hol, or use of alcohol, becomes a
problem.
"If alcohol is the problem, we treat
it as the problem. If it is not the prob
lem we do not go out of the way top
make it an issue," he said.
"We will make arrests and issue ci
tations if people are blatant to flaunt
it in our face," said Moore.
In addition to prohibiting alcohol
consumption by minors, Stanford's
alcohol policy also prohibits the serv
ing of alcohol to "obviously intoxicat
ed" party-goers.
Stanford's alcohol policy also
spawned the "Stanfordspeak" term
"EAN AB," which stands for equally
attractive non-alcoholic beverages.
The alcohol policy requires that alco
hol cannot be served unless "equally
attractive non-alcoholic beverages
are made available and are easily ac
cessible throughout your event."
Stanford has not adopted mea
sures taken by other universities to
combat problems with alcohol, which
include creating substance-free hous
ing and attempts to limit student ac
cess to alcohol.
The University of Kentucky has
become a dry campus. The university
does not permit any alcohol to be sold

on campus, and prohibits drinking in
all undergraduate residences.
U.S. News and World Report
writes that The University of Wiscon
sin-Madison and the University of
Colorado-Boulder no longer allow
alcohol to be sold at sporting events.
Stanford has not taken such steps.
Last year alcohol was served at the
Coffee 1 louse, a campus meeting
place, and alcohol remains übiqui
tous at fraternity parties and dorm
bashes.
Last year's senior class even spon
sored a series of "Senior Class Pub
Nights" in which seniors met with
friends and classmates at local bars.

Traditionally, underage drinkers
have obtained much of their alcohol
from fraternity parties. Now. even
fraternity parties may be drying up.
"We are trying to get back to what
fraternity is all about — scholarship,
service and leadership," said
Jonathan Brant, executive vice presi
dent of the National Interfraternity
Conference, in an interview given to
U.S. News and World Report.
Several national fraternities, in
cluding Phi Delta Theta, have an
nounced plans to go dry by the year
2000.
Both of Stanford's housed
sororities. Delta Delta Delta and

Kappa Alpha Theta, have dry resi
dences.
There is a middle ground between
the stricter policies being implement
ed at other school's and Stanford's
current approach towards alcohol,
Moore believes.
"I think room for improvement
within Stanford, and I think that
other policies can be "knee jerk" and
excessive. They can be difficult to en
force and can be non-productive.
You have to be a realist. Are kids
going to pursue alcohol underage?
Yes. they are. Is there anything the
school can do to create pure prohibi
tion? No, there is not," Moore said.

The University of Delaware has
stiffened penalties for students
caught drinking and for related of
fenses. U.S. News and World Report
said that among other features, the
school's new policy includes manda
tory suspensions after a third offense
for underage drinking.
Moore said that at Stanford the
consequences for students caught
drinking under age differ according
to the individual policies of each
judge within the court system. How
ever, typical first-time offenders
would likely receive counseling, a
small fine and perform a certain
amount of community service.
