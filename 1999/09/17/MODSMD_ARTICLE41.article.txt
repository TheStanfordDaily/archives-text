# Cardinal season full of unanswered questions
## Quarterback, receivers look solid; question marks include defense, running game 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
They're cooked.
That was the general consensus,
on campus and off, about the 1999
Stanford football team (1-1,1-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference 4) after the
squad was handed a 69-17 defeat in
a game where the Cardinal pulled
off an uncanny imitation of a limp
fish.
But that was last week. This
week, after a convincing 54-17
drubbing of the far-more-limp
Washington State Cougars (0-2, 0-
1) on Saturday, a question about
the Cardinal's chances this season
meets with far more confusion and
far less conviction. A shrug of the
shoulders is all most can muster as
an answer to the question of the
Cardinal's chances to win the req
uisite six games to head to a bowl at
the end of this season.
This year's team is undoubtedly

more experienced. The team re
turns 19 starters, all but 26 of last
year's running yards and 3,216 of
the team's Pac-10 leading 3,516
yards in the air. On defense, the
team has lost only two players and
retains last year's top four tacklers.
On special teams, junior Mike
Biselli had not made a field goal or
a PAT until this season, but is more
than holding his own in the 1999
campaign, netting a Pac-10 Player
of the Week award this week along
with junior linebacker Riall John
son.
"We have some obvious con
cerns," head coach Tyrone Willing
ham said. "But we also have areas
on our team that we feel very good
about.
"A lot of our young players re
ceived important game experience
last season and it is our job as a
coaching staff to bring them along
to the next level and continue to
improve as a team," he said.

However, few expect the Cardi
nal to blow out its next opponent as
easily as it did the Cougars. Tomor
row, the team travels to Tucson,
Ariz., to take on the No. 19 Arizona
Wildcats (2-1, 0-0). And the rest of
the season is equally cloudy.
Stanford senior quarterback
Todd Husak is undoubtedly one of
the team's biggest strengths. As a
junior, Husak led the Cardinal
squad, covering 3,092 yards in the
air last season, which made him
Stanford's third quarterback to
throw for more than 3.0(H) yards in
a season. He also set the Stanford
single-game record for passing
yardage by throwing for 450 yards
against Oregon State.
"He is an intelligent quarter
back." Willingham said. "He has
good decision-making skills and
has proven to have the ability to
throw the football."
So far this season, Husak has
lived up to expectations. In the

Cardinal's miserable 69-17 loss to
Texas. Husak finished 15 for 39 for
205 yards and one touchdown, a 37-
yarder. Against Washington Slate
last week, Husak looked stellar,
leading the offense to 54 points and
going 17 of 24 for 215 yards and
three touchdowns. More impor
tantly, Husak looked sharp in the
game, snapping passes efficiently
to his receivers while not throwing
an interception.
In addition to Husak. Stanford is
lucky to have what is arguably the
deepest team in the nation at quar
terback. Supporting Husak is a duo
of quality backups in juniors Randy
Fasani and Joe Borchard.
While the quarterback is the
right hand of Stanford's offense,
the receiving corps is the left — and
few doubt its quality. Many, includ
ing Willingham, consider it the
highlight of this year's squad.
Stanford's most experienced
and threatening receiver is senior
Troy Walters. Despite playing only
six full games last season, he held
the all-time school record for re
ceiving yards before this season
began with 2.530. Against Texas
and Washington State, Walters
caught 13 passes for 169 yards.
Add senior DeKonnie Pitts and
junior Dave Davis, and the re
ceivers begin to comprise Stan
ford's biggest threat.
The running game, on the other
hand, is a bigger question mark for
the Cardinal. The most notable
event has been the emergence of
freshman Kerry Carter — one of
the most prized recruits for the
football team this year — as a big
time running back.
In 1998. Stanford rushed for just
831 yards, an average of 75 per
game.
"We must improve our running
game il we are to compete for post
season play," Willingham said be
fore the season began. "11 we slay
healthy and play to our potential,
then we can be a productive unit."
Junior Coy Wire developed into
the Cardinal's leading running
back last season before being side
lined for the last five games with a
dislocated thumb. After the loss of
Wire, the Cardinal's running attack
was never able to bounce back.
But Wire is back this season, and
so far has started both games in the
back field.
But the other news in the back
field is the addition of Carter. After
performing well in his college
debut against Texas, Carter carried
the ball 10 times for 37 yards
against Washington State, includ
ing a nine-yard touchdown run. In
the first two games, he has carried

the ball 19 times for 106 yards.
But, according to Willingham,
the starting job is safe in Wire's
hands for now.
"I think that any time you take a
player, you want to be very patient
in how you bring him along," he
said. "[Carter's] making fine
progress, but I'll be very patient
with him and what 1 give him. mak
ing sure that I don't give him too
much."
On defense, Stanford has to an
swer much larger questions.
In 1998, the Cardinal gave up an
average of 33.2 points per game.
And starting off a season by giving
up 69 points wasn't the best way to
turn that around.
And while Stanford held Wash
ington State to 17 points, there are
few teams on the schedule like the
Cougars.
Against Arizona tomorrow.

both the pass and run defenses will
be tested. Arizona boasts a talent
ed quarterback duo in seniors
Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins
and a foreboding running back in
junior Trung Canidate.
According to Willingham, the
game against Arizona "will be the
greatest challenge to date."
The defensive line is anchored
by senior Willie Howard, who
forced a fumble at the beginning of
Saturday's game. Senior Riall
Johnson, who recorded five sacks
last week and was named Pac-10
defensive Player of the Week, will
help the defensive line up front.
In the secondary, the Cardinal
boasts experience at every posi
tion. Senior strong safety Tim
Smith will be joined by senior cor
nerbacks Chris Johnson and Frank
Primus and sophomore free safety
Tank Williams.

team has lost only two players and
retains last year's top four tacklers.
On special teams, junior Mike
Biselli had not made a field goal or
a PAT until this season, but is more
than holding his own in the 1999
campaign, netting a Pac-10 Player
of the Week award this week along
with junior linebacker Riall John
son.
"We have some obvious con
cerns," head coach Tyrone Willing
ham said. "But we also have areas
on our team that we feel very good
about.
"A lot of our young players re
ceived important game experience
last season and it is our job as a
coaching staff to bring them along
to the next level and continue to
improve as a team," he said.

However, few expect the Cardi
nal to blow out its next opponent as
easily as it did the Cougars. Tomor
row, the team travels to Tucson,
Ariz., to take on the No. 19 Arizona
Wildcats (2-1, 0-0). And the rest of
the season is equally cloudy.
Stanford senior quarterback
Todd Husak is undoubtedly one of
the team's biggest strengths. As a
junior, Husak led the Cardinal
squad, covering 3,092 yards in the
air last season, which made him
Stanford's third quarterback to
throw for more than 3.0(H) yards in
a season. He also set the Stanford
single-game record for passing
yardage by throwing for 450 yards
against Oregon State.
"He is an intelligent quarter
back." Willingham said. "He has
good decision-making skills and
has proven to have the ability to
throw the football."
So far this season, Husak has
lived up to expectations. In the

Cardinal's miserable 69-17 loss to
Texas. Husak finished 15 for 39 for
205 yards and one touchdown, a 37-
yarder. Against Washington Slate
last week, Husak looked stellar,
leading the offense to 54 points and
going 17 of 24 for 215 yards and
three touchdowns. More impor
tantly, Husak looked sharp in the
game, snapping passes efficiently
to his receivers while not throwing
an interception.
In addition to Husak. Stanford is
lucky to have what is arguably the
deepest team in the nation at quar
terback. Supporting Husak is a duo
of quality backups in juniors Randy
Fasani and Joe Borchard.
While the quarterback is the
right hand of Stanford's offense,
the receiving corps is the left — and
few doubt its quality. Many, includ
ing Willingham, consider it the
highlight of this year's squad.
Stanford's most experienced
and threatening receiver is senior
Troy Walters. Despite playing only
six full games last season, he held
the all-time school record for re
ceiving yards before this season
began with 2.530. Against Texas
and Washington State, Walters
caught 13 passes for 169 yards.
Add senior DeKonnie Pitts and
junior Dave Davis, and the re
ceivers begin to comprise Stan
ford's biggest threat.
The running game, on the other
hand, is a bigger question mark for
the Cardinal. The most notable
event has been the emergence of
freshman Kerry Carter — one of
the most prized recruits for the
football team this year — as a big
time running back.
In 1998. Stanford rushed for just
831 yards, an average of 75 per
game.
"We must improve our running
game il we are to compete for post
season play," Willingham said be
fore the season began. "11 we slay
healthy and play to our potential,
then we can be a productive unit."
Junior Coy Wire developed into
the Cardinal's leading running
back last season before being side
lined for the last five games with a
dislocated thumb. After the loss of
Wire, the Cardinal's running attack
was never able to bounce back.
But Wire is back this season, and
so far has started both games in the
back field.
But the other news in the back
field is the addition of Carter. After
performing well in his college
debut against Texas, Carter carried
the ball 10 times for 37 yards
against Washington State, includ
ing a nine-yard touchdown run. In
the first two games, he has carried

the ball 19 times for 106 yards.
But, according to Willingham,
the starting job is safe in Wire's
hands for now.
"I think that any time you take a
player, you want to be very patient
in how you bring him along," he
said. "[Carter's] making fine
progress, but I'll be very patient
with him and what 1 give him. mak
ing sure that I don't give him too
much."
On defense, Stanford has to an
swer much larger questions.
In 1998, the Cardinal gave up an
average of 33.2 points per game.
And starting off a season by giving
up 69 points wasn't the best way to
turn that around.
And while Stanford held Wash
ington State to 17 points, there are
few teams on the schedule like the
Cougars.
Against Arizona tomorrow.

both the pass and run defenses will
be tested. Arizona boasts a talent
ed quarterback duo in seniors
Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins
and a foreboding running back in
junior Trung Canidate.
According to Willingham, the
game against Arizona "will be the
greatest challenge to date."
The defensive line is anchored
by senior Willie Howard, who
forced a fumble at the beginning of
Saturday's game. Senior Riall
Johnson, who recorded five sacks
last week and was named Pac-10
defensive Player of the Week, will
help the defensive line up front.
In the secondary, the Cardinal
boasts experience at every posi
tion. Senior strong safety Tim
Smith will be joined by senior cor
nerbacks Chris Johnson and Frank
Primus and sophomore free safety
Tank Williams.
