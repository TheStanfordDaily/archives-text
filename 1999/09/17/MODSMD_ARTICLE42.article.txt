# Redemption for Card comes in form of Cougars

There was only one cure for what was ailing the
Stanford football team after it suffered an embarrass
ing 69-17 drubbing at the hands of Texas nearly two
weeks ago: win. and win big.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal (1 -1,1-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) followed that prescription down to the letter,
handing a hapless Washington State team (0-2. 0-1) a
shocking 54-17 defeat in the Stanford's home opener
in front 36,592 fans.
In fact, there were more demons that Stanford
needed to chase out than just the loss to Texas. Before
last week, Stanford had won only four of the past 18
games. The end of the Cardinal's 1997 season — five
straight losses, forgiven only by a win in the last game
of the season against California — was disappointing.
A win in Big Game was also the saving grace of the

1998 season, when the Cardinal finished with a 3-8
record.
After opening the 1999 season with the loss against
Texas two weeks ago, it looked like Stanford might
have been in for another miserable fall. However, at

least for the Cardinal, Saturday's blowout of the
Cougars was a breath of fresh air.
"I think everyone's excited because winning is far
better than losing. And much more enjoyable." head
coach Tyrone Willingham said this week. "I think I've

been guilty of saying that even the water tastes better'
when you win. and it's true. My eup of water was pret
ty good the other day."
It took but two plays for Stanford to show that Sat
urday's result wasn't going to end up the same as the
game a week earlier.
After junior Mike Biselli's kickoff to Washington
State. Cougar senior quarterback Steve Birnbaum's.
first play was an incomplete pass. The second was a
handoff to junior Adam I lawkins. who was able to gain
a single yard before the wheels came off the Cougar at
tack.
Hawkins ran into Cardinal senior tackle Willie
Howard, who forced the ball out of Hawkins' hands..
Cardinal senior linebacker Riall Johnson was there to
pounce on it.and. like magic. Stanford already had the
ball on Washington State's 32-yard line.
Senior quarterback Todd Husak — who finished
the night with 215 yards and three touchdown passes
— took the helm of the offense. Four complete passes
in four attempts moved the Cardinal to the Washing-!
ton State five-yard line. !
Husak took the snap on the next play and stepped
into the pocket, scanning right for receivers. Finding'
none, he glanced left, then darted from the pocket for
the left side of the end zone. In a snap. Husak reached
the one-yard line, launched himself in the air, and leapt
away from a pursuing tackier and into the end zone.
Stanford led 7-0. And Stanford felt the weight of the
past year and a half lifting, just a bit. from its shoulders.
"1 think that's something we really needed," Husak,
said. "I think we realized that we were not as bad as we!
played last week. I think there were some guys doubt
ing themselves, and hopefully all that is gone after this
performance."
Stanford went on to terrorize the Cougars in the air
and on the ground. Husak's 17-of-24 performance in
cluded a 44-yard touchdown throw to senior Troy Wal
ters.a 12-yarder to junior Dave Davis and an IN-yarder

The Cardinal also scored on a
nine-yard run by freshman Kerry
Carter, who rushed 10 times for 37
yards.
But the Cardinal scoring attack
was not limited to the offense.
Washington State's four turnovers
led to 28 Stanford points, including
a blocked punt by senior Emory
Brock which he recovered for a
touchdown and junior Reuben
Carter's interception of a Birn
baum pass at the end of the first
quarter that he returned for a 67-
yard touchdown.
Senior Riall Johnson led the de

fensive attack, tormenting the
Cougar's quarterbacks for five
sacks, including one for a safety
that put the last two points on the
board for the Cardinal.
"We needed to go out anu act
like dogs and be vicious." Howard
said. "Riall [Johnson] showed us
that mentality of a trench dog
tonight."

placekicker Mike Biselli, who
kicked a career-best 52-yard field
goal and was 7 for 7 on PATs, gar
