## Women's volleyball looks to Hawaii, fifth title 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
When you think of Christmas
time, you think of snow falling, pine
trees and a crackling fire burning in
the fireplace. This year, however,
the Stanford women's volleyball
team is thinking of white sand
beaches, swaying palm trees and
Santa wearing a grass skirt.
With five returning starters and
an infusion of new talent, the Cardi
nal has its sights set on a winter
break in Hawaii, site of this year's
NC A A championships and a shot at
the school's fifth national title.
Stanford begins the season
ranked second in the AVCA-USA
Today Top 25 Coaches' Poll, just be
hind Penn State, last year's NCAA
runner-up. The Cardinal also
ranked first in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence preseason coaches' poll with 89
out of a possible 90 points, six points
ahead of UCLA.
Stanford, led by head coach Don
Shaw, comes into the 1999 season
with a number of emerging, talented
players in addition to seasoned vet
erans. Although losing many key
players from the 1997 team, last
year's squad gained valuable experi
ence in amassing a 27-4 record and
winning the school's-fifth straight
conference title.
Leading the incoming class is
freshman Logan Tom, a six-foot,
one-inch outside hitter from Salt
Lake City, Utah, the 1998 Gatorade
National Player of the Year.
Tom, who chose Stanford over a
spot on the U.S. National team,
brings a variety of skills to the Cardi
nal lineup.
Joining Tom is fellow freshman
and outside hitter Ashley Ivy of Ar
lington, Texas, who, like Tom, has
seen extensive action with the U.S.
Junior National Team.
The most difficult task for Shaw
and his staff is integrating the new
players with an already talented
Cardinal unit that has won the last
five Pac-lOchuiypionslups.
"We've got tocover a lot of mate
rial early," Shaw said. "These fresh
men do a good job playing hard and
communicating."
Shaw also said the players on the
team who dealt with injuries during
the past year have progressed well.
He expects junior Robyn Lewis to
rejoin the team in September and
said that redshirt freshman Lindsey
Yamasaki is progressing slowly but
well following leg problems. He
added that senior Kerri Walsh's
shoulder has been holding well in
these opening days of practice,
though she is not letting loose on it
vet.
So far, things seem to be fitting
together very well. Stanford returns
to campus after an 11-day roadtrip
where the squad posted a 3-1 record
with victories over 1 louston, Tulane
and Louisiana State. The only loss
came at the hands of Texas, who
eliminated Stanford in the NCAA
tournament last December.
Against Louisiana State, sopho

more middle blocker Sara Sandrik
tallied a career-high 11 blocks to
lead Stanford to a four-game victory
(15-4, 15-7,12-15,15-3).
Early in the season, Tom has
lived up to the lofty expectations
that surrounded her arrival on the
Farm. In the LSU match she record
ed a team-high 21 kills, building on
her 17-kill performance in her debut
against Tulane.
Stanford hits the road again this
week, traveling to the Pacific North
west to square off against Washing
ton on Sept. 16 and Washington
State on Sept. 17. The Cardinal re
turns to the Bay Area to face Cali
fornia before opening at home
against Utah on Sept. 24.
As the Cardinal looks ahead to
the season, Shaw hopes to capitalize
on the combination of both new and
returning talent to mold the team
into a cohesive unit.
Stanford's net play, according to
Shaw, has been one of its greatest
strengths with its strong hitting and
blocking. The outside hitting posi
tion contains some of Stanford's
most experienced players. Three
time AVCA All-American Walsh's
career on the Farm began in a Hurry
in 1996, when she was named most
outstanding player of the NCAA
tournament. Coming into her senior
season, Walsh returns as the 1998
Pac-10 player of the year, ranking
second in the conference in hitting
percentage (.379) and digs (3.3 per
game).
She ranked eighth in the Pac-10
in kills (3.85 per game) and ranks
third in Stanford volleyball history
in single-season kills and single-sea
son hitting percentage. Her statistics
do not show that she battled a shoul
der injury most of last season.
"It's amazing to think she's been
a three-time first-team All-Ameri
can and hasn't been healthy 100 per
cent," Shaw said. "1 would love to
see her show everybody what she's
capable of doing without any pain."
The other outside hitting spots
could go to a variety of players. Shaw
said he hopes that senior Sarah
Clark, who started all 31 matches
•last season, will contribute effective
ly to the team this season.
"Hopefully, she's going to be
more consistent this year and as a se
nior, really give us solid play at her
position," Shaw said.
Jaimi Gregory rounds out this
year's senior class. An outside hitter
who dealt with leg injuries through
out last year, Gregory returns to this
year's squad as one of its seasoned
veterans.
"The seniors want to go out and
make this their best year and lead
the team to as good a season a it can
have," Shaw said. "Jaimi's going to
do a lot in terms of leadership and
experience to make that happen."
In addition to the three seniors,
Stanford also holds four other out
side hitters, all capable of contribut
ing to the Cardinal's run at the na
tional championship.
Returning for her sophomore
season is Michelle Chambers, an

All-Pac-10 freshman selection who
started for the Cardinal at the begin
ning of conference play. Chambers
tallied 270 kills, 208 digs and 67
blocks last season.
"What she did day in and day out,
both effort- and performance-wise,
was a pleasant surprise," said Shaw.
"She earned a starting spot because
of her consistency. She's going to be
tough to move out of there."
Three newcomers round out
Stanford's outside hitting arsenal.
Yamasaki comes to the team after
leading the women's basketball
team in scoring and rebounding.
"We're planning on having her at
some point, but we don't know
when," said Shaw. "She's an out
standing outside hitter and has great
ball-control."
In addition to Yamasaki, Stan
ford adds the two prized freshmen to
its collection of hitters. Tom is the
third national player of the year to
join the Cardinal in the past four
years. She has significant national
team experience after playing on the
World Championship qualifying
team last winter and on the U.S. Ju
nior National team in 19%, where
she led the team in blocks and kills.
She holds Utah state records for ca
reer kills and service aces.
"I think that she's going to give us
another serious threat out there,"
Shaw said. "It's because she has
great ball-control skills and is so ver
satile — she has everything it takes
to be a great volleyball player."
