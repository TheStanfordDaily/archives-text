# Tom, Logan

Some claimed it was the kiss of death for
the Stanford men's basketball team — Arthur
Lee gracing the cover of last year's Sports Il
lustrated college basketball preview. Now the
entire women's athletic program at Stanford is
being hailed as the best in the country on the
cover of Sports Illustrated for Women, and
freshman Logan Tom is faced with the pres
sure of staring at her face in print.
When athletes such as Tom's teammate,
senior Kerri Walsh, the 1998 Pacific 10 Con
ference Player of the Year, are passed over for
a magazine cover in favor of a freshman, you

know that there is something special inside.
Maybe that's why the U.S. National Team
asked Tom to arid play full time
with the team on which she debuted as a 16-
vear-old.
The six-foot, one-inch outside hitter from
Salt Lake City certainly didn't slip into Stan
ford unnoticcd. The 1998 Gatorade Circle of
Champions National High School Player of
Year, an honor that teammates Walsh and
sophomore Sara Sandrik have won, Tom was
one of the most highly recruited athletes in the
nation — ever.
When Stanford head coach Don Shaw
landed Tom, many believed the move would
guarantee the next four national titles. Shaw
knows there's more to a title than one player,
but he isn't afraid to boast of Tom's talents.
"There's a reason why she was considered
the top reeruit in the country," Shaw said. "It's
because she has great ball-control skills and is
so versatile. She has everything it takes to be a
great volleyball player."
Despite all the hype surrounding Tom in
volleyball circles, the freshman admits that she

has not yet developed ice in her veins, the kind
of fearlessness that put Art Lee on newsstands
around the country. But with nine senior and
17 junior international matches behind her,
she certainly has a wealth of match play to .
draw from. Tom credits ner experience earlier
this month at the Junior World Champi
onships in Saskatoon, Canada, for a smooth
switch to collegiate athletics.
"I was really nervous at first." said Tom,
who left her Stanford team at camp for Cana
da. 'it made me a lot more comfortable going
to the Junior National Team because you play
at a really high level when you're with them.
When I came back, the transition to playing
college ball was much easier."
In Tom's first two matches this season she
recorded 38 kills in helping Stanford improve
to 3-1 (she was in Canada for the. team's first
two games). While she does not need to adjust
her game much to the improved competition,
in her first match she did have to get used to
one thing — sitting on the bench. Shaw held
her out of the first game of her first match.
