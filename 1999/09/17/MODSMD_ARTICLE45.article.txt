# Water Polo sets sights high again
## 
### Erin Bouchier Contributing writer 
With new faces around campus,
fall brings many changes to Stanford.
But some things, like the strength of
the men's water polo team, just seem
to stay the same.
Stanford has enjoyed 20 top-four
rankings in the past 24 seasons and
has made 13 appearances in the
NCAA championship game.
The 1999 season looks to be no dif
ferent. Once again the Cardinal is ex
pected to be one of the nation's top
teams, receiving a No. 2 preseason
ranking.
The team hopes to build on the
success of last season, and it won't
have far to go. In 199K the Cardinal
came within a goal of winning the
NCAA Championship, falling 9-8 to
the USC Trojans in the memorable
double-overtime title game.
Stanford finished the season 21-7
and ranked No. 2 in the country. The
highlight of the season was Stanford's
performance in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) Tourna
ment.
In both 19% and 1997, the Cardi
nal had reached the championship
game of the MPSF Tournament, only
to lose by one goal. This time, Stan
lord lought back to win the league
crown by winning three tough games
in three days, including a dramatic 7-
(i sudden-death overtime win against
USC. I lead coach Dante Dettamanti
called the three-day tournament the
most exciting and competitive three
games in a row that the Stanford
water polo program had ever played.
Gone from that 1998 team is All-

American Chris Aguilera, arguably
the country's best collegiate goalie
last season. Stanford also loses four of
its top seven scorers in David Hay, Je
remiah Robison, Arturo Rodclo and
Ail-American Layne Beaubien.
However. Dettamanti thinks that
this team "has as good a chance as last
year's team." He adds that the 1999
Cardinal team enjoys "probably the
best depth in years." He expects that
everyone on the team will be playing,
with "probably a minimum of 12 guys
[getting time| in each game."
Stanford is led by redshirt senior
Brian Heifferon, the 1998 MPSF
Tournament Most Valuable Player,
the Cardinal's second-leading scorer
last season with 43 goals and the
team's best all-around player accord
ing to the coaching staff. I leifferon is
a two-time first team Ail-American
and was a standout member of the
United States Junior National team
and the U.S. World University
Games squad that traveled to Spain
this summer.
Joining I leifferon at starting posi
tions in the field will be fellow seniors
Andy Walburger, Jonathan Skaalen,
Sean Joy and Mike Lipinski. Wal
burger will be counted on to pump up
the scoring this year as will Skaalen,
who is expected to be Stanford's top
two-point shooter. Joy will also be a
scoring threat, having put in 18 goals
last season. Lipinski will play in the
hole and is considered to be one of
the nation's best two-meter men.
Replacing Aguilera in the goal will
be redshirt freshman Nick Ellis, the
nation's top goalie out of high school
in 1998 and a member of the U.S. Ju
nior National Team. Redshirt sopho

more Arik Goodman, the top goalie
out of high school in 1997, will serve
as a backup.
The sixth field starter will be fairly
flexible and will depend on the
strengths and weaknesses of the C ar
dinal's opponents. Returning to the
team and ready to fill this role are ju
nior Peter Osborne, redshirt sopho
mores Pasi Dutton, Todd Snider.

Mark Amott, Kendall Benson,
sophomore Onno Koelman and red
shirt freshmen Nathan Alldredge and
Brian Darrow.
New to the Stanford squad are
three freshmen: Jason Robinson, Jeff
Nesmith and Peter Hudnut.
"Quality-wise these are the best
three freshmen at their positions in
the country," Dettamanti said.

Robinson, the top-ranked goalie
out of high school, led Long Beach
Wilson High School to four CIF
Southern Section Championships.
He will redshirt this season.
Nesmith, who also played at Long
Beach Wilson, will see playing time
for the Cardinal this year. The
squad's only lefthander, he should be
a potent scoring threat in 6-on-5 situ

ations.
Hudnut, a hole man from Har
vard-Westlake High School in Los
Angeles, will join Lipinski and Amott
at the two-meter position, giving the
Cardinal a trio of powerful hole men.
Where will this squad take Stan
ford in 1999?
"We're shooting for an NCAA
Championship," Dettamanti says.
