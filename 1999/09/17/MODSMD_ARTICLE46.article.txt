# Lewis, Chris
## 
### 
The first thing one notices about quarter
hack Chris Lewis is his wide, friendly grin and
laid-back, agreeable attitude.
Perhaps this is the product of the beach
mentality in his native Long Beach, Calif., but
whatever the cause, the six-foot, three-inch
freshman definitely has a twinkle in his eye.

His personality seems to rub off on his
teammates, who good-naturedly tease him as
they walk by. and even his more reserved fel
low freshman Kerry Carter, whom he draws a
smile from with his humorous nature.
One of the top reeruits in the nation a year
ago, Lewis was considered the third-best quar
terback prospect in the country and was a con
sensus prep All-American at his position.
As a high sclkh)l player at Long Beach
Poly, he was named 1998 Gatorade National
Football Player of the Year and to the Parade
All-America first team.
He also set a California state career record
with 107 touchdown passes. These achieve
ments got him noticed by coaches at Califor
nia, Notre Dame and Tennessee, among oth
ers. who recruited him along with Stanford.
However. Stanford impressed Lewis so
much that he ended up committing while on
his recruiting trip here.
Some of the factors that prompted his deci
sion included his relationship with coach Ty
rone Willingham, whom he received a positive
message from and now aspires to emulate, and

the superior education he could receive.
Lewis also felt well received by team
mates, which was contrary to his experience at
other colleges. It also didn't hurt that his older
sister, Robyn, is a member of Stanford's
women's volleyball team and that his parents
were "always in my ear talking about Stan
ford."
This year, Lewis will be fighting Joe Bor
chard and Randy Fasani for the backup quar
terback role behind Todd Husak, and while
he may not see much action on the field, he
seems to enjoy being a part of the Cardinal
football program and Stanford as a whole.
He describes his impression of the univer
sity so far with words such as "so fun," and
"beautiful," and comments that it is "a great
environment to play football."
As a freshman, Lewis will be living in Don
ner, an all-freshman dormitory, and trying to
adjust to the academic rigors of Stanford.
Undecided about what major to pursue, he
is looking into the field of economics and busi
ness but is mainly "just trying to get by" first
quarter. â€” Emily Cadei
