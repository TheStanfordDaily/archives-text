# Soccer finds strength in numbers
## Talented squad looks to improve on runner-up finish 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Most teams would consider los
ing seven seniors enough to force
them into a "rebuilding" year.
But the No. 19 Stanford men's
soccer team (2-1-1), with head
coach Bobby Clark at the helm,
consider this season nothing of the
sort.
"All great sides have been able
to have great seasons and then fol

low that up with another very solid
season," Clark said.
Before the 1998 season, Stan
ford had never made it past the first
round of the playoffs, hut last year
the Cardinal thrust itself into the
national picture with an NCAA
title run whieh culminated in a na
tional second-place finish. Since
then, however, the composition of
the team has changed drastically.
"Even though you lose seniors
to graduation, the test is for the

next generation to fill their shoes
and fill them well. It is going to be
different, but this is the intriguing
thing of college soccer," Clark said.
With their departure, last year's
seniors took with them 82 of Stan
ford's 127 points, two All-Ameri
cans and two members of the
NCAA Final Four All-Tourna
ment team. In addition, the 1998
squad was a very experienced
group.
Stepping in to fill their shoes are

returning players who have not
seen much playing time as well as
one of the nation's top recruiting
classes.
"We did lose some very good
players from last year, hut we
gained some too. On top of that we
have very solid role players that we
are expecting to step up and have
strong influence over this year's
success. But again our strength this
year will he the team," senior co
captain T.K. Inbody said.
Anchoring the team are six re
turning starters, led by co-captain
midfielders Inbody and senior Ger
ard Davis. These players are joined
by senior defender Andy Hem
merich, junior forward Corey
Wool folk, junior goalkeeper Adam
Zapala and sophomore defender
Lee Morrison.
Both Morrison and Zapala were
named pre-season Ail-Americans,
Morrison to the first team and Za
pala to the second. Morrison was
also selected an NCAA Final Four
All-Tournament member with his
biggest goal of the season coming in
the national semifinal 1-0 victory
against Maryland. Zapala currently
holds the Stanford records in ca
reer shutouts (27) and goals
against average (0.57).
Already playing a key role for
the Cardinal is transfer Ryan
Nelsen. The junior defender from
New Zealand transferred from
Greensboro College in North Car
olina and is starting as one of Stan
ford's central defenders. Freshmen

gained valuable game experience.
"All [freshman] have been in at
crucial times, giving them confi
dence. We need the depth they
provide," Clark said.
The 1999 squad already has one
title under its belt, winning the
Nike Goal Rush Tournament last
weekend in Fresno. The tourna
ment was bittersweet, however, as
the Cardinal dropped its first game
3-1 to No. 18 Gonzaga before pick
ing up a 4-0 win against Oakland.
The tournament title was decided
on goal differential.
The Cardinal came out flat
against Gonzaga, allowing two
early goals. Stanford put itself back
in the game with a goal by junior

Brandon Garinger in the 79th
minute, but conceded a penalty
kick shortly after, losing 3-1.
The team viewed the loss as in
centive to come out harder in the
next game, in which the Cardinal
convincingly beat Oakland 4-0.
"We showed that we learned a
lesson by our victory over Oak
land." Inbody said. "Everyone was
focused and ready for the game."
Junior forward Luke Rust
scored the game's first goal just
five minutes into the first half, and
it proved to be enough as the de
fense held Oakland scoreless.
Garinger provided two insur
ance goals, and Rust added his sec
ond of the day. Two of the assists
came from Woolfolk, and
Levesque provided a third. Rust
and Garinger lead the team with
seven points each.
