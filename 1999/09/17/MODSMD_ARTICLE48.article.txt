They have yet to attend an I-Hum lecture, stack their trays with din
ing hall cuisine or participate in their first Branner party.
However, the highly touted freshman class of Kelsey Carlson,
katnerinc Harrington, Allyson Marquand, Becky Myers, Marcia Wal
lis and Gallic Withers have already demonstrated that they will be an
invaluable addition to one of the most promising Stanford women's

soccer teams in recent history.
On a team that returns 16 players, all six have already logged their
first collegiate minutes. Carlson, Marquand and Wallis have started
every game thus far and Withers, Myers and Wallis have combined to
score tour of the team's 11 goals this season, with Withers scoring two.
Steve Swanson, head coach of the No. 11 Cardinal (3-1), said that the
freshman have "contributed a tremendous amount to the team's over
all speed and athleticism. In addition, they are very creative offensive
ly-
"The girls have adapted extremely well to the athletic realm of col
legiate soccer."
The smooth transition is in large part a result of the "returning team
members doing a great job of integrating the freshman," Swanson said.
The girls agree.
"The older players have gone out of their way to make us feel com
fortable," Withers says. "Whether it be offering advice or simply letting
us borrow their cars."
While the freshmen have been getting acclimated to college, soccer
and campus since their arrival on Aug 10, they arc anxious for the be
ginning of school when their minds will no longer be dominated solely
by soccer.
Myers, an Illinois native, jokes that "the weather isn't bad either."
As the case with every talented freshman that enters Stanford,
thoughts of new roommates, new classmates, and new professors have
the girls naturally both excited and nervous. — Matthew Pohlson
