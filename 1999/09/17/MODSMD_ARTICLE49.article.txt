# Talented frosh make early season impact

Stanford has always boasted a
strong tradition in women's soccer.
But the outlook for this year's team
predicts more than just a winning
record.
The combination of eight re
turning starters and arguably the
best recruiting class in the nation is
good news for Stanford. The ques
tion. it seems, is not if the team will
win. hut just how much.
So far the Cardinal has posted a
4-1 record in earlv-season play, the
only loss coming at the hands of No.
1 Santa Clara.
"The big difference this year is
that we have a greater pool of
depth, and we definitely benefit
from that." head coach Steve Swan
son said. With three freshman
starters. Allyson Marquand. Kelsey
Carlson and Marcia Wallis, the
team is deep in talent. The Cardinal
roster boasts five freshmen Parade
All-Americans.
"We have done a remarkable
job of blending [the freshmen) in,"
Swanson said. We have a lot of cre
ative players with the ability to at
tack. dribble and head very well
and, because of them, we are a little
more dynamic offensively."
Along with a licet of new talent,
the general shape of the team posi
tions has also changed this year. In
stead of two forwards, the team
now plays with three forwards, two
of whom stay very wide and play as

"wingers.
"We are still getting used to a
new lineup and new players, but
our goals this season are a [Pacific
10 Conference] championship, a
home bid in the NCAA tourna
ment, and. ultimately, a national
championship," senior co-captain
Shauna Itri said.
The Pac-10 will be particularly
tough this season with some sur
prising upsets that reveal an unusu
ally high caliber of teams.
"The Pac-10 will be a real tough
test," sophomore Amy Sauer said.
"Just last week, USC beat [perenni
al national powerhouse] North
Carolina. We won't have any easy
games this year."
Swanson added, "We have a
very competitive conference. It was
like that last year, but this year is
tougher. Every team has gotten
better, from the bottom up. There
will be no gimmes in our confer
ence. It makes it that much more
exciting and that much more com
petitive."
Despite a tough conference, the
Cardinal seems up to the challenge.
"This season we have to get up
for every game. We have all the po
tential — it is just a matter of doing
it every game," sophomore Martha
West said.
The team has so far been able to
turn its potential into victories. The
season opened with a splash last

weekend in Hawaii, where Stanford
defeated the University of Hawaii 3-
1 and San Francisco 5-1. These victo
ries come at just the right time, as the
Cardinal prepare to face No. 3 Ne
braska and Seton Hall in the Stan
ford Nike Invitational this weekend.
"This weekend [in Hawaii)
showed us that not only can we win,
but that we can win big," senior co
captain Jenn O'Sullivan said. "We
are excited to face Nebraska and put
what we took away from this week
end into another winning effort."
The two victories did not come
easy, with the Cardinal having to ad
just to adverse field conditions and
the style of Hawaii's play. It was not
until 15 minutes into the second half
when sophomore Martha West set
tled a goal into the back of the net
unassisted that the Cardinal had
something to show for its hard work
and dominance on the field.
"This is the best we've adjusted to
a field and a team," Swanson said.
"We had a great individual effort by
Martha that allowed us to regain our

composure.
And regain their composure they
did. The resulting attack yielded two
more Cardinal goals. Freshman Cal
lie Withers followed up West's goal
with two of her own. one off senior
Ronnie Fair's free kick cross and the
other unassisted.
Later that same week, the Cardi
nal surfed by the USF Lady Dons to
secure an easy 5-1 victory and to win
the Hawaii Invitational.
The scoring reflected the strength
of the team as a unit this season. "The
level of the entire team has been
raised. We expect more from each
player, and there is so much depth on
the team that practices have become
a lot more competitive," West said.
Wallis took control of the game
right away when she scored only
seven minutes into the game on an
assist from Itri. Before the day was
done, the Cardinal would have goals
contributed by West, freshman
Becky Myers, and senior Casey
Bernard.
This confidence will prove useful
as the Cardinal host Nebraska at 7:30
p.m. tonight and Seton 1 lall at 1 p.m.
Sunday in the Stanford Nike Invita
tional at New Maloney Field.
