Stanford has always boasted a
strong tradition in women's soccer.
But the outlook for this year's team
predicts more than just a winning
record.
The combination of eight re
turning starters and arguably the
best recruiting class in the nation is
good news for Stanford. The ques
tion. it seems, is not if the team will
win. hut just how much.
So far the Cardinal has posted a
4-1 record in earlv-season play, the
only loss coming at the hands of No.
1 Santa Clara.
"The big difference this year is
that we have a greater pool of
depth, and we definitely benefit
from that." head coach Steve Swan
son said. With three freshman
starters. Allyson Marquand. Kelsey
Carlson and Marcia Wallis, the
team is deep in talent. The Cardinal
roster boasts five freshmen Parade
All-Americans.
"We have done a remarkable
job of blending [the freshmen) in,"
Swanson said. We have a lot of cre
ative players with the ability to at
tack. dribble and head very well
and, because of them, we are a little
more dynamic offensively."
Along with a licet of new talent,
the general shape of the team posi
tions has also changed this year. In
stead of two forwards, the team
now plays with three forwards, two
of whom stay very wide and play as

"wingers.
"We are still getting used to a
new lineup and new players, but
our goals this season are a [Pacific
10 Conference] championship, a
home bid in the NCAA tourna
ment, and. ultimately, a national
championship," senior co-captain
Shauna Itri said.
The Pac-10 will be particularly
tough this season with some sur
prising upsets that reveal an unusu
ally high caliber of teams.
"The Pac-10 will be a real tough
test," sophomore Amy Sauer said.
"Just last week, USC beat [perenni
al national powerhouse] North
Carolina. We won't have any easy
games this year."
Swanson added, "We have a
very competitive conference. It was
like that last year, but this year is
tougher. Every team has gotten
better, from the bottom up. There
will be no gimmes in our confer
ence. It makes it that much more
exciting and that much more com
petitive."
Despite a tough conference, the
Cardinal seems up to the challenge.
"This season we have to get up
for every game. We have all the po
tential — it is just a matter of doing
it every game," sophomore Martha
West said.
The team has so far been able to
turn its potential into victories. The
season opened with a splash last
