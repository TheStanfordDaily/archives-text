## 
### Travis Neal Ben Jones Editorial staff 
Big Game — First played on March 10, 1892, this showdown between cross
bay rivals Stanford and California has been played annually ever since, with a
hiatus during World War 1.
Last season's matchup at Berkeley marked the 101st Big Game and ended
with a Stanford victory and a 51-39-11 series lead. It also left the Cardinal in
possession of the Axe for the fourth straight year.
• Stanford has scored 1585 points to Cal's 1473.
• Stanford owns the longest winning streak in the series, having triumphed six
straight times between 1%1 and 1966.
• Stanford was on the winning end of the most lopsided Big Game in history
— a 41-0 thrashing of the Weenies in 1930.
• Cal has not won three consecutive games since 1958-1960.
• Stanford has not been held scoreless in a Big Game since 1952, while Cal has
been shut out three times during that same span.
•Cal is 3-6-1 since its mascot, Oski, mysteriously disappeared in 1986 and was
returned in 1988.
The Axe — First introduced by Stanford yell leaders in 1899 to rally students
for a weekend baseball series against Cal. After Stanford fans chopped up a
bear in effigy, Cal fans succeeded in stealing the Axe, first displaying it at a fra
ternity house before locking it away in a bank vault near campus. The Axe re
mained in the vault for over 30 years, only to be taken out for Cal's annual
spring rally.
In 1930, Stanford recovered the Axe (see Immortal 21) and after much
feuding between the universities, it was decided that the Stanford symbol
would become the winner's trophy for the annual Big Game.
Six titles — Stanford made history in 1996-97, with a mind-blowing six NCAA
titles. The Cardinal took home top honors in men's and women's cross-coun
try, men's and women's volleyball, and men's and women's tennis. Only four
times before had a school ended a year with five titles, three of those times com
ing from the Farm in 1991-92,1994-95, and 1997-98.
Pacific 10 — Conference of Champions and home of the Cardinal. Along with
Arizona, Arizona State, California, Oregon, Oregon State, UCLA. USC,
Washington and Washington State, the Pac-10 is the only conference to ever
win 10 NCAA team championships in one academic year, a feat it has accom
plished several times.
Plug Ugly — Inaugurated by the Junior class in October, 1898, it started as an
outdoor play which lampooned the seniors and somehow evolved into a phys
ical contest in which the juniors battered the seniors with their traditional
headgear, plus hats hardened with coats of paint. When injuries became ex
cessive, authorities stopped the brawls in 1915.
Immortal 21 —The group of Stanford students who in 1930 stole back the Axe
from the clutches of the California Bears. While two of the 21 posed as re
porters and asked to take a photo of the Axe before it was returned to its vault,
others, disguised as Cal students, crowded next to the Axe for the picture. With
the explosion of flashbulbs and tear gas, the 21 made off with the Axe and re
turned it to the Farm.
The Band—The one, the only, the truly incomparable Lcland Stanford Junior
(pause) I University Marching Band. Notorious for risque field shows, wild par
ties and the velvet hammer, the Band has also been known to play an occa
sional song. The antics of the Band, which include a performance on the steps
of the Los Angeles Criminal Court 1 louse during the O.J. Simpson trial, have
led to bans and ejections from various universities, airlines, networks and
states.
ITie Tree — Stanford's mascot and icon of the Band. Selected every year from
a group of wacky and frighteningly eager students during try-outs, the Tree ac
companies the Band and the Dollies to events and generally wreaks havoc
while spreading love and joy. Freak the Tree, at least once.
"All Right Now" — The closest thing the school has to a light song. Complete
with an organized jump by everyone in the stands, the song is played after every
score in football and after most team victories.
Yell leaders — "Pursue them, pursue them, make them relinquish the ball."
"Kill. Maim, Dismember." Wait till the next football game, you'll get the pic
ture, or at least be able to laugh. And besides, who needs back flips and human
pyramids when you've got this rowdy bunch of guys and girls. Tryouts in the
spring.
Dollies Decked out in cardinal-and-white-colored dresses and white gloves,
these five women stand by their man (see The Tree) and dance up a storm at
all band-attended events. The try-outs are intense, and Dollie Splash is the an
nual spring event where the new members are debuted.
The Play — The most bizarre and most famous highlight clip in college foot
ball history, courtesy of the 1 ( )82 Big Game.

After driving the length of the field in his customary fashion, then-Cardinal
senior quarterback John Elway brought his team from behind to take a one
point lead with four seconds left to play.
Stanford executed an onside kick to run out the clock, but what ensued was
pure chaos. I"he kick was picked up by the Bears' Kevin Boen. Five laterals and
57 yards later, Boen had the ball again and wove his way through the Stanford
Band — which stormed the field, thinking the game was over. The Play ended
with Boen hammering Cardinal trombonist GaryTyrell as he scored the game
winning touchdown.
The Bearial — Each year to kick off Big Game week, the most intense, fren
zied week on the Stanford campus, the band stages a mock burial of Oski, C'al's
lovable golden bear, in White Plaza. The band, dressed appropriately in
somber attire marches to ITie Claw playing a funeral song and as the music
erescendos, a teddy bear, stuffed with fresh spaghetti, is impaled atop The
Claw by the drum major. The hapless bear remains there the duration of the
week until after Big Game. Freshman, be ready to yell till you're hoarse.
The "Axe Yell" — The cheer that will consume any true Stanford football fan
in the days proceeding the Big Game, it goes a little something like this:
GIVE 'em the axe, the axe, the axe,
GIVE 'em the axe, the axe, the axe,
GIVE 'em the axe, GIVE 'em the axe,
GIVE 'em the axe,
WHERE?
RIGHT in the neck, the neck, the neck.
RIGHT in the neck, the neck, the neck,
RIGHT in the neck, RIGIIT in the neck,
RIGHT in the neck,
THERE!
Big Game Bonfire — A great tradition started in 1953 by the women living in
Roble, the Bonfire was held at Lake Lagunita every year in the week before
Big Game. The Bonfire was famous for its flames that seemingly licked the sky,
but due to concern over endangered Tiger Salamanders, the Bonfire was
stopped in 1993.
Cal — University of California at Berkeley and Stanford's arch-rival for over
KX) years. The Bears are in the Pacific 10 Conference along with the Cardinal
and are affectionately known as the "Weenies." Famous for tearing up their
own field and stealing goal posts after losing many a Big Game.
Sears Cup —The annual trophy awarded to the best overall college athletics
program in the nation, based on overall finishes in NCAA sports. After North
Carolina took the inaugural trophy, the Cardinal has brought home the last
five trophies.

Rose Bowl — The desired goal of every Stanford football team. The Cardinal
participated in the first Rose Howl in 1902 , a 49-0 loss to Michigan. The Car
dinal has made 11 appearances in Pasadena for New Year's Day, the most re
cent being in 1972.
National tit les—Stanford has them, lots of them. Since 1980, Stanford has won
59 NCAA team championshipsand 227 individual NCAA titles, the most in
the nation by a very large margin. In 1991-92 Stanford took home 21 individ
ual championships, an NCAA record.
Sixth Man Club — Stanford basketball's notorious student section. It has
earned fame throughout the past few years for its unrelenting verbal attacks on
opponents. Season tickets go fast, and the Sixth Man shirts go even faster. Last
year people camped out starting a week and a half before tickets went on sale,
with players coming by for a visit and tents providing shelter.
Jamie Z(aninovich) —The man who ruled the 6th Man Club universe. A cross
between Jason Priestly and Alex P. Keaton. Departed for the Graduate Schcxil
of Business this year.
Vow Boys — In 1932, the Stanford football team was humiliated by USC, and
players, later known as the "Vow Boys," vowed to never lose to the Trojans
again. They kept their promise, defeating the Trojans in three consecutive sea
sons. including a 1933 victory that saw the team arrive sleepless and only one
hour before the game due to train delays. Two members of the "Vow Boys,"
David Packard and William Hewlett, went on to found a little start-up called
I lewlett-Packard.

The Wow Boys — In emulation of the Vow Boys of the 1930'5, this team has
colorful new uniforms and goes undefeated in the 1940-41 season, taking the
Rose Bowl to everyone's surprise.
Final Four — One of the ultimate goals for college basketball programs across
the nation, the Final Four is the last two rounds of the NCAA Basketball Tour
nament.
Two years ago, Stanford's men's team stormed through the first four play
off rounds to make its first ever Final Four appearance. Last year was a bit of a

disappointment as the men bowed out in the second round, but a host of new
recruits brings hope to the program.
The women's team, on the other hand, has already attended the 112 inal Four
four times in the 90s and has a good chance of making it in the coming season.
Miracle Minute — During the 1998 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament in
the Midwest Regional Finals, Stanford did the unthinkable. Trailing Rhode Is
land by six points with 59 seconds remaining in the game, junior point guard
Arthur Lee stepped up. Lxc scored eight points, dished off two assists and
made the pivotal steal to give the Cardinal its first-ever Final Four appearance
and make the minute one of the most memorable in NCAA history.
The Summer Olympics — Stanford shows up big at this one too, claiming 19
medals (10 gold, four silver, five bronze) at the 1996 games in Atlanta. IfStan
ford were a country, it would be 13th in the world. Furthermore. 49 of Stan
ford's current students or alums participated in the Games.
Bobsled — Yes, Virginia, that's Bobsled here in sunny northern California. Se
nior Mark Ganek, a thrower for the Stanford track and field team, is taking a
break from life on the Farm in an attempt to qualify for the U.S. Bobsled Team
for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Ganek participated in a preliminary skills test
last spring here at Stanford and scored higher than some current members of
the national team having never set one toe inside a bobsled — or a skintight
spandex suit for that matter. After training with the team all summer in Lake
Placid. New York, Ganek has decided to take some time off lrom Stanford in
an attempt to make one of the sleds that will make it to the Olympics.
Fountain Hopping — More of a passtime than a sport, these raucous romps
across campus involve diving in every fountain available. Bonus points for get

ting your whole freshman dorm in the fountain in the center of Old Union
courtyard. Triple bonus points if it's Branner.

inner-tube water polo. The GSB wins every title in every sport. Learn to fear

in the nation, the deCluerrc (pronounced de-GAIR) has three separate pools,
one for competition, one for diving and another for water polo, training and

tigious international sporting events including the semifinal of the Women's
World Cup, played at Stanford Stadium this Summer, the Bank of the West
Tennis Classic and the Federation Cup.

for recreation and by the successful men's and women'sclub teams. Hybrid be
tween soccer, lacrosse and backyard frisbee.
