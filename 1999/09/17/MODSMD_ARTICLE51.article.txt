# Stanford cross country season off and running
## Women welcome dynamite recruits 
### Travis Neal Editorial staff 
At the beginning of the 90s, Stanford women's track
was not much more than a blip on the NCAA cross coun
try world. Although the program had produced
Olympians PattiSue Plumer and Regina Jacobs, it had not
done much as a team.
With the help of coach Vin Lananna, who arrived on
the Farm in 1992, the women's program has become a
dominant force in the running world, striking fear in
hearts of opponents.
The list ot accomplishments is impressive, a seventh
place finish at the 1994 NCAA championships followed
by the title in 1996, a second-place trophy in 1997 and a
third-place in 1998.
This year looks to be no different as Stanford ranks
second in preseason polls behind another perennial fa
vorite, Brigham Young. These two teams have been in the
top three the last three years at the NCAA champiohsips.
Arkansas takes the third spot, while Villanova, which
took the title last year, and Colorado are a close fourth
and fifth, respectively.
Stanford's high ranking can be attributed to the fact
that it lost only one of its top-10 runners to graduation.
Ail-American standout Mary Cobb. The top two Stan
ford runners, Sally Glynn and Julia Stamps, both return in
perfect health, with Glynn leading the team as captain.
"1 hope every meet to compete with the goal of being
excellent," Lananna said, "While the NCAA champi
onship is our main goal, we also want to be great athletes,
improving each week."
Even if there had been a loss of key players, the Cardi
nal's recruiting class stands as the best in the nation.
Lananna believes any and all of the freshmen can make an
immediate impact, with the best hope coming from Erin
Sullivan, a two-time Footlocker Cross Country champion.
Other freshmen include Mariel Ettinger, Lauren
Fleshman, Lindsay Hyatt and Katie Hotchkiss, all of
whom have won numerous state titles and some with
record-breaking times.
While the freshman will help in Stanford's title run, it
will take solid races from the team's more experienced
runners to bring the trophy back to the Farm.
Among the more experienced runners is sophomore
Caroline Annis, the fourth Stanford runner to cross the
finish line at the 1998 NCAA championship. She contin
ued to improve throughout the '99 track season, taking
fifth in the 10,(XX) meters at the Pacific 10 Conference
championship.
Rounding out the sophomore contingent are Colleen
Flaherty and Laura Turner, both having already been an
integral part of the team. Flaherty closed her freshman
year by taking third in the 3,(XX) meters at the Pac-10
championships, and she was also awarded the Margaret
Storey-Garnett Young award, given to the Cardinal's
most imrpoved runner.
Turner has already made significant strides this year,
taking second at the Nevada Wolfpack Cross Country In
vitational with a time of 18:47. Annis finsihed fourth in the
same race, clocking in at 18:56.
That same race, which Stanford won by a margin of 22

points, saw the junior class make its prescence felt as well.
Elena Villarreal. Anne Gunnison and Ann Ramsey
placed seventh, cigth and 11th, respectively. Ramsey and
Villarreal were both returning from injuries that had
forced them to redshirt the 1998 cross country season.
Ramsey had made a significant impact her freshman
year, helping the Cardinal place second at NCAAs, and
representing America at the I.A.A.F. Junior Cross coun
try championships.
Stamps, also a junior, will fight with Glvnn for the top
spot on the team, having been either one or two since the
day she stepped tin the Farm. The 1998 season saw her
place no worse than sixth in all of her races, finishing sec
ond at both the Pac-10 and NCAA Region VIII champi
onships. Her experience and talent will be an integral part
in the team's run at the title, as will the talents of Glynn.
A senior who has won All-America honors in both
cross country and track. Glynn will be the oil that keeps
the machine going. Her fifth-place finish at NCAAs last
year was the best on the team, and she kept the momen
tum into the track season, finishing fifth in the 3,0(X) at
NCAAs.
"Sally has already begin solidifying the team, putting
them on a steady course," Lananna said.
The senior class is also helped out by the likes of Mary
Huang, the dark horse of the'9B season. Her finish as one
of Stanford's top five at NCAAs was a surprise to many,
and she has kept up the strong showing this year, finishing
sixth at the Nevada meet.
Shaluinn Fullove and Courtney Adams complete the
list of seniors, with Adams owning junior status due to a
redshirt in her freshman year. Both have helped the team
achieve greatness, Adams having placed 16th at Pac-lOs
last year.
