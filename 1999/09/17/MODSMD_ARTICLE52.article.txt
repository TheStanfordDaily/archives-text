# Men continue impressive form

Emerging from a powerhouse
past, the 1999 Stanford men's cross
country team looks toward the fu
ture this season with the challenge
and opportunity of strong returning
members joined by a large crop of
youthful and talented freshmen.
Head coach Vin Lananna has
guided the men to Pacific 10 Con
ference championships the past
three years, NCAA championships
in 1996 and 1997, and a second
place NCAA finish last year. The
past glory of the team has estab
lished a strong reputation for the
Stanford program, and this year
the team looks to build up the
young squad to be an NCAA con
tender.
"One of the greatest strengths of
the team this year is they are com
ing in with a refreshing approach to
the season. They have a tremen
dous challenge ahead of them be
cause the team has had such a great
past four years." Lananna said.
The top returning runner for the
Cardinal is junior Jonathon Riley,
coming off an impressive 1998 cross
country season that culminated in a
ninth-place finish at the NCAA
championships and a 1999 indoor
track season where he earned All-
America honors in the 3,(XX) me
ters.
Captain of the men's team this
year is senior Jake Maas, who
brings valuable experience. Also
returning are junior Jamey Gifford,
senior Thomas Murley and junior
Gabe Jennings, who all promise to
be leaders this season and all have
previously competed at the Pac-10
championships.
Coach Lananna stressed that the
lineup of top five runners this sea
son has been left open and that,
with so much talent, it is hard to call
who will step up.
" The team has a journey that is
very exciting and we are all poised
for a challenge. The uncertainty we
have going in is one of our
strengths. We need to improve step
by step, day by day, meet by meet to
bring the team to our goal of being
a strong contender in the NCAA
championships," Lananna said.
As well as the returning mem
bers, the team brought in a top re
cruiting class of 13 freshmen from
all over the country.
"We are working with an out

standing freshman class," Lananna
said. "We graduated lots of talent
ed guys, and it is too early to tell our
chances this season with the new
group because there is not a lot of
experience in the NCAAs.
"The freshmen have been work
ing with the team to become a
strong unit. The freshmen on the
team fit in quite well; they are a re
markable group. They have be
come big players on the team al
ready," Lananna said.
Four of the incoming freshmen
competed in the 1998 Footlocker
Cross Country championships, in
cluding Louis Luchini, Adam Ten
forde, and Andy Powell. They
placed second, third, and twelfth
respectively.
The team also comes off of an a
summer of strong international
competition. Sophomores Daniel
Parris, Jonathon Stevens and Jesse
Thomas, as well as Powell, all corn

peted in the Junior Pan-Am games.
Parris came home second in the
S,(XX) meters, Stevens came back
with a gold medal in the 8(X) meters
and Thomas also came home with
the gold in the 1(),(XX) meters. Pow
ell claimed the gold medal in the
1,5(X) meters.
The season began impressively
with a first-place finish in the men's
first meet on Sept. 4 at the Nevada
Wolfpack Invitational in Reno,
Nev.
Murley led the team, setting a
course record in 20:51 for the four
mile course, followed by a sweep of
the next five places by his Stanford
teammates. The second-place
team, rival California, was easily
defeated by 34 points.
Stanford will host the 26th Stan
ford Invitational Cross Country
Meet at Stanford Golf Course on
Oct 2, bringing in over 3,(XX) com
petitors.
