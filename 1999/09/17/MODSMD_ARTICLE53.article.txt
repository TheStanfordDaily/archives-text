# Field Hockey poised for success in '99
## 
### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
Although classes at Stanford have
yet to begin, the defending Northern
Pacific Conference champion
women's field hockey team (3-4, 2-0
NorPac) is already well into its sea
son.
With the loss of six starting se
niors, among them four NorPac All-
Conference players, two regional
All-Amerieans and one national All-
American, the team may appear to be
in a rebuilding year.
However, six newcomers have
begun to fill the shoes of last year's
graduates, and three freshmen,
Amanda Billmeyer. Dalinda Baneu

los and Christina Williams, have al
ready made their mark by scoring in
this year's first regular-season games.
Coach Sheryl Johnson has guided
the team for the past 15 years and was
named the NorPac Coach of the Year
award for the past four years. In her
tenure on the Farm, Johnson has led
the Cardinal to eight NorPac champi
onships and six appearances in the
NCAA tournament. She is intent on
using each game to build on the
team's experience, especially for the
freshmen.
"All six freshmen have gotten sig
nificant playing time. All are adjust
ing well to the pace of the college
game," Johnson said. She attributes
the talent of the freshmen to the fact

that today's high schix>l players are
able to play in more year-round tour
naments, "which gives them more
playing experience before they enter
college."
Leading the team this year are se
nior co-captains and fellow midfield
ers Mallory Chambers and Sarah
Medeiros, who returns for a fifth year
after redshirting in 1997 because of a
knee injury. Senior I Jndsey Dunagan
leads the forward line and senior Julie
Gwozdz starts as defender for the
fourth year in a row.
Dunagan. playing in her home
town, posted four goals during the
roadtrip to St. Louis — one in every
game — to become the high scorer on
the team so far this season. Second on

the team for scoring is Banuelos with
three goals and one assist so far this
season.
The junior class is a small hut
strong one, with Michelle Scott get
ting things going as center midfielder
with amazing speed and hail handling
skills. She sits as the only junior on the
field now, after an eye injury took fel
low junior Melita Sawyer to the hos
pital the day before the Cardinal's
first game of the season. Sawyer is
now recovering away from the Farm,
and her controlled and commanding
aggressiveness on the halfback line is
sorely missed, as well as her determi
nation and inspiration off the field.
