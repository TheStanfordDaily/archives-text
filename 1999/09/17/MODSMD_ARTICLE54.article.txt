# Women's XCountry

Over the past two seasons, third-place fin
ishes at nationals for the women's cross country team have
added hardware to the cabinet in the team's Arrillaga suite
But there's no denying that a gold-plated trophy this season
would be preferred.
To bring back the title the women won in 1996, head
coach Vin Lananna has brought in a recruiting class that on
its own could be a nationally-ranked team. Topped by two
time Footlocker National Cross Country champion Erin
Sullivan of Jericho, Vt., Stanford's 2003 freshmen class is
one of the best ever assembled.
While any other school would be more than satisfied
with a catch such as Sullivan, the fastest two-miler in the
country last year, Stanford also reeled in Mariel Ettinger
(LaGrande, Ore.), who was Sullivan's runner up at Foot
locker's in 1997, and Lauren Fleshman (Canyon Country,
Calif.), runner-up at last year's meet.
Living up to his reputation as a distance guru, Lananna
didn't stop there, also grabbing local talent Kathleen Briz
gys. The Palo Alto resident not only boasts a wealth of ex
perience on Stanford's home course, but also a Central
Coast Section cross country title and a 4:52 mile.
Add in middle distance standouts Katie Hotchkiss of
Fremont, girl's mile champion at the Millrose games this
year, along with Lindsay Hyatt of Auburn, a three-time na
tional champion in the 800 meters, and the Cardinal inches
closer to that gold trophy.
"It appears that we have a pretty good balance of ath
letes in the women's distance events, but we didn't want to
wait until our current athletes graduated before rebuild
ing," said Lananna. "What we decided to do was to get a
jump on it. We definitely put a lot of emphasis on the
women's distance this fall." â€” Barry Cooper
