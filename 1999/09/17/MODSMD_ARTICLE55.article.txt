### 
Kerry Carter's imposing six-foot two-inch,
225 pound frame belies a soft-spoken, almost
shy demeanor that contradicts one's expecta
tions of the freshman running back.
Carter, a native of Toronto. Canada, joins
the Stanford football team this year after a

stellar high school career at Father Henry Carr
High School, bringing with him high expecta
tions for the Cardinal running game as well as
the future of the football program.
As a much heralded prep, Carter was a
consensus All-American and ranked number
22 out of a list of top fifty recruits by Super Prep
in 1998. An outstanding athlete, he also played
basketball, volleyball and ran track in high
school, but chose to focus on football, because,
as he explained, "it's what came easiest to
me."
Although he played only one game his se
nior year due to a teachers' strike in Ontario
that forced the cancellation of most of the
football season, he caught the eye of recruiters
while playing for a summer league for 19 and
under athletes in Canada.
Carter considered Stanford's overall rep
utation for being an excellent academic in
stitution an important factor in his decision,
noting that some of the other schools did not
place as large an emphasis on education.
As a potential pre-med student. Carter
wanted to keep his options open for the fu

turc, which was not as viable at other uni
versities, where the football programs were
more one-track toward producing NFL
players rather than scholars.
Of comparable significance was his es
teem for Coach Willingham, whom he
deemed, "a role model for all of us," and
someone who "does things with such a pur
pose you can't help but admire him."
Although only here for a few months,
Carter claims to already love being at Stan
ford, citing the great weather and team rap
port. especially with the older players who
"really embraced the freshman."
He looks forward to moving into his
freshman residence, Branner, and begin
ning classes including that old frosh favorite,
1-hum, his particular class being "Great
Works".
Although the 1999 season is barely under
way. Carter's play in the first two games has
already merited all the hype that has pre
ceded him and he has demonstrated the po
tential for many great feats in the future.
