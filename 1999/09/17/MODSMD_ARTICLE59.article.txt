## 'Jewels for Sophia' Robyn Hitchcock 
### 
"Jewels for Sophia" is Robyn
Hitchcock's 13th studio album in
the 18 years since the Soft Boys,
one of the most under-appreciated
bands of its time, decided to break
up.
The album moves away from the
largely acoustic sound of 1996's
"Moss Elixir" and last year's
Jonathan Demme documentary
"Storefront Hitchcock." Former
Soft Boy Kimberley Rew con
tributes some high-energy guitar
work to "Nasa Clapping" and
"Sally Was A Legend," while fan
Pete Buck took time away from
REM to add some Roger
McGuinn-style 12-string guitar to a
couple of numbers.
The frequently used rhythm sec
tion lends considerable energy to
the songs, though perhaps at the
sacrifice of some emotional intima
cy. Regardless of the backing, the
heart of Hitchcock's style is the
simple and catchy songs highlight
ing his limited but expressive voice

and utterly unique wordplay. Who
else could write, "Oh Lord I just
amalgamated saturated clams / Dig
Rex in tunnels with gerbils in your
annex?"
The themes are ones Hitchcock
has returned to throughout his ex
tended career: death, the nature of
love and isolation, condemnation
of selfishness and greed and the
elusiveness of happiness. As usual,
Hitchcock makes use of surreal
metaphors and evocative nonsense
images.
"I Feel Beautiful," "Mexican
God," "Dark Princess" and "Jew
els for Sophia," are slow, moody
and carefully constructed songs. In
contrast, "NASA Clapping" is a
rare guitar-driven rocker that is
noisy and raw.
Some duds exist as well. Singing
about the espresso bars and heroin
of Seattle in "Viva! Sea-Tac" is a bit
too earthbound for Hitchcock's
style. "Elizabeth Jade" finds him
attempting a Pretty Things-styled

freakbeat approach. The track is a
commendable idea — too bad he
couldn't pull it off.
With "Cheese Alarm," his silli
ness just gets out of hand: "Roque
fort and Gruyere and slippery Brie
/ All of these cheeses they happen
to me / Oh please" ... oh please in
deed.
Long a cult figure, Hitchcock
certainly plays to his established
strengths and his loyal fan base with
"Jewels for Sophia." The album in
cludes a "hidden" live track "Don't
Talk to Me About Gene Hack
man," reminiscent of his earlier
joke songs such as "I've Got a Mes
sage For You."
While he may never match the
groundbreaking intensity of the
Soft Boys or even the tuneful luna
cy of his early solo efforts, Robyn
Hitchcock shows no signs of run
ning out of energy, though he may
be recycling ideas.
