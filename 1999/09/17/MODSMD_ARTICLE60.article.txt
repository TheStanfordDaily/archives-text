# 'Women of Country'
## Various Artists 
### 
-1998 was dubbed by a number of
media institutions as the "Year of
Women in Rock" — which only un
derscores the fact that female rockers
are still considered second-class citi
zens. In stark contrast, women vocal
ists have been an integral part of
country music since the ascension of
Patsy Cline.
Lifetime Music recently released a
compilation entitled "Women of
Country" — a collection which at
tempts to chronicle the last 50 years of
female country. While the album con
tains a number of stunning break
throughs. the collection is simply too
small to be considered more than a
tenative introduction.
The disc opens with "Walkin'
After Midnight" sung by Cline, the
colossus who stills bestrides the fe
male country world. The track is a

perfect lesson for her many imitators,
mixing sexual frustration, hillbilly
swing and deadly melody.
Other songs echo the beauty of
this masterpiece. Rosanne Cash's
"Seven Year Ache" delivers a haunt
ing world of loss and regret. Dolly
Parton's "1 Will Always Love You"
shines resolutely — refusing to break
under love's burden. Patty Loveless's
"Hurt Me Bad (In A Real Bad Way)"
triumphs with pure, unforgettable
melody.
Further, the album showcases
country swing. Barbara Mandell's
"Tonight My Baby's Coming Home"
and K. T. Oslin's "Come Next Mon
day" both deliver rhythmic punch.
However, the most impressive up
beat track is Kathy Mattea's irre
sistible rocker, "I'm On Your Side."
The rhythmic kick and vocal sass sug

gest a kinship with country-rock god
dess Maria McKee.
Unfortunately, the album has dif
ficulty holding together as a cohesive
unit. Forty minutes is simply too short
a time to travel from Cline to Mattea.
Further, the compilation is weakened
by the inclusion of a number of joke
tunes. Pam Tillis's "Cleopatra, Queen
of Denial" and Lorrie Morgan's
"What Part Of No" both painfully
drive their cliches into the ground.
Still, female country singers have a
rich history, and "Women in Coun
try" is a commendable effort to fit
their story into a small package. In
deed, the spotty past of women in
rock is enough to make one wonder
which genre is really the progressive
one.
