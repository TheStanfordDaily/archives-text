## No hope in Farrelly's latest film 'Outside Providence' lacks humor and depth 
### 
The Farrelly brothers are not
historians. Despite their comedic
jackpots in "Dumb and Dumber"
and "There's Something About
Mary," the latest film being attrib
uted to their names is also some
thing you'll never see on A&E's
"Biography."

Outside Providence
Shawn Hatosy, Alec Baldwin
103 minutes
Rated R

"Outside Providence" is full of
the same crude sexual jokes that
made hits out of Bobby and Peter
Farrelly's other two films. Howev
er, their latest effort fails to invoke
nostalgia for the 19705, instead con
juring up feelings of strong confu
sion and apathy.
Timothy Dunphy (Shawn
Hatosy, "The Faculty") is a teenag
er who likes to smoke dope, wonder
where all the women are in his

hometown of Pawtucket, R. 1., and
smoke some more dope. The sum
mer before his senior year, he and
his gang of friends drive away with
a girl from a disco club, only to rear
end a police car on their journey
home.
Lucky for him, Dunphy has a fa
ther (Alec Baldwin) whose card
playing friends have "connections,"
and the denim-jacket-wearing-se
nior-with-no-future only lands pro
bation and a year in a Pennsylvania
preparatory school for his indiscre
tions. Dunphy learns that some
prep-school kids like to smoke a
bowl, and most of his time in Penn
sylvania — and the movie — is
spent doing just that.
That is, until he meets Jane We
ston (Amy Smart, "Varsity Blues"),
the prettiest and most innocent girl
in school. She teaches him about
studying and following the rules,
and he teaches her about what it's
like growing up in an "outside Prov
idence" family — one without

money, discipline, a mother or any
kind of motivation to succeed. The
pair hit it off well, and their ram
blings in the local woods that sur
round their school are the most
pleasant scenes of the movie.
The film includes great '70s rock
tracks from The Who, The Eagles
and Lynyrd Skynyrd. But these
tasteful additions don't do much for
the script's lagging efforts at recre
ating the era and providing humor.
For example, Dunphy's father af
fectionately calls his son "Dildo,"
which, although momentarily
funny, is never explained and con
sequently never achieves its full
comedic potential.
There isn't a dog with a body cast
in this movie, but there is a three
legged canine and a handicapped
boy. Dunphy's wheelchair-bound
brother, in fact, is constantly belit
tled and told to "stop horsing
around" when he can't operate his
wheelchair correctly. These jokes
only make the audience look

around the theatre in minor embar
rassment.
"Outside Providence" is neither
as funny as "There's Something
About Mary" nor as serious as

"School Ties." Further, the in-be
tween area that this movie falls into
isn't nearly as entertaining.
