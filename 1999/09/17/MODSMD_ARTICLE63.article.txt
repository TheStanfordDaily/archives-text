# 'Echoes' of the far superior 'Sixth Sense'
## Kevin Bacon tries hard to overcome sloppy material 
### 
From the first moments of "Stir
of Echoes," I knew I would be
watching something similar to "The
Sixth Sense." Writer/director
David Koepp, who was a creative
force behind the blockbusters
"Men in Black" and "Jurassic
Park," doesn't quite build up the
tension in "Stir of Echoes." In
stead, there are a number of ill-fit
ting coincidences and badly-timed
laughs that undermine the sus
pense.
A bizarre hypnosis session with
Lisa (Illeana Douglas) at a party
sets Tom (Kevin Bacon) down a
spiral into hell. He gets odd visions
from a retarded girl who disap
peared a few years ago.
Tom's son, Jake (Zachary David
Cope), also has moments of confus
ing detail spring into his mind, but
he largely doesn't know how to
process this information. Jake is a
far cry from Cole Sear, the morti

fied kid played to near perfection
by Haley Joel Osment in"The Sixth
Sense."
Tom's wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe) starts to become distant from
him. She doesn't understand what
he is going through, and she fears
that he will infect Jake with his per
sistence in satisfying his urges to do
ridiculous things like jackhammer
the house basement and dig trench
es in the backyard. It's a good thing
that Tom is in physical shape to do
all of this back-breaking, blue-col
lar work.
Bacon is perhaps most memo
rable as the psychotic killer in"The
River Wild" and the psychological
ly damaged prisoner in "Murder in
the First." But Bacon's part
comedic, part-analytic, part-psy
chotic performance here, while
good, doesn't gel well with the
movie's overall tone. I think back a
few days to Bruce Willis' blank yet

Stir of Echoes
Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe
110 minutes
Rated R
inquisitive stare in "The Sixth
Sense." Yes, Willis has made a ca
reer out of that look, but it does
neatly capture the role of psycholo
gist he has in that film.
"Stir of Echoes" doesn't really
stir anything out of the individual.
The acting and plot feel shallow
(aside from Bacon's performance),
and it moves to try to find any way
possible to make you go, "Oh yeah,
now I see." I didn't buy these tri
fling conveniences, and neither
would you, the discerning viewer.
I'd suggest that you go see "The
Sixth Sense" again to catch all of its
inventive plot elements. I definitely
plan to.
