# Finding a place to live
## 
### 
Housing is limited and can be
difficult to find, so don't
delay, start looking ASAP.
Rentals in the Tahoe-Truc
kee area range from $450 a
month for a studio in Kings Beach
to $1,500 and up for a 3 - 4 bed
room home close to the ski areas.
A majority of the rentals require a
long-term lease (1 year minimum),
with 2 and 4 bedroom homes start
ing about $700 and $1,500, respec
tively. However, there are a few
short-term ski leases available,
which run from Dec. 1 to April 30,
ranging from $850 to $1,300.

• Typically, the closer you get to
Tahoe City, the more expensive it
gets. The West Shore and Kings
Beach are often more affordable.
While Truckee is comparable, there

is sometimes more to
choose from.
• Rentals that allow
dogs are few and far

between and those that do allow
them often require an extra
deposit.
• Check the classifieds in the
Tahoe World, Sierra Sun and North
Lake Tahoe Bonanza newspapers,
or at www.tahoe.com. But be

fres hies

quick. Rentals are often snapped
up in just one hour after the paper
hits the stands.
• Check the bulletin board at the
laundromats and convenience

stores and put up your
own housing posters.
• Check to see if the
ski area or business

establishment you plan to work for
has a bulletin board with available
rentals.
• Finally, talk to people. Let them
know you're looking for a place to
live. Someone is always looking
for a roommate.
