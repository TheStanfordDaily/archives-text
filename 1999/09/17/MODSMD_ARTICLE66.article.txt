# The 						perks
## 
### 
When
you're
choosing
which

resort to work for, you

need to pick one that
matches your lifestyle.

The type of terrain you want to
ride/ski, how far you want to 'com-

mute' and the

atmosphere you are
comfortable with are
three factors that need

to work in concert with each other.
Donner Summit
The Summit resorts participate in a "pass
exchange" program for employees at Boreal,
Donner Ski Ranch, Royal Gorge, Soda Springs
and Sugar Bowl that allows the employee to
ride each resort for free during the mid-week.
Sugar Bowl offers a full pass in exchange
for 24 hours, or three shifts, of work per
week.
Tahoe Donnar resort asks employees to
maintain a 'regular schedule' which could be
two to five days per week depending on busi
ness. Tahoe Donner also lets employees use
its fitness center and cross country facilities.
Boraal and Soda Springs offer two work
shifts, up to 48 hours / week / shift, to accom
modate day and night skiing. Full-time
employees also ski free at Alpine Meadows

sick chutes

and Park City Utah. Part-time employees ski
free at Boreal and Soda Springs and pay half
price at the other two resorts.
North Lake Tahoe
Northstar-at-Tahoe offers employees who
keep a regular work schedule a season pass.
Plus skiing at its parent company's (Booth
Creek) other resorts — Sierra-at-Tahoe, Bear

Mountain, Grand Targhee in Wyoming,
the four summit resorts near Seattle
and three ski areas in New Hampshire.
Employees' families can vacation on-site

with a 50 percent lodging discount during the
non-peak season.
Alpine Meadows requires a minimum of
three shifts per week for most positions —
shifts vary from 4 to 8 hours.
Alpine's neighbor, Squaw Valley USA,
asks first-year employees to work at least 24
hours per week (varies within the depart

ment) to obtain a
season pass.
Employees can also
ice skate for free
every Wednesday.
