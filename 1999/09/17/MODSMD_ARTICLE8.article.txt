# BEHIND THE SCENES
## 
### 
So you recognize Casper, and perhaps even
Dean Hennessy. You might even know what
jobs they hold, hut do you know what they
actually do?
Most likely, you don't, and you don't know
much about the rest of the people who run the
University, either.
President Casper is the leader of Stanford Uni
versity, but under his guidance, responsibilities

are divided among many administrators, includ
ing the 12 who comprise the University Cabinet.
The 11 individuals who advise the president —
the provost, the academic deans, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center director and the
Hoover Institution director — each guide their
respective University divisions, reporting to the
president and implementing his directives while
also carrying out their own initiatives.

(icrhard Casper
Casper's many achievements
since taking the helm of the uni
versity in IW2 include an over
haul of undergraduate education,
creating new programs such as
Sophomore College and fresh
men seminars.
Before coming to Stanford,
Casper served at the University of
Chicago since 1%6. beginning as
an associate professor of political
science and law. He ultimately
reached the position of dean of
the law school and provost of the
university.
This will be Casper's last year
as president of Stanford.

Kathleen Sullivan
Sullivan, in her first year as
head of the law school, shares of
love of constitutional love with her
predecessor, Paul Brest.
"[Sullivan] is everything one

standing teacher and scholar, an
active lawyer and a public intellec
tual," University President Ger
hard ( aspcr told the Stanford Re
port after her appointment.
In addition to being a constitu
tional law specialist, Sullivan has
written extensively about contro
versies surrounding issues includ
ing abortion, affirmative action
and free speech.

Franklin Orr
Petroleum Engineering Prof.
Franklin "Lynn" Orr was named
dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences in April of IWS. At that
time his greatest challenge was
shepherding the school through
an era of tightening budgets.
Since then, Orr has focused upon
improving degrees in the earth
sciences.

Kruger initially assumed con
trol of his position in the after
math of the widely publicized and
controversial indirect-cost con
troversy and graduate student un
rest.
Since those times Kruger has
settled all accusations of impro
priety in reporting indirect costs
with the federal government,
graduate student issues are being
addressed. Stanford's new land

new housing for graduate stu
dents.
A member of the Stanford fac

chaired the .Faculty Senate.

Malcolm Beasley

and Promotions Committee, and
director of the Center for Materi
als research. Beasley received the
Dean's Award for Distinguished
Teaching in the School of Human
ities and Sciences in 1983 for devis
ing a physics class for non-scien
tists.

John Raisian
The often-rocky relationship
between the Hoover Institution
and Stanford has improved since
Raisain took over as Hoover di
rector in 1988, replacing W.
Glenn Campbell, the intisution's
head for 31 years.
The Hoover-Stanford rela
tionship hit a low point during the
mid-1980s when the faculty suc
cessfully stopped the Regan Pres
idential Library bring located on
campus and supported a move
ment to bring the instituion under
"normal academic governance."
Raisian has worked diligently
to improve relations since then
and seems to have been success
ful.
