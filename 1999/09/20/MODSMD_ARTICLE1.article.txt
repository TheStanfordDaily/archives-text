### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
Director of Overseas Studies Rus
sell Berman is stepping down from
his position in order to take on a new
job — associate dean of undergradu
ate studies in the School of the Hu
manities and Sciences.
In order to focus on the job, he will

step down from
both his post at
Overseas Studies
and his position
•as chair of the
German Studies
Department
when replace
ments are found.

Berman's appointment follows
close on the heels of the appointment
of Materials Science Prof. John Brav
man as vice provost for undergradu
ate education.
This is no coincidence: Bravman's
predecessor, English and Compara
tive Literature Prof. Ramon Saldf
var. held both positions, so the
School of Humanities and Sciences
needed to find someone to fill this
position.
"Russell's vision, energy and com
mitment to excellence will serve the
school well as we strive to make [the
School of Humanities and Sciences]
the place where the newest ideas are
being generated, and the most imag
inative teaching innovation is taking
place," said 1 lumanities and Sciences
Dean Malcolm Bcasley in a letter to
faculty members in the school.

Among Berman's duties will be
an assessment of major programs
and departmental curricula to make
sure they are meeting the needs of ju
niors and seniors.
"Thanks to [University President
Gerhard Casper], Stanford has fo
cused very much on the quality of un
dergraduate education in the first
two years," Berman said, adding that
he would seek to extend that focus to
the upper-class experience within his
school, in which most undergradu
ates choose their majors.
Berman said he would take spe
cial interest in interdisciplinary pro
grams such as Science, Technology
and Society and Human Biology.
"Some of the most exciting teach
ing in the school takes place in inter
disciplinary programs," Berman
said, hut added that he might find
ways to improve faculty support for
such programs.
Other tasks awaiting Berman in
clude attempting to improve large
courses within the school, studying
course enrollments and faculty
teaching loads, and helping with
fundraising for Humanities and Sci
ences initiatives.
Beasley emphasized that many of
these tasks are internal to the School,
hut Berman will also work with Brav
man in the Provost's Office to coor
dinate programs.
Berman will he leaving behind an
Overseas Studies office that has
changed considerably during his


Berman
tenure there.
"It's been a wonderful time,"
Berman said. "Student participation
in the program has increased by
about 10 percent, and we've found
ways to strengthen the academic cal
iber of the programs while extending
possibilities for extracurricular activ
ities. But every program can benefit
from fresh leadership."
During his time at Overseas Stud
ies, Berman inaugurated programs
in Puebla, Mexico and Buenos Aires,
Argentina. He had also hoped to cre
ate a program in Beijing, China, but
the proposal became mired in con
troversy last year.
Ilie Chinese government's arrest
and detention last year of Stanford
scholar Hua Di, a missile expert and
senior research associate at the Cen
ter for International Security and
C(X)peration at Stanford, may have
been a factor in the program's uncer
tain status.
"My colleagues and I worked
hard to develop a proposal for a pro
gram in Beijing, but the timing was
just not right," Berman said.
Iliough Berman will be stepping
down as chair of German Studies, he
said he did not want to neglect his du
ties as a professor.
"1 will continue to teach actively
in the department and work with un
dergraduate and graduate students
as an adviser," he said.
