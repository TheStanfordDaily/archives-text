## Peacekeepers sent to stop violence in East Timor 
### 
DILI, Indonesia (AP) — International
peacekeepers in combat gear landed in East
I imor at dawn Monday, clearing the way for
a U.N.-approved force charged with restor
ing order and helping usher the Indonesian
province toward independence.
A Hercules C-130 transport plane set
down at Dili Airport, the first in a wave of
planes and ships that was due to bring 2.500
soldiers to the tropical half-island by the end
of the day.
The Australian air force planes took off
from their bases before dawn Monday. Aus
tralian Defense Minister John Moore said 16
tlights would ferry troops to East Timor
before the end of the day.
By Monday afternoon, 2,500 soldiers,
helicopters and armored personnel carriers
would be on the ground in Dili, East Timor's
capital, said Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri. com
mander of the Indonesian forces in East
Timor.
Nine warships from Australia, Britain and
New Zealand, were sailing toward East

Timor with troops from more than a half
dozen nations. A small contingent of U.S.
Marines is providing logistical support in
Australia.
The announcement two weeks ago that
78.5 percent of East Timor's voters approved
a break with Indonesia led to a murderous
rampage by pro-Indonesia militias that
drove more than 3(X),(MX) people from their
homes and cost at least several hundred lives.
The foreign intervention is a major humil
iation for Indonesia, whose army had fought
for nearly 25 years to put down separatist
rebels. President B.J. Habibie's decision to
invite the peacekeepers a week ago has led
to a nationalist backlash in Indonesia and has
sent angry protesters into the streets.
Humanitarian aid to hundreds of thou
sands of refugees — some of them facing
starvation — was to be the first priority of
the U.N.-approved peace mission.
Australian Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the
commander of the multinational peacekeep
ing force, toured the provincial capital on

Sunday, passing charred houses and build
ings.
Cosgrove said the force would have 3.2(H)
troops in East Timor within a week. The mis
sion will probably last several months before
making way for a follow-up IJ.N. peacekeep
ing force, he said.
" This is not a time for idle threats or
words," he said after meeting Syahnakri.
" This is a time for the force to arrive, and to
get about its tasks of helping to create a
secure environment. We will be here to
ensure that all East Timorese are able to go
about their business free of threat."
Indonesian soldiers were posted every
2(H) yards along Cosgrove s route as he went
on a 20-minute tour of Dili. Visible effort
had been made to clear away rubble and
other evidence of the rioting, looting and
killing.
While Cosgrove toured the city, the few
militiamen who have not left brandished
machetes as families hurried aboard crowd
ed Indonesian navy vessels and rusty cargo

ships.
Thousands of homeless people huddled
under tarpaulins along a narrow strip of
beach. Some looked out to sea for the for
eign warships on their way from northern
Australia.
"We are staying here ... because we
heard that the U.N. troops will come," said
Frederico de Jesus, 18, who was on the
beach. "They will bring peace. We will be
safer then."
Hundreds of supporters of Indonesian
rule, many of them the wives and children of
soldiers, waited in line Sunday to catch char
tered flights shuttling out to neighboring
West Timor, where tens of thousands have
already fled. Many wore Indonesia's red and
white colors.
"Foreign soldiers should stay out of
Timor. They have no right to occupy my
homeland," said Filomena da Silva, a Timo
rese-born Indonesian government worker.
Cosgrove warned the militias Sunday to
expect a "robust" response if they tried to

attack international troops.
Less than an hour after Cosgrove
returned to Darwin, gunfire erupted around
the Dili airport, and a column of black smoke
rose in the distance from a burning building.
Militia leaders have threatened to attack the
peacekeepers.
Meanwhile, Jose Alexandre "Xanana"
Gusmao, the recently freed East Timorese
rebel leader, flew to Darwin to meet with
other resistance figures. Spokesman Joao
Carrascalao said Sunday that Gusmao is
making plans for a transitional government
and sending a delegation to the World Bank
later this month.
The International Committee of the Red
Cross, meanwhile, plans to start a major
relief operation on Wednesday in East
Timor, spokeswoman Sri Wahvu Endah said
Sunday. The plan includes a mobile hospital
to back up the only civilian hospital in Dili.
"There are still no doctors" in the Dili
hospital, she said. " The medical equipment is
all gone."
