### 
GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) — The power is intermittent, much of the
county is completely under water, roads are closed, grocery store shelves are
empty and there's little gasoline available.
Can it get worse? Yes.
Greenville, a city of 44.(XX), faces still worse Hooding when the Tar River
crests Monday. And more rain could fall Monday and Tuesday.
"Everyone is figuring out their own survival," Carl Campbell said Sunday
as the river inched closer to his home and neighbors tried to save their
belongings from their Hooded homes.
Hurricane Floyd saturated eastern North Carolina with 20 inches of rain
last week on its way up the East Coast, and flooding has virtually shut down
the coastal plain east of Raleigh.
National Guard helicopters were used to search for stranded people and
to shuttle food to stricken towns where grocery shelves are bare. Drinkable
water had to be rushed to several counties where wastewater treatment sys
tems failed.
About 4(X) roads, including parts of Intcrstates 95 and 40. were still closed
Sunday, and IO.CKM) people remained in shelters.
At least 21 people are confirmed dead, including a Pinetops family lost
when they tried to escape their flooded home in a boat early Thursday. Oth
ers are unaccounted for.
They are among the at least 46 people killed from the Bahamas into New
England. And beyond North Carolina, thousands of people were still with

out electricity and phone service in parts of Virginia, Maryland. New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and New York state.
President Clinton has declared the eastern two-thirds of North Carolina a
disaster area and plans to tour flooded areas Monday.
The Tar River at Tarboro, about 20 miles northwest of Greenville, was
already estimated at 43 feet and still rising The old record for the city was just
34 feet, set back in 1919.
At Tarboro I ligh School in Edgecombe County, where about 3,(XX) peo
ple took shelter, volunteer 1 iattic Stocks called the situation desperate.
"We have no (running) water at all. and the water's still rising some. And
I can't tell you how many dead we have. They're still finding bodies floating."
she said.
In Pitt County, where Greenville is located, and nearby Edgecombe, all
water was undrinkable. Some shelters had low supplies of food and water and
no running water or electricity.
Grocery stores in Nash. Edgecombe, Bertie and Pitt counties were run
ning low, and a Berlin-style airlift was set up to deliver food and water.
Ominously, a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico slogged northward
Sunday, with a possibility of strengthening into Tropical Storm 1 larvey. I low
ever. forecasters were optimistic it would bring only a half-inch or less of rain
to the region.
"More rain on top of what they've already experienced just compounds
the problems and misery they've already been through." said state emergen-

cy management spokesman Tom Hegele.
Greenville was Hooded along a three-mile-long stretch of the Tar River.
Only the roofs of some two-story, riverside apartment buildings showed
above the water. One apartment roof had a sign painted on a sheet: "Send
beer. Hi Mom."
