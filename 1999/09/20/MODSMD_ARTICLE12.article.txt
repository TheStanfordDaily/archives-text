# Dispute in Kosovo
## NATO orders KLA to disband 
### 
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) —
NATO and the Kosovo Liberation
Army were reported in intense dis
cussions early Monday in an effort to
reach agreement on what will
become of the former rebel army
after it disbands.
NATO officials insisted that the
June agreement for the KLA to
demobilize remains in effect. But
they acknowledged that unspecified
problems prevented the two sides
from signing an agreement by the
midnight Sunday deadline on trans
forming the KLA into a 5,000-mem
ber civilian Kosovo Corps.
The KLA wants the new organi
zation to become the nucleus of a
new army of an independent Kosovo
- something NATO has refused.
NATO has insisted that the
peacekeepers must be the only
armed force in Kosovo. The Rus
sians and the Serbs — who consider
the KLA terrorists responsible for
attacks against Serb civilians —
oppose any formula that might
enable the KLA to continue with its
same organizational structure under
a different name
The transformation agreement
was to have been signed Sunday
morning by peacekeeping comman
der Gen. Mike Jackson and the
KLA military commander, Gen.
Agim Ceku, but the ceremony was
canceled.
NATO and the U.N. mission
were to begin organizing the Kosovo
Corps Monday morning. The group
was to help combat natural disasters
and take on other humanitarian and
civilian missions, such as firefighting
and rescues.
In a clear warning to the former
rebels. NATO spokesman Lt. Col.
Robin Clifford alluded to the demo
bilization agreement. He said Ceku
must sign by midnight "because after
that the KLA ceases to exist. So does
its general staff."
The deadline passed without an
agreement being signed on the new
force.
Ceku's staff told reporters the
general was unavailable to speak to

the news media. A well placed Alba
nian source, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Ceku insisted
KLA fighters be allowed to keep
their uniforms and red-and-black
emblems but that Jackson refused.
The KLA was promised new uni
forms for the Kosovo Corps but they
would not be ready for months, the
source said. The rebels also want
assurances they can retain a military
style command structure, the sources
said.
Hours before the midnight dead
line, the two sides were still in what
the sources described as difficult and
intensive talks.
NATO officials said Thursday
that the KLA had already turned in
more than K).(KX) weapons ahead of
the deadline and that the demilita
rization is effectively complete.
It is unclear, however, whether
those weapons constitute the total
number held by the rebels. Weapons
shown to reporters at NATO-guard
ed storage sites include old, bolt
action rifles.
NATO continues to report seiz
ing weapons such as submachine
guns, land mines and mortars that
were already supposed to have been
surrendered during the phased
demilitarization.
In recent days, senior KLA offi
cials have insisted that the force
serve as the nucleus of a national
army to defend the province against
the Serbs when the peacekeepers
leave. Some KLA officers spoke
openly about their reluctance to sur
render all weapons and dismantle
the KLA's military command struc
ture.
On Saturday, KLA leader
Hashim Thaci told a crowd at a cer
emony marking the KLA's farewell
that "the KLA is transforming. It
won't be called KLA but will lie a
defense force of the citizens and ter
ritory of Kosovo."
"I'm convinced the international
community will respect the demo
cratic right for self declaration and
referendum." he said. "And I am
convinced that you will vote for the

independence of Kosovo."
An independent Kosovo is
strongly opposed by Russia and
Yugoslavia, which retains nominal
sovereignty. Neither the United
States nor its Western allies have
openly called for an independent
Kosovo.
In an interview published Satur
day by the newspaper Koha Ditore,
Jackson said he believed Ceku and
other KLA leaders "will feel com
fortable in a future civil force of
Kosovo."
Jackson was quoted as saying a
few Kosovo Corps members may be

permitted to carry weapons. Koha
Ditore quoted unidentified NATO
officials as saying the figure may be
as high as 2(H) of the 3.(KK) full-time
corps members.
On Sunday, Clifford, the NATO
spokesman, suggested the delay was
due in part to disagreement over
who would control the new organi
zation. saying "the role of the KLA
leadership" was still being discussed.
For many fighters, giving up the
uniforms they wore during their des
perate. 18-month war against Serb
led Yugoslav forces will exact a high
emotional price.
