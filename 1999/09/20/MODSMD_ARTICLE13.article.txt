SALT LAKE CITY (AP)
"Always shoot ahead of the tar
get/' 61-year-old billionaire Jon
Huntsman says, reciting lessons
learned as a naval gunner. "You
have to use your imagination."
It's a philosophy that works for
the man who built the world's
largest privately owned chemical
company from scratch and is
embarking on his next mammoth
task: finding a cure for cancer.
Last week, he officially opened
the Huntsman Cancer Institute, a
six-story addition to the University
of Utah campus.
With $151 million out of his own
pocket and a pledge of millions
more each year, Huntsman built a
center that looks more like a corpo
rate headquarters than a hospital
and staffed it with 30() researchers
lured from the top laboratories in
the nation.
His priority is to focus on the
precursor genes that could help
doctors predict cancers, and he
envisions novel drugs and therapies
in the not-too-distant future that
doctors could administer to treat
afflicted patients and even prevent
the development of cancer in high
risk populations.
For Huntsman, the bottom line
is simple: end human suffering.
It's a goal he has carried since his
youth in rural Idaho, since receiving
a scholarship to study at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, since he
started donating $50 of his $320-
per-month naval salary to the poor
decades ago.
He found the means when he
created the Stvrofoam egg carton
and the famous McDonald's
clamshell burger container, then
went on to found his own company
in 1970.
He claims he is building a mas
sive petrochemical empire just so
he can give the proceeds away.
With April's purchase of four divi
sions of London's Imperial Chemi
cal Industries, Huntsman Corp. is
expected to nearly double its rev
enues to $7.5 billion per year.
Forbes magazine calculates Hunts
man's personal wealth at $3.2 bil

lion.
"It's such a joy to give money
away and it's such a privilege, and
it's even more than a privilege —
it's an absolute duty in life," Hunts
man says. His company lists chari
table giving in its mission state
ment, and its 16.000 employees reg
ularly top fund-raising lists for the
I Jnited Way and other causes.
The cancer institute —an
attempt to single-handedly revolu
tionize cancer care — is a personal
mission for Huntsman. His mother,
father and stepfather died of can
cer. and he has fought off prostate
and mouth cancer.
But. he insists, his goal is not to
protect his own nine children and
40 grandchildren, whose framed
pictures cover every inch of a table
in his living room.
"I don't think you can move sci
ence forward or provide resources
for science for your own personal
edification. It has to be for the gen
eral good." he says.
Eldest son Jon Jr. heads the can
cer institute, second son David runs
the company from Brussels, and all
of his children except his youngest
son. who is mentally disabled, work
in the business. Each family mem
ber is self-sufficient and none rely
on his largesse.
Down the hall, a phone rings.
Huntsman glances out at the Salt
Lake Valley spread below his
sunken living room — he's not usu
ally home during the day.he says,
and he's enjoying the novelty.
Above the fireplace is his favorite
painting, a scene of pioneers
camped by a stream.
A reproduction by the same
artist welcomes visitors to the can
cer center, where Huntsman's own
pioneers work in the lab. To some,
it seems a gamble.
Not to the man who never takes
notes into acquisition meetings, and
who says success is just a matter of
staying ahead of your target.
"It's hard to see inside each
other, what makes us tick and what
motivates us to take risks." he says.
"But I don't think I've ever taken a
risk in my life."
