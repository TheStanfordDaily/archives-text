## Editorial Changing roles 
### 
A former sports
junkie takes on the
news at Stanford

What was I thinking when I
became editor in chief? I'm
a sports guy.
I've covered national-champion
cross country teams. I've covered
Final Four squads in men's basketball
and rugby. I've never been to an
ASSU Senate meeting, never inter
viewed University President Gerhard
Casper and never spoken to Dean of
Students Marc Wais (unless I was tak
ing phone messages for either news or
opinions editors).
I've written all of two news stories.
Of course, one of those was about
Sixth Man ticket sales for the basket
ball team. I'm a fish out of water. I
belong here like Hugh Downs
belongs in the Yankee locker room.
I want to be Jim Murray or Grant
land Rice, not Bob Woodward.
But I've realized that none of that
really matters. I took this job because
I love Hie Daily. And I know the
most important reasons that this posi
tion even exists, which are our read
ers. We are here to report to you the
news truthfully, accurately and with
out bias. I promise to try to make sure
we do just that.
All I can give to you is my effort
and my word that each of you readers
means something to me.
Iliis doesn't exactly mean that I'm
the person to talk to because the club
you're involved in is staging an event,
and you want a story run. At times
such as those, I become more popular
than a Velvet Hammer at a Band
Shak party.
What I'm offering you is my ear.

I'm not going to redefine my editorial
policy because you feel I should, but I
am going to listen to concerns that
you may have.
I'm here for you. I honestly don't
need this job to pad my resume. Lord
knows I'm not in it for my health or to
enhance my social life. I'm here
because this is what I enjoy doing. But
I want to do it right.
And part of that comes in knowing
that we are serving our readers well.
You're not always going to agree with
what's written in this space; that's why
it's called Opinions. But you always
have the power to have your voice
heard. And I promise to listen.
But you have to do something for
me. I ask all of you to help yourselves
as well. Use this page. You think
something on campus isn't right?
Whether or not it's about ITie Daily,
as long as you think other Stanford
students should hear about it, write a
letter. Don't sit there and grumble
about it. Use that power.
Don't let us become complacent,
because the second that happens,
we'll stop doing our jobs as well as we
should. You are the ones who will
keep me in check, keep me diligent. If
somewhere along the course of this
volume you all stop caring about how
I'm doing my job, then I know this
volume won't be a success.
So we'll put a little trust in each
other. You promise to talk, and I'll
promise to listen. Make this the year
where students finally work vigorous
ly to build the kind of University they
really want.
Cheers,
