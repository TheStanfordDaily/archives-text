## Going beyond the rankings 
### 
About 10 days ago.
1 received an e
mail from an
incoming freshman who
had been reflecting on his
choice to come to Stan
ford in light of the latest
crop of college rankings

published at the end of each summer. This
student eloquently stated some very
insightful observations about the rankings
as well as the nature of an individual's
decision about which college to attend.
"I believe that it is impossible to quali
fy or quantify an education," he wrote.
"There is no reasonable way to describe a
university experience in just a few words
or numbers, since subjectivity is so inher
ent for each individual. Thus, any efforts
to 'rank' colleges will fall enormously
short."
Reflecting further upon the topic, he
said that he concluded fairly early on that
the rankings would play absolutely no role
in his choice of a university. "Why would I
put trust in a source which takes into
account only mere statistics and number
crunching?" he asked. The only ranking
that mattered for him was his own ranking,
and in that very personal regard, Stanford
stood out from the rest.
I was heartened by this letter for many
reasons, not the least of which was it rep
resents the clear-headed thinking and the
exceptional character of the students that
we admit to Stanford! Hut it also empha
sized something I observe each year as the

freshman and transfer classes arrive.
I am always struck anew by the sheer
joy and intense anticipation of our students
as they set out on their university careers
and their absolute faith in the knowledge
they have found the perfect place to be.
Nonetheless, I think the first week of
school is always a good time to stop and
reflect upon why, of all the choices you
might have made, you chose to come to
Stanford. You may have read what I have
to say elsewhere. But I should like to
remind you of it here, in order to make
sure that you keep in mind the range of
opportunities you will experience in the
coming months and years.
Why should you be at Stanford?
First and foremost, because Stanford is
one of the best universities in the world,
dedicated to the pursuit of many excel
lences. Academic endeavors at Stanford
cover almost the entire spectrum of possi
ble fields from the humanities to engineer
ing, from the social sciences to medicine.
Second, because we believe that at a
university one should think of undergradu
ates as participants in our efforts to
increase knowledge rather than as mem
bers of a separate entity called "the col
lege." What we have instituted in recent
years as Stanford Introductory Studies is
an expression of that core belief.
Third, because of the sheer quality of
the faculty, your fellow undergraduates
and the graduate students with whom you
will have opportunities to interact: by
choosing Stanford you will permit yourself

to he challenged.
Fourth, a related hut somewhat differ
ent point, because of the diversity Stanford
contains — as expressed by any measure
capturing a richness of academic
achievements and interests, artistic and
athletic accomplishments, ethnic and social
backgrounds.
Fifth, because there continues here
what one might call a "Western" spirit of
pioneering, entrepreneurship and energy.
Sixth, because of the opportunities
Stanford affords for service to the public
and for citizenship in its many forms.
Seventh, because the pursuit of many
excellences at Stanford includes athletics.
Eighth, because of Stanford's global
reach and its location on the Pacific Rim.
Ninth, because of Stanford's unsur
passed setting: the gentle climate, the
foothills, the bay, the yellow sandstone
arches and cloisters, the "red-tiled roofs
against the azure sky."
Tenth, and finally, you should be at
Stanford because of the ensemble and the
effect it produces. No other university can
claim the combination that is Stanford.
The freshman who wrote me about his
choice of Stanford finished his letter in the
following way: "Where else can I find such
an atmosphere conducive to academic
excellence and personal development
while simultaneously maintaining some of
the best weather in the country?"
Where else indeed!
Welcome — and welcome back — to
The Farm.
