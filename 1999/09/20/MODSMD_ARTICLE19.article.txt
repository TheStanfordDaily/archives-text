## Cardinal stuns Arizona in unexpected blowout Offense racks up 580 total yards, stingy defense wraps up Wildcats' high-octane offense 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
No one could have scripted it
better.
For a team with its share of
doubters, the Cardinal could not
have put on a more convincing
show Saturday, walloping No. 19
Arizona 50-22 in Tucson.
Arizona is No. 19 in the nation.
Arizona (2-2,0-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) was an overwhelming presea
son favorite to win the Pac-10 and
head to this year's Rose Bowl. Ari
zona has the Pae-10's top-ranked
pass defense and one of its most po
tent offenses. Stanford had not
beaten Arizona since 1990.
But none of this seemed to mat
ter as the Cardinal (2-1, 2-0)
stunned the Wildcats, rolling up
580 total yards and holding Ari
zona to just seven points in the first
half.
The victory marked the second
consecutive week the Cardinal
topped the 50-point barrier, a Stan
ford first.
Senior Todd Husak led the
Stanford juggernaut with a 21-for
-35, 364-yard passing performance.
Freshman Kerry Carter made his
first start of the season, rushing for
79 yards on 20 carries and scoring
three of the Cardinal's first four
touchdowns.
But for football critics, the game
made this year's Stanford team
even harder to explain.
After a dismal 69-17 loss at
Texas to open the season — a loss
that proved that Stanford had the
potential to perform very, very
badly — Stanford has outscored
Pac-10 rivals Washington State and
Arizona 104-39 on the last two Sat
urdays.
"We're still an enigma," head
coach Tyrone Willingham said.

Stanford's obvious strength is its
receiving corps, with Husak team
ing up with senior receivers Troy
Walters and Deßonnie Pitts and
junior receiver Dave Davis. To
gether, the corps racked up 351
yards and a touchdown.
Walters alone hauled in eight
passes for 168 yards, moving into
second place for career receiving
yards in the Pac-10.
But a pleasant surprise for the
Cardinal has been the success of
Carter. After coming off the bench
in Stanford's first two games,
Carter got the starting call Satur
day and responded explosively,
scoring three touchdowns, all in the
first half.
"We didn't know if we could run
against them," Willingham said.
"We knew we had to try."
Even more of a surprise Satur
day was the stunning performance
of Stanford's defense, which made
big plays throughout the game, reg
istered five sacks and grabbed
three interceptions, turning two of
them into touchdowns.
"1 think we're probably even a
greater mystery now, because of
that (loss to Texas)," defensive
coach Kent Baer said. "But I said
even then, please don't judge us on
that game. I don't think that was
us."
After Saturday's crushing of
Arizona, even the most hardened
Stanford critic would be inclined to
agree.
It was the Wildcats who got on
the scoreboard first on Saturday
when senior Ortcge Jenkins threw
a 10-yard touchdown pass to Brad
Brennan to put Arizona up 7-0.
Then, Stanford scored the next 30
points.
Stanford's streak began on a
field goal by junior Mike Biselli.
making the score 7-3. Then, an in

terception by senior strong safety
Tim Smith set up Carter's first
touchdown run.
" The first touchdown they got
was my fault," Smith said. "I didn't
play my zone right. When I played
my zone right the next time, I was
able to get the ball."
Carter's touchdown made the
score 10-7 with 17 seconds left in
the first quarter.
Stanford's next score was also
built off of a strong defensive ef
fort.

On Arizona's next drive, senior
outside linebacker Riall Johnson
— who netted five sacks last week
against Washington State, a perfor
mance that earned him Pac-10 De
fensive Player of the Week honors
— chased down Jenkinds before
sacking him for a 23-yard loss on
third down, forcing a punt.
Stanford got the ball and scored a
few plays later on a one-yard keeper
by Husak. running the score to 17-7.
The Cardinal ran into trouble
during the third quarter. The half

began with Stanford up 30-7, but
two quick touchdown passes from
Jenkins to senior wide receiver
Dennis Northcutt brought the
score to 30-22.
But Stanford answered right
back at the beginning of the fourth
quarter with a 65-yard drive which
ended in a 10-yard touchdown pass
to Davis, putting the score at 36-22.
The rest of the game was all
Stanford, as two more touchdown
runs — one by sophomore Casey
Moore for 49 vards and the other

hv junior Coy Wire for 44 yards -
brought the score to 50-22.
The win was an amazing feat for
a Stanford team that was supposed
to lay down and die against the
team most preseason critics picked
to be the Pac-10's best.
"I guess I'm surprised." Willing
ham said. "I don't think anybody
envisioned us scoring 50 points.
But I did feel if we executed, we
could have a chance to win. even

though this is one of the more diffi
cult places to come and play."
Walters seemed less surprised at
the potency of Stanford's offense.
"We have talent on this of
fense," he said, "and if we get
things done and we execute, we're
tough to stop."
For Arizona, the loss signified
the latest and most humiliating step
in the unraveling of the preseason
Pac-10 favorite.
After beginning the season with

a No. 4 ranking, the Wildcats
looked miserable in a 41-7 pound
ing by then-No. 2 Penn State, and
their ranking fell to No. 19. The loss
to Stanford, however, is Arizona')*
most drastic yet.
"It is hard to say anything," head
coach Dick Tomey said. " This was an
awful performance. It's a poorly
coached football team If anybody
in this room can sleep tonight,
not the men I thought they were." *
The Cardinal, meanwhile, occu*
ft
pies a position few thought likely
before the season, or after the firs*
game: sole holder of first place in
the Pac-10, with two victories.
