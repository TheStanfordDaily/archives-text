# Nurse accused of stealing drugs
## Packard caregiver allegedly used patient narcotics 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
A nurse at Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital has been accused of
using narcotics earmarked for young cancer patients. The nurse concealed
the thefts, which occurred over the course of nearly a year, by refilling the nar
cotic vials with saline solution, officials alleged.
No patients were injured as a result of the nurse's actions, said hospital of
ficials in a press release. The nurse has since been placed on administrative
leave.
However, the chief of the California Department of Health Services, Al
bert Quintero, said that the nurse's actions set up the potential for a danger
ous situation.
The saline solution the nurse used to mask the narcotic theft does not re
lieve pain, said Quintero in an interview with the San Jose Mercury News.
A child could have potentially been injected with one of the tampered vials
and could have not had the pain relieved.
The situation was made even more dangerous, Quintero said in the same
interview, because of the possibility of a doctor doubling a dose.
"What if they didn't know the narcotic had been replaced and they gave it
to kids?" Quintero said to the Mercury News. "The children are still going to
have pain, and then there's the danger of the doctor's prescribing a double
dose because it's not having the desired effect.''
The injection of saline into the vials posed a further hazard because the so
lution may have been contaminated and could have injured the patient. Quin
tero said in the same interview.
I lospital officials said that the nurse's actions did not harm patients be
cause the first series of thefts were obviously detectable.
"The vials were so obviously tampered with that they were immediately
discovered by another member of the nursing staff and removed before there
was any possibility of them being used," said a hospital press release.
In the following theft, the nurse "inappropriately requisitioned" supplies
so no patients were injected with the saline solution, said hospital officials.
The San Jose Mercury News reported that the thefts were first detected in
late 1998. Hospital officials said that when the first thefts were discovered,
they contacted the police and upgraded internal hospital drug control proce
dures.
Quintero said that the state Department of I lealth Services should have
been notified once the thefts were detected. I le said that hospital officials did

not notify DHS, and thai the department learned of the thefts only after a hos
pital employee logged a complaint with the department.
"They have to notify us of anything that affects the health and safety of
their patients," Quintero told the Mercury News. "This was diversion of nar
cotics. This is a felony. Certainly we need to know."
Hospital officials said that they were cooperating fully with DHS and their
review.
"We have not yet received the DHS' report on this matter," said officials in
the hospital's press release. "When we do, we will respond to it accordingly."
Once officials were able to identify a specific suspect, they reported the
nurse to the Board of Registered Nursing and placed her on administrative
leave. If the allegations are confirmed, the nurse may lose her license.
In the wake of the incident, hospital security has been upgraded. Chil
dren's Hospital officials said that they would review all staff procedures and
policies. Officials have also created a task force which will review the hospi
tal's Controlled Substance Policy.
