# Women's soccer falls to Nebraska, beats Seton Hall
## Cardinal splits weekend pair 
### Lori Maund 
There are two essential character
istics of a national championship
team: talent and desire. And the No.
22 Stanford women's soccer team (4-
2) has both.
With a stellar recruiting class and
eight returning seniors, there is little
doubt that this team has the ability to
win. This weekend, however, the
Cardinal showcased not only its abil
ity. but also its burning desire to win.
"We're hungry out there," senior
co-captain Jenn O'Sullivan said. "We
can win it. We can win it all and this
year we want to."
Despite a 2-1 loss to No. 3 Nebras
ka on Friday, the Cardinal came back
with a vengeance to defeat Seton
Hall 3-1 yesterday afternoon. Stan
ford came out fast in the first half and
repeatedly pounded the Pirates' de
fense with attempts on goal. 1 lowev
er, it wasn't until early in the second
half that the Cardinal was finally able
to put one away.
Five minutes into the second half,
senior Kelly Adamson collected a
cross from O'Sullivan at the top of
the box and deftly slotted it to the
right side of the goal past Seton I fall's
keeper to take the lead 1 -0.
"We made a point at halftime to
have the outside midfielders and de
fense to run down the Hanks and
cross it in. That's exactly what Jenn
did." Adamson said. "I found myself
wide open at the top of the box and I
hit it in."
Three minutes later, senior Ron
nie Fair converted a free kick to rally
another goal for the Cardinal. Fair's
shot, from outside the 18-yard line,
curved over the top of Seton Hall's
wall and bounced into the back of the
net.
"I hit the ball with the inside of my
foot, hoping to spin it around the wall.
It went right over [the wall] and the
keeper's vision was obstructed — it
bounced right in." Fair said.
The Cardinal's final goal came in
the 56th minute of play when fresh

man Becky Myers headed the ball in
off a corner kick from sophomore
Erin Maurer.
Seton I fall's only goal came from
senior Kelly Smith, a member of the
English national team, who also led
the nation last year in points per
game. Smith dribbled from the 30-
yard line and slotted a goal to the
right side past Stanford goalkeeper,
sophomore Carly Smolak.
The increase in ( ardinal scoring is
due, in part, to a shift in focus in prac
tices the last few weeks. The first few
weeks of training camp, Stanford fo
cused mainly of refining the defense.
But now the Cardinal has shifted the
focus to its offensive tactics.

"We arc moie olicnsi\e minded
and | hill 11 possession oriented."
Swanson said. "We've woikcd on
working the ball fastei in the other
team's hall and combining with one
another better."
Part of this offensive dominance
due to the combination ol forwards,

Wallis was able to penetrate the
Seton Hall defense with hei speed
and skill on the ball.
"I just do my best when I am out
there," Wallis said. "I know that

Stanford's record improves to 4-2
after yesterday's win and the squad is
building momentum as it heads into
this weekend's games.
"With every game, we get it a lit

year is hunger. We really want it
more, and we have people who can
convert that hunger to goals scored,"
senior co-captain Shauna Itri said
"This year we're going to do it."
