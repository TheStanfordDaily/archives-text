### Brie MacDonald Editorial staff 
After posting two three-game
victories this weekend, the No. 7
Stanford women's volleyball team
(5-1,2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) got
off to a solid start in Washington in
its bid to win a sixth-straight Pac
-10 crown.
The Cardinal started off its Pac
-10 conference play on Thursday
with a 15-5, 15-3, 15-10 win over
Washington at the Hec Edmunson
Pavilion.
The Stanford squad, arguably
the most dominant women's vol
leyball program of the past decade,
has now won 10 of its last 11 con
ference openers and is looking to
continue the long tradition of suc
cess.
And with Stanford's strong
combination of seasoned colle
giate veterans and talented new re
cruits, the team is showing the na
tion that it is once again a force to
be reckoned with.
Stanford took control early
against Washington, never trailing
in the first two games.
The Huskies rallied in game
three, but the Cardinal managed to
regain control late in the game and
secure the victory.
Senior Sarah Clark and fresh
man Logan Tom each posted 16
kills for the Cardinal, a season high
for Clark, who also contributed
nine digs and had a .536 hitting per
centage to lead the squad to victo
ry.
Tom recorded 10 digs, four
blocks and three service aces in yet
another impressive showing lor
the highly touted recruit, who in
only five games has established
herself as a formidible addition to
the team.
Walsh stepped it up for the Car
dinal on Thursday when she
played middle blocker for the first

time in her collegiate career due to
injuries to junior Jenn Detmer and
sophomore Tara Conrad.
Walsh — a three-time Ail-
American — collected 10 kills,
seven digs and six blocks on the
night.
Stanford outhit Washington
.406-. 198 and fnished the match
with 58 kills.
After downing the Huskies,
Stanford went on to sweep Wash
ington State (5-3, 1-1) Friday night
with a 15-3, 15-9, 15-4 victory in
Pullman, Wash., at Beasley Colise
um.
Once again, Tom led the squad
with 16 kills, eight digs and eight
blocks. Walsh added eight kills and
a match-high 15 digs while playing
middle blocker for the second con
secutive night.
But Tom wasn't the only new
face to make an impression. Fresh
man Ahley Ivy started in Walsh's
usual spot at outside hitter and hit
.381 while recording a career-high
11 kills.
Stanford also saw strong perfor
mances from Clark. Sandrik and
junior setter Lindsay Kagawa.
Clark tallied nine kills and 13 digs,
while Sandrik added 10 kills and
Kagawa contributed 47 assists and
10 digs.
Not only did Stanford take
home the win, it also made it per
fectly clear that it deserves the
moniker "powerhouse."
The Cardinal out-performed
the Cougars 5-1 in aces, 62-46 in
digs and 11-3 in blocks to capture
the match.
After Thursday's and Friday's
wins, Stanford improves its all
time record to 199-21 in Pac-10
play.
Under the direction of head
coach Don Shaw, the squad has
won the Pac-10 Conference title
every year since 1994 and is look
ing to repeat in '99.
