# Casper reflects on fond memories
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
University President Gerhard
Casper has one reservation in par
ticular concerning his tenure here
at Stanford — but it is not about
what one may think.
"I had my reservations, not
about doing the macarena, but
about getting criticized for the way
1 did it bv Justice [Stephen] Breyer
of the United States Supreme

Court at commencement." he
quipped, referring to a notorious
1996 Gaieties performance.
"I thought that was a little too
much."
Casper, who will step down
from his post as University presi
dent on Aug. 31, 2000. enjoys re
flecting on the number of student
interactions he has had during his
time at Stanford. Casper's thoughts
on his past seven years and his ob
jectives for this upcoming year in

elude a prominent foeus on under
graduate education and maintain
ing "personal contacts" with stu
dents — he it through Gaieties or
seminars or dorm discussions.
"One of the new challenges for
the incoming president will he to
maintain the high level of visibility
and student communication that
[Casper] has." said James Mon
tova, vice provost for student af
fairs.
Casper's decision to step down
comes at a time when he feels his
tenure has been "appropriate" in
length, although he said he "wor
ried a lot about the timing" at first.
"I just concluded that there is no
ideal time," Casper said. "There
are always reasons why you should
not step down, and there are rea
sons why you should step down. I
don't think 1 .. . can pick the ideal
time."
The President reflects
Casper clearly remembers his
first few days at Stanford and his
initial reactions to the University.
"Some newspapers have made
reference to the fact that supposed
ly I found it difficult to adjust to the
laid-back nature of California,"
Casper said. "California, laid
back? You've got to be kidding.
There is nothing laid-back,... and
surely. I did not find the Stanford
campus laid-back in any form or
shape.
"On a scale of one to 10. where
New York City is ten, this is 10.1."
Casper cites Stanford's "ensem
ble" as a reason for why he came
here.
"There are other universities
that have a good public service pro
gram." he said. "There are other
universities that have a nice setting,
but there is no university other
than Stanford that has this combi
nation," Casper said.
When Casper looks back at the


Josh Haner Daily
Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya joins the freshmen
in giving Casper a standing ovation at Convocation on Saturday.
"many activities [he has] been in
volved in,"he said that he would
like to be remembered for his es
tablishment of Stanford Introduc
tory Studies. He also identifies it as
the accomplishment by which to
define his career at Stanford.
"The most important for me has
been what we have been doing in
[SIS]," Casper said. "I hope we can
maintain [SIS] and continue to
raise funding for it. I will try to play
a role in that."
Casper hopes to teach in the
program that he created when he
returns to Stanford as a professor,
after a one-year sabbatical. As Uni
versity president, he has tried to
make time to teach some classes
and to appear as a guest lecturer.
"The job of being president of
Stanford is really a seven by 24
job," he said. "I have taught only
four times in the seven years, and
that is perhaps still more than other
presidents manage to do, but it is in
some way rather little."
, He said that his busy schedule
him from teaching as
;much as he would like.
"[Not being able to teach] was a
• disappointment to me, because my
• calendar is such that it is really al
.'most impossible to meet regularly
iwith the class, to prepare for the
iclass, to read papers, to write letters
|of recommendation."
| Casper said that he looks for
;ward to teaching again after his
sabbatical, and that despite his lack
of time as president, he is "pleased"
to have had the time to "teach as
much as he did."
Casper's view of his role
As a public figure on local, na

tional and international levels,
Casper said that "wherever [he]
goes, [he] is not just viewed as Ger
hard Casper."
"Whether I want to or not, I will
be viewed as the representative of
Stanford University, and therefore
I have to engage in a fair amount of
self-censorship, because I cannot
just speak my mind," he said.
"I am pretty open and do not
hesitate much about what I say ...
The manner in which I [speak] and
the directness of how I do so de
pends on the forum in which I
speak, and occasionally I have to
suppress what I would like to say
because it would create a tremen
dous uproar."
Nevertheless, he said that he has
been willing to "speak out" pub
licly about what he has thought
about issues, such as affirmative ac
tion and tenure.
"Most of the time it is best to
work quietly so that you don't cre
ate unnecessary controversy or side
issues," he said. "But on [UCSF-
Stanford Health Care and the
Labor Department complaints], I
will speak out when I think it's time
to speak out and when my speaking
out can generate more community
reactions.
"One of the areas that is particu
larly difficult to speak out is in gov
ernment investigations. I find that
very frustrating, because I would
like to speak, and yet those situa
tions tend to be so volatile, and
anything one says can automatical
ly become a factor in the investiga
tion."
Casper said that in reflecting
upon his position as president, as
well as the jobs of the provost and
the deans, that he considers the ad
ministration's role as "mostly to
support faculty and students."
"It was my job to maintain the
conditions for the work faculty and

students want to do, and I clearly
was very dedicated to doing that,"
he said.
Despite his many responsibili
ties, Casper calls himself "an au
thority without authority."
"All the most important deci
sions in the University — the ad
missions of students, the decisions
about appointments to the faculty
and curriculum — are in the hands
of the faculty, where they should
be."
In addition to the academic side
of Stanford, Casper addresses the
corporate nature of Stanford as
well, saying that he must act as the
corporation's CEO. Casper said
that when the clinics are counted as
a part of the annual budget, it
comes to a total of $2.2 billion a
year.
"We have all the same regulato
ry burdens that a for-profit organi
zation has, and we have to make
sure that we are compliant with a
myriad of regulations," he said.
"One has to make sure that our
budgets are realistic, that we can
meet our budget, and one has to
make decisions that are very diffi
cult," he said. "They are really
business decisions — such as what
to do about hospitals and clinics in
a sharply deteriorating health care
market, where neither the insurers
or government want to support
academic medical centers."
Casper cites his occupation as a
trustee as another significant duty.
"A trustee has to worry about
the long-term vitality of the Uni
versity," he said. "1 cannot just
worry about this generation of stu
dents or the present generation of
faculty. It is my obligation to worry
about Stanford 20 or 30 years from
now. Balancing the interests and
expectations of the present against
the future is a very difficult and del
icate job."

Casper said that another part of
his job as a trustee includes fund
raising, a job that he said one must
"devote a lot of time to."
He said that he also is a member
of the faculty, and that Stanford is
"wonderful in not having a gap" be
tween the administration and the
faculty,
"There is less 'we' and 'they' —
that is very important to have," he
said.
UCSF-Stanford problems
Casper said that he has been
"concerned with Medical Center is
sues from day-one onward."
"The poor performance of
UCSF-Stanford last year was
something that deeply disappoint
ed me, and 1 still very much hope
that 1 can find a solution within the
next few weeks," Casper said.
"Clearly, I would have preferred
that UCSF-Stanford was a flourish
ing enterprise, and to the extent
that we have not accomplished that
is not a happy aspect, from my
point of view."
Casper said that support of the
health care market and academic
medical centers has deteriorated.
He said that "one has to try innova
tive solutions, one has to experi
ment."
"It is the nature of some experi
ments that they will fail." he said. "1
am not sure [UCSF-Stanford] will
fail, but I think if it fails, I clearly
will be unhappy. I still think it was
important to try a bold approach to
the issues in the Medical Center."
"At every transition, there are
significant problems," said former
University President and Biology
Prof. Donald Kennedy. "Not every
president or provost can solve
them, but it is the possible solutions
that come forth in the process that
are important."

The transition
Casper's exit is only the latest in
a series of changes at the highest
levels of the University's adminis
tration. During the 1998-99 acade
mic year, new individuals became
deans of the Business School, the
Law School and the Engineering
School. There is a new head of
SLAC, and a different face in the
Provost's Office.
Casper said that he is not con
cerned about leaving at a time
when many of the University's
leaders are still new on the job.
"1 was just so pleased with the
appointments made this year."
Casper said. "In most universities,
the pool for talent to take on these
positions tends to be very small. I
don't think it's particularly deep at
Stanford either, but the small pool
is such a high-quality pool that I
just have the greatest confidence
that they will do a great job."
Provost John Hennessy said that
the recent changes in positions is
"probably all coincidental in tim
ing."
"The overall group of people
that is coming in will have a differ
ent set of responsibilities, which
will be hard at first, but there's a lot
of stability in this group, and it's a
very talented one." Hennessy said.
"The transition from Kennedy
to Casper worked well, and then,
the problems were much more
acute than the ones we're facing
now," I lennessy said.
Casper said that he recognizes
the transition for his successor will
be difficult, but that the provost can
act as an "excellent guide."
"1 was placed in my first year
with a provost who had been ap
pointed in Kennedy's last year."
Casper said. "[Former Provost
Gerald Lieberman] was just won
derful.

"You come into a place from
elsewhere, and you don't know the
place," he said.
"I had a couple of people I knew
very well at Stanford, but other
wise, nobody. Lieberman was a
wonderful guide to Stanford, and I
will forever remember him. He was
essential to my survival in the first
year."
The University's future
Casper calls the University an
"immensely complex organiza
tion," as one of the leading institu
tions of the world, with a "dizzying
number of different programs."
"Nowhere in the for-profit
world would you find any company
that has so many different "prod
uct-lines' as we do," Casper said.
"It is a very complex world to have
responsibility for."
Casper believes that the status
of most universities is "incredibly
fragile." because "we do so much,
and relatively speaking, have such
limited resources."
"I'm always very nervous about
what will be the future," Casper
said. "Even if 'A' has been accom
plished. how long will 'A' last and
what will be the impact of the next
crisis on 'A.' "
Despite this uncertainty. Casper
calls Stanford's "optimistic" nature
as a key to the success of the Uni
versity in the future.
"I think it's important to think
about whether the University on
the whole is optimistic and in good
spirits, and I think Stanford is. That
clearly was not my accomplishment
— that was something where we all
worked together — the faculty, the
students and the staff. I 'm very glad
to see Stanford in that mindset, and
I hope Stanford will continue in
that mindset for a long time. And if
we have that, we are really quite
unbeatable."
University President Gerhard
Casper has one reservation in par
ticular concerning his tenure here
at Stanford — but it is not about
what one may think.
"I had my reservations, not
about doing the macarena, but

quipped, referring to a notorious

out can generate more community
reactions.
"One of the areas that is particu
larly difficult to speak out is in gov
ernment investigations. I find that
very frustrating, because I would
like to speak, and yet those situa
tions tend to be so volatile, and
anything one says can automatical
ly become a factor in the investiga
tion."
Casper said that in reflecting
upon his position as president, as
well as the jobs of the provost and
the deans, that he considers the ad
ministration's role as "mostly to
support faculty and students."
"It was my job to maintain the
conditions for the work faculty and

students want to do, and I clearly
was very dedicated to doing that,"
he said.
Despite his many responsibili
ties, Casper calls himself "an au
thority without authority."
"All the most important deci
sions in the University — the ad
missions of students, the decisions
about appointments to the faculty
and curriculum — are in the hands
of the faculty, where they should
be."
In addition to the academic side
of Stanford, Casper addresses the
corporate nature of Stanford as
well, saying that he must act as the
corporation's CEO. Casper said
that when the clinics are counted as
a part of the annual budget, it
comes to a total of $2.2 billion a
year.
"We have all the same regulato
ry burdens that a for-profit organi
zation has, and we have to make
sure that we are compliant with a
myriad of regulations," he said.
"One has to make sure that our
budgets are realistic, that we can
meet our budget, and one has to
make decisions that are very diffi
cult," he said. "They are really
business decisions — such as what
to do about hospitals and clinics in
a sharply deteriorating health care
market, where neither the insurers
or government want to support
academic medical centers."
Casper cites his occupation as a
trustee as another significant duty.
"A trustee has to worry about
the long-term vitality of the Uni
versity," he said. "1 cannot just
worry about this generation of stu
dents or the present generation of
faculty. It is my obligation to worry
about Stanford 20 or 30 years from
now. Balancing the interests and
expectations of the present against
the future is a very difficult and del
icate job."

Casper said that another part of
his job as a trustee includes fund
raising, a job that he said one must
"devote a lot of time to."
He said that he also is a member
of the faculty, and that Stanford is
"wonderful in not having a gap" be
tween the administration and the
faculty,
"There is less 'we' and 'they' —
that is very important to have," he
said.
UCSF-Stanford problems
Casper said that he has been
"concerned with Medical Center is
sues from day-one onward."
"The poor performance of
UCSF-Stanford last year was
something that deeply disappoint
ed me, and 1 still very much hope
that 1 can find a solution within the
next few weeks," Casper said.
"Clearly, I would have preferred
that UCSF-Stanford was a flourish
ing enterprise, and to the extent
that we have not accomplished that
is not a happy aspect, from my
point of view."
Casper said that support of the
health care market and academic
medical centers has deteriorated.
He said that "one has to try innova
tive solutions, one has to experi
ment."
"It is the nature of some experi
ments that they will fail." he said. "1
am not sure [UCSF-Stanford] will
fail, but I think if it fails, I clearly
will be unhappy. I still think it was
important to try a bold approach to
the issues in the Medical Center."
"At every transition, there are
significant problems," said former
University President and Biology
Prof. Donald Kennedy. "Not every
president or provost can solve
them, but it is the possible solutions
that come forth in the process that
are important."

The transition
Casper's exit is only the latest in
a series of changes at the highest
levels of the University's adminis
tration. During the 1998-99 acade
mic year, new individuals became
deans of the Business School, the
Law School and the Engineering
School. There is a new head of
SLAC, and a different face in the
Provost's Office.
Casper said that he is not con
cerned about leaving at a time
when many of the University's
leaders are still new on the job.
"1 was just so pleased with the
appointments made this year."
Casper said. "In most universities,
the pool for talent to take on these
positions tends to be very small. I
don't think it's particularly deep at
Stanford either, but the small pool
is such a high-quality pool that I
just have the greatest confidence
that they will do a great job."
Provost John Hennessy said that
the recent changes in positions is
"probably all coincidental in tim
ing."
"The overall group of people
that is coming in will have a differ
ent set of responsibilities, which
will be hard at first, but there's a lot
of stability in this group, and it's a
very talented one." Hennessy said.
"The transition from Kennedy
to Casper worked well, and then,
the problems were much more
acute than the ones we're facing
now," I lennessy said.
Casper said that he recognizes
the transition for his successor will
be difficult, but that the provost can
act as an "excellent guide."
"1 was placed in my first year
with a provost who had been ap
pointed in Kennedy's last year."
Casper said. "[Former Provost
Gerald Lieberman] was just won
derful.

"You come into a place from
elsewhere, and you don't know the
place," he said.
"I had a couple of people I knew
very well at Stanford, but other
wise, nobody. Lieberman was a
wonderful guide to Stanford, and I
will forever remember him. He was
essential to my survival in the first
year."
The University's future
Casper calls the University an
"immensely complex organiza
tion," as one of the leading institu
tions of the world, with a "dizzying
number of different programs."
"Nowhere in the for-profit
world would you find any company
that has so many different "prod
uct-lines' as we do," Casper said.
"It is a very complex world to have
responsibility for."
Casper believes that the status
of most universities is "incredibly
fragile." because "we do so much,
and relatively speaking, have such
limited resources."
"I'm always very nervous about
what will be the future," Casper
said. "Even if 'A' has been accom
plished. how long will 'A' last and
what will be the impact of the next
crisis on 'A.' "
Despite this uncertainty. Casper
calls Stanford's "optimistic" nature
as a key to the success of the Uni
versity in the future.
"I think it's important to think
about whether the University on
the whole is optimistic and in good
spirits, and I think Stanford is. That
clearly was not my accomplishment
— that was something where we all
worked together — the faculty, the
students and the staff. I 'm very glad
to see Stanford in that mindset, and
I hope Stanford will continue in
that mindset for a long time. And if
we have that, we are really quite
unbeatable."
University President Gerhard
Casper has one reservation in par
ticular concerning his tenure here
at Stanford — but it is not about
what one may think.
"I had my reservations, not
about doing the macarena, but
about getting criticized for the way
1 did it bv Justice [Stephen] Breyer
of the United States Supreme

Court at commencement." he
quipped, referring to a notorious
1996 Gaieties performance.
"I thought that was a little too
much."
Casper, who will step down
from his post as University presi
dent on Aug. 31, 2000. enjoys re
flecting on the number of student
interactions he has had during his
time at Stanford. Casper's thoughts
on his past seven years and his ob
jectives for this upcoming year in

elude a prominent foeus on under
graduate education and maintain
ing "personal contacts" with stu
dents — he it through Gaieties or
seminars or dorm discussions.
"One of the new challenges for
the incoming president will he to
maintain the high level of visibility
and student communication that
[Casper] has." said James Mon
tova, vice provost for student af
fairs.
Casper's decision to step down
comes at a time when he feels his
tenure has been "appropriate" in
length, although he said he "wor
ried a lot about the timing" at first.
"I just concluded that there is no
ideal time," Casper said. "There
are always reasons why you should
not step down, and there are rea
sons why you should step down. I
don't think 1 .. . can pick the ideal
time."
The President reflects
Casper clearly remembers his
first few days at Stanford and his
initial reactions to the University.
"Some newspapers have made
reference to the fact that supposed
ly I found it difficult to adjust to the
laid-back nature of California,"
Casper said. "California, laid
back? You've got to be kidding.
There is nothing laid-back,... and
surely. I did not find the Stanford
campus laid-back in any form or
shape.
"On a scale of one to 10. where
New York City is ten, this is 10.1."
Casper cites Stanford's "ensem
ble" as a reason for why he came
here.
"There are other universities
that have a good public service pro
gram." he said. "There are other
universities that have a nice setting,
but there is no university other
than Stanford that has this combi
nation," Casper said.
When Casper looks back at the


Josh Haner Daily
Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya joins the freshmen
in giving Casper a standing ovation at Convocation on Saturday.
"many activities [he has] been in
volved in,"he said that he would
like to be remembered for his es
tablishment of Stanford Introduc
tory Studies. He also identifies it as
the accomplishment by which to
define his career at Stanford.
"The most important for me has
been what we have been doing in
[SIS]," Casper said. "I hope we can
maintain [SIS] and continue to
raise funding for it. I will try to play
a role in that."
Casper hopes to teach in the
program that he created when he
returns to Stanford as a professor,
after a one-year sabbatical. As Uni
versity president, he has tried to
make time to teach some classes
and to appear as a guest lecturer.
"The job of being president of
Stanford is really a seven by 24
job," he said. "I have taught only
four times in the seven years, and
that is perhaps still more than other
presidents manage to do, but it is in
some way rather little."
, He said that his busy schedule
him from teaching as
;much as he would like.
"[Not being able to teach] was a
• disappointment to me, because my
• calendar is such that it is really al
.'most impossible to meet regularly
iwith the class, to prepare for the
iclass, to read papers, to write letters
|of recommendation."
| Casper said that he looks for
;ward to teaching again after his
sabbatical, and that despite his lack
of time as president, he is "pleased"
to have had the time to "teach as
much as he did."
Casper's view of his role
As a public figure on local, na

tional and international levels,
Casper said that "wherever [he]
goes, [he] is not just viewed as Ger
hard Casper."
"Whether I want to or not, I will
be viewed as the representative of
Stanford University, and therefore
I have to engage in a fair amount of
self-censorship, because I cannot
just speak my mind," he said.
"I am pretty open and do not
hesitate much about what I say ...
The manner in which I [speak] and
the directness of how I do so de
pends on the forum in which I
speak, and occasionally I have to
suppress what I would like to say
because it would create a tremen
dous uproar."
Nevertheless, he said that he has
been willing to "speak out" pub
licly about what he has thought
about issues, such as affirmative ac
tion and tenure.
"Most of the time it is best to
work quietly so that you don't cre
ate unnecessary controversy or side
issues," he said. "But on [UCSF-
Stanford Health Care and the
Labor Department complaints], I
will speak out when I think it's time
to speak out and when my speaking
out can generate more community
reactions.
"One of the areas that is particu
larly difficult to speak out is in gov
ernment investigations. I find that
very frustrating, because I would
like to speak, and yet those situa
tions tend to be so volatile, and
anything one says can automatical

the transition for his successor will
be difficult, but that the provost can
act as an "excellent guide."
"1 was placed in my first year
with a provost who had been ap
pointed in Kennedy's last year."
Casper said. "[Former Provost
Gerald Lieberman] was just won
derful.

"You come into a place from
elsewhere, and you don't know the
place," he said.
"I had a couple of people I knew
very well at Stanford, but other
wise, nobody. Lieberman was a
wonderful guide to Stanford, and I
will forever remember him. He was
essential to my survival in the first
year."
The University's future
Casper calls the University an
"immensely complex organiza
tion," as one of the leading institu
tions of the world, with a "dizzying
number of different programs."
"Nowhere in the for-profit
world would you find any company
that has so many different "prod
uct-lines' as we do," Casper said.
"It is a very complex world to have
responsibility for."
Casper believes that the status
of most universities is "incredibly
fragile." because "we do so much,
and relatively speaking, have such
limited resources."
"I'm always very nervous about
what will be the future," Casper
said. "Even if 'A' has been accom
plished. how long will 'A' last and
what will be the impact of the next
crisis on 'A.' "
Despite this uncertainty. Casper
calls Stanford's "optimistic" nature
as a key to the success of the Uni
versity in the future.
"I think it's important to think
about whether the University on
the whole is optimistic and in good
spirits, and I think Stanford is. That
clearly was not my accomplishment
— that was something where we all
worked together — the faculty, the
students and the staff. I 'm very glad
to see Stanford in that mindset, and
I hope Stanford will continue in
that mindset for a long time. And if
we have that, we are really quite
unbeatable."
