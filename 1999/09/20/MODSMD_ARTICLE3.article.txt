# Casper reflects on fond memories

University President Gerhard
Casper has one reservation in par
ticular concerning his tenure here
at Stanford — but it is not about
what one may think.
"I had my reservations, not
about doing the macarena, but
about getting criticized for the way
1 did it bv Justice [Stephen] Breyer
of the United States Supreme

Court at commencement." he
quipped, referring to a notorious
1996 Gaieties performance.
"I thought that was a little too
much."
Casper, who will step down
from his post as University presi
dent on Aug. 31, 2000. enjoys re
flecting on the number of student
interactions he has had during his
time at Stanford. Casper's thoughts
on his past seven years and his ob
jectives for this upcoming year in

elude a prominent foeus on under
graduate education and maintain
ing "personal contacts" with stu
dents — he it through Gaieties or
seminars or dorm discussions.
"One of the new challenges for
the incoming president will he to
maintain the high level of visibility
and student communication that
[Casper] has." said James Mon
tova, vice provost for student af
fairs.
Casper's decision to step down
comes at a time when he feels his
tenure has been "appropriate" in
length, although he said he "wor
ried a lot about the timing" at first.
"I just concluded that there is no
ideal time," Casper said. "There
are always reasons why you should
not step down, and there are rea
sons why you should step down. I
don't think 1 .. . can pick the ideal
time."
The President reflects
Casper clearly remembers his
first few days at Stanford and his
initial reactions to the University.
"Some newspapers have made
reference to the fact that supposed
ly I found it difficult to adjust to the
laid-back nature of California,"
Casper said. "California, laid
back? You've got to be kidding.
There is nothing laid-back,... and
surely. I did not find the Stanford
campus laid-back in any form or
shape.
"On a scale of one to 10. where
New York City is ten, this is 10.1."
Casper cites Stanford's "ensem
ble" as a reason for why he came
here.
"There are other universities
that have a good public service pro
gram." he said. "There are other
universities that have a nice setting,
but there is no university other
than Stanford that has this combi
nation," Casper said.
