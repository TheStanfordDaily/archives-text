Stanford's largest group of freshmen — 1.750 of them
—charged around campus this weekend, attending a busy
Orientation, which differed from ones in the years past,
due to the large size of the class and a diminished presence
of alcohol, according to orientation staff and Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais.
A main difference in this year's Orientation versus
those in previous years was that alcohol was much less a
part of the experience.
Wais said that the decrease in drinking during the
weekend was a result of improved training of staff and vol
unteers.
"I think we gave a greater emphasis on alcohol training

this year:... As always, we really stressed awareness and
prevention," Wais said.
According to Wais, the administration's concern ovci;
drinking by new students was heightened by an incident
during Admit Weekend last April.
At the time, a 17-year-old female, prospective fresh
man was sent to Stanford Hospital after passing out in
Branner Hall due to excessive alcohol consumption.
"1 think [that incident] re-inforced the notion that the
campus community needed to be more careful with new
students," Wais said.
Upperclass students who volunteered during Orienta
tion observed the administration's increased enforcement
of alcohol-free events.
"I haven't seen much alcohol. It
was not that big of a thing this year. I
think last year was much worse," Fu
jikami said.
Orientation volunteer Robyn
Lamar, who worked at this year's
freshman party at Tresidder Union,
also noticed the scarcity of alcohol.
"My job at the party was to con
fiscate alcohol, and we really didn't
get much. We were expecting a lot
more drunk freshmen at the party.
The majority of the freshmen were
having fun sober," she said.
Another freshman who wished to
remain anonymous stated, "I saw a
couple of people drinking, but 1
smelled alcohol more than I saw it."
Another issue that came up in this
year's Orientation was the large size
of the Class of 2003.
Sophomore Gina Fujikami, an
advising associate, said that the size
of the class has put a strain on acade
mic advising resources.
"I think that the number of stu
dents per advisor has risen this year.
I know some advisors who are han
dling eight students," Fujikami said.
Lamar, a sophomore, also noticed
the strain the new class put on the
campus' resources.
"We had real trouble fitting
everyone into Memorial Auditori
um for the 'Real World Stanford'
performance," she said.
