Stanford's largest group of freshmen — 1.750 of them
—charged around campus this weekend, attending a busy
Orientation, which differed from ones in the years past,
due to the large size of the class and a diminished presence
of alcohol, according to orientation staff and Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais.
A main difference in this year's Orientation versus
those in previous years was that alcohol was much less a
part of the experience.
Wais said that the decrease in drinking during the
weekend was a result of improved training of staff and vol
unteers.
"I think we gave a greater emphasis on alcohol training

this year:... As always, we really stressed awareness and
prevention," Wais said.
According to Wais, the administration's concern ovci;
drinking by new students was heightened by an incident
during Admit Weekend last April.
At the time, a 17-year-old female, prospective fresh
man was sent to Stanford Hospital after passing out in
Branner Hall due to excessive alcohol consumption.
"1 think [that incident] re-inforced the notion that the
campus community needed to be more careful with new
students," Wais said.
Upperclass students who volunteered during Orienta
tion observed the administration's increased enforcement
