### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
In front of a crowd of over a hundred people, in
cluding dozens of secret service agents and television
cameras, Mary McAleese, president of Ireland, spoke
yesterday afternoon at the Bechtel Conference center.
Though she was expected to focus on Ireland's rela
tionship with Silicon Valley, her talk was mainly about
the importance of Ireland's current, unprecedented
economic surge.
David Holloway, director of the Institute of Interna
tional Studies, introduced McAleese. Provost John
I lennessy and Robert Joss, dean of the business school,
both attended the conference.
Holloway gave a brief biography of the president,
citing her law training, her 12 years as a professor of
criminal law. and her great commitment to and in
volvement in the public life of both Northern and
Southern Ireland.
Early in her speech McAleese discussed how Ireland
is experiencing a "reversed tide of emigration." The
level of growth and prosperity occurring in Ireland is
helping to draw the Irish back to their native country.
After mentioning that Ireland is the second-largest
exporter of software, she said, "Before, our biggest ex
port was people."
In the past 10 years, the Irish GDP has risen from 60
percent of the European average to being above the
European norm. Unemployment is under six percent
and "plummeting."
McAleese spoke of the "buzz of confidence in the
air" and the "can-do sense about the place." She went
on to say that "instead of the drain of energy, we are
now fueled by energy."
All of this has given the Irish a renewed sense of
pride and spirit, according to McAleese.
