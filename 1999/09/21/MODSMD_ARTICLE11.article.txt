Casper's imminent
departure leaves a
specific role that
needs to be filled

THESE DAYS, a good university
president is not easy to come by.
Long before Gerhard Casper
steps down from the presidency next
August, the Board of Trustees will
have appointed a search committee,
whose task it will be to select Casper's
successor. This committee must ensure
that, in making its decision, it does not
focus solely on finding a good adminis
trator, but rather considers someone
who can increase Stanford's visibility
to the outside world and still maintain
strong ties and a good rapport with its
students.
The new president should be easily
accessible to the entire Stanford com
munity, especially the students. Main
taining a high visibility on campus is
particularly important, whether it is
saying hello while crossing the Quad in
the morning, visiting a student group
meeting or stories in
the residence halls.
Casper's successor must be an eager
listener. The president's job isn't to
please "all of the people all of the
time," but it is imperative to take
everyone's concerns into account. It is
simply not enough to make oneself
"available," however; the new presi
dent should take an active role by con
tinuing Casper's tradition of inviting
feedback from members of the Stan
ford community.
Meetings with community members
should be granted; informal tea-drink
ing gatherings should continue. No one
should feel intimidated by the prospect
of approaching the president with con

cerns. Our new president should strive
to create an atmosphere of community
that emulates the closeness and
warmth of a small liberal arts college.
The president must be academically
minded and maintain a high standard
of academic excellence. As the leader
of a world-famous research university,
Stanford's reputation of being a haven
for new and ground-breaking ideas
must continue. Though the university
may have more of a reputation for its
accomplishments in the sciences, sup
port for the humanities must be main
tained to ensure that Stanford's equal
ly strong English and History depart
ments do not lose their competitive
edge to other schools.
However, all this focus on research
should not lead the administration to
neglect its heart and soul: the under
graduates. More should be done to
balance the demands of conducting
research and teaching, in both human
ities and sciences. Furthermore,
undergraduates must be involved in
the work of their professors so that
they too can benefit from a close per
sonal relationship with faculty.
In a community that prides itself in
its diversity, the president must help to
foster an environment that is tolerant
of and sensitive to the viewpoints and
backgrounds of all Stanford communi
ty members. He must be able to repre
sent the needs and concerns of the
entire Stanford community.
Last but not least, Casper's succes
sor should have a sense of humor, a
level of joviality that allows him to exit
the confines of the office and jump on
stage in Memorial Auditorium for a
Gaieties cameo. To cheer alongside of
the Sixth Men in Maples Pavilion. To
make good use of disparaging remarks
about Cal.
These are hard shoes to fill. But
after all, no one said it was an easy job.
