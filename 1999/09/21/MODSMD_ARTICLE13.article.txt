# Online textbook companies offer alternatives to Bookstore
## 
### Sarah Rapawy Staff writer 
While the Stanford Bookstore
has gone online and Stanford stu
dents are entering the online book
store market, it remains to be seen
whether the online craze has low
ered textbook prices.
The Stanford Bookstore now al
lows students to purchase books
online, but it faces competition
from a growing number of online
bookstores.
At some colleges students have
no choice hut to go online. Her
itage College, a liberal arts college
of 1.139 students, once ordered
books from over two do/en pub
lishers. The school's bookstore has
now emptied its shelves and signed
an exclusive contract with Varsity-
Books.Com. A similar arrange
ment has been made at Alaska Pa
cific University.
Friedel. marketing manager for
the Bookstore, says that many or
ders have already been placed on
the Web site since it was made
available yesterday morning.
Online companies are also
launching massive promotional
and advertising campaigns to reach
college students, encouraging stu
dents to bypass their campus book
stores altogether. Many of the
companies' commercials depict
campus stores as overpriced.
For the second year in a row. the
I ollet Corporation is spending $10
million to advertise its Web site. Its
slogan, "Get Out of Line" depicts
penguins marching single file or a
herd of buffalo and is placed every
where, including Rolling Stone
Magazine. Mademoiselle and
ESPN.
One of the largest online book
retailers, Varsityßooks.com, an
nounced in August that it will do
nate live percent of its sales to stu

dent scholarship funds.
"We'd like to give a little some
thing back to the students who
have helped us to be so successful."
said Allen (ioldberg. head of Affil
iate Relations at
Varsityßooks.com. I he company's
co-founder and chief executive,
l.ric Kuhn, predicts that within the
next three years, more than half of
the $.Vbillion textbook business in
the United States will move online.
Stanford students, such as com
puter science graduate student
Thai I ran, are also trying to tap
into the industry. I ran founded his
now l()-person corporation Viva -
mart.com last winter and spring
quarters as part of his undergradu
ate computer science senior pro
ject.
Although the company does not
sell books itself, it helps students to
find the best deals by comparing 17

online textbook retailers, including
the Stanford bookstore. Students
simply enter the class they want,
and Viva Smart.com shows a class
book list with the best buy for each
book.
I ran thinks his company will
help challenge the bookstore,
which until now has sold 98 percent
of campus textbooks. He says he
was inspired by Danny Branzon,
( lass of 1998 and founder of the or
ganization Stop Monopolies on
Campus, which included a non
profit book-swap among students.
During his years at Stanford, Bran
zon would stand on the steps of the
bookstore and yell into a bullhorn,
"don't buy books at the Book
store."
Although Branzon's book-swap
quickly dissolved after his gradua

tion. his idea lives on.
Stanford junior Eric Hsu and se
nior Andy Ku will he in White
Plaza this entire week, 10 a.m. to 3
p.m.. organizing a book-swap
through their non-profit organiza
tion. Frog Books, which also can be
visited online.
"1 feel like I'm in an abusive re
lationship with the Bookstore. One
minute, I'm looking at my receipt,
vowing never to let the bookstore
rip me off again; the next I'm at the
window begging lo get more than
15 percent for my book. I know I'm
not the only one with this prob
lem," said Hsu.
Hsu and Ku hope their organi
zation will become part of the As

soeiated Students of Stanford Uni
versity.
Despite what seems to be a
wave of negative attention aimed
at the Bookstore's monopoly,
Friedel is not concerned.
"The Web site companies are
also competing amongst them
selves. I think healthy competition
is good." he said. Friedel hopes
that such competition will draw at
tention to the publishing compa
nies who he thinks are truly at fault
for high textbook prices.
Friedel thinks that Viva-
Smart.com will actually help the
Bookstore's business, as its com
parisons show online companies to
have equivalent if only slightly
lower prices to the Bookstore, ac
cording to Friedel.
"The Bookstore only has a slim
margin of profit." he said.
