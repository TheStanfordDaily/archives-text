# Acosta makes news as new director of communications
## 
### Anuj Gupta Editorial staff 
Alan Acosta is used to giving out
the news. As director of the Stan
ford News Service, he handled sto
ries ranging from scientific break
throughs to athletic triumphs.
This time, however, Acosta is
making the news. In August, he left
the News Service to become direc
tor of University communications.
Acosta stepped in when Terry
Shepard departed in June to be
come the vice president for public
affairs at Rice University in Hous
ton.
Coniiminications chief
Acosta described his role as a
communications liaison within the
University and to the outside
world.
"1 work with the President and
Provost and other senior officials ...
to communicate with various con
stituencies: internally with staff, stu
dents and faculty, and externally
with the media, alumni, public and
friends of Stanford," he said.
Another key role of his new job
is to improve the lines of communi
cation between different branches
of the University, Acosta said.
"| I am | also working closely with
people who do communications all
over the University to ... enlist
their support for Stanford as an in
stitution to communicate better."
Acosta said his new role pre
sents him with many challenges,
pointing out two areas in particular.
"Clearly, Stanford is such a di
verse place, and being reasonably

decentralized ... it's [a challenge)
trying to get people to work togeth
er to achieve some results that help
us create a better sense of who we
are," he said.

Also. he
added. "Some of
the challenge is in
the way that
members of the
public are per
ceiving large insti
tutions now. My
challenge is to ...

get the message out there that we
feel like we're doing things that
benefit the public and society."
Acosta's News Service tenure
Acosta served as director of the
News Service for nearly three
years, a stint during which he spear
headed many "exciting" initiatives,
"trying to conceptualize a News
Service beyond print," he said.
This effort included the creation
of a daily online version of the Stan
ford Report, the News Service's
publication of news and events re
lated to the University.
Also during Acosta's tenure, the
News Service worked with the
Alumni Association to create
an online alumni
newsletter.
Major news stories involving
Stanford always place heavy de
mands on staffers at the News Ser
vice. Acosta said.
"Whenever there's big news that
involves Stanford, everyone wants
everything right now... instances
such as Nobel prizes or getting fa
mous freshmen here," he said.

"The staff at the News Service
really rose to the challenge on those
occasions," he added.
As his successor at the News Ser
vice. Acosta selected Eileen Walsh,
who had served as his associate di
rector.
An involved resident fellow
Acosta is perhaps best known to
students in his role as an RF in Casa
Zapata, Stanford's Latino-theme
house, where he is beginning his
third year.
Senior Ben Lipson. a current
resident of Zapata who served as a
resident assistant there last year,
described working with Acosta as
"a real pleasure."
"Alan ... is by far the most in
volved RF I've ever seen at Stan
ford." Lipson said.
Lipson also praised Acosta's in
volvement with the Chicano / Lati
no community toward which Zapa
ta is geared.
"He is very active in the Chicano
/ Latino community as an RF and
extremely supportive ... in foster
ing a supportive academic, cultural
and social community," he said.
Acosta said he feels that his role
as an RF is one of his most impor
tant responsibilities on campus.
"I really treasure that role be
cause it allows me to go home each
night and remember a lot of the
reason why I'm doing my job: the
students," he said.
" Teaching, learning, education,
students, faculty: those are the
things that really matter here.
[Being an RF] keeps you on track,"
he added.
