water polo team (6-0) would con
tend for a national championship,
they were answered this weekend.

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford takes
first place at the Southern California
Tourney.
Head coach Dante Dettamanti
described the tournament, which in
cluded each of the nation's top 10
teams, as the season's first true lest.
The Cardinal's performance would
show whether this year's squad
would be able to replace the scoring
power of the five seniors from the
1998 squad and whether redshirt
freshman Nick Ellis would be able
to fill the hole left in goal by depart
ed Ail-American Chris Aguilera.
The Cardinal team passed this
test with flying colors.
Dettamanti described it quite
simply as "a super weekend." Det
tamanti received contributions
from all the players on the deep
squad and emphasized that "every
single guy came through with great
plays." The four wins were "truly a
team effort."
Stanford opened play on Satur
day against Long Beach State. The
Cardinal earned an 8-6 victory,
which was not as close as the score
njight suggest — the score was 8-4
until Long Beach scored a two-point
goal late in the game. Freshman Jeff
Nesmith scored three goals, while
redshirt sophomore Todd Snider
and senior Jonathan Skaalen each
added two points for Stanford.
Goalie Nick Ellis had 12 saves.
In the afternoon, Stanford took
on UC-San Diego. With the help of

three goals from redshirt senior
Brian Heifferon, Stanford over
came the l ritons 7-5. Ellis again
played well in the goal, racking up
10 saves.
The two victories earned the
Cardinal a spot in Sunday's semifi
nal against No. 3 UCLA. While Det
tamanti thought that Saturday's
games were "a little closer than they
should have been." Stanford "really
turned it on against UCLA." The
C ardinal led by three goals several
times and finished the game with a
9-7 victory. Mark Amott led Stan
lord with two key goals from the
hole position.
Stanford's victory over the Bru
ins put the Cardinal into the cham
pionship match against top-ranked
USC. setting up a rematch of the
1998 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration and NCAA Championship
games. Both of those games went
into overtime, with Stanford win
ning the MPSF title and USC taking
the NCAA crown. Following tradi
tion. Sunday's game at the Trojan's
home pool went into double over
time. Avenging their NCAA loss,
Stanford emerged victorious with
an 11-10 win.
USC scored the game's first goal,
but the Cardinal answered and
never trailed again in regulation.
After a two-pointer by Heifferon
with less than five minutes to go,
Stanford took a 9-6 lead. But USC
stormed back with a score by Peter
Janov in a man-up situation, anoth
er by George Csaszar on the coun
terattack and a final penalty shot by
Ivan Babic to send the game into
overtime.
In the first overtime, the Trojans
took the lead first. But freshman
Jeff Nesmith quickly answered with
a 6-on-5 goal. Later in the first over
time, a USC player was ejected. On
his way to the penalty area and while
Cardinal senior Andy Walburger
was taking a shot on goal, the eject
ed player pulled the goal down,
causing the referee to award the
Cardinal a penalty shot. Heifferon
completed the penalty shot, giving
Stanford the 11-10 lead.

In the second overtime, goalie
Nick Ellis came up with a huge
block against ( sas/ar. Neither team
was able to score in this period, and
Stanford came away the winner.
Four Stanford players were
named to the all-Tournament team,
with Heifferon. Walburger. and
Ellis garnering first-team honors
and Amott making the second team.
Ellis also earned MPSF Player of
the Week accolades lor his perfor
mance.
Had there been a tournament
MVP award. Dettamanti felt it

would have gone to I leifferon. who
played almost every minute of all
four games. Dettamanti said that
"every part of his game was going"
and"the only thing Brian didn't do
was get in the goal and block the
ball."
Dettamanti was also impressed
with the play of two-meter men
Amott and freshman Peter 1 ludnut.
who saw increased time this week
end due to the illness of senior
starter Mike Lipinski. Dettamanti
also praised the two-meter defense
of senior John Skaalen and redshirt

sophomore Pasi Dutton. Skaalen
and Dutton shut down UCLA hole
man Sean Kern, who is training with
the Olympic team, and USC's two
meter man James Castle. He also
noted the play of Nesmith, who was
inserted in specific situations and
almost always came away with a
goal.
But Dettamanti emphasized
once again that it was a total team
effort that did it for the Cardinal
this weekend. He was especially
pleased to see the squad emerge un
defeated. since the team with the

least losses earns an automatic hid
to the NCAA tournament at the
end of the season. He also noted
that of the last 16 winners of the
Southern California tournament.
11 have gone on to win an NCAA
championship.
"While we have a long way to go.
this is a great way to start the sea
son," Dettamanti said.
Stanford begins MPSF competi
tion this weekend with games at
deGuerre pool against UCLA and
UC-Irvine at noon on Saturday and
Sunday, respectively.
