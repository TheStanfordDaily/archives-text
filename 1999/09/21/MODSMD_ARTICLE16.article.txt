Not only did the international
games expose the team to a compet
itive level of competition, hut it also
introduced the men to a different
style of soccer.
"It puts things in perspective
knowing that we can compete with
them" said sophomore defender
Travis James. "It is going to boost
our confidence."
"Our trip to Scotland gave us the
opportunity to do some fine tuning,"
Clark said.
Unfortunately, the freshmen did
not make the trip to Scotland, but
now that the season is underway the
team has finally had a chance to
come together.

record of 2-1 -1. bowing only to Gon

Coach Clark's philosophy is
echoed by his players who realize
