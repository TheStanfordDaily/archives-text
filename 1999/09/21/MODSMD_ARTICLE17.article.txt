MEN S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Saturday: Stanford takes first at
BYU Triple Crown Invitational.
The course — designed to allow
spectators to see the entire race —
had a non-traditional format consist
ing of a one-mile loop that the ath
letes repeated four times.
"The meet at BYU offered an ex
citing new format for our sport. I felt
it was important for our program to
support an effort to market cross
country to the spectators." head
coach Vin Lananna said.
The team was originally sched
uled to compete at the Fresno Invita
tional. but the meet at BYU was cho
sen for this unique set-up. And the
Cardinal squad ran the new course
with a vengeance.
This weekend, the team proved
their ability to run well as a pack.
"(Redshirt sophomore) Ciabe
Jennings. |senior| Jake Maas. and
[redshirt junior] Thomas Murley
demonstrated great leadership and
controlled the race," Lananna said.
Finishing within split-seconds of
each other. Jennings. Murley and
Moss swept the top three places in
Saturday's race. Jennings Uxik first.

posting a time of 19:51.9, followed
closely by Murley in second at
19:52.3 and Maas in third, with
19:52.8.
But Stanford's seasoned veterans
weren't the only ones to turn out im
pressive performances. The Cardi
nal's new recruits also made a big im
pression.
The legacy of "the machine," as
the team as been dubbed, with its
back-to-back national titles in 1996
and 1997, three consecutive Pacific
10 conference titles and last year's
second-place NCAA finish sets a
tough precedent for incoming fresh
men But so far they seem to be living
up to all the expectations.
From the outset of the season, the
Cardinal has held high expectations
for outstanding results from its
young and inexperienced, but ex
tremely talented, group of runners.
I his weekend, some of the new faces
on the Stanford squad showed that
they have what it takes to uphold the
Cardinal cross-country legacy of ex
cellence.
Proving that experience is not
everything, freshman Andy Powell
stayed right on the tail of Maas. run
ning 19:53.2 to take fourth place.
Another freshman. Seth Hejny. cap
tured eighth in 20:03.9.
"I was very excited by the racing
of freshmen Andy Powell and Seth
Hejny." Lananna said. "These new
faces in our lineup are performing
well."
Sophomore Joe I 'rbanski had an
other outstanding performance,
coming in sixth in 19:58.3 and com
pleting the five-man pack who post
ed points for the Cardinal.
"We approached the meet with
the goal of assessing where we are
right now. We were not very con
cerned about the final outcome of

the race." Lananna said.
The men all came in with just frac
tions of seconds separating their
times, demonstrating the amazing
pack running and small time gap that
can be so important a successful
team.
"We concentrated on running as a
pack and controlling the race. I was
pleased with how well our athletes
accomplished these goals," Lananna
said.
With Stanford taking the first
spot, followed by BYU, the top four
teams were rounded out by Weber
State following closely with 64 points
and Idaho State with 98.
"Although the field was small, the
competition was solid in the top
places," Lananna said.
Great things are expected of the
squad this year, and the first two
showings this season have lived up to
those high expectations.
Stanford opened its season with a
victory in the fourth-annual Nevada
Wolfpack Invitational on Sept. 4.
Demonstrating its ability to run well
as a pack, the Cardinal swept the top
six places.
The two early wins have set the
tone for the powerhouse squad this
season. If it can continue to perform
at this level, the Cardinal stands a
good chance of recapturing the
NCAA title which it held in 1996 and
'97.
"It is difficult to forecast what this
meet will mean for the rest of the sea
son since it was a shorter course and
at [a high| altitude. However, 1 do
think that this meet demonstrated
that we can race well together and
that our athletes are fit," Lananna
said.
Stanford came into the race
ranked second in the nation in a pre
season poll based on votes from
members of the United States Cross
Country Coaches Association.
With 384 points, the Cardinal
trail behind only defending NCAA
champion Arkansas, who garnered
394 points. The top five were round-

Ed out by Colorado, North Carolina
State and Wisconsin.
Four Pac-10 teams are ranked in
the preseason Top 25 — No. 8 Ari
zona, No. 9 Oregon and No. 21 Ari
zona State.
"The national ranking doesn't
mean too much right now," Lananna
said. "We're concentrating on hit
ting our best performances at the
Pac-10 Championships and the
NCAA championships."
