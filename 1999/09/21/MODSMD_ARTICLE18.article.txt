Led hy junior stand-out Julia
Stamps, the Cardinal took advan
tage of strong performances from a
talented freshman crew to upset
early-season favorite and consis
tent rival No. I Brigham Young at
Saturday's Triple Crown Invita
tional in Provo, Utah.
The Cardinal topped the solid,
six-team field, which included
three top-15 programs, with 31
points, edging second-place BYU

ed States National Team, ran the
three-mile course in 16:48.4, nar
rowly beating freshman teammate
Lauren Fleshman. Fleshman. a
1998 Foot Locker runner-up from
Canyon Country, California, had a
breakthrough early-season perfor
mance at 16:48.7.
A tight pack of four Cougar run
ners followed, led by Sharolyn
Shields, who finished in 17:01.1.
Shields was joined by teammates
Laura lleiner (17:02.8), Elizabeth
Jackson (17:05.0), and Kara Or
mond (17:12.3).
I iowever, the Cardinal was able
to edge out the Cougars by placing
three runners ahead of BYU's fifth
finisher. Freshman Mariel Et
tinger, the 1998 Oregon 4A cross
country champion from LaGrande,
Oregon, had a strong race as the
third runner to finish for the Cardi

finished 19th.
Freshman Erin Sullivan, one of
the nation's top recruits and a two
time Footlocker champion from
Jericho, Vermont, did not compete

but her anticipated debut for the
Cardinal should add talent and in
ternational experience to the al
ready-deep Stanford squad.
The Cardinal victory follows a
big win at last Saturday's Nevada
Wolfpack Cross Country Invita
tional. Turner and Annis paced
Stanford with top-five finishes.
Turner ran 18:47 over the 5.000
meter course, and finished as run
ner-up to Cal's Christy Villa

Cougars edged the Stanford team
by one point to capture the silver

trophy, behind Villanova. Both
Stanford and BYU have been in
