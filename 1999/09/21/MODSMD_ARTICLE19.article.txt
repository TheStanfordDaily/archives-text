WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: Stanford (5-1, 2-0 Pacific
10 Conference) at California (4-3, 1-
1). 7 p.m.
After opening its Pac-10 season
by sweeping both Washington and
Washington State in three games
last week, the powerhouse Stanford
squad is ready to take tin its Bay
Area rival in the Cardinal's third
conference matchup.
Last season, Stanford opened
conference play with a decisive
three-game sweep to defeat the Cal
squad on its home turf. The Golden
Bears will be out to avenge that 15-
5.15-6,15-3 loss, and with the return
of senior Brook Coulter and sopho
more-standout Candace McNamee
Cal's chances have improved. The
Bears also won their first Pac-10
opener since 1992 this season with a

victory over Washington State last
week.
But Stanford's formidible squad
of seasoned veterans and fresh new
talent isn't about to let Cal get in the
way of its bid for a Pac-10 title.
In last week's games, the Cardi
nal saw outstanding play from the
entire squad. But leading the way
was Logan Tom, the highly-touted
freshman from Salt Lake City. Tom
led the squad with 16 kills in each of
Stanford's matches against the
Huskies and the Cougars.
Although Tom has already
shown herself to be a major force to
be reckoned with this season, Stan
ford still relies on the solid play of its
senior players to anchor the team.
Senior Kerri Walsh — a three
time Ail-American outside hitter —
posted IK kills and 22 digs on the two
matches while playing middle block
er for the first time in her collegiate
career.
Senior outside hitter Sarah Clark
recorded an impressive 25 kills and
22 digs, including a season-high 16
kills against Washington.
It is the integration of old and
new talent on the squad that has al
ways made Stanford the ultimate
women's volleyball powerhouse.
And tonight, the Cardinal looks to
take another step towards securing
the 1999 Pac-10 title.
