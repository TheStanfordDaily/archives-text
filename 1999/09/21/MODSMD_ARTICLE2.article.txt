# Draft aims to ease crunch
## Land Use proposal ups housing options 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Up to 2.8(H) housing units could be
created in the next 10 years, accord
ing to the latest draft of Stanford's
development plan.
The draft, which was submitted to
county officials yesterday, calls for
the creation of up to 2,(XX) units of
housing for single students. The ma
jority of units would be for graduate
students.
Undergraduates, medical resi
dents. post-doctoral fellows, faculty
and stall' would also benefit from up
to 780 new units of housing.
The large amount of housing dif
ferentiates this plan from previous
ones, said Larry Horton, director of
government and community rela
tions for Stanford.
"This is an ambitious housing pro
gram. but it is quite badly needed."
Horton said. "Over I.(KX) graduate
students are not housed in the Draw,
and we now house about 50 percent
of graduate students. Under this plan
we could house 70 percent."
The draft of the development
plan is also the first in which housing
and academic space do not both fall
under a square footage cap. In previ
ous years Stanford faced a cap on the
amount of square footage it could
build. This zero sum situation forced

the University to choose between
new housing or new academic build
ings.
i think [the separation of hous
ing and academic footage] is a good
thing," said Sally Probst, president of
the Palo Alto League of Women
Voters."I know Stanford built more
housing than they had originally
planned, and there was even a point
where Stanford was deciding to use
square footing for housing or for aca
demics."
Chris Stromberg, a chemistry
graduate student, and a member of
the graduate student council, agreed.
"Stanford had to make a trade-off
between academic building and
housing. It was an artificial trade-off.
Housing is an immediate need, yet
without academic space Stanford
cannot function as a university," he
said.
Horton said that the creation of
new housing units is important for
the recruitment of staff and graduate
students.
"If we are not able to build hous
es, we may have more difficulty in re
cruiting," Horton said.
Stromberg also said that graduate
housing is a key to successful recruit
ment. "Even international students
have heard how bad the housing
