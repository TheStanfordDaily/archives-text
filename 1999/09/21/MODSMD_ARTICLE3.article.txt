After guiding Stanford students
through freshman roommate as
signments and the Draw process,
Kathleen Bransfield is shifting her
focus to younger students.
Bransfield. manager of Housing
Assignment Services, will be leav
ing her position in January to pur
sue a new challenge: teaching and
formulating policy for elementary
school students.
Bransfield said it was her volun
teer work in the classroom that led
her to decide to leave Stanford.
"Through some very active in
volvement in my son's grade
school. I've developed a passion
for children's education," Brans
field said. "I volunteered, and on
[those] mornings I said, 'Gee, I re
ally want to stay.'"
Bransfield said she would like to
promote technology in education.
She would also like to foster part
nerships between people in the
community, including those with
out school-age children, and the
school system.
"I want to create an environ
ment in whieh education is the re
sponsibility of the entire communi
ty." she said.
Bransfield said her familiarity
with technology comes from her
former job working at Apple com
puter's media lab, as well as her
work with the spring housing lot
tery.
After working at Apple. Brans
field came to Stanford in 199<) as
operations manager of Housing
and Dining's summer conference
program. She has held her current
position of manager since January
1997.
In her current position Brans
field is responsible for assigning all
on-campus housing, off-campus

subsidized housing for graduate
students and supervising the New
Undergraduate Student Informa

Associate Director of Student
Housing Roger Whitney, who held
Bransfield's position prior to her
promotion, said the manager of
housing has a very difficult job.
"It's a very complicated system
that you're trying to provide policy
support for," said Whitney.
Bransfield said one of the most
interesting aspects of her job is the
Draw process.
"Technology is amazing! It's in
conceivable to me how we could do
Draw without it," she said. "In
May 1997. I realized we had as
signed more people than the num
ber who live in my hometown."
According to Bransfield, anoth
er challenge for her replacement
will be to resolve the graduate stu
dent housing crunch.
"Graduate housing will be a big
part of the new job," she said.
Construction has begun on
three buildings intended for gradu
ate student use, Bransfield said.
Two of them are scheduled to be
ready for occupancy next Septem
ber.
Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya, who has
worked extensively with Brans
field in the past two years,
expressed regret at Bransfield's
decision to leave her position.
"If it weren't for the fact that
her dreams to teach were so noble.
I would do everything in my power
to keep her at Stanford." Montoya
said. "I love to watch her mind at
work."
According to Keith Guy, direc

Bransfield's supervisor, her posi
