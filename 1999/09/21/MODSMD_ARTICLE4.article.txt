# Shak party delayed indefinitely

### Meredith Rowe Editorial staff 
"Man: 1. Band:o," read fliers post
ed yesterday cancelling the Stanford
Band's notorious Orientation tradi
tion of the Sliak party.
For the past several days, multi
colored fliers announcing the year's
first Band party covered every possi
ble surface: bathroom stalls, bulletin
boards and hallway walls. The ads
promised a live band and. of course.

general merriment.
The IIWNl l WN- l W Tree, senior Chris
Henderson, said the Office of Stu
dent Activities, including Assistant
Director and Director of Student Ac
tivities Nanci I lowe and Associate
Dean of Students Morris Graves, met
at noon yesterday with band mem
bers.
"They called a meeting to notify
the band manager and assistant man
ager that the party would not be ill
lowed." I ienderson said.

Graves cited the location of the
party, which would have been partial
ly held in the grass area outside Ford
Recreational Center, as one of the
administration's main concerns.
"We were worried about the use
and possible misuse of alcohol at an
outdoor event,"he said. "So. it has
been postponed for at least two
weeks."
The location is of more concern
this year than in the past because the
Hand no longer has a 'Shak" as of last

December, so the event would have
been held almost entirely outside.
"It's particularly problematic with
an outdoor event with alcohol,"
Howe said. "It's more difficult to con
trol the drinking/'
Henderson said this announce
ment came as a great surprise to the
Band, as members thought the party
had already been at least unofficially
approved in a conversation with
Howe.
"One of the social chairs spoke
with Nanci Howe last week and told
her we wanted to have the party
Monday," he said. "Nanci said we'd
need to get security."
"Nanci asked [the social chair] if
we'd have alcohol. We said yes. She
just said we'd need to have security
there. We took this to mean that it
was going to be okay to have the
party."
Howe responded by saying that
she felt the expectations were "emi
nently clear" and that there was
"clearly miscommunication. particu
larly within the Band itself."
Henderson said problems that oc
curred at last fall's Band Shak party
were probably the main cause for
concern among administrators.
"A year ago at the Shak party,
there was a 17-year-old who got too
drunk and needed to be hospital
ized," he said. "This caused a prob
lem. The administration told us we
would not be allowed to have the
Shak party all this orientation week
until [today].
"We met with them again later,
though, and asked if we could have a
party if we notified them and the po
lice more than one week ahead of the
Shak party," he added. "They said
okay. But 1 guess [having the party
today or laterj was still in the back of
everyone's mind."
Stanford police and the adminis
tration were notified of the party on
Sept. 16, four days before the pro
posed party. Graves said that wasn't
early enough.
"Events like this require a mini
mum of a two-week advance notice,"
he said. "By the Band's own policies,

they agreed on a minimum of a one
week advance notice, and that wasn't
even followed."
Band members said, however,
that they are still confused about the
reasons behind the postponement.
"The Band believed that the more
informal conversation with Nanci
Howe implied that everything was
okay with the party," Henderson
said.
Graves said this wasn't the case.
"After a (party) proposal is sub
mitted to Howe, she forwards copies
to the fire marshal and the police," he
said. "Only then is a meeting con
vened where they work out details,
and only then is space allocated. That
didn't happen in this case."
Graves added that the party's pur
pose concerned the administration.
"This is an event primarily used as
a recruiting tool for frosh to join the
Band," he said. "When the major
draw becomes alcohol, that raises our
eyebrows. Anything that involves the
possible endangerment of a student is
going to get our attention."
Since last spring. Graves contin
ued, the administration has been
meeting with the Band "because of
some incidents associated with
events the band has sponsored."
The Band was asked in the spring
to do two things: revise their constitu
tion and put together a party-plan
ning procedure.
At least the latter of these terms
was met. Graves said, and the OSA
gave "tentative approval."
The party-planning procedures
drawn up by the Band included sev
eral bullets of policy: that the police
and the OSA would be notified a
week in advance of a party and that
any advertisements for a party would
include the statement, "21 to drink,
SIJID to enter."
"We were notified Thursday

evening at the earliest," Graves said.
"And the only flier for the party that
I've seen read 'Sex, Drugs, and Rock
& Roll.' Alcohol should never be the
focal point of a planned event."
Graves said that he empathized
with Band members who were frus
trated at the party's postponement.
"The officers of the Band knew
this last spring," he said. "The ques
tion is, did they convey those con
cerns to new officers? And did the
new officers understand the serious
ness of these concerns? I have sym
pathy for new officers that have been
somewhat taken aback."
Sophomore Christine Chen, who
attended last fall's Band Shak party,
said she was disappointed she
wouldn't be able to enjoy the same
event during Orientation this year.
"It was pretty fun and crazy last
year," she said. "I heard [yesterday]
that it was canceled, and I'm not real
ly sure why. I was Uxiking forward to
it and planning on going."
Chen, an orientation volunteer,
added that she thought this year's
freshmen would be "missing out on a
great tradition."
As for rescheduling the party,
plans are still up in the air.
Graves said that as soon as the
Band "follows proper procedures,"
the party can be discussed once more.
He emphasized that the University
administration was not trying to pre
vent students from having fun.
"We're not here to be road
blocks," he said. "We don't want to
interfere with students having a good
time. That's not why we're here."
Henderson maintained that the
Band wouldn't give up.
" Wc would very much like to have
the party at some point," he said. "I
don't know if this is possible. But
we're trying our very best to hold it at
some point in the near future."
