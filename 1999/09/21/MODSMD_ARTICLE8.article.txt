## Post-Floyd floods create health risks 
### 
TARBORO, N.C. (AP) - Rotting livestock carcasses and floating
sewage created a mounting public health threat Monday across eastern
North Carolina, still flooded days after Hurricane Floyd forced tens of
thousands of people from their homes.
At least 35 people were confirmed dead in North Carolina. The
death toll was expected to climb, but of greatest concern was the
health of those who survived.
"There are a large number of different risks out there right now," said
Johanna Reese of the state Division of Environmental Health. "The
most immediate one we have is lack of safe drinking water."
Disease has become a growing threat because of the hundreds of
thousands of dead hogs, chickens and turkeys laying about the state.
Drinking water has been tainted by overflow from sewage plants and
animal waste lagoons. Floodwaters are fouled by fuel, farm chemicals
and manure.
National Guard helicopters and trucks delivered clean drinking water
to several counties. State officials have asked for more incinerators to
deal with an estimated 100,000 hogs, 2.4 million chickens and 500,000
turkeys killed.
On top of that, health officials warned that mosquitoes will be out in
force because of all the standing water and could spread deadly
encephalitis. And when that water recedes, the death toll may rise.
"As the waters go down, we certainly do expect there will be more
individuals found," said Dr. John Butts, state medical examiner.

The Waccamaw River rose to cover homes and roads in the Ash
community of Brunswick County, N.C., on September 19. The
area is being evacuated due to floods in the aftermath of Hurri
cane Floyd.
