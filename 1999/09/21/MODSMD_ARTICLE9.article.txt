# 7.6 earthquake rocks Taiwan
## 60 dead, hundreds injured 
### 
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Taiwan's
strongest quake in decades struck
before dawn Tuesday, wrecking a
12-story hotel in Taipei and shaking
millions out of their beds. A govern
ment report said at least 60 people
were killed and hundreds more
injured.
The quake had a preliminary
magnitude of 7.6 and was centered
90 miles south-southwest of Taipei,
the U.S. Geological Survey's Nation
al Earthquake Information Center
said. The USGS issued warnings of
possible tsunamis, or huge waves
that sometimes follow earthquakes.
The temblor was about the same
strength as the devastating one that
struck Turkey Aug. 17, killing more
than 15,000 people.
In Taipei, the island nation's cap
ital, the quake wrecked the 78-room
Sungshan Hotel in Taipei, collapsing
the bottom stories and setting the
badly damaged top listing to one
side.
Fire crews turned hoses on the
collapsed hotel as smoke poured
from fires raging in several destroyed
rooms. Sixty people were still feared
trapped in the building, with 49 peo
ple already evacuated and sent to
hospital and another 11 people evac
uated uninjured.
A woman pulled from the wreck
age urged rescuers to look for more
injured.
"Hurry, go rescue people.
They're in there. They're inside,"
said the unidentified woman, who
did not appear to be injured.
"I lived on the ninth floor, but
now it's the fourth floor," the woman
said.

Taiwan Television showed col
lapsed four-story residential build
ings in the central city of Taichung,
but gave no figures for dead or
injured. Water poured from rup
tured mains and distraught residents
squatted with their heads in their
hands as rescuers helped apparently
unhurt survivors from the building.
Severe damage was reported in
the town of Puli near the quake epi
center, but details were sketchy. An
explosion was reported at the town's
major business, a rice wine distillery,
and scores of buildings had suffered
damage, the Broadcasting Corpora
tion of China said. No casualty fig
ures were immediately available.
The Interior Ministry's disaster
management center reported 60
dead and 355 injured islandwide.
Another 277 people were reported
trapped under the rubble.
Monday's quake was Taiwan's
worst since a 7.4 magnitude temblor
hit the island in 1935, killing 3,276
people. Taiwan is hit by dozens of
quakes each year, but most strike in
the Pacific Ocean east of the island
and rarely cause damage.
The quake hit at about 1:45 a.m.,
while most of Taiwan's 22 million
people were sleeping. It knocked out
electric service throughout the
northern part of the island. State
radio said the initial quake was fol
lowed by six aftershocks.
After the temblor, people made
their way into the streets from dam
aged buildings, some wearing only
underwear, some in nightclothes.
Some appeared dazed, but others
quickly recovered from the sudden
awakening.

Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne,
who is visiting Taipei as part of a
two-week Asian trade mission, said
he was sleeping in a top-floor room
in the 25-story Grant Hyatt Regency
in Taipei when the earthquake hit.
Kempthorne said the quake

began as a gentle swaying, "and then
it increased in intensity until you
were virtually thrown from the bed."
The USGS said the quake
prompted tsunami warnings for Tai
wan, Japan, the Philippines, Yap,
Guam, and Palau.
