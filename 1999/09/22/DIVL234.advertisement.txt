Leading faculty, provocative discussions, —
and a fascinating way to fulfill your
world cultures DR. Three new courses for
freshmen, sophomores, and beyond,
exploring the history, literature, art and cinema,
and contemporary societies of East Asia.
"Roots of Modern East Asia"
(History 92A, Fall, 5 credits, Kahn and Lockyer)
Until the end of the 18th century. East Asia
comprised the most populous, urbanized,
economically advanced, and culturally
sophisticated societies in the world. This course
focuses on China, Korea, and Japan in the last
great age before modern times, the 17th through
the early 19th centuries. We will use fiction,
poetry, art, films, and history in order to
understand this complex region on its own terms.
