## Editorial A 						case of poor judgment 
### 
Sawislak was wrong
in further publicizing
her concerns about
tenure

IN THE SEPT. 17 issue of The
Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion, former Asst. History
Prof. Karen Sawislak wrote an
op-ed piece in which she criti
cized Stanford's tenure process —
in particular, the way in which
Stanford handled her hid for
tenure.
In the wake of the amount of
journalistic attention Sawislak's
case has received since she was
originally denied tenure, her deci
sion to rehash her grievances in
The Chronicle was poor judge
ment on her part; The Chronicle
was not the appropriate forum for
her criticism.
Sawislak was denied tenure in
the spring of 1c)97l c )97 and then
appealed over a series of prob
lems in her tenure process.
Though a faculty advisory hoard
recommended to President
Casper in January that he grant
Sawislak tenure outright, he
decided to offer her the opportu
nity to return to her post and
reapply for tenure. She opted not
to accept his offer.
Instead, Sawislak announced in
May that she was not going to
return. She is currently enrolled
in the law school at UC-Berkeley.
Sawislak, along with other
members of the Stanford faculty,
is part of a group complaint to the
Office of Federal Contract Com
pliance Programs, a division of
the U.S. Department of Labor,

alleging systematic gender dis
crimination by Stanford in hiring
and promotion. She has also filed
an individual complaint with the
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
Both of these investigations are
ongoing, however, and therefore
no official decision has been
made about whether or not the
University's tenure process is
unfair.
Sawislak has cut all ties with
the University and has already
gone through the official legal
channels to lodge her complaint
against it. In light of this, her
motive or motives in publishing
the article in a paper with a circu
lation of over 400,000 among col
lege administrators and faculty
are unclear.
If a decision can be made on
this issue, it should be left to the
people who are investigating the
case, not to the people who read
The Chronicle.
Ihe investigators will have
information about the tenure pro
cess at Stanford that the readers
of The Chronicle were not pre
sented with.
Sawislak left the University no
opportunity to respond to her
piece within the same issue of The
Chronicle in which it appeared.
There are also no specifics given
on other tenure cases at Stanford,
and thus readers of the paper are
left with a biased view of the
tenure process at the University.
Karen Sawislak had already
voiced her concern about tenure
at Stanford to the proper chan
nels, and she should have waited
for their judgement before
furthur publicizing her plight.
