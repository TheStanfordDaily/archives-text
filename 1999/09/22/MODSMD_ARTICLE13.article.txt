## Big wheels keep on turning: Cyclist claims title Med student Megan Troxell wins second national championship 
### Travis Neal Editorial staff 
Every day you turn to the sports pages to read
about another Stanford athlete who has won yet
another national championship, helping their
team to the title, all while balancing school and a
perfect social life.
Few of those have balanced medical school too,
honing their skills in a sport that most students
know nothing about.
Megan Troxell has done just this, dominating
the collegiate cycling world for the past two years,
propelling herself and her teammates to so many
medals that it would take both hands and feet to
count them all.
From Sept. 9-11, Troxell ended her collegiate
track cycling career at the National Collegiate
Track Cycling Championships by winning the
women's overall title for a second consecutive
year.
For the uninitiated, there are four events that
go into winning the overall tittle: the two-kilome
ter standing start time trial ( IT), the 26-kilometer
women's point race, the 500-meter IT and the
match sprints. A rider need only race in three
events.
Troxell's first and best event was the two-kilo
meter IT. where she took first place by 10 seconds,
beating Canadian national team member
Stephanie Hannos, 2:33.9 to 2:43.3.
In the women's points race, Troxell was not as
dominant, falling to Hannos. Troxell spent the sec
ond half of the race supporting her teammate Erin
Kassoy, in her effort to place third. Troxell was
successutl in this aspect, helping Kassoy to All-
American status.
In Troxell's weakest event, the 500-meter TT,

she perservered, finishing second. She was behind
Missy Thompson of University of Colorado at
Colorado Springs, hut as Thompson is a US Na
tional team member who specializes in the S(X). the
runner-up spot was no small feat.
The second-place finish was the final nail in the
coffin of 1 lannos, as she only managed a fifth place
in the match sprints that happened on the final day
of competition.
While taking over the women's events, Troxell
also matched the times of her male teammates in
the Men and Women Italian Pursuit team which
placed third, and raced as part of the men's four
kilometer Pursuit team which placed fourth.
In the Italian Pursuit. Troxell's speed was in
strumental in providing Stanford's men a lead
after the two initial woman-led laps.
Her lap split of 22.1K4 seconds was faster than
all but one of her four male teammates in their sub
sequent laps at the front.
In the team pursuit, Troxell blended in remark
ably well with her 3 male teammates, the principal
objection being that her low aerodynamic position
on the bike didn't afford much draft for the rider
immediately behind her. While the team placed
fourth with time's not up to par with other men's
squads, the performance was a marked improve
ment over last years team.
Since 1994, Troxell has won eight individual
and team national titles on the track, five on the
road and countless medals in both disciplines.
In 1996, 1998 and 1999, Troxell was an Ail-
American in both road and track, amassing a total
of six nominations. Even with her medical school
studies. Troxell has not stopped at the collegiate
level, excelling in amateur racing as well.
In 1998. her final ranking among U.S. Track
Endurance women was fourth, and in 1999. Trox

ell finished second in the standings, immediately
behind the Pan American games gold medalist.
Troxell was also recently named to USA's long
team for the 1999 World Championships of track
cycling. She has a chance to make the short team
that will travel to Berlin, but this will not only de
pend on whether she is able to withdraw from her
current clinical rotation to attend a training/final
selection camp at Colorado Springs, it will require
her to beat out at least one or two other riders.
While accomplishing more and more on the
track, Troxell has been making her way through a
grueling medical school schedule. Unlike a normal
class schedule, being on clinical rotation leaves
Troxell's time up in the air, constantly leaving her
uncertain of when she will be able to train next.
"My hat's off to her, for patient care you can't
organize your schedule, and yet Megan has con
tinued to improve," said teammate Cynthia Fer
guson.
Compunded with her grueling schedule was a
two and a half year lay off forced when lab funding
issues required Troxell to move her cellular physi
ology research to Indianapolis. When she came
back in early 1998. though, she was ready to race,
her performances seemingly never to suffer.
"This consistency has gained her the most ex
tensive palmares in the history of Stanford Cy
cling," said coach Art Walker.
Troxell began her Stanford career in 1994, a
year that saw one of the strongest rookie teams in
Stanford history.
Under the supervision of the more senior rid
ers, Troxell bloomed, coming into her own when
she discovered track racing. This became her true
love, and with it as a backbone she began to im
prove on the road as well, quickly moving into the
forefront of women's collegiate cycling.
