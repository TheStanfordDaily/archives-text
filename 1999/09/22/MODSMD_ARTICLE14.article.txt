## 
### Ben Jones Editorial staff 
There is no doubt that Stanford has become a premi
um venue for international sporting events. From the
Super Bowl in 1989 to the World Cup in 1994. the playing
fields have seen elite competition in a number of sports.
This year has been a banner year in that storied tradi
tion as Stanford hosted both the semifinal match of the
Women's World Cup and the Bank of the West Classic
professional women's tennis tournament in July and the
finals of the Federation Cup on Sept. 18-19.
The Fed Cup finals were no different from the excite
ment of the other events as a star-studded U.S. team,
dubbed the "dream team" of women's tennis, defeated
the Russian squad to bring home the title in this year-long
international tennis series.
In Sunday's first singles match. American Lindsay
Davenport, ranked second in the world, defeated Flena
Likhovtseva 6-4,6-4 to clinch the title for the U.S.
"To win for your country and to have a really great
team to play just means a lot," Davenport said. "It's a
shame that it doesn't get as much coverage as other
sports, but it's still a great honor to have this title for our
selves and for Billie [Jean King, the American captain]."
The win surprised few though, as the American squad,
comprised of Davenport, No. 3 Venus Williams. No. 4
Serena Williams and No. 5 Monica Seles, looked on
paper to be far superior to the Russian team.
The Russian were forced to play without star Anna
Kournikova, and the "troika of Elcnas", Likhovtseva.
Dementieva and Makarova proved to be of little obstacle

for the U.S. squad.
Russia, socking its first Fed Cup title in 22 years, de
spite being a three-time finalist, couldn't overcome the
power play of Davenport and the Williams sisters. So
dominant was the American squad that Seles, a nine
time Grand Slam winner, was not even called up to play.
"They are very good," Likhtovtseva said of the Amer
icans. "They can beat anyone, any team 5-/.ip. We can't
borrow players from them right?"
Unfortunately for the Russians, they could not swap
players with the U.S. team, which jumped out to a 2-0
lead on Saturday as Davenport dismissed Dementieva 6-
4, 6-0 and Venus Williams polished off Likhovtseva 6-3,
6-4.
Appearing for the first time since sweeping the singles
and doubles titles at the U.S. Open, Serena Williams
teamed with sister Venus to eliminate Makarova and De
mentieva 6-2,6-1 in the tie's only doubles matchup.
The only setback the U.S. team suffered was Venus
Williams' singles loss to the 6<Xth-ranked Dementieva in
a match played after the Americans had claimed the
crown.
Venus Williams, experimenting with a serve-and-vol
ley style which is a departure from her usually powerful
baseline game, managed to land just 55 percent of her
first serves and committed 40 unforced errors in the 1-6,
6-3,7-6 (7-5) loss.
Venus Williams, who controlled the first set, squan
dered a match point in the third and dropped the mean
ingless match to her pony-tailed opponent, making her

Fed Cup dehut.
The U.S. victory eased some of
the pain of last year's 3-2 semifinal
loss to Spain.
"It's never erased, but it certain
ly softens the blow." said King. 'It's
good to remember that one be
cause it keeps us hungry and striv
ing forward. It's great that we
brought the l ed Cup back to the
United States."
