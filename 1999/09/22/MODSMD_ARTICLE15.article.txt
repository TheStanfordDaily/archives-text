# Cal edges Cardinal in overtime
## Field hockey squad falls in extra session after scoreless tie 
### Emily Cadei 
Fall quarter may just be starting,
but one Stanford tradition is already
in high gear. As chants of "Cal
sucks!" filled the air on Sunday at
Stanford's Varsity Turf Field in sup
port of the women's field hockey
team, it was hard not to feel the ex
citement of yet another gripping Cal-
Stanford rivalry.
No matter where or when they
meet, the competing factions always
seems to promote a raucous atmos
phere and Sunday was no exception.
A large Berkeley section cheered
loudly for its team throughout the
game, but were more or less outdone
in the second half by Cardinal sup
porters (including a small but loud
contingent of swim-team members)
trying to establish a sense of Stanford
pride on the home field.
The intensity off the field mir
rored that on it. as the two teams bat
tle fairly evenly throughout the
match, with the game being decided
in penalty strokes. Cal emerged victo
rious with a 3-1 advantage in this
phase after 100 scoreless minutes, in

eluding 70 minutes of regulation and
30 minutes of overtime. However.the
Cardinal team members are not
about to concede the Northern Pacif
ic Conference title to its bitter rivals
anytime soon.
What looked to be another in
tense struggle between two teams
who have combined to win the Nor-
Pac title every year of the 1990's
proved to be exactly that.
A nonconference match, both Cal
(6-2, 4-0 NorPac) and Stanford (3-5,
2-0 NorPac). the only two undefeated
teams in league play, came into the
game in search of bragging rights. Al
though Cal walked away with the vic
tory. it does not count in league stand
ings, and closeness of the game
proved more than anything that ci
ther team has the potential to claim
the championship.
In the first half, both teams came
out hard, the intensity and competi
tiveness of the match manifested in
quick, aggressive play by both sides.
While Cal dominated the first 10 min
utes. chalking up four penalty cor
ners. the momentum for the remain
ing portion of the half swung Stan

ford's way, as it out-shot the Bears 13-
7.
Freshman forwards Dalinda
Banuelos and Amanda Billmyer,
both high school Ail-Americans and
members of the Stanford recruiting
class that is considered one of the best
in the nation, set the offensive tempo
with tenacious attacks and energetic
play.
Despite the outstanding play of
the Cardinal offense and the edge on
shots, the game remained scoreless
going into the second half.
The second half of play slowed
down as heat and fatigue seemed to
take its toll on both squads. The game
turned into more of a defensive bat
tle, as each team took only three shots
on goal.
But while the tempo slowed down,
the intensity heated up with neither
team willing to relinquish any advan
tage. Both teams had close calls on
penalty corners, but with the clock
winding down, the score was still 0-0.
To break the tie.the game went to
overtime, with each team fielding
only seven players a side instead of
the usual 11, in accordance with field

hockey rules. This change opened the
game up, creating more space for
players to run into but also making it
more tiring for them to cover the
field.
Stanford outshot Cal by only a

small margin, six to five, with both the
Cardinal goalie, sophomore Rebecca
Shapiro, and Cal goalie Sarah Hoehn
making several tough saves and prov
ing themselves true pressure players.
Overall. Hoehn notched six saves

while Shapiro had an impressive 11 in
both regulation and overtime. The
stellar play of the goalies proved to be
too much for the offenses of both
