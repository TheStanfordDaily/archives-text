for me to return to research and
teaching and to spend more time
with my family," said Shavelson.
Shavelson will step down Aug.

President Gerhard Casper will step

that his decision is unrelated to

During his tenure, Shavelson

has appointed 19 new faculty mem
bers, over 50 percent of his admin
istration. Of these appointments,
55 percent are women and 28 per
cent minorities.
"I am most proud of the school.
When 1 came in.it was the greatest,
and when 1 left it still was," said
Shavelson.
Stanford is consistently ranked

as one of the top graduate schools
of education in the country, with a
student body of 338 master's and
doctoral students enrolled in 35
programs.
Shavelson also created a Learn
ing Design and Technology mas
ter's program, encouraged more di
rect involvement with local schools
and promoted external fundrais
ing, which annually brought the
school $10 million. J
Shavelson hopes to continue ad
dressing these issues during his last
year and promises not to be a
"lame- duck dean."
In a press release yesterday,
Casper expressed his regret in los
ing Shavelson.
"We have been fortunate that
Dean Shavelson is such a strong ad
vocate of the school's mission of re
search. Furthermore, he has never
strayed from his belief in the im
portance of testing educational re
search in the arena of practice,"
said Casper.
Prior to his work at Stanford,
Shavelson served as dean of the
UC-Santa Barbara Graduate
School of Education for seven
years and worked for five years in
administration at the Rand Corpo
ration.
Casper will appoint a committee
to conduct a nationwide search for
the new dean, beginning this fall.
Shavelson will be a fellow at the
Center for the Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences in 2000-
2001.
"My only regret is that since we
have developed such a close com
munity in this school, it will be hard
to sav good-bye," said Shavelson.
