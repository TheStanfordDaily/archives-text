# Web site's online Facebook raises concerns
## Students meet with administrators to decide site's future 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
A meeting was held between rep
resentatives of various University de
partments and the three undergradu
ate creators of The Steamtunnels:
Stanford's Underground
(http://steamtunnels.net/) Sept. 16 to
discuss the inclusion of the Web site's
scanned Stanford Facebook photos
and the concerns this raised for the
administration.
The meeting resulted in the tem
porary removal of the Facebook
component of the Web site, pending
the further discussion currently
scheduled for Sept. 23.
The students requested to com
ment under their screen names:
Drunken Master, DJ Monkey and
The Sultan.
The VVel) site's features
The existence of the Web site was
first brought to the attention of Dean
of Students Marc Wais by Susan
Tomaro, the director of New Student
Orientation, who, according to Wais.
was made aware of it by upperclass
students.
According to Drunken Master.
DJ Monkey and The Sultan, the
three began the site as a response to
the "stagnant social scene" on cam
pus.
"We felt like we could provide a
fresh, unfiltered voice and a great set
of services that could liven things up
for everybody," said Drunken Mas
ter.
Prior to the students' meeting with
administration, Steamtunnels includ
ed an online Facebook that could be
searched by last name, first name,
first and last name, and, in some
cases, nicknames. This component
included photos scanned from the
last four Facebooks and information

about these students gleaned from
the Whois directory.
Students said they found this use
ful.
"I used [the online Facebook) fre
quently during Sophomore College
to remember people's names and
generally solidfy name and face asso-

ciations that are so easy to mix up
when meeting so many new people,"
said junior Joel Segre.
In addition, the Web site features
a restaurant guide, an events calen
dar. a bulletin board, online radio sta
tions of several genres and a compar
ison textbook shopper that allows
students to compare the textbook
prices of several retailers to obtain
the lowest one.
Differing opinions
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves first contacted Drunken Mas
ter about the Web site, citing propri
ety (copyright) and privacy concerns.
The administrators set up a meet
ing for Sept. Ift with the three stu
dents involved. There, said Wais, the
administration requested that the

students "shut down the Facebook
component of the Web site as cur
rently constructed, which they agreed
to do."
The students, according to DJ
Monkey, did not feel as though they
had any other choice.
"We feel like the University used

strong-arm tactics to bully us." he
said.
Wais stressed that the request to
shut down the Facebook component
of the site was temporary, pending
the outcome of discussions with the
students.
"We informed the students that
they could immediately initiate a new
Facebook component of the Web site
if each student consented to having
his or her photo in the Web site, and
then directly submitted a photo, any
photo, to the Web site designers, who
presumably will have some process in
place to confirm that the submitter
actually is that student." he added.
The students question the necessi
ty of this process, however, saying
that the pictures are the property of
the students themselves and. as such,
the students should be able to ap

prove the use of any photo for the
Web site, including ones in the Face
hook. This issue is one currently
being explored by the General Coun
sel.
Upon requesting that the Face
book component be removed from
Stcamtunnels. Wais cited the Univer
sity's three major concerns.
"First and foremost is the issue of
student privacy," he said. "We be
lieve students should be afforded the
opportunity to exercise their right to
consent or not consent before their
pictures and accompanying personal
information are put on the World
Wide Web.
The students contend that all the
information was.in fact, standard di
rectory information, as it was collect
ed from existing Stanford directories,
such as Whois.
Wais' primary concern, however,
was the use of students' photographs
on the site without their prior knowl
edge or explicit consent. He noted
that student pictures were not includ
ed on any of Stanford's online direc
tories.
"1 think the issue of photographs is
the main one." he said. "Photographs
are so personally identifying. Whois
is something that will be looked at.
but right now we're really troubled by
the photographs being put on the
Web."
Prior consent
Although the students recognized
the need for prior consent and ac
knowledged that it should be incor
porated into their process, they were
adamant in the defense of their inten
tions and the measures they took to
secure the product of those inten
tions.
DJ Monkev stated that the Web

site designers used the "same secure
methods that Stanford's computer
security specialists employ" to re
strict access to their Web site to the
Stanford community.
"Our Facebook is meant to em
power students," said The Sultan.
"Our online version gives each stu
dent 1 (X) percent control of his or her
picture."
At this point, however, students
do not explicitly sign off on the use of
their pictures on the site, and they
must first visit the Web site before
they can remove their pictures.
There is a mechanism now on the
site that asks for students' permission
to use their pictures.
"We are campaigning to collect
everyone's permission on the site
right now." the designers said.
Wais added that student safety is
also a concern.

Risks involved
The Web page designers saw this
risk as implicit in any use of Stanford
Web sites by the Stanford communi
ty-
"lf the administration is so para
noid about the security on the Web,
then why is so much of our personal
information, such as financial aid and
grades, posted online on Axess?"
they said. "It is as easy for someone to
transmit this information to an out
side party as it is to send information
from our site to the same party."
Concerning safety, the group said,
"We really did not think this was such
a large issue, and we believed that we
were generally following University
guidelines. Once students permit
Stanford to put pictures in the Face
book, it seems they turn up every
where for the public to see: The
Chaparral, dorm breezeways, dorm
Web pages. I-Hum Web pages and
more."

When questioned about this, Wais
said that students signed off on the
use of Facebook pictures on such
Web pages and that these pages were
approved by the University Registrar
on a case-by-case basis.
He also added that, when pictures
are displayed in dorms or department
buildings on campus, "... at least...
they have signed off on it."
"The people walking through
these halls are generally people who
are engaged in an academic pursuit."
Wais said. "The World Wide Web
and such halls are two different sce
narios."
The Web site designers dispute
this characterization of the situation
altogether, again pointing out that
their site is only accessible to the
Stanford community, thereby mak
ing it analogous to breezeways and
academic halls.
"We wholly support the Universi
ty on this issue," they said. "For this
reason, strict security measures were

employed to ensure that only people
in the Stanford halls had access to the
site."
Finally, concerning copyright, the
Web site designers agreed that the
University did have a copyright claim
to the Facebook layout, but contest
ed the University's claim to the indi
vidual photos.
According to the designers, "The
Facebook is a compilation of other
people's original works and photos
which, by legal definition, the Uni
versity does not own."
Wais commented that this was an
assertion made by General Counsel
based on their current interpretation
and understanding of Stanford's pol
icy, but he stressed that this is some
thing that the concerned parties are
willing to discuss in the upcoming
meeting this Sept. 23.
Questions about the University's ac
tions
Beyond their legal contentions.

the Web site designers also question
the University's handling of this mat
ter.
In reference to the meeting held
on Sept. 16, The Sultan said, "[Wais]
was very diplomatic, and we thought
he handled the meeting well. Some of
the other administrators were much
more antagonistic and threatening."
"They threatened to block Inter
net access from Stanford computers
to our site. Can you say Big Broth
er?" continued DJ Monkey.
According to the Web site's cre
ators, the subject of legal action
against them was introduced "not
more than five minutes into the meet
ing and before discussions had really
begun."
Wais said that a representative of
the General Counsel, Stanford's
body of legal advisors, did make a
comment early in the meeting indi
cating that there could be legal rami
fications for the Web site designers.
Of particular concern to the de

signers prior to the meeting was the e
mail titled "Alert â€” Web page for
Facebooks," which was sent on the
afternoon of Sept. 15, to the resident
assistant and resident fellow lists by
Director of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo.
"[Camarillo] sent an e-mail out to
the RA and RF list implicating us as
criminals before hearing our side of
the story, and before the meeting
even took place," the designers said.
Parts of Camarillo's e-mail dis
cussed the scanning of Facebook pic
tures for use on Steamtunnels, saying,
"While this action was well-inten
tioned, it was also illegal because the
Facebook is copyright protected. The
'owner' of the book is Stanford Uni
versity and permission must be at
tained to reproduce it in any form."
The Web site designers ques
tioned this reasoning, but they said
they were more disturbed by the fact
that this e-mail went out to so many
people before the administration had
even spoken to the students formally.
Camarillo's e-mail also stated, "If
you are interested in pursuing the
idea of developing a Facebook or a
picture board lor your house, you can
use the pictures that you took during
the in-house Draw (since students al
lowed you to take their picture for
this purpose) or if you get the explicit
permission of your first year students
to use their picture in the Facebook to
reproduce for the house purposes,
then it is okay."
Contrary to Wais' assertion that
the pages currently existing with stu

dent photos are approved individual
ly. the Web site's designers believe
that this is not. in fact, the case. The
designers viewed Camarillo's e-mail
as an attempt to retroactively elimi
nate sites including Facebook pic
tures and to prevent new Web sites of
this kind from being created in the
coming weeks.
"[The administration] have made
many reactionary measures to cover
up their tracks." the Web site's de
signers stated. "It is particularly sur
prising to us that an e-mail like Ca
marillo's would have been necessary
had the University at large been ob
serving the policies the administra
tion is now using against us."
Camarillo could not be reached
for comment.

Adtising Associates positions
Of related significance, accord
ing to DJ Monkey and The Sultan, is
the loss of their positions as AAs.
Though both had held these posi
tions before with what they saw as a
good degree of "success," both were
dismissed from their posts between
10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on Sept. 16. less
than two hours before their meeting
with administrators at noon.
" That was a big disappointment,
because we've both been AAs in the
past, and really enjoy helping out
the new freshmen." they said.
When contacted. Lynn Freeman,
the Peer Support ( oordinator at the
IJAC. said, "Over the past week. 1
have replaced more than 10 AAs for
missing all or parts of training.

Training is required for all Advising
Associates, new and returning.
"Several students made arrange
ments prior to training to miss parts
due to Sophomore College or tak
ing a final from a summer course. In
all other cases, all training was re
quired. AAs that have been re
placed over the past week were re
placed for this reason and for no
other reason."
The Sultan, because of training
for another campus position, did
miss some AA training. However,
he claims that he informed the perti
nent staff members of this well
ahead of time and feels strongly that
his dismissal was linked to Steam
tunnels.
According to DJ Monkev, he was

initially told that he was losing his
position because of illegal activities
related to the Web site and its online
Facebook. When he asked about
the loss of his position, he said he
was told by Freeman that his RF
wanted him removed, but, upon
questioning his RF. he came to the
conclusion that this was not the case.
DJ Monkey said he brought this up
with Freeman and was then told that
his dismissal was a matter of missed
training.
Freeman did subsequently men
tion that, during her dismissal con
versation with DJ Monkey, they did
speak about the online Facebook.
however she said that she made it
clear that the Facebook issue had
nothing to do with her decision.

Resolutions planned
Despite the lack of resolution on
this issue, all concerned parties
agreed at the Sept. 16 meeting to
postpone further discussion of the
issue to later this week, after the
demanding arrival of this year's
freshmen.
"We saw that University offi
cials were pre-occupied with Ori
entation, and we didn't want to dis
tract them during such a crucial
time for this year's freshmen, so we
agreed to place a moratorium on
our Facebook section until later
this week, when discussions contin
ue," said the designers.
Wais cited the freshmen arrival
as a reason for the University's im
mediate action in the situation.
