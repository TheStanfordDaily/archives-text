### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
A meeting was held between rep
resentatives of various University de
partments and the three undergradu
ate creators of The Steamtunnels:
Stanford's Underground
(http://steamtunnels.net/) Sept. 16 to
discuss the inclusion of the Web site's
scanned Stanford Facebook photos
and the concerns this raised for the
administration.
The meeting resulted in the tem
porary removal of the Facebook
component of the Web site, pending
the further discussion currently
scheduled for Sept. 23.
The students requested to com
ment under their screen names:
Drunken Master, DJ Monkey and
The Sultan.
The VVel) site's features
The existence of the Web site was
first brought to the attention of Dean
of Students Marc Wais by Susan
Tomaro, the director of New Student
Orientation, who, according to Wais.
was made aware of it by upperclass
students.
According to Drunken Master.
DJ Monkey and The Sultan, the
three began the site as a response to
the "stagnant social scene" on cam
pus.
"We felt like we could provide a
fresh, unfiltered voice and a great set
of services that could liven things up
for everybody," said Drunken Mas
ter.
Prior to the students' meeting with
administration, Steamtunnels includ
ed an online Facebook that could be
searched by last name, first name,
first and last name, and, in some
cases, nicknames. This component
included photos scanned from the
last four Facebooks and information

about these students gleaned from
the Whois directory.
Students said they found this use
ful.
"I used [the online Facebook) fre
quently during Sophomore College
to remember people's names and
generally solidfy name and face asso-

ciations that are so easy to mix up
when meeting so many new people,"
said junior Joel Segre.
In addition, the Web site features
a restaurant guide, an events calen
dar. a bulletin board, online radio sta
tions of several genres and a compar
ison textbook shopper that allows
students to compare the textbook
prices of several retailers to obtain
the lowest one.
Differing opinions
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves first contacted Drunken Mas
ter about the Web site, citing propri
ety (copyright) and privacy concerns.
The administrators set up a meet
ing for Sept. Ift with the three stu
dents involved. There, said Wais, the
administration requested that the

students "shut down the Facebook
component of the Web site as cur
rently constructed, which they agreed
to do."
The students, according to DJ
Monkey, did not feel as though they
had any other choice.
"We feel like the University used

strong-arm tactics to bully us." he
said.
Wais stressed that the request to
shut down the Facebook component
of the site was temporary, pending
the outcome of discussions with the
students.
"We informed the students that
they could immediately initiate a new
Facebook component of the Web site
if each student consented to having
his or her photo in the Web site, and
then directly submitted a photo, any
photo, to the Web site designers, who
presumably will have some process in
place to confirm that the submitter
actually is that student." he added.
The students question the necessi
ty of this process, however, saying
that the pictures are the property of
the students themselves and. as such,
the students should be able to ap

prove the use of any photo for the
Web site, including ones in the Face
hook. This issue is one currently
being explored by the General Coun
sel.
Upon requesting that the Face
book component be removed from
Stcamtunnels. Wais cited the Univer
sity's three major concerns.
"First and foremost is the issue of
student privacy," he said. "We be
lieve students should be afforded the
opportunity to exercise their right to
consent or not consent before their
pictures and accompanying personal
information are put on the World
Wide Web.
The students contend that all the
information was.in fact, standard di
rectory information, as it was collect
ed from existing Stanford directories,
such as Whois.
Wais' primary concern, however,
was the use of students' photographs
on the site without their prior knowl
edge or explicit consent. He noted
that student pictures were not includ
ed on any of Stanford's online direc
tories.
"1 think the issue of photographs is
the main one." he said. "Photographs
are so personally identifying. Whois
is something that will be looked at.
but right now we're really troubled by
the photographs being put on the
Web."
Prior consent
Although the students recognized
the need for prior consent and ac
knowledged that it should be incor
porated into their process, they were
adamant in the defense of their inten
tions and the measures they took to
secure the product of those inten
tions.
DJ Monkev stated that the Web
