# Program faces shaky future
## China Overseas Center meets with opposition

Students hoping to study abroad
in China may not have the option of
doing il through a Stanford program
for at least a few years.
Last October. Director of Over
seas Studies Russell Berman had
spoken of having an operational pro

gram within the next few years. He
said he is no longer so sure of that.
"The shifting political climate of
the country makes an estimation of
the viability of the program more dif
ficult," Berman said.
Although there are compelling
reasons to develop a program in

Stanford students may not be able to attend an overseas program in
Beijing due to concerns over Chinese political stability.
China, Berman said, the University
was concerned by issues of student
safety and academic freedom.
"A successful program in China,
or really anywhere, depends on the
prerequisite of student safety and a
security on our part that a spirit of
free inquiry, teaching and research
would prevail at least within our pro
gram," Berman said.
Berman had previously ex
pressed apprehension over the ex
tent to which Stanford would be able
to determine the academic focus of
the program.
The University of Beijing, the
Chinese host institution for the
prospective Stanford program,
"continued to have a hold on course
curriculum," Berman told the Daily
in an Oct. 16 article.
The Overseas Studies Center
submitted a general proposal for a
Stanford Center in Beijing last year.
However, Berman said that the pro
posal was submitted in a different
political context and would need to
be re-evaluated if the University did
decide to approve the program.
"I can't predict when we'll have a
program in China. If we were to be
given approval on a program, it
would take at least a full academic
year before we could think about op
erating," Berman continued.
"I think that it is a shame that I
don't get to go overseas because of
political issues," sophomore Mar
gaux Krempetz said. Krempetz is in
terested in East Asian studies and

particularly wanted to study abroad
in China to improve her language
skills.
Part of the pressure for a Stan
ford in Beijing program may also
stem from students' increasing de
mands for diversity within the Uni
versity's curriculum, as well as in its
student body.
"There are so many Asian stu
dents and such a large East Asian
studies niche that it's nice to finally
have something that might be able to
cater to that group," junior Joy Hsu
said in an interview last October.
The decision to delay a program
in Beijing comes at time when the
Chinese government has denounced
or arrested scholars and artists.
Hua Di, a researcher with the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Cooperation, was ar
rested in January 1998 bv the Chi
nese government on suspicion of
sharing Chinese military informa
tion with the United States. He was
detained for more than a year before
facing trial last March.
Last spring. Chinese authorities
banned an actress from working in
the country after she directed a film
without approval from the govern
ment's film bureau.
As the Tianamen Square inci
dent has receded further into the
past, other American universities
and colleges in the United States
have also been working hard to re
establish academic and intellectual
ties with China. The University of
Buffalo restarted an MBA program
in Beijing this January that was
eliminated after the Tianamen
Square incident.
