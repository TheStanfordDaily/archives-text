More than 1(H).(HH) Taiwanese
were left homeless alter the 7.6-
magnitude quake toppled houses
and high-rise apartment complexes
across central Taiwan early lues
day. Roads buckled in waves,
chunks ol land rose up to create
new hills, cracked buildings tilted at
crazy angles and a bridge was lelt

dangling in the air.
liv Wednesday. 1.712 people
were dead, more than 4,(HH) were
injured and almost 3.000 were
believed trapped in the rubble,
according to the Interior Ministry's
disaster management center.

tered in the Pacific Ocean east of
the island and cause no damage.
Ihe earthquake Tuesday was the
island's second deadliest quake -
after a 7.4 magnitude one killed
3,276 people in 1935.

"We're pulling the dead out one
by one. hut it's hard to get an over
all picture of the number of fatali
ties," said Chen Wen-hsien. a res
cue official in the central city of
lengyuan, 30 miles from the epi
center. I le had to plug his nose with
tissue after part of a building began
shifting from an aftershock, releas
ing the stench of a corpse still
inside.

Geological Survey's estimate. The
bureau said the quake's epicenter
was in Nantou County. 120 miles

south of the capital of Taipei,
where most of the deaths occurred.
Morgues filled up with bodies
and officials appealed for donations
of bulldozers, cars, quilts and food.
Rescue crews fiom the United
States. Singapore. Japan, Switzer
land and Russia were on their way
to provide assistance, as was a U.N.
disaster assessment team.
Taiwan's political nemesis, the
communist regime in Beijing,
offered aid, but with a subtle dig at
the island it considers a renegade
province.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said the disaster "hurt the hearts of

people on the mainland as the Chi
nese people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait are as closely linked
as flesh and blood."
China's Red Cross said it would
provide $I(H).(HH) in disaster aid and
$60.(HH) woith of relief supplies.
I he Taipei government
expressed cautious thanks.
" This would be a good begin
ning to improving ties," said Su
Chi, chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council, which is responsi
ble for Taiwan's relations with
China. "I hope we can work on this
basis and make efforts together to
build up stable and peaceful rela

lions."

state" basis.
