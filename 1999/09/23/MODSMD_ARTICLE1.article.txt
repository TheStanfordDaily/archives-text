# Revamped course guide boasts improvements
## Newly unveiled design includes more comments, increased selection of courses 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
After a delay of nearly a week, the new and
improved ASSU online course guide was
launched yesterday with more comments and
information than in previous years.
The course guide, posted online yesterday,
combines the time schedule with student re
views of 3.(XX) different classes. The informa
tion is compiled from the course evaluation
forms that students complete at the end of
each quarter. The course guide is searchable
by department, course title and number.
The "virtually instantaneous" site is better
prepared for a large volume of users, said se
nior Patrick Coffman. ASSU Web projects
director.

In addition to faster speed, the current
course guide includes more student input.
"We increased comments by 63 percent to
1,8(X)-2.(XX) student comments," he added.
Another change has been the increase in
the amount of information released by the
schools. In previous years, the ASSU staff
only received information for classes that had
a 50-percent or higher response rate on the
evaluation forms. Now. they receive informa
tion from classes with a 33-percent response
rate or higher.
"There was no current centralized re
source [online] where students can go to find
out about classes and times and reputations,"
said Coffman.
"We wanted an honest, frank evaluation
of what the classes are like."

A note on the course guide's homepage
states the ASSU's mission in creating the re
source: "The best way to make decisions
about a class is to get advice from friends and
classmates."
Originally, the staff planned to post the
site on Sept. 17 in order to allow students to
browse before choosing classes. However, a
significant portion of data from the schools
and registrar didn't arrive until early this
week.
ASSU president Mike Levin cites a "min
imum of cooperation" from the administra
tion as a factor in the delay.
In addition, the recent administration
changes affected the time lag. "The ideas on
what to release varies from person to person,"
Coffman said.

"It's an enormous undertaking," he
added. "We prefer to have a quality product
out there, and we do as much fact checking as
we can."
In the past few years, the site was online
within a day or two of the freshman arrival
date.
Approximately 10 people have been
working on the project over the summer to
"integrate the time schedule into the evalua
tive site." Levin said. "Many people have
been working nonstop, myself included, to
turn the raw data into Excel spreadsheets.
"It takes hundreds of hours to type it in
and make it all searchable, dynamic and fast."
"We're building this for students so we
want to know what students want," Coffman
said. "We depend on student feedback. The

more students contribute, the better product
it is."
Student reaction has been generally favor
able. if dismayed by the delay.
"I'm a transfer student, and I wanted to
look online over the summer at classes and I
was very disappointed that it's not available
until today." sophomore Patrick Crosetto
said. "It's a great idea and students love it
when it's done in advance."
Sophomore Danny Cox thinks the course
guide should be better publicized.
"1 did check it last year for spring quarter,
but over the summer you forget about that
kind of service." he said, "and it never oc
curred to me to check it."
The guide is available at the following web
site: http://assu.stanford.edu/guide.
