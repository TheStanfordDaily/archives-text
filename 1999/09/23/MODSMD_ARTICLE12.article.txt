## Stanford mourns for a founding father of Jasper Ridge 
### Monya De 
This summer, the scientific
community mourned the loss of a
respected botanist who left his
mark on Stanford in a multitude
of ways. John Hunter Thomas, 71.
professor of Biological Sciences
and a "founding father" of Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve, died
on July 20 of complications from
Alzheimer's disease.
Thomas received both his mas
ter's and doctoral degrees at Stan
frod, studying under the late Ira
Wiggins.
He continued at Stanford as a
lecturer in the Department of Sys
tematic Biology before receiving a
professorship in 1969.
During his career at Stanford.
Thomas also served as the direc
tor of the Dudley Herbarium
while it was located at Stanford
and as botany curator of the Cali

fornia Academy of Sciences.
Thomas was one of the faculty
members instrumental in estab
lishing the Jasper Ridge preserve

located near Woodside. He envi
sioned the future Jasper Ridge as
a hands-on learning environment
as well as an important botanical
resource.
Thomas and the other founders
foresaw the impending develop
ment of the area and a need to
retain a sanctuary where animals
and plants could flourish as in the

wild.
A "microcosm of the global
environment," Jasper Ridge
became a biological preserve in
1973 and boasts more than 1.100
acres.
Since its designation as an offi
cially protected area, over 200
theses have been based on
research done in the area, and 25
Stanford classes currently use the
preserve as an instructional tool.
Ward Watt, professor of popu
lation biology and genetics,
remembered Thomas as a devot
ed undergraduate teacher, touch
ing lives "both educationally and
scientifically".
Watt noted that a former stu
dent. now a botanist at a major
university, credited Thomas with
helping him shape his entire pro
fessional life.
Thomas taught his popular
plant systematics and ecology

course to hundreds of students for
over two decades. Watt comment
ed that it was one of those rare
courses that built "the foundation
of a lifetime interest" in the sub
ject matter on the part of students
who took it.
Thomas also taught the courses
"Mosses and Ferns" and "Vegeta
tion and Fire."
Philippe Cohen, administrative

director of Jasper Ridge, recalls
Thomas' legendary enthusiasm
and knack for drawing students'
attention to the unique character

istics of plants. These qualities
engendered rave reviews for his
field seminars. Thomas trained
several early docents of Jasper
Ridge himself and did not retire
until 1995.
Thomas' dedication extended
beyond the borders of academia.
He was an activist on the issue of
over-population.
In the 19605, Thomas was
actively involved in population
control efforts, joining two other
Roman Catholic biologists in writ
ing letters and delivering speeches
denouncing Pope Paul Vl's stand
against birth control.
Thomas also turned his searing
attention toward issues closer to
home, lambasting the planters of
campus eucalyptus trees.
"We should plant oaks instead,
because eucalyptus aren't native
to this area, and they break down
the quality of the ground. But the

gardeners won't listen to me at
all," he once told The Daily.
Even Thomas' research
reflected his flexible mind. His
specialty, floristic botany, is a
field that attempts to understand
the origins of a region's plant life
in the context of the evolutionary
processes that occur over time.
He was particularly interested
in characterization and collection
of plant life in the Western Unit
ed States. This resulted in his dis
sertation, "Flora of the Santa
Cruz Mountains of California."
published by The Stanford Uni
versity Press in 1961 and used bv
such organizations as the Santa
Cruz Bioregional Council in their
conservation efforts.
In his spare time, he could be
found in his garage, turning out
books on his own printing press.
Thomas served as the depart
ment's historian and printed
notices for Biology Department
events.
But it was no small sense of
humor that led him to print and
mail to Stanford's Paul Ehrlich a
review of Ehrlich's latest book,
supposedly from an obscure biol-

°gy journal. The review was enti
tled "Yet Another Butterfly
Book."
Thomas will be remembered
for bringing a little levity to the
Biology Department as well as
providing a lasting educational
resource to the Stanford commu
nity.

New painless vaccines
developed at Stanford
By Joanne Wu
Staff writer
Studies by Stanford researchers have
opened the possibility for a new and pain
less technique for applying vaccines.
Instead of the traditional injections, vacci
nations may one day simply be a matter of
a quick shower.
In recent experiments with mice per
formed at the Stanford School of Medicine,
it was found that a solution of DNA and
water placed on the skin was as effective in
inducing an immune response against hep
atitis B as the traditional injection to the
muscle.
"We study cutaneous gene transfer in
our lab, looking for new ways to introduce
DNA into the skin," said Dr. Paul Khavari,
Chief of Dermatology at the Veterans
Affairs Health Care System in Palo Alto,
and an associate professor of dermatology
and molecular pharmacology at the School
of Medicine.
The DNA vaccinc in the study, a cream
that contained hepatitis B DNA. was
applied directly onto a tiny area on the sur
face of the mouse's skin. The vaccine is then
absorbed through hair follicles.
Once absorbed, the cells of the hair folli
cles convert the DNA into antigens, which
are proteins that are recognized by the
bodv as being foreign. The follicle cells then
cause the body's lymph nodes to generate
antibodies, which attack these foreign pro
teins.
"The tissues translate the DNA informa
tion; the DNA vaccine just delivers the
genetic information," Khavari said. "The
tissues themselves make the protein vac
cine."
Research Associate Dr. Hongran Fan
was the lead author for the report on these
studies, which appear in the September
issue of Nature Biotechnology.
The new vaccination method differs
greatly from the conventional one, where
antigens (proteins from bacteria or viruses)
are injected directly into the muscle tissue,
causing the lymph nodes to generate anti
bodies.
Topical DNA vaccination on mice was
performed as early as 1993 by other scien
tists. Khavari's group had taken note of top
ical DNA vaccination then, but did not fol
low up on the technique since the mice
were used as a negative control for a differ
ent study. Also, Khavari explained, "Since
the vaccine did not work on hairless mice, it
seemed inconsistent."
But the same results were seen many
times, so eventually, studies were made
which focused on the hair follicles. "Once
we sorted out the facts, we concluded that
gene transfer via topical application
depends entirely on the presence of normal
hair follicles," Khavari said. "The DNA is
not taken in by interfollicular skin. The fol
licles represent lipid-filled tubes, so it
makes sense that the DNA is more accessi
ble to cells in the follicle."
Topical vaccines provide several advan
tages over traditional vaccines. The tradi
tional antigen vaccine must be kept refrig
erated and can only be stored for six
months, whereas the new cream vaccine
can be left at room temperature indefinite
ly.
"DNA in water can remain stable for
more than a year at room temperature,"
Khavari explained. "Another advantage is
that the vaccine does not involve a needle,
so it does not require specialized personnel
to administer. Also, the unit cost for the
topical vaccine is much lower."
Besides the viral vaccine for hepatitis B.
the Stanford researchers also looked at the
reaction of the mice to topical DNA vac
cines for the bacteria E. Coli. "The enzyme
from E. Coli raised a robust immune
response," Khavari said. "In principle,
there is no reason why [the topical DNA
vaccine] method would not work for most
protein vaccines," he added.
Although the findings appear very
promising for the future, Khavari cau
tioned, "It's an initial study. We need to
address some issues before starting human
trials. Once we refine [the vaccine's] poten
cy and ensure that it does not cause any
unanticipated adverse effects, then we can
consider initiating human trials."
Khavari explained the goal of their
research: "We are hoping that it will find
some application in producing inexpensive,
painless, effective vaccines."
Recent data proves Galileo right
By Bruce Wang
Editorial Staff
Stanford physicists have carried out a
modern version of the famous experi
ment in which Galileo dropped light and
heavy objects from the Leaning Tower
of Pisa.
Led by Steven Chu, Stanford physics
professor and 1997 Nobel Laureate, the
group of scientists compared individual
atoms and glass cubes instead of balls of
wood and iron. They came to the same
conclusion as the 16th century physi
cist —all objects respond equally to the
force of gravity.
The study proved that the force of
gravity is virtually identical at atomic and
everyday large-scale levels. A previous
study had suggested a few percent differ
ence between the pull of gravity on sub
atomic neutron particles and larger
objects.
According to physics doctoral student
Cheng Chin, the group used a technique
called atom interferometry to carry out
the most precise measurement ever
made of the acceleration of individual
atoms falling under the force of gravity.
Using a laser cooling and trapping
technique pioneered by Chu. a small
number of cesium atoms were cooled to
less than 100 micro-Kelvin. This decreas
es the kinetic energy of the atoms and
allows the scientists to slow the atoms
down enough to "confine" a group of
about eight to 10 atoms together, called
an atomic fountain.
The confined atoms were then
launched vertically into the air in a vacu
um using a laser. The atoms spend one
second in flight. Using the electromag
netic wave as a ruler, the group was able
to measure how much the atom had
moved.
The specific measurements were cal
culated using a method called Ramsey
fringes. "We measured the position and
spacing of the interference fringe pat
terns of the atoms as they fall under the
force of gravity," said Chin.
This method of atomic interferometry
is 1.000 times more accurate than previ
ous experiments with neutron interfer
ometry.
To ensure accuracy in the measure
ments, the group took extra care to
shield the atoms from any kind of inter
ference from the environment. Even the
tables on which the atomic interferome
ter was built had stabilizers to dampen
any ground vibrations.
By comparing this measurement with
the rate of acceleration of a falling glass
cube, the group showed that the gravita
tional force acting on atoms —which are
subject to the laws of quantum mechan
ics—is the same as that acting on familiar
objects governed by the classical laws of
physics.
The result is extremely accurate, with
only a seven in 1 billion chance of uncer
tainty.
The atomic interferometer has sever
al potentially useful applications, accord
ing to Chin. One would be using the
interferometer as a probe to detect mate
rials underground.
"Different materials underground will
lead to small differences in local gravi
ty." Chin said. With a sensitive machine
such as the one used in this experiment,
scientists can detect what materials lie
underground without having to dig. This
could be very useful in the search for
mines and oil.
Keng-Yeow Chung, a doctoral stu
dent in physics who headed the project,
is also using the atom interferometer to
monitor other geophysical phenomena,
such as tides.
The group is currently trying to fur
ther improve the apparatus. Future
developments may lead to portable
instruments.
