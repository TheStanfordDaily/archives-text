# New painless vaccines developed at Stanford

Studies by Stanford researchers have
opened the possibility for a new and pain
less technique for applying vaccines.
Instead of the traditional injections, vacci
nations may one day simply be a matter of
a quick shower.
In recent experiments with mice per
formed at the Stanford School of Medicine,
it was found that a solution of DNA and
water placed on the skin was as effective in
inducing an immune response against hep
atitis B as the traditional injection to the
muscle.
"We study cutaneous gene transfer in
our lab, looking for new ways to introduce
DNA into the skin," said Dr. Paul Khavari,
Chief of Dermatology at the Veterans
Affairs Health Care System in Palo Alto,
and an associate professor of dermatology
and molecular pharmacology at the School
of Medicine.
The DNA vaccinc in the study, a cream
that contained hepatitis B DNA. was
applied directly onto a tiny area on the sur
face of the mouse's skin. The vaccine is then
absorbed through hair follicles.
Once absorbed, the cells of the hair folli
cles convert the DNA into antigens, which
are proteins that are recognized by the
bodv as being foreign. The follicle cells then
cause the body's lymph nodes to generate
antibodies, which attack these foreign pro
teins.
"The tissues translate the DNA informa
tion; the DNA vaccine just delivers the
genetic information," Khavari said. "The
tissues themselves make the protein vac
cine."
Research Associate Dr. Hongran Fan
was the lead author for the report on these
studies, which appear in the September
issue of Nature Biotechnology.
The new vaccination method differs
greatly from the conventional one, where
antigens (proteins from bacteria or viruses)
are injected directly into the muscle tissue,
causing the lymph nodes to generate anti
bodies.
Topical DNA vaccination on mice was
performed as early as 1993 by other scien

tists. Khavari's group had taken note of top
ical DNA vaccination then, but did not fol
low up on the technique since the mice
were used as a negative control for a differ
ent study. Also, Khavari explained, "Since
the vaccine did not work on hairless mice, it
seemed inconsistent."
But the same results were seen many
times, so eventually, studies were made
which focused on the hair follicles. "Once
we sorted out the facts, we concluded that
gene transfer via topical application
depends entirely on the presence of normal
hair follicles," Khavari said. "The DNA is
not taken in by interfollicular skin. The fol
licles represent lipid-filled tubes, so it
makes sense that the DNA is more accessi
ble to cells in the follicle."
Topical vaccines provide several advan
tages over traditional vaccines. The tradi
tional antigen vaccine must be kept refrig
erated and can only be stored for six
months, whereas the new cream vaccine
can be left at room temperature indefinite
ly.
"DNA in water can remain stable for
more than a year at room temperature,"
Khavari explained. "Another advantage is
that the vaccine does not involve a needle,
so it does not require specialized personnel
to administer. Also, the unit cost for the
topical vaccine is much lower."
Besides the viral vaccine for hepatitis B.
the Stanford researchers also looked at the
reaction of the mice to topical DNA vac
cines for the bacteria E. Coli. "The enzyme
from E. Coli raised a robust immune
response," Khavari said. "In principle,
there is no reason why [the topical DNA
vaccine] method would not work for most
protein vaccines," he added.
Although the findings appear very
promising for the future, Khavari cau
tioned, "It's an initial study. We need to
address some issues before starting human
trials. Once we refine [the vaccine's] poten
cy and ensure that it does not cause any
unanticipated adverse effects, then we can
consider initiating human trials."
Khavari explained the goal of their
research: "We are hoping that it will find
some application in producing inexpensive,
painless, effective vaccines."
