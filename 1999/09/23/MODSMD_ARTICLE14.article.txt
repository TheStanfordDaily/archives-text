# Recent data proves Galileo right

Stanford physicists have carried out a
modern version of the famous experi
ment in which Galileo dropped light and
heavy objects from the Leaning Tower
of Pisa.
Led by Steven Chu, Stanford physics
professor and 1997 Nobel Laureate, the
group of scientists compared individual
atoms and glass cubes instead of balls of
wood and iron. They came to the same
conclusion as the 16th century physi
cist —all objects respond equally to the
force of gravity.
The study proved that the force of
gravity is virtually identical at atomic and
everyday large-scale levels. A previous
study had suggested a few percent differ
ence between the pull of gravity on sub
atomic neutron particles and larger
objects.
According to physics doctoral student
Cheng Chin, the group used a technique
called atom interferometry to carry out
the most precise measurement ever
made of the acceleration of individual
atoms falling under the force of gravity.
Using a laser cooling and trapping
technique pioneered by Chu. a small
number of cesium atoms were cooled to
less than 100 micro-Kelvin. This decreas
es the kinetic energy of the atoms and
allows the scientists to slow the atoms
down enough to "confine" a group of
about eight to 10 atoms together, called
an atomic fountain.
The confined atoms were then

launched vertically into the air in a vacu
um using a laser. The atoms spend one
second in flight. Using the electromag
netic wave as a ruler, the group was able
to measure how much the atom had
moved.
The specific measurements were cal
culated using a method called Ramsey
fringes. "We measured the position and
spacing of the interference fringe pat
terns of the atoms as they fall under the
force of gravity," said Chin.
This method of atomic interferometry
is 1.000 times more accurate than previ
ous experiments with neutron interfer
ometry.
To ensure accuracy in the measure

ments, the group took extra care to
shield the atoms from any kind of inter
ference from the environment. Even the
tables on which the atomic interferome
ter was built had stabilizers to dampen
any ground vibrations.
By comparing this measurement with
the rate of acceleration of a falling glass
cube, the group showed that the gravita
tional force acting on atoms —which are
subject to the laws of quantum mechan
ics—is the same as that acting on familiar
objects governed by the classical laws of
physics.
The result is extremely accurate, with
only a seven in 1 billion chance of uncer
tainty.
The atomic interferometer has sever
al potentially useful applications, accord
ing to Chin. One would be using the
interferometer as a probe to detect mate
rials underground.
"Different materials underground will
lead to small differences in local gravi
ty." Chin said. With a sensitive machine
such as the one used in this experiment,
scientists can detect what materials lie
underground without having to dig. This
could be very useful in the search for
mines and oil.
Keng-Yeow Chung, a doctoral stu
dent in physics who headed the project,
is also using the atom interferometer to
monitor other geophysical phenomena,
such as tides.
The group is currently trying to fur
ther improve the apparatus. Future
developments may lead to portable
instruments.
