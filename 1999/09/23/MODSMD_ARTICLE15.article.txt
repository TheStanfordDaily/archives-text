### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
The last time California beat Stanford at women's
volleyball. Ronald Regan was president. Cindi Lauper
was at the height of her popularity and most Stanford
freshmen were still teething.
The year was IIJK2.l l JK2. Since then, the Cardinal had
handed Cal 32 straight losses.
Last night. Stanford made it 33, as the No. 7 Cardi
nal (6-1.3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) defeated the Bears
(4-4. 1-2) in four games, 15-5, 11-15, 15-4. 15-7.
After being crushed in the first game, Cal was able
to come back in the second and challenge an obvious
ly stronger Cardinal team, eventually beating the
squad 15-11 to tie the match at one.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
â–  Tuesday: No. 7 Stanford (6-1.3-0) def. California (4-4,
1-2)15-5.11-15.15-4. 15-7.
Alter the victory, however, Cal looked hapless once
again, and the Cardinal was able to win the next two
games to put the match away.
It was a spotty performance from a Bear team that
has posted only four match victories ever against Stan
lord compared to 45 Cardinal victories.
The Cardinal shined behind a strong performance
by standout freshman Logan I om. Tom snagged 20
kills. 15 digs, five blocks and four service aces.
Additionally, senior Kerri Walsh recorded a match
high .500 hitting percentage while racking up IS kills
and 14 digs. Freshman Ashley Ivy added 12 kills and
senior Sarah Clark logged in with 10.
Coming into the season. Tom had serious work to
do if she was going to live up to preseason hype. She
was the top women's volleyball recruit this season and
one of the most highly recruited atheletes in the nation
ever.
So far in IWS, Tom has gotten dangerously close to
living up to the hype that surrounds her. Monday, she
was named Pac-1() Player of the Week after stunning
performances against Washington and Washington
State last week.
Against Washington. Tom registered 10 kills, eight
digs and eight blocks to help the Cardinal to a sweep of
Washington State. A day earlier. Tom contributed to
the team's sweep of Washington with 16 kills.
Despite not joining the team until Sept. 6. Tom has

already recorded 90 kills, 52 digs, 21 blocks and nine
service aces for a Cardinal team that already boasts a
host of stars.
Tom missed the first two matches of the season,
time she spent at the Junior World Championships in
Canada playing for the U.S. Junior National Team.
The Cardinal is also looking for breakthrough per
formances from Walsh. Although the three-time
AVCA All-American's shoulder bothered her
through most of last season. Walsh was still able to win
1998 Pac-10 Player of the Year honors. So far this sea
son. Walsh has been reluctant to let loose with her
shoulder, but has still been able to lead the team in its
six victories.
Against Washington and Washington State. Walsh
moved from her normal position as an outside hitter to
middle blocker to help fill in for injuries to junior Jen
nifer Detmer and sophomore Tara Conrad. However.
Walsh still was able to shine in both games. She record
ed 10 kills, seven digs and six blocks against Washing
ton and eight kills and 15 digs against Washington
State.
The Cardinal began the season ranked No. 2 in the
AVCA-USA Today Top 25 Coaches Poll. But after a
3-1 loss to Texas in the team's second game. Stanford
fell to No. 7. Texas, which has lost twice since deaing
Stanford its only loss, has fallen to No. N.
Despite Cal's failure to break its 33-game losing
streak against Stanford, the team passed a minor mile
stone by winning the second game of the match. It was
the first time a Cal team had won a game against Stan
ford since the 1996 season.
For Stanford, the win meant a solidified position
atop the Pac-10 with a 3-0 league record. The Cardinal
has won the last five Pac-10 titles.
Stanford will play its home opener this weekend in
the Pac-10 / Mountain West Conference Challenge at
Maples Pavilion. Friday, the Cardinal faces Utah at
7:30 p.m. The next day, the Cardinal will meet a fear
some No. 10 Brigham Young team at 7 p.m. After
opening the season with seven games on the road, this
weekend's action gives the Cardinal its first opportuni
ty to play at home.
At the tournament, the Cardinal will put its 23-
game home winning streak on the line. The team has
also won 79 of its last SO home games, dating to 1993.
Pac-10 play begins in earnest next week when the
Cardinal faces Oregon and Oregon state at home
Thursday and Friday.
