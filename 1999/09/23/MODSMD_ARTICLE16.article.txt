## Bring on the Tigers 
### Ashley Rich 
The first week of classes can he
a hectic and tiring time, which isn't
very helpful to the exhausted field
hockey players who spent last Sun
day in a grueling double-overtime
matchup against longtime rival
California.
That means Stanford (3-5, 2-0
Northern Pacific Conference) will
have to face division rival Pacific
(0-6, 0-1) on Saturday after a long
and difficult week.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Saturday: Stanford (3-5, 2-0) vs.
Pacific (0-6, 0-1). 1 p.m. Varsity As
tro Turf Field.
After 26 shots on goal and 70
minutes of scoreless regulation
play, the Cardinal and the Golden
Bears (6-2, 4-0) were forced into
two scoreless sudden-death over
times. forcing the teams into penal
ly shots.
Cal finally pulled out the victory
with three goals to Stanford's one
" — a tough way to lose a closely
matched game where Stanford
seemed to dominate.
„ Although Cal is also one of the
"six teams in the NorPac, Sunday's
Ngame does not count for the C ardi
nal's conference record.
)« However, the team's next
against Pacific at home
>on Saturday does — making it even
-more important.
As two of the three varsity field
hockey teams in the state of Cali
fornia, Pacific and Stanford have a
'long history of matches betwen
eatch other behind them. Last
year, Stanford defeated the ligers
4-1 and 5-1. but the 1 igers
•second-year head coach brings to
the field two new assistant coaches
and 10 new freshmen, one of them
a six-foot foreign-exchange stu
* dent from Australia.
The Cardinal takes on the

Tigers at 1 p.m. on the Varsity Turf
Field for the second time this sea
son. The first meeting was a pre
season scrimmage where the Car
dinal beat the Tigers 6-0.
This preseason's scrimmage
may have been a blowout, hut Pa
cific has since come together to
pose a threat to the young Stanford
team. Since then, the Tigers and
Stanford have played several of the
same teams and posted similar
scores. The Tigers kept Cal to a
close 2-1 loss and were barely de
feated in overtime by Louisville,
who had previously defeated the
Cardinal 2-1.
Apparently, similar to the Stan
ford team, which lost six starting
seniors from last season, it just took
a little while for the Tigers to work
out whatever kinks the team had in
its young lineup. Senior midfielder
and captain Mallory Chambers
said that some adjustment was visi
ble during their scrimmage.
"At the beginning of the game.
Pacific looked a bit scattered and
uncomfortable out there, but as the
game progressed, you could tell
they were beginning to plav as a
team." she said.
After Stanford built the new
Varsity Astro Turf Field last year.
Pacific is currently the only varsity
team to play on grass. The turf
game, which is quicker and
smoother, takes a bit of adjustment
in terms of timing and passing ac
curacy.
Perhaps a bit of practice on the
new surface was all the Tigers
needed to pick up their game.
Already halfway into its season,
the Cardinal is undefeated so far in
the pursuit of its ninth NorPac title.
And as the team concentrates on
turning its season into a winning
record, one of the toughest distrac
tions began on Wednesday when
classes started.
Now the three-hour practices
and additional weight-lifting ses
sions come after a full day of acad
emics. But the team hasn't lost any
intensity from the days before
classes started.
"We've been steadily improv
ing throughout the season and we
can only keep moving forward."
Chambers said.
One thing that head coach Sh
eryl Johnson requested her players
do after the tough loss to Cal was to
push through the week's practices
with the same intensity as exhibit
ed in Sunday's game.
The players apparently listened.
"It's been a hectic week, but
things look good out here," senior
captain Sarah Medieros said, com
ing off the field after Wednesday's
practice.
"Everyone's concentrating and
intense. Our penalty corners,
which require concentration and
accuracy, looked good today."
