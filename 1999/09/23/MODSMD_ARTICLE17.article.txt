### Lori Maund 
The No. 23 Stanford womens soccer team is on a roll.

Seton I fall last weekend, the Cardinal (4-2) hopes to convert this streak of
exceptional play into a series of important wins this weekend.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Friday: No. 23 Stanford (4-2) ;it No. 1 7 Virginia (4-2)
■ Sunday: Stanford at No. II Richmond (6-1).
The team travels to Charlottesville, Va. to face the No. 17 Virginia
Cavaliers (4-2) on Friday and the No. 11 Richmond Spiders (6-1) tin Sun
day in the annual Coca-Cola Classic.
"We are excited at the opportunity to play these teams." senior co-cap
tain Jenn O'Sullivan said. "This weekend will give us the chance to play

against two very competitive teams and a win will give us the chance to
show our strength on the national level."
Two wins this weekend could prove significant to the Cardinal in post
season ranking and seeding in the NC AA tournament. I his weekend
poses the team's only game against an Atlantic Coast Conference team
this season and will, in a sense, test the mettle of Stanford's own Pacilic 10
Conference.
"The more wins a team has out of region, the more it strengthens their
conference." said head coach Steve Swanson. "For the NCAA lourna
ment. they will consider the strength of our conference and then deter
mine how many teams will go to the tournament from each conference."
In other words, if teams in the Pac-1() consistently win games out of
conference, then more teams from the Pac-10 will likely qualih lor post
season play. Although the winner of the Pac-10 is given an automatic
berth to the NCAA Tournament, the number of other Pac-10 teams who
qualify for the tournament varies from year to year, based on the per
ceived strength of teams in the conference.
I wo wins this weekend against teams ranked in the top 20 nationally
will considerably increase the Cardinal's chances of qualifying lor post
season play by improving its national ranking and by possibly increasing
the number of teams from the Pac-10 accepted to the N( AA lourna
ment.
The strategy for Stanford this weekend is to focus on moving the ball
quickly, maintaining possession and capitalizing on chances to score.
"In the last two weeks, we have been working on possession and not
turning the ball over." Swanson said. "We are linking more between the
midficld and forward line to make possession turn into chances. We want
to move from possession to penetration to creating chances on goal.
The Cardinal faces Virginia tomorrow night. The Cavalier squad is
armed with junior forward Katie Iracy, who was named to the Soccer
America Team of the Week for Sept. 19 after she helped her team defeat
the then No. 9 Duke Blue Devils. Tracy contributed to the 2-1 win with
two assists. This is the fourth time Tracy has been on the Soccer America
Team of the Week and the second time this season.
Tracy was also named the ACC Soccer Player of the Week after the
Cavaliers defeated North Carolina State, capping off two wins in one
weekend against ACC teams.
For the Cardinal to beat Virginia, part of its tactics must include shut
ting down I racy. who poses a threat on the Cavaliers forward line.
"We are going to play hard against her, but our emphasis is not to focus
on any one player," O'Sullivan said. "We are going to work hard to shut
down all their players."
Richmond, a fairly new threat on the national scene, is ranked in the
top 20 nationally for the first time in school history. The team's recent
ranking came after the defeat of two nationally ranked teams, Furman
and Clemson.
Among the players to watch on Richmond's team are junior forward
Brooke Sands, who was recently named as the Colonial Athletic Associa
tion Player of the Week, and sophomore goalkeeper Kristen Samuhel,
who boasts of a .43 goals-against average.
"There are no 'gimmes' anymore," senior defender Natalie Kim said.
"We are excited about this weekend but realize it will also be a lot of hard
work. We have trained hard and feel prepared to go out there and win."
