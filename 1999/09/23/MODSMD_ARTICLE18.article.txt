# And the thunder rolls: Card falls to USF on storm-filled night
## Soccer squad dominates showdown with Dons, but unable to capitalize on scoring opportunities 
### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
The team was focused, the
chances were there, but, in the end,
the ball bounced the wrong way for
the Stanford men's soccer team (2-
2-1) at Tuesday night's game
against San Francisco (6-6-3).

MEW'S SOCCER
■ Tuesday: USF (3-1)3, Stanford (2-
2-1)1.
As their fellow classmates were
frantically scouring their time
schedules, making last-minute ad
justments and preparing for the
first day of classes, the men trav
eled to Nogoesco Stadium to face
the Dons among the mist and thun
derstorms. The two-goal deficit in
the team's 3-1 defeat, however,
does not give a fair assessment of a
game that was often under Cardi
nal control.
"We did a lot of things really
well," head coach Bobby Clark
said. "We out-shot them [12-8] and
led the game 8-2 in corner kicks.
We created opportunities, we just
didn't take them."
The Cardinal started strong.
The game was scoreless until USF's
Gerard Hylkema buried a long
shot from 25 yards out into Stan
ford's net. Seven minutes into the
second half, however, the Cardinal
equalized with a goal converted
from a free kick. Senior captain
T.K. Inbody took the kick, and ju
nior defender Rvan Nelson headed

into the crossbar. Sophomore de
fender Lee Morrison finished the
effort and knocked in his first goal
of the season on the rebound for
the team's only goal.
USF answered 24 minutes later
with another long shot, this time
from Alex Akerjordet, who round
ed out the scoring with his second
goal six minutes later.
Despite the score, the team was
generally pleased with its play and
had trouble pinpointing what went
wrong.
"We started the game very well,
we were just unlucky not to score,"
senior midfielder Gerard Davis
said. "Even though we were down
at halftime, we were pretty confi
dent that we'd get back in the
game, which we did. We had some
good chances to score but we didn't
capitalize on them. We conceded
goals at bad times, so we ended up
chasing the game."
Junior forward Brandon
Garinger agreed that luck may not
have been on the side of the Cardi
nal as the game was riddled with
missed opportunities and unfin
ished chances.
"It was there for us, but we
couldn't make it happen,"
Garinger said. "When we tied it up
that was our chance to pounce and
pour it on. Once they got their sec
ond goal it was a little tougher, but
a win was still very much in our
sights."
"Every game needs to be like a
cup final for us, we need to have a
killer instinct," Nelson said. "We

need to play with ruthlessness from
the defense to the attack. We may
have been the better team, but we
didn't have enough ruthlessness
and we ended up losing."
The players will be the first to
admit that the win does not always
go to the better team on the field.
"It's disappointing, but in soccer
you can play well and still lose,"
Nelson said.
"It's one of the fascinating, but
also one of the frustrating things
about soccer that we could create
so many opportunities but then the
other team comes along and just
pops one in," Clark agreed.
That's just what happened Tues
day night. Two breaks for USF with
two shots, each from 25 yards out,
and all of a sudden it's a different
game.
For a team with high expecta
tions this season, the men are not
yet deterred by the fact that the
team's record now dips close to
.500.
"There's no need to push any
panic buttons," Clark said. "The
team played well, we've just got to
put the whole game together and
we've got to finish. This is where
our team has got to believe in
themselves. We're not far away but
we've got to concentrate to get
back on track."
Clark points out that last year's
team had an almost identical
record of 3-2 last season at this
time. The eventual NCAA-finalist
Cardinal seemed to rally well from
its early loses to San Jose State (2-

I) and Dartmouth (2-0). It went on
to finish the season with an impres
sive IK-5-2 record.
Optimism seems to be the rule
rather than the exception in the
minds of the men's soccer team,
and Clark's confidence is ever-pre

sent.
"We tend to learn more from
losses than from victories," Davis
said. "There's not much difference
between winning and losing, we
just need to find ways to win games
and put teams away."

"We need to learn from our mis
takes and get the hunger for win
ning back again," Nelson said.
Clark is hoping that hunger for
winning will show up on Saturday
night when Stanford faces Bradley
(6-6-3) on Cardinal soil.
