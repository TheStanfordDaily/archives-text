# College meningitis rates rise
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
A wave of publicity this summer
about a nationwide rise in the num
ber of cases of bacterial meningitis
on college campuses — especially
among students living in dormito
ries — has some college medical
clinics, including Stanford's ( owell
Student Health Center, re-evaluat
ing what they tell parents and stu
dents about the need for a meningi
tis vaccine.
"Public health officials are eval
uating the vaccine now. II it be
comes recommended by those offi
cials. we will re-evaluate our rec
ommendations." said Cowell Di
rector Ira Friedman.
At this point. Friedman said that
Stanford does not recommend a
vaccine to all students.
"Cowell recommends that stu
dents and parents become in
formed about the risks of meningo
coccal disease and the possibility of
having an immunization." said
Friedman. "We do not recommend
having the vaccine; rather, it is up
to an individual's weighing of the
risks and benefits which will be dif
ferent for different people."
Media concern has put meningi
tis on the agenda and has campus
•authorities evaluating what advice
dial information to give to students
and parents.
Z*. A report on the Sept. 20 AB(
newsmagazine show "20/20" called
Meningitis "a secret stalker, an in
visible killer which loves to attack
■mong the masses, and featured
<6*perts advising students to get the
ntoceinc. which provides partial

protection against the disease.
"It's good that the media is edu
cating students and parents about
this important issue, but I believe
that some have sensationalized the
issue and have not presented ii in a
balanced way." said Friedman

Meningitis is a disease which can
kill its victims within hours of the
appearance of its first symptoms,
lis li ist symptoms can often be mis
taken for the flu. and include high
fever, headache and a stiff neck.
Meningitis does seem to be on
the rise on college campuses, where
it is already inexplicably prevalent.
Bacterial meningitis is spread
through respiratory secretions and
direct contact.
According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention,
the number of cases of invasive
meningococcal disease in 15 to 24-
year-olds almost doubled between
IWI and IW7.
And a July study released by the
American College Health Associa
tion found that the rate of the dis
ease among freshmen living in dor
mitories w;is six times higher than
the rate for all college students.
Fxperts theorize that cramped
living conditions and stressed-out
dorm lifestyles may contribute to

the disease's comparative preva
lence in dorms.
According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, freshman living
conditions are analogous to certain
crowded living conditions in the
military. The military, which began
requiring new recruits to lake the
vaccine after it became widely
available in the early 1980s, virtual
ly eradicated the disease within its
ranks.
In light of statistics linking
meningitis to college life, the
A( 11A has recommended that stu
dents consider getting a $60 to $65
vaccine which provides limited
protection against meningitis.
But other experts say that the
huge cost of vaccinating students
there arc about 14 million col
lege students enrolled this year
is money that could be better spent
elsewhere or on other health pro
grams.
The risk of contracting bacterial
meningitis remains small. Among
those millions of college students,
there are an estimated 125 to 175
cases of meningococcal meningitis
each year. About 10 percent of
those cases are fatal.
Hut the vaccine does not pro
vide complete protection. It is esti
mated to be about 85 percent effec
tive against four strains of meningi
tis. and those four strains account
for about 70 cases in college-age
students.
Cowell will update students
about meningococcal meningitis
later this year in an upcoming ( ow -
ell Health Series flier about pre
venting disease through vaccina
tions.
