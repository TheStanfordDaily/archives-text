Rock stars were dying with
alarming frequency as the
1960s ended. Among the
fresh crop of corpses was Janis
Joplin, who on October 4th, 1970
found out'that too much heroin is
not a good thing. When Joplin died,
she was finishing up the album
"Pearl," which went to No. 1 along
with its single "Me and Bobby
McGee." The album also contains
the song that the irony-proof admen
at Mercedes Ben/, have recently co
opted. Given this, you may ask, what
is on these two expanded and remas
tered reissues? Only the best wax
Pearl ever cut.
Joplin had the misfortune to be
born in Port Arthur, Texas. Never a
particularly open-minded place,
Texas in the 1950s was suffocating
for a free-spirited woman like Joplin.
She found solace in the emotional,
raw power of the blues — its sexual
ity and passionate suffering — and
soon began singing in coffeehouses
and bars. Fellow Texan and friend
Chet Helms (of Family Dog / Aval
on Ballroom fame) lured her out to
San Francisco, where she soon
joined a band he was managing
named Big Brother and the Holding
Company.
Big Brother epitomized both the
pros and cons of San Francisco psy
chedelia. Not given to the noodling
of the Grateful Dead or the tight
harmonies of the Jefferson Air
plane, the group instead went for
overdrive: Janis pushed her voice
until it cracked, and guitarists Sam
Andrew and Jim Gurney traded
mean, distorted and feedback
drenched solos while drummer
Dave Getz and bassist Pete Albin
tried, often in vain, to hold the whole
thing together.

Their guitars wandered out of
tune, and the songs threatened to fall
apart at every tempo change. In
deed, the producer of "Cheap
Thrills" was so distraught by the
band's sloppiness that he had his
name removed from the album to
avoid being associated with the work
(it was John Simon, to out him).
However, when the songs come to
gether, they nail you to the wall.
Big Brother and the Holding
Company's eponymous debut
album was recorded under less-than
ideal circumstances, but this adversi
ty bred some triumphs. "Dow.i on
Me" and "Call on Me" allow Joplin
enough room to really dig in, "Bye
Bye Baby" is a gentle and remark
ably restrained blues piece, and
"Women Is Losers" could practical
ly be Joplin's theme song. "Blind
man" was a hit single in the asking
with its descending bassline, while
"Easy Rider" and "Caterpillar"
show the band didn't take them
selves too seriously.
The band only falls flat when at
tempting "we're so stoned" originals
like "Light Is Faster Than Sound"
and "All Is Loneliness." All around,
this charming album holds up quite
well.
"Big Brother and the Holding
Company" was a group effort, with
Joplin sharing vocal duties with An
drew and Albin. By the time the
group recorded "Cheap Thrills" in
1968, it was obvious Joplin was being
pushed as the star. She sings lead on
all but one song and her vocals are
completely over the top, verging at
times on histrionic.
Although the fake "live" atmos
phere (including Bill Graham intro
ducing Joplin as "one great, great
broad") is distracting, and the slop

piness loathed by John Simon cer
tainly remains, the music is still com
pelling and intense.
The interlaced, lysergic guitar
solos on "Summertime" take the
song miles away from "Porgy and
Bess." "Piece of My Heart" is sung
with such passion you'll rip off the
headphones and call up all the
women you've ever wronged and
beg their forgiveness. Big Mama
Thornton's "Ball and Chain" is a
powerful anthem as Joplin explores
the limits of its emotional potential.
The album went to No. 1 and es
tablished Joplin as one of the
strongest female singers in the coun
try. The hype convinced her that she
was too big for Big Brother, and she
left for a solo career.
Janis Joplin sang the blues and
she lived them — reveling in her sex
uality and indulging drink and drugs.
The intensity of her singing wasn't

false; it came from her life. She was
one of the first strong and uncom
promising women of rock, and these

albums are the best tribute to her im
posing talent.
