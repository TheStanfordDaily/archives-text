# 'Murda Muzik'
## Mobb Deep 
### 
Everyone wants to expand their horizons in
order to appeal to a larger audience. This con
cept has been reflected in hip-hop music as
well — Mobb Deep's fourth album marks their effort
to appeal to more listeners.
Normally, such changes can risk the loss of an
artist's core audience. However, such is not the case
for Mobb Deep, also called The Infamous. Mobb
Deep was always known for their hard-edged thuggish
mentality, with no compromise to anything but grim
tales of struggle.
Nonetheless, the Mobb has matured and begun to
reach out to other audiences. The group has kept its
old sound while adding a touch of emotion that would
have never seemed possible from Havoc and Prodigy,
the core of Mobb Deep.
The two best tracks, "Streets Raised Me" and
"Where Ya Heart At," reminisce over lost ones, as the
boys from Queens Bridge seer.iingly pour out their
hearts over the microphone. Prodigy explains: "Have
you ever lost a loved one? / Or never understood love
'til you lost one? / Where your heart at? /1 left mines
behind with my dearly departed / Where your heart
at?/Strength missing/To take losses is the hardest/
The ones that overcome be the calmest / Strive re
gardless / Where your heart at? / Brave-hearted /

Now lets find out where niggaz hearts at."
The album also includes the best hip-hop single to
date of 1999 — "Quiet Storm" — as well as a remix of
the song featuring the Queen Bee, Lil* Kim. Guest ap
pearances help the album reach those who would not
normally enjoy Mobb's music. These tracks include
the Southern style of "Where Ya From." leaturing
Eightball, the gritty arrogance of "It's Mine," featur
ing Nas, and tracks with Lil' Cease and Raekwon.
The release of this album was delayed on several
occasions because of the number of bootlegs that cir
culated in the streets. As a result, Mobb Deep went
back into the studio and recorded five new songs for
the album to provide some new material. The most no
table of these songs is the fast-paced "U.S.A. (Aiight
Then)," a smooth song that fuses wisdom with arro
gance.
The majority of the album was produced by Havoc,
displaying his typical maturity on the boards. The only
problem with "Murda Muzik" is that Mobb Deep tries
too hard to appeal to everyone. Still, the variety which
results from this new approach is nice to hear from a
group with a reputation for being too one-dimension
al.
