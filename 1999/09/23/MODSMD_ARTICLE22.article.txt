## A 						San Francisco Dining Guide Good fortune lurks around all corners 
### Julie Terheyden Contributing writer 
Whether you're looking to
splurge for a special night
out on the town or to grab
a quick bite to eat, whether you're
craving anything from Chinese to
French cuisine, somewhere in San
Francisco there's a restaurant that
will meet your needs. A good one.
Indeed, the city's restaurants reflect
the city's renowned cultural diversi
ty, offering a selection to satisfy a
wide range of tastes and budgets.
Some neighborhoods are recognized
for their specialization in a particular
type of food, while others are known
to contain restaurants whose special
ties vary significantly from one door
to the next. The choices can be over
whelming, especially for people who
aren't too familiar with the area.
What follows is a very informal and
incomplete, yet honest, mix of infor

mation and recommendations from
a lifelong resident of this City by the
Bay.
Downtown / SOMA:
The majority of restaurants in
these areas fall into two categories:
cafe / deli-type places catering to
shoppers and the lunchtime business
crowd, or the city's more upscale,
trendy spots. Currently popular but
very expensive members of the latter
category include Postrio, Aqua and
Masa's. Several restaurants along
the Embarcadero are equally popu
lar and quite good, but more within
the student splurge range (expensive
but not exorbitant). They include the
Italian restaurants II Fornaio and
Palomino, as well as the Californian
style Harry Denton's. AsiaSF, which
is included on the list of the Top 100
area restaurants, has a reputation for
good food and terrific entertainment
— "gender illusionist" waiters do

song and dance routines on the bar.
Slightly less expensive and a perenni
al San Francisco favorite is the Fog
City Diner, which offers some good
views of the waterfront and a fun,
funky decor. For a Benihana-style
dining experience with a sleek mod
ern decor, try the Osaka grill on Sut
ter at Polk.
The Marina / North Beach:
If you're sightseeing at Fisher
man's Wharf, Pier 39 or Coit Tower,
I'd highly recommend eating in the
nearby Marina or North Beach areas
rather than at the over-priced tourist
spots. Though parking is usually dif
ficult in both areas, they have fun at
mospheres and restaurants with ex
cellent food value.
Close to the Golden Gate Bridge
and Fisherman's Wharf, the Marina
District contains a large number of
restaurants centered around Chest
nut Street. Its bustling crowds and as

sortment of shops complement the
variety of restaurants and create a
friendly dining environment. Won
derful, inexpensive Italian food can
be found at Rosti and at Pasta Po
modoro and Fuzio, which specialize
in pasta. Familiar Palo Alto spots
Andale and Pluto's also have loca
tions nearby.
A slight step up in the cost catego
ry, the charming Bistro Aix at Chest
nut and Steiner serves delicious
French food in an intimate setting.
Away from Chestnut Street but still a
Marina highlight at the end of Mari
na Boulevard and Bay, the vegetari
an Green's (also listed in the Top
100) offers quality cuisine as well as
magnificent, romantic views of the
Bay and the Bridge.
If you're in North Beach and like
garlic, try the Stinking Rose. This
longtime San Francisco establish
ment on Columbus Ave. is famous
for including garlic (often lots of it!)

in every dish. Directly across the
street is the charming Steps of Rome,
a cafe that serves inexpensive food
and coffee in a setting that makes
you believe you're in Italy.
Citywide Locations:
Several consistently good and in
expensive restaurants with locations
throughout the City also deserve a
quick mention.
The aforementioned Pasta Po
modoro has additional spots in the
Haight, on Irving and downtown on
Market, Post and California Streets.
Gordo's on 9th and Irving (close to
Golden Gate Park), with locations
on Clement and Geary, makes fabu
lous burritos. The traditional Ameri
can food and '50s decor at Mel's
Diner, which has three locations, has
made it a continual San Francisco fa
vorite.
Happy sampling and bon appetit!
