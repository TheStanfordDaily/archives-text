Nestled in the second-to-last
block of Haight Street lies
the cozy Kan Zaman Cafe,
a distinctive Middle Eastern restau
rant where good food at reasonable
prices combines with a funky decor
to create an enjoyable dining expe
rience. The owner opened the
restaurant in 1992 in order "to cre
ate a cafe that allowed me to share
my culture beyond my circle of
friends." Indeed, Kan Zaman sup
plies this taste of Arabic culture and
does a decent job of achieving its
stated goal to "provide S. F. with a
unique, friendly and reasonably
priced place to eat."
Decorated in an Arabic style,
Kan Zaman's interior is perhaps its
most unique and exciting feature.
The setting alone offers a primary
incentive to dine here. Draped fab
ric creates a tent-like feeling in one

corner of the restaurant. Candles
and dim lighting reflect off the cloth
to cast a relaxing red glow. Painted
maps of the Middle East adorn the
opposite wall. Many of the tables
for two or three sit low to the
ground, and customers can recline
on pillows as they enjoy their meals.
The pillow seating creates a relax
ing and intimate atmosphere (as
shown by a nearby couple, engaged
in an extensive public display of af
fection). Areas for larger groups ei
ther have pillow seating as well, or
maintain the cozy setting with tradi
tional tables ensconced in nooks.
A small bar serves appetizers
and drinks, as well as a novelty for
which Kan Zaman is well-known:
flavored tobacco from hookas. $7-8
buys a bowl of strawberry, apple,
honey or apricot tobacco to be
smoked out of these traditional
Middle Eastern "water pipes."
After dinner hours, hookas can be
brought to the tables. Since we did
not partake in the hooka experi
ence, 1 can only say that it looks like
fun and gives the air a mild, fruit
flavored smell, much like incense.
Though the smoke was certainly
not excessive, we nevertheless de
clined to inquire how the hookas
satisfy San Francisco's new ordi
nance which bans smoking in
restaurants and bars.
According to the menu, the food
has mainly Palestinian / Lebanese

origins and traditional Arabic
spices. In general, the food is quite
good and portions are plentiful. It is
important to note that the menu
caters toward sharing portions with
your fellow diners. Ordering appe
tizer ("maza") combinations and
entrees to share is not only more
cost-efficient but also a good way to
be able to sample more food.
Kan Zaman offers about 15hot
and cold mazas, served with pitas.
Several appetizer combinations en
able diners to sample a number of
them at once. If you plan to order
more than two mazas, the combina
tions provide an economical choice.
For $ 11.50 the two of us chose three
cold mazas and two hot ones. For $4
more or less you can get the corre
sponding amount of mazas.
We decided it was important to
sample the traditional dish of hum
mus, a spread of garbanzo beans, oil
and garlic. Garnished with olives
and carrots, it has a smooth texture
and distinct flavor. The tabouleh, a
spread of parsley, onions, tomatoes
and olive oil, was heavy on the pars
ley taste, but not excessively gar
licky, as it can often be.
Our final and favorite cold maza
was the cup of cucumber yogurt
salad, a flavorful and refreshing
choice (although the cucumber
cubes were slightly too large to be
easily spread on a pita).
With the hot mazas we went

one-for-one in terms of appeal.
Neither of us had ever eaten stuffed
grape leaves before so we can't
claim to have a basis for compari
son, but we did agree that they were
pretty bland. With a filling of
pureed rice, tomatoes, onions, gar
banzo beans and lemon, these egg
roll-sized appetizers were surpris
ingly quite bland and doused in too
much olive oil. By contrast, the
falafel proved an excellent choice.
The portion was large — three fill
ing balls — and the outside coating
had a crunchy texture, while the fill
ing of garbanzo beans (notice a
theme here?) and vegetables had a
fresh and spicy taste.
The entree selection, which stays
in the $8 range, satisfies vegetarian,
meat-eating and health-conscious
palates. Having ordered a large
number of mazas, the two of us
needed only one entree to share.
We selected the marinated chicken
shish kebab, which was served with
rice and vegetables. The ample por
tion had a light, spicy flavor, and the
vegetables were perfectly cooked
and seasoned. Other entrees in
clude beef, lamb or vegetable ke
babs, couscous stews and musaka.
Dessert-lovers will be disap
pointed with the dessert selection,
as there are only three choices. We
asked our waitress' opinion on one
unfamiliar item — sesame extract
dipped in chocolate and walnuts —

and she was honest enough to not
recommend it. Incidentally, the ser
vice was quick and polite.
For a restaurant of its size, Kan
Zaman has a solid beer list, includ
ing five beers on tap and five in the
bottle. The wine list is not nearly as
extensive. In addition to its tradi
tional American beer and wine
lists, Kan Zaman offers a number of
interesting drinks with a Middle
Eastern twist. For a delicious and
unique drink, I highly recommend
the warm spiced wine — a red wine
mixed with a strong dose of cinna
mon and herbs. Arabic coffees and
teas are offered by themselves or in
the non-Middle-Eastern tradition
of lattes, cappuccino, etc. The inclu
sion of Italian sodas in the offerings
amplifies this attempt to main
stream the drink list.
Overall, I'd recommend eating
at Kan Zaman for the sake of trying
something new and interesting (as
suming you don't usually eat Mid
dle Eastern food or at restaurants
with this type of decor). It does not
serve the finest cuisine that will
ever cross your palate, but its bot
tom line is a pretty good deal for a
meal in the city: For around $12 a
person, you will get enjoyable food
and lots of it, as well as an enter
taining atmosphere.
