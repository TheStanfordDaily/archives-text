Whether you're a homesick
East-Coaster nostalgic
for your Hurricane
Floyd, or if you're a West-Coaster
somehow wishing you were on the
East Coast right now, you can get
your temporary monsoon fix at San
Francisco's Tonga Room, located
beneath the ritzy Fairmont Hotel on
Nob Hill.
This pseudo-Polynesian tiki bar
is drenched in tropical kitsch; em
bellished with dozens of tiki torch
es, faux marine life and a large rock
waterfall behind the main bar, the

Tonga Room is the only restaurant /
bar around that "makes" its own in
door thunderstorms every half
hour or so. And if you come at the
right hours, you can also catch
sleazy lounge lizards and awkward
over-the-hill tourists on the dance
floor shaking their money makers to
adult-contemporary renditions of
pop hits (a la Burt Bacharach, Back
street Boys and Ricky Martin), all
belted out by a cheesy lounge band
floating on a bamboo barge inside
the Tonga's own indoor lagoon.
The prices here are steep though,

with entrees starting at $9.25 and
cocktails averaging $8 during regu
lar hours. But at happy hour from 5-
7 p.m., the drinks become half
price, and there's a $5 buffet for all
you-can-eat dim-sum and an assort
ment of deep-fried Chinese-Polyne
sian finger foods.
Tropical concoctions are served
in festive tiki glasses. Try their curi
ously named drinks like "It Takes
Two To Mango" (mango margari
ta), "Tonga Itch" (vodka, rum, or
ange curacao, pineapple juice and
grenadine), the "Scorpion Bowl" or

Write for Intermission

their classic "world-famous" Mai
Tai. It sure beats the "Pacific Pas
sion" at Jamba Juice anytime.
There is a one-drink minimum,
and after 8 p.m., the entertainment
cover is $3. The Tonga Room is
open 365 days a year, opening
everyday at 5 p.m. and closing at
midnight from Sunday-Thursday
and at 1 a.m. on Fridays and Satur
days.
Bottoms Up!
