## A
						retrospective pitching experience Sam Raimi's 'attempt' at a baseball film 
### 
The canon of great baseball
movies will not be making an
addition of "For Love of The
Game." The story is told mostly in
flashbacks as Billy Chapel (Kevin
Costner) begins pitching a perfect
game for what may be his last game
after 19 major-league seasons with
the Detroit Tigers. The flashback
structure feels so awkward that, at
times, I laughed at the cuts. It's un

fortunate that the director. Sam
Raimi has stopped pushing the film
medium.
This is not to say that no inter
esting techniques are used — just
no innovative ones. Raimi's "Evil
Dead." which received a standing
ovation at Cannes in '81, is one of
the most exquisite and creative hor
ror films I've ever seen. Don't even
think about comparing his nearly

20-year-old work to his iatesL
ing.
Often, with "For Love of the
Game,' one can leel kainii lov
fo! baseball through hi ovt
whelmingly complimentary camera
placement. However, this film does
not unearth the soul of baseball and
the deceased-father-son relation
ship the way that greater films such
as "Field of Dreams" or "The Nat
ural' do. You never smell the grass
or teel inspired in this film. In fact,
through Billy's on-field pondering
about the wreckage of his personal
life, one begins to wonder what's so
great about baseball, and the film
never satisfyingK intorms us.
A large portion of this film in
volves a poorly illustrated romance
between Billy Chapel and Jane
Aubrey (Kelly Preston). The main
problem Billy faces with his turbu
lent love life is that Jane does not
feel needed — she thinks that Billy
and the diamond are perfect b\
themselves. Billy's act of pitching a
perfect game while contemplating
his life counters Jane's argument in

a uniqui but imperfect way. To
pitch this idyllic game requires Billy
to hav grown, experienced and
consi< ! "red all that has happened to
hin However, it's hard to believe
that anyone could achieve great
ness through their lazily construct
ed romance.
And, if the message from this
film's juxtaposition of love and
achievement is that achievements
are empty should you have no one
to share them with .. . well, we
have all heard that before.
The introduction of a multitude
of subjects prevents the movie from
being categorized in a limiting way
The film's brief discussion regard
ing how, athletes might feel about
having their blunders repeatedly
shown on stations such as ESPN, or
sold on home videos for their
comedic merit, works quite effec
tively.
However, such short looks begin
to feel sloppy when the film hastily
touches on issues of teenage preg

mer teen mom, is now in her 30s
and has a daughter in college. AI
beit underdeveloped, finding i
mother-daughter relationship in i
film dealing with baseball was excit
ing.
Perhaps the most intriguing as
pect of the film is its invitation for
us to approach the "loneliest place
on earth," namely the pitching
mound at Yankee Stadium. Creat
ing an experience of a pitcher's
thoughts and his body-language di
alogues with the batters is enter
taining.
Dealing with a pitiable script,
Costner does an admirable job of
creating a character whom you
never really figure out but are able
to watch grow. "For Love of the
Game" is enjoyable in a mediocre
sort of way.
