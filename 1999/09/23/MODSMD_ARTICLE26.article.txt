# 'Stigmata' lacks the sting to scare
## Cinematography and thematic material can't make up for weak story 
### 
A Gothic's heaven, "Stigmata" is an
extended version of Madonna's
"Like a Prayer" video — an attempt
to both glorify and question the Catholic
Church while scaring the pants off you. There
would not be anything to argue about the
controversiality of this film had Rupert
Wainwright done a respectable job at carry
' Stigmata'
Gabriel Byrne, Patricia Arquette
103 minutes
Rated R
ing out the story. But there is little more than
fake blood and religious iconography to
scare the audience.
Patricia Arquette does a good job at play
ing a normal (and somewhat boring) hair
dresser named Frankie who becomes stig
matic because she has come into contact with
a possessed rosary. When the notably sexy
Father Andrew Kearnan (Gabriel Byrne)
hops down to Philadelphia from the Vatican
to investigate her case, he begins to discover
secrets about the history of "The Bible" and
finds cause to question the foundations of the
religion that has been holding his pants on for
so long. The sexual tension between the two
seems false because there is no real chemistry

between the shallow, ditzy Frankie and the
overly educated, serious Father.
There is an obvious effort on Wain
wright's part to make this a cinematographi
callv impressive film, with interesting plays
on light, color and imagery. But after two
hours of bright flashes and repetitive im
agery, the viewer has sore eyes and is either
asleep or pissed off.
What is frustrating is that fundamentally
the underlying message of "Stigmata" is ex
tremely interesting and could have been
woven into a powerful piece of film. While
questioning the Catholic Church, which
many have done in the past, Wainwright at
tempts to give this questioning an unusual
edge by suggesting that true religion does not
need to be housed in a church, and that Jesus'
words have been hidden by the Catholic
Church for their own selfish purposes.
Unfortunately, the mix of proposing an
entirely new philosophy and also attempting
to scare the audience out of their minds came
together like oil and water. Although "Stig
mata" makes an obvious effort to be fright
ening and on the cutting edge, it is definitely
a waste of $8.25.
