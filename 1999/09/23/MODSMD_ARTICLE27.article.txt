## An American work of art Bening and Spacey power this dark analysis of family life 
### 
/ A merican Beauty" really is an American beauty. This
/\ dark comedy about the life of the Burnham family is
X \.one of the best movies to hit the silver screen this
year.
Much like "Election" and "Rushmore," "American Beauty" is
about the isolation of peo
'American Beaut/ pie who once used to be
Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening happy. Disenchanted by
122 minutes his family life, Lester
Rated R Burnham (Kevin Spacey)
— hits his mid-life crisis and
starts to revolt against everything making his life boring. The
biggest obstacle to his happiness seems to be his money-grubbing
wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), who is so occupied trying to keep
up appearances that she hasn't had time to enjoy herself in ages.
Lester telling his family about his tough day at work and find
ing no support is the ultimate example of his isolation, even
from the ones he believes he is close to. Carolyn can only think
about her real-estate business that is being blown out of the
water by the competition, and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is
not interested in either one of her parents with whom she hasn't
seriously talked in months. Jane mostly worries about her dad
behaving too much "like a horny teenager who'll spray his

pants" as soon as she brings home one of her girlfriends.
The excellent pacing of "American Beauty" is partly
achieved by looking at both the lives of the Burnhams as well as
their new neighbors, the Fitts. As the movie approaches its cli
max, the interaction between the two dysfunctional families
leads to some surprising conclusions that make this film even
more memorable.
"American Beauty" is rife with sexual themes that may be
shocking to some viewers. From a middle-aged man lusting
after a teenager to homophobia and quick sex in the motel, this
film seems to cover it all. While the Burnhams may seem per
fectly happy and normal people to outsiders, each family mem
ber is driven to find happiness in some way, whether moral or
not.
Hollywood is already saying that this film will be a serious
player at this year's Oscars. This is no surprise considering the
excellent script as well as the terrific performances from Bening
and Spacey. Carolyn's explosive emotions and Lester's calm but
deliberate actions are beautifully portrayed by both actors.
With yet another summer of mindless action blockbusters
behind us, "American Beauty" is a welcome change of pace.
This is definitely a film you should see.
