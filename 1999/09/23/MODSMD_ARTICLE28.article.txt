'Black Cat, White Cat'
Bajram Severdzan, S. Todorovic
135 minutes
Rated R

Despite a slow and somewhat
alienating beginning to
"Black Cat, White Cat,"
the entire audience left this Yu
goslavian masterpiece, directed by
Emir Kusturica, with enormous

grins on their faces. You will too, es
pecially if you enjoy anything by
Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Fellini,
because this is one wacky, surreal
and dizzying romp full of joie de
vivre and magical realism. Walking
trees, pigs who eat cars, and dwarfs
and giants in love — need I say
more?
The film follows four families
and their passionate attempts to at
tain lots of money and marry off
their children. The story begins with
Matko, a dim-witted, gold-toothed
thief who is hatching a plan to create
riches out of nothing. His idea is
foiled when one of his investors, the
coke-snorting, 100-pound-gold
chain-wearing disco man Dadan,
double-crosses him and steals his
money and profits. Dadan wants
Matko's son, Zare, to marry his tem
peramental dwarf sister, Afrodita.
Zare, in the meantime, has fallen in
love with the wild gypsy Ida, who is
in the process of being sold off as a
wife to Dadan. With this plot and
subtle visual details in every frame,
it is difficult to imagine anything
other than chaos, which is what this
film embodies.
The antagonists are the clowns of
"Black Cat, White Cat," and they

create the most laughs as they fall
through ceilings, off of large ships,
and into sewage containers. There is
a Chaplin-like sense of timing and
folly in this film, as everything
moves at a lightning pace with per
fect (however offbeat) timing. Per
haps the most delightful characters
in the film are the eccentric, wealthy
grandfathers Grga and Zarije, who
decide to die in order to put off wed
dings and live in a 50-year-old car
that is situated in a house-like larger
car that is, in turn, housed in a boat
(among other things).
Full of gypsy music, local humor
and rustic images of rural Yugosla
vian life, "Black Cat, White Cat"
also gives the audience an interest
ing and sometimes startlingly hon
est view of life in a gypsy communi
ty along the Danube. The film ere

ates thought-provoking juxtaposi
tions that end up blending together
by the film's conclusion — love with
greed and corruption, joy with
abundant poverty and marriage
with death.
Despite the fact that every char
acter in the film has serious flaws,
the ending leaves almost all of them
(and the audience) with a taste of
care-free happiness and a renewed
faith in the fate that controls love
and money. Underneath all the
ruckus and trickery, "Black Cat,
White Cat" is really a love story that
reminds us that soul mates can be
found in the oddest of places, and
that joy can sometimes be better ex
pressed with local color and subti
tles than with millions of Hollywood
dollars.
