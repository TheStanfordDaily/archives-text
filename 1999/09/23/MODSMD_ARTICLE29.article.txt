## Visit San Francisco 
### 
Ladies and gentlemen of the
Stanford Gass of 2003: Visit
San Francisco.
If I could offer you only one tip
for the future, S. F. would be it. Palo
Alto doesn't have much that isn't
boring, expensive or snooty, where
as San Francisco has everything you
could ever want in a city — great
restaurants, a kaleidoscope of enter
tainment and the most beautiful
views in the world. This has been
confirmed by the media and in
movies such as "The Rock," where
as the rest of my advice has no basis
more reliable than my own mean
dering experience. I will dispense
this advice now.
Enjoy the power and beauty of
the Internet. Oh, never mind. You
will not understand the power and
beauty of the Internet until your
freshman roommate has landed a
six-figure salary in Information
Technology, while you're stuck
nursing a five-hour-a-week Internet
addiction. But trust me, in five years,
you'll look back at yourself and re
call in a way you can't grasp now how
many jobs there are in Silicon Valley
and how much you should have
learned about computers. You are
not as technically inept as you think.
Now is the time to think about the
future. Don't worry, for worrying
about the future is as effective as try
ing to register for golf during the af
ternoon. Then again, at least you
won't be blindsided on some idle
Tuesday by a stray golf ball.
And don't feel guilty if you
haven't declared a major. The most
interesting people I know didn't
know freshman year what they
wanted to do with their lives, and
most 40-year-olds I know still don't.
But think seriously about the fu
ture, for college is a time for finding
yourself, and that includes what
you'll do for the huge chunk of life
between graduation and retirement.
Do one thing every day that
scares you, but wear a helmet, use a
condom and have friends who can
bail you out at a moment's notice.
Sing. Note I did not say, "Join an
a cappella group."
Don't be reckless with other peo
ple's hearts. Don't put up with peo
ple who are reckless with yours. This
especially applies during your fresh
man year. If you can learn from the
mistakes of others during this
time — not only in relationships, but
with studying, drugs, alcohol and
other addictions — it will be easier
than making your own. Believe me,
either way, there'll be a lot to learn.
Sleep. Especially in Dement's
"Sleep and Dreams" class.

Don't waste your time on jeal
ousy. Some people will find Stanford
a bear, while others will find it a
breeze. Some people will be "in"for
the first time in their lives, while oth
ers will find it hard to be "out." The
race is long, and in the end, it's only
with yourself (and Berkeley).
Remember the constructive criti
cism and helpful hints. Forget the ru
mors. If you succeed in doing this,
write a book and make millions.
Keep your old frosh face book.
Throw away your old tuition bills.
Stretch. Here you can even take a
course to learn how to do it right.
Drink plenty of liquids before frat
parties.
Cultivate your sanity. You'll miss
that during finals week.
Maybe you'll graduate with hon
ors, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll
get into med school, maybe you
won't. Maybe you'll be an engineer,
maybe you'll be a drama major with
a minor in cognitive development.
Either way, you could end up de
signing Web pages or helping to find
the cure for mental illness. Or both.
Whatever you do, don't congrat
ulate or berate yourself too much.
Your choices are half chance. That's
the scary part. The scarier part is that
the rest is up to you.
Join the Band.
Enjoy your body. Use it every
way you can. Well, maybe wait 'til
your second year to use it EVERY
way you can (as previously noted).
After all, it's the greatest instrument
you'll ever own, and you only have
one in this lifetime.
Dance, even if you have nowhere
to do it but in your one-room double.
Fill out a four-year plan, just
don't plan on following it.
Do not read the Chaparral. It just
isn't that funny.
Get to know your professors.
You're paying for their expertise,
and they can help with classes, ca
reers and crises. They can also give
recommendations for RAs, TAs,
grad school, med school and that
NSA job you always wanted.
Be nice to your dormmates.
They're your best link to your past
and quite possibly could be the peo
ple you work with in the future.
Understand that friends come
and go, but with a precious few,
you'll have pals for life. Work hard to
bridge the gaps in studies and
lifestyle, because the older you get,
the more you need the people who
knew you when your purity lest
score was 95.
Visit Berkeley, but leave before it
makes you too hard or too soft.
Travel. The year overseas is not

required, though, in spite of what
others may lead you to believe.
Accept certain inalienable truths:
Tuition will rise; the ASSU will phi
lander, you, too, will graduate (or
drop out). And when you do, you'll
fantasize that when you were a fresh
man, book prices were reasonable,
the ASSU wasn't a joke and you re
spected your academic duties.
Respect your academic duties.
But don't get carried away. This is
four years of your life; it should be

spent living.
Date. If you succeed in doing this
at Stanford, tell me how.
Don't expect anyone to support
you. Maybe you have a scholarship,
maybe you have wealthy parents.
But you never know when you might
fall out of favor with either one.
Don't mess too much with your
course schedule, or by the time
you're a senior, you'll look like
you're 40.
Be careful whose advice you buy,

especially if it comes off the Internet.
The duty of Stanford University is to
educate you, and whether that be
through classes, experience or advice
— and whether it's your parents, a
college fund, a job or a scholarship
paying for you — you should take
advantage of every opportunity.
But trust me on San Francisco.
