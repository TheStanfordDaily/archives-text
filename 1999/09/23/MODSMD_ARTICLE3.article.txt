# Big Game: Got big bucks?
## Ticket prices rank as nation's steepest 
### Jed Rose Contributing writer 
The Stanford-California Big
Game can be called the creme de la
creme of college rivalries. The clas
sic match-up is among the oldest in
football rivalries and draws the
proudest of alumni from far and
wide to witness the annual event.
But attending the highly-antici
pated game comes with a price tag
higher than any other college foot
ball matchup.
Big Game ticketsgo for $50 a seat
for non-students, and the one game
alone costs more than Stanford sea
son ticket rates, which start at $35.
For students. Big Game tickets go
for $17.
"The $50 fee was put in by both
Cat and Stanford four years ago."
said Bob Carruesco. Stanford's as
sistant athletic director for market
ing.
Other traditional rivalries don't
come with such a steep price. Ac
cording to Bob Bartosch.ol the Har
vard Ticket Office, the Harvard-
Vale game costs $25 a ticket and of
fers a $12 ticket price to undergrad
uates for the matchup.
"When you look at the big pic
ture it's a little distorted." explained
Carruesco. "Our main goal was to
use this as an incentive to sell more
season tickets."
"After two wins in the [Pacific 10
Conference], and lICLA coming in.
we should see an increase in atten

dance," said Carruesco. referring to
the jump in the present home game
attendance over last year. "The
strongest factor is the success of the
team on the field."
The heavy ticket price also goes
toward funding specially prepared
halftime shows.
"The last year that we had (Big
Game] we put on a dazzling halftime
show. What we try to do is provide
the best entertainment we can.
There is a balance we are striving to
achieve." said Carruesco.
The Stanford Athletic Depart
ment offers a flat $10 rate for all
other games, a per-game cost that is
cheaper than home games at most

Ivy League colleges.
"It ranges. The different games
are different prices." said Bartosch,
saying that Harvard home football
games within the Ivy League confer
ence range from $10 to $ 15. depend
ing on the opponent.
Some are simply frustrated with
the dramatic difference between the
cost of a ticket for a regular-season
game and the cost of Big Game. "1
think it's smart business but bad for
school pride." said sophomore An
drew Macdonald. " The one game
everyone gets up for. they're going
to gouge us for."

A large billboard featuring the "S2K" logo promotes Stanford foot
ball. Tickets for Big Game this year are $50 apiece, the most expen
sive college football seats in the nation.
At least one thing seems to he
agreed upon: Stanford vs. Califor
nia is a mateh huilt on a rieh tradi
tion. with a history of close games
and a discounting of any pre-game
odds. For many Stanford students,
their school pride has no price limit.
"I want to go and show support
for the team with m\ dorm," said
Ireshman ('hristine I'ham. a season
ticket holder. "And after that. I'm
going to go to the soccer game.
It seems students and alumni can
rest assured that a ticket price hike
will probably not be in the near fu
ture.
"I would say ticket prices won't
go up, and they probably won't go
down because the overall market is
pretty competitive," Carruesco
added.
"That's something we look at on
an ongoing basis. We adjusted our
ticket prices down for regular seats
this season. We always take the tem
perature for what's going on with
the public and communitv." he said.
