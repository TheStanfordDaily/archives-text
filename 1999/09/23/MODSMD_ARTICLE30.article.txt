# Shadows from the past
## Noir masterpiece returns to the big screen

They could never make a movie like "The Third
Man" today. First of all, no studio would allow an
entire movie soundtrack to be played on the
zither, and there is no actor around with Orson Welles'
particular talent. But the big reason why this film could
not be made today is that you would have to reduce large
sections of a major European city to rubble in order to
film it. Shot on location in Vienna immediately after the
Second World War, "The Third Man" is a brilliantly
crafted noir thriller, a compelling story of loyalty and
friendship, and a thoughtful post-War allegory.
Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), a pulp author of no
real talent, arrives in Vienna at the invitation of his old
friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) only to find that
Harry recently died. Holly soon comes to believe that
Harry's demise might not have been an accident, and in
the course of investigating the death, he falls for Harry's
old lover, Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli). At the same time,

he is also confronted with evidence,
presented by military policeman
Major Calloway (Trevor Howard),
that Harry was involved in racketeer
ing and other illegal activities.
As he unravels the mystery of
Harry's death, Holly eventually has to
choose between morality and loyalty
to his fatally flawed friend — between,
if you will, good and evil. All around
him, in the rubble-strewn streets of Vi
enna and in the faces of the impover
ished people who live there, is evi
dence of the destruction evil can bring.
By extension, Holly's decision is the
one that has to be made by Western
civilization in order to rebuild itself
following the devastation of World
War 11.
Graham Greene's subtle screen
play, though, makes the choice less
than clear. Welles is only briefly on
screen, but as the entire plot revolves
around him, he dominates the film
even in his absence. Welles' screen
presence is electrifying, and his charis
ma is such that even after you, like
Holly Martins, have been confronted
with Harry Lime's evil side, you can
not help but like him. He's cynical,
greedy, selfish and manipulative, but in
some ways, he's the most appealing

character in the film.
Major Calloway is up
tight as well as upright
and humorless to boot.
Holly Martins is a
dope: a hack writer with a propensity for sweater vests
and a sloppy drunk who can't score with the ladies. Harry
Lime, on the other hand, is smooth, assured and funny.
Never has evil been so appealing on screen.
Director Carol Reed and cinematographer Robert
Krasker expertly use black-and-white and location film
ing, and the use of music and sound contributes to the
total mood of each scene. The first on-screen appearance
of Harry Lime and the long shot that ends the film have
become part of cinema history.
This is noir filmmaking at its peak. Driven by com
pelling characters and an engaging plot, "The Third
Man" is full of power, emotion, wit and — yes — zither
music.
