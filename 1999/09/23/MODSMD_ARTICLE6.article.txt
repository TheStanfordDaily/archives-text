## Federal government files lawsuit against tobacco industry 
### 
J WASHINGTON (AP) — The
J Justice Department sued the
\ nation's tobacco industry Wednes
day. seeking billions of dollars
spent treating smoking-related ill
nesses and accusing cigarette-mak
ers of a 45-year campaign of deceit
'"to preserve their enormous prof
its whatever the cost in human
lives."
"They placed profits above the
public health." Attorney General
Janet Reno said as her department
filed a civil suit in U.S. District
Court against the major cigarette
makers and research and public
relations institutes they funded.
"The cigarette companies realized
4

— at least since 1953 — that the
truth poses a mortal threat to their
businesses."
The lawsuit alleged the compa
nies have conspired since the 1950s
to defraud and mislead the public.
The industry concealed data that
showed nicotine is addictive and
smoking causes disease, sponsored
and publicized biased research and
suppressed development of safer
cigarettes in violation of federal
anti-racketeering law, the suit
alleged.
"Smoking is the nation's largest
preventable cause of death and dis
ease, and American taxpayers
should not have to bear ... the

staggering costs," Reno said. Fed
eral health plans spend more than
$20 billion a year treating smoking
related illnesses, which take
400,000 lives a year, she said.
President Bill Clinton said "the
tobacco companies should answer
to the taxpayers for their actions.
The taxpayers of our country
should have their day in court."
Company spokesmen ques
tioned the government's legal
arguments and motives. They
promised to fight in court rather
than settle, as they did in agreeing
last year to pay state governments
more than $200 billion over 25
years.

"This blatantly political lawsuit
is ... the height of hypocrisy"
given how long ago the govern
ment warned of health dangers
from smoking, said Greg Little,
associate general counsel of Philip
Morris, the nation's largest
cigarette maker.
The state lawsuits involved
Medicaid payments the states
made to the poor. The federal suit
involves Medicare for the elderly
and military and veterans health
insurance paid directly by the fed
eral government.
The lawsuit names Philip Morris
Inc.; Philip Morris Companies; R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co.; American

Tobacco Co.; Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp.; British-American
Tobacco P.L.C.; British-American
Tobacco (Investments) Ltd.; Loril
lard Tobacco Co. Inc.; Liggett and
Myers Inc.; the Council for Tobac
co Research U.S.A. Inc., and the
Tobacco Institute Inc.
"For decades, they repeatedly
and consistently denied that smok
ing cigarettes causes disease
despite their knowledge that it
does ... denied that cigarettes are
addictive even though they have
long known and deliberately
exploited the addictive properties
of nicotine," Ogden said.
The lawsuit said Brown &

Williamson decided to withhold its
research on nicotine addictiveness
from the U.S. surgeon general
when he was preparing his first
warning about smoking and health
in 1963.
When the surgeon general final
ly concluded in 1988 that nicotine is
addictive, the Tobacco Institute
attacked the report saying the
"claims that cigarettes are addic
tive contradict common sense," the
suit noted.
"We will not settle," said Little,
of Philip Morris.
The National Association of
Manufacturers issued a statement
supporting the industry.
