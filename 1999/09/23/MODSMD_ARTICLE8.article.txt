						importance of privacy

Heavy implications
not considered by
Web site creators

It has recently been brought to
light that three undergraduate
students created a Web site
(http://steamtunnels.net) that features
an online version of the Stanford
Facebook. They were instructed by
Dean of Students Marc Wais to
remove the Facebook pictures in
response to privacy and copyright
concerns.
Drunken Master, DJ Monkey and
The Sultan, who asked to be referred
to by their computer nicknames,
placed the freshman photographs
from the last four Facebooks on the
Web without asking permission of the
University or individual students.
How ironic that three students who
are so concerned about their own pri
vacy should think so lightly about the
privacy of nearly 7,000 people.
There's a reason why the Stanford
Facebook is only distributed to fresh
men. Particularly when dealing with a
publication that can motivate roman
tic or sexual interest, students can be
just as dangerous as people off cam
pus.
There's the case of "Oscar," the
nickname of an individual who sexu
ally harassed females over the phone
by taking Stanford Directory infor
mation. Although a man was arrested
in Palo Alto this year as a primary
suspect in these crimes, it doesn't dis
count the possibility that "Oscar"
could also be a student. The Directo
ry is a Stanford-only publication.
The Web site's creators argue that
they took measures to protect Face
book and Whois directory informa
tion from anyone outside of the Stan
ford community. Given the reality of

harassment incidents, such measures
are not enough.
From the Federal government
down to community publications, our
country's laws and policies insist on
the use of "prior consent" when deal
ing with privacy issues. It's important
that one be aware of any information
that is available to the public, as with
Stanford's Axess system.
Prior consent is even more of a
problem with a publication that is dis
tributed in part by word of mouth. In
Axess, students are instructed to
update their privacy information
when they register for classes, a nec
essary step in being a Stanford stu
dent. 'Hie creators of the Steamtun
nels Web site claim to have consid
ered requesting prior consent, but
they passed it up because it would
take too long to get the attention of all
undergraduates.
Drunken Master, IXI Monkey and
The Sultan have complained that the
University is treating them harshly.
On the other hand, Wais and his col
leagues must take a minimal amount
of action lo protect the lights of stu
dents. I lie Web site's creators don't
seem to reali/e how fortunate they
are that the University is still open lo
the idea of keeping the online Face
book alive.
It is rather distressing that I)J
Monkey and Hie Sultan intended to
be Advising Associates this year.
Those who would like to be leaders
and role models al Stanford ought to
carefully review their actions in and
out of the classroom.
Let this occurrence be a lesson to
us all. In this age of free information,
we really need to consider the many
consequences of Internet publica
tions, even if they mean no harm on
the surface. We should be glad that
this ended with faculty reprimands
and nothing more serious.
