Crimes of the pronouns
The Daily's editorial on Sept. 21 was
doing a fairly good job of gushing the oh-so
trite and necessary qualities of Stanford's
next president until it got to the end.
How ironic that in one sentence The
Daily states that, " The president must help
to foster an environment that is tolerant of
and sensitive to the viewpoints and hack
grounds of all Stanford community mem
bers," and then proceeds to follow that up
with, "He must be able to represent the
needs and concerns of the entire Stanford
Community."
I don't recall reading in the job descrip
tion that the president of Stanford had to be
a man. In fact, according to the title of your
piece, a person would do just fine.

What a fine way for I lie Daily to present
itself to the new students, faculty, and stall
of Stanford (yes. there are more than just
undergraduates here!). I'o borrow from the
editorial's choice of words, intolerant and
insensitive seem to lit just well with I he
Daily. I lere's a new one how about just
plain bad?

Don't forget inner space
Twenty years ago or so a very talented
student in my French Novel class was strug
gling with the onset of blindness and went
temporarily mad. In a word, I believed in
him and abided with him. and his mother

wrote me, "You saved his life." Just now.
after a 20-year silence, lie wrote to thank
me. including a copy of his page in the alum
ni annual, where he listed me among his
Fondest Memories because of my "love of
French literature." lie has become an exec
utive with a big corporation and plans to
retire soon and write.
I shamelessly pass this on for those "with
ears to hear." I've had quite a few needy
youngsters like that in my classes. Mind you,
I usually like the cheerful, normal ones too.
but. after all. aren't the "ugly ducklings" the
ones our hearts go out to most and who turn
out to be, like Emily Dickinson and Abe
Lincoln and Charles Johnson, the authors
of practically all that is especially beautiful
and inspiring in our culture?
So while all the talk is about a billion
dollar building program, a huge basketball

pavilion, an enlarged shopping mall and the
attendant problem of maintaining "open
space," I wonder, "What about inner
space?"
One can sympathize with outer expan
sion up to a point, but who speaks for the
true University mission now?
Big popular courses don't do it. nor
does the perennially revenant freshman
seminar program designed to mask the
unlovely fact that modern profs tend to
lose contacts with the students. In my
experience, a drowning youngster finds
his, or her. own path to a quiet individual
professor who will help keep one's head
above water and offer the revelation of a
promising Way.
