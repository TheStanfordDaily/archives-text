MORE ABOUT TEACHING!
In California, a Single Subject Teaching Credential authorizes you to teach a spe
cific subject in a departmentalized class. To earn one, you are legally required to
verify your subject matter competence. The way for Stanford students to do this is
to pass the Commission-adopted examinations, which are the appropriate Single
Subject Assessments for Teaching (SSAT) test(s), and the Praxis Series test(s) for
the subject area you wish to teach.
The 1999-2000 test registration bulletins are available at the STEP
Office in CERAS 309, the Cubberley Building's Academic Services
area, and at the Undergraduate Advising Center.
See below for general registration deadlines.
