JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) —
A wave of violent student protests
swept across Indonesia on Thurs
day after Parliament rubber
stamped a bill allowing the mili
tary to revoke civil liberties in
"emergency situations."
Reporters and protesters said
three demonstrators were killed in
clashes with riot police in the capi
tal. Jakarta. Officials and hospitals
could not confirm the death toll.
A total of 53 people were
injured, the SCTV network report
ed. At least four were rushed to
hospital with bullet wounds, while
other bloodstained protesters were
taken to a makeshift clinic at near
by Atma Java University.
"This government wants the
military to take over everything,"
said Dani Syahrir. a 21-vear-old
computer technology student.
"We, the students of Indonesia,
absolutely reject that because it
means the death of democracy."
About 5,000 protesters clashed
with police on a highway leading
to Parliament.
Cordons of riot police, carrying
shields and wearing cumbersome
protective gear, fired rubber bul
lets and volleys of tear-gas canis
ters, clubbing demonstrators and
passers-by whom they managed to
corner.
Protesters pelted police with
stones, bottles and firebombs, and
at least five officers reportedly suf
fered burns. Several police cars
were torched. Demonstrators also
ripped out metal highway dividers,
bending them to block one of the
city's main arteries.
"We must destroy the Suharto-
Habibie-Wiranto regime!" shout
ed a student who only gave his
name as Handono.
President Suharto, who ruled
with an iron fist for 32 years, was
ousted last year amid massive pro
democraev protests and was
replaced by protege B.J. Habibie.
Army commander Gen. Wiranto
sponsored the new security hill.
Last year's outpouring of dis
content was largely sparked by the
killing of several pro-democracy
supporters in initial demonstra
tions. so the reports of deaths
raised concerns about the future.
Thousands of protesters took to
the streets in the country's second
largest city, Surabaya, and hun
dreds rallied on the resort island of
Bali.

Some 300 students marched on
the governor's office in the vio
lence-wracked province of Aceh.
smashing windows and fighting
with police.
Similar protests occurred in
Semarang. Ujung Pandang and
Yogjakarta.
In Jakarta, demonstrations con
tinued into the night, with
protesters and police blocking key
downtown avenues and exchang
ing volleys of rubber bullets and
Molotov cocktails.
The security bill gives the mili
tary more power to handle what it

considers "emergency situations."
Rut many Indonesians, who have
supported the country's recent
hard-won democratic reforms, are
adamantly opposed to the mea
sure.
It allows the military to ban
protests, take over the telecommu
nications system and mail service,
and ignore existing laws guaran
teeing human rights once a state of
emergency is proclaimed.
The military's near-total control
over Indonesian society has been
slipping since the downfall of
Suharto's armv-backed dictator

ship.
Analysts said hard-line generals
want to shore up their position
ahead of the inauguration of the
new Parliament — Indonesia's
first democratically elected legisla
ture in 44 years — and the election
of a head of state in November.
The current Parliament, whose
term expires this week, is dominat
ed by right-wing allies of the
armed forces.
"The bill will be enacted not to
serve the interests of the military
but to safeguard the unity of the
nation." Wiranto said.
