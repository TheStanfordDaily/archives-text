# Support for Cuban embargo dwindles
## 
### 
NKW YORK (AP) — Cuba is heartened by
what it sees as a growing opposition in the Unit
ed States to the nearly 40-year-old embargo —
as evidence by a recent congressional push to
ease the sanctions, Cuba's foreign minister
says.
But in an interview with executives and edi
tors of The Associated Press, Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque expressed concern that the
effort to allow exports of U.S. food and drugs to
Cuba might actually hurt its chances of having
the entire embargo abolished.
"There is a danger that public opinion would
consider that with the authorization of the sale
of food and medicine to Cuba, everything
would be resolved," he said Wednesday.
"But we would have to clarify that that is not
the case," he said. "The embargo is much big
ger than that."
Hopes for an easing of the restrictions
appeared dashed on Thursday after a House-
Senate conference committee stalemated as it
drafted the legislation on an agricultural spend
ing bill.
The Senate last month overwhelmingly
backed an amendment to the farm bill that
would allow licensing of food and drug exports
to Cuba.
American farm groups and agribusinesses
had lobbied Congress to ease the embargo so
they could gain access to the nearby Cuban
market and sell off some of the glut of grain
that has depressed commodity prices for the

second year in a row.
In the interview. Perez Roque said any such
legislation would be a step forward since it
showed the growing opposition across the I Unit
ed States to the embargo.
"We support it." lie said. "We see it as a
positive symbol."
Perez Roque. 34. discussed the legislation in
a wide-ranging interview at A I' headquarters
ahead of his address Friday to the IJ.N. Gener
al Assembly. It will be his first speech to world
leaders gathered for the annual U.N. debate
since he was named foreign minister in May.
The surprise appointment capped a rapid
rise in Cuba's communist hierarchy for Perez
Roque. who became a member of the Commu
nist Party Central Committee in IWI — at the
age of 26. I le spent the last eight years oversee
ing the personal schedule ol Cuban President
F idel Castro.
In the interview. Perez Roque focused heav
ily on Cuba's desire for an end to the embargo,
which Washington has maintained since 1%1 in
an attempt to compel Castro to undertake
democratic reforms. Last week. Cuba's Nation
al Assembly called it an act of genocide.
The foreign minister said it was incredible
that the United States could ease sanctions on
Vietnam and North Korea — but maintain
them on Cuba because of what he said was
political pressure from a small group ol Cuban
exiles in southern Florida.
"It cannot be understood that the North

American policy toward Cuba is today hostage
to a small group of interests in the United
States that constitute practically a municipali
ty." he said.
Hie policy, he said, "neither expresses the
opinion of the majority of Americans nor
reflects the national interests of the United
States."
Perez Roque said he was heartened hv what
he considered growing opposition to the
embargo in much of the United States. He
noted that a stream of U.S. lawmakers and farm
group representatives have recently visited
Cuba and signaled their support for the new
food-and-drug sale legislation.
In the W-minute discussion, Perez Roque
also called for the U.N. Security Council to be
expanded to include more permanent represen
tation from the developing world and repeated
Cuba's opposition to NATO's air campaign
against Yugoslavia.
Cuba, along with Russia. China and many
developing nations, condemned NATO's
strikes because they were launched without
explicit approval from the U.N. Security Coun
cil.
"I understand that the North American pub
lic opinion doesn't see these dangers" of coun
tries taking unilateral action against others.
Perez Roque said. "No one imagines that a
coalition of countries would begin to bomb
New York because they believe that (Ameri
cans) don't respect human rights."
