Failure to report
drug thefts erodes
public confidence

The recent allegations that a nurse
at Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital has been stealing pain â€”
relieving drugs intended for cancer
patients is disturbing for a number of
reasons.
According to reports, in some
instances the nurse replaced the
stolen vials of medication with saline.
The potential for harm to the patient
by a doctor prescribing an additional
dose of narcotics (because of the
apparent ineffectiveness of the first
dose) is too obvious to mention.
Of course, there's also the issue of a
gross violation of trust by a health
care worker at one of the most vul
nerable moments in a person's life.
However, it is equally worrisome
that the hospital failed to notify the
California Department of Health Ser
vices of the theft immediately follow
ing the incidents. It seems that Health
Department Officials were only made
aware after a hospital employee tiled
a formal complaint. State law requires
that hospitals and nursing homes
inlorni the Department of any drug
thefts that may occur.
" ITiey have to notify us of anything
that affects the health and safety of
their patients," said Albert Quintero,
chief ol the Health Services Depart
ment, in the San Jose Mercury News.
"This was a diversion of narcotics.
This is a felony. Certainly we need to
know."
Hospital officials contend, howev
er, that the thefts posed no risk to
patients. Iliey claim that on the first
occasion, the vials were found to have
been tampered with and were subse

quently discarded. The second time,
the supplies were found to have been
missing, thus ruling out any possiblity
of administering the medication to
patients. In addition, the police were
contacted and internal hospital drug
control procedures were upgraded.
Despite the hospital's assurances, it
remains to be seen why it took the
complaint of an employee, nearly a
month later, for the Department of
Health Services to find out.
Instances like these and the con
taminated needle scare at the
SmithKline Beecham lab on Welch
Road this past May will only serve to
worsen public anxieties about the
safety of their medical and health ser
vices. It provides little comfort to the
families of patients at the Children's
Hospital that such a trusted and well
respected establishment failed to fol
low a simple procedure mandated by
California law.
It is understandable that this issue
wasn't immediately publicized. And it
is laudable that safety procedures
have been tightened.
However, Packard officials need to
provide a clear ejypjaination for why
there seems to have been no commu
nication between themselves and the
Department of Health. Perhaps they
were intending to notify the Depart
ment after the matter came under
control. Perhaps they were unable to
do so.
For whatever reason, the public
needs to know. Confidence must be
restored. Steps need to be taken to
ensure that this sort of thing can never
happen again (as difficult as that may
be) without creating an atmosphere
of distrust and suspicion at the hospi
tal. And the hospital must not repeat
the mistake of keeping the Depart
ment of I lealth out of the loop.
