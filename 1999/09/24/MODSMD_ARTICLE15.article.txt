Cheers to the Bing Wing
I hat excellent publication, "Speaking of
Computers," devotes its [Sept. 20) lead arti
cle to the West Wing of the Cecil H. Green
Library. The occasion for the article, enti
tled "A Library for the 21st Century," is the
reopening ol that section of the library, now
named the Bing Wing in honor of the bene
factors, Peter and Helen Bing. who made its
renovation possible.
The life of |Peter Bing| has had a geo
graphical pattern similar to mine. His par
ents came from the same Lancashire small
town as mine. He has endowed at Oxford,
where I studied, a new college named after
him. He went to the University of British
Columbia, where I taught. And he has been
connected with Stanford as a benefactor. I
as a beneficiary. He founded Texas Instru
ments; I much more modestly founded
some Stanford programs.
The Bing Wing is a model of the new
electronic world, very appropriate as a wing
of the Library named after the founder of
Texas Instruments. We congratulate Uni
versity Librarian Michael Keller on this step

into the future, and we thank him for the
new entrance which links the Bing Wing
with Hoover.
At the same time, this glorious event
brings hack mixed memories. All my career,
having once been a librarian myself, I have
been concerned with the future of libraries
and with information retrieval. Many
decades ago I started an ambitious scheme
called the International Archives of Book
Analyses. The development of computers
made it obsolete; its files were deposited in
the Green Library Archives.
Having founded the World Association
ol International Studies (originally the Cal
ifornia Institute of International Studies) in
1%5, I started the World Affairs Report in
1970, devoted then to a worldwide survey
and analysis of the Cold War. It was the first
journal in any field in any language to go
full-text on line.
Thinking that the Stanford Community
would be interested in this new and impor
tant development. I expressed a willingness
to tell the Associates of Stanford University
Libraries about it. I was asked to give a talk,
but the invitation was withdrawn. I suppose

the committee had decided they were not
interested in anything but books; no new
fangled ideas! I withdrew from the organi
zation.
In 1990, as the Soviet Union disintegrat
ed. the World Affairs Report changed its
focus, and I donated the 1970-90 files to
Stanford, where they were put on the Spires
system. They are now being transferred to
the Stanford University Library system. I
hope the Library realizes not only the refer
ence value of the file but its significance for
the history of Stanford.
An important feature of the Bing Wing is
the Humanities and Area Studies Resource
Center, headed by Henry Lowood. The
expression "area studies" is a Stanford
dirge. In the early '40s. the U.S. government
supported area studies programs, the key
components being the relevant foreign lan
guage and geography.
Stanford did not have a geography
department, so one was started. I was asked
by John Dodds. Dean of the School of
Humanities, to start the Latin American
program. The History Department, which
withdrew from that school and joined the

School of Social Sciences, refused to collab
orate. Despite that, the Latin American
program nourished and Bolivar I louse was
established.
Then, after it had obtained an interna
tional reputation, disaster struck. Harvard
President James Conant. a narrow-minded
chemist, famously proclaimed that "geogra
phy is not a university subject."
In those days, American universities
aped Harvard, so even the famous geogra
phy departments were either abolished or
emasculated. Stanford Provost, engineer
Fred Terman, shut down the Stanford
department. An area program without
geography makes no sense, so I resigned
from the directorship.
Appeals to revive it have fallen on deaf
ears, so now Stanford is in the crazy situa
tion of having no geography and two (!)
anthropology departments.
Let us forget the past, and drink to the
health of Peter and Helen Bing, who have
restored the library to good health. Banzai
for them and the library!
