## Is the price right? Course readers, cost, copyright laws 
### Christina Harvey 
Tor $156.31, you can get a really
good deal on a used futon. Or you
can buy the Stanford Bookstore's
most expensive course reader for
Political Science 226.
When faced with such a difficult
life decision, you may notice that the
course reader isn't even as useful as
a pillow, much less as a good place to
get a backrub. You may also wonder
how a bound collection of mere
copies could possibly cost so much.
I'lie Stanford Bookstore isn't
using expensive copy machines;
rather, it pays royalties to the person
holding the copyright to get permis
sion to use the work in the course
reader.
"We pay the royalties because
it's the legal and ethical thing to do"
saidLela Rinchart, Custom Publish
ing Manager. "The copyright hold
ers, usually a publishing company,
but sometimes an author, have the
right to say who uses the material
and for what price."
Professors take the material they
want in their course reader to the
Bookstore, and the Bookstore re
quests permission to use the work.
The price is figured from there,
based on the royalties and the pro
duction.
" That's why we like for the pro
fessors to get in their choices early,
because sometimes the publishers
take a long time to answer us,"

Rinchart said.
As soon as a work is created, an
author receives exclusive legal
rights over his work. These rights in
clude copying the works or any part
thereof, making derivative works,
distributing the works, and perform
ing the works.
However, the "fair use" doctrine
allows limited reproduction of copy
righted works for educational and
research purposes. The relevant
portion of the copyright statute pro
vides that the "fair use" of a copy
righted work, including reproduc
tion "for purposes such as criticism,
news reporting, teaching (including
multiple copies for classroom use),
scholarship or research" is not an in
fringement of copyright.
However, Michigan Document
Services, a commercial copy shop in
Ann Arbor. Mich., was sued in a
copyright infringement case recent
ly after it failed to contact copyright
holders when producing course
readers.
Reproducing massive quantities
of copyrighted works of scholarship
for students is not covered under the
"fair use" policy because the market
value of the copyrighted work
would be affected.
"We're dealing with intellectual
property," said Rinchart. "Profes
sors who write want to gain some
thing from that, or at least know
what it is being used for."
Rinchart said she realizes the ex

pense is hard on students' hank ac
counts, especially since course read
ers may differ from year to year and
can't be resold. She informs profes
sors when the royalties on a specific
article are high, so they can decide if
it is still worthwhile to use the article
in the reader.
Communications Professor Cliff
Nass said the Bookstore informs
him of the copyright fees for each ar
ticle.
"Publishers have wildly different
prices for the use of copyrighted ma
terial," he said. "It turns out that one
article in my reader had an exorbi
tant copyright fee. When 1 found
this out, I stopped using the article in
future editions of the reader."
Low cost for some readers, such
as the $2.50 one used for Continuing
Studies: CRDO7, can sometimes be
attributed to the relatively inexpen
sive copyright fees. Royalties are
generally not applicable to authors
whose works exist in the public do
main, which is why a course reader
that focuses on the classics would be
far less expensive than a collection
of modern medicine articles.
Nass said he believes strongly
that the copyright fees should be
paid on course readers.
"Even though 1 donate all of the
royalties on my book to charity, I
have other sources of income be
cause I am a professor. I recognize
that many authors earn virtually all
of their livelihood via writing

books," he said. "Fair use of those
materials ensures that those authors
can earn enough money to write
more books."
Nass said most faculty members
look at the royalty cost of a text in
relation to the educational value
when selecting texts for course read
ers.
"They know that prices vary and
try to keep costs at a reasonable
level, making substitutions when the
cost-benefit analysis warrants it."he
said.
Some students attempt to escape
the high prices for course readers by
copying the books themselves,
though this is not advised.
"Students would have the poten
tial to make their own copies of
course reader materials here," said
Peter Trinca of the Pulse Copy Cen
ter. "Using self-service copiers to
copy copyrighted materials is just
considered casual usage. We post
our notices in compliance with the
law, but we can't police our copiers.
We wouldn't know who the royal
ties should go to, and it's really not
our place to ask our customers what
they are copying."
He said users take responsibility
for the liability of what they copy.
"We're just providing a service,"
he said. "If someone asks us to make
the copies of a copyrighted material,
we won't do it. It's illegal. The only
parts of course readers we will copy
are those we reproduced ourselves."
