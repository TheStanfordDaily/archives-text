# Service survives throughout summer
## Community service groups donate summer time to Haas organizations 
### Mills Schenck Contributing writer 
While many Stanford students enjoyed the
summer by working or tanning on the beach, the
strong community service sentiment at Stanford
kept many students on campus involved in their
service efforts.
Summer community service programs
ranged from distributing unused food to the
hungry and homeless, to organizing a weekend
trip to Sierra Camp for children from Hast Palo
Alto.
Mark DeLucchi, the Fellowship Programs
Coordinator for the I laas Center for Public Ser
vice. said, "It is very important to keep certain
projects going during the summer." He ex
pressed Ins admiration and appreciation for the
students who showed "huge commitment and
flexibility."
One such student is Sylvia Lin. a junior who
stayed on campus this summer and helped keep
SP()()N. the Stanford Project in Nutrition, sup
plying homeless shelters and other community
agencies with unused food from Stanford events
and residences.
Despite the decreased number of students on
campus. Lin feels that it is still important for her
group to continue to function throughout the
year.
"The amount collected is usually smaller in
the summer," said I in. '"but we still try to collect
however much we can. It's truly an extraordi
nary feeling to know that you and your organi

zation are able to make a considerable contribu
tion to the lives of so many people. With this
kind of motivation, how on earth could I possi
bly not want to continue this?"
DeLucchi said that student groups, which are
completely autonomous, sometimes take on
new volunteers during the summer quarters, but
others that require more ongoing effort and
training rely on the same volunteers all year.

It's truly an extraordinary feeling to
know that you and your organization
are able to make a considerable con
tribution...how on earth could I possi
bly not want to continue this?'

Lisa Rosenbaum, a junior, coordinated an
ongoing project, Rotaeare, over the summer.
Rotacare's primary responsibility is to translate
for Spanish-speaking patients at a free clinic in
East Palo Alto.
"We rely on the same people pretty much all
year," said Rosenbaum. "It's nice to know the
clinic continues over the summer because I
think many people would let their problems go
untreated until the clinic re-opened in the fall."
The summer "staph" manager for the Stan
ford Sierra Camp. Blake Harris (Class of *W)
helped to organize Kids Camp, a program that
allows schoolchildren form East Palo Alto to at

tend the camp for a weekend. The children's
stay is free, and the camp donates a weekend
every year so that the children can enjoy the
mountain*! and activities of a camp that would
otherwise be out of their reach.
" The children learned a lot," said Harris,
"but we also learned a lot from them. It was nice
to see them enjoy the archery, swimming and
other activities."
Kids Camp relies on counselors from Stan
ford staying an extra weekend to volunteer for
the children's stay.
The camp also has to block off a weekend be
tween its summer session and its corporate con
ference period to make room for the Palo Alto
students.
"It was a nice way to finish off the summer,
and it was great to get to know the kids," 1 larris
said. "There were a lot of hugs as they left."
While other service organizations slow down
during the summer, many of their members who
remain on campus continue to volunteer.
Alpha Phi Omega, Stanford's chapter of the
coed community service fraternity, was inactive
during the summer quarter. However, members
and alumni still managed to run a booth at the
Festival of the Arts in Palo Alto to help raise
money for the Palo Alto cultural center.
Other service organizations that operated
over the summer included Circle K. Stanford
Miles to Go, Stanford in Government, East Palo
Alto Tennis and Tutoring, East Palo Alto Char
ter School Science Enrichment Program and
I Jpward Bound.
