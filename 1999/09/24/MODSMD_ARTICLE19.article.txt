# ADVICE FOR FRESHMEN
## Top ten ways to choose classes 
### 
10. Shop around Pick a course load twice as
big as you want to take and visit those classes.
Don't get yourself locked into a set schedule
that you might not like
9. Avoid any classes that use the following
terms in the first day of lecture deconstruc
tionist, existentialist, metaphysical, or post
modem.
8. Take a look at the reading for the course at
the Bookstore. See if it's manageable Often
times it's not.
7. Take a professor, not a course. You've prob
ably heard this a million times, but it's true.
You're not going to learn much from the most
boring man who ever lived And he does teach
courses around campus Trust us. (Hint count
the number of times your professor says "um"
in the first lecture and divide by five. If the re
sult exceeds 100, stay far away from that
class)
6 Avoid classes before 10 a.m. —if you can.
Be nice to your body Also in an ideal world,
you wouldn't have to take Friday classes —

they tend to interfere with weekend getaways.
5. Take a look at the final exam schedule. Try to avoid
having multiple exams on the same day You might not
want a final on the last day before vacation, either.
4. Take classes with professors who wrote books that
are on the reading lists. For instance, if you take
Humßio 10 (Human Sexuality) with Katchadourian,
you can tell all of your friends that you know the man
who wrote the book on sex,
3. Your best resources for advice on campus are up
perclassmen. Talk to them. Find out what their favorite
classes were, and learn from their knowledge and mis
takes
2. Fulfill GER's in interesting ways. Try something you
wouldn't ever think of taking like Hawaiian Music or
Arab Women Writers.
1 During your freshman year take what you like. It's re
ally your only opportunity to explore a smorgasbord of
areas without having to worry about requirements. So
don't waste this experience. And most important, have
a good time.
