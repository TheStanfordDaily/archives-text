# Mt. Zion ER to close
## UCSF-Stanford move could save $20M a year 
### Jim Tankersley Senior staff writer 
In a cost-cutting move, UCSF-
Stanford Health Care will close in
patient and emergency-room ser
vices at the San Francisco hospital
state auditors blame for most of the
organization's $60 million deficit.
The UCSF-Stanford Board of
Directors, acting on the recommen
dation of UCSF School of Medicine
Dean Haile T. Debas, decided yes
terday to shut down inpatient and
emergency room care at UCSF /
Mount Zion Medical Center and
transfer them to the UCSF Medical
Center at Parnassus Heights, two
miles away.
UCSF-Stanford will save an esti
mated $15 million to $20 million an
nually from the consolidation, orga
nization spokesman Mike Lassiter
said, but some members of the
Mount Zion staff may lose their
jobs.
"It's a sad day." said Lee Gold
man, the acting UCSF vice chancel
lor for medical affairs. "It's like a
death in the family."
A spokesman for the California

Nurses Association, a union that
represents many UCSF workers,
called the decision "outrageous."
"Mount Zion is in the middle of a
heavily working-class, immigrant
and minority community," union
spokesman Joe Lindsay said. "Most
of those people don't have cars. If it
is closed, there is a whole section of
the city that w ill not be served by an
emergency room.
"It is going to cost lives."
The union has criticized UCSF-
Stanford throughout its rocky two
year existence. After a year of mod
est profits, UCSF-Stanford lost
$10.7 million in the first quarter of
1999, and administrators responded
by cutting 2,000 hospital positions.
The organization continued to
lose money, projecting a $60 million
deficit for 19W. An audit by the Cal
ifornia State Senate's Committee on
Government Oversight pins the ma
jority of that shortfall on Mount
Zion.
That fact troubled the Stanford
Board of Trustees, who said in a
press release two weeks ago that
Stanford should not have to "subsi
dize" a University of California hos

pital.
But UCSF-Stanford officials said
Mount Zion has never made money
and that reductions in Medicare and
HMO payments, not the merger,
forced the closure.
Mount Zion was in danger of
closing when UCSF took it over in
the early 19905, Lassiter said.
"It has never been an economi
cally workable place," he said.
"Until now. they've been able to off
set that with the profits being made
at the Parnassus site."
Goldman said Mount Zion and
Parnassus don't collectively serve
enough hospitalized patients to jus
tify operating two acute care cen
ters. forcing UCSF-Stanford to
transfer Mount Zion services.
Mount Zion's emergency room
serves about 1 l.(X)() patients a year.
Lassiter said, compared to 38,(XX) at
Parnassus.
Under the reconfiguration plan.
Mount Zion will become a service
center including the UCSF Cancer
Center, ambulatory surgery, an ur
gent-care center and outpatient clin
ical services. Parnassus will he ex
panded wilh additional emergency
department treatment stations,
critical care beds and operating
rooms.
Parnassus will also expand its in
terpreter stall to assist the immi
grant population no longer served
hy Mount Zion.
I he transfer still has a few hur
dles to clear. I ! ( SI-Stanford must
file a public notice with the San
I rancisco Department of Public
Health and the California Health
Services Department within 90
days of moving inpatient services
or closing the emergency room.
Lindsay s;iid the Nurses Associ
ation will meet with local political
leaders in the next lew days to fight
the closure.
