FOOTBALL
■ Saturday: Stanford (2-1, 2-0 Pac
10) vs. No. IS UCLA (2-1,0-0).

It's especially nice when it hap
pens two weeks in a row.
The Cardinal's success has coin
cided with the arrival of Carter. The
standout freshman, who made his
first start last week against Arizona,
scored three first-half touchdowns on

runs from live, eight and three yards
out.
It has been three seasons since the
Cardinal has been able to boast a con
sistent backfield. and the team hopes
that Carter will be the running back
the team has been lacking.
Senior quarterback Husak was
also integral to the teams offensive
explosion. Against Arizona, Husak
led the team's offensive attack by
passing for 364 yards and one touch
down. He finished the game 21 -for-35
and also ran for a score.
Stanford's receiving corps — one
of the best in the nation — has pro
vided yet another boost. Senior Wal
ters, an All-America candidate and
Stanford's all-time leader in receiving
yardage, had racked up eight catches
for 168 yards at the end of last week's
game.
All told, the offense garnered 580
yards against an Arizona team that
was widely considered to be the pre
season Pac-10 favorite.
Instead, it is Stanford who leads
the conference with two wins.
UCLA (2-1,0-0) has yet to play a
Pac-10 Conference game. But the
Bruins won the conference last year
and. as the defending champions,
represent one of the toughest games
on the Cardinal's schedule.
" They have got a number of guys
who are just outstanding players,"
Willingham said, "and possess out
standing speed and size. So it's a
tremendous group."
In fact, they might be more
"tremendous" a group than the
vaunted Arizona team Stanford
faced a week ago. Despite the team's
preseason hype, the Wildcats have
struggled this season. Arizona began
the year ranked No. 4, but quickly
tumbled to No. 19 after a miserable
41-7 loss on opening day to No. 3
Penn State.
And instead of coming back
strong from that opening-week loss,
the Wildcats were barely able to limp
away from Texas Christian and Cen
tral Tennessee with small victories.
Then came the debacle against
Stanford.
Arizona, then, may have been a
sheep in wolfs clothing. But that
won't be true with UCLA.
Last season, the Bruins went un
defeated in Pac-10 play and went to
the Rose Bowl. Although the team
lost quarterback Cade McNown at
the end of last season, it returns most

of its starters.
But this last week has been a bad
one for the Bruins. The team's first
string quarterback, redshirt freshman
Cory Paus, will probably sit out Sat
urday's game due to lingering injuries
from last Saturday's contest against
Fresno State.
In that game, Paus had thrown for
113 yards and one touchdown by the
time he was sacked early in the sec
ond quarter. Paus fell on the football
and sustained injuries to his chest and
neck.
UCLA got more tragic news
Wednesday when it learned junior
wide receiver Brian Poli-Dixon's
wrist, initially thought to be injured in
Saturday's game, is, in fact, broken.
The injury sidelines him for the sea
son.
The loss is a potent one for the
Bruins, who had relied on standout
performances from Polo-Dixon last

season in their Rose Bowl run. Paus
caught 44 passes for 712 yards and 10
touchdowns. This season, Poli-Dixon
and senior Danny Farmer were sup
posed to make up one of the most
fearsome receiving corps in the con
ference.
The losses for UCLA make a vic
tory against Stanford all the more im
portant for a team set on returning to
the Rose Bowl.
But Willingham hopes that last
week's win against a big-time team
will help prepare the Cardinal for the
Bruins this week.
"We hope that the experience of
going into one of the more difficult
places in this conference to play, and
winning, would be the kind of build
ing block that a team can stand on.
and stand pretty tall on," he said.
"We're hopeful that it will be that
way as we progress through the sea
son."
