Stanford comes into the tourna
ment on five-game winning streak
after opening Pac-10 play with vic
tories over Washington and Wash
ington State last weekend and a
mid-week win over California
Tuesday night. The Cardinal look
to improve upon the current 29-
match win streak on the Maples
hardwood dating back over two
seasons.
Leading the way are veteran
outside hitters kcrri Walsh and

Sarah Clark, joined by sophomore
Sara Sandrik and freshman stand
out Logan Tom.
Walsh, a three-time All-Ameri
can, is coming off an 18-kill, 14-dig
performance Tuesday night
against Cal in which she hit .500 for
the match.
So far in 199 N. Tom has gotten
dangerously close to living up to
the hype that surrounds her. Mon
day. she was named Pac-10 Player
of the Week after stunning perfor
mances against Washington and
Washington State.
Against the Bears. Fom posted
a match-high 20 kills while reeling
off 15 digs and five blocks.
Stanford will not have an easy
time in this weekend's matches as
both BYU and Utah will test the
Cardinal attack.
The Cougars are coming off a
three-game sweep of Utah State
and a five-game win over then
lOth-ranked Pepperdine. BYU has
won six straight matches after its
season-opening loss to Michigan.
The squad returns eight letterwin
ners from last year's 31-4 team, in
cluding All-Amcrican setter
Anna-Lena Smith and all-confer
ence performers Nina Puikkoncn.
Melissa l.ayton and Mari Carpen
ter.
"We will be facing two good
teams from the Pac-10." said BYU
coach Elaine Michaelis. "Both Cal
and Stanford return all their
starters from last year and Stan
ford has freshman Logan Tom,
who is playing extremely well.
"Stanford has a long home win
ning streak and will be national
championship contenders, so this
will be a good benchmark for us.
We will definitely have our work
cut out for us."
The Utes enter the tournament
having played two big matches the
previous weekend.
Utah won a five-game
marathon over rival Utah State
Sept. 16, 16-14. 15-12. 6-15. 10-15,
15-12. They lost a heartbreaker to
l()th-ranked Pepperdine Sept. 17.
Pepperdine took the first two
games, but Utah came back after
the break with a fierce intensity,
claiming the next two games. In the
fifth game, Utah seemed to have
the momentum, but with the rally
scoring, an out of bounds shot by
Adrianne Bradley gave the Waves
the point to win the game and the
match.
The tournament will serve as a
good test for the Cardinal squad as
the difficult West Coast volleyball
season heats up. Stanford looks to
improve upon its early exit from
last year's NCAA tournament.
