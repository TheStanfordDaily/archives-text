# Water polo faces tough weekend test
## 
### Erin Bouchier Contributing writer 
The nation's top-ranked team
is faced with one primary problem:
everyone else is gunning for them.
So when third-ranked UCLA and
No. 4 UC-Irvine meet newly inau
gurated No. 1 Stanford at
deGuerre pool this weekend they
will each be looking for an upset.
Saturday's game with UCLA
presents a unique opportunity for
fans to take in the water polo ac
tion at noon before the Cardinal

takes on the Bruins in football at 2
p.m.
Playing Nos. 3 and 4 back-to
back is certainly a tough task; the
pressure will be on. The Cardinal
faced and beat the first, third, sev
enth and ninth ranked teams last
weekend at the Southern Califor
nia Tournament, proving that "the
guys responded well to the pres
sure" according to Cardinal Coach
Dante Dettamanti.
This weekend's games will dif
fer from those last weekend in that
the matches against UCLA (4-1)

and UC-Irvine (2-3) mark the
opening of Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play for the
Cardinal. Stanford (6-0) will play
each of the other eight MPSF
teams once in an official league
game. The Cardinal's record in
these league games will determine
its seed in the all-important MPSF
Tournament. Because the winner
of this tournament earns an auto
matic bid to the NCAA Tourna
ment, the Cardinal squad is focus
ing on earning a top seed. Coach
Dettamanti emphasizes that every

league game is important in the
Cardinal's quest for an NCAA
ehampionship.
Stanford takes on third-ranked
UCLA Saturday. UCLA is a
perennial water polo power, most
recently winning NCAA titles in
1995 and 1996. This year's squad
has excellent depth and speed,
much like Stanford's team.
The Cardinal has already
played UCLA once this season, in
the semifinals of the Southern Cal
ifornia Tournament. Stanford won
that game 9-7 with the help of
three points from senior Andy
Walburger, two apiece from se
nior Scan Joy and redshirt sopho
more Mark Amott and a strong
performance in the goal by red
shirt freshman Nick Ellis. The
Bruins were led by Matt Armato
and Brian Brown, who each
scored three points with a two
pointer apiece. UCLA holcman
Sean Kern, who trains with the
U.S. Olympic team, was held
scoreless in that game, a testament
to strong two-meter defense by se
nior John Skaalen and redshirt
sophomore Pasi Dutton.
One key to Saturday's game
against the Bruins is to continue
the strong defense against Kern.
Dettamanti also notes that shut
ting down the two-point scoring of
Armato will be extremely impor
tant against UCLA since two
pointers can be such a psychologi
cal lift. Stanford will also need to

stop the Bruins' counterattack,
which the Cardinal did with great
success last weekend.
Against UCLA, Dettamanti
would like to see Stanford improve
its scoring on 6-on-5 opportunities.
While he says "it's okay right now."
he "would like to do better.
"I would like to he shooting 50
percent." Dettamanti is happy with
the Cardinal's ability to squander
other squad's scoring chances in
man-up situations and hopes to see
continued strong defensive play.
After facing UCLA. Stanford
will see fourth-ranked UC-Irvine
on Sundav. While the Cardinal

squad has not yet played Irvine this
season, they had a chance to see it
in action at the Southern California
Tournament where Irvine finished
fourth. Dettamanti describes the
Anteaters as well-coached, strong
and well-conditioned. "They al
ways play well at the beginning of
the season, and they don't make
mistakes," he adds.
To win. Stanford "will have to
play a mistake-free game" accord
ing to Dettamanti. Irvine is led by
John Dorphi and Jeff Powers, who
have scored the majority of the
Anteaters' goals this season.
On Sunday, Stanford will need
to focus on limiting their scoring
chances, particularly with Dorphi
in the 6-on-5.
Irvine also has an excellent goal

keeper in Genai Kerr. In the So-Cal
Tournament semifinal game, Kerr
led the Anteater defense, which
limited then-No. 1 USC to five
goals. Irvine lost that game by only
one goal, proving that its No. 4
ranking is well-deserved. Coach
Dettamanti notes that the
Anteaters' strong defense will
"probably mean a low-scoring
game on Sunday." Stanford "must
make its goals count."
As the MPSF season gets under
way, Dettamanti emphasizes to his
team that "we can't afford to let up:
every game is important. There is
no such thing as an easy game."
This weekend UCLA and UC-
Irvine will be gunning for them, but
you can bet that the Cardinal will
be ready.
