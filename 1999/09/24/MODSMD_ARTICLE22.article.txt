# Water polo faces tough weekend test
## 
### Erin Bouchier Contributing writer 
The nation's top-ranked team
is faced with one primary problem:
everyone else is gunning for them.
So when third-ranked UCLA and
No. 4 UC-Irvine meet newly inau
gurated No. 1 Stanford at
deGuerre pool this weekend they
will each be looking for an upset.
Saturday's game with UCLA
presents a unique opportunity for
fans to take in the water polo ac
tion at noon before the Cardinal

takes on the Bruins in football at 2
p.m.
Playing Nos. 3 and 4 back-to
back is certainly a tough task; the
pressure will be on. The Cardinal
faced and beat the first, third, sev
enth and ninth ranked teams last
weekend at the Southern Califor
nia Tournament, proving that "the
guys responded well to the pres
sure" according to Cardinal Coach
Dante Dettamanti.
This weekend's games will dif
fer from those last weekend in that
the matches against UCLA (4-1)

and UC-Irvine (2-3) mark the
opening of Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play for the
Cardinal. Stanford (6-0) will play
each of the other eight MPSF
teams once in an official league
game. The Cardinal's record in
these league games will determine
its seed in the all-important MPSF
Tournament. Because the winner
of this tournament earns an auto
matic bid to the NCAA Tourna
ment, the Cardinal squad is focus
ing on earning a top seed. Coach
Dettamanti emphasizes that every

league game is important in the
Cardinal's quest for an NCAA
ehampionship.
Stanford takes on third-ranked
UCLA Saturday. UCLA is a
perennial water polo power, most
recently winning NCAA titles in
1995 and 1996. This year's squad
has excellent depth and speed,
much like Stanford's team.
The Cardinal has already
played UCLA once this season, in
the semifinals of the Southern Cal
ifornia Tournament. Stanford won
that game 9-7 with the help of
three points from senior Andy
Walburger, two apiece from se
nior Scan Joy and redshirt sopho
more Mark Amott and a strong
performance in the goal by red
shirt freshman Nick Ellis. The
Bruins were led by Matt Armato
and Brian Brown, who each
scored three points with a two
pointer apiece. UCLA holcman
Sean Kern, who trains with the
U.S. Olympic team, was held
scoreless in that game, a testament
to strong two-meter defense by se
nior John Skaalen and redshirt
sophomore Pasi Dutton.
One key to Saturday's game
against the Bruins is to continue
the strong defense against Kern.
Dettamanti also notes that shut
ting down the two-point scoring of
Armato will be extremely impor
tant against UCLA since two
pointers can be such a psychologi
cal lift. Stanford will also need to
