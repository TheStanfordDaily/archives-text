## 
### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
Stanford's newest co-ed frater
nity is all business. But don't expect
Alpha Kappi Fsi to throw a keg
party any time soon.
AKPsi. the nation's first busi
ness fraternity, begins its first Stan
ford rush next week, since the I Jni
versity formally recognized it last
spring.

"Stanford doesn't have an un
dergraduate business degree," said
AKPsi Vice President Vi Hang.
"This [fraternity] is a way to sup
plement that."
Interested students must submit
an application, including a cover
letter and a resume. They are then
interviewed by active members.
"We're a professional business
fraternity, and we run ourselves
like a corporation," said AKPsi
President Sam Lee, a senior major
ing in economics. "We want to give
students practice — as if they were

All decisions are based on professional qualities....
That's the main difference between us and Greek
fraternities'

applying for a job at a company."
I fe stressed that all decisions are
based on professional qualities. "I
guess that's the main difference be
tween us and Greek fraternities."
The mission statement of
AKPsi, according to its official na
tional Web site, is "to develop well
trained, ethical, skilled, resourceful
and experienced business leaders."
Stanford students were original
ly recruited by a national represen
tative: Lee found out about the fra
ternity through an e-mail sent last
year to the economics mailing list.
He and a group of other inter
ested students attended several in

formationa! meetings and eventu
ally applied to open a Stanford
chapter.
Last January, Lee and IS other
students were inducted as
"colonists."
As Lee explained, before a fra
ternity becomes a chapter it is a
colony, and there are several re
quirements that colonists must ful
fill before the chapter is estab
lished.

"During the colony period, we
were mainly trying to recruit mem
bers," Lee said.
Hang said that recruitment oc
curs through e-mail lists, flyering
and word of mouth.
The colonists also had to write a
constitution and gain approval
from the Office of Student Affairs.
They held several professional
events, including a lecture, a work
shop and a community service pro
ject.
"In late March we inducted 23
new members, though we lost a few

during the pledge process." Lee
said. "By late April we were recog
nized as a chapter."
AKPsi doesn't have a formal in
volvement with the Graduate School
of Business, but "we do have infor
mal relationships." Hang said.
"For example, three MBA stu
dents are appearing on a panel
we're having during rush week," he
added.
The fraternity does have social
events, such as barbecues and re
treats. but "that's not the main
focus of our fraternity," I fang said.
"The main focus is professional de
velopment."
