### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
I he Intramural sports office has changed its
signup policies this year. Rather than allotting a
specific registration day and serving students on
a first-come basis, the office will hold signups on
the Web.
"We gave out a survey last year and the
biggest complaint was that students did not like
the signup procedure." said junior Erin Moix,
student director of the Intramural program.
Students voiced complaints about waiting in
line for registration, stating that they did not
enjoy camping out the night before to ensure
spots in the Intramural program.
Mark Vela, a sophomore who was an 1M rep
resentative for Larkin dormitory last year and
therefore in charge of signing up. said. "I didn't

like the old system. It was in the middle of the
week; it was cold; once it rained, and you had to
stay there all night."
There were line checks about once an hour,
and if the person who's name appeared on the
signup sheet wasn't in line, the group was
crossed off the list, according to Vela.

[The new system] sounds much
more practical and efficient.'

sophomore

"We put together the new registration
process at the end of the summer," stated Moix.
"The actual procedures are on the Web site it
self: they are easy to follow."
Interested students must first bring in deposit

checks to the Intramural office in Ford Center
on Sept. 29 or Sept. 30 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
At the office, students will receive a pass
word for their teams, and they can sign up on the
Web site (www.stanford.edu/groups/intramu
rals) beginning at 7 a.m. on Sept. 30.
"We knew it was time for a change. With the
Web site up. students can look up game sched
ules on the site. It makes everything more con
venient." Moix said.
■'I definitely like the idea of the new system."
Vela said. "It sounds much more practical and effi
cient."
Another change to the Intramural program
this year is that two sports will be switched. Six
person volleyball, traditionally played fall quar
ter, will be played winter quarter. Ultimate Fris
bee, which usually gets rained out winter quar
ter. will move to fall quarter.
