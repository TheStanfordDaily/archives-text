# Parasites bombard eucalyptus trees
## Australian wasps may offer solution 
### Corinne Yates Contributing writer 
Stanford's famous eucalyptus
trees are under attack.
Herb Fong. Stanford's manager
of Facilities Operations, estimates
that approximately 100 eucalyptus
trees on campus have been infect
ed by a parasitic insect known as
the red gum lerp psyHid.
This insect feeds on the nutri
ents of a particular species of euca
lyptus commonly known as the red
gum. It also secretes a white sugar
that develops into sticky cones,
leaving messy trails on pavement
and cars.
"All the red gums that can he in
fected arc. at this point," explained
Karen Stidd. a horticultural techni
cal specialist in the Grounds De
partment. "|Psyllids| don't seem to
be doing much damage to other
species."
Infected trees are located
throughout campus in such places
as Governor's Avenue, the Maples
Pavilion parking lot and a strip of
Campus Drive. Due to the loss of
nutrients, they generally have few
leaves.
Groundskeepers first noticed
the psyllids, indigenous to Aus

tralia, attacking campus trees in
June 1998. No trees have died thus
far. but there is reason for concern.
Fong stated, "Another year or
two, and I'll be very concerned.
After three or four years, we can
begin to lose trees. We are keeping
our fingers crossed that we won't
lose any trees in the next year and
by then there will hopefully be
predators."
The predators to which Fong
refers are small wasps from Aus
tralia that researchers hope will
help control the insects.
IIC-Berkeley Professor Don
Dahlsten recently visited Australia
to bring back the wasps for study.
Fong said that the wasps are about
the size of flecks of pepper.
Stidd said. "We are very con
cerned, but we also have high
hopes with the help of [Dahlsten]."
The wasps will remain under
quarantine anywhere from two
months to two years.
In the meantime, Fong said that
the strength and vigor of the trees
are encouraged by extra watering
and care.
Pesticides are not being consid
ered because of their potential
harmful effects on the rest of the
environment.

Healthy eucalyptus trees such as these are in danger of falling prey
to the parasite psyllid.
