Typhoon Bart hits Japan
NAHA. Japan (AP) — Residents of Japan's main southwestern
island of Kyushu braced themselves Thursday for approaching
Typhoon Bart. One man drowned in the high waves that hit before
the typhoon.
The typhoon hit Okinawa, I,(XX) miles southwest of Tokyo,
Wednesday, leaving 24 people injured and about 11(),(XX) homes with
out electricity.
A 50-year-old man died in Kyushu on Thursday, swept away while
trying to swim ashore after securing his boat, police said.
Bart, packing winds of up to 1(X) mph, was moving northeastward
ly toward Kyushu late Thursday and was expected to land by Friday
morning, the Meteorological Agency said.
It was expected to pass over the Sea of Japan, bypassing Tokyo,
and travel over the northern island of Hokkaido on Saturday, it said.
Warnings were issued of heavy rains weakening cliffs and setting
off landslides.
In Fukuoka Prefecture in Kyushu, 37 homes were evacuated,
police said.
Most of the injuries on Okinawa were minor, including bruises
from flying objects and people falling down on the slippery ground,
police spokesman Jun Yogi said. Dozens of homes were flooded.
At least 113,2tX) homes were initially affected by power outages in
the Okinawan capital of Naha and nearby small islands, but utility
workers began restoring electricity.
Blown down trees blocked roads, and some shop signs were also
knocked down. Most flights linking Okinawa with other parts of
Japan were canceled, and schools stayed closed for the second day.
U.S. military officials on Okinawa were still assessing damage
from the typhoon. Military personnel and their families were restrict
ed to their homes. The U.S. military has a significant presence on the
island.
Racist sets off bomb at Florida A&M
TALLAHASSEE. Fla. (AP) — Two apparently racist pipe bomb
ings at predominantly black Florida A&M University have spread
fear on campus and prompted school administrators to add security
cameras and dozens of uniformed police officers.
Classes were mostly full and students milled about the quadrangle
Thursday, one day after the second pipe bomb exploded. Despite the
security measures, many were uneasy.
"Telling a freshman to not be afraid as they lay their head down for
the night is something I can't see," said Nekeisha Briggs, a senior from
New York City.
Neither pipe bomb caused significant damage but an anonymous
call to a Tallahassee television station threatening that the blast was
"just the beginning" has many fearing that a racist serial bomber is on
the loose.
"It's playing with the very life of our university." said Frederick
Humphries, president of the 12,(XM)-student school.
Investigators wouldn't say Thursday if they have any suspects or
even if the two bombings are connected, but they acknowledged sim
ilarities between the Aug. 31 explosion in an administration building
restroom and Wednesday's explosion in the restroom in a classroom
building.
In the first explosion, a caller used racial slurs and indicated he
wanted to "get rid of" some of the people at Florida A&M. On
Wednesday, a caller told ABC affiliate WTXL-TV that students at
Florida A&M didn't need a university and that the explosion was
"just the beginning, brother."
Authorities said anonymous calls were made about the time of
both explosions and both pipe bombs were small. A $16,000 award
was offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction.
To prevent further problems, the school announced Thursday it
was adding a system of surveillance cameras and had hired an outside
security firm. It also is adding 50 uniformed police officers from the
city and county to its campus patrol.
While administrators tried to calm worried parents. Derrick Heck,
the student government vice president, urged students not to succumb
to threats.
"Let them know that our education cannot be stopped," Heck told
fellow students from the university's library steps Wednesday evening.
Pastrana avoids human rights meeting
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — President Andres Pastrana on
Thursday declined to meet with a high-level human rights delegation
that had openly criticized his quest for more U.S. military aid to fight
the drug war.
A presidential spokesman said Pastrana, who returned from
Washington on Wednesday, was unable to meet with the delegation
led by a daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and Spanish judge Baltasar
Garzon.
He said Pastrana's agenda was tight, and the group arrived 30 min
utes late to its morning appointment at the presidential palace.
Kerry Kennedy Cuomo heads a human rights foundation named
after her late father. Garzon is the magistrate seeking Chilean dicta
tor Augusto Pinochet's extradition from Great Britain on genocide
and other charges.
At a news conference Thursday concluding a four-day visit, the
human rights delegation — which also included former U.S. federal
judge Marvin Frankel and Guatemalan Attorney Frank Larue —
repeated criticism that provoked rebukes this week from Colombian
officials.
They said Pastrana's government was not doing enough to protect
threatened human rights workers, and was taking a dangerous step in
inviting massive U.S. aid to help Colombia's military fight against ille
gal narcotics.
Kennedy Cuomo said any increased U.S. aid would be more use
fully directed towards fighting poverty and helping Colombia pay its
foreign debts.
"More arms and bullets will not feed the children I see on the
streets," she told The Associated Press in an interview.
