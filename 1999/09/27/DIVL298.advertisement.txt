The Daily
is looking
for writers,
artists and
photographers.
Try your hand at journalism working for one
of the top collegiate papers in the country.
No experience is necessary, you get paid and
the time commitment is flexible.
When a world leader drops in to visit, you're the shmuck covering the story.
When the band drops their pants, you're there with a camera. For better or for worse.
When you're ready to join up, stop by - we're training new staff this week.
Interested? Come to Daily 101X from 7:00 - 9:00 pm
Tuesday, Wednesday, or next Monday (Oct. 4)
in Storke Student Publications Building
or call 725-2100 ext. 305 for more information.
