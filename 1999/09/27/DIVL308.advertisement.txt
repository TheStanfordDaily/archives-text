"Slicon Valley" is perceived by many to be the cradle of the future, and the attention given to it throughout the world
is tremendous. But how did this area came to acquire such and important global identity and significance? And what
has the rise of "Silicon Valley" meant for the people, cultures and material realities that actually define the Bay Area?
This year-long, non-classroom-based program of study, combines field trips, lectures, and symposia with the informal
study and discussion of readings and films. A program schedule can be found at the STS Program web-site www.stan
