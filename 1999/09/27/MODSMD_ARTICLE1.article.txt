Fifty-five sophomores added a
stellar line to their resumes last
week, earning the President's
Award for Academic Excellence in
the Freshman Year.
"These students did very well in a
substantive, rigorous course load
that had balance and depth," said
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation John Bravman, who pre
sented the awards at the Sophomore
Welcome on Sept. 21.
The award goes to students who

'We want to be sure [the
award-winners] are aware
of the opportunities at
Stanford.

accomplished high marks in difficult
courses. Administrators select stu
dents based on transcripts, nomina
tions by professors and TAs.
"I'm hoping the award will give
me increased opportunities," said
sophomore winner Kenny Garrett.
"Perhaps more doors will open at
Stanford as far as research opportu
nities."
Laura Selznick. director of un
dergraduate research opportuni
ties, coordinated the selection
process.
"We looked at the grades and
kind of program," Selznick said. "If a
student took a weak program full of

pass-no credits or less units, they are
less likely to be recognized. Some
students have 50 graded units."
Students received a letter and e
mail notifying them of their award
over the summer. Many students
had never heard of the prize before
they won it.
"It was something that came very
unexpectedly," said sophomore
award-winner Vlada Teper. "1 had
no idea of the existence of such
recognition."
Selznick said most students do
not know about the award because
they don't apply for it.
The award-winners will be invit
ed to the Faculty Club with Bravman
and Selznick.
"Since these students have a head
start, we want to be sure they are
aware of opportunities at Stanford."
Selznick said.
"Many of us believe that [Stan
ford] recognizes many talents and
abilities of students, but we as a Uni
versity don't want to lose sight of our
primary mission which is academic
and intellectual," Bravman added.
Some students said the award will
help them keep sight of their acade
mic goals.
"(The award] has given me a little
more motivation." sophomore
Kathy Huang said, i was kind of not
thrilled with freshman year, hut I ob
viously didn't do as bad as I thought.
"A lot of people deserve it, more
than just 55 people," she added.
"It was definitely nice to get it."
sophomore Gina Guarienti said. "I
have a good sense of accomplish
ment. Now I'm hoping to maintain
the status quo."
