### 
WASHING TON (AP) — The International Mone
tary Fund, under mounting pressure in the wake of a
Russian corruption scandal, put in place a major new
debt-relief initiative Sunday and adopted a number of
internal reforms aimed at improving the agency's man
agement of future crises.
All the activity around the annual meetings of the
182-nation IMF and the World Bank was aimed at
damping criticism the two giant lending agencies failed
to coordinate programs and badly mismanaged the
recent global financial turmoil.
IMF and World Bank officials, at the first-ever joint
meeting of the two agencies' policy-setting committees,
pledged in a statement to support "deeper, broader and
faster debt relief" for the world's poorest countries.

The new coordinated effort will provide debt relief
to 36 of the world's poorest nations. It is intended to
erase up to $ 1 (K) billion in debt, allowing the countries
to commit scarce resources to poverty, health and edu
cation programs.
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown,
the chairman of the IMF's policy setting Interim Com
mittee. said the group had approved a recommendation
to revalue 14 million ounces of the IMF's gold reserves
to market prices to support the debt effort. He said a
number of countries had also stepped forward Sunday
with new pledges of financial support.
"Let it be said of this historic meeting that those to
whom the world's greatest wealth has been given are
joined with those burdened down by the world's great

est debt." Brown told reporters at a crowded news con
ference at the end of Sunday's meeting.
The IMF was forced to drop plans to sell gold on the
open markets because of strong opposition from the
mining industry, which feared the sales would further
depress world gold prices.
In a further effort to bolster market prices, central
bank officials from 15 European nations issued a joint
pledge Sunday agreeing to limit their own future gold
sales to levels already announced.
On the reform front, the IMF" approved adoption of
a new code of good practices the agency will use to
monitor countries' efforts to provide markets with accu
rate and timely information on key economic statistics
such as their financial reserves.

IMF policy-makers also promised to accelerate work
on other reform proposals. Among those are proposals
pushed by the United States for the IMF to tighten
audit controls over its multibillion dollar loan programs.
The Clinton administration is hoping these reforms
will deflect the heavy criticism from congressional
Republicans since reports last month of a wide-ranging
investigation into allegations of massive laundering of
Russian money through accounts at the Bank of New
York.
"A changed IMF is needed for the changed world
that we now have. We have made a good start in many
areas, but much more needs to be done." Treasury Sec
retary Lawrence Summers told IMF policy-makers
Sunday.
