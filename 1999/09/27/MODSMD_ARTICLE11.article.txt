# Peacekeepers control East Timor
## Pro-Indonesia militias deny defeat

DILI, East Timor (AP) â€” Pro-
Indonesia militiamen should peace
fully return to East Timor and help
rebuild the province, the comman
der of a peacekeeping force said
Sunday, as he prepared to take con
trol of the province from the
Indonesian army.
Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove also
called for an accelerated deploy
ment of the second half of the 7,500-
strong force, amid reports that the
militias are massing outside the cap
ital to attack the peacekeepers.
"We would welcome militia to
come along back into the political
debate, to come back in unarmed,"
Cosgrove told Australian television.
"And if this is done, then Timor has
an early rosy future. If it's not done,
then this will drag on like this for a
long time."
The militias, backed by Indone
sian troops, launched a terror cam
paign in the province alter residents
voted nearly 4-to-l in favor of inde
pendence in a U.N.-sponsored ref
erendum on Aug. 30. The Aus
tralian-led peacekeeping force
arrived in East Timor on Sept. 21 to
stop the violence and maintain
order until a U.N. force arrives in
November to shepherd the territory
through the transition to indepen
dence.
Just across the border in the
province of West Timor, militiamen
brandishing rifles and machetes
vowed Sunday to fight for the
province.

An Indonesian reporter, who
interviewed militia members in
West Timor, told The Associated
Press that they were awaiting the
order retake the province and were
prepared to attack.
East Timorese remain fearful,
despite the peacekeepers' presence.
"The militias are still out there.
They are gone now but they might
come back. Everyone is afraid."
said Paulino Pinto, a Dili resident
who lost everything when a mob set
fire to his home.
The peacekeeping mission faces
other daunting challenges. The first
reconnaissance flights have shown
that the province of 800,000 is near
ly deserted, with up to 75 percent of
its buildings and homes demolished.
"If we don't manage to get food
and medical supplies to those in the
hills and, security permitting, enable
them to move back to the towns by
the time the rainy season comes in a
few weeks we could be in even
deeper trouble." Ross Mountain,
the U.N. humanitarian coordinator
for East Timor, said on his return
from one flight.
Security concerns have ham
pered road convoys, forcing aid
workers to use air drops that offi
cials admit are hit-and-miss.
U.N. workers in East Timor have
found mounting evidence of torture
and hundreds if not thousands of
killings. The discoveries added
weight to calls for a U.N. team to
investigate alleged atrocities ahead

of a possible international tribunal.
"Some of the [soldiers] alleged to
have been involved in some of the
worst present crimes ... are on their

way out of the province, and we've
asked for those people to be investi
gated. Cosgrove told Australian
television.
