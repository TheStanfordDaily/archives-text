# Battered by bad news, stock market tumbles
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Last
week, stocks tumbled under a stag
gering weight of bad news. The
dollar was declining. A handful of
companies said their profits were
in trouble. And Microsoft's presi
dent deflated enthusiasm for
beloved technology slocks, even
his own.
This coming week, none of that
bad news is likely to improve.
While some investors are likely
to view the battered market as a
fine place for bargain-hunting,
many market analysts expect
another rough week on Wall
Street.
Last week, the Dow Jones
industrial average fell a total of
524.30 points, tumbling more than
2(K) points in two separate sessions.
The plunge left the Dow 1.046.71
points, or 9.2 percent, below its
record close of 11,326.04, set Aug.
25.
Broader market indicators also
fared poorly. The Nasdaq compos
ite index, which lists most of the
world's leading technology compa
nies. lost 129.21 points over the
course of the week.
The tumble surprised few Wall
Street analysts. In recent weeks,
even as the Dow and the Nasdaq
hit new records, many market
watchers remained troubled about
signs of ill health in the market.
Above all. analysts worried that
the strong performance of the

Dow's blue-chip stocks and tech
nology leaders like Intel and
Microsoft wasn't shared by the
broader market.
Last week, the market lost its
last bastion of strength. Semicon
ductor stocks tumbled Wednes
day. a day after an earthquake hit
Taiwan, a major production center
for the chips and components used
in computers.
And on Thursday, Microsoft
president Steve Ballmer sent the
market spinning by telling
reporters he believes technology
stocks are too pricey.
"There is such an overvaluation
of tech stocks that it's absurd," he
said at a conference of the Society
of American Business Editors and
Writers. "I would put our company
and I would put most companies in
that category."
The economic factors that
drove stocks lower last week
haven't disappeared. The dollar
lingers near its lowest levels
against Japan's yen since 19%.
Investors also remain worried that
the Federal Reserve at its Oct. 5
meeting will raise interest rates for
the third time this year to cool the
economy.
Higher interest rates can hurt
stocks by cutting into corporate
profits as borrowing costs escalate.
That can make bonds, with their
guaranteed rate of return, more
appealing.
