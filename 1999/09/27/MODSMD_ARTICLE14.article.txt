UCSF-Stanford
move leaves a poor
community in the cold

UCSF-Stanford Health Cart
President Peter Van Etter
and Executive Vice President
William Kerr may have been the firsl
two people to take the fall for the ill
fated UCSF-Stanford merger, but
they certainly aren't the last.
Shortly after it was announced thai
the organization was running at a
$ 10.7-million shortfall in the first
quarter of 1999, administrators
responded by cutting over 2,(WX) posi
tions from both hospitals' support
staff.
Then, as things began to heat up
following a call for a "reassessment"
of the current merger by University ol
California President Richard Atkin
son and Stanford President Gerhard
Casper, Van Etten and Kerr handed
in their resignations. Management of
the organization was subsequently
given to David Hunter of the Hunter
Consulting Group, an allegedly high
priced medical-care consulting firm
known for its stringent cost-cutting
measures.
Last Friday, after much delibera
tion, it was announced that inpatient
and emergency room care will be shut
down at Mount Zion Medical Center
in San Francisco and transferred to
the UCSF Medical Center two miles
away in Parnassus Heights. Mount
Zion, taken over by UCSF in the
early 19905, is said to account for a
significant portion of the organiza
tion's projected $6()-million deficit for
1999.
That point has worried some who
contend that Stanford shouldn't have
to bear the burden of a University of
California hospital and that the center
was already a "problem" when it was
first acquired by UCSF. The loss of

jobs is not the only concern in the
minds of those opposing Mount
Zion's closure. There is also a worry
that the loss of a Medical Center will
effectively limit access to health care
â€¢ in the mostly lower-income-minority
community.
According to California Nurses'
Association spokesman Joe Lindsay,
"Most of those people don't have
cars. If it is closed, there is whole sec
tion of the city that will not be served
by an emergency room."
There is a good chance that Mount
Zion may be responsible for much of
the organization's current deficit. Fur
thermore, it makes little sense to
argue that Mount Zion has always
been financially strapped since the
pre UCSF-Stanford days: administra
tors who approved the merger knew
this going in and apparently they did
nothing about it. However, it is quite
certain that closing inpatient and
emergency-room care will further
restrict access to an extremely vulner
able (and most likely uninsured) seg
ment of society. Though UCSF-Stan
ford may save money, there have
been no proposals to deal with the
potential complications that may arise
from this move. Furthermore, this
move just might serve to prolong an
already painful merger.
The administrators of UCSF-Stan
ford need to take postitive steps to
ensure that this underserved commu
nity can still obtain access to health
care and ensure that Mount Zion
does not deteriorate into a day clinic.
They must also look at this move and
see if it actually addresses the under
lying problems affecting UCSF-Stan
ford Health Care.
II the organization is to fulfill its
post-merger promise of better health
care for all, it needs to come up with
effective solutions rather than just
creating a whole new host of con
cerns.
