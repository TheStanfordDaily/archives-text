Sawislak had the right to
tell her story
I am writing regarding your editorial
("A case of poor judgment") on Sept. 22.
The editorial accuses former assistant
professor Karen Sawislak of "poor judg
ment" for having published an op-ed piece
in I he Chronicle of Higher Education in
which she criticizes Stanford's tenure pro
cess. The editorial accuses her of "poor
judgment" because the matter of her
tenure denial by Gerhard Casper is being
investigated by the Office of Federal Con
tract Compliance along with the cases of a
number of other female faculty at Stan
ford, and according to you. only "officials"
can "make the decision about the fairness
of the process." On that view, no party to
any legal action should ever speak or pub
lish information about their case prior to a
decision made by unnamed "officials."
This is an astounding position for a

newspaper to take in light of the First
Amendment, and if extended heyond the
case of a woman documenting her experi
ences at Stanford, it would preclude any
one arguably discriminated against, any
one who is a victim of a crime or other
wrongdoing, or anyone, period, to write or
speak about their experiences prior to
some ill-defined "official" decision.
An "official" decision may take years;
moreover, numerous factors besides the
merits of any case enter into whether the
government pursues a complaint of sex dis
crimination. Further, "official" decisions
can be and are reversed, so your approach
could deprive the public of important
information and keep secret information
that people need to have to reach their
own conclusions about a matter for years.
In The Daily's view, the women faculty
at Mi l would have been prevented from
disclosing their findings of sex-based dis
crimination at their school, because "offi
cials" had not determined the "facts," and

the University had not yet acknowledged
the discrimination when the information
appeared in newspapers.
Although the tenure decision process is
a delicate one. The Daily would apparent
ly approve complete secrecy about these
decisions, and relevant publics — students,
faculty, the larger community would never
learn of abuses in the process, at least not
from those who are abused.
The editorial also states that Stanford
"had no opportunity to respond" in the
same issue of The Chronicle as the one in
which Sawislak's opinion appeared. Read
ers of The Chronicle are hardly naive and
unsophisticated, nor are they ignorant of
the issue of gender-based discrimination in
tenure at Stanford. Nor is Stanford Uni
versity. with all its resources, powerless to
defend itself against one woman.
Finally, is it The Daily's position that
op-ed pieces must always be run with "the
other side" or not published at all? For
example, ought an op-ed piece stating that

evolution, not creationism, is the proper
explanation for life on Earth be accompa
nied by an op-ed piece saying that a literal
ist interpretation of the Biblical account of
creation is the only truth? If not, it seems
that The Daily would impose a selective
gag order only on those who criticize Stan
ford.
Sawislak was not denied tenure by her
department — quite the contrary. An
appellate review committee found her
denial of tenure to be erroneous. President
Casper ignored the committee majority's
recommendation and reaffirmed the denial
of tenure. The "process" for Sawislak at
Stanford is over; surely she is entitled to
publish information about that denial, and
others are entitled to read it and evaluate it
for themselves.
