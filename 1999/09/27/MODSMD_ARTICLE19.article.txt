### Meghan O'Connor Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team
bounced back from a deflating loss to
San Francisco with a 2-1 home win
over Bradley Saturday night. After
90 minutes of soccer, the Cardinal left
New Maloney Field with its reputa
tion redeemed and confidence boost
ed.
"It was a big game for both
teams," said sophomore midfielder
Derek Shanahan, "they wanted to
prove something and we wanted to
turn around our loss and win at
home."
After losing 3-1 to San Francisco
Tuesday night, the Cardinal (3-2-1)
didn't waste any time proving it
hasn't forgotten how to put the ball in
the back of the net.
Junior forward Luke Rust put in
his fourth goal of the season during
the third minute of play. Senior de
fender Andy Hemmerich got the as
sist by setting up Rust with a corner
kick."
"There's a lot that can make a
game go one way or another." Sha
nahan said, "getting the early goal
makes a big difference."
However, there were still N7 min
utes of plav remaining and it only
took Bradley (4-3) 15 minutes to tie
the game up. Fifth-year senior for

ward Stephen Wylie. third on the all
time Missouri Conference Valley ca
reer assists list with 36, popped the
ball up to teammate freshman mid
fielder Tim Regan, who headed it in
for the score.
"The game started off with a
quick pace, but it slowed down and
we both settled in," sophomore de
fender Lee Morrison said. "I think
we settled down better than them
and we dominated a little more. In
the second half we picked up the in
tensity and played a lot better."

MEN'S SOCCER

â–  Saturday: Stanford (3-2-1) 2
Bradlev (4-3) 1.

Seventeen minutes into the sec
ond half. Stanford capitalized on its
surge of intensity as junior defender
Ryan Nelsen shot in the game-win
ning goal on an assist from Shanahan.
Nelsen, a transfer this season out
of Greensboro College, New
Zealand, is the Royal Sun and Al
liance "Young Player of the Year"
for New Zealand soccer. With the
Cardinal, Nelsen has contributed one
assist this season and has was named
to the All-Tournament Team and
Defensive Player of the Tournament
at the Fresno Tournament earlier
this month.

"I feel everyone contributed, but 1
thought Ryan Nelsen deserves a spe
cial bit of credit," Clark said, "not just
because of his goal, but because of
the way he won the ball in the air and
on the ground in the midfield."
Along with Nelsen, Clark also
noted the strong play of Morrison
and redshirt junior defender Chris
Gores in the air and junior forward
Corey Woolfolk in the front.
"[Woolfolk] always seemed to be
on offer for the ball," Clark said. "Fie
held up for the team and also was
able to turn the opposing defense on
numerous occasions."
In the end it was the team effort
that put Stanford on top.
"In close games like that, the good
teams come out ahead." Shanahan
said. "We put in that extra effort to
show we wanted to win."
"Our victory came from staying in
the battle, keeping focused, and not
losing our nerve," Clark said.
The win marks the 21st win for
Stanford out of the last 23 games
played on home soil. The victory will
boost the confidence of the Cardinal
as it looks forward to two more home
games. October 1 against I larvard
and October 3 against Dartmouth.
The men can now put their two
early losses behind them and hope
their play Saturday w ill serve as a pre
lude of what is to come.
