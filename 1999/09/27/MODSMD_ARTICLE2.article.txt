# Card topples LA, rattles Pac-10
## Walters, Borchard lead high-powered Stanford attack over UCLA 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
Saturday, Stanford's football
team put the finishing touches on a
full U-turn.
The Cardinal knocked off the
defending conference champions,
broke school and league receiving
records and went 3-0 in Pacific 10
Conference play for the first time
since 1971.

All without its starting quarter
back.
Stanford's 42-32 victory over
UCLA was its biggest step back
from a glaring opening-day loss to
Texas in which the Cardinal looked
worse than inept.
After falling 69-17 to the Long
horns. Stanford has rebounded to
win three straight, the last two
against top-20 teams.
Despite the loss of senior signal

caller I'odd I lusak in the first quar
ter to bruised ribs, the Cardinal's
air game turned in its most con
vincing performance to date be
hind sophomore backup Joe Bor
chard, who helped lead Stanford
(3-1, 3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) to
672 yards of offense on a 15-for-19
performance. He threw for five
touchdown passes.
Flanker Troy Walters did his
best to make Borehard's entrance

an easy one. The senior's 278 re
ceiving yards set a Stanford single
game record, and his 98-yard
touchdown catch in the third quar
ter was the longest in Pac-1() histo
ry.
Walters also shattered the
record for career receiving yards by
a Stanford player and came within
11 yards of breaking the Pac-10 sin
gle game receiving record.

■ Saturday: Stanford (3-1,3-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) 42. No. IK UCLA
(3-1.0-1)32.

It was a hig day for the Bor
chard-to-Walters combo. But what
does the win — and the fact that it
solidified Stanford's position atop
the Pac-10 — mean for the team?
Head coach Tyrone Willingham
has his own perspective.
"It means we're 3-0 and won an
other conference game," he said.
"At the end of the year, could it be
significant? Yes. Now it just means
we're 3-0. And that's not bad."
The victory does mean other
things, however. First and fore
most. it means that some Stanford
fans might feel up to saying the
words "rose" and "bowl" in the
same sentence for the first time in
recent memory.
"I'd say they have to be the fron
trunner [in the Pac-10]," said
UCLA head coach Bob Toledo.
"They're 3-0 in the conference,
they beat the defending champion
and they played very well today."
The last time the Cardinal had a
3-oconference record, the year was
1971, Stanford was on the way to
the Rose Bowl and the team's
