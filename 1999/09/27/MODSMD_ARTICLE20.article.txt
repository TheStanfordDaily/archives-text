Saturday. Stanford met the same
UCLA squad (5-1.1-0 MPSF) that it
had beaten a week before in the
Southern California tournament.
But this time the Bruins "came out
really intense." according to Stan
ford senior Sean Joy. And untortu
nately, Stanford "wasn't prepared
for the intensity of the game." said
head coach Dante Dettamanti. In a

closely contested defensive battle,
the Cardinal fell to UCLA, 6-5.
The game was "a story of missed
opportunities" for the Cardinal ac
cording to Dettamanti. Early in the
first quarter two UCLA players were
. ejected, giving tbe Cardinal a 6-on-4
advantage. Yet Stanford was unable
to capitalize. With 3:44 to go in the
period Bruin Matt Armato scored,
putting UCLA ahead 1-0.
In the second quarter three Stan
ford kickouts gave UCLA three
man-up opportunities to score. How
ever. fine Cardinal defense, led by
redshirt freshman goalie Nick Ellis,
prevented any goals. Near the end of
the quarter Stanford had an opportu
nity to tie the game on a counterat
tack. with senior Brian Heifferon
one-on-one against UCLA's goalie.
Yet the Cardinal came away empty
handed. ending the first half trailing
1-0.
In the third period. Stanford
fought back. With 6:19 to go, the Car
dinal got called for a four-meter
penalty. The Bruin penalty shot hit
the sidebar, preventing UCLA from
increasing its lead, and Stanford
gained some momentum. With 1:19
left, redshirt sophomore Pasi Dutton

scored, tying the game at one. A
minute later senior Jon Skaalen
scored a two-point goal, putting the
Cardinal ahead 3-1. But the Bruins
cooled Stanford's fire, responding
with a goal as the quarter came to an
end. narrowing Stanford's lead to 3-
2.
Stanford began the fourth period
with a four-meter penalty. This time

the Bruins converted to tie the score
at three. With 4:29 left. Dutton tal
lied once again for the Cardinal. His
two-point goal off a pass from hole
man Mark Amott put Stanford up 5-
3.
But once again UCLA came right
back. After a Stanford kickout with
3:53 to go. Armato took a shot which
was tipped, throwing off Ellis. The

two-point shot went in. tying the
score at five. Stanford shut down the
Bruins for the next three and a half
minutes, but with 22 seconds to go
and the Stanford defense out of
place. UCLA holeman Sean Kern
was able to score, giving the Bruins
the 6-5 victory.
While it played well, the Cardinal
team did not get enough offensive
production to win: Stanford's first
goal didn't even come until the third
quarter. And with a pair of two-point
goals. Stanford only put three balls
into the net.
"You simply can't win a collegiate
water polo game with that kind of
scoring" said Dettamanti.
On defense. Stanford received an
incredible performance from Ellis,
who finished the game with 14 saves
in the goal. However. Dettamanti
said the team defense had some let
downs. The final goal by Kern was
especially frustrating for the Cardi
nal team after it had shut down the
talented holeman all day long.
After the disappointing loss to
UCLA, the Cardinal had a difficult
time getting up for Sunday's game
against UC-Irvine (2-4. 0-1 MPSF).
According to Jov. the Stanford team

"came out really slow."
While Stanford "didn't play that
well against Irvine," the team
"played well enough to win" Detta
manti said. After a sluggish first half,
the Cardinal turned it on. winning 8-
5. » .■•••'it*
Stanford scored first on a goal h\
redshirt sophomore Todd Snider
with 5:12 to go in the first quarter.
Much like the Bruins, the Anteaters
came right back, tying the score at
one on a goal by Dan Hayes. With a
minute to go. a Cardinal ejection and
the resulting 6-on-5 for Irvine led to
another goal by Hayes, putting the
Anteaters ahead 2-1 at the end of the
first quarter.
Stanford came alive in the second
quarter. With five minutes to go. ju
nior Peter Osborn scored on a coun
terattack. As the quarter came to an
end. senior Mike Lipinski scored
from the hole, giving Stanford a 3-2
lead.
In the third quarter, goals b\
freshman Jeff Nesmith. sophomore
Onno Koelman and Joy put Stanford
ahead 6-4. Joy scored two more goals
in the fourth quarter, one on a 6-on-5
