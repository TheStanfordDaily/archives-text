# Walters blows by Bruins with record day
## Senior wideout narrowing in on Pac-10 records for catches, receiving yards 
### Tim Kane 
Maybe Troy Walters just won't
admit it.
"Naw, I'm not even thinking
about that... I just want to keep win
ning games," said the star Cardinal
wideout when asked if he would be
calling the I leisman Trophy commit
tee, minutes after he torched the
UCLA secondary for nine recep
tions and 278 yards, including three
touchdowns, Saturday in the Stan
ford's 42-32 win.
If you're not Troy Walters, how
ever, one look at his stats over the
course of the relavtively young sea
son indicates that someone should be
placing a call to the Downtown Ath
letic Club.
In four games, he has 30 catches
f0r615 yards and four touchdown re
ceptions. stats on par with those of
the player considered one of the fa
vorites for the Heisman, Florida
State's Peter Warric k.
And it's not like Walters has been
piling it on against weaker oppo
nents, three of Stanford's four oppo
nents this season. Texas, Arizona,
and IJCLA, have been ranked in the
AP top 25.
On Saturday, Walters was a thorn
in the side of UCLA's defense. The
Bruins inexplicably left Walters in
single coverage most of the game,
which is surprising considering that
UCLA coach Hob Toledo referred
to Walters after the game as "proba
bly the leading receiver in the history
of [the Pacific 10 Conference!"
Walters accounted for all the
yardage on two touchdown drives
which demonstrated his consider
able skills: one consisting of a 50-yard
reception followed by a 30-yard
touchdown catch, the other simply a
98-yard slant that set a Pac-10 record
for the longest touchdown reception.
The 50-yard reception was
demonstrative of Walters' great
hands — the catch was made as he
was falling down, tipping the ball to
himself and gathering it in just before
he hit the ground.
Walters' speed was the reason for
the 98-yard touchdown, as he simply
ran by the cornerback covering him.
caught the ball at the 50-yard line,
and sprinted off to the end zone.
"When you see Troy Walters
lined up out there on someone, you
think you want to get him the ball,
and that's about all there is to it." said
Cardinal backup quarterback Joe

scored on a 13-vard pass lo I )eßon
nic I'itts. making the score 42-32
and finally putting the game out of
reach.

kickoff alter Walters' catch, when

Borchard, "He's a big-time player
and he's going to make big-time
plays."
Borchard stepped in for an in
jured Todd Husak in the second
quarter and was on the other end of
Walters' three touchdown passes,
finishing 15 of 19 for 324 yards on the
day.
Head Coach Tyrone Willingham
is of a similar mindset. "You'd expect
him to step up when your team needs
it and make big plays," said Willing
ham.
Walters is making a video includ
ing bits from the games as well as the
locker room for the duration of this
season. When asked what the
episode for Saturday would be
called, Walters smiled and said.
"Man ... I don't know."
How about "Walters for Heis
man?"
freshman Lovell Houston returned
the ball 95 yards untouched for a
touchdown.
It was the first time I louston had
touched the ball in his college ca
reer. and his return was the first
Bruin touchdown return in 19
years.
The Bruin defense stopped
Stanford again, and after junior
Sean l olpinrud's punt went only 13
yards, the Bruins were able to score
another touchdown on a seven
yard run by Foster, cutting the
score to 2S-17.
Then, after the Cardinal had
added seven points on yet another
Walters touchdown, the Bruins
were able to march down the field
after the Cardinal kickoffand score
again on a one-yard run bv Foster.

Walters vs. UCLA
Nine receptions, 278 yards (Stanford single
game record, third-best in Pac-10 history),
three touchdowns. Pac-10 record 98-yard
touchdown reception.

The score was 35-25.
But the Stanford defense looked
its worst in a long time on the next
drive, when the Bruins moved the
ball almost at will SO yards for a
four-yard touchdown run by junior
quarterback Drew Bennett, cut
ting the score to a nai 1-bitinglv
close score, 35-32.
"Any good football team always
mounts a charge," Willingham
said. "We knew a two-time defend
ing Pac-10 Champion would mount
a charge. What you hope for is that
your young men have enough
poise, enough composure and
enough character to rise up and
find a way to make a play.
"1 think our offense stepped up
at a very crucial time. Joe [Bor
ehard] played tough and Deßonnie

Pitts did a great job of digging and
getting into the end /one."
Borehard also made liberal use
of Pitts, throwing the senior touch
down passes of eight and 12 yards
and completing two passes for 59
yards to junior Dave Davis.
I'he Cardinal's offensive attack
will get another test next week
against San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium. But even though the two
teafns that many preseason pundits
posited to be the strongest in the
Pac-I() — Arizona and UCLA
have fallen to the Cardinal, the
team is wary of becoming overcon
fident.
"I now think we're a marked
team." Walters said. "We're on top
of the Pac-1(). so now teams are
going to be gunning for us."
