# Vintage pushes auditions to winter

Prospective members of one of
Stanford's most popular dance
groups will have to wait for January
to audition.
The directors and members of
the Vintage Dance Ensemble have
postponed the auditions for the
group until winter quarter, when
Drama Lecturer Richard Powers
returns from his sabbatical.
"We considered the possibility
of the assistant directors holding

auditions while I'm away, but
everyone seemed to be more com
fortable with my being there for the
auditions." said Powers, head of
Vintage and an instructor in the
dance division of the drama depart
ment.
Powers said the postponement
will not affect the performing
group's schedule. He said this year's
repertoire is focused on Ragtime
(ca. 1900-1915) dances, which "re
quire the least technique of the eras
which Vintage covers."
"Ragtime dance is the closest to

natural walking," he said. "So we
will be able to come up to speed
quickly. No problem."
Following the popular trend in
swing and social dance in general,
competition for Vintage has been
increasing. One hundred students
auditioned for 20 spaces this year.
Powers said he was unsure of how
many to expect this year.
" The hard part for me was that
most of them were well qualified,
with quite a bit of previous dance
experience, training, stage skills
and personal flair," he said. "I

couldn't say 'you're not good
enough' to the SO who didn't make
it because they were good enough,"
he said. "We simply didn't have
room for all of the hopefuls."
Despite the intense competition,
auditions for Vintage are "made to
be fun," said sophomore Vintage
member F.nima James. "Though
tryouts last year were challenging,
they weren't stressful, and I remem
ber having a lot of fun dancing with
people and learning choreograph.
"It's not so much experience, but
your ability and desire to learn that
matter. If you really love to dance,
your enthusiasm will come through,
and your partners who take part in
the audition process will remember
you."
This year's ensemble repertoire
will differ from the past in several
aspects.
"We will focus on a new era. with
new costumes, new dances and new
music," Powers said.
" The Ragtime-era dances were
the first versions of dances which
were to become today's standards:
the first Argentine tango, the first
foxtrot, the first foundations for the
Brazilian samba, the first blues and
the like," he said.
Vintage will also rewrite and
restage a piece called " 100 Much
Moxic" to be performed in spring.
The ensemble will audition some
acting talent for a half-do/en speak
ing roles in the production.
In addition. Carl Flink, former
member of a prestigious dance
troupe and Vintage, will be choreo
graphing a piece "which will niorph
vintage social dance with postmod
ern dance," Powers said.
