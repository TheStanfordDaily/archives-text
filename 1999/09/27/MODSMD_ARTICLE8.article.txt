## New drug could reduce flu cases 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€”
An inhaled prescription drug
being introduced next month is
nearly <X() percent effective in keep
ing lamily members from getting
the flu bug when a relative brings it
home, according to a new study.
The medicine, called Relenza,
is a powder spray inhaled through
the mouth that has already been
proven to reduce the duration of a
bout of llu by a day or two. The
study released Sunday shows it
also cuts the chances of catching
the llu from an ill relative by 79
percent.
The drug is the first of a new
class of anti-viral medicines that
are effective against both major
strains of the disease, known as
influenza A and B.
"These drugs are a major step
forward." said Dr. Frederick Hav
den of the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville. "The latest data
show that they clearly work for
prevention as well."
Relenza was approved in July
by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and is made by
Glaxo Wellcome. Inc. The compa
ny says it will be on drugstore
shelves Friday. I he wholesale cost
for enough to treat one bout of flu
will be $37.
Hayden presented the latest
data at a meeting of the American
Society of Microbiology, as well as
a report on another drug that is the
first to shorten a bout of the com
mon cold. Glaxo Wellcome paid
for the study.
Between 25 million and 50 mil

lion Americans typically get the llu
each winter. Doctors emphasize
that the llu vaccine is the best way
to ward off the disease, but the
new drugs should help when peo
ple fail to get the shots.
Often, youngsters bring home
the llu to their parents and siblings
from school and day care. The lat
est experiment was intended to see
if family members could be pro
tected by taking Relenza at the
first sign of llu in the family.
Last fall. 975 families with
school-age children volunteered to
participate in the study. Between
December and March, 337 of these
families had a case of llu. The sick
person and the rest of the family
were randomly assigned to get
either the drug or a look-alike
dummy spray.
Overall, four percent of the
folks in the families getting Relen
za came down with the flu. com
pared with 19 percent in the
untreated comparison families.
Even when they did get sick, their
disease appeared to be far milder.
Flu in the Relenza-treated family
members typically lasted three
days, compared with about six
days in the comparison group.
"This is an important aspect of
the drug that could reduce the bur
den of influenza," said Dr. William
Craig of the University of Wiscon
sin.
One drawback to these
medicines is that they must he
started within the first day or two
of symptoms to have any effect on
the disease.
