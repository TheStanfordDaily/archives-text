# Quayle quits presidential race

WASHINGTON (AP) — For
mer Vice President Dan Quayle has
decided to drop out of the Republi
can presidential race, after deter
mining that he can't compete with
George W. Bush's fund-raising jug
gernaut, the Associated Press
learned Sunday.
Ouavle will announce his inten
tions at a news conference Monday
in Phoenix, Ariz., said a senior cam
paign official, who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity.
His departure winnows the GOP
field to eight major Republican can
didates. and will increase specula
tion about the finance and political
health of the remaining contenders.
Conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan is on the brink of bolting
the GOP to seek the Reform Party
nomination.
The Ouavle official said Quayle
decided to quit this weekend, after
consulting with his wife, Marilyn,
and campaign manager Kyle
McSlarrow.
The braintrust determined that
Ouavle could not raise enough
money to compete deep into the
primary season, even if he fared
well in New Hampshire, the first-in
the-nation primary state.
Bush, the two-term Texas gover
nor. has raised more than $50 mil
lion — five times that of his nearest
challenger. Quayle has been run
ning a debt since early in the cam
paign.
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, for
mer Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander and Sen. Bob Smith til
New Hampshire dropped out of the
GOP primary contest earlier this
year.
Kasich endorsed Bush. Alexan
der. like Ouavle. cited Bush's fund

raising prowess as a reason for leav
ing. Smith is considering a third
party bid.
Quayle's announcement comes
as the remaining campaigns prepare
to file their campaign finance state
ments that will disclose how well or
poorly their fund-raising operations
are doing. Quayle is not the only
Republican candidate having a hard
time raising money.
Former American Red Cross
president Elizabeth Dole is also
aggressively trying to raise money
to compete against Bush. Her situa
tion may be even more precarious,
given the fact that she is courting
the same moderate and establish
ment Republicans as Bush.
Quayle is still convinced he could
fare well — even win — the New
Hampshire primary. But even so,
the concentrated primary calendar
would give him little time to raise
enough money.
Quayle entered the race on April
14 in his hometown of Huntington.
Ind., saying he wanted to rebuild
American values after "a dishonest
decade of Bill Clinton and A 1
Gore."
Seeking office for the first time
since he and President Bush were
beaten by Clinton and Vice Presi
dent Gore in 1992. the former Indi
ana senator sought to push beyond
a history of political gaffes and con
troversies. "Murphy Brown is
gone," he said, "and I'm still here
fighting for the American family."
Quayle's use of the TV sitcom in
the 1992 campaign to highlight a
"poverty of values" brought him
criticism and ridicule from some
quarters. But he returned to I he
theme in his announcement speech,
betting that primary voters will

reward him for casting a spotlight
on the family-values debate.
Quavle pitched a 30-percent,
across-the-board tax cut. billing it as
a boon to middle-income families.
He also portrayed himself as the
best qualified potential comman
der-in-chief. recalling his participa
tion in White House war councils.
The former vice president was

always considered a long shot for
the nomination despite his popular
ity among grass-roots activists and
his strong organization in New
Hampshire.
But he came to realize that the
primary calendar and Bush's huge
bank account were two obstacles
that he would never be able to sur
mount.
