# 'Matrix,' projector impress at Flicks
## 
### Heather Wax 
After 60 years of using the same
projector. Stanford Student Enter
prises' decision to buy a new one last
year seemed as timely as the riffs on
cyberspace and the electronic envi
ronment in"The Matrix."
Students had come to expect a
blurred picture and warped sound if
the old machine was bumped or mis
aligned. said Flicks program manag
er Matthew Salazar. more amiably
known as the Flicks Guy.
The new projector and " The Ma
trix" — two items with hefty price
tags — opened the fall Flicks season
Sunday night in Memorial Auditori
um. Hut unlike the large-grossing
sci-fi film, the projector may take a
while to turn hugely profitable.
While Salazar would not get into
all the financial details, he did say
that the business is "doing fine."
with a "great opening weekend
helping to get the year off to a good
start."
Stanford Student Enterprises
fully funded the project with what
Sean Lucy, SSE CEO / Financial
Manager, called "some substantial
investments," adding that they
would "probably depreciate them
over a few years."
So far. none of the cash needed
to pay off the equipment has come
directly out of moviegoers' pockets.
"We didn't raise ticket prices to
accommodate. We absorbed the
cost because the old one was insuffi
cient." Lucy said.
Lucy helped install the projector,
which is the same kind used in the
AMCMercado 20Theaters in Santa
Clara.
Students attending Sunday
night's sci-fi film consistently gave
the new machine a resounding
thumbs up.
"Looking at it tonight, it looked
absolutely professional, and I'm in
clined to think it wasn't that way
when I was a freshman." said junior
Cameron Ring. "1 could have been
in any movie theater anywhere. It
was sharp."
But those at the season opening
may have been more abuzz over the
movie's special effects and kungfu se
quences than the machine that pro
jected them. Salazar is "very happy
with the schedule" which he says is
"more exciting than it's been in a long
time."
The fall schedule includes " The
Blair Witch Project" on Halloween
and "Star Wars: Episode I" on the
night of Big Game.
Flicks, which chooses its movies
by what Salazar jokes is a "highly sci
entific process," poured over distrib

utor catalogues, haggled for prices
and sent the picks to the Flicks and
Axe Committee mailing lists for sug
gestions.
But even with the new projector
and blockbuster movies, the most dis
cussed topic at the opening of Flicks
could easily have been the chairs.
"We had a slight snag and sold out.
We had to turn people away at the
door," said Salazar. "But we really re
gret turning people away and we
hope to see more people come out."
Stanford students can vie for seats
at regular F licks shows every Sunday
at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. Tickets are $4
per show, and a season pass costs $18.
