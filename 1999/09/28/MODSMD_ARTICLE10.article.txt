## Editor's notebook Reliving freshman year 
### 
A Daily editor spends
his senior year among
the frosh

WHEN PEOPLE find out
that I live in an all-frosh
dorm, their initial response
is usually something to the effect of.
"( 001, so you're an R A?" No. "()h. so
are you the HAA? Or the RCC?"
Nothing so glamorous, I 'm afraid.
By the time that they find out that
I am merely the roommate of a staff
member, the responses vary. I get
questions about not having any pre
ferred housing years left, about trying
to make up for an inadequate fresh
man year, about being delirious when
I made the decision.
Maybe I should clear up a few
things now. I drew unpreferred my
sophomore year in anticipation of a
quarter at Hopkins Marine Station
that never panned out. I did live in an
all-frosh dorm during the "appropri
ate" year and had an excellent time,
despite that dorm's undue reputation
for being socially listless. And yes, I
was perfectly sober when I accepted
my housing assignment last spring.
Ilie real story is admittedly not ter
ribly interesting. Basically, I valued
whom I would live with more than
where I would live. That I would end
up surrounded by a very large num
ber of lrosh was a concern, but not
enough to make me abandon my
roommate for the chance to draw into
a more popular residence (or the risk
of drawing into a less desirable one).
This year, I am faced with the
results of my decision, and I'm glad to
say that I have no regrets. These last
few days have been exhilarating, to
say the least. After two years of
upper-class housing, I had forgotten

how much energy a hundred frosh can
contain — the novelty of Stanford
definitely has not worn off yet for
them.
In the midst of all of this, I've been
trying to figure out how I fit in. To
some extent I've found myself getting
caught up in the excitement of pre
parties and Flicks paper fights. But
with my three extra years at Stanford
that my dormmates lack, I can't help
feeling somewhat removed. I am
older, perhaps not wiser, hut definite
ly more experienced. I knew what
sorts of icebreakers the staff would
spring on the frosh. I was not sur
prised when the Band arrived that
first Friday night for its traditional
frosh all-campus. Nor was the agenda
of the first house meeting any mystery
to me.
As such, I don't consider myself
"just one of the frosh," in name or in
spirit, and for the most part, nor do
the frosh. It's a bit saddening; it means
that it will take a greater effort for me
to get to know all of my dormmates.
I'm still struggling with remembering
half of their names. I doubt I've even
talked to everyone in the dorm yet.
But I still feel like a part of the
dorm community. Even though I
might not have a perfectly defined
role, the loyalty and camaraderie are
there. I will be there for the dorm
functions. I will join in the late-night
games of ping pong and Frisbee golf. 1
will cheer as loudly as any other resi
dent in support of our dorm.
To some extent, I regret never hav
ing been a dorm staff member. I've
had other commitments, I suppose
(thanks to six consecutive editor in
chiefs ...). But being able to live with
frosh my senior year might be the
next best thing.
