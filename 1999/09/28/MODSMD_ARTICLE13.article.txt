Professors support Saw lis
lak's actions
The editorial that The Daily ran on Sept.
22 ("A case of poor judgement") criticizes
former Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawislak
for "poor judgment" in using a public forum
to raise questions about the tenure process at
Stanford. We believe that Sawislak has every
right to initiate a public discussion of her
case. This is an effective use of freedom of
speech, a freedom whose importance is man
ifestly clear when an individual goes up
against a major institution such as Stanford.
Stanford has many economic and legal
resources at its disposal which are not open
to Karen Sawislak. While the courts may be
a "proper channel" for redress, they are not
the only place for individuals to seek a hear
ing (and some worthy cases never even get
to court.) Finally, the larger issues of the
Sawislak case should be of interest to every
one involved in education. These include
issues of accountability, fairness, gender
equity and democracy. They also concern
the nature of the University — in the case of
Stanford, and more generally. How can a
newspaper oppose the broad dissemination
of information?
With regard to the case itself, we have
been disappointed bv the Stanford Adminis
tration's behavior for two and a half years,
ever since former Dean John Shoven turned
down Prof. Sawislak's promotion against the
almost unanimous (one abstention) vote of
the History Department and the nearly
unanimous (5-to-l, according to documents
she has made public) vote of the Appoint
ments and Promotions Committee. When
her grievance went to the University's high
level Advisory Board, they also spoke clear
ly in Sawislak's favor. Four of the six faculty
members of this highest Board determined
that Dean Shoven had no "compelling rea
son" to turn down Sawislak's tenure. But
President Casper rejected the judgment of
the University's own appeals process to
grant Sawislak tenure, offering her the
option of returning to Stanford as an Assis
tant Professor and starting the whole process
over. Sensibly, Sawislak refused to subject
herself yet again to the kinds of arbitrary
decisions that this University has shamed
itself by doling out to her.
This is the context in which Karen .Sawis
lak has decided to sever her ties with Stan
ford and raise her concerns with a wider
audience. Stanford is a large, wealthy, and
powerful institution that is fully able to make
the best possible case for its behavior toward
her. It is distressing to see our student news
paper rally behind the University and criti
cize public debate and dissent.

Sawlislak had right to express
herself
I have just finished reading, with aston
ishment, your editorial on Karen Sawislak's
decision to publish a public letter in The
Chronicle of Higher Education regarding
her tenure struggle at Stanford. Your posi
tion, that her decision to publicly discuss her
case in that forum was unwise and her
motives for doing so unclear, is somewhat
mystifying. The Chronicle is a news organ
dedicated entirely to academic issues and
has covered nationwide tenure issues for the
past several years. The issue of tenure, gen
der and race has been an issue which has
raged throughout elite private institutions
across the country for many years.

As an organ of the free press, how can
The Daily suggest as a bona fide national
issue, the issue of discriminatory and arbi
trary promotion and tenure policies he
resolved behind closed doors, or kept strict
ly within the confines of the Stanford cam
pus? For over two years, students and facul
ty rallied behind Karen's case as a means to
bring the tenure process out of the back
rooms and open it to wider scrutiny to deter
mine if the process was fair. At every turn,
the University has obfuscated, attempted to
deflect, and outright stonewalled every
attempt made by the coalition which formed
behind Karen Sawislak to get a straight
answer as to why Karen had been denied.
President Casper's statement to the San
Francisco Chronicle last year that "no one
earns tenure," only served to further our sus
picions that tenure decisions conducted in
private were subject to no established stan
dard or precedent, and that the University
was intent on reserving the right to promote
on a "because we say so" basis.
Karen Sawislak had the courage to chal
lenge the arbitrary and apparently discrimi
natory process which passes for fairness at
Stanford, first, through the system, and then
through the campus press. The outside press
sought her out, not vice versa. Her decision
to publish in The Chronicle was a carefully
measured decision to publish her story as a
service to young academics, not only women
or people of color, whose academic work in
any way challenges the established canons of
academic fields.
Your inference that her choice to publish
now in a national venue might be either sell
serving or vengeful is nonsensical. The
Department of Labor has all this informa
tion, and any action which might make it into
a court of law will not be decided by publici
ty, but (one would hope) on its legal merits.
What would you have her do? Suffer her
decision in silence and go quietly into the
long dark night? Unfortunately, the Univer
sity would love for her do just that, but
Karen's struggle and the struggle of students
and faculty in supporting her was based on
the idea that justice is never well-served
when deliberations on such matters are con
ducted behind closed doors and not open to
any mechanism of independent review.
Perhaps you are unaware that in the I lis
tory Department we have in residence both
the first Jew and the first woman to be hired
by that department, and that at the time both
generated considerable controversy because
of their ethnicity and gender. Perhaps you
are unaware that Estelle Freedman, as the
first woman tenured in U.S. History, is still
the only woman tenured in U.S. History
after nearly two decades. Discrimination in
tenure is not ancient history at Stanford.
Not along ago, women who had been sex
ually assaulted were expected to suffer in
silence in this society. Your inference that
Karen should similarly not air the sordid
details of the injustice done to her has some
ugly parallels to that idea. By publishing her
story and providing documentation she has
invited readers to view the evidence —the
exact evidence provided her by the adminis
tration — on which the administration
based its denial. If Stanford wants to present
its side, it is free to do so.
As far as her decision to go through the
process again, as offered by President
Casper, imagine running a marathon and
having the officials tell you can immediately
run it again to improve your time. Hie pro
cess is just as grueling. Why would anyone
put themselves through that again? I ler deci
sion to reject Casper's offer was based on a
complete lack of evidence that things would
be different a second time around, and an
understandable suspicion that the adminis

(ration would simply use the second review
as a legitimation of their original decision.
In closing, why wouldn't anyone with a
strong sense of justice and social values feel
compelled to tell the story that Karen did? I
don't think you understand the career-killing
implications of Karen's breaking the unspo
ken code of silence which young academics
tacitly agree to when they accept positions at
private universities like Stanford. What
Karen did was to cast light on a process
which depends on the darkness to allow the
institution to have absolute prerogative on
hiring and firing while maintaining the illu
sion that the process is scrupulously and dis
interestedly fair. A young academic signs on
to maintaining the illusion that tenure is
about protecting free expression and lives in
fear and silence for seven years, all the while
knowing that a department head, a dean, a
provost, or a president can arbitrarily demol
ish their dreams and not have to answer for
it. 1 would urge you to talk to the professors
now on the tenure track: and ask them how
free they feel to express themselves on uni
versity policy or controversial academic or
intellectual issues. Ask them how confident
they feel after hearing our president articu
late that "no one earns tenure." Ask them if
they still feel they made the right decision
coming to Stanford. Tabulate the results
based 011 race, gender, sexual orientation
and academic approach and see what
emerges. Karen Sawislak did not create this
problem by speaking publicly, she revealed
it. Isn't that what freedom of inquiry is all
about?

exact evidence provided her by the adminis
tration — on which the administration
based its denial. If Stanford wants to present
its side, it is free to do so.
As far as her decision to go through the
process again, as offered by President
Casper, imagine running a marathon and
having the officials tell you can immediately
run it again to improve your time. Hie pro
cess is just as grueling. Why would anyone
put themselves through that again? I ler deci
sion to reject Casper's offer was based on a
complete lack of evidence that things would
be different a second time around, and an
understandable suspicion that the adminis

(ration would simply use the second review
as a legitimation of their original decision.
In closing, why wouldn't anyone with a
strong sense of justice and social values feel
compelled to tell the story that Karen did? I
don't think you understand the career-killing
implications of Karen's breaking the unspo
ken code of silence which young academics
tacitly agree to when they accept positions at
private universities like Stanford. What
Karen did was to cast light on a process
which depends on the darkness to allow the
institution to have absolute prerogative on
hiring and firing while maintaining the illu
sion that the process is scrupulously and dis
interestedly fair. A young academic signs on
to maintaining the illusion that tenure is
about protecting free expression and lives in
fear and silence for seven years, all the while
knowing that a department head, a dean, a
provost, or a president can arbitrarily demol
ish their dreams and not have to answer for
it. 1 would urge you to talk to the professors
now on the tenure track: and ask them how
free they feel to express themselves on uni
versity policy or controversial academic or
intellectual issues. Ask them how confident
they feel after hearing our president articu
late that "no one earns tenure." Ask them if
they still feel they made the right decision
coming to Stanford. Tabulate the results
based 011 race, gender, sexual orientation
and academic approach and see what
emerges. Karen Sawislak did not create this
problem by speaking publicly, she revealed
it. Isn't that what freedom of inquiry is all
about?

Professors support Saw lis

The editorial that The Daily ran on Sept.
22 ("A case of poor judgement") criticizes
former Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawislak
for "poor judgment" in using a public forum
to raise questions about the tenure process at
Stanford. We believe that Sawislak has every
right to initiate a public discussion of her
case. This is an effective use of freedom of
speech, a freedom whose importance is man
ifestly clear when an individual goes up
against a major institution such as Stanford.
Stanford has many economic and legal
resources at its disposal which are not open
to Karen Sawislak. While the courts may be
a "proper channel" for redress, they are not
the only place for individuals to seek a hear
ing (and some worthy cases never even get
to court.) Finally, the larger issues of the
Sawislak case should be of interest to every
one involved in education. These include
issues of accountability, fairness, gender
equity and democracy. They also concern
the nature of the University — in the case of
Stanford, and more generally. How can a
newspaper oppose the broad dissemination
of information?
With regard to the case itself, we have
been disappointed bv the Stanford Adminis
tration's behavior for two and a half years,
ever since former Dean John Shoven turned
down Prof. Sawislak's promotion against the
almost unanimous (one abstention) vote of
the History Department and the nearly
unanimous (5-to-l, according to documents
she has made public) vote of the Appoint
ments and Promotions Committee. When
her grievance went to the University's high
level Advisory Board, they also spoke clear
ly in Sawislak's favor. Four of the six faculty
members of this highest Board determined
that Dean Shoven had no "compelling rea
son" to turn down Sawislak's tenure. But
President Casper rejected the judgment of
the University's own appeals process to
grant Sawislak tenure, offering her the
option of returning to Stanford as an Assis
tant Professor and starting the whole process
over. Sensibly, Sawislak refused to subject
herself yet again to the kinds of arbitrary
decisions that this University has shamed
itself by doling out to her.
This is the context in which Karen .Sawis
lak has decided to sever her ties with Stan
ford and raise her concerns with a wider
audience. Stanford is a large, wealthy, and
powerful institution that is fully able to make
the best possible case for its behavior toward
her. It is distressing to see our student news
paper rally behind the University and criti
cize public debate and dissent.

Sawlislak had right to express
herself
I have just finished reading, with aston
ishment, your editorial on Karen Sawislak's
decision to publish a public letter in The
Chronicle of Higher Education regarding
her tenure struggle at Stanford. Your posi
tion, that her decision to publicly discuss her
case in that forum was unwise and her
motives for doing so unclear, is somewhat
mystifying. The Chronicle is a news organ
dedicated entirely to academic issues and
has covered nationwide tenure issues for the
past several years. The issue of tenure, gen
der and race has been an issue which has
raged throughout elite private institutions
across the country for many years.

As an organ of the free press, how can
The Daily suggest as a bona fide national
issue, the issue of discriminatory and arbi
trary promotion and tenure policies he
resolved behind closed doors, or kept strict
ly within the confines of the Stanford cam
pus? For over two years, students and facul
ty rallied behind Karen's case as a means to
bring the tenure process out of the back
rooms and open it to wider scrutiny to deter
mine if the process was fair. At every turn,
the University has obfuscated, attempted to
deflect, and outright stonewalled every
attempt made by the coalition which formed
behind Karen Sawislak to get a straight
answer as to why Karen had been denied.
President Casper's statement to the San
Francisco Chronicle last year that "no one
earns tenure," only served to further our sus
picions that tenure decisions conducted in
private were subject to no established stan
dard or precedent, and that the University
was intent on reserving the right to promote
on a "because we say so" basis.
Karen Sawislak had the courage to chal
lenge the arbitrary and apparently discrimi
natory process which passes for fairness at
Stanford, first, through the system, and then
through the campus press. The outside press
sought her out, not vice versa. Her decision
to publish in The Chronicle was a carefully
measured decision to publish her story as a
service to young academics, not only women
or people of color, whose academic work in
any way challenges the established canons of
academic fields.
Your inference that her choice to publish
now in a national venue might be either sell
serving or vengeful is nonsensical. The
Department of Labor has all this informa
tion, and any action which might make it into
a court of law will not be decided by publici
ty, but (one would hope) on its legal merits.
What would you have her do? Suffer her
decision in silence and go quietly into the
long dark night? Unfortunately, the Univer
sity would love for her do just that, but
Karen's struggle and the struggle of students
and faculty in supporting her was based on
the idea that justice is never well-served
when deliberations on such matters are con
ducted behind closed doors and not open to
any mechanism of independent review.
Perhaps you are unaware that in the I lis
tory Department we have in residence both
the first Jew and the first woman to be hired
by that department, and that at the time both
generated considerable controversy because
of their ethnicity and gender. Perhaps you
are unaware that Estelle Freedman, as the
first woman tenured in U.S. History, is still
the only woman tenured in U.S. History
after nearly two decades. Discrimination in
tenure is not ancient history at Stanford.
Not along ago, women who had been sex
ually assaulted were expected to suffer in
silence in this society. Your inference that
Karen should similarly not air the sordid
details of the injustice done to her has some
ugly parallels to that idea. By publishing her
story and providing documentation she has
invited readers to view the evidence —the
exact evidence provided her by the adminis
tration — on which the administration
based its denial. If Stanford wants to present
its side, it is free to do so.
As far as her decision to go through the
process again, as offered by President
Casper, imagine running a marathon and
having the officials tell you can immediately
run it again to improve your time. Hie pro
cess is just as grueling. Why would anyone
put themselves through that again? I ler deci
sion to reject Casper's offer was based on a
complete lack of evidence that things would
be different a second time around, and an
understandable suspicion that the adminis

(ration would simply use the second review
as a legitimation of their original decision.
In closing, why wouldn't anyone with a
strong sense of justice and social values feel
compelled to tell the story that Karen did? I
don't think you understand the career-killing
implications of Karen's breaking the unspo
ken code of silence which young academics
tacitly agree to when they accept positions at
private universities like Stanford. What
Karen did was to cast light on a process
which depends on the darkness to allow the
