### Irene Noguchi Contributing writer 
Greek leaders from organiza
tions around campus kicked off the
school year with their annual retreat
Sunday morning, convening with
administrators at the Lucy Stern
Center in Palo Alto to discuss Issues
including tolerance and to prepare
for major activities such as the up
coming Theta Breakers race.
Focusing not just on the individ
ual fraternities and sororities, but
also on the African-American Fra
ternal and Sororal Association,
Inter-Fraternity Council and Inter-
Sorority Council, 46 undergraduates
and several faculty members lis
tened as speakers addressed stereo
types in the Greek system, diversity
and recruitment of new members.
With the influx of freshmen and
other returning undergraduates, the
groups have already planned an al
cohol education program (spon
sored by Sigma Chi) for Oct. 7.
Theta Breakers itself is expected
to attract many participants on
Homecoming Weekend and usually
raises more than $20,(XX) for Child
Advocates of San Jose. On an annu
al basis, this is the largest donation in
Santa Clara County to Child Advo

cates, an organization that provides
mentors to youth going through the
court system.
Groups at the retreat also pro
moted cross-collaboration of differ
ent fraternities and sororities.
"Each group has a different iden
tity, but sometimes issues and de
sires are similar," said Nanci Howe,
assistant dean of students and one of
the directors of student activities
presiding over the retreat. "Hope
fully, we'll see Greek leadership
working more collaboratively to
gether and co-sponsoring pro
grams."
"I found it beneficial to be with
the other leaders in the community,"
said Jenny Leidner, president of
Kappa Alpha Theta. "It is our hope
that the greek community will be
unified supporters of our cause."
"Each chapter has its own indi
vidual personality, and so there's not
necessarily as much communication
as there could be between chapters,"
said Joey Greenwell, assistant direc
tor of student activities and fraterni
ty advisor.
"That's why (at the retreat] it was
important for communication to
stay constant. With most institutions
you'll find the dialogue is [the most]
crucial."
