WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (8-1) at
Fresno State (6-6), 7 p.m.

- The Bulldogs started off this past
weekend by defeating San Diego
State in five games, but then had
their four-game winning streak shat
tered by San Diego.
The Fresno team will look to its
star senior, outside hitter Anamie
Buckelew, to lead it against the Car
dinal. Buckelew's record includes an
impressive 200 kills thus far this sea
son.
The women's volleyball team at
Fresno returns seven of their letter
winners from their IWK team. Fres
no head coach Lindy Vivas, in her
ninth season heading the Bulldog
squad, will have to prepare for an ex
tremely psyched up Stanford team
coming off a big tournament win this
weekend. The Cardinal swept both
Utah and No. 10 Brigham Young at
home.
The Cardinal squad can only re
flect positively on last week's efforts
and has been preparing for a busy
upcoming week.
In order to let the team rest, head
coach Don Shaw used Sunday as a
day to catch up on work and sleep.
Monday consisted of a light practice
for the women's squad. This lower
intensity practice was designed to let
some of the team's injuries heal as
thoroughly as possible and to pre
vent fatigue.
Shaw noted that the lack of prac
tice time has forced the players to
prioritize what they should concen
trate on during their time together.
"Primarily we have been working
on timing on offense. We have had
quite a few injuries, which leads to

having to rotate players constantly."
Shaw said.
Lack of a steady string of healthy
players has made it increasingly diffi
cult for the offense to learn how to
work well off of each other.
The group of injured players in
cludes sophomore outside hitter
Michelle Chambers, currently out
with shoulder problems.
"With all the injured players, we
have been working a lot on team
consistency," Chambers said.
The majority of the players who
were injured are now back on the
floor or en route to recovery, making
the offensive strategies easier to plan
for and practice.
As Shaw said, "It is tough to play
a mid-week, non-conference game
and stay focused."
This is especially true of the Fres

no game, a matchup that entails a six
hour. round-trip bus ride on a school
night.
The Tuesday night game should
be a good test for the women's team
to see if it can go hard after little
downtime. Shaw plans for a light
workout on Wednesday to prevent
over-tiring his players before the
Thursday and Friday games versus
Oregon and Oregon State.
The Cardinal squad is now into its
second week of intense competitive
play and it plans to continue its win
ning streak. Hut amidst a tough
stretch of six matches in 12 days, the
women's team has to force itself to
remain focused.
The Fresno State game looks to
be a solid nonconference competi
tion for which the Stanford women's
volleyball crew is well prepared.
