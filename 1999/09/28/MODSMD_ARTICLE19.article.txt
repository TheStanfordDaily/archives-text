## Cardinal buries Spiders 8-1 
### Lori Maund 
A loss, it seems, is just what the
Cardinal needed to win, and to win
big.
The No. 23 Stanford women's soc
cer team (5-3) rallied from a 3-2 loss
on Friday to No. 18 University of Vir
ginia to beat No. 11 Richmond in a
deafening 8-1 victory on Sunday.
"We were fired up and we wanted
to get some respect back," senior co
captain Shauna Itri said.
By pounding the llth-ranked
team in the nation by a margin of
seven goals, the Cardinal proved that
it and the Pacific 10 Conference are a
force this season.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Friday: No. 17 Virginia (5-2) 3, No.
23 Stanford (5-3) 2.
■ Sunday: Stanford S. No. 11 Rich
mond (6-2-1) 1.

The win will prove significant later
in the season, as the NC A A considers
teams for at-large bids to its postsea
son tournament. The landslide victo
ry demonstrates the strength of the
Stanford team as well as the Pac-10,
potentially increasing the number of
teams admitted from the conference.
"It was kind of a West Coast-East
Coast thing," Itri said. "The East
Coast teams always seem to be
ranked higher and are given more
recognition. We wanted to show that
we can play with the best and beat the
best."
After a scoreless first half on Fri
day. the Cardinal took the lead early
in the second half. Freshman Marcia
Wallis collected the ball 40 yards out
and dribbled into the box, settling the
ball in the back of the net behind Cav
alier goalkeeper Megan Boehm.
"Marcia had a great game," se
nior co-captain Jenn O'Sullivan said.
"In fact, it was her best game all sea
son. She really pulled it together and
played well the entire game."
The Cardinal seemed to have the
game under wraps as senior Ronnie
Fair scored the second goal of the
evening. Fair capitalized off a Cava
lier foul when she bent a free kick to
the left side of the goal, giving the
Cardinal a 2-0 lead with 20 minutes
left.
And then it got ugly. Just 49 sec
onds after the second Cardinal goal,
Virginia senior Angela Hucles
crossed a ball off the kickoff into the

box and senior Jill Maxwell finished it
off, narrowing the Stanford lead to
just one goal. Seven minutes later.
Maxwell scored again, tying the
game.
"We let them get back into the
game," ltri said. "It wasn't that we
suddenly started playing bad. We just
got unlucky and made a few mistakes
defensively."
Stanford almost reclaimed the
lead in the 80th minute when fresh
man Kelsey Carlson hit a shot off the
crossbar and freshman Becky Myers
rebounded just wide. This proved to
be the last viable chance for the Car
dinal. It wasn't long before the Hu
cles put another goal away and closed
out the Cavalier victory.
"We learned a lesson," O'Sullivan
said. "With 20 minutes left in the
game, we were beating them on their
home field. We learned that you can't
get complacent. We have to score,
score early and score a lot."
The Cardinal did just that against
Richmond two nights later. Ranked
higher than Virginia, the Spiders
threatened to be more of a challenge
for the Cardinal.
"We were hungry and we learned
a lot from the loss," Itri said. "We
wanted to score big and we wanted to
win."
If scoring fast and definitively was
the Cardinal's goal for the game,
Stanford made it seem too easy. In
all, seven different players scored for

the Cardinal.
"It was a collective effort, not an
individual effort." O'Sullivan said.
"Everyone stepped up and con
tributed to the win."
Senior defender Christy Arnold
started off the scoring spree from six
yards out. nailing the ball off Fair's
corner kick. I ler goal was quickly fol
lowed by a pair from sophomore Erin
Maurer, as she came off the bench to
bury two back-to-back goals in a mat
ter of just three minutes. Before the
half closed, sophomore Whitney
Berry scored another goal off an as
sist from senior Casey Bernard.
"Erin Maurer and Whitney Berry
really stepped up and played well,"
O'Sullivan said. "They showed our
depth coming off the bench. This
depth is important and will help sus
tain us through the season."
The Cardinal offense continued to
dominate the Spiders in the second
half with goals by freshmen Kelsey
Carlson and Becky Myers (assist ju
nior Katherine Homey), junior
Martha West and Bernard (assist
West). The lone Richmond goal
came on a penalty kick with eight
minutes to go.
"This weekend showed us that we
can play with anybody and that we
can score goals," Itri said. "It gave us
more confidence, not only in the 8-1
victory, but our 2-0 lead against
I )VA. In both games, we dominated
teams in the top 20."
