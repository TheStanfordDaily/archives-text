# CIP to cost Chi Theta Chi $1.5 million

### Alice Brown Editorial staff 
In order to keep up with the Uni
versity's Capital Improvement Plan.
Chi Theta Chi will have to accumu
late more than $1 million over the
next few years to renovate its house.
Though other houses and dorms
on campus will undergo the same
renovations. Theta Chi is one of only
two campus dwellings that must fi
nance the construction itself.
It and the Sigma Chi fraternity
house are the only two on campus
not owned hv Stanford and are
called "private-title houses" by the
University.
"Renovation is both required
and needed to keep the house in
good shape." said Keith Guy, direc
tor of housing and dining services.
I le added that because the Universi
ty includes Theta Chi as a draw op

tion, "we have to make sure that it
does, at a minimum, meet the
codes."
Both Guy and Director of Stu
dent Housing Services Rodger
Whitney stressed that the fact that
the house must finance the CIP ren
ovations is not a new concept.
"Conversations with students
and alumni have been going on for
several years." Guy said. "They've
known for a long time that they were
going to have to do this."
The most immediate renovation
that Theta Chi will have to make is
ensuring that the house meets the
standards set by the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
According to Theta Chi's Capital
Improvement Manager, fourth-year
doctoral student Derek Lopez, this
project will occur this coming sum
mer.
Though Theta Chi has known

about this for at least four years, said
Director of Student Housing
Rodger Whitney, "a plan with dates
has never been formally submitted."
The administration plans to meet
with the Theta Chi house by the end
of October, and by this time they ex
pect the house to have both an im
mediate plan for renovation and a
longer-term plan that will carry over
the next several years.
Whitney said the administration
has tried to give them a more layered
schedule than other houses, allowing
them to "faze in the improvements."
Whitney noted that Sigma Chi is
well on its way to having the whole
house renovated. The fraternity uses
room rates to build up a monetary
reserve that, with proper budgeting,
can be used to finance such improve
ments. "At least that's the assump
tion," Whitney said.
He also noted that private-title
houses receive alumni support.
"[The house] will have to find a
way to fund the renovations." Guv
said.
Chi Theta Chi house managers
are aware of the situation and have a
solid plan to not only fund the im
provements but to renovate the en
tire house.
According to Lopez, the house
has a complete 10-year plan. Al
ready Theta Chi has spent $230,(XX)
on capital improvements, funded
through student housing payments.
Over the next decade, every two
years, residents will have saved
enough money to complete im
provements on various parts of the
