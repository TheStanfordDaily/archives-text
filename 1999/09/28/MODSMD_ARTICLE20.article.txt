# Water polo's Ellis is one of a kind
## 
### Erin Bouchier Contributing writer 
It's not every kid that announces
to his parents at age X that he would
like to play goalie lor the Stanford
men's water polo team when he
grows up. Not every kid. just Nick
Ellis.
A child with Cardinal dreams in
Santa Ana. Calif.. I His grew up to
star at one ol the top water polo
high schools in the country. Hut no
kid can imagine the pressure of re
placing college's best goalie and
starting at the sport's most intense
position for the No. I team in the
country.
However, here he is. calm and
enjoying water polo just like lie did
when lie was S.
Not only is lie having a good
time, lie's making quite a name for
himself.
I he rcdshirt freshman lias put
on an incredible performance this
season, averaging I I saves per
name and allowing only 5.7 points
pet game. All the while, lie is living
out his dream of starting in the goal
for Stanford.
I Mis got used to the water early
while growing up in Santa Ana.
"My mom wanted me to be able to
swim at the beach," lie said, "so she
started me 111 swim lessons around
age 4."
Bored with swimming bv 11.
Niek took up water polo at his
mom's suggestion, lie joined a
local age-group program with a
bunch ol friends who would stick
with him through high school and
now play in major college pro
grams.
Inspired by a goalie named
I any Burkett. Nick took to the
i»oal and hasn't left since.

As. a sophomore at water polo
powerhouse Foothill High School,
Ellis split time with Ryan Brown, a
mentor to Nick now at the Univer
sity of Pacific. That year Foothill
won the California Interscholastie
Federation championship.
Junior year, with Brown gradu
ated. Nick had the starting position
to himself and led his team back to
the ( IF finals. As a senior Ellis
earned OF Player of the Year hon
ors. again brought his team to the
( IF finals, and was considered the
nation's best high-school goalie.
That brought Nick to Stanford
in IWK where head coach Dante
Dettamanti decided to rcdshirt him
his freshman season. I le found that
having to sit out a season "was hard
since it meant not playing after hav
ing played for so long."
But rcdshirting gave him "time
to adjust to school" and a chance to
learn from senior All-American
Chris Aguilera, considered col
lege's best goalie last season.
I llis said he "learned so much
from Chris" and appreciated how
open Aguilera was to share what he
had picked lip in his years at Stan
ford.
Having improved a great deal
under Aguilera's tutelage. Nick
traveled to Australia last summer
with the United States Junior Na
tional I cam. reuniting with many
ol his friends from Foothill. Ellis
had a great time exploring Aus
tralia with his friends and gained
valuable international experience.
Me returned from Australia to
train with Stanford teammates for
the remainder of the summer. It
was a bit of an odd adjustment to
suddenly have no true summer, but
Nick enjoyed hanging out with the
guys.

"The team is awesome," Ellis
said. "It's a bunch of interesting
guys with really good attitudes.
We're all very compatible. It just
works really well."
Getting along with teammates
lias helped Nick adjust to his new
role as starting goalie. Moving into
the starting position was "super-in
timidating," he said. "Stanford has
always had great goalies. And it's
weird to think that you're expected
to be one."
Nick's teammates have down
played the expectations bv being

very supportive. "They are totally
understanding when goals go in."
But not many goals have gone
in. Despite the pressure of replac
ing an Ail-American in Aguilera.
Ellis has played well. Others out
side of Stanford have taken notice;
last week Nick garnered Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Player of
the Week honors.
He expects that the team's sea
son will be equally stellar. He
thinks the ('ardinal squad "has sur
passed many expectations already.
But we also have room for im

provement.
Nick expects that the team will
continue to improve, but he doesn't
look too far down the road. Rather,
he seems to subscribe to Dettaman
ti's philosophy of taking things one
game at a time.
And what happens when he's
played all the games of his college
career? Nick does not foresee ;i ca
reer in water polo. "Ideally I'd like
to find 10 good buddies from school
and do a start-up [company]."
He's already got a leg up on
competitors, having started a Web

design company with a friend from!
high school during his senior year.
Nick focuses on the business side of,
the company and his friend, "a CS"
demi-god." designs pages for cus
tomers in Southern California.

When lie's not working on the*
company or playing polo (or sleep
ing or hanging out), Nick likes to
play frisbee golf with his buddies*
from Faisan. his freshmen dorm. I
And maybe every once in a»
while he reflects on how he's living
out the dream he announced at age",

Sasha Mitelman — Dally*;
Redshirt freshman goalie Nick Ellis has faced the daunting task of stepping into the shoes of departed goalie Chris Aguilera, but Ellis has"
responded with brilliant play in the early season.
