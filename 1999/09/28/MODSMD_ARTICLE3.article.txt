### Anitha Reddy Staff writer 
In response to requests for more informa
tion mi eating disorders and depression. Resi
dential Education has extended programming
on these issues for resident assistants this year.
Counseling and Psychological Services will
run a l X)-minute evening meeting designed to
address the two health concerns on Oct. I 1 ) for
all RAs.
"We're doing this for the first time this year.
We wanted to see if there is a critical value for
RAs in having this training a month into the
year." said Dr. Alejandro Martinez. CAPS di
rector.
Although training sessions during the acad
emic year have not historically been as well-at
tended as those in the required RA training he
fore fall quarter. Associate Director of Resi

dential Education Ann Porteus emphasized the
special advantage of a later time slot.
"This training tends to come at a time when
people may have experienced some of these
things in their house; the issues become real,"
she said.
Res Ed Director Jane Camarillo said her of
fice may add sessions based on the challenges of
a particular year. "Every year, we evaluate RA
training and modify its sessions to add clarity or
depth." she said.
Porteus said the training session was partly
designed to take advantage of the close rela
tionship between residence staff and CAPS lia
sons, counseling professionals assigned to work
with one or two dormitories.
"In terms of crisis. [ RAs] would call our on
call system, but for anything else they're free to
call us. We're their first professional contact,"
said Naomi Brown. ('APS psychologist and lia

son to Florence Moore and Roble I lalls.
Brown said estimates of Stanford students
who engaged in disordered eating varied from
25 percent to 40 percent, but that confirming
such figures was hampered by underreporting.
Last year RAs completed all training on eat
ing disorders and depression during the re
quired sessions before fall quarter.
According to Angela Amarillas. student
project coordinator with Health Promotion
Services, information provided on eating disor
ders during the required sessions this year was
relatively general, because RAs would have a
more in-depth session during fall quarter.
"We covered eating disorders from the cul
tural perspective. We discussed the continuum
of disordered eating and just touched on how to
help a friend." said Amarillas. who led this
year's session on eating disorders with Cowell
nutritionist Vivian Crisman.

"For a few hours we discussed everything
from alcohol to when someone is at risk for an
eating disorder and the resources for helping
them," said Megan Mickley, an RAin Hob.
"Besides who's at risk and who's not, they
haven't given us any specific [intervention]
strategies at all."
Martinez said (AI'S used short hypothetical
stories involving students suffering from eating
disorders or depression in past training sessions,
but that such a method would not be used this
year.
"We would read a story to them about the
life of the student and then engage them in a
problem-solving exercise; how they would ad
dress it: what resources they would seek, when
would they seek them," Martinez said.
The Oct. I 1 ) session will have more didactic
content and specific information about these
two issues, he said.
