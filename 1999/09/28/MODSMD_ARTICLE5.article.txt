This year's class of President's Scholars is larger and
richer than in years past.
The Class of 2(H)3 includes 110 President's Scholars, an
increase from the Class of 2(H)2's 76 recipients. This year's
Scholars will receive $3.( X K) as a part of their new ly named
Intellectual Exploration Grant. $ 1.5(H) more than the
grants of the past Scholars.
Last year, the admissions department offered Presi
dent's Scholarships to 220 prospective freshman. 20 more
than in previous years.
In the future, the number of grants offered is expected
to fluctuate between 2(K) and 220 students, said I lolly
Knapp. the admission's office's assistant dean for special
projects and a member of the President's Scholars' Exec
utive Committee.
ITiis committee was created last year to facilitate a
partnership between the admissions office, which selects
the President's Scholars, and the Undergraduate Advis
ing Center and Department of Undergraduate Research
Opportunities, which began coordinating the Scholars at
Stanford programming.
It decided last year to change the grant s title from Re
search Grant to Intellectual Exploration Grant and to in
crease the grant amount. This decision was made in order
to make the scholarship more attractive to prospective

and committed Stanford students, committee memK i
said.
In general, students new to college may misinterprei
research to be laboratory research only, restricted to the
physical and natural sciences, and fail to recognize "the
breadth of the research, how it's done in the humanities
and the social sciences." said Nancy Anderson, an advis
ing consultant at the UAC and a member of the executive
committee.
Students are encouraged to use their grant money to
explore varied interests, regardless of whether those are
connected with their major and professional plans.
"We encourage a student who might be an engineer
ing major, but has an interest in Shakespeare, to use their
grant to study Shakespeare." said Knapp.
I he committee is also pursuing ways to make faculty
research and production more accessible to the Scholars.
"I will be talking with the Music Department in early
October to have some group of students perhaps be in
volved in a rehearsal, instead of just listening to a profes
sor speak about the department." Anderson said. "We
will probably do more activities at specific research sites,
such as going to see the Cantor Arts Center, the Martin
Luther King. Jr.. papers or Jasper Ridge."
By doubling the grant, "1 think that they made an im
portant change." said sophomore scholar Steve Comp-
ton, who praises the program for its
flexibility. " The $3,000 gives the
freshmen a lot more options."
The Intellectual Exploration
grant is not intended to and does not
foster a sense of academic elitism,
said Laura Selznick, executive com
mittee member and the Director of
Undergraduate Research Opportu
nities.
" The URO has money for every
body," Selznick said, "and the only
projects that we turn down are the
ones that don't lit the academic
guidelines."
Last year, Selznick said, the URO
gave away approximately $640,(KX)in

general student grants, of which the
Presidents' Scholars' insured grant
was only a fraction.
Although there is a URO lump
sum reserved for President's Schol
ars, they have to meet the same crite
ria facing their peers. Before receiv
ing approval, according to the Intel
lectual Exploration grant guidelines,
each project must have a faculty
sponsor, some kind of end-product, a
record of money spent and a conclud
ing summary of the projects' trials
and rewards.
"It's not like they just get a check
when they drive up Palm Drive,"
Selznick said.
The President's Scholars program
began five years ago as a three-year
pilot program, but has expanded to
become an important part of I Jniver

sitv programming.
After students have been admit
ted to Stanford, Knapp and Ryan
Tacorda, the assistant director of un
dergraduate admissions and the Pres
ident's Scholars' advising program
coordinator, select students who
"have demonstrated an interest in
and a commitment to using the Intel
lectual Exploration Grant" as a part
of their early Stanford career. Knapp
said.
All admitted students are consid
ered. both early and regular decision.
Although the original incentive for
the program may have been to lure
top students away from the competi
tion. Knapp emphasizes the Univer
sity's "commitment to the President's
Scholarship as an academic program
rather than just ;i yield initiative."
