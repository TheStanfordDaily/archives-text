## McCain announces presidential bid 
### 
NASHUA. N.H. (AP) — War hero
and senator, John McCain officially
opened his Republican presidential
campaign yesterday hv declaring him
self the best candidate to command U.S.
troops and reform a political system that
is "a spectacle of selfish ambition."
In an address that invoked the patri
otic spirits of his father and grandfather
— "I was born into America's service"
— McCain blended the outlines of a
presidential agenda with subtle digs at
President Bill Clinton, his Republican
presidential rivals and the GOP
Congress.
"It is because 1 owe America more
than she has ever owed me that I am a

candidate for president of the United
States," the Arizona senator and former
prisoner of war told a crowd of 500.
He pledged to protect Social Securi
ty. cut taxes, veto pork-barrel spending,
improve access to the Internet and test
the merits of spending government
money in private schools nationwide.
His signature issues — decreasing the
influence of money in politics and beef
ing up the U.S. military — are part of
what he called "a new patriotic chal
lenge" for the nation. Americans, he
said, must take up causes "greater than
self-interest."
McCain has been running for presi
dent since December 1998. The formal

announcement, originally scheduled for
the spring but delayed because of the
Kosovo conflict, was designed to bring
attention to his underdog hid.
A short time after McCain's
announcement, former Vice President
Dan Ouavle said he was abandoning his
bid for the White House.
A former Navy pilot shot down on
his 23rd mission over Vietnam in 1%7.
McCain started his day in the U.S. Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Md. A poor stu
dent and troublemaker, McCain barely
graduated from the academy, but later
distinguished himself during 5 1/2 years
in a Vietnam prisoner-of-war camp.
"I am the son and grandson of Navy

admirals, and I was born into America's
service," he said, reading from a
TelePrompTer in a dry but well
received speech. "It wasn't until I was
deprived of her company that I fell in
love with America."
His campaign team believes that
McCain's biography is his greatest asset
in a field of candidates with less com
pelling life stories. McCain made subtle
comparisons of his own. criticizing polit
ical rivals in both parties.
I le said Republicans and Democrats
alike in Congress waste money on
unneeded weapons systems while 12.000
military personnel "subsist on food
stamps."
