On Oct. 5, Stanford post office
officials plan to meet with the
Stanford Management Company
to iron out plans for scheduled
post office renovations.
Originally, the renovations
were scheduled to begin before
the start of the 1999-00 school
year.
"My understanding is that the
project is going forward, slightly
later than originally planned," said
Chris Christofferson, manager of
Facilities Operations.
For the nine to 10 months of
construction, the post office will be
relocated to Florence Moore Hall
field. A tent will house post office
boxes, while a trailer will serve as
the retail counter.
With the proposed enhance
ments, the post office hopes to ad
dress student complaints of long
lines and slow service.
At the Oct. 5 meeting, those in
charge hope to solidify project
dates and plans.

Batkin, manager of lands for the
Stanford Management Company.
The proposed new facility will
have post office boxes in a lighted,
interior lobby open 24 hours a day.
The revamped post office will fea

tional vending machines, a retail

service area for packing boxes and
supplies and a one-on-one service
counter.
Some students are enthused
about the possibility of improve
ment.
"I think that's a great idea," said
sophomore John Darcy. "I waited
in line for an hour once I don't
mind the inconvenience [during
construction)."
Some students are worried,
however, about the inconvenience

and question the project's worth.
"1 don't want this to interfere
with my final two quarters," senior
Ben Hinchliffe said.
Others reacted with surprise
when they heard about the Flo Mo
plan.
"That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard," said sopho

Sophomore Kcnji Arai said, "1
