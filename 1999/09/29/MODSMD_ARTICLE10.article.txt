Increased funding for
President's Scholars
of dubious value

This year, (he President's Scholars
program at Stanford had a
notable increase in size and fund
ing. Specifically, the freshman class of
President's Scholars increased from 76 to
110, and the Intellectual Exploration
Grant offered to each recipient was dou
bled, from $1,500 to $3,000.
These numbers reflect the Universi
ty's commitment to the success of this
program. It is especially gratifying to
know that the President's Scholars' Exec
utive Committee has placed a focus on
breadth of research, placing interest in
the humanities and social sciences as well
as the natural sciences and engineering.
However, the significant increase in
the Intellectual Exploration Grant is not
strongly justified, and the fairness of the
President's Scholars program in regards
to undergraduate education comes into
question.
The Intellectual Exploration Grant is
not an academic scholarship. It is a
research grant that involves an applica
tion process. And there are troubling dif
ferences between these grants, which are
extended by the Department of Under
graduate Research Opportunities, and
the URO grants available to third- or
fourth-year undergraduates.
First, there's the matter of money. The
President's Scholars can now spend up to
$3,000 on an Intellectual Exploration
project during their freshman and sopho
more years. The maximum amount that
an upperclassman can receive for a URO
Major (Jrant is $2,500. The likely result is
more expensive projects carried out by
students who have yet to cover the depth
of their studies.
Then there's the issue of commitment.
A junior or senior who applies for a
URO Major Grant must be enrolled in

an honors program, work for three quar
ters and produce a thesis. There is only
one opportunity to apply for a Major
(irant each school year; this year's dead
line is March 31, 2(XX).
President's Scholars have no mini
muni time or honors commitments, and
according to the Undergraduate Advis
ing Center Web site, acceptable results
may include "a report, concert, poster,
photo exhibit, dramatic presentation,
video, slide show, journal, dance, origi
nal fiction piece or Web site." Addition
ally, a President's Scholar can apply for
his or her grant during any quarter of
the year.
It is improper that IJRO should give
so much research flexibility to these pre
selected few, while upperclassmen must
face more restrictions, less money and
the possibility of a rejected grant propos
al.
The President's Award for Academic
Excellence in the Freshman Year is
another program coordinated in part by
URO, but the prize does not include a
research grant. Given the extreme diffi
culty of excelling academically during
one's first year at Stanford, it seems
almost ridiculous that these sophomores
are not awarded research money. Presi
dent's Scholars, on the other hand, are
selected according to their high school
qualifications (during the undergraduate
admissions process) and are given the
offer before they make the decision to
accept or reject Stanford.
Rather than increasing the funds
specifically for President's Scholars,
URO should spread the wealth and fos
ter research opportunities for all under
graduates. Why should the university
dangle money in front of high school
seniors when it has not yet taken ade
quate measures to enable all freshmen
and sophomores to participate in
research? The undergraduate experience
should be made as fulfilling as possible
for everyone, not just the ones who got
"the little PS letter" in the spring.
