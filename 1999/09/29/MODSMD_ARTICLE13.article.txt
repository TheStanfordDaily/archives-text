Cheering correctly
I am writing to address an issue which I
believe is pressing to the Stanford Com
munity: the sorry state of Stanford cheer
leading.
For the last two years, the football team
h;is not won many games. It appears that
now we have something for which to
cheer, but we've forgotten the right way to
do so.
Was it over when Rhode Island was
ahead by six points with less than a minute
left in the NCAA Regional Finals? So
what made many of the fans at Saturday's
game believe that it was all over when
UCLA was down 21-3 at halftime?
Cheering 'It's all over," "Warm up the
bus" or "Beat the traffic" is great if we're
up by three touchdowns with a minute left,
but it's usually unacceptable. Because, if
one believes in Sports Karma, cheers like
that tear the fabric of the universe, result
ing in the metaphysical event known to

religious scholars as a "jinx."
Realistically, such "bulletin-board" fod
der inspires teams to do unlikely things like
score 13 points in 57 seconds to reach the
Final Four, so don't motivate the other
team and hurt our own with inappropriate
cheers.
Similarly, don't make loud, disruptive
cheers when our team is on offense. Loud
cheering is intended to make the other
team unable to hear the snap count or
concentrate enough to read the defense,
so why would we want to hinder our own
offense to the same degree? That's not
much of a homeficld advantage.
The key to cheering is chanting the
appropriate slogan at the correct time.
"Scoreboard" is an ideal cheer to use when
our basketball team is up by 50 and a walk
on dunks against some fan that Mont
gomery has pulled out of the stands to play
defense for the last two minutes, but it is
just idiotic when our football team kicks a
field goal to go up 10-7 in the first quarter.

If you think all this is probably nonsense,
you're probably right. Still, you would do
well to eonsidcr what happened 17 years
ago when some band members decided
"It's all over" as Stanford led Cal 20-19 with
five seconds left. The rest, as John Belushi
might have told you, is history.

Support for half time show
It's about time someone did something
to show how bad it is that athletes park in
handicapped spaces. I did not attend Sat
urday's [football| game, but I saw your
halftime show on ESPN and applauded.
As a wheelchair-bound student who
attended college at Texas A&M Universi
ty, I saw the kind of abuse like that of the
UCLA football players all the time.
Nobody will do anything about it. because

"the football players are the school's pride
and joy."
My fiance attends the University of
Houston, and the football players there
park in our spaces all the time, even when
regular parking is just a few spaces away.
I would like just one day for these foot
ball players to see what it is like to need
those spaces for our ramps to go down and
not have them. They should be thankful
they have the muscles and strength they
have. More schools need to punish these
athletes who abuse these parking spaces.
In a way I have to feel sorry for them,
becuase they are the ones who arc truly
hanidcapped â€” in the brain that is.
Way to go Band!

Editor's Note: All UCLA players involved
in the parking-permit scandal were sus
pended for two games earlier this season.
