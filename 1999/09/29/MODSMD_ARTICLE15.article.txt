# Students 'animated' over new class
## 
### Aditya Pande 
Picture a course where 150 stu
dents show up on the first day, but
onl\ 15 can gel in. Students from
derailments as varied as physics,
art and computer science make up
the class. And they're all there to
learn about lunny walks.
What has caught the attention of
so many people? It's a new course
jointl\ offered by the Art and Com
puter Science Departments called
Animation. Cartoon Physics and
I unny Walks," taught by Lorie
I oc-b. an independent animator.
I lie course combines classical
methods of art and animation with
technology.
I he concept of "funny walks" is
also ,m important part of the equa
tion. according tit I ocb.
It you (can understand the mo
tion ol a| walk, you can understand
untiling in animation," l.oeh said.
It's a very important aspect, so I

wanted to highlight it. But. I also
want everyone to know that this
course is a lot of fun."
Loeb also emphasized that the
course is "traditional."
"We don't use the computer.
We're using traditional methods,
paper and pencil," said Loeb. "We
use computers to test the drawings.
I didn't want the students to get
stuck in technology.
"I really want them to just use
their imagination and just let go.
Later on, when they're using com
puter tools, they'll have these basic
principles which apply to every
thing."
Loeb said she wants her stu
dents to be "imaginative and cre
ative." She said she has always
stressed the need to understand the
underlying principles of the philos
ophy behind art and expression.
The course stands out among
other customary Computer Sci
ence offerings in that it's co-offered

by the Art Department.
Loeb called the class "a real fu
sion. 1 come from a traditional
background, but I've been doing a
lot of computer work. I've worked
with a number of different comput
er scientists developing computer
software and tools."
Loeb said her students are tak
ing the course for various reasons.
"There are all kinds of students in
the class studying motion for all
kinds of different reasons," she
said.
"Some are dealing with research
projects, some dealing with quali
fying motion, some trying to look at
it for physics reasons, some trying
to look at it for Human Machine
Interface reasons, some for robot
ics reasons and some for trying to
build robots," she said.
Loeb also emphasized that her
students "don't have to know how
to draw," because "they're study
ing movement, and getting a sense

of that. There's just a huge rela
tionship that goes on there."
Loeb has been overwhelmed by
the response generated by the
course.
"We didn't really advertise it.
The only way we told people was
through an e-mail to the Computer
Science students and some [Stan
ford University Digital Arts Cen
ter) students," she said.
Loeb said that her course's topic
is "a very hot topic right now."
"Personally, I think that per
haps five years ago, it might not
have been as popular," she said.
"But now people have had a
chance to work with computers,
and they see that there's something
in this, and they need this founda
tion."
With different forms of anima
tion software hitting the market
and prices of multimedia equip
ment falling by the day. is there a
threat to the "classical Disney"
style of animation, where the ani
mator sketches the drawings by
hand? Loeb feels it is a good thing
and is excited about it.
"It's great! The more the people
are doing it, the better," she said. "1
don't think the art form will disap
pear. I'm not too worried because
whether you do it on a computer or
by sketching, as long as you know
the principles and ideas, what tool
you use is immaterial.
"If your computer can help with
pieces of your work, that's great.
The more people are doing it.the
more they might get hooked. There
are always new things to be learned
in expression and motion. I think
it's just completely positive."
In addition to being a teacher.
Loeb is an animator and a film
maker.
"I'm just an independent anima
tion designer. I've been working in
a lot of different areas, and they all.
in a way, come together," she said.

always keep looking, observing
and have I().()()() bad drawings, but
get started. Keep experimenting,
using new software and new ways
of expression."
Loeb's long list of cartoon fa
vorites include the Russian car
toon. " Tale of Tales." a serious
film about World W;ir II and Rus
sia. as well as "Toy Story."
Loeb's works have been pre
sented at manv international lesti

\als such as the Melbourne Inter
national Film Festival, the New
York Film Festival, the Chitribani
I heatre in India and the Museum
of Modern Art in New York,
among others.
She studied at New York Uni
versity's Film Department and
graduated with a degree in Fine
Arts.
She has taught animation and
film production at NYU's Tisch
School of Fine Arts. The Rhode Is
land School of Design and at San
Francisco State University. Her re
cent film. "Rewind: It Could Have
Been Me," an animated film about
a homeless woman, won the Cine
