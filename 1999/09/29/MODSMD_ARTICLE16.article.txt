Prof. Janet Halley began research
ing the 1993 implementation of the
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy for
gays in the military, planning to
compose a "little thirty-page
paper" on the issue.
Little did she know then that the
issue was "much harder to figure
out than it initially seemed," as she
now says.
In fact, what Halley ended up
producing was a 176-page book,
"Don't: A Reader's Guide to the
Military's Anti-Gay Policy," re
leased bv Duke University Press in
March.

'The [1993] policy... is
much more uncertain,
creates more paranoia
and is more unfair.'
â€” Prof. Janet Halley

Halley, who is currently spend
ing a semester as a visiting profes
sor at Harvard Law School, said
that her book holds all three
branches of the federal govern
ment responsible for executing a
policy that is "irrational, mean
spirited and un-lawlike."
At the center of her argument is
the failure of the policy's attempt
ed distinction between homosexu
al conduct and homosexual status.
"The policy is supposed to be an
improvement over the former pol
icy .. . because it discharges service
members not for who they are but
for what they do,"" Halley said.
However, Halley said her re
search revealed that "every effort
that President [Bill] Clinton made

to introduce conduct-based rules
Congress rejected and put specifi
cally anti-gay, status-based rules in
their place."
Halley also places much of the
blame on the Clinton administra
tion for instituting rules that re
quired discharge proceedings to
begin against any service member
who has "manifested a propensity"
to engage in homosexual inter
course.
"Because so many things people
do can be thought to 'manifest a
propensity,' the [1993) policy
sweeps much more broadly, is
much more uncertain, creates
more paranoia, and is more un
fair." than the previous rules, Hal
ley said.
For example, in a separate inter
view with The Stanford Report.
Halley related a case in which a
woman in the armed forces re
buffed the sexual advances of a
man in the service, leading the man
to believe she was a lesbian.
According to Halley, this
woman was put through the dis
charge process for no other reason
than the fact that another individ
ual had drawn his own conclusion
that she was gay.
In other words, according to the
policy, the woman had "manifest
ed a propensity" toward homosex
uality and was therefore subject to
discharge procedures.
Halley conducted the majority
of her research on campus at the
Crown Law Library, compiling an
extensive variety of resources and
documents during her effort.
In addition to examining the
text of the policy itself, Halley
"also got secret Department of De
fense and Department of Justice
