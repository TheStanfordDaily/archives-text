## 100,000-year-old ulcer-causing bug near eradication 
### David Lin Contributing writer 
You've just finished the last of three
papers due tomorrow, and you're exhausted
alter two all-nighters. You haven't eaten
hot food in a week, and it's taken five cups
of eotfee and a dose of Vivarin to wake you
up this morning. But as you pour another
cup of eale latte, that bellyache you have
suddenly aches more sharply. Ulcer, per
haps.' 100 much stress, you grumble, as
visions of spring break in Cancun dance in
your head.
Until recently, ulcers were viewed as a
disease ol civilization, an unfortunate
byproduct of the pressures of 20th-century
society. I lowevcr. the discovery of a bacte
ria that burrow into the stomach lining caus
ing ulcers has revolutionized modern treat
ments for this disease.
Helicobacter pylori, the bug responsible
for ulcers, may have more to offer humani
ty than bellyaches. A paper co-authored by
Associate Professor of Medicine Julie Par
sonnet raises the possibility that these bac
teria and the ulcers they cause may soon
become a thing of the past — and that with
in their genetic code lie clues to the history
of human migration and evolution.
The story of H. pylori is enough to puff
up any scientist's chest with pride. For
decades conventional wisdom held sway
with doctors, who believed that stress was
the main culprit in causing ulcers. Chronic
stress, it was thought, reduces blood flow to
the stomach, making it more difficult to pro
duce the inner mucus lining that protects it
from its own acid and protein-digesting
enzymes. Eventually, some part of the
stomach begins to erode under the attack of
acid and enzymes. Voila, an ulcer forms.
Two Australian physicians, Barry Mar
shall and Robin Warren, didn't buy this the
ory. In 19K2 they discovered H. pylori pre
sent in tissue around a stomach ulcer. Since
then, studies have demonstrated a strong
link between the presence of this bacteria in
the stomach and the onset of ulcers.
More ominously, H. pylori has also been
linked to gastric cancer, a disease projected
to be the eighth-greatest cause of death
worldwide by 2010. H. pylori's effects, it
seems, may require much more attention

than a dose of Maalox.
Scientists are also beginning to unravel
the way in which H. pylori survives in the
hostile environment of the stomach. Its
corkscrew structure allows it to burrow into
the mucus layer of the stomach, using that
as protection against stomach acid and
enzymes.
In addition, H. pylori also produces an
enzyme that converts urea, a chemical
prevalent in the stomach, into bicarbonate
and ammonia. As you might remember
from high school chemistry, these com
pounds neutralize acids, further protecting
H. pylori from harm.
H. pylori's most damaging effect, howev
er. lies in the other compounds it exudes,
and this is where the bellyache comes in.
One compound released by the bacteria
actually damages cells in the stomach lining,
leading to tissue erosion; which in turn leads
to an ulcer. Ironically, the problem is com
pounded when the immune system rushes
to the rescue. The inflammation around the
tissue only worsens the damage, while the
bacteria escape harm.
Still, basic questions about the nature of
H. pylori remain unanswered. One answer
which Parsonnet's paper may provide is
when this bug first began its association with
mankind's stomachs. Parsonnet's team
reports that the genetic distribution of vari
ous strains of bacteria worldwide mirror
human genetic distributions. Studies of H.
pylori worldwide indicate at least four dif
ferent strains — one among those of Euro
pean descent in Europe and North Ameri
ca, two in North and South Asia, and one in
New Zealand among aborigines.
This simple genetic analysis, along with
the knowledge that bacteria mutate at a
known rate over time, makes it possible to
calculate how long bacteria have been
removed from their source. And the finding
is surprising. H. pylori may have been
infecting humanity for over 100.000 years.
In other words, the bacteria has traced
mankind's footsteps through its own evolu
tion, first entering humanity's bellies in
Africa and being carried along by migrants
who colonized Asia and Europe.
As Parsonnet said. "Bacteria and viral
agents serve as markers of human migra
tion."

This startling conclusion also raises the
whimsical possibility that ancient hominids
far removed from the modern rat race may
have suffered from ulcers anyway. Fellow
ulcer-sufferers, take heart.
Further proof of a long cohabitation with
U. pylori may simply be its unique ability to
survive in one of the most hostile environ
ments for life anywhere. No other bacteria
arc known to live in the human stomach,
and H. pylori's burrowing and acid-neutral
izing activities could only have been devel
oped after millenia of braving humanity's
stomachs.
Despite man's long history with 11.
pylori, attempts are underway to bring that
association to an end. Work is currently
being conducted to develop a vaccine for
the bacteria, as scientists hope to stimulate
an immune response strong enough to drive
off the invaders.
But while a vaccine lias been successful
ly tested with mice, a human vaccine may be
a long time coming. One preliminary
human trial of a vaccine failed to reduce the
number of H. pylori in subjects tested.
Despite this failure, further tests on humans
are planned.
Economic factors also stand in the way
of vaccine development. Parsonnet, an epi
demiologist who specializes in the behavior
of H. pylori in human populations, has
found that infection rates in the United
States are falling spontaneously.
Parsonnet noted that the bacteria is now
increasingly difficult to find in large parts of
the U.S. population. "It we start vaccinating
[against H. pylori | 10 years from now, it may
be useful. If we start 20 years from now, it
may not be important anymore." she said.
If the lucrative U.S. pharmaceutical mar
ket has no need for such a vaccine, pharma
ceutical companies would be much less will
ing to spend the millions of dollars neces
sary to develop one.
But even in developing countries, said
Parsonnet, where H. pylori infection rates
continue to remain high, there are higher
priorities than a vaccine. "Countries may
not want a vaccine for H. pylori while they
still have people dying of malaria and HIV,"
she said.
Whether the vaccine arrives or not, how
ever. ultimately may not matter. Standard

antibiotic treatments have been successful
for treatment of individuals infected, even
those who have already developed ulcers.
In addition, increased santitation and
safer water supplies may be responsible for
the dramatic fall in U.S. infection rates,
meaning that simple solutions such as pro

\iding clean drinking water and safer
sewage disposal mav have a similar effect in
developing countries. Another incentive,
perhaps, to achieving these simple goals
around the world. And. perhaps, guarantee
ing that you come back from spring break in
C'ancun 11 pylori- and ulcer-free.

The bacteria H. pylori burrows itself into the mucus lining of the stomach and
secrets a compound that erodes the cells of the stomach lining, leading to an ulcer.
