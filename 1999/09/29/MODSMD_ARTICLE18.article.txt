# Space-tech used in new fetal surgery

It seems to be the most invasive
surgery of all: the fetal operation,
gingerly performed in the hopes
that a baby might live. But as the
womb exists in a delicate balance,
disruption of this balance, even with
the best intentions, can lead to a
premature delivery. Now, the physi
cian who pioneered fetal surgery
has collaborated with NASA elec
trical engineers to ensure that
babies given a second chance at life
through surgery come into the
world at the right times.
Working with Dr. Michael Har
rison, chief pediatric surgeon at
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,
NASA's Robert Kicks and Carsten
Mundt have developed a slender
transmitter capable of relaying key
information about the fetus. After
an operation to correct a severe
birth defect, for example, the young
patient's progress can be moni
tored.
The sleek sensor was a mere idea
just five years ago. Harrison's preg
nant patients were experiencing
premature labor. In standard fetal
surgery, a Caesarian section is per
formed to partially remove the fetus
for surgical procedures. The rein
troduction of these fetuses into the
womb was causing mothers'
autoimmune functions to expel the
now-foreign object.
Harrison could have solved the
problem with medication that halts
early labor. However, the onset of
labor is unpredictable. The contrac
tions of "false labor" are familiar to
many mothers. Conversely, early
labor pains arc sometimes dis
missed as cramping.
Harrison attempted to utilize a
thumb-sized sensor device meant
for lab animals to detcct contrac
tions in women. However, not only

was the flood of data incomprehen
sible, but the machine necessary to
generate it was large and bulky.
Seeking a parallel solution to the
premature-labor problem, 1 larrison
was also designing less invasive
"telesurgery" for fetuses, avoiding
Caesarian sections altogether with
the use of an endoscopic tube.
The tube can be thought of as an
"eye" into the human body. Harri
son adapted the use of endoscopic
tubes as video cameras and surgical
instrument guides to fetuses.
He approached NASA for a
method to elucidate the meanings
of the sensor readings. But they
took on an even larger project; the
engineers, working at Ames
Research Center in Mountain
View, built a monitor that could be
inserted through the same tube.
The engineers' product was sim
ilar to a model used to monitor
John Glenn during his recent return
to space. They applied the same
principles to the womb as to outer
space — the smaller the clutter of
tubes, the better.
Once the circuit and batteries
were engineered to be resilient yet
sensitive, Mundt wrote software to
translate the cacophony of signals
into useful information about a
fetus' condition.
ITie new device, smaller than a
human pinky, is designed to hold up
to the unforgiving environment of a
womb, and may eventually be able
to dispense such specific informa
tion as fetal heart rate and amniotic
fluid acidity. The slightest change in
pressure or temperature registers
on the new transmitter, which con
veys data to a hand-held receiver
currently in development.
Harrison, Mundt and Ricks
expect that this eagerly awaited
technology will be government
approved for human mothers with
in two years.
