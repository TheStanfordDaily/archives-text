# The
						illusion of faster moving lanes
## 
### Jane Morril Contributing writer 
As many drivers have experi
enced during slow-moving traffic,
cars in adjacent lanes always seem to
be moving faster than they are. In
fact, a new study conducted by a
Stanford professor calls this experi
ence an optical illusion.
Statistics Professor Robert Tib
shirani and his colleague from the
University of Toronto, Donald
Redelmeier, conducted a series of
tests that suggest that people per
ceive vehicles in other lanes to be
moving faster, when in fact they are
travelling at the same or even slow
er speeds.
Tibshirani became involved in
the research with Redelmeier, who
had the idea for the research based
on his interest in how people make
decisions.
Tibshirani and his colleague
argue that this illusion occurs
because more time is usually spent
being passed, or overtaken, by other
vehicles than is spent passing them.
When traffic does move faster, it
spreads out and when it moves slow
er it packs together. Hence, a driver
can overtake many vehicles in a
brief period of time, but it wi'l take
considerably longer for these same
vehicles to pass the driver. Also,
when a driver passes another vehi
cle. it remains behind him and is
quickly forgotten.
In the report of their research,
published in the journal "Nature,"
Tibshirani and Redelmeier argue
that other aspects of perception may
contribute to the illusion that the
next lane is moving faster.

"A driver is more likely to glance
at the next lane for comparison
when he is relatively idle. Even if
attention was not focused in particu
lar directions and was evenly spaced
in time, human psychology may
make being overtaken seem more
salient than the corresponding gains.
Furthermore, misconceptions about
randomness can make runs of over
taking and being overtaken seem
unduly prolonged."
Therefore, when a driver is
passed, he can see the vehicle the
entire time it is passing him and
while he is behind it. leading to frus
tration and the illusion that the
other lane is moving faster.
In their study, Tibshirani and
Redelmeier created two lanes of

traffic using computer simulations.
I'he lanes were identical except that
their congestion varied according to
random gaps. Vehicles accelerated if
there was no other motorist within a
minimum headway distance, depen
dent on I he velocities of the ears.
(Mhcrwisc. they decelerated.
I hey then examined and statisti
cally evaluated the movements of
each driver as it compared to the
others in the next lane. In addition
to the computer simulations, they
videotaped traffic sequences using a
mounted camera in a moving vehi
cle. This camera filmed the side
view perspective of the adjacent
congested lane. A section of this
video, which recorded a slightly
slower average speed in the next

Innc. was screened to driving stu
dents. Seventy percent of the stu
dents stated that the next lane was
moving faster, and 65 percent said
they would switch lanes given the
chance.
I he findings could have impot
taut implications for road safetv.
About four percent of road acci
dents are caused during lane
changes. If drivers realize the
appearance that other lanes are
moving faster is only an illusion,
they may he less likely to switch
lanes.
"Lane changes are often danger
ous. and mav not gel you to youi
destination any faster. Think twice
before changing lanes." said I ibslii
rani.
