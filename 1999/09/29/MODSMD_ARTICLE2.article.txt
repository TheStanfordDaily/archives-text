### T.J. Babbitt Editorial staff 
Law Professor Tom Campbell, a
Republican Congressman who rep
resents California's 15th District, is
reportedly considering a run for the
United States Senate next year, a
move which would almost certainly
endanger his tenured professorship
Roll Call reported Monday that
Law School Dean Kathleen Sullivan
wrote a letter to Campbell saying that
Stanford would rescind his tenured
professorship unless he returned to
Stanford full-time bv January 2(X)1.

In her own statement, Sullivan im
plied that things might not be so

clear-cut. saying.
"We are involved
in ongoing discus
sions about how he
might possibly in
tegrate his future
political and acad
emic careers."
Campbell had
no comment.

The possibility of Campbell run
ning has Republican strategists si
multaneously excited about putting
up a potentially strong challenge to
incumbent U.S. Sen. Dianne Fein

stein and worried about the possibili
ty of losing his 1 louse seat to a De
mocrat.
Campbell won his congressional
seat in a special election in 1995, and
has managed to hold onto his Stan
ford affiliation since that time. ( amp
bell began teaching antitrust law at
Stanford in 1983 and received tenure
from the I Jniversitv in 19K7.
Campbell may be up for a tough
House sent next
year. I le is widely considered a Re
publican moderate — he is pro
choice and pro-gun control, which is
regarded as matching Silicon Vallcx
dispositions — but his decision to

vote for President C 'lintorfs impeach
ment last year angered some con
stituents. and his seat is historically
compctetivc for Republicans.
Hie race for Feinstein's Senate
seat would also be a tough fight. Fe
instein is broadK popular statewide
and considered to be a formidable
candidate, according to Silicon Val
ley executive Ron l'n/.
Campbell does have the advan
tage of statewide fundraifcing contacts
and name recognition because he has
competed for the Republican Senate
nomination before, in 1992. That
time, he lost the primary by two per
centage points.
