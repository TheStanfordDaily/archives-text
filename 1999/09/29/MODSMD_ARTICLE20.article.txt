# Hoover promotes vouchers

### Lihi Rosenthal 
A Hoover Institution commit
tee on K-12 education reform
kicked off a five-year program to
promote incentive programs for
teachers and schools, a national
voucher system, home schooling,
charter schools and higher stan
dards for teachers at its inaugural
meeting on Sept. 15.
The 12-mcmber committee
plans to write a book 011 education
al reform, the first stage of iheir
five-year project.
At the meeting, committee
members introduced their ideas to
educators, activists and policy
makers concerned with wide
spread changes both within and
outside of the current system.
The Hoover Institution enlisted
the aid of the Koret Foundation, a
San Francisco-based grant organi
zation with interests in fostering
American education. Together,
the two organizations formed the
group and made plans to alert pol
icy makers about education re
form.
"We hope to heighten aware
ness and educate policy makers
about reform alternatives and
change needed within the system,"
said Hoover Assoc. Director
Richard Sousa.
Despite positive feedback from

the committee and its supporters,
controversy remains surrounding
the Institution's plans.
While Sousa said the commit
tee's suggestions offer promising
alternatives to the ailing educa
tional system, others, such as Edu
cation Secretary Richard Riley,
doubt the success of programs such
as school vouchers.
"There's the belief that all you
have to do to fix public schools is to
leave them behind and subsidize
private education instead, that
there is some kind of parallel uni
verse of superior private schools
ready to take on the job of educat
ing 4b million public school stu
dents," Riley said to the Associat
ed Press in response to the imple
mentation of a school voucher sys
tem in Florida.
"Well. I'm here to tell you that
there is 110 such parallel universe.
The only way to fix the public
schools is to fix the public schools,
not to abandon them," he said.
Other opponents to incentive
programs and school vouchers in
clude the NAACP and the Califor
nia's teachers' union, both of which
charge that voucher programs vio
late the law by crossing the lines of
separation between church and
state.
There has also been bipartisan
division over the issue of school

vouchers.
"Republicans are the ones who
are ideologically most on board
and eager to support vouchers, but
they have constituents who are not
supportive," said Political Science
Prof, and Hoover Senior Fellow
Terry Moe in a press release.
"The Democrats have con
stituents who want school choice,
especially low-income minority
parents in the inner city, but be
cause of the unions, the Democrats
will not do that," he said.
Members of the task force, how
ever, see alternatives to the current
system as a promising first step to
ward supplementing current short
comings within the educational
system.
"Our plans are aimed at grades
K-12. and we hope to prepare stu
dents for higher education," Sousa
said. "We hope to create qualified
cohorts for higher education."
The formation of the committee
is one of the first attempts by the
Institution to join forces with other
conservative policy institutions.
The committee plans on meet
ing again early next year. In the
meantime, the members' focus re
mains on penning a book on educa
tional reform with hopes to issue
reports, post information on the In
ternet and publish papers in high
profile periodicals.
