### Valentine Ding Contributing writer 
The History Department re
cently received a $5,000 award to
help expand job opportunities for
its doctoral graduates with Silicon
Valley businesses and non-profit
corporations.
The Woodrow Wilson Innova
tion Award, which is in its pilot
year, is part of a larger program
called "The Humanities at Work."
created by the Woodrow Wilson
National Fellowship Foundation,
based in Princeton. N.J. According
to the foundation's news release,
the program "seeks to broaden the
career opportunities of humanities
Ph.D.s."
Stanford's History Department
was one of seven winners. Other
winners included the UC-Santa
Barbara History Department and
Graduate Program in Public I listo
ry, the Georgetown University De
partment of Linguistics and the
University of Massachusetts at
Amherst English Department and
Graduate Program.
The foundation gave three
$10,000 awards and four $5,000

awards.
"When we first heard the foun
dation was asking for applications,
we immediately thought about
Stanford's unique location," said
History Department Chair Car
olyn Lougee Chappell. "We sit in
the middle of the Silicon Valley —
there's a whole lot of exciting op
portunities for our Ph.D. gradu
ates."
The department handed in a
proposal to the foundation in
April.
The department pledged to use
the funding "to establish ties with
Silicon Valley high-tech compa
nies, publishing and consulting
firms and nonprofit organizations
with the goal of'providingstudents
with graduate support, summer
work and internships and perma
nent jobs." according to The Stan
ford Report.
Traditionally, history doctoral
graduates stay in academia, teach
ing and research.
During the last 30 years, howev
er. the number of job openings for
professors have been shrinking,
Lougee Chappell said. According
ly, more history graduates have

been landing jobs outside of uni
versities.
"Now. students could work as
archivists, public historians; they
could also work for museums, non
profit organizations and so on,"
said Lougee Chappell.
"We look at those computer
technology-related companies, and
it struck us that they are moving so
fast few people have thought about
keeping the company history," she
said. "Our students know how to
document archives and write histo
ries. So there should be a lot of mu
tual benefits."
The award will be used to hire
staff to match history doctoral stu
dents and alumni with companies.
The companies will pay both the
students who work for them and
the department.
With the funding from high-tech
companies, the department could
further encourage students to try
jobs at non-profit organizations,
Lougee Chappell said.
"It's a great idea. I think," said
history graduate student Steve
Yoda. "It helps us to see the real
world. The department is offering
us wonderful opportunities."
