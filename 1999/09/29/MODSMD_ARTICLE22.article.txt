## From the cheap seats Lone-star love 
### 
In Texas folks do things big. Big
Hair. Big Trucks. Heck, here at
Stanford we even have a Texas
club. There's no Rhode Island
club, is there?
As many of you probably
know already, nothing is bigger in
the Lone Star state than football.
We've all seen Varsity Blues.
Even people from as far away as
New England, where sports such
as hockey and lacrosse reign
supreme, know that in Texas,
football is life.

So at the end of high school,
when it came time to choose col
leges, there were some tough de
cisions to make. For me, it was all
about social life, location and aca
demics. For many of my friends, it
was a question of whether Texas
A&M was shifting to the 1-forma
tion or if Texas Tech could fill the
void left by a departing strong
safety.
While this is a bit of an exag
geration, it's tough to really de
scribe to all the non-Texans just
how big football is.
Parents holding kids back a
grade in junior high school so that
they will be bigger and stronger
for high school football? Seen
that happen. High schools build
ing multi-million dollar stadiums
with artifical turf that seem big
enough to be visible from space?
Yup.
The high school I went to
freshman and sophomore year is
now No. 1 in the country in the
USA Today rankings. Las Vegas
oddsmakers have them at 7-1 to
win the Super Bowl, right below
Green Bay and just ahead of the
49ers.

Coming to Stanford, I caught a
lot of flack from my friends at the
"football powerhouses". Never
mind the fact that Stanford was
coming off a 38-0 drubbing of
Michigan State in the Sun Bowl
and featured one of the best of
fenses in the country.
So when Stanford started off
4-1 in 1997 and cracked the top
25, 1 had reason to smile. My
gloating was short-lived, howev
er, as we proceded to drop five
straight games before recovering
to capture Big Game. I was rele
gated to rooting for UCLA to
beat Texas A&M in the Cotton
Bowl.
The worst thing about football
is, in the minds of Texans, no
other sports really compare.
Whenever I'm home I have the
same argument with one of my
best friends who's just as big a
sports fan as I am.
In discussing the high points of
Stanford sports, I point out the
five straight Sear's Directors
Cups, the multitude of national ti
tles in the 1990s and the sheer
dominance in sports such as
swimming, tennis and volleyball.
He merely retorts with, "How did
your football team do this year?"
All of our national titles could
have been in mixed doubles tid
dlywinks and synchronized floor
sweeping for all he cares.
Going to the Final Four in bas
ketball in '98 helped out slightly
as Stanford broke into the pan
theon of the "glamorous" college
sports, but any glory was short
lived as the football squad went 3-
8 the next season.
This year got off to a markedly
dismal start as Stanford travelled
