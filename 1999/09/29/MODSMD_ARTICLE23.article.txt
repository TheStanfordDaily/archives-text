# Howard shoulders a huge load
## Los Altos native leads the Cardinal defense on field and off 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
Willie Howard has some big
shoulders.
That makes sense, given the size
of the man. According to official
statistics published by the football
team, the senior defensive end is six
foot, four inches tall and 290
pounds. Some say he's closer to 295.
But it's his shoulders you should
notice first. It's a good thing those
shoulders are big, because they
have had to carry some heavy loads
over the years.

"I was part of a winning
team that day for the first
time. It was an amazing
feeling."
— Willie Howard

"I have been a natural leader
since high school," Howard said. "I
have always felt that I need to carry
myself as an example to my family,
friends and teammates."
Howard sometimes talks as if
he's got the whole world up there
on those imposing shoulder blades.
The most important responsibil
ity to him is his family. In fact,
Howard ended up at Stanford
mostly because of his devotion and
responsibility to them.
Howard also had options to play
on the East Coast and at UCLA,
but once the envelope came from-
Stanford he knew that he wanted to
wear the Cardinal colors.
"I did have a lot of options," he
said about his college choice. "But
my family lives in Los Altos, and
they are the most important thing in
my life. I like being at Stanford be
cause my family and friends can see
me play."
Talking to him, it is easy to see

this devotion. Even more visible is
their devotion to him. Against
Washington State, Howard's moth
er, Debbie, made shirts for the
close-to-50 members of the unoffi
cial "Willie Howard Fan Club."
Emblazoned with Howard's name
and a large red 77, Howard could
see his fans all over the stadium.
Howard grew up in Los Altos
and started playing football after
his mother suggested that the high
school freshman use his then-250-
pound body for sporting success.
"1 was already 250 pounds fresh
man year of high school," Howard
said, "but it wasn't uncomfortable.
It was fun. My brother was also big,
so we had a good time."
At that size, Howard was easily
the biggest freshman at Los Altos
High School, and he was put into
the lineup at fullback and defensive
tackle. Although he preferred
being on the offensive side of the
ball, Howard began to concentrate
on defense when he realized that he
could ride that position further,
possibly to college.
"1 liked the offensive mindset
better at the beginning," he said,
"but eventually 1 got to like the de
fensive side. On defense, you are
constantly attacking to make sure
the other team goes nowhere."
As an integral part of a high
school team that had only 17 play
ers, Howard learned to give 1(K)
percent of his effort to the team.
"If you don't give all you've
got," he said, "then the team only
has 16 players. And then they're
even worse off."
Over the course of Howard's
high school career, the understaffed
and overmatched Eagles won only
three games in four years.
"Winning three games in high
school is not a very good record by
any means," Howard said, "but it
was an experience that most guys

on this (Stanford] team can't relate
to. When there are only J7 guys on
the team it makes it hard to win
games. The guys had dedication.
They may not have been the best
athletes, but they had pride."

Willie Howard has come a long way from his high school squad that
won only three games in four years to a leader of the rejuventated
Stanford defense.
sive players in the country.
But for Howard, individual suc
cess was never an important part of
football. Winning as a team, and
being a leader on that team, is.
"My best moment in college
football had to be my redshirt
freshman year, when we beat San
Jose State,"he said. "I was part of
the winning team that day for the
first time. It was an amazing feel
ing."
If this year's team keeps winning
— and Howard continues to be a
vital part of the Cardinal defense —
a place in the NFL might be in his
future. Since he redshirted his
freshman year. Howard has the rest
of this season and next season to
impress pro scouts.
So far this year, Howard is on
pace to turn quite a few heads and

punish a number of opponents.
Against Washington State,
Howard caused a tumble in the
opening moments of the game. Se
nior Rial! Johnson recovered the
ball for the Cardinal, and a few
plays later, senior quarterback
Todd Husak dove into the end zone
for the Cardinal's first touchdown
of the game. The Cardinal went on
to rout the Cougars 54-17.
Hut even if his football dreams
don't pan out, Howard will have a
plan. A communications major, he
hopes to pursue a career in broad
cast journalism.
"I enjoy seeing and communi
cating with people, and it can be
something that I keep doing." he
said. "I'm not shy in front of a cam
era. so I think it's a skill 1 have."
Whether Howard finds success
on the field or in front of the cam
era. the unofficial fan club, with
Debbie at the helm, will always be
with him.
