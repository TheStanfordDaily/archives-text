# Howard shoulders a huge load
## Los Altos native leads the Cardinal defense on field and off

Willie Howard has some big
shoulders.
That makes sense, given the size
of the man. According to official
statistics published by the football
team, the senior defensive end is six
foot, four inches tall and 290
pounds. Some say he's closer to 295.
But it's his shoulders you should
notice first. It's a good thing those
shoulders are big, because they
have had to carry some heavy loads
over the years.

"I was part of a winning
team that day for the first
time. It was an amazing
feeling."
â€” Willie Howard

"I have been a natural leader
since high school," Howard said. "I
have always felt that I need to carry
myself as an example to my family,
friends and teammates."
Howard sometimes talks as if
he's got the whole world up there
on those imposing shoulder blades.
The most important responsibil
ity to him is his family. In fact,
Howard ended up at Stanford
mostly because of his devotion and
responsibility to them.
Howard also had options to play
on the East Coast and at UCLA,
but once the envelope came from-
Stanford he knew that he wanted to
wear the Cardinal colors.
"I did have a lot of options," he
said about his college choice. "But
my family lives in Los Altos, and
they are the most important thing in
my life. I like being at Stanford be
cause my family and friends can see
me play."
Talking to him, it is easy to see

this devotion. Even more visible is
their devotion to him. Against
Washington State, Howard's moth
er, Debbie, made shirts for the
close-to-50 members of the unoffi
cial "Willie Howard Fan Club."
Emblazoned with Howard's name
and a large red 77, Howard could
see his fans all over the stadium.
Howard grew up in Los Altos
and started playing football after
his mother suggested that the high
school freshman use his then-250-
pound body for sporting success.
"1 was already 250 pounds fresh
man year of high school," Howard
said, "but it wasn't uncomfortable.
It was fun. My brother was also big,
so we had a good time."
At that size, Howard was easily
the biggest freshman at Los Altos
High School, and he was put into
the lineup at fullback and defensive
tackle. Although he preferred
being on the offensive side of the
ball, Howard began to concentrate
on defense when he realized that he
could ride that position further,
possibly to college.
"1 liked the offensive mindset
better at the beginning," he said,
"but eventually 1 got to like the de
fensive side. On defense, you are
constantly attacking to make sure
the other team goes nowhere."
As an integral part of a high
school team that had only 17 play
ers, Howard learned to give 1(K)
percent of his effort to the team.
"If you don't give all you've
got," he said, "then the team only
has 16 players. And then they're
even worse off."
Over the course of Howard's
high school career, the understaffed
and overmatched Eagles won only
three games in four years.
"Winning three games in high
school is not a very good record by
any means," Howard said, "but it
was an experience that most guys

on this (Stanford] team can't relate
to. When there are only J7 guys on
the team it makes it hard to win
games. The guys had dedication.
They may not have been the best
athletes, but they had pride."
Despite the underwhelming sue

cess of his team. 1 loward's individ
ual performance won him the atten
tion of college recruiters. By the
time his senior season was over, he
was rated among the top 20 defen

Willie Howard has come a long way from his high school squad that
won only three games in four years to a leader of the rejuventated
Stanford defense.
