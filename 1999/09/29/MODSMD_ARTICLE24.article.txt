# Off and running: Cross Country stars head to Stanford
## Men's squad looks to continue early season form 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
To predict that the Stanford
men's cross country team will come
away from Saturday's Stanford In
vitational as team champions is not
unreasonable. To predict how they
will accomplish that task, however,
is all but impossible.
The meet, now in its 26th-annual
rendition, will be a turf war among
Stanford team members, as home
contests always are. And No. 2
Stanford will face No. 7 Arizona
and No. 18 Alabama, so there will

be a few worthy adversaries as well.
But the question lies not so much
in the end. but in the means. With
the graduation of the I lauser twins.
Brad and Brent, as well as Jason
Balkman and Jon Weldon, the Car
dinal will rely on a bumper crop of
freshman and sophomore studs to
pick up the slack in a meet that
Stanford has, in recent years, made
a habit of dominating.
"We have a very different team
than we've had in the past," head
coach Vin Lananna said. "One of
our goals for this meet is to be able
to identify what our strengths are.

Quite honestly, I have no idea yet."
Stanford does return a solid core
of runners which should be present
at the head of the pack on Saturday.
Sophomore Ciahe Jennings is the
returning Stanford Invitational
champion, and senior Jake Maas
was sixth last year.
Sophomore Janiey Gifford and
junior Thomas Murley are also
solid bets for top performances.
However, the lead pack will be
peppered with jerseys from across
the nation. Arizona's Micheil Jones

and David Lopez will contend for
the individual title and Alabama's
I'im Broe and David Bazzi of Wash
ington are likely frontrunners.
"The race will go out fast, and we
will not be in a position to necessari
ly control the tempo," Lananna said.
" The objective this weekend will be
to see if we can group up as a team
in a competition."
But the lead pack waits for no
man. So if Stanford is going to run
for the win, it will likely be the young
guns playing catch-up.
Luckily for the Cardinal, several
of the new faces on the squad have
already shown that they are capable
of doing just that.
Freshman Andy Powell finished
within two seconds of champion
Jennings at BYU for fourth place
two weeks ago, while fellow frosh
Seth I lejnv was just 10 seconds back
in eighth.
Daniel Parris and Jesse Thomas,
both redshirt freshmen with signifi
cant cross-country experience, have
also shown their readiness to move
to the next level after outstanding
summers on the track.
Only junior Jonathon Riley,
Stanford's top returning N( A A fin
isher, is certain not tocompeteat the
Stanford Invite. Lananna plans to
open Riley's racing season at the
Oct. Hi Pre-NCAA meet in Bloom
ington. Ind. Because the team will
rely heavily on Riley during champi
onship season, Lananna decided to
rest him early in the year.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will
divide its ranks between the Stan
ford Invitational's championship
race, in which 20 teams including Al
abama and Arizona will compete,
the 34-team collegiate race and the

open race.
Lananna plans to provide bal
ance by dividing his aces between
two l()-man teams which will split
the championship-and-collegiate
race duty. Freshmen who have not
yet debuted, including Adam Ten
forde, Steve Loughlin and Sean
Knapp. among others, will preserve
their redshirt status by competing
unattached in the open race.
With the ranks spread thin, the
chance should arise for any of the
Cardinal harriers to step up into a
position of leadership, which is ex
actly what Lananna hopes to see.
"The good thing about this team
is that there is a lot of opportunity
for guys to come in and step into big
roles," Lananna said. "I'm just not
sure who's going to do it."
Coming off six weeks of high-vol
ume training, where logging 75-110
miles per week was the norm, just
surviving their first eight-kilometer
(five-mile) collegiate race could be
tough for many of the freshmen.
T his year's training schedule has not
departed from that of previous
years, and Lananna reports that the
freshmen are handling it better than
expected.
"If I took the faces off the bodies
out there, it's essentially business as
usual." Lananna said. "The work
outs are just as good as they've been
in past years.
"But what it comes down to is,
are they physically mature enough
to handle the wear and tear of an en
tire cross-country season?"
Despite all the uncertainty,
Lananna believes that the key for
the entire team Saturday will be to
hunker down and bunch up.
"For Stanford to have a good
men's team this year, we have to run
as a pack," said Lananna. "The
question is. 'can we run as a pack up
near the front?"' 1 don't think we've
been tested in that arena yet."
