# Off and running: Cross Country stars head to Stanford
## Men's squad looks to continue early season form 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
To predict that the Stanford
men's cross country team will come
away from Saturday's Stanford In
vitational as team champions is not
unreasonable. To predict how they
will accomplish that task, however,
is all but impossible.
The meet, now in its 26th-annual
rendition, will be a turf war among
Stanford team members, as home
contests always are. And No. 2
Stanford will face No. 7 Arizona
and No. 18 Alabama, so there will

be a few worthy adversaries as well.
But the question lies not so much
in the end. but in the means. With
the graduation of the I lauser twins.
Brad and Brent, as well as Jason
Balkman and Jon Weldon, the Car
dinal will rely on a bumper crop of
freshman and sophomore studs to
pick up the slack in a meet that
Stanford has, in recent years, made
a habit of dominating.
"We have a very different team
than we've had in the past," head
coach Vin Lananna said. "One of
our goals for this meet is to be able
to identify what our strengths are.

Quite honestly, I have no idea yet."
Stanford does return a solid core
of runners which should be present
at the head of the pack on Saturday.
Sophomore Ciahe Jennings is the
returning Stanford Invitational
champion, and senior Jake Maas
was sixth last year.
Sophomore Janiey Gifford and
junior Thomas Murley are also
solid bets for top performances.
However, the lead pack will be
peppered with jerseys from across
the nation. Arizona's Micheil Jones
