# Stanford event evokes tradition and prestige

While it might be obvious that
Stanford's picturesque golf course is
home to the Stanford golf teams,
the course is also home to another
less obvious but equally powerful
pair of Cardinal sport teams: men's
and women's cross country.
A challenging golf course, it re
mains equally challenging as a cross
country course. Despite lots of
shade and oak trees that are so nice
for spectators, temperatures for in
vite runners on the course are usual
ly quite high.

Over the years, many of the
finest runners in the world have
competed here. The course was
home of the NCAA District VIII
Championships for six seasons, the
Pacific 10 Championships from
1972-1997, and the USA Nationals
in 19%.
This Saturday, the course will
host the 26th annual Stanford Invi
tational Cross Country meet. This
year's meet will continue in the tra
dition with top teams competing at
both the high-school and collegiate
level.
"Our high school fields are all ex

trcmcly strong. The university
women's invitational section will
highlight the college competition.
In addition to No. 1 Stanford, the
race will include No. 2 Arkansas.
No. 4 BYU. No. 5 Wisconsin. No. <X
Kansas State and No. 10 Washing
ton." Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna said.
The men's competition includes
No. 1 Stanford, No. S Arizona and
No. IS Alabama. Rival California
will he competing on both the men's
and women's sides.
