# Stanford event evokes tradition and prestige

While it might be obvious that
Stanford's picturesque golf course is
home to the Stanford golf teams,
the course is also home to another
less obvious but equally powerful
pair of Cardinal sport teams: men's
and women's cross country.
A challenging golf course, it re
mains equally challenging as a cross
country course. Despite lots of
shade and oak trees that are so nice
for spectators, temperatures for in
vite runners on the course are usual
ly quite high.

Over the years, many of the
finest runners in the world have
competed here. The course was
home of the NCAA District VIII
Championships for six seasons, the
Pacific 10 Championships from
1972-1997, and the USA Nationals
in 19%.
This Saturday, the course will
host the 26th annual Stanford Invi
tational Cross Country meet. This
year's meet will continue in the tra
dition with top teams competing at
both the high-school and collegiate
level.
"Our high school fields are all ex

trcmcly strong. The university
women's invitational section will
highlight the college competition.
In addition to No. 1 Stanford, the
race will include No. 2 Arkansas.
No. 4 BYU. No. 5 Wisconsin. No. <X
Kansas State and No. 10 Washing
ton." Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna said.
The men's competition includes
No. 1 Stanford, No. S Arizona and
No. IS Alabama. Rival California
will he competing on both the men's
and women's sides.
The course will host 19 races for
college, high-school and open com
petitors; nearly 4,(KX) competitors
will line up for the challenge
throughout the day. Races begin at
9:45 a.m. and continue until 5:50
p.m. High school races run from
9:45 until 3:00, and college and uni
versity races run from 3:45 until 5:50.
The course is a five-kilometer
route for high school races and colle
giate women's, and an eight-kilome
ter route for collegiate men's. The
5K course starts out with a Hat loop,
crosses under the road and climbs a
long hill. The runners then come
back down the hill and along anoth
er flat stretch towards the finish.
The 8K course is the same, with
an addition after the hill. The men
cross a footbridge and head up a sec

ond, longer hill before heading back
to the finish to add the additional
3,(XX) meters.
"There's never really an advan
tage on our course, there's not >a
whole lot of ways to run, it's kind of
a simple course for the women. It's
a flat first mile, you run up the hill,
you come soaring down the hill, and
you finish. There's not a whole lot of
big-time calculating that you need to
do," Lananna said.
The Invite is one of the largest in
the United States. It has hosted both
high school and collegiate teams
since its inception.
The course itself has remained
relatively constant over its 26 years,
but the size of the field has in
creased. The growth of the meet has
been especially pronounced over
the last six years with the rising supe
riority of the Stanford teams. As the
teams have risen to dominance, the
meet has gained in quality and im

portance.
"The Stanford Invitational has
grown from a smaller, regional meet
to one that draws high schools and
colleges from all over the nation,"
Lananna said.
Many of the athletes that join
Cardinal cross country competed on
this course during their high school
careers. "Julia Stamps, Michael
Stember, Jonathan Stevens, I .indsav
Hyatt, Katie Hotchkiss, Katie Briz
gys are just a few of the current Stan
ford athletes who competed here in
high school." Lananna said.
Stamps shares the second-fastest
all-time mark on the course with a
16:47 for the SK. That time was run
during the 1997 Stanford Invitation
al and is the fastest women's time
ever for a Stanford woman. Stamps
was undefeated at the Invitational
during her high-school years.
Stamps shares the second-place
spot with Amy Yoder of Arkansas.

Yoder will also be competing this
Saturday, returning as the winner of
the 1998 Invitational with a time of
16:47.
Sally Glynn holds the sixth spot
on the list with her time of 17:19 at
the 1997 Stanford Invitational, and
seventh on the list is Caroline Annis,
with a time of 17:25 at the 1998 In
vite.
On the men's side, Gabe Jen
nings holds sixth place on the top-10
Stanford performers list. Jennings
ran a 24:30 for the 8K at the 1998 In
vite. Teammate Jonathon Riley
shares the ninth spot with a time of
24:37 at 1997 Pac-10 competition.
The top times ever run on the
course were both run at the 1996
Pac-10 championships. For the men,
Mebrahtom Kellezighi of UCLA
holds the fastest time at 23:45, and
for the women, Amy Skieresz of
Arizona comes in first with a time of
16:36.
