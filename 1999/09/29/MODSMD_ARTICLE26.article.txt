# Field Hockey dispatches Pacific Tigers
## Stanford squad rebounds from double-overtime loss to Cal 
### Ashley Rich 
This past Sunday, the University
of the Pacific field hockey players
might have thought they had Stan
ford (4-5, 3-0 Northern Pacific Con
ference) in a vulnerable position after
the Cardinal lost to California in a
tight matchup last week.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Sunday: Stanford (4-5, 3-0 North
ern Pacific Conference) 5 Pacific 0.

Instead, the Tigers never really
knew what hit them when senior for
ward Lindsey Dunagan, Stanford's
high scorer, posted her fifth goal of
the season after only three minutes of
play.
Fortunately, Stanford seemed en
ergized by the tough loss to Cal, not
threatened by it. "After the loss to
Cal, we didn't lose confidence,"
Dunagan said.
With that confidence in mind and
without letting down her intensity,
Dunagan scored again less than five
minutes later on an assist from fresh
man Amanda Billmyer.
Intimidated by those two quick
goals in the first few minutes, the
Tigers were eventually faced with a
barrage of more than 35 shots on
goal, and could only muster three
shots themselves as the Cardinal
went on to score five unanswered
goals.
This victory was a comeback after
a tight match last week against Cali
fornia which, after two 15-minute
overtimes, was determined on penal
ty strokes.
The Cardinal took that lesson to
heart and has been practicing those
penalty shots every day since. This
was apparent in the last minute of the

half when senior defender Julie
Gwozdz, who assisted Dunagan's
game-opening goal, scored her sec
ond goal of the season on a penalty
stroke.
After such a solid beginning,
sometimes it's easy for a team to let
down its intensity during the rest of
the game. To keep the intensity con
stant through halftime, head coach
Sheryl Johnson focused on the posi
tive.
"She said she was happy with the
way we were playing. She just asked
us to stay focused and keep playing
hard," Dunagan said.

And so they did. Sophomore for
ward Erica Swesey came out aggres
sively to score her second goal of the
season only four minutes into the sec
ond half. Freshman Christina
Williams scored the final goal five
minutes later.
The Cardinal is now into the mid
dle of its season and beginning to
work well together with six new
starters. It took a few games for the
team members to learn to work to
gether, but after their fourth win of
the season, they seem to be adjusting
just fine.
Communication on the field is a

key ingredient to this improvement,
whieh is what the team has been
working on since the beginning of the
season. Dunagan is confident about
the team's continual improvement.
"The team is a group of girls who
get along well on and off the field, and
1 think that makes a difference when
we're out there working together.
Everyone got in the game and con
tributed, which proves that there is no
weak link."
The team, turning around from
three losses to top-2() teams early in
the season, is now closer to evening
up its record.
