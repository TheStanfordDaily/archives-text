# Smaller Senate sets new goals

### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
The new Undergraduate Senate,
which met for the first time last
night, passed a bill yesterday dou
bling the amount of meetings they
will have, changing them from semi
monthly to weekly.
"Meeting weekly gives the Un
dergraduate Senate an opportunity
to communicate more regularly as a
group of 15 to discuss all the projects
it's working on," Levin said.
Last year's ASSU amendment
split the Graduate Student Council
and the Undergraduate Senate, cre
ating a Senate with 15 members and
a GSC, also with 15 members.
"We'll get more done and have
shorter meetings if we're touching
base every week," said Undergradu
ate Senate Chair Steven Aronowitz.
Meeting every other week was
inefficient, said Senator Nikki Love,
a senior.
"We'd meet only four or five
limes a quarter so the momentum
wouldn't pick up," Love said. "The
whole group can work together
more now."
The Senate attended a retreat
last weekend in Santa Cruz, where
they spent time together and chose
their top three priorities as a group.
"We didn't do that in the past be
cause 30 people is too big of a group,
but 15 is manageable." Love said.
Aronowitz said they decided that
the top three priorities were creating
student space on athletic facilities,
improving parking on campus and
increasing communication between
the administration and students.
Transportation for next year's
freshmen is a particular concern,
due to a policy that would prevent
them from parking on campus.
"We want the impact on their
quality of life to be as low as possi

ble," Aronowitz said, citing ideas
such as extending the Marguerite
routes and arranging buses to travel
to Tahoe and the beach.
"There's a lot of opportunity to
think of creative things," Love said,
mentioning the possibility of provid
ing complimentary CalTrain passes
and improving the food options on
campus so there's less of a need to
leave.
The split from the GSC also helps
the Undergraduate Senate to focus.
Love said.
"With only 15 people now,
there's increased accountability,"
Aronowitz said. "If someone's not
at a meeting, it's very noticeable. If
someone's not volunteering, it's
very noticeable."
Senator Mike Dudas, a junior,
agreed that the split enables the Un
dergraduate Senate to funnel re
sources better.
"Funding is easier because you
can see where the undergraduate
money is going and where the grad
uate money is going," he said.
The Senate's greatest challenge
this year will be fighting preconcep
tions about the ASSU, Levin said.
He and ASSU Vice President John
Mills have been on campus all sum
mer, and Levin said they saw how
the community will take them seri
ously if they take themselves seri
ously.
In addition to their three priori
ties, the senators have other pro
jects.
Aronowitz said he hopes to re
vamp the ASSU bylaws and make
the parliamentary procedure more
flexible.
"With onjy 1.5 members, [the cur
rent procedure] is cumbersome," he
said.
In addition, the senators intend
to change the appropriations
process, allowing student groups to
get funding faster.
"In the past, that has been a
source of complaint from some stu
dent group leaders," said Senator
Ben Fiu, a senior.
Dudas is working to arrange
concerts in Tresidder on Thursday
nights as a replacement for CoHo
performances.
Levin also said he hopes to begin
dorm outreach programs, which in
clude assigning a senator for each
dorm it has someone to contact.
