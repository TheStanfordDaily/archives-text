As the Digital Language Lab in
Meyer Library enters its second
quarter of operation, it lias garnered
praise from teachers and students for
its ability to let students practi. : a for
eign language and learn about differ
ent cultures.
"The feedback I've gotten from
instructors was all very positive," said
German Studies Prof. Elizabeth
Bernhardt, director of the Language
Center. "The only complaint we've

had is too many people trying to use
[the lab]. There never seem to be
enough computers or space."
The Language Lab consists of a
multimedia seminar room, a class
room for computer-based instruction
and a multimedia lab where students
can take exams and practice their lan
guage skills.
Since opening in spring quarter
1999, the Language Lab has been in
use for five hours of classes each day,
in addition to time for students to
practice 011 their own. It is available

for use with all foreign language class
es. encompassing 1,60() students.
The Digital Language Lab allows
instructors to easily evaluate stu
dents' speaking skills.
"[This] was very difficult to do
when you had to make an individual
appointment with each student." said
Bernhardt. "A professor could meet
with a student two or three times per
quarter."
Language teachers could now test
students' verbal skills every day.
Bernhardt said.

"I think the Language Lab helps
out a lot," said sophomore Brian
Johnson. "It's really a bonus to be
able to record yourself there."
The Digital Language Lab has
also freed up class time for instruction
by allowing teachers to assign quizzes
and exams for outside of class. Ac
cording to Language Center esti
mates, the Language Lab has in
creased available instructional time
by about 15 percent.
However, not all students have
been able to see these benefits.
"It's an interesting concept to use
this interactive system, but it's hon
estly causing more trouble than help.
I would prefer to stick to the class
room, at least until I figure everything
out." said freshman Chelsea Swett.
According to Bernhardt, students
have also benefited from the multi
media workstations in the lab area.
Students in one class taught by senior
German lecturer Kathryn Strachota
were able to read current news in
German while the audio of the news
cast played on their computers.
"They could hear it spoken with a
proper German accent ... as they
were reading it." Strachota said.
"That was very helpful."
Asian Languages lecturer Hisayo
Okano Lipton has used the Lan
guage Lab for interactive learning in
her first-year Japanese classes. Class
projects included online research
groups and virtual shopping in Japan
ese department stores.
"They can experience a lot more
things in Japan than they would oth
erwise." said Lipton.
