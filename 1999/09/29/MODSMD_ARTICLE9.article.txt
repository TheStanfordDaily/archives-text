## Bill Bradley devises sweeping federal health plan 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Presi
dential candidate Bill Bradley
unveiled a $C>s billion-plan Tuesday
to dramatically expand the federal
health care system, and accused Al
Gore of shying away from the chal
lenge to insure all Americans.
I his is not the time to he
timid." he said.
Bradley, who called health care
coverage an unalienable right — as
much as the guarantees of "life, lib
erty and pursuit of happiness"
would allow Americans to enroll in
the same health-care coverage pro
vided lor members of C ongrcss and
federal employees, potentially
exploding the si/e of the Federal

Employees' Health Benefits Pro
gram.
The poor would get subsidies,
parents would be told to seek insur
ance for their newborns, the Medi
caid system would be largely
scrapped and tax breaks would go
to all Americans who pay insurance
premiums.
Gore's campaign called
Bradley's plan "wildly unrealistic"
and "wildly expensive." defending
the vice president's more limited
approach that would expand feder
al efforts to insure all children and
incrementally extend coverage to
uninsured adults.
Bradley, for his part, made clear

what he thought of the Gore plan.
"I think that what he has proposed
is definitely timid compared to
what we have proposed." he said at
a news conference following the
speech.
The sweeping, expensive nature
of the program fits with Bradley's
promise to be the candidate of "big
ideas." But his proposal also opens
the former New Jersey senator to
criticism that he is pushing liberal,
big-government solutions to a com
plicated problem.
Mindful of the failure of Presi
dent Bill Clinton's IW3 health care
plan, Bradley said he would not
create "a massive bureaucracy."

Bradley is mounting a stiff chal
lenge to Gore in early primary
states, largely because of his sup
port among independents and
moderate Democrats. Yet, on
health care and other issues,
Bradley is generally more liberal
leaning than the vice president as
he seeks to carve into Gore's polit
ical base.
"We can commit ourselves to
the proposition that when it comes
to health care, everyone will have
the American dream — at last,"
Bradley told S(M) supporters and
students packed into an auditorium
at l.os Angeles Valley College.
I le said his price tag "is a great

deal of money, but a campaign pro
posal without a price tag is just
another politician's promise." The
line was a clear reference to Gore,
who has not estimated the cost of
his health-care plan.
Supporters of the vice president
distributed press releases at the col
lege questioning the cost of
Bradley's plan and suggesting that
employers might be tempted to
drop insurance coverage provided
to employees. Bradley said he had
no plan to forbid employers from
dropping coverage, but he left the
door open to address the problem
later.
Under his plan, people and fam

ilies at or near the poverty line
would get subsidies, either for pri
vate insurance or to opt into the
expanded federal system.
Americans of all incomes and
ages would be able to exclude from
their taxable income whatever they
pay in health-care premiums, a ben
efit Bradley designed for middle
class Americans who don't qualify
for subsidies. It also would apply to
the wealthy.
Bradley's response to critics will
be: At least I'm trying. Aides said
he had Gore in mind in saying,
"When it comes to America's
health, this is not the time to be
timid. It requires bold action."
