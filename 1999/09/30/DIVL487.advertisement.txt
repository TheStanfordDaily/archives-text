Everybody loves to trash teenagers, right?
Maybe they don't realize that we do care. That we can make
a difference. Get involved in Crime Prevention. Clean up parks.
Teach younger kids. Start a school or neighborhood watch.
And help make your community safer and better for everyone.
Together, we can prove them wrong by doing something right.
