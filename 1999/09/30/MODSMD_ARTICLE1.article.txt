# Telephone rates called into question

An ever-increasing number of
long-distance carriers are offering
special rates and sign-up incen
tives. hut for Stanford students on
campus, the only choice is the
University's long distance pack
age.
Some students are concerned
about limited choices, as plans by
national carriers have the poten
tial to offer savings over the Stan
ford plan.
"I think what they're offering
is fairly reasonable, but it would
be nice to have a choice of some
thing cheaper," junior Andrew
I linderaker said.
Stanford students pay 10 cents
a minute for state-to-state long
distance calls made during stan
dard hours (S a.m. to 11 p.m. on
weekdays) and 9 cents a minute at
night and on weekends.
Longdistance calls within Cal
ifornia cost between 4 cents and
cents a minute.
"I don't like it very much."
said Kylene Kilgore, a sopho
more from Texas. "We don't
have the option to use the lower
rates offered by other companies.
We're latched into much higher
rates. If 1 was from California I
wouldn't mind so much, but out
of-state calls are so much higher."
The University has looked
into offering students a range of

Stanford state-to-state long distance charges often surpass the rates of major national providers. Mean
while, international rates to countries such as India, where many of Stanford's graduate students call
home, tend to be significantly higher with Stanford's plan as well.
different options, said Maureen
Trimm, assistant director of Commu
nication and Networking Services.
But given the small size of the Uni
versity, the average student would
suffer for the benefit of a few.
"What we're looking at is average
pricing that benefits the majority of
the people. At this point, we have not
found a reasonable way that still ben
efits the majority of students," she
said.
A visit to a Website known as
www.abelltolls.com, which compares
long distance rates, yields numerous
deals offered by old standards like
AT&T, as well as by virtual un
knowns such as WorldxChange,
which offers a five percent discount
for online hilling.
Of the country's three major long
distance carriers, AT&T offers a fiat
rate of 7 cents a minute, MCI World
com offers 5 cents a minute at night
and on weekends, and Sprint offers a
flat rate of 10 cents a minute, with 2(X)
minutes of free calls.
Stanford's rates for long-distance
calls within California are on par with
the cheapest plans. And Trimm said
national rates have dropped from 13
cents a minute last September to the
current rate of 10 cents a minute.
While some students are frustrat
ed at not being able to take advantage
of lower national rates, Trimm said
students need to read the fine print
before they conclude that they have a
raw deal.
"On the Stanford plan, there's no
monthly minimum and noservice fee.
With AT&T, you pay ... service fees
on top of your calls," Trimm added.
Many of the long distance pack
ages offered by other carriers contain
hidden costs and times of day when
the rates skyrocket.
For example, though MCI World
com is only five cents a minute after 7
p.m., a subscriber pays five times that
amount for calls made before 7 p.m.
In addition, most carriers tack on
monthly service fees ranging from

roughly $4 to $12 a month.
"Obviously 9 cents a minute
doesn't look as good as 7.5 a minute,
but you may not really be paying
more. You need to look at the whole
set of details," Trimm said.
Still, Trimm conceded, "There are
a variety of plans out there that may,
given a student's particular habits,
give you a better deal."
For example, if a student were to
opt for the MCI Worldcom plan and
was willing to stick to making long
distance calls between 7 p.m. and 7
a.m., it is possible to pay about half
the amount Stanford's plan charges.
But many students said the Uni
versity long distance rates meet their
needs pretty well.
"I like the convenience that it of
fers. You can make a call from any
phone on campus," senior Carlos
Martinez said.
"It would be nice to have the op
tion of looking at other plans," said
Ravi Singh, a first-year graduate stu
dent, "but when I signed up. the rates
didn't seem terrible, and the conve
nience of it was nice."
International students may also be
paying more for Stanford services
than they otherwise might.
Graduate student Sze-Chin Lee
subscribes to a carrier service called
the Koala Calling Card because it is
more expensive to call his native Sin
gapore on the Stanford plan.
He estimates that he saves be
tween 20 and 40 percent by using his
calling card. "Friends who studied at
Stanford before recommended using
a calling card instead of using Stan
ford services," he said.
Under Stanford rates, a call to the
United Kingdom costs 39 cents for
the first minute and 15 cents a minute
thereafter during standard hours.
Meanwhile, AT&T's One Rate
plan offers 12 cents a minute with a
$5.50 monthly service fee. MCI
Worldcom charges 26.8 cents and
Sprint charges 12.8 cents.
"It is a monopoly," Trimm said,
"sort of like your meal plan. Basical
ly, the University has chosen what
looks to be the best deal for most stu
dents."
