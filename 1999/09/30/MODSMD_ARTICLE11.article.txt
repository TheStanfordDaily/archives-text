Renovation of post
office raises tempo
rary concerns

In an attempt to quell complaints
of long lines and slow service, offi
cials at the Stanford post office
have decided to undertake a series of
renovations which will improve their
ability to better serve customers.
In a meeting to be held on Oct. 1,
Stanford post office officials will meet
with the Stanford Management Com
pany to solidify plans for the sched
uled renovations.
The renovations, which were origi
nally slated to begin prior to the 1999-
20(H) school year, will now not begin
until the leaders of the project meet
with contractors to get bills and esti
mates.
Once the renovations do com
mence, the post office will be moved
to the field adjacent to Florence
Moore Hall. A tent will house post
office boxes, and the retail counter
will operate out of a trailer.
The renovated post office will pro
vide post office boxes in a lighted
interior lobby that will be open 24
hours a day. It will also feature a self
service area with additional vending
machines, a retail service area for
packing boxes and supplies and a one
on-one service counter.
Iliough the thought of these new
features is exciting to anyone who has
ever had to struggle with their post
office box combination in the dark or
stand in line to pick up a package, the
thought of the service which will be
offered until the renovations are com
pleted is disheartening.
Despite the fact that Flo Mo field is

only a three-minute jaunt from the
post office's current location in White
Plaza, the temporary location will
pose many inconveniences to the post
office's customers.
The first is the actual transition of
the post office from its current loca
tion to the field at Flo Mo. Will stu
dents retain their current post office
boxes, or will they receive new ones?
If so, will they need new keys or com
binations?
How will post office officials guar
antee that mail is safe if it is being
stored in a tent? The concept of stor
ing mail in an outdoor location pre
sents the possibilities of both damage
from rain and theft.
Another inconvenience is that the
majority of people at Stanford pass
through White Plaza at least once a
day, whereas most have no reason to
pass by Flo Mo. Not only will students
have to make an extra effort to trek to
the temporary post office, but they
will also have to contend with traffic
on their way to get there.
Once at the field, the post office
customers will face further problems.
Where will they be able to park and
lock their bikes? There is currently
not an entrance to the field from the
road; will one be made?
Though the actions which the post
office officials are undertaking to
allow for future improved service are
commendable, they must remember
to give their customers quality service
until the renovated post office is
opened. They could start by inform
ing students of what they will
encounter once the post office moves
and continue bv ensuring that service
is undiminished during the interrup
tion.
