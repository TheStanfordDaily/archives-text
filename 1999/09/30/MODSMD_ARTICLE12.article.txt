Stadium plagued by over
zealous com m ercialism
Does the marketing arm of Stanford's
athletic side have no comprehension of
state, style or forbearance in their
onslaught of commercial blather at Stan
ford Stadium? Excitement and drama in
one of the best football games in years
suffered hv the continual ill-timed, inap
propriate and over-amplified intrusions
for GTE, Pepsi, Chronicle, Excite @
Home, banks, airlines, license plate
games, the stupid "couch potato" con
tests and, not kidding, the NASDAQ!
Expensive tickets should proscribe
one's being a target for disturbing,
unwanted, non-productive and foolish
advertising. Having attended hundreds of
Stanford games before Stanford knew
how to spell "marketing" and when the
stadium announcer, unafflictcd with ver
bal diarrhea, conveyed excitement and
tension in a restrained way. I feel a great
diminution in the current ambiance of
Stanford Stadium and the game itself.
The Athletic Department should
rethink the equation of dollars and blath
er versus style and drama. When will the
students, the long-time fans, the big
donors and the Buck Club guys rebel
against this over zealous commercialism?
