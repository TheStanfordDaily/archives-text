# Bookstore nets sales despite competition
## 
### Ben Alexander-Bloch 
For students buying textbooks,
alternatives to the Stanford Book
store abound, many of which exist
in the market of Internet book
sellers.
This past week, students had to
weave through book-buying op
tions as they chose where to pur
chase their texts.
Shying away from the complica
tions of Internet sales, most stu
dents opted to buy books from the
Bookstore this quarter, citing avail
ability and convenience. Students
were also reluctant to buy books on
the Internet due to the wait for
shipping, and some also empha
sized the ease of returning books to
the Stanford Bookstore.
"The only reason I purchased

my books through the Bookstore
was that I was in a rush." freshman
Jason Walker said. "Now that I see
the savings. I'm going to order my
books via the Internet in advance
for next quarter."
The rush of the first quarter may
be a key factor in the Bookstore's
continued high sales.
Bookstore Marketing Manager
Jef Friedel said that sales have not
been affected by the new forms of
competition.
In fact. Friedel said he welcomes
the challenge. He said he believes
that competition among book
sellers will eventually force pub
lishers to lower their wholesale
textbook prices.
However, some students did
find time to shop at Internet ven
dors and even to organize altema

live options.
Senior Andy Ku and junior Eric
Hsu created a non-profit book
swap enterprise called Frog Books,
in which students give Ku and Hsu
used textbooks that Frog Books at
tempts to resell at prices lower than
the Bookstore's. Frog Books then
reimburses the original book-own
ers.
"We had a lot of support from
students, and we are still continu
ing to get requests via e-mail for
books," Ku said.
Ku said he hopes that Frog
Books' sales will increase next
quarter as word spreads among stu
dents.

"My decision to purchase
through the Internet — or at least
to get information over the Net —
was based on my being cheap." said
freshman Charlie Sprenger.
"It was relatively easy to find
people willing to unload their
books on campus ... all I had to do
was run around."
Presently, the Bookstore re
mains the primary seller on cam
pus, but as Internet vendors be
come more convenient and Stan
ford students become more in
formed, a change may be in store.
"It's heading toward the time
when everyone will purchase over
the Web," said junior Stan Lin.
