# Board adds two spots
## Judiciary Board monitors Greeks 
### Frank Pollock 
The Greek Judiciary Board,
charged with handling all discipli
nary matters within Stanlord's
Greek community, has added two
additional positions this year to its
nine-member group. In addition
to the three fraternity students,
three sorority students and three
unaffiliated students nominated
by the ASSU, this year's Board
will also include two representa
tives of the African American Fra
ternity / Sorority Association
(AAFSA).
The presidents of the Inter-
Fraternity and Inter-Sorority
Councils, seniors Tim Fisher and
Stephanie Blossom, respectively,
are also automatically included on
the board. All meetings are super
vised by a faculty advisor.
Newly-named members to this
year's Board include senior Adam
Weiss and junior Alice Gainer,
and additional members will be
named shortly.
The Board is a vital part of
Greek life at Stanford. When
problems emerge within fraterni
ties and sororities, the Board's de
cisions can drastically affect the
fate of Greek organizations. The
Judiciary Board reviews all allega
tions against fraternities and
sororities and decides whether an
official University hearing should
be scheduled.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Students Morris Graves, because
Greek organizations are the only

groups on campus with
memberships, the actions of indi 5
vidual members are represenui-i
tive of the entire group, or even o&
the Greek community in general. }
If the Board decides that I'ni *
versity policy has been broken, iisjß
recommendation for punishment
is passed along to Dean of Sir
dents Marc Wais, who finali, jf
the action.
"I follow the suggestions ol tin jj
Judiciary Board nine out ol
times," Wais said. >
According to Graves, the Uni- *
versity trains the Board to set >
aside personal feelings and act in -
the best interests of the University
and the Greek community. The.*
Board is guided by precedent and V
by a desire to prevent future prob- \
lems. \
"The Judiciary Board and the *
Dean's office are here to be proac-
tive. not reactive, so as to prevent ,♦
future situations like the (Phi •'
Delta Theta) situation," Graves,,j
said.
Phi Delt lost its house last win
ter due to alcohol violations.
The Board determines the'*
severity of punishments based on
the nature of infractions. Board >
recommendations often include'
community service projects and
awareness programs. »
Occasionally, the Boaid is*
forced to act more harshly. For ex
ample, it endorsed the aforemen
tioned eviction of Phi Delt. as we IK
as the de-housing of the Deltas
Kappa Epsilon fraternity in June.
