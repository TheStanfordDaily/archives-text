Although women's volleyball
head eoaeh Don Shaw's concerns
that his team might lose its locus
for its match against Fresno State
were justified, in hindsight they
seemed downright silly.

it would be tough to mentally pre
pare for a non-conference, mid
week game against an opponent
whom you have defeated 13 out of

14 times would appear to be purely
rational.

â–  Tuesday: No. 7 Stanford (9-1) del.
Fresno State (6-7). 15-2. 15-9. 15-3.
Especially when Shaw's women
were coming off emotional wins
this past weekend against I Jtah and
No. 10 Briuham Younti in the Pa
