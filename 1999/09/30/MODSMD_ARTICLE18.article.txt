Although women's volleyball
head eoaeh Don Shaw's concerns
that his team might lose its locus
for its match against Fresno State
were justified, in hindsight they
seemed downright silly.
Prior to the match, the idea that
it would be tough to mentally pre
pare for a non-conference, mid
week game against an opponent
whom you have defeated 13 out of

14 times would appear to be purely
rational.

that many key players were injured

have cause for concern — that is,

Fresno State (6-7). despite com
ing into the match at .500, had only
one win on its home court. Stan
lord. an excellent road team, was
determined to keep it that way.
Proving the team's mental capa
bilities to be equal to its physical
prowess, the Cardinal (9-1,3-0 Pac
-10) tore through Bulldogs 15-2, 15-
9. 15-3. devouring them as the team
has its past eight opponents. The
game was completed in only 62
minutes as the Stanford women
displayed tenacious defense in
dominating the game from start to
finish.
The day off on Sunday and light
practice on Monday seemed to aid
the Cardinal team, which, despite
the three-hour-plus bus ride, came
out hard and focused in the first
game. The Cardinal built an insur
mountable lead behind a strong de
fensive effort, holding the Bulldogs
to a lowly .029 hitting percentage
throughout the entire match, the
lowest percentage by a Stanford
opponent since Missouri hit .094 on
Sept. 5, 1997.

The Cardinal also dominated
the net, notching 11 blocks overall
to Fresno State's three. Despite a
few minor lapses in the second
game, the women were able to pull
away fairly easily and wrapped the
match up in the third game with lit
tle resistance from the Bulldogs.
The three-game sweep was Stan
ford's fifth during its current eight
match winning streak.
The ease with which Stanford
dismissed Fresno State can be at
tributed not only to stellar defense
but also excellent execution.
Sophomore middle blocker Sara
Sandrik led the way for the Cardi
nal with eight kills and seven digs
(both team highs) as well as four
blocks. She finished with a hitting
percentage of .500.
Other major contributors in
cluded sophomore middle blocker
Tara Conrad, who added six kills
and six blocks, and freshman stand
out Logan Tom, who had six kills
and six digs.
Junior setter Robyn Lewis, who
had been out the early part of the
season recovering from knee
surgery, was able to play an entire
game in the match, which was a
major breakthrough.
Conrad expressed satisfaction
with the level of play of the team
overall.
"We're starting to play more
solid with fewer breakdowns," she
said.
She also observed that the
matches against Utah and BYU ac
tually gave them momentum going
into the Fresno contest.
"This last weekend helped us re
alize what we can do," Conrad said.
"We want to continue that."
The Cardinal will try to do just
that as the team prepares to host
Oregon and Oregon State on Thur
dav and Friday. The team will look
to add to its 31-game home winning
streak as they go against two Pac
-10 rivals.
