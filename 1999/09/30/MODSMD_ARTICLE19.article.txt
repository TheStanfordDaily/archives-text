# Stanford looks to defend home turf
## Women runners gear up for prestigious Stanford Invitational

Two weeks ago in Provo. Utah, the
then-No. 2 Stanford women's cross coun

Brigham Young Cougars at the I riple
Crown Invitational. After a week oil lor
both the Cardinal and the top three
women of BYU. the two rivals meet again
Saturday on the Stanford (ioll ( ourse.
this time with the Cardinal pegged as the
No. 1 team in the nation.
Usually an early season matchup of
two top teams with a deep history is
enough to provide for an exciting race,
but the women's championship race at the
26th Annual Stanford Invite offers much
more.
While Stanford and now-No. 4 BYU

have combined to take two of the last
three national titles, it isn't unlikely that
both teams will be upstaged by second-

No. 10 Washington and the total of top-10
teams reaches six. Next to the national
championship meet, the race should be
the best team competition of the season.
In years past, the Stanford Invitational
has been the meet that shows the ( ardinal
where it stands among national competi
tion. Having lost only one senior. All-
American Marv Cobb, to graduation, this

squad already knows it stands at or near
the top. With freshman Lauren Fleshman
trailing first-place teammate Julia
Stamps, the sixth-place finisher at last
year's nationals, by just four tenths of a
second in Provo, certainly the coaches
that participate in the national poll have
recognized Stanford's potential to bring
home the NCAA title.

All-American seasons in both in

Glynn is primed for a strong start
after sitting out the first two Stan
ford victories.
1 think that our objective
for the women will be
each week to just
be better than we were
the week before. So far
we're two-for-two.'
— Head coach Vin Lananna
Joining Glynn in debuting will
be freshman Erin Sullivan, jhe
1997 and 1998 Footlocker National
Cross Country Champion. Sullivan
will be the last of Stanford's top
three cross country recruits to race,
as 1998 Footlocker runner-up
Fleshman and 1997 runner-up
Mariel Ettinger both had stellar
openings in the win over BYU.
Not wanting to put too much
focus on an early season meet,
Stanford head coach Vin Lananna
may not stack all of his big guns in
the championship race, opting in
stead to run some women in the
earlier collegiate section.
"I have been working very
closely along with assistant coach
Dena Evans watching the progress
of all of runners," Lananna said.
"Our plan is not to run all of our
women every week. Our plan is to
kind of mix and match and juggle
— not to just go out there and put
everyone on the starting line and
hope they run well.
"I think you'll see much more of
a balanced approach to the two
races this weekend," he said.

"We're going to put together a
good collegiate team and good
championship team, not necessari
ly load one field and not the other."
With Stanford's squad split and
Stamps potentially absent, the un
defeated Arkansas Lady Razor
backs would be considered the fa
vorite to take the championship
race. Senior Razorback Amy
Yoder is without a doubt favored
to capture the individual title.
After edging teammate Jessica
Dailey last year for the title, Yoder
went on to a third-place finish at
NCAAs.
Along with Dailey. who was also
a top-l() finisher at nationals.
Yoder is joined by standout-junior

Wisconsin will make a break for
the team title with sophomore
Erica Palmer leading the way as
will Kansas State with freshman
phenom Amy Mortimer. Stanford
will also get its first glimpse of Pa
cific 10 Conference threat Wash
ington with frontrunners Melinda
Campbell, a junior transfer from
Boise State. Jen Schindler and
Anna Aoki expected to compete.
"The race will be very, very
good all the way around, but we
have a really good team too,"
Lananna said. "I think that our ob
jective for the women will be each
week to just be better than we were
the week before. So far we're two
for-two. We were good in Reno, a
little better at BYU. and I'm hop
ing that this weekend we'll be even
better until we really figure out
what our best strategy is in terms of
going into the championship."
BYU came on top at last year's
meet, followed by Stanford,
Arkansas and Wisconsin.
