### Jed Rose Contributing writer 
Biological Sciences Prof. Joan
Roughgarden stepped down from
her position as director of Earth
Systems last week and will be re
placed by Prof. Pam Miitson.of the
Institute of International Studies.
Last year. Mat son served as in
terim director of Earth Systems
during Roughgarden's one-year
sabbatical in Santa Barbara last
year. After returning to Stanford
this fall. Roughgarden decided to
step down.
In a letter to the Earth Systems
Steering Committee this week.
Roughgarden described her deci
sion as one made "with great sor
row."
"Logically. I could foresee the

necessity for step
ping aside, but
found the sense of
loss when it actu
ally happened to
be heartbreak
ing." she wrote.
Roughgarden
will continue to be

involved with the
department through teaching and
advising.
She is also starting a natural re
sources consulting company.
In her letter. Roughgarden em
phasized departmental collabora
tion ;is key to continued success.
"Together we have created a
program that has'attracted national
attention." she wrote.
"[Our] plan of organization and
[our] syllabus arc regularly solicit-

Ed by other universities aspiring to
establish ;i program like ours."
Ihe Harth Systems Program,
whieh emphasizes the interplay be
tween the earth sciences, ecology,
evolution, economics and environ
mental technology, was founded in
h.)92.
I lie major was initially expected
to attract about 40 undergraduates,
but the number of students in the
program rose to about 100 students
within its first three years.
According to Roughgarden, the
opportunity to hand over the pro
gram to a veteran of the depart
ment made her decision easier.
" This timing will permit Pam to
continue the momentum she devel
oped during the year I was gone."


Matson
Roughgarden wrote.
Matson praised Roughgarden s
work and said the program was
"created before its time."
"[Roughgarden] built the pro
gram. She did a wonderful job of
building the program from the
ground up with support and enthu
siasm from faculty and students all
over campus," Matson said.
The program has become a
"model" since Roughgarden first
envisioned it more than eight years
ago.
"Our program is the model for
other universities," said Matson.
"I'm going to do my best to keep

the support and enthusiasm of the
faculty that Joan built."
"One of our plans for the pro
gram is to evaluate the potential for
a new graduate program in Earth
Systems and environmental stud
ies. If that happens, the program
would probahlv grow quite a bit."
Both Roughgarden and Matson
said that they are optimistic about
the future success of Earth Sys
tems.
In 1995 the Senate renewed a
degree-granting authority for eight
years, the first time such a privilege
was bestowed for more a five-year
term.
"II we can continue to work to
gether as we have done with Earth
Systems, we'll surely do the right
thing," said Roughgarden.
