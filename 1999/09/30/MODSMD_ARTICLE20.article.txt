# Running away from the pack
## Freshman standout helps lead powerful cross country squad 
### Nancy Lord 
One of freshman Lauren Mesh
man's focuses for her first cross
country season at Stanford is to
make a smooth transition from
high-school to collegiate competi
tion. She has already proven herself

remarkably successful at doing so.
Fleshman broke out with a sec
ond place finish at the Brigham
Young Invitational two weeks ago,
where the women's team took the
team title from defending NCAA
champion BYU.
Teammate Julia Stamps led an

intense one-two finish; Stamps win
ning with a time of 16:48.3 and
Fleshman finishing almost simulta
neously with a time of 16:48.7
"Lauren did a remarkable job in
our first competition," head coach
Vin Lananna said. "She has made
an excellent transition from an out
standing high-school runner to a
key runner on a nationally-ac
claimed cross country team."
This impressive start to her col
legiate racing follows a decorated
high-school career. Runner-up at
the 1998 Footlocker National
Championships, Fleshman com
peted in eight races during her se
nior year, winning five of the races
and placing second in the other
three.
Fleshman is one of a number of
amazing freshmen joining the
women's team this year as Stanford
brought in one of the top recruiting
classes in the country.
With the success that she
achieved in high school, Fleshman
had many college options. Her
choice of Stanford was based on the
reputation of the school both acad
emically and athletically.
"The reputation of the acade
mics and cross country teams here
are very well known across the
country," she said. "The cross
country teams are always a force in
NCAAs and the idea of being at a
school where everything's a step
above everything else is exciting.
The academics are a step above the
athletics are a step above and when
people see a Stanford uniform they
know that. I like that."
The Stanford women's team has
been a potent force that is constant
ly improving its reputation and is
able to bring in top athletes like
Fleshman.
"I like the opportunity to be on

a team that has a chance to win, and
to do something incredible and
take away a title from a lot of other
teams. I think the potential for suc
cess here in so many different ways
was very evident to me," Fleshman
said.
Making the jump from high
school to college has the potential
to be scary and traumatic, but
Fleshman has found it much easier
than anticipated.
"The people on the team made it
a really easy transition, it could
have been a lot harder," she said.
"I've had a lot of friends go to
places and say that it was just a ter
rible experience their freshman
year. 'It's too hard, the runners ran
too fast, they weren't very nice.'
Here at Stanford the girls want to
do well and anybody that comes on
the team they want to take in and
take care of them and make them
feel like a part of everything."
Another difficulty can be having
to learn how to deal with a new set
of coaches and completely new
strategies. Fleshman said the strate
gy is different in college because of
the number of exceptional girls on
the team. Instead of having one or
two standouts, as in high school,
everyone here is a strong runner.
"The coaches here are really
nice and very interested in every as
pect of your life. They make it easy
to focus on your sport because
everybody loves it," she said. "It's
not like high school where some
people are just doing it for whatev
er reason and only a few are doing
it because they love it. Here, every
body loves it so you get to take the
sport to such a higher level."
Coming into a top-ranked team
from a decorated past is exciting.
