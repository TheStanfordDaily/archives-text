# Running away from the pack
## Freshman standout helps lead powerful cross country squad 
### Nancy Lord 
One of freshman Lauren Mesh
man's focuses for her first cross
country season at Stanford is to
make a smooth transition from
high-school to collegiate competi
tion. She has already proven herself

remarkably successful at doing so.
Fleshman broke out with a sec
ond place finish at the Brigham
Young Invitational two weeks ago,
where the women's team took the
team title from defending NCAA
champion BYU.
Teammate Julia Stamps led an

intense one-two finish; Stamps win
ning with a time of 16:48.3 and
Fleshman finishing almost simulta
neously with a time of 16:48.7
"Lauren did a remarkable job in
our first competition," head coach
Vin Lananna said. "She has made
an excellent transition from an out
standing high-school runner to a
key runner on a nationally-ac
claimed cross country team."
This impressive start to her col
legiate racing follows a decorated
high-school career. Runner-up at
the 1998 Footlocker National
Championships, Fleshman com
peted in eight races during her se
nior year, winning five of the races
and placing second in the other
three.
Fleshman is one of a number of
amazing freshmen joining the
women's team this year as Stanford
brought in one of the top recruiting
classes in the country.
With the success that she
achieved in high school, Fleshman
had many college options. Her
choice of Stanford was based on the
reputation of the school both acad
emically and athletically.
"The reputation of the acade
mics and cross country teams here
are very well known across the
country," she said. "The cross
country teams are always a force in
NCAAs and the idea of being at a
school where everything's a step
above everything else is exciting.
The academics are a step above the
athletics are a step above and when
people see a Stanford uniform they
know that. I like that."
The Stanford women's team has
been a potent force that is constant
ly improving its reputation and is
able to bring in top athletes like
Fleshman.
"I like the opportunity to be on

a team that has a chance to win, and
to do something incredible and
take away a title from a lot of other
teams. I think the potential for suc
cess here in so many different ways
was very evident to me," Fleshman
said.
Making the jump from high
school to college has the potential
to be scary and traumatic, but
Fleshman has found it much easier
than anticipated.
"The people on the team made it
a really easy transition, it could
have been a lot harder," she said.
"I've had a lot of friends go to
places and say that it was just a ter
rible experience their freshman
year. 'It's too hard, the runners ran
too fast, they weren't very nice.'
Here at Stanford the girls want to
do well and anybody that comes on
the team they want to take in and
take care of them and make them
feel like a part of everything."
Another difficulty can be having
to learn how to deal with a new set
of coaches and completely new
strategies. Fleshman said the strate
gy is different in college because of
the number of exceptional girls on
the team. Instead of having one or
two standouts, as in high school,
everyone here is a strong runner.
"The coaches here are really
nice and very interested in every as
pect of your life. They make it easy
to focus on your sport because
everybody loves it," she said. "It's
not like high school where some
people are just doing it for whatev
er reason and only a few are doing
it because they love it. Here, every
body loves it so you get to take the
sport to such a higher level."
Coming into a top-ranked team
from a decorated past is exciting.


Joanna Hiatt â€” Daily
Freshman phenom Lauren Fleshman rounds out a strong women's
cross country recruiting class. She will be running this Saturday in
the Stanford Invitational.
but Fleshman also tcels the pressure
it brings.
"1 like the enthusiasm on the
team most, everybody's really anx
ious to do well and they train really
hard." Fleshman said. "They train
like champions every day. I'd also
say that in another way that's really
hard because coming in as a fresh
man there are very high expectations
on l he team.and you ha\e to be will

ing to come into that and be part of it
and that's hard to do.
"It's a huge commitment, and
also a lot of other teams are looking
up to Stanford to do incredible
things in the next couple years. A re
illy good recruiting class came in
and the people that are already here
are just getting faster and faster. The
expectations are a little bit hard. I
think it's all going to be worth ii in
the long run for the experience."
One main challenge of the stu
dent-athlete is to learn how to bal
ance the demanding athletics sched

ule with a tough academic load. This
can be particularly hard at first.
"So far I haven't quite figured out
how to do it." Fleshman said. "It's
hard because when you have work
outs. and when you know you have a
terrible workout coming up. it
makes you tired just thinking about
it. You're pretty much worthless
leading up to the workout, then you
have your workout and after your
workout you're tired for the next
live hours. It's pretty hard to lit work
in there somewhere.
"I'm still trying to figure il out.

I'm sure it will be easy once I get the
hang of it."
While there were many options
open to her. Fleshman knows she
made the right choice of schools.
The first thing that impressed her
was the beauty of campus, but now
she is most impressed by the people
she has met.
"Fvervbody I've met here has
something very special to offer, I
think that's so great," she said.
"Fverybody in my dorm will have
something about them that's unique
to them and incredible. That's why

they're here.
"I've been most impressed by the
people I've met. 1 think this place is
the perfect place to go to college, as
far as location, the way classes are set
up and the attitudes of the professors
and the students," Fleshman said.
As far as the future, Fleshman's
dreams do include a shot at the
Olympics if life permits it. Distance
runners hit their peak in their late
2()s. so they have to train hard for a
good six years after graduation to
have a shot at qualifying for the
Olympic team.

Fleshman's goals remain very
team-oriented. She wants to win the
NCAA championship with her team
because she feels it is "the Super
Bowl of cross country." After that
she just wants to run as fast as she
possibly can to help the team run
faster every year.
Like many athletes at Stanford,
Fleshman recognizes the impor
tance of academics as well.
"I want to do well here, to do as
well as the other students here at
Stanford and do my part academ
ically," she said.
