The women's volleyball team highlights
Cardinal mid-week sporting events this week
with two Paeific 10 Conference matchups.
The Cardinal (9-1,3-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
will host Oregon (6-6, 0-4) and Oregon State
(7-5, 1-3) at 7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion this
Thursday and Friday.
Coming off of a 62-minute three-game
sweep of Fresno State on Tuesday, the No. 7
Cardinal, sporting an eight-game winning
streak, should feel confident going into the
WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Thursday: No. 7 Stanford (9-1. 3-0 Pacific 10
Conference) vs. Oregon (6-6, 0-4), Maples
Pavilion. 7 p.m.
■ Friday: Stanford vs. Oregon State (7-5, 1-3),
Maples Pavilion, 7 p.m.
latter matches of the week. To put it in per
spective. the women's squad spent six hours
on a bus on Tuesday and just one hour crush
ing the Bulldogs.
The Oregon Ducks have yet to win a con
ference game, thus far not living up to the
team's goal of ending the season in the mid
dle of the Pac-10 standings. The team's last
bid for the NCAA postseason took place in
1989.
Ducks head coach Cathy Nelson feels her
current team is the deepest squad she has
fielded in her five years with the program. Of
Oregon's 14 players, nine are underclassmen
and only three are returning starters.
The squad's last two competitions ended
in losses to the Washington Huskies in four
games and Washington State University in
three games.
Oregon State also heads down to the Bay
Area for a weekend of tough competition .
After the team faces Stanford, it will travel
across the Bay to California on Saturday,
Oct. 2.
The Beavers have not defeated Stanford
in the teams' previous 28 meetings. The last
time Oregon State came out on top in a
matchup against the Cardinal was back in
1993.

Oregon State went 2-1 last weekend, de
feating both Portland and Washington State
in three games but falling 3-1 to Washington.
The Beavers boast three players breaking
into the record books at the moment. Sarah
Bjeldanes has posted 199 kills thus far this
season, placing her third in the Pac-lOwith a
4.52 kills-per-game average. Brandi
Bonnarens now sits third in all-time OSU as
sists with 2,206. Teammate Angie Shirley is
also moving up the OSU record books, and is
currently at seventh place for total blocks
with 299.
One might think the Stanford women's
volleyball team would be fatigued after such
a strenuous schedule competition schedule,
but the team feels ready to roll. The presea
son conditioning has undoubtedly paid off for
the Cardinal, as the squad enters midseason
in good shape.
The women's team has been conditioned
to play every game like it would in a postsea
son tournament competition.
Sophomore defensive specialist and setter
Emily Lawrence explained how head coach
Don Shaw prepares his team for regular sea
son games, saying. "No matter whom it is we
play, we play our hardest and treat it like a
championship."
One of the major goals for the volleyball
team is simply to remain focused during a
strenuous season. The lack of practice time in
between games makes this an especially chal
lenging goal for the team.
"We need to learn how to kill people and
not let up in the second game." Lawrence
said.
In the games against Utah and Brigham
Young last weekend, the women's squad al
lowed its opponent back into the fray during
the second game before the team was able to
put its opponent away for good. Stanford
dominated the Utes at the beginning of the
second game, but then allowed them to come
back and even gave them a chance to serve
for game point.
But if the team was getting nervous, the
15-2, 15-9, 15-3 victory over Fresno State on
Tuesday serves as clear evidence that the
squad has recently succeeded in not giving its
opponents too much breathing room.
