## 'Shear' entertainment Improv efforts are the highlights of the 'madness' 
### 
Walking into the theater of
America's longest-running
non-musical play, one might
be startled by the unexpected intimacy of
the setting. The tiny, boxy room holds
roughly 100 audience members and a
small stage decked out in truly tacky
hair-salon decor.
"Shear Madness," a boisterously en
tertaining, interactive whodunit, has the
advantage of a permanent setting in San
Francisco. Thus, it can use the smallest

theater it can find to create an unusual at
mosphere of involvement with the play
and characters. If it's sold out one night,
don't worry: it's been running successful
ly in Boston for over 20 years. This show
is not going anywhere.
The premise of the play is simple and
direct. During the course of the evening,
someone has murdered a character that
we never see: famous retired pianist and
recluse Isabel Czerny, who lives above
the hair salon Shear Madness (hence the
name of the play).
Who did it? Everyone's got a motive.
Was it the flamingly homosexual Tony,
owner of the salon, who is driven to fury
by Isabel's constant piano playing?
Could it have been his assistant Barbara,
who was Isabel's only friend and benefi
ciary of her will? Maybe it was Barbara's
shady beau Eddie, a used-antiques (get
it?) dealer, or the patrician Mrs. Shubert,
whose only incriminating act is a mysteri

ous phone call made right before we dis
cover the murder.
The first half of the play can be te
dious: you can tell it's been running for 20
years (two in San Francisco). Many of
the jokes are tired, the stereotypes over
done (some people might be offended by
Tony's flamboyant character), and the
physical comedy old. One of the play's
selling points is its adaptability to its set
ting, but you can tell when a San Francis
co joke has been plugged into a pre-se
lected spot. You get the feeling you're
seeing a play that's past its prime — at
least I did, when I noticed that most of
the audience was over 50.
The second half, however, makes up
for every bit that falls flat in the begin
ning. The two undercover cops that were
in the salon at the time of the murder ask
the audience to help solve the mystery.
The audience members are encouraged
to question the suspects and present their
own theories. During the intermission,
the cast stays on stage and in character,
chatting up the folks in the front rows.
Eddie offered my theatergoing partner
$300 for her necklace, and Tony gave us
some candy and pleaded, "You know I
didn't kill Isabel, right?" The kicker: the
audience votes for who we think did it, so
it's in the characters' best interests to but
ter everyone up, regardless of whether
the votes point to the right suspect.
With much of the play improvised, the
jokes become genuine and spontaneous,
and the interplay between a slightly
thickheaded cop and the viewers deter
mined to solve the puzzle is wildly enter
taining. These actors were born for im
prov, not for scripts, and it shows. When
one character is implicated, he or she will
not hesitate to glare at the accusing spec

tator and make unflattering retorts. They
can even became so involved that they
miss their timing in certain places. For
example, when one cop asked the other
about a phone call he just received, the
phone actually rang 10 seconds later.
This, of course, made it all the funnier.
"Shear Madness" has a long and glori
ous history; it's in the "Guinness Book of
World Records" as the longest-running
non-musical show, and it has won multi
ple comedy and theatrical awards. Begun
by Swiss playwright Paul Portner as a se
rious German murder mystery entitled
"Scherenschnitt," the play was adapted
into an English-language comedy by
Bruce Jordan and Marilyn Abrams in
1978. The pair continues to oversee their
brainchild's various incarnations in per

manent runs in Boston, Chicago, Wash
ington, D.C., and now here. (It also
boasts an international rendition called
"Scissor Happy.")
The show's flexibility (it changes
every night, not just every five years) and
participatory nature appeal to all kinds
of social groups. The first half feels more
like a preface; the real meat of the show
is the role that the audience plays, and
the novel ways in which the actors re
spond. I have to admit that at the begin
ning of this show, I felt just a little too
cool for it. However, after an hour, 1 was
either less cool, or (my preferred obser
vation) "Shear Madness" really is the
atrical comedy at its spunky best.
