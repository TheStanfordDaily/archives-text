# Are movies to blame for our immorality?

Washington is once again trying to submit
American creativity to government legisla
tion. Our Senate is preparing to vote on the
establishment of a Special Committee on American Cul
ture. The committee will investigate the impact of pop
culture on the morality of American youth by exploring
links between violent entertainment and crime and be
tween explicit sexual material and teen sexual activity.
This committee will attempt to determine whether
the movie industry, like the tobacco industry, can be held
responsible for the effects of its products on the public.
Headed by Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas), this com
mittee will have the power to subpoena documents and
witnesses, thereby hindering the movie-making process.
The whole argument about whether Hollywood sells
corruption to the American people ultimately boils
down to the chicken or the egg question — do Ameri
cans see violent and sexual films because that's all stu
dios are producing, or do studios produce such movies
because those are the ones that are box office successes?
This raises another question: are sex and violence im
plicitly bad? Movies like "Glory" and "Schindler's List"

could not have been made without violence, and what
would "The Crying Game" have been without sex?
Thanks to the First Amendment, no government
agency may dictate to studios what they can and cannot
produce. Any piece of artistic expression can be misused
when viewed by the wrong audience, and censorship
only leads to greater censorship. But if the government
is going to blatantly disregard the Constitution, they
should restrict audiences instead of censoring motion
pictures.
Stupid audiences are the real problem. Consequent
ly, the government should develop a standardized test to
determine if an individual is a fit and competent film
viewer. The following are a few example questions from
such an exam:
1. Does watching a cinematic murder give you the urge
to pick up a gun and shoot your neighbor?
2. Does witnessing sex in a movie increase your desire to
have sex with someone you abhor?

3. Does watching spy movies make you want to send top
secret documents to China?
4. If Bonnie and Qyde steal things, does that make steal
ing right?
5. Do images of the supernatural inflict a desire to wor
ship Satan?
A person earns a point for every "yes" answer, and
people who are considerably stupid should have "Stu
pid" tattooed on their foreheads. These individuals
would then be prohibited from entering theaters.
The alternative is to submit the movie industry to a
free-market economy. In such a scenario, moviegoers
would watch the movies they enjoyed. Those movies
would make healthy profits. And studios would produce
more movies of that kind, regardless of what that kind
might be. And the people would truly control the movie
industry.
