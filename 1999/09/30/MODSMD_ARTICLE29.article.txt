The 22nd Annual Bay Area Play
wrights Festival provides an un
usual experience for the average
theater-goer: a chance to actively partici
pate in the creative development of a
play. The festival, which runs through this
Sunday at A Traveling Jewish Theater in
San Francisco, focuses on the writer and
his relation to theatrical production. The
six plays represent the culmination of a
program sponsored by the Playwrights
Foundation, which includes a nation
wide script selection process, a weekend
"reading" retreat and a very brief re
hearsal period. These plays are not fin
ished productions but rather works in
progress, and the audience's "perfor
mance" at the readings is an integral part
of the playwrights' later revisions.

The plays are staged to emphasize the
language and the structure of the script.
The most obvious manifestation of this
emphasis is the physical presence of the
script on stage. The actors rehearse less
than 14 hours, and thus they carry the
script throughout the performance, often
glancing down to refer to it.

That said, there is some action on the
stage. Each playwright has been paired
with a director and a dramaturg (human
"idea box"). After the "reading" retreat
in Alamo, Calif., at which the playwright
gives his own reading of the script, the cre
ative team begins a month of rewriting
and staging. The working production also
includes sparse stage direction and sets. A
visual artist's response to the play flashes
on a big screen between scenes.
The combination of minimal produc

tion and the central presence of the script
evokes an attentive attitude from the au
dience. The playwright is present at the
performance and is able to observe the
audience reaction to a draft of his play,
rather than to the finished production.
After each performance, there is a discus
sion which includes the creative team, the
actors and the audience.
At the opening night performance of
"Debunking Love" by local playwright
Prince Gomolvilas, the team accepted

comments and questions from the audi
ence. The audience commented on par
ticular scenes and metaphors that had im
pressed them. The creative team then
uses this feedback to do another revision,
and a slightly different version of the play
is staged during the second week of the
festival.
"The purpose of the reading is to real
ly hone in on the words, the script," said
Gomolvilas. "Post-play discussions are
interesting but not instrumental to the de
velopment of a play. Sitting with the audi
ence is much more helpful. You can see
when they're bored, when they laugh."
The plays selected for this year's festi
val include: "Bones" by Lillian Garret-
Groag; "Debunking Love" by Prince Go
molvilas; "Forbidden City Blues" by
Alexander Woo; "Blood Winter" by Gar
ret Groenveld; "The Back Room at the
Nuovo Mondo" by David Ford; and "One
Size Fits All" by Rickerby Hinds.
Performances run nightly at 8 p.m.
through Saturday; there is also a 2 p.m.
performance on Saturday and a 7 p.m.
performance on Sunday. All perfor
mances take place at A Traveling Jewish
Theater, 470 Florida Street in San Fran
cisco. For reservations, call (415) 263-
