# 'Forever Plaid' will soon disappear from memory
## Comedy production is geared toward an older audience

£ ■ forever Bad" may be a better
rH title for this cheesy, slapstick
comedy about a group of four
singers — Francis, Sparky, Jinx and
Smudge — who die before their first
professional gig the same night.
Given the opportunity to perform one
last show, the foursome returns to Earth
after death to sing a medley of oldies
tunes. Although "Forever Plaid" does
have a few good one-liners (the singers
hope "to make the biggest comeback
since Lazarus"), the humor is average at
best and the plot seems to have no real
direction. Even if the plaid-suited musi
cians are supposed to be experiencing
deep, personal revelations, the play
seems to focus more on their nosebleeds
and gastrointestinal problems.
In many acts, the play does try to par
ody the stereotypical '50s style, with toe
tapping, head-bopping, hip-shaking
moves and a short skit presenting "The
Ed Sullivan Show." However, there is no

originality in their presentation, aside
from the song-and-dance number where
the Plaids use plungers as wands / micro
phones.
Perhaps the '50s songs and random
references to earlier musicians may ap
peal to an older crowd, but you know a
musical is starving for creativity when it
has"Heart and Soul" as a highlight.
And the songs which are supposed to
be innovative remakes, like "Day-O"
and "Shrangi-La," simply were not
meant to be so distorted. In fact,
throughout the play, the question arises:
are the actors supposed to be giving such
low-quality singing performances? It
seems tricky because the players are por

traying an amateur group who never
made it to the top while alive, but then it
seems a bad decision on the director's
part to have the Plaids sing for 90 percent
of the show. Maybe the audience would
prefer hearing the performers just talk
about their singing experience instead.
When the play does reach its cli
max — the group receives a set of plaid
suits (surprise!) — something seems to
be lacking in the interest department.
Toward the end, the play does become a
bit more bearable, probably because by
then the audience is eager to see the
Plaids go back to the Land of the Dead.
The play does allow some audience
involvement, but again the humor is di
rected toward an older audience and in
stead of bursting with laughter, students
may be bursting to get out. The show
may be something to do if you are in
credibly bored one night (even on week
days a single ticket is $24), but it is quite
a bit of money to spend an hour and a
half listening to such creative and excit-

Say cheese for the audience.
