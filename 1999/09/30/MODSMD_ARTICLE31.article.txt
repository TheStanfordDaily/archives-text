## 'Soap' duds 
### 
£ "W" iquid Soap!," a live in
teractive soap opera
M the Eureka The
atre in San Francisco, will stage
its last episode this Friday at
10:30 p.m. While the soap's cre
ators had the best of intentions
in conceiving this hour-long im
provised soap opera, their exe
cution is, at best, inconsistent.
Set in the fictional town of
Buttercup, "Liquid Soap!" fol
lows the story of about 15 char
acters, played, confusingly
enough, by only nine actors.
The characters endure all of the
trials and tribulations typically
encountered in the average day
time soap — burning buildings,
burning affairs, lies, deceit and
love gone awry. This soap, how
ever, is unique for two reasons:
improvisation and audience
participation.
Overall, the actors' lmprovi
sational skills are adequate. Un
fortunately, their energy is often

low, and the show's pacing is
thus slow. Moreover, it is consis
tently unclear whether the ac
tors are portraying a straight
forward soap-opera or a soap
opera spoof. The actors fail to
fully invest in character and plot
work, instead settling for mere
dramatic flair. As a result, the
show's plots become overly trite
while the actors' comedic ef
forts fall flat.
The actors vacillate chaoti
cally between slapstick spoof
and poor attempts at heartfelt
drama. If they were to commit
to one choice and run with it,
their energy would double, and
the show would blossom. In
stead, they flounder in limbo.
Of course, the show isn't bor
ing; it even features some in
credibly amusing moments. Ac
tors Jill Paiz and John Remak
demonstrate unique talent. In
fact, the show's most uproarious
moment occurred when Paiz

slinkily sang an impromptu
night-club number entitled
"Rubber Chicken," which, iron
ically enough, would be an in
credibly unlikely occurrence
during the average day-time
soap.
Sadly, the audience's ideas
don't lift the show to new
heights; instead, they further re
duce plot and character devel
opment to the lowest common
denominator. Whenever the
emcee invited participation
from the audience, someone
would holler "incest" or "shoe
fetish" or "eveiyone likes to
pick their nose."
As such, not only were the
actors trying desperately to
make this thing work, they had
to pick a cousin's nose with their
shoe at the same time... ard

that is not an exaggeration.
Somehow, either the audience's
participation needs to be fil
tered for intelligence and cre
ativity, or the actors need to
compensate for poor choices by
the audience, or the show needs

to allow itself to become a no
holds-barred, fetish-obsessed
spectacle. Right now, neither
the show, its cast nor its audi
ence can decide what it wants.
