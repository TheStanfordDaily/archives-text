'Mystery, Alaska*
Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds
118 minutes
Rated R

I have always been a fan of small-town
quirks. I regularly watched the can
celled David E. Kelley program
"Picket Fences," and I laughed through
out the "Northern Exposure" series. I also
love the excitement and thrills in sports
films like "Hoosiers," "Field of Dreams"
and even "The Mighty Ducks."
But something has gone awry with Jay
Roach's "Mystery, Alaska," a film about
the attempt of a tiny hockey town to up
stage the revered New York Rangers in a
showdown on the ice.
There really is nothing wrong with this
film — rather, it's the sensation that the
movie has worn through these grooves
many times before. The number of zany
characters are too numerous to list, as one
might expect with a sports film where each
person will eventually play a role in the
final game. One who does stand out, John
Biebe (Russell Crowe), is actually the
calmest and most controlled. Perhaps that
says something about stereotyping every
one into an exaggerated personality niche.
A multitude of plot elements are pre
sented to fill the time between the intra

duction of the tiny town and the end of the
hockey game. I didn't care for the use of
dirty language from children: I likewise
felt that the abundance of sex between
heat-seeking Mystery natives was out of
plaoe and unnecessary. I think that partic
ular incidents involving premature ejacu
lation and child profanity are geared to
ward the younger audience who have em
braced "Austin Powers" and its sequel,
both directed by Roach.
Sports enthusiasts may be disappoint
ed by the film's buildup to the climactic
game. Too many side elements, like trou
bled marriages, corporate invasion and
premarital sex, clutter the heart of this
film. The focus should be more on the ef
fects of the professional sports invasion on
the town, or the importance of the weekly
Mystery hockey game on the town's psy
che.
A host of name actors, like Burt
Reynolds, Hank Azaria, Lolita Davi
dovich and Ron FJdard, try their best to
work with the material. But when the
script is banal, there's not much one can
do. Roach, a Stanford graduate, should

know better than to direct a boring sports
movie. I can see that Kelley may have
been trying to use his experience with
"Picket Fences" 1 in order to give "Mystery,
Alaska" some memorable characters.
But the truth is that TV is different
from cinema. Television allows characters
to grow on a weekly basis, whereas films

only give you roughly an hour to establish
the individuals. "Mystery, Alaska" brush
es over the cast in an attempt to give you
sports, oomedy, sex, violence, suspense
and drama all in one package. But this is
one package you shouldn't even open.
