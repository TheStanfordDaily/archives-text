# 'Double' your boredom, 'double' your flaws
## Movies Murder-revenge plot doesn't make sense 
### 
What would happen if
someone was con
victed of murdering
her husband and later found out
that he was alive and well, living
together with the nanny and the
couple's son? According to
"Double Jeopardy," the wrong
fully convicted would now have
a license to kill her husband (for
real this time) without having to
face charges again. After all, a
person cannot be convicted for
the same crime twice.
That is the basic premise for
"Double Jeopardy" in which
Elizabeth Parsons (Ashley
Judd) is sent to prison for the
murder of her husband Nick
(Bruce Greenwood), whose
body has never been recovered.
As soon as she gets out on pa
role, she's on a mission to win
back her son Matty. Elizabeth's
parole officer (Tommy Lee
Jones) is the only one standing
in her way as she goes on her
cross-country search.

'Double Jeopardy'
Tommy Lee Jones, Ashley Judd
105 minutes
Rated R
Sound exciting? Well, it's
not. The entire film just lacks
the emotion that one would ex
pect given Nick's betrayal of
Elizabeth. She has no desire to
get even, and she's not even in
terested in proving her inno
cence. As if that's not enough,
Elizabeth's character is also stu
pid. Instead of tipping off the
police when she discovers that
Nick is still alive, she does noth
ing and earns herself another
five years in prison.
The entire plot not only lacks
excitement, it's also totally
transparent. Anyone who's
ever watched a crime show on
television will immediately see
how flawed this script really is.

After all, isn't one of the most
basic rules of a murder case that
there is no murder without a
body? The other reason it
doesn't work is that it could
have ended at so many other
points in time. The actual end
ing is one of the most disap
pointing I have seen in a while.
The only thing saving the
film is Tommy Lee Jones' dry
sense of humor. Like in"The
Fugitive" and "US Marshals,"
he's once again in charge of
hunting down an innocent per
son who has supposedly com
mitted homicide. Only this
time, he's never really close to
catching his suspect, and he's
just trudging along cracking a
joke here and there. While
there are some mildly interest
ing action sequences, don't ex
pect anything really big to hap
pen.
Judd does a good job of
being entirely focused on her
son. Her character is never

angry, just desperate and very
driven to succeed. 1 really would
have liked to see her character
act on some of the audience's
desires. For example, the entire
audience was drooling at the
thought of seeing her shoot
Nick in Times Square in front of
thousands of people and then
getting away with it. thanks to

double jeopardy. This scene
alone could have made this film
memorable.
"Double Jeopardy" is not
bad enough to avoid altogether,
but my recommendation is to
see this one on video.
