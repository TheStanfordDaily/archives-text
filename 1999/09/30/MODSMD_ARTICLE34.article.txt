# Another Holocaust comedy comes your way
## Robin Williams is certainly no Roberto Benigni 
### 
If you've seen "Life Is Beautiful,"
don't bother with "Jakob the
Liar" â€” it suffers from comparison
with Roberto Benigni's brilliant WWII
masterpiece.
A slow-moving and structurally uno
riginal film, "Jakob" tells the story of
Jakob (Robin Williams), a man in a Jew
ish ghetto who, during the war, adopts a
young girl and hides her from the
Gestapo in an unnamed Polish city. As
the Jews starve and labor in a seemingly
endless hell, Jakob brings hope to both
the little girl and to the rest of the ghetto
by pretending that he has a (highly ille
gal) radio which brings news of the Russ
ian troops advancing toward their city.
Every day, Jakob tells of the news he has
heard, risking his life in order to keep
the people full of hope.
The tone of "Jakob" is dim, and it is
difficult to leave the film with a deep
emotional impression. Past WWII clas
sics have already shown the importance
of hope and humor during crisis. On its
own, "Jakob" may have shown brighter
without the mass of similar material al
ready released.
To give the film credit, "Jakob" does
have a powerful ending, thanks to
Williams' moving performance as the
main character. Williams does an excel
lent job of portraying the unspoken
thoughts that are running through his
head as he inspires his neighbors to be
lieve in an end to this way of life.

The subtle quality in Williams' ex
pressions is interrupted by an annoying
dialogue that he continually has with a
photograph of his dead wife, which re
minds the audience that this is a film and
that the directors do not have enough
faith in Williams to carry out the drama
without extraneous explanation. If the
audience had some sort of background
information about this wife, it would be

a more effective means of plot explana
tion. However, there is no reason to
throw her in, and it becomes clear that
the directors are making an overly con
certed effort to pull heavily on our heart
strings.
Other aspects of the film have this
forced feel as well. For example, Jakob is
the owner of a potato pancake restau
rant in a town without potatoes (which

'Jakob the Liar'

we are reminded of about 10 times), and
the little girl living in his attic looks iden
tical to Anne Frank. Details like this in
sult the audience's ability to pick up on
subtlety, and make the film less pleasant
in general.
In terms of cinematography, the film
is dull due to the lack of creativity and
variety in scenery, lighting, and framing.
"Jakob" is perhaps better off this way,
however, because life in the ghetto is in
fact dull and does lack these things. The
creativity is hidden from the audience in
the film as it is from the townspeople by
Jakob's character, and there is truly a
sense of self-sacrifice for the greater
good that is moving in itself.
There is a good and worthy effort put
out in the making of "Jakob," but the
film falls short of deserving a full thumbs
up. It is a shame that Williams' talent is
muddled by a story weaker than his per
formance. If you have never seen "Life
Is Beautiful," this may be worth seeing,
but it is difficult to watch "Jakob" and
not constantly think of parallels to the
stronger of the two films.

Did he just yell, "No soup for you!"?
