## Jammin' with the Big Wu Interview with Jason Fladager, guitar and vocalist for the Big Wu Cover 
### Ryan Blitstein Contributing writer 
After over two and a half years of playing every
Wednesday evening at a small club called the
Cabooze, Minneapolis natives the Big Wu em
barked on their first national tour this June. Their just
released "Tracking Buffalo Through The Bathtub" high
lights the group's diverse influences, sharp songwriting
skills and tight jamming.
They play tonight, Thursday, Sep. 30, at the Last Day
Saloon in San Francisco at 9:30 p.m. We caught up with
guitarist and vocalist Jason Fladager to talk about the
music and history of the Big Wu.
Intermission: First of all, thanks for taking the time to
speak with Intermission. How's the tour going?
Jason: The tour is going really well. We've been playing
some very good shows. Last night was a surprise in
Phoenix, a sellout at the Mason Jar. We're just havin' a
good time.
I: Let's start by talking about the songs. Pretty different
than a lot of "jam" bands. Definitely different than what
1 expected.
JF: Really? What did you expect?
I: Something either much more eclectic or much more
standard. The album was an intriguingly pleasing mix.
Some upbeat bluegrass, some old-school Dead ballads,
then stuff like "Kangaroo," which you might call a great
children's song.
JF: Yeah, it's a great kid's tune.
I: Who does most of the writing?
JF: We all kind of collectively write together. Chris
Castino, our lead guitar player, has written a lot. He's
written "Red Sky" and "Kangaroo" and some of the
ones that get requested more often. But everybody defi
nitely contributes and has their own songs which they
sing as well as write.
1: Even the drummer has songs?
JF: The drummer is one of our primary vocalists. He's
written quite a bit of the songs as well.
I: With all of your different influences in the group, is
there ever a time when someone brings a song to the
group and says "Here, let's do this,' 1 and everyone's like
"Well, that's not our style, that's not our sound?"
JF: If somebody comes up with an idea, we work on that
idea until it comes to form. So far, everything that we've
been creating has been recorded and people like it. It's
kind of like a train of thought that keeps filling out.
I: When you guys are jamming at a show, do have anyone
who leads the jams, or is it more of a group thing?
JF: Everybody kind of takes turns. I don't know what the
collective "it" is, but we're all, I think, working toward
that. It's a big listening thing. You just listen to one an
other as best you can and then play that way.

I: What is the band's approach to jamming? Do you prac
tice jamming? Or do you just kind of "do it?"
JF: Well, there are a lot of great musicians out there.
And I wouldn't say that we're "top-notch" musicians,
but we do have a lot of our own sort of talents and skills
that we try and play as hard as we can. I guess that's the
best way to say it. We're playing what we're feeling. Kind
of like the Steely Dan tune. I guess the less you think
about what you're doing, the better it comes off. That's
kind of the whole idea.
I: So that's kind of the goal for you guys? To not think
about it, to make it second nature?
JF: Yeah, not think about it but feel it. You sort of feel
what's going on and go with that. Rather than, "Well, I
gotta play a minor scale here" or something like that.
I: How many years had you been playing guitar before
you joined the band?
JF: I used to play in high school, maybe 15 years ago. I
guess that'd be junior high. But like heavy metal bands
and speed metal cover bands, stuff like that. Everybody
has come from a variety of influences. It's just a weird
collective.
I: It's kind of interesting that you're all so different musi
cally.
JF: Yeah, like our bass player. He was way into stuff like
Frank Zappa, even Kiss.
I: What were you into originally? Was it mostly that
speed-metal type stuff?
JF: I was in an early-mid '80s glam-rock phase. I was into
Poison. I must have over a hundred T-shirts from all of
those bands.
I: The stuff that you're playing now is quite a departure
from that style of music.
JF: Well, I got to college and when people get to college
they discover things. And I discovered new, cool music
called "The Dead." And I had no idea what it was. I
thought it was just scary stuff, but it turned out to be
something that I was pretty into, at that time anyway.
And 1 guess that's where a lot of my influences came
from, that period of discovering that band.
I: Who do you listen to now? Do you get to listen to a lot
of music out on the road?
JF: We listen to just about everything, from the radio to
Bill Monroe — we listen to him a lot —, John Coltrane,
Dave Brubeck, stuff like that.
I: Do you prefer the acoustic or the electric?
JF: I guess I don't really have a preference. If some
body's up there playing, and I can tell that they're really
into it, and they're putting all their heart and soul into it
and they're not just shaking their ass at me, or giving me
some kind of a vaudeville act. I just want to see some
body up there who I can actually tell they're feeling what
they're playing and it's coming out. That's all that mat
ters to me. I don't care what kind of instrument they're

playing.
I: You're just putting out "Tracking Buffalo Through
The Bathtub," a re-release of your independent record
ing. And you're also putting out a new album?
JF: Well, "Tracking" is being re-released I think in a cou
ple days. And inside of it will be a live CD that we record
ed at Harmony Park, at an event called The Big Wu Fam
ily Reunion. It's a nice event, and it was captured pretty
well. It think it sounds good.
I: What do you think about being compared to other
bands like the Dead, or current bands like moe. or Phish?
JF: Well, I really don't care. I mean, they're all great
bands. They have their thing and we have our thing. 1
think we write some pretty good songs, and hopefully
people pick up on that.
I: You do covers along with your own songs as well,
though.
JF: Sometimes. Usually when we're out on the road play
ing, we like to give the audience our material, give 'em
what we do. But when we're at home — sometimes we
play a lot at home in Minneapolis — we like to shake
things up and throw in an odd cover here and there. We
used to do a lot more, but now it's mostly originals.
I: How long are the shows?
JF: We've done shows that have been 20 minutes, and
shows that have been four hours. We have enough mate
rial to do whatever somebody needs. Or whatever we
want.
I: Is there one show where you really felt like it all came
together, a show that really typifies the Big Wu?
JF: Well, the Harmony Park show that I mentioned be
fore. It's beautiful. It's like the music garden of southern
Minnesota. Most of our family, our fanbase, is located
there. And we all go down to this park for a weekend. It's
this huge mass bubble of energy. It's just so much fun.
We seem to play better every time we go there. I don't
know why. I think it's the people and the spirit of being
there. It's pretty fun.
I: Is that why you played at the Cabooze every week for
so long? Every other "jam" band tours the whole coun
try for years to build up a fan base. You guys stayed in the
same place for two and a half years.
JF: Simply because it was a fun time. It was a club. It was
every Wednesday. It was the thing to do. We'd have six
to seven hundred people out there having a good time.
Why would you want to leave that? Also, more impor
tantly I guess, we kind of thought of it as a laboratory.
This is the place where we go and experiment with the
people that we know, and get feedback and kind of build
our sound. You know, working with the audience.
I: What is the role of each person in the band? Do you all
have a niche?
JF: Each person takes their turn being the engineer or
the brake man. It's all just a collective thought process, I
guess. Nobody really sticks out. I think A 1 is an extreme
