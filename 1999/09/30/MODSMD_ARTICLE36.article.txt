# Cake and Jewel in the City
## Alice's Now and Zen Festival Hits Golden Gate Park Music 
### Lauren Russell Contributing writer 
It was an unusually steamy
and hot day in Golden Gate
park, and the audience shed
more and more clothes as the
day wore on at Alice's Now and
Zen music festival.
The three opening acts — Old
975, Fleming John and Scrotum
Pole — were dull to the point
that they were not even worth
listening to, boring the audience
which was anxious to hear the
main attractions.
Everything woke up when
Cake came on stage, and the
lethargy dwindled as the crowds
began to dance and groove to
the unique, chill sound of Cake.
The band did not sound as good

live as they do on record, but
they were still the highlight of
the day. Despite their lack of
stage presence and a rather
muddled sound quality, every
one there seemed to be enjoying
the performance. Most of the
sound problems were due to the
fact that it was difficult to hear
the acoustic guitar, tambourines
and horn over the much louder
bass, lead guitar and micro
phone.
Lead singer John McCrea did
not perform well, and his speak
singing lacked the essence that
gives Cake their unique sound in
the studio. Luckily, most of the
audience knew the music well
enough not to notice or even
care.
Cake's new song, "Let Me

Go," sounded great and was def
initely the high point of their
performance. The group only
played for a little over an hour,
but in that time they performed
all their hits and new releases, as
well as a couple of lesser known
album tracks.
After Cake left, the audience
near the stage changed dramati
cally from mostly college-aged
males to 12-year-old screaming
girls. Although the feeling at the
concert was that Jewel was head
lining, there was a definite mi
gration to the parking lot as soon
as she appeared.
Had the guys who left after
Cake still been there, they would
have agreed with me that the
highlight of Jewel's performance
was when she was hit in the faoe

with a trinket from the audience
(and promptly responded with
her middle finger).
Jewel has conflicting qualities
because she tries very hard to be
hard-core on stage but is essen
tially whiny and high-pitched.
She introduced one of her first
songs by saying "this is a girly
song, but that's ok, because I'm a
girrrl." The 12-year-olds
cheered.
She went on to completely for
get the words to one of her more
popular songs, and stood on
stage saying things like "I just
write 'em, I don't remember
'em" and "sing it if you know it
'cuz I don't"
Eventually, Jewel started
rocking as she moved away from
her emotional relationship
music To her credit, she sound
ed great on stage, and her per
formance was seamless despite

problems with the microphone.
Jewel can sing, play guitar and
write her own music, which are
rare qualities in the pop world
these days. She even did a signif
icant amount of improvisation,
which made her sappy lyrics
more tolerable.
Although many would define
her music as mainstream pop
crap. Jewel can definitely per
form and is not one of those mu
sicians who only sounds good on
in the studio after a significant
amount of mixing. The audience
picked up on this and seemed ec
static with her lively perfor
mance.
Overall, Now and Zen was a
great way to spend a Sunday af
ternoon. Live music is almost al
ways good, and even though the
artists all had their imperfec
tions, Now and Zen was a very
pleasant way to get a tan.
