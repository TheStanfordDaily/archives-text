## 'To Venus and Back' Tori Amos 
### 
I promised myself when I obtained
Tori Amos's latest double-album,
"To Venus and Back," that I
wouldn't succumb to the temptation of
giving it more praise than it was worth.
Now, I'm just hoping my review isn't col
ored by disappointment with her new
studio material. Her latest release is es
sentially an enjoyable and well-crafted
album, but one lacking the breathtaking
creativity and unpredictability of her
first four solo albums.
Amos wasn't expecting to do more
than throw together an album's worth of
live performances and an album's worth
of B-sides. However, she felt inspired
and jettisoned the latter in favor of an
album's worth of new material.
Nonetheless, the lack of time spent on
the album shows — most of it feels like
things we've already heard from Amos.
Each one of her albums has been a dar
ing departure from what she has done
previously — until now.
Still, this development is not necessar
ily a bad thing for new Tori fans. For all
its faults, "Venus" probably represents
Amos's career better than any of her
other albums. The first disc is similar to
her previous work, especially the darker
musical tones explored in her last two al
bums. Perhaps the groundwork she's laid
in those albums will make this new mate
rial more palatable to its intended audi
ence.
The second disc, consisting of live per
formances, represents her previous work
even more effectively. Ignoring the
temptation to make this a "greatest hits
live" disc, Amos picked only one of her
best-known songs ("Cornflake Girl")

and chose her best performances from
lesser-known material. These include
two B-sides and several album tracks
whose live versions have been notorious
among fans of Amos.
All songs are culled from her 1998
"Plugged" tour, so named because for
the first time she was backed with a full
band when necessary. All songs are ren
dered beautifully. "Bells for Her" is es
pecially notable for its live version,
which is superior to the studio version
from her second album, "Under the
Pink."
My only complaint with this disc is that
all performances are from 1998, when
Amos was more "professional" and less
personal and spontaneous. In other
words, there are no impromptu song de
viations, no cover songs and no amusing
stories about childhood piano perfor
mances in gay bars, when she was chap
eroned by her minister father. For those,
fans will still have to resort to bootlegs.
As a whole, "To Venus and Back" is a
coherent collection which, especially at
its reasonable sticker price, does not
seem like a mere attempt to get people
who want only one album to buy two.
The set seems to find Amos in a place
of comfort, in what appears to be a stable
and loving marriage. Unlike most of her
albums, "Venus" does not find her in a
personal crisis to work through via her
songs. Only "Under the Pink" is similar
in this regard as both albums de-empha
size navel-gazing introspection in favor
of external observation.
Even though most of the new songs are
narrated in the first person, they have a
distance to them in terms of time, space
or experience. Such a change might be

good — especially for an album with no
table lack of musical change — if Amos
weren't one of the best navel-gazers of
the '90s. As they stand, the songs don't
match the keen eye and incisiveness of
"Under the Pink."
This album is thus not as lyrically or
musically captivating as her previous
work, but it is certainly worthwhile. For
those who haven't heard her live, the sec
ond disc — although capturing only the
musical aspect of her performances —

makes the double-disc set worth the
price.
Still, "To Venus and Back" is not like
her previous albums, the kind you listen
to when you've had a bad day or just
want to stay in bed. Tori Amos may be in
a place of comfort and familiarity, but
her latest album feels more like a casual
acquaintance than a good friend.
