### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
Miss Sass regrets to report that
women don't masturbate
nearly as often as men. Over
9() percent of men masturbate, and many
attest to multiple sessions per week. In
contrast, only 40 to 6() percent of women
admit to trying masturbation even once.
Miss Sass knows an alarming number of
women who have never experienced the
joys of self-pleasure.
Few theories address this bizarre in
equality of the sexes, and even fewer for
mal studies have been done on the fe
male libido. Perhaps women are condi
tioned by society to experience lower
sexual drive. Physiologically, women
have lower levels of free testosterone,
the hormone that governs sexual drive,
than men do, and this hormonal differ
ence might make women less sexually
minded. But Miss Sass's favorite expla
nation asserts that women don't mastur
bate because they simply don't know
how.
Mother Nature was much kinder to
men than women when distributing gen
italia. A man's penis is phenomenally
obvious to manipulate, and men usually
learn very early how to bring themselves
to orgasm. A woman, however, is en
dowed with a clitoris, and clitoral mas
turbation is anything but straightfor
ward.
In fact, every woman masturbates dif
ferently. According to the Hite Report
(1976), 80 percent of women use hand
manipulation exclusively. Generally, the
head of the clitoris is too sensitive for di
rect manipulation, so most women tend
to focus on either the right or left side of
the shaft. The woman massages her cli
toris with circular, up-and-down, press
and-release or fast-and-slow motions,
depending on her personal taste. A
woman can also come to orgasm by stim
ulating the entire vulval area, though

this technique may take longer.
Many women enjoy the heightened
sensations induced by a vibrator. Some
who have never reached orgasm may
find that the sensation may help her to
achieve her first climax. A penis-shaped
vibrator is an effective clitoral stimula
tor and can also be inserted into the vagi
na to reach the G-spot. a sensitive region
two to three inches within the vagina on
the wall nearest the pubic bone.
Another enjoyable masturbation op
tion is the Jacuzzi tub. The woman aims
the water stream at her clitoris and sim
ply lies back to enjoy. A similar effect
can be achieved with a removable show
erhead.
Masturbation is a normal and healthy
activity, and a woman truly benefits
from regular masturbation. First of all,
there is nothing like a good masturba
tion session to reduce stress and liven up
a boring evening. A masturbating
woman safely releases sexual tension.
Masturbation allows a woman to ex
plore her sexuality and to learn what her
body responds to. Further, this knowl
edge allows a woman to instruct the men
she goes to bed with, ensuring that she
receives maximum sexual pleasure. Plus,
she saves her guy the trouble of playing
laboratory scientist.
And perhaps most importantly, mas
turbation increases the likelihood that a
woman will experience an orgasm. Ac
cording to the Kinsey studies, 10 percent
of women never reach orgasm during
coital intercourse, and another 10 per
cent climax infrequently. This is because
vaginal orgasms are much rarer than cli
toral orgasms. But if a woman knows
how to manually excite herself, she can
orgasm regularly, and she can even ex
perience multiple orgasms. Mother Na
ture reimbursed women for the trouble
of a clitoris with the ability to have mul
tiple orgasms. All women should cash in.
So, Miss Sass advises women to redis
cover their hands. Those pretty little fin
gers are good for more than typing.
