## 
### Virginia Yang Contributing writer 
An auditorium at Palo Alto's
Cubberley Community Center was
filled to capacity last night for a dis
cussion on Stanford's newly re
leased land-use proposal for the
foothills area south of Junipero
Serra Blvd.
Officials from the University,
the Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict. the Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors and several local
community groups were represent
ed at the meeting, along with many
area residents who came to express
their views on Stanford's plan.
University representatives re
leased the draft of its 10-year devel
opment plan last week.
The document proposes signifi
cant new graduate and faculty
housing units, academic facilities
and new athletic and cultural facili
ties. while setting aside more than
99 percent of the foothills as open
space.
The plan comes on the heels of
growing demands for graduate and
faculty housing. The proposal in
cludes approximately 2 million
square feet for 2.7K0 units of new
housing.
"The issue of student housing
goes beyond affordability and cost
issues. It goes to the heart of Stan
ford." said Keith Guy, director of

Housing and Dining Services.
The University's draft plan
claims that the increase in on-cam
pus housing would serve a dual pur
pose: not only would it meet the
needs of students, faculty and staff,
but it also would free up housing
for others in the Palo Alto commu
nity.
In addition to new housing, the
plans also allots land for over a mil
lion square feet of additional acad
emic space.
Included in this figure are sever
al athletic and cultural additions to
the campus, such as renovations to
Stanford Stadium, a new basketball
arena that would seat 12,(XX) fans
and a possible Palo Alto-Stanford
performing arts center.
Opinions at the meeting were
mixed, with some coming out in
support of the new developments
and many speaking out against the
draft plan, citing loss of open space
as the foremost of several objec
tions.
Members of the Graduate Stu
dent Council attended the meeting
to voice their demands for more
Univerisity housing.
Currently, graduate students are
guranteed one year of University
housing. Several claimed that many
students choose not to attend Stan
ford due to the cost of housing.
