# Land Use Plan draws criticism
## 
### Virginia Yang Contributing writer 
An auditorium at Palo Alto's
Cubberley Community Center was
filled to capacity last night for a dis
cussion on Stanford's newly re
leased land-use proposal for the
foothills area south of Junipero
Serra Blvd.
Officials from the University,
the Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict. the Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors and several local
community groups were represent
ed at the meeting, along with many
area residents who came to express
their views on Stanford's plan.
University representatives re
leased the draft of its 10-year devel
opment plan last week.
The document proposes signifi
cant new graduate and faculty
housing units, academic facilities
and new athletic and cultural facili
ties. while setting aside more than
99 percent of the foothills as open
space.
The plan comes on the heels of
growing demands for graduate and
faculty housing. The proposal in
cludes approximately 2 million
square feet for 2.7K0 units of new
housing.
"The issue of student housing
goes beyond affordability and cost
issues. It goes to the heart of Stan
ford." said Keith Guy, director of

Housing and Dining Services.
The University's draft plan
claims that the increase in on-cam
pus housing would serve a dual pur
pose: not only would it meet the
needs of students, faculty and staff,
but it also would free up housing
for others in the Palo Alto commu
nity.
In addition to new housing, the
plans also allots land for over a mil
lion square feet of additional acad
emic space.
Included in this figure are sever
al athletic and cultural additions to
the campus, such as renovations to
Stanford Stadium, a new basketball
arena that would seat 12,(XX) fans
and a possible Palo Alto-Stanford
performing arts center.
Opinions at the meeting were
mixed, with some coming out in
support of the new developments
and many speaking out against the
draft plan, citing loss of open space
as the foremost of several objec
tions.
Members of the Graduate Stu
dent Council attended the meeting
to voice their demands for more
Univerisity housing.
Currently, graduate students are
guranteed one year of University
housing. Several claimed that many
students choose not to attend Stan
ford due to the cost of housing.
Paul Hartke is a graduate stu
dent in Electrical Engineering cur
rently living in Sharon Heights in
University-subsidized housing.
"It is time to solve the problem,
and I hope that the opportunity
doesn't get lost if we let other issues
we do not agree on to derail the
whole thing," he said.
Local residents in favor of the
development plan included Stan
ford alumni and Stanford person
nel. including John Hopkins, the di
rector of marketing for the Stan
ford Men's basketball team.
Maples Pavilion currently seats
7.2(H).
"There has been demand for a
facility with increased capacity,"
Hopkins said. "There's no doubt
that we can support a 12,000 capac
ity arena."
Organizations opposed to Stan
ford's Land Use Plan also made
themselves heard at the meeting.
Representatives from the Palo
Alto Unified School District and
local parents criticized the plan for
its exclusion of a much-demanded
new public middle school on cam
pus.
They said that Palo Alto's two
existing middle schools are growing
beyond capacity and that Stanford
residents contribute approximately
500 students to the Palo Alto Uni
fied School District.
Since Stanford homeowners do
not pay utility taxes and Escondido
Village residents do not pay utility
or property tax. children of such
residents are attending middle
school at the expense of other Palo
Alto residents.
Also in opposition to the propos
al is the newly-formed Stanford
Open Space Alliance, comprised of
students, faculty, staff and local res
idents.
SOSA distributed petitions and
letters at the meeting along with in
formation flyers citing the loss of
open space, further congestion and

urban sprawl, worse traffic and de
creased air quality as reasons
against the draft.
SOSA spokesman Peter Drek
meier said that he was "disappoint
ed in Stanford's draft plan."
"The county requested Stanford
to set an academic growth bound
ary, which the University ignored,
and in the Land Use Plan extended
the core campus into the foothills,"
Drekmeier said.
In terms of compromise, Drek
meier said that SOSA would poten
tially support higher-density devel
opment of the core campus as long
as the foothills remained un
touched.
He said SOSA's primary objec
tion to the draft was the fact that
there was no permanent open
space protection.
Although the plan promises to
leave 99 percent of the land as open
space for the next 10 years, the Uni
versity still categorizes the area as
"academic reserve" open to future
development.
"We think it's time to find the
trustees' accountable.... If it were
up to the Stanford community, the
foothills would be protected,"
Drekmeier said.
A representative from the Com
mittee for Open Foothills, Denise
Day, cited the legal inadequacy of
the proposal and the need for an
academic growth boundary and a
parking space cap as flaws in the
plan.
Day said that Stanford "was not
balancing its needs with the needs
of the community."
The contentious debate over
Stanford's plan has been widely
covered in the Bay Area media,
generating flurries of articles, opin
ion pieces and letters.
In a Sept. 21 editorial. The San
Jose Mercury News criticized the
draft, writing, "Instead of offering
an anxious community peace of
mind about long-term plans, one of
the largest private landowners in
the county says, 'Trust us.' Ignoring
the advice of neighbors does not in
spire trust."
