# Italian Eatery has authenticity
## Gambardella's got the goods 
### 
For an Italian, eating at an Italian
restaurant can often be an insulting
experience. Gambardella's, how
ever, is the kind of place I can take my Ital
ian grandmother to and hear her rave
about it for days. When the restaurant is
named after its chef, you know the food
will most likely be very good.
Gambardella's is remarkably different
from the valet-only, yuppie-food restau
rants that are ail-too abundant in Palo
Alto — instead of glamour, Gambardel
la's gives you all substance with no frills.
The building is hidden from view off of El
Camino and looks like a dumpy little fam
ily diner.
Inside there is a somewhat tacky (but
very Italian) decor of hanging garlic and
hundreds of wine bottles. There is tasteful
classical music playing quietly in the back
ground, and the small room (with about
20 tables) is kept dim with candles as the
only source of lighting. The decor does
not matter, however, because Gam
bardella's is all about the food, and as
soon as the food comes it is difficult to no
tice anything else.
Care is put into every forkful of food
that is served at Gambardella's, and it is
obvious that this is not a pre-fab kind of
place. Everything at Gambardella's is cre
ated from scratch with remarkably fresh
ingredients.
Before the meal came a wonderful bas
ket of warm, crusty (focaccia) bread with
a tart sun-dried tomato spread. I tried the
simplest salad on the menu — the "Lat
tughe Miste," which was full of crisp, very
fresh greens, olives, roasted peppers,
parmesan and a light balsamic vinegar
dressing.
The appetizer, salad and soup menu at
Gambardella's is full of wonderfully au
thentic Italian creations with lots of moz
zarella, tomatoes, eggplant, mushrooms
and herbs.
After a difficult decision-making
process with ordering (the menu is full of
entrees that all look good), the two pastas
I tried were freshly made and cooked per
fectly al dente. I first tasted a small portion
of artichoke and basil ravioli, a special of
the day that had an authentic, delicately
thin shell stuffed with artichoke hearts
and caramelized onions. The basil cream
sauce was light enough to not make me
feel sick, but satisfyingly filling to create a
sense of fullness. It is rare to find ravioli
made from scratch these days, and this
was definitely a treat.
I next tried the linguine 4 Id Torinese,
which is possibly the most delicious pasta
dish I have ever eaten — linguine with
virgin olive oil, lightly toasted pine nuts,
gorgonzola cheese, fresh cream and the

perfect amount of garlic. The cream sauce
was heavy but so full of flavor that it was
difficult to stop. And for some reason
there was still room for dessert...
The wine bottles in the windows at
Gambardella's have messages from pa
trons written all over them. I read one as I
was eating that said "you MUST try the
chocolate souffle." The message a few
bottles over said, "Skip the entree if you
must, but don't miss the souffle."
Apparently, Gambardella's is famous
locally for their chocolate souffle, which
costs a hefty $8 but can feed two to three
and is worth its weight in gold as far as 1
am concerned. The souffle must be or
dered before the meal because the chef
makes each one separately as they are or
dered. It is served on a large plate with a
hearty helping of fresh sweet cream sauce
on the side, slices of strawberry and artis
tically dolloped raspberry and peach
sauces.
The souffle itself is served piping hot
out of the oven, and it has a crusty round
shell that becomes more tender and gooey
as you work into it. The sheer amount of
chocolate in the thing made me go into a
spastic fit of "mmmmm's" and "ooooh my
God's" (and earned me some question
able glances from tables nearby as well).
Gambardella's is located only five min
utes away from Stanford, but it strangely
seems to be filled with middle-aged cou
ples. This is probably because of the
price — be prepared to spend about $20
per person if you come to Gambardella's,
and more if you decide to go all the way
with appetizers and wine.
The ambience of the place is definitely
romantic, so Gambardella's is a great date
restaurant. It's also a good place to go to
remedy a dorm-food overload (and the
souffle, I've heard, is the perfect PMS
cure). If there is one restaurant I could
recommend to anyone living in the Bay
Area, it would be this one — Gambardel
la's is worth the splurge if you are on a
budget, it's worth the fat if you are count
ing calories, and it is even worth the walk
if you don't have a car.
