## Ad pounds binge drinking 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
An anti-binge drinking adver
tisement directed at college stu
dents made its first appearance
Sept. 10 in 17 major newspapers
around the country.
Endorsed by the National Asso
ciation of State Universities and
Land Grant Colleges (NASIJL
(i('). the advertisement is signed
by 113 university presidents, in
cluding each president of the Uni
versity of California branches.
The full-page advertisement
features a mock product, "Binge
Beer," with the headline "Hitting
College Campuses this Fall." The
product is marketed with such
comments as. "At Binge, we un
derstand that sometimes you just
need five or six drinks the night be
fore that big test" and "Who says
falling off a balcony is such a bad
thing?"
NASULGC, a non-profit asso
ciation supporting public higher
education, claims in its brochure
on hinge drinking that "university
and college presidents throughout
the United States identify the mis
use of alcohol as the most serious
problem facing higher education."
The association claims that the
gravity of binge drinking problems
in college is supported by recent
surveys on college drinking.
A 1997 survey of 14.521 stu
dents at 116 colleges and universi
ties produced by the Harvard
School of Public I lealth shows that
43 percent of students participate
in binge drinking, defined as hav
ing five or more drinks in succes
sion for males and four or more for
females.
The survey asserted that 3 mil
lion college students are binge
drinkers, and four out of five soror
ity and fraternity members partic

ipate in binge drinking.
In the past academic year, Stan
ford's administration has dealt
with a series of alcohol-related ac
cidents. including last October's
Phi Delt controversy, where frater
nity member Michael Howard,
then a senior, fell 20 feet off a Phi
Delt house balcony and was not
discovered until six hours after the
accident.
