## Ad pounds binge drinking 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
An anti-binge drinking adver
tisement directed at college stu
dents made its first appearance
Sept. 10 in 17 major newspapers
around the country.
Endorsed by the National Asso
ciation of State Universities and
Land Grant Colleges (NASIJL
(i('). the advertisement is signed
by 113 university presidents, in
cluding each president of the Uni
versity of California branches.
The full-page advertisement
features a mock product, "Binge
Beer," with the headline "Hitting
College Campuses this Fall." The
product is marketed with such
comments as. "At Binge, we un
derstand that sometimes you just
need five or six drinks the night be
fore that big test" and "Who says
falling off a balcony is such a bad
thing?"
NASULGC, a non-profit asso
ciation supporting public higher
education, claims in its brochure
on hinge drinking that "university
and college presidents throughout
the United States identify the mis
use of alcohol as the most serious
problem facing higher education."
The association claims that the
gravity of binge drinking problems
in college is supported by recent
surveys on college drinking.
A 1997 survey of 14.521 stu
dents at 116 colleges and universi
ties produced by the Harvard
School of Public I lealth shows that
43 percent of students participate
in binge drinking, defined as hav
ing five or more drinks in succes
sion for males and four or more for
females.
The survey asserted that 3 mil
lion college students are binge
drinkers, and four out of five soror
ity and fraternity members partic

ipate in binge drinking.
In the past academic year, Stan
ford's administration has dealt
with a series of alcohol-related ac
cidents. including last October's
Phi Delt controversy, where frater
nity member Michael Howard,
then a senior, fell 20 feet off a Phi
Delt house balcony and was not
discovered until six hours after the
accident.

fight binge drinking on college campuses. The full-page ad ran in
several major newspapers earlier this month.
every orifice of my body."
While the student stated that he
has had more excessive quantities
of alcohol on previous occasions,
he asserted that "on any given day.
different factors can cause your
body to react to alcohol in unpre
dictable ways."
The student further comments
that the University's "unspoken
policy" on alcohol is to leave the re
sponsibility up to the student. "It's
a good moderation." he said.
"1 have been much more cau
tious since my experience."
Carol Pertofsky, Director of
Health Promotion at Cowell
Health Services, believes that most
Stanford students drink responsi
bly.
In reaction to the anti-binge
drinking advertisement, Pertolsky
claims that the ad does not reflect
Stanford's approach to alcohol is
sues.
"I believe that the intent of the

ad is to educate the public and to
empower the parents to talk to
their students. However, there are
two problems: one, that it takes a
fear-tactic approach, and two, that
it does not give the students
enough credibility," she said.
Pertofsky said that Stanford sur
veys show that SO percent of Stan
ford students drink responsibly.
"The ad perpetuates the myth
that everyone binge drinks; it im
plies that students are not con
cerned about the serious conse
quences of alcohol misuse," she
added.
Asa member of the University's
alcohol advisory board, Pertofsky
works to develop an educational
approach lo alcohol- related issues.
She claims that Stanford takes a
proactive role by training residen
tial staff, working with athletes and
trying lo establish a knowledge
base on alcohol for students.
"The advertisement compro
mises what we are trying to do,
which is to empower students with
knowledge and to give them re
sponsibility," Pertofsky said.
