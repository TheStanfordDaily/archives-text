## Russian airstrikes continue Refugees fear bombs aimed at mainly civilian areas 
### 
SLEPTSOVSKAYA. Russia (AP) — Despite Rus
sian claims that a week of airstrikes on breakaway
Chechnya are aimed at routing Islamic rebels, refugees
fleeing the bombing Wednesday said that mainly civil
ians are being hit.
Some 61.000 Chechens have fled the bombing for
the neighboring republic of Ingushetia, and thousands
more were headed for other regions, prompting fears
of a humanitarian crisis.
Wednesday's airstrikes hit communications centers,
ammunition depots and oil and industrial facilities, the
Russian Defense Ministry said.
It was the seventh day of strikes on the capital of
Grozny and its outskirts; in all. Russia has launched
300 air sorties against Chechnya since Sept. 20. Air
Force Commander-inNfithief Col. (icn. Anatoly kor
nukov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agen
cy Wednesday.
Chechen officials claimed 10 people were killed
Wednesday. The Russian Defense Ministry said all the
casualties were militants.
But refugees at a camp in Sleptsovskaya. just inside
Ingushetia from Chechnya, said the Russian bombing
iof Grozny and surrounding villages has been indis
'criminate.
"Russians are bombing peaceful villages. There
were no rebels in my village." said Rama/am Akhivev.
•45, from Samashki.
"At first. Russian planes bombed just certain tar
gets. but now they are bombing living quarters." said
Aslanbek Shamkhanov. 39, from Grozny. "Half of
Grozny has fled."
Moscow says the strikes are aimed at Chechnya
based Islamic rebels who invaded the neighboring
republic of Dagestan in August and September. The
.militants have also been blamed for a series of apart
ment explosions in Russia that killed some 300 people
in recent weeks.
The raids have fueled fears that Moscow is planning
"a massive ground operation in Chechnya, which could
"mean a repeat of the disastrous 1994-96 war when Rus
sian forces were defeated by Chechen separatists.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Wednesday

promised that Russia would "never allow a repetition
of what happened in Chechnya in 1994." but did not
rule out sending ground troops to the mountainous
republic.
"I have never said there will not be a ground oper
ation." he said.
The Interfax and I lAR l ass news agencies on
Wednesday both cited military sources as saying a
ground operation could begin soon.
Putin meanwhile gave little hope of reaching a
negotiated end to the fighting in the near future.
"The beginning of such a dialogue is possible only
when concrete results can be expected." he said,
according to Interfax. "Beginning useless negotiations
now will only give terrorists breathing time and a
chance to regroup."
As the stream of refugees deepened, officials wor
ried about looming humanitarian problems.
"The situation is horrible. The tents stand on bare
land, there are no toilets." said Tamara Deniurziyeva,
a doctor at the Sleptsovskaya camp. "Cold weather
will come, and I don't know what we'll do."
In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency said
Wednesday it is waiting for Russian permission before
it can begin aiding the refugees.
Some 2.000 refugees went east to Dagestan, Rus
sian Defense Ministry spokesman Sergei Pryganov
said Wednesday.
According to Pryganov, the situation on the border
was chaotic because the refugees were trying to enter
Dagestan at crossings near where Islamic militants
were gathered for another invasion. It was possible the
rebels would be able to infiltrate the border posing as
refugees, he said.
On Wednesday, Chechen President Asian
Maskhadov was scheduled to meet with the leader of
Dagestan, Magomedali Magomedov. But
Maskhadov's convoy was blocked at the border by
protesting Dagestanis who said the Chechen leader
should have tried to negotiate earlier.
Maskhadov has little control over Chechnya's
armed groups and has been struggling to keep his own
job under pressure by the militants to resign.
