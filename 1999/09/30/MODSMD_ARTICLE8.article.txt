### 
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Pro-Indonesia mili
tias may be planning guerrilla raids on the Australian
led international peacekeepers in devastated East
Timor, American officials said Wednesday.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said he would
raise the matter Thursday in meetings with Indonesian
military and government officials and stress that there
must be no Indonesian army involvement — or even
tacit support — for violence against the peacekeepers.
Speaking Wednesday at the Royal Australian Air
Force headquarters in Darwin, where he met with offi
cials from Australia and New Zealand and greeted sev
eral dozen troops. Cohen said there was reason for con
cern about cross-border militia attacks.
"That's one of the apprehensions we have." Cohen
said.
He is scheduled to meet with Gen. Wiranto. the
Indonesian military chief, as well as President B.J.
Habibie and Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of
Indonesia's founder and the expected next elected
president. Cohen also will meet with Indonesian
finance officials and representatives of area human
rights organizations.
A senior U.S. defense official traveling with Cohen
told reporters there are indications that pro-Indonesia
militias — numbering between 2.(M)0 and 4,(K)0 — may
be preparing to launch guerrilla raids on the Aus
tralian-led peacekeeping troops in East Timor. The
official, who spoke on condition he not be identified,
offered no other details.
Asked about the potential for militia attacks.
Marine Corps Brig. Gen. John G. Castellaw. comman
der of the U.S. forces supporting the East Timor oper
ation. told reporters he would "not speculate on that."
I le added that Australian officials had assured him they
are well prepared to defend themselves and the rest of
the peacekeeping operation.
Upon his arrival Wednesday night in Jakarta, Cohen
said that with the peacekeepers now in East Timor and
"with some stability returning there." he sees a chance
that order can be restored and relations with Indonesia
put back on track.
The Clinton administration cut off military relations
with Indonesia on Sept. 8 in response to the Indonesian
army's collusion with militia groups in attacking pro

independence civilians in F.;ist I iinor following a refer
endum there that overwhelmingly voted for indepen
dence from Indonesia. Hast Timor is a former Por
tuguese colony.
During his slop in Darwin. Cohen announced that
the Pentagon is dispatching the helicopter carrier USS
Belleau Wood to the waters off Hast limor and
increasing its satellite communications support for the
international peacekeepers there. Cohen reiterated
that no American combat troops would be sent.
At a news conference with Australian Defense Min
ister John Moore. Cohen said four heavv-lift Marine
Corps helicopters will operate from the deck of the Bel
leau Wood to ferry equipment around East l imor for
the peacekeepers. I hey also may fly to East Timor
from Darwin on the north Australian coast, a few hun
dred miles from East Timor.
"We are very pleased indeed for that expansion" of
the U.S. contribution. Moore '-.aid. Australia "could not
want for more" from the Americans, who are offering
capabilities no other country could provide, he said.
The helicopter carrier, with an 820-foot flight deck
and crew of about C XH) Marines, is loading in Okinawa
and will depart on Thursday, said Cohen spokesman
Kenneth Bacon. The ship is expected to be near East
Timor on ()ct. 6 and w ill remain in the area at least until
the end of October. Its home port is Sasebo. Japan.
Bacon said the Belleau Woods' CI 1-53 Sea Stallion
helicopters will be needed as the rainy season hits East
Timor and makes road transportation more difficult.
The United States already is providing Air Force trans
port planes to move heavy equipment to Darwin, and it
has been providing other logistical, communications
and intelligence support.
In addition, a team of about 130 Army communica
tions specialists from the 11th Signal Ciroup at Tort
Huachucha. Ariz., will arrive soon in both Darwin and
Dili, the East Timorese capital, to set up a multichan
nel. satellite-based voice and data communications sys
tem to link field units in Hast limor with command
centers there and in Darwin.
These additional forces will bring the total of U.S.
troops involved in the East Timor operation to roughly
450. There are now about 275. including nine in Hast
Timor. The rest are in Darwin.
