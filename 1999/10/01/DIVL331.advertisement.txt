Harry S. Truman Scholarships, which honor the thirty-third President
of the United States, are awarded on the basis of merit to students who are
juniors in 1999-2000, have compiled excellent academic records, and have
demonstrated outstanding potential for leadership in public service. The
Foundation defines "public service" as employment in government, public
interest organizations, research and/or education organizations, and public
service non-profit organizations such as those whose primary aim is to help
needy or disadvantaged persons or to protect the environment. Each of the
approximately 80 Truman scholarships to be awarded in 2000 covers
expenses during the senior undergraduate year and two or three years of
graduate study up to a total of $30,000.
