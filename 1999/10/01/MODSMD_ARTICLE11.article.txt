Stanford should not
sacrifice progress in
favor of open space

A I ,TI {()IJ(il I the Universi
ty's new Land Use Plan
hasn't adequately dealt with
the eoneerns of the surrounding
eomniunities, il must be recognized
that Stanford University must be
allowed to expand il it is to maintain
its status as one of the world's pre
mier aeademie institutions.
True, Stanford failed to set any
kind of growth boundary, setting a
poor precedent for its relations with
the community in the future. II the
University is to expect trust from the
residents of the Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties, it must prove to
them that it is acting in good faith.
But should the University decide
to set ;t boundary on its growth in the
future, such a proposal cannot be
completely restrictive.
I'he surrounding community must
understand that the University can
not limit itself completely. Continu
ing to remain a first-rate school
means that Stanford must continue
to grow, and this will ultimately call
for more and affordable student, fac
ulty and staff housing, as well as aea
demie buildings and offices. Sadly.
Palo Alto and other neighboring
cities do not oiler reasonable hous
ing prices for most members of the
Stanford community, and so the I Jni
versity has no other choice but to
create its own solution.
However, Stanford is not just a

greedy landlord that gives nothing
back to the surrounding areas. The
people of Palo Alto believe in pre
serving the beauty and stature of the
area in which they live, but they owe
much of this to the University.
Stanford has been more beneficial
to the surrounding area than can
ever be measured. Without it, Palo
Alto would not be the affluent center
of Silicon Valley that it has become.
In the technology sector alone, Stan
lord has had a dramatic impact upon
the economic prosperity of the entire
Bay Area.
The benefits from University
growth are therefore benefits to the
surrounding community, and a com
mon goal must be established that
will allow for this growth while pre
serving some of the natural beauty
inherent in the open land of the
foothills.
Of course, the University must
proceed wisely. Space is a preciously
finite commodity and should be used
economically. The current proposal
does an excellent job of using land
already within the core of the Uni
versity lor construction. These are
the places the University must con
tinue to look at for development
before any more expansion is done.
The University must also priori
tize its needs. Proposals for new ath
letic and cultural centers are exciting
and indicative of Stanford's standing
in those areas; they are not, however,
the primary concerns of a University
that finds its faculty, staff, and stu
dents priced out of the local housing
market with nowhere to live.
