University should reexamine
land use
Virginia Yang's article "Land I Jse Plan
draws criticism" on Sept. 30 contained an
error that deserves correction.
It is understandable how Ms. Yang and
others might think that Stanford's Draft
( ommunity Plan Ikis asked for permission
to develop only 2 million square feet dur
ing the life ol the plan. I his was the
amount that Stanford received under the
last land-use permit. I lowever, the current
plan ;isks for 2 million square feet in addi
tion to the 2780 units of housing projected.
I he total therefore will be closer to 3.5
million square feet.
I lie surrounding community has been
and is very supportive ol student housing.
Since l l >K l ) when Stanford received per
mission to build 2 million square feet, it
was a travesty that more core campus stu

dent housing was not built. Stanford Uni
versity unfortunately made the decision to
build other kinds of structures, leaving a
serious deficiency in the housing available
to students. In the 30 years as a resident of
this community I have never heard any
objections to student housing. The only
objection was to building market-rate
apartments on Ohlone field rather than
real student housing in the core campus
area. Stanford got their way on that issue.
Perhaps Stanford will consider building
student housing first before building a new
basketball stadium or a performing arts
center. It's a little like eating your spinach
first before getting to have desert. The stu
dents. especially the grad students, have
waited long enough.

Students support hospital
workers
We are writing to express our support for
the workers at the Stanford Hospital who
have been struggling sinee last March to get
a contract. While we have all heard about
the difficulties faced by the UCSF-Stanford
healthcare merger, we hope that the work
ers' right to a fair contract will not become a
casualty of this mismanaged operation.
What the workers are asking for is fair
and reasonable, and will ensure that our hos
pital will provide the best quality of patient
care possible. Furthermore, other workers
within the hospital as well as workers in other
parts of the campus already have the follow
ing:
(1) A fair, annual raise (to keep up with ris
ing costs of living in this area)
(2) Respect for seniority (in all lay-off and

transfer decisions)
(3) Security for the union
(4) The right of all workers employed direct
ly by Stanford to organize without manage
ment interference.
As students, we use the services of the
hospital and Cowcll, and we do not want to
see these services deteriorate due to staff cuts
and an unfavorable working environment.
We also believe Stanford should support the
right of workers to organize and work under
fair, livable conditions. We urge President
Casper, who sits on the Board of Directors of
the Hospital, and the Hunter Group, which is
currently being paid to manage the hospital,
to swiftly and fairly resolve this contract.
