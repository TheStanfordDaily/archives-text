# Sequel to 'Frosh' explores the senior year
## 
### Megan Knize 
C heng Song's freshman year at
Stanford began simply enough: he
moved into his Francos room, got
acquainted with his roommate and
began to adjust to his new life. But.
a tew weeks later, things changed.
In 1990 Song was one of 10
francos freshmen whose first year
became the focus of a documen
tary. "Frosh," which focuses on the
freshman experience at Stanford.
I onight, "Now and Then," a movie
that continues the story of the 10
students' Stanford careers, opens
in Palo Alto.
"Now that I look at the film, it's
like looking back at a really bad
high school yearbook photo," Song
said. "We were filmed doing a lot of
things... studying, eating, going to
parties. I tried to hide from the
cameras at parties because 1 didn't
want my parents to see me i! they
saw the movie."
The film's producers, Dan
Geller and his wife, Dayna
(ioldfine, got the idea for "Frosh"
in 1990.
"We just wanted to make a film
that was an accurate portrait of
what it's like to change... some
thing that shows students' last days
of being teenagers and their first
days of being adults," said Geller.
Geller and Goldfine began film
ing all SO students in Trancos, but
after the first quarter, they decided
to focus on a group of 10 students.
While filming, the couple lived on
the Stanford campus in a guest
room in Wilbur I fall. "Frosh" came
out in 1993 around the same time
they began work on "Now and
Then."
"(With "Now and Then'] we

wanted to take the story further
and see what was going on in peo
ple's lives their senior year," said
Geller. The emphasis of this film is
more universal and is designed to
appeal to multiple audiences, she
said.
To make the film, Geller and
Goldfine used unseen "Frosh"
footage, in addition to interviews of
the 10 students during their senior
year.
"Freshman year and senior year
were the two most stressful times of
school," Song said. "When I was a
senior, there's this one part of the
film where I'm being asked what I
want to do after I graduate. I say
that 1 want to be an investment
banker, and then I say that I want
to be in management consulting."
Song now works at an Internet
startup in San Francisco. "I look
like an idiot, and people probably
think, 'This guy doesn't know what
he's doing.'"
"This film is more useful [than
'Frosh']," Geller said. "!t covers a
broader range. People love learn
ing about that uninhibited time [in
college] and watching the playful
ness of that moment."
The film features original music
composed by Stanford graduate
Tim Westergren and sung by Talis
man. The couple is pleased with the
end result.
"It's a very optimistic film,"
Goldfine said. "Almost everyone
has a happy ending. There are ups
and downs in college, but no matter
where you come from, whatever is
sues you have to deal with, you
make it in the end."
"Frosh" is now shown on 600
campuses across the country as
part of their residential education

programs. Geller was both sur
prised and pleased by this re
sponse. He expects a similar reac
tion to "Now and Then."
"Folks tend to eat this up,"
Geller said.
Geller has worked with his wife
since 1986, when they met at Stan
ford. Geller graduated with a mas

ter's in Film Studies in 1982 and
Goldfine graduated in 1985 with a
bachelor's in Feminist Studies.
"Now and Then" premiers
tonight at the Aquarius Theater in
Palo Alto (430 Emerson Street)
and at the Lumiere Theatre in San
Francisco (California Street and
Polk).
