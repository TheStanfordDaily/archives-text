## Farm Dems to be more active 
### Sandra Upson 
Speakers from all loeal Democ
ratic offices addressed a large
turnout of students at the Stanford
Democrats' Sept. 29 "Fourth Of
July In September."
The speakers were Joe Simitian
from the Santa Clara Board of Su
pervisors; a representative for as
semblyman Ted Lempert (D-CA),
who is a Stanford Law School grad
uate; a representative of Senator
Byron Sher (D-CA), who is a Stan
ford Law professor; and a represen
tative for congresswoman Anna
Eshoo (D-CA).
According to senior Jacinto
Hernandez, a member of the Stan
ford Democrats Board, Eshoo
credits the Stanford Democrats for
being largely responsible for her
first election, and both Simitian and
Lempert still rely heavily on the
backing of the group.
"[Lempert] and [Simitian] arc
both past members of the Stanford
Democrats," said Hughes. "Several
people who were involved with the
Stanford Democrats are now in
public office and remain very sup
portive of us."
About 80 people attended the
meeting, as opposed to the antici
pated 30 to 40 students, according
to junior Bryan Hughes, director of
communications for the Stanford
Democrats.
Hughes said that the attendees
were primarily undergraduates,
and of those, most were freshmen.
"Most of the people 1 talked to
were actually activists," said senior
Jacinto Hernandez, a member of
the Stanford Democrats Board,
"and not just there for the free ice
cream."
The primary events of the meet
ing included the guest speakers, as
well as a featured Bill Bradley / Al
Gore straw poll, where each of the
approximately 60 students who
voted were given five votes each.
Bradley won the straw poll deci

sively with 168 votes to Gore's 129.
This year, a lot of emphasis will
be placed upon building member
ship, organizing debates and espe
cially upon helping people make a
more informed decision on the is
sues and candidates, according to
Hughes.
The organization intends to be
more influential and active than it
was last year.
"The club cycles through active
phases," said senior Steven
Aronowitz, a board member.
"Last year was not that stellar a
year and not a lot was going on after
November, but this year should be
a very active year.
People are already thinking
ahead to the March elections and to
the presidential race in 2000."
The upcoming year will include
a voter registration drive during fall
quarter, preparations for the March
7 election during winter quarter,
and spring quarter activities in an
ticipation of next year's presiden
tial election.
Aronowitz and Hernandez said
that the highlights of the year would
include many debate-watching par
ties as well as participation in the
state Democratic convention.
"We hope to help run the De
mocratic convention in San Jose,
and we hope to get many volun
teers to do that. Then, if we do a
good job, we can maybe send some
volunteers to help run the L.A. con
vention next year," Aronowitz said.
Hernandez emphasizes that this
should be a pivotal year for the
Stanford Democrats.
"In past years, the Stanford De
mocrats were considered a do
nothing body, whereas now it is def
initely building up into a force to be
reckoned with," said Hernandez.
Wednesday night's turnout,
noted Hughes, marks a shift from
the previous view of Stanford stu
dents as generally apathetic toward
politics. — something the Stanford
Democrats want to change.
