# Talent, record turnout for Gaieties
## 
### Deena Skolnick 
Every year, around the time of
Big Game, the Stanford campus
comes alive with a wash of rabid
anti-Cal fever. This energy seems
to find its outlet in Gaieties, which
began auditions this week.
Senior Lauren Phillips, one of
Gaieties' directors, is anticipating
an exciting year. "I was extremely
impressed with everyone who
came out," she said.
The first round of auditions
were held on Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday. Call-backs were
last night, and the cast list will be
posted this afternoon at 5 p.m. Re
hearsals are scheduled to start this
Sunday.
According to Phillips, cast mem
bers should expect to rehearse
about 20 hours a week. Of thel 10
students who tried out, director

Phillips and the rest of the directing
staff have the daunting task of
choosing 35 to become this year's
Gaieties cast.
Sophomore John Turnbull. as
sistant producer for publicity and
assistant vocal director, said th;it
this year's turnout for auditions
was the largest ever.
Senior Steven Aronowitz, who
produced last year's Gaieties, sees
the success of the previous year's
show as contributing to the si/able
number of people who auditioned
this year.
Gaieties also has a high return
rate for its participants, for exam
ple, many of the members of last
year's writing staff are writing
again this year.
The strong turnout this year and
last year is a welcome change from
Gaieties 1997, which, according to
Aronowitz, was. "not as popular as

it could have been, or perhaps as it
should have been."
Aronowitz recalls that he over
came this problem last year by
launching an extensive advertising
campaign.
"Last year we really marketed,"
he said. "We put fliers in all of the
bathrooms in the freshman
dorms."
Aronowitz said he talked to res
ident assistants during training
weekend last year, asking them to
encourage their freshmen to get in
volved.
"Last year was just an amazing
experience . . . with the effort
everyone put in, it was an almost
flawless show," Aronowitz said.

year, agreed. Alter having been in

Phillips hopes that Gaieties will be
"a raucous, wild and thoroughly
over-the-limits depiction of the
Stanford-Berkeley rivalry."
According to Phillips, the cast

members will have "energy, per
sonality. talent, superstar qualities.
.. [and the] ability to light up the
stage all the way to the back of
[Memorial Auditorium], sincc we
plan on selling out."
Phillips added, "we think that
the success of last year's show is
going to carry us into a magnificent
year, and [this year's] show will be

even better."
Even though auditions are over,
it is still possible to get involved in
the technical or musical aspects of
this year's Gaieties.
