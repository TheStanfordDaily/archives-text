## 'Protest' play's the thing for Elam 
### Nerissa Pacio 
When Drama Prof. Harry Elam
walked onto the Kresge stage last
Wednesday to teach "The Good
Life," a team-taught I-Hum course,
he kept on walking.
"I remember one time a student
asked him to stop moving in and out
of the spotlight because the student
couldn't see him, but he said he could
not just stand in one place. He is ...
always moving," said Pavo Lutoms
ki. a teaching fellow for"The Good
Life."
In addition to being in his third
year as the director of the Area One
Program. Elam also teaches under
graduate and graduate courses, co
directs the graduate program in the
Drama Department and directs the
ater productions in the surrounding
area when he can. He is already
booked this spring to direct August
Wilson's "Fences" for Theater
Works in Mountain View.
Elam's teaching style focuses on
questioning students and calling on

them to become active participants
in lectures.
In l-Hum especially, Elam hopes
to break down barriers between
teachers and students through the
discussion seminars of about 15 stu
dents. Elam also holds Thursday af
ternoon teas with his teaching fel
lows.
"While [Elam] holds his position
as the leader of the conversation and
makes sure he passes on what he
thinks is important as the day's topic,
he definitely makes a space for stu
dents to share their ideas," said
Brandi Catanese, a Drama doctoral
student and teaching assistant for
Elam's course, "Performance in
America."
Elam's academic interests lie
largely in breaking down barriers by
focusing on dramas by and about un
derrepresented minorities in the
genre of social protest theater.
"I'm really interested in the idea
that art is not just a means of enter
tainment ... and how theater works
in that way," Flam said. "So there is

a relationship between what is hap
pening in the social, cultural, political
environment, as well as what is hap
pening with performance. One is af
fected by the other, and I try to make
students aware of that dynamic."
Last spring, Elam focused on this
dynamic between social unrest and
performance art in a seminar titled
"Contemporary Ethnic Drama," in
which the selected plays featured
themes of social propoganda.
This summer, he taught a similar
"Social Protest Drama" course for
Sophomore College.
"I am African American, and I
did a piece with my scene partner on
M. Butterfly. People weren't able to
operate within their comfort zones,"
Catanese said, who took "Contem
porary Ethnic Drama." "I was un
able to say, 'Well. I'm only going to
talk about the black plays this quar
ter because that's what I under
stand.'"
Flam emphasizes that bringing
minority perspectives into the class
room is vital.

"If you're teaching, say, Shake
speare. and there is just a small mi
noritv population in the class, or if
you're teaching something that
brings up issues about women, and
there are only two women in the
class, you have to be careful how to
deal with those issues so as not to si
lence those voices in the class." 1 lam
said. " That's what makes learning.
That's why we encourage diversity in
the classroom."
Elam's schedule is also lull of ac
tivities. appointments and classes for
different departments on campus.
Elam is also coordinating a confer
ence put on by the Black ( ommittcc
of Performing Arts which will he
held Oct. N-10. Its focus will be on
black performance and culture.
"He is the classic absent-minded
professor." said Ron Davies. the
Drama Department's administrator.
"He often doublebooks and is late to
his appointments. But that is because
he t ills his schedule and is always will
ing to talk to everyone. That is the
nature of who he is."
