For many transfer students
around the country, the transition
into a new college community can
be a struggle. But sometimes Stan
lord transfers can he a different
breed. Sophomore Patrick Croset
to, after spending only two weeks
on campus, was elected president
of Toyon I fall.
C roset to left Harvard primarily
because the social life was not what
he imagined. "Stanford is so much
better," he said. "The people actu
ally smile when they are going
places and parties actually happen
on a regular basis."
This year's numbers
This year, 3.002 students applied
as transfers to Stanford and only 29
were accepted. Of those, only 21
matriculated. The number of in
coming transfer students is usually
about KM), but as Robert Kinnally,
dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions explains, that was not possible
for the fall of 1999.
"This year we found ourselves
laced with an increase in the yield
d 1 first year students and a limited
amount of housing, so the only way
we could manage the number[s]
was to limit the number of trans
fers." he said.
"We will likely return to admit
ting around 100 transfers next
year," he added.
Social reasons
Mesut Koc. a coterminal student
in Electrical Engineering, who
came from the University of Michi
gan. 1 le feels he made the right
choice by switching colleges.
"Despite what many say outside
of Stanford, I know that it's not the
classes that make Stanford special.
It's the people," he said.
Sara Madcr, a coterminal stu
dent in Slavic Studies, transferred
from the University of Oregon in
1997.
"I love it here.... Stanford has
the environment I was hoping to
find."
When asked what some com
mon reasons are that students
choose to leave a college and apply
to Stanford, Kinnally said, "Many
[students] have discovered their

true intellectual passion at another
college and want to work it out in
the midst of the fantastic resources
at Stanford."
Intellectual pursuits may be an
important factor, but many trans
fers mention the poor social atmos
phere of other institutions as a crit
ical problem. Senior Ben Allen
transferred from Wabash College
— a small, all-male college in Craw
fordsville, Indiana in 1997. "Social
ly, you cannot even compare the
two schools." he said.
Resources available
Specific advising and support
services are available to meet the
needs of transfer students. Con
tacts over the summer assist the stu
dents with details such as transfer
credits, general education and
graduation requirements.
Susan Zare is the coordinator of
Transfer Academic Advising. Zare
said that two of the biggest chal
lenges for incoming transfers are
the "lack of pre-registration for
classes and adjusting to the pace of
the quarter system."
When Allen first arrived on
campus, he thought he did not need
to utilize all of the support re
sources available because he al
ready knew what college was like.
That is "frustrating" in retro
spect, he said, "because I did not
know what I was missing out on."
In order to prevent future transfers
from ignoring similar opportuni
ties, Allen, now an HAA in Casa
Zapata, hopes to implement a pro
gram that will provide transfers
with the assistance and advising
they need without making them
feel like they are seeking special
support.

Many are doing just that. In fact,
not only are these students taking
the initiative to meet people and
find their place at Stanford, they
are also becoming campus leaders
like Crosetto, Allen and Koc.
As Allen put it. "Lots of transfer
students go through hell and high
water before they find their niche
here, but they usually come out
tougher than nails."
