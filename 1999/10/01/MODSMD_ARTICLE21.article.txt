# Help! I'm undeclared and the clock is ticking

As a number of students enter
their junior year at Stanford unde
clared. major declaration becomes
a significant decision necessary to
avoid the loss of student privileges.
Dandre DeSandies, Assoc. Di
rector of Undergraduate Advising,
says that declaring a major before
the end of the sophomore year is an
important part of the academic
process. With declaration a lairly
easy task, said DeSandies, students
should be ready to make the deci
sion.
"To get into a department at the
end of the second year makes sense
for students because it allows them
to get to know the faculty and be
come enveloped in the department
in which they choose to specialize,"
he said.
But some students just aren I
ready, and for Joe Dußray, a senior

majoring in Human Biology, the
decision was not so easy.
"I wasn't sure about Hum Bio,"
said Dußray. "and I wanted to look
around before I went through the
declaration process."
So. Dußray entered his junior
year undeclared, and the Regis
trar's office quickly took action.
Margaret DeLaCruz, manager
of Registration and Records, said
the registrar's treatment of unde
clared juniors is aimed at "making
students declare a major by the
time they enter their third year."
Upon entering junior year un
declared. a student is notified by e
mail on the first hold deadline of
what steps they must take to de
clare a major in each department.
The e-mail also states that if stu
dents do not declare, they will have
their registration canceled for win
ter quarter. In the fall quarter, this
occurs on Oct. K. Another e-mail is
sent on Nov. S if a major is not de

clarcd.
If students remain undeclared
by Jan. 3 of winter quarter, their
registration is put on hold.
They then have 11 days to de
clare until their registration is can
celed on Jan. 14. This cancellation
entails the loss of all student privi
leges.
For undecided students, like
Dußray was. one solution to their
uncertainty is to declare a •"phan
tom" major.
These are majors that have no
declaration requirements, such as
History, and though students may
not be interested in majoring in
their declared "phantom" major,
these majors do provide a stay ol
execution for undecided students.
DeLaCruz, however, feels that
students are provided with suffi
cient resources to decide on a
major. With advisors and easily ac
cessible- information on the Web,
DeLaCruz feels that students

"have plenty of time" to meet the
deadline.
DeSandies also opposes the
idea of "phantom" majors, arguing
that il is better to get to know a de
partment in order to fully take ad
vantage of a major.
Kevin Chen, a senior majoring
in public policy, disagrees. Chen
had difficulty in deciding on his
major and often thought of chang
ing 11is major after he declared.
"By sophomore year." he said,
"not evervone knows what they
want to major in.and I don't think
that major declaration should be
such a big deal."
I)ußiay. on the other hand, snicl
that the major declaration process
gave him adequate time to prepare
during his junior year.
"It's not a bad thing." he s;iid of
the declaration process, "but I
think that the University should
prepare people more for the
deadline."
