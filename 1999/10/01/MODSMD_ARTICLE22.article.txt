### Alexander Fontana 
The Stanford Organic Commu
nity Farm held its first meeting of
the year yesterday afternoon, as
approximately 16 members — old
and new — gathered to tour the
farm and to taste the fruits of the
garden.
Despite the fact that the liarth
Systems Program is no longer of
fering credit to those who partic
ipate. the student farmers beamed
with enthusiasm as they now con
tinue' their work as an organization.
" I ry our tomatoes. They taste
like candy," said senior David
Weekly.
Although several faculty and
staff members have private plots
on the farm, it is principally a stu
dent-maintained communal gar
den. All of the leadership is provid
ed by the students.
The more experienced farmers
expressed ;i keen interest in edu
cating newcomers. " There's a lot of
experience and potential to have a
huge learning curve." said junior
Vanessa Stewart.
As the students strolled through
their garden, they discussed com
post. greenhouse propagation, dis
ease management, orchard mainte
nance and irrigation.
The farm was created three
years ago by Brian Halweil. ( lass
of 1997. In a past interview I lalweil
said that he created the self-sus
tainable farm in order to "provide
students with an environment in
which they can learn, study and
practice farming techniques in
volved in small-scale food produc

tion."
At the time of the farm's cre
ation. Halweil worked closely with
deans and faculty in the Earth Sys
tems Program.
"It was an idea that we liked. We
like sustainable agriculture, and we
like student initiative like this."
said Joan Roughgarden, the for
mer director of the Earth Systems
Program.
Julie Kennedy, the senior lec
turer and academic coordinator for

the Earth Systems Program, insist
ed that the decision not to offer
credit for farming did not indicate a
retreat from the study of sustain
able farming.
"It's taking a new and expanded
direction, hut 1 think a more acade
mic direction," said Kennedy.
In lieu of allowing students to
register for units for work on the
farm, the Earth Systems Program
plans to create a seminar on sus
tainable agriculture to be offered

next year.
Nevertheless, Pamela Matson,
the newly appointed Earth Systems
director, praised the farm. "[lt is] a
place to think about sustainable
agriculture," said Matson.
Yesterday's meeting was the
first of many open meetings that
will take place at the farm on
Thursday and Sunday at 3:15 p.m.
The farm is located along Searsville
path near the Environmental
Health and Safety Building.
