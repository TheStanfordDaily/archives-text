## Card gears up for Spartan war Stanford goes for fourth-straight win against San Jose State 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
A month ago, most Cardinal faithful were ask
ing just how bad this year's football season might
be. But now, that question has fallen away as fast as
the other contenders in the Pacific 10 Conference
race.

FOOTBALL
■ Tomorrow: Stanford (3-1) vs. San Jose State (2-
2), 2 p.m. Stanford Stadium

This Saturday, Stanford (3-1) takes a break
Irom Pac-10 play, facing the San Jose State Spar
tans (2-2).
Head coach Tyrone Willingham is quick to
point out that the Cardinals astounding success
over the last three games — three crushing victo
ries over three conference rivals, a scoring average
of 48.7 points, and a IJSA Today player of the
Week award for senior Troy Walters — by no
means assures a victory against the Spartans. Quite
the contrary, he says.
"Do we sit in a nice position being 3-0? Yes we
do." Willingham said, responding to a comment
that the Cardinal might already be through the
toughest part of its schedule. "That is an advantage,
but it is not an advantage because of who we've
played. There are some really difficult ballgames in
front of us, and the first one of those is this week
end."
The Spartans are coming off an impressive per
formance last weekend, when the team dealt Tulsa
a crushing 34-10 defeat in the team's conference

opener.
F.arlv in the game, things looked far from im
pressive for the Spartans. After San Jose State fum
bled on its own 29-yard line on its first possession.
Tulsa recovered the ball and scored a field goal
three plays later.
I hen. when the Spartans missed a field goal on
their next possession, the Golden I lurricanes em
barked on a six-play, 79-yard drive that ended on a
19-yard touchdown run. With just more than five
minutes past in the game, 1 ulsa was already win
ning 10-0.
But on the next drive, the Spartans were able to
answer with a monstrous drive of its own. needing
only eight plays to take the ball 93 yards for a touch
down.
I hen, a field goal at the end of the first quarter
tied the game, from there, the Spartans continued
to roll, holding Tulsa scoreless through the rest of
the game and scoring three more touchdowns and
a field goal.
The win highlighted San Jose State's most po
tent weapon: junior running back Deonee Whitak
er. Last week. Whitaker rushed for 123 yards and
scored his 10th touchdown of the season before he
left the game in the fourth quarter due to a sprained
ankle.
The sprained ankle might keep him out of Sat
urday's game, a development that would be tragic
for San Jose State hut would be a welcome respite
for the Cardinal defense.
Whitaker. who returns kickoffs as well as serv -
ing as a running back, leads the NCAA in all-pur
pose yards with 893. St) far this season, he is aver
aging 223.25 yards per game.

Whitaker also ranks second in the NCAA in
scoring (15.5 points per game) and kickoff returns
(42.4 yards per return) and fourth in rushing yards
(156.75 yards per game).
"1 Ic is probably one of the outstanding players
in. if not the West ( oast, the country," Willingham
said.
But will he face the Cardinal?
"I don't mean to make a comment on his med
ical situation, but I think he'll plav." he said. "The
young man has proven with his performance in
previous hallgames that he is a competitor. So 1
think lie looks forward to challenge, and he'll try to
play."
On the Stanford side of the ball, injuries have
made the starting lineup questionable as well. In
last week's game against UCI.A, senior starting
quarterback I'odd llusak suffered a blow to the
ribs, an injury which took him out of the game in
the first quarter and has lingered throughout the
week.
In the event that llusak is out of action, junior
Joe Borchard will get the starting call, and junior
Randy Fasani will get some action as well.
lo say that Borchard played brilliantly last
week as a backup would be an understatement.
Borchard. who came off the sidelines to throw five
touchdown passes in the Cardinal's 42-32 victory
over I ( I .A. completed 15 of 19 passes for a total
ol 324 yards. He led the offense to 672 yards, in
cluding a 56 yard run late in the fourth quarter.
"Well, it gives us more confidence in Joe, the
fact that lie stepped up in a big ballgame," Willing
liam said. "It just adds to his confidence in himself
and our confidence in his ability to do things."
