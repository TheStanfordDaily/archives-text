They've got Hurricane Floyd; we
have HI Nino. They have the Charles;
we've got the Bay. They've got snow
hoards: we've got surfboards. But on
the soccer field this weekend, only
one thing matters, who's got ihe
game.

MEN'S SOCCER
â–  Today: Stanford (3-2-1) vs. Har
vard (I -3-1) 5:00 p.m. New Maloncy
Field
M Sunday: Stanford vs. Dartmouth
(1-3) 2:00 p.m. New Maloney Field

I luce competitive teams, three
frustrating preseasons, and three
heated rivalries should prove to
make an intense combination this
weekend when a color war of Cardi
nal. Crimson and Big Green takes to
New Maloney field. The Stanford
men's soccer team will be battling for
more than just the wins in this week
end's Stanford Nike Invitational, as it
looks not only to redeem their two
early losses, but also to settle the
score with two Fast ('oast teams that
have given ii problems in the past.
"The Ivy I.eague is tough compe
tition." head coach Hobby Clark said,
referring to Yale's victory this season
over last year's NCAA champions
Indiana. "(The Ivy League| is playing
consistently strong soccer. We will
have to take them one at a time."
I oniiiht Stanford (3-2-1) will face

Harvard (1-2). Last year the teams
fought into overtime, where the Car
dinal eventually came out on top.
This year Stanford welcomes five
new faces to the starting lineup after
graduating seven seniors, and Har
vard adds three after losing six, hut
the match still promises to be a close
one.
"You can't make assumptions
about the strength of a team simply
because they lost some starters from
the previous year," Fifth-year senior
captain T.K. Inbody said. "I know
our team is fust as strong, maybe
stronger than last year's squad, and
we lost very solid players."
Dartmouth (1-3) will be the sec
ond test for Stanford, as the Cardinal
meets the Big Green at 2:30 p.m. on
Sunday. According to Stanford, the
traditionally close ties between the
teams will only spur on a greater de
sire to secure a victory.
"Dartmouth, we have the utmost
respect for since their playing style is
very similar to ours," junior forward
Corey Woolfolk said. "We all know
that coach's legacy is still with the
'Big Green." so it's a challenge that
both sides are up for."
And what a legacy indeed. Clark
spent nine seasons (1985-93) as head
coach at Dartmouth, where he com
piled a record of 82-42-13. before
joining the Cardinal in 1996. It was
while at Dartmouth that Clark
earned two NCAA Region I Coach
of the Year honors and led the team
to three Ivy League titles and two
NCAA quarterfinal appearances.
"I have divided loyalties." Clark

said of his time at Dartmouth, his re
lationship with Fran O'Leary, Dart
mouth's coach, and of his son and
daughter who both attended the col
lege. "But it would be nice to beat
them." he added with a grin.
A win for Stanford would be its
first during Clark's reign on the West
Coast. In three years the team has
gone 0-2-1 against the Big Green,
making revenge all the more desir
able.
"It is always a tough match be
tween us and Dartmouth," Inbody
said. "They are very well disciplined
and organized. They work really
hard and will compete as well as any
team we'll face. I feel that if we match
their work ethic and intensity, we will
fare well."
Clark agrees that his team, now in
transition from preseason to midsea
son. has the ability to put both these
teams away.
"I don't think we've quite put our
game together yet," Clark said.
"We've had individually good per
formances and periods of good team
play, but we've got to still put the
game together from defense to mid
field and attack. We need to work as
a cohesive unit."
"This weekend's games are sim
ply must-win games for us." Wool
folk said. "We have not peaked as a
squad yet, and I think victory in these
two games will lend us tremendous
confidence as we get ready to start
conference play the following week."

couraged by its two early defeats to
Gonzaga and San Francisco, confi
dant that it can turn the losses
around. Following their 2-1 victory
over Bradley last weekend, the
men are on the upswing and hope
to keep this winning momentum.
"The beginning of our season has
been a bit rocky, but I think we have
learned a lot from each of our
games," Inbody said.
"Last year we had a very similar
record (5-2) at this point of the sea
son. so we are not worried. This
weekend will tell us a lot as to what
kind of a year we are going to make
it."
