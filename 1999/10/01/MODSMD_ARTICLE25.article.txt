## Cardinal looks to drown Bears 
### Erin Bouchier Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's water polo
team meets nemesis California this
Saturday in Berkeley in what
would appear to be a warmup be
fore November's infamous Big
Splash. But this matchup between
the No. 2 Cardinal (7-1. 1-1 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) and
the No. 6 Golden Bears (3-3,0-0) is
no warmup: it's big.

MEN'S WATER POLO
â–  Saturday: No. I Stanford (7-1. 1-1
MPSF) vs. No. 6California (3-3,0-0)

This game is significant for both
teams because it counts as one of
only eight league games. Team
records in the MPSF determine
seeding in the all-important MPSF

tournament, the w inner of which is
sent to the NCAA tourney.
While the Golden Bears have a
.500 record and are ranked only
sixth in the nation, Stanford head
coach Dante Dettamanti says that
"they're a legitimate top-four
team."
Indeed. Cal proved that it can
play with the top teams last week
end. The Bears gave No. 1 UCLA
an extremely tough fight, falling
11-V after being tied with the Bru
ins at the end of the third quarter.
Cal is a fairly young but very
deep team. "They have more left
ies than anyone else." said Detta
manti. Three of these left-handers
get a good deal of playing time,
which contributes to Cal's strong
counter attack.
Individually, the Bears arc led
by junior Jerry Smith, a two-meter

player who has scored 17 of the
Bear's points this season. Smith has
carried so much ot the scoring lo.id
that Joe Kaiser, the second-highest
scorer, has only seven points.
As a holeman. Smith doesn't
draw many ejections on his defend
ers. hut he has an incredible ability
to score from two meters. Because
he is so potent, defenses "reall\
have to focus on him," according to
Dettamanti.
Another point of focus for the
Cardinal will be Bear goalie Kevin
Ahasey. While Ahasey has racked
up 50 saves on the season, he has
had problems defending the two
point shot. Against the Bruins,
Ahasey allowed three two-point
ers. which proved the difference in
the game.
To capitalize on this weakness in
Cal's defense, Stanford has been
working on two-point shooting in
practice.
Part of the Cardinal game plan
will be to get open two-point shots
for players like senior Jon Skaalen
and redshirt sophomore Pasi Dut
ton.
Which Cardinal players will be
in against the Bears remains to be
seen. The Stanford team has been

hit by a rash of illnesses. In the past
week. Skaalen and senior Brian
Heifferon, junior Peter Osborn,
redshirt sophomore Mark Amott
and redshirt freshmen Niek F.llis
and Nathan Alldredge have all
been sick or unable to practice at
100 percent.
Consequently, other players
who usually see less time will be
counted on to step it up against the
Golden Bears. "This will be a good
test for our depth: we'll find out
how deep we really are," says Det
tamanti. However, signs that Stan
ford's depth will indeed come

through have been good; Detta
manti notes that players such as
redshirt sophomore Kendall Ben
son redshirt freshman Brian Har
row have been playing very well in
practice.
No matter who plays, it will be a
tough lest for the Cardinal, playing
at the always hostile and crowded
Spieker Pool and knowing that the
result will count toward the MPSF
record.
While it's not Big Splash, it is the
rival Golden Bears, and the Stan
lord team is bound to be up to the
challenge.
