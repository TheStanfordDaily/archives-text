There is no doubt that they have what it takes to win.
The No. 17 Stanford (5-3) women's soccer team
demonstrated dynamic flashes of perseverance, determi
nation and skill in its 8-1 win over No. 11 Richmond last
weekend, the largest margin of victory for the Cardinal
this season.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Today: No. 17 Stanford (5-3) vs. Alabama (4-5)
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Evansville

This weekend, games against unranked Alabama (4-5)
and Evansville won't necessarily test the potential of the
Stanford team, but they will serve to test (he consistency
of the Cardinal squad.
"We are trying to become more of a consistent team in
our approach to the game and the way we play," said head
coach Steve Swanson. "When you have that kind of a
game, you want to have it again and again and again."
"We've been playing really well and we had a big win
last weekend." senior co-captain Jennifer O'Sullivan said.

"This weekend we are going to try to focus on continuing
to play at that level."
Two wins this weekend would be significant to the Car
dinal on two levels. Not only would decisive wins against
out-of-region teams effectively demonstrate the strength
of the Pacific 10 Conference, but it would also give the
Cardinal momentum as it enters Pac-10 play next week
end.
"It's our last weekend before the Pac-10s," senior for
ward Kelly Adamson said. "We would like to come away
with two more wins so we can ride some confidence into
the Pac-I()s."
The Cardinal faces Alabama's Crimson Tide on Fri
day at 6 p.m. and the University of Evansvillc Aces on
Sunday at 11 a.m. at Santa Clara's Bronco Stadium.
The tournament this weekend reeks with incentive for
either opposing team hungry for an NCAA berth. Be
cause neither Alabama nor Evansville are currently
ranked, a win against Stanford could provide much need
ed national recognition in their consideration for an
NCAA berth.
"It is difficult to assess these teams because they are
not in our region," said Swanson, "but, for them, (these
games] could he a season-maker."
And these teams are no
pushovers. either. Both squads qual
ified for postseason play for the first
time last year.
Alabama (4-5) started off the sea
son with three straight wins. In its
first game of the season, the Tide
beat No. 19 Vanderbilt and climbed
into all major top-25 polls. The Crim
son Tide is led by center midfielder
Tiffany Carle, who has posted a
team-high in points with 11 goals and
four assists. The Tide will also rely on
sophomore Rachel Brown who was
named Freshman of the year last
year in the Western Division of the
Southeastern Conference.
Against Evansville, the Cardinal
will face the play of forward krissy
Meeks. a two time All-America can
didate and the second-leading scorer
in the Missouri Valley C onference
(MVC), and midfielder Jenn I.em
beck who. leads the MVC in assists.
