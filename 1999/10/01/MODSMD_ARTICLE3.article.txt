### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Motivated by concern over ongoing union
negotiations at UCSF-Stanford Hospital,
members of Stanford's Labor Action Coali
tion met yesterday with University President
Gerhard Casper to urge him to take a more
active role in the negotiations.
Coalition representatives presented
Casper with WK) letters signed by undergradu
ate students urging him to intervene on behalf
of workers in the Local 715 union, said Senior
Fli Naduris-Weissman, co-coordinator of the
coalition.
Casper, in a statement made at yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting, said that he had no
authority in the matter.
"Just because employees work at UCSF-
Stanford does not translate to any right on my
part to make any comments on the issue,"
Casper said. "The union's attempts to embroil
the University in those negotiations is both
misdirected and inappropriate."
Coalition members hoped to persuade
Casper to intervene on behalf of the Service
Employees International Union Local 715.
which is engaged in ongoing contract negotia
tions with UCSF-Stanford.
"We told Casper he could take a bigger
role advocating for workers; this would be ex

pressing what many students feel," Naduris-
Weissman said.
However, Casper said he was unable to in
tervene in the matter, said coalition members.
"Casper claims that there is nothing he can
do," said senior Brook Atherton, a member of
the labor coalition.
"Casper tried to play the role of 'mv hands
are tied, poor president,'" Naduris-Weiss
man said. "He said it was a delicate labor ne
gotiation process with a bunch of difficult
legal and financial negotiations being made
and that he cannot take a role in it."
However, coalition members did not ac
cept Casper's statement.
"Casper ison the board of directors. Yet he
said he is not able to [intervene). That doesn't
seem right to me. The Board of Directors
have lots of influence â€” that is the role they
play," Atherton said.
"Casper didn't have as big an opinion of his
power as the students did," said coalition
member Alan Kaiser, a senior.
Nevertheless, coalition members said they
were grateful to have the chance to meet with
Casper.
"Upon leaving the meeting, I was disap
pointed that President Casper felt he couldn't
do more," Kaiser said. "But I was impressed
