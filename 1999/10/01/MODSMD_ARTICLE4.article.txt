# Vigil condemns treatment of union members
## 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Last night there were lights on
the hill leading up to Hoover
House, but none on the inside.
Over I(X) hospital workers and
supporters held a candlelight vigil
outside University President Ger
hard Casper's residence to protest
an ongoing union dispute between
IJCSF-Stanford Health Care and
Local Union 715.
Ten months after organizing, the
union has not yet negotiated a con
tract with hospital management.
The vigil was held outside Hoover
House in an attempt to pressure
Casper to intervene on behalf of

union workers in contract negotia
tions.
A meeting with a similar pur
pose was held yesterday between
members of the labor coalition and
Casper. (Please see above story for
details.)
Senior Brook Atherton said the
vigil was "powerful."
"I met [demonstrators) at
Casper's house. At least 100 work
ers and students came up the hill to
ward the house singing ... The en
ergy was really high."
Junior Jennifer Wekselbaum. a
member of the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition, spoke at the vigil.
"1 think this whole situation is
about people making $500,000 and

others making $7 an hour and try
ing to make ends meet," she said.
"As students we need to raise
our voices. If we are silent, we're
not supporting a living-wage for
workers and we are supporting a
system where people who provide
absolutely necessary services are
not treated with respect." Weksel
baum said.
Senior Eli Naduris-Weissman. a
co-coordinator of Stanford Univer
sity's Labor Action Coalition, said
union members were asking for
"things any Stanford grad or stu
dent would require in a job they
were taking. These are things other
workers at the hospital already
have."

Specifically, members arc asking
for respect for seniority, security for
the union and a fair annual raise.
Naduris-Weissman said.
Linda Repetti.a unit secretary at
Lucile Salter Packard Children's
1 lospital and a vigil participant, said
it was organized to show worker
solidarity.
"We've been having a vigil and
letting Casper know that we're
here... We're sending him a mes
sage that we're here and that we're
here to stay."
1 jnda Cornell, also a unit secre
tary. said, "I feel this is a great
cause for employees. We need a
fair increase, we need others in the
hospital to have the right to orga

nize."
Workers were joined by all types
of supporters during the vigil. John
ny Gi-tar. a vigil performer, said.
"I'm fighting for justice. 1 hope that
my music would move people,
which it did tonight."
The vigil was sponsored by the
Interfaith Council on Religion.
Race. Economic and Social Justice.
"Community leaders, religious
leaders and political leaders are
watching this struggle." said Ron
Ruggiero, an organizational direc
tor for the union. "No one will rest
until there is justice at the hospital."
