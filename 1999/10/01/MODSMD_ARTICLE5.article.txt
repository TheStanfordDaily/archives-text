## 
### Juliana Liu Contributing writer 
In the wake of lour apartment
bombings in Moscow and the south
ern cities of Buinaksk and Volgo
donsk during the month of Septem
ber, Stanford in Moscow directors
are taking extra measures to ensure
student safety.
The bombings, which Russian of
ficials have blamed on Islamic mili
tants based in the breakaway
province of Chechnya, have left
some 300 people dead.
Six of the program participants
were participating in the Intensive
Russian Training Program when the
bombings began, according to pro
gram director Maxim Bratcrsky.
" The reactions of the students
were different: it ranged from inter
est to concern," Bratcrsky said.
"Nobody was scared."
Junior Erica Roedder. who had
arrived early for the language pro
gram, remembered that she had
read about the bombings in newspa
pers.
"Of course, I was concerned, but
I was more worried that we might be
sent back home like last year,"
Roedder said.
Bratersky said that all six stu
dents accepted his recommendation
to move temporarily from their
homestays to the dorm where the
Stanford program is located.
"The students lived in the well
guarded dorm within the Finance
Academy [where the program is lo
cated] after the bombings started.

and later, when the situation in the
city was under control, they re
turned to their homestays," Brater
sky said.
Assistant Director of Overseas
Studies Pam McNaughton said the
students "voted with their feet" in
choosing to stay in Moscow and to
return to their homestays.
But according to Stanford alum
na Carolyn Sleeth, who is teaching
English in St. Petersburg, not all
civilians feel the situation has im
proved.
"Despite the fact that usually,

everyday life in Russia is far re
moved from politics, the bombings
in Moscow have frightened many of
the people here." Sleeth said.
"There is a general feeling that there
is little the government can do to
stop more bombings from happen
ing."
However, even without govern
ment intervention, the program is
determined to ensure student safe
ty. Bratersky said.
"We have also adopted, as a min
imum. the safety requirement that
the buildings should have locked en

trances with intercoms or door
men." Bratersky said.
Bratersky said the program had
to relocate two students because
their host family's residences did not
meet the safety requirements.
The program cancelled one
weekend excursion and asked stu
dents to refrain from visiting public
places until the situation stabilized
Roedder said they needed to
carry their passports and visas at all
times. She said most students felt
