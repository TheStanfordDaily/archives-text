## Accident in uranium plant threatens Tokaimura, Japan 
### 
rOKAIMURA. Japan (AP) —
Japanese workers contained an
uncontrolled nuclear reaction at a
uranium processing plant yesterady,
a day after leaking radioactive gas
seriously injured three people and
possibly contaminated 40 others.
Masaru Hashimoto, governor
of Ibaraki Prefecture, said he had
received confirmation that the
reaction had been brought under
control at 6:15 a.m.
JCO. the company that runs the
plant, acknowledged blame, saying
the accident was the result of a
"clear violation" of its safety rules.
The radiation levels outside the
plant had returned to normal yes

terday morning and experts said
that they did not believe there was
a serious threat to residents.
Still, officials described the acci
dent as the most serious ever at a
nuclear facility in Japan.
And orders for more than
31 ().()()() residents within a six-mile
radius to stay inside remained in
effect, cloaking this normally busy
town and the neighboring city of
Mito in an eerie silence.
The facility, which refines ura
nium so it can be used to fuel
nuclear reactors, is located in
Tokaimura, a town of 33.0(H) peo
ple, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo.
JCO spokesman Makoto Mori

ta told The Associated Press yes
terday that workers had been mix
ing uranium with nitric acid to
make nuclear fuel, but had used
too much uranium and set off the
accidental uncontrolled reaction.
He said one of the workers is
believed to have put 35 pounds of
uranium into the tank — well over
the 4.8-pound limit.
"We have no words to express
our apologies," he said. "We can
not escape our responsibility."
JCO is owned by Sumitomo Metal
Mining Co., one of Japan's largest
business groups.
Police were investigating
whether negligence was involved.

according to Japanese news
reports.
Government officials said the
accident spewed a gas containing
alpha, beta and gamma radiation
into the atmosphere, forcing the
evacuation of 150 neighbors of the
plant.
The plant was not designed to
block the escape of radiation, com
pany officials said.
During the height of the crisis,
radioactivity levels inside the plant
had soared to 1 (),()()() times above
normal, while they had reached
about 10 times above normal 1 1/4
miles from the scene, officials said.
Experts said the levels outside

the plane were able to return to
normal levels relatively quickly
because the radiation was from
neutrons. They said that as soon as
the reaction stopped, neutrons quit
being produced and radiation level
dropped.
In Washington. President Clin
ton expressed deep concern and
offered assistance. " This is going
to be a very hard day for the peo
ple of Japan," he said.
Two of the three injured work
ers were in critical condition from
the radiation, estimated at about
4.000 times the level considered
safe for a person to receive in a
year, said hospital official Yukio

Kamakura.
There was no immediate expla
nation on how workers controlled
the reaction. Earlier yesterday, a
team removed water from the
cooling equipment around the
tank in an effort to suppress fur
ther nuclear fission. Science and
Technology Agency official Eiichi
ro Watanabe said.
Nuclear fission happens when
neutrons hit uranium, causing
atoms to split, releasing huge
amounts of energy.
It is the principle behind the
atomic bomb. Water stimulates the
neutrons, spurring along the reac
tion.
