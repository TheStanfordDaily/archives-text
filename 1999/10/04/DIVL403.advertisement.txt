EXERCISE
There are three things that
make a significant difference
to how you feel, what sicknesses
you avoid, and how much you
enjoy your life. They are: a positive
attitude, a good diet, and enough
exercise. But the question is:
What's Enough
Exercise?
For cardiovascular fitness, 20
minutes of exercise three times a
week is enough. You'll get
benefits from as little as 10
minutes a day, but any additional
time up to one hour will increase
your benefits. Health returns may
diminish beyond an hour.
Benefits of Exercise
With exercise you get:
■ More strength and flexibility
■ More ability to endure stress
■ Better sleep
■ More muscle tone, so you look
better
■ More control of your appetite
and weight
■ A valuable change of pace
■ A healthier body (increases
HDL (good) cholesterol;
lowers blood pressure)
Tailor the Exercise to
YOU
■ Experiment. See what exer-
and times of day fit
best into your routine
■ Choose something you enjoy
(or at least don't hate) so you
will DO IT
These are members of the
Stanford tennis team in the
19205. Just how much exercise
could they get in those skirts?
■ Commit to what you'll do, and
v, nen, one week at a time. Then
adjust the plan to suit your
schedule and temperament
■ Exercise with a friend (or two)
Choose One or More
■ Brisk walk
■ Dance aerobics
■ Climb stairs
■ Lift weights
Consistency is the key. Go for
gradual, steady improvement.
That's what lasts.
Stretching
Stretching is a really good thing to
do. It's easy and you can do it
almost anywhere, anytime. !i
increases your range of motion
and reduces stiffness and
Do some stretching every day,
especially before and after
exercising. Here are some tips:
■ When you stretch, do it slowly
with continuous tension on the
muscle (do not bounce)
■ Hold each stretch for a count
of 10
■ Exhale as you stretch; it
relaxes muscles even more
Key Effects of Exercise
Aerobic conditioning: Good for
your heart and lungs. Do an
exercise that raises your heart
rate (see list in center column).
To get your heart rate: exercise for
10 minutes. Then measure your
heart rate (take your pulse) for 10
seconds. Target heart rates:
V Age 20: 20-27 beats in 10
seconds
■ Age 25: 20-26 beats in 10
seconds
■ Age 30: beats in 10
seconds
Muscle Strength and Flexibility:
Gives you more energy, improves
your work and athletic ability,
and helps you feel less tired.
To quickly improve your muscle
strength, do resistance training
with rubber tubing, free weights
or weight training equipment.
You can also strengthen your:
■ Legs, with side-leg lifts
■ Abdomen, with bent knee
curl-ups
■ Shoulders, with push-ups
■ Arms, with chin-ups Q
