Thus, it might be profitable, in view of veterinary experience with scrapie, to
examine the possibility of the experimental induction of kuru in a laboratory
primate, for one might surmise that the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in
scrapie - however unusual they may be - are unlikely to be unique in the province
of animal pathology. W.J. Hadlow, The Lancet, 1959
