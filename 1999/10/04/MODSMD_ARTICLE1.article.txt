## 'We are encouraged to do our own thing, but then many students leave Stanford and don't know what to do.'

A chance meeting brought former
rapper MC Hammer to campus Sat
urday night.
Junior David Byron and doctoral
student Jesse Adams, both members
of United in Christ, a campus Christ
ian group, met MC 1 lammer in a San
Jose music store three weeks ago.
Byron said that when they suggested
speaking to Stanford students about
religious faith, MC Hammer enthusi
astically responded, "I want to do
that. Get me a pen, and I'll get you my
number."
On Oct. 2, nearly 500 students as
sembled in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
for a program Adams introduced as
"not a religious thing; it's a real thing."
As he finished his introduction, the
crowd stood in applause while rap
per-turned-evangelist MC Hammer
took the stage.
Though student expectations of
the program ranged from a rap con
cert to a profound religious experi
ence, what they got was MC Ham
mer's account of his experiences in
life and how Christianity has played a
part in helping him find his way.
The question posed in the title of
the program, "Purpose: Why am I

crowded
Dinkelspiel Au

day night. Ham
mer addressed
the role faith
has played in
his career and
life experi
ences.
Here?" was answered by MC Ham
mer, who said, "our real purpose is
Clod's purpose." This idea was played
out in his story about his career, his
personal and professional relation
ship with rapper Tupac Shakur and
his own journey in faith.
"I worked on my own purpose,"
MC Hammer said, in reference to his
career in the music industry. "Jesus
was in third or fourth position" in his
life at the time. Hammer said. "[Now]
1 know better. [That was] really
Hell."
A majority of the students present
stayed for the second half of the pro
gram, which featured Ugandan evan
gelist Eridard Mukasa.
Mukasa followed upon MC 1 Jam
mer's comments on finding a purpose
in life. He said, "it's very expensive to
learn by experience" and that the key
was to learn from "other people's ex

perience.
He stressed that "we can never dig
deep enough inside ourselves to find
our purpose." and that Christianity
was the key to finding purpose in life.
The program ended with a call for all
those accepting Jesus into their lives
to come forward to pray.
In planning this event, Byron said
he hoped that this type of program
would help deal with a problem he
often sees on campus.
"At Stanford we are encouraged
to do our own thing, but then many
students leave Stanford and don't
know what to do," he said.
Junior Peter Douglas added that
the program was, "speaking about is
sues everyone has."
United in Christ is an interdenom
inational Christian organization that
brings Christians from different cam
pus groups together to share their
messages. A program of lectures by
Christian philosophers, titled "Veri
tas Form." is planned for later this
vear.
