hospital workers deserve to work
under a lair negotiated contract
and should he entitled to the same
rights as other workers on this
campus.
What is needed is an interme

Stanford President Gerhard
Casper could therefore play a
very important role in this mat
ter. He would work not necessar
ily as an advocate for the union as
some would suggest, nor as a rep
resentative of the management's
side, but rather as a conduit
between the two.
Given Casper's high profile, his
involvement with the hospital
merger, and his position on the
UCSF-Stanford Board of Direc
tors, it seems only fitting that he
would take some role in this pro
cess. Hi ere are very few others
who have sufficient clout and the
necessary level of impartiality to
take an active part in the negotia
tions, maybe not as a representa
tive of the University but as a pri
vate citizen with a huge stake in
this issue.
But this will also require a large
degree of patience from the hospi
tal workers' union. Willi all the
massive changes that UCSF-Stan
ford is undergoing, it should be
expected that the normal process
of management-labor contract
negotiations will be severely dis
turbed. Both parties should enter
negotiations in good faith. The
swift and fair resolution of this
matter benefits not only the work
ers but all members of the Stan
lord community who make use of
the hospital's services.
