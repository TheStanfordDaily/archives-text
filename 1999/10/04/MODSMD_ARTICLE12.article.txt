Hospital officials defend
their actions
Your recent editorial (Sept. 24. I WW)
regarding allegations that a nurse at Lucilc
Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford
was responsible for the diversion of nar
cotics for her own use might have left lead
ers with the impression that the hospital was
remiss in notifying the proper authorities of
the situation. To the contrary, upon discov
ering the problem, the hospital immediately
notified the Palo Alto Police Department,
and when it was discovered that a nurse was
responsible, the hospital caused a report to
he lodged with the California State Board
;of Registered Nurses (HRN). At no time
lias the hospital attempted to keep this situ
ation from being brought to the attention of
ihe proper authorities.
• Subsequent to having notified the
•Bureau of Registered Nurses, the hospital
•was contacted by the California State
of Health Services (l)IIS),
Xvho informed the hospital that they believe
.'this was a reportable event under their reg
ulations. From the very first moment the
[hospital was contacted by the DIIS. we
have fully cooperated with the l)l IS author
ities as they have conducted their review of
the situation.
We would like to emphasi/e that the well

being and safety of our patients is our first
priority. Our ongoing review ol ihis matter
continues to affirm our initial assessment
that the nurse's activities did not result in
harm to any patients. Upon discovery, the
nurse was immediately placed on adminis
trative leave. We have subsequently
enhanced our policies and procedures to
decrease the likelihood of a similar event
occurring in the future. Drug diversion by
staff does occasionally occur in hospitals.
Fortunately, this situation is uncommon loi
ns at Lucilc Packard Children's Hospital at
Stanford.

Worker criticizes University's
handling of unions
I had to laugh when I read that President
Casper refused students' requests that he
intervene in the labor negotiations at the
hospital.
Any member of a union here at Stan
ford could have told the students that they

were doomed to failure. Members of the
unions here are viewed by the University
;is a necessary evil. The start of every con
tract negotiation has takcbacks from the
union as Stanford's first offer.
I have been here 20 years, and for 20
years the union has tried to get Stanford to
change our retirement package to include
;i matching five percent from Stanford of
;mv contributions that a union member
may make in addition to what Stanford
has set up for us. This is no different from
the matching five percents that Stanford
gives to their managers, professors, etc.
We have also tried to get our retire
ment fund to be in the same fund that
Stanford provides for non-union employ
ees. Why? Because the fund for the man
agers has a higher return rate than the
fund for union members. Each time we are
told that neither can be done because it is
just "too difficult to do." Right.
The president of the University has
never gotten involved in union negotia
tions, and he / she never will. As I said
before, we are a necessary evil, and the
University sees us as being too unimpor
tant to deal with.

Stanford Tree must play his
part
This year's Stanford Tree, when he's out
there dancing, is a worthy successor in a
long line of entertainers.
But this weekend he made two incredi
ble mistakes: being out of costume at the
women's volleyball game Friday night at
Maples Pavilion and again at the football
game Saturday.
The Tree is an actor, on stage before a
public. An actor never, ever is out of cos
tume or character on stage. Over and above
the basic wrongdoing, think of all the little
kids who adore the Tree.
At Maples, the Free walked around with
his costume hiked up over his head. At the
Stadium, he was totally out of costume, then
picked it up and walked about five rows up
in front of the students where two people
helped him put it on — which didn't happen
until near the end of the first quarter. If he
had mechanical problems, these should
have been solved offstage before he arrived.
The only time the Tree should be out of
costume is if the dirty Golden Bears rip it off.
We are three generations of Stanford
alumni, and we are not amused.
