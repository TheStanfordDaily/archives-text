## Investigation of nuclear accident launched

TOKAIMIJRA, Japan (AP) â€”
The government launched a full
scale investigation Sunday into the
cause of Japan's worst nuclear disas
ter, while more questions arose
about safety measures used at the
site.
Workers at the uranium-process
ing plant in Tokaimura, a town of
33,(XX) people about 70 miles north
east of Tokyo, had been ignoring
legally binding procedures for four
years, local news media reported,
quoting company officials.
To determine if this was true, the
Science and Technology Agency,
which oversees the country's nuclear
program, began questioning officials
of the plant's operator. JCO Co.,
agency spokesman Ken Maruoka
said.
The accident occurred Thursday
after workers mistakenly put too
much uranium into a bucket-like
container, setting off an uncon
trolled atomic reaction that contin
ued for hours, spurting radioactive
particles into the air.
Instead of relying on the high
tech equipment expected at a nucle
ar facility, the workers had been
manually pouring the potentially
deadly material, company officials
said. Japanese media reports also
said the workers had never received
proper training.
One of the employees, Hisashi
Ouehi, was found to have been
exposed to about 17,(XX) times the
normal annual exposure to radia
tion.
"It is a lethal dose," said Dr.
Kazuhiko Maekawa, one of the

physicians treating Ouchi at Tokyo
University I iospital.
Maekawa said the next few days
will be critical. He said doctors have
decided that Ouchi will receive a
transplant of blood stem cells to help
restore his white blood cell count
and prevent him from losing the
function of his bone marrow, which
is keenly sensitive to radiation expo
sure.
The government says 49 people
were exposed to the radiation,
although Ouchi and two other plant
workers were the only ones hospital
ized.
Doctors are considering a trans
plant of blood stem cells for another
of the workers as well, said Saburo
Tojo, a spokesman for the National
Institute of Radiological Sciences
spokesman.
Officials reiterated their promise
to get to the bottom of what hap
pened, amid public anger over how
such a potentially devastating acci
dent could have occurred.
Prime Minister Kei/o Obuehi
said Sunday that he had instructed
Science Agency officials to conduct
a strict investigation.
"I heard the accident was caused
by the way the company ran their
operations with little regard for safe
ty. I think that's unforgivable."
Obuehi was quoted as saying by
Kyodo News agency.
Police also have begun investigat
ing whether JCO was negligent.
Officials said they will seek criminal
charges against JCO, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Sumitomo
Metal Mininu Co.
