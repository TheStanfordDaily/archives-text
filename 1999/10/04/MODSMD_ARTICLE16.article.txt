DILI, East Timor (AP) — Mili
tiamen nabbed Manuel Pinto's
three brothers as soon as they ven
tured back into East Timor's capi
tal, alter they were lulled into false
sense of security by a radio report
that the international peace force
had arrived.
Now, two weeks into the peace
mission, the skinny 25-year-old
scouts Dili for his mother, father
and five sisters still hiding in the
mountains.
living on mangoes and cassava,
they are going hungry but playing it
safe.
" They're still afraid. There's just
a few people here," Pinto says, ges
turing at the city around him. Fam
ilies line up for handouts of rice
from Australian soldiers at a sports
stadium, but other parts of the city
remain deserted.
Thousands of people have
returned to Dili since the peace
keepers arrived and established
some order to the chaos of the
destroyed capital. Hut thousands
more are still waiting, refusing to
believe the militia are truly gone.
The majority of East Timor's
K.SO.(XK) people are still displaced,
lost for now to their families.
Indonesian soldiers and their
militia allies burned and chased
hundreds of thousands out of their
homes into the hills; an estimated
230,(XX) are believed held by mili
tias in Indonesian West Timor.
Pinto, an amiable, voluble stu
dent in animal husbandry, has fam
ily scattered in all directions. Seven
are with him in the mountains, so
frightened that even the arrival of
6,(KK) soldiers can't reassure them.
The three brothers taken to West
Timor are rumored to be dead.
"Last night I dreamed that it's
OK. that they're alive," he said.
"And my heart's not trembling. So
I hope everything's OK."
Pinto's own (light started days
before East Timor voted for inde
pendence from Indonesia, trigger
ing a terror campaign by pro-
Indonesian forces across the half
island territory. Contacts in the
East Timor resistance and with the
United Nations confirmed to him
what many East Timorese already
knew — that bUx>dshed would fol
low the Aug. 30 vote.
"I tell all my friends, we have to
go," he says. "Some people, they
trust me and run away. But other
people, they don't trust me. and
they get taken."
Pinto escaped to the hills days
before the vote. He came down

only to cast his ballot and then lied
hack, this time taking care to take
some sacks of rice with him.
I lis family joined him in the
mountains at Darlav, a three-hour
journey by car and then by foot.
I'hey were among hundreds of
refugees hiding there, foraging for
fruit and roots when the food ran
out.
His three brothers came down
the same day the peacekeepers
arrived, as soon as they heard the
news on the radio.
I lis brothers were allied with the
resistance. Hut militia were still
freely roaming the capital.
"They thought. 'The peacekeep
ers are here, everything's going to
be OK,' " he said. "Hut what hap
pened is [the militia] captured them
and arrested them and took them
away."
Pinto came down last week, as
the slowly building international
force moved deeper into the coun
try after securing Dili. He already
knew militia had burned his home,
as they did the majority of buildings
in East Timor's towns and villages.
Asked what possessions he still

has, lie looks down and waves his
hands at his dusty clothes. Asked
where he sleeps, lie points ;it the
ground.
In fact, he sleeps under the one
structure militia left unburned at his
home — "the house for chickens."
Five friends, also men on their own,
sleep with him at the chicken
house.
Pinto worries about his family
going hungry, their loud stores
gone. "They eat a lot of mangoes.
I'm sure their stomachs — oh. my."
Hut he wants them to stay until
he gives them the word it's safe.
That won't happen until at least
Monday — a militia leader in West
Timor has threatened to send thou
sands of his lighters across the bor
der then. Alter the past month.
East Timorese take that kind of
threat seriously.
But, if all stays quiet...
"These guys" — he points to the
red-bereted Indonesian soldiers
guarding the telecommunications
office across the street — "are
afraid of these guys." he says, nod
ding at a group of Australian sol
diers.
