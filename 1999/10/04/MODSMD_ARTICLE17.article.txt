SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — A
week after moving to offer online
shoppers just about anything they
could want to buy — from yard sale
trinkets to buffalo steaks — Ama
zon.com is giving customers a
ehanee to place their orders from
just about anywhere they go.
Amazon planned to announce
Monday it will become one of the
first e-commerce companies to sell
its products through new wireless
devices. The move is timed to coin
cide with this week's nationwide
release of 3Com Corp.'s new Palm
VII, a hand-held computer that will
provide wireless Internet access to
allow users to read e-mail, shop and
browse popular Web sites.
"Last week, we announced our
new zSI IOPS. which was about any
thing. This is about anywhere," said
Warren Adams, an Amazon execu
tive who leads the "Amazon Any
where" initiative. "Now our cus
tomers can have their shopping mall
in their pockets instead of having to
be at their desktop."
In just a few years, Seattle-based
Amazon has become an Internet
shopping powerhouse, going from
selling books to electronics and toys
as well as hosting auctions, in a bid
to become a one-stop shopping site
for consumers.
The company has been announc
ing several new initiatives to raise
consumer awareness of the site
ahead of the holiday shopping sea
son. during which online commerce
sales are expected to rise sharply
over last year. Amazon's stock
soared last week after it announced
zSHOPS, which lets almost anyone
sell online, regardless of product size
and quantity or location.
To accomplish its new goal,
Amazon announced it had acquired
Convergence Corp., a software firm
specializing in wireless technology,
for $23 million in Amazon's stock.
The company developed the soft
ware that must be downloaded, ini
tially to the Palm device, and later to
other wireless devices.
Analysts say Amazon and other
companies are hedging their bets by
building software to allow con
sumers to shop without being con
nected to a fixed phone or cable line.
Worldwide sales of hand-held
computers are expected to exceed
5.7 million units in 1999, a 47 percent
increase over 1998, according to
research firm Dataquest.
