# Bradley forces Gore to rethink strategy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Acknowledging "a close, hard
fought race" with Bill Bradley, Vice
President A 1 Gore said Sunday he
welcomes the chance "to change
the way I campaign" and talk
directly to Americans.
"It was inevitable that it my
opponent crossed the threshold of
credibility and competence, which
he did. then it would narrow and
tighten and become a hard-fought,
close contest. It has now reached
that stage," Gore said on CBS's
"Face the Nation."
With Bradley gaining in public
opinion polls. Gore shook up his
presidential campaign last week,
moving its headquarters to Ten
nessee from the nation's capital and
challenging Bradley to a series of
debates.
"I'm going to change the way I
campaign, and instead of having
these events that are planned out,
just have open meetings and talk to
people directly about the choices
we face," Gore said Sunday.
The vice president called the
prospect of a real contest against
Bradley for the Democrat's 2(XX)
presidential nomination "a healthy
development."
"It's a close, hard-fought race
and frankly, I welcome that," he
said.
Debates on national issues are
needed to "elevate" the contest.
Gore said, and would allow him
and Bradley to highlight their dif
ferences without "grenades being
tossed back and forth."
Gore nevertheless took advan
tage of the immediate opportunity
to pounce on one difference
between the two candidates: their
reactions after Republicans won
control of Congress in 1994.
"I tried to help rally the troops,
the forces of what I regard as
progress, and Senator Bradley
chose that moment to say that he
was going to leave the public arena,
said it was broken and said that he
might even run as an independent,"
he said.
Bradley left the Senate in 1996
after three terms.
That jab on Sunday led Bradley
spokesman Eric Hauser to question
whether "the vice president's focus
on narrow political tactics and posi
tioning and negative campaigning"
undermined the credibility of
Gore's call for an issue-focused
campaign.

Struggling to rescue his troubled
campaign. Gore now must (end off
the unexpectedly strong challenge
from Bradley and convince voters
he can handle Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, the GOP front-runner.
The dual assignment became a
political imperative for Gore with
the recognition that Bradley is gain
ing strength in key states — New
Hampshire, New York and Califor
nia — and is outdistancing the vice
president in raising money. To get
to Bush — or whoever the Republi
can nominee is — Gore has to get
past Bradley first.
Gore's move to Tennessee
appears intended to pare down his
bloated campaign and symbolically
distance himself from Washington
insiders and the taint of "Clinton
fatigue" — the weariness with scan
dals and battles of President Bill
Clinton. But after Gore's seven
years in the White House and ser
vice in both the House and Senate,
it will be difficult to see him as an
outsider.
"I think they're sort of thrashing
around," Vanderbilt University
political scientist Erwin Hargrove
said. "Probably a lot of people
don't want to move out here. But
he realized he was running low on
money. He realized that he was
neck-and-neck with Bradley. He
realized he had to do something."
Gore said Sunday he is "count
ing on Clinton fatigue."
"I think people are tired of the
questions about that because they
want to turn the page and look to
the future," he said.
With layers of consultants, poll
sters, staff and conflicting advice.
Gore was slow to accept the threat
posed by Bradley.
"They sat around and said, 'Oh,
no, we're the vice president. Every
thing's line, Bradley can't raise any
money," said Democratic media
strategist Jim Duffy. "And the thing
was just decaying. And it's not like
this is new. There were polls three
and four months ago saying
Bradley's moving up."
Struggling for strong footing.
Gore has decided to call himself the
underdog — even though by many
measures he remains the Demo
cratic front-runner, with much bet
ter name recognition than Bradley,
endorsements from more than 1 (K)
Democratic members of Congress
and support from many organized
Democratic groups.
