## 
### Sameer Ahmed 
Whether you grew up admiring the
Rolling Stones or Tupac Shakur, Pablo Pi
casso or Langston Hughes, chances are
your heroes were either black or influ
enced by black popular culture and per
forming arts.
Stanford students will get a chance to
explore this idea from Oct. 8-10, when
over 30 scholars, musicians, performers
and professionals in the fields of advertis
ing. journalism, film, music, theater and
dance arrive to examine the effects of
black popular culture and performance on
society in a symposium entitled. "Making
the Spirit of 20th and 21st Century Cul
ture: Placing Black Popular Culture &
Performance."

"This symposium is an excellent plat
form and a unique opportunity to create
awareness of black popular culture and
how it relates to America," said sympo
sium coordinator Kim Fowler, program
and development chair at the Committee
on Black Performing Arts.
Sponsored bv the Black Popular Cul
ture Workshop and the Committee on
Black Performing Arts, the organizers of
this symposium hope to create a bond be
tween black popular culture and perfor
mance.
"This is the first conference of its type
for Stanford and possibly in the country,"
said BPCW Director Kennell Jackson, as
sociate professor of history. "Nowhere
else has black popular culture and perfor
mance come together in such a large

scale."
"Making the Spirit" will consist of five
panels, a roundtable discussion, live per
formances. a keynote speech and a live
Web-cast accessible over the Internet.
One of the unique aspects of this event
is that it will be broadcast on the Internet,
allowing viewers at home, school or work
to view the discussions and interact with
the speakers.
"The Web-east will increase the inter
action of people beyond this campus,"
Fowler said. "It will allow people from
anywhere in the country and maybe in the
world to access the dialogues and even re
spond through e-mail."
I look-ups are being created with the
University of Michigan and Plugged In. a
community computer access organization

in East Palo Alto. Participants at these
sites will be able to ask questions and make
comments.
"A major goal of the panels and the
conference as a whole is to demonstrate
how black popular culture and performing
arts have played an important role in shap
ing the sensibilities in the 20th century,"
said Jackson.
The symposium will open Friday
evening at the Bechtel International Cen
ter with musician Will Power performing
an excerpt from his newest hip-hop piece,
"The Gathering."
Following Power's performance. Dr.
Manthia Diawara, professor of Africana
Studies at New York University and editor
in chief ol 'Black Renaissance / Re
naissance Noire Magazine," will de
liver the keynote address.
I he panels, spread throughout the
three-day period, will discuss a wide
variety of topics, from black repre
sentation in films, TV and advertising
to the cultural migrations and appro
priations of black popular culture and
performance, such as the globaliza
tion of jazz and hip-hop.
Additionally, as part of the activi
ties, performances by professional
artists, such as Cultural Heritage
Choir Director Linda Tillery and per
former Brian Freeman, will be show
cased alongside the artistic work of
Stanford graduate students.
"The performances were chosen
based on the themes of the panels,"
Fowler said. "They are designed to
exemplify the issues that are brought
up. The audience will get a theoreti
cal as well as an artistic perspective on
the issues which will bring another di

mension to the discussions."
According to Jackson, it is espe
cially interesting that a conference of
this magnitude on this subject is tak
ing place at Stanford.
"Stanford doesn't do that much
with mass cultural themes as it should
.given how vigorous this material is
today," he said, "it is rare at Stanford
to have a conference on a black
theme on this large a scale."
Jackson added. "We will all learn
how to think about mass culture and
black culture in a different way. This
will be an excellent opportunity to
hear something that is different and
exciting."
The BPCW and Jackson are
working with the CBPA, created as a
student organization in 1 %8 to exam
ine the impact of black cultural ex
pression at Stanford, and its director
Drama Prof. 1 tarry Elam, to create
this new experience for the Stanford
community.
The symposium is free, but regis
tration is strongly encouraged. To
