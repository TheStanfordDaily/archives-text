Whether you grew up admiring the
Rolling Stones or Tupac Shakur, Pablo Pi
casso or Langston Hughes, chances are
your heroes were either black or influ
enced by black popular culture and per
forming arts.
Stanford students will get a chance to
explore this idea from Oct. 8-10, when
over 30 scholars, musicians, performers
and professionals in the fields of advertis
ing. journalism, film, music, theater and
dance arrive to examine the effects of
black popular culture and performance on
society in a symposium entitled. "Making
the Spirit of 20th and 21st Century Cul
ture: Placing Black Popular Culture &
Performance."

"This symposium is an excellent plat
form and a unique opportunity to create
awareness of black popular culture and
how it relates to America," said sympo
sium coordinator Kim Fowler, program
and development chair at the Committee
on Black Performing Arts.
Sponsored bv the Black Popular Cul
ture Workshop and the Committee on
Black Performing Arts, the organizers of
this symposium hope to create a bond be
tween black popular culture and perfor
mance.
"This is the first conference of its type
for Stanford and possibly in the country,"
said BPCW Director Kennell Jackson, as
sociate professor of history. "Nowhere
else has black popular culture and perfor
mance come together in such a large

scale."
"Making the Spirit" will consist of five
panels, a roundtable discussion, live per
formances. a keynote speech and a live
Web-cast accessible over the Internet.
One of the unique aspects of this event
is that it will be broadcast on the Internet,
allowing viewers at home, school or work
to view the discussions and interact with
the speakers.
"The Web-east will increase the inter
action of people beyond this campus,"
Fowler said. "It will allow people from
anywhere in the country and maybe in the
world to access the dialogues and even re
spond through e-mail."
I look-ups are being created with the
University of Michigan and Plugged In. a
community computer access organization

in East Palo Alto. Participants at these
sites will be able to ask questions and make
comments.
"A major goal of the panels and the
conference as a whole is to demonstrate
how black popular culture and performing
arts have played an important role in shap
ing the sensibilities in the 20th century,"
said Jackson.
The symposium will open Friday
evening at the Bechtel International Cen
ter with musician Will Power performing
an excerpt from his newest hip-hop piece,
"The Gathering."
