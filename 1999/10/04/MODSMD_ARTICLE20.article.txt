# NAACP has strong 1st year

### Georgi Diankov 
It wasn't until last year that the
National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People, the
nation s oldest civil-rights organiza
tion, formed a local branch on the
Stanford campus.
This week marks the chapter's
one-year anniversary on campus. No
festivities are planned, but the
group's president, senior Mark
Sanders, is satisfied with what has
been achieved in the past year and is
confident about its future.
The Stanford chapter of the
NAACP was formed on Oct. 6 last
year, and, according to Sanders, it has
done well in following the lead of the
organization's network.
Although the Stanford chapter
tries to put the campus's broader so
cial setting into perspective, it is
mainly concerned with local "prob
lems and injustices," according to
Sanders. It is vigilant about any viola
tions committed on campus, as well
as about issues that involve the whole
community.
That holds true for the RMC Lon
estar Case, when a large cement pro
ducer announced plans to construct a
plant in East Palo Alto. The
NAACP. which Sanders said was
concerned about possible toxic
waste, joined ranks with other non
governmental organizations in a
fight against the plan. The county

eventually sanctioned the building of
the plant.
In spite of this outcome, Sanders
considered it a success, underscoring
the national chapter's commitment
to the education of future leaders and
its role as spokespeople for minority
groups.
"The minority and civil rights
movement on campus has definitely
been strengthened, through our edu
cational and awareness-raising mis
sion," Sanders said.
The campus chapter also plans to
continue non-partisan voter-regis
tration drives in local high schools
and on campus.
The regular activities of the chap
ter have been given publicity in its
newsletter, a project that was real
ized with the help of the Palo Alto
League of Women Voters.
When the question of direct exter
nal influence is raised, Sanders re
sponds, " The NCA AP has been pro
viding us with guidance and general
lines of conduct, but they have a lim
ited say in our day-today work. We
try to maintain our autonomy."
Sanders describes student-chap
ter relations as "warm and success
ful," in spite of a few minor cases of
friction that arose from the "special
fee drive last academic year."
In hindsight, Sanders said this first
year was the healthy beginning of a
"new and successful student-led or
ganization."
