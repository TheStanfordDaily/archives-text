# Drowsiness worse than drink, doctors say

Next time vou re drowsy from a
fitful night's sleep and are about to
get behind the wheel, think twice.
You could be as impaired as some
one who is legally drunk, according
to a new study by the Stanford Uni
versity Sleep Disorders Center.
Researchers found that sleep-de
prived individuals had slower reac
tion times than those whose blood
alcohol content is twice the legal
limit to drive in California.
Knowing that drinking slows
down reaction time, the study set out
to show that the effects of drinking
were comparable to sleep depriva
tion, said Dr. Nelson B. Powell, co
director of Stanford's Sleep Disor
ders Center.
"We're concerned with how
sleepy someone should be before we
say this is dangerous," Powell said,
pointing out that there's nothing
holding back a sleep-deprived indi

vidual from getting behind the
wheel.
Powell's group compared the re
action times of patients who suffer
from sleep apnea, a sleeping disor
der that disrupts breathing during
sleep, to intoxicated volunteers.
Three of seven measurements
taken showed that people with sleep
apnea performed worse than people
who were legally drunk.
"The general significance [of this
study] ' s that drowsiness, whether it
be due to sleep apnea or to sleep de
privation, is as dangerous as being
legally drunk. Sleep deprivation po
tentiates the sedative action of alco
hol," said Psychiatry Prof. William
Dement. "Of course, this means the
20 million apnea victims are essen
tially drunk drivers. This creates
danger for everyone."
Dement also pointed out that be
tween 50 to l X) percent of Stanford
undergraduates are sleep deprived.
Additionally, he said, a studv has

found that nine percent of an under
graduate sample of Stanford stu
dents have obstructive sleep apnea.
Moreover, the Washington,
D.C.-based National Sleep Founda
tion estimates that as many as 18 mil
lion Americans have sleep apnea.
Powell's study involved two
groups â€” SO healthy volunteers,
about half of whom were Stanford
students, and 113 sleep apnea pa
tients who suffered from mild to
moderate sleep-disordered breath
ing. Age and sex were not included
when the researchers gathered the
statistical data.
Both groups took a 10-minute
"reaction test," pressing a button to
turn off a randomly lit light. The
healthy volunteers then consumed
alcohol as their blood-alcohol con
tent was measured.
The study's organizers encour
aged participants to react quickly in
order to model actual sleep-de
prived driving.

The researchers took seven mea
surements to monitor the reaction
times. Participants were tested four
times to reach their baseline reac
tion time, after which the group of
volunteers began drinking alcohol.
Three more measurements
showed that after they started drink
ing. their blood-alcohol content av
eraged 0.05 percent. 0.08 percent
and 0.083 percent, or more than
twice California's 0.04 legal limit.
Powell said studies have shown
sleep apnea patients have three
times as many accidents as alert dri
vers.
Powell presented the results of
his study, "A Comparative Model in
Sleep-Disordered Breathing vs. Al
cohol Impaired Controls" at the an
nual American Academy of Oto
laryngology-Head and Neck
Surgery Foundation Inc. Sunday.
The study will be published this
month in the magazine Laryngo
scope.
