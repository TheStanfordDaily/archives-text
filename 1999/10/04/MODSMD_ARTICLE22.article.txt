# Students plan to sell dorm supplies on Web
##

In an attempt to gain business ex
perience and perhaps make a few
bucks on the side, sophomores Eric
Wong and Holly Deng have under
taken a rather large extracurricular
project — creating UDorm.com.
UDorm.com is an online shop
ping mall of sorts, offering roughly 30
items for the average college student.
Wong and Deng are working with
friends at Pomona College, Welles
ley and UC-Bcrkeley to bring the
Web site to students worldwide.
"This has definitely been a new
experience," Deng said. "I'd never
done anything like this before, and I
never thought 1 would. It's exciting."
Wong and Deng said they hope
their new "invention" will make it to
the list of college favorites.
According to the "About Us" link
on their Web site, the group claims to
have created "the first online site that

specifically sells items essential to the
ultimate dorm life experience."
These essentials range from In
flatable Chairs (at $14.95, about half
the Stanford Bookstore's price), to
strobe lights and Destiny Jars, all with
free shipping and a return policy.
Relying on America Online's In
stant Messenger conferences to hold
simultaneous conversations, Wong,
Deng and their friends at Pomona

College, Wellesley and UC-Berkeley
manage the Web site and handle pro
motions and advertising.
Wong's uncles handle the logistics
of actually receiving the orders and
sending out the materials to the cus
tomers.
Additionally. Wong said, special
deals with manufacturers allow
UDorm.com to offer lower prices
than other businesses.

Wong and Deng said the idea of
UDorm.com started at a coffee shop
table in downtown San Francisco in
early July.
"Virtually everything is online
these days, but there is one thing
that's not online, and it's a store that
caters to college students, living in
dorms all over the nation," Wong
said.
"We know three things," he said.
"First, college students love to deco
rate their rooms. Every year millions
of college students move into identi
cal. bare, whitewashed rooms and
they need to individualize them
selves. Second, college students love
to party. Third, college students like
to buy gilts."
In October, UDorm.com will cel
ebrate its two-week birthday. Be
cause the site is new, Wong said it is
hard to measure success, but he says
UDorm.com has been getting up to
" 1 ,(KK) visits by Web surfers per day."
