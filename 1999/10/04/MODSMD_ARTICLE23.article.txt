One year after the San Jose State foot
hall team shocked Stanford at Stanford
Stadium, the Spartans (3-2) managed to
repeat the feat, taking down the Cardinal

urday afternoon.

FOOTBALL
■ Friday: Stanford (3-2) 39, San Jose State
(3-2), 44.

The Stanford team that appeared
strong and confident playing against
UCLA last week had none of those qual
ities this time out. as the Spartans simply
played with more emotion and desire.
San Jose State senior quarterback

Chris Kasteler was 24 of 43 for 368 yards
passing. Senior receiver Steven Pulley did
his best Troy Walters impression, pulling
down 15 receptions for 255 yards and two
touchdowns.
Walters, the star senior Cardinal wide
out. did manage to haul in 10 catches for
186 yards. He broke former USC receiver
Johnnie Morton's Pac-10 record of 3,201
receiving yards on a 35-yard reception in
the second quarter. But it was the lack of
a solid running game and a porous de
fense that doomed the Cardinal.
"We put our pads on the same way
they put on their pads." an exuberant San
Jose State head coach Dave Baldwin said.
"Our kids saw this game as a champi
onship game. It's one of our goals on our
board as you walk through our center —
'Beat Stanford." And the kids know that."
The dichotomy between Stanford and

San Jose State was something Baldwin
had stressed all week to his team, playing
on the apparent differences in socioeco
nomic status between the two schools.
In an attempt at motivation, Baldwin
had the team buses tour the Stanford
campus before arriving at the stadium to
highlight the facilities and grounds here at
Stanford.
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham was understandably less excited
about the loss.
"It means we have a loss. It means we
are 3-2. In the big scheme of things, it
doesn't stop us from accomplishing any
thing that we want to accomplish."
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the game
probably does not mean much in the long
run. The team is still in first place in the
