## Spartans conquer Stanford turf Underdog SJS halts Cardinal win streak at four in 44-39 win 
### Tim Kane 
Not again.
One year after the San Jose State foot
hall team shocked Stanford at Stanford
Stadium, the Spartans (3-2) managed to
repeat the feat, taking down the Cardinal
(3-2) on its home turf with a 44-39 win Sat
urday afternoon.

FOOTBALL
■ Friday: Stanford (3-2) 39, San Jose State
(3-2), 44.

The Stanford team that appeared
strong and confident playing against
UCLA last week had none of those qual
ities this time out. as the Spartans simply
played with more emotion and desire.
San Jose State senior quarterback

Chris Kasteler was 24 of 43 for 368 yards
passing. Senior receiver Steven Pulley did
his best Troy Walters impression, pulling
down 15 receptions for 255 yards and two
touchdowns.
Walters, the star senior Cardinal wide
out. did manage to haul in 10 catches for
186 yards. He broke former USC receiver
Johnnie Morton's Pac-10 record of 3,201
receiving yards on a 35-yard reception in
the second quarter. But it was the lack of
a solid running game and a porous de
fense that doomed the Cardinal.
"We put our pads on the same way
they put on their pads." an exuberant San
Jose State head coach Dave Baldwin said.
"Our kids saw this game as a champi
onship game. It's one of our goals on our
board as you walk through our center —
'Beat Stanford." And the kids know that."
The dichotomy between Stanford and

San Jose State was something Baldwin
had stressed all week to his team, playing
on the apparent differences in socioeco
nomic status between the two schools.
In an attempt at motivation, Baldwin
had the team buses tour the Stanford
campus before arriving at the stadium to
highlight the facilities and grounds here at
Stanford.
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham was understandably less excited
about the loss.
"It means we have a loss. It means we
are 3-2. In the big scheme of things, it
doesn't stop us from accomplishing any
thing that we want to accomplish."
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the game
probably does not mean much in the long
run. The team is still in first place in the

now even-weaker Pac-10 at 3-0,
and to reach the team's stated goal
for the year — playing in a howl
game — the Cardinal probably
only needs six or seven wins by the
end of the season. Of course, the
team's pride is a little wounded,
considering Stanford has now lost
to the same team from a weaker
conference at its own stadium two
years in a row.
Junior backup Joe Borchard
started at quarterback for Stanford
in place of senior Todd I lusak, who
was giving his bruised ribs addi
tional rest on orders from head
coach Tyrone Willingham. Bor
chard went l l > of 37 for 313 yards
passing, but looked uncomfortable

at times in the pocket and over
threw several receivers during the
game.
"1 have to say I'm disappointed
in the way 1 played," he said. "My
job was to come in here and get us a
win. The fact that I couldn't do that
makes me disappointed in my per
formance."
San Jose State took the opening
kickoff and marched 65 yards in 10
plays, scoring on a 15-yard run by
sophomore tailback Patrick Battle.
Stanford struck back later in the
quarter with a 41-yard field goal
from junior kicker Mike Biselli, but
the Spartans would embark on a
nine-play, 79-yard drive ending in a
touchdown run by junior Darian
Morton, putting the Spartans
ahead 14-3.
Stanford added another field
goal from Biselli later in the quar

ter, but demonstrated an inability
to get the ball into the end zone that
would haunt it all day.
Sophomore safety Colin Branch
provided Stanford with a terrific
special teams play at the beginning
of the second quarter as he burst
through the Spartans' line and
blocked Tim Morgan's punt into
the upright, resulting in a safety
and two points for Stanford.
A two-yard touchdown run by
junior Coy Wire to cap a five-play,
65-yard drive gave Stanford a 15-14
lead.
After the defense managed to
stop the Spartans, Borchard led the
Cardinal all the way down to the
San Jose State 3-yard line, only to
throw an interception right at Spar
tan senior defensive end James
Ditch that ended the Stanford
threat.

San Jose State would add a field
goal later in the quarter and go off
into the locker room at the half
leading 17-15.
After exchanging punts to start
the second half, San Jose State
went on another long touchdown
drive that included two more long
receptions by Pulley, a sight which
had become all too common over
the course of the afternoon.
Stanford would answer back
with a Borchard-to-Walters con
nection for 25 yards and a touch
down to cut San Jose State's lead to
24-22, but the Spartans caught a
break on the next Stanford drive
when Borchard got drilled and
fumbled the ball, and Spartan ju
nior linebacker Ron Ockimey
picked it up and rumbled 38 yards
for a touchdown.
Sophomore tailback Brian
Allen had an impressive 39-yard
touchdown run to cut the deficit to
31-29, and Biselli kicked yet anoth
er field goal to give Stanford the
lead at 32-31.
However, as was the case all day,
the Stanford defense could not stop
the Spartans when it absolutely had
to. Casey Leßlanc ran 19 yards for
a touchdown, and then, to essen
tially put the game away. Pulley
burned the Stanford secondary for
a 54-yard scoring strike from
Kasteler with 2:33 left.
Stanford did put together a
quick scoring drive, with Walters
on the receiving end of a seven
yard touchdown pass.
With under two minutes re
maining, the Cardinal attempted
an onside kick. Stanford wideout
Dave Davis appeared to come
down with the ball, sending the
meager crowd that remained into a
frenzy, but the play was disallowed
because of an illegal formation call
against the Cardinal.
On the ensuing second attempt,
the Spartans recovered the kick
and ran the clock out, leaving the
Cardinal faithful wondering what
had happened for the second year
in a row.

now even-weaker Pac-10 at 3-0,
and to reach the team's stated goal
for the year — playing in a howl
game — the Cardinal probably
only needs six or seven wins by the
end of the season. Of course, the
team's pride is a little wounded,
considering Stanford has now lost
to the same team from a weaker
conference at its own stadium two
years in a row.
Junior backup Joe Borchard
started at quarterback for Stanford
in place of senior Todd I lusak, who
was giving his bruised ribs addi
tional rest on orders from head
coach Tyrone Willingham. Bor
chard went l l > of 37 for 313 yards
passing, but looked uncomfortable

at times in the pocket and over
threw several receivers during the
game.
"1 have to say I'm disappointed
in the way 1 played," he said. "My
job was to come in here and get us a
win. The fact that I couldn't do that
makes me disappointed in my per
formance."
San Jose State took the opening
kickoff and marched 65 yards in 10
plays, scoring on a 15-yard run by
sophomore tailback Patrick Battle.
Stanford struck back later in the
quarter with a 41-yard field goal
from junior kicker Mike Biselli, but
the Spartans would embark on a
nine-play, 79-yard drive ending in a
touchdown run by junior Darian
Morton, putting the Spartans
ahead 14-3.
Stanford added another field
goal from Biselli later in the quar

ter, but demonstrated an inability
to get the ball into the end zone that
would haunt it all day.
Sophomore safety Colin Branch
provided Stanford with a terrific
special teams play at the beginning
of the second quarter as he burst
through the Spartans' line and
blocked Tim Morgan's punt into
the upright, resulting in a safety
and two points for Stanford.
A two-yard touchdown run by
junior Coy Wire to cap a five-play,
65-yard drive gave Stanford a 15-14
lead.
After the defense managed to
stop the Spartans, Borchard led the
Cardinal all the way down to the
San Jose State 3-yard line, only to
throw an interception right at Spar
tan senior defensive end James
Ditch that ended the Stanford
threat.

San Jose State would add a field
goal later in the quarter and go off
into the locker room at the half
leading 17-15.
After exchanging punts to start
the second half, San Jose State
went on another long touchdown
drive that included two more long
receptions by Pulley, a sight which
had become all too common over
the course of the afternoon.
Stanford would answer back
with a Borchard-to-Walters con
nection for 25 yards and a touch
down to cut San Jose State's lead to
24-22, but the Spartans caught a
break on the next Stanford drive
when Borchard got drilled and
fumbled the ball, and Spartan ju
nior linebacker Ron Ockimey
picked it up and rumbled 38 yards
for a touchdown.
Sophomore tailback Brian
Allen had an impressive 39-yard
touchdown run to cut the deficit to
31-29, and Biselli kicked yet anoth
er field goal to give Stanford the
lead at 32-31.
However, as was the case all day,
the Stanford defense could not stop
the Spartans when it absolutely had
to. Casey Leßlanc ran 19 yards for
a touchdown, and then, to essen
tially put the game away. Pulley
burned the Stanford secondary for
a 54-yard scoring strike from
Kasteler with 2:33 left.
Stanford did put together a
quick scoring drive, with Walters
on the receiving end of a seven
yard touchdown pass.
With under two minutes re
maining, the Cardinal attempted
an onside kick. Stanford wideout
Dave Davis appeared to come
down with the ball, sending the
meager crowd that remained into a
frenzy, but the play was disallowed
because of an illegal formation call
against the Cardinal.
On the ensuing second attempt,
the Spartans recovered the kick
and ran the clock out, leaving the
Cardinal faithful wondering what
had happened for the second year
in a row.

One year after the San Jose State foot
hall team shocked Stanford at Stanford
Stadium, the Spartans (3-2) managed to
repeat the feat, taking down the Cardinal
(3-2) on its home turf with a 44-39 win Sat
urday afternoon.

FOOTBALL
■ Friday: Stanford (3-2) 39, San Jose State
(3-2), 44.

The Stanford team that appeared
strong and confident playing against
UCLA last week had none of those qual
ities this time out. as the Spartans simply
played with more emotion and desire.
San Jose State senior quarterback

Chris Kasteler was 24 of 43 for 368 yards
passing. Senior receiver Steven Pulley did
his best Troy Walters impression, pulling
down 15 receptions for 255 yards and two
touchdowns.
Walters, the star senior Cardinal wide
out. did manage to haul in 10 catches for
186 yards. He broke former USC receiver
Johnnie Morton's Pac-10 record of 3,201
receiving yards on a 35-yard reception in
the second quarter. But it was the lack of
a solid running game and a porous de
fense that doomed the Cardinal.
"We put our pads on the same way
they put on their pads." an exuberant San
Jose State head coach Dave Baldwin said.
"Our kids saw this game as a champi
onship game. It's one of our goals on our
board as you walk through our center —
'Beat Stanford." And the kids know that."
The dichotomy between Stanford and

San Jose State was something Baldwin
had stressed all week to his team, playing
on the apparent differences in socioeco
nomic status between the two schools.
In an attempt at motivation, Baldwin
had the team buses tour the Stanford
campus before arriving at the stadium to
highlight the facilities and grounds here at
Stanford.
