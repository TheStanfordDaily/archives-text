# Cardinal runs away with Stanford Invite
## Ladies take first 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
It is said that a cross country team is only as good as
its fifth runner, the last person to count in team scoring.
The No. I Stanford women's cross country team
proved that statement wrong Saturday on the Stanford
Golf Course.
Taking the team title at the 26th Annual Stanford
Invitational, the Cardinal women showed that its team
is more than just five runners deep as they handily dis
missed five of the top-10 ranked teams in the nation in
one of the best fields ever assembled in California.

WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Saturday: No. I Stanford comes in first at 26th An
nual Stanford Invitational.

While beating the No. 2 Arkansas Lady Ra/.orbacks
by a spread of 15 is a sign of strength, more telling than
Saturday's final score was that Stanford could have
beaten Arkansas had the Cardinal's five and six run
ners not finished. Had the seventh disappeared, the
score would have been tied with Stanford taking the
victory because the ninth Stanford harrier across the
line came before Arkansas' sixth.
While overshadowed a bit by the team competition
— which also included third-place and No. 4 BYU —
Stanford's 36-point attack was fueled by the fight for in
dividual first place. Junior Julia Stamps had an out
standing second race of the season, battling NCAA
preseason favorite Amy Yoder of Arkansas from start
to finish.
After going through mile one of the S,(NX)-meter
course in five minutes, seven seconds in a pack of six
that included four Lady 'Backs, Stamps pushed ahead,
working hard on the uphill portion of the course until
the two-mile mark. At that point, by hole IS. where the
women turn around and go back down the hill towards
the finish line. Stamps had a short lead on Arkansas'
Yoder and sophomore Lilli Kleinmann, going through
the marker in 10:58.
On the way down. Yoder took the lead, with Klien
mann following. Stamps stayed composed and made a
move at the bottom of the hill heading into the final NIX)
meters of the course.
"I was totally relaxed," Stamps said. "So w hen they
were a little ahead of me 1 said, 'you know what, I am
going to get them' and I did. I finally got them under
neath the bridge."
Stamps continued to look strong through the finish,
but Yoder poured it on the last stretch to take her sec
ond-straight Stanford Invitational title in a meet record
16:41. compared to 16:43 for Stamps.
"I was just trying to hold her off," Stamps said. "Un
fortunately at the last 1 (X) meters she had a little bit
more leg speed than I did."
Freshman Lauren Fleshman was second across the
line for Stanford for fourth place. In just her second col-
