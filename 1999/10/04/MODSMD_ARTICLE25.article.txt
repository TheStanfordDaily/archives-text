### Ben Allen Staff writer 
If running as a pack proves to be
Ihe key to Stanford's success in
men's cross country this season, as
head coach Vin Lananna suggests,
then the Cardinal's victory at Sat
urday's 26th Annual Stanford Invi
tational can only be an omen of
good things to come.
Bunching all five scorers into
the top 15 places, including four in
the top nine. No. 2 Stanford's 36
points thwarted the challenge of
No. 8 Arizona (47 points) and 16
other squads.
Stanford was led by the second
place finish of junior Thomas Mur
ley, who crossed the line in 24 min
utes, 19 seconds. Only Arizona's
Micheil Jones, who posted the

same time, finished ahead of Mur
ley.

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Saturday: No. 2 Stanford comes
in first at 26th Annual Stanford In
vitational.
Senior Jake Maas crossed the
line in 24:42, earning him a fourth
place finish, and he was followed
by redshirt freshman Jesse Thomas
in seventh (24:45) and sophomore
Jamey Clifford in ninth (24:50).
Redshirt freshman Joe Urbanski
rounded out the scoring for the
Cardinal, taking 15th (25:07).
Stanford looked good early, as
sophomore Gabe Jennings (18th.
25:14) led the race through the first
mile in a brisk 4:38. Murley, who
trailed Jenninus bv almost 20 me

ters at the time, remained settled
and waited to make his move.

"I tried to keep focused by pay
ing attention to the team," Murlev
said. "I didn't want the team to
string out too much, so I was look
ing behind, trying to call some guvs
up front."
Mis tactics paid off. as Maas
worked his way toward the front
with Thomas and Clifford in tow.
The Stanford pack crossed the
three-mile mark in 14:40 and hung
together for the uphill climb which
comprised much of the fourth mile.
Then it was time to break loose.
Murlev took off first, bringing
Jones and Alabama's Tim Broe
along for the ride. Maas was not far
behind.
"At the top of the hill at mile
four, it's kind of every man for him
self," Maas said. "You have to be as
competitive as possible from that
point on as an individual. That's
where you try to break it open as
best as you can."
Gifford and Thomas, who train
together with Maas, let the pack
mentality they work on in practice
take over in the clutch. The three
hung together and crossed the line
within eight seconds of each other.
Lananna was impressed by the
48-second spread between Stan
ford's first and fifth men, but indi

cated that the gap would need to
close as the season progresses.
"All of our guys are going to have
to be counted upon, and that's how 1
will set the lineup every weekend."
he said. "1 will put us in the most vul
nerable position that 1 can in order
for guys to have to step to the plate
and hit a home run each time —
bases loaded, bottom of the ninth,
full count, and they'll have to take
the big swing. That's what I'm
after."
As for Murley. who is finally run
ning at 100 percent after many sea
sons of nagging injuries, his dedica
tion to training is finally paying off.
"1 feel strong at this point — 1 felt
comfortable at that pace, which is a
positive," Murley said. "I've always

expected myself to run this fast, it
was just a matter of staying healthy
and being consistent."
And Lananna. who is looking for
his men to step up during this "re
building" year, now has some hard
and fast results to ruminate upon.
"We had some guys stepping up
today, like Jamey and Jesse who
have been there all along and need
ed this really badlv," Murley said.
"They're going to be our pack run
ners, so they need to be really
tight."
"I hope 1 put my name out there
as one of the guys." Thomas said.
"We'll see what coach does, we have
a lot of guys. But at the same time,
nobody can afford to step off their
game. It's so competitive out there."
