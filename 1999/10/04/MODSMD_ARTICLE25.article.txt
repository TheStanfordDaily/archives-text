If running as a pack proves to be
Ihe key to Stanford's success in
men's cross country this season, as
head coach Vin Lananna suggests,
then the Cardinal's victory at Sat
urday's 26th Annual Stanford Invi
tational can only be an omen of
good things to come.
Bunching all five scorers into
the top 15 places, including four in
the top nine. No. 2 Stanford's 36
points thwarted the challenge of
No. 8 Arizona (47 points) and 16
other squads.
Stanford was led by the second
place finish of junior Thomas Mur
ley, who crossed the line in 24 min
utes, 19 seconds. Only Arizona's
Micheil Jones, who posted the

same time, finished ahead of Mur
ley.

mile in a brisk 4:38. Murley, who
trailed Jenninus bv almost 20 me

ters at the time, remained settled
and waited to make his move.

"I tried to keep focused by pay
ing attention to the team," Murlev
said. "I didn't want the team to
string out too much, so I was look
ing behind, trying to call some guvs
up front."
Mis tactics paid off. as Maas
worked his way toward the front
with Thomas and Clifford in tow.
The Stanford pack crossed the
three-mile mark in 14:40 and hung
together for the uphill climb which
comprised much of the fourth mile.
Then it was time to break loose.

Jones and Alabama's Tim Broe
along for the ride. Maas was not far
behind.
