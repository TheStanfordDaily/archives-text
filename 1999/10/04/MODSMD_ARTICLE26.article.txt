# Men's polo squad claims narrow win over Cal
## Two-point goal in final minutes lifts Cardinal to 8-7 victory against Bears 
### Erin Bouchier Contributing writer 
Beating Cal always feels good. But
the water polo team's Saturday victory
over the sixth-ranked Bears was espe
cially sweet because it came in an im
portant league game in which Stanford
rarely had a lead. With Cal up 7-6 and
just under two minutes to go in the
fourth quarter, redshirt sophomore
Todd Snider answered Cardinal prayers
with a two-point goal, giving Stanford
an 8-7 advantage that it would not relin

quish.

MEN'S WATER POLO
â–  Saturday: No. 1 Stanford (8-1, 2-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) K.
No. 6 California (3-4,0-1) 7.

Coming into Saturday's matchup,
the Bears (3-4. 0-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) appeared to have
two major advantages over No. 2 Stan
ford (8-1, 2-1): the game would be
played at Spieker pool in Berkeley and
many Cardinal players had been sick

over the past week.
With the cards seemingly stacked
against them, the Stanford squad fell
into a hole quickly, allowing goals by
Mike West and Jerry Smith and giving
Cal a 2-0 advantage at the start of the
first quarter.
But late in the period Stanford came
charging back with goals by senior
Brian Heifferon and freshman Peter
Hudnut to tie the game at two.
Cal went up again in the second
quarter, making the score 3-2. Stanford
came back with 16 seconds to go in the

period, tying the game on a goal by
sophomore Onno Koelman. Hut right
after Koelman's goal, the Cardinal de
fense broke down, allowing Bear Joe
Kaiser to score with only one tick left on
the clock, making the score 4-3 in favor
of Cal at the half.
Stanford opened the scoring in the
third quarter as Hudnut fired a shot
from the hole to knot the score at four
apiece.
Junior Peter Osborn followed Mud-
nut with a goal of his own to give
the Cardinal its first lead of the af
ternoon. But Cal would not have to
play catch-up for long. Goals by
Andrew Stoddard and Kaiser put
the Bears up 6-5. Stanford came
storming back with a goal by red
shirt sophomore holeman Mark
Amott, tying the game at six as the
teams headed into the final period.
Early in the fourth quarter.
Smith, the Cal holeman, drew a
four-meter penalty on the Cardi
nal. Eldad Hazor took the ensuing
penalty shot and skipped the ball
past redshirt freshman goalie Nick
Ellis to put the Bears up 7-6.
As the clock ticked down to two
minutes, it was time for Snider's
heroics. An offensive call against
Smith led to a Cardinal counterat
tack. Snider finished the counter
attack perfectly with his first two
point goal of the season. After the
score, the Cardinal's defensive
play buckled down, stealing the
ball from Smith twice and prevent
ing the Bears from taking any
shots, ensuring the 8-7 Cardinal
victory.
After the win. Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti had a lot to
savor.
All week in practice the Cardi
nal squad had worked on the coun
terattack; Stanford's lone loss to
UCLA was due in large part, Det
tamanti felt, to the success of the
Bruins' six-man counterattack.
Against the Bears, Dettamanti
wanted his players to counter the
way the Bruins had against them.
That they did. In fact, Dettamanti
felt the Cardinal counterattack was

the difference in the game.
Another key to Stanford's vic
tory was shutting down Smith, the
Bears' leading scorer. Cardinal
team defense was excellent, pre
venting Smith from scoring any
goals from the hole and limiting
him to just one score on a 6-on-5.
While Smith was stymied in the
hole, Stanford's two-meter men
had three scores. Compared to
their mediocre showing against
UCLA, "the holemen did a much
better job at controlling the ball
and then coming back on defense,"
Dettamanti said.
Dettamanti was also pleased
with Ellis, the team's last line of de
fense. While "he was sick the
whole game," he "still made some
really nice saves."
With Ellis and others still sick,
Stanford had to relv on its depth to
pick up the scoring load. In all. 13
players saw playing time during the
game.
Dettamanti was extremely
happy with the team's perfor
mance.
"I'm really encouraged that
every game we have different peo
ple scoring," he said.
One aspect of its game that the
Cardinal squad needs to work on is
6-on-ss, both offensively and de
fensively. Against the Bears, Stan
ford converted only one of seven 6-
on-5s for a score. And on defense,
the Cardinal allowed Cal to con
vert half of their man-up opportu
nites.
Improving the team's perfor
mance on 6-on-5 offense and de
fense will be one of several things
that Stanford works on this week
as it prepares for its own NorCal
tournament this weekend Satur
day and Sunday at DeGuerre Pool.
