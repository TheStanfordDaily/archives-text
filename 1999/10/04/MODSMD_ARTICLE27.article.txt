### Ellie Ritch Contributing writer 
After watching the Stanford women's volleyball
team crush two Pacific 10 Conference opponents this
weekend, winning its lOth-straight game and its 30th
straight home game in a row. one might ask: Where can
they go now?
The answer is up. As a result of the team's domi
nance in both Thursday and Friday's night games, the
Cardinal (11-1 . 5-0 Pac-10) has jumped from No. 7 to
No. 6 in the national rankings.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Thursday: No. 6 Stanford (11-1. 5-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) del. Oregon (6-7,0-5), 15-1, 15-1. 15-5.
■ Friday: Stanford def. Oregon State (7-6, 1-4). 15-11,15
11. 15-5.

The Stanford women's squad defeated Oregon (6-7.
0-5) with a smooth 15-1. 15-1. 15-5 match on Thursday
night at Maples Pavilion. The slaughter continued 24
hours later, when the Cardinal put up a straight-set 15-
11.15-11. 15-5 victory over Oregon State (7-6. 1-4).
Thursday's win over the Ducks marked a season
high team offensive game for the Cardinal. The
women's squad boasted a hitting percentage of .506 (46
kills, seven errors and 77 attempts).
After the team came off the blocks with a 12-0 run.
Oregon finally pulled off a mercy point to bring the
score to 12-1. In the second game, the Ducks continued
to show signs of nervousness, lacking decent setting and
organization. These factors, along with a string of un
forced errors by the Oregon squad, allowed the Cardi
nal to easily take the next two games.
Coach Don Shaw did not allow the half-time discus
sion to slide in intensity as a result of the lopsided first
two games. Instead. Shaw chose to focus on the fact that
the team had to learn to come out strong all the time.
The team had given its opponents unnecessary lee
way in the later games of some of the team's matches
this season, and Shaw used halftime to ensure that his
players made a conscious effort to stop this recurring
theme.
