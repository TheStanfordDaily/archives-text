### Ellie Ritch Contributing writer 
After watching the Stanford women's volleyball
team crush two Pacific 10 Conference opponents this
weekend, winning its lOth-straight game and its 30th
straight home game in a row. one might ask: Where can
they go now?
The answer is up. As a result of the team's domi
nance in both Thursday and Friday's night games, the
Cardinal (11-1 . 5-0 Pac-10) has jumped from No. 7 to
No. 6 in the national rankings.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Thursday: No. 6 Stanford (11-1. 5-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) del. Oregon (6-7,0-5), 15-1, 15-1. 15-5.
■ Friday: Stanford def. Oregon State (7-6, 1-4). 15-11,15
11. 15-5.

The Stanford women's squad defeated Oregon (6-7.
0-5) with a smooth 15-1. 15-1. 15-5 match on Thursday
night at Maples Pavilion. The slaughter continued 24
hours later, when the Cardinal put up a straight-set 15-
11.15-11. 15-5 victory over Oregon State (7-6. 1-4).
Thursday's win over the Ducks marked a season
high team offensive game for the Cardinal. The
women's squad boasted a hitting percentage of .506 (46
kills, seven errors and 77 attempts).
After the team came off the blocks with a 12-0 run.
Oregon finally pulled off a mercy point to bring the
score to 12-1. In the second game, the Ducks continued
to show signs of nervousness, lacking decent setting and
organization. These factors, along with a string of un
forced errors by the Oregon squad, allowed the Cardi
nal to easily take the next two games.
Coach Don Shaw did not allow the half-time discus
sion to slide in intensity as a result of the lopsided first
two games. Instead. Shaw chose to focus on the fact that
the team had to learn to come out strong all the time.
The team had given its opponents unnecessary lee
way in the later games of some of the team's matches
this season, and Shaw used halftime to ensure that his
players made a conscious effort to stop this recurring
theme.
Freshman outside hitter Logan Tom and sophomore

Freshman phenom Logan Tom blocks a kill against
Oregon State on Friday. Tom led the Cardinal to a
three-game victory over the Beavers at Maples
Pavilion.
middle blockers, Tara Conrad and
Sara Sandrik produced stellar per
formances en route to victory over
Oregon, lom set the tone for the
Cardinal attack with 17 kills and a
.577 hitting percentage. Conrad tied
the Cardinal season-high for blocks
with 10. Conrad and Sandrik each
posted eight kills, and junior setter
Lindsay Kagawa also turned heads
with a match-high 38 assists.
The team w as clearly guided by
Tom again during the Oregon State
game on Friday. Tom posted an
outstanding career-high 26 kills.
This statistic is even more im
pressive considering Tom garnered
all 26 in just a three-game time peri
od. The 26 kills is the fourth-highest
total this season in the conference
for up to five games, as well as the
highest three-game total. Tom
added depth to her statistics with
nine digs, two service aces and a hit
ting percentage of .375.
Tom explained that her sharp
playing on Friday night was attrib
uted to getting to know her new
teammates.
"I have been playing with the
team longer now and I am getting to
feel more comfortable with them."
Tom said. "Our setting has been
awesome, and we have easily been
able to create a hole, or set up a one
on-one as a result."
Tom noted the Cardinal's suc
cess against the Oregon teams in
running middle plays and pushing
its defenders to the outside. This
strategy helped the team keep its
opponents guessing.
Tom has enjoyed her time work
ing with Shaw thus far. Her previ

ous club coach actually lived with
her family and became a close
friend. In this way. a true coach-ath
lete relationship is new to Tom. and
it's obviously working well for her.
Middle blockers Conrad and
Sandrik once again kept even with
each other for a total of l() blocks
apiece. Outside hitter and middle
blocker Lindsey Yamasaki. a red
shirt freshman, posted a career
high 13 kills and a hitting percent
age of .409 against the Beavers.
Oregon State came out strong
and kept a 7-7 tie in the first game
until the Cardinal blew the team
away with seven straight points,
ending the game 15-7. The Beavers
kept the Stanford squad on its toes
once again when they pulled out to
a 10-5 lead in game two before Stan
ford stepped it up to win in three
straight games.
Yamasaki explained the weak
nesses of the Oregon teams that the
Cardinal was able to capitalize on.
"They just don't have our speed,
and we set the middle more often,
which is a quicker and more diffi
cult set. We are simply more power
ful."
Yamasaki has directed her ef
forts and time this fall almost en
tirely on volleyball, which means
taking time off from practicing for
her other Cardinal sport, basket
ball.
As part of the starting line up for
the women's basketball team last
year, Yamasaki has been keeping
herself prepared for winter by
shooting on her own time between
volleyball and her classes.
"I'm really enjoying volleyball,
but the hardest part is not being
with the [basketball] team day in
and day out. They are all getting
closer without me," Yamasaki said.
