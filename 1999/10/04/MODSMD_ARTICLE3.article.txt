# Student group helps patients SMILE
## 
### Denali DeGraf 
Every day, the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital's
Recreational Therapy clinics treat
many sick and injured children.
As sophomore Charlene Ngsaid,
these children regularly endure "vis

its which are often long, painful and
filled with many hours of waiting."
Ng is one of the leaders of a Stan
ford organization called Project
SMILE (Students Making Illness a
Little Easier), which volunteers in
the clinics' waiting rooms to play
with young patients.

The group is holding an orienta
tion meeting at ft p.m. in the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's I lospital
auditorium.
Project SMILE currently has be
tween 30 and 40 regular volunteers,
each of whom spends two hours per
week at the hospital.

Typically, Ng said, kids have a
difficult time with hospital visits, and
the group's goal is to make the expe
rience as painless as possible.
"We hope that the visitors of the
hospital, whether they are patients
or the siblings of patients, get a more
enjoyable trip to the hospital when
we are there," she said.
1 laving a college student show up
and open the big box of toys would
brighten anyone's day, Ng said, es
pecially for very young children.
Many of the children's clinics are
designated for certain types of pa
tients, such as children with broken
bones or children with leukemia, so
volunteers must deal with children
in splints or with little energy.
If the patients are too sick for any
real activity, entertaining their sib
lings can be just as important in tak
ing the load off the parents, who
benefit from the project almost as
much as their children.
"Basically, the idea is to help par
ents who are too tired to do much,"
said junior Lisa Yiu, one of the
group's leaders.
Like most opportunities involv
ing community service, the volun
teers benefit from the project a great
deal as well.
"The work is great, because it
isn't really work." said Ng. "I get
lessons about Star Wars and Tele
tubbies, as well as how to smile when
the treatment hurts and think quiet
ly when it's time to face a new chal
lenge."
