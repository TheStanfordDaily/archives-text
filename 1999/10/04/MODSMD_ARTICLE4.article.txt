# Oct. 1 deadline passes in silence
## Doubt lingers over troubled hospital group 
### Jennifer Stewart Editorial staff 
Suspense continues for patients, doctors and faculty
members waiting to learn the future of UCSF-Stanford
Health Care.
Last Friday was the self-imposed deadline for Stan
ford University President Gerhard Casper and Universi
ty of California President Richard Atkinson to announce
the future of the merged organization. However, the day
came and went without any word about UCSF-Stanford.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported Friday that the

You can't go back to [before the merger]
with no cost. This would not be a no-cost
divorce.'
— Dr. Lee Goldman
UC Chancellor

chief of each medical school is soliciting input from their
teaching staff before making a final recommendation to
Casper and Atkinson, a process that could take several
weeks.
At the heart of the issue is the future of the merged
UCSF-Stanford organization. Casper and Atkinson
called for a re-assessment of the troubled merger over
the summer, setting Oct. 1 as a deadline.
A reconsideration of the merger leaves open the pos
sibility of restructuring — or dissolving — the two-year
old hospital organization, which lost over $60 million this
year alone. While Casper and Atkinson's recommenda
tion could preserve the merger in its current form, it looks
increasingly likely that the merger will undergo signifi
cant changes.
Officials have already announced several modifica
tions to the merged organization. Management of the or
ganization has been turned over to the I lunter Consult
ing Group, which announced just over a week ago that
the troubled Mount Zion Medical Center will no longer
handle inpatient and emergency-room care. Instead,
those patienKwillbe treated at the UCSF Medical Cen
ter two miles away in Parnassus Heights.
Officials downgraded Mount Zion's services in an at
tempt to limit the How of red ink from the embattled hos
pital. An audit conducted by the California State Sen-
ate's Committee on Government
Oversight found that the majority of
UCSF-Stanford's projected losses
can be traced to the hospital, which
serves a low-income neighborhood of
San Francisco.
Stanford trustees have expressed
concern over the amount of money
lost by UC sites. In a September press
release, the Stanford Board of
Trustees called for site-specific ac
counting and management for UCSF

and Stanford hospitals.
According to the Chronicle, Stan
ford officials want to amend merger
bylaws to limit the UCSF losses Stan
ford has to absorb.
If Stanford succeeds, taxpayers
may have to cover the San Francisco
hospital's shortfall instead.
A dissolution of the merger could
cost Stanford. "You can't go back to
19971 before the merger] with nocost.
This would not be a no-cost divorce,"
said UC Chancellor Dr. Lee Gold
man, a member of the UCSF-Stan
ford board, in an interview with the
Chronicle.
