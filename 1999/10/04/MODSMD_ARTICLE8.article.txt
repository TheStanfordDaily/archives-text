### Marisa Taylor 
In Toyon Hall's second year as an
all-sophomore dorm, residents are
again experiencing opportunities to
bond with their classmates and re
ceive extensive academic support.
This year. Toyon's staff plans to
feature more "refined" academic as
sistance. including advising sopho
mores need to select a major, plan
ning for overseas studies and getting
more focused academic assistance.
The academic programming of
Toyon tends to focus on issues that
particularly apply to sophomores.
Ashok Roddy, a senior and last
year's head academic adviser for
Toyon. said that once students reach
their sophomore year, "they've al
ready been to pre-law and pre-med
panels. They have different needs
than freshmen."
Reddy organized panels featuring
speakers from various Stanford grad
uate schools to give pre-professional
students advice about their studies.
A "major night" was included in
which advisors from 27 departments
were available to talk with students.
Other sessions featured advice about

Undergraduate Research Opportu
nity grants and applying to become
residence staff.
Staff this year are also focusing on
academic advising. Brandon Maugh
an, a current Toyon resident assistant
who also lived there last year, claims
that last year's academic advising was
"stuck between a rock and a hard

place," since programming was in its
inaugural year.
Peer advisors were available to
help students, but they were unpaid
and Maughan said their jobs were
fairly undefined.
Brent Jacobsen, a junior who lived
in Toyon last year, added that there
were "too many superfluous pro

grams. Sometimes other sophomore
are better to talk to."
This year, paid residential sopho
more advisors are designated to help
students in specific academic areas,
namely the social and natural sci
ences, humanities and engineering.
"ITiey've done a fantastic job; of
getting together programs," Maugh
an said.
Other features of Toyon are;at
tractive also, students said.
"There are a lot of recreational
things to do around the dorm, if you
have the time," said sophomore Ptiul
Davison, current Toyon resident,'*
Sarah Smith, a Toyon RA,. siiid
that this year's residents are '"ah "ac
tive group, who want to have lots of
fun. Socially, we find things that the
residents want to do. 11 varies with the
house each year."
Last year's residents gave, the
dorm high marks with regards toils
single class status.
"I really enjoyed Toyon a lot,'>Ja
cobsen said. "I think that it's a great
way to beat the sophomore slump be
cause you get to meet a lot of other
sophomores. Your world is still grow
ing and expanding."
