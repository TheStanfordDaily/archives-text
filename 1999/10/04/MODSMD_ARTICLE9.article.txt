## 
### Carly Schneider 
Tonight, pre-law undergraduates will get a
chance to explore their career interests at the first
meeting of the Stanford Pre-Law Society at 6 p.m.
in building 160-161 K.
This new, student-led organization hopes to
draw students with a variety of interests and majors
and give them a support base broader than sug
gested curriculum guidelines at the Undergraduate
Advising Center.
The group's goal is "to provide Stanford stu
dents with access to opportunities which haven't
been available before," said senior Monica Mange,
the society's president. "The students will play a
tremendous part in the direction of the society."
The society plans to provide interested students
with support in choosing courses, taking the LSAT
and looking at career opportunities. To help stu
dents i>et a closer look at futures in law. the soci

ety's organizers envision a series of guo&i speakers
and workshops with Stanford law students and
professors.
The student response so far has been very posi
tive. Mange said. Over 1(H) students signed up for
the society at MuFuUnSun.
Additionally, other law-oriented organizations
are pleased with the extra stability and support,
said sophomore Diane Boudalis. treasurer of the
Mock Trial Team.
"Unlike other universities, Stanford doesn't
have a pre-law core curriculum to focus on," she
said, "st> undergrads interested in pursuing law
have no real bond. 1 laving a group to unify and
focus those varied interests is a great idea.
"Also, 1 think it will give some direction to in
terested students who don't currently have many
resources available to them." she added.
The pre-law society's vice president, Vikram
Kumar, a sophomore majoring in engineering, said

the different interests and majors of pre-law stu
dents at Stanford are a great strength.
Some activities planned so far include the."Pa
cific Pre-Law Conference in November, where
students can get information about programs,
scholarships and applications from over 60 Caw
schools. "
Tonight's meeting will provide information
about the society and recruit potential officers.-;
Mange and sophomores Kumar and Nick Lar
son. also a club vice president, said they seek rep
resentation from all classes. There is even a fresh
man position on the Executive Board.
Also at the meeting will be guest speakers»tiaw
Prof. Lawrence Friedman and Amber Garza, a £u
dent at the Law School who works on pre-;kiw
guidelines at the U AC.
Larson encouraged students of all interests and
majors to come, whether they are set on law school
or just remotely curious.
