## CNBC 'power brunches' on the Farm 
### Scott Dorfman Contributing writer 
When regular viewers ol
CNBC's "Power Lunch" financial
news program tuned in to yester
day's broadcast, what they saw was
anything but business as usual.
The normal newsroom back
ground had been replaced by sun
shine and palm trees, and the typi
cal instrumental lead-in music was
supplanted by L.L. Cool J's "Goin'
Back to Cali." The picture was un
mistakable: CNBC had come to
Stanford.
As the first stop of a week-long
tour of Silicon Valley by CNBC's
"Power Lunch." Stanford became
both the setting and the focus of
Monday's broadcast.
The two-hour program, re
named "Power Brunch" in honor
of the West Coast time difference,
chose Stanford because of its repu
tation as a "breeding ground for
leaders in the fields of law, engi
neering, computer programming
and finance," host Bill Griffeth said
in an interview with the Daily on
Friday.
Monday's broadcast featured a
number of Stanford students, pro
fessors and graduates speaking
about both their experiences at
Stanford and the role that Silicon
Valley is playing in the modern
economy.
"Stanford has a great model and
way of teaching entrepreneur
ship," said E-Loan CEO Chris
Larscn. who received his MBA
from the Graduate School of Busi

ness in 1991.
Excite@Home Co-Founder Joe
Kraus spoke of the opportunities
Stanford gives for networking with
other potential entrepreneurs, re
laying the story of how he and five
friends from Stanford coneeived the
idea for Excite@Home over a meal
at Rosita's, a Palo Alto restaurant.
Stories such as Kraus's have led
to a myth about Stanford students
that was repeatedly asserted bv

Griffeth, namely that students are
more interested in networking and
starting a "dot-com" business than
actually obtaining a degree.
Students and administrators ap
pearing on the program dismissed
the allegation.
"I'm not looking just to start up
a company; Business School is
about exploring every option possi
ble." said GSB student David Doc
torovv, who added that only one

student from last year has not re
turned to school.
"Not many come just to net
work. most come to get a degree,"
said David Brady, assistant dean of
the Business School. "But in the
process of summer jobs and meet
ing people in Silicon Valley, they
are tempted sometimes to go else
where before graduation."

CNBC shot its financial news program "Power Lunch," hosted by Bill Griffeth, yesterday at the Graduate
School of Business.
In addition, many GSB gradu
ates ponder taking the hard road of
starting a business over the assur
ance of big money and signing
bonuses with large firms. "I council
them to take a chance while they
are still young," Brady said.
Griffeth said Silicon Valley is
such an incredible success story be
cause, "money, technology and
brains all seem to have converged

in this one area. To start a success
ful eompany, two things are need
ed: money and ideas. Silicon Val
ley has an abundance of both."
Griffeth said that CNBC is in
town this week to view the tech
nologies behind the new "dot
com" businesses being so actively
traded on Wall Street, hopefully
showing viewers "the convergence
between these new technologies
and the world of finance. Wall
Street is still where the IPOs take
place, but a lot of the action and
deals are going on right here."
