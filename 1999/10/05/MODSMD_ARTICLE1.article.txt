## CNBC 'power brunches' on the Farm 
### Scott Dorfman Contributing writer 
When regular viewers ol
CNBC's "Power Lunch" financial
news program tuned in to yester
day's broadcast, what they saw was
anything but business as usual.
The normal newsroom back
ground had been replaced by sun
shine and palm trees, and the typi
cal instrumental lead-in music was
supplanted by L.L. Cool J's "Goin'
Back to Cali." The picture was un
mistakable: CNBC had come to
Stanford.
As the first stop of a week-long
tour of Silicon Valley by CNBC's
"Power Lunch." Stanford became
both the setting and the focus of
Monday's broadcast.
The two-hour program, re
named "Power Brunch" in honor
of the West Coast time difference,
chose Stanford because of its repu
tation as a "breeding ground for
leaders in the fields of law, engi
neering, computer programming
and finance," host Bill Griffeth said
in an interview with the Daily on
Friday.
Monday's broadcast featured a
number of Stanford students, pro
fessors and graduates speaking
about both their experiences at
Stanford and the role that Silicon
Valley is playing in the modern
economy.
"Stanford has a great model and
way of teaching entrepreneur
ship," said E-Loan CEO Chris
Larscn. who received his MBA
from the Graduate School of Busi

ness in 1991.
Excite@Home Co-Founder Joe
Kraus spoke of the opportunities
Stanford gives for networking with
other potential entrepreneurs, re
laying the story of how he and five
friends from Stanford coneeived the
idea for Excite@Home over a meal
at Rosita's, a Palo Alto restaurant.
Stories such as Kraus's have led
to a myth about Stanford students
that was repeatedly asserted bv

Griffeth, namely that students are
more interested in networking and
starting a "dot-com" business than
actually obtaining a degree.
Students and administrators ap
pearing on the program dismissed
the allegation.
"I'm not looking just to start up
a company; Business School is
about exploring every option possi
ble." said GSB student David Doc
torovv, who added that only one

student from last year has not re
turned to school.
"Not many come just to net
work. most come to get a degree,"
said David Brady, assistant dean of
the Business School. "But in the
process of summer jobs and meet
ing people in Silicon Valley, they
are tempted sometimes to go else
where before graduation."
