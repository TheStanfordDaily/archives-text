## Editor's Notebook Rethinking requirements 
### 
A Daily Editor pon
ders the logistics of
Area One

THROUGHOUT elementary
school, I thought that college
was the place where people
went to pore over books that had
evolved into classics over the
decades and centuries.
ITiis naive view evolved as I pro
gressed through junior high and high
school and realized that college per
mitted the pursuit of any academic
interest. I anxiously awaited both the
freedom in choosing classes and the
variety of classes that universities
and colleges would offer me.
1 found my perception of college
checked yet again when a package
arrived in the mail from Stanford
filled with information about the
three tracks they offered to freshmen
to fulfill the "Area One require
ment."
Requirements? What happened to
selecting classes that I considered
interesting, until I discovered what I
wanted to major in?
My initial revulsion to the idea of
being forced to take classes that the
University considered important
subsided as I read over the reading
lists for some of them. For I discov
ered that they contained the books
that I originally thought everyone
had to read in college and that I had
always wanted to read. I checked off
my first three choices (all in the
Introduction to the Humanities
track) and awaited my assignment.
My excitement over receiving my
first choice was tempered when I
read over the Bulletin, specifically
when I read over the information it

provided on fulfilling requirements
throughout the undergraduate years.
All the other areas, minus Writing
and Critical Thinking, differ greatly
from the Area One requirement.
For one, they do not have to be
fulfilled in the freshman year. Seeing
that undergraduates are supposed to
declare a major by the end of their
sophomore year, it would be prefer
able to spend the time up until then
taking classes specifically in the areas
you're interested in as opposed to
having precious units sapped up by
requirements.
Another advantage that the other
Areas have over Area One is that the
classes that fulfill them weren't creat
ed specifically for fulfilling require
ments and thus enroll students from
all classes and all disciplines. This
allows for a broad range of perspec
tives on course material to be
exchanged.
Hie range of classes that the other
Areas offer students for fulfilling
their general education requirements
(GERs) increases the chance that
students will find a class they want to
take and subsequently will be really
interested in.
The Area One requirement would
have been less tedious to fulfill if I
had had the opportunity to fulfill it
when I wanted to and with classes
already offered in the Humanities
that I found scintillating.
Stanford's GERs are an integral
part of the undergraduate experi
ence that allow for a well-rounded
and comprehensive education. The
University should continue to strive
to make them interesting and unte
dious to students.
