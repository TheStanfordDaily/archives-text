# Campus viewpoint
## Looking past traditional perspectives

Romahlo I. Wilson

One day I'll stare down the masses...
To the students of Stanford Uni
versity:
Each year a number of young men and
women pass through this University with
life's light in their eyes. They stare, and won
der, and learn; and then they leave. Their
light altered by their experiences here. It is
this alteration that I choose to question.
You see Stanford is Stanford, and life is
life, and one does not imitate the other so
much as one encompasses. The problem of
which I speak is perspective, perspective
given and perspective denied; and it's a
problem that Stanford encounters through
every waking moment. In relation to the
former, Stanford can only offer you one
perspective; and though it is not explicitly
spoken of, as an institution it denies you
many.
The biggest mistake one makes upon
entering is the assumption that this place can
offer you a reflection of life's multiplicity.
It's a mistake often overlooked, but one
upon which the world is daily lost. Stanford
is a microcosm, not one of the world, but of
experience. To treat it otherwise is to adopt
the attitude of a culled aristocracy. It is to
look down without bothering to look out, to
focus singularly without a thought as to larg
er implications of one's actions.
It has oftentimes been my greatest frus
tration that my peers and I have been
trained to inherit the world. On the basest
level it is a simple transfer of control from
generation to generation, taken further, an
acknowledgment of our potential stations in
life. Generations have established this
world's hierarchy, and as a result of our life
paths we stand to benefit from it. Beyond
these two however, that we stand to inherit
the world is itself an investment of hope.
An investment of hope that asks that
power and influence be used responsibly.
One that asks that power and influence be
wielded in the name of the world, and not
individuals. One that asks that power and
influence be wielded in the name of com
passion.
Look around you. Everywhere in this
finite place you will find it. You will see it in
the form of well-landscaped lawns, or
designer suits, or perhaps an equation you
have or will come to know well: CPA x
Major = $. This is not a judgment, there is
much to be said for individual happiness. It
is merely an acknowledgment of the social
norms that stare us in the face. Social norms
we ourselves have come to accept as our
own. It is this alteration I wish to question:
knowledge, not our GPAs are the true mea
sure of our learning, and power and influ
ence used in the pursuit of an empty infinity
can not be the purpose of life.
Perhaps this statement arrives as a result
of my own individual need to believe, and
this I readily accept, but I wish to take this

inquiry even further. For those of you
who've chosen to come here, I would ask
you the reasons why? And when you've
answered I ask that you look around, and
see outside of those reasons. Man runs back
to nature because it offers him a multiplicity
of perspective that his creations deny, man
runs to his creations because they offer him
a focusing of perspective that nature can
not. Stanford is a creation of man with just
this property. I ask you to look around
because these realizations may be processed
through the eyes.
Stanford asks that you focus your eyes to
a narrow point; it will never be explicitly
stated, but it is a property built into mortar
and stone and buildings and cultivated
minds. I ask that you stare upon life's multi
plicity. That you look into the eyes of your
fellow students and see their reflections in
you; that you look outside this campus and
see the unleashing of social forces in the
community beyond; that you look outside
this community to a world of such commu
nities, a world that is rent as it tries to build
stability. Perspective is what will separate
failure from success, buying into static ones
of utility can only spell the former.
I've been asked to stand behind my
words, so here I stand. I will not pretend my
beliefs are right or wrong, though 1 will ever
place myself beside them as my own tenets
of truth. They are however a perspective in
a world filled with perspectives. What they
are not is a judgement of absolutes. I believe
that we all live perspectives and they arc
defined within the potentiality of being
human. I believe that these perspectives
have been molded by the past, and in this
way I'm not unique. I believe, that in today's
world, these perspectives move towards a
false uniformity, and nowhere is it more evi
dent than in our academic institutions. You
will find it perpetuated here at Stanford,
perhaps Stanford itself is a continuation of
what you already believe. This uniform per
spective that the world moves toward is the
cult of personal success; and it has shadowed
human potential for centuries.
Already 1 feel the reaction against my
words as if they judge unfairly, as if they
judge those who believe in personal success.
They don't. They challenge. We inhabit a
world in a universe we don't understand,
whether it has been given to us or won for
humanity is of little import. The fact of the
matter is we shape its reality. We do it every
day in our personal decisions, in our collec
tive mentalities, in our silent interactions.
She suffers as we inflict suffering, and she
lives as we bestow life. Humanity is now the
instrument of her actualization; all of
humanity. The cult of personal success
takes this confusion and an inherent fear of
the unknown and transforms it into a false
truth. It tells you that in a world grown too
large, you are your sole concern. The things

you may have, the possibilities you live, the
people you come across, they're all pro
cessed through this homogenous perspec
tive; and once again I ask that you look
around you, and look outside yourselves.
Everyday storehouses of crops are burnt
for the sake of economic stability, people
suffer. The world's resources are in the
hands of a few, the world's three richest men
control more resources than 550 million
people inhabiting 41 of the world's poorest
nations, people suffer. Everyday children
are taught to emulate these three men, peo
ple suffer. Everyday we sit in this place and
believe in the attainment or maintenance of
some imaginary bar, people suffer. We
believe that by becoming "responsible"
affluent members of our society we attain a
level of enlightenment allowing us to shape
the possibilities of the rest of humanity.
Don't fool yourself, our decisions here spell
the suffering of many.
These are not noted for the sake of guilt
or judgement or any such useless prospect.
The reasons behind these decisions and
actualities can be rationalized away until the
end of time. I note them as part of the chal
lenge. If you believe that systems of eco
nomics are the key to humanity's advance
ment, make one whose stability does not
depend upon wrenching food from the
mouths of those who starve. It is a challenge
to make the world a better place by the force
of your actions, not your claims. You can
ever sit behind the false security that Stan
ford and "personal success" offers but it's no
true conception of the world. Nowhere have
I encountered a people more closed off from
life's possibilities under false pretenses of
being right, than I have among the ruling
classes.
This is a perspective that has perhaps
never been brought up in any of our school
ing and I'm willing to wager never will. Insti
tutions will narrow your perspectives for the
sake of utility. I would ask that you widen
them for the sake of humanity. If you are
truly the future leaders of the world, I'd
have you see that conventional success is a
sinister truth; one leads from above, when
the world needs you to lead from below.
The world needs you to recognize those
we've made faceless, and give them life.
Look into the face of any child who suffers
and asks yourself what will separate them
from your children, look into the faces of
your peers who suffer and ask yourself what
separates them from you, look into the faces
of the elderly who suffer and ask yourself
what separates them from your parents or
grandparents. The answer is nothing; but I
haven't the power to make you believe, that
you must do for yourself. I merely ask that
you look.
As long as humanity paints life as a
machine, I will rage against it. As long as
humanity remains, so will 1...

actualities can be rationalized away until the
end of time. I note them as part of the chal
lenge. If you believe that systems of eco
nomics are the key to humanity's advance
ment, make one whose stability does not
depend upon wrenching food from the
mouths of those who starve. It is a challenge
to make the world a better place by the force
of your actions, not your claims. You can
ever sit behind the false security that Stan
ford and "personal success" offers but it's no
true conception of the world. Nowhere have
I encountered a people more closed off from
life's possibilities under false pretenses of
being right, than I have among the ruling
classes.
This is a perspective that has perhaps
never been brought up in any of our school
ing and I'm willing to wager never will. Insti
tutions will narrow your perspectives for the
sake of utility. I would ask that you widen
them for the sake of humanity. If you are
truly the future leaders of the world, I'd
have you see that conventional success is a
sinister truth; one leads from above, when
the world needs you to lead from below.
The world needs you to recognize those
we've made faceless, and give them life.
Look into the face of any child who suffers
and asks yourself what will separate them
from your children, look into the faces of
your peers who suffer and ask yourself what
separates them from you, look into the faces
of the elderly who suffer and ask yourself
what separates them from your parents or
grandparents. The answer is nothing; but I
haven't the power to make you believe, that
you must do for yourself. I merely ask that
you look.

One day I'll stare down the masses...
To the students of Stanford Uni
versity:
Each year a number of young men and
women pass through this University with
life's light in their eyes. They stare, and won
der, and learn; and then they leave. Their
light altered by their experiences here. It is
this alteration that I choose to question.
You see Stanford is Stanford, and life is
life, and one does not imitate the other so
much as one encompasses. The problem of
which I speak is perspective, perspective
given and perspective denied; and it's a
problem that Stanford encounters through
every waking moment. In relation to the
former, Stanford can only offer you one
perspective; and though it is not explicitly
spoken of, as an institution it denies you
many.
The biggest mistake one makes upon
entering is the assumption that this place can
offer you a reflection of life's multiplicity.
It's a mistake often overlooked, but one
upon which the world is daily lost. Stanford
is a microcosm, not one of the world, but of
experience. To treat it otherwise is to adopt
the attitude of a culled aristocracy. It is to
look down without bothering to look out, to
focus singularly without a thought as to larg
er implications of one's actions.
It has oftentimes been my greatest frus
tration that my peers and I have been
trained to inherit the world. On the basest
level it is a simple transfer of control from
generation to generation, taken further, an
acknowledgment of our potential stations in
life. Generations have established this
world's hierarchy, and as a result of our life
paths we stand to benefit from it. Beyond
these two however, that we stand to inherit
the world is itself an investment of hope.
An investment of hope that asks that
power and influence be used responsibly.
One that asks that power and influence be
wielded in the name of the world, and not
individuals. One that asks that power and
influence be wielded in the name of com
passion.
Look around you. Everywhere in this
finite place you will find it. You will see it in
the form of well-landscaped lawns, or
designer suits, or perhaps an equation you
have or will come to know well: CPA x
Major = $. This is not a judgment, there is
much to be said for individual happiness. It
is merely an acknowledgment of the social
norms that stare us in the face. Social norms
we ourselves have come to accept as our
own. It is this alteration I wish to question:
knowledge, not our GPAs are the true mea
sure of our learning, and power and influ
ence used in the pursuit of an empty infinity
can not be the purpose of life.
Perhaps this statement arrives as a result
of my own individual need to believe, and
this I readily accept, but I wish to take this

inquiry even further. For those of you
who've chosen to come here, I would ask
you the reasons why? And when you've
answered I ask that you look around, and
see outside of those reasons. Man runs back
to nature because it offers him a multiplicity
of perspective that his creations deny, man
runs to his creations because they offer him
a focusing of perspective that nature can
not. Stanford is a creation of man with just
this property. I ask you to look around
because these realizations may be processed
through the eyes.
Stanford asks that you focus your eyes to
a narrow point; it will never be explicitly
stated, but it is a property built into mortar
and stone and buildings and cultivated
minds. I ask that you stare upon life's multi
plicity. That you look into the eyes of your
fellow students and see their reflections in
you; that you look outside this campus and
see the unleashing of social forces in the
community beyond; that you look outside
this community to a world of such commu
nities, a world that is rent as it tries to build
stability. Perspective is what will separate
failure from success, buying into static ones
of utility can only spell the former.
I've been asked to stand behind my
words, so here I stand. I will not pretend my
beliefs are right or wrong, though 1 will ever
place myself beside them as my own tenets
of truth. They are however a perspective in
a world filled with perspectives. What they
are not is a judgement of absolutes. I believe
that we all live perspectives and they arc
defined within the potentiality of being
human. I believe that these perspectives
have been molded by the past, and in this
way I'm not unique. I believe, that in today's
world, these perspectives move towards a
false uniformity, and nowhere is it more evi
dent than in our academic institutions. You
will find it perpetuated here at Stanford,
perhaps Stanford itself is a continuation of
what you already believe. This uniform per
spective that the world moves toward is the
cult of personal success; and it has shadowed
human potential for centuries.
Already 1 feel the reaction against my
words as if they judge unfairly, as if they
judge those who believe in personal success.
They don't. They challenge. We inhabit a
world in a universe we don't understand,
whether it has been given to us or won for
humanity is of little import. The fact of the
matter is we shape its reality. We do it every
day in our personal decisions, in our collec
tive mentalities, in our silent interactions.
She suffers as we inflict suffering, and she
lives as we bestow life. Humanity is now the
instrument of her actualization; all of
humanity. The cult of personal success
takes this confusion and an inherent fear of
the unknown and transforms it into a false
truth. It tells you that in a world grown too
large, you are your sole concern. The things

you may have, the possibilities you live, the
people you come across, they're all pro
cessed through this homogenous perspec
tive; and once again I ask that you look
around you, and look outside yourselves.
Everyday storehouses of crops are burnt
for the sake of economic stability, people
suffer. The world's resources are in the
hands of a few, the world's three richest men
control more resources than 550 million
people inhabiting 41 of the world's poorest
nations, people suffer. Everyday children
are taught to emulate these three men, peo
ple suffer. Everyday we sit in this place and
believe in the attainment or maintenance of
some imaginary bar, people suffer. We
believe that by becoming "responsible"
affluent members of our society we attain a
level of enlightenment allowing us to shape
the possibilities of the rest of humanity.
Don't fool yourself, our decisions here spell
the suffering of many.
These are not noted for the sake of guilt
or judgement or any such useless prospect.
The reasons behind these decisions and
actualities can be rationalized away until the
end of time. I note them as part of the chal
lenge. If you believe that systems of eco
nomics are the key to humanity's advance
ment, make one whose stability does not
depend upon wrenching food from the
mouths of those who starve. It is a challenge
to make the world a better place by the force
of your actions, not your claims. You can
