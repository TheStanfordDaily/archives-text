so do preparations tor the Stanford
Viennese Ball.
The Hyatt Regency San Francis
co Airport- in Burlingame will host
the formal ball, modeled after tradi
tional Viennese Balls of the early
19th century, from S p.m. to 2 a.m.
on March 3.
Organizers expect about I.(KK)
students, faculty, staff and alumni to
attend, roughly the same number as
last year's turnout.
Like last year's sold-out event,
the ball will feature live music in two
ballrooms, one for waltz and one for
swing. Swing Solutions will return,
joined by a new. local orchestra,
Brassworks.
The night will also feature pre
sentations of honored guests and
waltz and swing competitions. The
Opening Committee will perform
waltz and polka, in addition to per
formances by Danse Libre, the
Stanford Vintage Dance Ensemble
and a ballet group.
Organizers have named the
week prior to the ball "Austria
Week."
"The purpose of the week," said
steering committee member Han
nah Goldie, a senior, "is to bring the
spirit of Vienna to Stanford."
Activities generally include a
Masquerade Ball and a Polka Ball,
dance lessons and various sorts of
cultural food that go along with
early 19th-century Vienna. "We are
trying to make fun learning experi
ences," Goldie said.
All of the events offer a chance to
learn basic dance steps, and none of
the lessons are cumulative. The ac
tivities are open to all ticket holders.
Last year, tickets cost $75 per
student couple and $90 per couple
for faculty, staff and alumni. Orga
nizers hope to keep the tickets in the
same price range this year. Tickets

should go on sale in mid-February,
and based on previous years, should
sell out quickly.
The annual dance draws a wide
variety of abilities. "For some peo
ple." Goldie said, "it is their first
dance experience. Other people
dance all of the time."
Only 350 students attended the
lirst Viennese Ball — which Stanford
in Austria students started in 1977 —

in Toyon Hall. The following year
the ball moved to Roble Gym.
Its popularity increased so much
over the years that dance-goers had
difficulties obtaining tickets. People
began to camp out overnight and. as

In 1998, in the hopes of making
the event open to more members of
the Stanford community, the ball
moved off campus to the Hyatt
Riekeys and, last year, to the Hyatt
Regency San Francisco Airport.
The Viennese Ball Committee
will hold auditions on Oct. 9 and
Oct. 13 for the Opening Committee.
