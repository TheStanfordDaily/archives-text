# 70 blue-light specials, to go
## University expands number of emergency phones 
### Derek Fears 
Stanford's fleet of emergency
phones, which administrators al
ready call a campus safety success,
will increase 50 percent by next
summer.
The blue-light phones alert po
lice of impending emergencies with
the push of a red button. Equipped
with a speaker and locator device,
the phones allow victims who are
unable to speak to call for help.
The program to build the
phones originated three years ago
when then-ASSIJ President Bill
Shen pushed for an increase in
campus safety. Since then, 48
phones have been installed.
But the University does not plan
to stop there. Dan Smith, special
services manager at the Depart
ment of Public Safety, said admin
istrators hope to have a total of 70
operational phones by the summer
of 20(H).
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said he is "delighted that the Uni
versity is continuing to increase the
number of phones."
The public safety department is
in its third and last phone installa
tion phase, one that begins this
quarter. Though the phones were
initially set up on only the most
widely used routes on campus, they
now encompass a broader area.
The phones can be found from
Palm Drive to areas along Campus
Drive and around the sports facili
ties such as Stanford Stadium and
Ford Center.
Plans for the third phase include
the installation of phones in and
around the Main Quad and other
core areas of campus.
Wais estimated that each phone
costs between $15,000-$20,000 to
install. "However, you can't put a
price on safety," he said.
Though the project is costing the
University upward of $350,000 per
phase, Wais said the lights are an

important aspect of campus safety
because they "serve as a deterrent
from crime in a University that is
not isolated from the outside
world."
Smith said the program has been
a success because "the phones have
been respected, solely being used
for emergency situations."
He also noted that occasionally

witnesses use the phones to report
a bicycle or automobile accident.
However, the bulk of the calls in
volve students reporting suspicious
people in and around campus.
Though the phones offer a great
deal, some campus leaders said
they cannot be viewed as a finite re

phones on campus.
