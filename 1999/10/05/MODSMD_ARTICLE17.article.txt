## Women flatten 'Bama, Evansville Strong nonconference showing highlights Santa Clara Invite 
### Lori Maund Contributing writer 
The No. 17 Stanford women's
soccer team will enter Pacific 10 Con
ference play with confidence next
weekend, and a lot of it, after breez
ing through the Santa Clara Invita
tional last weekend.
The Cardinal (7-3) beat Alabama
3-0 Friday and Evansville 3-1 Sunday
in nonconference play.
"This weekend gave us a lot of re
assurance," senior co-captain Jenny
O'Sullivan said. "Two wins this
weekend were exactly what we need
ed going into the Pac-lOs."
Although two victories against
unranked teams might not seem like
much of a feat for the Cardinal this
season, the wins came against oppo
nents fighting for more than just re
spect. A win this weekend against the
nationally ranked Stanford squad
could have been enough to guaran
tee a postseason berth in the NC A A
tournament.
"Alabama was the kind of team
where this game could make their
season," head coach Steve Swanson
said. "We came out and faced an en
thusiastic and energetic team, giving
it their all to win."
And the Cardinal responded to
the challenge with enough vigor to
quell the Crimson Tide.
The first goal for Stanford came
when junior midfielder Erin Maurer
collected a pass on the Hank from

freshman Allyson Marquand. Maur
er crossed the ball to senior Casey
Bernard, who stood with her back
facing the goal. Without an angle to
score, Bernard headed the ball back
to freshman Becky Myers, who
scored on a header of her own.
"It was a brilliant goal," Swanson
said. "We were in command. We
played awfully well [against Alaba
ma], and we had a lot of good perfor
mances from a lot of people."
The Cardinal can also be confi
dent about its depth as it approaches
Pac-1() play. A stellar recruiting class
has allowed Stanford the advantage
of substituting more frequently dur
ing the game without compromising
the quality of play on the field.
Reserve players Maurer, Bernard
and Myers demonstrated this depth
as they combined to make a signifi
cant offensive contribution last
weekend. Myers, the Cardinal's
leading scorer to date, notched two
more goals this weekend.
"Becky has really been playing re
ally well," O'Sullivan said. "She has
added a lot to our [offensive] game
when she comes in."
The remaining two goals came
from freshman striker Marcia Wallis,
assisted by Marquand and O'Sulli
van.

dinal scoring spree likely would have
exceeded three goals. The 3-0 victory
doesn't seem to reflect the pounding
Alabama received, as the Cardinal
outshot the Tide 27-3.
On Sunday, the Cardinal came
away with a win against Evansville,
jumping to an early 2-0 lead 20 min
utes into the game. The goals for the
day came from Wallis — her third of
the weekend — Myers and senior
Kelly Adamson.
Despite the win. the Cardinal was
not entirely satisfied with its level of
play.
"We had a lot of great individual
performances, but as a team, we
didn't live up to our potential."
Swanson said. "There are still some
things we need to work on, but it is al
ways good to learn a lesson on a win."
Alter the two wins this weekend,
the Cardinal is ready to launch into
conference play away from home
next weekend against Oregon and
()regon State.
"We're ready to win next week
end." O'Sullivan said. "We haven't
won the Pac-10 sinee our freshman
year and something tells me that this
is it. this year we are going to win the
Pac-10."
