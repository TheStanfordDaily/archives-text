# Pruning the Ivy: Soccer takes out Harvard, Dartmouth
## Coach Clark leads men's squad past Crimson and Green in key nonconference wins 
### Meghan O'Connor Staff writer 
Sophomore midfielder Derek Shanahan didn't even
give Dartmouth fans time to yell "Go Big Green" before
he rilled a pass from junior forward Corey Woolfolk into
the hack of the net during the first 43 seconds of play on
Sunday afternoon.
Three goals and 90 minutes later, Stanford had cap
tured not only its first win over Dartmouth under coach
Bobby Clark, but also the Stanford Nike Invitational title.
The early goal by Shanahan made amends for the 25
shots that the Cardinal bounced off goalposts or skirted
just past the netting during Friday night's game against
Harvard. Though marred by missed chances, sophomore
defender Lee Morrison put an end to a frustrating night
with a decisive game-winning shot off an assist by junior
forward Luke Rust with four minutes to play.
Harvard, Stanford's first match of the tournament, was

"a test of perseverance," Rust said.
"We were really hammering at Ihem for a lot of the
game, but nothing was going in the back of the net. I
thought that the team showed a great amount of character
to keep pushing right to the end of the game, and it finally
ended up paying off."
"The team's starting to click." senior goalkeeper
Adam Zapala said. "We valued the ball in the first half
better than in games previously. The strikers received
balls very well and were getting good service from the out
side backs, which allowed us to get in behind the defense."
Despite the Cardinal's clear domination on the attack,
outshooting the Crimson 26-6, the efforts of the defense
can not be overlooked. The game could have been a dif
ferent story had Harvard capitalized on a penalty kick op
portunity in the first half. However, Zapala denied Har
vard's leading scorer, Armando Petruccelli. with a diving
save to keep Stanford in the game.
"In the first half we were exceptionally strong," Clark

said. "But even when you're dominating, teams of this cal
iber are always libel to break away and score. Zapala had
two great saves and the defense kept good concentra
tion."
The team effort paid off and the win put Stanford in
good position to capture the tournament title.
"There aren't any easy games in Division I, you just
hope you can keep your discipline and shape for 90 min
utes," Zapala said. "Overall that's probably the best we've
done this year and we're starting to sec results. Other re
sults will follow."
And indeed other successful results for the Cardinal
have already begun to show, as evidenced from Sunday's
game against Dartmouth. Again, Stanford dominated the
game, this time outshooting its opponent 22-6. Any trou
ble they had finishing against Harvard was corrected by
Sunday as the men cruised to a 4-0 victory.
One of the greatest catalysts for Cardinal success cer
tainly has to be the timing of its goals that gave the men the

confidence they needed to prevail in the end. Following
the example of Shanahan, junior midfielder Scott Leber
capitalized a minute into the second half on a joint effort
from Woolfolk and redshirt junior forward Brandon
Garinger.
"Getting the early goals takes the pressure off. so we
were able to sit back and knock the ball around. They
were forced to play from behind and because of that they
played right into our game," sophomore midfielder Kevin
Koitz said. "Against Harvard we didn't put away the early
chances, so we had to struggle to find an ice-breaker."
Shanahan and Leber's goals sandwiched a goal headed
in by redshirt junior Chris Gores off an assist from senior
defender Andy Hemmerich. Woolfolk rounded out the
scoring for Stanford as he sped by the Big Green defense
with an assist from Leber and blew a shot past Dartmouth
goalkeeper Ben Gebre-Melulin.
