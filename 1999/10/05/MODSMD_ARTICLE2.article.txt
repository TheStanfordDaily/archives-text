### Katie Leonberger 
Mark Zoback,
the new chair of
the Faculty Sen
ate, has a clearly
defined goal for
this academic
year: raising levels
of discussion.
"I'd like to
make the Faculty

Senate body an open forum for the
discussion of issues on a larger scale
than currently exists within individ
ual departments," he said.
The Faculty Senate chair's tradi
tional responsibilities include lead
ing and moderating Senate proceed
ings while representing the Steering
Committee, which prepares and re
views each agenda and attends to
business items.
Zoback has extensive experience
in faculty and campus leadership.
He served as a member of the Facul
ty Senate and as Chair of the Com
mittee of 15, which fully revised
Stanford's Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard in 1997. He also
served as chair of the geophysics de
partment.
Zoback's colleague, Geophysics
Professor Robert Kovach, said.
"Mark was a fine department chair
man and will do a superb job as
leader of the Academic Senate."
Geophysics Professor Norman
Sleep added that Zoback's adminis
trative abilities, showcased during
the course of geophysics projects
that drill into the earth's crust, will
be helpful in his career as chair of
the Faculty Senate.
Zoback ran for Faculty Senate
chair last spring, losing to Materials
Science Professor John Bravman.
When Bravman was appointed vice
provost for undergraduate educa

tion over the summer, Zoback was
asked to step up from vice-chair to
chair for this year.
In conjunction with his broad
goal of opening up the Senate to
forum discussion. Zoback plans on
identifying a "new subject of interest
to the faculty for discussion at every
meeting."
He said he hopes that this type of
discussion will relieve the faculty of
their tendency to be unaware of oc
currences outside individual depart
ments. Zoback likened this phe
nomenon to "looking through the
keyhole of a door" when surround
ing issues not directly affecting indi
vidual departments tend to get ig
nored.
Zoback said that faculty should
"understand the logic behind all
University actions and proposals to
be effective members of the commu
nity."
Zoback also identified issues he
hopes to delve into over the coming
year, specifically faculty housing
and recruitment and retention of tal
ented young faculty, the recruitment
of women and minority faculty and
issues with student housing and
grading.
As he states his plan "to give fac
ulty the opportunity to make opin
ions known on matters of I Iniversity
business," Zoback said he is anxious
to do as well as he can in his new po
sition.
"It will be lots of work and I will
make mistakes â€” but I'd like to
think I'll look back on this year and
be satisfied." Zoback said.
Zoback. who came to Stanford in
1971 as a graduate student, began
teaching at Stanford in 19X5. In addi
tion to his teaching within the geo
physics department. Zoback served
