# Field Hockey cruises past Cal Poly-SLO
## 
### Ashley Rich Contributing writer 
Already nine games into its sea
son, the Stanford women's field
hockey team (4-5, 3-0 Northern Pa
cific Conference) got a chance to
slow down a bit before the players
leave for a road trip to Philidelphia
next week. Saturday was a day of
amiable competition during the an
nual alumni game, and on Sunday
the Cardinal defeated club team Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo 8-0..
Although it took Stanford until
the last seven minutes of the first half
to score, the pace quickened and 38
shots and eight goals later, the game
was over without a shot on goal by
the Cal Poly Mustangs.
Sophomore forward Erica Swe
sey ignited the spark that began the
barrage of goals with a shot off of a
breakaway with 7:20 left in the half.
Freshman forward Dalinda Banue
los followed with another goal 47
seconds later.
Swesey opened the second half
with a goal off an assist by senior
Julie Gwozdz and finished off the hat
trick several minutes later.
Senior Lindsey Dunagan, the
Cardinal's leading scorer, converted
a pass from freshman Amrit Chima,
who, along with the rest of the defen
sive line, helped improve the score
when they were able to venture up to
the offensive line. With a chance to
play forward, Gwozdz assisted two
goals and scored one off an assist by

Liz Ott. Chima scored unassisted
and sophomore sweeper Melissa
Stai deflected in a shot to end the
game 8-0.
Perhaps this wasn't the best
chance for the Cardinal to show its
skills under pressure, but it did give
the team a chance to switch positions
and experiment with various lineups.
Everyone got playing time in the
game and had a chance to con
tribute. And several team members
had the chance to explore the game
from a different position on the field.
"It was a good way for everyone
to practice working with people they
don't usually play next to." Swesey
said.
These games have been a good
chance for the team to work on
strategies and build confidence as it
heads to Pennsylvania for a week be
fore finishing the NorPac champi
onship.
As the end of the season ap
proaches and playoff rankings begin,
it's important for the team to show
an impressive improvement and
tackle the teams in the NorPac con
ference, because winner of the Nor-
Pac takes on the Atlantic 10champi
on for a berth in the NCAA tourna
ment. As the games become more
important and the Cardinal brings its
record closer to .500. head coach Sh
eryl Johnson is optimistic about the
rest of the season.
"Everyone has been playing real
ly hard and improving. It's great to
sec."
