The Menlo Park Planning Com
mission denounced the draft of Stan
ford's Land Use Plan as too vague at
a meeting last night.
Commission members, who are
allowed to review and comment on
the draft along with counterparts in
Palo Alto and Portola Valley, ex
pressed concerns over parking and
open space.
"Stanford is a community asset to
Stanford. Palo Alto and Menlo Park,
hut the development is directly af
fecting Menlo Park," Menlo Park
City Council member Virginia Bell
said.
Stanford submitted the draft of
the 10-year development plan to
county officials on Sept. 20. It calls
for building 2.780 units of housing
north of Junipero Serra Boulevard
and larger athletic facilities.
The plan also protects open space
on the core campus and leaves 99
percent of the area south of Junipero
Serra as open space.
Menlo Park and Santa Clara
County officials say that the commu
nity plan for University lands in the
county is too vague and ignores the
list of instructions that the county
gave the University.
They want to see the long-term
plan before they will issue Stanford
the permit for development.
"I'here's no zoning-level
specifics, which is a major issue that
both city council and the county

asked for," said Mary Jo Borak. a
Menlo Park City Council member.
"This leaves everyone at a disad
vantage because it's so vague," she
said.
The draft promises to protect the
foothills for 10 years.
"There's no long-term dedication
to open space," Borak said. "If build
ings are around for 50 years, it's only
fair to expect the same commitment
to open space."
Planning commission member
William Wood said that Stanford
needed more restraint in its plans.
"We need to preserve what we
have left of character in this part of
the world and stop us from becoming
too doggone congested." he said.
"More growth, more expansion,
more, more, more, and 1 want to see
some restraint."
Other members addressed possi
bilities the plan neglected.
"Stanford as a whole has the po
tential to provide the impetus and in
fluence on the whole region," com
mission member Toni Stein said.
She added that she wanted to see
Stanford support alternative trans
portation as an example.
According to commission menir
ber Eric Gilbertson. Stanford has
used land well in the past. "Stanford
land use has been very progressive,
setting a mark that cities have yet to
achieve," he said.
"If cities have the same laws of
management, we wouldn't have the
traffic congestion that we do." he
said.
