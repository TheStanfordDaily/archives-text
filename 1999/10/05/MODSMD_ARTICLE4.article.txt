# Student designers plug away at Steamtunnels site without student pictures
## Meetings can't revive online facebook 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
The student designers of a Web site that fea
tured an online Facebook have temporarily
halted their efforts to put Stanford students' pic
tures on the Web without prior consent.
Seniors Aaron Bell, Lawrence Gentilello
and Tuyen Truong — the designers of The
Steamtunnels: Stanford's Underground
(http://steamtunnels.net/) — and members of
the University administration met Sept. 23 to
discuss the possibility of re-establishing the
Facebook component of the site, which had
been shut down the week before at the Univer
sity's request.
Based upon issues of liability. Bell. Gentilel

lo and Truong, known on the Web site by screen
names Drunken Master, DJ Monkey and The
Sultan, respectively, have decided to fold on the
Facebook issue for now. However, they will
continue exploring ways to revive the online
Facebook in a manner that addresses the Uni
versity's concerns of privacy, safety and copy
right.
The issue had been tabled from the previous
week to accommodate the arrival of this year's
freshmen. In the Sept. 23 meeting, the adminis
tration and students hoped to look more closely
at the issues that concerned both parties and,
specifically, the possibility of recreating the
Facebook component of Steamtunnels in a form
that complied with University guidelines.
"The meeting went well," Gentilello said. "It

was well organized, and I felt like we were on a
level playing field this time."
Bell said that, in the first meeting, the admin
istration spoke at length about the temporary
nature of shutting down the Facebook compo
nent of the site.
But he said that in the second meeting the
University's approach had not changed, despite
the designers' cooperation, and that administra
tors were not interested in working with the de
signers to change the situation.
Dean of Students Marc Wais called the meet
ing a "very cordial" one. "[The students)
seemed to understand and agree with our con
cern regarding student privacy and safety." lie
said. "Secondly, we again repeated
the conditions under which the
University would allow them to
generate a Facebook component,
namely prior notification of stu
dents and the submission of origi
nal photos by those students."
One of the University's original
objections to the site's Facebook
component, third after student pri
vacy and safety, was violation of
copyright in the use of the Face
book photos.
The site's designers initially
questioned this concern, arguing
that only the format of a compila
tion such as the Facebook can be
copyrighted and, furthermore, that
the photos were the individual prop
erty of the students who submitted
them and not the University's.
In order to address these ques
tions, the University brought a
copyright lawyer to the second
meeting.
"[She] knew her stuff and

brought up a technicality that we
were unfamiliar with," Gentilello
said. "[She] said that the publisher
adjusted the tones, lightness and
brightness of the pictures, which
thereby imparted a thread of pro
prietary content into the photos.
This sounded valid."
Despite the loss of the site's
Facebook component, Steamtun
nels still includes a trance-techno
radio station, a restaurant guide
and a comparison textbook shop
per.
Wais emphasized the viability
of the site in its current form, say
ing the University was impressed
with the designers' concept.
"It is my belief that the students
who developed this Web site were
well-intentioned in trying to pro
vide Stanford students with a use
ful tool in assessing information
about fellow students and commu
nity resources, such as local restau
rants," Wais said. "I have found
the Web site to be interesting, lun
and informative. It has the poten
tial to be another great resource of
information for our students."
