# Student designers plug away at Steamtunnels site without student pictures
## Meetings can't revive online facebook 
### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
The student designers of a Web site that fea
tured an online Facebook have temporarily
halted their efforts to put Stanford students' pic
tures on the Web without prior consent.
Seniors Aaron Bell, Lawrence Gentilello
and Tuyen Truong — the designers of The
Steamtunnels: Stanford's Underground
(http://steamtunnels.net/) — and members of
the University administration met Sept. 23 to
discuss the possibility of re-establishing the
Facebook component of the site, which had
been shut down the week before at the Univer
sity's request.
Based upon issues of liability. Bell. Gentilel

lo and Truong, known on the Web site by screen
names Drunken Master, DJ Monkey and The
Sultan, respectively, have decided to fold on the
Facebook issue for now. However, they will
continue exploring ways to revive the online
Facebook in a manner that addresses the Uni
versity's concerns of privacy, safety and copy
right.
The issue had been tabled from the previous
week to accommodate the arrival of this year's
freshmen. In the Sept. 23 meeting, the adminis
tration and students hoped to look more closely
at the issues that concerned both parties and,
specifically, the possibility of recreating the
Facebook component of Steamtunnels in a form
that complied with University guidelines.
"The meeting went well," Gentilello said. "It

was well organized, and I felt like we were on a
level playing field this time."
Bell said that, in the first meeting, the admin
istration spoke at length about the temporary
nature of shutting down the Facebook compo
nent of the site.
But he said that in the second meeting the
University's approach had not changed, despite
the designers' cooperation, and that administra
tors were not interested in working with the de
signers to change the situation.
Dean of Students Marc Wais called the meet
ing a "very cordial" one. "[The students)
seemed to understand and agree with our con
cern regarding student privacy and safety." lie
