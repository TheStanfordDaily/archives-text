# PCs force Macs from Stanford dorm rooms

Computers are Hooding the Stan
ford campus, and more than ever,
they are PCs instead of Macs.
Residential Computing's Net
work and Systems Administrator
Ethan Rikleen estimates that five
years ago, about 90 percent of Stan
ford students owned Macintoshes.
That fraction has now dropped to be
tween one-fourth and one-third.
This trend comes in the face of
several subtle pressures on campus
favoring Macs and the enormous
popularity of the new iMacs and G3
and G4 chips released by Apple.
The Bookstore sells all of its Ap
ples directly, cutting down on the
nuisance of shipping and returning,
and according to Computer Store
Manager Andy Wong. Apple can re
sUx*k the Bookstore within 48 hours.
Rikleen, who uses an Apple at his
desk, said ResComp "loosely recom
mends Macs to novice computer
users." because they are generally
"easier to use" and are easier to hook

up to the Stanford network.
But he emphasizes that
ResComp can work with either type
of computer and therefore does not
have a stake in which model students
prefer.
Still, most of the computers avail
able in campus clusters are Apples, so
those who choose not to buy their
own computer become Mac users. In
recent years, however, ResComp has
been adding PCs to the clusters, and
fewer students depend on cluster
computers.
Rikleen said that last year 85 per
cent of ail Stanford students owned
their own laptop or desktop comput
er and 75 percent of them used the
network from their own computer.
As recently as five years ago, he esti
mates, these numbers were closer to
50 percent and 25 percent.
Rikleen theori/ed that PCs are
more popular among Stanford stu
dents because they have already seen
them at home.
"Most of the business world uses
PCs, so (it is] reasonable to assume
that some attorney who uses PCs in
the office will use one at home, where

kids will have access to them," he
said. "If a student comes to Stanford
and they know PCs, they're more
likely to get one."
With the increasing number of
computers, there has come an in
creasing demand for repairs of PCs.
The Bookstore computer repair shop
is authorized as an Apple repair cen
ter only, meaning it cannot work on
many PC problems.
"We will be Dell- and Compaq
authorized soon," said Brian Peck,
who works at the shop. Hopefully, he
said, this will occur "within a month."
The increase has also accompa
nied more uses for computers both
academically and socially. Many
classes rely on e-mail notification for
meeting times and assignments,
while some use newsgroups to hold
out-of-class discussions. Students can
turn in assignments over the network
and professors can disseminate as
signments.
Socially, groups announce
events and parties over e-mail lists,
sometimes relying entirely on e
mail for publicity. And students
must register for their classes and
check e-mail using network-based
Axess.
"Without my computer, 1 would
lose at least an hour each day. looking

up course info, figuring out what
everyone else knows already by e
mail," sophomore Paco Jain said.
Freshman Tawni Tidwell, whose
order of a Dell computer from the
Bookstore has been delayed nearly
two weeks, quickly realized the im
portance of computers on Stanford's
campus.
"This campus is so focused on
computers," she said. "Every way of
communication, with advisors, with
in the dorm, with everyone, is by e
mail ...[without my computer] I'll
receive messages a day late."
Rikleen sees video streaming
across the network as a new use of
computers on campus. He cites one
history class where the professor
plans to broadcast "Blade Runner"
to his students' computers.
Rikleen doubts the use of net
work video will change the way class
es are taught much in the near future,
because professors are often not ex
cited to experiment with the technol
ogy. But there is little doubt that com
puters are already intrinsic to the
Stanford experience.
When asked whether a student
could graduate from Stanford with
out using a computer, he responded
quickly. "No way," he said. "That
happened 10 years ago."
