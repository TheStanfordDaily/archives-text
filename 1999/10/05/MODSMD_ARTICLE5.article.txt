# PCs force Macs from Stanford dorm rooms
##

Computers are Hooding the Stan
ford campus, and more than ever,
they are PCs instead of Macs.
Residential Computing's Net
work and Systems Administrator
Ethan Rikleen estimates that five
years ago, about 90 percent of Stan
ford students owned Macintoshes.
That fraction has now dropped to be
tween one-fourth and one-third.
This trend comes in the face of
several subtle pressures on campus
favoring Macs and the enormous
popularity of the new iMacs and G3
and G4 chips released by Apple.
The Bookstore sells all of its Ap
ples directly, cutting down on the
nuisance of shipping and returning,
and according to Computer Store
Manager Andy Wong. Apple can re
sUx*k the Bookstore within 48 hours.
Rikleen, who uses an Apple at his
desk, said ResComp "loosely recom
mends Macs to novice computer
users." because they are generally
"easier to use" and are easier to hook

Despite the Bookstore's prominant display of iMacs, PCs are becoming more popular among students.
