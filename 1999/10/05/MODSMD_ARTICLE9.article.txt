## Forbes, Bush intend to spend millions on ad campaigns 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
George W. Bush plans to spend up
to $20 million on an issue-driven ad
campaign in the early Republican
primaries, hoping to blunt expected
attacks from wealthy rival Steve
Forbes.
Forbes is expected to spend at
least as much to draw a "sharp con
trast" between himself and Bush —
the two-term Texas governor and
GOP front-runner.
Top advisers with both cam
paigns outlined the ad strategies
yesterday, revealing plans to spend
more money on television ads than
their GOP rivals will manage to
raise altogether.

The brewing ad war reflects the
huge money gap separating Bush
and Forbes from the rest of the
eight-person GOP field. It also sig
nals Bush's plans to win the nomi
nation and invest his record-shat
tering fund-raising warchest in the
general election.
"I plan to spend [campaign
money] in a way that will help me
get the nomination and then,
should I be the nominee, I'm not
going to let happen to me what
happened to Bob Dole and get
defined between the primary sea
son and the convention," Bush said
in a recent interview with The
Associated Press.

Dole won the 19% Republican
nomination, but his campaign was
out of cash and unable to respond
to negative ads run by Democrats.
"First thing is first — win the nomi
nation," Bush said.
To that end, the Bush team is
testing 13 to 15 potential ads in
focus groups. Most of them feature
a mixture of campaign footage and
the candidate looking directly into
the camera, talking about issues
such as taxes, education, defense
policy and using charities to help
people move from welfare to work.
The initial ads will begin airing
in three to six weeks in lowa and
New Hampshire, then will begin

showing up in other key states as
their primaries draw closer. With
his budget divided into stages. Bush
plans to spend between $15 million
and $20 million on the first batch of
election contests — between lowa's
caucuses and March 7, when more
than a dozen primaries will be held
on a single day.
The rest of his primary budget
was not revealed by advisers.
Forbes' campaign entered the ad
fray first, announcing in June that
the wealthy conservative would air
$10 million worth of ads over the
summer. However, he spent only
$4.2 million, campaign officials said,
attributing the difference to a

weaker-than-expected field of con
servative candidates. Like the rest
of the GOP candidates, despite all
his money, Forbes still trails far
behind Bush in polling.
His summer ads focused on
issues, not Bush. That will change,
according to Forbes campaign
manager Bill Dal Col.
"It's clear that any issue advoca
cy we do would show the sharp con
trast between Steve Forbes' conser
vative platform and George Bush's
moderate mush," Dal Col said.
Bush spokeswoman Mindy
Tucker replied, "I'm sure the
American people hope that 'sharp
contrast' is not just a nice way of

saying 'negative ads.'"
The Bush team, armed with
research of Forbes' 19% failed
presidential bid to defeat Dole, is
prepared to label him a negative
campaigner. They hope voters
make Forbes pay the price for criti
cizing Bush.
The Texas governor has raised
more than $56 million, more than
seven times as much as his nearest
rival. Forbes is dipping into his per
sonal fortune to pay for most of his
campaign. Unlike their GOP rivals,
Bush and Forbes have rejected fed
eral matching funds for their cam
paigns and do not have to abide by
strict spending limits.
