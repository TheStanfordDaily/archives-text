Many Stanford students re
turned to campus this fall expect
ing to see a new and improved Cof
fee I louse.
Instead, they found their fa
vorite hangout boarded up and off
limits. awaiting the completion of
renovations scheduled for this
summer.
"Ii is completely ridiculous that
they gutted the Coffee House
shortly after the July 4 weekend,"
said junior Ryan Blitstein. "They
should have started [the process] as
soon as the school year ended."
Matthew Almeida, general
manager of Bon Appetit, the oper
ator of the Coffee House, expects
to re-open "sometime in late No
vember."
"We're through the worst" of
the delay, he said. "Because of the
reviewing and regulation process,
delays on these sort of jobs are nor
mal."
"For a job in this county, this is
going well." he said.
The renovation plans have to be
approved by the Stanford Manage
ment Company and several Santa
Clara County divisions, including
the Planning and Development
Department and the Public Health
Department.
Also. Almeida said, "the boom
ing national economy has caused
construction delays in all parts of
the country. We have felt this phe
nomenon significantly in our area,
and it affects all phases of the
process."
Almeida, however, is confident
that the pace should pick up soon.
"The construction itself is a rel

atively short phase of the project,"
Almeida said. But further delays
could result, he said, if on-site
county inspectors find problems
with the new building design.
The renovated Coffee House
will, for the most part, look the
same. The building layout and
stage will remain intact.
Plans call for open floor space
and a lowered service counter, to
facilitate wheelchair access. These
changes will bring the Coffee
House into compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
The University wishes to meet
ADA requirements in all buildings
by the year 2000.
New lighting fixtures will meet
federal energy efficiency stan
dards.
The new lighting scheme will be
noticeably, but not radically, dif
ferent.
A new paint job should give the
Coffee House a "warmer" feel, ac
cording to Almeida. The gray walls
will be painted over in a shade of
beige.
To streamline the food order
ing. Coffee House owners will
move the service counter to the
White Plaza entrance and install a
register counter with a separate
area for food pickup.
"I think the new system seems
more efficient," said sophomore
Kim Woodhouse.
"In the past I've had some prob
lems with my orders. One of the
servers would take my order, and it
would get lost or someone else
would pick it up accidentally,"
Woodhouse added.
The new layout "reminds me of
Starbucks," she said.
