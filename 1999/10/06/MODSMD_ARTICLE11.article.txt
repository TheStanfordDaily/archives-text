Current tree's antics
defeat purpose of
mascot

All right, let's face it: this year's
Stanford Tree is coming up a
few branches short of our
expectations.
Our beloved mascot is more than
just a University symbol; it's a focal
point for our sense of pride and
school spirit. The person beneath
those hallowed leaves ought to keep
that in mind at all times.
Evan Meagher, this year's Tree, got
this year oil to a good start. At the
University of Texas, in the face of a
humiliating loss for our football team,
the Tree tackled the prancing
Longhorn mascot, the marching
inflatable mascot — pretty much
everyone short of the actual bull sit
ting out on the field — causing dis
heartened Stanford fans to cheer.
But in the weeks since that game,
Meagher's behavior as the Tree has
been a bit questionable.
First of all, Meagher has been
showing up to sporting events such as
volleyball matches and football games
out of costume. Sometimes he'll take
oil his costume on a hot day and
dance around without it. This is a vio
lation of Stanford tradition, not to
mention a disappointment to children
and fans who lose the charm when
their hero is unmasked.
'ITie Tree has also been going over
the edge with his conduct during
games. He has been encouraging
crowds to shout out some inappropri
ate cheers. We'd rather not print any
of them here, but let's just say that the
yell leaders have been trying to keep
him away from the microphone. He

doesn't dance with the same vigor
that the Tree has had in past years,
and when he does dance, he appears
dizzy and inebriated.
Finally, this year's Tree costume
just doesn't cut it with many fans. The
"palm tree" leaves at the top are
sparse and have a strange tendency to
fall off. Ilie sunglasses are a cool con
cept, hut they're hard to make out
because they don't contrast well with
the bark; it's weird to see a mascot
without "eyes." The Rolling Stones
tongue is likewise interesting, but if
you don't get the idea, it just looks
plain dumb.
We give a lot of flexibility to the
Tree to begin with. It is, after all, a
member of the Band and is therefore
allowed to behave a little strangely in
the name of school spirit. But actions
that embarrass our own students and
alumni are inexcusable.
Meagher tried out for Tree two
years in a row before he was chosen to
take on the mascot role. To demon
strate his dedication to the Band, he
dipped himself in a coffin full of syrup
and let people slap him with pan
cakes. He devised a secret break-in
into the Clock Tower. He even let
himself become a human tetherball.
Now that he has the job, he shouldn't
slack off. Now he has an entire Uni
versity and thousands of alumni to
impress — not just the Band — and
he has to do it for the better part of a
year.
Now is the time for Meagher to
look at the examples of past Trees for
guidance. He needs to take a few
dancing lessons and grow a few more
leaves on the old noggin. He needs to
kick some more ass during football
games. If he can shape up just a little,
he'll be a Tree that everyone will be
proud of.
