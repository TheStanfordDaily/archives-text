### Sameer Ahmed 
p Stanford's new clock tower
was unveiled in 1983, administrators
uncovered a large Mickey Mouse
face installed by the "Chappies."
Today celebrates the l(X)th an
niversary of The Stanford Chaparral,
the second-oldest continuously pub
lished college humor magazine, be
hind the "Harvard Lampoon."
In 1980 Chaparral members se
cretly replaced the front page of The
Daily. The new page announced that
the Stanford Bowling Team had been
killed in a car crash. The next day. stu
dents mourned the loss of the team,
which did not exist at the time.
In addition to pranks and publish
ing. the magazine has also published
parodies and sponsored live musical
performances.
Ray Funkhowser, writer for the
Chaparral in 1956 and editor from
1959 to 1960, has decided to compile
a book of Chaparral issues from the
past 100 years.
Funkhowser said the Chaparral is
different now than it was when he

worked on it.
"The Chaparral has changed in a
number of ways due to the different
styles qf college humor," said
Funkhowser. "Now. they can print
things that we could never print, but
back then, we could also print stuff
that they can't print.
"For example, we could never
have used (expletives]," he said, "but
because of political correctness in a
spectrum of issues today, they cannot
make the same jokes about certain
groups of people in the same way that
we could," he said.
Ellickson agreed with Funkhows
er that the ( haparral has changed be
cause of the humor of the lime.
"Issues from the early years had a
lot of poems, puns and the like: every
thing was very conservative." Fllick
son said. "During wars, the 'Chappie'
became very patriotic." Ellickson,
claims a 1917 issue of the 'Chappie'
was written by ( haparral writers who
were lighting in France.
In the 196()s and 19705, the' Cha

pie' grew rebellious â€” sex, drugs,
rock and roll, that sort of thing. "In
recent years, the 'Chappie' has taken
on an absurdist style of humor," El
lickson said.
Funkhowser also believes the atti
tudes of the students have changed a
lot since the 19505.
"We had a lot of fun at the Chap
arral," he said. "I think Stanford was
more of a fun place in the 50s than it
is now."

The Chaparral was named after
a shrub found in the western Unit
ed States, according to Ellickson.
Since its founding on Oct. 6. 1899,
the "Chappie" has become an out
let for creative writers and artists
who disliked the stiffness ol the
mighty "Stanford Sequoia." Stan
ford's official artistic and literary
journal, according to the Chapar
ral's Web site.
In addition. The Chaparral's
founders wanted to create a humor
magazine for the West Coast compa
rable to the ones published at I lar
vard and Columbia, Ellickson said.

On April 17, 19()6. the eve of San
Francisco's Great Earthquake, Mor
rie Oppenheim founded The Ham
mer and Coffin Society in a Menlo
Park bar to oversee the Chaparral,
according to Ellickson.
The Chapparal plans to increase
the number of issues that it publishes
each year, Ellickson said. They also
plan to publish a 1(X) anniversary
issue, as well as improve the quality
ol" their writing and design.
They are also looking for a house
for their offices. Ellickson added that
if anyone is selling a house for under
$1(K), they should call (650) 723-146 N.
