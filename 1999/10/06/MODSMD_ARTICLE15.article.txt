# Note-selling Web sites cause controversy
## 
### Peter Stair 
Seeing potential in a market long
popular at Stanford, several national
companies are offering lecture notes
over the Internet. Unlike Stanford's
Lecture Notes service, however, the
national sites are free and controver
sial.
There are at least three new Web
sites. Versity.com, StudentU.com
and Study24-7.com, offering lecture
notes to students. Site administrators
either pay the note-taking student a
lump sum of about $3(X)or a share of
advertising revenue for his or her
notes. The notes are available to any
one. even though they are tailored to
specific classes at specific universities.
Hut Stanford students have shown
little interest in the national note
providers. Versity.com is still looking
for note-takers for more than two
dozen Stanford classes, according to
its Web site.
Craig Green, co-founder and co
(T~() of Study24-7.com, said the ser
vices are quite popular elsewhere.
Versitv.com hopes to serve MO cam
puses by the end of the year, and
Study 24-7. which also offers class
chat rooms and a bulletin board for
each class, boasts a presence on 115
campuses.
The three companies are distrib
uting notes despite the chagrin of
many professors who believe the
notes will encourage absenteeism
and inaccuracy.
According to I University of I lous
ton Art Prof. ( arolyn (ioeser, teach
ers do not only lecture. Slides, class
demonstrations and student partici
pation are hard to turn into notes.
Goeser said in an interview with the
( hronicle of I ligher Education. And
there is a danger that some note-tak

crs will miss important nuances as
they hear the lecture for the first time,
she said.
Professors also object to what they
feel is a violation of their intellectual
property rights.
" There's nothing more personal
than your lecture material." said
Richard Lutz, senior associate dean
at the University of Florida, in an in
terview with the Chronicle. "As an

individual faculty member. I find it
rather distasteful."
University of Nevada-Reno Judi
cial Studies Prof. James Richardson,
president of the American Associa
tion of University Professors, told the
Chronicle, "What you say is your
own intellectual property We do
think there are some legal issues at
stake here."
A 1993 Florida court ruling con

eluded that lecture material cannot
be copyrighted because most lectures
consist of commonly known facts and
ideas, according to the Chronicle.
1 lowever. this case has yet to be seri
ously tested and has not deterred
lawyers in their threats.
So faf, however, there has been no
legal action against any of the Inter
