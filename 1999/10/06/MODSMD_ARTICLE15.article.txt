# Note-selling Web sites cause controversy

### Peter Stair 
Seeing potential in a market long
popular at Stanford, several national
companies are offering lecture notes
over the Internet. Unlike Stanford's
Lecture Notes service, however, the
national sites are free and controver
sial.
There are at least three new Web
sites. Versity.com, StudentU.com
and Study24-7.com, offering lecture
notes to students. Site administrators
either pay the note-taking student a
lump sum of about $3(X)or a share of
advertising revenue for his or her
notes. The notes are available to any
one. even though they are tailored to
specific classes at specific universities.
Hut Stanford students have shown
little interest in the national note
providers. Versity.com is still looking
for note-takers for more than two
dozen Stanford classes, according to
its Web site.
Craig Green, co-founder and co
(T~() of Study24-7.com, said the ser
vices are quite popular elsewhere.
Versitv.com hopes to serve MO cam
puses by the end of the year, and
Study 24-7. which also offers class
chat rooms and a bulletin board for
each class, boasts a presence on 115
campuses.
The three companies are distrib
uting notes despite the chagrin of
many professors who believe the
notes will encourage absenteeism
and inaccuracy.

she said.
Professors also object to what they
feel is a violation of their intellectual
property rights.

rather distasteful."

Chronicle, "What you say is your

think there are some legal issues at

net companies.
What really bothers the profes
sors about companies such as Versity
and Study 24-7 is their existence on
the Internet, where any computer
user can access them, according to
the Chronicle. (Various outlets have
sold lecture notes since the l%()s.)
Stanford's Lecture Notes service
has existed since "at least the 19705,"
said Stanford Student Enterprises
CEO Sean Lucy, a senior. Accord
ing to Lucy, they have not been very
controversial.
"Certainly [there has been] no

controversy recently," he said.
ITiis is largely because SSE gains
permission from the professor of
each class before hiring someone to
take notes. According to Lecture
Notes Manager Daniel Kinnamon, it
is "extremely rare" for professors to
refuse permission for intellectual
property reasons.
More often, "professors tell us
their class is not conducive for Lec
ture Notes," he said, "sometimes
they make their own notes for the
class." Stanford professors, knowing
that only Stanford students will ben
efit from the sale of their notes, have
generally been cooperative, Kinna
mon said.
By going through professors.

SSE's Lecture Notes service has an
advantage, Kinnamon argued, be
cause "we have accountability. If our
notes are poor, we hear about it. And
we're easy to contact."
Professors can always refuse per
mission in the future if they object to
the notes' existence, he said.
Kinnamon does not see the bigger
companies as serious competitors
yet. SSE continues to average only
about 15 classes per quarter, and
many students don't see much need
for Lecture Notes at all.
"I've found lecture notes useful
for review before exams, but I don't
think they replace taking notes your
self," said sophomore Merrian
Fuller.
