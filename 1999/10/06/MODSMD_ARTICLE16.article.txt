# New program helps students organize time Web's Info Pier offers class schedules, personal planners
## 
### Eileen Chao 
The Web site for student plan
ning, originally called Needle, un
derwent major renovations over
this past summer and has emerged
as Info Pier, a Stanford online pro
gram which can act as a personal
and academic planner.
Loaded with features such as
class schedules, a personalized cal
endar and grade postings. Info Pier
provides students and faculty with
a way to better organize their time.
Spearheaded by graduate student
Noam l.ivmal. Info Pier was creat
ed over the summer by a three-man
team with the purpose ol centraliz
ing the many Web pages of differ
ent courses.
"Students had to go to personal
directories to find different Web
sites for their different courses,"
said graduate student Scott Jones,
one of Info Pier's founders, "That

problem was solved when every
thing was integrated into one
place."
For the classes signed onto the
program, Info Pier shows the times
of lectures, sections and office
hours for both professors and
teaching assistants. Students can
see all class information on their
personal calendars and can sched
ule other events around these
times. This kind of personalization
was one of the benefits of the Web
site users appreciated the most, ac
cording to Info Pier co-founder
Michael Okun.
"Most people are used to look
ing up information, not used to
using a personalized management
tool." said Okun. "People like see
ing their schedules automatically
put on their calendar. They don't
have to create items — it happens
automatically and makes it so easy
for them."

Freshman Grace Lin has used
Info Pier since the beginning of the
academic year and feels that it has
helped her in many ways.
"I think the program is very use
ful." Lin said. "'lt helps me manage
my time efficiently, especially
when I can see my whole schedule
laid out."
Another aspect of this Web site
is the new team projects area. This
area includes a shared calendar,
which allows easy scheduling for
team meetings, and shared files, so
people can easily work 011 the same
project together. The team feature
also can create an agenda or take
minutes for a meeting and also can
assign tasks to specific members.
According to Jones, it is a great
way to create study groups.
"Everyone on the a team can
monitor each other and keep track
ol how the team in progressing,"
Jones said.

Okun pointed out the team fea
ture isn't only used for study
groups. He believed that it would
be "... really useful for anything —
academic or not."
The program already has about
20 teams completely independent
of the classroom. Cedro staff mem
bers have used it to coordinate
meetings for themselves.
"When there is so much e-mail,
messages get lost." said junior Katy
Innes, Cedro's head academic ad
visor. "So, if you have a bulletin
where dorm messages are all in one
place and under one discussion
thread, it'll be much easier to man
age."
Professors and teaching assis
tants have also used the system.
Statistics Prof. lain Johnstone uses
the Web site to post homework as
signments, handouts, solutions and
other materials for Statistics 190.
Johnstone believes that the service
acts as a tool for instructors to or
ganize materials on the Web.
"People can look at course ma
terials anytime and anywhere they
want." Johnstone said.
However, many classes on cam
pus are still not linked with Info P
ier — including most humanities
classes.
"Seeing my schedule and an
nouncements is nice, but it hasn't
been extremely useful because I
onlv have one class on it. So 1 have

to keep switching between e-mail
and the Web site," Innes said.
Jones recognizes this problem
and hopes that as time goes on,
more and more professors will find
the site helpful and begin to use it.
"Everybody benefits as more
and more people use it," Jones said.
The founders hope the program
will spread into all walks of life, as
it was intended. Johnstone be
lieves this new program has al
ready proven itself to be worthy of
widespread use.
"Large courses have several or
ganizations, TAs and many stu
dents," he said. "If a system can
help you and the student organize,
then it's definitely beneficial."
