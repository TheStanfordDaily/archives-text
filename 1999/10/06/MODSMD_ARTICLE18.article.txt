## Stopping On Top Of The Earth Cow Earth Quake Formation & Prevention 
### Kenny Lin 
An earthquake with great mag
nitude can be one of the most catas
trophic events in nature. With the
recent earthquakes in Turkey,
Mexico and Taiwan, earthquake
formation and prevention have
again aroused the attention of the
public and researchers, especially
those in the Bay Area, where mem
ories from the 1989 earthquake are
still vivid.

According to statistics from the
Center for Disease Control (CDC),
earthquakes have caused more
than one million deaths and injuries
worldwide in the past 20 years. In
the United States, approximately
,1600 deaths attributed to earth
quakes have been recorded since
colonial times, more than I,(XH) of
which have occurred in California.
Two weeks ago, the7.6-magnitude
earthquake in Taiwan killed over
2,1(H) and left thousands homeless

in the mountainous central part of
the island.
The science behind the earth
quake is as imposing as the earth
quake itself. The energy released
by a large earthquake, according to
National Earthquake Information
Center, is comparable to ISO mil
lion metric tons of TNT. In other
words, its energy may be 10,000
times as great as that of the first
atomic bomb.
The world's earthquakes are not

randomly distributed over the
Earth's surface. They tend to be
concentrated in narrow zones. Why
is this? And why are volcanoes and
mountain ranges also found in
these zones, too?
An explanation can be found in
plate tectonics, a concept which has
revolutionized thinking in the
Earth Sciences in the last 10 years.
The theory of plate tectonics com
bines many of the ideas about con
tinental drift, originally proposed in
1912 bv Alfred Wegener in Ger
many. and sea-floor spreading, sug
gested originally by Harry Hess of
Princeton University. Plate tecton
ics tells us that the Earth's rigid
outer shell, the lithosphere, is bro
ken into a mosaic of oceanic and
continental plates.
There are about 20 rigid plates
on the earth's surface which can
slide over the aesthenosphere, the
uppermost layer of the mantle.
These plates are in constant
motion. Along the margins where
they interact, important geological
processes take place, such as the
formation of mountain belts, earth
quakes and volcanoes. If the inter
acting forces become too great, the
rocks rupture and shift, causing an
earthquake.
Most of these ruptures, or faults,
lie beneath the surface. But some,
such as the San Andreas Fault in
California, are visible. Most earth
quakes occur along the edges of the
plates, called the belts, two of which
have been quite active recently.
The circum-Pacific belt lies along
plate boundaries around the Pacific

Ocean. The Alpide belt follows
plate boundaries across southern
Europe and Asia, exemplified by
the shocks in Taiwan and Turkey.
Prediction of earthquakes is not
yet possible, but scientists are opti
mistic that they will find a method.
Scientists know the regions where
earthquakes are likely to occur.
Traditionally, they use the history
of previous earthquakes to guess
how often a certain region may
expect earthquakes. For example,
California may expect a catastroph
ic earthquake once every 50 to 100
years.
In addition, advanced research
that involves drilling has been con
ducted to allow scientists to make
more direct observations on the
kinematics of the fault zone. In
fact. Geophysics Professor Mark
Zoback has recently proposed a
four-kilometer deep scientific
drilling project into the San
Andreas fault zone at Parkfield.
The project is aimed at providing
observational data on the composi
tion, physical state and mechanical
behavior of a major active fault
zone at depth.
Such data, according to
Zoback's proposal, "will test and
constrain a diverse (and continually
expanding) spectrum of hypotheses
pertaining to faulting and earth
quake generation."
"Without direct observation,"
Zoback says, "scientists can't verify
or disprove their hypotheses."
The project has three main com
ponents. The first component
focuses on collecting rocks and

fluid samples for geochemical mea
surements. The second component
seeks to understanding the overall
fault zone properties and behavior.
The third component involves
monitoring deep seismic activities
for at least 20 years after the
drilling has been completed.
Though costly and hazardous, as
the instruments will be installed in
a geologically active zone,
Zoback's drilling project and the
data it provides may be integral to
successful prediction of earth
quakes.
In an interview with Stanford
Magazine, Zoback commented that
"some scientists claim that earth
quakes are unpredictable, period.
But I think that's an irresponsible
position at this time. We do know
earthquake prediction is not easy,
but the simple fact is that we don't
understand the physics of faulting
well enough to know whether or
not we can predict earthquakes. If
we better understood how faults
worked, we'd be able to make bet
ter laboratory and computer simu
lations, and then we'd be able to
make better forecasts."
Chinese mythology has it that
earthquakes occur if a divine earth
cow, living thousands of feet
beneath the earth's surface, makes
any movement. Each culture has its
legend about this formidable event.
Fortunately, we are now able to
answer the why and how part of
earthquakes. With new research
from Zoback and his colleagues, we
hope that the when part of earth
quakes will soon be answered.

In addition, advanced research
that involves drilling has been con
ducted to allow scientists to make
more direct observations on the
kinematics of the fault zone. In
fact. Geophysics Professor Mark
Zoback has recently proposed a
four-kilometer deep scientific
drilling project into the San
Andreas fault zone at Parkfield.
The project is aimed at providing
observational data on the composi
tion, physical state and mechanical
behavior of a major active fault
zone at depth.
Such data, according to
Zoback's proposal, "will test and
constrain a diverse (and continually
expanding) spectrum of hypotheses
pertaining to faulting and earth
quake generation."
"Without direct observation,"
Zoback says, "scientists can't verify
or disprove their hypotheses."
The project has three main com
ponents. The first component
focuses on collecting rocks and

fluid samples for geochemical mea
surements. The second component
seeks to understanding the overall
fault zone properties and behavior.
The third component involves
monitoring deep seismic activities
for at least 20 years after the
drilling has been completed.
Though costly and hazardous, as
the instruments will be installed in
a geologically active zone,
Zoback's drilling project and the
data it provides may be integral to
successful prediction of earth
quakes.
In an interview with Stanford
Magazine, Zoback commented that
"some scientists claim that earth
quakes are unpredictable, period.
But I think that's an irresponsible
position at this time. We do know
earthquake prediction is not easy,
but the simple fact is that we don't
understand the physics of faulting
well enough to know whether or
not we can predict earthquakes. If
we better understood how faults
worked, we'd be able to make bet
ter laboratory and computer simu
lations, and then we'd be able to
make better forecasts."
Chinese mythology has it that
earthquakes occur if a divine earth
cow, living thousands of feet
beneath the earth's surface, makes
any movement. Each culture has its
legend about this formidable event.
Fortunately, we are now able to
answer the why and how part of
earthquakes. With new research
from Zoback and his colleagues, we
hope that the when part of earth
quakes will soon be answered.

Earthquakes can have devastating effects, as the recent 7.6-magnitude quake in Taiwan shows. Over
2,100 have been reported dead from the Sept. 21st quake.
