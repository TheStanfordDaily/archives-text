# Tobacco companies target retail outlets

Restricted by federal legislation
on consumer advertising, U.S.
tobacco companies appear to be
targeting small retail outlets to pro
mote sales of their product, spend
ing at a level far greater than similar
promotional allowances for other
items.
In a newly released study done
in collaboration with Santa Clara
University, Stanford researchers
found that small retail operations
are receiving significantly greater
money and discounts from tobacco
companies to promote the sale of
tobacco products as compared to
other items such as soft drinks,
beer, wine and snacks.
Ellen Feighery, a senior research
scientist at the Stanford Center for
Research in Disease Prevention,
was the lead author of the study.
According to Feighery, their
research indicates that instead of
restricting consumer advertising on
magazines and billboards, public
health policy should be focusing
more on the retail environment.
The study focused on the incen
tives given to industry retailers by
U.S. tobacco companies, particular
ly slotting and display allowance
fees paid to retailers to encourage
allocation of premium shelf space
to a product.
The survey was conducted
between November and December
of 1997. The researchers surveyed
108 chain convenience stores, gas
stations, small groceries, liquor
stores and tobacco stores in Santa
Clara County. It showed that
almost two-thirds of the stores had
received allowances from tobacco
makers.
By comparison, only 16.5 per
cent of the stores received
allowances from soft drink manu
facturers. and only 6.9 percent of
the stores received allowances for
candy.
The study also indicated that

tobacco companies were much
more generous in their payment.
Although tobacco sales accounted
for the highest sales volume in only
33 percent of the stores, nearly 78
percent of the total allowances
received by the stores were from
tobacco makers.
The data was based primarily on
interviews with store managers.
The study excluded large chain
stores and locations outside Cali
fornia's Silicon Valley.
"These survey results suggest
that tobacco companies use gener
ous incentives and aggressive mar
keting programs to motivate retail
ers to prominently display, promote
and advertise their products to
ensure the high visibility of their
products and marketing materials,"
the researchers concluded.
According to a Federal Trade
Commission study, the U.S. tobac
co industry spent over four times
more on retailer incentive pro
grams than on media advertising in
1996 â€” $2.4 billion compared to
$560 million for media advertising.
The trend toward targeting the
retail environment is also evident
from the fierce competition
between the tobacco companies.
Three of the countries largest
cigarette makers filed a lawsuit
against Philip Morris Co., accusing
the giant tobacco company of
obstructing their ability to secure
prime shelf space in retail outlets.
A recent U.S. Senate antitrust
hearing in September also focused
on slotting and display fees in the
tobacco industry.
The new study may direct new
public health measures in a new
direction. "If public policy puts
restraints on cigarette advertising,
these dollars will simply flow to
other marketing activities," said
Tyzoon Tyebjce, Santa Clara Uni
versity marketing professor and
one of the co-authors of the study.
"The challenge for public policy
will be how to regulate this more
invisible marketing effort."
