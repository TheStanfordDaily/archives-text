# Eat, think and see (Ben and) Jerry
## I scream, you scream for Vermont dessert duo 
### Sarah Rapawy Staff writer 
More than just the promise of
free ice cream drew students to
Memorial Auditorium last night.
Rapt students listened to the
story of how two self-proclaimed
Vermont hippies. Ben Cohen and
Jerry (irccnficld. rose to success,
while emphasi/ing the need for
business to use its power to fund so
cial needs.
The company donates 7.5 per

cent of its before-tax-profits to char
ity. the highest amount of any cor
poration.
Cohen and Greenfield used
$12.(KK) to open their first ice cream
kitchen in 1 in a renovated gas
station in Burlington, Vermont. Al
though the two had attended junior
high and high school together, they
did not join forces until their mid
2()s. after Jerry had been rejected
from medical school and Ben had
dropped out of'college and held nu
merous small jobs ranging from a

taxi-cab driver to a night-mopper.
Homemade ice-cream was their
second business venture after their
idea of a home bagel delivery ser
vice failed.
The young entrepreneurs over
came the challenge to sales posed
by Vermont's cold winters with cre
ative marketing strategies. They
then faced further challenges from
Pillsbury, the owner of Maagen
Da/s. who refused to sell ice cream
