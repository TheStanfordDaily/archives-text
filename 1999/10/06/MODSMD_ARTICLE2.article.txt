# Eat, think and see (Ben and) Jerry
## I scream, you scream for Vermont dessert duo 
### Sarah Rapawy Staff writer 
More than just the promise of
free ice cream drew students to
Memorial Auditorium last night.
Rapt students listened to the
story of how two self-proclaimed
Vermont hippies. Ben Cohen and
Jerry (irccnficld. rose to success,
while emphasi/ing the need for
business to use its power to fund so
cial needs.
The company donates 7.5 per

cent of its before-tax-profits to char
ity. the highest amount of any cor
poration.
Cohen and Greenfield used
$12.(KK) to open their first ice cream
kitchen in 1 in a renovated gas
station in Burlington, Vermont. Al
though the two had attended junior
high and high school together, they
did not join forces until their mid
2()s. after Jerry had been rejected
from medical school and Ben had
dropped out of'college and held nu
merous small jobs ranging from a

taxi-cab driver to a night-mopper.
Homemade ice-cream was their
second business venture after their
idea of a home bagel delivery ser
vice failed.
The young entrepreneurs over
came the challenge to sales posed
by Vermont's cold winters with cre
ative marketing strategies. They
then faced further challenges from
Pillsbury, the owner of Maagen
Da/s. who refused to sell ice cream

ice cream yesterday evening.
to distributors who were also selling
Cohen and Greenfield's ice cream.
Fearing an anti-trust battle with
the multi-billion dollar company,
Cohen and Greenfield took their
case to the people. They started the
'What's the Dough Boy Afraid Of?"
campaign, putting classified ads in
Rolling Stones Magazine and signs
on transit buses in Boston.
Although public outcry forced
I'illsbury to back down, Cohen and
Greenfield soon considered selling
their company.
"We looked at each other and
said, 'We're not ice-cream men any
more, we're business men. We're an
other cog in the machine that exploits
people,"' said Greenfield.
Rather than sell the business, the
two decided to integrate social con

cerns into corporate planning. "We
redefined the bottom line, not only
looking at how much money we
make, but how much we give back to
the community," said Greenfield.
The company began by holding a
statewide and then nationwide
stock-offering. Now. one in every
KM) Vermont families is a company
owner. Cohen and Greenfield also
publish an annual social and finan
cial report.
Greenfield stressed the feasibility
of simultaneously helping society
and making money through creativi
ty and innovation. The company's
Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavor
supports the efforts of a charitable re
ligious group in New York. Cohen
and Greenfield's company pays over
two million dollars a year to the
group for their brownies.
Cohen further stressed the impor
tance of business, which can use its
power to influence politics, the public

and the media.
"We live in the richest nation in
the world, but basic human needs
aren't being met. There are 11 billion
kids with no health care — we are the
only industrialized country in the
world which doesn't provide univer
sal care for its children," said Cohen.
Cohen criticized the U.S. military
budget, stating resources could be
better directed towards social needs.
"We can cut the Pentagon budget
bv at least 15 percent — 40 billion
dollars — and still remain the world's
foremost military power," said
Cohen.
"Our country needs to measure its
strength not in terms of how many
people we can kill, but how many we
can feed, clothe and care for,"he
added.
Their speech ended with a stand
ing ovation as students rushed to ask
questions and receive their free ice
cream.
