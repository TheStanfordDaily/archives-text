# New vascular grafts approved by FDA
## 
### Cindy Lin Contributing writer 
While most people associate
the acronym AAA with the Amer
ican Automobile Association, the
medical world recognizes AAA,
abdominal aortic aneurysms, as a
serious vascular condition where a
weakened bulge in the abdominal
artery wall is at risk of rupturing.
A major cause of AAA is arte
riosclerosis. the buildup of plaque
inside the artery, which damages
and weakens it. The pressure of
the blood flowing through this
weakened section of the abdomi
nal artery causes the vessel to bal
loon to an aneurysm.
It is estimated that 1.5 million
Americans have AAA. but it goes
undetected because it can be
asymptomatic. Over 200,000 cases
are reported each year, accompa
nied by approximately 15,000 mor
talities.
Last Tuesday, the Food and
Drug Administration, in an
uncommon regulatory decision,
approved two vascular repair

patches, called stent grafts, devel
oped to treat AAA.
The stent graft is a piece of
polyester tuhing with metal stents
at the ends to provide a framework
for supporting and securing the
device to the inside wall of the
aorta.
The patches are designed by
two competing medical technology
companies, both involved in the
development of cardiovascular
and vascular treatments and thera
pies: Medtronic Inc. of Minneapo
lis and Guidant Corporation of
Indianapolis.
Head of vascular surgery at
Stanford Medical Center, Christo
pher Zarins, Ml), was the princi
pal clinical investigator in
Medtronic's Aneußx Stent Graft
device.
"The development of stent
grafts revolutionizes our thinking
in the way we treat AAA." Zarins
said. "In the past 40 years the only
way to treat AAA was with open
abdominal surgical repair, which
was effective, but the surgery pre
sented a high risk for elderly

patients and those with heart dis
ease, kidney failure or other medi
cal conditions."
The standard treatment for
AAA involves eight hours of
surgery in which the surgeons
make a large abdominal incision,
clamp the aorta above and below
the aneurysm, remove the weak
ened portion of the vessel and
replace it with a graft.
But this treatment usually
involves several days in intensive
care followed by months of painful
recuperation.
According to Zarins, the new
stent graft device allows surgeons
to treat the aneurysm from within
the vessel wall.
"Instead of approaching the
aorta from the outside and replac
ing the weakened part, the stent
graft is put in place from the
inside," Zarins said. "Studies of
the use of this device have shown
that hospital stay time of stent
graft patients is markedly reduced,
and there is less blood loss and less
of a need for transfusion."
To install the stent graft device.

surgeons make an incision in ttye
groin and thread a delivery
catheter carrying the stent graft
device into the femoral artery and
guides it up to the aneurysm site.
Once in place the device provides
a new path for blood flow and
reduces the pressure on the
aneurysm.
"The new stent graft device is a
marriage of two vascular technolo
gies," Zarins said.
"The stent holds the graft in
place, and the graft provides an
alternate route for blood flow
through the vessel." 1
Brad Cole, general manager for
the Guidant division in Menlo
Park says that while both stent
grafts recently approved by the
FDA exclude the aneurysm from
pressure, differences exist between
the stent design of the Ancure and
the Aneußx device.
"The Guidant device has
attachment hooks on the end of
the woven polyester graft piece
which penetrate and attach to the
artery wall much like sutures do,"
Cole said.
On the other hand, the Aneußx
system has Nickel-Titanium stent
rings, which self-enlarge in the ves
sel to hold the graft in place at the
site of the aneurysm by friction.
While Zarins says that vascular
surgeons have been following the
new technology over the past sev
eral years, it may not be immedi
ately available to patients until the
surgeons learn to use the new
devices.
"The new technology requires
X-ray imaging and catheter guide
wires, so the training of vascular
surgeons in using this device is def
initely necessary," Zarins said.
Both stent devices cost about
$10,000 each. Medtronic estimates
the cost of the patch surgery to be
$18,000 to $20,000.
The traditional open-abdomi
nal surgery costs about $16,(MX),
but due to the decreased hospital
stay time of the less invasive new
treatment, the stent graft may be
more cost-effective in the long
term.

Atherosclerotic diseases can lead to ballooning of the aorta and result in an aneurysm. The new stent
graft is placed within the aorta to create a new channel for blood to flow, excluding the aneurysm from
circulation.
