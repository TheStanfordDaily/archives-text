## At midseason football still in search of answers 
### Tim Kane 
When it comes to analyzing
Stanford football at midseason.
even those psychics on TV at three
in the morning don't have a clue.
Examining the past four sea
sons. it becomes elear that Stanford
is close to impossible Id decipher.
1996 saw the C ardinal down 2-5 in
the beginning of the season, onh to
find them beating Michigan State
38-0 in the Sun Bowl at the end of
the year. In 1997. the Cardinal
started strong at 4-1. but then fell
into the gutter, its 5-6 record's only
saving grace being a victory against
California in Big Game. Then 1998
was just plain ugly, with the lone
highlight being a fourth-consecu
tive victory in Big Game.
Here are the facts for 1999 thus
far: Stanford has managed to beat
two top-20 teams while losing to
San Jose State and getting blown
out of Texas. The defense's play
has ranged from putrid to spectacu
lar, the offense has no trouble scor
ing points except when it has to.
and now the team stands at 3-2 (3-0
Pacific 10 Conference) entering its
first bye week.
Guesses, anyone?
Quarterback
This has been one of Stanford's
only consistent strengths of the
year, it the Texas debacle is over
looked. Senior Todd Husak has
thrown for 925 yards in a little over
three games, while completing 59
of 106 passes as well as five touch
downs. Junior Joe Borchard, play
ing in place of an injured Husak, al
ready has thrown for 690 yards and
seven touchdowns while going 37-
of-63 passing.
Husak has looked impressive in
three games following the opening
weekend, making sharp throws and

looking comfortable in the pocket,
while spreading the hall around to
his three wide receivers. He had a
monster day against an over
matched Arizona defense and was
on track for another huge day
against UCLA before he sustained
an injury to his ribs in the second
quarter.
Borchard played at least as well
as Husak, if not better, in the last
three quarters of the UCLA game,
throwing a 98-yard touchdown pass
to I roy Walters and finishing with
324 yards on the day. He met with
less success last week against San
Jose State, managing to complete
19 of 37 lor 313 yards while over
throwing several receivers and gen
erally looking more uncomfortable
than against the Bruins.
Husak will probably return to
action a week from Saturday at
home against Oregon State, and
given that his ribs will have re
ceived two weeks of rest, it is a safe
bet he will regain the form he
showed during the first few games
of the season. Borchard will back
up I lusak once again, but don't put
it past coach Tyrone Willingham to
L'iw Borchard a few plays during
the game if Husak needs a
breather.
Running Backs
Ever since the departure of
Mike Mitchell and Anthony Book
man following the 1997 season.
Stanford's running game has been
painful to watch. With the arrival of
heralded freshman Kerry Carter, it
was hoped that this season would
be different. Junior Coy Wire
began the season as the starter, but
was soon supplanted by Carter,
who has shown flashes of brilliance
on several occasions.
Carter ran impressively against
Arizona, reaching the end zone

three times, but against UCLA and
San Jose State his performance fell
off noticeably as he ran for a com
bined 39 yards on 23 carries.
For the season. Carter has 62
carries for 224 yards to go with his
six touchdowns. It's easy to forget
Carter is a true freshman, so the
team should not have to depend on
him — he will have plenty of time
to develop during the rest of the
season, as well as over the next four
years.
Sophomore fullback Brian
Allen, who has ran very well in lim
ited duty this year, may get addi
tional chances to shine during the
second half of the season.
Wide Receivers
The reason for the Cardinal's 3-
0 start in the Pac-10 is right here.
All-America candidate Troy Wal
ters has 801 yards receiving in five
games, averaging a conference
best 160 yards per game. Add his
six touchdowns, including the 98-
yarder that set a new Pac-10 record,
and you have a phenomenal perfor
mance so far this year by Stanford's
best player.
Deßonnie Pitts would be a first
option on most other teams, but he
makes a fine second target for
Husak, ranking in the top five in
the conference in yards and recep
tions to go with four touchdowns of
his own.
Dave Davis is the third receiver
in Stanford's offense, but is often
able to take advantage of defenses
that key on Walters and even Pitts
for big gains. The excellent perfor
mances of these three should carry
the Cardinal through the rest of the
season, especially if the relatively
weak running game doesn't pick
up.
Offensive Line
Led by fifth-year senior Mike
McLaughlin, the Cardinal offen
sive line has had an up-and-down
season. The line has given up only
eight sacks for a total of 42 yards
lost, but six of these have come in
the past two games. Also, the line
has not done a good enough job of
opening holes for the running
backs.
Husak and Borchard have typi
cally had enough time to pick holes
in the opposing defense, but San
Jose State got enough pressure on
at the critical times to disrupt the of
fense's rhythm. The line will have to
do a better job of run-blocking at
the very least in order to carry the
Cardinal down the tough stretch of
games it faces in the next few weeks.
Defensive Line
Willie Howard is the rock of the
Stanford defense. As close to an
immovable object as it gets, the
massive junior defensive tackle is
tied for second in the team in sacks
and leads the team with nine tack
les for loss. However, the line as a

whole has been underwhelming for
the year — teams typically double
team Howard and run right at the
remainder of the line, as was often
the case against UCLA and San
Jose State. If Stanford is to make a
run at the Rose Bowl or any other
bowl this year, this unit must play
better and stop the run on a consis
tent basis.
Linebackers
Riall Johnson is unquestionably
the leader of the Stanford lineback
ing corps. The senior outside line
backer leads the team with six sacks
and is tied for second in tackles for
loss. Just as with the defensive line,
the responsibility for stopping the

run falls to Johnson and his fellow
linebackers, and the job they have
collectively done has been ade
quate. However, with the nation's
leading rusher. Oregon State's Ken
Simonton, coming to the Farm next
weekend, as well as Arizona State's
Heisman candidate. J.R. Red
mond. attacking the Cardinal in
Tempe, they will have to do better.
Secondary
The achilles' heel of the Cardi
nal defense is its secondary. With a
pass-defense ranking of 101st in the
NCAA Division l-A. it's no won
der that most of Stanford's oppo
nents this year have picked on the
pass defense. Steven Pulley and

Chris Kasteler illustrated this as re
cently as last Saturday, with Kastel
er. the San Jose State senior quar
terback. throwing for 368 yards,
and Pulley being on the receiving
end for 255 of those yards, includ
ing the game-clinching touchdown
with almost two minutes left. In
juries sustained to backups Ruben
Carter and Brian Taylor have re
cently robbed the secondary of ad
ditional depth, meaning younger
players will have to step up during
the second half.
Special Teams

played decently so far this season.
I hey did give up a touchdown on a
kickoff return to UCLA, but have
done well covering punts and kick
offs the rest of the time. Junior
kicker Mike Bisclli has been su
perb 011 field goals, making six of
six on the year, although redshirt
sophomore punter Sean Tolpin
rud* s 37.9 yards per punt average

could be improved upon.
The Stanford football team has
managed to remain an enigma in
|yyy. Oil any given day, the power
ful machine that blitzed Arizona
and IJCI.A may show up, or the
weak and disorganized unit that was
destroyed in Texas and fell to San
Jose State may come calling. If the
(Ordinal wants to smell Roses at the
end of the season, it better hope the
former team comes out of the lock
er room for the next six games.
