## Ben Jones From darts to digs: weekend highlights Cardinal sporting life 
### 
We all know the stats. Five straight
Scars Directors Cups. All the
NCAA titles. No. 3 on Sports lllustrated's
1997 Jock School's countdowns. Stanford
is a sports mecca.
Day in and day out Stanford students are
treated to stunning array of sports watching
opportunities right here on campus. Now
we even have channel 23. Fox Sports World,
which, in one night, featured glimpses of
soccer, rugby. Australian rules football
(similar to rugby and equally violent and en
tertaining). field hockey (Singapore is a
powerhouse) and darts. Yes, darts. On tele
vision. Beamed right into your room.
This weekend was a prime example of
the veritable cornucopia ol sporting events
to attend. For those of you who may have
missed one. here's the rundown ...
Thursday 7:10 p.m. Women's volleyball.
I arrived 10 mint ues into the match, and we
had already beaten the Ducks 15-1 in the
first game. Oregon was down 8-0 while the
national anthem was still playing and lost

two sideouts during the introductions. The
second game was a repeat of the first, as
Stanford held Oregon to just a single mercy
point. It's great to see the Band, Tree and
Dollies back at the volleyball games. Noth
ing like hearing the individual provinces of
Uzbekistan and the ingredients of EZ-
Cheese before each Oregon serve.
Friday 7:00 p.m. Women's volleyball.
This was a tough choice to make. We've got
women's volleyball and men's soccer going
on here on campus and women's soccer
just down 101 in scenic Santa Clara. 1 chose
the cozy confines of Maples over a chilly
night at New Maloney Field to watch Stan
ford take on the second-most intimidating
docile woodland creature mascot from
Oregon, the OSU Beavers. While not quite
the pushover the Ducks were, the Beavers
provided little resitance as Logan Tom re
peatedly hammered spikes over the block
ing line. Logan Tom, by the way, can we say
Folkl? Don Shaw is going to be a smiling a
lot over the next four years.

Saturday 12:00 p.m. Men's water polo.
With this sports editor conspicuously ab
sent (the game was in Berkeley after all),
the water polo squad comes from behind to
drown, 1 mean down. California 8-7 in the
final minutes on Todd Snider's clutch two
pointer. Stanford looks to continue its mo
mentum as the MPSF season wears on.
Considering Oski's yearly "bearial" adven
tures in the claw. Cal continues to show its
troubles with the aquatic environment.
What about all those Discovery Channel
shows with bears plucking salmon out the
water like they should be wearing Bass
masters hats. Oski is definitely pushing the
fruits, berries and leaves side of the omniv
orous envelope.
Saturday 2:00 p.m. Football. Heading
over to the game, I was feeling that magical
feeling when our football team is winning.
If you read last week's column, you realize
importance of football in my Texan her
itage. Then 1 arrived at the game 10 min
utes before kickoff to find about 14 stu

dents in the section. No Branner tearing
down the house. No raucous Flo Mo chant
ing.
While the rest of the students, freshman
included, did trickle in as the game began
and made a loud and strong presence, I
couldn't help but think Stanford Stadium
had a long way before being compared to
"The Swamp" at Florida or Nebraska's
waves of redshirted fans.
My 10-1 and Rose Bowl dreams were
derailed a little bit by the 44-39 loss to San
Jose State. The Spartans pulled off their
second-consecutive upset in the "Silicon
Valley Showdown" or the "South Bay
War" or whatever the local news tries to
call this game. The Cardinal offense did
make another strong showing, and every
thing was looking bright when Dave Davis
came down with an onside kick near the
end of the game, but it was not meant to be.
Damn that four-playcrs-on-the-other-side
of-the-kicker rule.
Sunday featured key wins bv both the

men's and women's soccer teams as the
two squads swept their respective Nike !n
-vitationals. Field hockey also got in on the
winning action, overwhelming Cal Poly-
San Louis Obispo after warming up against
the alumni squad the day before.
Not to mention the fact that Stanford also
hosted one of the nation's largest cross coun
try meets on Saturday, in which both the
men's and women's squads took home first
place, and the first-ever coed national team
tennis championships at the Taube Family
Tennis Center Friday through Sunday.
The Cardinal couldn't pull out the ten
nis title (setting for the consolation bracket
prize) but with the wins in cross country,
the Cardinal record over the four days was
an impressive 10-2. Just another weekend
on the Farm.

Ben Jones is a junior majoring in interna
tional relations and wishes darts would have
been on television last year as an alternative
to Politcal Science 35 reading.
