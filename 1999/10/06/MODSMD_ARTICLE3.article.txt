# ASSU streamlines processes
## Funding, meeting procedure made easier 
### Marisa Pavlik Staff writer 
The once-übiquitous question
"Do I hear a motion to approve?"
will never again be heard in the Un
dergraduate Senate meetings.
The Senate approved a working
draft of the Undergraduate Senate
bylaws last night, including changes
called for in last year's ASSIJ Con
stitutional Amendment.
The bylaws smooth the decision
making process in meetings, creat
ing a more informal atmosphere
where votes are preceded by "Who
thinks we should do this? Say 'aye.'"
"There [are] two points to doing
this." said Senate Chair Steven
Aronowitz. a senior. "Internally, it
makes meetings less formal and
streamlines the process. It also
makes funding easier and makes
more sense to student groups."
The new bylaws hasten the fund
ing system for undergraduate stu
dent groups.
Rather than a quarterly deadline
and applications on disk, student
groups apply on the Web directly to
the Appropriations Committee
under a rolling deadline.
Additionally, the response time
from the committee will be halved to
two weeks.
" The new system will make life
easier for student group leaders,
while forcing the Senate to take
more responsibility for the [more
than] $300,000 we allocate each
year." Aronowitz said.
"As a whole, the Senate has
worked hard on this reform." said
Deputy Chair Ben Liu. a junior.
"For the past three weeks, senators
have been soliciting input from stu

dent leaders about the funding pro
cedures and how to improve them."
The Senate also approved the for
mation of a Task Force on Freshmen
Transportation.
The task force will explore alter
native transportation options for
freshmen, beginning with the Class
of 2(X)4, who will not be allowed to
bring cars.
"I hope we can help the adminis
tration find a wav to minimize the

impact of this policy so that when
ProFro's arrive spring quarter, we
can honestly tell them this is still a
great place to be a freshman."
Aronowitz said.
The student representatives and
University officials will also try to
improve campus activities so there is
less of a need to leave.
"This is a step in the right direc
tion," Liu said. "We need students to
be actively involved at each step of

the process. If they are concerned
about this policy, the administration
needs to hear about it."
At the meeting, ASSIi President
Mike Levin also said Tressider Ex
press and the Bookstore will under
go a trial period of longer hours
starting Oct. 15.
Tressider Express will stay open
until 2:30 a.m. and the Bookstore,
playing house music instead of clas
sical. until 12 a.m.
