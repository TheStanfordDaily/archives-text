# Fee refund deadline nears

Need some extra cash?
Students have little over a week left to request a refund
for this quarter's ASSU special and general fees.
Students who wish to request a refund can do so online
at http://assu.stanford.edu during the first three weeks of
each quarter.
Be warned, however, that groups can and do withhold
their services from students who request a refund for spe
cial fees. ASSU Legal Counseling and the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau are two groups that have done so in the past.
"Please also he aware that by taking a refund, you are
indicating that you do not wish to support that group and
its activities, and that in fairness to other students who do
support the group, you should not take advantage of their
services," said junior Mike Levin, president of the ASSU.

The quarterly charge on each student's University bill
enables the ASSU to fund student groups. This year's
Stanford Bulletin lists the undergraduate fees as $56 for
fall quarter for undergraduates, and $23 for graduate stu
dents.
In order to receive a special fee, a student group must
receive a majority of the votes cast in the spring ASSU
General Election, and the majority must total 15 percent
of those eligible to vote.
Over the past four years, the total ASSU special fee
has fluctuated dramatically. From 1995 to 19%. the fee
shifted from $102 to $89, the most significant drop in
years. From 1996 to 1997, however, the fee jumped by 75.2
percent to $156.
Last year's total vcarly fee was $150 for undergraduate
students and $78 for graduate stu
dents.
In last spring's election, six of the
36 groups requesting special fees
were unsuccessful: The Stanford De
bate Society, the Stanford Mock

Trial team. Alternative Medicine at
Stanford, Cardinal Illustrated, the
Society of Automotive Engineers
and the Stanford Society of Asian-
American Engineers.
The preceding year, voters ap
proved all groups except the I Jnder
graduate Weenie Roast.
Students can specify which stu
dent groups they wish to receive a re

fund from. Once a student applies for
a refund, it will automatically he ap
plied each quarter.
"Once a fee refund request has
been submitted, it will continue to be
applied for the remainder of the aca
demic year," Levin said. "To alter
your fee refund request, simply fin
out the refund form again before the
deadline."
