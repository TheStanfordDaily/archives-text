Some students come to Stanford
with a 1590 SA T score. Others were
editors of their high school year
hooks. But only the Knight Fellows
can boast years of real-world, jour
nalistic experience.
The John S. Knight Fellowship
program allows accomplished jour
nalists to take a year-long respite
from their field to study at Stanford.
With interests ranging from Middle
Eastern Studies to fiction writing.
Knight Fellows audit both under
graduate and professional classes.
For the first time in the program's
history, the Knight Fellowship will
sponsor the International Consor
tium of Investigative Journalists on
campus this November. Although
the speakers have not yet been deter
mined. lectures will be open to others
outside the program.

Twelve journalists from across the
country were awarded Knight fellow
ships this year.
"Our overall goal is to improve
the quality of journalism by exposing
outstanding journalists to a great uni
versity," explained Program Director
Jim Kisser.
The Knight Fellows were selected
based on their past record of accom
plishments. A total of SO applicants
submitted samples of their work and
study proposals last year.
"After 15 years of getting con
sumed by daily deadlines, it was time
to take a year off for some reflection
and study to become a thoughtful
journalist," said Knight Fellow
George I laj, who worked as an editor
for the Miami lierald before entering
into the program.
Since its establishment 34 years
ago, Knight Fellowships have also
been awarded to international jour

nalists from 40 different countries.
This year, eight were awarded fellow
ships.
"It brings to the American fellows
a very vivid understanding of how
journalism works in other countries
and the problems journalists in other
countries face." said Risser.
Knight Fellows must attend a
weekly seminar, spend the term in
Stanford residences and agree to re
turn to their news organizations at
the end of the fellowship. Spouses
and partners of Knight Fellows are
also invited to participate in all activ
ities.
"It's a great opportunity to step
out for nine months, broaden your
horizons and deepen your knowl
edge." said Rita Ncubauer. a Knight
Fellow from Frankfurt. Germany's
Frankfurter Rundschau.
This will be Risser's final year as
Knight Fellows program director.
