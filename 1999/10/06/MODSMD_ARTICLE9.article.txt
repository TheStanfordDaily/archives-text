# New defense bill includes payraise and incentives for recruits
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Clinton signed a $289 billion defense bill
Tuesday that includes a pay raise and other
incentives the Pentagon hopes will attract
more recruits and keep today's troops in uni
form longer.
"We owe you the tools you need to do the
job and the quality of life you and your fam
ilies deserve," Clinton told a couple hundred
service members at a brief ceremony on the
steps of the Pentagon overlooking the
Potomac River.
He said the pay package, including a 4:<S
percent across-the-board raise effective Jan.
1 and a change in pay scales effective next
July, represents the biggest increase in com
pensation in a generation.

"The excellence of our military is the
direct product of the excellence of our men
and women in uniform," he said. "This bill
invests in that excellence."
Clinton was joined in the ceremony by
Defense Secretary William Cohen and the
uniformed service chiefs.
"This bill says that the dedication and sac
rifices of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and
Marines, frequently deployed far from home
and family in defense of our security inter
ests around the world, are understood and
appreciated," said Army Gen. Henry 11.
Shclton. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
The bill, which authorizes an $lcX billion
increase in the defense bud.net over fiscal

1999, which ended Sept. 30. also directs a
reorganization of the Hnergy Department to
create a largely independent nuclear
weapons agency within the department. The
reorganization was prompted by controversy
over allegations of lax security and ( hinese
espionage involving the nuclear weapons
labs under the Energy Department's control.
The Pentagon announced Tuesday that
the Air Force ended the 1999 fiscal year with
a manpower shortage of about 10.0(H) — a
combination of too few recruits and too
many people — particularly pilots leaving
the service for commercial aviation jobs.
The Army, Navy and Marine Corps
reached troop strength levels set by
Congress, although only the Marines — the

smallest of the major services with 172.500
people — met their goals in both recruiting
and retention.
The Air Force, which for years didn't
need to bother with TV advertising, fell short
in both recruiting and retention, whereas the
Army overcame a recruiting shortfall by
exceeding its retention goal. The Navy,
which was nearly 7.000 recruits short in 1998.
met ils goal this year.
The fiscal 20(H) defense budget attempts
to address the problem of maintaining ade
quate force levels by providing a combina
tion of financial incentives. In addition to the
pay raise, the Pentagon also is authorized to
adjust pay scales next summer to put more
emphasis on rewarding performance than

longevity.
Also, Congress authorized ihe Pentagon
to make a major change in its retirement pay
system. Service members will he allowed to
retire alter 20 years of service at 50 percent
of basic pay. up from the current 40 percent.
Or. a service member could take a one-time
$30,000 cash bonus after 15 years of service,
stay another five years and then get the 40
percent retirement pay instead of 50 percent.
Pentagon officials said in advance of the
bill-signing ceremony that they believe these
adjustments will enable active-duty services
to retain more people. They also say the ser
vices are looking for more effective means of
recruiting young people, including making
more use of the Internet.
