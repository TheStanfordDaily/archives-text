# Albright visits Stanford to promote nuclear test treaty
## Secretary of State says Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would deter worldwide weapons proliferation 
### Sarah Rapawy Staff writer 
Secretary of State Madeline Albright
spoke yesterday at the Hoover Institute
about the need for the United States to
sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
for nuclear weapons.
Albright spoke to a crowd of approxi
mately 100 invited guests, including
Hoover fellows, professors and members
of the press.
The Senate is planning to vote on the
treaty in a matter of days, and Albright
emphasized the importance of its passing.
" This treaty is in the national security
interest of the U. 5.," said Albright. "By
preventing testing, the treaty will prohibit
the development of nuclear power by na
tions who don't already have it."
Although the treaty would deter the
worldwide proliferation of nuclear power,
Albright said it would not affect America's
reserves.
"We have conducted over I.(KK) nu
clear tests. The heads of our nuclear labs
agree we do not need to do more." said Al
bright.
Among other benefits, the treaty would

allow for on-site inspections and intrusive
monitoring of participating countries' ar
senals.
Albright stated that the more countries
that participate, the more difficult it will be
for countries to cheat on the test ban.
Albright stressed America's moral re
sponsibility to future generations.

'If we do not sign the treaty, we will
be left without a response to our
children when they ask why, when
we had a chance to put America on
the side of banning nuclear testing,
we said no. 1

"It we do not sign the treaty, we will be
left without a response to our children
when they ask why. when we had a chance
to put America on the side of banning nu
clear testing, we said no." Albright said.
Despite the Clinton Administration's
efforts, the treaty, which requires two
thirds majority for ratification, is widely

expected to go down to defeat when it goes
to the floor of the Senate.
Albright also voiced her concern about
declining funds for state and worldwide se
curity issues.
"From 1990 to 1994. our international
affairs budget hovered around $25 billion;
in the past five years this has declined
about 20 percent," said Albright.
Albright added that the House of Rep
resentatives' Monday decision to slash
President Bill Clinton's proposed fiscal
budget by $2 billion will result in further
reductions of State Department funds.
"Problems abroad, if left unattended,
will often come home to America. When
we provide resources to train police in for
eign terrorism ... to maintain peace in the
Middle East, the Balkans and Ireland, we
are helping America," said Albright.
Albright spoke of a bipartisan foreign
policy as central to ensuring American se
curity and solving international peace
keeping problems.
"Security is the solemn responsibility of
our judicial and legislative branches and
should be the starting point of beginning
negotiations of the 2(KK) fiscal budget,"
said Albrinht.
