# Clinton delays treaty

### 
WASHINGTON (AP)— Presi
dent Clinton signaled Wednesday
he would accept a postponement of
next week's scheduled vote on a
global nuclear test ban treaty rather
than risk near-certain defeat.
But Senate conservatives, led by
outspoken treaty foe Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.. demanded the president
request the delay in writing and also
promise not to seek action on it
through the remainder of his presi-
Vfoffcft -•>*-*'■< % T V
The White House quickly
brushed aside that demand.
"The issue of debating [the
treaty] should be dictated by the
national security interests of the
United States, not the political cal
endar." said White House
spokesman David Leavy.
"I'm not aware of any plans for
the president to send a letter, what
soever." he added.
Although Senate Majority Lead
er Trent I.ott. R-Miss., and Minori
ty Leader Tom Daschle. D-S.D..
indicated they still hoped to work
out some kind of deal, both sides
made preparations for the coming
battle.
"I thank the senators who are
here with us today and pray that
they can swell their ranks by next
week." Clinton said in an East
Room ceremony, where he collect
ed endorsements of the treaty from
32 Nobel laureates in physics and a
collection of retired military lead
ers.
Clinton, who has made the
treaty a top foreign policy priority,
earlier hinted he might accept a
delay if one were offered by Senate
leaders. "After two long years of
inaction, one week is very little time
for considered action." he said.
The treaty would extend the pre
sent international ban on nuclear
tests in the atmosphere to under
ground testing as well, resulting in a
total ban on all nuclear explosions,
no matter how small.
Democrats have balked at being
seen as initiating such a delay, or
being denied a chance to bring up
the treaty in the 20(H) presidential
election year.
But I Iclms. who had kept it bot
tled up in his Foreign Relations
Committee for two years, told a
news conference. "We're ready to
vote."
Democrats, seeing they lack the
votes to ratify the Comprehensive
lest Ban Treaty, "are trying to dic
tate the terms of their own surren
der." Helms said.
Helms' objection is significant
because under Senate rules any
move to cancel next week's vote
would require unanimous consent
of the Senate.
Furthermore, I lelms was joined
by other prominent Republicans in

demanding Clinton seek the delay
in writing.
"He must share with the Senate
leadership the burden of not going
forward." said Sen. John Warner.
R-Va., chairman of the Armed Ser
vices Committee.
The development came as Sen
ate Majority Leader Trent Lott. R-
Miss., and Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., were trying to
negotiate terms of a delay.
Without a delay, the Senate will
begin debating the treaty on Friday
and vote either next Tuesday or
Wednesday.
State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said if the Senate
wanted to propose another sched
ule, "we'd obviously want to be
supportive" of one that provides for
serious analysis and timely action
on the treaty.
"Obviously, the worst outcome
would be to vote this treaty down."
he said. "There's no question about
that."
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, preparing to testify in sup
port of the treaty on Thursday, told
senators in a letter that American
scientists were able to maintain the
U.S. nuclear deterrent without test
explosions.
The treaty, she said, would pro
vide an unprecedented monitoring
system to detect others' tests.
"If the United States rejects this
treaty and treats nuclear weapons
testing as 'business as usual.' so will
everyone else — and the nightmare
of proliferation will grow." she
wrote.
Meanwhile. Defense Secretary
William Cohen told the Senate
Armed Services Committee a vote
against the treaty could draw inter
national condemnation and even
lead to new nuclear testing else
where.
"II the Senate rejects the treaty,
the proliferation of nuclear
weapons is more likely, posing seri
ous challenges to our nonprolifera
tion goals." Cohen said.
He said it could thrust the Unit
ed States into a nuclear "no man's
land" from where it would be diffi
cult to condemn other nations for
conducting nuclear tests.
If rejected, it would be the first
nuclear arms control treaty ever
turned down by the United States.
The treaty has been signed by
154 nations, but ratified by only 48
Mexico becoming the latest to do
so on Wednesday. But only two of
the seven declared nuclear powers
Britain and France — have rati
fied it.
To be ratified, the treaty must be
approved by 67 senators, or two
thirds of the Senate. Even if all 45
Democrats vote for it. 22 Republi
cans must approve for it to pass.
