Online lecture notes
won't diminish class
attendence

It seems like students are always
seeking help with their classwork.
Between office hours, study groups,
various University programs and
tutors, there is plenty of help available
to college students looking for an
extra hand in their courses.
The Internet has been added to
that list in recent years. Assignments
can now be obtained over the Web.
work can be turned in online, and the
Internet can be an invaluable tool for
research.
The most recent addition to the
services the Internet offers to students
are lecture notes. Three Web sites,
Varsity.com, StudentU.com and
Study24-7.com, are offering lecture
notes free of charge to anyone who
logs onto their sites.
This growing availability of lecture
notes on the Web has caused some
professors and administrators to
worry that students are being given an
excuse to skip class. Why gel up early
and sit through a lecture when you
can simply log onto your computer
and print all the notes you might need
from the comforts of your room or
dormitory cluster?
Of course, this is the cynic's view.
The best way to utilize online notes is
as a supplemental material to an indi
vidual's studies. Some students may
abuse the process, but it is doubtful
that these are the industrious students
that take a rooted interest in whichev
er class they are taking.
There will always be students in a
class who aren't as interested and

hard-working as a professor might
like. Especially when considering
Stanford's General Education
Requirements, it's easy to see that
some students will inevitably have to
take a class in which they'd prefer not
to enroll.
These students don't need online
lecture notes. There's always a friend
you can depend upon to share his ot
her notes. Other times, students figure
they'll just use a textbook to learn
everything they need to know.
But the students who are truly
interested in a subject, the ones who
take a class not merely to fulfill a
requirement, are the students on
which professors should focus. These
are the ones they should put their
effort into in order to ensure an inter
esting and exciting learning environ
ment.
Some professors might claim that
their intellectual property is violated
by companies that place their notes
online, but such a rationale is silly and
goes against the basic nature of
aeademia. which is to loster the pur
suit of knowledge.
What a professor says in his or her
lectures is nothing secret. Most classes
involve one of two methods: teaching
concepts that are nothing new lo aca
demics: or opening a free discussion
of ideas in order to foster indepen
dent and original thought.
A professor seeking to put an
"intellectual copyright" on such mate
rial is misguided. By its very nature,
aeademia is not meant to be kept
secret or clandestine. It's understand
able that no one would want his or her
students lo think that they do not
need to attend cl.iss, but the students
who trulv care won't be swayed.
