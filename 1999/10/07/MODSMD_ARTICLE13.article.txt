Manager clarifies labor rela
tions at Stanford
I read with much interest Mr. Richard
Knowlton's letter to the editor in I he
Daily on Monday. Oct. 4. As Manager of
Labor Relations at Stanford and a regular
participant in the negotiations of labor
agreements, I feel compelled to clarify cer
tain impressions and statements given by
Mr. Knowlton's letter, which are not accu
rate.
Stanford has had a 27-year relationship
involving bargaining with United Stanford
Workers (a chapter of SEIU Local 715) and
with the Stanford Deputy Sheriffs' Associa
tion (SDSA), which represents Deputized
Patrol Officers and Community Services
Officers. The unions themselves are the
duly elected representatives of the members
/ workers. It is absolutely inaccurate to state
that the University views either the unions
or the union members as "necessary evils."
The union members are valued employees
of the University.
Mr. Knowlton describes his perspective
on differences in the retirement plans and
what he asserts have been the Union's pro
posals (in this case, USW) and the Universi
ty's responses concerning the issue of retire
ment plans.
As clarification, the employees repre
sented by USW are in the Stanford Retire
ment Annuity Plan (SRAP). This is a
defined benefit plan, which means it pays a
specified dollar income upon retirement
according to the terms of the plan. It is fund
ed entirely by the University, at no cost to
and with no contributions by the participat

ing employees.
Employees in the SRAP defined benefit
plan additionally have the option of making
contributions through a lax Deferred
Annuity ( I DA) with the same investment
choices as are featured in the Stanford Con
tributory Retirement Plan (SCRP)
described below. The University docs not
match those contributions because it is
already paying the full cost of the SRAP
defined benefit plan.
Alternately, faculty and unrepresented
staff are in the SC RP. This is a defined con
tribution plan, which specifies what percent
ages of income must be contributed by the
participant and by the University. It does
not guarantee any specific income upon
retirement. I lie benefit upon retirement is
dependent upon how the invested contribu
tions have fared in a variable market.
When Mr. Knowlton writes that "We
have also tried to get our retirement fund
to be in the same fund that Stanford pro
vides for non-union employees," he con
fuses the two types of plans. In a defined
benefit plan, which Stanford is fully fund
ing. the plan sponsor is responsible for
investing the fund assets to meet the future
obligations of the plan. Regardless of how
the assets are invested, the pension benefit
to the recipient upon retirement is fixed by
the terms of the plan, and the plan is
required to pay it regardless of what hap
pens to the market.
It is true that USW and the University
have exchanged many proposals and
counter-proposals regarding SRAP and
other retirement plans over the years, anil
the University has made presentations to

[ JSW leadership on the advantages and dis
advantages of a defined benefit plan versus
a defined contribution plan, based on the
demographics of its members.
It is not true, however, that for 20 years
the I Jnion has proposed a contributory plan
for the workers it represents. As with other
subjects of collective bargaining, after the
exchange of proposals and counter-propos
als. agreement is reached. The agreements,
as reached over the years, are reflected in
paragraphs 304 through 308 of the current
labor contract between USW and the Uni
versity.
Mr. Knowlton concludes by commenting
that the president of the University "... has
never gotten involved in union negotiations
and ... never will." The reality of labor
negotiations is that the Union picks a nego
tiating team, the University picks a negoti
ating team, and the terms of the eventual
contractual agreement are worked out at a
bargaining table where the two teams meet.
When there are material issues that cannot
be resolved, federal mediators are available
to help bring resolution.
Presidents of universities or companies
do not get involved in labor negotiations â€”
neither by sitting at the bargaining table nor
by intervening with what is going on at the
table. By the very nature of their positions
they are not "neutral" parties and therefore
cannot mediate disputes. In order for the
negotiating process to work, that is as it
should be.

Students ran for ice cream
too soon
I would like to commcnt on the actions
of many of the students who attended the
Ben and Jerry talk Tuesday night, spon
sored by the ASSIJ Speakers' Bureau.
I was disappointed to see such a great
number of students leave the auditorium in
order to rush for ice cream before the
speakers had concluded their question and
answer session.
The speakers deserve an apology for the
incredibly rude behavior of the students.
Furthermore. I would suggest that at
future events, it be made clear before the
speakers begin that no items will be dis
tributed prior to the conclusion of the event,
for while il was disappointing to sec so
many students leaving, it was more disap
pointing to see an ASSU representative
directing students towards the ice cream
before Ben and Jerry had finished their talk.
The students should have enough com
mon sense to stay in their seats until the
speakers are finished, and the ASSIJ should
do its best to help those who lack common
courtesy to understand that there are things
called manners and decorum.
The actions of the students last night
were an embarrassment to Stanford, and if 1
were Ben or Jerry, I would be insulted.
Stanford enjoys a reputation as one of
the world's elite universities, and as a col
lective student body, we have a responsibil
ity to behave accordingly.

the I Jnion has proposed a contributory plan
for the workers it represents. As with other
subjects of collective bargaining, after the
exchange of proposals and counter-propos
als. agreement is reached. The agreements,
as reached over the years, are reflected in
paragraphs 304 through 308 of the current
labor contract between USW and the Uni
versity.
Mr. Knowlton concludes by commenting
that the president of the University "... has
never gotten involved in union negotiations
and ... never will." The reality of labor
negotiations is that the Union picks a nego
tiating team, the University picks a negoti
ating team, and the terms of the eventual
contractual agreement are worked out at a
bargaining table where the two teams meet.
When there are material issues that cannot
be resolved, federal mediators are available
to help bring resolution.
Presidents of universities or companies
do not get involved in labor negotiations â€”
neither by sitting at the bargaining table nor
by intervening with what is going on at the
table. By the very nature of their positions
they are not "neutral" parties and therefore
cannot mediate disputes. In order for the
negotiating process to work, that is as it
should be.

Students ran for ice cream
too soon
I would like to commcnt on the actions
of many of the students who attended the
Ben and Jerry talk Tuesday night, spon
sored by the ASSIJ Speakers' Bureau.
I was disappointed to see such a great
number of students leave the auditorium in
order to rush for ice cream before the
speakers had concluded their question and
answer session.
The speakers deserve an apology for the
incredibly rude behavior of the students.
Furthermore. I would suggest that at
future events, it be made clear before the
speakers begin that no items will be dis
tributed prior to the conclusion of the event,
for while il was disappointing to sec so
many students leaving, it was more disap
pointing to see an ASSU representative
directing students towards the ice cream
before Ben and Jerry had finished their talk.
The students should have enough com
mon sense to stay in their seats until the
speakers are finished, and the ASSIJ should
do its best to help those who lack common
courtesy to understand that there are things
called manners and decorum.
The actions of the students last night
were an embarrassment to Stanford, and if 1
were Ben or Jerry, I would be insulted.
Stanford enjoys a reputation as one of
the world's elite universities, and as a col
lective student body, we have a responsibil
ity to behave accordingly.
