At the heart of Tresidder Union,
in a building usually buzzing with
music, laughter and gurgling coffee
machines, the empty Coffee House
sits silent.
A quick walk around the com
plex reveals that along with the loss
of a primary source of coffee, tables
and couches are empty and students
are searching for a new place to get
music and caffeine.
In response, the ASSU has joined
forces with the Dean of Students Of
fice and with Tresidder's catering
service, Bon Appetit, to bring some
rhythm back to the campus.
With that goal in mind, the trio is
launching a series of evening con
certs in Tresidder, the first of which
will take place tonight.
ASSU Undergraduate Senator
Mike Dudas, chair of the student af
fairs committee, said they plan to
host a concert every Thursday night
from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. All students
are encouraged to attend.
Dudas said he hopes to create "an
alternative to the Co 1 10. We want to
provide the students of Stanford
with a place where they can go to lis
ten to music and hang out."
To enhance the experience, re
freshments will be available.
Dudas said that the Corner Pock
et will sell Java City coffee until 11:00
p.m. and students will have four
types of beer available to purchase.
The grand opening tonight will
feature the band Scott Hay and
Company.
Organizers plan to continue the
concerts on a fairly regular basis until
the Coffee I louse re-opens, depend
ing on support and funding.
Dudas said organizers are look
ing for student bands to perform. In
terested bands should contact the
ASSU Student Affairs committee.
