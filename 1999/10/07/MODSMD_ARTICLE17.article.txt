# Seniors toast weekly pub nights
## 
### Mariam Ali Contributing writer 
In one dimly lit bar, the line for
drinks wraps around the room. The
young clientele is squeezed into
every available corner, chattering
excitedly, and loud shrieks of
laughter are frequently heard.
On top of a solid wood table,
five seniors enthusiastically dance
the Indian Bhangra to loud cheers
from the audience.
Everywhere, people are calling
out greetings.
Seniors say that the weekly Se
nior Pub Nights, occurring each
I'hursday at different local bars,
are one Stanford tradition that can
not be missed.
"As Senior Class presidents, our
responsibility is to make sure we
have class unity. That is why we
have Senior Pub Night," said se
nior Chris Collins, one of the
event's organizers.
Their mission is successful, judg
ing by the hundreds of seniors who
have shown up each Thursday for
the past two weeks to drink and
catch up with old friends.
AtCompadreson Sept. 24, a few
students were turned away because
the bar was overcrowded.
"I don't even drink, but I go,"
said senior Saad Rahim. "I have a
great time. You see so many people
you have not seen since freshman
year— everyone is there."
"1 am going to go every day of
the year," concurred his friend, se
nior Saad Khan.
Although seniors say they go
first and foremost to meet old
friends, they also point out that
Pub Nights are a welcome break
from problem sets and the stress of
senior year.
Moreover, the crowded bars are
conducive to meeting unknown
classmates.
"1 want to see the people I had
CIV with, and I want to get to know
people I have never spoken to be
fore," said senior Martin Zemitis

when asked why he planned It) go
to tonight's soiree.
Pub Night is a long-standing
Stanford tradition. During winter
quarter. University President Ger
hard Casper will make his annual
appearance to take tequila shots
with the senior class, according to
Collins.
"[Pub Night] dates as lar back as
I can remember," said Reiko
Osaki, a senior class president.
The event is more social than al
coholic, say the class presidents,
who have made special arrange
ments with the bars to serve non-al
coholic beverages free or at a lower
cost.
Also, although bars generally do
not allow minors to enter, all se
niors are allowed into the designat
ed bars.
Of course, they must be 21 to
drink.
In order to prevent drunk dri
ving, Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya has helped
the event's organizers hire a special
Marguerite shuttle to transport se

niors directly to the bar that is host
ing the event.
The free shuttle leaves every 15
minutes from Tresidder Union.
This long-standing precaution has
ensured years of incident-free Pub
Nights, according to Osaki.
In fact, the expense of alcohol
seems to be the only criticism that
seniors have.
"I was looking forward to hav
ing some 'senior' benefits," said se
nior Cody Harris. "But instead of
pouring the alcohol down our
throats, we had to pay some hefty
prices."
Drink prices are reduced for
Pub Nights, but a typical Margarita
still sells for $2.50 and a pitcher of
beer for about $6, according to
Collins.
Despite the price of partaking in
the festivities, the seniors keep on
coming back every week. "'1 went to
the first one and I am going
tonight," said Harris. "The only
thing that kept me last week was
that our tires blew out on the way
there."
