Despite the low rate of dormi
tory break-ins this year. Stanford
University officials are taking
measures to improve residence se
curity and increase awareness of
potential dangers.
"For a large suburban universi
ty, Stanford is a very safe campus,
and student housing is very safe,"
said Rodger Whitney, director of
Student Housing Services.
"Break-ins are a very rare phe
nomenon."
Still, theft does happen, and
housing officials urge students to
take basic precautions.
During the school year, the
most frequent breach of security
occurs when residents prop doors
open.
"There are bad people in the
world who will come in through
those doors," said Diana Conklin,
graduate housing manager and
former manager of undergraduate
housing.
Conklin said that during her ex
perience in undergraduate hous
ing, "all theft occurred when peo
ple walked in through propped
doors."
Stanford has "no fences, no
walls to keep [potential criminals]
out." Conklin said, and that makes
students' roles pivotal in maintain
ing security.
"We really do rely on students
to keep their buildings secure,"
Whitney said. "The best solution is
for [students] to help us in every
way they can."
But many students express little
concern about residence security.
"1 feel pretty comfortable in my
dorm." said sophomore Brian

Ball. However, he added that once
security becomes a more pressing
issue, students pay attention. "Last
year, in [Florence Moore HallJ,
there was an incident of a peeping
torn ... so we became a little more
conscious about keeping the out
side doors locked," Ball said.
Although housing officials em
phasize students' essential roles in
security, they have taken matters
into their own hands as well.
During the 1998 summer quar
ter, the University installed "chain
devices" to protect the first-floor
windows of Cowell Cluster, since
the windows' proximity to the
ground made them accessible to
intruders.
In addition to the chains at
Cowell Cluster, screens will be in
stalled on first-floor windows in
housing around Lake Lagunita.
Housing break-ins, although
uncommon, tend to occur more
frequently during winter break,
when most campus housing is un
occupied. Whitney said the Uni
versity hires security guards during
this period to reduce the risk of
burglary.
Although the University has
taken measures to discourage
break-ins, residents are ultimately
responsible for keeping their hous
es safe.
"There's no way [for us] to
make sure that doors and windows
are locked at all times," said Whit
ney. Campus housing includes al
most 200 buildings and about
40,000 doors.
Whitney advocated one main
deterrent to theft in residences.
"We strongly urge students to
keep doors locked at all times," he
said.
