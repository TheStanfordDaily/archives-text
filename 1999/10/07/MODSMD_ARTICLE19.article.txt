## Cardinal golfers look to send Goodwin out in style 
### Brett Kaufman 
With only two tournaments in the books this
golf season, the Stanford's men's golf team is
wasting no time marching toward its goal of win
ning the national title and bringing back the pro
gram s glory from the Tiger Woods era of the mid
19905.
In its first tournament, the three-day 1 lusky In
vitational hosted by the University of Washing
ton.the Cardinal claimed the title with a team
score of 1 106 for a nine-stroke victory over run
ner-up Oregon.
Led by junior Alex Aragon's dazzling perfor
mance (69-75-70-214). the team started off the tall
season by blitzing the field and posting a dramat
ic final-round score, gaining 12 strokes on second
round leader UCLA for the victory. The win was
Aragon's first individual collegiate victory.
"The win was something 1 really did not ex
pect." Aragon said. "I always hope to play well
and help the team, but this win was certainly not
something that I believed would happen."
"Alex has been a great surprise so far." said
head coach Wally Goodwin. "I le's really demon
strated an 180-degree turnaround from last year
in terms of personality, desire and willingness to
achieve."
Aragon credits this reversal to changes in his
game and mental outlook made over the summer.
Also leading the team in Seattle was team captain
Dusty Brett (75-75-70-220), who finished fourth.
Brett, a senior, was part of the final-round charge
led by the Cardinal's more experienced players.
"Our young guys got us going, but our experi
ence really came through on the last day." Good
win said. The youth of which Goodwin speaks so
fondly includes freshmen Jim Seki (76-76-76-
228). Ron Won (76-74-77-227) and George
Downing (did not play).
"We are part of something special and want to

make Stanford a golf powerhouse once again,"
Seki said.
"They're studs. They're determined and have
an immense desire to make an impact," Goodwin
said of his freshmen standouts.
Stanford played in the second tournament of
its fall season last weekend at Conway Farms out
side of Chicago. T he field for the Windon Memo
rial Classic was extensive, including several na
tionally ranked teams, and was put to the test on
an extremely difficult golf course that hosts many
major amateur tournaments throughout the year.
The Cardinal led after two rounds, hut the
windy conditions in the Windy City on the final
day proved to be too much of an obstacle for the
squad. Stanford rarely gets to practice in ex
tremely windy conditions, so when confronted
with them, the outcome is not always bright.
"Conway Farms gave us a chance to evaluate
how we'd fare on another great golf course. The
wind gave us trouble on the final day, but I believe
that we had the best team there," Goodwin said.
Brett agrees with Goodwin, whose retirement
awaits him at the end of the year.
"We have so much depth, and that's what it
takes in college golf." Brett said. "We will be a
force this year because we are driven to succeed
and we motivate each other."
The Cardinal finished third at Conway Farms
despite another stellar individual effort from
Brett (73-71-75-219). He finished in 10th place
overall for the tournament.
"Dusty's steady as a rock. We can always count
on him to come through in a tough situation."
Goodwin said.
In addition to the three freshmen, the Cardinal
also landed sophomore Philip Rowe, a transfer
from England. Rowe's impressive credentials in
clude his membership on the 1999 Walker Cup
team lor Great Britain and Ireland, which defeat
ed the United States squad earlier this year. The

Walker Cup is a biannual team event between
amateurs from both sides of the Atlantic. Rowe
has already played in both of the Cardinal's tour
naments, placing 21st in Seattle and 27th in Chica
go. and figures to play a major role in the coming
year.
Goodwin is optimistic about his team's
chances to make a run at another NCAA Cham
pionship.
"I know that we will go and plav our best at
every event. Nobody will give up a shot, nobody
detracts from team chemistry." Of course, his
goal, as well as the team's, is winning. "You al
ways have to fire for the top. or else you'll never
get there."
Besides the Cardinal's overwhelming individ
ual talents, Goodwin sees the team's collective
unity as its most important asset. Though it is dif
ficult for players so accustomed to seeing only
their name on the scoreboard to adjust to the col
lege team game, Goodwin tries to emphasize the
team's success as the No. 1 goal.
"College golf is entirely a team game," Good
win said. "This year, we have a great feeling of to
getherness. We have no jealousy and everyone
roots for one another. The players left off the trav
eling team call and want to know what's happen
ing. It's truly special."
Brett will take on the role of captain and, as the
team's lone senior, must use his experience to
help the younger members of the squad. Good
win has already bestowed upon him the responsi
bility to assist in decisions about the traveling
players for each tournament.
"I'm excited about working more closely with
Wally." Brett said. "1 will be a liaison between the
players and the coach, a duty that will be one of my
most important ones as captain."

he invaluable. "Dusty is the kind of
guy that anyone on the team can talk
to about something they want ad
dressed by the coach. That is some
thing we have been lacking the last
few years."
If the first two tournaments are
any indication for the coming year,
Stanford students are certainly in for
a treat.
Many critics considered the grad
uation of Joel Kribel. the Cardinal's

standout first-team Ail-American in
1998. to be too much for the team to
overcome. However, the youth and
promise of this year's team were
clearly overlooked.
The team's performance in the
first two events of the fall season
proves that the ability and desire
needed to succeed in the college
game are present. The rest wilTton
sist of simply putting all of these phe
nomenal qualities together.
"We have a combination of the
best players and the best kids in the
country," Goodwin said of this
year's team. "You can't beat that."
