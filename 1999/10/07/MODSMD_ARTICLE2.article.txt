# Protesters decry U.S. sanctions in Iraq
## 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Secretary of State Madeline Albright drove by the
corner of Serra and Galvez Streets yesterday morning
with a scowl on her face.
Perhaps she was thinking about her noon talk at the
Hoover Institution. But more likely, she saw the near
ly 30 students and community members standing on
the sidewalk bearing signs criticizing U.S. sanctions
against Iraq.
The sanctions were imposed by the United Nations
at the end of the Gulf War in 1991. and experts estimate
the death toll at 1.5 million since the sanctions began.
Although the group was small and quiet, the mes
sages were unequivocal. Signs read, "The Ends Don't
Justify The Means," "Stop Bill Clinton's Wars" and
"Let Iraq Live! Lift the Sanctions!"
Many protesters also referred to Albright's now-in
famous "60 Minutes" interview in 1996. In the inter
view, reporter Leslie Stahl asked Albright if the death
of 500,000 Iraqi children was a price worth paying for
the sanctions policy, and Albright replied affirmative
ly*
Nabeel Ibrahim, a doctoral student in electrical en
gineering. said he considered Albright's response "in
humane."
Paul George, head of the Peninsula Peace and Jus
tice Center, one of the groups that organized the
protest, said the most striking part of Albright's answer

was that she did not challenge the numbers.
"Eighty percent of war casualties are civilians. It's
not foreign policy, it is mass slaughter." George said.
Protesters criticized U.S. policy toward Iraq more
generally as well. Middle Eastern History Prof. Joel
Beinin, who attended the protest, said the original
regime of inspections and sanctions has "collapsed" as
a result of last December's bombings of Iraq.
According to Beinin, when the United States
bombed Iraq in the spring of 1998. it was acting almost
unilaterally.
With the exception of Great Britain, no IJ.N. Secu
rity Council member nations supported the bombing,
citing economic interests in Iraq and concern over the
huge civilian casualties, Beinin said.
"[The United States and Great Britain] haven't
gone back to the Security Council because France.
China and Russia don't support sanctions. [Vet] they
claim to be implementing resolutions of the U.N.," he
said.
Beinin said that although U.S. policy toward Iraq
has been designed to either eliminate Saddam Hussein
or to make him agree to U.S. demands, sanctions have
accomplished neither goal.
Calling Hussein "a brutal dictator." Beinin said the
sanctions have weakened internal dissent because op
position leaders are seen as collaborating with the
United States.

Protesters gathered near Hoover Tower to voice their opposition to Iraqi sanctions, which have been
maintained by the Clinton administration with Albright's support.
"It is public knowledge that the
CIA is promoting opposition" to
I lussein, Beinin said.
In light of that, he suggested, it re
mains unclear why the sanctions
have not ended other than that the
United States will not admit that the
policy has failed.
Several students said that while

they hoped the informal protest
would send a direct message to Al
bright, they also wanted to focus at
tention on U.S. policy toward Iraq.
"I wrote a lot of my papers last
year on issues relating to Iraq," said
sophomore Amber Baker
"I disagree with the sanctions
policy, and I might as well hold a sign
[saying that J."
"Generally, I'm interested in
children's rights and in opposing the
large-scale slaughter of people to

prove a point," said Steve Lindo
holm, a master's student in comput
er science who attended the protest.
Student opposition can be criti
cal, according to George.
"There are more and more arti
cles and editorials questioning the
policy [nationally]," George said. In
those broader efforts to end sanc
tions, George said, campus organiz
ing "plays a key role."
"Anything that can be done,
must be done," he said.
