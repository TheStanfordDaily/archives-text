Jnatches in straight sets, the sixth

VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: N0.6 Stanford (11-1. 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference) at No. 8
UCLA (12-1,4-0), 7 p.m.
Friday: Stanford at No. 1 <S USC (8-3,
3-1). p.m.

The fact that the Cardinal is
presently riding a huge wave of mo
mentum shouldn't hurt as it heads

down South. The team added to its
home winning streak at Maples
Pavilion against Oregon and Ore
gon State, bumping the current tally
to 33-straight matches since 1997.
Stanford has also won 49 consecu
tive Pac-10 home games since 1994.
an impressive feat that it hopes to
prolong. Finally, the Cardinal
squad is presently sporting a 10-
game winning streak and looking to
add to it as it embarks on this road
trip.
However, two imposing obsta
cles stand in Stanford's way, name
ly No. 8 UCLA (12-1, 4-0) and No.
18 USC (8-3, 3-1) squads that are
eager to challenge the Cardinal's
Pac-10 dominance and put a stop to
their string of victories.
The Bruins currently trail the
Cardinal by only a half-game in the
conference standings, while the
Trojans are a game and a half back.
Both teams are hungry for respect
and gunning for the Stanford team.
UCLA should prove to be one of
the most formidable opponents the
Cardinal has met this season. The
Bruins, off to their best start since
1994 and currently riding a 10-game
winning streak of their own. com
pleted three-game sweeps on the
road against Washington and
Washington State last week in con
ference play.
They will be happy to return
home to Pauley Pavilion and to
their raucous Bruin fans as they
take on Stanford this Thursday.
UCLA is one of the few teams in
the country that has an all-time win
ning record against the Cardinal (31
wins to Stanford's 22). although
Stanford defeated the Bruins both
times the two teams met last year in
intense matches decided in four and
five games.
UCLA will be led bv junior mid
dle blocker and team captain Elisa
beth Bachman. nicknamed "Wi/.,"
who averaged 2.33 blocks per game
last week against Washington and
Washington State.
Although not as highly ranked
as the Bruins. USC should be a
strong test for Stanford as well. Al
though Stanford holds an overall
40-9 all time record against them,
the Trojans knocked off the Cardi
nal in four games in the regular-sea
son finale last year, a loss Stanford
is eager to avenge.
USC has won six of its last seven.
