VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: N0.6 Stanford (11-1. 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference) at No. 8
UCLA (12-1,4-0), 7 p.m.
Friday: Stanford at No. 1 <S USC (8-3,
3-1). p.m.

The fact that the Cardinal is
presently riding a huge wave of mo
mentum shouldn't hurt as it heads

down South. The team added to its
home winning streak at Maples
Pavilion against Oregon and Ore
gon State, bumping the current tally
to 33-straight matches since 1997.
Stanford has also won 49 consecu
tive Pac-10 home games since 1994.
an impressive feat that it hopes to
prolong. Finally, the Cardinal
squad is presently sporting a 10-
game winning streak and looking to
add to it as it embarks on this road
trip.
However, two imposing obsta
cles stand in Stanford's way, name
ly No. 8 UCLA (12-1, 4-0) and No.
18 USC (8-3, 3-1) squads that are
eager to challenge the Cardinal's
Pac-10 dominance and put a stop to
their string of victories.
The Bruins currently trail the
Cardinal by only a half-game in the
conference standings, while the
Trojans are a game and a half back.
Both teams are hungry for respect
and gunning for the Stanford team.
UCLA should prove to be one of
the most formidable opponents the
Cardinal has met this season. The
Bruins, off to their best start since
1994 and currently riding a 10-game
winning streak of their own. com
pleted three-game sweeps on the
road against Washington and
Washington State last week in con
ference play.
They will be happy to return
home to Pauley Pavilion and to
their raucous Bruin fans as they
take on Stanford this Thursday.
UCLA is one of the few teams in
the country that has an all-time win
ning record against the Cardinal (31
wins to Stanford's 22). although
Stanford defeated the Bruins both
times the two teams met last year in
intense matches decided in four and
five games.
UCLA will be led bv junior mid
dle blocker and team captain Elisa
beth Bachman. nicknamed "Wi/.,"
who averaged 2.33 blocks per game
last week against Washington and
Washington State.
Although not as highly ranked
as the Bruins. USC should be a
strong test for Stanford as well. Al
though Stanford holds an overall
40-9 all time record against them,
the Trojans knocked off the Cardi
nal in four games in the regular-sea
son finale last year, a loss Stanford
is eager to avenge.
USC has won six of its last seven.

its sole loss in this stretch coming
against Arizona, and moved up two
spots in the rankings after defeating
Washington and Washington State
on the road last week. The Trojans
will be hosting only their second
homestand of the season and will be
looking to defend their home court
with a vengeance.
Sophomore middle blocker Jen
nifer Pahl heads an impressive
starting lineup that also includes
defensive standouts Janae Henry
and Antoinette Polk, both junior
outside hitters.
In these two important matches,
Stanford will once again look to se
nior outside hitter / middle blocker
Kerri Walsh and freshman outside
hitter Logan Tom to lead the way.
Walsh, a three-time All-American,
leads the team in digs with 121. Tom
recorded 26 kills versus Oregon
State, the most for a Stanford play
er since Kristin Folkl matched that
feat in 1997.

The team will need both players
to play up to or above the impres
sive standards they have already set
for themselves if the Cardinal
hopes to continue its winning ways.
Junior setter Robyn Lewis, coming
off her best showing of the season
against Oregon State, will also be
expected to contribute against the
Bruins and Trojans.
Sophomore middle blocker Sara
Sandrik. another player expected
to see significant action this week
end. expresses the teams optimism
and excitement for the opportunity
to face off against two of the Pac
-10"s top teams.
"They are two great teams and it
wjll be two great matches, but we
feel very confident. We've had in
tense practices in preparation and
we realize this is going to be a time
to test ourselves."
The Cardinal realizes that on
paper UCLA will be the tougher of
the two matchups, but the team will
be equally focused for both games
because, as Sandrik said. "USC is
tough to plav at home but we want
revenue."
