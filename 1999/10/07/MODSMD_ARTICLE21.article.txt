# Freshman class adds depth, speed to running powerhouse
## Stanford welcomes new pack 
### Nancy Lord Contributing writer 
Ask almost any athlete on the Stanford campus why
he or she picked Stanford and you would get the same an
swer: no other school can rival the combination of world
class athletic teams and academic reputation.
When the time for final college decisions came, the
freshmen on this year's men's cross country team all
seemed to recognize that fact and attribute it for their de
cision to come here. Thanks to that well deserved repu
tation. this year's team gained a champion group of re
cruits that will help keep the Cardinal a dominating force
in the cross country world.
Although the freshman class of runners is still in its
first season here, it brings a great deal of experience in
high-level competition to the team. The group has expe
rience in regional, national and international competi
tion. with multiple state champions and Footlocker Na
tional Cross Country Championships finalists.
Adam Tenforde, originally from Richland Wash.,
placed third at Footlocker Nationals in Florida during his
senior season. I le also competed on the U.S. team at the
Junior World Championships in Belfast, Ireland.
Even for an athlete with a strong high-school back
ground. the shift to college can be challenging. "The tran
sition was a bit difficult at first, just because my body had
to respond to doing much more work than 1 had ever
done before in the summer," Tenforde said. "But now
that I am training with the team, it is easier to handle the
workload just because you have a network of people
there that are doing the same thing."
Nathan Miller, all the way from Erial. N.J.. was an
other Footlocker finalist and top-ranked distance run
ner. I le has found the transition relatively smooth thanks
to support from the team
"It hasn't been as overwhelming as I thought it would
be," Miller said. "I think that it's been that way because
we have had such a great coaching staff, a lot of support
from them, as well as a lot of other freshmen going
through the same thing. It makes it easier when so many
other people are dealing with the same situation."

The close-knit nature of the team seems to be highly
emphasized.
"The'gttys nrc definitely close on the team, especially
the freshmen. We have a great deal of classes together
and usually eat at the same dining hall together for most
of the meals." Tenforde said. "The veterans are very pos
itive and supportive. There isn't really an attitude of su
periority on the team, just of the older guvs helping the
younger guys out based on experience."
"I think the younger runners on the team have a great
respect for the veterans, both for what they have done,
and what they are capable of accomplishing in the future.
In general there is always a respect for each other that we
have all decided to continue our running on the colle
giate level." Sean Knapp said. Knapp. from Fox Island
Wash., was one of the topmilers and two-milers in the na
tion his senior year.
While the squad is a tight-knit group, the experience
of competing on a top collegiate team can be strenuous
and difficult as well. All of the men deal with the stress in
different ways.
Miller deals with these hardships through shared ex
periences with teammates and his love of the sport.
"I think of it as being really hard, but at the same time
I enjoy it. I like the intensity. I like the difficulty, it's not
like it's always fun. 1 don't really feel like going out and
running every single day. but I do it because I like it so
much," he said.
"I think that the number of freshmen has helped with
| the pressure and expectations]. I haven't felt much pres
sure: I want to perform at my highest and that's what they
expect from me and I think we have that understanding.
That's all we really need."
For Knapp. his favorite and most difficult parts of
competing here are the same, and he also looks to his
teammates for support. "Ironically they are the same
thing. It is hard to go from being the best on your team
(for most of the guys, best in t heir state). toa team where
you are struggling to make top 20.1 lowcver. running is a
sport where athletes feed off of those around them, and
the Stanford team provides a very
good environment in which runners
can improve and develop," Knapp
said.
Tenforde feels a responsibility to
perform for his teammates. "There
really aren't defined do or die" atti
tudes really present on the team.
There's just a hard work ethic in
stilled in everyone that drives us to
perform to our best and a feeling of
responsibility to not let the other
guys down," Tenforde said.
One part of the team experience
that many of the men cited as excep

tionally helpful was the team retreat.
The last couple weeks of the sum
mer, the team has gone to Mam
moth, Calif., to train together and to
bond.
"The experience so far has been
awesome," said Andy Powell of
North Eaton. Mont. "I really bonded
with the team at camp. Training has
never been better. So many of the
older members have helped guide
me and pull me along. Coach Lanan
na has kept a close eye on me so 1 do
not train too hard. Jake Maas has
done a great job in his role as cap
tain."
Many said it was nice to be able to
start school already knowing people
and having a sense of belonging.

"When we were at training camp
there was a lot of team bonding going
on. Basically all you do up there is
live together, eat, clean and sleep in
the same place, and all you do is run
and hang out," Miller said. "You get
to know everyone and you get to
form some kind of relationship with
everyone. That definitely helped for
the preseason, so 1 felt like I knew
someone when I came here."
Of everything, the thing that was
mentioned most often as the best
thing about the team was the people.
"I love the team aspects and the
friendships that form from being on
the team," Tenforde said.
The tightness of the team encour
ages each member to help the others

out. "Each person on the team has
added so much to the experience so
far. My goal is to be able to help out
the team in whatever way possible,"
Powell said.
"A high level of intensity is ever
present on the team, but with it you
can always find an extremely sup
portive group of teammates, Knapp
said.
The men also seem to be happy
with Stanford in general. In a com
monly mentioned sentiment about
the entire Stanford experience,
Knapp noted his satisfaction with the
University. "The campus is beauti
ful, the people friendly, the courses
challenging and the food digestible;
it can't get much better,"' he said.

Tenforde feels a responsibility to
perform for his teammates. "There
really aren't defined do or die" atti
tudes really present on the team.
There's just a hard work ethic in
stilled in everyone that drives us to
perform to our best and a feeling of
responsibility to not let the other
guys down," Tenforde said.
One part of the team experience
that many of the men cited as excep

tionally helpful was the team retreat.
The last couple weeks of the sum
mer, the team has gone to Mam
moth, Calif., to train together and to
bond.
"The experience so far has been
awesome," said Andy Powell of
North Eaton. Mont. "I really bonded
with the team at camp. Training has
never been better. So many of the
older members have helped guide
me and pull me along. Coach Lanan
na has kept a close eye on me so 1 do
not train too hard. Jake Maas has
done a great job in his role as cap
tain."
Many said it was nice to be able to
start school already knowing people
and having a sense of belonging.

"When we were at training camp
there was a lot of team bonding going
on. Basically all you do up there is
live together, eat, clean and sleep in
the same place, and all you do is run
and hang out," Miller said. "You get
to know everyone and you get to
form some kind of relationship with
everyone. That definitely helped for
the preseason, so 1 felt like I knew
someone when I came here."
Of everything, the thing that was
mentioned most often as the best
thing about the team was the people.
"I love the team aspects and the
friendships that form from being on
the team," Tenforde said.
The tightness of the team encour
ages each member to help the others

out. "Each person on the team has
added so much to the experience so
far. My goal is to be able to help out
the team in whatever way possible,"
Powell said.
"A high level of intensity is ever
present on the team, but with it you
can always find an extremely sup
portive group of teammates, Knapp
said.
The men also seem to be happy
with Stanford in general. In a com
monly mentioned sentiment about
the entire Stanford experience,
Knapp noted his satisfaction with the
University. "The campus is beauti
ful, the people friendly, the courses
challenging and the food digestible;
it can't get much better,"' he said.

In spite of the grueling pace of collegiate competition, the new faces of Stanford men's cross country are already making contributions to
the Cardinal legacy.
Ask almost any athlete on the Stanford campus why
he or she picked Stanford and you would get the same an
swer: no other school can rival the combination of world
class athletic teams and academic reputation.
When the time for final college decisions came, the
freshmen on this year's men's cross country team all
seemed to recognize that fact and attribute it for their de
cision to come here. Thanks to that well deserved repu
tation. this year's team gained a champion group of re
cruits that will help keep the Cardinal a dominating force
in the cross country world.
Although the freshman class of runners is still in its
first season here, it brings a great deal of experience in
high-level competition to the team. The group has expe
rience in regional, national and international competi
tion. with multiple state champions and Footlocker Na
tional Cross Country Championships finalists.
Adam Tenforde, originally from Richland Wash.,
placed third at Footlocker Nationals in Florida during his
senior season. I le also competed on the U.S. team at the
Junior World Championships in Belfast, Ireland.
Even for an athlete with a strong high-school back
ground. the shift to college can be challenging. "The tran
sition was a bit difficult at first, just because my body had
to respond to doing much more work than 1 had ever
done before in the summer," Tenforde said. "But now
that I am training with the team, it is easier to handle the
workload just because you have a network of people
there that are doing the same thing."
Nathan Miller, all the way from Erial. N.J.. was an
other Footlocker finalist and top-ranked distance run
ner. I le has found the transition relatively smooth thanks
to support from the team
"It hasn't been as overwhelming as I thought it would
be," Miller said. "I think that it's been that way because
we have had such a great coaching staff, a lot of support
from them, as well as a lot of other freshmen going
through the same thing. It makes it easier when so many
other people are dealing with the same situation."

The close-knit nature of the team seems to be highly
emphasized.
"The'gttys nrc definitely close on the team, especially
the freshmen. We have a great deal of classes together
and usually eat at the same dining hall together for most
of the meals." Tenforde said. "The veterans are very pos
itive and supportive. There isn't really an attitude of su
periority on the team, just of the older guvs helping the
younger guys out based on experience."
"I think the younger runners on the team have a great
respect for the veterans, both for what they have done,
and what they are capable of accomplishing in the future.
In general there is always a respect for each other that we
have all decided to continue our running on the colle
giate level." Sean Knapp said. Knapp. from Fox Island
Wash., was one of the topmilers and two-milers in the na
tion his senior year.
While the squad is a tight-knit group, the experience
of competing on a top collegiate team can be strenuous
and difficult as well. All of the men deal with the stress in
different ways.
Miller deals with these hardships through shared ex
periences with teammates and his love of the sport.
"I think of it as being really hard, but at the same time
I enjoy it. I like the intensity. I like the difficulty, it's not
like it's always fun. 1 don't really feel like going out and
running every single day. but I do it because I like it so
much," he said.
"I think that the number of freshmen has helped with
| the pressure and expectations]. I haven't felt much pres
sure: I want to perform at my highest and that's what they
expect from me and I think we have that understanding.
That's all we really need."
For Knapp. his favorite and most difficult parts of
competing here are the same, and he also looks to his
teammates for support. "Ironically they are the same
thing. It is hard to go from being the best on your team
(for most of the guys, best in t heir state). toa team where
you are struggling to make top 20.1 lowcver. running is a
sport where athletes feed off of those around them, and
the Stanford team provides a very
good environment in which runners
can improve and develop," Knapp
said.
Tenforde feels a responsibility to
perform for his teammates. "There
really aren't defined do or die" atti
tudes really present on the team.
There's just a hard work ethic in
stilled in everyone that drives us to
perform to our best and a feeling of
responsibility to not let the other
guys down," Tenforde said.
