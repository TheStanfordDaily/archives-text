# Freshman class adds depth, speed to running powerhouse
## Stanford welcomes new pack 
### Nancy Lord Contributing writer 
Ask almost any athlete on the Stanford campus why
he or she picked Stanford and you would get the same an
swer: no other school can rival the combination of world
class athletic teams and academic reputation.
When the time for final college decisions came, the
freshmen on this year's men's cross country team all
seemed to recognize that fact and attribute it for their de
cision to come here. Thanks to that well deserved repu
tation. this year's team gained a champion group of re
cruits that will help keep the Cardinal a dominating force
in the cross country world.
Although the freshman class of runners is still in its
first season here, it brings a great deal of experience in
high-level competition to the team. The group has expe
rience in regional, national and international competi
tion. with multiple state champions and Footlocker Na
tional Cross Country Championships finalists.
Adam Tenforde, originally from Richland Wash.,
placed third at Footlocker Nationals in Florida during his
senior season. I le also competed on the U.S. team at the
Junior World Championships in Belfast, Ireland.
Even for an athlete with a strong high-school back
ground. the shift to college can be challenging. "The tran
sition was a bit difficult at first, just because my body had
to respond to doing much more work than 1 had ever
done before in the summer," Tenforde said. "But now
that I am training with the team, it is easier to handle the
workload just because you have a network of people
there that are doing the same thing."
Nathan Miller, all the way from Erial. N.J.. was an
other Footlocker finalist and top-ranked distance run
ner. I le has found the transition relatively smooth thanks
to support from the team
"It hasn't been as overwhelming as I thought it would
be," Miller said. "I think that it's been that way because
we have had such a great coaching staff, a lot of support
from them, as well as a lot of other freshmen going
through the same thing. It makes it easier when so many
other people are dealing with the same situation."

The close-knit nature of the team seems to be highly
emphasized.
"The'gttys nrc definitely close on the team, especially
the freshmen. We have a great deal of classes together
and usually eat at the same dining hall together for most
of the meals." Tenforde said. "The veterans are very pos
itive and supportive. There isn't really an attitude of su
periority on the team, just of the older guvs helping the
younger guys out based on experience."
"I think the younger runners on the team have a great
respect for the veterans, both for what they have done,
and what they are capable of accomplishing in the future.
In general there is always a respect for each other that we
have all decided to continue our running on the colle
giate level." Sean Knapp said. Knapp. from Fox Island
Wash., was one of the topmilers and two-milers in the na
tion his senior year.
While the squad is a tight-knit group, the experience
of competing on a top collegiate team can be strenuous
and difficult as well. All of the men deal with the stress in
different ways.
Miller deals with these hardships through shared ex
periences with teammates and his love of the sport.
"I think of it as being really hard, but at the same time
I enjoy it. I like the intensity. I like the difficulty, it's not
like it's always fun. 1 don't really feel like going out and
running every single day. but I do it because I like it so
much," he said.
"I think that the number of freshmen has helped with
| the pressure and expectations]. I haven't felt much pres
sure: I want to perform at my highest and that's what they
expect from me and I think we have that understanding.
That's all we really need."
For Knapp. his favorite and most difficult parts of
competing here are the same, and he also looks to his
teammates for support. "Ironically they are the same
thing. It is hard to go from being the best on your team
(for most of the guys, best in t heir state). toa team where
you are struggling to make top 20.1 lowcver. running is a
sport where athletes feed off of those around them, and
