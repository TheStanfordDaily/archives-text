# Murley's strong early season powers cross country
## Running into the spotlight 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
To read what's been written so
far of the life story of senior
Thomas Murlev would be less like
perusing your roommate's tran
script and more like devouring one
of those 'choose your own adven
ture" books. To race for the USA
junior Pan-Am team in Cuba, turn
to 1997. To take a detour to Flo
rence. Italy, to be immersed in art
history, try 1999.
Murlev's life has been marked
by a scries of these life-changing
events. The fact that thev've led

this backwoods Kentucky boy to
Stanford to compete at the top of
the collegiate running scene makes
the story tough to put down.
Raised in rural Eli/abethtown
(population 20.000). Murley began
his running career early under the
tutelage of his father, a road-racing
veteran. Even in elementary
school, the elder Murley would
train with Thomas, running up and
down the two-mile gravel lane that
led to their home. By the eighth
grade. Murley had placed 14th in
the high-school state cross country
meet.
Hut in ninth grade, the first

major decision came for Murley.
Would he stick with running or
play percussion in the marching
hand?
"I consider that decision to be a
crucial turning point in my life."
Murley said. "Music is my passion,
hut marching band was actually
very physical, so I had to make a
choice."
He stuck with running, and it
paid off big. He captured the state
cross country title his sophomore
season and defended it successfully
through his senior vear.
"In high school, there was really
no competition," Murley said. "I
would start out most of my races
fast to intimidate everyone and end

up winning by about a minute or
two."
Things quickly changed for
Murley upon his arrival at Stan
ford. After denying the Ivy League
the privilege of his services, he
found himself half a continent
away from home and facing the

toughest competition in his life.
And that was just among his own
teammates.
Making the transition from 40-
mile weeks in high school to nearly
70 during his freshman year was
not easy to stomach. He also had a
bit of a point to prove, as his 4:20
1,600-meter and 9:24 3.2(X)-meter
personal bests ranked him lowest
in his recruiting class.
Murley redshirted his freshman
year to give himself time to im
prove and was soon after hit with a
series of injuries. First it was his ileo
tibial band. Then his left achilles
tendon. It was becoming a struggle
just to finish a season with all pis
tons firing.
Though he had some success on
the trails and on the track through
his sophomore and junior years,
Murley decided to take the time to
follow another one of his passions
— art history. Murlev's father is a
professor of humanities who focus
es on art history at a community
college.
So perhaps the most significant
decision Murley has made since his
arrival at Stanford was to travel to
Florence, an art historian's mecca.
for winter quarter last year. A rari
ty for athletes whose sports are
year-round, Murlev's trip was ad
mittedly a gamble.
"I had the urge to go abroad, de
spite the consequences," Murley
said. "It wasn't a good athletic deci
sion, but it was a good personal de
cision."
Murley had a hard time finding
time, energy and a place to train in
Florence. But his personal growth
during that period was invaluable.
And Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna protected his investment
by working closely with Murley to
form a training schedule.
"For the best coach in the na
tion, one who is totally focused on
American distance running, he
sure was patient with me," said
Murlev, who admits that he re

turned to Stanford in a bit poorer
shape than when he left.
Murley. who still has two sea
sons of athletic eligability remain
ing, has been training injury-free at
up to 1(H) miles per week since Flo
rence. Now he's ready to make an
impact on the national cross coun
try scene. After a somewhat disap
pointing 46th-place effort at last
year's NCAA championship
(where Stanford finished second),
Murley is ready to step up to an
other level.
Early signs say he is doing just
that. His second-place finish at Sat
urday's Stanford Invitational in
24:19 made him the lOth-fastest
collegian to ever run the Stanford
course, and fourth-fastest among
those who have worn the Cardinal
jersey.
Though Murley says that such
stats don't enter his mind — "the
nature of our team is the "ever un
satisfied distance runner,'" he says
their existence cannot be de
nied.
In fact, if things continue along
this route. Murley can expect to
have a homecoming of sorts at Nov.
22's NCAA championship meet in
Bloomington, lnd„ which is just a
two-hour roadtrip from his home.
"I'm looking forward to that."
says Murley. "I have a lot of family
in the area, so I should have quite a
fan club."
For now, the routes Murley has
chosen to pursue have forced many
of his life passions to take a back
seat for a while. He was a prolific
drawer until sketching time was
overtaken by running. The jazz
band here at Stanford in which he
drums has temporarily disbanded,
and he is just now finding time to
reconnect with his lost piano-plav
ing ability.
But for Murlev. these are wor
thy sacrifices.
"I'm devoting these next two
years to running," he says."I just
want to see how far I can go."

Taking time off to study abroad hasn't slowed Thomas Murley down.
The senior took second place at the Stanford Cross-Country Invita
tional last weekend with the 10th-fastest collegiate time on the
course in history.
