## Running into the spotlight 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
To read what's been written so
far of the life story of senior
Thomas Murlev would be less like
perusing your roommate's tran
script and more like devouring one
of those 'choose your own adven
ture" books. To race for the USA
junior Pan-Am team in Cuba, turn
to 1997. To take a detour to Flo
rence. Italy, to be immersed in art
history, try 1999.
Murlev's life has been marked
by a scries of these life-changing
events. The fact that thev've led

this backwoods Kentucky boy to
Stanford to compete at the top of
the collegiate running scene makes
the story tough to put down.
Raised in rural Eli/abethtown
(population 20.000). Murley began
his running career early under the
tutelage of his father, a road-racing
veteran. Even in elementary
school, the elder Murley would
train with Thomas, running up and
down the two-mile gravel lane that
led to their home. By the eighth
grade. Murley had placed 14th in
the high-school state cross country
meet.
Hut in ninth grade, the first

major decision came for Murley.
Would he stick with running or
play percussion in the marching
hand?
"I consider that decision to be a
crucial turning point in my life."
Murley said. "Music is my passion,
hut marching band was actually
very physical, so I had to make a
choice."
He stuck with running, and it
paid off big. He captured the state
cross country title his sophomore
season and defended it successfully
through his senior vear.
