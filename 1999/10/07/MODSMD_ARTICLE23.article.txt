						many hats of Henry Greely

Standing outside Law Prof.
Henry Greely's office door, one
may he unsure of what to expect of
the professor sitting inside.
A plaque on the wall outside his
door lists some of the many posi
tions Greely holds at Stanford: pro
fessor of Law; professor by cour
tesy of Genetics; co-Director, Pro

gram on Law. Science and Tech
nology; and co-Director, Program
in Genetics, Ethics and Society.
The titles arc imposing, hut their
effect is relaxed hy a colorful satire
poster ot the American Health
Care System and a Calvin and
Hohhes comic strip taped onto the
door.
Greely is known around campus
hv staff and faculty for his diverse

talents and 112 riendly demeanor, but
he is also known beyond the Stan
ford community. This past Mon
day, he was quoted in the Boston
Globe about ethical issues of ex
perimental health treatment.
A tall man with a warm smile
and curly hair, he sits at his desk at
the Crown Law School pulling dou
ble-duty: although he is a faculty
member of the Law Department,
much of his interests and time lie in
the biomedical ethics field.
Greely started his work on
health law 12 years ago, two years
after joining the Stanford Law fac
ulty. Finding bioethics a fascinating
field, he began studying genetic is
sues and is now a co-director of the
Stanford Program on Genomics,
Ethics and Society (PGES).
The PGES is a part of the Cen
ter of Biomedical Ethics, where
Greely is also the chair of the steer
ing committee. The center is com
prised of faculty from various de
partments who study issues such as
genetic engineering and health
care funding.
Greely works with many faculty
and staff members from different
department. His co-director at
PGES is Biomedical Ethics Center
Executive Director Barbara
Koenig, who is by trade a medical
anthropologist and an associate
professor in the Medical School.
Greely also works with Ernie
Young, who is a co-director at the
Biomedical Ethics Center.
"Working with Hank has been
one of the true pleasures of my po
sition as executive director," said
Koenig. "lie has been very sup
portive of bioethics at Stanford."
Greely enjoys his work in
bioethics and sees it as a good ex
cuse to "read scientific magazines
and not feel guilty because I am
doing work."
Most of his work is in genetics
and the ethical implications in the
law in cases in that area. Greelv
