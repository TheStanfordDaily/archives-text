# Collaborative campus effort improves access for disabled
## 
### Kristin Rose 
Thanks to a collaborative effort of
the Disability Resource Center and
the Americans with Disabilities Act
Barrier Removal Program, numer
ous improvements have been made
for disability access on campus in re
cent months.
Many of the changes were man
dated by the ADA Barrier Removal
Progam, including additional access
ramps, modified pathways and addi
tional disabled-serviceable re
strooms at major University centers
such as the Main Quad and Hoover
Tower.
Rosa Gonzalez, compliance offi
cer for the ADA. expressed satisfac
tion with the disability access im
provements around campus.
Gonzalez has received many positive
responses from disabled students
about the developments on campus,
and she believes that the improve

ment "makes access more direct and
integrated for disabled students."
She said she is especially excited
about the disabled-access elevators
that have been installed at the Bech
tel International Center.
The DRC has developed new dis
abled resources in assistive computer
technology. It has acquired a large
space in Area 260 at Meyer Library
for the Assistive Computer Technol
ogy Center.
Joan Bisagno, DRC' director, said
the ACTC "has all the new bells and
whistles," such as 12 top-of-the-line
Macintosh and PC computers, a new
closed-circuit television, a Braille
embosser and a projection system for
seminars.
The DRC will host an open house
in November to celebrate the open
ing of the new ACTC.
The DRC will continue to oversee
a golf-cart transportation service.
DisGoCart. that is open to any mem

her of the Stanford community with a
permanent or temporary mobility
impairment.
Sophomore Loren Hilburn. who
lives in Kimball Hall, has used the
DisGo Cart for the past two years.
He said he is happy with the ser
vice and that people on the road are
generally polite.
His only criticism, he said, is that
"bikers don't really know the rules of
the road. ... Swerving at the last
minute is not a good idea."
The DRC is located in the lower
level of Meyer library. The center de
scribes its mission as "to provide dis
abled students with access to all
facets of University life: education,
housing, recreation and extracurricu
lar activitites."
In order to gain access to services
a student must contact the DRC di
rectly and meet with a coordinator to
create a program to support his or her
needs.
