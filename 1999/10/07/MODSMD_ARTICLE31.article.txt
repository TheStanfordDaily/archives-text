## Filter – Title of Record 
### 
It's been a whole four years since the rock
band Filter released an album, but it doesn t
really feel that way. Filter, led by ex-Nine
Inch Nails guitarist Richard Patrick, went on
tour for two years in support of its debut, "Short
Bus," and kept in the scene by releasing singles
such as the collaborative effort with The Crystal
Method, "Can You Trip Like I Do?"
Now Filter is back in form with its new album.
"Title of Record," and Patrick and company are
headlining this fall's Family Values Tour (arriv
ing in San Francisco Oct. 19).
"Title of Record" moves with much of the
driving drum-and-metal-guitar sound that made
"Short Bus" go platinum. The opening rocker,
"Welcome to the Fold," has an excellent guitar
intro and features Patrick screaming his voice
out in regular fashion. In"The Best Things," you
can hear the band's use of synthesizers to com
plement the drums for an incredible sense of
speed.
On the other hand, Patrick has taken a new
direction with his songwriting by including a lot
of acoustic guitar. The latest single, "Take a Pic
ture," has some good lyrics about one of his air
plane trips and demonstrates his vocal range.
"Miss Blue," the final track, is almost like a '70s
folk song.
I have to say that I wish the metal material on
this album was a bit catchier. The most memo
rable songs here are the acoustic ones, which is
OK, but Filter is known for more hardcore stuff,
such as the radio single "Hey Man. Nice Shot."
"Title of Record" is a worthy sophomore ef
fort for Filter; it follows the successful formula of
"more of the same, yet different." Since there
was a big gap between records, it's questionable
whether this album will sell as well as "Short
Bus," but fans will recognize that the band is still
alive and kicking hard.
