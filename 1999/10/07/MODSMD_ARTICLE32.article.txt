# 311 – Soundsystem
## 
### 
Not worth it — that would be my three
word review of 31 l's fifth studio album,
"Soundsystem," which will be released
Oct. 12.
311 first came to prominence a few years back
with the übiquitous single "Down," drawn from
their third album, "311." It seemed promising, if
only because it sounded a bit different from the
grunge and punk pervading the airwaves at the
time. Sure, there's the Red Hot Chili Peppers' in
fluence, but 311 seemed to fuse their metal, rap,
funk and ska in a unique way, albeit a bit more
mechanically than the Peppers.
Since then, many bands have aped 31 l's style,
most notably 311 themselves. On their first single
from the new album, "Come Original" — a song
sounding suspiciously like 1995's "All Mixed Up"
— 311 declare," If you 're not origi nal, I guess you
will get shot." Apparently, the irony does not
seem to register.
It's not just that the album is unoriginal,
though. It's also a bit uninspired. Bassist P-Nut
claims, "This is an album we played in the studio
so much it became like a live album." However,
on my stereo, "Soundsystem" seems rigid and
overproduced, almost sterile and soulless — not a
desirable quality for a band so dependent on hip
hop and funk for its sound.
Mast of the songs seem to vary only in speed,
studio tricks and lyrics. The banal writing would
be more forgivable — as they were in early Van
Halen, for example — if the music were more in
spired. Whether the subject is generic braggado

cio ("Come Original," "Can't Fade Me," and
"Livin'& Rockin'") or stabs at social significance
("Evolution" and "Leaving Babylon"), it's only
toti apparent the members of 311 aren't master
wordsmiths. Music that rocks doesn't need to
make sense, but mediocre music and limp lyrics
are a lethal combination. •
Still, this album isn't quite a tepid affair (and if
that's not damning with faint praise, I don't know
what is). The catchy songs prove surprisingly re
silient to repeated listenings. "Come Original"
and "Eons" will stick in your head the way Devo's
version of "Satisfaction" does, with a similar de
sire to get them out.
Ironically, 311 seems most fresh when ripping
off other bands — such as Santana in "Life's Not
a Race" and the Beastie Boys in "Can't Fade
Me." Things also get a bit more varied toward the
end as 311 expands its bag of tricks. Thus,
"Soundsystem" starts to seem less like a retreat to
the style of their self-titled album and more like a
weak effort from a capable band.
ITie sad thing is that radio will probably adore
this album, mixing it in with fellow groove-recy
cling bands such as Sugar Ray. The promise of
combining hip-hop with metal was opened in the
'80s with soulful yet hard-hitting bands such as
Faith No More and Living Colour. Now, it's just
another fad which sells records but will soon be all
but forgotten. Until "Behind the Music: 311"
comes out in 2010, of course. For 1999, though,
"Soundsystem" is just not worth it.
