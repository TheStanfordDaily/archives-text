# Leftover Salmon – The Nashville Sessions
## 
### 
When a band says "you
can't label our music,"
I can't help but as
sume it's because no decent mu
sical category would have them.
So I approach Leftover Salmon,
who bill themselves as "Polyeth
nic Cajun Slamgrass," with some
suspicion.
It seems they applied to their
Musician's Union Local to be a
Country-Bluegrass Cover Band
(Second Class), only to be told
they should come back later
once they had developed some
thing beyond workmanlike in
strumental prowess. Leaving in a

huff, Leftover Salmon dreamt up
this flashy genre of their own and
spent the next several years re
lentlessly touring and trying to
impress stoners who miss the
Jerry Garcia and David Grisman
collaborations.
"The Nashville Sessions" is
Leftover Salmon's third studio
album, and the overall feeling is
one of blandness. There is no
doubt that they can play. In par
ticular, Drew Emmett's man
dolin playing is quite nice. How
ever, at best, it sounded like a
Phish cover band trying to play
Bill Monroe. At its worst mo

ments, I fell asleep.
Perhaps they are a more en
tertaining band live, and the pro
duction certainly is to blame for
much of the album's shortcom
ings. It is unremittingly slick and
polished, delivering an antiseptic
sound that's anathema to coun
try, folk and bluegrass music
(though perhaps it's required for
"Polyethnic Cajun Slamgrass").
The production, however, can't
take the blame for faceless, unin
spired songwriting and limp
arrangements.
Luckily they invited some
musical heavyweights to help

them out with "The Nashville
Sessions," and the highlights are
when Leftover Salmon plays
Karoke band for these genuine
talents. Taj Mahal shines on his
song, "Lovin' In My Baby's
Eyes," and they also back re
makes by Lucinda Williams and
Waylon Jennings with good re
sults.
In the end, though, you'll
probably wish you had bought
the original versions of these
songs. The fact that they cover
Nina Simone's classic "Nobody's
Fault But Mine" and then mis
spell her name in the liner notes

says a lot about this band's rela
tionship to their betters.
When Dwight Yoakam ar
rived in Nashville, he was told his
music was "too country for
Cashville." The great old talents
of country, such as Waylon Jen
nings, continue to produce vital
music but get no airplay as radio
stations only program the slick,
overproduced dreck that the
Nashville machine churns out.
Thus, the title tells more about
this album than just where it was
recorded.
