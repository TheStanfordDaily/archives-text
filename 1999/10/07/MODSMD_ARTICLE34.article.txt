## Oh doctor, doctor!

Initial disclaimer: Both my friend and I felt
like we were involved in a bizarre, yet high
ly interesting, sub-culture at the Bus Barn
Theatre. Nestled comfortably away from the
excesses of downtown Palo Alto, this theatre is
now entering its fifth season of production.
Most of the attendees appeared to know each
other like next-door neighbors; the stage is inti
mately set right in front of your seat. The nose
bleed seats simply don't exist at the Bus Barn.
Neil Simon's "The Good Doctor," which de
rives its name from one of Anton Chekhov's
short stories, has a number of components
working for it. Most no
'The Good Doctor' table is the proximity of
Bus Barn Theatre the stage to the viewer. I
97 Hillview Ave. could see the grainy ex-
Los Altos pressions on the eldest
Through Oct. 30, actors; I could similarly
Thu-Sun hear the dialogue
(650)941-0551 (whether correct or
flubbed) quite clearly,
which has often been a
problem with past theatrical productions.
Only five humans take the stage during the
entire production, so it is safe to assume that
they have to take on the persona of several
characters. Working well together are Bill Bad
ger and Murphy Larson as the oldest two of the
cast. They have an amusing and charming mu
sical number where they mimic a couple of

lonely old-timers who don't have the guts to
talk to each other. "Just not today," they kept
thinking.
The rest of the cast is comprised of Kurt
Kroesche, Tom Gough and Jillian Wetzel. A
Stanford graduate, Kroesche has the task of
playing the narrator, a chatty writer who dis
cusses a series of his short stories. At one point
he says, "People tend to shy away from writ
ers." As a movie critic, I get the same feeling
from a lot of my peers also.
Some scenes dragged as well. The first short
story, involving a ridiculous parks representa
tive with a penchant for sneezing, is the weak
est. Another sketch, about a man who almost
drowns in freezing water for rubles, is simply
not funny. It is in these scenes where the actors'
failed attempts at authentic Russian accents
stand out.
Overall, though, I admit that 1 did get at least
a good chuckle or two out of each short story.
Director Arturo Catricala (who was featured in
last week's Intermission article about the Bay
Area Playwrights' Festival) has assembled a
fine, talented cast in a rather haphazard play
structure. Some short stories work; others
don't. " The Good Doctor" is a decent evening
performance for those looking for a sophisti
cated change of pace.
