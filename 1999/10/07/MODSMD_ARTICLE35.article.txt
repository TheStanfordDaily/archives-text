# Funny Girlz just wanna have fun

Often bringing the sold-out audience to side-split
ting laughter, the innagural "Funny Girlz: A
Smorgasbord of Women's Humor" came and
went for a one-time event at the Herbst Theatre. Pro
ceeds partially benefited the Bay Area Women's and
Children's Center, thus providing another perk for those
who attended. Five comics, plus an emcee, highlighted
the two-hour performance with a range of backgrounds
and experiences from which they derived material.
Lisa Geduldig, a local Jewish
Tunny Girlz' lesbian comic, proved to be a wor-
Herbst 'ITieatre thy comedic host for the evening.
401 Van Ness Ave. She opened with a joke about how
San Francisco there were about 7(X) women and
Sat., Oct. 8 four men in the audience — pr0(415)
(415) 392-4400 viding a wink to the dozens of fe
male couples in the audience.
Geduldig also brought the audience to tears when she re
marked how Safeway honors the Jewish population by
providing a matzo ball section in the freezer food area.
The headlincr for the show was Elvira Kurt, whose re
sume includes a "Comedy Central" special and over 100
shows during the past two years. This openly lesbian
comedienne joked about how the people "who choose to
live at a place where walnuts fall by the creek" feared the
great mass of land to the west called San Francisco. She
also brought up an excellent point about the relative ease
and technological advances which mark the current In
formation Age. Kurt harkened back to the days when
toothbrushes didn't have blue indicator bristles, lawn
darts were the game to play and playground slides fea
tured high, vertical ladders and stingingly hot metal.
Perhaps drawing even more laughs than Kurt was
Diane Amos, better known as the Pine Sol Lady. That's
right, you remember her. But you probably didn't know

that she was raised by lesbian mothers, one African-
American and one Jewish. Amos threw poniards it
Kathie Lee Gifford's incessant talk about Cody. Lisa
Kudrow's knack for playing dumb blondes and the whole
Monica-Bill scandal. Perhaps most substantive was her
whole routine regarding the plethora of side effects found
in today's medications, like Zybane, Propecia and o\a
line. The audience openly laughed at her description ol
the side effects, and Amos returned with "I'm serious. I'm
not making these up."
Luenell, an Oakland native and host for the "Morning
Show" on Soul Beat TV, drew a fair number of laughs
when she appeared on stage with an elaborate yellow
and-black diva gown. She claimed that once she heard she
was performing in San Francisco, the so-called gay capi
tal, she knew she would have to put her clothing to good
use. An extended sequence talked about female mastui
bation, and she also alluded to the oft-mentioned carpal
tunnel syndrome.
Tessie Chua and Bridge Schwartz finished out the
fivesome with decent but inextraordinary comic sets
Chua, a self-described "petite Asian flower," comes from
a Chinese-Filipino-Irish background and demanded that
the straight members of the audience join her in a sone
mimicking the gay-rights chant. Schwartz, meanwhile,
bagged on smokers, anorexics, work birthday parties and
cell phones, then jogged off-stage in her sweats.
All in all, the Herbst Theatre, located across the street
from the Civic Center, provided an old yet ornate home
to a full night of comedy. The red curtains may have been
faded, and the pink stars on the stage screen may have
been tacky, but the five performers and the emcee
brought much needed stress relief to all in attendance.
