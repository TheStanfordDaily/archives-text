# Don Giovanni
## 
### 
It may not be the first time our own Memorial Auditorium is home to debauchery,
hedonism and seduction, all occurring in song. However, this isn't a complicated
"Gaieties" preview. Instead, Mozart's satirical comedic opera "Don Giovanni" and
the behavior of its lecherous anti-hero will be arriving on October 9.
The Stanford community will have the opportunity to enjoy the first fully staged opera
that the Lively Arts has included in its programming during its 30-year existence. The per
formance, which will be sung in Italian with English supertitles, is brought to our home
territory by Western Opera Theater, the national touring company of the San Francisco
Opera.
One of the darkest examples of the 18th century comic opera, known as opera buffa,
"Don Giovanni" is unique for its successful integration of lyrical music, black comedy and
compelling drama. When Mozart and his librettist Da Ponte selected the well known

"Don Juan" story to convert to an opera, they broke new ground by
substituting the stylistic and two-dimensional characters of the opera
buffa genre with much more complex, human individuals.
Like many Mozart operas, the show has been a repertoire staple of
opera houses for years because of its balance of sung dialogue ("recita
tive"), during which most of the dramatic action occurs, and arias, dur
ing which the characters reflect on their emotions. Such a balance
makes this musically accessible show an excellent choice for those who
have never been to an opera, but would like to see what all the fuss is
about.
Stanford is just one destination out of many on a national tour that
began in Idaho last month and concludes in Florida in November, hit
ting 31 cities and 15 states in between. The cast, predominantly fellows
in San Francisco Opera's prestigious Merola training program, faces a
demanding schedule. The itinerary requires that they and the crew be
on the road in the morning, assemble the set in the afternoon and ex
ecute the show in the evening.
The undertaking, according to Robert Cable, spokesperson for

Western Opera Theater, is enor
mous. It requires the coordina
tion of motorcoaches, plane
reservartions and hotel reserva
tions, as well as transportation of
the scenery and cast, in places that
"may never have had an opera in
town before."
The Western Opera Theater is
the last remaining touring compa
ny in the United States among the
major opera houses, combining
two unusual services. The tour
brings productions to small towns
across the country that rarely re-

ceive operas (Palo Alto not included), in addition to offering the singers valuable expo
sure to the intensity of a touring production. Although none of their names are as recog
nizable as some of the stars that frequently head billings at the San Francisco Opera, the
Merollini, as they are known, are an elite group of young singers.
Chosen among an internationally competitive pool, their participation in "Don Gio
vanni" is a climactic finish to an intense summer of rehearsals, concerts and coachings.
The program, the oldest of its kind in the country, is considered a "stepping stone," in
Cable's words. When asked about the potential of the singers after they have completed
the program, he noted that "(agents and directors] recognize the prestige of the Merola
program and it opens doors for them."
"Don Giovanni" condenses three attempted seductions by that famous womanizer
and his subsequent downfall. Cable noted that the show has been given a very traditional

staging. However, the director, Jose Maria Condemi, has injected the performance with
"a little more action, a little more sex and a little more violence" than the text requires.
After all, within the first 15 minutes alone, there is a botched tryst, a murder and a vow
of revenge. After the Don successfully eludes the wrath of his latest pursuit, Donna Anna,
and her father and lover, he is approached by a devoted lover he abandoned, Donna Elvi
ra, who remains obsessed with him. Escaping once more, he and his disapproving but
faithful servant, Leporello, descend upon a country wedding where ... well, you'll just
have to come find out for yourself.
The opera, stresses Cable, "is still a comedy" where no character is entirely virtuous.
Donna Elvira, for instance, "is someone you would see on a talk show who keeps follow
ing her boyfriend after he abuses her." No one could ever mistake this piece for Maury
Povich, however. The music, says Cable, "makes the characters three-dimensional."

Consider Elvira's aria "Mi Treadi" in the second act. During the aria,
she sings about how Don Giovanni has betrayed her, but she still asks God
to forgive him because she's still in love with him. It's a show-piece, but it's
also quite beautiful. Mozart is certainly not above lightening the darker se
duction scenes with some comedic relief. At one point, a character hears a
melody from another Mozart opera and responds with, "Not that again!"
Although this particular production will satisfy the die-hards among us.

it will also provide an exciting introduction to those unfamiliar with the
show. With Memorial Auditorium as the venue, "Don Giovanni" will he much more con
venient and less expensive than attending the San Francisco Opera. The story is still
thought-provoking in a modern age. Is Don Giovanni strictly a villain for his misogyny
and self-gratification? Or is he a heroic rebel standing up for sensuality amidst the puri
tanism of his aristocratic world?
The presence of supertitles enables the audience to follow the dialogue without un
derstanding the Italian although Cable recommends that new listeners read the synopsis
first so they can keep their eyes on the action. Most exciting of all is the prospect of seeing
the opera stars of tomorrow. After all, as Cable points out, you can always tell people, "I
saw so-and-so before they became famous."

The opera, stresses Cable, "is still a comedy" where no character is entirely virtuous.
Donna Elvira, for instance, "is someone you would see on a talk show who keeps follow
ing her boyfriend after he abuses her." No one could ever mistake this piece for Maury
Povich, however. The music, says Cable, "makes the characters three-dimensional."

Consider Elvira's aria "Mi Treadi" in the second act. During the aria,
she sings about how Don Giovanni has betrayed her, but she still asks God
to forgive him because she's still in love with him. It's a show-piece, but it's
also quite beautiful. Mozart is certainly not above lightening the darker se
duction scenes with some comedic relief. At one point, a character hears a
melody from another Mozart opera and responds with, "Not that again!"
Although this particular production will satisfy the die-hards among us.

it will also provide an exciting introduction to those unfamiliar with the
show. With Memorial Auditorium as the venue, "Don Giovanni" will he much more con
venient and less expensive than attending the San Francisco Opera. The story is still
thought-provoking in a modern age. Is Don Giovanni strictly a villain for his misogyny
and self-gratification? Or is he a heroic rebel standing up for sensuality amidst the puri
tanism of his aristocratic world?
The presence of supertitles enables the audience to follow the dialogue without un
derstanding the Italian although Cable recommends that new listeners read the synopsis
first so they can keep their eyes on the action. Most exciting of all is the prospect of seeing
the opera stars of tomorrow. After all, as Cable points out, you can always tell people, "I
saw so-and-so before they became famous."
