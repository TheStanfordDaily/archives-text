# LYSISTRATA: IT'S ALL ABOUT SEX!
## 
### 
The press release for the City Lights
Theater Company's production of
Aristophanes' "Lysistrata" claims
that the ancient Greek play "could have as
much impact today." That much is true:
Aristophanes' comedy, in which the
women end a war by withholding sex from
their husbands, explores gender roles, poli
tics and the nature of sex.
The plot seems particularly relevant in a
"post-feminist" society, where girl-power
has been co-opted by the Spice Girls and
women are continually confused about
where and when to use their sexual power.
Unfortunately, this production chooses to
ignore the possibility of having impact and
instead adds a telling exclamation to the
title: "It's all about sex!"
This is "Lysistrata" for seventh-graders

mers — there is
plenty of sexual in
nuendo and dou
ble entendre, but
not much else.
While Aristo
phanes' work does

contain these elements, they are meant to
make you giggle and think, not just giggle.
But this production is determined to play
up the sex jokes and play down the prob
lematic question at hand: are the women's
actions insulting or empowering?
The most thought-provoking scene in
volves a Spartan soldier (played by a
woman) snacking on his erect penis, which
is a baguette. But I couldn't figure out if that
was supposed to be symbolic or just silly.

That's another problem with the play: it
can't decide whether to be slapstick. The ac
tors are competent but not particularly in
spired, and thus much of the comedy falls,
well, limp.
Donald Sutherland's (not the famous
movie actor) translation is written mostly in
rhyming couplets, which gives the work a
sing-song Greek chorus quality (my friend
and I were reminded of the Beastie Boys'
immortal rhyme, "If you try to knock me,
you'll get rocked / I'll stir-fry you in my
wok"). But the actors' delivery is generally
flat, and their enunciation only becomes
clear when there's a sex joke on their lips.
The Spartan women wear leather and
chains, and the entire cast wears Birken
stocks or Tevas, but that's as far as director
Anne Marie Hunter's modernizing force
goes. She seems hesitant to make any kind

of statement about the play's relevance to a
modern — or even an ancient — audience.
Instead, she seems stuck on the fact that an
ancient Greek wrote such a bawdy play.
The M'l*V- and Grammy-nominated chore
ographer has stage direction that tends to
ward spoof but doesn't assert itself as such;
her hesitance doesn't help the actors' waf
fling comedic skills.
City Lights' production isn't particularly
bad — it's just pointless. "Lysistrata"
should have as much impact today. Save
yourself 15 dollars, go to the library and
check out Aristophanes' play. It will make
you think about the role of women's sexual
ity in society. And it's quite funny.
