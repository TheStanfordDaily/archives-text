## David O. Russell moves into the spotlight with 'Three Kings' 
### Lauren Russell Contributing writer 
Intermission had the opportunity to talk with David O.
Russell, whose two previous films were "Spanking the
Monkey" and "Flirting with Disaster. " Here, he talks about
his recently released — and highly acclaimed — war film,
"Three Kings."
Intermission: Many people did not take the Gulf War very
seriously. Why did you decide to film a Gulf War movie
specifically, especially during a time where there have
been a lot of otherfilms made about more serious wars?
David (). Russell: When I started, I didn't know that any
one else was making a war movie. Then I found out that
Steven Spielberg and Terence Malick were doing it, and I
didn't care. I thought, "That's territory we've been over a
million times," even if they do it brilliantly. Nobody's
doing this. The [Gulf] War was six months or so. That
wasn't that interesting to me. What was interesting was the
moment everybody stopped paying attention. And that
was very fertile for making a movie. They broke out the
yellow ribbons. They were drinking liquor out of mouth
wash bottles, because no liquor was allowed in Saudi Ara
bia. Meanwhile, these guys are partying, and 60 miles
away there's a democratic uprising. Which to me, was a
mind-blowing opportunity for a movie that felt like
"M*A*S*H" in some parts, and really powerful drama in
other parts. Because you start out with the "M*A*S*H"
partying, they go for ajoyride, and now they're in the mid
dle of something more serious. It naturally goes that way.
I: How did you end up casting Mark Wahlberg, George
Clooney, Spike Jonze and Ice Cube?
DR: The parts were written that way. George Clooney
had a passion for the part, and he was trying to put some

of his weaker pictures behind him. I was happy to work
with him because he had done strong work in "Out of
Sight." Same thing with Mark in "Boogie Nights." He has
a quality of being a regular guy who won't take any shit
and yet also seems very sweet. He's also very serious as an
actor, which I didn't understand, and I think more people
will increasingly understand. His aspirations are equal to
Robert DeNiro's. He's friends with DeNiro. Spike is more
of a friend of mine, and had my ear more. Cube and I
didn't know each other as well. Having Spike around
helped me to aspire to try harder and be more original. I
like that Spike's a first-time actor. It brings a good energy
to the set. It gets everybody on their toes. There's some
body there who's new to it. It throws everybody off a little
bit. Cube was the first person I cast. I wanted either him or
Charlie Hayes, who played third base for the '96 World
Series Yankees. He now plays for the Giants. I liked his
energy. He's very focused, quiet, solid, intense, no-non
sense. Cube had that in spades. And that's how I cast him.
I loved him in "Boyz 'N' the Hood." I thought he really
hadn't had an opportunity since then to do some serious
acting, which he wants to do, which is why there are no
songs of his here.
I: What led you to write the screenplay?
DR: After I made "Flirting With Disaster," they opened
their log to me — the log of all their properties — and I
saw one line that said, "Heist set in the Gulf War." I was
researching this turn-of-the-century mystery for myself at
the time. And I couldn't stop thinking about this one
thing. I got this "L.A. Times" book that was day-by-day of
the war, and I saw Bart Simpson as well as hundreds of sol
diers being stripped in the desert — this bizarre ritual of
taking prisoners. I thought it was so funny and odd. I saw
green Cadillacs — things that were taken from Kuwait.
And I thought, "1 could go nuts in this environment." And
nobody's done it. And the more I researched it, I thought,

"There's a story here that hadn't been told." I went down
that road, and I never read John Ridley's script, because 1
didn't want to pollute my own idea. I'm told that it's a
more straight-ahead action picture. John gets credit where
it's due. The germ of the idea that I took was his.
1: Have you ever wanted to direct a screenplay you haven't
written?
[)R: I fantasize about that because it sure would be a lot
easier. I see a bunch of screenplays that get sent to me
Warren Beatty said to me that it's as hard to read a screen
play as it is to write one. And I agree with that. I was sent
"Good Will Hunting," and I didn't get it. I was sent "Fight
Club,"and I didn't get it. Warren Beatty told me that
Robert Towne read the script for "Reds" and didn't get it.
Told him it was a catastrophe. I would love for one to
come through that I love, but that hasn't happened yet.
I: It seemed like you had done a lot of research into the
cultures of Kuwait and Iraq. I liked that you stayed away
from the typical Cowboys-and-Indians stereotyping of
the different cultures.
DR: We had three Arab advisors, because you want to get
the language, the religion and the graffiti right. There were
two guys in our cast who personally defaced like 300 mu
rals of Saddam. And those murals are for real. Those are
taken from real pictures. They make him as everything
a doctor, with children, everything.
I: How did you get Marky Mark, George Clooney and Ice
Cube to play such realistic military characters '
DR: We had three military advisors. One was a Sergeant-
Major Special Forces guy, who had died during produc
tion, perhaps due to chemicals he was exposed to in the
Gulf. Really good guy. Fie was in Vietnam. Tried to steal
a six-ton gold Buddha from a temple. Amazing guy. He
and George really hit it off. The other guy was a trained

Navy Seal — also a Gulf veteran. And a Colonel who was
the sherrif of Sierra Madre, Calif., who was the Sergeant-
Major's commanding officer. His name was King Davis.
We had to hire him because his name was King. They
took the guys shooting a bunch of times, they gave them
the lingo. Then they had a four-day mission. We built our
sets, and they did an assault on the town. But they didn't
sleep out there or anything. They slept in the Holiday Inn.
I: What type offilm did you use to get that fuzzy, docu
mentary look in some scenes?
I)R: I kind of like that digital look. Maybe I'll do the next
movie on digital, because I spent a lot of money making it
look like it's digital. If you look at the color xeroxes from
the "L.A. Times" or "USA Today," [the Gulf War] is the
first war to really have color pictures in newspapers. The
photos have this color Xerox quality to them, which is
very contrasty and kinda blown out, since the colors real
ly pop. So that was what we saw for the look, because I
think it's a really beautiful look. And it also seemed to be
the look of that war.
I: Why did you use that Chicago song in the most dis
turbing scene?
I)R: Chicago cracks me up; every time that comes on, I
start laughing. We had "The Look of Love" in there by
Dusty Springfield, which I adore, but I felt like Austin
Powers had kind of Burt Bacharached us a little, and it
was a tough choice. The intention is that he is very ner
vous, and you see him talking to George and plays it to
calm him down.
I: You did a lot with bullets and sound in the film. And
your gut cam — can you explain where that idea came
from?
DR:The whole approach that I took to the bullets in the
movie was to try to make a bullet alive to an audience who
is benumbed to bullets. So, number one, that means fewer
bullets. I write at a friend's house sometimes, because it's
less lonely, and the friend is an emergency room doctor. 1
was asking him, what does the bullet actually do? He de
scribed it to me. And I asked what's the weirdest wound?
You can get a wound that doesn't kill you. The bullet goes
through your lung and you can walk around. But the air is
leaking out of your lung everytime you breathe. So your
own breathing can kill you, because your own breathing
will crush your organs. It'll turn into a balloon in there.
And they have to puncture it to let it out. And I thought,
"That's never been in a movie." We had this minimal
sound design that I loved. We had this very spare, dense
and quiet sound. And I came back from working with the
composer, and the sound mixers did their professional
Hollywood job, which was to Bruce Willis-ize it. So the
shootouts suddenly became KABLAM — huge bullet!
And I said, "No! Gotta change it." It completely changes
the scene. I wanted "pop, pop," not "BOOM!"
I: / loved the way that the action sequences are punctuat
ed with sound And the way you do explosions, with a
tight shot on your character instead of a bunch of differ
ent angles and the background filling up with explosions.
DR: The whole M.O. here is simpler is better. One shot.
To me, that's more real. The car's blowing up on this guy,
and we just park the camera. Of course the producer says,
"We gotta run three camreras!" But if I cut three ways,
then it just looks like another action picture. Your brain
has referenced that as a cartoon already in your head. It's
like with the bullets. If I want to make you awake to it in
a different way, I've gotta cover it a different way.
I: So that was something you decided to do long before
the editing room.
DR: My whole word is that I don't want to have action just
because it's an action movie. I don't want to have action
that suddenly feels like we went into an action movie. I
want it to feel like the fabric of the rest of the movie.
I: There seem to be many different layers of fabric, too.
DR: A movie like this is very rich for me. It has many dif
ferent faces to it. If you take a trailer from the first part of

the movie, it seems more like a party. You could make a
trailer from the first part of the movie, and it would look
like a comedy. You could make a trailer from the middle
part of the movie, and it would seem like an action movie.
So there's a lot in the movie, like when they burst through
the door of that second bunker. That was the intention —
to get all those layers of experience. BOOM. Eddie Mur
phy's playing. Rodney King's on TV. There's a guy on a
Nordic Track. There's a guy offering George Clooney a
Cuisinart. The other guy's trying to offer a CD player to
Mark. Open this door — there's a guy getting tortured in
here! When you shoot that, that's a half a page on the
script. The producer says, "OK, we can shoot this by
lunch." You get on the set, and that is a lot of material to
photograph. And a lot of actors to direct. Right away,
"This is going to take us all day. Maybe two days." Pro
ducer goes, "Varoom half of it. What's the purpose of the
scene? They're walking through the room to get down
stairs to the gold!" And I said, "No, this is the movie."
I: Do you think you'll make a sequel to "Three Kings?"
DR: I don't think so. If somebody wanted to make a funny
TV series, if somebody really smart wanted to do it, I think
I might work with him.
I: This is a guy's war movie. Do you think women will

like this film, besides (he sex appeal of the three stars?
DR: When we previewed the movie, the biggest shock
was that the highest scores came from the women. And I
think that's because the movie has a lot of heart in it. It
comes from the heart. Now how do you convey that to
people? I also think (the success of the film] is going to be
very review-driven. And word-of-mouth-driven. Some of
the best movies that don't fit in the mold depend on the
people who have seen them.
I: What kind of a message are you trying to get across with
the film — / know it was a comedy, but there is also a se
rious message coming across with the uprising against
Saddam.
DR: I see it as something that starts out kind of as a
"M*A*S*H" satirical comedy, because you are celebrat
ing. The war is over. And then it's that weird gray area
where you don't know to shoot or not shoot [the enemy].
Which I also think is a satirical juxtaposition. I am trying
to talk about the fact that everyone stopped paying atten
tion when the war was over. How did the troops actually
feel? Did they feel resolve? That was interesting to me.
What happened after they left?
It has to become a very human fable for me. In the end,
there's a face. It's not a computer grid of a bomber. It's
about some guys, who hate Saddam as much as we do.

Robert Towne read the script for "Reds" and didn't get it.
Told him it was a catastrophe. I would love for one to
come through that I love, but that hasn't happened yet.
I: It seemed like you had done a lot of research into the
cultures of Kuwait and Iraq. I liked that you stayed away
from the typical Cowboys-and-Indians stereotyping of
the different cultures.
DR: We had three Arab advisors, because you want to get
the language, the religion and the graffiti right. There were
two guys in our cast who personally defaced like 300 mu
rals of Saddam. And those murals are for real. Those are
taken from real pictures. They make him as everything
a doctor, with children, everything.
I: How did you get Marky Mark, George Clooney and Ice
Cube to play such realistic military characters '
DR: We had three military advisors. One was a Sergeant-
Major Special Forces guy, who had died during produc
tion, perhaps due to chemicals he was exposed to in the
Gulf. Really good guy. Fie was in Vietnam. Tried to steal
a six-ton gold Buddha from a temple. Amazing guy. He
and George really hit it off. The other guy was a trained

Navy Seal — also a Gulf veteran. And a Colonel who was
the sherrif of Sierra Madre, Calif., who was the Sergeant-
Major's commanding officer. His name was King Davis.
We had to hire him because his name was King. They
took the guys shooting a bunch of times, they gave them
the lingo. Then they had a four-day mission. We built our
sets, and they did an assault on the town. But they didn't
sleep out there or anything. They slept in the Holiday Inn.
I: What type offilm did you use to get that fuzzy, docu
mentary look in some scenes?
I)R: I kind of like that digital look. Maybe I'll do the next
movie on digital, because I spent a lot of money making it
look like it's digital. If you look at the color xeroxes from
the "L.A. Times" or "USA Today," [the Gulf War] is the
first war to really have color pictures in newspapers. The
photos have this color Xerox quality to them, which is
very contrasty and kinda blown out, since the colors real
ly pop. So that was what we saw for the look, because I
think it's a really beautiful look. And it also seemed to be
the look of that war.
I: Why did you use that Chicago song in the most dis
turbing scene?
I)R: Chicago cracks me up; every time that comes on, I
start laughing. We had "The Look of Love" in there by
Dusty Springfield, which I adore, but I felt like Austin
Powers had kind of Burt Bacharached us a little, and it
was a tough choice. The intention is that he is very ner
vous, and you see him talking to George and plays it to
calm him down.
I: You did a lot with bullets and sound in the film. And
your gut cam — can you explain where that idea came
from?
DR:The whole approach that I took to the bullets in the
movie was to try to make a bullet alive to an audience who
is benumbed to bullets. So, number one, that means fewer
bullets. I write at a friend's house sometimes, because it's
less lonely, and the friend is an emergency room doctor. 1
was asking him, what does the bullet actually do? He de
scribed it to me. And I asked what's the weirdest wound?
You can get a wound that doesn't kill you. The bullet goes
through your lung and you can walk around. But the air is
leaking out of your lung everytime you breathe. So your
own breathing can kill you, because your own breathing
will crush your organs. It'll turn into a balloon in there.
And they have to puncture it to let it out. And I thought,
"That's never been in a movie." We had this minimal
sound design that I loved. We had this very spare, dense
and quiet sound. And I came back from working with the
composer, and the sound mixers did their professional
Hollywood job, which was to Bruce Willis-ize it. So the
shootouts suddenly became KABLAM — huge bullet!
And I said, "No! Gotta change it." It completely changes
the scene. I wanted "pop, pop," not "BOOM!"
I: / loved the way that the action sequences are punctuat
ed with sound And the way you do explosions, with a
tight shot on your character instead of a bunch of differ
ent angles and the background filling up with explosions.
DR: The whole M.O. here is simpler is better. One shot.
To me, that's more real. The car's blowing up on this guy,
and we just park the camera. Of course the producer says,
"We gotta run three camreras!" But if I cut three ways,
then it just looks like another action picture. Your brain
has referenced that as a cartoon already in your head. It's
like with the bullets. If I want to make you awake to it in
a different way, I've gotta cover it a different way.
I: So that was something you decided to do long before
the editing room.
DR: My whole word is that I don't want to have action just
because it's an action movie. I don't want to have action
that suddenly feels like we went into an action movie. I
want it to feel like the fabric of the rest of the movie.
I: There seem to be many different layers of fabric, too.
DR: A movie like this is very rich for me. It has many dif
ferent faces to it. If you take a trailer from the first part of

the movie, it seems more like a party. You could make a
trailer from the first part of the movie, and it would look
like a comedy. You could make a trailer from the middle
part of the movie, and it would seem like an action movie.
So there's a lot in the movie, like when they burst through
the door of that second bunker. That was the intention —
to get all those layers of experience. BOOM. Eddie Mur
phy's playing. Rodney King's on TV. There's a guy on a
Nordic Track. There's a guy offering George Clooney a
Cuisinart. The other guy's trying to offer a CD player to
Mark. Open this door — there's a guy getting tortured in
here! When you shoot that, that's a half a page on the
script. The producer says, "OK, we can shoot this by
lunch." You get on the set, and that is a lot of material to
photograph. And a lot of actors to direct. Right away,
"This is going to take us all day. Maybe two days." Pro
ducer goes, "Varoom half of it. What's the purpose of the
scene? They're walking through the room to get down
stairs to the gold!" And I said, "No, this is the movie."
I: Do you think you'll make a sequel to "Three Kings?"
DR: I don't think so. If somebody wanted to make a funny
TV series, if somebody really smart wanted to do it, I think
I might work with him.
I: This is a guy's war movie. Do you think women will

like this film, besides (he sex appeal of the three stars?
DR: When we previewed the movie, the biggest shock
was that the highest scores came from the women. And I
think that's because the movie has a lot of heart in it. It
comes from the heart. Now how do you convey that to
people? I also think (the success of the film] is going to be
very review-driven. And word-of-mouth-driven. Some of
the best movies that don't fit in the mold depend on the
people who have seen them.
I: What kind of a message are you trying to get across with
the film — / know it was a comedy, but there is also a se
rious message coming across with the uprising against
Saddam.
DR: I see it as something that starts out kind of as a
"M*A*S*H" satirical comedy, because you are celebrat
ing. The war is over. And then it's that weird gray area
where you don't know to shoot or not shoot [the enemy].
Which I also think is a satirical juxtaposition. I am trying
to talk about the fact that everyone stopped paying atten
tion when the war was over. How did the troops actually
feel? Did they feel resolve? That was interesting to me.
What happened after they left?
It has to become a very human fable for me. In the end,
there's a face. It's not a computer grid of a bomber. It's
about some guys, who hate Saddam as much as we do.
Intermission had the opportunity to talk with David O.
Russell, whose two previous films were "Spanking the
Monkey" and "Flirting with Disaster. " Here, he talks about
his recently released — and highly acclaimed — war film,
"Three Kings."
Intermission: Many people did not take the Gulf War very
seriously. Why did you decide to film a Gulf War movie
specifically, especially during a time where there have
been a lot of otherfilms made about more serious wars?
David (). Russell: When I started, I didn't know that any
one else was making a war movie. Then I found out that
Steven Spielberg and Terence Malick were doing it, and I
didn't care. I thought, "That's territory we've been over a
million times," even if they do it brilliantly. Nobody's
doing this. The [Gulf] War was six months or so. That
wasn't that interesting to me. What was interesting was the
moment everybody stopped paying attention. And that
was very fertile for making a movie. They broke out the
yellow ribbons. They were drinking liquor out of mouth
wash bottles, because no liquor was allowed in Saudi Ara
bia. Meanwhile, these guys are partying, and 60 miles
away there's a democratic uprising. Which to me, was a
mind-blowing opportunity for a movie that felt like
"M*A*S*H" in some parts, and really powerful drama in
other parts. Because you start out with the "M*A*S*H"
partying, they go for ajoyride, and now they're in the mid
dle of something more serious. It naturally goes that way.
I: How did you end up casting Mark Wahlberg, George
Clooney, Spike Jonze and Ice Cube?
DR: The parts were written that way. George Clooney
had a passion for the part, and he was trying to put some

of his weaker pictures behind him. I was happy to work
with him because he had done strong work in "Out of
Sight." Same thing with Mark in "Boogie Nights." He has
a quality of being a regular guy who won't take any shit
and yet also seems very sweet. He's also very serious as an
actor, which I didn't understand, and I think more people
will increasingly understand. His aspirations are equal to
Robert DeNiro's. He's friends with DeNiro. Spike is more
of a friend of mine, and had my ear more. Cube and I
didn't know each other as well. Having Spike around
helped me to aspire to try harder and be more original. I
like that Spike's a first-time actor. It brings a good energy
to the set. It gets everybody on their toes. There's some
body there who's new to it. It throws everybody off a little
bit. Cube was the first person I cast. I wanted either him or
Charlie Hayes, who played third base for the '96 World
Series Yankees. He now plays for the Giants. I liked his
energy. He's very focused, quiet, solid, intense, no-non
sense. Cube had that in spades. And that's how I cast him.
I loved him in "Boyz 'N' the Hood." I thought he really
hadn't had an opportunity since then to do some serious
acting, which he wants to do, which is why there are no
songs of his here.
I: What led you to write the screenplay?
DR: After I made "Flirting With Disaster," they opened
their log to me — the log of all their properties — and I
saw one line that said, "Heist set in the Gulf War." I was
researching this turn-of-the-century mystery for myself at
the time. And I couldn't stop thinking about this one
thing. I got this "L.A. Times" book that was day-by-day of
the war, and I saw Bart Simpson as well as hundreds of sol
diers being stripped in the desert — this bizarre ritual of
taking prisoners. I thought it was so funny and odd. I saw
green Cadillacs — things that were taken from Kuwait.
And I thought, "1 could go nuts in this environment." And
nobody's done it. And the more I researched it, I thought,

Intermission

"There's a story here that hadn't been told." I went down
that road, and I never read John Ridley's script, because 1
didn't want to pollute my own idea. I'm told that it's a
more straight-ahead action picture. John gets credit where
it's due. The germ of the idea that I took was his.
1: Have you ever wanted to direct a screenplay you haven't
written?
[)R: I fantasize about that because it sure would be a lot
easier. I see a bunch of screenplays that get sent to me
Warren Beatty said to me that it's as hard to read a screen
play as it is to write one. And I agree with that. I was sent
"Good Will Hunting," and I didn't get it. I was sent "Fight
Club,"and I didn't get it. Warren Beatty told me that
Robert Towne read the script for "Reds" and didn't get it.

I: So that was something you decided to do long before
the editing room.
DR: My whole word is that I don't want to have action just
because it's an action movie. I don't want to have action
that suddenly feels like we went into an action movie. I
want it to feel like the fabric of the rest of the movie.
I: There seem to be many different layers of fabric, too.
DR: A movie like this is very rich for me. It has many dif
ferent faces to it. If you take a trailer from the first part of

the movie, it seems more like a party. You could make a
trailer from the first part of the movie, and it would look
like a comedy. You could make a trailer from the middle
part of the movie, and it would seem like an action movie.
So there's a lot in the movie, like when they burst through
the door of that second bunker. That was the intention —
to get all those layers of experience. BOOM. Eddie Mur
phy's playing. Rodney King's on TV. There's a guy on a
Nordic Track. There's a guy offering George Clooney a
Cuisinart. The other guy's trying to offer a CD player to
Mark. Open this door — there's a guy getting tortured in
here! When you shoot that, that's a half a page on the
script. The producer says, "OK, we can shoot this by
lunch." You get on the set, and that is a lot of material to
photograph. And a lot of actors to direct. Right away,
"This is going to take us all day. Maybe two days." Pro
ducer goes, "Varoom half of it. What's the purpose of the
scene? They're walking through the room to get down
stairs to the gold!" And I said, "No, this is the movie."
I: Do you think you'll make a sequel to "Three Kings?"
DR: I don't think so. If somebody wanted to make a funny
TV series, if somebody really smart wanted to do it, I think
I might work with him.
I: This is a guy's war movie. Do you think women will

like this film, besides (he sex appeal of the three stars?
DR: When we previewed the movie, the biggest shock
was that the highest scores came from the women. And I
think that's because the movie has a lot of heart in it. It
comes from the heart. Now how do you convey that to
people? I also think (the success of the film] is going to be
very review-driven. And word-of-mouth-driven. Some of
the best movies that don't fit in the mold depend on the
people who have seen them.
I: What kind of a message are you trying to get across with
the film — / know it was a comedy, but there is also a se
rious message coming across with the uprising against
Saddam.
DR: I see it as something that starts out kind of as a
"M*A*S*H" satirical comedy, because you are celebrat
ing. The war is over. And then it's that weird gray area
where you don't know to shoot or not shoot [the enemy].
Which I also think is a satirical juxtaposition. I am trying
to talk about the fact that everyone stopped paying atten
tion when the war was over. How did the troops actually
feel? Did they feel resolve? That was interesting to me.
What happened after they left?
It has to become a very human fable for me. In the end,
there's a face. It's not a computer grid of a bomber. It's
about some guys, who hate Saddam as much as we do.
Intermission had the opportunity to talk with David O.
Russell, whose two previous films were "Spanking the
Monkey" and "Flirting with Disaster. " Here, he talks about
his recently released — and highly acclaimed — war film,
"Three Kings."
Intermission: Many people did not take the Gulf War very
seriously. Why did you decide to film a Gulf War movie
specifically, especially during a time where there have
been a lot of otherfilms made about more serious wars?
David (). Russell: When I started, I didn't know that any
one else was making a war movie. Then I found out that
Steven Spielberg and Terence Malick were doing it, and I
didn't care. I thought, "That's territory we've been over a
million times," even if they do it brilliantly. Nobody's
doing this. The [Gulf] War was six months or so. That
wasn't that interesting to me. What was interesting was the
moment everybody stopped paying attention. And that
was very fertile for making a movie. They broke out the
yellow ribbons. They were drinking liquor out of mouth
wash bottles, because no liquor was allowed in Saudi Ara
bia. Meanwhile, these guys are partying, and 60 miles
away there's a democratic uprising. Which to me, was a
mind-blowing opportunity for a movie that felt like
"M*A*S*H" in some parts, and really powerful drama in
other parts. Because you start out with the "M*A*S*H"
partying, they go for ajoyride, and now they're in the mid
dle of something more serious. It naturally goes that way.
I: How did you end up casting Mark Wahlberg, George
Clooney, Spike Jonze and Ice Cube?
DR: The parts were written that way. George Clooney
had a passion for the part, and he was trying to put some

of his weaker pictures behind him. I was happy to work
with him because he had done strong work in "Out of
Sight." Same thing with Mark in "Boogie Nights." He has
a quality of being a regular guy who won't take any shit
and yet also seems very sweet. He's also very serious as an
actor, which I didn't understand, and I think more people
will increasingly understand. His aspirations are equal to
Robert DeNiro's. He's friends with DeNiro. Spike is more
of a friend of mine, and had my ear more. Cube and I
didn't know each other as well. Having Spike around
helped me to aspire to try harder and be more original. I
like that Spike's a first-time actor. It brings a good energy
to the set. It gets everybody on their toes. There's some
body there who's new to it. It throws everybody off a little
bit. Cube was the first person I cast. I wanted either him or
Charlie Hayes, who played third base for the '96 World
Series Yankees. He now plays for the Giants. I liked his
energy. He's very focused, quiet, solid, intense, no-non
sense. Cube had that in spades. And that's how I cast him.
I loved him in "Boyz 'N' the Hood." I thought he really
hadn't had an opportunity since then to do some serious
acting, which he wants to do, which is why there are no
songs of his here.
I: What led you to write the screenplay?
DR: After I made "Flirting With Disaster," they opened
their log to me — the log of all their properties — and I
saw one line that said, "Heist set in the Gulf War." I was
researching this turn-of-the-century mystery for myself at
the time. And I couldn't stop thinking about this one
thing. I got this "L.A. Times" book that was day-by-day of
the war, and I saw Bart Simpson as well as hundreds of sol
diers being stripped in the desert — this bizarre ritual of
taking prisoners. I thought it was so funny and odd. I saw
green Cadillacs — things that were taken from Kuwait.
And I thought, "1 could go nuts in this environment." And
nobody's done it. And the more I researched it, I thought,

Intermission

green Cadillacs
and Cuisinarts

"There's a story here that hadn't been told." I went down
that road, and I never read John Ridley's script, because 1
didn't want to pollute my own idea. I'm told that it's a
more straight-ahead action picture. John gets credit where
it's due. The germ of the idea that I took was his.
1: Have you ever wanted to direct a screenplay you haven't
written?
[)R: I fantasize about that because it sure would be a lot
easier. I see a bunch of screenplays that get sent to me
Warren Beatty said to me that it's as hard to read a screen
play as it is to write one. And I agree with that. I was sent
"Good Will Hunting," and I didn't get it. I was sent "Fight
Club,"and I didn't get it. Warren Beatty told me that
Robert Towne read the script for "Reds" and didn't get it.
Told him it was a catastrophe. I would love for one to
come through that I love, but that hasn't happened yet.
I: It seemed like you had done a lot of research into the
cultures of Kuwait and Iraq. I liked that you stayed away
from the typical Cowboys-and-Indians stereotyping of
the different cultures.
DR: We had three Arab advisors, because you want to get
the language, the religion and the graffiti right. There were
two guys in our cast who personally defaced like 300 mu
rals of Saddam. And those murals are for real. Those are
taken from real pictures. They make him as everything
a doctor, with children, everything.
I: How did you get Marky Mark, George Clooney and Ice
Cube to play such realistic military characters '
DR: We had three military advisors. One was a Sergeant-
Major Special Forces guy, who had died during produc
tion, perhaps due to chemicals he was exposed to in the
Gulf. Really good guy. Fie was in Vietnam. Tried to steal
a six-ton gold Buddha from a temple. Amazing guy. He
and George really hit it off. The other guy was a trained

Navy Seal — also a Gulf veteran. And a Colonel who was
the sherrif of Sierra Madre, Calif., who was the Sergeant-
Major's commanding officer. His name was King Davis.
We had to hire him because his name was King. They
took the guys shooting a bunch of times, they gave them
the lingo. Then they had a four-day mission. We built our
sets, and they did an assault on the town. But they didn't
sleep out there or anything. They slept in the Holiday Inn.
I: What type offilm did you use to get that fuzzy, docu
mentary look in some scenes?
I)R: I kind of like that digital look. Maybe I'll do the next
movie on digital, because I spent a lot of money making it
look like it's digital. If you look at the color xeroxes from
the "L.A. Times" or "USA Today," [the Gulf War] is the
first war to really have color pictures in newspapers. The
photos have this color Xerox quality to them, which is
very contrasty and kinda blown out, since the colors real
ly pop. So that was what we saw for the look, because I
think it's a really beautiful look. And it also seemed to be
the look of that war.
I: Why did you use that Chicago song in the most dis
turbing scene?
I)R: Chicago cracks me up; every time that comes on, I
start laughing. We had "The Look of Love" in there by
Dusty Springfield, which I adore, but I felt like Austin
Powers had kind of Burt Bacharached us a little, and it
was a tough choice. The intention is that he is very ner
vous, and you see him talking to George and plays it to
calm him down.
I: You did a lot with bullets and sound in the film. And
your gut cam — can you explain where that idea came
from?
DR:The whole approach that I took to the bullets in the
movie was to try to make a bullet alive to an audience who
is benumbed to bullets. So, number one, that means fewer
bullets. I write at a friend's house sometimes, because it's
less lonely, and the friend is an emergency room doctor. 1
was asking him, what does the bullet actually do? He de
scribed it to me. And I asked what's the weirdest wound?
You can get a wound that doesn't kill you. The bullet goes
through your lung and you can walk around. But the air is
leaking out of your lung everytime you breathe. So your
own breathing can kill you, because your own breathing
will crush your organs. It'll turn into a balloon in there.
And they have to puncture it to let it out. And I thought,
"That's never been in a movie." We had this minimal
sound design that I loved. We had this very spare, dense
and quiet sound. And I came back from working with the
composer, and the sound mixers did their professional
Hollywood job, which was to Bruce Willis-ize it. So the
shootouts suddenly became KABLAM — huge bullet!
And I said, "No! Gotta change it." It completely changes
the scene. I wanted "pop, pop," not "BOOM!"
I: / loved the way that the action sequences are punctuat
ed with sound And the way you do explosions, with a
tight shot on your character instead of a bunch of differ
ent angles and the background filling up with explosions.
DR: The whole M.O. here is simpler is better. One shot.
To me, that's more real. The car's blowing up on this guy,
and we just park the camera. Of course the producer says,
"We gotta run three camreras!" But if I cut three ways,
then it just looks like another action picture. Your brain
has referenced that as a cartoon already in your head. It's
like with the bullets. If I want to make you awake to it in
a different way, I've gotta cover it a different way.
I: So that was something you decided to do long before
the editing room.
DR: My whole word is that I don't want to have action just
because it's an action movie. I don't want to have action
that suddenly feels like we went into an action movie. I
