## David O. Russell moves into the spotlight with 'Three Kings' 
### Lauren Russell Contributing writer 
Intermission had the opportunity to talk with David O.
Russell, whose two previous films were "Spanking the
Monkey" and "Flirting with Disaster. " Here, he talks about
his recently released — and highly acclaimed — war film,
"Three Kings."
Intermission: Many people did not take the Gulf War very
seriously. Why did you decide to film a Gulf War movie
specifically, especially during a time where there have
been a lot of otherfilms made about more serious wars?
David (). Russell: When I started, I didn't know that any
one else was making a war movie. Then I found out that
Steven Spielberg and Terence Malick were doing it, and I
didn't care. I thought, "That's territory we've been over a
million times," even if they do it brilliantly. Nobody's
doing this. The [Gulf] War was six months or so. That
wasn't that interesting to me. What was interesting was the
moment everybody stopped paying attention. And that
was very fertile for making a movie. They broke out the
yellow ribbons. They were drinking liquor out of mouth
wash bottles, because no liquor was allowed in Saudi Ara
bia. Meanwhile, these guys are partying, and 60 miles
away there's a democratic uprising. Which to me, was a
mind-blowing opportunity for a movie that felt like
"M*A*S*H" in some parts, and really powerful drama in
other parts. Because you start out with the "M*A*S*H"
partying, they go for ajoyride, and now they're in the mid
dle of something more serious. It naturally goes that way.
I: How did you end up casting Mark Wahlberg, George
Clooney, Spike Jonze and Ice Cube?
DR: The parts were written that way. George Clooney
had a passion for the part, and he was trying to put some

of his weaker pictures behind him. I was happy to work
with him because he had done strong work in "Out of
Sight." Same thing with Mark in "Boogie Nights." He has
a quality of being a regular guy who won't take any shit
and yet also seems very sweet. He's also very serious as an
actor, which I didn't understand, and I think more people
will increasingly understand. His aspirations are equal to
Robert DeNiro's. He's friends with DeNiro. Spike is more
of a friend of mine, and had my ear more. Cube and I
didn't know each other as well. Having Spike around
helped me to aspire to try harder and be more original. I
like that Spike's a first-time actor. It brings a good energy
to the set. It gets everybody on their toes. There's some
body there who's new to it. It throws everybody off a little
bit. Cube was the first person I cast. I wanted either him or
Charlie Hayes, who played third base for the '96 World
Series Yankees. He now plays for the Giants. I liked his
energy. He's very focused, quiet, solid, intense, no-non
sense. Cube had that in spades. And that's how I cast him.
I loved him in "Boyz 'N' the Hood." I thought he really
hadn't had an opportunity since then to do some serious
acting, which he wants to do, which is why there are no
songs of his here.
I: What led you to write the screenplay?
DR: After I made "Flirting With Disaster," they opened
their log to me — the log of all their properties — and I
saw one line that said, "Heist set in the Gulf War." I was
researching this turn-of-the-century mystery for myself at
the time. And I couldn't stop thinking about this one
thing. I got this "L.A. Times" book that was day-by-day of
the war, and I saw Bart Simpson as well as hundreds of sol
diers being stripped in the desert — this bizarre ritual of
taking prisoners. I thought it was so funny and odd. I saw
green Cadillacs — things that were taken from Kuwait.
And I thought, "1 could go nuts in this environment." And
nobody's done it. And the more I researched it, I thought,

"There's a story here that hadn't been told." I went down
that road, and I never read John Ridley's script, because 1
didn't want to pollute my own idea. I'm told that it's a
more straight-ahead action picture. John gets credit where
it's due. The germ of the idea that I took was his.
1: Have you ever wanted to direct a screenplay you haven't
written?
[)R: I fantasize about that because it sure would be a lot
easier. I see a bunch of screenplays that get sent to me
Warren Beatty said to me that it's as hard to read a screen
play as it is to write one. And I agree with that. I was sent
"Good Will Hunting," and I didn't get it. I was sent "Fight
Club,"and I didn't get it. Warren Beatty told me that
Robert Towne read the script for "Reds" and didn't get it.
Told him it was a catastrophe. I would love for one to
come through that I love, but that hasn't happened yet.
I: It seemed like you had done a lot of research into the
cultures of Kuwait and Iraq. I liked that you stayed away
from the typical Cowboys-and-Indians stereotyping of
the different cultures.
DR: We had three Arab advisors, because you want to get
the language, the religion and the graffiti right. There were
two guys in our cast who personally defaced like 300 mu
rals of Saddam. And those murals are for real. Those are
taken from real pictures. They make him as everything
a doctor, with children, everything.
I: How did you get Marky Mark, George Clooney and Ice
Cube to play such realistic military characters '
DR: We had three military advisors. One was a Sergeant-
Major Special Forces guy, who had died during produc
tion, perhaps due to chemicals he was exposed to in the
Gulf. Really good guy. Fie was in Vietnam. Tried to steal
a six-ton gold Buddha from a temple. Amazing guy. He
and George really hit it off. The other guy was a trained
