# REVIEW
## A 						Persian Gulf film fit for kings 
### 
At the start of "Three Kings," the Gulf War has
just ended, Archie Gates (played by a sexily un
shaven George Clooney) is retiring from the
military in a few weeks, and he wants to leave the desert
with more than just his duffle bag. After literally (and
graphically) pulling a secret map out of the enemy's be
hind, Archie sets out with Chief Elgin (Ice Cube), Troy
Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Conrad Vig ("Being John
Malkovich" director Spike Jonze) to steal some of the
gold that Saddam has supposedly looted from Kuwait.
This sounds like the premise of another mindless
Marky Mark sleeper, but David O. Russell's "Three
Kings" is an action masterpiece that has a kind of depth
few action films have produced in the past. With a good
acting performance from the entire cast and a well re
searched and sharply written story, "Three Kings" is a
war movie that will blow unsuspecting audiences out of
their chairs.
Russell shows us that there is more to everything than
meets the eye, and he goes out of his way to uncover the
physical, emotional and cultural effects of the war. Every
bullet fired in "Kings" is important, and when someone
is hit, the audience is given a graphic shot of that person
from the inside to show what internal wounds look like.
We are taken into the villages of Kuwait and Iraq, and it
becomes obvious that the 18 months of research Russell
did for the screenplay were wisely put to use. The char
acters are not black-and-white, and sometimes it is diffi
cult to know who the enemy really is.
The details are what this film is all about. Nobody re
ally took the Gulf War very seriously, but once the tele
vision reporters left, the aftermath of the war left the
lives of many Iraqi citizens (whom had been told by
then-President Bush that they would be supported by
the U.S. if they stood up to Saddam) in serious danger.
Bush's post-war policy toward Iraq clearly had concern

for nothing but money (as did the entire war, according
to Russell), and the pro-Bush Iraqis were literally left to
die after it ended. We are reminded of this in an intense
scene where one of the soldiers holding Troy captive tor
tures him emotionally and physically while explaining
the injustices of American international politics.
As Russell states, this is an action flick, but it is also a
film with "a lot of heart" and a very human side to it.
There is a weighty and moving drama going on beneath
the silly plot to steal a bunch of gold. Troy ends up in lots
of trouble with the Iraqi soldiers who have been guard
ing the gold, and discovers the sad truth about what is re
ally going on in Iraq. Archie, Troy. Chief Elgin and Con
rad end up trying to save the citizens who are being tor
tured for resisting Saddam's control.
To add more layers to the detail, "Three Kings" is
also an extremely light and funny comedy that includes
flying cow limbs and former Saturday Night Live star
Nora Dunn, whose role as an annoying television re
porter adds to the upbeat feel of much of the film. The
cinematographic style of the film varies tremendously,
and it is shot at times with a digital look, a fuzzy docu
mentary look or a crisply focused and clear shot. TTiis is
one of the many methods that Russell uses to capture the
different angles he shows of the war.
When I saw the preview for "Three Kings," I rolled
my eyes — the thought of the Gulf War was a joke in it
self. Then they threw some cheesy actors in there, and I
was convinced that this was another piece of Hollywood
garbage. It is difficult to understand the brilliance of
Russell's film unless you spend the two hours to let him
show you what really went on (and is going on) in Iraq,
and I highly recommend doing so.
