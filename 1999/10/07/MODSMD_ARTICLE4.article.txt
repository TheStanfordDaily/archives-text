# Classes taught 'round the world
## Web-based classes link Stanford students abroad

A cooperative project between
the Overseas Studies Program and
the Stanford Learning Lab is at
tempting to realize the idea of a glob
al electronic classroom through the
creation of multi-site courses.
The courses are offered over the
World Wide Web to students study
ing at campuses in the Overseas Stud
ies Program.
In a multi-site course, an instruc
tor on Stanford's home campus
teaches via a Web site. Students in
overseas programs complete course
assignments on the Web and then
meet locally in discussion groups.
According to Russell Berman, di
rector of Overseas Studies, comput
ers have redefined the relationship
between the overseas campus and
the home campus
"With the revolutions in informa
tion technology, we are able to ex

plore new learning opportunities."
Berman said.
Communication in the multi-site
course takes place at multiple levels.
Students participate in live discus
sion in their local groups, synchro
nous communication through chat
rooms, asynchronous communica
tion using discussion boards and di
rect communication through e-mail
with their instructors.
According to Berman. the courses
are designed so that students work to
gether to understand the kx'al cul
ture. but also work comparatively be
tween cultures.
Multi-site courses were initiated
last year in an attempt to cultivate
"comparative thinking in the era of
globalization." Berman said.
The multi-site course "really
makes use of the fact that these stu
dents are in other countries." said
Pam McNaughton. assistant director
of Overseas Studies. "I think it's a

very exciting concept.
Although Herman said he feels
the courses have been successful, he
still hopes to make improvements,
particularly in synchronous commu
nication.
The program is still in the experi
mental stage and Herman hopes to
introduce instant-message services
and project groups involving students
on the different campuses.
"We want to think of new ways to
build a classroom community elec
tronically across continents,"
Herman said.
Currently, there are 22 students at
Stanford Overseas Campuses in
Berlin, Paris. Florence, Oxford and
Santiago enrolled in the multi-site
Religious Studies course "Religion in
Culture: A Comparative Approach."
During winter quarter, the pro
gram will offer a comparative litera
ture course. "Literary Institutions: A
Comparative Approach."
