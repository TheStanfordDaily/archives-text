Mistakes are strange things. They can be inconve
nient, painful, even heartbreaking. They can also
be educational. "Guinevere," an unconventional
and moving coming-of-age tale set in San Francisco, is the
story of one such mistake.
The film's arresting star is Sarah Polley, familiar as the
self-assured, opportunistic drug dealer in this spring's
"Go." Polley plays Harper Sloane, a law-school-bound girl
uncomfortable with herself, deeply unsure of her future
and out of place in a dysfunctional family of lawyers.
Into her insecurity steps Bohemian photographer Con
nie Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea). More than 30 years Harp
er's senior, he dubs her his "Guinevere" and charms her
into bed, convincing her that she has some sort of profound,
untapped artistic potential along the way.
Connie, of course, is Harper's mistake — "my most
spectacular and cherished fuck-up," as she says in the
movie's introduction. Swept away by the undivided atten
tion of an older man, she falls deeply in love, swallowing his
praise and obeying his commands.
Her first revelation comes when a friend of Connie's
(played by an under-utilized Gina Gershon) reveals that
Harper is hardly the first Guinevere; Connie's predilection
for much younger women and even his come-on lines are
well-practiced. Despite the warning. Harper finds herself
unable to break away until Connie's descent into depres
sion and alcohol provokes a painful climax.
What makes "Guinevere" more than a conventional
"failed romance" flick is its complexity. Connie could easi
ly have come across as a sleazy old lech, but he seems to
genuinely care for Harper — and all the other Guineveres.
Likewise, Harper, who begins the movie as a total
wreck, is believably transformed by her pain. Gentle or not,
Connie's lessons seem to work, a baptism by fire. The
movie is a perfect vehicle for Polley, whose imperfect beau
ty and amazing acting talent is on full display. As the movie
opens, her nervous tics and girlish fear of the world are
deeply affecting. She ends the film a self-assured woman
whose painful affair has taught her to love and forgive.
The supporting cast of "Guinevere" — from Harper's
caustic mother (Jean Smart), who heartlessly cuts to the

quick of Connie's weakness in a precipitous confrontation,
to the equally caustic Sandra Oh as one of Connie's jilted
Guineveres — adds depth and needed comedy to the
movie. Shot in San Francisco, "Guinevere" is a movie any
one who has ever valued a mistake can relate to.
