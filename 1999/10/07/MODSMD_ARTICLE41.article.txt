# 'Romance'
## 
### 
I had one overwhelming reaction when I emerged blink
ing into the sunlight after seeing the French movie "Ro
mance."
Um.. .what?
This as-yet unrated film, written and directed by ac
claimed French filmmaker Catherine Breillat, was my first
foray into the world of what turned out to be soft-core
pornography. The work's focus is the existential journey of
Marie, whose boyfriend claims to love her but has lost all
interest in her sexually. She turns to other partners and
other practices to fill the void in her life (which, we are ex
pected to know, goes much deeper than not getting any
from her lover). The actors do, in fact, have graphic sex on
screen.
Throughout the film, I kept reminding myself that it was
a foreign film, and an indie one at that, and that I shouldn't
judge it by the conventions to which I am accustomed. But
sadly, none of that really helped.
Breillat continually lingers on the characters doing ordi
nary things such as brushing their teeth or making out in a
car like teenagers, in order to convince us that Marie is a
normal woman in a situation that could happen to anyone.
Unfortunately, a long pan of people walking on the beach
does not compensate for the fragmented storyline and

poor dialogue.
She does an excellent job of making Marie's sexual ad
ventures realistic and mundane (no slow-motion or funky
music), hut they end up being a little too mundane. Marie's
tortured inner monologues don't really convince us that
this sexual experimentation is necessary (much less re
motely enjoyable) for her.
To be fair, some of the dialogue problems might be re
lated to translation, but then again, how do you misinter
pret lines like "Physical love is triviality clashing with the
divine?" One of Marie's older and most significant part
ners spends all of his time on screen clothed and mouthing
abstract theories about sex (such as the line just quoted),
most of which make no sense whatsoever.
Occasionally, Breillat makes an excellent point in talk
ing about love and sex, and "Romance" is definitely
thought-provoking. However, she has tried too hard to
make us feel Marie's pain, but we are instead slightly re
pelled by it. Unfortunately, the movie's ending is so bizarre
and completely unrelated that it single-handedly destroys
whatever insights we may have gleaned. Breillat's goal
may have been to challenge our notions of female sexuali
ty, but all she really did was confuse them.
