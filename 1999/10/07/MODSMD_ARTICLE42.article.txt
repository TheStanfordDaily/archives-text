new film is a worthy update to

If you are planning to go see "Now and Then: From
Frosh to Seniors," you should know up front that it's
not related to the star vehicle with Demi Moore,
Rosie O'Donnell and Melanie Griffith. Instead, this
"Now and Then" is a documentary which compares 10
students graduating from Stanford to the way they were
as freshmen.
It is the sequel to "FROSH: Nine Months in a Fresh
man Dorm," the film which followed these same stu
dents through their freshman year. Overall, it's an en
tertaining and informative look at the world that, as
Stanford students, we are currently trying to navigate
our way through.
Keep in mind that it is a documentary, not a high-bud
get Hollywood flick with lots of action and special ef

in medical school. Another who considered stopping ou
due to lack of motivation ended up winning awards fo
her leadership. Personally, I could somewhat relate t(
the girl who argued with her parents after deciding no
to be pre-law, yet ended up going to law school in th<
end.
My main criticism of the film was that the student;
seemed to be chosen to fit certain stereotypes that tht
filmmakers wanted to portray. From the sports-lovinj
frat boy to the overachieving Asian, from the homosex
ual who discovers his sexuality to the African-Americai
who tries not to actively hate whites, "Now and Then'
seems to cover the gamut of stereotypes. This can prob
ably be attributed to an attempt to show a diverse grou|
of students.
It's interesting to note one case where a student wh<
seemed to be chosen to fit a specific stereotype changet
drastically. Debbie entered college as a socially conserv
ative sorority girl. Then, she discovered feminism, ant
decided to "move on" from the sorority, leaving the filn
without a stereotypical sorority girl.
"Now and Then" gives a fairly accurate representa
tion of life at Stanford, and as a college student in gener
al. It's entertaining and informative, even for those wh(
didn't see "FROSH." If you're interested in getting th(
bigger picture about a student's life at Stanford, it's wel
worth your time.

that our lives were beginning to feel like an episode of
"The Real World." Filmmakers Dan Geller and Dayna
Goldfine took this idea a step further, choosing to docu
ment the lives of the students over a longer period of
time. This allows the viewer to see how the students
changed and how they remained the same, while still
keeping the charm of real people as opposed to actors.
Being relatively normal Stanford students, the 10 of
them shared a variety of experiences that should ring a
bell. For seniors, this film can serve as a nice look back at
some of the fun (and not so fun) times here at Stanford:

ing and doesn't really have a central
plot other than following the stu

"FROSH" has been used by Residential Education
programs across the nation, and it wouldn't be surprising
if "Now and Then" were used as a supplementary up
date in the programs. Stanford students in particular
should be able to relate to the film and take something
away from it. This isn't to say that it's not entertaining to
watch, because it is. But it's real-life humor, the kind of
funny stories you heard in your freshman dorm.

complex that comes with being surrounded by so many
extraordinary people; homesickness; rushing a fraterni

think of me."
For freshmen, it can serve as a way to gain perspective
on what may lie ahead. The students all found their lives,
desires and self images to be radically changed by senior
year. One girl who found herself unable to complete the
pre-med curriculum eventually returned to it and is now
