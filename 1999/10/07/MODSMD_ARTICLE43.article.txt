# George Orwell meets Jim Henson
## 
### 
Jim Henson's Creature Shop has come a
long way from the days of the "Muppet"
and "Babe" movies. Their newest cre
ation, a live-action screen version of George
Orwell's "Animal Farm," is the Shop's first
attempt to reach the older crowd.
Director John Stephenson succeeds in
translating the novel's
'Animal Farm' dark side to the screen,
voices of: The powerful scenes
KelseyGrammer from the hook are
Patrick Stewart chilling on screen. Old
Peter Ustinov Major's death sets the
Rated PG tone of the movie from
TNT the get-go: after a
Oct. 7,10,13,16 rousing speech, the in
credibly realistic pig
falls from his perch
gruesomely, and the camera freezes on his
lifeless face. Later, as the animals find the
slaughter-room, the close-ups of the hanging
bodies, as well as Old Major's decapitated
head, bluntly show us the extent of the pigs'
terror.
In an interview with the "Chronicle,"
Stephenson professed his wish to make the
film look "hyper- real" by using close-ups
and lighting. Well, he did it. The extremity of
these camera shots highlight the fascist na
ture of the pigs in particular. Poignant is
Napoleon's liquor-doused snout laughing
along with his "old boy," Mr. Pilkington, as
they make corrupt deals in the house.
The voices for the animals are well select
ed, as well. Kelsey Grammar is appropriate

ly intellectual as Snowball, the pig analogous
to Trotsky in Orwell's anti-fascist novel.
Other highlights are Patrick Stewart as the
über-swine Napoleon and Peter Ustinov as
Old Major. Julia Ormond also turns in a
competent performance as Jessie the Sheep
dog, who disappears for the middle half of
the movie as she bred her puppies.
The most interesting part of the movie,
though, may be the puppets. The Creature
Shop uses real animals as well as their "ani
matronics" to blend a realistic feeling farm
yard. The dogs' mouths are the only really
fake-looking of the effects. The pigs' actions
are impressive, from dictating to drinking.
Napoleon's decline into a corrupted dictator
is visible even on his puppet.
Napoleon's skeleton is a fiberglass sculp
ture that took months to perfect. After the
crew decided the mold was right, they used it
to make a foam latex or silicon skin for the
animatronic puppet. Then the skin was hand
painted and embedded with fur, hair or
feathers as needed. Finally, the molds were
fitted over the mechanics of the puppet.
After so many impressive features, there
are still drawbacks to the movie. In the at
tempt to capture the darker aspects of Or
well's novel, Stephenson has directed a
movie that becomes hard to watch at times.
Evidence for this takes form with my friend
Benji, as he sighed halfway through the
movie, "This is heavy." But a good heavy
movie nonetheless.
