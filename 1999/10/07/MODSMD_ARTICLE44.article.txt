# More like a C-'Minus' than an A-plus
## Overhyped 'Minus Man' disappoints but has a good, eerie soundtrack 
### 
I went to see "The Minus Man" because it had a cool
trailer. I guess that goes to show how effective and im
portant the marketing for a movie is these days.
In the preview, they don't show you a single clip of the
film; rather, you see two people reacting to the movie and
'The Minus Man* talking all night, to the point where
Owen Wilson one l^cm forgets about her day
Janeane Garofalo j° b - The trai,cr is likc a ,itt,e stor y
110 minutes itself, and since the posters have
Rated R taglines like "Don't see it alone.
Unless you like talking to your
self' and "Don't bring a dumb date," you get the impres
sion that this movie is a big conversation starter.
The actual film brings up a few questions and might be
worth a chat over ice cream, but believe me, you won't
miss work in the morning.
The movie centers around a drifter named Vann
Siegert (Owen Wilson). His boyish, beach-blond charm

and quiet nature make him likable, but he has this secret
fascination with fatally poisoning people's drinks. He
gets taken in by a married couple named Doug (Brian
Cox) and Jane (Mercedes Reuhl), and he entertains the
idea of a relationship with a lonely postal worker named
Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo).
When people start dying in the small coastal town, no
one looks to Vann. But then he starts having guilty hallu
cinations involving a pair of police detectives (Dwight
Yoakam and Dennis Haysbert), and you figure that it's
only a matter of time before he gets caught.
It's the story of the serial killer who's an everyday per
son. But since Vann is not an exciting character, "The
Minus Man" becomes a rather dull movie. Vann dis
tances himself from the people who are trying to connect
with him. As a result, we lose our own motivation to learn
more about him, and when questions are raised through
out the movie, the audience is too apathetic to try and an
swer them.

This is a shame, because I understand that the novel
"The Minus Man," by Lew McCreary, is pretty intrigu
ing. Hampton Fancher, who co-wrote the screenplay for
"Blade Runner," adapted "The Minus Man" for the
screen. But it might have been a mistake for Fancher to
direct, because he didn't inspire much excitement out of
great actors such as Reuhl, Garofalo and Wilson.
The coolest thing about this film is its soundtrack. The
score was written by Marco Beltrami, who worked on the
"Scream" movies, which makes for a disturbing intensity
in some scenes. There are also some haunting original
songs by a band called Kittybank.
If you're an artsy-fartsy type who really likes digging
into the human psyche, by all means, take a trip to San
Francisco or San Jose to see "The Minus Man." If you're
looking to be entertained, you're better off watching
"Elmo in Grouchland."
