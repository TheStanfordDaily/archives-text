# Vinyl's Back Baby! Yeah!
## Editorial 
### 
At the beginning of this wonderful decade, in a rare act of activism, I signed a pe
tition called "We Want Vinyl And That's Final." For the youngsters out there,
this wasn't a demand for waterproof clothes. This was about LP's — you know,
records, stacks of wax, stereo gramophones, the things with grooves. Records were be
coming an endangered species, and I joined the ranks for those trying to save them.
There are indeed vinyl true believers out there. Not long ago I once offered to let one
of these guys borrow a CD, and he turned Mr. Hyde on me so fast it was like I had of
fered a Philly cheesesteak to a vegan. But before you label me a Luddite (or run off to
look up "Luddite"), let me lay down some very good reasons to sign such a petition.
1. Vinyl sounds better. That's right! Back in the dark ages of the 1980s, when they in
vented CDs, they had to choose a uniform sampling rate. Sure, the rate was state-of-the
art at the time, but so were Commodore 64's. [eds. note — Our C-64 still works quite well,
thank you.] This low rate means that digital CDs miss chunks of music that analog LPs
don't. The chunks are small enough that you don't hear them, but big enough that your
brain can tell they're missing, and all the super-bit mapped digital remastering in the
world doesn't help. This is what vinyl junkies mean when they say vinyl sounds "warmer"
than digital.
2. Vinyl is cooler. No contest here. Back in the day, artists such as Roger Dean, Barney
Bubbles and the Hipgnosis group were making album sleeves like they were works of art.
When you opened up the "White Album" or "Dark Side of the Moon" you found
posters, lyric sheets, stickers and, if you were really lucky, a roach David Gilmour didn't
have time to finish off. CDs make good drink coasters, but they are definitely not cool.
3. However, the real reason I signed the petition was because vinyl is (or was) cheaper.
You could buy an album for $7 while a new CD was $15. I've got a bad music habit, and
1 need a regular fix. Friends told me "you've got to hear Syd Barrett" and "listen to this
Ornette Coleman" or "dig this Howlin' Wolf." There were 70 years of recorded music
out there, and I had to check them out, without mugging old ladies for the cash.

The real crime is that CDs are dirt cheap to make. Vinyl is a petroleum product, while
CDs can come from recycled tin foil. Sure, when CDs first came out they said the prices
would come down once more pressing plants were cranking out CDs, you know,
economies of scale and all that. 1 don't know about you, but I'm still waiting for my $7
CD.
Ever wonder why CD singles are less expensive than full-length CDs? After all,
they're the same size. Record companies will tell you that more music means more roy
alties to pay to the artist. Some day, take a look at a breakdown of exactly how much of
the price of a CD goes to the artist whose work is inscribed on the little aluminum discs,
and you'll know that Sony Music, WEA, et al are not charitable institutions that exist to
further the aural arts. [eds. note — The views expressed here are the sole opinion of the au
thor and do not reflect the views of the Daily... please, Sony, don't stop sending in those
CDs!!!/
Anyway, after signing this petition, many years passed. I saw the record section of
music stores vanish, including in many "indie" stores. Then, just the other day, in Tower
Records of all places, I found shrink-wrapped evidence of the rewards of democracy sit
ting on the racks. Like the phoenix rising up, there were vinyl LPs by Bob Dylan, Sonny
Rollins, Ben Folds Five and many others, all sporting labels saying " 180-gram audiophile
virgin vinyl" and "original analog mastering." Clearly, my voice had been heard! The
price: $30. feds, note — Chad often hears other "voices " too.] Anyway, I gotta' go. I'm get
ting the shakes and my dealer says he can score me an original mono pressing of "Cookin'
with the Miles Davis Quintet" if I can pay in cash ...

Chad Ls also afraid of "thunder sticks " and "horseless wagons." He also thinks that the ed
itors are coporate whores.
