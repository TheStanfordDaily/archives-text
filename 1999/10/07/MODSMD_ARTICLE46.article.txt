## A
						Guide to the Male Hot-Spots 
### Roxy Sass Staff writer 
Miss Sass was a bit unfair in her last arti
cle when she stated that the penis is an ob
vious organ to manipulate. In many ways it
is. Most men can be brought to orgasm by
subjecting their penises to well-paced, pis
ton-like motions. But a man is not his penis,
despite all evidence to the contrary, and this
rhythmic stimulation is not his only source
of pleasure. A man's body is quite complex
and is literally riddled with erogenous
zones.
Stimulation of an erogenous zone, an
area highly endowed with nerves, can cause
sexual arousal, regardless of the region's
proximity to the genitals. Every man has his
own collection of such zones, many of
which lie outside his boxers or briefs, and
both men and women should be familiar
with these sensitive patches.
Such knowledge can enhance foreplay,
bring variety to sex and even provide an
erotic alternative to full-blown sex. Proper
use of these zones can also lengthen a man's
rise to climax and give him longer, more in
tense orgasms.
Men can quickly discover if they possess
each of these zones by thinking about them
intently. Simply concentrating on an eroge
nous zone often causes a tantalizing tingle.
Some of the less risque zones are partic
ularly good for foreplay. Situated in inno
cent parts of the body, they can be fondled
in public as easily as in the bedroom. These
include the neck; the hands, especially the
palms and fingertips; 'he ears, especially the
lobes; and believe it or not, the center of the
lower back. The soles and toes of the feet
also fall into this category but they're not

quite as readily accessible.
Other non-genital zones include the
inner thighs, the nipples, and the mouth, but
stimulation of these regions requires
greater discretion when in the open.
The above-mentioned zones exist for
both men and women, but the penis-related
zones are strictly male, for obvious reasons.
The entire penis is an erogenous zone ex
tending down to the testes, but it contains
several regions of ultra-sensitivity.
The frenulum is one such spot. It is a v
shaped patch of skin located on the under
side of the penis where the ridge that runs
around the penis head breaks. For many
men, this is the most sensitive part of the
penis.
Also along the underside of the penis lies
an incredibly sensitive blood-vessel-like
seam. This ridge covers the urethra, a tube
capable of registering extreme pleasure.
Most methods of penis-manipulation stim
ulate this region, but it is sensitive enough to
merit special attention.
A third hotspot is the perineum, the
patch of skin between the testes and the
anus. Massaging this area stimulates the
prostate gland, which has been linked to
very satisfying orgasms. Actually, the best
way to stimulate the prostate is through
anal sex, if you're up for it.
All of these erogenous zones can give in
tense sensations of pleasure, but if mal
treated, they can also cause mind-blowing
pain. These sensitive regions should be ap
proached slowly and gently. Every region
requires a different amount of pressure and
a different type of stroke. Only through ex
perimentation can the best techniques be
found.
Happy hunting.
