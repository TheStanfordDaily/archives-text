# non-Stop Hip Action at The Blue Plate
## 
### 
Located at the intersection of Mission
and Valencia, the understated facade
of The Blue Plate is only recognizable
by the muted glow of little blue candles flick
ering in its windows. Inside you'll find San
Francisco's young, hip and affluent crowd
chomping down on well-presented upscale
Napa-Californian cuisine served on '50s
tableware. I was tipped off to this "best-kept
secret" of the Bay Area by some black-beret
and-turtleneck-wearing, finger-snapping,
greasy boho art student who was on his way to
a show at the Great American Music Hall.
Anyway, I started off this week's culinary
odyssey by mingling in the back porch of the
restaurant, sipping a can of Olympia beer
("It's in the water") as my friend and I waited
for our table to be
cleared. I liked the
The Blue Plate mellow, tiki-lit
3218 Mission St. "mood-lighting" on
San Francisco, CA the garden-patio, and
(415.282.6777) I was impressed that
Open 6:30 till close, Tue.-Sat. such a fancy restau
-101 North, Army Street (West) exit, turns rant with a compre
into Cesar Chavez, left on hensive selection of
Mission, and it's on the right side. fine lagers, micro
brewskis, beer (try
the hearty Belgian
Chimay for $12) and wine was still modest (or
maybe just "hip") enough to serve one-dollar
Oly's. For those of you more interested in the
EANABs, they also served Coke in the vari
eties of Mexican or Diet.
The staff was pretty friendly and of course
"hip" (we noticed that one of the waitresses
was East-Bay punker!), and the
place was minimally appointed with vintage
retro decor — done more classy than camp —
mixed with contemporary artwork hanging
from the walls. And the fresh flowers in tin
vegetable cans and votive candles at every
table made for a romantic dinner-date setting.
Some items on the menu may have been
difficult to understand for those not versed in
finer cooking (i.e. what's a "roasted
walu?!?"), but in general, the dishes were sa
vory and creatively prepared. There were lots
of meat entrees though the vegetable dishes
were just as tasty.
We started out with a salad of tatsoi greens
tossed with summer tomatoes (yellowish heir
looms that looked a little "funny" but tasted
delicious), grilled bread (spongy and delicate)
and bocconcini mozzarella ("buffalo" style!).
Next, we had tagliarini pasta with chantrelle
mushrooms, corn, sage and ricotta cheese. It
was amazing — the pasta was perfectly al
dente, the chantrelles rich and buttery and the
corn fresh and crisp. I also got a side of "Sage
Mashed Taters" which was good but not par
ticularly special.
Overall, the meal was excellent. However,
if you happen to be tight on cash and don't feel
like blowing your paycheck at the Blue Plate,
I would also recommend the equally delicious
yet affordable burritos at the Taqueria Can-
Cun just across the street!
