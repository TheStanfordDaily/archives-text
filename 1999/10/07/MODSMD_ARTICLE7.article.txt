## Obuchi visits nuclear accident site 
### 
i OKAIMURA, Japan (AP) — On a visit to
the site of Japan's worst nuclear accident. Prime
Minister Kei/o Obuchi on Wednesday admitted
the country's system had been inadequate to
prevent such a radiation leak.
His visit to the uranium-processing plant, an
apparent attempt to allay fears of lingering radi
ation. coincided with public outrage over grow
ing evidence the accident was caused by a disre
gard for safety procedures.
Just hours before his arrival, police intensi
fied their investigation into whether operators of
the plant were criminally negligent. About 2(H)
police raided the plant and the Tokyo headquar
ters of the plant's operator. JCO Co.
They were looking for evidence of wrongdo
ing in the Sept. 30 accident, which sent three
workers to the hospital, forced the evacuation of
surrounding homes and kept hundreds of thou
sands locked in their homes for fear of contami
nation.
"This accident has become a concern not only
to Japan but to the whole world." Obuchi said
after spending 25 minutes on the grounds of the
plant. "I wanted to come to the site as soon as I
could."
He could not enter the building where the
uncontrolled nuclear reaction occurred because
radiation levels inside remain too high.
"This was something we did not foresee." he
said as he left the site.
"As this was an accident that we had not
imagined, our system was inadequate," he said.
Obuchi said he intended to review laws
related to nuclear accidents and. if necessary,
present changes during the next parliamentary

session.
Police said late Wednesday that about 260
items were seized in the raid on JCO's Tokyo
office and about 7(H) items were seized from the
plant in Tokaimura, about 70 miles northeast of
Tokyo.
The search at the plant continued into the
night. Among the items seized were reports on
procedures at the plant and other documents.
JCO official Shigeyuki Negami said the com
pany was consulting with government and nucle
ar experts on how to clean up the site, but he did
not know when any effort would begin.
To avoid a further radiation leak, Negami
said, workers were piling up sandbags around
the building.
Assured that radiation levels have returned
to normal, residents have resumed their nor
mal lives. A jogger ran around the perimeter
of the plant Wednesday, and parents strolled
with small children. Fear and anger remain,
however.
"Our village was built on nuclear power,"
said Miwa Sukegawa, a housewife with two chil
dren. "But with this, nobody really trusts them
anymore."
Tokaimura was the site of Japan's first com
mercial nuclear reactor and has for decades been
the centerpiece of Japan's ambitious nuclear
power program.
Japan's 51 running nuclear reactors now pro
duce about a third of the country's energy needs,
and the government hopes to increase that sub
stantially over the next decade.
But the accident a week ago could make that
goal harder to achieve.

Thursday's accident is hardly the industry's
first. Another nuclear facility in Tokaimura was
the site of an explosion and radiation leak that
exposed 37 people two years ago.
JCO has acknowledged that this time, work
ers (nil a large amount of a powdered uranium
compound in liquid nitric acid in stainless steel
buckets, instead of using the proper equipment,
and did the processing b\ hand.
The workers involved had little knowledge of
the chemical substances they were handling and
of what quantities would set off a self-sustained
nuclear chain reaction, police said.
Newspapers reported on Wednesday that
monitoring cameras placed around the plant to
keep tabs on employees were always turned off,
and that workers rarely wore their pocket radia
tion detectors.
Japanese media also reported that the Sci
ence and Technology Agency was considering
revoking JCO's operating license if it could con
firm the safety lapses. Agency officials refused to
comment.
The two workers most seriously exposed in
the accident remained near death Wednesday,
though one received a transplant of vital blood
stem cells to replenish his body's ability to pro
duce white blood cells.
Doctors said it would take two weeks to tell
whether the transplant — which according to
Japanese news reports was the first ever for a
radiation victim — was successful.
The second worker was awaiting a similar
transplant, doctors said. None of the 46 other
people who were contaminated required hospi
talization.
