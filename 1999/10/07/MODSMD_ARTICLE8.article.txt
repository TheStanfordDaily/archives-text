LONDON (AP) â€” Searchers
working their way through a train
carriage that was transformed into
an inferno in a rush-hour collision
reached a grim conclusion Wednes
day: The death toll may exceed 70.
Twenty-eight people are known
to have died when the two com
muter trains collided at the height
of rush hour Tuesday morning near
London's Paddington Station. They
are likely to be some of the missing
70. but police have not yet indenti
fied the bodies recovered.
Authorities also have received
reports from friends and relatives
about another 1 (K) people who may
have boarded the trains.
Metropolitan Police Deputy
Assistant Commissioner Andy
Trotter was asked at a news confer
ence if the final death toll would be
as high as 170.
"I don't think it is going to be as
high as that. What 1 can say at the
moment is that it is 70-plus." he
replied.
"Yesterday's train crash was a
terrible tragedy, the scale of which
is only just becoming apparent," he
added.
The blaze reached temperatures
estimated as high as 1,800 degrees,
burning a first-class carriage so
badly that emergency services have
not yet finished examining it.
At least 14 of the 150 people
taken to local hospitals were seri
ously hurt.
Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott announced an urgent inde
pendent inquiry into train protec

tion systems designed to prevent
trains passing through signal lights
when they are at red.
The assessment of the available
systems will be carried out indepen
dently of the public inquiry Prescott
announced Tuesday.
Survivors have been speaking of
the horrors they witnessed.
Among them was Brendon
Bentley, who described from his
hospital bed the terrifying moments
after the crash, when dazed and
frightened passengers scrambled to
escape from the burning train.
"I could see the flames and there
were some people trapped under
neath the seats," he said. "We had
to try to get over them and try to
give them a hand, but we couldn't,
so then the first priority was just to
get off the carriage."
An emergency doctor at St.
Mary's Hospital, where many of the
injured were taken, said the injuries
were among the worst he'd ever
seen.
"You had people coming in with
their faces bandaged and just their
two eyes looking out and the smell
of burnt flesh." said Robin Tou
quet.
Police and firemen continued
Wednesday to search through the
widespread, mangled and burnt
wreckage of Britain's worst rail dis
aster in a decade.
"We are sure that no other sur
vivors will be found." Trotter said.
"It is increasingly clear that there is
very little else to recover from the
scene."

One passenger who escaped. 3K
year-old Steve Jones, said he got
out when another man in the car
riage used a table to break a hole in
the window.
"It was pretty horrific. I feel
incredibly lucky," said Jones, who
was hospitalized with burns.
Meanwhile, the train companies
said their investigation would focus
on the outbound I hames I rains
service, which may have gone
through a red light.
The London-bound Great West
ern train had a green light to pro
ceed. according to a statement
Wednesday by Great Western.
Thames Trains and Railtrack. the
company which operates the rail
infrastructure.
Signals in the vicinity were in

working order, the statement said.
Thames Trains earlier said its
driver had been working for two
months after completing 11 months
of instruction.
The train companies said they
were studying a specific signal that
the train drivers' union had com
plained was invisible at some points
to drivers leaving Paddington.
There had been at least eight inci
dents of trains going through red
lights at that signal since IW3. the
union said.
I uesday's collision occurred on
the same stretch of track where a
IW7 crash killed seven people and
injured 150. Great Western had
been fined $2.47 million for "dere
liction of duty" in connection with
the earlier crash.
