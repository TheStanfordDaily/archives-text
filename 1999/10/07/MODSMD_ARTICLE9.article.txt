DILI, East Timor (AP) — Peacekeepers
fatally shot two anti-independence militiamen
Wednesday while repelling an ambush near East
Timor's border with Indonesia — the first clash
since the U.N.-mandated force arrived 16 days
ago. Two Australian peacekeepers were slightly
wounded.
Also Wednesday, the troubled territory's
Nobel Peace Prize winner. Bishop Carlos Belo,
returned to his homeland after fleeing at the
height of last month's militia rampage. He is the
first major independence figure to return to East
Timor since the violence that lorced thousands
from their homes and destroyed much of Dili,
East Timor's capital.
Wednesday's clash began in the morning
when Australian troops shot the tires of a truck
full of militiamen that drove past a newly estab
lished roadblock in Suai. a militia stronghold
near the border. Eour passengers were injured.
Dozens of militia members were disarmed
and taken by peacekeepers to the border with
Indonesian-controlled West limor, where thou
sands of anti-independence fighters have sought
shelter along with an estimated 256.(XX) East
Timorese refugees.
The ambush occurred nine miles east of the
border, as the same peacekeepers returned to

Suai later in the day.
"That small-vehicle convoy was ambushed by
an unknown number of people with firearms.
The soldiers immediately entered a counter
ambush drill." Australian army Maj. (Jen. Peter
C'osgrove. head of the international force known
as Interfet. told reporters in Dili.
The rest of the assailants fled the scene.
Peacekeepers recovered two military-style rifles.
The incident confirmed security concerns the
peacekeepers have expressed as they have
fanned out across East Timor.
"This is the first time that Interfet soldiers
have been wounded by enemy action. It is the
first time that Interfet has been called upon,
regrettably, to take lethal action against an
adversary." C'osgrove said. The only previous
gunfire by the peacekeepers involved warning
shots on two occasions.
The militias have been massing in West Timor
and have repeatedly threatened to launch guer
rilla attacks and retake East Timor.
Belo. meanwhile, smiled broadly as he was
embraced by Roman Catholic nuns, priests and
others after stepping off a private plane from
Darwin. Australia. He fled East Timor on Sept.
7. He described conditions in Dili, which was
damaged when pro-Jakarta militias, backed by

the Indonesian military, went on a rampage alter
East Timor's overwhelming vote for indepen
dence from Jakarta in an Aug. 30 referendum.
"It is worse than hell." he said.
Col. Mark Kelly, chief of staff for Interfct. said
his troops would provide protection for Belo.
Following the I J.N.-sponsored independence
referendum. Belo's Dili home was burned and
refugees who had sought shelter there were
killed. Others were rounded up by Indonesian
troops.
In Dili, a U.N. official announced Wednesday
that the first of the refugees who fled to West
Timor — many reportedly at gunpoint — would
be repatriated Friday.
. The World Food Program said Wednesday it
would begin distributing food to refugees in West
Timor under an agreement reached with the
Indonesian government.
The United Nations on Wednesday repeated
demands for unhindered access to refugees in
West Timor, where they reportedly have been
intimidated by militiamen.
Kelly confirmed reports that a letter smuggled
out of West Timor claimed militias there were
raping and murdering refugees in a tiny Fast
Timor enclave that is separated from the rest of
the province.
