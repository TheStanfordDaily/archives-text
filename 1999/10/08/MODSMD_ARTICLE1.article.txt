Mike Green of Collegiate Con
sultants on Drugs and Alcohol, a
former alcoholic who has been
sober for 21 years, spoke to a packed
audience in Cubberly Auditorium
last night at the Pledge / New Initi
ate Symposium.
All pledges or new initiates since
the last rush period, as well as chap
ter presidents, were required to at
tend or submit a typewritten state
ment explaining their absence. All
those required to attend submitted
signed invitations to be tallied later,
so as to insure that each fraternity
and sorority was represented by the
appropriate members.
The sponsoring organizations
recommended that all other Greeks
attend as well, particularly pledge
educators and social chairs. A sepa
rate presentation was held from 7
p.m. to iS p.m. for athletes.
In the past, the Office of Student
Affairs has staged a program such as
this one, concerning alcohol, rape or
related issues, for this audience, but.
due to understaffing and other prob
lems. they were unable to do so this
year. Collin 1 iathaway, president of
Sigma Chi. had seen Green speak
and was already planning to invite
him to speak at Stanford, and the
OSA agreed that the event could
serve as a substitute.
Green began his career speaking
at Westchester I Jniversity. where he
coached football until a position
opened for a drug and alcohol coun

selor.
"People liked what they heard
and 1 had so many clients calling me
that 1 stayed with it." said Green.
Green began his talk by asking
his audience a series of questions
concerning their drinking habits.
After establishing that many of the
students present had been drunk,
thrown upas a result of drinking and
had other drinking-related prob
lems, Green asked if anyone had a
drinking problem. Only two stu
dents raised their hands.
Green used this response as a
starting point for his talk, saying that
having a drinking problem was not
equivalent to being an alcoholic. He
said that many students have what
he terms "one nighters. a short-term
problem of one night that can have a
lifetime of consequences."
"Alcohol is part of the Greek sys
tem," Green said. "We don't hurt
our friends and we don't encourage
them. We watch their backs be
cause. bottom line, we can save a life
that way."
Green loosely structured much
of the rest of his talk around this
idea, namely the concept ol friend
ship and the responsibility one has
to one's friends.
Throughout the rest of his pre
sentation. Green addressed the
medical aspects of alcohol, the ef
fects of irresponsible student drink
ing on parents, the propensity of stu
dents to overspend on alcohol and
the generalization that alcohol is a

male issue. He pointed out that
women drink as "hard" as men and
that they are also affected by alcohol
insofar as it makes them a victim of
rape and related crimes.
Many students, prior to hearing
Cireen speak, said that they did not

expect the symposium to be particu
larly valuable. "I don't really mind
going," said Mike Murphy, a sopho
more and member of Theta Delt's
pledge class. "It wouldn't be my first
choice of a Thursday-night activity."
Mike Scitz, a sophomore and
Theta Delt pledge-class president,
agreed. "I think the symposium is a
good idea, but, no matter what,
every single frat, and probably

sorority, too, isn't going to think this
is worthwhile."
Alter hearing Green speak, both
had changed their opinions. "I
thought it was really interesting that
he didn't focus on the actual drink
ing as a big deal, but more on the
issue of being responsible and tak
ing care of your friends," said Seitz.
"It was much better than I ex
pected it to be," said Murphy.
