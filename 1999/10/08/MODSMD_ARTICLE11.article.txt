A Daily editor dis
cusses a problem com
mon to many students

I have a long and potentially painful
problem set that I need to be doing
right now. This concern dominates
my thoughts as I sit here in the Daily
office, so I trust that it is no surprise that
it has drastically affected the course of
this installment of the Editor's note
book.
Both the due date of said problem set
and the timing of my editing duties at
The Daily tonight were documented well
ahead of time. Naturally, better planning
could have alleviated the situation. Why
not complete the problem set earlier in
the week? I suppose it would have
excluded the three dozen other things I
had to do.
My esteemed Editor in Chief has just
walked past my workstation inquiring
about the topic of this Editor's note
book. I smile and say it's about the fact
that I have too much to do.
"Gripe, gripe, gripe," he says in
response, in more colorful terms than I
feel would be appropriate to relate here.
"Suck it up and deal with it,"he grins.
But I get the point. 1 have my
moments of complaining incessantly
about all the work I have to do. Yet it's
not as though 1 didn't bring it all on
myself. I knew two quarters ago when I
decided to switch majors and start com
pletely from scratch that I was going to
have to take on some heavy loads. I
knew perfectly well what agreeing to be
an editor again would entail with respect
to how much time I would have for other
less important activities, such as sleep.
So I suppose I'll just have to admit it
here: yes, I'm a chronic over-extender. I
would say that this is different from
being a workaholic; I don't feel any need
or desire to have something intellectual
ly heavy to do IS to 20 hours a day. This
is unhealthy.
I don't think I'm an overaehiever
either. 1 don't have any pretense of being

the best in all of my classes. I'm certain
ly not working at The Daily for my
resume, since I doubt 1 will have any
thing to do with journalism in the "real
world." I guess I tend to pack a lot of
things into my schedule that will inex
orably compete for my attention. And as
is the case tonight, one responsibility or
desire gets attended to the exclusion of
others. This usually causes me disap
pointment and sometimes some degree
of despair.
I look around me, among my friends
and co-workers, and I see similar situa
tions. 1 see the same multi-page to-do
lists, I hear the same sort of complaints.
So I suppose I should rest easy, given
that I'm not alone in my freakishness.
Hut since this appears to be a common
phenomenon, there must be some logi
cal, or at least documentable reason that
we all keep putting ourselves through
this sort of time-management nightmare
every quarter.
Here's my theory: maybe it's the fact
that we're multi-dimensional people.
Many of us came to college not just for
the degree but also for the experiences,
the people. We feel that there's so much
that we're interested in and only four
short years to get as much out of these
things as we can. There's the specter of
the real world that hangs over our heads
(especially senior year) — the routine of
a nine-to-five job, of needing to go to
bed at 11 p.m. instead of 2 a.m. We fear
'jr rr **
that if we don't do it now, we might not
get a chance again once we graduate.
OK, so as multi-dimensional people,
we probably won't become dullards
when we graduate. But there's some
thing to be said about making these four
years really memorable. Looking back at
the string of hellishly busy quarters, I
can't really say that I regret any of them.
I'd even go so far as to say I had fun.
I've gotten advice — good advice,
from people I trust — saying that I
would enjoy the things I do more if I did
fewer of them. Perhaps. But I doubt it
would be half as exciting.
