Negotiations proceeding
smoothly
We have read with some interest your
editorial regarding the current negotiations
between UCSF-Stanford Health Care and
the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU).
For the record, we would like to clarify
that the hospital has been negotiating with
SEIU since March and that agreement has
been reached on many items. However,
some issues remain unresolved, so we have
now sought the assistance of the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service to assist
us in reaching a final agreement.
The Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service is uniquely effective in this regard
because of their neutrality and the fact that
they have no vested interest in the outcome
other than the successful conclusion of nego

tiations. Their role is to assist management
and labor to reach mutual agreement on dif
ficult issues. They do not have the disadvan
tage of the perception of bias which might be
attributed to anyone close to either the hos
pital or the union, no matter how neutrally
and skillfully that person might carry out the
role of mediator.
As a matter of information, over half of
the employees of UCSF-Stanford Health
Care are represented by unions, including
the California Nurses Association, the Com
mittee for Recognition of Nursing Achieve
ment, the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees and the
San Francisco Building Construction and
Trades Council. For each of these unions,
UCSF-Stanford I lealth Care has successfully
concluded negotiations with agreements that
were recommended by the unions' negotiat
ing teams and ratified by the members.

UCSF-Stanford continues to bargain in
good faith with SEIU in hopes of soon reach
ing agreement on a contract. We are confi
dent that, with the help of a Federal media
tor, we will he able to resolve the remaining
issues and successfully conclude negotia
tions. We also believe strongly that the only
place to resolve those issues is at the bargain
ing table through the respective negotiating
teams that have been duly designated by the
union and the hospital.

Remodel, but don't commer
cialize the CoHo
Starbucks?
1 hope that the new layout was the only

thing to remind Kim Wood house of Star
bucks.
The beauty of the CoHo sat in the plaid
garage-sale sofas and scratched-up tables. It
shined from the dim lighting where studying
wasn't really possible, but you brought the
course reader along to feel productive. It per
meated from the gray walls and funky ran
domness that sat above the counter. It lived
in the servers who never looked uniform but
always checked ID. I don't ever remember
the CoHo being about "streamlined food
ordering" or "lighting fixtures" or even ...
coffee. I'm glad to hear that the renovated
coffee house will "for the most part, look the
same."
Make the CoHo wheelchair accessible.
But please, don't make it a Starbucks.
