# Off-campus help expanded

As construction of new graduate student housing in
Escondido Village continues at a feverish pace, students
searching for off-campus housing options are faced with
few vacancies and ever-increasing rents.
Mi/ttoWiVM* (Xmmiunity Housing Services has tried to
; Jtfv.bucden^hatgraduate students face in the inter*
the number of subsidized off-campus
units.
"We have more than doubled the number of subsi
dized off- campus units. Last year there were 250 students
living in subsidized housing; this year, over NX)." said
Kathleen Bransfield, director of Housing Assignment
Services.
Graduate students are given subsidized housing as
units become available, primarily during fall quarter.
While still unable to house all of the unassigned gradu
ate students, the subsidized housing program is neverthe
less a key resource until the residences under construction
are ready for occupancy.
When asked about the future of subsidized off-campus
housing, Bransfield responded, "While not entirely clear
whether the subsidies will be necessary after the added
housing is built, the University is committed to solve this
problem. It's something that we are able to do because our
former provost, C'ondoleezza Rice, was very generous in
allocating money."
One apartment complex with 40 subsidized units is
Apartments on Sand I lill Road. Without the
subsidy, students would pay monthly rents anywhere
from $1895 for a studio to $2695 for a two-bedroom apart
ment shared with a roommate. The University subsidy
lowers the rent significantly.
With the subsidy, single students living in a two bed
room apartment with a roommate pay anywhere from
$567 to $6IS a month, and couples pay anywhere from
$979-$ 1107 for a one-bedroom apartment.
While $100 to $2(K) higher than on-campus rents, the
subsidized off-campus housing is generally of high quality
and still represents a good value.
"I pay $550 a month, plus utilities. Without the subsidy
I'd be in San Francisco paying a lot more," said German
Studies doctoral student Sean Mclntyre.
Mclntvre lives in University-subsidized housing in
Mountain View.
"They've done a beautiful job, their responsiveness is
astounding. I quite often feel like I'm being treated too
well, and the amenities are remarkable" added Mclntyre.
"The disadvantage is that it's a 20-minute drive to cam-
pus."
Community Housing Services
also maintains listings of general

available housing. "If people are still
looking, we are the place. We pro
vide a service to the landlord and to
the students," Bransfield added. In
an effort to stimulate added listings,
the landlord listing fee was eliminat
ed last year.
