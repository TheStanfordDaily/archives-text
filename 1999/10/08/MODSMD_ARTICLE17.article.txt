# Week to focus on South-Asian women's health

"Don't underestimate the value
of a small contribution," said med
ical student Chaya Bhuvaneswar, di
rector of the South Asian Women's
Health Project. Beginning Monday,
the project will, for the first time,
kick off the SAWHP Health Week,
an outreach designed to increase
health awareness among women of
the Bay Area South Asian commu
nity.
"Historically in South Asia,
women's health has not been em
phasized," said Bhuvaneswar.
A desire to change this reality has
been the driving force behind the
Health Project, which evolved this
past summer.
According to Bhuvaneswar,
many new, working-class, South-
Asian immigrants lack access to
basic health care. Indeed, South
Asians have the third-highest infant
mortality rate in the state of Califor

nia.
Bhuvaneswar said that while
low-cost clinics do exist throughout
the Bay Area, their outreach efforts
have not been effective in the South
Asian community â€” many of those
in need speak only the Indian lan
guages of Hindi, Punjabi or Gu
jarati.
Since the Health Project's con
ception, its initial efforts have cen
tered on outreach. Volunteers have
visited local religious sites, including
Sikh and Hindu Temples, as well as
factory and production work sites.
Contact information for workshop
candidates has been gathered
through the visits.
Bhuvaneswar said that "immi
gration status is ... an issue," be
cause some South-Asian women
may not be legal immigrants and
therefore hesitate to seek health
care. Bhuvaneswar said that as a re
sult, even efforts to contact women
in their native tongues have been

met with resistance.
Bhuvaneswar, a former Rhodes
Scholar and a Yale graduate, said
SAWHP has grown mainly due to
volunteer efforts. Juniors Ritu
Bhatnagar and Nandini Gandhi are
among those who served as summer
volunteers, and students at UC-
Berkeley have also been involved.
Other instrumental members of the
Health Project include Saroj
Prasad, mother of a Stanford re
searcher Manika Prasad, and Preeti
Kalra, editor of "Feet Walk the
Sky," a new anthology of South
Asian writing.
The Health Week will focus on
encouraging preventative health
care. Prenatal care for pregnant
women will be stressed, and the issue
of STDs will also be tackled. In the
South Asian community, where so
cial stigmas exist with respect to pre
marital sex and sexuality in general,
this is an especially tough battle, ac
cording to Bhuvaneswar.

"A lot of women are afraid," said
Bhuvaneswar.
To deal with this issue, a
"women-only space" will be main
tained at the workshops, and volun
teers will try to "package STDs with
the larger picture of gynecological
health."
The long-term goals of the
Health Project focus on building re
lationships with health care-provid
ing institutions. Bhuvaneswar said
that breaking down the language
barrier through the use of inter
preters is a major goal.
SAWHP plans to work with
Arbor, the free clinic run under the
auspices of the Medical School.
SAWHP will provide women in the
program with both translators and
free transportation to the clinic.
SAWHP highlights its main pur
pose as "helping people make links."
