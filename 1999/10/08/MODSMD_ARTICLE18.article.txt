## Average tuition rise sees major dropoff 
### Chris Drake 
The College Board reported this
week that the average cost of attend
ing a four-year private U.S. institu
tion rose 4.6 percent this year, slight
ly greater than Stanford's 3.5 percent
increase.
TTie national average increase is
one of the lowest in 30 years, al
though the national inflation rate is
also significantly lower. Over the past
decade, the average tuition / fees in
crease has been much higher: 5.9 per
cent.
Stanford's tuition and fee increase
is a figure similar to increases at its
peer institutions. Harvard Universi
ty's tuition and fees increased by 3.3
percent this year, while the Princeton
pricetag rose by 3.5 percent; these are
30-year lows for both schools. Yale's
tuition increased by slightly over
three percent.
I lowever, tuition at those schools
is higher than Stanford's. For exam
ple, while Yale's tuition will be
$24.5(X) this year, Stanford's will be
$23,058. The average price of attend
ing four-year private universities in
the Northeast is higher than at than
their Western counterparts, accord
ing to the College Board.
As for room and board, Stanford's
percentage increase in charges falls
below the national average once
again. Room and board costs 1.4 per
cent more this year than last year.
The College Board has identified 2.4
percent as the national average for

four-year private institutions. The av
erage over the last 10 years is 1.6 per
cent.
In addition to this year's compara
tively low tuition and room-and
board increases, this year's financial
aid availability is at an all-time high.
According to the College Board,
some $64 billion will be available to
assist students nationwide this year.
Stanford has mirrored this increase
by adding $500,000 to its financial aid
pool.
Officials in the Financial Aid and
Dean of Students Office could not be
reached for comment.
While Stanford's tuition increase
is relatively light, students can't claim
to be pleased.
"In the current scheme of things,
[the lower tuition increase] doesn't
make any difference because tu
ition's already so high," said fresh
man Jen Ackerman. "It matters, but
it's something you have to take in
stride."
"Since we only get a 3.5 percent
increase and the national average is
[higher], it would seem we're getting
the good end of the bargain," fresh
man Anne Gregory said. However,
she added, "since we already have
one of the highest tuitions in the na
tion, it doesn't help my pocketbook
any."
"I think tuition could be knocked
down," said Ackerman. "They get so
many private donations around here.
It'd be nicer if they raised it every
other year."
