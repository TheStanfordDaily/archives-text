# Students find 'alternative'
## 
### Jess Dang 
In the past few years, studies have shown the increas
ing popularity of alternative medicine in the United
States. Seniors Tom Chi and Bruce Wang, who founded
the Alternative Medicines Club, hope that the club will
generate enough interest among students to launch a class
on the topic this spring.
Chi and Wang were pleased with the turnout at the
club's organizational meeting yesterday. Most students in
attendance displayed great interest in the field of alterna
tive healing; many already knew about herbal medicines,
acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine, according
to Chi and Wang.
"1 am very excited that Tom and Bruce have decided
to create this club. I hope it allows younger students to get
involved in this growing field," said senior Brooke Val
lenari.
Vallenari has been exploring the use of alternative
medicines for the past six years. Last year she traveled to
China to further her study of herbal healing.
Chi and Wang's motivation to start the club stemmed
from their studies at Stanford. Chi is a human biology
major, while Wang is majoring in philosophy and biology.
Seeing that many Ivv League schools such as I larvard.

Yale and Columbia already have undergraduate classes
on alternative medicine, Chi and Wang hope to one day
provide the same course offerings at Stanford. They hope
the club will bring about interest in the field.
Club activities and workshops will bring in experi
enced practitioners and lecturers in hypnosis, massage
therapy, acupressure and herbal healing. Workshops will
focus on the theory behind alternative forms of medicine
and teach students alternative ways to stay healthy during
the llu and cold season.
As of now, the Stanford Partnership, an organization
that provides financial support to student-initiated
groups, has provided funding for the club. The two
founders are looking for additional funding and interest
ed faculty in order to begin an alternative medicines class
spring quarter. They envision the class as bringing in guest
lecturers and providing a deeper look at the history and
the current practice of alternative healing, much like the
workshops they plan.
"The club is starting out with a strong core of people
who already have a background in alternative medi
cines." Chi said. "We are definitely still looking for more
people who might be interested in this growing practice.
1 lopefullv, we'll see the club pick up a lot of momentum
in the months to follow."
