# Harvard buys documents also owned by Hoover

News of I larvard University's recent $600,000
purchase of 10.000 microfilm reels detailing over
seven decades of Russian communism broke this
week amid a Hurry of con fusion and mini-scandal.
A news release billed the documents as "previ
ously classified documents." and an Oct. 6 Har
vard Crimson article touted the acquisition as ■"ex
clusive." a "huge collection of formerly top-secret
Soviet archives."
The catch? Stanford's Hoover Institution lias
owned this "top-secret" material for almost a
decade.
The Crimson also reported that 1 larvard's new
collection will be open to all students, and that the
Hoover documents are available solely to post
doctoral students.
All Hoover archives are actually open to the
public and to all members of the Stanford com
munity and are always free of charge.
Sally Baker, 1 larvard press officer and director

of communications at the Faculty of Alls and Sci
ences, clarified that though "there may have been
one person involved ... who wasn't aware of all
the documents that Stanford had," most people
involved in the purchasing decision knew "from
the beginning... that Hoover Institution had |the
documents] first."
"We were not under the impression that I lar
vard would he the only site for them," Baker
added.
In April, when the project proposal first came
to the attention of officials at Harvard's Davis
Center for Russian Studies, it was "clear to them
... that Hoover Institution had the materials."
though "they did not understand the extent ol
I foover's microfilm collection." said Baker.
Elena Danielson, Hoover archivist, down
played any potentially embarrassing aspects of
the story and asserted that the issue is "not really
a scandal."
She said that many of the news reports are in
accurate. Contradicting yesterday's San Francisco
Chronicle article claiming 1 loover Institution offi

ciuls were almost gloating over Harvard's gaffe,
Danielson said, "We are pleased that I larvard has
the archives and hope that the donor knows that
his contribution is appreciated."
Harvard's purchase of these extensive Soviet
history documents was funded by I larvard alum
nus George O'Neill. Danielson said that the
Hoover Institution is "very happy that Harvard
found a donor" because without the gift. I larvard
likely wouldn't have made such a costly purchase.
When asked if she believed I larvard had paid
an unfair price for the collection. Baker replied.
"No. not at all. At $(•>() a reel, which is normal for
microfilm, it was a very good deal."
I he Hoover Institution has always held a large
collection of Russian materials. "Since it began
collecting Soviet material in l l )2l. the institution
has amassed the world's most extensive collection
of documents outside of Russia on the Bolshevik
Revolution and its 74-year aftermath." wrote
Bernard Butcher in the Mav /June issue of Stan-
ford Magazine.
The collection became even
more comprehensive in 1992, when
a lucrative deal was scaled between
Charles Palm, deputy director and
chief archivist of the 1 loover Institu
tion, and Rudolph Pikhoia, then
chairman of the State Archival Ser
vice of Russia.
The Russians approved
Hoover's purchase of the recently
declassified documents, and, in re

turn. the institution sent Pikhoia a
unique collection of documents cat
aloguing the late Tsarist period, a
valuable collection that scholars in
Moscow had previously not been
privy to.
The 1 loover Institution has been
microfilming the documents since
1992. A British company, Chad
wyck-Healey Ltd., processes the
microfilm and markets it to other
institutions. Chadwyck-1 lealey me
diated the recent Harvard pur
chase.
The controversial documents re
count the history of the Soviet

Union from 1917-1991 and contain
information that was not accessible
prior to the Hoover project. The
documents include information re
garding the secret inner workings of
the KCiB and original documents on
the Soviet Politburo.
Though the documents are in
Russian, Hoover archivist Lora
Soroka has compiled an index in
Fnglish. Danielson reported that
Soroka "summarized the most inter
esting documents," including the in
famous Fond 89, a collection that
seeks to document the extent of So
viet atrocities.
