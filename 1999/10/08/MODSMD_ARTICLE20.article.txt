emphasized that the purpose of the
event was to prove "a vegan diet isn't
necessarily boring."
A vegan diet abstains from all ani

based foods.
The food was donated by Univer

health food companies, including
Whole Foods, Country Sun and
Amy's Kiethen. University Dining
Services contributed food to last
year's event and works closely with
Stanford Vegan Action to promote
and provide dining options for vegans
and vegetarians in the dining halls.
An estimated 1 .(XX) people were at
the event.
"Incredible," Pasnick said about
the turnout. "Many people remem

Plaza from a friend and decided to
come and perform. "It's really a great
event.... I hope to come again next
year," she said.
Working the grill was high school
senior Reid Saaris from Seattle.
Saaris read of Vegans in the Plaza in a
vegan newsletter and said he was
both surprised and delighted to find
that the event was on the same day as

his campus visit. "So, I just decided to
help out," he said.

planned and is predicted to be bigger
and better with more food, more live
entertainment and more tent space.

expressed interest in contributing
food.

build a network to bring people of all
dietary preferences together. "We try
to promote veganism on campus in
relation with health, environment
and animal rights," explains sopho
