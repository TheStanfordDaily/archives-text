## Behind the scenes of the dining hall 
### Christina Harvey 
Freshman Raul Bianchi said ad
justing to dining hall food was a sig
nificant transition for him.
"Being Italian, 1 got lots of good
food at home, and 1 guess I 'm just not
used to this," Bianchi said. "[Food's]
not worth the money we pay for it."
Shirley Everett, the director of
University Dining Services, pointed
out that managing Dining Services is
much like trying to compete with
3,700 moms such as Bianchi s.
Value enhancement
Everett's goal through the value
enhancement program is to increase
the quality of food across campus
while lowering cost, while keeping
the student rates the same. Everett
hopes to keep costs down by only
serving paying customers.
"When some students are eating
free, everyone else is paying for it,"
she said. "We don't want this to turn
into a police station, we just want the
dining halls to get the revenue they
deserve."
Surveys and head counts have led
her to believe that this is a significant
problem on campus.
Everett also wants to keep stu
dents from taking china and silver
ware from the dining halls.
"We order 300 cases of china each
year — that's four times the capacity
of what we would actually use," said
Rafi Taherian. the executive chef.
"But we have to keep that because
students take the dishes."
Last year the replacement cost of
china and silverware was $40,(XX).
Everett was also concerned about the
cost of all the wasted food.
"We just want students toeat what
they take," she said. "Often our eyes
are larger than our stomachs."
Taherian agreed that waste is a
significant problem.
"The garbage can is always full of
food at the end of each meal, often
with whole untouched fruits," he
said. "We can't use any of it again."
Christopher Kanaan, a freshman
in Otero, said he thinks students
waste food because it doesn't meet
their expectations.
"The dining halls present it well, it
smells good, it looks appetizing and it
seems like there are so many good
choices," he said. "But when it comes
down to eating, you don't like it. so
you throw it away. It's because of the
taste. You notice the soft serve
doesn't get wasted."
"Nobody can teach taste, but we
can learn from the students," Taher
ian said. "I don't think we use enough
salt and seasoning in our foods. You
find lots of salt in restaurant foods;

that's what makes the flavor stand
out. But we get health complaints
when we use a lot of salt."
Keith Guy, the associate vice
provost for Student Housing and
Dining Services, said Dining Services
adds variety to combat that problem,
but "potentially, we're just diluting
the taste of all our varieties," he ad
mitted.
Pricing and Quality
Junior Anne Terry said she under
stands the purpose of a dining plan,
but she feels the dining plans need
more flexibility.
"I know why we have to buy the
plans," she said. "But we need a more
realistic eating plan. I never eat all of
my meals. They make you pay for
meals whether or not you eat them."
Taherian said the meal plans are
mandatory for students to lower the
burden of the overhead cost.
"The more students who are en
rolled in the plan, the less it will cost
per student," he said.
Everett said she knows students
are not going to eat all 14 meals of
fered on the plan, and the plan is
priced to account for that difference.
Regardless, Stanford's meal plan
ranks up with the most expensive col
lege meal plans across the country.
Though students often wonder
why they can't have money back for
meals they haven't eaten, Everett
noted that student surveys show that
Stanford students would rather have
an all-you-can-eat meal plan than a
declining balance meal plan.
Everett said all dining services
across the country price meal plans
according to their expenses, including
overhead and accounting for the
number of students. Though schools
with a la carte "declining balance"
meal plans such as those offered at
Manzanita may sound more afford
able. Everett suspects they are not.
"If schools like Duke are giving
money back to their students at the
end of the quarter, they must have
priced that into the plan." she said.
"But the declining balance system is a
financial nightmare anyway."
Despite the efforts of the dining
services, students are still concerned
about the quality of the food, espe
cially at Stern I fall or at Branner I fall.
"Having eaten in other dining
halls last year as well as Stern, I would
say it wasn't so much the variety of
the food as it was the quality of the
food," said sophomore Rachel
Meisels. who lived in Stern last year.
"And seemingly, their favorite thing
to do was to re-use the food, so if we
had baked potatoes one night, we'd
have sliced potatoes the next night,
and mashed potatoes the next night."

Taherian insisted that no differ
ence in quality or variety exists be
tween the dining halls other than the
presentation and the atmosphere.
"Students eat with their eyes,"
said Everett. "The ambiance has a lot
to do with it."
Terry said she eats at Florence
Moore's dining hall almost every day,
despite living in Trancos.
"I disagree that there's no differ
ence between the dining halls." she
said. "At Wilbur they don't have a
good salad bar. and there's not a good
variety, especially for a vegetarian. I
have no problem paying money toeat
at FloMo, but I have a problem pay
ing for Wilbur food."
Guy conceded that some differ
ences might be more than psycholog
ical.
"There is probably some uneven
ness in the spicing," he said. "Maybe
we're not always consistent. We are
definitely challenged by some of the
older facilities, which is why their ren
ovation in the summer of 2(KK) is one
of our high priorities this year."
Terry also said she can't find a
good selection of healthy food.
"The grill is all grease, and the
pasta is fatty," she said.
Guy responded to that concern.
"That's an interesting dilemma," he
said, "because the items that are
healthy aren't the popular items."
Health concerns
Students often wonder why. after
paying approximately $9 per plate at
dinner, they can't take some food
with them out of the dining hall as
leftovers.
"There was this guy who was real
ly strict about us taking food out of
dining halls," said sophomore Paul
Woody, who lived in Lagunita last
year. "He wouldn't even give me
saran wrap because he said it encour
aged people to steal from the dining
hall."
Everett said Stanford has to be

strict about removing food from the
dining hall because it's unknown if
students will give the food to other
people. Also, she said, there are ro
dent and health issues if the food is
not properly refrigerated.
11 owe ver, Taherian said that stu
dentscan always take their apples, or
anges and bananas out with them.
Religious concerns
"For Jewish Passover, which is
eight days long, the dining halls were
given a list of the certain restrictions
on what we could eat," Meisels said.
"But, I couldn't ever eat the main
dish. Somehow it was always cen
tered around pasta. It was a big prob
lem. so I ended up not eating in Stern
for most of Passover."
Taherian said he was upset by this
account.
"We purchase the products for
Passover in advance." he said. "All of
the dining halls get the ingredients at
the same time, so 1 don't understand
how that could be. Maybe they were
out, and she just didn't see them."
