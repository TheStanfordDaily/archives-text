## Greek boarders adjust to house life 
### Katie Leonberger 
Some Greek organizations offer
students an option for housing that
many may not consider. Boarding
in a fraternity or sorority house is
one of the many housing options
available to students looking for a
house with good food and a lively
atmosphere.
But why would one want to live
in a house filled with people in
volved in an organization of which
he or she is not a member? And do
the members of these respective
Greek groups have any say in who
lives in their house?
Junior Stephanie Keever. a
member of Kappa Alpha Theta

sorority
house, has
had a taste of
both worlds.
Last year as a
sop ho more,
she was one of
three board
ers in the
Delta Delta
Delta house.
"Living in
Tri-Delt was a
great experi
ence that 1
would do
again." she
said.
Now. as a

member and resident of the Theta
house. Keever extends her hospi
tality to Theta's two current board
ers. "Being a boarder last year caus
es me to make an extra effort to
hang out with our boarders this
year." she said.
Junior Carinne Johnson, one of
Theta's boarders, explained her
choice of residence as a result of
being unassigned and unpreferred
from last year's draw with a draw
number of 2882.
"This house is such an improve
ment in comparison with Wilbur
and Sterling Quad." Johnson said.
In terms of not belonging to the
sorority chapter. Johnson respond
ed, "It's no big deal. I hey all knew
each other before, but now we're
meeting people."
Senior Dave Saperstein. one of
two boarders in the Theta Delta
Chi fraternity house, concurred
with Johnson and Keever.
"I love living here." said Saper
stein. "Once you express a little in
terest [in the fraternity], you're
golden."
The Greek Housing Criteria
specifies that each Greek group

must be able to fill its house to 100
percent occupancy at the end of
Spring Rush. However, houses can
take on boarders on a quarter-by
quarter basis in the circumstance
that members of a Greek house are
overseas or living off campus.
"It is up to the Greek houses
themselves if they want to have
boarders or not — but each house
must be filled to 1 (K) percent capac
ity due to the scarcity of housing in
general," explains Ann Porteus, the
associate director of Residential
Education.
In addition to having its own in
dividual boarder agreements, each
house is responsible for finding its
own boarders.

Finding
hoarders does
not seem to
be too diffi
cult for hous
es that need
and /or want
them. While
most current
boarders
stress the im
portance of
having other
non-boarders
in the house,
others say it is
important just
to know
someone in

the house fairly well.
Either way, good food, friends,
location and better rooms than
other houses all seem to be motiva
tors for both present and potential
boarders.
Adam Messner, a junior swim
mer faced with limited housing op
tions next year, said that he is con
sidering boarding in a fraternity.
"Swimmers in past years did it
and really liked the house atmos
phere without going through the
pledge process," explained Mess
ner.
The way into this housing option
seems to be through the side door.
Typically, a potential boarder will
hear about the opening for a board
er from a friend — or the friend of a
friend — in the fraternity or sorori
tv.
And the members of these
Greek groups seem to like the non-
Greek additions to the house. Se
nior Theta Delt Chris I lenderson
points out another advantage of
having boarders: "[The boarders]
are better looking than most of us
so it does a lot for our reputa
tion!"
