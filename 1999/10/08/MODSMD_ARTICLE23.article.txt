# From the earth to Stanford: Matson adds department chair to her credits
## 
### Heather Wax 
There's an old riddle about a US
pound man who must traverse a high,
creaking bridge that can support only
150 pounds. The problem is that he
has three one-pound cannonballs
and time for only one trip across. The
solution to this aged conundrum is
that the man juggled the cannonballs
while crossing.
While the problem seems suited
for a logic or physics professor.
Pamela Matson. Goldman Professor
of Environmental Sciences, appears
to have figured it out. Since crossing
the Bay Bridge in IW. when she
made the move from UC-Berkeley to
Stanford. Matson has had to juggle a
world of competing matters — teach
ing. research and family. As of Oct. I.
she's added Earth Systems Program
director to the mix, weighing down
the importance of her finding a satis
fying and feasible equilibrium.
"Life has gotten very, very busy,
and I'm still trying to figure out how
to balance it all," said Matson.
But students in the Earth Systems
Program, part of the School of Earth
Sciences, don't seem to be too wor
ried.
"I hope she doesn't get too busy,
but she's pretty busy already, and I
think she's done a fabulous job," said
senior Bonnie Linde, who has taken
Matson's Earth Systems 111, a class
on the biosphere.

That may be because Matson
knows that juggling is more than the
dexterous manipulation of keeping
three balls in the air with only two
hands; it also includes passing multi
pic objects between two or more will
ing people.
"No one person can know it all,"
she said. "You can only be an expert
in one field, and then you have to rely
on other experts from different
ones."
Matson said that she came to the
Earth Systems program at Stanford
because she could help link depart
ments. something that is important to
a program in which courses are
taught by faculty from the schools of
Earth Sciences. Engineering and 1 lu
manities and Sciences.
"The time has come for people
who look at environmental issues
from different points of view to work
together more," she said.
There also wasn't this sense for a
lot of Stanford undergraduate stu
dents until 1990. when the program of
Earth Systems, which pulls together
geology, engineering, biology and
economics to study the environment,
began.
But Matson herself was no
stranger to an interdisciplinary cur
riculum. She received a bachelor's
degree from the University of Wis
consin in 1975, with a double major in
Biology and English. After earning a
master's in Environmental Science

from Indiana University and a doc
torate in Forest Ecology from Ore
gon State t Jniversity, she worked for
10 years as a research scientist at
NASA Ames-Research Center. It
was there. Matson says, that she
"learned how to work with different
disciplines and think in an interdisci
plinary way."
Matson and her husband. Biologi
cal Sciences Professor Peter Vi
tousek came to California together,
after meeting at Indiana close to 20
years before.
"I got my offer at NASA before
he got his offer from Stanford," she
jokes. "Really though, we were very
lucky to come to a place and both
have good professional opportuni
ties."
The two started teaching Biology
and Global Change — also called
Earth Systems-Biosphere — togeth
er in 19X8. Matson had also worked
extensively with economist Roz Nay
lor and Wally Falcon of the Institute
for International Studies when she
decided to leave the Environmental
Science Policy and Management pro
gram at UC-Berkeley and come to
Stanford in 1997.
Matson, who says she "never
thought about being in administra
tion of any sort." found herself the in
terim director of the Earth Systems
program during Biological Sciences
Professor Joan Roughgarden's sab
batical last year.

Roughgarden, who had the choice
of returning to the position of pro
gram director upon her return last
month, decided to resign now rather
than at the end of the year so that
Matson could continue "the energy
and momentum she had built up" as
acting director.
"It didn't make sense to hang on
for a year and hope that she would
step in a year hence." said Roughgar
den.
After starting a curriculum review
last year, which Roughgarden says
brought new attention to the pro
gram. she's already thought about
what she plans to work on during her
term as director.
"I'd like to develop and introduce
field courses that let students see how
the world works in terms of geology,
soil, hydrology," said Matson.
Vitousek, who has done his own
field work with his wife in the Ama
zon and Costa Rica, knows that his
wife can be "at once formidable in
pursuit of a goal, and inclusive."
But it seems that Matson will be
focusing more on large-scale envi
ronmental problems studied by the
Earth System program than on her
own uncertainties of time manage
ment and balance.
"How do you plan life? You don't.
You just try to be prepared and take
opportunities as they come," she
says."And my story is the same as
any other woman —juggling a lot."
