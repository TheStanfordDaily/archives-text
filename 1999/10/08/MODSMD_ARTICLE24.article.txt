It usually takes an NCAA tour
nament to provide a forum for the
toughest collegiate competitions,
but this weekend the very best in
college water polo will be on dis
play as 16 teams, including each of
those ranked one through 10, con
verge on two Bay Area locations
lor the NorCal Tournament.

â–  Saturday-Sunday: No. 2 Stanford
(K-l) competes at the NorCal Tour
nament. deGuerre Pool.

Fortunately for Stanford, one of
these Bay Area locations is

the advantage of playing in the
friendly confines of its home pool.
No. 2 Stanford (S-1) hopes to he
playing in the championship

match, but the Cardinal will have a
tough road to the final, "at least
three tough games" according to
Stanford coach Dante Dettamanti.
In preparation for the tourna
ment, the Cardinal squad has
worked on a few key things in prac
tice, including continuing the
strong counterattack and improv
ing 6-on-5 offense and defense.
Additionally, the Stanford squad
has focused on preparing for spe
cific defenses it might see this
weekend.
The Stanford squad opens play
on Saturday at <X a.m. at deGuerre
against UC-Santa Cruz. The Ba
nana Slugs are a Division II team
that recently dropped out of the
top 20. The Cardinal should have a
fairly easy time of it against Santa
Cruz. Dettamanti said he will focus
on keeping the players well rested
and giving everyone a chanpfc to
plav.

"Once wc get past that first
game, it starts getting tough." Det
tamanti said. Assuming Stanford
defeats the Banana Slugs, the team
takes on the winner of No. 7 UC-
Santa Barbara and No. 10 UC-San
Diego.

played this season. Ile describes
the Gauchos as "tough and scrappy
with a really good last break." 1 lav
ing previously defeated No. S Pep

State, Santa Barbara should give
the Cardinal a tough game.
If Stanford wins this second
game, it will play in the semifinals

Goalie Nick Ellis and the rest of the Cardinal will be looking for a rematch this weekend after losing to
the Bruins the last time the teams met.
final at the SoCal tournament, a
game which Stanford won 11-10.
A victory against the Trojans
would likely set up a meeting be
tween Stanford and current No. 1
UCLA at 4:30 p.m. on Sunday.
Stanford won the first meeting be
tween the teams, a 9-7 victory in
the semifinals of the SoCal tourna
ment. A week later, the Bruins
turned the tables on the Cardinal,
handing the squad a 6-5 defeat, its
first of the season. A Cardinal win
in the finals would likely allow
Stanford to reclaim the nation's
top ranking.
With all of the country's best
teams in attendance, Stanford will
be hard-pressed to come away with
the championship.
But as the No. 2 team in the na
tion and the winner of September's
SoCal tournament, the Cardinal
appears to be in the drivers' seat.
