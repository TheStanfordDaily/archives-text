MEN'S SOCCER
■ Today: Stanford (5-2-1.0-0 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) vs.
Denver (3-7.0-0).
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Air Force
Academy (7-3,0-0).

Confidence should not be a
problem, afc the team that has won
23 of its last 25 home games, heads
into conference play with a three
game winning streak, including a 4-
0 blowout over Dartmouth and the
Stanford Nike Invitational title last
weekend.
Despite their success so far this
season, the men still have a long
way to go if they want to make a re
peat appearance in the NCAA fi
nals.
"As our first league games of the
season, we are anticipating a cou
ple of difficult, physical games," se
nior co-captain Gerard Davis said.
"League play offers teams another
avenue for gaining entry into the
NCAA tournament and that, com
bined with the fact that we will he
away from home, will make this
weekend a challenge."
Both Denver and Air Force are
new additions to the MPSF this sea

son. so its tough lor the ( ardinal to
know what to expect. The men are
hoping that their preseason trip to
Scotland and competitive early
schedule will prove to have been
just the preparation they needed to
put both teams away.
"I have heard that both sides are
direct and physical and both diffi
cult to play on their own turf." said
head coach Bobby Clark.
"I do feel that our side is well
balanced and can cope with a skill
ful team or a physical team, si) I am
sure we will handle whatever they
throw at lis.'' jM jm/
Judging from their respective
preseason play. Air Force looks as
if it will be a tougher opponent for
Stanford than Denver. The team
already boasts six shutouts for the
year and has outscored its oppo
nents 27-7 in its first 10 games. Air
Force is coming off a 9-7-3 season
and returns five starters.
Meanwhile, the Pioneers of
Denver have had a rocky start to
their season, managing only three
wins. Things may be improving for
the Pioneers, however, as they will

enter rriday s game coming oil two
big wins.
Regardless of the statistics, the
Cardinal will not be taking a thing
for granted this weekend, especial
ly considering the elevation and the
fact that road games never come
easily.
"We can't expect the wins to
come easily, it will take a lot of
work also." Davis said.
"Although, n we can keep the
momentum we have created in the
past few garnet going, we should
have a successful weekend."
"It's hardest to break a habit."
Clark said. "Losing's a habit and
winning's a habit. It would be nice
to make winning our habit."
And Clark thinks his team has
the right comb/nation to do so.
"The team's coming together. In
the early part of every season,
you've got to fight and try to get
balance into the team." Clark said.
"Now I think we've gotten ... the
right players in the right spots, we
just have to get comfortable with
each other so that everything's au
tomatic."
