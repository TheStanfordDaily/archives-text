## Harriers look to championship 
### Barry Cooper Staff writer 
Coming off a dominant performance at last week
end's Stanford Invitational, the No. I Stanford women's
cross country team will get a well deserved break in in
tensity (his Saturday at the Long Beach State Invita
tional in El Dorado Park. Calif.
Having justified its ranking by defeating No. 2
Arkansas and No. 3 BYIJ, the Cardinal heads south
with a squad nearly identical to the group that won the
collegiate section of the Stanford Invitational last Sat
urday. I he big guns that took the title in the invitation
al section will get the week off.

WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY
â–  Tomorrow: No. I Stanford competes at the Long Beach
State Invitational.

"One of the objectives on our women's team is to
have many people contribute and play a significant
role," said Stanford head coach Vin Lananna. "And this
w ill be an opportunity for some different people to play
a significant role in our progress toward the champi
onship portion of the season. What we'll attempt to do
is put them in a position where they are scoring points."
I lie top challenger for first place will be No. 19
UCLA's "A" team. The Bruins' "B" team finished
fourth in the collegiate section at the Stanford Invita
tional. Yet, more important than placing well this week
end may be the opportunity for the Cardinal to run on
the course for the Oct. 30 Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships.
"One of the objectives in selecting Long Beach ver
sus somewhere else is that we can get a feeling of what
the Pac-10 course is like," Lananna said. "1 don't think
we have to have exactly the same athletes actually run
on the course to gel a feel for it. For me to be able to see
it and for some of our athletes to run it makes a lot of
sense."
Among the nine Stanford athletes competing are se
niors Shaluinn bullove and Mary Huang. Fullovc took
the individual title in the collegiate section last weekend
in a time of 17 minutes. 5<X seconds over the five-kilo
meter course, while Huang placed 42nd in the invita
tional section in 1<X:()X. Together with Fullove and
Huang, sophomore Colleen Flaherty and junior Anne
(iunnison seem to have the best shots at being a part of
the championship season among those traveling to
Long Beach.
I hat portion of the season is right around the corner,
with the unofficial start next weekend at the Pre-
N( A A Meet in Bloomington. Ind. From there the team
heads back to Long Beach for Pac-lOs, to Portland. Ore.
for the NCAA Western Regional Championships on
Nov. 13 and finally to the NCAAs in Bloomington on
Nov. 22.

Despite the excellent showing last weekend. I .man
na feels the team's work is far from done.
"As we come to a peak performance I'm hoping that

we'll be much faster than we cur
rently are," Lananna said. "Most
of our energy has been directed
toward making sure that we pay
close attention to what we're
doing as opposed to what the rest
of the country is doing.
"So I think we have long way to
go in terms NCAAs. We can run
closer together as a pack. We can
run faster, we can go out faster
and 1 think we can have a better
close. We'll do everything we can
to have an ideal championship
season. That's what we're after.
Until we score 15 points [perfect]
at all the championships, we have
a long way to go."
