It doesn't matter that the No. 20
Cardinal boasts impressive 7-3 (0-
0 Pacific
ing off a challenging preseason
schedule, with two of those losses
coming against teams ranked No.l
and No.3.
What does matter is that this is
conference match. I his is what the
Cardinal has been preparing for all
season. Two wins this weekend
against Oregon and Oregon State
would be the first en route to a Pacif
ic 10 Conference title and an auto
matic berth to the NCAA tourna
ment. Two losses would make that
goal much harder.
"This is what we have been antici

pating all season." senior defender
Natalie Kim said. "At the very begin
ning of preseason, we set goals that
we wanted to achieve. Winning the
rty*' 10 is one of thos»-gi#»ls, on
k vf»y at| <>al —an
NCAA championship."
