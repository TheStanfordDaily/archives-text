# Field hockey spends weekend clubbing

Coming off of an 8-0 blowout
against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo,
the women's field hockey team (4-5,
3-0 Northern Pacific Conference)
takes a crack at another club-level
team this Saturday when it takes on
UC-Santa Barbara at 11 a.m. on the
Varsity Astro Turf Field.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Tomorrow: Stanford (4-5) vs. UC-
Santa Barbara, 11 a.m. Varsity As
tro Iurf Field.
■ Monday: Stanford vs. Davidson
College (7-3), 3 p.m. Varsity Astro-
I'urf Field.

The club competition shouldn't be
too tough, seeing as both the defense
and offense were able to put so many
past the Cal Poly goalkeeper last
week, but this time of the season is
hardly the time for the Cardinal to
start taking things easy.
Instead, the team must look ahead
to the upcoming Division I competi
tions that leads to the NorPac tourna
ment and can determine the fate of
the ( ardinal's postseason. Alter Sat
urday's game, Stanford heads on a

road trip to Philadelphia and a string
of five games in seven days, all against
teams that may carry potential for
ranking advancement.
Monday's match brings a team
that Stanford has never competed
against. Davidson College from
North Carolina ventures to the Bay
Area to take on Stanford, California
and Pacific. Davidson (7-3) has start
ed strong this year after last year's re

building left its record under .S(X).
With seven seniors on the team,
they're off to a strong, confident start.
Competing against a team for the
first time makes it difficult for the
Stanford team to know what to ex
pect. The only comparison to use is a
common matchup against St. Louis
University early in the season. Both
teams posted a shutout against St.
Louis (Stanford 3-0, Davidson 4-0),

so Monday's 3 p.m. competition is
hound to he an evenly matched
game.
Alter two weeks of low-key
games against its alumni and two
club teams, Stanford is a little restless
to encounter some tough competi
tion.
"We've done a lot of conditioning
and shooting drills in practice these
past couple weeks, and we're anx
ious to put them to work under pres
sure," said senior defender Julie
Gwozdz.
The trick to Monday's game is to
be able to concentrate on the present
when preoccupation with a five-day
road trip can be a distraction. Head
coach Sheryl Johnson handles this
distraction with a constant reminder
in the form of a sign by the field:
"Leave 'it' at the gate."
Everything that's happened in the
day, whatever preoccupations or
deadlines, must be left off the field
during practice and during games.
With this simple request, the players
are asked to give their full attention
to field hockey for a few crucial
hours.
As the team begins to turn its
record into a winning percentage, the
slogan seems to be working.
