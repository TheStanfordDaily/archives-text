# Dis-O starts new conference
## 
### Regina Richter 
How well do you know your
Stanford history? Why were 294
Stanford students arrested in 1987?
Why isn't there a campus Taco
Bell? How long has Stanford Uni
versity offered a degree in Asian
American Studies? Why do Stan
ford students vote every autumn
quarter whether to offer grapes in
dining facilities?
Answers to these questions and
more are found in this year's Dis
orientation Guide, which made its
annual debut on Wednesday.
In addition to the book, the Dis
orientation Coalition is. for the
first time this year, sponsoring a
conference called "Dis-Oricnta
tion 1999," on Oct. 9. The day-long
event seeks to involve more stu
dents in on-campus activism.
The conference will take place
in Cubbcrley Auditorium, begin
ning with registration at 12:30 p.m.,
and will involve Stanford students
in alumni- and peer-led workshops.
Dinner and entertainment are in

cluded in the day's agenda.
For the past five years, the Dis
orientation Coalition has pub
lished the Dis-Orientation Guide
in an effort to initiate "a new per
spective on the history of [the Uni
versity], its current structure, and
the [student's] role in it."
The goal of the Dis-Orientation
Coalition is to educate the campus
about issues that spark rivalry and
hatred among groups. Dis-Orienta
tion 1999 seeks to involve students
in issues that threaten the well
being of the University from the in
side.
Coalition members said that the
University facade often conceals is
sues. such as what members say is
the University's tough attitude to
ward unions and the University's
acceptance of corporate sponsor
ship from companies viewed as
having unethical labor practices
overseas.
Many issues hide under Stan
ford's public image, but as Charisse
Domingo, an alumna and work
shop leader, adds, "Stanford is a

microcosm of what s going on in
the real world."'
The guide's organizers began
distributing the booklet early
Wednesday morning to freshmen
outside certain Introduction to the
I lumanities lectures.
Tim Ly, a junior, commented
that the Dis-Orientation guide "al
.ways targeted frosh: they are the
ones going through the orientation
process." Ly also added that often,
"students aren't presented with the
history of the institution, with what
made the University what il is."
The pamphlet directly addresses
numerous social and political is
sues of interest to Stanford stu
dents. The guide also includes sev
eral new articles focusing on events
such as last spring's mass e-mail
that condemned the administration
for encouraging campus diversity
and used harsh and racist language.
Organizers say that the Dis-Ori
entation IW conference arose as a
result of the guide and these ex
pressions of intolerance.
The event allows students to
"connect with students in a more
tangible way," Ly explains. "The
hope for the conference [is] to em
power students to feel like they can
really make a difference .... [and
this] change will carry on after the
Stanford experience."
Dis-Orientation organizers in
sist that while Stanford may often
seem like an idyllic place, intoler
ance still exists.
The Asian-American Studies
program, begun in 19% as a result
of student activism, still lacks ade
quate faculty and funding, accord
ing to group members.
Additionally, there are students
who still want to bring back Stan
lord's old mascot, the Stanford Indi
an, even though the symbol stereo
types Native Americans, according
to Dis-Orientation organizers.
