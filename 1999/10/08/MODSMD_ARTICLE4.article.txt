# Keeping the campus safe
## SURE introduces new cart, approach 
### Megan Lindow 
Stanford United for Rape Elimi
nation. a dusk-til-late-night safety
service more commonly known as
SURE Escort, has stopped offering
rides to non-disabled men and has
introduced a new wheelchair-acces
sible golf cart. SURE believes that
both changes will help it to offer bet
ter service to the people who need it
the most.
When asked why this service is no
longer offered to men. Alejandro
('orncjo. a junior and director of op
erations at SURE, responded that
he felt offering rides to men limited
the services SURE could offer to
women, who are generally more vul
nerable to rape.
"I think anybody who opposes
that policy would have to make a
case that men are as vulnerable to
rape as women," he said.
However, several students ex
pressed mixed feelings about the
new policy.
"I was under the impression that
SURE was to make the campus
safer. There are very legitimate rea
sons why men might not feel safe
traveling around at night." said
sophomore Mandy Wetsel. "1 think
it should be offered to them. It is un
fortunate that Stanford thinks the
campus is safe for men and not for
women."
Cornejo emphasized that if a
man calls concerned that he is in
danger. SURE Escort will give him a
ride.
In addition, some students feel
that the service helps to curb other
campus problems such as drunk dri
ving.
"I've used them to help take peo
ple who are drunk home. It's good if
you have someone at a party, and
you want to get them home." said se
nior Joseph Henry. "I don't know
how big a problem rape is on the
Stanford campus. If Stanford is
funding it. I think it shouldn't only
be open to women."
Other students agreed that fe
male passengers should get priority
but also contended that many stu
dents also use the service because it
is convenient, not because they are
afraid of being raped.
( ornejo wants to eliminate abuse
ol' the service, which was designed to

protect women walking at night.
Cornejo said that SURE Escort has
limited resources, with four golf
carts (including the handicapped-ac
cessible one). SURE Escort em
ploys 23 students (about half of
whom are male), and the service re
ceives between 10 and 15 calls per
night on weekdays, and between 25
and 30 calls per night on weekends.
Cornejo estimates that the aver
age wait for a ride ranges from five
minutes on a weekday night to be
tween 10 and 15 minutes on Fridays
and Saturdays.
"Last year we would give rides to
a group of four guys going to a party.
Meanwhile, there's some more vul
nerable person across campus who
has to wait 20 minutes longer,"
Cornejo said.
Sophomore Howie Petros, who
works as a driver and dispatcher for
SURE, said. "When we answer our
calls, we say, 'Stanford United for
Rape Elimination,' not "Stanford
taxi service.' While I don't mind giv
ing rides to guys, women take prece
dence over men."
According to Petros, when a man
calls up wanting a lift, dispatchers
are instructed to say, "We are un
able to offer rides to men who are
not handicapped or in serious dan
ger of being raped."
"It sounds pretty reasonable to
me, if it's to preclude rape," first
year graduate student Frances Park
er said, 'if a guv is worried about his
safety and they allow that, I don't
see a problem." she added.
According to Petros, many of the
people who use the service are grad
uate students and faculty who are
flurried about walking home from
their offices or even just going to the
parking lot. Undergraduates tend to
be less worried, she said, except on
weekends.
"On weekends it's just crazy, es
pecially the late shift with people
going to and from parties," Petros
said. "Those are the people who re
ally need (rides)." she added.
Cornejo. on the other hand, feels
that weekends are generally safer
because people tend to travel in
groups. I le is most concerned about
women who stay late working at the
librarv and wander across campus
alone to get home.
According to Cornejo, in two
separate incidents last year, a
woman was sexually assaulted walk
ing across Roble field at night and a
man was assaulted by an off-campus
gang. Cornejo added that living on
campus gives some students a false
sense of security.
"We tend to think we're insulated
because the University is removed
from the rest of the city. In reality,
it's very easy for people to come
from off campus," he said.
Cornejo also feels that the size of
the campus exposes more people to
danger because of the vast distances
between buildings.
The size factor applies particular
ly to students with disabilities, espe
cially those on crutches or in wheel
chairs.
Joan Bisagno, assistant dean of
students and director of the Disabil

ity Resource Center, says that the
new disabled-friendly golf cart will
serve as the DisGo Cart operated hy
the Center during the day and as
part of SURE Escort by night.
Bisango is pleased with the new
cart and said that the students are
very happy to have it. "If you're in a
wheelchair, there's a tendency to
feel more vulnerable," she said. "It's
about accessibility for everyone
everywhere, especially in the
evening. It really increases the abili
ty to travel around campus a bit
more quickly."
Stanford currently has 533 regis
tered students with a wide range of
physical and psychological disabili
ties and chronic illnesses such as dia
betes. As to the actual number of
people who would use the service,
Bisango said, "It's not so much
about numbers as about availability
for students, staff, alumni and visi
tors. It expands availability to bring
people to a direct location on cam
pus."
Senior Jessica Lehman, who uses

a wheelchair, was one of the first stu
dents to sit in the new golf cart when
it was first purchased, though she has
not actually used the service yet.
"I think it's wonderful," she said.
"There have been a lot of times in
the past when I wanted to call
SURE, but it was just too difficult
and too complicated."
She described having to follow
the cart in her wheelchair in the past
because her wheelchair would not fit
inside.
"It's good to feel that I and other
students with disabilities have the
same safety and security that other
students have," she said. "It can be a
real problem getting from place to
place because this campus is so
huge."
SURE Escort is run out of the Old
Fire Truck House and receives its
funding from the University. Every
night from dusk until 2 a.m., women
or disabled people who need to reach
a campus destination can call 725-
SIJRE and one of the organization's
golf carts will pick them up.
