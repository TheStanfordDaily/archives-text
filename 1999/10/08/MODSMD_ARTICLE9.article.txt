## House passes HMO bill expanding patient rights 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Responding to
a stream of HMO horror stories, the House
approved bipartisan legislation Thursday
granting new rights to patients, including a
broad ability to sue their health insurance
companies for denying care.
The 275-151 vote marked a striking tri
umph tor congressional Democrats and the
White House, overcoming last-ditch efforts
by GOP leaders to water down the right-to
sue provisions.
In a poignant moment shortly before the
final roll call. Rep. Greg Ganske told the
story of a young boy who lost his arms and
legs to gangrene after his HMO ordered his
parents to drive to a distant emergency room
for treatment of a high fever.
"If he had a finger and you pricked it.it

would bleed. I le's not an anecdote," said the
lowa Republican, while the boy, 7-year-old
James Adams, sat in the front row of the
House chamber playing contentedly.
The measure would guarantee access to
reasonable emergency room care, give
patients the right to see pediatricians and
obstetricians without permission from prima
ry care doctors and require routine care asso
ciated with clinical trials.
Patients who were denied care would be
able to sue instate courts after seeking
redress in an external review process. There
would be no limit on the amount of damages
that could he recovered so long as the patient
adhered to the decision made by the outside
appeals panel.
The vote capped a two-day debate over

health-care access and accountability, and set
the stage for what may be contentious nego
tiations with the Senate on a compromise.
Companion legislation to be rolled into
the compromise talks would create a variety
of new tax breaks for health insurance. That
bill, crafted by the Republican leadership,
cleared the house on Wednesday on a large
ly party-line vote.
For his part. House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-111., struggled unsuccessfully to
head off the most stinging defeat of his nine
month tenure.
Acknowledging the political potency of
the issue, Hastert cautioned that Republi
cans "cannot afford to be held responsible
for killing patient-protection legislation."
In the end, the alternative measure

Republicans pushed to the floor was defeat
ed on a vote of 238-193, with 29 Republicans
rejecting Hastert's pleas.
An even greater number of Republicans,
68, swung behind the bipartisan measure and
helped push it to approval once the GOP
alternative had failed.
Two other alternatives were defeated
during the day.
One, authored by Rep. John Boehner, R-
Ohio, would deny individuals the right to sue
their insurance plans. It fell, 284-145.
The second, proposed by Reps. Amo
Houghton, R-N.Y.. and Lindsey Graham, R-
S.C., was similar to the GOP-backed mea
sure on lawsuits, but closer to the bipartisan
measure on other provisions.
Lawmakers of both parties recited stories

of care inexplicably denied with disastrous
results.
"Some of these horror stories... have res
onated with members" of the House, said
Rep. Ray Lahood, an Illinois Republican.
"It is time we asked the insurance indus
try to be responsible for its actions," said
Norwood, a former dentist and Georgia
Republican who has bucked his leadership
for years in pushing for the legislation.
But critics said that opening insurance
companies up to lawsuits would drive up the
cost of insurance. That, they cautioned,
would lead to rising levels of uninsurance,
rather than better coverage.
"Do we really want to take a chance that
millions of Americans are going to lose their
insurance?" asked Boehner.
