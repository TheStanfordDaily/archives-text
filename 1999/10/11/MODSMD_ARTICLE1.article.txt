# Women's Center extends helping hand
## 'Sisters' program seeks volunteers to give support 
### Meredith Rowe Editorial staff 
Living in a coed dorm environ
ment for the first time is just one of
the challenges many young women
entering college may face.
Hoping to help freshmen and
other female students with this new
situation as well as others, the
Women's Center is coordinating a
new program. Campus Sisters,
which is designed to provide men
toring and advice.
"The goal of this program is to
offer support to women who live in
undergraduate residences," said Fa
bienne McPhail, director of the
Women's Center.
Sophomore Lvdia Poon. one of
the program's coordinators, added
that she hopes Campus Sisters will

address issues of importance to fe
male students.
"Campus Sisters is a community
based network of emotional sup
port," she said. "The goal is to get
women on eampus to feel connected
to other women, as well as to raise
awareness that gender issues, espe
cially in residences, are still very
much a part of the lives of Stanford
students."
Poon said the program has a spe
cific student in mind.
"We're targeting the typical Stan
lord woman who has some problem
which doesn't seem 'big* enough for
more formal channels which current
ly exist — for example, a relationship
problem," she said, "A Campus Sis
ter is sort of a trained, impartial
friend."
McPhail said that the program
evolved out of ideas tossed around
last year by Women's ("enter staffers.
" I lie idea generated out of vision
ary meetings last year about what
women wanted," she said. "It came
Irom a community ol undergrade"
According to Poon, in the past, the
Women's ( enter has been stalled by
students, but typically they were un
able to personally reach their peers
through the tasks they performed.
"Last year it was decided that vol
untecrs were not getting enough in
volvement with the women's com
munity, but were instead answering
phones or cleaning up the ( enter it
self," she said. "The Campus Sisters
program moves the volunteers into
residences or community centers,
where they will likely have a more di
rect impact on Stanford women.
Sophomore Su/.y long said she
would welcome the opportunity to
receive guidance from her peers.
"It would be really nice to have
Campus Sisters in dorms." she said.
"I think freshmen would benefit es
pecially, since they're going through a
lot of life changes. Hopefully, Cam
pus Sisters will be able to act like
friends to those who need them."

Coordinators hope Campus Sis
ters will have a three-part role in a
community, whether it be a dorm/
residence, sorority, ethnic center or
other organization.
Specific duties are to include act
ing as a referral for women in the
community to campus women's orga
nizations, being a liaison between the
community and the Women's Center
and providing mediation and non-de
fensive communication in situations
involving gender and other issues.
"Campus Sisters will be trained in
peer-mediation," McPhail said.
"Also, they'll receive training on how
women support each other in a com
munity."
Training will begin Oct. 15 with a
dinner led by Donnovan Somera of
C owe 11 Student Health Service. Stu
dents interested in training must con
tact program coordinators by today.
McPhail said the program is seek
ing approximately 15 students inter
ested in serving as ( ampus Sisters.
"We encourage first-year students
[to receive training]." she said. "What
we really like and want are women
who feel comfortable about them
selves and being a woman and who
will be at ease supporting others."
"All that we ask for [are students
with| the drive and commitment to
shape this program into something
really exciting." Poon added. "We
welcome anyone interested, especial
ly freshmen."'
Initially, McPhail said, Campus
Sisters will be assigned to residences,
particularly freshman dorms.
( ampus Sisters will play different
pails in dorm life than residence staff
do. McPhail said.
"Certainly. RAs support women
in residences," she said. "So do
PI li s, and the litidge is also a good
place to find support. Hut we want to
institutionalize women in residences
who can provide help in a way that's
both safe and comfortable."
I hose interested in becoming a

coordinator, at eshaw^leland.Stan
