## Senate rejects minority judges Clinton critical of voting 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The volatile mix of ideolo
gy. politics and race has given new prominence to the
long-simmering dispute between the White I louse and
the Republican Senate over confirmation of President
( linton's choices for federal judgeships.
Alter the Senate rejected a black nominee for the fed
eral bench on a strict party-line vote. Clinton called the
action a disgrace. And lie did not let the matter drop. I le
repeated his criticism over the weekend in a speech to a
Hispanic group and cited the case of Richard Paez, a
Mexican-American, nominated for a federal appeals
court vacancy more than three years ago.
"I am deeply dissatisfied with the Senate's partisan
handling of some of my minority nominees." Clinton said
at the annual meeting of the national Hispanic Leader
ship ("on fere nee.
Republicans angrily counter that race has not been a
factor in the holdup of the Paez nomination or the rejec
tion of the nomination of Ronnie White, the first black to
sit on the Missouri Supreme Court, for a federal judge
ship. Nominated by Clinton 27 months ago. White was
turned down 011 a 54-45 vote — all Republicans voting to
reject the nomination and all Democrats supporting it.
White's detractors, led by Missouri's two Republican
senators, argued he was opposed by law enforcement
groups because he had too often dissented on death
penalty rulings.
Missouri law enforcement officers, said Sen. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., "are entitled to judges who will enforce
the law as it is written, and not reach for loopholes that
benefit criminals."
Angry Democrats, however, said Republicans had
distorted White's record on capital punishment. Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota called
it a "dark day"in the Senate. "The vote tells minority
judicial candidates, 'do not apply.' "
The Senate's second-ranked Republican, Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, asked whether Democrats had
applied a "color test" in 1991 when they voted against
Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court.
Democrats have long contended that Republicans use
political stalling tactics to keep Clinton nominees off the
federal bench, and that minority and women nominees
have fared the worst. Republicans respond that trouble
occurs only when Clinton nominates candidates who are
unacceptably liberal.
Democrats cite recent findings by the bipartisan Con
stitution Project that the Senate during the 1997-98 ses
sion took an average 186 days either to accept or reject
white nominees, but 246 days for minorities. Moreover,
the rejection rate was 14 percent for the 92 white, and 35
percent for the 31 minority nominees.
