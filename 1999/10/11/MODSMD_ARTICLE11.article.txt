# Palestinian travel route made safe
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — A safe
passage route for Palestinian travel
between Gaza and the West Bank
was expected to open in a week.
Palestinian and Israeli officials said
Sunday.
The 27-mile passage, allowing
thousands of Palestinians to visit
each other, would lie the most sub
stantive result of the peace process
revived last month by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestini
an leader Yasser Arafat.
Palestinian Civilian Affairs Min
ister Jamil Tarifi said Sunday that
there was only one minor detail
the location of Palestinian-Israeli
liaison offices — to be resolved.
"The route will open on Oct.
17." Tarifi told The Associated
Press.
The spokesman for the Israeli
army's coordinator of activities in
the territories, Shlomo Dror,
agreed that the passage could open
as earlv as Sunday, saying the sides

needed to work out "technical
details."
The Palestinian Authority will
publicize details on the application
process for permits to use the route
in coming days, Tarifi said.
The safe passage was outlined in
the peace agreement signed last
month between Israel and the
Palestinians in the Egyptian resort
of Sharm el-Sheikh. That accord
marked a resumption of the peace
process after it was frozen for much
of the three-year rule of Barak's
predecessor. Benjamin Netanyahu.
In a further sign the agreement
was being implemented, the Israeli
army has begun evacuating bases in
the West Bank to prepare for the
next withdrawal in November
allowing the expansion of Palestini
an self-rule.
On Thursday and Sunday,
reporters witnessed several tractor
trailer trucks hauling away prefab
ricated buildings from two bases in

the West Bank, one near the village
of Tarkumiya and the other six
miles south of the city of Jenin.
When asked to comment, the
Israeli army spokesman would only
say, "the army is preparing for the
completion of the second phase of
the Sharm agreement." The
accord's second phase outlines a full
Israeli withdrawal from two percent
of the West Bank by Nov. 15.
Israeli and Palestinian negotia
tors met late Sunday, apparently to
tackle differences over the accord's
latest sticking point: the release of
151 Palestinian prisoners from
Israeli jails.
Israel was to have freed the pris
oners by Friday under the terms of
the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement.
Israel suspended their release after
Palestinians accused Israel of act
ing in bad faith by selecting prison
ers who would have concluded
their terms in a few months any
wav.
