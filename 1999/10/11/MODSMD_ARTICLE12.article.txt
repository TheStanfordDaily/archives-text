# Boeing criticizes home state's business perks
## 
### 
SPOKANE. Wash. (AP) — If
Washington state doesn't become
more friendly to business. Boeing
may take its future ventures — and
jobs — somewhere else, a top exec
utive of the state's largest private
employer savs.
In blunt words. Debbv Hopkins.
Boeing's chief financial officer, said
Washington doesn't stack up to
most other places where Boeing has
plants. And while Boeing was
founded in Seattle, and its employ
ees love the quality of life there, the
company can't afford to be senti
mental.
"Compared to everywhere else
we do business. Washington is
below average." Hopkins said Fri
day. "To remain a global leader for
aerospace — and a global leader for
other industries — Washington has
to rank a whole lot higher than
that."
She said Washington companies
suffer from high unemployment
taxes, government fees and a lack
of plans to improve education,
infrastructure and promote busi
ness.
Things will only get worse, she
said, if voters approve Initiative
695, a measure on the November
ballot to cut the state's vehicle
excise tax to a flat $30 fee and to
require voter approval of all new
state or local fees or taxes.
Hopkins spoke to the Greater
Seattle Chamber of Commerce's
annual leadership conference in
Spokane. She reminded the audi
ence that at a similar gathering
eight years ago, former Boeing
Chairman Frank Shrontz shook
business and government leaders
with the warning that Pugct Sound
could turn into "an aerospace rust
belt" if they didn't help Boeing stay
competitive.
"There' have been some changes
since Frank Shrontz made that
speech," Hopkins said. "But not

enough."
Hopkins said Boeing wants the
state to be a leading aerospace cen
ter, as well as a global leader in soft
ware. trade, biotechnology, agricul
ture and other business.
"We have deep roots in this
community. But we also have deep
roots elsewhere. We have major
investments in communities like St.
Louis. Southern California, Mesa.
Wichita, HI Paso. Salt Lake City.
Toronto and Brisbane. Australia,
just to name a few."
Hopkins, who joined Boeing last
year, has been leading the compa
ny's effort to improve its profitabil
ity. Although it's unlikely Boeing
would abandon its massive aircraft
assembly plants in the Seattle area,
there are not many incentives to
expand further in the region, she
said.
Boeing employs 2()2,(KH) people
worldwide, with only about 8l.(XX)
in Washington. Because of its
merger with McDonnell Douglas
and acquisition of Rockwell's
aerospace units, it finds itself with
too many underutilized plants, she
said.
In a recent Boeing study on the
cost of doing business. Washington
came out I6th among the 27 states
where Boeing has plants and
employees. Washington only man
aged that rating because of histori
cally low energy rates, Hopkins
said.
"When we look at where to
grow our business, we'll look every
where: around the country, around
the globe." she said.
"We want to grow in Washing
ton. Unfortunately, right now.
Washington isn't a top competitor."
Washington has the fourth-high
est unemployment insurance tax in
the nation, nearly three times the
national average, she said, and
ranks ninth of all 50 states in fees
and assessments on business.
