### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gasoline prices
dipped about half a cent nationwide over the
past two weeks due to a dive in the price of
crude oil. an industry analyst said Sunday.
The weighted average nationwide as of
Friday was $l .3288. down .53 cents per gallon
from a Sept. 24 survey, said Trilby Lundberg,
director of the Lundberg survey of K).(KK)
gasoline stations across the United States.
I he drop in gas prices follows a climb of
more than 14 cents per gallon that started in
early June. Lundberg said. The main reason
for the decrease at the pump was the $4 per
barrel decrease in crude oil price, Lundberg

said.
"Crude oil prices may have risen too fast
and too soon for global demand," Lundberg
said. "Its impossible to say where it will go
from here."
The price for a barrel of crude oil was $25
two weeks ago on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, Lundberg said, but it is now less
than $21 a barrel.
The Lundberg survey showed a national
average price for self service regular unlead
ed gasoline of $1.2777. Mid-grade unleaded
was $1.3756 and premium unleaded was
$1.4602.
