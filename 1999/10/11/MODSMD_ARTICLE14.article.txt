# Angry citizens, police clash in flooded Mexico

VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) — Angry over
sandbagging that has swamped their neighborhoods
anu furious that the government hasn't done more to
help, hundreds of people in Tabasco's Hooded capital
clashed Sunday with police, who beat and arrested
many of them.
President Ernesto Zedillo, who has called the flood
ing Mexico's worst disaster in a decade, toured the
stricken areas on Friday and Saturday and pledged to
send more civilian and military personnel to help the
victims throughout states along the Gulf of Mexico.
"We won't fail you," he promised Saturday.
But in Villahermosa, a city of 465.(KK) people that is
4(H) miles east of Mexico City, many weren't willing to
accept promises. Much of the city has been under water
for a week, and the water was rising on Sunday.
The death toll, according to officials in the affected
states, stood at 333. But hundreds more were missing,
and unofficial counts by local newspapers — based in
part on witness accounts — put the death toll as high as
6(X).
Soldiers dug into mountains of mud that covered vil
lages and towns across the region, searching for the
smell of decaying flesh that would signal a victim near
by. Their work was made harder by fresh storms on
Sunday.
As heavy rains poured across the region, anger
mounted among survivors, who accused the govern
ment of arriving late and making bad decisions.
On Saturday night and again Sunday morning, hun
dreds of Villahermosa residents blocked a highway in
the city's north to protest government-built barriers
that have kept water from pouring into certain areas,
but increased the flooding in others.
Police dragged people by the hair, beat them with
batons and used tear gas in an effort to break up the
demonstration. They arrested at least 100 people,
including eight children and a pregnant woman.
"Instead of helping us, they beat us with sticks.
Why?" said Carmen Arellano, 37.
Most of those arrested were released, but 15 were
charged with damaging federal property — the high
way.
At Villahermosa's state penitentiary, 100 prisoners
staged a small riot Saturday night, shouting from the
prison's roof to reporters outside that the prison was
flooded.
"We're in the middle of water," one screamed. "We
need food and drinking water."
Gunshots were heard inside, and neighbors reported
tear gas, but prison authorities denied any disturbance.
In Teziutlan, where a cliffside cemetery slid down
over a neighborhood and buried dozens of people in
mud. soldiers searched in the rain for more bodies.
Outside the town's cathedral, residents complained
that government help had been late in coming. When
neighbors were pulling bodies from the muck on Tues
day, they said, radio stations were reporting no appar
ent problems in the region. The military, which is lead
ing the rescue effort, didn't arrive until Thursday after
noon.
Many have urged Zedillo to call for foreign aid. but
Zedillo has said: "The Mexicans can do it alone."
Despite his confidence, the relief effort is daunting.
The devastation stretches over such a vast and remote
region that it is difficult for rescuers to get aid to many
affected places. Rain and fog repeatedly have blocked
helicopters from ferrying food and medicine.
