# Gore, Bradley fight for organized labor votes
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
urgent calls to United Food and
Commercial Workers President
Doug Dority came back-to-back
Vice President Al Gore on Friday,
Bill Bradley on Saturday morning.
The candidates' personal appeals
were, other union officials said, pret
ty typical of the last-minute lobbying
over the AFL-CIO endorsement.
Dority's reply to each was just as
typical of the dynamic at work on
the eve of the 13-million-member
labor federation's biennial conven
tion: I will support Al Gore, hut...
"An endorsement a couple of
months from now may be the most
impactful way to proceed." Greg
Denier. Dority's senior assistant,
said late Saturday. "It's a matter of
practical, political consideration that
there has to be some consensus
building and on the question of
early endorsement, obviously
there's not consensus."
On Sunday afternoon, after
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
pressed Gore's case in a private
meeting, the IJFCW board voted
unanimously to endorse Gore. Dor
ity. whose union represents 1.4 mil
lion workers, immediately hit the
phones to lobby fellow union presi
dents.
Presidents of the AFL-ClO's
biggest unions, including the
UFCW, will vote to recommend the

federation's overall endorsement,
which in turn will be decided by all
68 member unions.
Denier explained that the news
media had driven the stakes so high
that UFCW didn't want a "no" vote
to be misinterpreted "as weak sup
port for Gore."
Sounding satisfied. Sweeney said
the votes are moving his way. "More
and more people are realizing that
it's really not early." he told a
reporter.
How did the stakes mount so
high? Interviews with several labor
operatives suggest that Gore.

despite a history of regular attention
to union meetings and conventions,
waited too long to place his calls to
key labor leaders and seal their sup
port. In the meantime. Bradley and
his top operatives — campaign man
ager Gina Glantz and strategist Will
Robinson, both with their own long,
professional ties to organized labor
— aggressively worked the phones.
Bradley's message — "All I'm
asking is that you give me some
time" before going with Gore —
began to stick among labor leaders
not necessarily pro-Bradley but
committed to letting the decision

conic from members not vet focused
on the 2(XX) election.
Now that Bradley is closing in on
— or edging ahead of — Gore in the
key states of New Hampshire and
New York, Gore allies fear another
delay in the AFL-CIO endorsement
would he too big a blow to his
already flagging campaign.
"If Gore wouldn't get it. I think
it would be very, very harmful to
him." acknowledged Gerald McEn
tee. president of the American Fed
eration of State. County and Munic
ipal Employees, and Gore's chief
backer at the convention.
"Bill Bradley and his folks have
worked very hard. If there is an
endorsement, Bradley is hurt, but
not as much," McEntee said.
"Gore's problem, if you were to
ask him and he were to be honest
with you, is that the campaign
underestimated how hard this
(endorsement) would be and sort of
took it for granted," Teamsters
political director Michael Mathis
said.
Gerry Shea, governmental affairs
assistant to Sweeney, said Gore has
gotten a bum rap and, given how
hard he has worked — in the White
House and in Congress before then
— to advance labor interests, should
not have been expected to work so
hard for an endorsement that many
view as inevitable still.
