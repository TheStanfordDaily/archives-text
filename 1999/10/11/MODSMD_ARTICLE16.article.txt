Campus service's
new policy gives little
regard to men

Just recently, SURE Escort, (Stan
ford United for Rape Elimina
tion), a late-night safety service,
announced that it would no longer
offer rides in its golf carts to non-dis
abled men. The rationale is that men's
use of SURE would limit the services
available to women, who are general
ly more vulnerable to rape.
Though designed with the inten
tion of cutting down on the number of
students who abuse SURE by using it
as a "campus taxi service," the new
policy is unfair and ignores the safety
concerns of the entire student popula
tion.
SURE's decision blindly affects all
men without any thought as to the cir
cumstances of each student. It makes
a broad assumption about campus
safety: that onl\ women can be vic
tims of violent crime. Without a
doubt, women are at a considerably
greater risk to be raped, but this
doesn't mean that all men will feel
comfortably safe traveling alone
around such a vast campus at night.
There are those who would suggest
that SURE should only stand as a
campus service for those in danger of
being raped because of the gravity of
the crime and because those were the
principles upon which this service was
founded. However, doesn't anyone
who feels at risk of being a victim of
violent crime deserve the protection
of a University-wide safety service?
Hie leaders of SI JRE should not so
narrowly interpret the organization's
founding history or name as a bound
ary beyond which it can not expand.
All organizations evolve to fully meet
the changing needs of people, and it is

clear that the group's founders were
not only concerned with rape but
safety as a whole.
ITic mission statement on SURE's
Web site itself states that "SURE
Escort's primary goals are to provide
escorts for any member of the Stan
ford community who feels unsafe or
uncomfortable traveling around cam
pus at night." Ilius it seems that the
new policy violates the principles
upon which SURE exists.
Although we assume that SURE
will continue to provide bicycle and
walking escorts to men who feel
unsafe, by doing so the group limits
half the Stanford population to just a
few of its services.
The new policy does very little to
address the real problem facing
SURE these days — namely that too
many students use it only as a form of
quick transportation, especially to
travel to and from parties. As a result,
this becomes a classic case of penaliz
ing an entire community for the
actions of a few "rotten apples."
Instead of such a heavy-handed
approach, SURE should take mea
sures to weed out these "problem
cases" by reiterating the service's
policies and principles at the time of
dispatch and by assessing the situation
on a case-by-case basis.
As a Stanford-funded entity, it is
unclear whether SURE's decision was
reached in a fair and democratic man
ner and whether it is in keeping with
the spirit of openness and accessibility
which this university attempts to pro
mote. Though it is quite appropriate
to fund and target certain programs
solely towards women, it is a bad idea
to exclude certain members of the
population for dubious reasons.
SURE Escort should take all neces
sary steps to ensure that men too can
benefit from this excellent safety ser
vice.
