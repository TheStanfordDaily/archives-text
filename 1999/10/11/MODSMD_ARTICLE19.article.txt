## Stanford's Most Popular Cars 
### 
Govind Dandekar

While exiting my car yesterday, I
became quite annoyed when the
path of my door was obstructed
bv the new BMW 3-series parked next to me.
Luckily, the damage to my door was neg
ligible. The damage done to the BMW was
also minimal: certainly nothing that a brand
new body panel couldn't fix. and I'm sure
that a trained technician could reinstall the
deployed side-impact airbags. As I was pick
ing up shards of its now-shattered passenger
side windows, 1 took a minute to admire the
BMW and some of the other cars in the
parking lot.
I quickly realized that the face of a park
ing lot at Stanford is much different then the
face of any other parking lot. It is certainly a
far cry from the parking lots that many of us
became accustomed to in high school. At my
public school in lowa, most students were
happy if they could somehow purchase a
pickup truck complemented with a fully
loaded l()-gauge shotgun. In fact, anything
technically advanced enough to be referred
to as a "horseless carriage" would draw the
admiration and envy of classmates.
But things arc very different at Stanford,
and I took it upon myself to informally sur
vey the cars we drive. I extinguished the
engine block of the BMW, which was sud
denly engulfed in flames, and took a quick
drive around the residence parking lots.
After keen observation and some quick
polling, I have determined what are,
amongst Stanford students, the five most
popular cars and why we purchase them. My
results are as follows:

No. 1: The Acura "my parents gave me
$20,(XX) to buy a car" Integra, usually paint
ed white or black. Nothing screams sophisti
cation like the Integra. This car combines the
pleasant aesthetics of a vending machine, the
handling and mobility of a beached aircraft
carrier and the safety and flame retardance
of refined kerosene. The only way to
improve this fine vehicle is by slapping some
gold rims on the wheels, lowering the body
frame and plastering the word "ACURA" in
big white letters across the front of the wind
shield. If you can actually see the road ahead
of you, your "ACURA" decal is too small
and transparent.
No. 2: The Jeep Qrand Cherokee. You go
to Tahoe to ski once or twice a year. Thus,
you absolutely require the rugged engineer
ing and off-road capability of this vehicle.
Indeed, the streets of the Bay Area and
Tahoe are littered with children, homeless
people and Acura Integras. The handling
and design of the Cherokee allows you to
drive over them with little discomfort or jar
ring. Also, the '99 Cherokee is now environ
mentally friendly. Although it can still be
considered a "pointless gas guzzler," it
should be noted that its new aluminum
engine no longer emits Sarin gas. Please feel
free to park your Jeep in any one of Palo
Alto's numerous "compact" car spots.
No. 3: The Ford Mustang. On your 16th
birthday, your parents let you pick any car
you wanted to. Your top three choices were
the 1) Ford Mustang, 2) Toyota RAV4 and
3) Volkswagen Cabriolet. You should thank
God that you chose the Mustang. Imagine

how ridiculous you would look traveling
around campus in a RAV4 or Cabriolet. In
order to make your Mustang look sportier,
you should slap an enormous "ACURA"
decal across its windshield.
No. 4: The BMW 3-Series. There are
three common ways to acquire this highly
sought-after vehicle: 1) steal it, 2) have a
brother who is recruited by a corrupt college
football team or 3) sell your soul to the devil.
If you think about it, choices No. 1 and No. 2
arc just different versions of choice No. 3.
No. 5: Some piece of French trash (a
Merkur, Renault, or Peugeot). You talked to
your friends, you drove all the cars, and you
committed Consumer Reports to memory.
After much thought and introspection, you
decided that American cars were too practi
cal. Japanese cars were too reliable and Ger
man cars were too sporty. So you turned to
the same country that designed the Maginot
Line and foisted Quebec and Gerard Depar
dieu upon the world. You bought a French
car, and now you must live with that deci
sion. If you own a French car, please refrain
from parking near my vehicle. Any exposure
to such an unfortunate car would substan
tially decrease the ultimate resale value of
my horseless carriage.
God help us all if the Mitsubishi Eclipse
ever makes this list.
