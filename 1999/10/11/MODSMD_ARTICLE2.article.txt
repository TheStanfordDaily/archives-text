### Nadira Hira Contributing writer 
Freshman Meghana Reddy has been
to India many times, but the next time
will be different.
"My family is from I lyderabad. and I
have visited there often, but I have
never even considered the political and
gender issues in my hometown." she
said.
Roddy said her view was changed b\
what she heard in ;Â»lecture bv renowned
feminist scholar K. Lalita last Thursday
morning.
"My grandmother and Lalita are the
same age and from the same area and
yet. while my grandmother devotes her
time to domestic chores and upholding

old conservative Indian tradition. Lalita
is activeh seeking to change archaic In
dian views about women and their abili
ties." Reddy said. "Lalita's efforts are so
admirable because they themselves defy
rigid Indian beliefs of what women
should be."
This was the general view of students
who attended Lalita's guest lecture in
Modern India: History, Society, and
Cultures (Cultural and Social Anthro
pology 075. History IN6A). which is
taught bv History Prof. Mark Mancall
and Cultural and Social Anthropology
Assoc. Prof. Akhil Gupta. Approxi
mately 20 students not taking the class
attended the lecture ;is well.
""As a new student ;it Stanford. I saw
I .alita's presentation as a great example

of what I had hoped to encounter during
my four years here," said freshman
Leela Ruth Young. "It is one thing to
read a book, but something truly won
derful to have access to someone who
can bring such an interesting perspec
tive to what you're studying."
Lalita spoke on a variety of women's
issues, addressing the changing role of
women in India with respect to culture
and polities. Throughout her lecture,
she used specific examples, generally
stories, to illustrate her points about the
importance of activism and the way that
Indian women have been activists.
The daughter of a South Indian polit
ical activist. Lalita was raised in a tradi
tion of activism. After attending college
in India and studying political science.

she ;iml live classmates began the first
feminist group in Hyderabad, the Pro
gressive Organization of Women, in
1973. Their first high-profile campaign
surrounded the issue of dowry and at
tracted many women to their cause.
She later became involved in radical
Indian politics and. as a result, was im
prisoned when Indira Gandhi declared
a state of emergency in June 1975. She
and others involved with radical leftist
movements remained in prison until
March 1977, when (iandhi called gener
al elections and lost her seat.
Lalita went on to co-author "We
Were Making History: Life Stories of
Women 111 the felengana People's
Struggle," a five-year project docu
menting oral histories of Indian
women.
She also co-edited two volumes
of "Women Writing in India: 600
B.C. to the Present," the first in
1991 and the second in 1993.
Students will be reading one of
these volumes in the Modern India
course.
"It's a very impressive body of
writing that was put together mas

terfully," Gupta said.
Additionally. Lalita established
a center for women's studies at C )s
-mania University in Hyderabad,
where she was director for more
than 10 years before resigning.
She is still very much involved in
activities at the center.
In addition to her scheduled lec
ture. L.alita met with several inter
ested students Friday morning to
discuss her work in further detail.
Freshman Sumir Meghani said
of this meeting. "I thought the clis
cussion provided excellent per
spective and allowed for a multi

tude of issues to be brought up,"
one of which was the success of the
women's movement thus far and
Lalita's hopes for the future.
"In 20 years, I think we've com
pletely changed the whole scene,"
Lalita said. "These are the kind of
politics that change things subtly
over time, but suddenly become
visible and allow you to see how so
much has changed.
"I am hopeful about the future.
The younger generation doesn't
have to light the battles we did.
Now. they can take those things for
granted."
