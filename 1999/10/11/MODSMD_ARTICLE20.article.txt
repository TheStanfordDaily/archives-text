Dining halls do differ in
quality
Rati I ahcrian's statement in the Oct. K
issue of The Daily that "no difference in
quality or variety exists between the dining
halls other than the presentation and atmo
sphere'' is about as believable as a headline
from [the humor publication) The Onion. In
fact, I would like to know I ahcrian's defini
tions of "quality" and "variety."
I lived at Stern last year but frequently
ate at Wilbur, especially during spring quar
ter. I preferred the "atmosphere" of Stern
South s dining area to Wilbur's school-cafe
teria set up (not to mention the invading
blackbirds that once used my plate for tar
get practice), but the "food" served at Stern
last year was reason enough to head over to
Wilbur.
What was so bad about Stern? Soggy
pasta, undercooked poultry, beef dishes
containing more gristle than meat and
moldy cheese in the salad bar on at least one
occasion. And, no, it wasn't bleu cheese
they were serving that night. Add to that
many mornings without hot chocolate,
many evenings without soft serve and a bot
tom-of-the-barrel salad bar, all for the per
fectly reasonable price of $21 a day. $ l )
could get you a decent dinner even on Uni
versity Avenue, but at Stern we were fre
quently served meals that were simply bad.
Wilbur's cuisine wasn't always rcstau

rant-quality either, but it was a large step up
from Stern food. This year I am eating in
Florence Moore Hall, which is definitely
leagues above Stern or Wilbur in terms of
"quality and variety." Imagine a beef que
sadilla where the filling isn't 60% fat, a salad
bar that has different "fixings" every day
and a continental breakfast that serves both
donuts and muffins on the same day.
Now, I understand that there are difficul
ties in pleasing the large variety of people
that eat in a dining hall, and I shouldn't
expect hot chocolate every morning when I
don't even get it at home. However, if one
dining hall can produce pleasant-tasting
meals while another apparently can't except
on Faculty Night, despite students being
charged the same prices f6r their meals,
something is seriously wrong with Dining
Services. No one paying Stanford prices
should be expected to eat the kind of things
Stern served up last year, especially the
freshmen who hadn't any choice in which
dormitory they landed.

Graduate Student Council
reaching out to students
Thank you for your article dated Fri
day, Oct. 8 on the ethnic centers at Stan
ford. As the story revealed, each of the

centers is actively providing programming
that focuses on their respective communi
ties.
We would like to draw your attention
to a Welcome Party for all graduate stu
dents on Friday, Oct. 15 at Hacienda Com
mons in Rains House.
This Welcome Party is just part of the
Graduate Student Council's continuing
efforts to reach out to students of color,
international students and women from
Stanford's graduate student community.
These efforts have also involved attending
orientation activities as well as providing
continued financial assistance to a wide
variety of graduate student groups. In
addition, we have been pleased to have
had the participation of several members
of the ethnic centers and the Graduate
Women's Network (GWN) coordinators
at our weekly meetings.
We will continue to seek effective
means to reach out to these communities,
to represent their interests and to be
activists for and with them.
We welcome the input of all graduate
students and others on how best to do so.
We look forward to seeing all graduate
students, their partners, and families at the
party on Friday.

SURE Escort's policy long
overdue
It is called Stanford United Rape Elini
ination for good reason. Rape is a very
real danger for all women — yes, even on
the Farm. Sadly it is a danger that many
would like to downplay or disregard alto
gether. Anyone who argues against SURE
Escort's new policy is trivializing the real
ity that is a woman's life.
There is nothing wrong with a campus
service that exists to recognize and priori
tize the needs of women. This is not to say
that men do not face the possibility of dan
gerous situations on campus. Nonetheless,
the purpose of SURE Escort is to prevent
rape — predominately a female issue —
not to provide free rides for party-goers.
SURE Escort's new policy provides
women on campus a more efficient and
secure means of ensuring their personal
safety.
It is time the rest of us follow SURE's
lead and stop making excuses for why
women's safety cannot come first. Mr.
Cornejo obviously understands the needs
of women and I support his new policy for
SURE Escort. I think anyone who has any
concern for the safety of women on this
campus should do the same.
