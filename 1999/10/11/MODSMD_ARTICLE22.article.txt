In an effort to focus on an area
that Stanford has not emphasized in
the past, the Religious Studies De
partment's annual symposium on
Asian religions dealt with South
Asian religions for the first time.
The event reflects a "rising wave
of interest" in South Asia at Stan
lord. which has traditionally focused
on East Asian religions, according to
conference organizer and visiting
Assistant Prof, of Religious Studies
Linda I less.
Staged at the Haas Center for
Public Service, the symposium was
entitled, "Religions of Early India:
Interactions." About KM) people at
tended this weekend's conference,
which brought together eight promi
nent scholars of the I linduism. Bud
dhism and Jainism religions.
Although the conference was
open to the public, most attendees
were faculty and graduate students.
The conference explored how
these three religions, usually studied
separately from one another,
"touched, overlapped and influ
enced" each other in India, I less ex
plained.
Bernard Faure, professor of Reli
gious Studies, emphasized the need
to "place Buddhism in an Indian cul
tural context."
The scholars read published and
unpublished works, including "Re
visions of I lell and Moral Responsi
bility: The Interaction Between

Early Buddhist and Hindu Talcs,"
by Wendy Donigerof the University
of Chicago and "States of Happiness
in Buddhist Heterodoxy," bv F.S.

Jaini of UC-Berkeley.
This was a "heavy-duty academic
conversation," I less said.
Scholars also included faculty

and graduate students from Stan
