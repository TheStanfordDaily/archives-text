In an effort to focus on an area
that Stanford has not emphasized in
the past, the Religious Studies De
partment's annual symposium on
Asian religions dealt with South
Asian religions for the first time.
The event reflects a "rising wave
of interest" in South Asia at Stan
lord. which has traditionally focused
on East Asian religions, according to
conference organizer and visiting
Assistant Prof, of Religious Studies
Linda I less.
Staged at the Haas Center for
Public Service, the symposium was
entitled, "Religions of Early India:
Interactions." About KM) people at
tended this weekend's conference,
which brought together eight promi
nent scholars of the I linduism. Bud
dhism and Jainism religions.
Although the conference was
open to the public, most attendees
were faculty and graduate students.
The conference explored how
these three religions, usually studied
separately from one another,
"touched, overlapped and influ
enced" each other in India, I less ex
plained.
Bernard Faure, professor of Reli
gious Studies, emphasized the need
to "place Buddhism in an Indian cul
tural context."
The scholars read published and
unpublished works, including "Re
visions of I lell and Moral Responsi
bility: The Interaction Between

Early Buddhist and Hindu Talcs,"
by Wendy Donigerof the University
of Chicago and "States of Happiness
in Buddhist Heterodoxy," bv F.S.

Jaini of UC-Berkeley.
This was a "heavy-duty academic
conversation," I less said.
Scholars also included faculty

Religious Studies doctoral stu

saw the conference as a way to "get
access to the scholarship" which is
lacking at Stanford.
Traditionally. Stanford's Reli

rather than South Asian.
"Stanford has neglected South
Asia for all of Stanford's history."
I less said.
Hess, who has been teaching In
dian religions at Stanford for four
years, is visiting from Berkeley,
which she said has a stronger South
Asian program.
Stanford's increasing emphasis
on South Asian religions includes
the hiring of Schopen, who is ex
pected to be a new faculty member
at Stanford in fall 2000.
Schopen. currently a professor of

I-.iist Asian Language and Culture at
IJCLA and a specialist in Indian
Buddhism, said "Stanford is playing
catch-up" in Indian religious stud
ies.
()ther efforts on campus include
the South Asian Studies Initiative, a
group of students and faculty, which
is planning programming to attract
attention to South Asian studies and
to begin building a department in
this area.
"Until now," said Faure, "Indian
culture and religions fell through the
cracks. It is important to redress this
picture."
