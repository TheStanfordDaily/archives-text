# Horton hatches a custody case
## Law speaker uses Dr. Seuss tale to illustrate issues 
### Andrea Chen 
With the help of Dr. Seuss's book,
"Morton Hatches an Egg," Stanford
Law School alumna and former Law
Prof. lx)is Weithom led the introduc
tory session that kicked off the Law
School's Family Series for a
small audience on Friday.
An article she read last year in
spired Weithom to use the Dr. Seuss
book as a teaching tcx>l.
"I decided to experiment one se
mester and see what legal theories
would support the cases. It worked
out well and it was fun," she said.
"Horton Hatches an Egg" con
cerns an elephant named Horton
who helps a lazy bird named Mayzie
hatch her egg. Horton survives harsh
weather conditions, hunters and hu
miliation while he sits on the egg that
Mayzie should have been attending
to.
Meanwhile. Mayzie goes on a va
cation to Palm Beach. In the end, an
elephant bird hatches, and the ques
tion arises: to whom does the ele
phant hird belong?
While on the surface, family law
issues may not seem to have much to
do with elephants that hatch bird
eggs, Weithom said the story is actu
ally about a legal contest between
I lorton and Mayzie.
Weithorn presented different
theories that apply to questions con
cerning the true parents of a child and
how to gain custody of a child or
maintain a legally protected relation
ship with a child.
In closing, Weithorn posed the
question, "What is the message Dr.
Seuss is trying to say about the con
ception of family?"
Perhaps, audience participants
concluded, he is trying to say that the
notion of family should be redefined
or that unconventional parents can

be good parents too.
"I had the most fun in Prof. Wei
thorn's class last year." said second
year law student Cheryl Mandala.
"It's a nice change but it gets many of
the sophisticated issues."
"[Exploring Legal Concepts of
Family) was a really good way to start
the series, and it laid down a good
foundation to discuss the issues in
family law," said first-year law stu
dent Janet Goode.
Weithorn said she first got the
idea to use Dr. Seuss's book after she

read an article by Barbara Bennett
Woodhouse. who also used the book
to discuss family issues.
The planned series is the brain
child of Michael Chu and Katherine
Keating, both students at the Law
School.
C'hu and Keating first heard Wei
thorn use Dr. Seuss in a family law
lecture at Stanford last year and de
cided to organize the series, which is
open to anyone.
