## Water polo takes third at NorCal Tournament 
### Erin Bouchier Contributing writer 
Without a doubt, this weekend's
NorCal tournament made good on its
promise to showcase the very best in

collegiate water polo competition.
I.ucky Cardinal tans watched four in
credible games played by No. 2 Stan
ford (11-2).
Hut unfortunately for the Cardinal
squad and its fans. Stanford came out

on the wrong end of a semifinal over
time battle against USC, squandering
its chance for a place in the finals.
However. Stanford bounced back in
its last game against California and
garnered third place in the tourna

ment.
Wins Saturday over UC-Santa
Crux and IJC-San Diego advanced
the Cardinal to Sunday's semifinals
and set up a rematch with No. 3 and
defending NCAA champion USC.

The last three games between Stan
ford and USC had gone into over
time. In the 1998 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament semi
finals, the Cardinal handed the Tro
jans a 7-6 loss in sudden-death over
time. Two weeks later, in the NCAA
Championship final, USC turned the
tables, beating Stanford 9-8 in over
time. And in the final of September's
SoCal tournament, Stanford defeat
ed the then-No. 1 Trojans by a score
of 11-10 in double overtime.

■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford finish
es third at NorCal Tournament.

So it wasn't at all surprising when
the winner of Sunday's game couldn't
be determined in regulation. And it
wasn't surprising that this would be a
game for the ages.
It was a back-and-forth game the
whole way. In the first period, each
team managed one goal a piece on
man-up opportunities. In the second
quarter, both teams heated up. After
goals by the Trojans' Allen Basso and
Cardinal senior Brian Heifferon to
knot the game at two, Stanford got its
first lead of the game, 3-2, off another
goal by Heifferon. But the Trojans
came right back, tying the game on a
goal by Jeff Larson and then going
ahead after a two-point goal by Steve
O'Rourke, making the score 5-3 at
the half.
Stanford battled back in the third
period. After two blocked shots on a
Cardinal 6-on-5 chance, senior Andy
Walburger pushed the ball past the
goalie to make the score 5-4. Fresh
man Jeff Nesmith then tied the game

on a goal on another man-up oppor
tunity. But just seconds later the mo
mentum swung back to the Trojans as
O'Rourke put in his second two
pointer, giving USC a 7-5 lead after
three quarters.
ITie fourth period kept fans on the
edges of their seats. After a goal by
Heifferon to narrow USC's lead to
one, redshirt sophomore Pasi Dutton
scored a two-point goal, invigorating
the crowd and giving Stanford its sec
ond lead of the game, 8-7. Moments
later, Heifferon was handed a 30-sec
ond kickout by the referee. As the
crowd booed. Trojan Daniel Lontay
scored on the man-up opportunity,
again tying the game.
Stanford responded with a goal by
Nesmith on a 6-on-5, putting the Car
dinal up by one. The Stanford de
fense clamped down for the next few
possessions. But with four seconds to
go, the Trojans scored from the hole,
sending the game into overtime with
many Stanford fans calling for a push
off.
In the first overtime, Stanford
scored on a 6-on-5 goal by senior
Jonathan Skaalen and held the Tro
jans scoreless with the help of two of
goalie Nick Ellis's 13 saves on the
game. In the second overtime period.
USC tied the score with one minute,
15 seconds to go on a 6-on-5. On their
next possession, the Trojans stole the
ball and Basso hit a two-point shot to
give USC the 12-10 victory.
Although it was a heartbreaking
loss for the Cardinal, head coach
Dante Dettamanti felt it was a great
game and remarked, "If we played

Without a doubt, this weekend's
NorCal tournament made good on its
promise to showcase the very best in

collegiate water polo competition.
I.ucky Cardinal tans watched four in
credible games played by No. 2 Stan
ford (11-2).
Hut unfortunately for the Cardinal
squad and its fans. Stanford came out

on the wrong end of a semifinal over
time battle against USC, squandering
its chance for a place in the finals.
However. Stanford bounced back in
its last game against California and
garnered third place in the tourna

ment.
Wins Saturday over UC-Santa
Crux and IJC-San Diego advanced
the Cardinal to Sunday's semifinals
and set up a rematch with No. 3 and
defending NCAA champion USC.

The last three games between Stan
ford and USC had gone into over
time. In the 1998 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament semi
finals, the Cardinal handed the Tro
jans a 7-6 loss in sudden-death over
time. Two weeks later, in the NCAA
Championship final, USC turned the
tables, beating Stanford 9-8 in over
time. And in the final of September's
SoCal tournament, Stanford defeat
ed the then-No. 1 Trojans by a score
of 11-10 in double overtime.

■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford finish
es third at NorCal Tournament.

So it wasn't at all surprising when
the winner of Sunday's game couldn't
be determined in regulation. And it
wasn't surprising that this would be a
game for the ages.
It was a back-and-forth game the
whole way. In the first period, each
team managed one goal a piece on
man-up opportunities. In the second
quarter, both teams heated up. After
goals by the Trojans' Allen Basso and
Cardinal senior Brian Heifferon to
knot the game at two, Stanford got its
first lead of the game, 3-2, off another
goal by Heifferon. But the Trojans
came right back, tying the game on a
goal by Jeff Larson and then going
ahead after a two-point goal by Steve
O'Rourke, making the score 5-3 at
the half.
Stanford battled back in the third
period. After two blocked shots on a
Cardinal 6-on-5 chance, senior Andy
Walburger pushed the ball past the
goalie to make the score 5-4. Fresh
man Jeff Nesmith then tied the game

on a goal on another man-up oppor
tunity. But just seconds later the mo
mentum swung back to the Trojans as
