# Cardinal suffers first Pac -10 loss
## Stanford splits two against UCLA, USC 
### Emily Cadei Contributing writer 
A split of its two-game series was
not exactly what the No. 6 Stanford
women's volleyball team had in
mind when it headed down to
Southern California this past week
end.
It knew, however, that going
head-to-head against the two other
Pacific 10 Conference powers
would be a measuring stick for the
team's current level of plav. and
that's exactly what it proved to be.

■ Thursday: No. 9 UCLA (13-1. 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference) del'. No. 6
Stanford (12-2,6-1). 15-8. 15-9.9-15.
15-3.
■ Friday: Stanford def. No. 17 USC
(8-4.3-2). 15-8,15-6.15-9.

A tough loss at the hands of No.
9 UCLA (13-1. 5-0 Pac-10), 15-8,
15-9,9-15. 15-3, and decisive victory
over No. 17 USC (8-4. 3-2) illus
trates that, while the Cardinal (12-2,
6-1) has some things to work on if it
hopes to contend lor the national
championship, the team's heart is
not in doubt.
Both Stanford and UCLA en
tered the game Thursday night
sporting 10-game winning streaks,
but at the end of the evening one of
those strings was going to be bro
ken.
In a battle between the two un
beaten teams in the Pac-10, one ex
pected a nail-biting contest, but
contrary to expectation, the ( ardi
nal let things slip away early, falling
to the Bruins in the lirst two games.
After rallying in the third game,
Stanford fell apart in the fourth as
UCLA wrapped up the match and
took over sole possession ol first
place in the Pac-10.
T he Bruins' victory can be attrib
uted in large part to their domina
tion of the net. where they held an
advantage of 12 blocks to Stanford s
five. UCLA alsoouthit the Cardinal
.293 to. 178.
Sophomore outside hitter Kris
tee Porter paced the Bruins with a

match-high 21 kills and a .400 hit
ting, percentage. Her supporting
cast included senior middle block
er / outside hitter Tamika Johnson,
who had 13 kills, and sophomore
outside hitter Ashley Bowles, who
contributed 12 kills and 12 digs.
Freshman Lauren llendrick ;ilso
saw significant action, tallying 11
kills, while sophomore setter Frika
Selsor had a match high 54 assists
lor the Bruins.
Stanford senior middle
blocker / outside hitter Kerri Walsh
led the Cardinal with 14 kills in the
losing effort. Sophomore middle
blocker Tara Conrad and freshman
outside hitter Logan lom also had
solid outings, with 12 and II kills,
respectively. Juniors Lindsay Ka
gawa and Robyn Lewis split time at
the setter position.
Afterward. Conrad assessed the
loss to the Bruins as an issue of
"coming out flat." But overall she
explained that the team could take a
lot from the loss because "it was a
game that exposed our weakness
es." including "an overall lack of
team flow and playing tense, which
caused errors."
After the disappointing loss at
Pauley Pavilion, it would not have
been a surprise if Stanford had
come out a little lackluster in its
game against USC the following
night. Instead, the Cardinal re
bounded admirably by defeating
the Trojans in straight games. 15-« S.
15-6. 15-9. The win. the team's 11th
in its past 12 matches, was especial
ly satisfying both because it came
after the defeat by UCLA and be
cause it exacted revenge on the Tro
jans for their win against Stanford in
the regular-season finale last year.
The Cardinal came out extreme
ly focused, not about to let a slow
start lose the game like the night be
fore. The Stanford women domi
nated the first two games before
momentarily losing their intensity
in game three. The Trojans rallied
to lead the Cardinal 7-6 midway
through the third game before Stan
ford regained control to close out
the match and win its 14th overall in
the 15 times the two teams have
met.
Tom led Stanford with 18 kills
and a .351 hitting percentage.
Walsh also turned in a stellar per
formance with nine kills, four
blocks and 13 digs, pushing her all
time stats to just one block and four
digs shy of ranking No. 5 on both
Stanford career lists. Kagawa
played the entire match at setter,
contributing 41 assists.
The Trojans were led by junior
outside hitter Kashi Cormier and
sophomore Jennifer Pahl with 10
kills each.
Stanford execution was excel
lent against USC, as is evident from
the fact that the Cardinal had seven
players hit above .350 on the night:
Jennifer Detmer (l.(XX)), Conrad
(.538), Lindsey Yamasaki (.500),
Walsh (.412), Kagawa (.400), Sara
Sandrik (.353) and Tom (.351).
Stanford also had 52 kills and just 15
errors in 110 total attempts in hit
ting .336 as a team, the eighth time
this season the team has hit .300 or
better.
Conrad summed up the team's
approach to the game against the
Trojans, stating, "We were upset
about our loss to UCLA and that
gave us extra motivation heading
into the next game." The UCLA
loss also help the team adjust its
mindset for the Trojans. "We just
tried to play more relaxed and more
together."
The road-weary Stanford team
will be happy to embark on a pro
longed homestand for the next two
weeks, as it will try to apply some of
the lessons it learned down South.
The Cardinal women will take
on Arizona and Arizona State this
Thursday and Friday, respectively,
before hosting No. 3 Pacific and
Bay-Area rival California the fol
lowing week.

The Stanford women's volleyball team defeated (JSC after falling to UCLA this weekend.
Junior Lindsay Kagawa played setter for the entire match against the Trojans, which
Stanford won in straight sets.
A split of its two-game series was
not exactly what the No. 6 Stanford
women's volleyball team had in
mind when it headed down to
Southern California this past week
end.
It knew, however, that going
head-to-head against the two other
Pacific 10 Conference powers
would be a measuring stick for the
team's current level of plav. and
that's exactly what it proved to be.

■ Friday: Stanford def. No. 17 USC

A tough loss at the hands of No.
9 UCLA (13-1. 5-0 Pac-10), 15-8,
15-9,9-15. 15-3, and decisive victory
over No. 17 USC (8-4. 3-2) illus
trates that, while the Cardinal (12-2,
6-1) has some things to work on if it
hopes to contend lor the national
championship, the team's heart is
not in doubt.
Both Stanford and UCLA en
tered the game Thursday night
sporting 10-game winning streaks,
but at the end of the evening one of
those strings was going to be bro
ken.
In a battle between the two un
beaten teams in the Pac-10, one ex
pected a nail-biting contest, but
contrary to expectation, the ( ardi
nal let things slip away early, falling
to the Bruins in the lirst two games.
After rallying in the third game,
Stanford fell apart in the fourth as
UCLA wrapped up the match and
took over sole possession ol first
place in the Pac-10.
T he Bruins' victory can be attrib
uted in large part to their domina
tion of the net. where they held an
advantage of 12 blocks to Stanford s
five. UCLA alsoouthit the Cardinal
.293 to. 178.
Sophomore outside hitter Kris
tee Porter paced the Bruins with a

match-high 21 kills and a .400 hit
ting, percentage. Her supporting
cast included senior middle block
er / outside hitter Tamika Johnson,
who had 13 kills, and sophomore
outside hitter Ashley Bowles, who
contributed 12 kills and 12 digs.
Freshman Lauren llendrick ;ilso
saw significant action, tallying 11
kills, while sophomore setter Frika
Selsor had a match high 54 assists
lor the Bruins.
Stanford senior middle
blocker / outside hitter Kerri Walsh
led the Cardinal with 14 kills in the
losing effort. Sophomore middle
blocker Tara Conrad and freshman
outside hitter Logan lom also had
solid outings, with 12 and II kills,
respectively. Juniors Lindsay Ka
gawa and Robyn Lewis split time at
the setter position.
Afterward. Conrad assessed the
loss to the Bruins as an issue of
"coming out flat." But overall she
explained that the team could take a
lot from the loss because "it was a
game that exposed our weakness
es." including "an overall lack of
team flow and playing tense, which
caused errors."
After the disappointing loss at
Pauley Pavilion, it would not have
been a surprise if Stanford had
come out a little lackluster in its
game against USC the following
night. Instead, the Cardinal re
bounded admirably by defeating
the Trojans in straight games. 15-« S.
15-6. 15-9. The win. the team's 11th
in its past 12 matches, was especial
ly satisfying both because it came
after the defeat by UCLA and be
cause it exacted revenge on the Tro
jans for their win against Stanford in
the regular-season finale last year.
The Cardinal came out extreme
ly focused, not about to let a slow
start lose the game like the night be
fore. The Stanford women domi
nated the first two games before
momentarily losing their intensity
in game three. The Trojans rallied
to lead the Cardinal 7-6 midway
through the third game before Stan
ford regained control to close out
the match and win its 14th overall in
the 15 times the two teams have
met.
Tom led Stanford with 18 kills
and a .351 hitting percentage.
Walsh also turned in a stellar per
formance with nine kills, four
blocks and 13 digs, pushing her all
time stats to just one block and four
digs shy of ranking No. 5 on both
Stanford career lists. Kagawa
played the entire match at setter,
contributing 41 assists.
The Trojans were led by junior
outside hitter Kashi Cormier and
sophomore Jennifer Pahl with 10
kills each.
Stanford execution was excel
lent against USC, as is evident from
the fact that the Cardinal had seven
players hit above .350 on the night:
Jennifer Detmer (l.(XX)), Conrad
(.538), Lindsey Yamasaki (.500),
Walsh (.412), Kagawa (.400), Sara
Sandrik (.353) and Tom (.351).
Stanford also had 52 kills and just 15
errors in 110 total attempts in hit
ting .336 as a team, the eighth time
this season the team has hit .300 or
better.
Conrad summed up the team's
approach to the game against the
Trojans, stating, "We were upset
about our loss to UCLA and that
gave us extra motivation heading
into the next game." The UCLA
loss also help the team adjust its
mindset for the Trojans. "We just
tried to play more relaxed and more
together."
The road-weary Stanford team
will be happy to embark on a pro
longed homestand for the next two
weeks, as it will try to apply some of
the lessons it learned down South.
The Cardinal women will take
on Arizona and Arizona State this
Thursday and Friday, respectively,
before hosting No. 3 Pacific and
