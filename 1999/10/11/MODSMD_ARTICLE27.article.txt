WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY
■ Saturday: Stanford finishes second
at Long Beach Invitational.

"Il needs a lot of work. There are a
lot olthings that need to get fixed up."
I .ananna said.
Fortunately, he was commenting
on the conditions of the 5.000-meter
course that will be used for the Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championships on
Oct. 30 and not his top-ranked cross
country squad.
Though the team was defeated for
the first time this season, its perfor

mance demonstrated a completeness
in sharp contrast to the poor looting
of the course that Lananna was con
cerned with. Leaving the team's best
runners at home, a Stanford "B"
team showed it can still compete at a
very high level, finishing second to a
full-strength IJCLA squad, the No.
l l ) team in the country, by a score of
34-57.
"It was good. To come up just a
few points short of IJCLA with the
group we brought down there is not
bad," 1 .ananna said. "I think that our
women are a little bit tired coming off
the [Stanford| Invitational and a
rough week of training, but for the
most part it was good."
lops among the Cardinal was
fifth-place Mary Huang in a time of
17 minutes. 4Kseconds. 20seconds off
winner Elaine Canchola of UCLA.
Huang, a senior, established herself
early on the flat, looping course and
led through the half-way point.
"She went out real hard and took

a commanding lead," Lananna said.
"She kind of got reeled in at the end,
but she did a good job and [senior)
Shaluinn [Fullove] and [freshman]
Katie Bri/.gys did a good job too."
For Huang, the Cardinal's fifth
runner at nationals last year, and
Fullove, second across the line for
Stanford in ninth place (17:59), the
race was especially important for
their chances in participating in the
upcoming championship season.
"It's really important for me [to
race in the championship season] be
cause I feel like I've worked really
hard this summer and this whole year
and I have some goals that won't be
accomplished if I don't go on,"
Huang said. "1 have some goals for
Nationals because I competed there
last year and I want to improve upon
my performance from last year."
With strong performances, they
left the pressure on Lananna to de
cide whether they should be included
or not.

"It doesn't make decisions more
complicated. It's what we want,"
Lananna said. "We wanted to have a
lot of people in the mix that are in a
position to really do a good job and be
factors at the end of the season. It's
very good actually."
The Cardinal's scorers were
rounded out with Brizgys' 1 lth-place
finish, followed by Anne Gunnison in
13th and Colleen Flaherty in 21st.
The third-place team, Fila Track
West, tallied 68 points.
Lananna did not send a men's
team to Long Beach, although four
competed at the San Francisco State
Invitational at Golden Gate Park on
Saturday. David Abril. Michael
Devine and Nate Stoll finished third,
fourth and fifth, respectively, but be
cause they lacked a fifth man. the
Cardinal did not count in team scor
ing. Abril's time of 26:39 was 18 sec
onds behind Erik Mencarini of
Sacramento State for the B,(XX)-mcter
course.
