# Many committee positions empty
## Panel seeks student judges for empty spot 
### Sarah Heim 
Despite the abundance of go-getters around cam
pus, there are still many valuable opportunities lor stu
dents to make a difference on University committees
this year, according to Kristin Torres, chair of the
ASSU's Nominations Committee.
A number of University committees, including the
Judicial Panel Pool, still have undergraduate and grad
uate student spots to fill.
The Nominations Committee, commonly known as
NomC om. is comprised of six to seven undergraduate
and graduate sfudents who are responsible for inter
viewing and nominating student members for the
openings on all University committees.
"Due to a change in plans, a student from last year's
panel didn't return this year, opening one student po
sition on the Judicial Panel Pool." Torres said.
In 1997. the University replaced the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 196S with a new judicial system, de
signed to give students the primary role in the deci
sion-making process. Under the old charter, almost all
cases were decided by a single administrator rather
than by a panel composed of both students and facul
ty / staff, as it is now.
When formal charges of academic dishonesty, as
specified in the Honor Code, or violations of other stu
dents' Fundamental Standard rights are filed, four stu
dents Irom the 30-person Judicial Panel Pool are cho
sen to hear the case. Two faculty and / or staff mem
bers are also selected from a separate pool.
Senior Sarah Grossman-Swenson, in her second
year on the Judicial Panel Pool, said she served on
about five cases a quarter last year. Typically, around
12 cases are brought before the panel each quarter.
"1 really felt like I had an impact on student's lives.
In most ol the cases I hear, students just got stressed
out and made bad decisions. We're here to help them
to make better decisions in the future.
"I've had a very positive experience with the new
judicial system, and would encourage other students
to gel involved, particularly those interested in law or
mediating." Grossman-Swenson said.
Another member ol last year's pool also encour
aged more students to take part
