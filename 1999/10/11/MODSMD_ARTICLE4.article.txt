dan at the turn of the century to ad
dress the entire student body.

Baha and reflected on his message.
Freshman Negin Toosi, a member
of the association who described the
1912 visit for the audience, explained
that Abdu'l-Baha's visit "was not
only a meeting of the East and West.
It was the presence of a spiritual
leader in a center for education and
scholarship â€” the meeting of religion
and reason."
According to Toosi. this setting
was especially appropriate since
Abdu'l-Baha used science, nature
and philosophy to demonstrate the
teachings of his father. Baha'u'llah.
Many of the speakers recounted
their personal experiences as mem
bers of the Baha'i community and
followers of the faith. Brandon Bul
lock, another member of the associa
tion. talked about Abdu'l-Baha's in
fluence on his life. According to Bul
lock. the teachings "continue to

change my life and continue to in
spire me to be a better person.'
After the scheduled program, the
audience remained in the courtyard
while members of the Stanlord
Baha'i and the surrounding Palo
Alto Baha'i community discussed the
performance and the faith .
Fred Westin. an undergraduate
who encountered the Baha'i faith tor
the first time on Saturday, said that he
"was just trying to put words to this
experience. It's sort ot what I've been
thinking for 22 years."
Osborne said he was excited by
the prospect of new members.
"We think we have a really cool
message to give to people,'' he said.
"But there's no proselytizing in the
Baha'i faith. New members can share
with us, and we share with them."
According to senior Kathy Wiatt,
a member of both the Baha'i Associ
ation and Talisman. Abdu'l-Baha is
an "exemplar of the qualities that
Baha'u'llah talked about in his teach
ings and writings."

The Baha'i faith teaches racial
unity, peace among nations, the
equality between men and women,
the reconciliation of religion and sei
ence and the necessity for an individ
ual search for the truth. Toosi said.
The presence of the Baha'i on the
Stanford campus began in the early
19205, when the first Baha'i student
enrolled.
This presence was felt again in
September when University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper co-signed a let
ter with other university presidents
expressing concern over the arrest of
36 faculty and administrators of the
Baha'i Institute of Higher Education
in Iran last fall.
The letter stated, "we request the
unconditional release of the BIHF
members that remain in detention
and the cessation of further actions
against BIHE. We call on the Iranian
government to allow the Iranian pu>
pie, of whatever race, gender, class or
creed, to pursue higher education of
their own choosing."
