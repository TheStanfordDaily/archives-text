BEFORE THE PRESENTATION
Archimedes claimed he could move the
world if someone could give him a firm
spot upon which to stand.
Capital One provides just such a spot
for individuals seeking the opportunity
to move today's world.
Archimedes recognized the power of one
person in the right place with the right
tools. So does Capital One.
Our culture is built upon individual
contributions and driven by countless
innovations. You'll find these innova
tions —and opportunities to push them
even farther—in all areas of Capital One:
financial services, telecommunications
and wherever we grow tomorrow.
Capital One appreciates what bright,
talented, eager people like yourself can
do. And if you have what it takes,
we're prepared to challenge you with
tough problems and reward you with
the exciting opportunities that come
with a growth company.
