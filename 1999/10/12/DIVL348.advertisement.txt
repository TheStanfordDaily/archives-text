Are You Free?
Does Your College Mandate Thought Reform at Orientation?
Are Your Private Conscience and Religious Liberty Respected?
Are Your Rights Secure?
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, Inc. (FIRE) wants to protect your
right, as students, to believe as your own minds and consciences direct. At private colleges
and universities, it is guaranteed by principles of academic freedom and contract law, and,
we believe, by various state and federal statutes.
FIRE believes that colleges and universities have no right to require you to reveal your
political affiliations, sexual practices and attitudes, views on race and ethnicity, demeaning
or embarrassing behaviors, intimate aspects of family relationships, or legally protected and
privileged relationships (such as with lawyers, physicians, and clergy). Such invasions of
privacy occur every year in mandatory freshman orientation, in campus judicial systems, in
residential programs, and in "multicultural" and other "sensitivity training" sessions that
seek to enforce one politically correct view of life. FIRE believes that you are free to discuss
and debate all issues when and as you see fit, but that colleges and universities are morally
and often legally prohibited from intruding coercively upon your privacy and conscience.
Help us to end this scandal and to secure compliance with the law. We invite you to send us
accurate information about such violations and any documentation that you can share. We
hope that you will include your name and contact information so that we might communicate
with you, but, in all cases, we promise you the fullest possible confidentiality and respect of
your privacy. Please send your materials to:
