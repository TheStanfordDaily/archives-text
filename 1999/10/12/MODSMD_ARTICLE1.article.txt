tempt to reign in qualified job ap

Bailey said the ('enter'sgoal this
year lias been to diversify the fair's
offerings and "draw in a wider
range of industries."
Numerous well-known "'dot
com" industries. such as
Amazon.com and barnesandno
ble.com. promise to be a highlight
of the fair this year.
In addition, main public service
and non-profit organizations will
be represented, such as Ameri-

lord.edii:s9l/jed99.htm.
Most of these companies have
become a part of the fair through
Cardinal Recruiting, which is the
on-campus job recruiting program.
Coordinators have especially
sought to bring in companies from
more undcrrepresented fields, par
Ocularis those for which there lias

been an expressed interest from
students.
Most companies want students
to fill out resumes and to arrange
for a later interview, whether
through the school, in collabora
tion with the center or through
more individual arrangements be
tween the student and the compa
ny.
The majority of companies al
the fair are looking to hire new em
ployees. though there is no guaran
tee that this year is a high employ
ment year for any particular com
pany.
Because of the large number of
technical industries represented at

the fair in past years. Bailey fears a
general misperception that the fair
only offers technical employers and
is onlv for students looking at tech
nical fields.
Fins year, she promises, "this is
not the case," stressing instead the
fair coordinators' emphasis on a
"balance ol representatives" in
myriad fields.
Hie fair will boast representa
tives from main other fields, such
as public relations, both health care
and financial consulting, advertis
ing and education.
Virtually any field a student
could want to explore. Bailey said,
will "he here and can be found."
