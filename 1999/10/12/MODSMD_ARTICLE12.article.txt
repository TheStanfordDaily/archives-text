Thy the hell
%/%/ am I searing
TT my scalp
with blue paste?" I asked
myself as I applied Loreal
hair bleach to my previ
ously unirritated cranium.
Perhaps because 1 felt my

personality withering away as a result of full
absorption in my Mechanical Hngineering
classes, I decided to bleach my hair at the
end of my sophomore fall quarter. As I
applied this paste to my hair (by the way, a
bad idea — let someone else do it for you),
a friend of mine came into the bathroom
and told me, "You know that bleached hair
is a chick magnet." "Chick magnet?" I
asked him. 1 thanked him for the obviously
errant support, brushed off his comment
and waited some more until either my hair
was white or I started balding prematurely.
I.ittle did I know the adventures that having
bleached hair would bring me.
For starters, my friend was right. Clirls
dig the bleached hair. Within a week of The
Bleaching, I had had a random hookup,
which hadn't happened in a while (I can't
say for sure whether this was a result of the
hair or the six shots of Cioldschlager I had
ingested a few hours earlier), and I took a
girl out on a date.
Other abnormal things started happen
ing too. I was now "alternative." With this
name apparently comes certain stereotypes.
A friend of mine told me that many of her
friends (granted, they are in Ram's Head)
thought I was t>av. "You know, bleached

hair, somewhat quiet demeanor, I can't
blame them," she said. And after The
Bleaching, I became a magnet for other
"alternative" types as well. The lip-ringed
Columbae resident in one of my classes
accosted me and asked me to be her partner
for our final project.
Curiously, service at the Coffee House
became infinitely quicker. People at parties
somehow perceived that I was a social
smoker and I was constantly being asked for
cigarettes. The most annoying thing, how
ever, was that out in the real world (a.k.a.
outside of Stanford), I was somehow not
taken as seriously. The Bleaching had
somehow reverted me to irresponsible
teenager status in the eyes of the shop own
ers, bank tellers and the parents of the kids
I tutored for the SATs.
After getting this treatment for over two
weeks, I began wondering: what exactly
does a change such as The Bleaching mean?
Was this behavior I was seeing from others
merely the result of an established stereo
type, or had I somehow changed my per
sonality to fit into my new image?
Initially, 1 think people were behaving
differently toward me because of preset
stereotypes. Later, however, I think that I
bought into these stereotypes and loosened
up my behavior to fit into what was allow
able for a guy with bleached hair. 1 became
conscious that I was getting more attention
from the female persuasion, and as a result,
became more aggressive in meeting girls.
Feeling I had an excuse to act brasher, I
became more obnoxious in dealing with

certain people, such as shop owners, who
assumed that I acted a certain way.
After the roots grew out, I realized 1
would either have to buy a brush or cut off
my blond locks, and elected for the latter.
Things gradually settled back to the way
they used to be, and I began thinking some
more. How much of our personalities are
formed by how others see us? I had experi
enced small changes in a time period of only
one month. Had the rest of my personality
been formed by external perceptions I have
gotten my whole life? Are we only the
result of established cultural stereotypes?
My response, with further delving, is not
so rash: We decide our own behavior. This
behavior, however, is amplified by how oth
ers see us. For those of us who have grown
up like me, well within the stylistic limits of
Americana, you are assumed to be living
the cultural norm and are treated accord
ingly.
Those who decide to make a statement
with their personal image are seen as want
ing to make that statement, and that per
ception attaches stereotypes that one can be
influenced by. Like I was influenced by how
others treated me with my bleached hair,
we can all be sensitive to how our image
influences others to influence us.
