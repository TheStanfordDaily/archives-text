The United States is a
ferocious beast and not a
peaceful dove
I lie caption The Daily presented on its
front page on Oct. 7, "Albright visits Stan
lord to promote nuclear test treaty." really
intrigued me.
It read, "II we do not sign the treaty, we
will he left without response to our children
when they ask why, when we had a chance
to put America on the side of banning
nuclear testing, we said no." Who is The
Daily trying to convince by way of enlarging
this quotation?
I wiint to draw readers' attention to her
comment published in the same article:
"We (the U.S.) have conducted over HXX)
nuclear tests ... we do not need to do
more." It is after the U.S. has had its fill of

testing and killing that it wants to prevent
others from acquiring the same power it
has.
This is the re;il message out of the article
and not the misleading caption. Albright in
fact echoed this idea when she said. "This
treaty is in the national security interest of
the I J.S. My preventing testing, the treaty
will prohibit the development of nuclear
power by nations who don't already have it."
Let me state some facts on U.S. foreign
policy:
1. Japan declared that it would surrender
in WWII and yet the U.S. used atomic
bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To this
day.the U.S. has not apologized officially
for this crime against civilians. No other
country in the world has undertaken ;i simi
lar action.
2. The U.S. is giving the most military aid
to Israel despite the fact that it does not
abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions

by occupying Palestinian land since l ( >48,
the Golan Heights from Syria since 1%7
and the south part of Lebanon since IIW2.l l W2.
Additionally. Israel refuses to sign the
nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, a
fact accepted by the U.S. Israel is the only
country in the Middle Hast to have nuclear
weapons with an arsenal estimated to be
more than 2(H) nuclear war heads. Whenev
er the I J.N. Security Council has a new res
olution against Israel's actions (which are
many), the only member who vetoes them
every time is the U.S.
3. The U.S. gives itself the right to enter
other countries in order to bomb pharma
ceutical factories. In Sudan last year, the
factory that produced almost half of the
country's supply of children's medications
was bombed. To this day no official apology
has been made to them.
4. Madeline Albright herself has been
pushing to continue the sanctions killing

millions of children in Iraq.
5. Under Albright's administration, the
U.S. has the right to bomb any country with
out IJ.N. clearance. This is the case in the
Balkans. The Kosovar refugees on their
way back to Kosovo were denied any poten
tial weapons while the Serbs still kept their
forces armed.
The above are facts from history and
from the present. The U.S. (and Albright
herself) cannot convince anybody that they
are peaceful doves. I would say that the first
thing the countries of the world should do is
to tame the ferocious beast and to take its
killing weapons away. That is much more
important than anything else.
As for The Daily. I hope that you would
be more objective when relating a story.
Thank you.
