# Three home games in, halftime offerings lack controversy of previous years
## Band field shows off to a tame start 
### Roger Kim 
From performing at a beer festi
val in China to portraying Universi
ty of Southern California students
with broomsticks protruding from
their behinds, the Stanford Band has
been known for its free-spirited per
formances.
But three games into the 1999
Cardinal home football season, the
Band has yet to stir up controversy
a fact that doesn't seem to worry
most of its members.
" The main purpose of our shows
is to entertain ourselves and if lucky,
some of the students — and occa
sionally some adults," Band public
relations director Chris Henderson
said.
This year's band performances
have included a mild parody of "The
Sound of Music" and the formation
of a handicapped parking sign to
make fun of UCLA players sus
pended for illegally possessing hand
icapped parking permits.
Controversy such as that sur
rounding the 1947 season Notre
Dame football game show, in which
the band satirized Catholicism and
the Notre Dame mascot, the Fight
ing Irish, has not been raised.
The lack of controversial shows
has disappointed some students.
"Like all bands, 1 expected some
thing crazy from our band, but I
haven't seen anything so far," fresh
man Joe Shapiro said. "I'm expect
ing something for Big Game."
Following the '97 Notre Dame
pre-game and halftime shows, the

Athletic Department revamped the
approval procedure for the Band's
performances.
Now. the process includes a more
scrutinized reading of the Band's
performance scripts with more peo
ple involved in the readings.
However, Band members are
skeptical about the incident's influ
ence on current performances.
"It's a random chance what we're
going to think up in the meeting
room," said I lenderson. referring to
after-practice meetings, during

which ideas for the following perfor
mance are brainstormed.
The meetings involve three writ
ers who actually write the script and
other staff members interested in
the planning process.
A synopsis outlining the general
idea of the performance is then
taken to the Athletic Department to
be reviewed.
Band members rarely change the
script after the department's ap
proval.
Whether the final result iscontro-

versial depends on the audience.
Band members say.
"It's really a matter of people's
interpretations; we've only done two
shows so far. It's still early in the
year," writer Sarah Brandel, a se
nior. said.
Brandel also cites the change of
writers and staff each year as a possi
ble reason, if one exists at all. for
change of show content.
The Band changes its staff annu
ally. requiring new applications even
of its returning members.
