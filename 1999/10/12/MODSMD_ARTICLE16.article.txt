# Program strives for test score context

Colleges applicants' test scores
don't always tell the whole story.
Recognizing this, the Educational
Testing Service is now researching a
new tool that could help schools
identify particularly motivated stu
dents they might have otherwise
overlooked.
The project, called the "Strivers
program, aims to identify people
who achieve more than others from
their demographic background.
The new system is based on a
"Strivers" formula, an equation that
might soon be provided to universi
ties along with SAT scores. But
Stanford admissions officials ques
tion the impact it will have on their
policies.
"I think competent admission of
fices have been using a contextual
ized and therefore personalized ad
mission approach for a long, long
time," Dean of Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid Robert Kinnally said.
"I'm not sure ETS is going to tell us
more than we already know."
At least 14 characteristics are
under review as potential compo
nents to enter into the newlv weight-

Ed SA T scores. The student's race,
the family's socioeconomic status,
the high school quality, the student's
high-school GPA and the rigor of
the student's previous classes might
be some factors the formula takes
into account in its adjustment of raw
SAT scores.
Students would provide the
needed information though a ques
tionnaire. Of the two formulas
under review, one factors in race
and the other does not.
Whether or not the new system is
ethical, in the light of recent affirma
tive-action court decisions, has
sparked a nationwide debate.
At Stanford, a more valid ques
tion might not be whether the sys
tem is ethical, but whether ETS
should determine the context of
each applicant's scores for admis
sions staff.
Kinnally declined comment on
whether the Strivers formula would
change the University's admissions
policies.
"I have not studied every nook
and cranny of the formula yet, but I
think we already do a splendid job of
giving all of our applicants a fair
read." he said.
